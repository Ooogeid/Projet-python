1
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,129
Bret, you've been
gone for hours.

2
00:00:39,197 --> 00:00:42,066
I've been waiting for the
bread. Where have you been?

3
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:46,770
¶ I was wandering through
the streets of the city ¶

4
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:49,773
¶ rambling through
the avenues of time ¶

5
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:53,143
¶ when from nowhere
my eyes fell onto a girl ¶

6
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:56,113
¶ and by chance her eyes
fell onto mine... ¶

7
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,984
- oh.
- ¶ so I sat and I acted all nonchalant ¶

8
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:03,254
¶ she smoked
her lavender cigarette ¶

9
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:07,091
¶ reading the future
that lay in my hands ¶

10
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,960
¶ my shadow played
a bass clarinet... ¶

11
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:13,797
where are you going
with this, Bret?

12
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,001
¶ we waltzed down
a moonlit Boulevard ¶

13
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:20,204
¶ just two silhouettes
in the mist... ¶

14
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:24,241
- oh, yes.
- ¶ days went by and years went by ¶

15
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:27,444
- ¶ moments went by when we kissed... ¶
- when was this?

16
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:30,781
¶ she said, "your beard is
woven of heartache ¶

17
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,884
¶ and we'll drink
for the lonely tonight ¶

18
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,488
¶ and the moon is
a horny old drunkard..." ¶

19
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,891
uh, Bret, could you please
move over to your right?

20
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,495
¶ we drank dandelion wine
and we reminisced ¶

21
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:48,132
- ¶ about the moment when we first met that day... ¶
- I'm trying to watch TV.

22
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,535
¶ then we reminisced about
how we first reminisced... ¶

23
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:54,638
oh, yeah?
Sounds a bit gay.

24
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:58,008
¶ she handed me
a broken memory ¶

25
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:01,645
¶ a keepsake
to forevermore save ¶

26
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:05,249
¶ for a brief taste of love
is as sweet as any ¶

27
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:08,619
¶ and with that
she made her way. ¶

28
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:12,489
so did you... did you
get the bread, or...

29
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:15,526
- oh. No, I forgot.
- 'Cause I've been waiting here

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,194
with all my sandwich
fillings all ready.

31
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:20,464
Yeah, I was just really busy
thinking about this girl.

32
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:22,867
What was her name?

33
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:26,203
¶ she said her name
was a secret ¶

34
00:02:26,238 --> 00:02:29,673
¶ then she said her
name was cheri... ¶

35
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:31,876
is her middle name cheri?

36
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,578
So it's
a secret cheri maybe?

37
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:36,514
- ¶ mmm, maybe... ¶
- what she look like?

38
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:39,250
¶ she looked like
a parisian river... ¶

39
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:42,620
- what, dirty?
- ¶ she looked like a chocolate eclair... ¶

40
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:46,090
- that's rare.
- ¶ her eyes were reflections of eyes... ¶

41
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:49,527
- oh, nice.
- ¶ and the rainbows danced in her hair... ¶

42
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:52,496
- oh yeah.
- ¶ she reminded me of a winter's morning... ¶

43
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:56,133
- oh, frigid.
- ¶ her perfume was eau de toilette... ¶

44
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:59,703
- what does that mean?
- ¶ she was comparable to cleopatra... ¶

45
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:02,873
- quite old.
- ¶ she was like shakespeare's Juliet... ¶

46
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:07,044
- oh, 13?
- ¶ the bohemians of soho did pirouette ¶

47
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:10,648
¶ as we waltzed through
the streets of Manhattan ¶

48
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:14,485
¶ on rivers of ribbon
and sailboats of song... ¶

49
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:17,521
Bret, did any of this
actually happen?

50
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:19,723
¶ there's a girl
I described ¶

51
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,392
¶ she's as real
as the wind ¶

52
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,961
¶ it's true
I saw her today ¶

53
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:28,098
¶ the other details
are inventions ¶

54
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,402
¶ because I prefer her
that way. ¶

55
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:34,772
so you're saying
you made all of that up?

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,608
I made 95%
of that up.

57
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,677
Which bit's true?

58
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:42,379
I saw a girl.

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,949
Oh! So your excuse
for not getting the bread

60
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:47,051
is because you were
on a fantasy date?

61
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:48,953
Why don't you go
on a real date?

62
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:51,121
Because they're never
as good as fantasy dates.

63
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:52,423
Oh yeah. Where does
she work, this girl?

64
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,725
She works down
at the cheap zoo.

65
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,861
- The pet store?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

66
00:03:56,928 --> 00:04:01,031
- She's, um, one of the cat tamers.
- Oh, yes.

67
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,434
Every time I go in there
I freeze up, I panic

68
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:05,769
and I end up buying two
goldfish I don't even want.

69
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:08,472
- Why do you buy two then?
- Well, if you get two, you get one free.

70
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:10,274
But you don't even want
any goldfish, Bret.

71
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:13,410
- Why would you buy two?
- Might as well get one free.

72
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:15,579
Hey, Jemaine, I was wondering if
you'd think about being my wingman...

73
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:17,848
- oh! No.
...like in "top gun."

74
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,217
No, Bret.
Do I have to?

75
00:04:20,318 --> 00:04:22,152
Umm, uh, yes.

76
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:25,222
- Okay. All right.
- If you want to do it, there's a condition.

77
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:26,690
- What?
- You can't hit on her.

78
00:04:26,758 --> 00:04:28,359
What? Why...
why would I hit on her?

79
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,195
- You always do that.
- Oh! When?

80
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:34,431
- Always.
- Oh, okay. So you do something every time,

81
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:36,100
and suddenly
you've got a reputation.

82
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:38,135
- You do it.
- I do not.

83
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,970
- You do it.
- I do not.

84
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:41,639
Yes, you do.

85
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:44,441
- What are you doing in here?
- Fixing the shower.

86
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:47,411
- It wasn't broken. - well,
I'm sorry... I broke it.

87
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,180
I'm sorry,
but you're always...

88
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,682
you're always making moves
on his girls.

89
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,084
Okay, I will not make
a move on this girl.

90
00:04:54,152 --> 00:04:55,853
Yeah, you should
remain hidden.

91
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,855
Yes, remain hidden.

92
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:06,463
Take a photo of me in
front of the budgebears.

93
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:09,800
Bret, you're stalling. Just
go and ask her out for a drink.

94
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:11,769
Yeah, okay.

95
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,842
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

96
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:20,010
Are you thirsty?

97
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:21,445
What?

98
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:23,747
Goldfish...
one goldfish, please.

99
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,016
Umm, if you buy two, you.

100
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:28,886
Okay.

101
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,455
What time
do you feed the cats?

102
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:42,700
Hey! What's up, guys?

103
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:45,569
- Hey, Dave.
- What's with the fish, Bret?

104
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,739
- I've got a girlfriend.
- No.

105
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,509
Uh, not... not completely
a girlfriend.

106
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:53,911
- She doesn't know I exist.
- But you do...

107
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,614
- you do exist, don't you?
- Yeah. I exist, yeah.

108
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,185
'Cause you guys said
you didn't exist before.

109
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:03,687
- Yeah, we... we exist.
- Yeah, I exist.

110
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:06,524
- I fully exist.
- Why did you tell me you were from never never land?

111
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:08,125
- New zealand.
- New zealand, man.

112
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,261
But you said
you guys flew here.

113
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,763
On a plane.
On a plane, Dave.

114
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:16,100
Hey, Dave, do you have any of those
miniature headphone microphone sets?

115
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,969
- 'Cause I want to put my wingman here in a van.
- Yeah, sure.

116
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:21,605
He's gonna give me advice
while I go and see this girl.

117
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,307
He got an idea
from a sitcom.

118
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,042
Jemaine's
your wingman, huh?

119
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:26,977
- Yes.
- What the fuck does he know about women?

120
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,947
I know about brassieres.
Do you know about those?

121
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,016
Guys, women like
three things:

122
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,051
Men in kilts,
southern comfort,

123
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:36,086
and Chris isaak's
"wicked game."

124
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:37,688
Whoa, he does know
more than you.

125
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:39,423
Yeah, I think you're
oversimplifying women.

126
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:45,129
- Okay, band meeting.
- Uh, Murray?

127
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,264
Oh, greg, I'm just in the
middle of something, please.

128
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:50,134
- I'm sorry, Murray.
- Shush now, okay?

129
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,902
- What's gotten into you?
- It's just that...

130
00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:54,305
please! This won't
take a minute.

131
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:57,007
Now, where was I,
Jemaine?

132
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:59,109
Uh... yeah, you were
at "Jemaine."

133
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:01,679
- Okay. Present.
- Yes, present.

134
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:03,681
- Bret.
- Mm-hmm.

135
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,050
Okay, and Murray...
present.

136
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:08,252
That wasn't
too hard, was it?

137
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:10,120
- Now what's the problem?
- Helen's on the line.

138
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:13,524
Well, why didn't you say?!
What does she want?

139
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,860
She says she's in a meeting
with the Chinese ambassador.

140
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:18,496
There's 16 people there, but
there's only 12 sandwiches.

141
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,999
Oh no.
I only ordered 12.

142
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:28,005
- On line one.
- Sorry, guys, official business.

143
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,040
Hey, helen.

144
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:31,609
Yes.

145
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:34,078
Yup, 16 people.
I heard.

146
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:37,348
Yeah, only 12 sandwiches.
I know. It's terrible.

147
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:38,983
Yeah.

148
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:40,851
Why?

149
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:42,753
Oh, um...

150
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:46,423
uh, to be honest with you,
at the end of the day, um...

151
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:51,095
actually, I think
greg could be responsible.

152
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:54,532
I was walking past
his desk

153
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:57,568
and I saw
in his wastepaper bin

154
00:07:57,636 --> 00:08:01,338
some wrappers which I think
were from sandwiches.

155
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:04,408
And just looking
at his face earlier,

156
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:07,311
I did notice he had some
crumbs just around his mouth...

157
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:09,346
just on each side. I think
they were sandwich crumbs.

158
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:11,415
I'm not pointing
any fingers,

159
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:12,950
but I think
if I was you,

160
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:17,054
I would probably look at
the third suspect being greg.

161
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,690
Yeah, I understand.
I'll tell him.

162
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:25,796
Um, helen's disappointed
that you ate four of them,

163
00:08:25,864 --> 00:08:28,933
so... sorry about that.

164
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,402
That's okay, Murray.

165
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:33,537
Thank you.

166
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,906
I think he heard
the whole thing, didn't he?

167
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,209
- Probably. He was just standing there.
- Yeah.

168
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:39,844
I've never seen him
that angry.

169
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:42,513
Murray, do we have
any gigs or anything?

170
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:44,815
- Because I've got to go.
- Got something on, have you?

171
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:50,621
- Yeah. - what do you mean? Hing
- I've put "nothing" here. Ook.

172
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:52,923
- "No need to come in."
- Well, why have you called us in?

173
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,558
- I don't know.
- You wrote that down?

174
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:56,961
- Yeah, I wrote "nothing."
- But you called us up

175
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:59,029
and told us to come in

176
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:00,865
to tell us there's
no need to come in?

177
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:02,633
- That's weird, isn't it?
- Why'd you call us?

178
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:05,836
Well, it's like...
it's kind of like a habit.

179
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:07,938
You know, we sort of fall
into these patterns.

180
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:10,774
Day after day, we end up
doing the same sort of thing.

181
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,744
It's a bit like
shelley and I, actually,

182
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:15,479
looking back.

183
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:18,549
I think that's where
the cracks started to show...

184
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:20,985
just getting used
to each other so much,

185
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:23,053
taking each other
for granted

186
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:25,756
like a pair of old sneakers...
they're always there.

187
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,159
Put them on,
same thing day after day.

188
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,134
Oh, I'll get us
some cake.

189
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:40,171
Greg, is there any
of that orange cake left?

190
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:42,640
It's Murray.

191
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,111
Oh no.
He is angry.

192
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:50,915
Sorry, guys. I'm gonna
have to calm the storm.

193
00:09:57,255 --> 00:10:00,291
Uh, can you hear me, Bret?

194
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:02,526
Chicken torso.

195
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:04,361
Chicken torso,
can you hear me?

196
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:06,864
Chicken torso, raise a
hand if you can hear me.

197
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:08,933
- Yeah.
- There you go.

198
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:11,168
- Cool.
- Now be brave, Bret.

199
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,304
Stop shaking, Bret.
Stop shaking.

200
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:16,073
Stand with your feet apart
like your balls are on fire.

201
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:19,910
Don't do the accompanying
face, though... just the stance.

202
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:22,847
Go up to her.
Just approach her.

203
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,715
- Back up, back up.
- Good work, Bret.

204
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:27,084
Now say hell turn.

205
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:29,820
No no, stay facing away from her.
It makes you seem different.

206
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:32,189
Half ignore her and half
pay attention to her.

207
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,159
- Hello.
- Hi, do you need help?

208
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:37,394
- Turn side on.
- Say somethin you assho!

209
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,064
- Um...
- say hello.

210
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:42,299
- Hello.
- Hi, can I help you?

211
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:45,302
- Compliment her hair.
- Ask her what's up with her face.

212
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:47,571
- What's up with your face?
- What?

213
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,207
You shouldn't have said
that. It's too early.

214
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,577
Is that a walkie-talkie
on your kilt?

215
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:55,646
Tell her it's an ipod.

216
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:58,315
- No, this is just...
- an old ipod.

217
00:10:58,383 --> 00:11:00,818
- It's an old ipod.
- Okay.

218
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:03,888
- Good work. Now tell her you're freaky.
- Don't tell her that.

219
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,224
- Tell her you're a freak.
- Why would you tell her that he's freaky?

220
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,561
- How's he gonna get into her
pants if he doesn't... -

221
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,898
can I help you with something?

222
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:16,467
I'll just... I'll just
get a goldfish, please.

223
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:25,476
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mel.

224
00:11:25,544 --> 00:11:27,711
Hey, why have you been
standing here for so long?

225
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:29,346
It's been, like, hours...

226
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:32,449
like, three...
and a half hours.

227
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,718
- Just hanging out.
- Just... just...

228
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:37,021
are you gonna steal
this car?

229
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:39,390
- Oh, no, we're just spying on someone...
- no no.

230
00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:40,858
- Who?
...for Bret.

231
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:42,660
- No one. No.
- No one.

232
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:45,196
Oh my God, is it me?

233
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:47,464
- No. No.
- It's me, isn't it?

234
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:49,466
- No.
- You've been watching me.

235
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:52,069
That is...
so creepy, you guys.

236
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:54,205
That is an invasion
of my personal space.

237
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,540
Why would you do that?
Why would you watch me?

238
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:59,777
Have you been watching me?
What did you see?

239
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,279
What have I been doing?
I don't even know what I.

240
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,281
- Mel, it wasn't... we weren't
watching you. - It wasn't you, Mel.

241
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,450
It's the girl
over at the pet shop.

242
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,918
- You're following her?
- No.

243
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:09,553
Bret's in love with her.

244
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:11,288
- No, I'm not. I'm not.
- Bret!

245
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,057
- Why?
- Well... I'm not.

246
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:14,758
Bret, if you
really love someone,

247
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:16,494
you have to get
to know them as a person.

248
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,662
You can't just
watch them from afar.

249
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:23,501
You know, you have to learn
what they are like on the inside.

250
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:26,604
Get closer. Find the key to their heart.

251
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:31,041
I like to find useful
information in bills, letters.

252
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:33,043
Sometimes I collect
nail clippings,

253
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:34,745
but that's just me.

254
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,348
Bret, does she run
an indian food takeaway?

255
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:40,784
- No.
- Here, use these. It's easier.

256
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:43,320
Oh, thanks.
Why do you have those?

257
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,056
- Yeah. No reason.
- Bret, she loves eggs.

258
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:50,561
- Make her an omelet.
- Oh, is her name savannah? Does she work at petland?

259
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:53,130
- Works at petland, yeah.
- Oh.

260
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:57,368
- Half an avocado.
- She has $145 on her electric Bill.

261
00:12:57,435 --> 00:12:59,537
- Tea bags, yogurt.
- That's great, Mel.

262
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,739
You know, Bret,
when you love someone,

263
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:04,508
you need all the ammunition
you can get to take them down.

264
00:13:04,543 --> 00:13:06,310
- Right.
- Look at me and Doug.

265
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:09,046
He resisted at first.
In the end he cracked

266
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:12,082
and look at us today...
we couldn't be happier.

267
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:15,886
Mel, this dumpster is definitely
from a different building.

268
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:18,022
Keep looking, Doug.
- Bret...

269
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,990
I think
she has man's feet.

270
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:21,892
Man feet, Bret.

271
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,128
Ah. Motorcycle magazines.

272
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,931
- She must like tough guys.
- Tough guys?

273
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:28,532
Yeah.

274
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:34,171
Jemaine,
come and look at this.

275
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:36,674
- There's greg, see?
- Yeah.

276
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:39,109
- Look how sad he looks.
- He looks normal.

277
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:40,644
Who's that
he's talking to?

278
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:42,546
Might be a businessman,
do you think?

279
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:44,515
- I don't know.
- Jemaine.

280
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,917
I want you
to be my wingman.

281
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:49,253
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

282
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,122
Distract his mate
while I apologize to greg.

283
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:54,492
- Come on.
- I don't know what to say to a businessman.

284
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:58,128
- Business stuff... you know,
stock exchange, calculators.

285
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:00,931
Hey. Hey, guys.

286
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:02,600
- Hey, guys.
- Mind if we join you?

287
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,568
Actually, we're in the
middle of a meeting, Murray.

288
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:06,837
Oh, like that,
is it, greg?

289
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:08,873
No no, it's ne.
Please sit down.

290
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,443
Hi there.

291
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:16,080
- Well... hi, greg.
- I like your tie.

292
00:14:16,114 --> 00:14:18,415
Well, greg, I just wanted to say sorry

293
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,218
you know, for telling helen
that you ate those sandwiches.

294
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:24,588
I know everyone's been talking about it.

295
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,391
I just wanted you to know
that I know you're innocent.

296
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:30,561
And... oh, I got you some
chocolates from my desk.

297
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:35,065
They're a bit
squashed, but...

298
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,234
thank you, Murray.

299
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:39,837
No breaking through that
wall of ice, is there?

300
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:42,673
Another chocolate.

301
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,076
Thank you.

302
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:50,414
- Come on, Jemaine, let's go.
...2- 3-6.

303
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:52,716
- Jemaine.
- This is a fun game. Do you ever play it online?

304
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:55,452
- Uh... - no, Jemaine
doesn't go online.

305
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,589
- Come on, let's... - okay.
Sorry, sven, I have to go.

306
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:00,491
- It was nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

307
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,966
Bret, I don't want
to be your wingman anymore.

308
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:12,136
- What? Why not?
- It's tiring.

309
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,637
- I'm exhausted.
- One last thing.

310
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,239
- No.
- I bump into savannah tonight,

311
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:18,108
you mug us and I beat
you up a little bit.

312
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:20,010
- Okay.
- Yeah?

313
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,280
- Where'd you get this idea?
- I saw it on a sitcom.

314
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:26,851
- Did it work on the sitcom?
- Not completely, no,

315
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:29,420
but this is real, so I think
we've got a better chance.

316
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:44,068
- Hey.
- Hi.

317
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:45,803
- Who...
- the goldfish guy...

318
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:48,772
- oh.
...like, "can I get a goldfish?"

319
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,508
- Okay, yeah, I kinda...
- yeah?

320
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:52,142
Yeah, you look
kind of familiar.

321
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,979
Yeah, I've bought, like,
63 goldfish off you.

322
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:57,548
- Oh, that's a lot.
- Yeah. Yeah.

323
00:15:57,616 --> 00:16:00,851
- Do you want me to walk you
home? - Oka... all right. Okay.

324
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,420
I'm happy to be your bodyguard.
This is a dangerous corner.

325
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,892
Okay, when they come past,
we have to jump on them.

326
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,493
- Yeah yeah, I know.
- You got it?

327
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:11,795
Yeah, I've got it. I've done
this before. I know what to do.

328
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,465
And Bret is going to
beat us up a little bit.

329
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:17,134
Yeah, if he does that,
I'll fucking kill him.

330
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:19,503
No. No no no no.
Don't kill him.

331
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:22,072
If that piece of shit
lays a finger on me,

332
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,642
- I will fuck him up.
- No, we've got to let him beat us,

333
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:26,544
and then savannah
will be impressed that...

334
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,646
right right. No, that's
right, that's right.

335
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:30,648
- You told me that.
- He thinks she likes macho guys.

336
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:32,116
Right, and then he looks
good. I've got it. Okay.

337
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:34,585
But the money... the money,
50-50, right down the middle.

338
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:37,488
- Okay? I'm not gonna do... - no,
we have to let them keep the purse.

339
00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:39,924
- What? What?
- We have to let them keep the purse.

340
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:41,492
I told you...
did I not explain that?

341
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:42,960
- You know, this is bullshit.
- I should've explained that.

342
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:44,428
No, Jemaine,
this is bullshit.

343
00:16:44,496 --> 00:16:46,263
I didn't come out here
to do pro Bono work.

344
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:48,332
I do this for a living.
This is my profession.

345
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,202
You can't take advantage
of our friendship like this.

346
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:53,204
Well, I hope it doesn't
come across that way.

347
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:57,041
- I just love fish. Do you love fish?
- Yeah. Yeah.

348
00:16:57,108 --> 00:16:59,310
- Yeah, I thought you'd love fish.
- I think so.

349
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:02,847
- Man, fish are great. I wish I
was a fish. - Hey, I was gonn... I...

350
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:06,584
I was just gonna get some
sushi right down the block.

351
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,854
I don't know if you've eaten dinner.
Would you want to come with me?

352
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:12,423
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, good, okay.

353
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:15,726
- Cool, so... - should we go
that way and go around the block?

354
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:18,562
I'm doing
pretend muggings.

355
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,365
- How's this look?
- What the fuck is on your face?

356
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:23,234
I just thought it would
make me look more criminal.

357
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:24,835
Take it off. You're like the hamburglar.

358
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,871
That guy fucking scares me.
Take that off.

359
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:29,039
- You're creeping me out.
- Oh, here they come. Here they come.

360
00:17:29,107 --> 00:17:31,141
- Let's fuck 'em up!
- No, John... no, John!

361
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:33,477
- Down... ooh.
- Hey, give me that!

362
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:35,479
- Hey! Hey, you! Hey, leave her alone!
- No, let go of my bag!

363
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,481
- Oh my... oh my God!
- Give me that!

364
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:39,517
Give me that!
Let go of...

365
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:42,753
- oh my God! Oh my God! No, give me my purse!
- Oh! Oh no.

366
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:45,055
- Let go!
- Okay okay okay okay!

367
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:47,925
- Oh my... police! Hello?
- Oh! Ow.

368
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:50,361
Someone help!
Police!

369
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:53,797
- What did you bring him for?
- He's the only mugger I know, isn't he?

370
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:57,034
- Oh, he just busted my nose.
- Help!

371
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:58,936
Go away! Go away!

372
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:01,805
- Get... get out of here,
you freaking mugger!

373
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:05,809
- Oh my gosh,
are you okay?

374
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,512
Are you... oh my God!

375
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,482
That was ridiculous!

376
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,286
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Thank God I was here.

377
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:17,855
Well, yeah, I guess, except
that they took my purse and my...

378
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:19,623
- they stole your bag?
- Yes, they stole...

379
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:21,125
- yeah, they stole my bag.
- They're not supposed to do that.

380
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:23,027
Well, yeah, I know
they're not supposed to,

381
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:24,728
but they di...
of course... what?

382
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:26,964
Would you still like to get
a little bit of sushi?

383
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:28,966
- Okay.
- Yeah?

384
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,268
Is your nose okay?

385
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:32,670
It's okay, yeah.

386
00:18:32,704 --> 00:18:35,239
I'm just so glad
I was here to save you.

387
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:38,342
- Let's get the sushi.
- Huh. All right. Okay.

388
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:41,478
Oh, it worked. They're
walking away together.

389
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:43,981
I know.

390
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:46,350
Hey, you weren't maced.
Why are you crying?

391
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:49,453
I'm not fucking crying.

392
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:54,825
Did... have you
still got that purse?

393
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:56,827
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's force of habit.

394
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,967
- It was us.
- Put your hands down, asshole.

395
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,139
Well, officer,
it's quite simple.

396
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:11,742
There's been a misunderstanding.
You see, Jemaine here is

397
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,477
a member of the new
zealand consulate staff,

398
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:16,046
so therefore he's subject
to diplomatic immunity.

399
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,015
Do you have any
identification for yourself

400
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,817
or the gentleman
in question?

401
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:22,653
Okay, there's a card.

402
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:25,256
"Jemaine clemaine,
new zealand diplomat."

403
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,259
This looks like
it was made

404
00:19:28,326 --> 00:19:29,894
on one of those machines
you find at kinko's.

405
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,529
That's right. Yeah, we've
got an account there.

406
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:34,999
We get them all done there.
And here's my one.

407
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:37,902
You can get
1,000 done for $10.

408
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,370
Where do you get
your cards done?

409
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:41,105
You've got badges,
have you? I suppose.

410
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:42,840
- Do you get those at kinko's?
- I'm sorry. You are?

411
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,642
I'm Murray hewitt.

412
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:46,744
I'm the deputy cultural attache
for the new zealand government,

413
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,113
and this is
my assistant greg.

414
00:19:49,181 --> 00:19:51,315
- Hello.
- Hi.

415
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:53,617
He's actually angry
with me about something,

416
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:55,686
so I've brought him
in here as a treat.

417
00:19:55,754 --> 00:19:59,089
We don't really need him, but it's
good to get him out of the office.

418
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:02,259
Iook, the diplomat in question
was guilty of assault.

419
00:20:02,294 --> 00:20:04,862
Typical.
Yeah, I understand.

420
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:07,565
He's sort of a bit
of a renegade, but...

421
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:11,769
- okay, you can just take him with you
- thank you.

422
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:14,305
Can we get my friend John out as well?

423
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:15,906
- No.
- My friend John...

424
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,209
all right. Okay, greg? Friends again?

425
00:20:18,276 --> 00:20:20,544
- Uh, sure, Murray.
- Come here.

426
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:23,047
All right. I knew bringing
you here was a good thing.

427
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:25,749
- Sorry about the sandwiches,
okay? - Mm-hmm. Sure.

428
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:28,219
- It's good to have the vibe back to what we had.
- You know what?

429
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:30,287
Gentlemen, I'm actually
quite busy at the moment,

430
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,790
so if you could maybe do this
some other time, maybe?

431
00:20:32,824 --> 00:20:35,826
Sorry, officer.
Yeah. Thank you.

432
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:38,429
Thank you
for having me, officer.

433
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:42,299
Hey, what's up?
It's Dave.

434
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,668
Remember... tell her
you're freaky, Bret.

435
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:47,338
Would you like peanut
butter or a jam sushi?

436
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:50,174
Tell her you're freaky,
Bret. Tell her you're freaky.

437
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:53,177
- Um, I would love neither...
- and Jemaine says can you come and get him out of jail.

438
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:55,646
...if that's okay with you.
- Okay.

439
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,849
- Who was that?
- Um, uh... pfft.

440
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:01,752
- I'm freaky.
- Uh, what?

441
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:04,722
Did I mention that I'm one
of those sort of freaky guys?

442
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:07,258
I don't think that
you mentioned that.

443
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:09,360
Yeah, I'm freaky. -

444
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:13,864

00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:33,103
¶ we're flying
on homemade pillow wings? ¶

493
00:23:33,171 --> 00:23:34,905
¶ oh! ¶

494
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:47,484
¶ I told you
I was freaky ¶

495
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:53,457
¶ I told you
I was freaky, baby. ¶

496
00:23:57,829 --> 00:23:59,763
hey.
Hey, Jemaine.

497
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:03,701
- How was your night?
- Uh, well,

498
00:24:03,768 --> 00:24:06,537
it was pretty exhausting,
actually, Bret.

499
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:08,305
I don't think...

500
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,676
is that my honey?

501
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,478
Maybe.

502
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:17,681
Is that my money jar?

503
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,650
Hey, Jemaine, did I
introduce you to savannah?

504
00:24:19,718 --> 00:24:22,086
Oh, hey.

505
00:24:22,153 --> 00:24:24,321
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

506
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:28,359
Uh, I'm gonna
go get changed.

507
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:36,300
I owe you $14.

508
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,038
You know,
how's it going with her?

509
00:24:41,072 --> 00:24:42,907
It's good. I think
it's going pretty well.

510
00:24:42,974 --> 00:24:44,909
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You know, it's just the first date.

511
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:47,711
- Yeah, of course it is.
- Hey.

512
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,180
Hey.

513
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:52,183
Wow, you look
a lot like, uh,

514
00:24:52,217 --> 00:24:55,519
- that guy who mugged us.
- Yeah, well, it was him.

515
00:24:55,554 --> 00:24:58,489
- Yeah, it was me.
- I actually asked him to pretend to mug us

516
00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:01,158
so I could save you and impress you, so
we could get to know each other better.

517
00:25:01,193 --> 00:25:03,060
Oh my... you what?
But you stole my bag.

518
00:25:03,094 --> 00:25:05,563
- Uh, yeah, we did. - well, he
wasn't supposed to take the bag, but...

519
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,464
- but there was a miscommunication.
- I know. I'm sorry,

520
00:25:07,532 --> 00:25:10,034
because I know you had the money to pay
your electricity Bill in there probably.

521
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:11,936
- You...
- $145.

522
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,372
Don't worry, I paid that...
well, I paid $10 off it.

523
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,241
How do you know
about my electricity Bill?

524
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,476
Well, I just went through your
rubbish and I found your Bill.

525
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:21,178
How do you even know
where I live?

526
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:23,380
- Common knowledge.
- I followed you home.

527
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:25,783
- Bret.
- What? Well, we followed you home.

528
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:28,319
- Oh my God. This is
sick. - He... mostly him.

529
00:25:28,386 --> 00:25:31,889
- What? I'm not sick.
- Please please don't come to the pet store again.

530
00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:33,824
A lot of these were
his idea. Let me wa...

531
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:35,326
- let me show you out.
- No, that's okay.

532
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,328
- So you're single?
- I'm fine, thank you.

533
00:25:37,395 --> 00:25:39,563
Goodbye. Thank you.

534
00:25:42,534 --> 00:25:45,836
- She's a bit crazy.
- Do you want me to give you a hand breaking up with her?

535
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:49,039
Yeah, that'd be good,
actually.
