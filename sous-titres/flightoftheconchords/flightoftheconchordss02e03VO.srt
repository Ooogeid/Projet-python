<i>Okay, band meeting.</i>

12
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:08,908
- Uh, well, Jemaine?
- Present.

13
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:10,509
Who else have
we got here? Bret?

14
00:01:10,577 --> 00:01:12,211
- Yup.
- And who else?

15
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:16,048
Mu... mur Ray. Oh.

16
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:20,453
Greg's written this. He's
put the rs too far apart.

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,555
It's "Murray."
Murray, present.

18
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:26,325
Okay, item one:
Texas, Lexus...

19
00:01:26,393 --> 00:01:29,295
two rhyming words. Do you
think you could use those?

20
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:31,263
- No.
- Maybe.

21
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:32,631
"Maybe" from Bret.

22
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:36,168
Item two: Manager's notes
from yesterday's gig.

23
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:37,636
Right, here we are.

24
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:41,674
"A good gig.
Very enjoyable."

25
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,843
Oh, several complaints
about the noise.

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,745
You've got to remember
this is in a library, guys.

27
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:48,247
- Bear that in mind.
- But it's so hard to play there,

28
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:50,116
because everyone
wants us to be quiet.

29
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:51,884
- They're shushing us constantly.
- They're trying to read.

30
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:54,787
We might as well not be there if
we're not gonna make any sound.

31
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:58,724
You can make sound, just make
it so that people can't hear you.

32
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:01,994
Okay. Oh, I've got
another note here...

33
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:04,397
"dissing." I don't know what that means.

34
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:06,632
Does that make
any sense to you?

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,670
- Jemaine.
- Bret dissed a lot of people in that rap that he did.

36
00:02:10,737 --> 00:02:12,905
Right.
In the song, yeah.

37
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:15,775
Dissing, bad-mouthing. Who are
those guys that you were dissing?

38
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:18,577
The only one I could make out was
snoopy. What's your problem with him?

39
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:20,546
- No, it was Snoop dogg.
- I know he's a dog, Bret.

40
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,616
I'm not totally in the dark
ages. I do go out once in a while.

41
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,419
- He's lovable. Leave him alone.
- No, he's a rapper.

42
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:28,454
They're all rappers. I was
just dissing other rappers.

43
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:31,157
Just keep your dissing
private, all right?

44
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:34,026
I keep mine private.
I mean, I diss greg sometimes,

45
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:36,062
but I keep it private.

46
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:39,265
You didn't hear that,
did you, greg?

47
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:41,300
<i>Yes, Murray, I heard.</i>

48
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:44,804
You're only supposed to hear
when I have the button down.

49
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:46,939
<i>- Can you hear that?
- It is broken, Murray.</i>

50
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:51,310
Broken? How long
have you been hearing me?

51
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:53,646
<i>All year.</i>

52
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,282
Can we get that fixed,
greg, please?

53
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,752
<i>- Yes, I'll look into it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?</i>

54
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,390
What's wrong with that guy?

55
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,025
Useless. What does
he do all day?

56
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:07,793
You didn't hear that,
did you, greg?

57
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:11,497
Good, so he didn't hear that last
bit. That's how you diss someone.

58
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:15,034
Did you see what I did there? I
didn't start a fight with greg,

59
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:18,471
I didn't hurt his feelings.
Greg's got feelings.

60
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:20,539
Have you thought about these
rappers that you'rdissing?

61
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:22,575
- You might hurt their feelings.
- Jemaine's right.

62
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:25,111
You might hurt their
feelings, all right?

63
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:26,912

ever had hurt feelings?

94
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,943
¶ I call my friends,
say, "let's go into town" ¶

95
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:06,112
¶ but they're all too busy
to go into town ¶

96
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:08,447

111
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:52,091
yes, well,
all good examples.

112
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,627
- Can we go now?
- But my point is:

113
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:56,462
Just be careful around
rappers, all right?

114
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,997
You hurt their feelings
and kaboom...

115
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:00,132
they'll hurt you more
than your feelings...

116
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,734
they'll hurt your pretty
little brain, Bret.

117
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:04,270
It'll be gone, then
you'll have no feelings.

118
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:06,172
- How would you like that?
- Well, I wouldn't like that.

119
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:08,240
No, none of us would.
Okay, point made.

120
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:10,609
End of meeting. Scram.

121
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:13,179
Here in the united states,
rivalries between rappers

122
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:16,048
usually result
in death or worse.

123
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:18,017
- Death?
- Yeah, or worse.

124
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:20,686
Isn't it the same way with
rappers back in newfoundland?

125
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,321
- I'm not sure.
- New zealand.

126
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:25,391
Yeah, Jemaine and I, we're the
only rappers apart from Steve,

127
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,126
but he's...
he's a lovely guy.

128
00:06:27,194 --> 00:06:29,795
- He's very friendly.
- Which rappers did you diss, Bret?

129
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:32,965
I just dissed all the
rappers I could think of.

130
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:36,202
Oh shit. You want
to be careful, Bret.

131
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,472
I heard of one rapper... he
chopped this guy's whole body off,

132
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,307
just left
the dick behind.

133
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,043
Don't you mean they...
they chopped off his dick?

134
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:47,179
No, I mean they held his dick
and chopped his whole body off.

135
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:50,082
That's all he was
in the end... a dick.

136
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,627
Um, johnnyboy,

137
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:03,863
thanks for applying
to be in my gang.

138
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,699
Do you have
any gang experience?

139
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:09,635
Do I have gang experience?
I was in the snake eyes,

140
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:11,837
the duckies,
the cuckoos,

141
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:14,473
the vampires, the pharaohs,
the ballroom dancers,

142
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,910
the hobo lords,
the little enchanters, the...

143
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:20,246
I was a navy seal
for 15 years.

144
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:22,648
- Okay.
- I'm officially awol,

145
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:25,685
so don't ask them about my
existence, 'cause they'll deny it.

146
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:28,020
- Oh, no, I wouldn't.
- Yeah, and next thing you know,

147
00:07:28,088 --> 00:07:29,655
it's "goodbye, Dave,"
isn't it?

148
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:33,492
- Yeah, I won't tell anyone.
- I'd appreciate that, Bret.

149
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,896
So, Mr. And Mrs. Li, why do
you want to be in my gang?

150
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,231
We run the internet
cafe downstairs.

151
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,233
Vandals graffiti
our store window.

152
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:43,135
We want to stop them.

153
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:50,910
He says you have
a kind face.

154
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:52,378
Dave, do you have
any special skills?

155
00:07:52,412 --> 00:07:54,680
I can make a weapon out
of pretty much anything

156
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:57,083
that's lying around.
Like when I'm gardening,

157
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,618
some a-hole tries
to sneak up and take me out...

158
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,787
watering can tied
to a hose.

159
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:03,289
Pop!

160
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:06,325
Cops show up,
"what's that, officer?

161
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:09,795
No, just watering
the geraniums."

162
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,164
And in '54 I joined
the monkey lords.

163
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:14,300
After that, the rockers,

164
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,635
the gentleman jims,
the tsars,

165
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:19,638
the stars, the might
midgets from Queens.

166
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:22,041
So you've had a lot of
gang experience, basically.

167
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:24,410
They're all gangs,
big daddy!

168
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,453
- Going down, mate?
- Yes, thanks.

169
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:36,622
- Are you a kiwi?
- Yes, hello.

170
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,557
I'm Murray hewitt
from the new zealand consulate.

171
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,527
- Oh no. A kiwi?
- Oh no.

172
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,796
- Uh-oh.
Australian. Uh-oh.

173
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:47,867
- Australians, eh?
- We're just kidding, mate.

174
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:49,835
- We're from the Australian consulate.
- Oh, really?

175
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,304
How are new zealand's
mineral exports, Murray?

176
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,507
I don't actually know.
It's not my department.

177
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:57,076
Ah. Is that them
there in your briefcase?

178
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,645
- No.
- Not in your pocket, mate?

179
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:01,447
Oh.

180
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:03,449
Murray, I think
you dropped

181
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:05,985
new zealand's mineral
exports for '08-'09.

182
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:09,088
Yeah. Oh yeah.

183
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:11,290
- No, we're just having a laugh, mate.
- Just pulling your tit.

184
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:15,061
Yeah, just pulling your boob.
It's nice to meet you, mate.

185
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:17,063
- We should have a beer sometime.
- Yeah, okay.

186
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,664
That would be great.

187
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:33,045
<i>Okay, guys, there
are gangsters out there</i>

188
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:35,114
that have got
a major beef with me,

189
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:37,049
so I want
a defense schedule.

190
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:40,119
I need to know what times
we're available. Mrs. Li?

191
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:43,155
We can do lunchtimes
and after 7:00.

192
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:45,291
Otherwise,
we're busy in the shop.

193
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:49,161
- Okay. Dave?
- I'm available most days after 6:00

194
00:09:49,229 --> 00:09:51,964
but not weekends...
and I can't say why.

195
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:53,933
Dinner with your parents?

196
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:56,135
Huh! No.

197
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:57,870
I'm available
all the time,

198
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:00,506
but I like to go
to bed by 8:00 at night

199
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:02,775
so I can build up
my zs for the next day.

200
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:04,844
<i>Otherwise
I get real tired.</i>

201
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,879
Oh, and I got
to take toilet breaks.

202
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:09,181
I have a bladder thing.

203
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:12,318
Does anyone else have anything
like that they want to add?

204
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:15,688
Yeah, if anyone wants me to make
them a pair of these bad boys,

205
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:17,690
I'll need
about a week's notice.

206
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,728
- Cup of tea?
- Yes.

207
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,764
- Yep.
- I'd better not.

208
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:27,400
Oh yeah. Okay.

209
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:30,069
Jemaine. Jemaine!

210
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:31,937
Jemaine, hi.

211
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:33,806
- Hey.
- I have something for you. It's fan art.

212
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:36,909
Stop the car, Doug!
We're here.

213
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:39,645
Hold on one second, okay?
It's in the trunk.

214
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:43,015
- Hi, Doug.
- Hey, Jemaine. Where's Bret?

215
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,852
- He's in a gang.
- Wow. Are you in it?

216
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,789
- I don't need to be in a gang.
- Here you go.

217
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,290
Oh.

218
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:54,894
<i>What is it?</i>

219
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,329
You don't like it.

220
00:10:57,397 --> 00:10:59,231
I do.

221
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:02,001
No, you don't. You practically
admitted that you don't like it.

222
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:04,570
- I... did I?
- Oh my God.

223
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:06,872
- You don't like it at all.
- No, I I... I like it.

224
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,408
- Do you?
- Yes.

225
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:11,711
You love it! I can't
believe he loves it!

226
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:14,680
Oh God, you should
hang it on your wall

227
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:17,616
so you can see how strong
and powerful you are,

228
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:20,186
like the God ra...
the sun God ra...

229
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:23,823
- or like a pharaoh.
- I'm not as muscley as that.

230
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:26,058
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- Be quiet, Doug.

231
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:28,828
- Be quiet, Doug.
- Doug offered to pose, but...

232
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:32,031
it's not the same.

233
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:35,101
Anyways, I made one of Bret,
but it came out a little weird,

234
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:37,636
- so don't tell him, okay?
- O... okay.

235
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:40,206
It came out x-rated,
actually...

236
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:44,310
some shadowing on the crotch
got out of hand, but...

237
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:50,516
- got it?
- Got it.

238
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,827
- Bret! Bret! Bret!
- We got him good!

239
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:05,031
False alarm. It's Jemaine.

240
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:08,267
- It's my flatmate. Sorry, mate.
- Can attack!

241
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:11,971
Oh shit.
Sorry, man.

242
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,541
I couldn't see what was going
on from around the corner.

243
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,977
<i>- Hey, Dave.
- Hey, sorry, Jemaine.</i>

244
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:21,113
We were just expecting missy Elliot
was gonna come and chop my body off.

245
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:23,549
This is johnnyboy, Mrs. Li.
This is Jemaine.

246
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,452
- Hey.
- Let's go back to combat positions.

247
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,156
Good one, Dave.
How was your day?

248
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:31,791
Oh, good,
thanks. Yeah.

249
00:12:33,193 --> 00:12:36,095
- How was your day?
- Uh, it was good.

250
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:37,897
I've been in the ceiling
most of the day.

251
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:40,499
Bret, is your gang
gonna be here all day?

252
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:43,536
Yeah. Why?

253
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:45,471
Well, I don't think
there's a real threat.

254
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:47,239
Could you put that
in there, please?

255
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:55,147
Right. Bret, what's this I hear from one
of the band about you starting up a gang?

256
00:12:55,215 --> 00:12:57,917
- You told me to start up a gang.
- I said rappers have gangs

257
00:12:58,018 --> 00:12:59,185
and you shouldn't
hassle rappers.

258
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:00,586
No, you said
rappers have gangs,

259
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,021
so I should start a gang.

260
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,255
Typical...
you didn't listen.

261
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:05,524
And what's this I also hear
from the same source

262
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:08,694
that your gang
assaulted Jemaine here

263
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:11,664
in a surprise attack?
What were you doing?

264
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,600
Is this some sort of initiation
for Jemaine into the ganit

265
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,302
- no, I'm not in a surpr in the gang. What were
- no. Doing?

266
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:17,870
Why aren't you
in the gang?

267
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:20,006
He didn't even ask me
to be in the gang.

268
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:22,041
It's got to stop.

269
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:23,609
This gang
is disbandoned.

270
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,112
- No. Dis... what?
- Disbandoned.

271
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:28,147
- Disbanded you mean?
- Abandoned?

272
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:30,082
Yup, all of those things.

273
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,484
- It's gone.
- No. No.

274
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:33,452
- Yes. Yes.
- No. No!

275
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,054
- Yes!
- No.

276
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:36,722
- How about yes?
- How about no?

277
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,657
- Well, I'd rather you say yes.
- No.

278
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,992
- Yes.
- Uh, Murray?

279
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:42,461
Not now. I'm just in
the middle of a debate, greg.

280
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,230
- Yes!
- No!

281
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:46,132
Oh, greg, is this
about the intercom?

282
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:49,669
No, the Australian consulate
is hosting drinks on Thursday.

283
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:52,505
- We've all been asked to attend.
- Oh.

284
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:55,641
I don't really want to go
to that. Do I have to go?

285
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,445
- I think so, Murray.
- Can I have a "plus two"?

286
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,113
I don't know.
I'll ask.

287
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:03,549
- Thanks, greg.
- No problem, Murray.

288
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:05,818
That would be good.

289
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:06,819
Nice guy,
isn't he... greg?

290
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,387
- Yeah, he is.
- He's cool.

291
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:11,290
Now, Bret, the reason I'm
coming down on you so hard

292
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:15,261
on the gang situation is... I don't
want you to think ess of me here,

293
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:19,498
but I actually
used to be in a gang.

294
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,600
- That's right.
- You did?

295
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:23,502
- Yes.
- Who was in your gang, you and your mom?

296
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,638
No, Jemaine. It was me,
my brother graeme,

297
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:28,107
and my dad Gordon. Mom
wasn't even allowed in it.

298
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:30,810
- No one knew why.
- So what did you do in your gang?

299
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:34,013
Well, we were a bikey gang. We
used to ride around on our bikes.

300
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,881
Dad was the leader,

301
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:37,950
graeme found nice places
for us to ride to

302
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:40,353
and I was the guy
that looked after the bags.

303
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,090
Murray, is there anything
band-related in today's meeting?

304
00:14:44,157 --> 00:14:47,526
Yes, there is, actually, but I
haven't finished my gang stories.

305
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:49,595
I'm gonna just head off...
I've got gang practice.

306
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:52,131
Gang pr... wait.

307
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:56,635
Bret... Murray, curry.
Any use to you?

308
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,508
Jemaine!
Hey. Hi.

309
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:05,711
- Hey, Mel.
- I was just walking past your place

310
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,014
and I noticed that the
fan art I painted for you

311
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:10,649
was out on the stoop
near the garbage.

312
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:13,285
- What?
- Oh, what?

313
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:16,088
If you don't like it, Jemaine,
I'd prefer if you told me.

314
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:17,957
You don't like it,
do you?

315
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:21,060
- I... I like it. - okay, all
right, I'll just take it away.

316
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,095
I know what it feels
like to not be wanted.

317
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:26,132
- Mel, I had to throw it away!
- Why?

318
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,001
Because Bret was jealous.

319
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:30,936
Really?

320
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:32,838
Was he going apeshit?

321
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:34,807
He went apeshit.

322
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,842
I swear on Doug's life
I will fix this rift.

323
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,413
I'm gonna take this with me.
I'll be right back.

324
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:48,587
Just... Jemaine,
stay close.

325
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:50,589
I am close.
You're too close now.

326
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:52,558
No, but... closer. Put
your feet next to mine

327
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:55,995
that's it. We're together, all right?

328
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:58,731
Okay. You said there was
gonna be cheese.

329
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,633
You said there was
gonna be free cheese.

330
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:03,035
There will be cheese.
Over there. Iook.

331
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:05,237
Right, let's go and get
some cheese together, okay?

332
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:08,207
All right, go.

333
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:09,842
- No, you're too close.
- No, that's good.

334
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,177
Too close.

335
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:21,253
- Oh, no.
- Oh, the mighty Murray.

336
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:23,723
Good to see you. Who's
this, Murray... your wife?

337
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,625
No, his wife...
his wife left him.

338
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,961
Jemaine!

339
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,796
Is this your girlfriend
then, is it, Murray?

340
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:33,399
Huh. No, I'm just
his plus one.

341
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:35,835
Oh. No, wait,
I know who it is.

342
00:16:35,902 --> 00:16:39,372
Miss new zealand... best looking
Sheila in the whole country.

343
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:42,141
- Sorry, I didn't
recognize you

344
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,043
without the crown
and sash.

345
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:46,479
- Catch you later.
- Ah.

346
00:16:46,513 --> 00:16:48,581
Who are those guys?

347
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:51,884
Idiots.
Official idiots, Jemaine.

348
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:54,353
Let's just get all their cheese
and grapes and get out of here.

349
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:56,756
No, I don't have to put up
with this sort of behavior.

350
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:58,657
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna take it to the top.

351
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:00,092
- No, don't.
- I'm taking it to the top.

352
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,028
Don't take it
to the top.

353
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,631
- Excuse me.
- Yes? Hello.

354
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,534
Ambassador,
I'm Murray hewitt

355
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:11,037
from the new zealand consulate.
I'd like to complain

356
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:13,606
about three of your staff
members and their behavior.

357
00:17:13,674 --> 00:17:15,708
Oh, sorry about that.

358
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:18,678
You should know that I take
these things very seriously.

359
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:21,814
Okay, good. Three of your
staff members have been

360
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:24,583
insulting me and my country
over the last few days.

361
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:27,253
Oh, what exactly
have they been saying?

362
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,288
Well, a number of things,

363
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:30,690
but most recently they've
been implying my friend here

364
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:33,125
- was miss new zealand.
- I'm not.

365
00:17:33,193 --> 00:17:35,161
- He's a man.
- Is that true?

366
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:39,365
- Yes, I'm a man.
- Well, look, I'm really sorry about that.

367
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:42,702
But I thought flossy the sheep
won miss new zealand every year.

368
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:47,973
Just joking, Murray.
Just joking.

369
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:51,110
Greg, what are
you laughing for?

370
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:03,155
¶ I've got hurt feelings ¶

371
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:07,426
¶ I've got
hurt feelings ¶

372
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:17,403
¶ I've got hurt feelings ¶

373
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:22,375
¶ I've got

374
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:24,343
Mel, I could pose
for you.

375
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:26,879
Oh, no thanks.

376
00:18:26,913 --> 00:18:31,784
¶ I've got hurt feelings ¶

377
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:36,389

378
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:46,032

381
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:58,544
¶ have you ever been made fun of
because of where you were from? ¶

382
00:18:58,612 --> 00:19:02,114

over the intercom? ¶

383
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:05,618

you've given thrown away? ¶

384

387
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:22,635
come on, Jemaine.
Let's go home.

388
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:28,908
Thanks for bringing me
to the party, Murray.

389
00:19:28,975 --> 00:19:31,911
That's all right.
Good cheese, wasn't it?

390
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,048
- What are we doing here?
- Just stay sharp, man.

391
00:19:36,116 --> 00:19:37,950
- Stay sharp.
- What am I looking for?

392
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:40,820
We're looking for,
basically, all rappers.

393
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:43,522
- All of them?
- Yup, just... you know,

394
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,060
- mos def, all the guys.
- Mos def, the guy from "law & order: SUV"?

395
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,330
No, that's ice cube,
but keep an eye out for him.

396
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:53,766
No no, ice cube was in "are we
there yet?" and "are we done yet?"

397
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:55,901
- No.
- Yeah, he was.

398
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:59,005
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, you're probably talking about method man

399
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:02,074
- from "meet the spartans."
- Who was he in "meet the spartans"?

400
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:04,577
- He was the persian emissary.
- No, not him.

401
00:20:04,644 --> 00:20:07,747
- Snoop dogg... that's gotta
be it. - What was he in?

402
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:10,916
Just about everything.
He's in "starsky & hutch."

403
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:13,919
He was in "soul plane,"
"racing stripes"...

404
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:15,721
he was the voice
of lightning the racehorse.

405
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:18,591
- Yeah yeah yeah.
- Yeah, you don't want him on your ass.

406
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:21,227
<i>Hey!</i>

407
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:24,196

409
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:36,642
- Oh no.
- Oh, let's go the other way.

410
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,778
<i>- Let's go the other way.
- No, Jemaine, no.</i>

411
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:41,247
No, let's keep walking.

412
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:45,918
Well, on behalf
of the tough brets,

413
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:47,987
I'd like you

414

415
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,758

Pow.

445
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:43,536
So you should respect
oth people's property.

446
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:45,338
- Ah! Yeah.
- Ow!

447
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,406
- Bret, you just kicked a kid!
- Sorry.

448
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:48,841
You could get
10 years for that.

449
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:50,543
That's it,
we've got to blow, man.

450
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,744
Let's haul ass fast.

451
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:53,779
I know a place we can
hide till this blows over.

452
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:55,848
- Come on. You dig?
- I think so.

453
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,953
What the hell?

454
00:23:01,021 --> 00:23:03,989
When did
this thing go up?

455
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:06,192
Where's the dapper dukes'
hideout? It was right here.

456
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:09,929
You know, we laid low for three
straight months back in '58.

457
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:12,331
Johnny, I think they've
probably all retired by now.

458
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:15,735
Where'd they go?

459
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:20,673
Come on, Johnny,
let's... let's go.

460
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:22,641
It's getting dark.
We should probably head off.

461
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,610
Maybe you're right, lil Louie.
I'm getting old.

462
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:26,712
This game ain't no good
for me no more.

463
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,515
I'm sorry, Louie.
I'm out.

464
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:32,551
So long, lil Louie.

465
00:23:34,254 --> 00:23:35,654
So have you thought
about who's gonna

466
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:37,957
take johnnyboy's place
as the second in command?

467
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:42,194
<i>- Hey.
- Where the rest of your gang?</i>

468
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:44,630
<i>- Uh...
- what's that doing here?</i>

469
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:46,165
<i>I found that on
the steps downstairs.</i>

470
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:48,200
I thought
you painted it.

471
00:23:48,235 --> 00:23:51,437
Oh my... ugh.
Oh my God.

472
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:54,073
Yeah, it's a pretty
weird one.

473
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,511
How come
I'm wearing gumboots?

474
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:02,915
Hey, Jemaine.

475
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,484
- Hello.
- Hey, Mel.

476
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:07,319
So you saw my painting.

477
00:24:07,387 --> 00:24:10,456
Bret loves it. I saw him bring
it up a couple of hours ago.

478
00:24:10,524 --> 00:24:12,224
Is everything cool
between you two?

479
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,993
Yeah, it's all better now.
Thank you.

480
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:17,396
Great. What are
you doing with it?

481
00:24:17,464 --> 00:24:21,767
Uh, just showing everyone
in the neighborhood.

482
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:23,602
Well, I'd love
to come with you.

483
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:25,571
- Oh.
- Yeah yeah,

484
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:27,840
let's walk it around
and get people's reactions.

485
00:24:27,908 --> 00:24:29,975
- Uh...
- I'm proud of it too.

486
00:24:31,378 --> 00:24:34,380
Big art opening... around
the block. Come on.

487
00:24:34,448 --> 00:24:37,516
<i>Shit.</i>

488
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:41,187
- Who is it?
- It's the police.

489
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:42,922
Iook, if my mom...

490
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:44,924
I'm not going back to
the big house, all right?

491
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:47,426
I'm out of here.
Stall 'em.

492
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:52,665
- Hello.
- Sir, we've got a report

493
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:55,234
of a kid being kicked on the
street by a group of adults.

494
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:57,570
Oh, yes.
That was me.

495
00:24:57,604 --> 00:24:59,205
They said it was
a group of adults.

496
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:01,807
Um, that was my gang.

497
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:04,443
<i>- Okay, so why'd
you kick the boy?</i>

498
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:08,080
<i>- Well, I guess that
was gang-related.</i>

499
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:10,149
Well, in the future, I suggest
you don't kick children.

500
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:12,151
- Mm-hmm. - we'll let this
go because we don't like

501
00:25:12,252 --> 00:25:13,953
that particular kid, but
we've got our eyes on you.

502
00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:15,354
Okay, officer.

503
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:17,289
Thank you.

504
00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:20,960
Whew!

505
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:24,130
Dave, they've gone.

506
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:27,600
Dave?

507
00:25:30,704 --> 00:25:33,673
See, Bret? This is what
happens when you start rapping.

508
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,042
<i>- Good one. Iook at what
you've done to David.</i>

509
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:38,144
Bret, I want out...
I want out of the gang.

510
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:41,247
Johnnyboy's gone,
Mr. And Mrs. Li are gone.

511
00:25:41,314 --> 00:25:43,849
- Where have they gone?
- They've gone to taiwan to visit their son phang.

512
00:25:43,884 --> 00:25:45,484
He just graduated
dental school.

513
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:47,520
- Dave... - it's
over, man! I'm out.

514
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:49,422
Without you, man,
I've got no one.

515
00:25:49,456 --> 00:25:51,090
Maybe there's someone else
who'll be in your gang.

516
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:53,559
- Someone whom you haven't asked.
- Who?

517
00:25:53,627 --> 00:25:55,194
Jemaine's talking
about Jemaine, Bret.

518
00:25:55,228 --> 00:25:56,896
You could've asked him...
or me... but you didn't.

519
00:25:56,997 --> 00:25:59,365
- You didn't ask us.
- Do you guys want to be in the gang?

520
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:01,834
- Yes!
- Yeah. I'd like to, yeah.

521
00:26:01,902 --> 00:26:04,236
Oh, that's cool.
Then there's four of us.

522
00:26:04,304 --> 00:26:07,373
No, there's three,
'cause I quit

523
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,909
and so should you.
And you, Jemaine,

524
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:11,577
if you know
what's good for you.

525
00:26:11,645 --> 00:26:15,648
Dave's right. Sorry, guys,
I'm out of the gang.

526
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:17,750
Well, if you're out
and you're out, then I'm out.

527
00:26:17,818 --> 00:26:19,352
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm out.

528
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:22,988
You're out as well?
Well, I'm not leaving.

529
00:26:23,056 --> 00:26:25,057
So that's it...
I'm in.

530
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,727
I'm the gang.
I'm the tough brets.

531
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:32,732
<i>- This is a painting
I did of Jemaine.</i>

532
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,402
As you can see, I pretty
much got the handsomeness.

533
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,637
That's Jemaine.

534
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:40,906
If you don't believe it,
he can take his shirt off

535
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,441
and you can
be sure about it.

536
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:44,143
Oh, hello.
This is my painting.

537
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:45,845
I did this painting.
This is Jemaine.

538
00:26:45,912 --> 00:26:47,546
This is him.
He's my muse.

539
00:26:47,614 --> 00:26:49,682
He is my muse
and my joy.

540
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,817
People don't
appreciate art, do they?

541
00:26:51,885 --> 00:26:53,853
Unbelievable.
