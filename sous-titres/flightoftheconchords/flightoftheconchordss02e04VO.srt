1
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:34,873
Item one:
"Slow songs."

2
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,209
I thought it would be a good idea if
you ended each gig with a slow song.

3
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,211
No. We don't really have
any slow songs.

4
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:43,114
So that's a clear "no"
from you, Bret.

5
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:46,685
Now, Jemaine, what if you were to
slow down some of your own bits?

6
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:48,887
'Cause you do different
songs than Bret, don't you?

7
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:52,057
- Hmm? - well, your
songs, they're a lot...

8
00:00:52,124 --> 00:00:54,759
no, they're the same songs,
they're just a different part.

9
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:57,295
- I play the bass.
- Okay, well, I'm not the musician, all right?

10
00:00:57,363 --> 00:00:59,230
You guys know what
you're talking about

11
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:01,232
I'm just the brains
behind this operation.

12
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,936
Murray, I was thinking we should
play some gigs in bigger venues.

13
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:07,706
There's no such thing
as a small venue, Bret,

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,574
only small bands.

15
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:12,243
The camper-van gig was too small,
'cause no one could get in there.

16
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:14,145
There was just that one
old man and his wife.

17
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:16,147
Whoa whoa whoa,
this was the camper-van gig

18
00:01:16,215 --> 00:01:18,883
that was sold out
if I'm correctly mistaken.

19
00:01:18,918 --> 00:01:21,086
How do you think
you get to be sold out?

20
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:22,854
It's the small venues...
that's the trick.

21
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:24,422
- Yeah, well... - it's a
trick. It's an old trick.

22
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:27,058
And no more raft gigs.

23
00:01:27,093 --> 00:01:29,961
- It sold out.
- Yes, it was another sold out gig,

24
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:32,297
- but we want to do bigger gigs.
- Okay, I get the picture.

25
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:35,266
"Friends."

26
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:37,802
Now we've known each other
for quite some time

27
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,270
in the professional realm,

28
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:41,639
I'd like to push things
forward in the friendship realm.

29
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:44,242
- What's the friendship realm?
- Well, you've heard of a realm?

30
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:46,111
- Mmm.
- Yeah?

31
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:47,579
- Yes.
- Well, this is like a friendship one.

32
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:49,447
A group of people
basically getting together

33
00:01:49,515 --> 00:01:51,216
calling
each other friends.

34
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,852
Iook at this.

35
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:57,422
Right. Okay.

36
00:01:57,456 --> 00:02:00,125
- What's this?
- It's a friendship graph.

37
00:02:00,192 --> 00:02:02,827
Okay, if you have a look
along here on the x-axis,

38
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:05,296
this represents
time passing

39
00:02:05,364 --> 00:02:07,432
and on the y-axis here,

40
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:09,801
this is the different
levels of friends, okay?

41
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,103
Starting up here
with "friends,"

42
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:14,739
"workmates,"
down to "colleagues,"

43
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:18,143
underneath that, "strangers"...which
is pretty much everyone I've noticed...

44
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,511
and then "enemies."

45
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:22,280
So basically you guys
are here..."workmates"...

46
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:25,116
and what I want is
to get you up here...

47
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:28,119
"friends" and above.
That's where Jim is.

48
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:30,855
- Who's Jim?
- Jim's my best friend.

49
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:33,458
- We've never heard of Jim.
- Well, if you guys were my friends,

50
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:36,061
you'd know who
my other friend was... Jim.

51
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:38,496
Murray, would you like to see
the new immigration report?

52
00:02:38,597 --> 00:02:42,133
- Greg, do you think of us as friends?
- I hope so, Murray.

53
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:44,502
We're not.
We're colleagues.

54
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,339
- I see.
- I'm your boss. Don't forget that.

55
00:02:47,406 --> 00:02:50,508
- Would you like the report, Murray?
- Uh, yes.

56
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:52,644
Now can you fax
that to me?

57
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:56,548
Okay.

58
00:02:56,582 --> 00:02:59,384
See, guys? I don't let
just anyone be my friend.

59
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:02,554
Greg's a good guy, but he's
in colleague status.

60
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:05,724
So I think the three
of us are ready to move on

61
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,226
and get to that next level.
What do you say, guys?

62
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:10,195
Uh, okay.

63
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:12,430
Jemaine,
friends possibilities?

64
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:14,766
- Okay, man.
- Yeah, man.

65
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:17,635
What's the time, man?
Aw, heck.

66
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:20,205
You guys had better go...
you'll be late for your gig.

67
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,478
¶ who likes
to rock the party? ¶

68
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:28,146
¶ I like
to rock the party ¶

69
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:29,848
¶ who likes
to rock the party? ¶

70
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:31,449
sounds good, guys.

71
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:33,418
Slow it down a bit.
These two are dancing.

72
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:37,288
Possible couple here...
dancing to this.

73
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,128
Well, you've lost
the audience.

74
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:44,829
Oh, it's the bottom floor.

75
00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:47,499
All right, see you
tomorrow, future friends.

76
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:54,739
Oh, there's Mel.
Go go go.

77
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:57,008
Hey! Hey, guys!

78
00:03:57,076 --> 00:03:59,377
Hey, Jemaine!
Hey, Bret!

79
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:02,647
I have some cookies
for you in my fanny pack.

80
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:04,249
Hmm?

81
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:07,085
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

82
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:10,522
Oh, look, this one must be
for Bret... that's Bret's...

83
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:13,525
- and here's Jemaine's.
- Yum.

84
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:16,728
Uh, I'm not sure I want
to eat my own face.

85
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:19,097
I almost did
on the way over here.

86
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:21,266
The lips are
very prominent.

87
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:23,735
Yeah. Yup.

88
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:27,572
I had a dream about
you guys last night.

89
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:30,542
Jemaine, you were a slave

90
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:32,377
striving towards freedom.

91
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:34,612
And Bret...

92
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,650
well, I just want
to thank you.

93
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:42,721
- Uh, you're welcome.
- I had no idea you were so flexible.

94
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:46,358
What do you think
it could mean?

95
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:48,626
Do you think that
it might be clairvoyance

96
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:51,796
and I can see into the
future when I sleep?

97
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:54,532
- Uh, we should... we should
get going. - Oh, yeah yeah yeah.

98
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:58,169
Wouldn't it be fantastic if the
world was more like your dreams?

99
00:04:58,237 --> 00:04:59,537
- No.
- Yeah.

100
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:00,805
Do you think so,
Jemaine?

101
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:03,742
Yeah, some...
some dreams.

102
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:06,211
¶ why can't the world ¶

103
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:09,748
¶ be more like

104
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:12,917
bye!

105
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,120
¶ it would be full ¶

106
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:19,290
¶ of all of my

¶ and suddenly
I can fly ¶

00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,466
¶ I'm a little bird

00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:31,302

¶ be more like

117

I agree.

118
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:51,790
¶ I won't tell my secrets

119
00:05:51,824 --> 00:05:53,758
¶ and then rescued by

- What?

133
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:51,216
We'd better go, Mel.

134
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,385
- Thanks for the cookie.
- Oh, yeah.

135
00:06:53,452 --> 00:06:55,720
- See you, Mel.
- Bye.

136
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:04,095
Well, this is fun,
isn't it, guys?

137
00:07:04,163 --> 00:07:06,297
- Yes.
- Bret?

138
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:09,200
- Present.
- No, you don't need to say "present."

139
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:13,271
- We're just friends.
- It's just a casual, relaxed atmosphere.

140
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,774
- Yeah.
- Okay, I see.

141
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:19,344
Forget about all the work formalities
we normally have when we're working.

142
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:21,846
Oh, I've got you
some lists.

143
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:25,450
Just some ideas for things
we could do as friends.

144
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:27,719
"Make a coffee."

145
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:30,722
"Complain about our days."

146
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,359
"Watch a dvd."

147
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:36,861
I've brought
"the world's fastest indian."

148
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:39,931
Oh, great.
Do you have it on dvd?

149
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:43,768
"Build a fort."

150
00:07:43,803 --> 00:07:45,704
- Build a fort?
- Yup.

151
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:47,639
And at the end here
I've got

152
00:07:47,707 --> 00:07:49,708
"express our emotions"
and "have a beer."

153
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:51,409
Well, that should be around
the other way, actually...

154
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:53,278
we'll have a beer then
we'll express the emotions.

155
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:54,479
Murray, we don't
even drink beer.

156
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:56,314
We don't talk
about our emotions.

157
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,616
Well, that's the sort
of stuff I do with Jim.

158
00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:01,986
- Who's Jim?
- Jim, my friend Jim.

159
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:04,055
- We're not Jim.
- No.

160
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:06,624
- No, you're not.
- What sort of things do you like to do?

161
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,061
Well, I like having
a bath, but...

162
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:11,529
well, we're not gonna
have a bath, Bret.

163
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:13,365
I know, but that's
something I like doing.

164
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:15,533
I like
to have a sleep.

165
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:19,637
All right. Well, I'll
put that on the list.

166
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:23,208
"Have a sleep."

167
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,943
Do you think
that's what you'll do?

168
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:27,312
Well, it's what
you like to do, is it?

169
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:30,582
So you came around here
to have a sleep?

170
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:33,018
Well, I'll probably choose some
of the other things beforehand.

171
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:35,320
That's last
on the list.

172
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:41,926
Bret, don't shine
the light in my eyes...

173
00:08:41,994 --> 00:08:43,361
you'll ruin
my night vision.

174
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,230
Murray,
this is childish.

175
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:47,165
What, you think
building a bivouac is childish?

176
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:49,834
- Yeah, I think so.
- This is what we used to do in the new zealand army.

177
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,536
Do you see children
in the army, Jemaine?

178
00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:54,372
- No, you don't.
- Well, actually you do, Bret, in some armies,

179
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,641
but not the good ones,
not the new zealand army.

180
00:08:56,676 --> 00:08:59,110
- Not by the time I got in there.
- Were you in the army?

181
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:01,880
Yeah. Remember I showed you
my new zealand army uniform...

182
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:03,515
the green t-shirt
and the green shorts?

183
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:05,316
Oh, I thought
that was your underwear.

184
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:07,919
No, all the new zealand army
soldiers wore them,

185
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:09,954
and we'd build
bivouacs like this

186
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:12,157
out of any sort of
resources that came to hand.

187
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:15,493
What, out of two brooms,
some blankets and the beds?

188
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,262
No, not beds.

189
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:19,664
It depends what
we had, you know, handy.

190
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:21,666
Sometimes when you're in the
Bush, you didn't have brooms.

191
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:23,601
You used twigs
and leaves.

192
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:25,937
You'd be in the Bush
for days on end,

193
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:27,739
relying on nothing
but your wits.

194
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,741
- Oh.
- And one time...

195
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,478
my whole platoon had
to drink their own urine.

196
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:37,015
- Oh, were you lost?
- No, we were drunk. It was a party game.

197
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,084
I didn't really like
that part of the army.

198
00:09:40,486 --> 00:09:43,221
- More tea, Jemaine?
- No thank you, Murray.

199
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:46,257
- I might go to bed.
- Oh, okay.

200
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:48,860
Well, I'm gonna go
to bed too then.

201
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:50,895
- See you, guys.
- Good night, Murray.

202
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,999
Bret, I feel like
you're my brother.

203
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:56,768
- And, Jemaine, you're our dad.
- Go to sleep, Murray.

204
00:09:56,836 --> 00:10:00,605
Good night, dad.
Good night, graeme.

205
00:10:03,342 --> 00:10:06,277
This is a definite move up
on the y-axis, guys.

206
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:47,552
Right, let's have
a look at the graph.

207
00:10:49,288 --> 00:10:51,222
Up we go.

208
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,393
Oh, guys,
we've done it.

209
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:58,563
- Really?
- We have reached the next level.

210
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:04,002
I think you're
ready to meet Jim.

211
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:08,506
- Who's Jim?
- Jim... my best friend.

212
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:10,508
Come on, we're on
the same level now.

213
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:14,446
Let's have a look at the
friend agenda... the afrienda.

214
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:19,050
There's a barbeque
at my place tonight.

215
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:22,020
Perfect. We hang out like friends,

216
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:24,489
like the friends
from that program "friends."

217
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:26,791
I could be chandler,
the funny one.

218
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:29,194
Jemaine, you could be
ross, the mopey one.

219
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:33,498
And Bret...
Joey, the naive one.

220
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:36,234
- Can I be chandler?
- No, I'm chandler.

221
00:11:36,302 --> 00:11:37,569
But I'm more
like chandler...

222
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:40,038
I say witty things.
I have witticisms.

223
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:41,906
- No, you don't. You're mopey.
- Yeah, I'm sarcastic.

224
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:43,808
I would just say
something sarcastic

225
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:46,077
and you'd not really notice,

226
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:49,414
but the people watching
will really appreciate it.

227
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:52,117
Jim knows me
as the chandler guy.

228
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,659
It's a pretty quiet
party, Murray.

229
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:03,695
It's only
just started, Jemaine.

230
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:04,996
Iook at Bret.
He's having a good time.

231
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:09,768
Hey, Bret,
you think it's rocking now,

232
00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:12,270
you wait till Jim gets here...
it's gonna be twice this.

233
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:16,074
- He's like a one-man party.
- Well, does he need us then?

234
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:18,777
Oh, yeah. Just to give you an example
of the sort of funny thing he does,

235
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:21,046
have a look out
the window here. Iook.

236
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:23,715
See that? Can you see
what they are?

237
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,316
Jemaine and I know
what they are, don't we?

238
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:27,686
- Americanized though.
- They're breasts.

239
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:30,121
- You see the breasts?
- Oh, I thought it was a monster...

240
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:32,123
- no no, they're breasts.
...with big ears.

241
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:33,658
No, it's a naked
woman's body.

242
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:35,694
Oh, definitely. As soon as
I saw it I thought, "yeah."

243
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:37,328
Oh, we should play
a joke on him.

244
00:12:37,363 --> 00:12:40,665
- Okay. Like what?
- You guys tell him

245
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,101
that I found you
in the Bush

246
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:44,502
and I brought you back
into the city...

247
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:46,104
I carried you back
individually.

248
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:47,439
What were we doing
in the Bush?

249
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:48,640
You were dropped
in there.

250
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,976
You were left by your...
your partners.

251
00:12:52,044 --> 00:12:55,280
- Girlfriends?
- Yeah, your girlfriends left you in the Bush.

252
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:59,250
You must've done something
wrong. You must've upset them.

253
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:03,355
- Seems far-fetched.
- Oh, he's gonna love it.

254
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,192
...three, four.

255
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:09,327
Hands off, Murray.

256
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:13,565
Oh, I should go get
something on for the barbeque.

257
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:15,133
Here he is!

258
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:17,335
And the fun begins.

259
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:20,672
- Incoming. Zing zing zing
- zing!

260
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,640
Jim, so here's
my new friends...

261
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,410
- just recently added.
- Pleasure to meet you two.

262
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:27,545
- Yeah.
- So, Bret, Jemaine, tell me about yourselves.

263
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,514
What sort of music do you guys like?

264
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:30,849
- Rock?
- Yeah.

265
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,150
- Funk?
- Yes.

266
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:33,485
- Country?
- Yeah.

267
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:35,120
- Hair band?
- Yes.

268
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:36,654
- Synth?
- Yeah.

269
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:37,889
- Blues?
- Yes.

270
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:39,090
- Jazz?
- Yes.

271
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:40,325
- Jazz fusion?
- Yeah.

272
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:41,693
- No.
- Cool.

273
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:43,762
So, Jemaine, what do you call
that style of haircut?

274
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:45,864
Bret cuts it.
Ask him.

275
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:49,567
- Bret?
- Oh, I just call that the "Jemaine."

276
00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:51,369
- You like sports, Jemaine?
- No.

277
00:13:51,437 --> 00:13:53,171
- Bret, sports fan?
- Not really.

278
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:55,840
- You work out, Bret?
- Yeah. Yeah, um...

279
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:59,678
I ride an exercycle and run up and down
the stairs in our apartment each day.

280
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:01,479
How many stairs in
your apartment, Jemaine?

281
00:14:01,547 --> 00:14:04,282
- 75.
- How many people have you met?

282
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,518
- How many people
have I met? - Mm-hmm.

283
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:08,720
- I don't know.
- What, in total?

284
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:10,955
- Yup.
- How many people have you met?

285
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,992
285,621.

286
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:17,262
Bret, do you read?

287
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:18,730
- Yeah.
- What do you read?

288
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:21,700
- I read the newspaper.
- Yeah.

289
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:23,702
Your favorite part of the
newspaper, Jemaine... what is it?

290
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:27,539
- What?
- Favorite part of the newspaper,

291
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,274
- what is it?
- Uh, pages?

292
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:31,109
- Nope.
- Uh, articles?

293
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,578
- Hm-mmm. - I don't really
have a favorite part...

294
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:35,880
Bret, you've got a favorite
part of the newspaper?

295
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:38,450
Um...

296
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:41,486
I like the stories about animals
when they've escaped from the zoo.

297
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,788
Cool. So you guys got any
questions you want to ask me?

298
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:47,125
- No.
- Okay, so I'll flip it back.

299
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:50,995
You guys ever grow a mustache?
You ever been stung by a porcupine?

300
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:57,602
- ¶ all the ladies
at the party ¶

301
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:02,007
¶ come on and shake
your boobies, yeah ¶

302
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,110
¶ who likes
to rock the party? ¶

303
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:09,080
¶ I like
to rock the party. ¶

304
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:11,049
thank you. We're flight of the conchords.

305
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:12,717
We're gonna
take a little break.

306
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:15,086
Feel free to go get a drink
or make yourselves at home,

307
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:17,355
get comfortable. We'll be
back in about 10 minutes.

308
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:23,428
Bret, I dreamt
about you again.

309
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:26,231
- Hmm?
- Actually, I'm kind of angry at you

310
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:28,700
for something you did
in my dream last night.

311
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:30,301
Yeah, you were
there too, Jemaine,

312
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:32,470
but you did
something very nice.

313
00:15:32,538 --> 00:15:34,873
- Ah. Hmm.
- Oh, that's nice.

314
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,043
But, Bret, I just...
I feel like...

315
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,779
it's silly, but you should
apologize for what you did.

316
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:43,081
- Apologize for what?
- What did he do?

317
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:50,055
Oh! Oh my God. What was
the nice thing that I did?

318
00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:57,095
- Oh! Ooh.
- Yeah.

319
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:00,131
- What did I do?
- I don't want to say, Bret,

320
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:02,367
but I think you should
probably apologize.

321
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:04,369
I'm not gonna apologize.
It was a dream.

322
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:07,272
- Well, actually, it seemed real, didn't it?
- It seemed like you.

323
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:09,407
- Did I apologize in your dream?
- No, you did not.

324
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:10,875
That's a shame. I should've
apologized in the dream.

325
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:13,845
You bastard.

326
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:16,948
- You bastard, Bret.
- Apologize.

327
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,685
I'm sorry.

328
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,054
- Okay.
- I should think so.

329
00:16:26,225 --> 00:16:28,460
Hey, Bret, Jemaine.

330
00:16:28,494 --> 00:16:30,328
It's your
new friend Jim.

331
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:32,330
I was just calling to see if you
guys wanted to go out tonight.

332
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:35,166
Give me a call.

333
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:37,102
- Should we call him?
- No.

334
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:39,237
- I think I should. It's polite.
- What for?

335
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:42,073
- He's our friend now.
- He's not our friend.

336
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:43,975
He's just a guy
who we met one time.

337
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,845
- I'll call him back.
- Oh, do... oh, please...

338
00:16:46,912 --> 00:16:48,980
I'll just call him back and tell
him that we're busy and stuff.

339
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:51,316
We are busy. Iook.

340
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,256
- Murray?
- Hi, Jim, it's Bret.

341
00:16:58,324 --> 00:17:00,525
- Oh, hey, Bret.
- How's it going?

342
00:17:00,593 --> 00:17:02,694
- Did you hear my message?
- Yeah.

343
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:05,096
- Yeah? When did you hear it?
- Just now.

344
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:07,532
Oh. What did you think
about my message?

345
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:11,369
Um, well, I... yeah,
I liked your message.

346
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:14,272
- It was good.
- Do you like the color light blue?

347
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,509
- Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Yeah?

348
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:20,512
So shall we get
together tonight?

349
00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:23,014
Um, yeah, well...

350
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:24,883
he's saying "shall we get
together sometime?"

351
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,751
- What should I say?
No. Say no.

352
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,754
Um... no.

353
00:17:29,822 --> 00:17:31,890
Oh, why not?

354
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:35,694
- Why not?
- Because he's a dick.

355
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:37,729
Because...

356
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:40,965
we're busy... just really
busy at the moment.

357
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:43,635
Did Jemaine
just call me a dick?

358
00:17:43,703 --> 00:17:46,371
Um... did you just
call him a dick?

359
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:49,240
- Yeah.
- Um, yes.

360
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:52,110
- Bret, don't tell him that!
- Well, you just told me to tell him!

361
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:54,713
Bret, I didn't say
to tell him he's a dick.

362
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,715
- Uh, are you still... are you still
there, Jim? - Yes, he is a dick.

363
00:17:56,816 --> 00:18:00,218
- Yeah, I'm still here.
- Sorry, that wa-

364
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:02,153
- am I on speakerphone?
- No, you' not. No, you're not,

365
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:04,522
- but... I got confused...
- abort the call.

366
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,958
...'cause I thought...
- that's all right.

367
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:09,761
I guess you don't want
to get together. Okay.

368
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:12,831
- Bye, Bret.
- Bye.

369
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:15,533
Well, he doesn't sound very happy
about you calling him a dick.

370
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,068
You... argh!

371
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:29,781
- Table's not really wide enough.
- What's going on?!

372
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,317
- Table tennis.
- Guys, this is no good.

373
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:34,919
I need my desk to work
on. This is my workspace.

374
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:37,022
It's not a rec center
for the misguided.

375
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,491
What if someone was to come
in now and see this mess?

376
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:41,192
Well, then we can
play doubles.

377
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,794
You're gonna
have to go away.

378
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:45,263
I thought we'd gone to the
next level... friends level.

379
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:47,966
Well, we are, Bret, but we
can't hang out all of the time,

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,368
not here at my work.

381
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:52,170
I'm afraid this is a drop
in the y-axis, Bret.

382
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:54,472
- A drop?
- Yeah.

383
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,442
Can you not put it on there? Just
'cause it's the table-tennis table.

384
00:18:57,476 --> 00:19:00,612
Right, we've dropped right down
to the bottom of friends now.

385
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:02,614
But we thought
you really liked us.

386
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:04,449
You can still work
on the desk.

387
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:06,985
You just have to
ignore us, I suppose.

388
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:10,422
Jemaine, please go away.
Go away, guys.

389
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:14,325
Oh, come on, guys.

390
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:16,494
Iook, I'll make it up
to you, all right?

391
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:19,731
We'll go orienteering
with Jim on Saturday.

392
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,701
- Oh. No, that's okay.
- Mmm.

393
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:25,403
- Friday?
- I'll see you later.

394
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:26,738
That's all right.
Let's just go.

395
00:19:26,806 --> 00:19:28,540
All right, I'll see you
tonight at tae kwan do.

396
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,141
- See you later, Murray.
- Don't forget.

397
00:19:35,147 --> 00:19:37,982
Murray, I forgot my jock
again. Do you got an extra one?

398
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:40,352
I've only got
one jock, Jim.

399
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:43,154
Oh, hey, guys.

400
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:45,590
- Welcome to my dojo.
- Hey, Murray.

401
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:48,059
- Look, our friend Jim is here.
- Hey, Jim.

402
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:50,195
Hey, Bret.
Hey, Jemaine.

403
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:52,197
- Oh, hello, guys.
- Oh, yes.

404
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:53,698
- Hey, Mel.
- Hi.

405
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:56,234
- Hey, Mel. - why...
what's Mel doing here?

406
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:59,137
I thought we could bring a
female element into our group

407
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:01,039
like they do
on that program "friends."

408
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:04,843
She could be like the kooky
female, you know... Phoebe, is it?

409
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:07,679
- Oh, yeah, she's great.
- Who would Jim be then?

410
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:09,647
You could be...
we'll, we've got ross.

411
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:11,483
- I'm ross.
- You're ross.

412
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,218
- You were gonna be Joey.
- I'll just stay as ross.

413
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,220
You'd have to be, um...

414
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:18,523
- Monica?
- Yeah.

415
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:21,426
- It's kind of weird, but... uh...
- cool.

416
00:20:21,494 --> 00:20:23,828
You know, I dreamt about you
again last night, Bret.

417
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:26,197
- It's good to have you here, Mel.
- You know, Murray,

418
00:20:26,265 --> 00:20:29,734
I would really love to
learn how to attack a man.

419
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:32,637
Unfortunately, tae kwon do
is more about self-defense.

420
00:20:32,672 --> 00:20:35,907
Okay, Jemaine, come at me
with all your might.

421
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,245
- Ah! Ah!
- Sorry, are you okay?

422
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:42,213
Mel!

423
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:44,249
Mel, stop it! Mel!

424
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:45,850
Oh, God,
I'm so sorry.

425
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:50,288
One two three four.

426
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:54,225
Ah. Ah.

427
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,433
- Come on, Jim.
- Hi, Jim.

428
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,868
- Hey, Jim.
- Hi.

429
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:09,407
Jemaine, did you call Jim a dick?

430
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:12,243
No. No, I didn't.

431
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:14,679
No. I would never
call Jim a dick.

432
00:21:14,747 --> 00:21:16,781
- He did.
- I knew it. You did.

433
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:19,284
Jim wouldn't tell me...
that's not in his nature...

434
00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:21,019
but I knew
something was wrong,

435
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:22,954
so I got him drunk and he told
me that you called him a dick.

436
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,558
Yeah. Well,
Bret confirmed it though.

437
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,594
- Yeah, I did.
- Is that true, Bret? You confirmed it?

438
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:32,163
- Uh, yes.
- I said it quietly on the phone

439
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:34,165
and Bret could've
just easily covered over

440
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:35,667
and said something
that rhymed with dick...

441
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:37,502
- like what?
...like a tick.

442
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,238
I can't believe it, Jemaine.
He's not a dick or a tick.

443
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:43,041
And, Bret, you can't
confirm that he's a dick.

444
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:44,342
You might as well
call me a dick.

445
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,777
I do call you
a dick sometimes.

446
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:47,312
- Same.
- I've called you a dick before.

447
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,813
All right, that's another
issue we need to discuss.

448
00:21:48,914 --> 00:21:50,548
- He has called you a dick.
- More to the point, guys,

449
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:52,851
Jim is a cool guy.
Aren't you, Jim?

450
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:56,087
- Yes.
- You're the dick in this scenario, Jemaine...

451
00:21:56,155 --> 00:21:57,622
- me?
...for calling Jim a dick. Yes.

452
00:21:57,656 --> 00:22:00,358
How does that feel, a taste
of your own dick medicine?

453
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:04,062
I just... you know, I wish
could all have got on.

454
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,698
Friends should be friends
of friends' friends.

455
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:09,200
I tried, Murray.
I called.

456
00:22:09,268 --> 00:22:12,771
- I asked questions.
- I hate to think how this is going to look on the chart.

457
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:14,639
Let's review it.

458
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:17,409
Okay, so this is, I guess,
where I gave you the bad review.

459
00:22:17,443 --> 00:22:19,010
And then...
Iook at this...

460
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:22,213
a really big drop because you
guys nearly got me the Sack.

461
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:25,216
- Yeah. Yeah. - that's
a big drop in the y-axis.

462
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:27,152
But we came
to visit you impromptu.

463
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:30,488
- Okay, that was kind of nice.
- And we made your office a games room.

464
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:33,024
- Was that nice? Was it?
- Yeah, we put in table tennis.

465
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,927
I don't think so, guys, because
you drilled holes in my desk.

466
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:39,330
- For putting the net up. - yeah well,
what about table- tennis nets with clamps?

467
00:22:39,365 --> 00:22:42,534
- Oh, the clamp ones.
- Yeah. So that's down again.

468
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:45,904
- And then Jemaine called me a
dick. - I called him a dick, so...

469
00:22:45,971 --> 00:22:47,739
right, that's true.
That's down again.

470
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:50,508
Oh, you're below colleagues.
You're below greg...

471
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:54,412
worse than when we started.
Strangers.

472
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,848
I don't even know
you guys anymore.

473
00:22:56,882 --> 00:22:58,550
So we're not
friends anymore?

474
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:01,720
No, Bret, not according
to the chart.

475
00:23:01,787 --> 00:23:03,588
How's my chart, Murray?

476
00:23:03,656 --> 00:23:05,223
Jim, there's your one.
Iook at that.

477
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,325
- Whoa!
- Really good, yeah.

478
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,061
- That's beautiful. Yeah
- friends as ever. Nice one.

479
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:11,830
Where do you buy
your markers?

480
00:23:11,897 --> 00:23:13,798
I just get them from stationery.

481
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:15,633
Oh, here we go.
Come on, let's go, Jim.

482
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:19,304
- Friend.
- See you, Murray.

483
00:23:19,372 --> 00:23:21,373
Oh! Uh, guys,

484
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:24,409
band meeting tomorrow,
so see you tomorrow...

485
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,778
- okay... but we'll
be... we'll be strangers,

486
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:28,346
so that'll be
uncomfortable.

487
00:23:28,414 --> 00:23:30,682
Just come and give
your names at the desk.

488
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,618
- We'll come in and introduce ourselves.
- I'm Murray hewitt, anyway.

489
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:35,987
- Good night, Murray.
- Good night, guys.

490
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:38,089
- Bye, Jim.
- See you, Jim.

491
00:23:38,157 --> 00:23:41,059
One two three four.

492
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:47,065
- Favorite sauce?
- Uh, any Brown sauce.

493
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:49,601
- You?
- Eh, still mayonnaise.

494
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:52,871
- Paper or plastic?
- I'm a paper man.
