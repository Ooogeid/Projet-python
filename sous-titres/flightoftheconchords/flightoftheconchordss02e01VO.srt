1
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,988
Okay, band meeting.

2
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,674
- Bret?
- Yes.

3
00:00:34,758 --> 00:00:36,709
- Jemaine?
- Also yes.

4
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:39,745
Murray? Present
of course. Right.

5
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:42,265
Oh, yes, item one:
Uh, oh, good news:

6
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:44,433
Your cds made
double platinum in America.

7
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:46,552
<i>- What? Are you serious? How'd that happen?
- Yup.</i>

8
00:00:46,637 --> 00:00:49,772
- No, it's the crazy dogggz.
- I thought we had sold five.

9
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:51,941
It's the crazy
dogggz, sorry.

10
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:54,393
- Wrong agenda.
- Ah. That's it. That's okay.

11
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:56,612
Here's your one.
Item two:

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,147
Now the library
you played,

13
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:00,266
They called me to say
that you stole a cushion.

14
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,068
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

15
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:05,071
- Yes.
- Guys, you can't steal cushions.

16
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:06,739
No, this is
a really nice cushion.

17
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:09,709
Return it, okay? I think,
you know, you'd feel bad

18
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:11,377
If you lived with that
for the rest of your life.

19
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:13,462
Every time someone came
around, "oh, nice cushion."

20
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,882
"Yeah." okay?

21
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:19,702
Item three: R Kelly wants
to sing on your next song.

22
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,754
- What? Are you serious?
- Yup, shall I find out who he is?

23
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:23,422
<i>- R Kelly?
- Mmm.</i>

24
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:25,324
Are you sure that's not
for the crazy dogggz?

25
00:01:25,392 --> 00:01:26,676
Yes, that's
the crazy dogggz.

26
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:29,428
Oh, it's the crazy
dogggz, sorry.

27
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:30,930
- Where's your agenda?
- Tell him, bret.

28
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:32,765
I mixed these up.
This is a mess.

29
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,902
- Crazy dogggz...
- "dear Murray,

30
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:38,054
We want to fire you
as our manager."

31
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:39,906
- What?
- What?

32
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,244
- What's your reasoning, bret?
- You spend all your time on the crazy dogggz

33
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:47,847
And you don't really spend
any time on us.

34
00:01:47,915 --> 00:01:51,500
Before you came to me, you
were poor and you had no gigs.

35
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:53,619
- Now look at you.
- We're poor and we've got no gigs.

36
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:55,922
- We're slightly poorer.
- Are you really?

37
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:57,623
Yeah, bret's only
got one shoe.

38
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:01,193
Oh, bret, is that what
this is about? One shoe?

39
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:02,878
- I can get you another shoe.
- No, it's not about the shoe.

40
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,797
- I just lost my shoe.
- Not a problem. What size are you?

41
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:07,300
- Size 9, but it's not about the shoe.
- Get you another shoe.

42
00:02:07,384 --> 00:02:09,552
- It's about...
- Your right foot. Yeah, hi. Murray here.

43
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:12,888
- I need a right-foot shoe.
- Murray, we're firing you.

44
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,391
We're gonna
manage ourselves.

45
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:18,694
Right. I understand it.
Okay, fine.

46
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:21,948
You know what? Actually, there's
another item here on the agenda

47
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:23,566
I missed out.
Oh yes, here it is.

48
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:25,318
Item four:
Stuff you.

49
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:26,986
Are you sure that's not
for the crazy dogggz?

50
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,938
Stuff you, jemaine,
and stuff you, bret.

51
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,574
And stuff you again,
jemaine.

52
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:33,392
Why did I get
double stuffed?

53
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,078
I don't need you guys.
You're unneeded, okay?

54
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,581
I've got the crazy dogggz.
They're making hit after hit.

55
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:41,500
"Doggy bounce," number one.
"Doggy dance," number five.

56
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:43,202
"In the pound,"
number 37.

57
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,204
<i>It's not gonna stop.
It's never gonna stop.</i>

58
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:48,891
They're a hit-making machine.
Look at their Gold records!

59
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,744
And just to let you know,
your wall... it's over there...

60
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:54,680
<i>They're fake.
I had to make them myself.</i>

61
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:56,165
<i>- What?
- They're pencil sharpeners stuck</i>

62
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:58,351
To a couple of bits of wood
to make you feel better.

63
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:00,653
<i>- We didn't win the grammys?
- No, you didn't.</i>

64
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:02,855
I thought we won
"best new zealand artists."

65
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:04,573
There's no such
category, jemaine.

66
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:07,393
What about your
"best management" award?

67
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:09,645
That's fake as well.

68
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:11,831
We're going, Murray.

69
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,034
Band meeting finished...

70
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:16,985
Forever.

71
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,457
Good luck without me,
you turkeys.

72
00:03:28,998 --> 00:03:31,667
¶ rejected ¶

73
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:34,937

¶ they didn't want me ¶

80
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,410
¶ unprotected ¶

81
00:03:57,494 --> 00:04:00,546
¶ like a baby
in the snow ¶

82
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,882
¶ ejected ¶

83
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:05,968
¶ like a clown
without a show ¶

84
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:08,504
¶ I objected ¶

85
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:10,990
¶ pretended
I was unaffected ¶

86
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:14,977
¶ but still
ended up rejected ¶

87
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:20,983
¶ like a cake shop

¶ disrespected... ¶

98
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,726
Murray?

99
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:05,478
One moment.

100
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:08,397
¶ and rejected. ¶

101
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:14,269
Yes, Glen?
What was that again?

102
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:17,105
There's a call for you
from poland... a lawyer.

103
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:19,992
He says he's been trying
to reach you all morning.

104
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,128
Please, tell him
I'm not there.

105
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:25,297
I'm not here either.
I'm not... not anywhere.

106
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:30,619
<i>¶ I did the hustle
last night ¶</i>

107
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,207
¶ dancing to a rock band,
a rock band, baby ¶

108
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:38,727
¶ I saw my uncle last night
dancing to a rock... ¶

109
00:05:38,795 --> 00:05:41,129
- These guys are pretty good.
- These guys?

110
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:44,466
They'll never hit the big
time. They're too devious.

111
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:46,418
The crowd
likes them all right.

112
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:49,605
Trust me, though,
they're devious. I know.

113
00:05:49,656 --> 00:05:53,809
¶ whoa, rock band. ¶

114
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:03,485
- Oh. Murray, what are you doing here?
- Hey, Murray.

115
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:05,538
I just thought I'd come and see
how you were doing without me.

116
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:07,673
Just to let you know,
there was a lot of things

117
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:09,175
I used to do behind
the scenes, all right?

118
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,943
Stuff that you guys
don't know about.

119
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:13,161
What, when we couldn't
see you?

120
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:15,047
<i>- Yeah.
- What would you be doing behind the scenes?</i>

121
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:16,916
- Having dinner?
- No, managing you guys.

122
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,517
- Going to the movies?
- Relaxing?

123
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:21,921
No. Photocopying.
Haggling.

124
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:23,272
- Haggling?
- Yup.

125
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,791
Um, higgling.

126
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:27,810
- Higgling?
- Yeah, do you know what that means?

127
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,396
- Is that a word that you just
made up? - It's made-up, yeah, but...

128
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:32,631
I thought tonight's gig went
really well. We had a big crowd.

129
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,350
- Unbelievable.
- That's unbelievable.

130
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:36,952
- Hello.
- Hi.

131
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,454
- Hi.
- I'm Martin Clark,

132
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:40,990
President and ceo
of great expectations,

133
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,459
One of the top agencies
here in new York.

134
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:45,494
I love what you guys do.
You're fantastic.

135
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:48,214
- I particularly like one of you.
- Oh, thank you.

136
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:50,499
- This is my colleague, caitlin goodman.
- Hey.

137
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,586
So we just came by your gig
tonight completely by accident

138
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,137
But it's the kind
of accident I like to be in.

139
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:57,706
We think you'd be perfect
to write a new jingle

140
00:06:57,757 --> 00:06:59,675
For a campaign
we're doing.

141
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:01,994
Oh, we don't use our
music to sell products.

142
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:03,512
Mmm.

143
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:05,547
This could make you so rich
you'll be shitting money.

144
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,100
Literally if you wanted.

145
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:10,486
- Hmm.
- We might have to have a meeting about this.

146
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:12,571
Yeah, let's have
an emergency band meeting.

147
00:07:12,656 --> 00:07:14,857
- No, please, go on. Shoot.
- No, please. Go ahead.

148
00:07:14,908 --> 00:07:17,192
Don't listen.

149
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:19,662
Okay, emergency
band meeting.

150
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:21,914
- Jemaine? Bret?
- Yes. Yes.

151
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:24,116
Present. Item one:
Band merchandise.

152
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,535
I've done the t-shirt.
This is it.

153
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:28,754
- What, that's it? - Yes, this
is the monogrammed t-shirt.

154
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:31,040
- Well, what's... - I've written
"flight of the conchords"

155
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:33,408
- In tiny letters in pen.
- Oh, that's good. That's good.

156
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,794
But we can't sell it tonight
'cause I'm wearing it.

157
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,246
- Yeah, I have to wear it.
- I've made the dolls.

158
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:40,382
- Yeah? Oh, nice, man.
- There's your doll

159
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:42,468
- And my doll.
- Oh, that's great.

160
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:45,487
- How'd you get the jacket so realistic?
- Yeah, that's real denim.

161
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:46,972
And I just want to get
some of your hair...

162
00:07:47,057 --> 00:07:48,691
Item two,
item two, item two:

163
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:50,425
- The jingle.
- Item two: Oh, yeah, the jingle.

164
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:52,611
I think it sounds like
a good opportunity.

165
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:54,563
Let's do it.

166
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:01,136
We've decided we'd like
to do the jingle, please.

167
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:02,655
- Hey, that's terrific.
- Great.

168
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:05,574
<i>- Yes, please.
- It's for a new organic toothpaste</i>

169
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,160
- For women only.
- For women?

170
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:10,963
- Women only.
- Not many people know this,

171
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:13,582
But women have very different
dental needs from men.

172
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:16,001
- We do.
- Could I try some?

173
00:08:16,086 --> 00:08:19,287
Um, I don't think so.
It's really for women only.

174
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:21,256
What I want you to do
is think about it,

175
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:23,392
Because when I saw
you guys tonight,

176
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,060
I thought,
"here's two men

177
00:08:25,128 --> 00:08:27,463
Who know exactly
what women feel like."

178
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,598
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

179
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:32,467
Great. All right, here. Email me, okay?

180
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,188
Martinóclark@aol.Com.

181
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:39,408
Underscore is
your middle name, is it?

182
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,977
Why don't you just
come down to the office?

183
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:43,612
The address is
right there on the card

184
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:45,597
And I need a demo by the
end of the week. Cool?

185
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:48,534
- Yes.
- Impossible. Oh. Yes.

186
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,874
What do women like?

187
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,576
Men?

188
00:08:57,644 --> 00:09:00,746
- Some of them do.
- Yeah.

189
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:03,799
¶ some women like men ¶

190
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,118
¶ some are lesbian ¶

191
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:09,171
¶ femident toothpaste. ¶

192
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,841
It's...
there's almost half.

193
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:16,445
- That's half of it.
- Women love weaving. They love to weave.

194
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:19,181
Nah. Weaving is
a man's game.

195
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:21,200
Bret...

196
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:24,686
You put a woman in front
of a weaving machine

197
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,405
And just watch her go.

198
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:28,407
No, honestly,
my dad weaves.

199
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:31,794
- My grandfather was a weaver.
- I thought your dad was a sheep lawyer.

200
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:34,830
Yeah, during the day,
but at night he weaves a lot.

201
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:37,366
I come from a family
of weavers.

202
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:39,885
- I've never seen a man weave.
- I love weaving.

203
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:44,123
I'm weaving at the moment,
making a pair of trousers.

204
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,809
- Women's rights.
- No, that's more of a man's thing, isn't it?

205
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:50,896
- Sorry about... - um, no,
definitely a woman's thing.

206
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,599
Nah, my father's
a women's rights activist.

207
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:55,100
- Your dad?
- Yeah.

208
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:57,552
- Not your mom?
- No. Mom... no.

209
00:09:57,604 --> 00:10:00,672
Dad wouldn't
allow that. No way.

210
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,392
They like wrestling
in cooking oil on a plane.

211
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,911
Seems like a ridiculous
generalization.

212
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,863
No, these women I met,

213
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:10,899
I took them up on a plane,
they were making a salad,

214
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,819
Next thing you know, they're
just wrestling at 85,000 feet.

215
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:16,355
Do you know
any actual women, Dave?

216
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:18,841
Yeah, pretty much.

217
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:20,793
You said there would be
a lot of women here today.

218
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:23,796
There usually is, jemaine. I
don't know why they're not here.

219
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:26,014
They're probably
just doing brazilians.

220
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:28,100
They'll show up.
Don't worry.

221
00:10:32,355 --> 00:10:34,473
<i>- Oh, hey, guys. Come in.
- Hey, Murray.</i>

222
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:38,477
Well, basically,
I just wanted to check in,

223
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:40,362
See how you guys
were getting on.

224
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:42,531
- It's not as easy... is it?
- Without me - it's a bit easier.

225
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:44,533
- It's real easy.
- What?

226
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,085
We thought it would be easy
and it turned out to be easier.

227
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:48,770
So you thought
it was gonna be easy

228
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,255
And it's even easier
than you thought.

229
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:52,825
- It's easier than easy.
- Oh, okay, so you're telling me

230
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:55,144
It was
unbelievably easy.

231
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:57,696
Yeah, we're doing a jingle
for a toothpaste ad.

232
00:10:57,764 --> 00:11:01,416
Ah. Look, I know what these
advertising people are like, bret. Okay?

233
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:05,453
I've been to bangkok. Now Monday
you're trying to do a TV commercial,

234
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:07,256
They're filming it,
it's all about toothpaste,

235
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:09,658
Then Tuesday they're trying
to film you naked.

236
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:12,828
Yup. Next thing you know you're
getting drugs thrown at you

237
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:15,164
And all because you don't
have proper management.

238
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:18,650
- Happens all the time, guys.
- Well, it was good to see you, Murray.

239
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:20,602
- We're gonna... - we've
got to write a jingle.

240
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:24,189
Look, just hang on, okay? Now, do you
guys know what professional opinions are?

241
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:25,657
- Yes.
- You do? Okay. Do you have them?

242
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:27,059
- Yes.
- Yeah.

243
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:28,827
Good, 'cause ieed some.

244
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:30,529
Take a look at this.

245
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:33,582
- ¶ bounce bounce, doggy bounce... ¶
- oh yeah.

246
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:35,483
I can't stand
this song.

247
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:39,137
OK at that. Okay, that's not
what I wanted to show you.

248
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:41,173
Now look at this.

249
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,701
Okay?
Now, opinion time.

250
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,154
Is that one in any way
similar to the first one?

251
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:59,174
Yes, in that it is
exactly the me.

252
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:02,227
- Yeah, it's very similar. -
I'll tell you why it's similar...

253
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:05,397
Because this polish one is
what's known as a cover version.

254
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:08,383
<i>Okay? Now the only problem is</i>

255
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:10,786
This cover version
came out 13 years

256
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,571
Before the crazy dogggz's
original version.

257
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,290
<i>- Mmm.
- So my question to you is:</i>

258
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:19,344
Is that bad? Or do you
think that's normal?

259
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:21,547
I think
it's probably bad.

260
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,216
Okay. Well, that's what
the lawyer said.

261
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,134
I've got two bads.

262
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:28,320
What about you, bret?
Do you think that's bad?

263
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:31,073
- Mmm. Bad.
- Normal?

264
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,058
- Bad.
- You think that's...

265
00:12:33,142 --> 00:12:35,210
- I think that's probably bad.
- You think that's normal, do you?

266
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:37,045
- I think it's bad.
- All right.

267
00:12:37,096 --> 00:12:39,364
So I've got...
so you're normal...

268
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:40,983
- No, I'm bad.
- You're bad?

269
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,684
- Mm-hmm.
- I've got three...

270
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:46,705
Excuse me, I said wait until
the meeting's finished, please.

271
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:50,475
Excuse me. Careful with
that. That's worth $20,000.

272
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,044
It was a gift
from Tori Amos.

273
00:12:52,111 --> 00:12:54,863
- Are you moving office, Murray?
- I'm kind of moving.

274
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,867
Which brings me
to item three:

275
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:01,720
Uh, would any of you
like to buy a desk?

276
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:06,558
<i>Crazy dogggz, we're onto you!</i>

277
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:11,863
You ruined his life!

278
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,966
Oh, hey, guys!

279
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,103
Hey, can you believe this
crazy dogggz controversy?

280
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:19,838
This is such bullshit, right?

281
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:21,573
<i>- Hey, Doug.
- You should've seen Doug</i>

282
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,609
- When he heard what happened.
- Hey.

283
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,560
<i>- He went berserk.
- Really?</i>

284
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:28,146
Actually, mel really went
more sort of berserk.

285
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:30,966
Oh, stop hogging the
conversation, Doug. It's rude.

286
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:33,752
- It is rude. - I wasn't...
but I wasn't really hogging

287
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,737
Conversation hog.
"Oink oink oink oink.

288
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:37,889
I've got something
to say all the time."

289
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:40,142
<i>He's always talking.</i>

290
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,711
Are we going to light
this fire or what?

291
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:45,047
You know, I think
it's against city laws

292
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:46,765
To start a fire
on the sidewalk.

293
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:51,003
<i>- Oh my God, Doug.
- Hey, good luck with the cd burning.</i>

294
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,555
Hand me that gasoline can, all right?

295
00:13:53,622 --> 00:13:56,725
'Cause looks like I'm gonna
have to do this by myself,

296
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:58,944
- As per usual.
- Yeah, but I don't...

297
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:01,647
- Mel... oh.
- Why did you come, Doug,

298
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:04,433
If you didn't want
to light a fire?

299
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:10,805
- What's the problem?
- Do you think we're selling out

300
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:12,557
- By doing a jingle?
- No way, man.

301
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,593
Some of the best songs
are jingles.

302
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:20,065
¶ pussymart, pussymart. ¶

303
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,084
- I don't know that one.
- You guys are gonna get paid

304
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:24,870
- Out of the ass for that shit.
- That's why we need to talk to you.

305
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:27,789
We need to negotiate a deal and
we've got no idea how to do it.

306
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,008
Well, good luck
for you then,

307
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:31,977
'cause you're only
in Dave's house of deals.

308
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,945
The d in my name
stands for "deal."

309
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:35,964
And did you know
that the word "Dave"

310
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:38,583
Actually means
"deal" in latino?

311
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:41,319
Doing a deal is easy,
as long as you know how.

312
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:43,472
How much would
you give me for this?

313
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:45,390
- A dollar.
- Double it.

314
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:46,841
- $2.
- Double it again.

315
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,377
- $4.
- Sold!

316
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:50,479
- What's go... what?
- I just made him pay

317
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,497
Nearly 10 times what he wanted
to pay in the first place.

318
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:55,884
- You just manipulated him. - It's
called the Dave- double-down technique.

319
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:58,437
How do you think
I got that macrame owl?

320
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:00,505
- It's cool. It was a good one.
- Yeah.

321
00:15:00,573 --> 00:15:02,507
- Okay, thanks, man.
- There's your pen. Just give me my $4.

322
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:05,727
- Hmm?
- $4 please.

323
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:09,214
- I thought it was an exercise.
- Yeah, you've got to learn the whole lesson.

324
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:12,200
That's fine.
I'm gonna waive the tax.

325
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:14,519
Thanks for the table.
And good luck out there, guys.

326
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:20,025
The song. Wow.

327
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:22,861
<i>- Do you like it?
- Loved it.</i>

328
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:25,797
You are speaking
for women, by women.

329
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:27,566
<i>There's certain parts, though,</i>

330
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,485
That I think could use a little
work. This song is 18 minutes long.

331
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:33,021
We're talking about
a 30-second commercial here.

332
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:35,173
We thought it would be
more of a concept.

333
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:37,692
I know you're from new zealand.
What is this, "lord of the rings"?

334
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:42,080
- We don't have all day.
- Also, the lyrics don't really fit the product.

335
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:45,000
They're not...
they're not cohesive at all.

336
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:47,619
Some of them aren't about... some
of them aren't about toothpaste,

337
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:49,154
They're just things
in our life.

338
00:15:49,222 --> 00:15:51,523
- Yeah. - They don't...
they don't make sense

339
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:53,959
Okay, so just talk
about toothpaste, really?

340
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:56,795
<i>- Yes.
- And I have some big news for you.</i>

341
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,580
I've convinced
the client

342
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:01,383
To put you guys
on the ad on TV.

343
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:03,635
- Do we get more money?
- We haven't mentioned the money yet.

344
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:07,572
- Let's talk money.
- We were wondering if you could double it.

345
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,625
- I haven't mentioned the fee yet.
- Forget I said that.

346
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:13,628
What is... what is the
fee? I'm sorry, bret.

347
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:15,847
The fee is $1,000 each.
How about that?

348
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:18,316
- Sorry, now I'll say it. Double it.
- I am doubling it.

349
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:20,986
It was going to be $500 each.
That would've been $1,000.

350
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,190
- He already doubled it in his mind.
- Yeah, I doubled it just now.

351
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:26,958
<i>- $1,000 each?
- Yes.</i>

352
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:28,043
- Do we have a deal?
- Oh, that's good.

353
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,995
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

354
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,446
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

355
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:32,914
You're the femident boys.

356
00:16:43,142 --> 00:16:45,227
- Murray. Murray.
- Oh!

357
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,163
- Morning, guys.
- Hey.

358
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:49,898
Actually, get in the car.

359
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:51,733
I've got something I want
to talk to you about.

360
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,237
- Are you okay, Murray?
- Yeah, of course. Why?

361
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:58,106
- No... no reason.
- Bret, can you get a pencil

362
00:16:58,157 --> 00:17:00,075
Out of my stationery
cabinet there, please?

363
00:17:00,142 --> 00:17:02,994
- Where's that?
- That's the glovebox there.

364
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,281
Ah. Oh.

365
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:08,834
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

366
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:12,420
Now, I've got something I
want to talk to you about.

367
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:14,506
L... I don't really
know how to say it.

368
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,092
So I'm just going
to say it, okay?

369
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:19,094
Can I be
your manager again?

370
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:20,828
- No.
- Mmm, no.

371
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,181
Right. Sorry,
should've done the...

372
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:26,218
- Bret? - We... you're
not managing us,

373
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:27,502
- So we don't do roll
calls. - We'll just do a...

374
00:17:27,553 --> 00:17:29,337
This is not
a meeting though.

375
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:31,873
- Please. Come on, guys.
- No.

376
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:33,058
Things are going well
for us. We told you.

377
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,559
Things aren't
going well for me.

378
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:36,378
Why don't you get your old
job back at the consulate?

379
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:38,697
I can't do that, bret.
I've moved on.

380
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:41,066
Look at me.
I'm not going back there.

381
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,218
Plus when I quit I told them
all to go stuff themselves.

382
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:45,437
Really?
To their faces?

383
00:17:45,504 --> 00:17:47,072
No, I wrote it down,

384
00:17:47,156 --> 00:17:49,024
But it's the same feeling.
Imagine reading that.

385
00:17:49,091 --> 00:17:53,044
Okay? I've probably
been ostracized now.

386
00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:54,746
<i>I'm persona non regates.</i>

387
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,298
You know
what that means?

388
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:58,867
- No.
- You're not at yacht race?

389
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:01,336
Yeah. No,
they don't talk to me.

390
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:03,138
Are you living
in your car, Murray?

391
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:06,408
No, of course not.
It's illegal.

392
00:18:06,475 --> 00:18:08,927
You can't do that...
Apparently...

393
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:11,179
Unless you move your
vehicle every three hours.

394
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:16,568
I've got to go. That's
enough. Thank you.

395
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:18,520
Out you get.
Gone. Both of you.

396
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:20,939
There wasn't a meeting, Murray.
It doesn't count as a meeting.

397
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:23,725
Okay, go on.
Nice pants.

398
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:26,711
- Are they woven? Wow.
- These are man-made.

399
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:42,694
<i>¶ you are a woman,
you wear women's wear ¶</i>

400
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:45,413
<i>¶ you have breasts
and longish hair, oh yeah ¶</i>

401
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:47,915
<i>¶ you're kind of fun
everywhere ¶</i>

402
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,418
<i>¶ yet you're still
very rare, oh yeah ¶</i>

403
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:53,755
¶ you're a woman

404
00:18:53,806 --> 00:18:56,841
¶ you're a woman,

405
00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:59,444
¶ I know you love
women's rights ¶

406
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:02,614
¶ you're a woman with teeth,

409
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:10,938
¶ oh, femident toothpaste ¶

410
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,940
¶ femident, femident ¶

411
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:15,777
¶ femident. ¶

412
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:18,279
<i>And cut. Very nice. Cut.</i>

413
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:21,416
<i>Great stuff, guys.</i>

414
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,835
- Huh?
- Yeah, fantastic stuff.

415
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,171
Now if you'll just
fill out these forms

416
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:28,907
And get us copies of your work
permits, we are done here today.

417
00:19:28,975 --> 00:19:32,077
Mmm, we don't have
work permits.

418
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:35,263
Oh. Because you're foreign,
you need work permits

419
00:19:35,314 --> 00:19:37,965
- Or green cards, so...
- green cards?

420
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:40,251
Yes, green cards. You do
have a green card, right?

421
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,388
- Is it just a bit
of card? - No, it's...

422
00:19:43,456 --> 00:19:45,740
Just a card,
a greenish card?

423
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:48,243
<i>- No, it's...
- Is it like a library card?</i>

424
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,079
Are you legally allowed
to work in this country?

425
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:53,748
I don't think we're legally
allowed to be in the country.

426
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:56,150
No, we're illegal
immigrants.

427
00:19:56,202 --> 00:19:58,953
I think you'd better be in
touch with your attorneys.

428
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:01,656
You bastards better
bring your passports in

429
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:04,359
And show us your
goddamn work permits.

430
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:12,951
Hello.
Murray speaking.

431
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:15,053
<i>- Murray, it'sret.
- Oh, hello, bret.</i>

432
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,255
<i>- How are you?
- Not so good.</i>

433
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:20,041
<i>- We need our passports.
- Well, you know I don't have them, bret.</i>

434
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:21,659
They're in
the consulate office.

435
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:24,979
I'm actually just outside
there now, by chance.

436
00:20:25,031 --> 00:20:26,965
<i>It's just we're
in a little bit of trouble.</i>

437
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:28,950
- You're in trouble?
- Legal trouble.

438
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:31,336
Yeah, jemaine's just saying
we're in legal trouble.

439
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:33,822
Well, just calm down.
Are you sitting down?

440
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:36,691
<i>- Yeah, we are sitting down.
- Okay, what have you got on?</i>

441
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:40,278
We've got blue robes on.
We're not wearing anything...

442
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:43,064
Get dressed. Where are you?
Are you in a hotel room?

443
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:44,466
Could you just bring...

444
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,851
Can you bring our passports
and some green cards, please?

445
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,254
<i>- All right.
- Thanks.</i>

446
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,594
Psst! Greg!

447
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:15,080
It's me... Murray.

448
00:21:16,615 --> 00:21:18,750
Oh, greg,
I just wanted to say...

449
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:22,053
All right? Straight
up... I'm very very...

450
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:24,839
I don't know how
to put this, okay?

451
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:28,593
There were a couple
of messages you had.

452
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:30,662
No, just give us
a chance, all right?

453
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:32,714
This is not easy
for me, all right?

454
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:36,351
I wasn't myself. The things I
put in that letter... unbelievable.

455
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:39,604
One from may... something about
your gym membership expiring...

456
00:21:39,688 --> 00:21:43,475
One from the prime minister
from September

457
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,944
And one just
before christma...

458
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:48,446
No, that's...
that was a wrong number.

459
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:52,117
- Okay.
- Is there anything else I can do for you?

460
00:21:52,184 --> 00:21:54,903
Uh, no. No, that's good. Thank you.

461
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:19,310
Guys. Psst!
Come here, come here.

462
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:21,779
Come here.

463
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,351
Well, good news, guys:
I got my job back,

464
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:28,586
- I got your passports.
- That's great.

465
00:22:28,654 --> 00:22:30,405
Bad news, guys: Your
passports aren't ready.

466
00:22:30,472 --> 00:22:32,724
- They're not processed.
- Do you have them?

467
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:34,826
<i>- No, they're in my cupboard.
- You just said you had them.</i>

468
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,111
- I've got them in my cupboard.
- Have you got our work visas?

469
00:22:37,163 --> 00:22:39,247
You don't ha work visas.
You've never needed them before.

470
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:41,015
You've never had
a proper job.

471
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,601
This is exactly what happens
when you try to manage yourselves.

472
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:46,437
If you had stuck with me, you wouldn't
be in this job situation, would you?

473
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:48,790
What are we gonna tell
Martin underscore Clark?

474
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:50,592
I don't know. You're
managing yourselves now.

475
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:53,695
Look at you... no idea what to
do. Right, now listen to me.

476
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:56,047
If you hire me back,
I'll tell you what to do.

477
00:22:56,115 --> 00:22:58,183
- Come on.
- Okay.

478
00:22:58,267 --> 00:22:59,834
All right, okay,
you're our manager again.

479
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:01,135
- Really?
- Yeah, great.

480
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:03,054
- What should we do?
- You miss me?

481
00:23:03,138 --> 00:23:04,806
- Welcome back. No.
- No.

482
00:23:04,857 --> 00:23:06,808
- A little bit. A little bit.
- A little bit?

483
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:08,476
Okay, now here's
my advice:

484
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:10,495
I think we should run
for it. Come on, let's go.

485
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:12,480
Go! Run! Run!

486
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:14,482
Quickly!
No time for debate!

487
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:17,151
Go! Hurry up!

488
00:23:19,238 --> 00:23:21,456
- Go!
- Go go!

489
00:23:21,523 --> 00:23:23,408
They're coming.
Go! Drive!

490
00:23:27,463 --> 00:23:29,130
Good managing,
eh, guys?

491
00:23:29,197 --> 00:23:31,633
Oh, bret,
that's for you.

492
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,385
Oh, man.

493
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,154
I managed
to get you a shoe, eh?

494
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:38,089
Thanks, Murray.

495
00:23:38,173 --> 00:23:40,041
<i>That's okay.
You know what?</i>

496
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:41,676
I think there's a guardian
angel looking after us.

497
00:23:41,727 --> 00:23:44,178
Murray, it couldn't have
possibly gone worse.

498
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,514
Somewhere up there,
someone's looking down,

499
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:48,900
Making sure everything
turns out okay for us.

500
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:52,020
I'm sure of it.

501
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:02,447
¶ there are angels ¶

502
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:04,782
¶ in the clouds ¶

503
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:07,085
¶ doing it ¶

504
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,840
¶ there are angels ¶

505
00:24:12,908 --> 00:24:15,576
¶ doing it, doing it,
doing it, doing it ¶

506
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:19,847
¶ doing it, doing it,
doing it in the clouds ¶

507
00:24:23,636 --> 00:24:27,438
¶ behind the shroud
of the clouds ¶

508
00:24:27,523 --> 00:24:30,024
¶ fooling around ¶

509
00:24:34,113 --> 00:24:37,649
¶ in the clouds,
they're lying ¶

510
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:40,735
¶ feathers flying ¶

511
00:24:40,786 --> 00:24:44,739
¶ angels sighing ¶

512
00:24:45,874 --> 00:24:48,826
¶ there are angels ¶

513
00:24:52,214 --> 00:24:55,133
¶ nobody knows
what goes on ¶

514
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:58,920
¶ under those robes ¶

515
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:03,591
¶ pushing and puffing ¶

516
00:25:03,642 --> 00:25:06,227
¶ and huffing and heaving ¶

517
00:25:06,294 --> 00:25:07,795
¶ pushing, puffing,
huffing and heaving ¶

518
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:09,263
¶ pushing, puffing,
huffing and heaving ¶

519
00:25:09,315 --> 00:25:12,299
¶ pushing, puffing, huffing
and heaving in heaven ¶

520
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:16,404
¶ up there
they're playing ¶

521
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:19,140
¶ the loving game ¶

522
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:21,909
¶ making rain ¶

523
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:26,497
¶ turning
white clouds grey ¶

524
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:36,124
¶ doing it ¶

525
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,434
¶ doing it ¶

526
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:57,178
¶ doing it, doing it ¶

527
00:25:57,246 --> 00:25:59,947
¶ doing it, doing it,
doing it, doing it ¶

528
00:26:00,015 --> 00:26:04,318
¶ doing it. ¶

529
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:14,712
¶ doing it. ¶
