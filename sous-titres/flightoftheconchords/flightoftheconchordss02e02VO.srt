1
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:09,380
- What's that?
- It's a cup.

2
00:00:09,415 --> 00:00:11,816
What, a new cup?

3
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:13,952
Yeah, I got a new cup.
Do you like it?

4
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:16,421
- We've got a cup.
- Yeah, we've got one cup.

5
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:17,956
We needed two cups.

6
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:19,290
Why would we need
two cups?

7
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:21,059
So I can have a cup of tea
at the same time as you.

8
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:25,063
- Bret, do you even pay any attention to the cup roster?
- Your cup roster.

9
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:27,966
That means I can't drink a cup
of tea between 7:00 and 9:00 pm.

10
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:30,401
Well, I have it till 9:00 and
then you get it for two hours.

11
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:32,771
Then I use it
from 11:00 till 1:00.

12
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:34,472
You use it
from 1:00 till 3:00.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,473
Yeah, I have to wait till 1:00
if I want to have another cup.

14
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,008
And then we give
the cup a rest.

15
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:39,377
It was only $2.79.

16
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,980
- $2.79?
- Yeah, I thought it was quite good.

17
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:46,451
Okay, well, I just need
a second to calm down.

18
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:48,419
It's all right,
isn't it?

19
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,256
I suppose.

20
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,333
Bret.

21
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:37,135
- Bret.
- Mm-hmm?

22
00:01:37,203 --> 00:01:39,104
Our check for the
phone Bill bounced.

23
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:41,106
It says here
on our bank statement

24
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:47,045
that our account
was short $2.79.

25
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:49,047
How much
was that cup again?

26
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:50,448
$2.79.

27
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:53,585
Oh, that's quite
interesting, isn't it?

28
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:56,221
Well, because
our check bounced,

29
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:58,022
we got charged
a $30 overdraft fee

30
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,658
which made
our gas Bill bounce.

31
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:02,660
Yeah,
that's boring, man.

32
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:06,030
Yes, but the point is because
of your $2.79 spending spree,

33
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:09,300
we now owe $60 and our phone
and gas are gonna be cut off.

34
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:11,569
Stink.

35
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:16,207
Ah. We got a letter from
the electricity company.

36
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:18,843
What did it say?

37
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:21,713
Didn't read it.

38
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:30,555
All right.

39
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:32,624
Nice dressing room.

40
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:36,928
Bret, where's your guitar?

41
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:38,363
Hm?

42
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,999
You should have a guitar.

43
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:43,001
I sold it
to pay the bills.

44
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:44,736
You can't go on
like that.

45
00:02:44,804 --> 00:02:47,205
Won't it sound weird just with
the big guitar that Jemaine plays?

46
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:48,740
The bass.
It's called a bass.

47
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:50,875
Well, I call it the dad guitar,
'cause it's more like a...

48
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:52,877
"I'm your dad.
Hey, Murray,

49
00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:56,080
get into the shed and get
the mower... do the lawn."

50
00:02:56,148 --> 00:02:59,184
You need Bret's mum guitar
to add the beautiful tones.

51
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:00,685
"Come on, now.
Murray's okay.

52
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:03,188
He's with me. Why you
get home so late, Gordon?"

53
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:05,290
"I was having
a few beers."

54
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:06,891
It'll sound fine.

55
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,861
It won't sound fine, Bret.
You've got no guitar.

56
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:12,030
How does it sound then?

57
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:13,965
I can hardly hear it.

58
00:03:18,304 --> 00:03:20,004
You'd have to be deaf
to hear that.

59
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,341
¶ the humans are dead... ¶

60
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:25,877
¶ the humans are dead ¶

61
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:30,048
<i>¶ we used poisonous
gases... ¶</i>

62
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:34,219
<i>oh, good news.</i>

63
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:36,988
The new new zealand
consulate newsletter is out.

64
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:39,791
- Oh, who cares?
- You should care, Jemaine.

65
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:41,626
- Well, I don't.
- Shall I read the music review section?

66
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:43,061
- If you must.
- What?

67
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:46,064
"Conchords crash and burn."

68
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:48,433
Doesn't sound too good.
"By Murray hewitt."

69
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:50,935
- You wrote this?
- "The flight of the conchords..."

70
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:52,504
- what?
- "...have great potential,

71
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,440
but last night, playing
with only one guitar,

72
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:58,209
the dad guitar
or "bass" in muso terms,

73
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:01,746
and one air guitar
which was mimed,

74
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:03,882
they were a musical
embarrassment.

75
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:05,884
- Two stars."
- Two stars?

76
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,585
- Two stars.
- You can't give us two stars, Murray.

77
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:09,220
Two out of five stars?

78
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:10,755
Well, I wish it was,

79
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:12,323
but it's out of 100.

80
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:14,125
Hmm.

81
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,094
- Oh, I thought it was out of five.
- Don't tell people that.

82
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:17,962
Say it's out of five.

83
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,765
Can we use the emergency band
fund to get my guitar back?

84
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,801
Well, that's...

85
00:04:22,868 --> 00:04:24,869
that's actually tied up
in an investment at the moment.

86
00:04:24,937 --> 00:04:26,838
What's this investment?

87
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:29,240
It's a friend of mine
from nigeria.

88
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:32,177
- Nigel soladu.
- When did you go to nigeria?

89
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:34,179
Well, I didn't go.
That's the best bit.

90
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:36,181
He just randomly send me
an internet letter

91
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:39,117
offering me a business
opportunity and I went with it.

92
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:41,586
In a few days' time, he'll
return the money I invested

93
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:43,188
plus 1,000% interest

94
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:45,490
<i>and a share
of his family fortunes.</i>

95
00:04:45,524 --> 00:04:47,358
- It's a scam.
- It is not a scam.

96
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:49,360
Why would someone
want to scam me, Jemaine,

97
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:51,362
and on the internet service,

98
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,832
one of the trusted things
of today's society?

99
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:57,702
Have you got
any food here?

100
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,304
Oh you want a couple
of biscuits, do you?

101
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:02,207
Okay, we can order some.

102
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:04,909
Just fill out this.

103
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:06,878
Put how many biscuits
you want, your name,

104
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:08,580
and you'll have to
bring in some I.D.

105
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:10,982
That gets sent back
to wellington.

106
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,351
We'll have
your biscuits by Tuesday.

107
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:20,058
Who's gonna want to buy
one of those, Bret?

108
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,495
Mainly people who need
to drink from far away.

109
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:25,763
Superstraws!

110
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:28,133
- Well, hello, guys.
- Hey, mel.

111
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,735
I will have
a superstraw, please.

112
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:32,403
- Awesome.
- Here we go.

113
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,973
- Thank you.
- Hey, great gig the other night.

114
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:38,743
I noticed, Bret,
you didn't have a guitar.

115
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:40,779
Is that something
that you forgot?

116
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,781
Or are you
trying it out

117
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:45,884
or is that just something
I'll have to get used to?

118
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:48,186
I sold it
to get some money.

119
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:51,022
Wow, that's so romantic...

120
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,859
two struggling musicians
living in poverty

121
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:58,463
and despair,
selling their instruments.

122
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:01,566
I know it sounds good, but
it's actually pretty dressing.

123
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,636
All our utilities were cut
off because Bret bought a cup.

124
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,273
Oh, well, I could
give you guys some money.

125
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,041
- Yeah?
- Thanks, mel.

126
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:12,610
I mean, you would have
to earn it, of course.

127
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:15,513
I mean, I wouldn't insult you
by giving you charity.

128
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:17,115
What do we have to do?

129
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:19,818
Do you guys...

130
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,253
do massage?

131
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:25,056
- Bret does.
- No.

132
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:26,324
- I don't. You do.
- Bret does.

133
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:27,926
- I don't, but Bret does.
- He does.

134
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:29,828
- Jemaine's the one for that.
- Bret always does that.

135
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:31,596
- I've seen you do it.
- Bret's always massaging.

136
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:33,698
Bret's a real
good masseuse.

137
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:36,401
Okay then.
Well, Bret,

138
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:39,070
I will see you
at my place at 4:30?

139
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:41,039
Huh?

140
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:50,281
Should I lay down?

141
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:52,417
No no,
this is good.

142
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:55,420
Maybe I should take off
some clothes, so you could...

143
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:57,322
no no, that's good.

144
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,258
Whoo! Hey, Bret, when
does the massage start?

145
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:02,260
When do you touch me?

146
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:04,262
I'm just doing it
very gently

147
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,297
- to begin with.
- Are you...

148
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:09,033
I can't really feel it.
I wanna feel it.

149
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,602
I'm trying to...

150
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:13,171
- just stay in your seat.
- Okay, all right.

151
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:15,507
Are you sure Doug's
gonna be okay with this?

152
00:07:15,574 --> 00:07:18,476
Yeah, it's just a massage.
Doug will be fine with it.

153
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:21,346
Yeah,
I'm fine with it.

154
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:25,216
Unless I start
feeling something,

155
00:07:25,284 --> 00:07:28,319
I guess I'm not gonna be
able to pay you $30.

156
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:31,089
I'll do it.

157
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:34,959
Oh yeah.
Wow.

158
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:37,095
Oh, you are good at this.

159
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:42,066
You're like a samurai,
like a massage samurai.

160
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:43,535
I'm just patting her.

161
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:46,571
Oh, I feel like
I've hired a gigolo.

162
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,407
I'm just kidding.
I would never hire...

163
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:52,510
I mean, I would, I would,
but I wouldn't pay you.

164
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:54,879
I would. I would
pay you so much money.

165
00:07:54,947 --> 00:07:57,449
I'm just kidding.
That's not how I am.

166
00:07:57,516 --> 00:07:59,584
That's not
what I'm about.

167
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:01,553
I'm joking.
I'm not.

168
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,521
I am.
I'm not.

169
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:05,256
Oh wow.

170
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:09,928
Bret, you know how you
told me you were good at sex?

171
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:12,831
- Are you?
- That was just 'cause you asked me in front of Sally.

172
00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:14,899
Right, yeah.
Okay.

173
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,901
Well, you were
lying then.

174
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:18,970
- I was exaggerating a little bit.
- Lying.

175
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,307
- No, exaggerating.
- Well, maybe mel's right.

176
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:23,875
Maybe we could be
prostitutes.

177
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:26,811
Prostitution is a quick
way of making money.

178
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:30,548
It is not degrading.

179
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:32,584
It is not
degrading.

180
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:34,619
- Have you seen "pretty woman"?
- No.

181
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:38,823
Well, it's a story about a
prostitute called Richard gere

182
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:42,026
who gets to go out with a
"pretty woman" Julia roberts

183
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:43,695
who pays him
a lot of money.

184
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:45,797
Do you think Julia roberts
is a pretty woman?

185
00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:47,565
Yes.

186
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:49,634
Well, imagine getting
to have sex with women

187
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:52,504
similar to Julia roberts
and getting paid for it.

188
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:56,941
Jemaine, I don't think we're
gonna get sex and get paid.

189
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:00,044
- Why not?
- 'Cause we never get sex or get paid.

190
00:09:00,112 --> 00:09:02,947
Bret, the ladies go crazy
for my sugarlumps.

191
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:05,917
- Your what?
- Check it out.

192
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:08,086
All the ladies are just
checking out my sugarlumps.

193
00:09:15,461 --> 00:09:16,928

194

¶ if you party

227
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:41,312
¶ and I took his sugarlumps
and put 'em up in a display ¶

228
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,381

¶ sweet sugarlumps. ¶

235
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:02,400
what do you think, Bret?

236
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:04,402
I don't think I want
to be a prostitute.

237
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,271
- What?
- You should be the prostitute.

238
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:07,772
You bought the cup.

239
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,810
Hi, do you need
a prostitute?

240
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:13,511
Excuse me.

241
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:16,114
Sorry to interrupt, but do
you see my friend over there

242
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:18,983
with the red shirt?

243
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:20,919
He's a bit of
a part-time prostitute.

244
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:23,021
I was wondering...

245
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:23,988
- no thanks.
- Might this entice you?

246
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:25,423
Nut loaf.

247
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:30,195
- She said no.
- Did she say why?

248
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:33,331
Bret, perhaps you should wear
shorts and show your legs off

249
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:36,301
and maybe wear a cowboy hat
and cover up your head a bit.

250
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:38,036
I don't have
a cowboy hat.

251
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:39,871
I've got that old
sun hat, though.

252
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:42,474
And also, I think you're
gonna have to go the whole way.

253
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,741
You can't just hug them.

254
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:46,678
Just hugs until
I get more confident.

255
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:50,048
Okay.

256
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:51,683
Do you want to swap
for a while?

257
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:57,689
Excuse me.

258
00:11:57,723 --> 00:11:59,958
Would you like to party
with my friend?

259
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:01,493
I'm sorry?

260
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,428
Would you like to dance?
Mamba?

261
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:06,197
- What?
- You see my friend over there?

262
00:12:06,265 --> 00:12:08,066
<i>He's a player,
a night owl.</i>

263
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:09,400
20-40-60.

264
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:12,704
Okay, 10-30-50.

265
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:14,472
- What are you talking about?
- $5.

266
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:16,007
He'll go all the way
and he's clean.

267
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:17,609
- You interested?
- What?

268
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:20,278
- Not interested?
Okay, move along.

269
00:12:20,346 --> 00:12:21,980
Move along.
I'm walking here.

270
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:23,782
I'm walking.

271
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:27,752
- What happened?
- Not interested.

272
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,327
It's dark, Bret.

273
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:37,929
Yeah, I know.

274
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:39,931
What expression's
on your face?

275
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:42,700
Um,
guilty expression.

276
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:44,669
What expression's
on your face?

277
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:46,905
Sad because we don't
have any electricity,

278
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:49,674
but satisfied 'cause I
was right about the cup.

279
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:53,211
That's a weird
expression.

280
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,215
Bret, how much are you
selling those superstraws for?

281
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:58,850
One dollar.

282
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:01,186
How many straws does it take
to make a superstraw?

283
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:02,320
Five.

284
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:03,888
What's the total cost
of those five straws?

285
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:06,691
Two-fift...
oh.

286
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:11,196
I've sold
quite a few of them.

287
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:14,532
Oh.

288
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:17,669
<i>¶ humans are dead ¶</i>

289
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:21,106
¶ humans are dead ¶

290
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:25,076
¶ had to be done ¶

291
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:28,413
¶ so we could have fun. ¶

292
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:34,619
okay, listen
to this review, guys.

293
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:36,588
"Flight of the no-chords.

294
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:39,057
It was hard to tell
if the band was a band

295
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:41,693
or a mime troop.
No stars."

296
00:13:44,163 --> 00:13:45,830
So that's what they're
saying about you.

297
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:47,732
That's what you're saying
about us. You wrote it.

298
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:49,701
It doesn't matter
who wrote it, Jemaine.

299
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:51,703
This is what people
are reading.

300
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:53,705
This is the written
report on you

301
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:56,474
- that someone's written.
- Yeah. You.

302
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:58,510
Maybe.

303
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:00,812
- It says "by Murray hewitt."
- Yeah, I know.

304
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:03,381
- It's got your picture there.
- Yes.

305
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:07,585
You're a band
with no instruments.

306
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:10,054
<i>- How does it feel?
- Not very good.</i>

307
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:12,757
No, not very good. Can you
think of any successful musicians

308
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:15,260
- with no instruments?
- The Mormon tabernacle choir.

309
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:17,462
- I can't.
- Boyz ii men.

310
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,497
Bobby mcferrin.
Pavarotti.

311
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:21,132
Bret's right.
There are none.

312
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,400
No one else
is doing it.

313
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:24,068
<i>The venue doesn't
want you back</i>

314
00:14:24,136 --> 00:14:25,537
until you've got
instruments.

315
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:26,805
- Is that what they said?
- Yup.

316
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:28,606
So guess what I've done?

317
00:14:28,641 --> 00:14:30,942
I've written up a timeline,
if you look over here,

318
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,811
to show us how long
it's gonna take

319
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:34,646
to raise the money

320
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:36,548
to get your guitars back.

321
00:14:36,615 --> 00:14:38,550
It's a pretty
big timeline.

322
00:14:38,617 --> 00:14:41,119
Yeah, I sort of made the
scale wrong at the start there

323
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:42,387
and it got out of hand.

324
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:44,923
You should see
the first one I made, though.

325
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,891
It's definitely
an improvement.

326
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,828
Basically, you should have
your guitars back

327
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:51,763
in about 14 years.

328
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:53,264
- 14 years?
- Yup.

329
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:56,835
And that's if you stop
selling those straws, Bret.

330
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:59,604
What about the band investment
with Mr. Nigel soladu?

331
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:02,407
Yes, well, I'm still
waiting on that.

332
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:05,343
I've got you
some good news here.

333
00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:07,412
- I've got you a paid gig.
- Well, that's good.

334
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,981
Yes, well actually
it's just Bret.

335
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:12,417
And it's not
a musical gig as such.

336
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:14,419
You'll be dressing up
in a costume

337
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:16,087
for a guy called Eddie.

338
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:17,555
- Eddie?
- Yes, you know Eddie?

339
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:20,692
- My boss?
- Yup, he phoned me up. It's all sorted.

340
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,660
He said to tell you that
your phone wasn't working

341
00:15:22,728 --> 00:15:24,662
and that you've got a job
if you want it.

342
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,397
So he just left
a message.

343
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:28,600
- Well, it was a gig offer, wasn't it?
- No.

344
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:30,101
That's already
my job.

345
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:32,103
So...

346
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:34,105
I can't get a cut
on that?

347
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:36,808
No, 'cause that's already
my job. I do that job.

348
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:39,511
All right,
I'll note that down.

349
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:43,648
"No commission
on Bret's job."

350
00:15:43,716 --> 00:15:45,350
- What about you, Jemaine?
- What?

351
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,485
Do you have an outside-
source income?

352
00:15:47,553 --> 00:15:49,020
Yeah, sort of.

353
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:52,123
I could work on that with you
and get a cut of it.

354
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:53,992
You don't want to.

355
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,394
- I'd like to.
- No.

356
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:01,032
I need some money.

357
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:06,905
Hey, carol,
it's Jemaine here.

358
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:09,040
I was just
calling to say...

359
00:16:09,074 --> 00:16:11,142
do you remember how
we slept together

360
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,710
about six times
I think it was

361
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:14,412
last year
in february?

362
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,514
Uh, yeah.
I'm a prostitute now.

363
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:21,386
Um, so I was wondering if I might
be able to get some money for that,

364
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,924
maybe about $40 a time?

365
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:27,459
That's $3 off.

366
00:16:27,493 --> 00:16:31,663
Also, would you be interested
in going out sometime?

367
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,699
I'd love that.
Okay, bye.

368
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:38,770
<i>- Any luck?
- Possibly, yeah. Very promising.</i>

369
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:42,841
You should be prostituting
yourself, Bret.

370
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:45,143
No, I found being
a prostitute degrading.

371
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:48,613
Free condoms. Free condoms
from the human condom!

372
00:16:56,322 --> 00:17:01,192
Jemaine, are you prostituting
yourself in front of my building?

373
00:17:03,295 --> 00:17:05,530
No.
How did you know that?

374
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:07,565
- Did Bret tell you?
- No.

375
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:10,268
I saw it on the advertisement
on the lobby notice board.

376
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:13,471
Did you take that off
the lobby notice board?

377
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,974
Yes and I don't have
my own copy.

378
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,443
I just don't think we're gonna
be able to pay our rent otherwise.

379
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:20,078
- We're bankrupt.
- Oh.

380
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:23,114
Try hotels... fancy ones
and ones near the airport.

381
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:25,717
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

382
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:27,051
Thanks
for the suggestion.

383
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:29,053
- How did you know that?
- I read it in a book.

384
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:31,055
- What book?
- Just a normal book.

385
00:17:31,123 --> 00:17:33,024
Just a normal book...
nondescript.

386
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:34,626
- Just a book I had.
- Just a book.

387
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,796
- Just a normal book.
- Just a very normal book.

388
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:41,299
- Just a super... - a book that
tells you where to sell your body.

389
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,902
Just a normal book
with all kinds of facts.

390
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:45,870
- That's one of 'em.
- What was the title?

391
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:47,605
"Just how
to get it done."

392
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:51,075
This lift is so slow.

393
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:57,449
Okay, band meeting.
Bret?

394
00:17:57,516 --> 00:17:58,783
Present.

395
00:17:58,818 --> 00:18:00,785
Jemaine.
Not present.

396
00:18:01,854 --> 00:18:03,421
Absent.

397
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:05,423
Bret.
No, I've done you.

398
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:07,459
This has put me all out
of whack. Where's Jemaine?

399
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:09,794
He's out
working the beat.

400
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:12,363
<i>- Working the beat?
- Yeah.</i>

401
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:14,899
- Drumming?
- No, he's a gigolo.

402
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:16,901
- A what?
- He's a prostitute.

403
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:18,903
Jemaine's a hooker.

404
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:21,539
A whore? Is he?

405
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:24,609
- A prostitute.
- A male prostitute.

406
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:28,813
Jemaine shouldn't
be doing this.

407
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:30,348
Indeed
he should not, sir.

408
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,885
Uh, Murray, who's...
who's this?

409
00:18:33,953 --> 00:18:35,887
Oh, this is
nigel soladu.

410
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:36,855
He's my new
business partner.

411
00:18:36,922 --> 00:18:38,723
<i>- From the internet?
- Yes!</i>

412
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,326
Can you imagine it? Out of the hundreds
of people that use the internet,

413
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,761
only I was willing
to help him.

414
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:45,663
<i>- This is Bret.
- Hi.</i>

415
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:48,533
Bret, you've got to get
out there and stop Jemaine.

416
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:51,669
All right? He shouldn't be
selling himself to the street!

417
00:18:51,737 --> 00:18:53,772
Jemaine doesn't think
it's degrading.

418
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,040
- It is degrading.
- It is degrading.

419
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:58,009
He's just putting on
a brave face.

420
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:00,512
- No one likes being a prostitute.
- Jemaine likes it.

421
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:02,247
Well, why don't you
become a prostitute?

422
00:19:02,314 --> 00:19:03,481
Why aren't I
a prostitute?

423
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:05,183
Why aren't I
a prostitute, Bret?

424
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:07,385
Good one, nigel. Why
isn't nigel a prostitute?

425
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:09,287
We could all be
in a prostitute club.

426
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:11,890
It's 'cause of that cup. You
should never have bought that cup.

427
00:19:11,924 --> 00:19:14,159
I just wanted a new cup.
We only had one cup.

428
00:19:14,226 --> 00:19:15,860
So there's two of us

429
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:18,596
I often have to wait
for Jemaine to finish his...

430
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:20,899
anyway, good news
on the money front, right?

431
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,234
My family thanks you
for the loan.

432
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:25,603
Thanks to Murray's trust
and generosity,

433
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:29,140
<i>your band investment fund
has seen a very healthy profit.</i>

434
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,343
We can get your guitars back
and we can pay your power Bill.

435
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:35,146
Something you'd like
to say to Mr. Soladu?

436
00:19:35,214 --> 00:19:37,048
Thank you very much,
nigel.

437
00:19:37,116 --> 00:19:40,185
Oh and on behalf of Jemaine... he's
prostituting himself at the moment...

438
00:19:40,252 --> 00:19:42,187
- all right, don't go on about
it... thank you for that.

439
00:19:42,254 --> 00:19:44,856
Good. Also, I've got something to say.

440
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:48,660
<i>Nagoota tata lacie.</i>

441
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:50,328
Did I say that right?

442
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:52,397
I don't know
what you said.

443
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:54,332
I'm still trying
on that one.

444
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,334
Would you be okay if I
were to use your computer?

445
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:58,770
- I would like to check my email.
- Yes, certainly.

446
00:19:58,838 --> 00:20:01,372
There's the keyboard here.
There's the mouse.

447
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,375
You can just go up and down
on the keys. I don't use that.

448
00:20:04,443 --> 00:20:06,845
There's the TV screen.

449
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:08,913
Okay, be quiet.
Don't say anything.

450
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:10,648
He's going online, right?

451
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:12,917
You've got to get out there
and save Jemaine.

452
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:15,386
It's getting dark.
It's very dangerous

453
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:18,223
when you're out on the
streets as a man prostitute.

454
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,891
- I'll go tell him.
- Go, Bret.

455
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:20,892
Okay, see ya.

456
00:20:22,928 --> 00:20:24,896
Eugene, have you
seen Jemaine?

457
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:26,931
Uh, I...

look, so... I have $200. is that enough?

506
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:17,135
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

507
00:23:17,236 --> 00:23:19,304
Yeah, I should be
able to get

508
00:23:19,338 --> 00:23:22,273
50% extra.

509
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:24,275
<i>- Oh, great.
- Yeah.</i>

510
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,645
I have a few rules.
No laughing,

511
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,614
especially during, okay?
It puts me off.

512
00:23:29,648 --> 00:23:32,250
That's one.
Um, number two:

513
00:23:32,318 --> 00:23:34,419
If you go overtime,

514
00:23:34,487 --> 00:23:36,754
I'm gonna have to charge you
for the next 20 minutes.

515
00:23:36,822 --> 00:23:39,557
<i>- One or two minutes is...
- do you want to do this or not?</i>

516
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:41,759
Uh, yes I do.

517
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:45,563
It's my policy for clients
to have a shower.

518
00:23:46,966 --> 00:23:48,700
Okay.

519
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,046
- Bret.
- Jemaine.

520
00:24:02,114 --> 00:24:03,581
You don't need
to be a prostitute.

521
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:06,351
It's fine, man. Mr.
Soladu's money came through.

522
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:08,987
- Get out of here.
- No, I'm serious. It's totally fine.

523
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:10,989
Murray said
it's degrading as well.

524
00:24:11,056 --> 00:24:12,557
Oh, it isn't degrading.
It's fine.

525
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,058
- Are you sure?
- Yeah yeah yeah.

526
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:15,493
I just feel bad
'cause I got the cup.

527
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:16,995
- No, don't worry about it.
- Really?

528
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,164
- Yes yes, get out of here.
- It is more social.

529
00:24:19,198 --> 00:24:22,066
- Yeah, exactly.
- You can sit down, have a cup of tea together.

530
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:24,402
Get out, Bret. I've got a
customer. It's a pretty woman.

531
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,038
<i>- Police department.
Open up.</i>

532
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:29,574
<i>- Police.
- Open up.</i>

533
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:31,042
I called them
to come and save you.

534
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,080
New York city police.

535
00:24:36,148 --> 00:24:37,315
We got a call
of solicitation

536
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:38,383
of prostitution
at this location.

537
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,953
You, are you
the prostitute?

538
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:43,922
Yes, ma'am.

539
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:45,223
You're a prostitute
as well?

540
00:24:45,257 --> 00:24:47,892
No no, I'm just the guy
that wears the big condom.

541
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,797
A bit boring
in jail, eh?

542
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:56,634
There's nothing
to do.

543
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,373
I knew if you bought a cup,
we'd end up in jail.

544
00:25:02,441 --> 00:25:04,242
<i>I knew it.</i>

545
00:25:06,645 --> 00:25:08,580
Are these your guys?

546
00:25:08,647 --> 00:25:10,415
Yes, this is them.

547
00:25:10,483 --> 00:25:13,284
- Hello, guys.
- Hey, Murray.

548
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:15,620
Wow. This is a turnout
for the books, huh?

549
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:17,722
This is the lowest
of the low.

550
00:25:17,756 --> 00:25:19,524
You're an embarrassment
to new zealand.

551
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:23,094
Jemaine, was it a good
thing to prostitute yourself?

552
00:25:24,797 --> 00:25:27,098
- Well...
- no, it wasn't.

553
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:30,568
And, Bret, you're lucky
I'm bailing you out.

554
00:25:30,636 --> 00:25:33,772
And unfortunately I've had to use all
the profits from the nigel soladu fund,

555
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:35,707
so we're back
at square one.

556
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:38,176
- Typical, isn't it?
- At square one again?

557
00:25:38,244 --> 00:25:40,645
Yes. We were at square
two, but now we're back.

558
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:43,982
- When was that?
- Let's stop talking about squares.

559
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:45,917
Let's go. You're like a couple of...

560
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:48,820
jailhouse turkeys.

561
00:25:50,823 --> 00:25:52,757
When's the electricity
coming back on?

562
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,159
They said it
would be on by now.

563
00:25:54,226 --> 00:25:55,760
What time is it?

564
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:08,873
You'll be pleased
about that.

565
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:39,838
<i>¶ girls surround me when
I'm standing on the stoop ¶</i>

566
00:26:39,905 --> 00:26:41,673
<i>¶ giving me gifts
like free chicken soup ¶</i>

567
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,842
<i>¶ book tokens,
free chicken soup ¶</i>

568
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:47,612
<i>¶ standing on the
corner going... ¶</i>

569
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,913
<i>¶ standing on the
corner going... ¶</i>
