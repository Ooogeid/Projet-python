1
00:00:04,153 --> 00:00:06,688
- So it goes g...
- g, b...

2
00:00:06,722 --> 00:00:08,756
guys, the audience
is in, okay?

3
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:11,259
- So you can go on.
- How many?

4
00:00:11,327 --> 00:00:13,695
Uh, one...

5
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:17,632
- yeah, one.
- One?

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,367
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Is it Mel?

7
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:21,502
No, it's not, Bret.
Actually, Mel was busy.

8
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:23,938
She actually requested
that she can't come today.

9
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:27,141
But if she was here,
yes, we'd have two.

10
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:29,310
But unfortunately
we're down to one today.

11
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:32,247
- One person?
- It's a big guy though, Jemaine.

12
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:35,517
He's taking up three seats.
He's got shopping bags with him.

13
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,653
- Well, you can't count the shopping bags, can you?
- There's three seats used.

14
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:41,389
What, so the majority of the
audience is shopping bags?

15
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:43,358
Yeah, most of the audience
are shopping bags.

16
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:44,726
But don't look
at it that way.

17
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:47,328
Iook at it that there's
three seats taken.

18
00:00:47,396 --> 00:00:49,330
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Okay.

19
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:52,800
Just give this one big guy with the
shopping bags the best gig of his life.

20
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:54,903
<i>Rock it out.</i>

21
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:02,343
One person.

22
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:04,512
This is a new low.

23
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:37,178
¶ voodoo lover! ¶

24
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:41,115
thank you.
Thank you...

25
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:43,585
especially the one audience
member for coming along today.

26
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:46,554
Hey, when did he go?

27
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:48,523
When did that guy leave?

28
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:50,658
Yeah, he...
he snuck out.

29
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:52,193
Possibly as early
as the first song.

30
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:54,362
So we played this whole gig
to an empty room?

31
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,864
Technically yes.

32
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:57,632
Well, technically
you were there.

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,301
Technically I actually
snuck out as well.

34
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,637
- You snuck out?
- What do you mean you snuck out?

35
00:02:02,738 --> 00:02:04,639
I knew you were gonna get
angry. Don't single me out.

36
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,041
What about the other guy?
He snuck out.

37
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:09,477
<i>- He's not our manager though.</i>
- I know.

38
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:12,580
You've got to question yourselves.
Why is the audience gone?

39
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:15,416
Why is the manager gone?
What's he doing leaving?

40
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:17,418
Well, you went shopping.

41
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:19,621
Oh, yeah.

42
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:22,957
Anyway, zero people.

43
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:25,159
This is a new low.

44
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,467
All right, it's time to get
the high points

45
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:34,269
and low points graph out.

46
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:37,171
And unfortunately,
as of yesterday,

47
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:38,506
we've hit
a new low point...

48
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:40,642
doing a gig to nobody.

49
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,911
Pass it around.

50
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:45,246
- That's the graph.
- It's at zero.

51
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:47,315
Wow. What's that
high point?

52
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:50,084
Yeah, that's when I didn't
have to pay the meter.

53
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:52,854
Remember the meter was broken when
I parked outside your apartment?

54
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:54,556
That's the high point
of our career?

55
00:02:54,623 --> 00:02:57,859
That is the high point
of us as a band

56
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,427
in our career so far.

57
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:01,429
I still think
about it now.

58
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:03,264
It was such a great night.

59
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:05,133
But we're not
concentrating on that now.

60
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,303
Those times are gone. We're in
the low now. We're in the lull.

61
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,305
Well, how come no one
comes to our gigs?

62
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:13,341
I've tried to rack my brains
to find that answe Bret.

63
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,777
I think we're gonna
have to face facts.

64
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:17,979
You guys just don't
look cool.

65
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,847
L- I do.

66
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:21,416
<i>- No you don't.</i>
- No.

67
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:24,185
- Don't I?
- You may look cool in your mind,

68
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,554
but when other people
are looking at you

69
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:28,389
they don't see what's
happening inside your head.

70
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:30,158
Okay? They can only see the outer shell.

71
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:31,726
It doesn't matter anyway.

72
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:33,528
It's about the music,
not about the way you look.

73
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:35,396
Maybe in the '70s, guys.

74
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:37,498
But come on, get up
with the '90s.

75
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:40,201
- Times have changed.
- It's not the '90s.

76
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:43,371
Okay, my point is the
difference between cool bands

77
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,340
and you is hair.

78
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:47,709
- I've got hair.
- True.

79
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:51,045
But most of your hair is
body hair, isn't is, Jemaine?

80
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:52,680
Well, some of it.

81
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:54,415
Iook at this.

82
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:57,752
Style.
That's what we need.

83
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,889
- I know what you're gonna say.
- Uh...

84
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:03,191
I knew you were gonna say
that. But this is the stuff.

85
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,093
Styling gel, okay?

86
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,363
Have a look at these.

87
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:11,733
<i>What's this?</i>

88
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,234
<i>Just some experiments I ran</i>

89
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:15,770
<i>back in 1991 when I was</i>
trying to find my look.

90
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,605
You should dress
like this more often.

91
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:20,074
- No, I've found my look now.
- And that's your look?

92
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:21,175
Yup, this is
the winning look.

93
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:23,678
A moss-green shirt
and a tie?

94
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:25,580
Obviously this
is for work.

95
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:27,882
Up here is for play,
isn't it?

96
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,018
No, this is it.
This is the stuff.

97
00:04:30,085 --> 00:04:32,854
I really enjoyed it. The only
problem is it's very powerful.

98
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:35,623
- Okay? It takes hold of you.
- Knock knock.

99
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:37,425
Morning, prime minister.

100
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:39,194
Guys, sit down,
sit down.

101
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:40,962
Thank you, m'lord.

102
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,897
Murray, have you
got an eraser?

103
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,432
I'm doing a drawing
but I've made a mistake.

104
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,235
I'm working on a poster idea
for my new campaign.

105
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:49,404
<i>- That is a good poster, sir.</i>
- Not bad.

106
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:51,873
How about you guys? Are you
excited about new zealandtown?

107
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:53,942
- What's that?
- Oh, I was gonna mention that.

108
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:56,811
Well, you know Chinatown
and little Italy, right?

109
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,514
- Yeah.
- Well, we want to establish a new zealandtown

110
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:02,717
- right here in new York city.
- Where's it gonna be?

111
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:05,820
Well, it's gonna be one block
between Chinatown and little Italy,

112
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:07,956
which isn't exactly
accurate geographically,

113
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,657
but it's perfect
for our needs.

114
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,526
We're gonna have
Gary the sheep.

115
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:13,294
- He's flying over from new zealand.
- Really?

116
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:15,396
Yes, new zealand's most
famous sheep is gonna be there.

117
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:17,665
<i>- He's on hiatus.</i>
- We have a chap shearing him.

118
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,834
- Well, pretending to shear him.
- Be mime shearing him.

119
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,237
Mime shearing him because
Gary's got his look.

120
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:25,139
We can't mess with that.
And while I'm on that,

121
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:29,143
um, what we need is
a cool band to play there.

122
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:31,512
And I know you guys are
sometimes involved in music,

123
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,948
- so what I was gonna ask...
- would you like us to play?

124
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:36,651
- Well, no, we're looking for a cool band.
- They are available.

125
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,287
We're considered
quite cool, aren't we?

126
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:41,623
<i>- In their minds, yes.</i>
- I see.

127
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,825
<i>- Yeah, you want a cooler band.</i>
- No, exactly.

128
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:47,095
If you really want to help, we do need
someone to work the information booth.

129
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:49,297
<i>- You guys keen?</i>
- No.

130
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:50,965
Great.

131
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:53,001
<i>Hey, greg, have you</i>
got an eraser?

132
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:56,304
Did you hear that, guys? The prime
minister is looking for a cool band.

133
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,643
Don't touch it.

134
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:04,746
Ew!

135
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:12,153
How's that?

136
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,289
That looks cool.

137
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:26,501
- Whoa, that is cool.
- Yeah?

138
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,203
You look like a punk rocker.

139
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:31,005
Quite cool.

140
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,716
- Very cool.
- Very cool look, man.

141
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:47,355
<i>Totally cool.</i>

142
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:52,527
- Pretty cool.
- Cool.

178
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:47,642
Murray, wow, these guys
are pretty cool.

179
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,043
Who are they?

180
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,379
That's Bret and Jemaine.
You know, my band.

181
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,047
They're bloody great.

182
00:08:56,986 --> 00:08:59,721
You guys seem a little
cooler than usual today.

183
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:01,556
Yeah, we're a little
bit cooler now.

184
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,358
Yeah, usually you wear
clothes from the '70s.

185
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,693
They're not from the '70s.
They're from new zealand.

186
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:07,662
Isn't that the same thing?

187
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,564
Similar, I suppose.

188
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,634
- Hey, guys. Whoa, looking cool.
- Whatever, Murray.

189
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:15,169
Hey, great gig last night.
You got a glowing review.

190
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:16,804
"New zealand consulate
newsletter"...

191
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:19,173
"they came, they saw,
they conchord.

192
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:22,176
A couple of cool guys took to
the stage and wowed the audience

193
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:24,445
with music and up-
to-the-minute styles.

194
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,382
Move over, refrigerators,
here's what's cool."

195
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:29,284
- That's pretty cool, man.
- You like that?

196
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:31,319
- Yeah.
- The best part is the prime minister wants you

197
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:33,821
to perform at the new
zealandtown opening ceremony.

198
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:36,391
Oh, that's cool,
but yeah, whatever.

199
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,726
I've got to go. You guys want
to hang out tomorrow still or...

200
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:41,029
- whatever, man.
- Whatever, David.

201
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:44,432
- G'day, you guys. Cool hair.
- Hey.

202
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,768
Wow, you're gonna make quite an
impact with that hair, aren't you?

203
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:49,337
<i>- Oh, yeah, that hair.</i>
- That hair there is whoo.

204
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:51,806
Nice attitude, Jemaine.
I like it.

205
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:54,242
- Go away, Murray.
- "Go away."

206
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,678
Did you hear that,
prime minister? So cool.

207
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:58,913
Anyway, I'd like you
all to meet Paula.

208
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:01,049
Paula's the new zealand
tourism board representative

209
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:04,419
and she's gonna be working with us on the
new zealandtown opening day celebration.

210
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:06,688
- Yeah.
- Hello, I'm Murray.

211
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:09,090
- Paula, Murray.
- Stop shaking her hand.

212
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,559
Paula grew up next to me.

213
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:13,761
- 39 harcourt street, Nelson.
- Yeah.

214
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:16,297
Mind you, that was all
a very very long time ago.

215
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:18,967
- Many many years ago now.
- Oh, yes, years.

216
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,236
A lot's happened since then.
Things change.

217
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:23,438
- Yeah.
- People get married to other people.

218
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:25,573
Yeah.

219
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:28,776
Anyway, Murray, Paula's
second in command after me

220
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,278
and then you
and then greg.

221
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:31,713
Oh.

222
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,449
So if I wanted to, I could
tell her to do something

223
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:36,150
and then she'd tell
you to do it.

224
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,953
- But I could tell greg.
- That's at your discretion.

225
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:41,155
Let's just test out this
new system, shall we?

226
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:43,491
Paula, could you please ask
Murray what time it is?

227
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,127
Um, hey, Murray,
have you got the time?

228
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,929
2:00.

229
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:49,330
It's 2:00,
prime minister.

230
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,999
Yes, I heard
and I think he heard me.

231
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,834
On a basic level
this works,

232
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,669
but I think we could use
more development.

233
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,405
Anyway, I'll see you
later, guys.

234
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:59,774
And did you ask Jemaine
about that thing?

235
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:01,109
Not yet.

236
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:03,077
- See you guys.
- Bye, guys.

237
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,179
What thing?

238
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,483
It's... we'll talk about it
soon during the band meeting.

239
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,652
Right, band meeting.

240
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,487
Jemaine, present.
Bret?

241
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:14,522
- Yeah, whatever.
- Okay, whatever.

242
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,491
Murray, present.

243
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,160
Now with
the new zealandtown,

244
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:21,696
I've decided we should really
look at our cultural heritage.

245
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,865
I think we should have
a traditional maori village.

246
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,968
You know, get a couple of maoris standing
there in their natural environment.

247
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:28,236
But this is new York.

248
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:30,405
Yeah, well, we'll get
some bushes in.

249
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,941
We'll get a log. Get some
wind running through it.

250
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:35,977
I think the most important
part is to get a maori warrior.

251
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:39,614
That would really sell it. So
do we know any maoris, Jemaine?

252
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:41,950
Actually, you're part
maori, aren't you?

253
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,718
No, I'm not doing it.

254
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,788
- But you are part maori?
- Yes, but I'm not doing it.

255
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:49,057
- Please?
- No.

256
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:51,793
- Please be the maori.
- No.

257
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:53,995
Well, if you don't do it we're
gonna have to get Mexicans.

258
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:55,563
You can't get
Mexicans to do it.

259
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:57,131
That's culturally
insensitive.

260
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,968
We've already signed one up
so it can't be too sensitive.

261
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:02,136
<i>Is he gonna do it?</i>

262
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:05,173
No, prime minister,
he's not gonna do it.

263
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,009
See you later, guys.

264
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:10,778
- Whatever.
- See ya, Murray.

265
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:17,919
Good morning, Jemaine.

266
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,587
Your hair doesn't
look very cool.

267
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,256
What? Why didn't you
tell me earlier?

268
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,758
<i>- Oh, yours looks bad.</i>
- Does it?

269
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,594
- I need a bit more gel.
- Pass me the hair gel.

270
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,665
Hey, where's the gel gone?

271
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,233
What happened
to all the gel?

272
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:34,903
What do you mean, what happened
to the gel? It was in there.

273
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,971
You know what happened
to the gel. You used it.

274
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,040
Did you finish the gel
on your body hair?

275
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:41,376
N... no.

276
00:12:41,443 --> 00:12:43,511
You've been
gelling your beard.

277
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,680
Your beard looks good.

278
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:48,216
- You used my half of the gel.
- What are you doing?

279
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:50,585
<i>What are you doing?</i>
Put it down.

280
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:53,354
Oh! That was
very dangerous.

281
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:55,423
- How dare you throw this at me?
- Do not throw that at me.

282
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:58,059
I think it's a fitting revenge
for you throwing it at me.

283
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,727
Oh!

284
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:01,496
That was dangerous.

285
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:05,266
Paula, how many toothbrushes
have we got so far

286
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,268
for the replica of
the toothbrush fence?

287
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:10,738
46. but I know someone who's
bringing in another two.

288
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:13,174
Yeah, well,
that's still not 50

289
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:16,311
and we need 50 really
for an effective replica.

290
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,814
Can you talk to Murray
about organizing some more?

291
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,216
Murray?

292
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:23,451
Um, okay.

293
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,688
Hi, everyone.
We need more toothbrushes.

294
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,593
<i>- I'll bring one in.</i>
- Thanks, greg.

295
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,994
Good work, Paula.

296
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,596
Thank you.

297
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:38,099
Now, Murray, the attractions...
how are they coming along?

298
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,735
Well, I've booked you
a tour bus

299
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:42,904
to take all the people
through new zealandtown.

300
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:45,573
Great. Excellent.
Can I drive the bus?

301
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,609
Don't think that's
a very good idea.

302
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:49,577
The prime minister of
new zealand driving a bus?

303
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,145
Please?

304
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:54,349
Please, Murray?

305
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,518
- All right then.
- Excellent.

306
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,486
I get to drive
the tour bus.

307
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:00,355
Well, Gary,
you must be jet-lagged.

308
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,223
Let's get you off to
your accommodations.

309
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,626
Did you ever think I'd end up
being prime minister, Paula?

310
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:06,461
No. Complete surprise
to me.

311
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:16,504
Maybe we should go
get some more gel.

312
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:18,673
- We can't go out there.
- Why not?

313
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:21,376
There's people. They'll see
us. No one can see me like this.

314
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,312
- You go.
- No, I can't go out there.

315
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,015
Not without gel.

316
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:29,050
We'll wait till
there's no one out there.

317
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,885
Who is it?

318
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,587
- Who is it, Bret?
- Who is it?!

319
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:07,722
Come on, cool dudes,
open up, it's me.

320
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,925
<i>- You can't co in.</i>
- What? Am I not cool enough for you now?

321
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,228
- We've run out of gel.
- What?

322
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:14,863
Open up, come on.

323
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,664
We've run out of gel.
We look stupid.

324
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:18,399
I'm sure you don't look
that stupid. Open up.

325
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:24,005
Oh my God!
Oh, it's terrible.

326
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,607
What have you done?

327
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,342
We've used all
that gel you gave us.

328
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:30,078
- The whole bottle?
- Can you get us some more gel?

329
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:31,880
Yeah, all right.
I've got things to do.

330
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:33,348
I've got to go to
the quarantine,

331
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:35,216
pick up the grass patch
for new zealandtown.

332
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:36,918
I'll get you some gel on
the way back, all right?

333
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:39,687
Close that door and don't
let anyone see you.

334
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:43,758
There's still some gel.

335
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:45,760
There's still a little
bit of gel.

336
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,996
- You're imagining the gel.
- There's still some.

337
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:49,597
There's no gel left.
It's not there.

338
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:54,636
<i>Where is he?</i>

339
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,139
He's probably
just dropped the gel

340
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,942
and he's had to go back
and get some more.

341
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,878
What if he's keeping
the gel for himself

342
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:05,713
to make himself
look good?

343
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:11,619
Don't think so, man.

344
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:15,657
That big ginger head
of his

345
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,392
looking great.

346
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,494
<i>Welcome, everybody.</i>

347
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:22,463
Cheers.

348
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:23,998
You'd better hide
that beer, sir.

349
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,466
You can't drink
in public over here.

350
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,302
Well, we're in
new zealandtown now.

351
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:28,803
There's nothing
they can do about it.

352
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:31,272
Actually, bryan, you can't
drink and drive either.

353
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,542
Oh, you're quite right.
Thank you, Paula.

354
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,913
Well, I'm bryan

355
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:40,348
the prime minister
of new zealand

356
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,984
and, um...

357
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:46,321
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm just
a little bit nervous.

358
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:48,122
I haven't done this
r a while.

359
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,125
- The attractions.
- Oh, Murray, thank yo

360
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:54,529
yes, well, we've got
a few interesting things

361
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,265
to show you on our journey
to new zealand so...

362
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,101
let's go.

363
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:11,779
Oh my goodness me. Iook
at that. Quiet, everyone.

364
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:16,017
<i>It's some genuine native</i>
maori warriors.

365
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:18,987
We don't want to disturb
them in their natural habitat.

366
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:22,323
If you'd like to take pictures,
do it very very quietly.

367
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,293
<i>All right, if everyone's</i>
finished taking pictures,

368
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:27,562
let's move on.

369
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:32,634
<i>Okay, everybody off.</i>

370
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:35,436
That was new zealandtown.

371
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:51,452
Oh.

372
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,189
This place
is really a mess.

373
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,093
Some milk for my piggies.

374
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:06,501
<i>Mel?</i>

375
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:09,270
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?

376
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,173
You're supposed to be at your band
meeting for the new zealandtown opening.

377
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:13,741
Do you have a key
to our apartment?

378
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:16,611
This isn't my place,
is it?

379
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:19,047
This is your place.

380
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:21,516
I must be sleepwalking.

381
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:23,551
Oh no, don't wake me.
You could kill me.

382
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,222
Do you have any gel?

383
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,990
Um, I don't know.

384
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:30,992
I might have
some mousse maybe.

385
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,961
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Or some hairspray.

386
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,430
Yeah, just a little
mousse would be good.

387
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:39,300
Bird watching.
I love to watch birds.

388
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,236
Where's your mousse?
Is it not in here?

389
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:42,737
Maybe not
in this pocket.

390
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:45,540
This is my sock.

391
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:49,043
Oh, well... I guess
I don't have any, guys.

392
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:51,646
- You said you had some.
- I said I thought I might have some.

393
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:55,216
You said you had mousse.
Jemaine, she said she had mousse.

394
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:57,285
I'd better go
before I wake up.

395
00:18:57,353 --> 00:19:00,722
You come in here without any
mousse? What's wrong with you?

396
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:04,292
I don't know
who you are anymore.

397
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,728
Do you have any gel, Mel?

398
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,165
There's a little bit
in here.

399
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:12,934
Bret.

400
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:14,502
Glue?

401
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,438
- This should work.
- Yeah yeah, this is good.

402
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:20,074
It's just like gel.

403
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:22,076
Same viscosity.

404
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:27,682
Welcome, everyone.

405
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,051
Now new zealand
has always been

406
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,554
a land of innovators.

407
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:34,989
We were the first country
in the world

408
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:38,626
to research and develop the
concept of a spreadable butter

409
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:41,429
that can be used straight
from the refrigerator.

410
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:44,499
So it's in that great
spirit of innovation

411
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:45,900
that we are gathered
here today

412
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:49,003
to celebrate the opening
of new zealandtown.

413
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:52,440
Like Chinatown
or little ethiopia,

414
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:55,677
and also similar
to little Italy.

415
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:58,513
Jemaine, I stuck
my head to my hand.

416
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:01,349
<i>- You idiot, Bret.</i>
- You've got a pillow on your head.

417
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:02,717
<i>- What? Where?</i>
- Other side.

418
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:05,353
- Oh, we're both idiots.
- Idiot, man.

419
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:10,692
What are you sitting there
so relaxed for, Bret?

420
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,493
And get that cushion off
your head, Jemaine.

421
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:15,630
We had no gel
so we used glue instead.

422
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:17,465
<i>You were supposed</i>
to bring us some gel.

423
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,167
Shivers,
I forgot your gel.

424
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:21,669
Iook, I've been so caught up
with new zealandtown.

425
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:24,205
<i>Iook, I'll solve it.</i>

426
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:26,241
Hi, greg, I need
some anti-glue.

427
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,009
<i>What's anti-glue,</i>
Murray?

428
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:30,645
Well, it's anti-glue, isn't
it? It gets rid of glue.

429
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,981
<i>I don't think</i>
that exists, Murray.

430
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:34,682
Just get it, okay?
It's an emergency.

431
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,352
Thank you.

432
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:39,087
<i>Now please,</i>
can you get ready?

433
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:41,022
You don't need us. You've got
new zealand's most famous sheep.

434
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,857
Well, that's the whole
thing, Jemaine. I don't.

435
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:44,459
He's been shorn off.

436
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:46,828
The guy who was supposed to mime
shear him sheared him for real.

437
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:49,163
- He's basically bald.
- Gary's bald?

438
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:52,367
Yes. So there's your
star, timid and nervous.

439
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:55,103
And to make matters worse, the
guy next to him barbecuing...

440
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,838
I think he's
barbecuing lamb.

441
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:59,274
Gary can tell.
He's livid.

442
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,509
And by the way, who's manning
the information booth?

443
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:03,278
What side of the road
do you drive on?

444
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:05,413
The middle.

445
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,749
What language do you
speak there?

446
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:10,351
We pretty much just make it
up as we go along.

447
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:11,920
Really?

448
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:14,722
Yeah, that's why the people from
there are so hard to understand.

449
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,092
<i>We can't do it.</i>
We're not cool enough.

450
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,794
Guys, do you want
to know a secret?

451
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:23,097
It wasn't the gel
that made you cool.

452
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:25,533
It wasn't?

453
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:29,437
It was the confidence
the gel gave you.

454
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,773
When you started to feel
good about yourself

455
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,175
everyone else
could feel that.

456
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:36,744
And they started to
feel good about you.

457
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:39,614
Really?

458
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:41,149
Maybe.

459
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,851
Bret,

460
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:45,320
I think we've got
a gig to perform.

461
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,556
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Get us the anti-glue.

462
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:52,794
All right then.

463
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:55,897
Who likes to
"rock the party"?

464
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:03,104
Now it gives me great
pleasure and pride

465
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:06,608
to introduce two of the coolest
new zealanders I have ever met,

466
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:09,978
our very own
flight of the conchords.

467
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,352
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

468
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:33,968
¶ I like to rock
the party ¶

469
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:35,803
¶ party going on ¶

470
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:38,573
¶ and it looks like... ¶

471
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:43,478
yeah, it was the hair gel, guys. Sorry.

472
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:45,847
- We're not cool?
- No.

473
00:22:45,915 --> 00:22:48,116
This is a new low,
isn't it?

474
00:22:48,184 --> 00:22:49,484
Yeah.

475
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:52,554
Murray, what happened
to new zealandtown?

476
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:55,557
This was
a complete disaster.

477
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,092
Well, I thought that was
relatively successful.

478
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,361
Yes, it went very well.
Well done, Paula.

479
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:03,965
I think I'm gonna head back to my hotel
'cause I've got to fly out in the morning.

480
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:05,934
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

481
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:07,669
Okay.

482
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:09,737
<i>- Nice to meet you.</i>
- Bye.

483
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,806
Yeah.

484
00:23:11,874 --> 00:23:14,075
- Paula.
- Yes, bryan?

485
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,844
Um, I...

486
00:23:19,515 --> 00:23:21,583
nothing.

487
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:24,652
Okay.

488
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:32,560
Forget it, bryan.
It's new zealandtown.
