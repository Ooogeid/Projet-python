1
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:11,260
Bill, slow down, please.

2
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:14,096
Stop this. You're scaring me.

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,420
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,383
She promised she was just
gonna look in the window.

5
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:27,318
I know I made a mistake,
but they're her family.

6
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,089
She is a vampire.
She has no family.

7
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:33,074
I'm a monster and I'm gonna
be alone forever because of you.

8
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:34,900
I hate you so fucking much.

9
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:36,327
- Be quiet.
- Eat shit.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,187
I said, be quiet!

11
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,000
You undermined
my authority as her maker.

12
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:46,238
You risked those peoples' safety
and your own.

13
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:49,131
If I had not glamoured them
within an inch of their sanity,

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,758
our lives wouldbe shattered.

15
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,678
- I know. I'm sorry.
- You keep saying that!

16
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,764
And I am expected to what?
Forget this ever happened?

17
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,067
What else would you like me to say?

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,394
I knew I should say no,

19
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,746
but all I could think about was Gran

20
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:05,855
and what I'd give to see her again.

21
00:01:06,103 --> 00:01:07,877
That does not give you
license to behave

22
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:09,573
like an irresponsible child.

23
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,248
She is a loaded gun, Sookie.

24
00:01:12,587 --> 00:01:14,740
Not a doll for you to dress up
and play with.

25
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,326
- What are you doing?
- Walking!

26
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:21,504
Don't be ridiculous. Bon Temps
is nearly 20 miles away.

27
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:24,792
I'd rather walk all night
than spend another second with you.

28
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,530
She wants you to go after her.

29
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,491
And she wants you
to go after her and kiss her

30
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:40,485
and tell her that you love her.

31
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:43,369
She will come back.

32
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:46,998
When she calms down

33
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:50,275
she will come back.

34
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:15,260
If you're trying to scare me
so I get back with you,

35
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,761
it isn't gonna work.

36
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,556
What the...?

37
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,177
AB+ Team

38
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:14,778
Arrow, mpm for the sub factory.

39
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,446
What did this to you?

40
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:43,781
Bull... Human...

41
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,417
I couldn't see...

42
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,771
Bill, I can't move.

43
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,079
Oh, gross.

44
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,012
Get the car, now!

45
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,437
- Drive straight home.
- But I wanna go with you.

46
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:15,147
As your maker, I command you.

47
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:43,185
I'm short.

48
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,923
I went over it three times.
I don't know what happened...

49
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:47,048
How much?

50
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:49,979
Sixty-four dollars and,

51
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,544
like, 8 cents.

52
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,697
God dammit, Daphne,
you're gonna have to pay for it.

53
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,692
I'm sorry, but this is a business.

54
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:06,222
There.

55
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:09,651
That's all the tips
that I made tonight,

56
00:06:10,392 --> 00:06:12,162
so I'm just gonna have
to owe you the rest.

57
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,530
Fuck.

58
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:24,226
You can't ask her to learn if you don't
give her any positive reinforcement.

59
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,641
- Tara, not now.
- I'm serious.

60
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:29,959
Nobody succeeds at anything in life
unless somebody leads them.

61
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,635
Let me guess.

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,847
Maryann say that?

63
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:35,815
What is it with you and Maryann?
What's she ever done to you,

64
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,605
other than just drop almost
$300 in your bar tonight?

65
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:41,300
I don't want her in here anymore.

66
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:44,402
And if I were you,

67
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:47,738
- I'd stay the hell away from her.
- You don't even know this person.

68
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:48,824
Neither do you.

69
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:14,048
What kind of...

70
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:15,433
doctor are you?

71
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:17,311
The healing kind.

72
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,229
I'm Doctor Ludwig, what's your...

73
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:22,826
Miss Sookie Stackhouse.

74
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:26,943
- Am I dying?
- Yes.

75
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,155
No. She cannot die.

76
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,408
You will save her.

77
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,742
Back off, vampire, let me do my job.

78
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,229
Forgive him.

79
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,755
Bill is abnormally
attached to this human.

80
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,069
Well, we don't have a lot of choices,
she's been poisoned.

81
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,531
You ever heard of Komodo dragons?

82
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,274
Their mouths are teeming
with bacteria.

83
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:47,216
After one has bitten you,

84
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,194
it will track you for hours,

85
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,260
days, just waiting for the toxins

86
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,305
to slowly eat away
at your nervous system

87
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:56,849
till you're good and helpless.
Then it will devour you alive.

88
00:07:57,124 --> 00:07:59,024
I was scratched by a dragon?

89
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,398
But this poison is similar
but way more efficient.

90
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,328
I think I've seen it before,
but it's hard to tell without testing,

91
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,320
and we don't have that kind of time.

92
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:12,225
Give us some privacy.
I need to remove her clothing.

93
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,323
I will be just outside.

94
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,791
I am so sorry.

95
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:24,378
She's running out of time,
Mr. Compton.

96
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:31,828
Head of a bull.

97
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,547
That's what she said.

98
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:34,972
It was dark.

99
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:36,928
It all happened in seconds.

100
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:39,194
So you didn't see this, bull man?

101
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:43,760
And you gave her your blood?

102
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,358
It didn't work.

103
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:50,289
- You ever heard of anything like this?
- Surprisingly, no.

104
00:08:57,467 --> 00:09:00,497
I thought in over a thousand years
I'd seen everything there was to see.

105
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:06,739
Search the woods around highway 71.

106
00:09:07,072 --> 00:09:09,423
He can do it.
I'm wearing my favorite pumps.

107
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:17,259
She is extremely lazy.

108
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
But loyal.

109
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:20,751
How's yours?

110
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,264
Petulant.

111
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:24,389
Dangerous.

112
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:25,939
Afraid.

113
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:28,968
I'm glad to see you two are bonding.

114
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:31,547
Being a good maker
is very rewarding.

115
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:35,015
- I have to get back to Sookie.
- Oh, relax.

116
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,493
Dr. Ludwig treated one of Pam's humans
when it was mauled by a werewolf.

117
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:41,371
Lost an eye,
but otherwise he's fine.

118
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,294
What are you doing?

119
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,462
Hold her down!

120
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:50,764
Or let her die, your choice.

121
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,871
You're so warm.

122
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,273
And I'm so cold.

123
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,059
What are you doing here, Jason?

124
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:35,634
I thought we were friends.

125
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:38,802
You're fucking dead.

126
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:40,752
I saw you die.

127
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,635
This ain't real.
This ain't real.

128
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,770
Does this feel real?

129
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:05,657
Dear God,

130
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,083
you gotta help me out,

131
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:09,235
because,

132
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:12,181
I don't know what's right
and wrong no more.

133
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:15,309
Maybe I never did.

134
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,469
God, please.

135
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:23,633
Please. Give me another sign.

136
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:25,568
Because...

137
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:28,027
I'm lost.

138
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:31,648
I'm so fucking lost.

139
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:35,304
There's your sign.

140
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:37,984
Now, shut up.
Someone's trying to sleep in here.

141
00:11:57,086 --> 00:12:00,228
You can give her blood now.
Her body should accept it.

142
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:05,618
Mine is much stronger, allow me.

143
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:06,743
Never.

144
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,149
Sookie, can you hear me?

145
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:15,734
You must drink.

146
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,338
I'll expect my payment
by the end of the week.

147
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:34,169
It's always a pleasure
doing business with you, Dr. Ludwig.

148
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:36,630
Clearly the pleasure was one-sided.

149
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:39,178
Well, she's no fan of the fang.

150
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:41,377
She tolerates us,

151
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,131
because our blood is of such
great value to healers.

152
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:47,478
Be careful.

153
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:49,226
You'll overcook her.

154
00:12:57,188 --> 00:12:58,746
- All right.
- Thank you.

155
00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:10,516
The area has been scanned.

156
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:13,457
Tracks were human,
but the smell was distinctly animal.

157
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:14,703
What kind?

158
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,939
- A filthy one.
- We didn't recognize it.

159
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,293
How intriguing.

160
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:20,673
Send an alert through
the appropriate channels.

161
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:22,615
Find out what the neighbors know.

162
00:13:24,076 --> 00:13:25,076
And Pam.

163
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,598
Those were great pumps.

164
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,150
- I don't wanna move her.
- Of course not.

165
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:40,366
I'll make sure she's taken care of.

166
00:13:40,491 --> 00:13:41,903
I'm not leaving her.

167
00:13:42,636 --> 00:13:44,786
Longshadow kept a coffin in back.

168
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,040
He liked to feed before resting,
so it might be a bit messy,

169
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:50,397
but you're welcome to it.

170
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:55,711
I wanna thank you
for your hospitality.

171
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,339
And for saving Sookie's life.

172
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,858
I'm sure there's a way
she can repay me.

173
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:22,254
That's delicious.

174
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:24,210
Could use a little more juniper.

175
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:26,119
Yes, of course.
You're right.

176
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:39,645
What's all this?

177
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:42,644
I'm having a few people over.

178
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:44,296
How many people?

179
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:46,218
You know, I don't remember.

180
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,155
Karl will make you some breakfast.

181
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,817
That's okay. I'm more
of a breakfast-for-lunch kind of girl.

182
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,544
But coffee's great.
Thanks, Karl.

183
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:59,397
I don't think I'll ever
get used to people

184
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:01,838
just doing things for me
without me even asking.

185
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,353
Well, Karl knows that if he wants
to find real fulfillment in life,

186
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:08,107
he need to learn to be of service,

187
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:10,626
so everything he does for us
is really a selfish act.

188
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:13,787
Maryann, why does Sam hate you?

189
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:15,592
Sam hates me?

190
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,633
Practically jumped down my throat
after you left last night.

191
00:15:18,837 --> 00:15:21,764
Kept saying I need to stay away
from you, why would he say that?

192
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:24,349
Well...

193
00:15:24,895 --> 00:15:25,895
I mean,

194
00:15:26,222 --> 00:15:27,822
I barely know the man,

195
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:31,046
but if I had to guess,

196
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:32,389
I'd say jealousy.

197
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,093
- You two have a history.
- Yeah, but we're better as friends

198
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:37,727
than we ever were at sleeping together.
We both know that.

199
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:42,095
Still not valuing yourself.

200
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:45,402
You are a fantastic woman.

201
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:47,548
Sam lost you.

202
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,283
He's just looking
for someone to blame.

203
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:53,076
But why you?

204
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,172
Because you've moved on.

205
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,124
And hopefully I've been
a part of making that happen.

206
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:01,084
Sam seems

207
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,004
like a sensitive, wonderful guy,

208
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,257
but all my instincts scream,
"unevolved."

209
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:11,803
You're right. That man has way
too many issues.

210
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:14,222
And they are not your problem.

211
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,188
Unlike Karl,

212
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:19,002
you've done enough taking care of people
to last a lifetime.

213
00:16:20,248 --> 00:16:22,360
Holy shit, that's beautiful.

214
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:25,020
It's even got a filter?

215
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:27,235
Little technique
I picked up in Ibiza.

216
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,634
Adorable, isn't it?

217
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:34,947
Fuck it. I don't have
to be at work till 4:00.

218
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:54,262
Thanks for coming.

219
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:57,307
Taking a trip?

220
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,434
Something like that.

221
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,061
Where to?

222
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,714
Not sure yet.

223
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:03,647
Well,

224
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,765
I ain't been a lot of places,

225
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,470
but better here
than all the places I've been.

226
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:13,599
So listen, I was hoping
you'd take care of the bar for me.

227
00:17:13,988 --> 00:17:15,700
You know, just till I get back.

228
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:20,756
I don't know, Sam.

229
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,415
I like cooking.

230
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:24,274
It's quiet back there and...

231
00:17:25,717 --> 00:17:27,617
I ain't so good with people.

232
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:31,132
If I were you,
I wouldn't be my first choice.

233
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,188
Well, actually, you're not.

234
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:35,054
I can't reach Sookie.

235
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,264
And who knows where the hell
Lafayette is,

236
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,619
Arlene's got enough on her plate,

237
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:43,477
- and Tara... Tara's...
- Don't like feeling the pressure.

238
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:47,220
She's going through some
personal stuff right now.

239
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:48,883
So you're all I got.

240
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,487
You do it for me, buddy?

241
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,129
Well, I guess I ain't got no choice.

242
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,459
I appreciate it.

243
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,367
Appreciate it, I'll get you
a set of keys after closing.

244
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,376
So you're just gonna cut and run.

245
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:07,711
Just like that.

246
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:10,255
I'm not running.

247
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:13,340
Remind me never to get stuck
in a foxhole

248
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,510
with you.

249
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:17,681
Coward.

250
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,252
He used me up.

251
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,429
Till he got bored.

252
00:18:35,376 --> 00:18:37,071
And then he left me to die.

253
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:43,607
I thought he loved me,

254
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,428
but I was nothing,

255
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:48,027
but his

256
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:49,465
living,

257
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:51,947
breathing, snack machine.

258
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,469
Thank you for sharing
your story, Missy.

259
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,541
That was very brave.

260
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,140
May his holy light shine on you.

261
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:04,319
Praise the light.

262
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,319
Praise...

263
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,323
light.

264
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:09,439
Would you like to share?

265
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,807
No, thank you.

266
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:14,436
I ain't much of a sharing
kind of guy.

267
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,691
Remember, we all signed
a vow of honesty.

268
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:19,949
Are you wearing your honesty ring?

269
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,796
All right, but,
you ain't gonna like it.

270
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:31,581
Pretty much goes against everything

271
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:32,949
y'all been saying.

272
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:34,757
You're safe here.

273
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:40,568
I ain't a vampire victim.

274
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:44,241
The fact is they have never
done nothing against me.

275
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,353
My sister's dating one,

276
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:50,063
and from everything I can tell,
he seems to treat her pretty decent.

277
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:51,906
Well, except for the biting,

278
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:53,316
but I think she likes that.

279
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,266
- Please.
- What?

280
00:19:58,023 --> 00:19:59,023
Go on.

281
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:08,790
My girlfriend, she staked a vampire
right in front of me.

282
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,620
His name was Eddie,

283
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:12,545
and...

284
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,340
he was gay,

285
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:17,895
but he was a real nice person.

286
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,426
He wasn't a person, Jason.

287
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,604
A person wouldn't do that.

288
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:25,832
Would they?

289
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:31,884
Well, my Gran and my girlfriend
were killed by my best friend

290
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,800
just because he had a problem
with vampires.

291
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:37,782
And he was a person.

292
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:48,098
Look,

293
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,500
I'm only here because
I thought God wanted me to be.

294
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,971
Thought maybe he had

295
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,644
a purpose for me.

296
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,213
Some shit like that.

297
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:01,531
Beginning to see
that was just wishful thinking.

298
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,095
No, Jason, wait.

299
00:21:04,822 --> 00:21:06,959
- Becky, take over for a second.
- Sure.

300
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:08,683
Let's pray.

301
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:13,006
- Just talk to me.
- There ain't nothing to talk about.

302
00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:14,188
The first time

303
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,108
I laid eyes on you, I knew there was
something special about this one.

304
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,452
I knew the Lord had sent you to me,

305
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:21,195
but I knew why, today.

306
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,280
Why?

307
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,073
Because we're so much alike.

308
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,871
No, but... We wanna see
the best in others so badly,

309
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,687
that sometimes
we overlook the worst.

310
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,003
That kind of does sound like me.

311
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:39,380
When the vampires came
out of the coffin,

312
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,929
I went with my big sister Amber
to march for their equal rights.

313
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,188
- Really?
- Two months later, Amber disappeared.

314
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:52,602
Got hooked on V.

315
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:55,160
I know they killed her.

316
00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:57,655
Got rid of her body
in whatever way they do.

317
00:22:00,597 --> 00:22:01,597
I'm sorry.

318
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:05,012
They stole my sister.

319
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:10,935
The same way they stole your
girlfriend and your grandmother.

320
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,181
And I know you believe
Eddie was your friend,

321
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:15,570
but think about it.

322
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,693
If his kind never existed,

323
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:19,754
the people you love
would still be alive.

324
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:22,771
You're saying...

325
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:25,727
If I hadn't been too messed up
to protect them,

326
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:28,175
- that they'd still be here?
- No, you're just human,

327
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,680
but vampires...

328
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:32,968
Everything they are,
down to their very blood,

329
00:22:33,093 --> 00:22:34,310
is seductive.

330
00:22:39,418 --> 00:22:41,093
I should have done something.

331
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:45,527
Could have saved Gran, Amy...

332
00:22:47,872 --> 00:22:48,972
All of them.

333
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:51,219
I know how much it hurts.

334
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:53,321
Trust me, that's why...

335
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:55,665
If we can protect even one family

336
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,652
from this kind of suffering,

337
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:59,437
then all the loved ones we've lost,

338
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:01,580
their deaths won't
have been for nothing.

339
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,556
You know, sometimes...

340
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,134
I wish I was dead too.

341
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:14,509
But you're not.

342
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,983
God needs you.

343
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,355
You don't have to carry
this alone anymore.

344
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,026
Give yourself to His light.

345
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:28,488
Let him carry this pain for you.

346
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:31,727
Pray with me?

347
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:43,004
Heavenly Father,

348
00:23:43,223 --> 00:23:44,323
Bless Jason,

349
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,041
and protect his sister,

350
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:51,551
and all those who are still out
there lost in the darkness.

351
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:32,693
You're awake.

352
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,098
I made you a two-top sandwich.

353
00:24:36,247 --> 00:24:37,920
Peanut butter and chocolate syrup.

354
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:39,899
That's very...

355
00:24:40,694 --> 00:24:41,979
thoughtful, Ginger.

356
00:24:43,157 --> 00:24:45,462
That's the thing
about being with vamps, ain't it?

357
00:24:45,587 --> 00:24:47,308
You always forget to eat.

358
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:50,947
I've lost 37 pounds
since I got this job.

359
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:52,876
Way better than a fat farm.

360
00:24:55,638 --> 00:24:56,702
Did Bill leave?

361
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:58,814
He's resting in back, I think.

362
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,862
Do they make you
stay here every day?

363
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:04,314
Well, sometimes I just
come in for deliveries,

364
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,295
but these days
I've been coming in for...

365
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,658
Never mind all that.

366
00:25:12,184 --> 00:25:14,823
You just finish up your sandwich
and go back to sleep.

367
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,348
<i>I almost told her about her friend</i>

368
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,109
<i>Lafayette, in the basement.
Eric says I can't tell her.</i>

369
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,105
Why would Eric have Lafayette
in the basement?

370
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,623
I just work here.

371
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:29,026
<i>Please don't make me use
that gun under the cash register.</i>

372
00:25:34,303 --> 00:25:35,553
Take me to him!

373
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:37,368
Now!

374
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:52,701
Oh, my God.

375
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,642
Sookie. Is that really you?

376
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:03,603
What have they done to you?

377
00:26:04,686 --> 00:26:06,272
Do I look like a vampire?

378
00:26:06,918 --> 00:26:08,168
You look awful.

379
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,170
I feel fucking worse.

380
00:26:10,892 --> 00:26:12,903
I guess that means
I ain't a vampire then,

381
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:14,228
which is good.

382
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:16,532
Uncuff him.

383
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:17,992
I don't have that key.

384
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:19,851
I swear.

385
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,914
<i>Eric's gonna be so mad at me.</i>

386
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,372
<i>Jesus have mercy.</i>

387
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,216
I'm gonna get you outta here.

388
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:27,906
I promise.

389
00:26:35,978 --> 00:26:37,378
That's a new song?

390
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:42,099
I didn't get serious about this
till recently, so I got a lot to learn.

391
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:44,076
Sounding pretty good to me.

392
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:48,731
Nice, I just, you know,
I love music, I just

393
00:26:49,027 --> 00:26:52,068
wasted most of my life trying to avoid
doing the shit I love the most.

394
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:53,778
Why?

395
00:26:55,985 --> 00:26:57,932
I guess I just felt like...

396
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:04,317
If I was good at something,
it's probably just a waste of time,

397
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,559
and if it felt good
I probably didn't deserve it.

398
00:27:09,506 --> 00:27:11,454
You know, a couple days after...

399
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:15,084
Maryann took me in,
she put this guitar in my hands,

400
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:16,209
and I...

401
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:18,094
cried like a fucking baby.

402
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:22,221
Was the first time in my life
anybody's actually ever

403
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,975
encouraged me to do anything.

404
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:25,881
So...

405
00:27:26,785 --> 00:27:28,006
I'm sorry. I...

406
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,570
Don't apologize.

407
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,911
Only thing my mama every
encouraged me how to learn

408
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,486
was how to pour whisky.

409
00:27:39,188 --> 00:27:40,638
- Fuck me.
- What?

410
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:45,421
- What?
- I was supposed to be at work 45 min.

411
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:49,230
I can give you a ride, now.

412
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,294
How many of those have you had?

413
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:52,720
Four?

414
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,888
I think one DUI between us
is enough, don't you?

415
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,761
Besides, I am way too fucked up
to deal with Sam Merlotte right now.

416
00:28:01,218 --> 00:28:02,824
Well, is he gonna fire you?

417
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:04,640
Maybe, but it's just a job.

418
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:07,643
And I go through those about as fast
as I go through relationships.

419
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:10,011
Maybe you haven't found
the right one yet.

420
00:28:10,136 --> 00:28:11,772
I've had a lot of jobs.

421
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,441
I ain't talking about that shit.

422
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:36,297
You still angry about our fight?

423
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:38,836
None of that matters anymore.

424
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:39,913
You're right.

425
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:41,731
I'm alive and in one piece,

426
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,282
unlike my friend Lafayette

427
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:45,450
who Eric chained up like an animal

428
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:47,668
- and left to bleed to death.
- What?

429
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,935
You better not have known
anything about this,

430
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,314
because if you did,

431
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,105
I don't think I could ever
forgive you.

432
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:55,983
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

433
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,653
She's referring to the human
in my basement.

434
00:28:58,831 --> 00:29:01,237
The human that traded
sexual services with a vampire

435
00:29:01,362 --> 00:29:02,656
in order to sell his blood.

436
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:05,175
Which, as you know,
is a grave offense.

437
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,199
His name is Lafayette

438
00:29:07,324 --> 00:29:10,331
and you ought to be ashamed
for what you've done to him.

439
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:16,015
I'm glad you're feeling better.

440
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,173
And may I add,
that color suits you very well.

441
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:20,945
- Go to hell.
- Enough.

442
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,860
It's not nearly enough.

443
00:29:22,985 --> 00:29:25,923
They've tortured him
and bitten him and shot him

444
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:28,837
and kept him down there
in his own filth for weeks.

445
00:29:30,426 --> 00:29:31,268
It's true?

446
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:33,978
There are others who would have
done far worse and you know it.

447
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:36,762
You're gonna let him go right now,

448
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:38,996
or I swear, I'm going to the police.

449
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:42,777
I do not respond well to threats.

450
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:52,375
But perhaps we can come
to some sort of arrangement.

451
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:54,920
Please.

452
00:30:01,617 --> 00:30:04,167
So I guess you're not
coming in tonight.

453
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:06,204
I get it.

454
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:09,298
You're pissed at me
for what I said about Maryann.

455
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,809
Look.

456
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:16,123
Tara, I know you're smart and tough,
and you can take care of yourself,

457
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,180
and that's all I'm asking you to do.

458
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:21,083
Okay? Just keep your eyes open.

459
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,154
And take a good look

460
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,072
at the people around you.

461
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:28,251
And be careful, okay?
Just be careful.

462
00:30:30,346 --> 00:30:32,648
I know. I know I'm late, I'm sorry,

463
00:30:32,901 --> 00:30:35,666
but Lisa decided to give Coby
a nose piercing.

464
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,210
Like she saw on
<i>America's Next Top Model.</i>

465
00:30:38,384 --> 00:30:39,984
Well, now he's got an infection...

466
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:41,839
It's okay.
Go ahead and get changed.

467
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:46,445
Is everything all right with you?

468
00:30:47,793 --> 00:30:49,013
Yeah, everything's fine.

469
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:52,538
I thought, Sookie's supposed
to be working tonight.

470
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:54,977
She was. She called
and asked me to cover for her.

471
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,020
Lord knows I owe her one after...

472
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:00,524
You know.

473
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,977
Nice and understanding
looks good on you, Sam.

474
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:57,129
Anybody home?

475
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:41,816
Chick, two o'clock.

476
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:37,891
You mind if I join you?

477
00:33:40,569 --> 00:33:41,559
If you're alone.

478
00:33:42,907 --> 00:33:43,729
I'm alone.

479
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:52,155
I'm Hoyt.

480
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:57,951
So this might sound kind of funny,
but I was just sitting there,

481
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:00,013
thinking,

482
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:02,713
"How come you don't ever

483
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:04,955
"meet a nice girl, Hoyt?"

484
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:10,464
And then you just walked right in.

485
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,833
How do you know I'm a nice girl?

486
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,679
Because of your smile, I guess.

487
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:21,068
You can tell a lot about someone
by the way they smile,

488
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:22,531
and you know,

489
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:24,823
I watch people all the time.

490
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,233
You see, like that.

491
00:34:31,523 --> 00:34:32,910
That's beautiful.

492
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,032
I could just...
I could stare at that all day long.

493
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:39,959
Day?

494
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,912
Yeah, right.

495
00:34:43,463 --> 00:34:44,748
Did I say something wrong?

496
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:48,668
Course not.

497
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:51,550
Okay, good, because I don't wanna...

498
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:52,965
scare you away...

499
00:34:53,908 --> 00:34:55,968
Would you like a drink
or someth... or food?

500
00:34:58,241 --> 00:34:59,552
You hungry?

501
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:03,471
You should try the chicken fried steak,
because it's...

502
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:07,014
It's like a chicken and a steak
got together and made a baby.

503
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:11,090
It's delicious.
Crispy, baby, and...

504
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:25,205
I'll just have
a bottle of Tru Blood.

505
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:32,111
B positive.

506
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:38,302
You're a vampire?

507
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:43,472
For real?

508
00:35:50,443 --> 00:35:52,524
That is awesome.

509
00:35:57,272 --> 00:35:59,587
A bottle of Tru Blood.
Coming right up.

510
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:09,967
So if I agree to go to Dallas

511
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,263
to help look for this missing vampire,
you'll let Lafayette go?

512
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,266
You nearly died last night.
You are not going to Dallas.

513
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,008
I can make up my own mind.

514
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:21,085
I'll pay all of your expenses,
of course,

515
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,780
and yes, I will release your friend.

516
00:36:24,368 --> 00:36:26,002
And I want $5000.

517
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,713
I've missed a lot of work
and I need a driveway.

518
00:36:31,138 --> 00:36:32,861
Your human is getting cocky.

519
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:36,401
She will take $10,000
and I will escort her.

520
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,112
- I don't thinks so, no.
- Yes.

521
00:36:39,455 --> 00:36:41,782
Ten thousand and Bill comes
with me or it's a deal breaker.

522
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,252
You surprise me.

523
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:53,376
That is a rare quality
in a breather.

524
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,801
You disgust me.

525
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,255
- Perhaps I'll grow on you.
- I'd prefer cancer.

526
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:02,385
- You need to leave immediately.
- I will make the travel arrangements,

527
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:04,845
but I will need
your credit card number.

528
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:11,311
Such a shame. I was hoping I could
convince Eric to let me keep you.

529
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:13,856
No, you already have enough pets.

530
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:16,607
No offense, but you ain't
exactly my type, bitch.

531
00:37:17,396 --> 00:37:19,152
- Can I kick him?
- You can try.

532
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,210
Enough.

533
00:37:20,335 --> 00:37:21,984
Have Chow fetch their car.

534
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:37,427
I'll see you around, I'm sure.

535
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,350
Don't bet on it, baby.

536
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,930
I'm retiring.

537
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,095
I'm done with you crazy-ass fuckers.

538
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,390
Done.

539
00:38:03,891 --> 00:38:05,198
Best soup I have ever had.

540
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,964
Right when I thought this party
couldn't get any fucking weirder,

541
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:35,187
look who shows up.

542
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,041
Thinking Andy Bellefleur
got better shit to do,

543
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,974
like, I dunno, solve a murder.

544
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:42,734
You know what they say
about all work and no play.

545
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:45,154
Seems like you're pretty familiar
with the idea.

546
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:48,089
It was your fault I missed
work in the first place.

547
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,129
You're just too damn distracting.

548
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:00,737
Mike Spencer.

549
00:39:00,862 --> 00:39:02,797
Howdy, Andy.
Great party, huh?

550
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,567
Less talking.
More dancing!

551
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:11,023
Jade Bokowsi,
you are one fiery little hellcat.

552
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,309
Come on.

553
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,784
What you doing in there, pig?

554
00:39:31,445 --> 00:39:32,991
Detective Bellefleur?

555
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,226
I'm so glad you made it.

556
00:39:36,351 --> 00:39:39,418
Actually, I'm here because there have
been some complaints about the noise.

557
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:42,869
And they sent their best
detective to deal with it?

558
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:44,389
I am flattered.

559
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:47,918
But Sheriff Dearborne should really
put your talents to better use.

560
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:50,250
I'll go turn off that music
right away.

561
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,014
Hate to be a party pooper,

562
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:54,348
but you got a livestock permit
for that pig?

563
00:39:55,749 --> 00:39:57,652
- What pig?
- That pig.

564
00:39:58,627 --> 00:40:00,870
I don't know
what you're talking about.

565
00:40:03,873 --> 00:40:05,549
It was there a second ago.

566
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:08,812
- Have you been drinking?
- No, dammit.

567
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:10,240
I know what I saw.

568
00:40:11,315 --> 00:40:13,452
I know what I saw, I'm a good cop.

569
00:40:13,752 --> 00:40:15,412
Of course you are.

570
00:40:17,938 --> 00:40:19,752
Everybody knows that.

571
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:22,747
Here. Why don't you stay
and relax a little bit?

572
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:27,924
Just one.

573
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:29,803
I am on the clock.

574
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,428
Come on.

575
00:40:32,817 --> 00:40:34,723
Yes, God is love.

576
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:37,230
He's the force of love,

577
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:41,196
but how do we respond to forces
that block, undermine,

578
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:42,634
and destroy love?

579
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:45,031
Well, you cannot love evil.

580
00:40:45,448 --> 00:40:46,895
You have to hate it.

581
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,979
So hating evil is really...

582
00:40:52,135 --> 00:40:53,158
loving good.

583
00:40:54,023 --> 00:40:55,023
Good.

584
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:58,575
I never really thought
about it that way.

585
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,265
Hate isn't just natural, Jason.

586
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,773
We need it in order to survive.

587
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,766
My father

588
00:41:05,891 --> 00:41:07,576
dedicated his life to God.

589
00:41:07,701 --> 00:41:09,510
To protecting the human race.

590
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:13,652
They murdered him, his wife,
and my baby sister in cold blood.

591
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:18,265
They're baby-killers.

592
00:41:19,737 --> 00:41:21,504
That's what they're capable of.

593
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,896
Now, if I didn't hate vampires,

594
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,988
and do everything in my power

595
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:29,252
to avenge my family's death,

596
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,614
what kind of man would I be?

597
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:37,344
A pretty bad one.

598
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:41,540
And what's going on out there
is a war.

599
00:41:42,855 --> 00:41:44,932
Not right now, Jason,

600
00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:46,663
but in general.

601
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,339
And we all gotta choose sides.

602
00:41:49,991 --> 00:41:52,095
Now, you're either
on the side of darkness,

603
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,426
or the side of light.

604
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:55,968
- Light.
- There's no in between.

605
00:41:56,587 --> 00:41:59,053
Hope you boys saved room
for some banana pudding.

606
00:41:59,178 --> 00:42:00,100
Thanks, honey.

607
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,686
Sarah's pudding
is a little slice of heaven.

608
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,279
Don't go bragging on me
in front of the company.

609
00:42:05,404 --> 00:42:08,233
Well, you stop being
such an angel and maybe I will.

610
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,949
I'm gonna go get the whipped cream.

611
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:27,283
You know, my wife must think
you're pretty special.

612
00:42:29,198 --> 00:42:30,005
Really?

613
00:42:30,272 --> 00:42:33,341
Sarah doesn't whip out
her pudding for just anybody.

614
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:39,738
God's got great things in store
for you, Jason Stackhouse.

615
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:41,087
Can you feel it?

616
00:42:44,725 --> 00:42:45,922
Yeah, I feel it.

617
00:43:00,105 --> 00:43:03,501
I always wanted to see the inside
of Vampire Bill's house.

618
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,811
You get to live here?

619
00:43:12,493 --> 00:43:13,739
It's pretty cool.

620
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,530
Not really.

621
00:43:16,356 --> 00:43:18,743
I mean, it's full
of his creepy old stuff.

622
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,680
He makes me sleep in a hole.

623
00:43:23,108 --> 00:43:25,788
My mama keeps
her doll collection in my closet.

624
00:43:30,297 --> 00:43:31,316
You got a Wii?

625
00:43:31,923 --> 00:43:32,800
A what?

626
00:43:33,731 --> 00:43:35,361
You never played a Wii?

627
00:43:36,341 --> 00:43:37,648
You'll love it.

628
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:42,758
Yeah, so you can race cars,

629
00:43:43,926 --> 00:43:45,664
or you can play tennis,

630
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:48,141
or...

631
00:43:49,582 --> 00:43:50,748
you can dance.

632
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:56,174
Or you can shoot people.

633
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:59,177
I've never done any of that.

634
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:02,288
Here, I'll show you.
So... may I?

635
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:06,649
So these are the controllers.

636
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:08,644
You just hold that like that.

637
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:41,917
Don't do that.

638
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,154
You don't have to hide that
from me, that's natural.

639
00:44:47,279 --> 00:44:48,727
How can you say that?

640
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:50,681
I mean, I have fangs,

641
00:44:51,383 --> 00:44:53,939
and they just come out
and I can't control them.

642
00:44:57,134 --> 00:45:00,697
This is so embarrassing.
I'd die if I wasn't already dead.

643
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,328
Don't be embarrassed
about what you are.

644
00:45:09,478 --> 00:45:10,989
Because what you are...

645
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:13,918
is great.

646
00:45:16,278 --> 00:45:17,672
You think I'm great?

647
00:45:19,575 --> 00:45:20,625
I like you.

648
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:25,659
I like you a lot.

649
00:45:27,902 --> 00:45:29,254
And that's why...

650
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,020
I think we ought to wait, you know,

651
00:45:32,474 --> 00:45:35,213
before we do anything else.

652
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,802
I've waited too long already.

653
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:53,394
You sure we can't take you
to the hospital?

654
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:56,504
Three jobs and I still ain't
got no health insurance.

655
00:45:57,458 --> 00:46:00,131
Besides, the bullet
went straight through,

656
00:46:00,597 --> 00:46:03,072
I'll get my uncle
stitch it up in the morning.

657
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:04,897
Your uncle the veterinarian?

658
00:46:05,022 --> 00:46:06,772
He chops off steer nuts
for a living,

659
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,598
he can handle the few stitches.

660
00:46:09,523 --> 00:46:10,392
Don't worry.

661
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,060
I'm fine.

662
00:46:12,463 --> 00:46:13,770
You don't look fine.

663
00:46:14,091 --> 00:46:16,314
Far as I'm concerned,
I spent the last two weeks

664
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,526
at Club Med.

665
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:20,735
Drinking a margarita
and getting my chest waxed.

666
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:27,033
And I appreciate it if you tell

667
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,244
your friends
that's how I remember it.

668
00:46:30,093 --> 00:46:31,579
That would be wise.

669
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,707
At least let Bill help you inside.

670
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:36,898
Sook, I said I'm fine.

671
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,206
I used to get so mad

672
00:47:59,331 --> 00:48:02,181
when people judged vampires
just for being different.

673
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:04,714
It's like they were judging me too.

674
00:48:06,707 --> 00:48:07,886
I told myself

675
00:48:08,607 --> 00:48:09,618
their fear

676
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,356
was nothing but small-mindedness,

677
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:15,652
but maybe that's just
what I wanted to believe,

678
00:48:16,649 --> 00:48:18,829
because the more open my mind gets,

679
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:22,061
the more evil I see.

680
00:48:27,026 --> 00:48:28,191
Most of us,

681
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:32,132
vampire, human, or otherwise,

682
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,481
are capable of both good and evil.

683
00:48:37,653 --> 00:48:39,136
Often simultaneously.

684
00:48:39,261 --> 00:48:42,363
You can't expect me to believe
that Eric's capable of anything good.

685
00:48:43,156 --> 00:48:45,413
Not after how he tortured Lafayette.

686
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:47,882
I have had worse sheriffs.

687
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:50,747
I don't understand
how you can defend him.

688
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:54,058
He saved your life.

689
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,360
I can still hate him.

690
00:48:57,647 --> 00:48:58,414
I hate

691
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:01,844
that he may be putting
you in harm's way once again.

692
00:49:03,132 --> 00:49:04,811
For his own selfish reasons.

693
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,784
And I hate that he has shown
you the barbarousness

694
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:12,545
that we call justice.

695
00:49:15,538 --> 00:49:17,245
If I could glamour it away for you,

696
00:49:17,977 --> 00:49:18,848
I would.

697
00:49:20,421 --> 00:49:21,879
I'm glad you can't.

698
00:49:22,663 --> 00:49:24,834
I'm sick of things
sneaking up on me.

699
00:49:25,665 --> 00:49:29,424
Rene and whatever the hell that
was that attacked me last night.

700
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,808
If I'm never gonna be safe,

701
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:36,392
I'd rather know
what to be afraid of.

702
00:49:43,128 --> 00:49:44,631
Well, after last night,

703
00:49:45,811 --> 00:49:48,234
I hope that that doesn't include me.

704
00:49:54,437 --> 00:49:56,293
I know there's darkness in you.

705
00:49:59,186 --> 00:50:00,448
I know there is.

706
00:50:02,189 --> 00:50:05,084
And it scares the life out of me.

707
00:50:07,697 --> 00:50:09,020
But you're right.

708
00:50:11,817 --> 00:50:13,540
There's goodness in you too.

709
00:50:16,754 --> 00:50:18,520
And when I look in your eyes,

710
00:50:20,693 --> 00:50:22,069
that's what I see.

711
00:50:34,275 --> 00:50:37,822
I feel so unbelievably
fucking good right now.

712
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,073
That's how you feel to me too, baby.

713
00:50:48,991 --> 00:50:50,581
Got room for one more?

714
00:50:57,538 --> 00:50:59,889
You guys are so beautiful.

715
00:51:01,605 --> 00:51:03,549
I'm a licensed massage therapist.

716
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,413
Who wants to go first?

717
00:51:10,399 --> 00:51:12,360
You got a big knot right there.

718
00:51:51,852 --> 00:51:52,942
Come on, Tara.

719
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:14,281
Come on.

720
00:52:14,406 --> 00:52:16,846
That girl in the tub was drunk,
I don't even know who she was.

721
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,472
Looked like you wanted
to know her a lot better.

722
00:52:19,597 --> 00:52:21,346
I just got carried away, that's all.

723
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,714
Yeah, you and everybody else
out there.

724
00:52:24,807 --> 00:52:26,267
Is this what Maryann's about?

725
00:52:26,828 --> 00:52:28,060
Are you in the lifestyle?

726
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,475
Lifestyle? Tara, that's just
a bunch of drunk-ass people

727
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,413
trying to let loose, have a good time.
That's got nothing to do with us.

728
00:52:33,538 --> 00:52:36,348
I don't give a crap what people
do with their own body parts,

729
00:52:36,473 --> 00:52:38,738
but there's no us
if this is your scene.

730
00:52:41,765 --> 00:52:42,815
God dammit.

731
00:53:08,231 --> 00:53:09,033
Hell.

732
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,103
I wasn't gonna run off
without saying goodbye to you.

733
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,212
I'm sure gonna miss you, buddy.

734
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,611
All right.
One last time.

735
00:53:19,884 --> 00:53:21,174
Let's go. Come on.

736
00:53:21,986 --> 00:53:23,622
You can't keep up with me.

737
00:53:25,156 --> 00:53:26,049
I knew it.

738
00:53:26,174 --> 00:53:28,364
Underneath that tough
vampire exterior,

739
00:53:28,489 --> 00:53:30,111
you're nothing but a big softie.

740
00:53:30,236 --> 00:53:31,610
Don't tell anybody.

741
00:53:33,487 --> 00:53:36,261
That's a lot of pink, Bill.

742
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:38,763
I'm sure Jessica will love it.

743
00:53:40,444 --> 00:53:43,511
I remember when ladies' clothing
stores sold petticoats.

744
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:45,036
That's just weird.

745
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,640
Actually,
I kind of miss them at times.

746
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:50,309
They left something
to the imagination.

747
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:54,230
Unfastening them required
a certain skill.

748
00:53:55,573 --> 00:53:58,498
I think there's
a Halloween store around here

749
00:53:59,019 --> 00:54:00,403
that might still have some.

750
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,437
You are such a tease.

751
00:54:16,508 --> 00:54:19,338
I wasn't doing anything,
I wasn't gonna bite him, I swear.

752
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:20,703
It's okay.

753
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:23,029
Bill, don't.

754
00:54:32,187 --> 00:54:33,352
What's your problem?

755
00:54:33,785 --> 00:54:35,146
Come on in, the water's warm.

756
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,306
Fine.

757
00:54:38,621 --> 00:54:39,821
Suit yourself.

758
00:54:48,068 --> 00:54:49,785
Were you just talking to that dog?

759
00:54:52,396 --> 00:54:53,956
What are you doing out here?

760
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,168
Same as you, I guess.
Just trying to cool off.

761
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:00,472
And I can't sleep.

762
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:03,733
See, I have this hard-ass boss,

763
00:55:03,964 --> 00:55:06,112
who really laid into me this week.

764
00:55:07,575 --> 00:55:08,679
Sounds like a jerk.

765
00:55:10,028 --> 00:55:12,979
He's not all bad.
He can be real nice.

766
00:55:13,545 --> 00:55:14,560
To dogs.

767
00:55:15,477 --> 00:55:18,564
Listen, I'm sorry.
I've had a lot on my mind.

768
00:55:20,048 --> 00:55:21,610
I know how hard you're trying,

769
00:55:22,169 --> 00:55:24,950
and I think you're starting
to get the hang of it. I really do.

770
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,366
You're even worse at lying than
you are at being a boss, Sam,

771
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:30,826
but I'll take what I can get,
so thanks.

772
00:55:31,156 --> 00:55:32,093
You're welcome.

773
00:55:32,218 --> 00:55:34,782
This water really warm,
or you lying about that too?

774
00:55:34,907 --> 00:55:36,407
No, it's great.

775
00:55:37,283 --> 00:55:39,335
Nothing like a midnight swim

776
00:55:39,825 --> 00:55:41,458
to wash away the troubles.

777
00:55:42,174 --> 00:55:43,578
You should try it sometime.

778
00:55:43,703 --> 00:55:45,124
Yeah, I think I will.

779
00:55:46,725 --> 00:55:48,612
- You mean now?
- It's a big lake, Sam,

780
00:55:48,737 --> 00:55:50,720
I think there's room
for both of us, ain't there?

781
00:55:55,181 --> 00:55:56,728
Guess so. Come on in.
