1
00:00:06,996 --> 00:00:08,553
Stay away from this.

2
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:12,263
- Got nothing to say to you.
- Man, what the hell you...?

3
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:17,812
Excuse me, everyone...

4
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:21,854
if I could have
your attention please.

5
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:27,050
It doesn't matter
if we ever meet again.

6
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:29,192
You may be immortal, Lorena,

7
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,191
but you are dead to me.

8
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:35,903
I wish you hadn't said that.

9
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:51,971
And I have a message for you

10
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:53,598
from Reverend Steve Newlin.

11
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:19,007
I've covered her,

12
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:21,151
she's only stunned.

13
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:25,173
Get the humans.

14
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,235
Get in, get in. Come on.
Let's go.

15
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,177
Go! Go. Come on.

16
00:01:32,077 --> 00:01:33,103
Get in. Go.

17
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:34,708
Go. Go.

18
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:40,019
- We didn't think he'd really do it.
- Too late.

19
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:03,478
Sync: mpm & Arrow

20
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,139
I can't breathe, you weigh a ton.

21
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:01,853
Had to shield you.

22
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:04,455
Heal yourself,
what are you waiting for.

23
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:05,816
Can't.

24
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:09,230
- Silver.
- I'll go get Godric.

25
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,890
No time.

26
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:14,297
Suck it out.

27
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:15,784
Yuck, I can't,

28
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:18,606
it's too gross and...

29
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,864
it's... you.

30
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:22,049
I...

31
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:23,355
dying....

32
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:26,729
Son of a mother.

33
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:40,233
Got it.

34
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:41,685
The other one.

35
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:43,803
You're kidding me.

36
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:07,132
Oh, God, oh, God.

37
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:10,229
You tell the cowards who lead you,

38
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:13,137
the cowards who send children
to do their killing,

39
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,778
that a vampire showed mercy
where they had none.

40
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:43,134
Who's dead?

41
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:45,534
Stan, Paolo, Catherine,

42
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:47,653
two human companions.

43
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:52,772
What are you doing?

44
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:57,235
I sucked silver out of Eric's chest
and saved his life,

45
00:05:57,395 --> 00:05:59,125
even though I really didn't want to.

46
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:00,571
She was superb.

47
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:05,464
Eric was in no danger.

48
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:07,984
He... What?

49
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,265
A tiny falsehood.

50
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:12,626
He was already healing.

51
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,180
The bullets would
have pushed themselves out.

52
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:17,998
This way,

53
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,578
he's forced you to drink his blood.

54
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:27,265
You're connected.
He'll to sense your emotions.

55
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:29,100
You big lying A-hole.

56
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:31,728
You're right,
I can sense her emotions.

57
00:06:34,724 --> 00:06:37,505
- Sweet.
- I'll never do anything for you again.

58
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,484
Monster.

59
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,964
- It's not your fault.
- I think I'm gonna cry.

60
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,115
Everyone, please.

61
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:48,161
Y'all listen up.

62
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:49,697
They may come back.

63
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:52,330
Go to the Hotel Carmilla,
they've been alerted,

64
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,000
security is in place.

65
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:56,970
Help me.

66
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:04,318
Almost there...

67
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:30,697
I could kick myself.

68
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,591
I'm so stupid, I wasn't thinking.

69
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,898
He did take bullets for you.

70
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:40,421
- At least we both came out alive.
- I know better than to believe one word

71
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,281
out of that man's mouth.

72
00:07:42,923 --> 00:07:44,743
I sucked his chest.

73
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:46,463
What is wrong with me?

74
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:50,503
Eric has had a thousand years
practicing deceit.

75
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:55,164
He lied to prove his power to me.

76
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,350
He counted on your goodness,

77
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:00,921
- there's no shame in that.
- But his blood, Bill.

78
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:03,875
I tried to spit it all out, really,

79
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:06,989
- but some of it must have gone down.
- It only takes a drop or two.

80
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:10,417
He'll always know where I am

81
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,139
and how I feel...

82
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:13,691
always.

83
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:16,872
That's the worst of all.

84
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:20,060
Not the worst.

85
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,420
What do you mean?

86
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,860
Don't be surprised if...

87
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,920
you feel some...

88
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:28,511
attraction to him.

89
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:33,891
Sexual.

90
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:36,188
To Eric?

91
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,822
That's impossible,
I can't stand him.

92
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,559
It is possible.

93
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,100
It's another consequence
of the blood.

94
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:50,105
It would have happened
sooner or later.

95
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:54,461
He was determined
to form this bond with you.

96
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,209
I could kill him.

97
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:00,488
I concur.

98
00:09:02,423 --> 00:09:04,223
Maybe I'll get used to it.

99
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:06,886
Or maybe there's an operation.

100
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:09,306
I can't be the only vampire virgin.

101
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,609
You know...

102
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:15,938
intercourse
isn't the only way to have sex.

103
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:19,979
But I want to have intercourse.

104
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:21,189
Well, sure.

105
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:25,776
We could do everything,
when we figure out how.

106
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,379
You should break up with me.

107
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:29,896
Hell, no.

108
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:32,508
That thing that grows back,

109
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:34,334
it's just a thing.

110
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,259
I ain't perfect either.

111
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,457
I'm a guy that people laugh at.

112
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:41,835
Even my friends, but you never have.

113
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:45,481
I don't ever wanna hear you
talk about breaking up.

114
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,628
I won't,

115
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,010
I promise.

116
00:09:53,764 --> 00:09:55,864
In fact, you mean so much to me,

117
00:09:58,186 --> 00:10:00,036
I want you to meet my mama.

118
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:03,648
You mean it?

119
00:10:06,884 --> 00:10:08,931
Nobody ever wants
me to meet anybody.

120
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:11,906
No, don't get too excited.
Look, she hates vampires

121
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:14,198
and she's gonna ask you
all kind of questions

122
00:10:14,318 --> 00:10:16,230
or she may not talk to you at all,

123
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:18,371
which then you'd be lucky.

124
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:22,957
Well, I don't care what she does.

125
00:10:24,226 --> 00:10:26,626
You're introducing
me to your family,

126
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:29,664
I never even hoped for that.

127
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:32,123
I'm proud that you're my girl.

128
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:48,069
The sun's coming up.

129
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:51,814
I guess it's time
for that damn cubby hole.

130
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:54,490
I'll go in with you.

131
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:59,378
Please, it's...
It's not very comfortable.

132
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,873
I'll have to build us
a tricked-out doublewide.

133
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:05,584
That is so romantic.

134
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,250
But, for now,

135
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:13,069
I'll sit right here
till you fall asleep.

136
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,386
You are the sweetest boy
in the world.

137
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:18,183
And you're too good to me.

138
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:22,216
There ain't no such thing.

139
00:11:34,702 --> 00:11:36,602
- Good night.
- Good night.

140
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:41,597
I'll sing to you so you know I'm...

141
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:43,209
Know I'm right here.

142
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:03,864
<i>My sweet vampire...</i>

143
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:14,857
Oh, my goodness,

144
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,630
how much did you drink this time?

145
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,408
Nothing, as far as I recall.

146
00:12:19,736 --> 00:12:20,897
Same for me.

147
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:24,230
You must've dropped a little acid,
it was floating around.

148
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:27,086
- Hippies.
- That's not funny.

149
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:29,627
It's embarrassing, is what it is.

150
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:31,981
I will never understand that.

151
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:33,923
Why be embarrassed

152
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,093
about pleasure and laughter?
Why be ashamed of letting go?

153
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:39,424
Because I've never been
this out of control.

154
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:43,666
Control. It's a cage this stupid culture
uses to lock up who we really are.

155
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:46,464
We need to be out of control.
We crave it.

156
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:50,147
But there's gotta be some kind
of control or things would be chaos.

157
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:51,988
Sounds good.

158
00:12:52,784 --> 00:12:54,649
I do like a little chaos.

159
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,009
Of course you do.

160
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,324
Everybody does.
They just can't admit it.

161
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:01,931
I don't wanna be blacking out.

162
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:04,061
Is that what you think it is?

163
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:08,977
Because I have a little theory
about blacking out.

164
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,961
Maybe you rose
to a higher state of consciousness.

165
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:14,131
We're all bashed up.

166
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:17,731
There's nothing higher about that
except for we must of been high.

167
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:21,263
My mama blacked out for months
at a time, I'm a blackout expert.

168
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:23,131
- Are you?
- Certified.

169
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:24,897
What about the saints of India?

170
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:27,766
What about the mystics
of every religion?

171
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,817
What about them?

172
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:32,487
They would black out.

173
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:34,896
Run and dance through the streets,

174
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:37,403
levitate, act like monkeys,
run around naked.

175
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:41,997
- Everybody thought they were crazy.
- They were crazy.

176
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,100
They were ecstatic.

177
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:53,897
All that fake civilization
bullshit just fell away

178
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:56,617
so they could dissolve
into the infinite,

179
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,530
so they could lose themselves
and unite with their god.

180
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,873
Look at you.

181
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,525
A few bumps and bruises.

182
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:24,363
That's a small price
to pay for bliss.

183
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:30,572
Bloody Mary, anyone?

184
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,445
Come on now, Bud. Cut us loose.

185
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:43,010
All I did was lose my pants,
there's no law against that.

186
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,554
I only got your word for it
I was mating with a tree.

187
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,225
None of us did anything.
Let us out of here.

188
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,432
You got no evidence, Bud.

189
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:54,019
You got no right
to keep me locked up.

190
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,311
I can't sleep.

191
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,439
Join the club.

192
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:36,588
They made me think
I was worth something.

193
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:39,417
You were a star in Bon Temps.

194
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,740
I was the throwaway.

195
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:44,446
Everybody always
thought you hung the moon.

196
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:46,384
No, that ain't true.

197
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:49,326
Well, they like my athletics

198
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:51,485
and my good looks,

199
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:53,404
my sex abilities,

200
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,916
but they don't like me for me.

201
00:15:57,184 --> 00:15:58,897
And Steve and Sarah, well,

202
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:00,897
they acted like they did,

203
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:03,007
before they tried to kill me.

204
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:09,053
They stopped my mind
from going around and around

205
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,284
thinking about...

206
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:15,936
Other stuff.

207
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:18,487
What other stuff?

208
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,330
But Soldiers of the Sun?

209
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:26,397
My Lord.

210
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:28,949
Didn't you for one second think
what Gran would say?

211
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:31,297
Guns and suicide bombers...

212
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,612
Don't... Don't talk about Gran.

213
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:37,162
I won't talk about her.
I can't.

214
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:40,801
Why?

215
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:43,077
Because I don't...

216
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:48,218
Because I don't wanna feel anything.

217
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,313
But we have to talk about her.

218
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:56,565
We can't stop remembing her

219
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:59,960
or loving her because
it hurts too much.

220
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:03,707
She'd never stop loving us,

221
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:05,288
would she?

222
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:12,797
We'll keep her alive in our hearts

223
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:15,222
and our prayers

224
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:20,117
and that's the way it's gotta be.

225
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:24,597
And Mama and Daddy.

226
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:27,174
That's right.
Mama and Daddy...

227
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:29,023
and Gran.

228
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:35,317
Our whole family's gone, Sook.

229
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:39,393
Everybody who counts.

230
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,959
We're all alone.

231
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:44,608
We're all that's left.

232
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,600
So you know what we gotta do?

233
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:51,356
We gotta grow up,

234
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:53,919
we gotta stick together

235
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,967
and we gotta be good to each other

236
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,520
or we're letting them down.

237
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:15,615
I'm sorry about...

238
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:19,506
everything I ever done to you.

239
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:23,384
I'm a dumbass fuck-up.

240
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,738
Yeah, but you wouldn't be
if you used your brain instead of...

241
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:31,280
just letting it take
up space in your skull.

242
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:33,692
That's not dumb,

243
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:35,001
that's lazy.

244
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:36,527
You think so?

245
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,940
Well, I could try,

246
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:41,057
I guess.

247
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:44,330
I'm sorry too.
I always love you, Jason,

248
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,873
even when I wanna

249
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:47,985
stick your head in a bucket

250
00:18:48,476 --> 00:18:49,882
and kick it around the yard.

251
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:55,171
And I love you,

252
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,936
even though

253
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:01,852
I wish you'd cook for me more

254
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:05,189
and you were normal

255
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:08,275
with a normal boyfriend.

256
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:10,778
I didn't have any say
about being normal.

257
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:14,799
We were born the way we are.

258
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:23,979
- I'm all wore out now.
- Me too.

259
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:27,127
<i>May His holy light shine upon you...</i>

260
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:28,689
Can you believe, they're on TV.

261
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:30,974
<i>You kidnapped a prominent
member of our community.</i>

262
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:33,263
- <i>He volunteered. </i>
- Did he?

263
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:35,483
I didn't even know he was there.

264
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,828
<i>- ... that's no crime.
- He came to us.</i>

265
00:19:37,948 --> 00:19:39,681
<i>Because everybody
wants to be burned.</i>

266
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,226
<i>You use your tax-exempt
religious institution</i>

267
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:44,348
<i>as an anti-vampire
terrorist enclave.</i>

268
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:47,356
<i>The Constitution gives us</i>
<i>the right to defend ourselves.</i>

269
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,857
<i>You attacked us.</i>

270
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:50,307
<i>You murdered my father.</i>

271
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:52,361
<i>That's an allegation.
This is a fact:</i>

272
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:54,597
you and your church armed
a suicide bomber

273
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:56,622
that killed vampires and humans.

274
00:19:56,742 --> 00:20:00,327
<i>We are fighting for God's green</i>
<i>earth and daytime</i>

275
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:02,624
and Christmas and Easter eggs

276
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,597
and all that's sacred and good.

277
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:07,564
We are fighting for...

278
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:09,997
Human rights. Human rights.

279
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:12,333
- May I finish my thought?
- What, you were done.

280
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:14,758
If he's not the center of attention,
he flips out.

281
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:16,364
They are cuckoo.

282
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:18,387
How can you have a dialogue
with these people?

283
00:20:18,547 --> 00:20:21,019
You need to read you
some Saint Paul, missy.

284
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:22,489
I hate your hair.

285
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:25,797
There's a witch
and a son of a bitch.

286
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:27,317
Fuck you, Newlins.

287
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:37,397
- Now can we see the freezer?
- Why?

288
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:40,664
Where they found that woman
with her heart cut out.

289
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:43,078
It was the walk-in refrigerator
and you are

290
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:44,588
one sick buzzard.

291
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:47,886
Go find some roadkill,
because you ain't eating here.

292
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,297
What do you want?

293
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:55,864
A knife, a fork and a spoon,
if that's not too much trouble.

294
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:57,872
They're in the back,
go get them yourself.

295
00:20:57,992 --> 00:20:59,869
I could use some help out here.

296
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:02,031
Merlotte's, hurry up.

297
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:06,397
Lisa, lunch is your job,
you got a microwave,

298
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,017
that's all you need.

299
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,564
Come on, Coby'll eat cat food
if you put mayo on it.

300
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:13,084
Mama's gotta work.

301
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,406
I'll tell you what,
I am shit scared.

302
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:24,296
Oh, my God.

303
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,610
She was clumsy, stupid and mean, but I
wouldn't wish that death on a possum.

304
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:36,583
Plus that poor soul
out in the parking lot?

305
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:40,397
What if there's a curse
flying around out there?

306
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,764
I'll look out for you
if you look out for me.

307
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:45,397
When's it gonna stop?

308
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:46,725
Order up,

309
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:48,185
I think.

310
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,464
Please quit being so much more peculiar
than you usually are.

311
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:04,051
Please talk to me.

312
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:06,430
If what we did was so terrible...

313
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:10,533
Don't cry.

314
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:15,186
I didn't mean to be peculiar at you.

315
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:20,672
I just don't know what we did.

316
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,108
Well, we had sex.

317
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:26,541
Didn't we?

318
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,064
- Did we?
- You can't remember?

319
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:32,411
Don't take this the wrong way but...

320
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:33,981
nope.

321
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,975
Baby, me, neither.

322
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:38,968
I mean, not for sure.

323
00:22:39,437 --> 00:22:41,863
- Is that good?
- I don't know and I don't care

324
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:43,824
as long as you're not mad at me.

325
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:45,935
Well, to tell you the truth,

326
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,621
I can't remember the last time
I had sex with anybody.

327
00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:53,967
Gimme some sugar?

328
00:22:56,051 --> 00:22:57,451
Where's my corn?

329
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:00,530
Come on now, the wait's forever.

330
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:04,845
- I want my damn corn.
- See you later.

331
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:08,674
I got it.

332
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:12,288
I know, I'm late.

333
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,626
Go ahead, order lunch on me.

334
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:18,734
- Stop.
- What the fuck is this?

335
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:20,881
He didn't do it.
I don't know what happened.

336
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:22,946
What you mean you don't know?

337
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:25,157
Don't gimme that bullshit.
What'd you do to her?

338
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:27,459
- I don't hurt women.
- It was an accident.

339
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:30,345
You put your hands on my cousin
bitch ass motherfucker?

340
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:32,372
I'm gonna show you how it feels.

341
00:23:32,532 --> 00:23:34,958
- You might take those eyelashes out.
- Stop.

342
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,462
You been kicked and punched you all life
then you  get with this motherfucker.

343
00:23:38,622 --> 00:23:41,048
He's poison.
He ain't never gonna change.

344
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,070
- And he may wind up killing you.
- Fuck that, you motherfucker...

345
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,190
Enough.

346
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,363
Stop.

347
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:49,715
- I ought to beat your...
- Please, do so.

348
00:23:49,835 --> 00:23:51,585
- Do it!
- Eggs, enough!

349
00:23:54,387 --> 00:23:55,637
Way to go, son.

350
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,064
What the fuck you all looking at,
you ugly-ass necks.

351
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:07,497
My Hoyt would never have run off
to Dallas without a word

352
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:09,717
with murders all over the place.

353
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:12,198
My Hoyt would never have
left me worried sick

354
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:13,731
thinking he was dead.

355
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:14,851
Or worse.

356
00:24:15,106 --> 00:24:16,124
With a vampire.

357
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:19,357
- Go ahead, speak your mind.
- See what I mean?

358
00:24:19,477 --> 00:24:21,838
All of a sudden,
you're a different person.

359
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:24,257
I sure do wanna be.

360
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,090
What do you think
your daddy would say?

361
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,822
I have no idea, because the only time
you ever mention him

362
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:32,516
is when you're trying to make me
do something I don't wanna do.

363
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:35,685
So while we're at it,
let's talk about that.

364
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:38,119
I want my sweet child back.

365
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:41,740
I haven't done anything
to deserve this.

366
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:44,597
What are you doing
with vampires anyway?

367
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,664
They are wrong, wrong, wrong.

368
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:47,906
They are devils.

369
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:49,991
Why do you have so much hate in you?

370
00:24:51,184 --> 00:24:53,297
- I don't.
- That's a flat lie.

371
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,486
Who do you think you're talking to?

372
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:56,797
My mama.

373
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:59,584
- Who hates Methodists.
- I got my reasons.

374
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:01,098
And Catholics.

375
00:25:01,288 --> 00:25:02,831
Just priests and nuns.

376
00:25:02,998 --> 00:25:05,221
- African-Americans.
- Hush, that's a secret.

377
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:06,383
People who don't

378
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:08,676
take care of their gardens,
who parkup on their lawn.

379
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:10,951
- Ladies who wear red shoes.
- It looks cheap.

380
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:14,217
Families with lots of kids.
And checkered curtains and cats

381
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:16,271
and dogs, and bait,

382
00:25:16,697 --> 00:25:18,497
every girl that I ever liked.

383
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:21,064
And the more that I like them,
the more that you hate them.

384
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:24,430
I simply object to a girlfriend
who will kill you and eat you.

385
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,404
- I think that's reasonable.
- You don't even know her.

386
00:25:27,774 --> 00:25:29,566
Full of hate.

387
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:33,649
I see you now.

388
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:38,512
Well, it's not my fault,

389
00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:40,582
it's the way I was raised up.

390
00:25:40,827 --> 00:25:43,628
Jessica may be a vampire,
but she's the one for me.

391
00:25:43,788 --> 00:25:47,257
- You don't have any say over it.
- You are breaking my heart.

392
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:50,165
You know,

393
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:53,966
I've let you run me around
because I didn't wanna hurt you,

394
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,763
but those days are over.

395
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:57,356
Now, I want you to meet her,

396
00:25:57,476 --> 00:25:58,931
but if you can't be nice,

397
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:01,406
then I will leave this house
and never come back,

398
00:26:01,848 --> 00:26:03,330
And don't think I won't.

399
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:05,004
Please,

400
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:07,777
you're my one son.

401
00:26:07,937 --> 00:26:09,321
I'm not yours, Mama, I'm mine.

402
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:11,198
You're my baby boy.

403
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,029
I'm not a baby,

404
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:15,462
I'm a grown-ass man.

405
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,013
Finish your sentence.

406
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:50,527
What was I saying?

407
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,697
You were telling me
why you'd be a terrible vampire

408
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:55,362
and I was disagreeing.

409
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:56,917
Well,

410
00:26:57,277 --> 00:26:59,427
I don't feel right without a tan.

411
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,977
It's true.

412
00:27:03,385 --> 00:27:05,931
And I'd rather be alive than undead

413
00:27:06,311 --> 00:27:08,363
and then y'all are always killing.

414
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:10,157
You've killed a man.

415
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:13,271
But that was for self-defense,
not for lunch.

416
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:16,587
You'd adapt, like we all do.

417
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:19,263
Trade the sun for moon and stars.

418
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:24,244
Not me. I want them all.

419
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:27,789
Greedy.

420
00:27:29,288 --> 00:27:31,037
Yeah, I am.

421
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:32,421
I love it.

422
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,597
You have the right temperament
for a vampire.

423
00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:44,666
What,

424
00:27:44,826 --> 00:27:48,670
I'm high-maintenance,
bloodthirsty and old as dirt?

425
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,928
Bloodthirsty, yes.

426
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:52,549
I am not.

427
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,595
Everybody thinks you're a darling,
don't they.

428
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,297
I am a darling.

429
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:02,282
Yeah, but you're ruthless
when it comes to people you love.

430
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:05,376
You'll do anything for them.

431
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,151
Your brother...

432
00:28:07,536 --> 00:28:08,686
your friends.

433
00:28:11,811 --> 00:28:12,611
Me.

434
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:20,535
Where's Bill?

435
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:24,078
What do you care?

436
00:28:24,784 --> 00:28:26,664
You've already abandoned him.

437
00:28:27,117 --> 00:28:28,167
I have not.

438
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,236
I love Bill.

439
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:37,382
I used to think you had
no sense of humor.

440
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:40,226
I used to think
you were made of cold hard stone,

441
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:41,973
and empty inside.

442
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:44,932
And now?

443
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:48,027
You're a big faker.

444
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:50,537
You're deep.

445
00:28:51,385 --> 00:28:52,385
You feel.

446
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:56,057
There's love in you.

447
00:28:57,649 --> 00:28:58,949
Only for Sookie.

448
00:29:01,684 --> 00:29:03,161
You don't want Bill.

449
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,233
He means nothing to you.

450
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,006
This is the beginning.

451
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:53,297
Hey, there she is.
She's come to get us out.

452
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,200
That she is.

453
00:29:55,785 --> 00:29:58,671
- We had a good time, didn't we?
- Oh, yeah, we did.

454
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:03,680
Sheriff Dearborne?

455
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:10,664
None of y'all is going anywhere
till you simmer down.

456
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:12,230
Don't make me tell you again.

457
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,963
Sheriff Bud Dearborne?

458
00:30:14,684 --> 00:30:16,086
Is that Maryann?

459
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:19,195
Hey, the party's back here.

460
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:21,630
Sure is.

461
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,475
Sit down and shut up.

462
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:25,931
Come on, Bud.

463
00:30:26,996 --> 00:30:28,330
It stinks in here.

464
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,738
Now, Bud, come on.

465
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,516
There's coffee if you want.

466
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:44,034
Sheriff, you look exhausted.

467
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,911
What's going on around here?

468
00:30:46,036 --> 00:30:47,286
Hell if I know.

469
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,055
Seems every person in Bon Temps

470
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,901
is getting arrested, but they
don't know what they done.

471
00:30:53,026 --> 00:30:55,876
Kenya's out in the wagon
collecting some more.

472
00:30:57,596 --> 00:30:59,356
We been up all night.

473
00:31:00,978 --> 00:31:02,603
A major crime wave.

474
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:06,732
Misdemeanors, crazy things
I never saw in over 40 years.

475
00:31:07,102 --> 00:31:09,282
Misdemeanors, that's not so bad.

476
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,726
Maybe you could let a few of them go,
save yourself the work.

477
00:31:11,851 --> 00:31:14,214
I'm about ready to,
but they're all riled up,

478
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,175
might still do some damage.

479
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,266
Let me help, I'll talk them down.

480
00:31:20,683 --> 00:31:22,133
It's my best thing.

481
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,528
I'd be grateful, can't hardly
keep my eyes open.

482
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:28,135
Now, what can I do for you?

483
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:33,890
I heard Sam Merlotte is here,

484
00:31:34,449 --> 00:31:37,312
I couldn't believe it.
A fine upstanding businessman.

485
00:31:37,722 --> 00:31:40,231
I have a lot of respect for him
and I'd like to help him out.

486
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,108
I'm not prepared
to let him go, he's a suspect

487
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,476
in a homicide.

488
00:31:45,506 --> 00:31:48,208
- That can't be.
- But I'll show you where he's at.

489
00:31:48,998 --> 00:31:50,940
I know the way. Sit.

490
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:52,535
Have a little rest.

491
00:31:53,507 --> 00:31:54,507
There.

492
00:32:07,318 --> 00:32:08,636
You went fast.

493
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:09,761
Stay.

494
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:18,097
Can we come over
to your house and play?

495
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,775
I want Sam Merlotte.

496
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:26,549
He's right there.

497
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,457
Now I am really irritated.

498
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,087
Free.

499
00:33:09,435 --> 00:33:12,281
I never thought
you'd be so pretty, Ms. Fortenberry.

500
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:15,951
And I can't tell you how
grateful I am that you came.

501
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:18,537
Even if you were 20 minutes late.

502
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:21,749
I couldn't decide what to wear.

503
00:33:22,825 --> 00:33:25,027
Hon, I know what that's like.

504
00:33:25,152 --> 00:33:27,094
Sure. You try this on,
or try that on,

505
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:29,047
is it the black shoes
or the red shoes

506
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,216
or the...

507
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,469
Then there were people in the road.

508
00:33:34,652 --> 00:33:37,413
They wouldn't budge till
I practically ran over them.

509
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:38,766
I could have been killed.

510
00:33:39,656 --> 00:33:41,101
Well, them, too.

511
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,314
Let's get you some dinner, Mama.

512
00:33:45,595 --> 00:33:46,845
I'm not hungry.

513
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:51,981
You want some more sweet tea?

514
00:33:52,219 --> 00:33:53,519
I'm not thirsty.

515
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,246
Hoyt is a very, very, very good boy.

516
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:03,999
Mostly.

517
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,850
You don't need to tell me that.

518
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,164
You're as good as I am.
Better.

519
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,541
No, you are.

520
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:15,353
You are.

521
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:18,117
I surely wish
I could meet your people,

522
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:19,890
- see what your family's like.
- Mama.

523
00:34:22,242 --> 00:34:25,778
Somebody made me a vampire
against my will, Ms. Fortenberry.

524
00:34:26,938 --> 00:34:28,440
I don't have a family any more,

525
00:34:30,056 --> 00:34:31,610
except your wonderful son.

526
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:36,144
I'm sorry for you.

527
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,469
That wasn't fair.

528
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:42,371
But Hoyt has a bright
future ahead of him.

529
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,738
And by bright, I mean in the sun.

530
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:49,878
If you think I'm gonna
let him wander around

531
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,242
all hours of the night

532
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:54,187
for the rest of his life
with an orphan vampire,

533
00:34:54,312 --> 00:34:56,259
you got another think coming.

534
00:34:57,313 --> 00:34:59,311
I believe that's up to Hoyt.

535
00:34:59,436 --> 00:35:00,556
Y'all don't.

536
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,627
- I'll fight for what's best for my boy.
- So will I.

537
00:35:03,752 --> 00:35:06,186
And I can give him
everything a human could.

538
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:07,817
- Not hardly.
- Like what?

539
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:09,147
Babies.

540
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:20,784
Well, now you did it.

541
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,162
- You happy?
- You'll thank me one day.

542
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,361
Not today.

543
00:35:26,302 --> 00:35:28,125
- When are you coming home?
- Never.

544
00:35:36,328 --> 00:35:37,801
I gonna need another one of these.

545
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,643
All right, let's do this motherfuck.

546
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,366
- You can't do that.
- That's against the rules. Come on.

547
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:52,397
We play by my rules,
that means no rules.

548
00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:54,762
Okay, then.

549
00:35:58,086 --> 00:35:59,536
Come in, it's open.

550
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,909
Deal. Deal.

551
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:04,238
- Deal what?
- Whatever.

552
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,122
Well, look is here. Aliens.

553
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,703
Oh, who's that?

554
00:36:13,268 --> 00:36:14,963
Ms. Thornton, welcome, join us.

555
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:18,050
- No, we good.
- We're taking Tara away from you.

556
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,759
- Is that right?
- That's right.

557
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:21,960
Listen to me this one time
for your own good.

558
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,683
Don't be ridiculous,
take a load off,

559
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,683
- we're in the middle of a game.
- Strip poker.

560
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,686
Ms. Thornton, what's your drink?

561
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,313
Vodka. Whiskey.

562
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,835
- Hairspray. Antifreeze.
- Damn.

563
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,819
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Are you even in there?

564
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:39,911
All yours.

565
00:36:43,124 --> 00:36:44,724
The bottle's sweating.

566
00:36:45,275 --> 00:36:47,322
Icy cold, thick,

567
00:36:47,781 --> 00:36:49,039
pours like oil.

568
00:36:50,016 --> 00:36:51,463
I don't know what you is,

569
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:55,294
but I feeling you
and you're a soulless bitch.

570
00:36:57,529 --> 00:36:58,966
That almost hurt.

571
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,031
I am clean and sober,
as you well know.

572
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:04,346
I'll never take nothing
from you except my girl.

573
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,725
- Let's go.
- Fuck off.

574
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,558
She's my girlfriend, talk to me.

575
00:37:08,085 --> 00:37:09,247
You ain't a boyfriend,

576
00:37:09,372 --> 00:37:12,187
you're a domestically
violentsick motherfucker.

577
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,023
- Get up, I ain't playing. Let's go.
- She's not going anywhere.

578
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,526
I'm begging you,
don't let them do you like this.

579
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,278
We'll keep you safe.

580
00:37:20,662 --> 00:37:22,197
It would be the first fucking time.

581
00:37:22,595 --> 00:37:24,741
Your eyes. What'd you do to her?

582
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,118
Throw a bible at me now.

583
00:37:27,853 --> 00:37:29,111
Pull my hair,

584
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:32,457
scratch my face,
break my head with a bottle.

585
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,963
Hit me back.

586
00:37:35,175 --> 00:37:36,585
I won't hit you back.

587
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,299
Go ahead and kill me,
I'll never strike you again.

588
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,759
Leave him alone.

589
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,719
Move.

590
00:37:49,515 --> 00:37:50,559
Hurry up.

591
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:52,853
Don't bother.

592
00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:56,041
Go on, run, you fools.

593
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,827
Go. Go. Go.

594
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,167
She'll come back
and she'll bring them with her.

595
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:03,292
Come on.

596
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,684
Do you have any fucking idea
of the PR mess you've made?

597
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:16,045
And who fucking has
to clean that shit up?

598
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,997
Me. Not you, me.

599
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,589
I should drain every one
of you bastards.

600
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:24,509
Stan went after the church on his own.
None of us knew anything about it.

601
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:27,429
Really. Because everyone
who met Stan in the last 300 years

602
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,135
knew he had a kink about
slaughtering humans.

603
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,862
But you, his nest mates,
his Sheriff, had no clue.

604
00:38:32,987 --> 00:38:35,478
And how were we supposed to know
that this time he meant it?

605
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,397
Not my problem.
Yours.

606
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,985
- Don't talk to him that way.
- Don't talk to me that way.

607
00:38:44,636 --> 00:38:47,741
Let's get to the point.
How did they manage to abduct you?

608
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,298
They would have taken
one of us sooner or later.

609
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,621
I offered myself.

610
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,083
- Why?
- Why not?

611
00:38:56,392 --> 00:38:59,181
They wanted you to meet the sun.
And you were willing.

612
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,324
What do you think?

613
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,094
I think you're out of your mind.

614
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,122
- And then I hear about a traitor.
- Irrelevant.

615
00:39:12,247 --> 00:39:14,767
Only a rumor,
I'll take full responsibility.

616
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,813
- You bet you will.
- You cold bitch.

617
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:19,312
Listen,

618
00:39:19,894 --> 00:39:22,025
this is a national vampire disaster

619
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,312
and nobody at the top has
any sympathy for any of you.

620
00:39:25,437 --> 00:39:27,699
Sheriff, you fucked up.
You're fired.

621
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:29,983
I agree, of course.

622
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,125
Isabel should take over.
She had no part in my disgrace.

623
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,956
Godric, fight back.

624
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,959
What are you saying? She's a bureaucrat,
you don't have to take shit from her.

625
00:39:39,316 --> 00:39:42,254
- You wanna lose your area, viking?
- You don't have that kind of power.

626
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,422
I'm on TV.

627
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:46,053
- Try me.
- I'm to blame.

628
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,873
I should have contained Stan
the second Godric went missing.

629
00:39:55,146 --> 00:39:57,227
I remove myself
from all positions of authority.

630
00:39:58,841 --> 00:39:59,991
Works for me.

631
00:40:01,852 --> 00:40:03,210
I owe him.

632
00:40:03,572 --> 00:40:04,807
Ms. Flanagan,

633
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,113
Godric rescued me
from a really large rapist

634
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:10,490
who probably would've killed me too.

635
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,367
- That's nice. Moving on.
- Listen,

636
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:15,871
And he rescued humans in that church
plus a whole lot of vampires.

637
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,387
You think it's a PR mess now,
it could have been a hundred,

638
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:21,449
a million times worse.

639
00:40:21,574 --> 00:40:22,919
You should thank him.

640
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,379
For getting kidnapped?

641
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:26,201
For attracting a suicide bomber?

642
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:28,467
For piss-poor judgment?
I think not.

643
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,677
Don't.

644
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,764
It doesn't matter.

645
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:45,894
Tell me about the bombing, please.
Every single detail.

646
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,963
A boy walked in the lair.

647
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:52,665
I thought he was
someone's human companion.

648
00:40:54,698 --> 00:40:56,376
I sacrificed everything

649
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:59,523
for that child
without a thought for myself.

650
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,833
He doesn't notice.
He doesn't care.

651
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:03,358
He isn't grateful.

652
00:41:04,537 --> 00:41:06,207
He's running wild now,

653
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,195
he's headed straight for hell.

654
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:18,331
The God Who Comes
demands his sacrifice.

655
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:20,769
Where is Sam Merlotte?.

656
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:24,815
He ain't been here all day.

657
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,340
Well, find him and bring him to me.

658
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:29,528
A while back
he was planning to leave.

659
00:41:31,277 --> 00:41:32,864
Bring him to me.

660
00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:49,340
<i>... watch him, grab him,
he almost got you, Mike. </i>

661
00:41:49,862 --> 00:41:53,218
<i>- He almost got you.
- Come on. It's the 21st century.</i>

662
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,564
<i>There's gotta be a way... Crap. </i>

663
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,056
<i>That is one nutty ostrich. </i>

664
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,641
<i>Come on, Mike, come on,
now, grab his hand... </i>

665
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:04,270
I heard you were here.

666
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:13,279
What a fucking fiasco.

667
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:15,447
You're lucky I don't send
you all to the Magister.

668
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,728
Godric, come to my suite
to fill out the forms.

669
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:19,853
Soon.

670
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,907
First I have something to say.

671
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:28,792
I'm sorry.

672
00:42:31,793 --> 00:42:34,676
I apologize for all
the harm I've caused,

673
00:42:37,512 --> 00:42:39,010
for all our lost ones,

674
00:42:39,671 --> 00:42:41,071
human and vampire.

675
00:42:44,232 --> 00:42:45,682
I will make amends,

676
00:42:46,852 --> 00:42:47,772
I swear it.

677
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,292
Take it easy, it's just
a few signatures.

678
00:43:03,971 --> 00:43:06,131
- Look in my heart.
- Listen to me.

679
00:43:06,256 --> 00:43:08,434
- There's nothing to say.
- There is.

680
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:10,739
On the roof.

681
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,295
We have a score to settle.

682
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:23,475
- Not now.
- Yes, now.

683
00:43:30,853 --> 00:43:32,859
Have I made my point?

684
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:34,028
It's done.

685
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,070
I'm part of her now.

686
00:43:42,011 --> 00:43:43,461
Get out of the way.

687
00:44:10,455 --> 00:44:11,897
I'm going to find Godric.

688
00:44:12,726 --> 00:44:15,276
None of this has anything
to do with us.

689
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:17,529
Godric is not your concern.

690
00:44:17,893 --> 00:44:20,573
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be standing here.

691
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:22,826
He's in pain,

692
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,036
he's suffering.
I gotta do something.

693
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:27,998
Don't you think
we've done enough for Dallas.

694
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:31,167
You of all people should
understand how he feels.

695
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:34,281
What if it were you, Bill?

696
00:44:36,086 --> 00:44:38,758
What if in 1800 years,
you were Godric?

697
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:47,277
All right, but I'm coming with you.

698
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:52,053
I wish you could,
but it'll be dawn in a little while.

699
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:54,774
If we don't stay long, I'll heal.

700
00:44:55,653 --> 00:44:58,494
I will not let you take the chance.

701
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:02,807
With Godric there,
you don't have to worry about me.

702
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:07,681
You are so tender-hearted,

703
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,655
you feel obligated, I can see that.

704
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:14,305
But, Sookie, in all honesty,

705
00:45:15,093 --> 00:45:16,793
what can you do for him?

706
00:45:18,164 --> 00:45:19,090
I don't know.

707
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,858
I just gotta be there.

708
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:23,845
It doesn't make sense,

709
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:26,722
but you understand?

710
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:29,361
I do.

711
00:45:47,523 --> 00:45:49,788
Two thousand years is enough.

712
00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:51,609
I can't accept this,

713
00:45:53,288 --> 00:45:54,417
it's insanity.

714
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,920
Our existence is insanity.

715
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,175
- We don't belong here.
- But we are here.

716
00:46:02,609 --> 00:46:03,885
It's not right.

717
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:07,317
- We're not right.
- There is no right and wrong.

718
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,950
Only survival

719
00:46:10,073 --> 00:46:11,267
or death.

720
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,978
I told a lie,
as it turns out.

721
00:46:14,552 --> 00:46:16,602
I will keep you alive by force.

722
00:46:18,538 --> 00:46:19,859
Even if you could,

723
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,727
why would you be so cruel?

724
00:47:03,525 --> 00:47:04,525
Let me go.

725
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,623
I won't let you die alone.

726
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:18,376
Yes, you will.

727
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,139
As your Maker

728
00:47:38,928 --> 00:47:40,128
I command you.

729
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,225
I'll stay with him.
As long as it takes.

730
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:20,816
It won't take long.

731
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,892
Not at my age.

732
00:48:27,831 --> 00:48:29,881
You know, it wasn't very smart.

733
00:48:30,967 --> 00:48:33,017
The Fellowship of the Sun part.

734
00:48:34,894 --> 00:48:35,894
I know.

735
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,620
I thought it might fix
everything somehow.

736
00:48:42,397 --> 00:48:44,836
But I don't think
like a vampire any more.

737
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,943
- Do you believe in God?
- Yes.

738
00:48:56,526 --> 00:48:57,826
If you're right,

739
00:49:00,035 --> 00:49:01,396
how will he punish me?

740
00:49:01,863 --> 00:49:03,313
God doesn't punish,

741
00:49:04,047 --> 00:49:05,197
God forgives.

742
00:49:07,026 --> 00:49:08,476
I don't deserve it.

743
00:49:10,986 --> 00:49:12,073
But I hope for it.

744
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:13,967
We all do.

745
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,360
You'll care for him?

746
00:49:20,469 --> 00:49:22,500
I'm not sure, you know how he is.

747
00:49:23,468 --> 00:49:25,044
I can take the blame for that too.

748
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:26,213
Maybe not.

749
00:49:27,469 --> 00:49:29,319
Eric's pretty much himself.

750
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:41,201
Are you very afraid?

751
00:49:46,918 --> 00:49:48,218
I'm full of joy.

752
00:49:49,866 --> 00:49:51,430
But the pain...

753
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,926
I want to burn.

754
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,860
I'm afraid for you.

755
00:50:06,121 --> 00:50:07,971
A human with me at the end,

756
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,551
and human tears.

757
00:50:13,357 --> 00:50:15,031
Two thousand years,

758
00:50:17,175 --> 00:50:18,848
and I can still be surprised.

759
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:26,295
In this, I see God.

760
00:50:50,763 --> 00:50:52,106
Goodbye, Godric.
