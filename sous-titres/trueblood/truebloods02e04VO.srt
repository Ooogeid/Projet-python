1
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:02,509
I can smell that hot blood
just under your skin,

2
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:05,387
and, cowboy, you smell awesome.

3
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:07,423
- Fuck you.
- That can be arranged.

4
00:01:07,548 --> 00:01:09,315
But I'm gonna kill you first.

5
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,589
Teacher's pet was scared.

6
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:32,139
You got him.

7
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:34,468
I was scared.

8
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:36,929
Vampires are scary.

9
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,545
How's that lip?

10
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:40,895
It's okay.

11
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,010
How's your nose?

12
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:47,146
Vampires

13
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,460
are not

14
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:51,398
a joke!

15
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:01,646
There's a war going on.

16
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:05,666
And you're either on the dark side

17
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,420
or you're on the side of the light.

18
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,708
And there ain't no in-between.

19
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:15,301
I think you broke my nose.

20
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:48,143
Sync: mpm & Arrow
for the sub factory

21
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,041
I'm so sorry, okay, Bill?

22
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,447
- I know how this must look.
- Get out of my house.

23
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,198
Bill, do not hurt him.

24
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,609
I swear,

25
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:06,479
- I wouldn't let it go any further.
- I said, get out of my house.

26
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:08,666
- It's my house too.
- Jessica, upstairs.

27
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,124
Okay, let's all just
try to calm down.

28
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:12,838
- Good idea.
- Are you gonna leave,

29
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:16,589
or am I gonna have to throw you out
through a window that is closed?

30
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,421
Bill, that is just rude.

31
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:19,886
Sookie, I've got this.

32
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,844
I'm going. I'm going.

33
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,187
I wasn't gonna do nothing.

34
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,099
It's not her that I'm protecting.

35
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:45,367
I don't believe him for a minute.

36
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:57,348
We established there was to be
no hunting in this house.

37
00:04:58,797 --> 00:04:59,797
Look,

38
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:02,176
I know you feel like shit
because you had to make me,

39
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:03,886
and you should feel like shit.

40
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:06,065
But guess what.

41
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,599
I'd never even kissed a boy
before that.

42
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,826
Meeting Hoyt's the only
good thing that's happened to me

43
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:15,064
since my whole new life started.

44
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:18,516
Now, I'm not ready
for anything to happen too fast.

45
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:22,196
I'd have been happy just to go on
kissing him all night long.

46
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,613
Now, is it my fault my fangs come out
when I get turned on?

47
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:44,090
I think I'm going to like her.

48
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,646
Sookie, do not make the mistake
of thinking you two can be girlfriends.

49
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,014
- She is...
- Yeah, I get it. She's a vampire.

50
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:55,541
Believe me,
I learned my lesson about that.

51
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,106
But, Bill, I think we should
take her with us to Dallas.

52
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:01,644
I think it would be good for you,
because I think, deep down,

53
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:05,155
you don't like vampires,
even though you are one.

54
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:06,332
So?

55
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:09,243
Hating yourself is a bad thing.

56
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:13,080
I am a vampire.
I am supposed to be tormented.

57
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:15,208
You're not just a vampire.

58
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,408
And Jessica doesn't
have to be either.

59
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:21,004
You can teach her how to walk that line
between vampire and human.

60
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,006
Yes, because I have mastered that.

61
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,182
Okay, so you can teach each other.

62
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:31,835
It's so different for her.

63
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:41,153
When I was made, one had no choice

64
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:44,201
but to live completely outside
the human world

65
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:47,072
as an outlaw.

66
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:49,028
A hunter.

67
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,290
Humans were prey and nothing else.

68
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,320
I envy her.

69
00:07:05,032 --> 00:07:07,969
I'll need to call the airline
to arrange for two travel coffins

70
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,594
instead of just one.

71
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,135
Isn't it exciting?

72
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:15,985
Our first trip together.

73
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:19,208
Oh, come on, Bill.

74
00:07:20,034 --> 00:07:22,084
I was almost killed last night.

75
00:07:22,537 --> 00:07:23,537
Again.

76
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:26,385
At least give me this.

77
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:39,475
Do you do this a lot?

78
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,541
Swim?

79
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,916
At night.

80
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,444
Actually, I do.

81
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,918
I love when it's dark.

82
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:51,723
You have to focus
on all your other senses.

83
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:53,593
It's amazing what we can feel

84
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:56,425
when you take away
the "looking at things" part.

85
00:07:56,854 --> 00:07:57,854
You know?

86
00:07:58,414 --> 00:08:00,906
I think it's also
because there's no people here.

87
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:03,293
Ain't no boats,

88
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,205
no car stereos blasting crap music,

89
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:12,164
nobody saying stupid things way
too loud because they're drunk.

90
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:14,233
Just the world.

91
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:18,798
Like it was when it was
brand-spanking-new.

92
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:23,807
It is kind of paradise, Bon Temps.

93
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,533
This little old hick town?

94
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:28,443
Why not?

95
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:31,925
There's not a whole hell
of a lot to do, for one thing.

96
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,115
So there's less to distract you

97
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,353
from just being where you are
when you're there.

98
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,607
What about the aggressively
ignorant people that live here?

99
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,560
Who are very loyal clientele.

100
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,748
Once they decide they like a place,

101
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:46,866
they stop looking
for anywhere else to go.

102
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:48,367
And they like to drink.

103
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:50,402
What are you, president of the JCs?

104
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,009
I'm just a guy
who likes where he lives.

105
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:58,745
Home sweet home, huh?

106
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:03,076
I thought it was.

107
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:06,287
I don't know,
I might be heading off soon.

108
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:08,622
Where to?

109
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:11,181
Someplace probably a lot like this.

110
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:14,494
You ain't never lived in the city?

111
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:18,313
Cities bring out
the worst in people.

112
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,530
They loose touch with nature.
It's where they come from.

113
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:26,535
People do that here too.

114
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:28,100
Not in the same way.

115
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:35,597
My fingertips
are turning into raisins,

116
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:37,462
and I feel like pancakes.

117
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:40,561
There's a 24-hour truck stop

118
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:42,819
out on I-20 toward Arcadia,
makes the best...

119
00:09:42,944 --> 00:09:44,963
- Sweet potato pancakes.
- You know it?

120
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:46,855
Do you wanna come with me?

121
00:09:49,762 --> 00:09:51,468
I'm not really that hungry.

122
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:56,133
You're worried about me
seeing you naked.

123
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:58,013
I have seen boy parts before.

124
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:01,148
Water ain't exactly opaque.

125
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,964
I promise I'll start looking
for my own place as soon as I...

126
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,454
<i>I asked you to move in,
not crash for a few days. </i>

127
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:25,829
<i>You're family. </i>

128
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:29,578
<i>A limo is picking me up
at 5 today, so...</i>

129
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:31,017
I'm on my way.

130
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,382
Love you the most.

131
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,683
<i>Love you more. </i>

132
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:38,457
Who do you love the most?

133
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,687
What do you have planned today?

134
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:49,815
I think I'm gonna be taking off.

135
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:51,942
For taking off work?
Fabulous.

136
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:55,510
No, I'm gonna go live with Sookie.

137
00:10:57,796 --> 00:11:00,033
I'm very sorry to hear that.

138
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,785
I mean, me being here
was always supposed to be temporary.

139
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:04,997
Everything's temporary, Tara.

140
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:08,078
I don't really
wanna dance right now, okay?

141
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:12,143
Of course.

142
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:15,666
What happened?

143
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:17,577
You fit so well here,

144
00:11:17,702 --> 00:11:20,597
and you seemed to be having
so much fun last night.

145
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,555
I think everybody was having a
little too much fun last night.

146
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,654
Will you tell Eggs I left?

147
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:36,389
Sure.

148
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:42,456
I'm gonna miss you.

149
00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:47,272
Thank you so much for everything.

150
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:54,253
I'm sure you'd do the same for me.

151
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,044
Go.

152
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,730
Flourish.

153
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:02,978
And don't every say no to yourself.

154
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:16,284
I don't know who Lazarus was,

155
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:19,539
but he sure as hell
was not the first vampire.

156
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:21,566
Everybody knows it was Dracula.

157
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,284
It's in the Bible, moron.

158
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:27,412
Jesus brought Lazarus
back from the dead.

159
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,580
So Jesus made the first vampire?

160
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,458
Maybe Jesus was the first vampire.

161
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:34,174
I mean, he rose from the dead too.

162
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:37,308
And he told people,
"Hey, y'all, drink my blood.

163
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:39,863
"It'll give you special powers. "

164
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:41,218
Jesus never said that.

165
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,344
No, the first vampire was Cain.

166
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,199
Being a vampire is the mark of Cain.

167
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:47,934
It's God's punishment for bringing
the first evil into the world

168
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,226
by killing his brother.

169
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:53,522
The first evil was Eve
eating the apple.

170
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:56,426
That's why they call it "evil".

171
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,778
That wasn't evil. That was
just skirting the rules.

172
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:02,869
Evil is making
the "premedicated" choice

173
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:04,528
to be a dick.

174
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,660
<i>Jason Stackhouse,
please meet Reverend Newlin</i>

175
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,237
<i>outside the administration offices.</i>

176
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,137
There's one thing you can count on:

177
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,776
God will make sure
evil gets punished.

178
00:13:21,994 --> 00:13:23,552
Then explain Europe to me.

179
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:31,685
Morning.

180
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,354
Ain't she a beauty?

181
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:38,400
Let's you and me
take a little trip together.

182
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:42,111
Am I in trouble?

183
00:13:42,565 --> 00:13:44,370
We're all in trouble, Jason.

184
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:46,992
As long as there are vampires
in the world.

185
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,007
I still haven't moved into Gran's room,
but you go ahead and take mine.

186
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,544
And when I get back,

187
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,769
we'll celebrate properly.

188
00:14:05,634 --> 00:14:08,145
Until then, happy birthday.

189
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:24,336
I miss her so much.

190
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:26,889
I know.

191
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:28,933
I do too.

192
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:42,879
So why'd y'all pick Dallas
for your trip?

193
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:46,872
Bill has some business there.

194
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,473
Hell, do those vampires
wanna use your mind-reading again?

195
00:14:52,894 --> 00:14:54,738
I have Bill there to protect me.

196
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,645
Why are you even with this guy
if he makes you do these things?

197
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,231
The sex can'be that good.

198
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,659
It's pretty good.

199
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:03,235
- And I love him.
- Well, yeah, but...

200
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:05,599
You can't just sit around
saving your heart

201
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:08,823
for some perfect idea of a man
who's never gonna come along.

202
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,551
Life is too damn short.

203
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:14,719
Besides, Bill's not making me
do anything.

204
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:18,208
I agreed to this
to save your fool cousin,

205
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,638
thank you very much.

206
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,007
- He didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?

207
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:26,951
I didn't even know
he was back. Is he okay?

208
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:30,426
I heard there's been
panther sightings in Nakatosh.

209
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:32,511
There are too wide for a panther.

210
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,441
I can tell you this: There's
some nasty poison in that wound.

211
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:38,343
My guess is it paralyzed her.

212
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:41,231
She was alive when they took the heart,
and that's what killed her.

213
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:44,346
- So it was an animal?
- That did that, definitely.

214
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:46,927
The chest was carved
with a knife though.

215
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:50,865
Yeah, I got real clear incisions,
so unless you can think of an animal

216
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,984
that can wield a hunting knife...

217
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,090
We are looking at
a human/animal collaboration.

218
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,330
Bud, that doesn't make any sense.

219
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,410
I was making what people
with actual sense of humor

220
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,763
refer to as a joke.

221
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:03,795
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,395
A black woman is paralyzed
and then butchered to death

223
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,121
in the town where I live.

224
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:11,386
I didn't realize that was funny.

225
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,269
I wanna ask about the pig
I seen in this report

226
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:17,976
you wrote up after Tara's car wreck.

227
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,780
Andy, what are you doing
looking through those files?

228
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:24,751
I'm going to the gym.

229
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,980
Been spending some time
with my shirt off recently.

230
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:30,805
So, you guys lock up after me. Okay?

231
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:34,292
Did you get a good look at that pig?

232
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:35,618
There wasn't any pig.

233
00:16:35,854 --> 00:16:37,981
Tara was so drunk
she drove off the road.

234
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:40,169
- She was making up shit to hide it.
- Was it brown?

235
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:42,167
Because I've seen that pig
in a dollhouse.

236
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:46,129
- Andy, you're drunk. On the job.
- I ain't drunk.

237
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,173
Like you never had a beer
in the middle of the day.

238
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,634
I'm not an alcoholic.

239
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,328
You're just a dumb old man
who don't know anything about nothing

240
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:55,930
- who doesn't wanna learn.
- That's not cool, Andy.

241
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:57,167
I know.

242
00:16:59,673 --> 00:17:00,840
I'm sorry, Bud.

243
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,174
I know you are.

244
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,440
But I need to be able
to count on you in this job,

245
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,682
and I can't do that
if you're drinking.

246
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,425
- Give me your badge.
- Hell, no.

247
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:41,267
I know you in there,
even if you won't pick up the phone.

248
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:42,894
Damn, hooker, shit.

249
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,751
How come I have to hear about
you being back from Sookie?

250
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,224
- What else she tell you?
- That you got shot

251
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:09,753
and fed on and chained up
in some vampire dungeon.

252
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:12,548
Sookie need to keeper mouth shut,
and so do you.

253
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:15,009
Have you been to the hospital?

254
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:17,316
What you think gonna happen
if I show up to the ER

255
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:18,629
with a gunshot wound?

256
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:20,671
I don't need the police
up in my business.

257
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:22,255
You need to see a doctor.

258
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,291
For what?

259
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:26,146
So they can give me drugs
I already got?

260
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:29,317
I don't left a message
on Uncle Cyrus' voicemail.

261
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,812
I'm gonna be okay.

262
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,863
I'm gonna stay here and
make sure you're taken care of.

263
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:38,111
- Oh, no, you're not.
- It's my birthday.

264
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:42,120
Hooker, look. I'm not in the partying
mood right now, okay?

265
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,198
You don't have to do anything.
I'll sit here and watch TV with you.

266
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:46,374
Bitch, look,

267
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,887
you know I love you,

268
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:49,012
all right?

269
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,440
But I just spent two and a half weeks
thinking I'm gonna die at any second.

270
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,381
I ain't got it in me
to take care of you tonight.

271
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:56,718
All right?

272
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:04,451
If you die,
I'm gonna be really pissed.

273
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,144
That makes the two of us.

274
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:20,895
I thought you was leaving.

275
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,198
- Haven't left yet.
- That mean you ain't leaving?

276
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:25,549
- Nope, it means I haven't left yet.
- So you are leaving?

277
00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:27,024
Haven't left yet.

278
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,585
Dumbass.

279
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:33,040
Are there any lunch specials?

280
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:37,759
I think I got everything
I need to make Jailhouse Chili.

281
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,512
Are you sure? Because last time,
you forgot the corn chips.

282
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:41,930
Shit!

283
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:45,213
Right.

284
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:49,599
We'll just call
whatever this turns out to be

285
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:51,532
Terry's Scramble.

286
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,942
Scrambled Terry's Scramble.

287
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,151
Hush.

288
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,403
I just don't know
if I can do it, Sookie.

289
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,739
Do what?

290
00:20:01,153 --> 00:20:03,993
Run this place when Sam leaves town.
It's too much pressure.

291
00:20:04,716 --> 00:20:06,099
Sam's leaving town?

292
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,532
He's supposed to be this morning.

293
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:11,708
Sam, were you gonna tell me
you were leaving?

294
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:14,170
You weren't here.

295
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:26,666
Where are you going?

296
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:30,640
Oh, for Pete's sake, Sam.

297
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,939
I know it seems like I led you on,

298
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,504
but cut me some slack.

299
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:37,777
My grandmother had just been murdered.
Rene was after me.

300
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,688
- I didn't think Bill was coming back.
- Jesus Christ,

301
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:42,537
I really don't have time for this.

302
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:45,560
If you care about our friendship
I suggest you make time for it.

303
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:48,329
Look, I got serious shit
that I'm dealing with right now.

304
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,727
Making you feel better
is not high on my list.

305
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:54,043
I get serious shit
that I'm dealing with too.

306
00:20:56,415 --> 00:20:58,362
And because of some of that shit,
I'm gonna...

307
00:20:58,487 --> 00:20:59,883
need to take off a couple days.

308
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,606
Fine. I probably won't be here
when you get back.

309
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:06,571
Is that really how
you want to leave things?

310
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:09,935
- What other way is there?
- I don't know,

311
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,021
but throwing away years of friendship
seems pretty damn stupid to me.

312
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,615
All right!

313
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:27,118
Here, aim this! Here we go!

314
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,371
Mr. Vampire.

315
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:32,999
You're gone!

316
00:21:39,313 --> 00:21:42,800
How do you like me now,
you scary-ass motherfuckers?

317
00:21:45,243 --> 00:21:46,144
Sorry.

318
00:21:46,475 --> 00:21:48,678
You are one hell of a shot, boy.

319
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:51,267
We ought to give you wooden
bullets instead of silver ones.

320
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:55,491
- Silver bullets are way cooler.
- Silver bullets won't kill a vampire,

321
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:57,969
they'll just bring him down
so he can be staked.

322
00:21:58,094 --> 00:21:59,971
But if you shoot a Fanger
straight in the heart

323
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:02,516
with a wooden bullet,
you are staking him right there.

324
00:22:02,995 --> 00:22:04,370
Makes them explode.

325
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:05,365
So I hear.

326
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:08,775
They just kind of fall apart.

327
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,454
It's like a water balloon.

328
00:22:12,308 --> 00:22:13,558
You've seen it?

329
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,550
Damn, I'm jealous.

330
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:21,123
That's got to be a sight
watching God's awesome power

331
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:23,841
just obliterate evil right
in front of your eyes.

332
00:22:26,936 --> 00:22:27,936
One day.

333
00:22:29,664 --> 00:22:30,814
One day soon.

334
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,520
<i>For young Rafael Cordova,
it was the beginning</i>

335
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,969
<i>of the longest day of his life. </i>

336
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,314
<i>Rafael first ran
with the Pamplona bulls</i>

337
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:42,440
<i>the week after he turned 18,</i>

338
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:45,067
<i>following in the footsteps
of his two older brothers,</i>

339
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:47,907
<i>and had run five consecutive
runs without a scratch. </i>

340
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:32,588
Surprise!

341
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:34,454
Surprise.

342
00:23:35,937 --> 00:23:37,248
Did we scare you?

343
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:39,701
Oh, my God!

344
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:42,252
What are y'all-?

345
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,672
Nobody should spend
their birthday alone.

346
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,299
How'd you even know?

347
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,566
- Kitchen?
- It's through there.

348
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,548
It's this way.

349
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:55,868
What were you crying about?

350
00:23:56,654 --> 00:23:58,571
I always cry on my birthday.

351
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,834
It's always the worst day.

352
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,111
No matter what I do I end up crying,

353
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:05,401
because my birthday always sucks.

354
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,908
This is the year that changes.

355
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:09,786
I promise you that.

356
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:17,515
We have been planning this party
for days,

357
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,750
but you threw a major monkey wrench
into things by moving out.

358
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,223
Is that a wedding cake?

359
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,630
Wedding. Birthday.
What's the difference?

360
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,340
It's all about casting off
the empty shell of what's dead

361
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:32,427
and embracing the mysteries
of what is yet to come.

362
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,594
We are gonna have
a wicked good time tonight.

363
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,886
I can feel it in my bones.
I've been on the phone all day

364
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:38,509
calling all your friends.

365
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:40,306
What friends?

366
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:45,031
Honey?

367
00:24:46,182 --> 00:24:47,906
- Two Buds, please.
- Two beers?

368
00:24:48,031 --> 00:24:49,970
Is that good?
That's why we need the day off,

369
00:24:50,095 --> 00:24:52,032
so we can have a beer
and relax now and then.

370
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,123
All right.

371
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,265
One,

372
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:55,708
two.

373
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,075
- Thanks, honey.
- It's really good.

374
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,156
Here, cheers!

375
00:24:59,472 --> 00:25:01,285
So how's it going?
You having fun?

376
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,136
No, this is just great.

377
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,098
Do you like country music?

378
00:25:05,223 --> 00:25:07,224
I can't get enough of it.

379
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:08,839
Mostly I listen to...

380
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:09,609
... I really like to hunt,

381
00:26:09,823 --> 00:26:12,260
- and I'd go hunting caribous?
- Really?

382
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,545
Would you believe
that Sarah used to be a vegetarian?

383
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:20,486
I know.

384
00:26:20,611 --> 00:26:22,521
Really?
She told you that?

385
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:26,686
I hope you boys are ready
for some true Southern decadence.

386
00:26:27,363 --> 00:26:30,588
You don't really eat Sarah's ribs.
It's more like you take a bath in them.

387
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:35,648
Hang on a sec.

388
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:37,306
Here let me.

389
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:40,557
- Let's see.
- Thank you.

390
00:26:41,925 --> 00:26:42,925
Thank you.

391
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,356
- Is that good?
- That smells good.

392
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:51,119
All right, smooth that right there.

393
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,505
Feels good.

394
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,125
Steve,

395
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,867
I think Jason has the makings
of a true soldier of God.

396
00:27:00,574 --> 00:27:02,995
- I was just thinking the same thing.
- No,

397
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,813
I got a long way to go.

398
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:07,417
Not as long as you might think.

399
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,713
God has chosen you...

400
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,771
- Amen.
- ... for His most glorious mission.

401
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:16,976
Praise His light.

402
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,415
We are forming an elite
spiritual army called

403
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,240
the Soldiers of the Sun.

404
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:24,350
And Jason,

405
00:27:25,363 --> 00:27:26,394
we need you.

406
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:28,949
God needs you.

407
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:34,698
What a blessing.

408
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:42,326
All right.

409
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:44,078
Another Scotch and Coke.

410
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,641
I'll take care of him.

411
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:53,963
It's a slow night.

412
00:27:54,165 --> 00:27:55,365
Lucky for you.

413
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:59,218
- I thought you quit drinking.
- I thought I did too.

414
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:04,807
Well, I don't want your sister
giving me grief if you wreck her car.

415
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:06,344
So I'm cutting you off.

416
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:08,352
Fuck you, Merlotte.

417
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:12,262
That's the Scotch talking
otherwise I might need to say,

418
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:13,837
"Go fuck yourself".

419
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:16,727
I ain't even got an office anymore.

420
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:18,733
Bud took my badge.

421
00:28:18,858 --> 00:28:21,135
You'll get it back
when you sober up and you know it.

422
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,158
Now, go home.

423
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,077
So my tight-ass sister
and even tighter-ass grandmama

424
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:27,434
can look at me like I'm a big loser?

425
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:28,609
No, thanks.

426
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,958
No more drinks for Andy.

427
00:28:38,077 --> 00:28:39,342
He's the only one in here.

428
00:28:39,673 --> 00:28:42,039
No one else has come in
for over an hour.

429
00:28:42,164 --> 00:28:43,929
- Your point?
- Let's close up early,

430
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,574
I want to go to Tara's party.

431
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:47,266
Tara's having a party?

432
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:49,073
Yeah. At Sookie's.

433
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:51,116
For her birthday.

434
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:54,439
You know that real elegant woman
that Tara's friends with?

435
00:28:54,564 --> 00:28:57,440
She's throwing it, and I heard
she knows how to throw a party.

436
00:28:57,565 --> 00:28:59,536
She sure does.
I can tell you that.

437
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:00,946
Fantastic food.

438
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,574
Now I need to ask Tara about a pig.

439
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,403
- So can we go?
- Go where?

440
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,417
- Home.
- Party at the old Stackhouse place.

441
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:10,984
Party?
Well, you can count me in.

442
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:13,316
I've been working hard enough
for one day.

443
00:29:15,263 --> 00:29:16,313
You going?

444
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,547
I don't think so.

445
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:21,884
I hope you change your mind.

446
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:29,392
Hey, Miss Thornton.

447
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,610
Tara here?

448
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,478
No, she's off today.

449
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,266
Y'all go ahead.

450
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:39,084
Go ahead, I'll close up.

451
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,197
How is she?

452
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,703
She's okay.

453
00:29:46,873 --> 00:29:48,423
As far as I can tell.

454
00:29:49,564 --> 00:29:51,203
Y'all ain't together no more?

455
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:57,253
Good night, Arlene.

456
00:30:00,637 --> 00:30:02,337
Today's Tara's birthday.

457
00:30:02,749 --> 00:30:04,299
Twenty-six years old.

458
00:30:05,744 --> 00:30:07,096
Would you give this to her?

459
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:09,267
I don't know who else to ask.

460
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:14,311
Of course.

461
00:30:15,017 --> 00:30:16,017
Thank you.

462
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,288
<i>Anubis Airlines
welcomes you to Dallas,</i>

463
00:30:27,413 --> 00:30:29,696
<i>the most vampire-friendlydestination</i>

464
00:30:29,821 --> 00:30:31,721
<i>in the great state of Texas.</i>

465
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:38,902
That's me!

466
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,458
I've always loved these.
They're like booze for dolls.

467
00:30:47,104 --> 00:30:48,447
They gave me 10.

468
00:30:48,691 --> 00:30:50,931
You tell I was late.
Supposed to be here before sundown.

469
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:52,975
We got delayed for take-off.

470
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,703
Why don't you go in the limo.

471
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:57,313
- I got the A.C. cranked up.
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

472
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:00,191
Oh, go on.
There's Cokes in there.

473
00:31:04,884 --> 00:31:07,198
<i>Just get in the goddamn limo,
you stupid bitch.</i>

474
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:09,421
Get your hands off me!

475
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:13,082
Make a noise
and it will be your last.

476
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:18,000
How the hell does this thing open?

477
00:31:18,987 --> 00:31:20,763
Somebody help get me out of here.

478
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:21,670
Help!

479
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:51,881
A present?

480
00:31:52,383 --> 00:31:53,383
For me?

481
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:56,455
- I love presents.
- It's for Tara.

482
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,817
From her mom.

483
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,192
Gift table is in the dining room.

484
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:17,687
Well, I have to say,

485
00:32:17,812 --> 00:32:19,858
I'm impressed by your showing up.

486
00:32:21,227 --> 00:32:22,377
Okay, listen.

487
00:32:23,312 --> 00:32:24,655
Go ahead and turn me,

488
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:27,319
but you will also reveal
yourself in the process.

489
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:30,281
Reveal myself as what?

490
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:33,450
As whatever the hell you are.

491
00:32:35,785 --> 00:32:37,288
I don't know what you're doing,

492
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,659
but these are people I care about.

493
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:42,461
And I will not stand by
if you try to hurt any of them.

494
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,840
Even when they've dumped you

495
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:47,198
or chosen a dead man over you?

496
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:52,136
You're really not an Alpha, are you?

497
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:12,906
Who are all these people?

498
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,438
I don't see any other people.

499
00:33:14,563 --> 00:33:16,062
Because you only got eyes for me.

500
00:33:16,232 --> 00:33:18,500
Yeah, you don't like
that one bit, do you?

501
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,084
Seriously, who are all these people?

502
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,044
And why are they bringing me presents?
Not that I'm complaining.

503
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:27,331
I like the way you move.

504
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:28,887
I love to dance.

505
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:31,486
I can't even remember
the last time I did.

506
00:33:31,611 --> 00:33:32,962
That's just wrong.

507
00:33:33,132 --> 00:33:35,958
Anybody that dances like you
should dance every fucking day.

508
00:34:29,572 --> 00:34:30,873
Tell me your name.

509
00:34:30,998 --> 00:34:31,847
Leon.

510
00:34:32,272 --> 00:34:33,612
All right, Leon.

511
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:35,944
No one is going to hurt you.

512
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,794
Would you like to try?

513
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:42,919
Could I?

514
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:45,475
Here.

515
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,377
Lean in close
so you can catch his gaze.

516
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:51,766
And just let everything go.

517
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:55,693
Let yourself be dead.

518
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,329
You feel it?

519
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,325
You are empty.

520
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:04,253
A vacuum.

521
00:35:07,176 --> 00:35:09,576
Now you can pull his mind
into yours.

522
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:13,959
Everything's gonna be okay.

523
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,592
There's nothing to fear.

524
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,544
Don't you worry about a thing.
It's gonna be all right.

525
00:35:26,669 --> 00:35:28,167
You were very sweet with her.

526
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,548
Sookie, he was sent to abduct you.

527
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:33,953
It's gonna be just fine.

528
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:36,443
Which means somebody
knew you were coming.

529
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,721
Who do you think's behind it?
Vampires?

530
00:35:39,124 --> 00:35:40,174
Too sloppy.

531
00:35:41,981 --> 00:35:43,255
Maybe that church.

532
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,446
Bill, they may be crazy,
but they're still a church.

533
00:35:46,616 --> 00:35:48,766
They're not gonna kidnap anybody.

534
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,630
Churches have done much,
much worse throughout history.

535
00:35:56,115 --> 00:35:57,315
Just trust me.

536
00:36:01,314 --> 00:36:03,214
What's the dork face about?

537
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,412
I'm moving out.

538
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:07,539
I'm gonna be a Soldier of the Sun.

539
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,879
Really?

540
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:17,060
You heard of it?

541
00:36:17,185 --> 00:36:19,301
Of course I've heard of it,
it's why I came.

542
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,932
I guess you feel pretty special.

543
00:36:21,057 --> 00:36:23,043
Ain't nothing wrong
with feeling good

544
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,857
when you achieve something.

545
00:36:26,441 --> 00:36:27,851
I guess you wouldn't know.

546
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:30,786
So you think you

547
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:33,881
were the only one
they would choose to promote?

548
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,044
The only one of this whole camp?

549
00:36:36,582 --> 00:36:38,309
It is what it is.

550
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,121
It's 14 other guys is what it is.

551
00:36:41,504 --> 00:36:42,491
Including me.

552
00:36:42,756 --> 00:36:44,832
Yeah, even four girls.

553
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:47,051
That's great.

554
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:48,666
Congratulations.

555
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,041
You gonna bunk at the Newlin's too?

556
00:36:57,206 --> 00:36:58,206
I get it.

557
00:37:00,381 --> 00:37:02,613
Preacher's wife
needs something to play with.

558
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:06,682
- What?
- She wants your hot beef injection.

559
00:37:07,496 --> 00:37:09,223
I can't believe
I didn't see it sooner.

560
00:37:09,348 --> 00:37:10,435
That ain't true.

561
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:12,848
And you shouldn't talk about
Sarah that way.

562
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,817
You work fast.

563
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,369
I ain't working.

564
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:22,662
- She's married.
- Go for it. She's hot.

565
00:37:28,057 --> 00:37:29,557
She ain't like that.

566
00:37:32,393 --> 00:37:33,667
I earned this.

567
00:37:33,946 --> 00:37:35,296
I'm sure you did.

568
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,090
Fuck you.

569
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,330
I have you down
for a room with no bed?

570
00:37:50,357 --> 00:37:52,394
No, we need a bed.

571
00:37:52,956 --> 00:37:53,956
Of course.

572
00:37:54,788 --> 00:37:57,691
I do have a light-lockable room
with a king-sized bed.

573
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,233
It's a suite.

574
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,027
Double-soundproofed.

575
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,367
With an adjoining room for my...

576
00:38:04,572 --> 00:38:07,598
- What should I call her?
- Isn't there a vampire word?

577
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:08,929
Progeny.

578
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:10,599
Call her your ward.

579
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,632
You have a ward, like Bruce Wayne.

580
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:16,749
Would you give me your cell phone?

581
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,798
Thank you, Leon.

582
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:23,716
Everything's OK.

583
00:38:27,094 --> 00:38:28,992
Actually, everything's not okay.

584
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:31,558
All your worst fears

585
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,060
are about to come true.

586
00:38:34,423 --> 00:38:35,312
Unless

587
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,905
you scream at the top of your lungs:

588
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,946
These accommodations are being covered
by a third party, right?

589
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,490
Yes, sir, it's all been taking
care of by a Mr. Northman.

590
00:38:47,247 --> 00:38:49,451
Becky Eubanks is a stuck-up whore

591
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,900
who let Chase
finger her in the church.

592
00:38:57,279 --> 00:38:58,279
She's new.

593
00:40:29,815 --> 00:40:31,515
Good evening, Lafayette.

594
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,030
You can't come in
unless I invite you in,

595
00:40:36,155 --> 00:40:38,268
and I ain't nowhere near that crazy.

596
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:40,437
You have to come out eventually.

597
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:44,504
- I have all the time in the world.
- You let me go!

598
00:40:44,724 --> 00:40:46,735
I gave you a very generous gift.

599
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:49,321
The gift of not killing you.

600
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,270
And I'm here to give you
something else.

601
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:59,331
The healing elixir
that is my 1000-year-old blood.

602
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,570
I don't think that's a good idea.

603
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:11,510
Your leg's already infected.
I can smell it.

604
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:14,973
You don't get that taken care of,
you can lose it.

605
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,725
Why do you want
to give me your blood?

606
00:41:22,902 --> 00:41:24,815
- I like you.
- Bullshit.

607
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,821
You want to be able
to keep track of me. Why?

608
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:30,827
You obviously mean
something to Sookie.

609
00:41:31,103 --> 00:41:33,253
And what Sookie finds meaningful,

610
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:35,321
I find curious.

611
00:41:37,764 --> 00:41:39,927
You really have
no choice, Lafayette.

612
00:41:41,706 --> 00:41:42,806
You know it.

613
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:44,502
Fuck.

614
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,613
Leon, look at me.

615
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,660
Look at me, Leon.

616
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:07,524
Everything is going to be okay.

617
00:42:08,282 --> 00:42:09,432
No, it's not.

618
00:42:11,976 --> 00:42:13,290
My worst nightmares.

619
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,534
What on earth did you do to him?

620
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:16,825
I'm on the phone.

621
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:20,681
Maybe if you put your hand
on his shoulder.

622
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:23,373
Sometimes touching helps me
hear their thoughts better.

623
00:42:26,093 --> 00:42:28,693
- Who sent you?
- Fellowship of the Sun.

624
00:42:30,473 --> 00:42:32,841
- Are you a member?
- No, they hired me.

625
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,594
- Who specifically?
- I'm not sure. It was over the phone.

626
00:42:36,882 --> 00:42:39,306
Money was put in a locker for me
at a Greyhound station.

627
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,725
And they hired you
to do what exactly?

628
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,976
Abduct a human

629
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,627
with the Compton party
and bring her to the church.

630
00:42:45,752 --> 00:42:46,897
Do you know my name?

631
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:49,935
No, ma'am. I didn't even know
you were gonna be a woman.

632
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,414
All I know is a vampire's
using a human

633
00:42:53,624 --> 00:42:54,946
to find a vampire Godric.

634
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,615
Do you know where he is?

635
00:42:57,234 --> 00:42:58,734
No, ma'am, I do not.

636
00:43:06,214 --> 00:43:07,614
You did very well.

637
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:11,011
I'm sure your employers
will be pleased.

638
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:13,256
Think so?

639
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,341
Of course. What could you do?

640
00:43:15,812 --> 00:43:18,358
We never arrived.
It's not your fault.

641
00:43:20,777 --> 00:43:21,973
Flight never arrived.

642
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,768
We just weren't on it.

643
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,270
I got so nervous for nothing.

644
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,950
That's enough.

645
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,294
Don't be greedy.

646
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:49,709
You were supposed to call me
when you arrived.

647
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,461
We were ambushed at the airport.

648
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,880
- By whom?
- <i>You know exactly by whom, Eric.</i>

649
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,967
The Fellowship of the Sun. Why didn't
you tell me they were involved?

650
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,761
I didn't know for sure.
Now I do.

651
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,264
You could've shared your
suspicions with me.

652
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,150
I could've, but I didn't.

653
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:08,040
You should remember that
I am your sheriff, Bill.

654
00:44:08,214 --> 00:44:09,479
<i>We are not equal.</i>

655
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,925
And if that displeases you,
take it up with a majestor.

656
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,200
Or the queen.

657
00:44:22,957 --> 00:44:24,619
Get that shit.
There you go.

658
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,736
Get that shit.
Fuck it, get it.

659
00:44:28,698 --> 00:44:29,846
How's your leg?

660
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,711
Shit, I just want to fucking dance.

661
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,296
- Hit this.
- How nice for you.

662
00:44:34,918 --> 00:44:36,087
Come on, come on.

663
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,675
- Well, I must fly.
- Vegas, baby.

664
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,643
Vegas, baby, Vegas, baby.

665
00:44:54,137 --> 00:44:55,706
You getting situated okay?

666
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,170
Yes.
Thank you, ma'am.

667
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:01,817
Sure was fun today.

668
00:45:02,687 --> 00:45:03,837
Yeah, it was.

669
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:14,519
Are you nervous?

670
00:45:18,855 --> 00:45:19,855
A little.

671
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:21,791
Why?

672
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:24,736
Well, it's just that, uh...

673
00:45:27,296 --> 00:45:28,296
I ain't

674
00:45:29,197 --> 00:45:31,761
never been
in a place this nice before.

675
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,006
It's all too much.

676
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:36,952
Aren't you sweet.

677
00:45:42,191 --> 00:45:44,574
I am so proud of you.

678
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,742
Come on.

679
00:45:47,134 --> 00:45:48,134
So...

680
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:49,628
proud.

681
00:45:53,402 --> 00:45:55,202
Can I ask you a question?

682
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:58,838
Am I the only one staying here,
in your house?

683
00:46:01,286 --> 00:46:02,634
We had a special dorm

684
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:05,810
for the soldiers,
but it only sleeps 14.

685
00:46:06,752 --> 00:46:09,099
And you're number 15.

686
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:13,359
Good.

687
00:46:14,034 --> 00:46:14,896
Good.

688
00:46:15,987 --> 00:46:17,399
And you're also the best.

689
00:46:19,648 --> 00:46:23,136
I mean, the one that we have
the highest hopes for.

690
00:46:27,425 --> 00:46:29,925
I'm going to try not
to disappoint you.

691
00:46:31,594 --> 00:46:33,603
- You do that.
- Okay.

692
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:37,419
And, let me know
if you need anything,

693
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:39,921
because we're just
at the end of the hall.

694
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:41,680
Big double doors.

695
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,749
It's Eric. You wanted to talk.

696
00:47:03,536 --> 00:47:04,936
This is important.

697
00:47:07,722 --> 00:47:09,172
Meet me at the bar.

698
00:47:15,522 --> 00:47:16,522
Fudge.

699
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,770
I admire you, Bill.

700
00:47:22,221 --> 00:47:25,448
It takes a real vampire to admit
he cannot protect his human.

701
00:47:26,174 --> 00:47:28,992
And it takes a true monster
to not care about anyone

702
00:47:29,117 --> 00:47:30,844
or anything other than himself.

703
00:47:30,969 --> 00:47:32,307
I care about others.

704
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,190
You care about Godric.

705
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:38,480
You have no obligations
to Dallas or Texas.

706
00:47:38,718 --> 00:47:40,768
This is personal for you. Why?

707
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:45,358
I hope you'll enjoy
your blood substitute,

708
00:47:45,483 --> 00:47:47,447
which is costing me $45.

709
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:50,687
I have no intention of drinking it,
I just want you to pay for it.

710
00:47:50,812 --> 00:47:52,152
You're so mature.

711
00:47:52,277 --> 00:47:53,774
Answer the question.

712
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,206
Why this allegiance to Godric?

713
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:01,211
He's much beloved by his subjects.

714
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,049
Only kings and queens have
subjects, Eric, not sheriffs.

715
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,706
Godric could have been king
of Texas had he wanted.

716
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,971
He could have been king
of any vampire territory anywhere.

717
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:15,475
He is twice as old as I am
and very powerful.

718
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,229
There are none above him
in the new world.

719
00:48:20,118 --> 00:48:22,524
Well, if he's so powerful,
how could they abduct him?

720
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:24,882
Now, that is what worries me.

721
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:28,505
If one such as he
can be taken by humans,

722
00:48:29,745 --> 00:48:31,445
then none of us is safe.

723
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,658
What can I give you to release
Sookie from her agreement?

724
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:39,499
Nothing.

725
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:43,818
And since you like humans so much,

726
00:48:43,943 --> 00:48:45,797
I think you would want
to protect them.

727
00:48:46,768 --> 00:48:48,800
The vampires here,
they're like cowboys,

728
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:52,367
if they don't get Godric back,
they'll want justice.

729
00:48:53,368 --> 00:48:54,938
They'll start attacking people.

730
00:48:55,063 --> 00:48:57,350
Open aggression against humans?
That's insane.

731
00:48:59,185 --> 00:49:00,535
Well, it's Texas.

732
00:49:15,923 --> 00:49:16,923
Jesus.

733
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:18,911
Here.

734
00:49:51,725 --> 00:49:54,449
I've been wanting to do that
since you showed up tonight.

735
00:49:54,934 --> 00:49:56,084
I'm wondering

736
00:49:56,862 --> 00:49:59,027
if this is a good idea.

737
00:49:59,934 --> 00:50:01,789
It's a great idea.

738
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,667
You're sweet as hell

739
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:08,546
and adorable and scruffy
with that little grey in your hair

740
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,214
and that hot little nose.

741
00:50:12,484 --> 00:50:15,361
And, damn, boy, do you know
how to wear a pair of pants.

742
00:50:24,967 --> 00:50:26,167
What's wrong?

743
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,920
Listen,

744
00:50:29,746 --> 00:50:31,235
I need to tell you something.

745
00:50:33,556 --> 00:50:35,256
- No, you don't.
- Yes.

746
00:50:35,694 --> 00:50:37,283
- Yes, I do.
- No.

747
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,451
You don't.

748
00:50:41,806 --> 00:50:43,790
I know what you are.

749
00:53:14,463 --> 00:53:15,513
Who is it?

750
00:53:16,922 --> 00:53:18,691
I ordered something.
Is that okay?

751
00:53:20,755 --> 00:53:22,605
Male. Straight. B-negative.

752
00:53:24,715 --> 00:53:26,244
Hi, I'm Travis.

753
00:53:27,523 --> 00:53:28,913
That's for me.

754
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:34,331
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

755
00:53:34,456 --> 00:53:36,110
<i>Bill doesn't want her to do this.</i>

756
00:53:36,235 --> 00:53:39,058
<i>How old is he anyway?
He looks barely legal.</i>

757
00:53:39,355 --> 00:53:40,348
He's 21.

758
00:53:40,473 --> 00:53:42,260
<i>That's weird.
Almost like you read my mind.</i>

759
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:44,512
<i>I did read your mind.
Fuck,</i>

760
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,430
<i>Barry.
Just smile and act like</i>

761
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,558
<i>it's a coincidence.
Keep your stupid mouth shut.</i>

762
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,518
But it's not a coincidence, Barry.

763
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:58,543
Barry, wait.
