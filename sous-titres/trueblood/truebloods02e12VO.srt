1
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:10,176
She wants you downstairs
with the egg.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,033
Now.

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,133
What are you doing?

4
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:20,061
He's coming.

5
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:22,506
This means he's coming.

6
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:28,015
Tara, what...?

7
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,979
Lafayette, sweetie?

8
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:31,669
I'm your friend.

9
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:34,533
I know you're in there.
You don't want to do this.

10
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,870
<i>Prepare her for Bromios,
prepare her for Eleutherios</i>

11
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,607
- Take off your clothes.
- What?

12
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,260
<i>Listen to you.</i>

13
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:47,380
I have thousand-year-old
vampire blood in me.

14
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,216
Now, take off your fucking clothes!

15
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:09,002
Now put this on.

16
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,388
Get down here.
We're waiting for you.

17
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:27,730
Here she is,

18
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,356
just like you wanted.

19
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:34,385
Just in time.

20
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,513
What the hell are you doing in
my grandmother's wedding dress?

21
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,220
Welcome, Sookie.

22
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,101
You're gonna be my maid of honor.

23
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,723
- Eggs, let me go.
- Don't fight it. Just let it take you.

24
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,926
I've spent enough time
being taken recently.

25
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:23,346
You haven't been taken.
Just borrowed.

26
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:26,015
To go along with old,
new and blue over here.

27
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,623
Which one am I?

28
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,467
You have no right to wear that dress

29
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:31,669
I should have asked,
but I couldn't find you.

30
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:34,419
- You'll never use it anyway.
- Go to hell.

31
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:36,444
Please don't be so negative.

32
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:38,073
It is my day.

33
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:41,425
And you're in my house.
And those are my friends.

34
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:43,931
Plus Jane Bodenhouse.

35
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,293
I've always liked you, Sookie.
You give me extra pickles.

36
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,589
I don't know how you did
what you've done to them,

37
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:56,066
but I will not let this happen.

38
00:03:57,463 --> 00:03:58,463
Girls,

39
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:02,409
would you mind going
and helping with the refreshments?

40
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,512
I need to have a moment
with my maid of honor.

41
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:07,919
Come on, Lafayette.

42
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,291
And bring some vines.

43
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,553
You too, Eggs.

44
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:15,428
She's not going anywhere.

45
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,764
I'm all yours.
Give it your best.

46
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:28,309
My best what?

47
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,802
The electricity.

48
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:31,979
- Do it again.
- I can't.

49
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,732
It's never happened to me before.
I don't even know what it was.

50
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,371
I never felt anything like it.

51
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:39,653
It was like nature herself
was shooting out from your fingertips.

52
00:04:57,414 --> 00:05:00,174
That's hitting me.
You're not committing to this at all.

53
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,748
I do not have electrical powers.

54
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:04,011
I am a human being.

55
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,430
You keep saying that.

56
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,556
But if you were human...

57
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:17,282
I would have taken you over by now.

58
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:18,818
Come on.

59
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:21,211
It'll be our little secret.

60
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:23,447
What are you?

61
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,041
I'm a waitress.

62
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:27,441
What the fuck are you?

63
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,923
What good's it do you to keep
your mother locked up in her own house?

64
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:55,646
Norman Bates.

65
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:59,818
I'm gonna take everything you've said
for the last days about me, about Daddy,

66
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,945
and lock it up in a little box,
and forget it ever happened.

67
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,845
This is bigger
than your petty, little feelings.

68
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:10,369
A god is coming

69
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,079
into our midst.

70
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:17,163
Does any part of your puny brain
understand what that means?

71
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:21,781
We're staying home.

72
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:28,095
Think back.

73
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,181
Wasn't there ever a time
you felt someone,

74
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,434
or something, watching over you?

75
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:36,770
God.

76
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,575
You can call it that.

77
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,984
But it's not the same one
the blind billions worship.

78
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:45,451
And in your heart of hearts,

79
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:46,655
you know it.

80
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:53,505
Fine. Then what am I?

81
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,041
You're definitely beyond human.

82
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,048
I live off human energy.
And yours I can't channel.

83
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:01,045
That's very rare,

84
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,422
though surprisingly not unique
in this town.

85
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:09,762
You're marrying Sam?

86
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,032
Please.

87
00:07:14,322 --> 00:07:16,018
My husband is a god.

88
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:18,139
Sam is...

89
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:21,273
He's just the ideal wedding gift.

90
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:24,352
It's been such a long wait.

91
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,206
I'm sorry.
I'm getting a little overexcited.

92
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:30,074
- I'll smear everything.
- How do you know he's coming tonight?

93
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,369
No time has ever been more perfect.

94
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,312
I know my special sacrifice
is on his way.

95
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:39,187
He's done nothing to you.

96
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:43,653
He is the vessel.

97
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:45,756
He appeared to me naked,

98
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:49,093
a virgin, drawn to the very statue
that represents the birth of my god.

99
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:54,999
Should have sacrificed him then,
but I foolishly let him go.

100
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,185
By "sacrifice",
does that involve cutting out his heart?

101
00:07:59,322 --> 00:08:00,854
It's the food of the gods.

102
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:03,857
My husband will love it.

103
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:06,278
It's the very thing

104
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,861
that gives him life.

105
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:09,828
You'll never get Sam.

106
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:11,448
He can escape you.

107
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:14,096
That is why you are here.

108
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:16,212
It's fate.

109
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:19,123
Just as Sam Merlotte is the one

110
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,293
who will bring forth my husband,

111
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:22,793
you, my dear,

112
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,087
 are the one
who will bring forth Sam Merlotte.

113
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:29,049
The moment he learns where you are,

114
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:31,337
he'll come running like a dog.

115
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:33,814
Maybe even as a dog.

116
00:08:41,262 --> 00:08:42,262
There.

117
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:47,614
Isn't that beautiful?

118
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:04,053
How long does this game go on for?

119
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:05,377
We play to 5 million.

120
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,505
- She's way ahead.
- It's pure luck.

121
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:12,027
Yahtzee is the most egalitarian game
in the world.

122
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,563
You could be my social, physical,

123
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,513
or intellectual inferior,

124
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,223
but your chances are equal to mine.

125
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:20,058
It's the antidote for this world,

126
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,576
where things such as superiority
and inferiority do matter.

127
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,575
Speaking of which,
I heard about your maker.

128
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:29,234
That blows.

129
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:31,695
Thank you.

130
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:34,800
- Your Majesty is very kind...
- Yahtzee!

131
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:37,034
- That's six in a row.
- It is a magic.

132
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:38,285
I do not cheat.

133
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,995
What would be the point?

134
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,457
I'm sorry.
You were saying?

135
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,793
I was just saying thank you.
Your Majesty's kind...

136
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,079
Now I remember.

137
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,131
Did you know
that there's a maenad in Renard Parish?

138
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:53,457
Yes, that is the reason
I came to see you.

139
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:55,561
I wouldn't get involved
if I were you.

140
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,471
Stick to what you're good at.

141
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:00,691
I gave William Compton
a few bits of hand-me-down folklore

142
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:02,726
we've accumulated
over the centuries,

143
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,145
but who knows
if it's gospel or gorilla shit?

144
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,718
You know, I think
he's monogamous with his human.

145
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:12,696
He is in love with her, yes.

146
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:13,779
He is?

147
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:18,912
Of course he would be with her.

148
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,119
You probably are too.

149
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,267
I do not love humans.

150
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:27,406
She's not entirely human.

151
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,573
Have you tasted her?

152
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:31,588
Sadly, no.

153
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:32,891
Don't. Ever.

154
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,384
One vampire falling in love
is bad enough.

155
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:38,366
Bill Compton certainly has a knack
for finding trouble.

156
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:40,756
For instance,

157
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:44,226
how does he know
I'm having you sell vampire blood?

158
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:48,272
The guards hear everything.

159
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,859
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.

160
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:53,426
- There's no way he could...
- That is really bad.

161
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,367
He does not know
you are supplying it.

162
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:04,925
He'd better not.

163
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:07,578
I'm holding you responsible.

164
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,173
There they are.

165
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:18,927
Aren't yours lovely.

166
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:24,808
You may be the strongest,
oldest vampire in my queendom,

167
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:26,659
but if I wanted,

168
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:28,862
I could own your fangs as earrings.

169
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:30,589
Understand?

170
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,330
I will take care of Bill Compton.

171
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:36,135
Personally.

172
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,576
Your turn to make a Yahtzee.

173
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,521
You suck at this.

174
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,710
You sure you wanna go in
with no backup?

175
00:12:13,835 --> 00:12:15,183
You're my backup.

176
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,048
Now, this is Special Ops.

177
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:18,240
We're surgical.

178
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:19,344
One shot.

179
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:21,490
Say hello to my little friend.

180
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:24,898
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

181
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:27,996
I love the smell of nail polish
in the morning.

182
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:42,887
Holy shit.

183
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:45,038
That's Stackhouse property.

184
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,982
They got no right to do that.

185
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:52,033
You just gonna run in there?

186
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:53,889
We're way outnumbered.

187
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:58,106
Not with Kid Glock on my side.

188
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,300
And yours.

189
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,543
I never killed nobody before.

190
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,972
You see that house?

191
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,586
It's been in my family
for 150 years.

192
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:17,088
Now, what kind of man would stand by

193
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,257
while his grandmother's house
gets torn to the ground?

194
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:22,794
It's not my grandmother's house.

195
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,564
But it's in the town
you swore to protect.

196
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:30,608
It's times like these when this
town needs a good man, Andy.

197
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:32,706
And that man...

198
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:33,909
is us.

199
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:35,959
Let's hit it.

200
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,605
Detective Bellefleur.

201
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,730
Frisk me.

202
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:47,903
Hey, get off.

203
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,930
No one sees the bride
before the wedding.

204
00:13:56,055 --> 00:13:58,670
- The what?
- Step away from the house.

205
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,424
Don't fight it.

206
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,137
- Where are you?
- Right here.

207
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:11,558
He's coming!

208
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,133
Fuck, yeah!

209
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:22,903
All right,

210
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:24,905
they're asleep in the trailer.

211
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,159
Lisa was so worried about her mom
she was afraid to go to bed.

212
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:32,514
If you'd let me glamour them,
they would have been asleep in seconds.

213
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:35,207
You've heard
there is a maenad in our midst.

214
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,750
I'm familiar.

215
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,919
Are you aware she's here
because of you?

216
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:41,171
Something like that.

217
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,639
I need you,

218
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:45,457
and Sookie needs you,

219
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:47,385
to make this right.

220
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,248
If I thought it was as easy
as giving myself up to Maryann,

221
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:51,973
I'd have done it by now.

222
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:55,203
And what's to say
she's gonna stop at me?

223
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:57,446
Killers don't just suddenly
quit killing.

224
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:00,398
You ought to know that.

225
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,026
And standing by idly
is not an option either.

226
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:06,798
You must come with me.

227
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,741
No, I'm not sure
I wanna be doing that.

228
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:13,416
I'm not sure
I'm giving you a choice.

229
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:21,213
Okay, what is with this egg?

230
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,337
Did you lay it?

231
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:24,238
No, silly,

232
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,132
it's an ostrich egg.

233
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,592
It represents fertility.

234
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,386
Anoint it with his blood.

235
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:33,431
You're the maid of honor.
You have to lick the egg.

236
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:36,651
Just lick it, already!

237
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:48,446
Only through the blood will he come.

238
00:15:57,904 --> 00:16:00,292
Shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

239
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,142
Your vessel has arrived.

240
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:14,241
You look...

241
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,420
beautiful.

242
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:17,765
Girls,

243
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,707
the time has come.

244
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:22,876
You too.

245
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,853
I will not be part
of anything so evil.

246
00:16:32,445 --> 00:16:34,075
You. You're the brother?

247
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:35,869
Maybe I could kill you.

248
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,098
Fine, I'll go.

249
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:39,914
But please, just don't hurt
anyone else.

250
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,583
Make sure she behaves.

251
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,190
Here we go.

252
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:48,798
- You're gonna break my arm!
- Don't make me, because I'll do it.

253
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,501
Maenad!

254
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:27,879
What the hell are you doing?

255
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,673
I have your sacrifice.

256
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:31,719
My sweet vessel.

257
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,829
I offer him in exchange for Sookie.

258
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:35,095
She'll kill him!

259
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,055
She's not gonna stop with me.

260
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:41,036
Take her to the dead man.
She's served her purpose.

261
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:43,561
Bill, you can't let her kill Sam!

262
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:46,003
Sorry. This is the only way.

263
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:47,936
Get your fucking hands off me!

264
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:50,568
Let go of me!

265
00:17:50,754 --> 00:17:52,254
Get her out of here.

266
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,322
I won't have her watch me die.

267
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,868
I will always be grateful to you.

268
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,495
This isn't for you.

269
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:04,708
Gentlemen, he's yours.

270
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,799
Get the hell off me.

271
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,326
This is what your vampire source
told you to do?

272
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:17,522
To give up Sam?

273
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,639
Sookie, you have to trust me.

274
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,442
Let us call forth our God.

275
00:18:29,547 --> 00:18:30,734
<i>The God with horns!</i>

276
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:33,820
Worship him, bitches!

277
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:38,535
Now the sacrificial egg.

278
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,229
He's coming, he's coming,

279
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,086
Hail Dionysus.

280
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:51,171
Bacchus.

281
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,089
Bromios.

282
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,592
Eleutherios.

283
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,303
Dendrites.

284
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:02,402
All these names of yours,
our bull-horned god.

285
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,058
Upon this occasion of our marriage,

286
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,147
our offering symbolizes
the rebirth of our god.

287
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:10,815
When he was a child,

288
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:14,491
the jealous Titans
ripped him to shreds,

289
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:16,788
eating all but his heart.

290
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:19,424
And this last piece

291
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:22,406
was saved by his sister,
Pallas Athena,

292
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:25,626
who placed it into the womb
of his mother

293
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:27,373
so that he could be reborn.

294
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:33,705
Oh, great mother,

295
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:36,508
soon you shall have the heart
that will make your egg

296
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,826
grow fertile,

297
00:19:38,536 --> 00:19:39,686
and your son,

298
00:19:40,391 --> 00:19:41,596
our bull-horned god,

299
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:43,915
will come and stand in your place.

300
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:06,859
At last.

301
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:10,676
At long, long last.

302
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,504
He is yours, my Lord.

303
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,302
You're lucky, Sam.

304
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:24,389
It's everyone's wish
to have their life mean something.

305
00:20:24,838 --> 00:20:25,682
So few

306
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,350
ever get to realize that.

307
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,269
- Come on, do it already.
- Do it.

308
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:31,437
Sacrifice him!

309
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:33,645
Sam, use your gift.

310
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:36,568
Use yours.

311
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:55,378
Bring me the blood.

312
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:19,239
He is the vessel.

313
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:23,323
My Lord, this is the vessel
who shall unite us.

314
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:34,812
I'm sorry.

315
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:37,307
I'm so, so sorry.

316
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,506
<i>Destroy it.</i>

317
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:43,430
<i>All of it.</i>

318
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:52,602
The egg!
You killed our sacred egg!

319
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,229
It's not sacred.
None of it's sacred.

320
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,541
It's evil.

321
00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:12,678
How dare you spoil my offering?

322
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:17,653
Lord Dionysus, forgive me!

323
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,863
Allow me to sacrifice

324
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,931
all of them for you.

325
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,979
Stop it!

326
00:22:38,782 --> 00:22:39,941
You're hurting them!

327
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:44,491
<i>You brought this upon everyone.</i>

328
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:30,467
My Lord?

329
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,545
My husband.

330
00:23:37,597 --> 00:23:38,499
You've come.

331
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,043
I am here, my love.

332
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:55,318
We're together at last.

333
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:57,839
Come to me.

334
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:12,742
My God.

335
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,702
I am the one to be sacrificed.

336
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,339
I am the vessel.

337
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:21,542
I'm happy to die.

338
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,673
I'm yours.

339
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,680
Was there no God?

340
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,090
He killed you.

341
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:13,054
Almost.

342
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:26,399
- Is she gone?
- I think so.

343
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:27,859
Is Sam all right?

344
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:30,505
He had to drink more of me
than I expected.

345
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,487
He's okay.

346
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:34,152
I promised Sam
that I would heal him.

347
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:39,931
We knew no other way
of destroying her.

348
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:42,915
I understand.

349
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:45,295
I'm sorry if I worried you.

350
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,598
I so badly wished
that you could hear my thoughts.

351
00:25:50,088 --> 00:25:52,383
Sam, you were willing to die for us.

352
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,719
Bill kind of promised
he wouldn't let that happen.

353
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:58,032
But if things didn't work out,
I guess I...

354
00:25:58,304 --> 00:25:59,404
I was ready.

355
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:05,965
Holy fuck.

356
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,961
We got her?

357
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:21,796
You remember anything?
No.

358
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,900
It was bad, wasn't it?

359
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,710
Bill, get rid of her body.
Bury it. I don't care where.

360
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:31,923
Help everyone get home.

361
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:35,074
- Ain't you gonna tell what happened?
- Not now.

362
00:26:35,373 --> 00:26:37,428
Just get everyone off my lawn.

363
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:46,697
It's all over now.

364
00:26:47,651 --> 00:26:50,611
Sookie, why do I have this
sick feeling that it's not?

365
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:54,737
Mama, you're okay.

366
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,447
You're okay, Mama. Mama.

367
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:01,744
- Thank you, God. Thank you.
- Well, how'd we get home?

368
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:05,442
- What, you don't remember anything?
- The last thing I remember is meeting

369
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:07,833
that red-headed vampire of yours,

370
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:08,985
and then I...

371
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,470
She didn't bite me, did she?

372
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:23,037
You let a vampire feed on me?

373
00:27:23,426 --> 00:27:26,269
Why on Earth would you choose
that girl over your own mother?

374
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:27,437
I didn't.

375
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,022
I brought you straight back here
right after she...

376
00:27:30,544 --> 00:27:33,109
did that, and then I...
I haven't spoken to her since.

377
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,819
What sort of evil monster

378
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,613
would attack an innocent person
for no reason?

379
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:40,668
Look, she was kind of...

380
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,187
provoked.

381
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:44,737
It wasn't you.

382
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:47,358
Whatever it was
that had control of you

383
00:27:47,483 --> 00:27:49,583
made you say a bunch
of things you didn't mean.

384
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,295
Like what?

385
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,648
Spiteful stuff.

386
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:54,973
About Jessica.

387
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,032
About me.

388
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,343
And Daddy.

389
00:28:00,034 --> 00:28:02,134
Lies, about how he shot himself.

390
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:14,135
That's not true, right?

391
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:18,237
It was a burglar.

392
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:26,746
You're nearly 30.

393
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,372
You should know the truth.

394
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:35,254
I should have known the truth
when I was 10!

395
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:38,444
Or, hell, when I was 25.

396
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,885
All these years you keep me here,

397
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,007
you keep me from moving out,
from going to college...

398
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:45,883
from doing anything

399
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:49,060
all because you were scared
of some burglar that never existed.

400
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:50,853
I was scared.

401
00:28:51,775 --> 00:28:53,272
I'm still scared.

402
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,250
You're all I got left.

403
00:28:57,992 --> 00:28:59,692
I had to hang on to you.

404
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,924
You lied to me

405
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:04,672
for 18 years

406
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:08,328
just because you didn't want
to be alone,

407
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:10,998
instead of letting me
be an actual person.

408
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,470
You know what I wish?

409
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:20,174
I wish that Jessica
had finished you off.

410
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,568
I'm sure you're...
You're just asleep.

411
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,481
God, I pray you're asleep.

412
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:42,974
Mama's gonna be home
real soon, okay?

413
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:44,149
I love you.

414
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,535
That's the third call.
Why aren't they picking up?

415
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,597
Yeah, come on.

416
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:50,889
Let's walk.

417
00:29:52,496 --> 00:29:53,851
I can give you a lift.

418
00:29:53,976 --> 00:29:57,846
- My truck's just down the road.
- Could you? God bless you.

419
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:05,453
What is it?

420
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:08,907
I think...

421
00:30:09,192 --> 00:30:10,957
I think I found my finger.

422
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:14,100
Holy Moses.
How the hell did you...?

423
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:17,449
It's okay.

424
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,963
Arlene, you mind
if Jane comes with us?

425
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:23,914
We need to get her to the ER.

426
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,156
Of course.

427
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,867
How the fuck did I get here?

428
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,786
Come on by the station
in the morning.

429
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,655
I'll give you your badge back.

430
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,780
Really?

431
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,959
I won't let you down, Bud.

432
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,595
And I'm never touching
another drink again.

433
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,513
This town's a hell of a mess,

434
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:42,590
and I'm man enough to know
I can't shoulder it myself.

435
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:45,198
You might have your faults, Andy,

436
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,488
but at least you got pants on.

437
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,814
I wanted to thank you
for trusting me with your life.

438
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:11,202
That couldn't have been easy.

439
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,079
Sookie's safe.
You got what you wanted.

440
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,664
You wanted it too.

441
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,545
Well, she's family.

442
00:31:21,564 --> 00:31:23,005
But they all are.

443
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,884
If there was a way to save 'em,
how could I say no?

444
00:31:27,493 --> 00:31:29,864
I am grateful
that you would reveal your gift

445
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:32,015
for the sake of the town.

446
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,884
It took me this long to realize it,

447
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:37,770
but you suffer more hiding something
than you do if you face up to it.

448
00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:01,302
Where's Maryann?

449
00:32:01,427 --> 00:32:02,930
She's gotta know what happened.

450
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:03,921
We're okay.

451
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,789
That's all that matters.

452
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:08,299
Blood on my hands is not okay, Tara.

453
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:12,221
Sookie helped me remember
some of the things I lost.

454
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:16,183
And I wish I could forget it again.
There's things you don't want to know.

455
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,646
How do you know I don't want?

456
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:22,642
All that stuff's in the past.

457
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:24,900
Why dwell on it?
Can't we just start fresh?

458
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:29,488
Fuck, there's blood
under my fingernails.

459
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:34,385
Finally got everyone home.

460
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,400
Did Bill come in?

461
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:39,082
I think he went upstairs.

462
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:43,502
Is he okay?

463
00:32:46,054 --> 00:32:47,204
Are you okay?

464
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:48,757
Yeah, I just...

465
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,179
I'm so sorry for bringing
all this craziness into your house.

466
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:56,617
I got sucked in

467
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:59,393
'cause she made me feel
like I was a part of... Like...

468
00:33:00,713 --> 00:33:02,479
a family or something.

469
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:05,662
You have a family.

470
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:08,881
We're family.

471
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,794
And tomorrow, we're gonna clean

472
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:14,718
every single thing

473
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:17,093
that monster touched in this house.

474
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:19,797
My God, is...?

475
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:21,995
Is Mike Spencer still here?

476
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:25,051
I kinda knocked him out.

477
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:26,788
I'll wake him up.

478
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:28,005
You go to bed.

479
00:33:28,544 --> 00:33:29,544
Thank you.

480
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:50,577
How long before sunrise?

481
00:33:52,721 --> 00:33:54,031
Forty-one minutes.

482
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,210
Hold me for 40.

483
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,684
I certainly never expected

484
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,799
anything like that to happen here.

485
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:24,013
I know.

486
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,317
Thanks for opening today.

487
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,227
I know you didn't have to,

488
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:32,830
but everyone's grateful
for a little something familiar.

489
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:35,455
It's not just my bar.
It's everybody's.

490
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:37,641
But it's called Merlotte's.

491
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,669
Merlotte is just a name.

492
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,845
Doesn't really say anything
about me, does it?

493
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,290
Mama, we forgive you.
Oh.

494
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:49,061
You shouldn't even have to know
what that word means.

495
00:34:49,772 --> 00:34:51,236
Mama, it's okay.

496
00:34:51,774 --> 00:34:53,651
Mr. Merlotte kept us company.

497
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:55,592
He took us to see some vampires,

498
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:57,177
and one of them can fly.

499
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,017
Well, Mr. Merlotte's a good man,

500
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:03,817
but he ain't your family.

501
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:06,028
I'm the one that should have
been there.

502
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:08,752
I'm so sorry about that, okay?

503
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:11,890
But I promise you that from now on,

504
00:35:12,273 --> 00:35:14,987
I'm gonna be the best mama
in the world, okay?

505
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,238
Stick 'em up.

506
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:21,202
Tell you what,

507
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,370
you kids keep an eye on your mama

508
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,682
when she's at home,

509
00:35:24,807 --> 00:35:27,166
and I'll make sure nothin' bad
happens to her when she's here.

510
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:30,156
That way, we can all
take care of each other, okay?

511
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:31,534
Sure, I guess.

512
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:34,006
Sounds like a plan to me.

513
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:37,675
We're drowning back here.
Come on.

514
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,220
You can skip to the ice cream
if you want.

515
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:46,837
When you went away
for all that time,

516
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:48,979
you didn't go see Rene, did you?

517
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:53,100
I think he's still on his vacation.

518
00:35:53,706 --> 00:35:54,706
Eat, eat.

519
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,332
Yep, I'm pretty sure he's dead.

520
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,325
Gas leak, my ass.

521
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:04,093
You know the real reason
no one remembers anything?

522
00:36:04,218 --> 00:36:05,871
It's the way the aliens wanted it.

523
00:36:06,278 --> 00:36:07,122
The what?

524
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:08,873
"Maryann Forrester"

525
00:36:08,998 --> 00:36:11,126
rhymes with "Martian Foreigner."

526
00:36:13,242 --> 00:36:15,005
She's a fugitive
from her home planet.

527
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:18,018
Everyone knows that, uh, aliens
erase people's memories.

528
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,176
It just adds up.

529
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:21,271
I heard that Maryann Forrester

530
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,574
was an agent
of the pharmaceutical companies

531
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:25,258
and the liberal media,

532
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,936
and she poisoned our water supply
with LSD as a mind-control experiment.

533
00:36:29,571 --> 00:36:32,733
- Like they did to San Francisco?
- That's why I stick to Mountain Dew.

534
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:36,401
- Refill?
- Please.

535
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:39,530
You know, between us,
the real story?

536
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,115
ATF shut down a distillery
in Breaux Bridge last week

537
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,971
over a bad batch of vodka.

538
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:45,248
Pure ethanol.

539
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:48,539
Apparently that's what they were
serving up last night.

540
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,543
Mountain Dew. Smart choice.

541
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,879
I knew it.

542
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,052
God bless who made those jeans.

543
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:00,968
I'm serious,
I'll wear him like a scrunchie.

544
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:04,364
Hit me.

545
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,350
Everybody been acting so crazy,
I forgot how stupid they were.

546
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,412
There it is.

547
00:37:19,878 --> 00:37:21,363
I feel for you the most.

548
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,491
- What? Why?
- 'Cause you know what really happened,

549
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:27,254
and you got to carry
the burden of that.

550
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,306
I mean, I'm thrilled I got a choice,

551
00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:30,998
and I don't ever wanna know.

552
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,702
Don't tell me nothing,

553
00:37:33,827 --> 00:37:35,352
even if I beg for it.

554
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:39,183
I don't think it's healthy
to know everything you've done.

555
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:41,673
Its like knowing what's sausage.
You should just eat it.

556
00:37:41,798 --> 00:37:43,298
You should enjoy it.

557
00:37:43,423 --> 00:37:46,972
Speaking of which, Jane Bodenhouse
wants a jambalaya.

558
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,661
I don't know.

559
00:37:50,786 --> 00:37:53,414
It was so traumatic
I must have blacked out,

560
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:55,866
but I'm thinking
a gator must have bit it off

561
00:37:55,991 --> 00:37:57,601
while I was down at the lake.

562
00:37:57,726 --> 00:37:59,776
I've been doing
a lot of sunbathing lately.

563
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,922
But the doctor who sewed it back on

564
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:04,258
says I have wonderful
bone structure,

565
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,076
so hopefully it'll take.

566
00:38:06,255 --> 00:38:09,322
Luckily, I use my right hand
for most things.

567
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:13,248
It wasn't no gator
and you weren't down by the lake.

568
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:18,754
I saw you pull that finger
out of a giant statue of meat.

569
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:22,049
Just like I saw you getting it
from behind from Mike Spencer.

570
00:38:28,295 --> 00:38:31,099
Whatever you're drinking,
we all want some of that.

571
00:38:32,361 --> 00:38:34,269
It's Diet Coke with lime.

572
00:38:38,133 --> 00:38:39,133
Great.

573
00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:41,245
Used to be they all thought
I was crazy.

574
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:44,331
Now they know I'm tellin' the truth,
and they can't face it.

575
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:47,407
- Zombie-eyed freaks.
- Hey, let it go, Bubba.

576
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:51,828
Look, you and me both know we
saved her and everybody else.

577
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,539
We're...

578
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,500
We're heroes to this town.

579
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:57,918
What?

580
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:00,671
They don't remember anything,
we don't remember anything.

581
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,048
- How does that make us heroes?
- We gotta be.

582
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:06,737
We set out to save this town
from Maryann.

583
00:39:06,862 --> 00:39:10,681
Now today, she's gone,
and everybody's okay.

584
00:39:11,344 --> 00:39:13,393
We must have done something right.

585
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,937
In my book, if no one thinks
we're heroes, it don't count.

586
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,930
Of course it counts.

587
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,963
It's like if a tree falls in the woods.
It's still a tree, ain't it?

588
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,455
The whole point in being a hero

589
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,927
is to do something greater
than yourself.

590
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:31,785
It'd be easy to do it
for the glory or the girls,

591
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:34,875
but we're bigger men than that,

592
00:39:35,432 --> 00:39:36,373
right?

593
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,379
Strange to see you working here.

594
00:39:45,504 --> 00:39:46,904
It's been a while.

595
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,760
It's like riding a bicycle.

596
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:53,473
You think
you can keep an eye on things here,

597
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,219
without me for a couple days?

598
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:56,601
Why, where you going?

599
00:39:57,473 --> 00:39:59,823
Well, I... I'm the only one
who hasn't had a break.

600
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,776
And in case you didn't notice,
yesterday was a little rough for me too.

601
00:40:05,198 --> 00:40:08,655
I don't have the words
to thank you for what you did.

602
00:40:09,828 --> 00:40:11,469
It's probably best you don't.

603
00:40:12,164 --> 00:40:14,614
I'm not sure we want people
knowing...

604
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,040
well, any of it.

605
00:40:18,378 --> 00:40:21,251
I for one wish everyone knew
how special you are.

606
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:32,682
I'm Autumn
from Maison Maribel in Ruston.

607
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:34,139
Special delivery for you.

608
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,434
Thank you.

609
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:39,811
Lucky girl.
You've got one classy admirer.

610
00:40:46,886 --> 00:40:48,153
Can I have a minute?

611
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,321
Sure.

612
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,720
{\I've owed you an evening out
for some time now.}

613
00:41:18,845 --> 00:41:21,144
{\I would very much like
for you to wear this Tonight. Bill.}

614
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:26,979
My God, you scared me half to death.

615
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,519
I'm sorry, Sookie. I just...

616
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,155
I gotta talk to you.
What is it?

617
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:35,040
You look like you
haven't slept all night.

618
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:44,718
There's gaps...

619
00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:47,045
where I can't remember anything.

620
00:41:48,156 --> 00:41:50,090
But I have to know
what I did, and...

621
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,843
Please.
I need your help.

622
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,228
I don't know.

623
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:56,346
It's not as easy as that.

624
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:59,474
I had blood on my hands last night,
and I can't remember why.

625
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:03,728
Now, I know I did terrible things
in my past, but I paid for 'em.

626
00:42:04,877 --> 00:42:06,940
I thought that was all over.
But if it's not...

627
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,325
I got a right to know.

628
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,604
Are you sure?

629
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,839
'Cause Maryann made a lot of people
do a lot of things

630
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:15,963
- they wouldn't ordinarily do.
- Like...? Like what? What things?

631
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:20,177
I can't live with myself
not knowing what I did.

632
00:42:20,784 --> 00:42:23,248
<i>I don't know what I am.</i>

633
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,252
<i>You can help me, I know you can.</i>

634
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:28,004
<i>I know it. Please help me.
Please help me.</i>

635
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,940
I can't promise it'll work.

636
00:42:30,065 --> 00:42:31,840
I had Bill with me last time.

637
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:34,634
Tell me what to do.
I want you to find it.

638
00:42:35,296 --> 00:42:37,246
You have to open yourself up.

639
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:40,283
You have to let me in, okay?

640
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,669
Let's go back
to your first blackout.

641
00:42:46,794 --> 00:42:47,981
Do you remember that?

642
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:53,904
Take me back there.

643
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,448
What's the last thing you remember?

644
00:42:57,264 --> 00:42:59,284
<i>I'm with Maryann in her car.</i>

645
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,036
She's taking me somewhere.

646
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:04,581
<i>Then it's just blank.</i>

647
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:05,883
Concentrate.

648
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:07,417
- Let me in.
- I'm trying.

649
00:43:10,472 --> 00:43:12,505
<i>You're in the woods.
There's a woman there</i>

650
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,090
<i>with a... With a cane?</i>

651
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,383
I see her.

652
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:19,221
<i>You're a vessel to the Other World.
You will bring forth my God.</i>

653
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:21,389
I ain't no vessel.
I don't know what I'm doing.

654
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:38,831
It wasn't you.
You had no free will.

655
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,493
I killed people.
I cut out their hearts.

656
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,011
No, listen to me.

657
00:43:43,136 --> 00:43:44,181
That wasn't you.

658
00:43:44,306 --> 00:43:45,914
Maryann used you.

659
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,625
But it was my hands.
My hands that did all that.

660
00:43:49,207 --> 00:43:50,207
Please...

661
00:43:50,705 --> 00:43:52,221
don't blame yourself.

662
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,881
Eggs, I'm so sorry.

663
00:44:07,547 --> 00:44:08,979
You look quite a vision.

664
00:44:10,168 --> 00:44:12,468
Are you off to see Hoyt Fortenberry?

665
00:44:13,335 --> 00:44:16,580
So what if I am?
You're going to see Sookie, aren't you?

666
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:17,705
It's fine.

667
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,492
In my day, the gentleman
came to the lady's house to court her,

668
00:44:23,479 --> 00:44:24,829
but times change.

669
00:44:26,615 --> 00:44:28,315
I see his mother's gone.

670
00:44:29,512 --> 00:44:31,418
He took her home yesterday.

671
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:32,636
Good.

672
00:44:33,188 --> 00:44:34,681
I hope she's better.

673
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:37,257
And I hope you and Hoyt
have a nice time.

674
00:44:37,671 --> 00:44:38,633
Thanks.

675
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:39,968
Actually,

676
00:44:40,526 --> 00:44:42,426
we kinda had a little fight,

677
00:44:43,593 --> 00:44:45,890
but I was just gonna go over
and make an apology.

678
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:49,752
Well, he'd be a fool not to accept.

679
00:44:51,477 --> 00:44:54,357
- Where are you going with Sookie?
- To a French restaurant.

680
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:57,843
Do you know I haven't
been to one in over 70 years?

681
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:00,864
Humans seem to love them.

682
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,127
They go there to celebrate.

683
00:45:05,261 --> 00:45:07,133
Just be back by 5.

684
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:08,913
You be back by 4.

685
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,305
Mrs. Merlotte.

686
00:45:26,908 --> 00:45:28,058
Oh, dear God.

687
00:45:38,586 --> 00:45:41,112
You... threw away
all the pictures of me?

688
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:44,033
We have 'em. It's just...

689
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,369
It'd be hard to explain to friends

690
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,119
who think we never had children.

691
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:52,789
Will you sit down?
No, I don't plan on staying.

692
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,460
We never thought we'd see you again.

693
00:45:55,704 --> 00:45:57,921
Never say never
when there's the Internet.

694
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,187
If you came for an explanation,

695
00:46:05,174 --> 00:46:06,850
I don't have a good one.

696
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,100
Mitchell and I were down
to our last nickel,

697
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:11,718
and we were scared.

698
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,562
We still don't know
what we saw that night.

699
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,591
You saw me turn into a dog.

700
00:46:19,788 --> 00:46:22,722
And apparently that was worth
abandoning me over.

701
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:24,747
So I spent the next 19 years

702
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:28,604
making sure nobody
would know who I really was.

703
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:31,510
That's what you left me with.

704
00:46:32,757 --> 00:46:33,757
I'm sorry.

705
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:35,992
I am so sorry, Sam.

706
00:46:37,312 --> 00:46:39,712
We never meant to hurt you.
Hey, hey.

707
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:42,498
I'm not here for an apology.

708
00:46:44,736 --> 00:46:46,719
I wanna find the people
you adopted me from.

709
00:46:48,342 --> 00:46:49,639
I wanna meet my parents.

710
00:46:51,286 --> 00:46:52,401
I can't do that.

711
00:46:52,526 --> 00:46:54,337
I swore to them
I'd never say anything.

712
00:46:54,462 --> 00:46:55,538
Jesus Christ.

713
00:46:55,663 --> 00:46:57,230
Please. Trust me.

714
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:59,075
You don't wanna know them.

715
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,442
They're bad people.

716
00:47:01,157 --> 00:47:03,319
I guess you know a thing or two
about that.

717
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:40,044
{\Melinda + Joe Ler Mickens
last known is Magnolia Art.}

718
00:47:40,169 --> 00:47:41,774


719
00:48:16,878 --> 00:48:20,271
No, before we go any further,
there's something you ought to know.

720
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,606
What's that, sugar?

721
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:23,789
That I'm...

722
00:48:24,647 --> 00:48:25,789
I'm a virgin.

723
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,113
That's okay.

724
00:48:30,709 --> 00:48:32,283
I'll be gentle with you.

725
00:48:33,387 --> 00:48:35,370
- In fact, I kinda like it.
- Really?

726
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,019
Well, I don't like it one bit.

727
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:03,798
Welcome, Mr. Compton.
We are all ready for you.

728
00:49:03,923 --> 00:49:06,073
- Thank you.
- I'll get the music started.

729
00:49:10,144 --> 00:49:12,865
You rented out the whole place?

730
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:16,685
The sight of you is not something
I wish to share with others tonight.

731
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:21,666
You didn't have
to do all this for me.

732
00:49:22,101 --> 00:49:24,751
I love nothing more
than to see you happy.

733
00:49:26,814 --> 00:49:28,682
It's really quite selfish.

734
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,594
Well, I know I'm gonna eat,

735
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:35,281
but what's there for you to do
at a restaurant besides look at me?

736
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:36,565
We can dance.

737
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:38,349
May I?

738
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:22,902
Hold up. Hold up!

739
00:50:24,503 --> 00:50:26,053
Listen, I'm a killer.

740
00:50:26,553 --> 00:50:28,764
I'm a murderer.
I murdered innocent people.

741
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,235
Now, you have to lock me up, please.

742
00:50:31,948 --> 00:50:34,072
All right, man, why don't you
put the knife down.

743
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,864
- We'll talk?
- It's the murder weapon, you dumb fuck!

744
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,036
The voodoo woman, Daphne,
Sam Merlotte.

745
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:42,080
- I used it on all of them.
- Hold on.

746
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:43,956
You were under Maryann's spell.

747
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,417
But it was me who cut out
those women's hearts.

748
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:49,262
Calm down. Calm down.

749
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:52,590
- Give me that knife...
- You call this a knife?

750
00:50:53,813 --> 00:50:54,967
I saw their eyes.

751
00:50:55,912 --> 00:50:57,113
Looking up at me,

752
00:50:57,238 --> 00:50:58,888
holding this knife out.

753
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,225
That was the last thing
they saw, Andy.

754
00:51:06,698 --> 00:51:07,948
He was gonna...

755
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:14,204
Holy shit.

756
00:51:15,296 --> 00:51:17,031
I ain't never killed nobody before.

757
00:51:17,939 --> 00:51:20,368
Fuck, this ain't even mine.
Give it to me.

758
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:23,788
Give me the gun.

759
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,418
You didn't see anything.

760
00:51:28,844 --> 00:51:31,559
You weren't here.
Get the hell out of here. Go on.

761
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,939
Go!

762
00:51:41,384 --> 00:51:43,265
Somebody call an ambulance.

763
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:44,652
What happened?

764
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,603
We got a confession from our killer
and a murder weapon.

765
00:51:48,465 --> 00:51:50,523
- He was coming after me, and, uh...
- Oh, God.

766
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:52,976
I got him.

767
00:51:54,669 --> 00:51:56,219
Tara, honey, don't...

768
00:52:02,804 --> 00:52:04,334
No, please.

769
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,208
Please.

770
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:17,675
It's a good thing you don't eat.

771
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,844
'Cause I wouldn't have
shared it with anyone.

772
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:23,806
I can't think of a better way to top off
the best meal of my life.

773
00:52:24,946 --> 00:52:26,726
I do have one last thing.

774
00:52:31,883 --> 00:52:33,083
Plane tickets?

775
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:36,944
Where's Burlington?

776
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:38,421
It's in Vermont.

777
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,378
Vermont?
Why would we...?

778
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,408
This is the other part.

779
00:52:57,625 --> 00:52:58,925
Miss Stackhouse,

780
00:53:01,238 --> 00:53:04,038
will you do me
the honor of becoming my wife?

781
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,194
That is, assuming that last night

782
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,062
didn't scare you off weddings
for good.

783
00:53:17,745 --> 00:53:18,945
Say something.

784
00:53:20,256 --> 00:53:23,216
I've dreamed of this
since I was a girl.

785
00:53:26,187 --> 00:53:27,537
And in my dreams,

786
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:29,914
I always say yes.

787
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:32,083
Then it ought to be easy.

788
00:53:32,326 --> 00:53:33,876
Then why can't I say it?

789
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,360
My heart's flying around
in my chest.

790
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:39,749
I can't even think straight.

791
00:53:41,235 --> 00:53:42,859
My life's inside-out.

792
00:53:43,271 --> 00:53:45,021
With all that's happened,

793
00:53:45,946 --> 00:53:47,784
I'm not sure about anything.

794
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:49,475
I don't even know if I'm human.

795
00:53:50,778 --> 00:53:52,975
- What?
- Maybe I am some kind of freak.

796
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,375
I've only met one other person
in the world like me,

797
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,066
and who even knows where he is?

798
00:53:58,456 --> 00:53:59,756
And what happens

799
00:53:59,915 --> 00:54:02,065
when I grow old and weak

800
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,750
and you're still the same?

801
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:04,699
What then?

802
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:06,993
I don't care about any of that.

803
00:54:07,467 --> 00:54:09,197
I want you just as you are.

804
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,706
But I'm not even sure what I am.

805
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,287
Are you saying no?

806
00:54:17,412 --> 00:54:18,766
I'm saying...

807
00:54:19,818 --> 00:54:21,621
I don't know what I'm saying.

808
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:26,123
I need a minute to clean myself up.
I'm sorry.

809
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,527
Yes, Bill Compton, I will marry you.
