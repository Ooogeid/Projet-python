1
00:00:06,618 --> 00:00:08,274
Would you leave her alone?

2
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,596
It's your own fault.

3
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:13,054
You and your insane affection
for stupid cattle.

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,068
- Just go away.
- I wouldn't have to be here

5
00:00:15,193 --> 00:00:17,064
if the Magister could trust you.

6
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:19,617
I fulfilled the conditions
of my sentence.

7
00:00:20,497 --> 00:00:22,317
I murdered this innocent girl.

8
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:26,399
There was no murder. You drained
her blood and gave her yours.

9
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,149
I've proven my loyalty.

10
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:31,043
Yes, but you're romantic.
You're sentimental.

11
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:35,432
You just might do something to keep the
little blood bag from joining our ranks.

12
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:37,658
I'll follow my orders.

13
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:40,623
I won't let you stake her
before she goes to ground.

14
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:44,804
I'm not gonna stake her.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,959
I'm gonna set her free.

16
00:00:47,084 --> 00:00:48,858
You've already set her free.

17
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,592
The same as Eric freed me.

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,508
Everyone she's ever known
will recoil from her.

19
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,598
Everything she's ever loved
has been stolen from her.

20
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,986
Oh, please, there's no comparison.

21
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:02,890
You've given that pathetic lump
of temporary flesh...

22
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:05,257
- Jessica.
- ... the ultimate gift.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,666
You're a maker.

24
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:08,943
You're a hero.

25
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:12,655
I find myself doubting whether
you were ever truly human.

26
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:14,824
Thank you.

27
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:17,868
Damn you.

28
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:22,039
Once she's planted in the earth,
the transformation will begin.

29
00:01:22,323 --> 00:01:23,332
I know.

30
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:25,205
I'll tuck you in.

31
00:01:26,737 --> 00:01:28,017
Tomorrow night,

32
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:32,425
your little girl will rise vampire.

<i>This is Tara, leave a message.</i>

38
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:15,208
<i>Easy stuff.</i>

39
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,454
Tara, where're you at?

40
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:20,910
At least let me know you're not drunk
in a ditch somewhere.

41
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:24,411
I'm sorry, I take it back.
Just call, okay?

42
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,027
Put those clothes in the wash.

43
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:35,021
Felt like the killer was...
all over me,

44
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:38,236
watching me, hating me,
itching for a...

45
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:41,095
A knife or a rope or...

46
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:42,936
my neck.

47
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,346
You didn't get any sense
of who it was?

48
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,040
Just pictures.

49
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:50,169
His thoughts were

50
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:51,842
all red and black and...

51
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:53,753
snarly.

52
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,158
- But there was something familiar.
- Like somebody from Bon Temps?

53
00:03:58,642 --> 00:04:00,239
Or somebody from the bar?

54
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:03,182
No one I could recognize for sure.

55
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:08,280
- I think we should call the police.
- And what would I say?

56
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:11,393
"Sheriff Dearborne, Andy Bellefleur,
I saw a woman die,

57
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,151
"I just happened to be
in somebody else's brain at the time"?

58
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:17,010
Did you get a good look at her?
I mean, what was she like?

59
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:18,482
Young,

60
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:20,366
pretty, with...

61
00:04:20,811 --> 00:04:22,009
with an apron.

62
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:23,275
Apron?

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,014
- You mean, like a mom?
- More like a waitress.

64
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:28,649
Was there a...

65
00:04:29,198 --> 00:04:30,223
name tag?

66
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:32,557
Maybe.

67
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:36,348
What'd it say?

68
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,537
I don't know.

69
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:45,645
I was looking at her eyes.

70
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:48,557
She was so surprised.

71
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:55,663
Well, do you want to call Bill?
I mean,

72
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:58,254
- it might make you feel better.
- No.

73
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,221
He would found how scared I was.
He would've known I was in danger.

74
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:06,372
If he didn't show up tonight,

75
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:09,282
he's not coming back.

76
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,358
You hear from Tara?

77
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:21,955
Nope.

78
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:29,976
Well...

79
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,718
Good night.

80
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,079
Good night.

81
00:05:59,977 --> 00:06:00,977
A woman?

82
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:02,525
At 2 in the morning?

83
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,805
Standing there naked,
fucking with my head.

84
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,141
- And she was with a pig?
- A big pig.

85
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,661
Like a, you know... Like a crazy-ass
motherfucking Paul Bunyan pig.

86
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,329
- Tara, tell the truth.
- That is the truth.

87
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,319
Kenya, I am an excellent driver
but you cannot prepare

88
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:18,908
for a naked lady and a hog
in the middle of the road.

89
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:22,005
- Now, you know that.
- I know you drunk, that's what I know.

90
00:06:22,628 --> 00:06:25,176
Drunk? I'm not drunk. One beer.

91
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:28,383
Come from Arlene's party,
didn't you, with an open bottle?

92
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:29,443
What bottle?

93
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:31,890
- The one busted in your car.
- That's not my bottle.

94
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:33,975
Then you wouldn't mind
a sobriety test.

95
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,476
Hell, no. Bring it.

96
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:38,026
Step away from the vehicle.

97
00:06:38,383 --> 00:06:39,961
Stand with your feet together.

98
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:44,019
Stand with one foot in front holding
the other one 6 inches off the ground,

99
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:45,654
parallel to the ground.

100
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:49,906
- Let's try that again.
- What is the matter with you?

101
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:52,285
- You're turning into Lettie Mae.
- Fuck you.

102
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:56,456
I am a sheriff's deputy, now, Tara
Thornton. Don't you go there with me.

103
00:06:58,048 --> 00:06:58,987
Kenya,

104
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:00,257
sister,

105
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,670
the only place I want to go is home.

106
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:06,800
Sorry. Not tonight.

107
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:09,814
It's not fair,

108
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:12,262
- it's not my fault.
- I will cuff you.

109
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:14,702
But the lady and the pig,
that was real.

110
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:17,942
Just watch your intoxicated head,
please.

111
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,354
Jesus fucking Christ.

112
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:24,209
Shit, fuck, Amy, what did you do?

113
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:27,443
I did what we had to do, now, come on.
Come on, wipe up. Here's the towel.

114
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:29,318
There's more rags. Come on.

115
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:33,117
Who the fuck are you?

116
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:38,481
How can you say that to me?
You know who I am.

117
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:41,639
- You know better than anybody.
- I thought I knew.

118
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:43,173
I told you to let him go.

119
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:45,645
I told you not to talk to him.
He was controlling your mind.

120
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,277
- Bullshit.
- That's what they do.

121
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:49,792
Not Eddie.
He didn't know how to do that yet.

122
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,063
He trusted me.

123
00:07:51,683 --> 00:07:54,639
- It was gonna be all right.
- God, it was never gonna be all right.

124
00:07:55,194 --> 00:07:57,650
From the minute we took him,
you knew it was gonna end like this,

125
00:07:57,775 --> 00:08:00,341
- you just couldn't face it.
- I didn't think you{\ fuckin'} end like this.

126
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:01,934
You wanted his blood.

127
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:02,986
Bad.

128
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,485
You were with me the whole way,
so do not act like this is my fault.

129
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,920
Now, I said to clean up,
so clean up.

130
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,461
- Yankee bitch.
- Dumb fucking hillbilly.

131
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:43,939
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.
We just gotta keep our shit together.

132
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:49,543
We killed a man.

133
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:55,306
For the last time,
he was already dead.

134
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,835
He was not a man.
He was a predator,

135
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,706
only we got him first.

136
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:06,169
So don't do this, okay?
Don't let a vampire come between us.

137
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:09,214
No, I guess not.

138
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:11,611
Because what we have,

139
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:17,216
it's beautiful.

140
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:36,466
Morning.

141
00:09:38,388 --> 00:09:41,037
- I didn't know you were up.
- Eggs and sausage warm in the oven.

142
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,353
Oh, thanks.

143
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:46,311
You already eat?

144
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:47,823
Too busy.

145
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:49,247
Tara call?

146
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,272
Not yet.

147
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:55,667
- Probably still sleeping it off.
- I'll tell you what,

148
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:58,888
I am sick and tired
of waiting around to get strangled.

149
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:01,166
That's not gonna happen
while I'm here.

150
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,433
You can't spend 24 hours a day
with me for the rest of my life.

151
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:06,532
Sure, I can.

152
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,240
I want to find that guy
before he finds me.

153
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:13,002
- Again.
- So you're looking up

154
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:14,983
killers in the Yellow Pages?

155
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:16,927
I'm...

156
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:18,655
I remembered.

157
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:20,592
In my sleep,

158
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:21,952
I remembered.

159
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:23,896
What?

160
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:26,593
The girl I saw.

161
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:29,092
Her clothes, the apron,
it was a uniform.

162
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:32,328
She was a waitress and there was a tag.
Her name was Cindy.

163
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:35,531
And the restaurant name
was something about pies.

164
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:36,992
Party Pies or...

165
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,720
Patty Pies.

166
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:43,891
- Wait, you mean Big Patty's Pie House?
- Yes.

167
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,940
Yeah, I know Big Patty's.
It's off...

168
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:48,312
Off I-49, way south, near Bunkie.

169
00:10:50,428 --> 00:10:52,609
You don't have to come with me.

170
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:55,054
Yeah, I do.

171
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,614
Come on. Eat up, you need fuel.

172
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,910
- I'm not hungry.
- Don't sass me.

173
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,550
You're not the boss of me.

174
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:05,078
Right. You are.

175
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:13,154
Hey, you.

176
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:14,739
Going to work?

177
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:20,136
Yeah, me too in a second.

178
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:23,684
Look, I wanted to say
I'm really sorry...

179
00:11:26,995 --> 00:11:29,166
We are done with this shit,
do you hear me?

180
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:30,145
Done.

181
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:33,377
I want every fucking drop out
of my house and if you don't like it,

182
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:35,769
you can pack
your goddamn bags and go.

183
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:48,182
Love you.

184
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,667
<i>We caught up with David Finch</i>

185
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,170
<i>speaking to the Marthaville Order
of Visionary Southern Gentlemen today</i>

186
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,966
<i>as he embarks on his campaign
for the U.S. House of Representatives.</i>

187
00:11:58,283 --> 00:12:01,118
- <i>The MOVSG has announced...</i>
- On his what?

188
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:02,979
Don't tell me that.

189
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,181
<i>Equal rights for vampires?
I don't think so.</i>

190
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:09,840
- <i>Many of them are foreign immigrants,</i>
- What the fuck?

191
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:11,950
<i>taking our jobs and our women.</i>

192
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:14,864
<i>And their very blood</i>

00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:17,234
<i>turns our children into addicts,</i>

194
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,569
<i>drug dealers and homosexuals.</i>

195
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:20,780
<i>No vampire,</i>

196
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,492
<i>and none of these vampire-loving
deviants deserve any rights at all.</i>

197
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,952
You is a lying-ass motherfucker.

198
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,505
Two-faced ass son of a bitch.

199
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:33,316
- Did you hear what he just said?
- I can't listen to politicians no more,

200
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:35,628
- I get a seizure.
- <i>State Senator Finch</i>

201
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:39,204
<i>will be shaking hands tonight
at the Remington Hotel in Monroe.</i>

202
00:12:39,622 --> 00:12:40,757
That's good to know.

203
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,803
Can we put in on
my home decor program now, please?

204
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:45,722
<i>Senator Finch has increased
the intensity...</i>

205
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,890
<i>But look,</i>

206
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:48,792
<i>just by adding shelves...</i>

207
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,670
Oh, darling,

208
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:53,103
you looking a little used up.

209
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:55,523
Jason dragging you
into his bullshit?

210
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:59,060
I have no idea what you mean.

211
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:07,368
Why is everybody
tellin' me lies today?

212
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,954
I got no idea. Look at that, Lafayette.
Theme shelves.

213
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:13,207
Oh, that's pretty, baby.

214
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,714
Would you work for me tonight?

215
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,479
No, ma'am, no, sir,
I don't know any Cindy.

216
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:23,326
But I can recommend
the fried apple pie,

217
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:26,872
the frozen Hawaiian pie,
the chocolate pecan praline pie,

218
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:29,834
the chess pie,
the seven-layer Jell-O pie...

219
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,794
They'll have the peanut butter pie

220
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,811
and the Spunky Hollow
honey pineapple pie,

221
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:37,315
- please, Harley?
- Gotcha, Buster.

222
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,487
We will?

223
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,065
You won't get nothing from her.
She only been here... two weeks.

224
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,117
Come from three generations
as dumb as rocks.

225
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,418
Hell, they named her
after a motorcycle.

226
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:50,293
That's real interesting, but we...

227
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:52,663
If you want to know anything
about Cindy Marshall,

228
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:55,368
I'll talk to you.
And I'll eat that pie too.

229
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:56,969
Buster Boisseau.

230
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,557
Sookie Stackhouse, Sam Merlotte.

231
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:03,925
- Can you tell us...?
- First things first.

232
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:07,392
You knew Cindy?

233
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:09,505
Little bit.

234
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:11,074
Let's see,

235
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:13,340
I met her two years ago.

236
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:17,100
She moved into town with her brother
a couple months before...

237
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:20,441
Before what?

238
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:23,816
I hate to be the one to tell you,

239
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:26,383
but somebody murdered
that little gal.

240
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:28,698
Just choked the life
right out of her.

241
00:14:28,823 --> 00:14:31,486
Poor thing.
Did they find who did it?

242
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:33,102
Nope. It's a mystery.

243
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:35,238
Where's her brother?
Could we talk to him?

244
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:36,521
Don't know how.

245
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,617
He was gone by the time
they found her body.

246
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:41,999
The police thought
maybe he's dead too,

247
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,783
or maybe he killed her,

248
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:46,133
but there wasn't any evidence
one way or the other.

249
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:50,798
- What was his name?
- Let me think on that.

250
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,410
Nobody hardly knew him.

251
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:55,234
Let's see...

252
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:56,643
D-something.

253
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,030
Dave.

254
00:14:59,127 --> 00:15:01,179
Drew... No, Drew.
Drew Marshall.

255
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,837
What was Cindy like?

256
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:06,099
Cute as a button,

257
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:09,624
a little wild, fun-loving,
always nice to me.

258
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:12,354
But people talked,

259
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,640
you know.

260
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,208
Talked about what?

261
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:18,286
"Vampers."

262
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:22,485
They say she was carrying on
with the vampers. I didn't believe it.

263
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,968
What kind of woman
would do such a thing?

264
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:31,561
This is the Texas Special:
Sawdust Pie.

265
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:33,099
Nobody ordered that.

266
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:35,568
Well, it's not much.

267
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:37,355
We got a name.

268
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:39,738
Mama, please don't cry.

269
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,038
It was only a little accident

270
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:44,120
and I didn't get hurt much.

271
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:47,584
Well, no, I... I wasn't drunk,
but they think I was.

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,130
Mama, quit yelling, all I need
is bail money and a ride home...

273
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:54,961
There's no reason to cry.

274
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:58,718
What do you mean, "no"?

275
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:01,355
Y'all pussies?
Let's go pound some beers.

276
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,548
Can't. Mama's night-blind.

277
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:06,382
I gotta take her to a baby shower
in Shreveport.

278
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,697
Night-blind, my ass,

279
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:10,433
she's got those apron strings
wrapped around your throat, boy.

280
00:16:10,558 --> 00:16:11,672
Cut her loose.

281
00:16:11,797 --> 00:16:13,741
Come party with the men folk.

282
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:15,404
I wanna go, Jay.

283
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,547
What're you gonna do
at a baby shower?

284
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:20,992
The food's good, the games are fun.

285
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,946
You know, like Pass the Orange?

286
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:27,641
And, if the ladies start screaming
like they always do,

287
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:29,446
I'll just go for a little walk.

288
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,145
Well, that's just plain sad.

289
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,280
Just you and me, brother.

290
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,394
We'll play some pool,
I'll buy you a pool boy.

291
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,336
Sorry. Me and Arlene,
we got a date to dance.

292
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:44,614
- Well, I'll... I'll come with you.
- No, you won't.

293
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:46,906
It's a date, I said.
Me and my woman.

294
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:49,142
All right, fine.

295
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:50,978
Fuck it.

296
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:52,615
I'll party on my own.

297
00:16:52,954 --> 00:16:54,981
What do you want with us
when you got Amy?

298
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:56,949
God, she's good-looking.

299
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,779
I'm gonna tell you something,
but you can't say nothing to nobody.

300
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:06,397
You got that?

301
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:11,591
Amy likes V.

302
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:15,376
Vampire blood?
No, I don't believe that.

303
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,039
- It's not a joke?
- Nope.

304
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:20,603
Then you gotta help
her stop, that's it.

305
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:23,280
- Set her straight.
- I'm trying, you know?

306
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:25,243
But she's hooked or something.

307
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,438
There's only so much I can do.

308
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,476
She sleep with vampires too?

309
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:31,481
She says she never did,
but these days,

310
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:33,803
it's hard to find
a woman who ain't been bit.

311
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:36,996
Do you love her?

312
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:42,749
Yeah, but I don't like this V shit.

313
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:46,694
We had a terrible fight.

314
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:50,819
She might be gone already
and if she's not,

315
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:56,190
- maybe I ought to dump her.
- Oh, man, don't do that.

316
00:17:56,895 --> 00:17:58,576
She's the kind that you keep.

317
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:00,336
Look, you... You...

318
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:02,896
You ain't even tried
to work it out yet.

319
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:06,382
So tomorrow night, we'll go out,

320
00:18:06,507 --> 00:18:07,519
get drunk,

321
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:10,231
pass a good time,
we'll figure out what to do.

322
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:12,565
Yeah, makes sense.

323
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,318
- Thanks.
- Okay.

324
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:18,705
Hang in there, bro.

325
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,832
All right.

326
00:18:21,505 --> 00:18:24,480
Hey, these things... They got a way
of working out, you know?

327
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,053
I hope you're right.

328
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:27,926
All right, good night.

329
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:29,741
Good night.

330
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:39,353
- Hello?
- Hold your horses.

331
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:41,884
<i>Can't call it adultery</i>

332
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:43,853
<i>if a wife won't have sex.</i>

333
00:18:43,978 --> 00:18:45,928
<i>At least Debbie's a Christian.</i>

334
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:48,087
Give him a second.
He doesn't think so quick.

335
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:49,858
Hello?

336
00:18:51,592 --> 00:18:53,635
- Yeah?
- Hello, officer?

337
00:18:53,795 --> 00:18:55,762
Sir, I'm sorry to bother you.

338
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,702
No bother.
No bother at all, I was just...

339
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,187
Are those vampire bites?

340
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:09,692
With all due respect,
sir, that's none of your business.

341
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,269
Sir, we're looking for information...

342
00:19:13,394 --> 00:19:16,230
Yeah, well, that's what
the library's for.

343
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:23,414
It's about Cindy Marshall's murder.
What about it?

344
00:19:24,592 --> 00:19:27,507
There've been murders like hers
in Renard Parish.

345
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:30,630
Bon Temps, to be exact.
Hadn't you heard?

346
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,802
- Can't say.
- She had a brother...

347
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:34,170
Drew, I was told.

348
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:36,302
- Could be.
- Do you have a picture of him?

349
00:19:38,454 --> 00:19:39,467
What for?

350
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:41,734
We don't know he did it.

351
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:44,405
More likely a vampire.

352
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,517
I don't mean to tell you
your business,

353
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:49,869
but a vampire wouldn't kill
by strangulation.

354
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:51,858
Well, I guess you'd know.

355
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:55,738
Good riddance to white trash,
that's all I got to say.

356
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:58,940
- You're out of line.
- He can say whatever he wants.

357
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:00,915
Doesn't bother me a bit.

358
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:04,747
Just hand me a picture of Drew Marshall
and I'll go away quiet.

359
00:20:04,977 --> 00:20:07,178
Well, that file's in storage.

360
00:20:07,303 --> 00:20:09,877
Gonna take a while to get it.
Probably months.

361
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:12,995
Come on, Sookie,
he's not gonna do shit for us.

362
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,340
Oh, I think he will.

363
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,033
All right then,
we'll go to the library

364
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:18,620
and I'll get your home address.

365
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:20,972
Shouldn't be too hard
to track down your wife.

366
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:22,348
My wife?

367
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:25,050
So I can tell her
you're sleeping with Debbie.

368
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:27,311
- Yeah, Debbie.
- From church?

369
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:29,125
Who...? You... How did...?

370
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,733
And the Vampire League of America
will want to know about your attitude.

371
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:35,898
Now, now, hold on a minute, now.

372
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:37,683
Hold on, now. I...

373
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:41,617
I can't just give you the photo.

374
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,441
What I might could do

375
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:49,167
is, um, fax it on down
to the sheriff in Bon Temps.

376
00:20:49,642 --> 00:20:50,642
Fast.

377
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:53,445
Yeah. Do my best.

378
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,131
That's all we ask.

379
00:20:55,313 --> 00:20:57,753
Thank you so much
for your cooperation.

380
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:01,958
Lurlene Butterman.

381
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,698
You know, I cannot wait
to vote for you.

382
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:07,230
Well, bless your heart, Lurlene.

383
00:21:07,355 --> 00:21:10,433
And you know, I cannot wait
to represent your views in Congress.

384
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:13,232
- Thanks for coming by.
- You know, I would also like to say...

385
00:21:13,392 --> 00:21:16,098
Move ahead, young woman.
The senator got many...

386
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:18,446
admirers.

387
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:21,490
- Hello.
- Hello.

388
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:26,828
I am so happy and proud to shake
the hand of someone with your values.

389
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:31,780
Too often we're governed
by criminals

390
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:34,545
and hypocrites, don't you agree?

391
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,424
But I can tell
you're a man of virtues.

392
00:21:38,786 --> 00:21:43,032
And I applaud the effort you're making
against the poor and disenfranchised,

393
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:46,223
especially the vampires
and the gays.

394
00:21:46,498 --> 00:21:47,952
Thank you. Next?

395
00:21:48,469 --> 00:21:51,382
So many things can happen

396
00:21:51,507 --> 00:21:54,732
to bring down a fine personage
such as yourself.

397
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:58,277
You might want to be careful, you hear?

398
00:22:01,008 --> 00:22:03,074
- Look at the camera.
- No.

399
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,573
Thanks for coming by.

400
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:22,696
Did you have to work late?

401
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:27,612
It doesn't matter, I... I just...

402
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:34,624
Didn't want to come home.

403
00:22:40,487 --> 00:22:41,876
I was afraid

404
00:22:42,285 --> 00:22:43,656
you might've left.

405
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:49,766
I want to be here.
I want to be with you.

406
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:52,168
- But you can't stay if...
- I did what you said.

407
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:55,042
It was all my fault, Jason. I'm
so, so sorry.

408
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:07,477
Did you make dinner for me?

409
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,885
I'd do anything for you.

410
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:16,788
Come here.

411
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:30,673
We'll make it right.

412
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:03,569
Help me.

413
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,648
Why's the way home always
longer than the way there?

414
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,128
Now that'd be philosophy,
and I'm a simple guy.

415
00:24:25,253 --> 00:24:26,951
What a load of horse pucky.

416
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:30,554
- Simple is one thing that you are not.
- I disagree.

417
00:24:30,715 --> 00:24:33,678
I may be a shape-shifter
but I want what every man wants.

418
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:36,591
You know, a good life,

419
00:24:36,914 --> 00:24:38,240
a good woman.

420
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:43,885
Do you love Tara?

421
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:50,326
You know, I like her a lot.

422
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,684
I care about her, for sure.

423
00:24:55,897 --> 00:24:58,374
I've been trying to love her,
but, you know, she don't make it easy.

424
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:01,428
Well, she can't help it.
When you've never had much love...

425
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:03,712
Oh, I know, I know.
Believe me, I know, but...

426
00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:06,615
It's...

427
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:08,944
It's not working.

428
00:25:09,706 --> 00:25:11,507
You know, we're friends, is all.

429
00:25:13,824 --> 00:25:16,059
And I'm not so easy to love, either.

430
00:25:17,286 --> 00:25:18,560
You're wrong.

431
00:25:20,237 --> 00:25:21,257
I am?

432
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,631
Do you love Bill?

433
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:40,827
I think I do.

434
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,126
But...

435
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:44,801
where is he?

436
00:25:47,435 --> 00:25:50,432
If vampire politics are more
important to him than me...

437
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:54,492
I don't know.

438
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,255
I'm so mad at him I could spit.

439
00:25:59,804 --> 00:26:01,605
I can see where you would be.

440
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:05,482
I'm sorry
you're having to drive so far.

441
00:26:08,043 --> 00:26:10,404
I don't mind.
I love to ride in the car.

442
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:14,318
Of course you do.

443
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:18,761
Go on, hang your head right out
the window, if you feel like it.

444
00:26:19,108 --> 00:26:21,832
I appreciate that
but it's a private pleasure.

445
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:27,483
One day when all this is over,

446
00:26:28,142 --> 00:26:29,553
I'm gonna save up

447
00:26:29,678 --> 00:26:32,199
and rent a convertible,
take it to the Gulf.

448
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,582
Lie on the beach, bake in the sun...

449
00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:37,761
It's a date.

450
00:26:47,028 --> 00:26:48,734
Do you know any car songs?

451
00:26:52,704 --> 00:26:55,282
Damn, woman.
Where'd you learn to cook like that?

452
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:57,847
From the maid.
She was French.

453
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:00,983
If I show you something,

454
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:04,147
you have to promise
that you're not gonna get mad.

455
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:06,522
Oh, I'm never getting mad
at you again. Never ever.

456
00:27:06,647 --> 00:27:08,462
Promise.
Yeah, I promise.

457
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:11,894
I saved one drop.

458
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:15,928
Motherfucker.

459
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:18,513
Babe, please don't flip.

460
00:27:20,861 --> 00:27:23,852
We both know that we're for real.
That we're gonna have a life together.

461
00:27:24,496 --> 00:27:26,080
So, what are you doing with that?

462
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:29,384
You're killing me.
I can't trust you for a second.

463
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:32,482
You can trust me totally,
for always, I swear.

464
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:35,551
- It's just that I want symmetry.
- Now, what the fuck is that?

465
00:27:35,676 --> 00:27:37,954
Balance. Harmony. Beauty.

466
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,203
- For crying out loud...
- Babe, this vial is our past.

467
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,946
We started with V,
so we should end it with V.

468
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:45,595
Like closing a circle.

469
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,605
So we can start a new circle,
our new life together.

470
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:51,145
I'm through with the blood.

471
00:27:51,554 --> 00:27:53,236
It's only a symbol.

472
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:56,801
But the circle... I mean,
that's what's important to me.

473
00:28:05,636 --> 00:28:06,656
Never mind.

474
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:09,815
I'll gonna go by myself.

475
00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:19,199
- But this is the last fucking time.
- Last time.

476
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,374
Cheers to our future, baby.

477
00:28:40,113 --> 00:28:41,806
You drank from me.

478
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:44,422
Your blood was replaced with mine

479
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:47,990
and then I shared my essence with you
when we slept together in the ground.

480
00:28:48,722 --> 00:28:50,808
No, no, not intercourse.

481
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:53,144
You just said intercourse.

482
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,578
It's tradition,
it's part of the process, it's magical.

483
00:28:58,138 --> 00:29:00,157
Even we don't fully
understand how it works.

484
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:02,957
Yeah, well, all I know is,
staying out at night like this?

485
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:04,797
My daddy is gonna whoop you good.

486
00:29:04,922 --> 00:29:06,803
Mister, you better
get me home right now.

487
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:07,978
Jessica, stop.

488
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:09,437
Stop.

489
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,283
- Why?
- Because we need to talk.

490
00:29:14,408 --> 00:29:16,378
- Why?
- There are things you must learn.

491
00:29:16,503 --> 00:29:18,387
- Why?
- Because you are no longer human.

492
00:29:18,512 --> 00:29:20,844
- Why?
- Because, as I've been trying
to explain to you,

493
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:22,558
you have been made vampire.

494
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:27,067
Why?

495
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,375
Because you were unlucky.

496
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:32,817
Because life and death are unfair.

497
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:38,220
Because of me.

498
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,054
You cannot go home.

499
00:29:46,505 --> 00:29:48,371
That part of your life is over.

500
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,175
No more Mama and Daddy?

501
00:29:54,248 --> 00:29:55,716
No more little sister?

502
00:29:58,819 --> 00:29:59,906
I'm sorry.

503
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:04,388
No more belts.

504
00:30:05,495 --> 00:30:06,949
No more clarinets.

505
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,499
No more homeschool.

506
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,144
No more rules.

507
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:17,025
I'm a vampire.

508
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,451
No, no, no, no.
There are rules.

509
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:23,447
That's what I tried to teach you.

510
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,845
Crap on your rules.
Crap, crap, crap.

511
00:30:26,445 --> 00:30:28,268
I can say anything I want now.

512
00:30:28,463 --> 00:30:30,560
Shit, shit, shit.

513
00:30:30,685 --> 00:30:32,829
Damn, hell, fuck!

514
00:30:32,954 --> 00:30:34,430
"Fuck", that's a bad one.

515
00:30:34,555 --> 00:30:35,965
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

516
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:38,101
What's another cussword
so I can say it?

517
00:30:38,226 --> 00:30:40,082
I'm a damn vampire.

518
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:43,167
If you calm down, I will teach
you what being a vampire means.

519
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:46,542
I'm not stupid. I can read.
I know what it means.

520
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,512
Very well, then.
Why don't you tell me?

521
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:51,598
It means that I don't have
to sit like a lady.

522
00:30:52,014 --> 00:30:53,853
And I can kill anybody I want.

523
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:57,679
And there is an awful lot
of people I'd like to kill.

524
00:30:57,804 --> 00:31:01,309
No, Jessica, you absolutely
cannot kill anybody you want.

525
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:02,861
But why?

526
00:31:03,022 --> 00:31:04,427
Why? I want to kill them.

527
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:08,001
With your new powers
come new responsibilities.

528
00:31:08,356 --> 00:31:10,704
You are gonna mainstream, like I do.

529
00:31:10,948 --> 00:31:14,420
You can live almost exactly
the same life as you did before,

530
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:16,839
except you'll be awake at night.

531
00:31:16,964 --> 00:31:19,675
I want to kill people.
And I'm so hungry.

532
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,966
And all you do is talk
and I'm starving. And you are so mean.

533
00:31:23,304 --> 00:31:24,843
You're supposed to take care of me.

534
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:27,550
That's what you said.
And, oh, you suck.

535
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:32,726
That's funny, because you do suck.

536
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:34,819
Here,

537
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:36,896
drink this.
It might make you feel more steady.

538
00:31:37,389 --> 00:31:38,398
I hope.

539
00:31:40,018 --> 00:31:41,750
It tastes like shit.

540
00:31:42,395 --> 00:31:44,133
Why are you doing this to me?

541
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:46,321
It's not bad.
You'll get used to it.

542
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,305
- Try a little more.
- Fuck, no, and you can't force me.

543
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,286
- I will report you.
- Oh, really? To whom?

544
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:55,258
I'll find a real vampire
and he'll kick your ass.

545
00:31:57,358 --> 00:32:00,670
You won't let me do anything
and I am so hungry.

546
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:04,330
You are the worst maker ever.

547
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,991
Tara, visitor.

548
00:32:16,607 --> 00:32:17,607
Mama.

549
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,189
Oh, child.

550
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:24,076
You looking good, Lettie May.

551
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:26,702
Whatever you doing, keep it up.

552
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:29,181
Thank you, Kenya.
That's sweet.

553
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,917
Could you leave us alone
for a minute?

554
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:36,146
Oh, yes, ma'am.

555
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:37,985
What are you saying?

556
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,091
Get back here and let me out.

557
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:45,215
Who the fuck does she think she is,
and what took you so damn long to show?

558
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:48,301
I called Mabel from church
and she came over to pray with me.

559
00:32:48,525 --> 00:32:50,608
Pray?
While I'm locked up waiting?

560
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:53,591
Cut this bullshit.
Y'all can pray after you post my bail.

561
00:32:53,716 --> 00:32:56,100
Honey, I'm not here to bail you out.

562
00:32:57,632 --> 00:32:59,709
Mama, I'm tired.
I hurt all over.

563
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:02,314
- I want to go home. Don't play with me
- I'm not playing.

564
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,858
Yes, you are. You gotta be.

565
00:33:04,018 --> 00:33:05,448
Seeing you like this?

566
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:07,612
It breaks my heart.

567
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:11,031
How many nights have I spent
in this place,

568
00:33:11,192 --> 00:33:12,510
crazy with liquor,

569
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:14,369
lost to myself and the Lord?

570
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:16,621
Not many, because I bailed you out.

571
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:19,958
Maybe you shouldn't have.

572
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:22,085
What the fuck are you talking about?

573
00:33:23,357 --> 00:33:24,637
You can't come home.

574
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,024
I'm not gonna let you.

575
00:33:27,763 --> 00:33:30,185
You're changing right in front
of my eyes,

576
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,182
and I'm scared for both of us.

577
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:34,639
I don't believe this.

578
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:38,249
I am committed to salvation

579
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,598
and you're on the road to hell.

580
00:33:40,723 --> 00:33:42,885
I would save you if I could, baby.

581
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,732
Nobody loves you more.

582
00:33:46,432 --> 00:33:48,341
But you're a danger to my soul

583
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:50,989
and I can't have you in my house.

584
00:33:52,974 --> 00:33:55,159
I'm the only reason
you have a house.

585
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:59,174
After all the times
I cleaned you up,

586
00:33:59,478 --> 00:34:02,190
all the times you beat me
and stole my money,

587
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:05,029
then sent me to school

588
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:07,026
dirty,

589
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:09,443
in dirty clothes,

590
00:34:10,365 --> 00:34:13,208
so people laughed at me
and called me names.

591
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,388
My whole life is shit
because of you!

592
00:34:16,798 --> 00:34:17,798
I know.

593
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,030
I know.

594
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,811
Don't tear me up like this.
I feel so bad.

595
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:26,008
And the first time I'm in trouble,
you turn your back on the one person

596
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:27,786
who's always stood by you.

597
00:34:28,445 --> 00:34:29,944
And you call yourself a Christian?

598
00:34:30,832 --> 00:34:33,169
I'm finally doing
right by you, Tara,

599
00:34:33,294 --> 00:34:34,637
like a mother should.

600
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:36,951
You'll see that
when the clouds roll away.

601
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:38,664
Fuck you.

602
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,117
You're not my mother.

603
00:34:42,336 --> 00:34:45,117
Get out of my sight you evil bitch.

604
00:34:51,236 --> 00:34:52,341
I love you.

605
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:53,884
No, you don't.

606
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:58,004
You never did.

607
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:38,201
Baby.

608
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:49,657
Earthquake.

609
00:37:57,198 --> 00:37:58,441
Did you feel...?

610
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:27,014
Please.

611
00:38:27,782 --> 00:38:29,149
Please. No.

612
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,391
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

613
00:39:12,454 --> 00:39:14,689
Yeah, this is Jason Stackhouse.

614
00:39:14,814 --> 00:39:17,253
<i>Oh, hey, Jason. It's Rosie.</i>

615
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:19,012
You all better come out here.

616
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,259
She's your punishment, not mine.

617
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:27,680
- What am I supposed to do with her?
- Excuse me. I can hear you, Mr. Rude.

618
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:31,398
I wanna go to the bar.
I wanna be one of those dancers.

619
00:39:32,193 --> 00:39:34,627
- I'm hungry.
- She won't listen to me.

620
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,772
It will take more time than
I have to teach her obedience.

621
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:40,427
I don't obey anybody.
Those days are over.

622
00:39:41,188 --> 00:39:43,336
Can't handle one little girl, Bill?

623
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:45,860
Newborns can be like this.

624
00:39:47,224 --> 00:39:49,315
Man up, my friend.
She's not even one night old.

625
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,081
That is not the issue.

626
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:53,698
You want to stay
with your maker, don't you?

627
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:55,311
No. He's a dick.

628
00:39:55,716 --> 00:39:56,812
Dick, dick, dick.

629
00:39:59,454 --> 00:40:00,560
You're cute.

630
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,151
Can I sit on your lap?

631
00:40:03,312 --> 00:40:05,058
- No.
- Why?

632
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:08,699
Nobody let's me having any fun.
Fuckers!

633
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:10,826
Sit down and shut up.

634
00:40:13,238 --> 00:40:14,338
Close the door.

635
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:21,127
You have to be tough with them,
or they'll walk all over you.

636
00:40:21,475 --> 00:40:24,220
I am well aware of that,
but you can see how she is,

637
00:40:24,345 --> 00:40:26,508
and there are urgent matters
to which I must attend.

638
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:31,094
Haven't you done enough for her?

639
00:40:32,253 --> 00:40:35,564
If any harm were to come to her
because of my absence, you would be...

640
00:40:38,577 --> 00:40:39,597
What?

641
00:40:41,013 --> 00:40:42,749
Without her helpful skills.

642
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,909
Let me out.
I wanna do something bad.

643
00:40:48,964 --> 00:40:50,548
I would be in your debt.

644
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:54,529
- I would return the favor.
- Oh, yes, you will.

645
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:58,499
You most definitely will.

646
00:41:01,398 --> 00:41:03,221
You don't have to yell at me.

647
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:06,006
How would you like to learn
how a real vampire feeds?

648
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:09,891
Oh, yes, sir.

649
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:11,943
Please, sir.

650
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,860
See?

651
00:41:14,581 --> 00:41:16,016
It's really quite easy.

652
00:41:21,766 --> 00:41:22,873
Tara, wake up.

653
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:26,298
This lady paid your bail.
You're free to go.

654
00:41:27,883 --> 00:41:30,656
Straighten up. I don't want
to see you back in here again.

655
00:41:33,984 --> 00:41:36,036
My shift's over
in five minutes, Ms. Forrester.

656
00:41:36,384 --> 00:41:38,068
There are some papers
for her to sign.

657
00:41:38,193 --> 00:41:40,064
- You know the drill.
- Thank you, Kenya.

658
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:45,462
Who are you?

659
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,347
Why'd you pay my bail?

660
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:50,952
My name is Maryann

661
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:53,143
Forrester,

662
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:56,223
and I'd like to help you,
if you'll let me.

663
00:41:57,232 --> 00:41:59,467
What are you,
some kind of social worker?

664
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:02,222
Yeah, that's about right.

665
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:04,821
Kenya knows me. I'm in and out
of here all the time,

666
00:42:04,946 --> 00:42:06,803
working with people
in your position.

667
00:42:06,928 --> 00:42:08,247
My position.

668
00:42:08,746 --> 00:42:11,721
DUIs, minor assaults,
public drunkenness.

669
00:42:13,454 --> 00:42:17,119
You know, those times when
things go just a little too far.

670
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:21,894
It can happen to anyone.

671
00:42:23,652 --> 00:42:25,294
And I expect you have your reasons?

672
00:42:30,624 --> 00:42:31,592
I got reasons.

673
00:42:32,209 --> 00:42:34,845
I would be very happy
to give you a ride home.

674
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:37,270
No, thanks.

675
00:42:38,442 --> 00:42:41,244
Well, they...
They gave me your address.

676
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,021
And you can't walk there.
It's too far.

677
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,394
I... I can...

678
00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:53,405
- I got kicked out.
- You don't have anywhere to go.

679
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:57,117
No family. No friends.

680
00:42:58,238 --> 00:43:00,451
I don't want them
to see me like this.

681
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:03,229
It's okay.

682
00:43:04,605 --> 00:43:06,211
I'll think of something.

683
00:43:10,058 --> 00:43:12,857
I'm sure you've barely
slept or eaten.

684
00:43:14,247 --> 00:43:16,049
What if you come to my home?

685
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,405
Just till you get things
figured out.

686
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,472
I... I don't know.
I...

687
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:24,011
No. There's plenty of room.

688
00:43:24,136 --> 00:43:25,694
I do this all the time.

689
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:28,649
It's sort of an informal
halfway house.

690
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,854
Doesn't seem right.

691
00:43:31,297 --> 00:43:32,486
I know what you mean,

692
00:43:32,646 --> 00:43:35,489
but you can shower,
you can wash your clothes,

693
00:43:35,815 --> 00:43:37,388
you can let me feed you.

694
00:43:38,072 --> 00:43:42,120
Then you can go on your way
and my conscience will be clear.

695
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:45,425
You're not a Jesus person, are you?

696
00:43:48,992 --> 00:43:52,486
Nothing against religion,
but not a Jesus person.

697
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:09,955
Here's my card,

698
00:44:10,259 --> 00:44:11,712
in case you change your mind.

699
00:44:14,597 --> 00:44:15,834
Good luck, Tara.

700
00:44:21,342 --> 00:44:22,514
Wait.

701
00:44:33,915 --> 00:44:36,561
Holy shit. What the hell
kind of social worker are you?

702
00:44:36,686 --> 00:44:39,448
Actually, it was a gift.
Go on. Climb in.

703
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:44,680
- What's the matter?
- I'm all dirty.

704
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,436
Don't worry about that.
I get dirty too.

705
00:44:49,497 --> 00:44:52,839
Get that car out of here.
This is an official-vehicle zone.

706
00:44:52,964 --> 00:44:54,180
Read the fucking sign.

707
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:56,903
Detective Bellefleur, is it?

708
00:44:57,064 --> 00:44:59,869
Move the car.
Jesus Christ, you deaf?

709
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:03,368
I'm surrounded by assholes
and morons.

710
00:45:23,314 --> 00:45:26,036
It sounds strange
under the circumstances,

711
00:45:26,774 --> 00:45:28,901
but I had a good time today.

712
00:45:29,403 --> 00:45:30,705
It's the company.

713
00:45:31,377 --> 00:45:32,377
Must be.

714
00:45:33,924 --> 00:45:35,965
Hey, that says something for us.

715
00:45:36,327 --> 00:45:39,102
We can enjoy ourselves even
when we're trying to find a murderer.

716
00:45:40,982 --> 00:45:42,138
You are fun.

717
00:45:42,263 --> 00:45:45,281
It's one of the reasons
I'm still working for you.

718
00:45:45,862 --> 00:45:48,580
Well, it's not the tips
or the high-class clientele.

719
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,626
You know,

720
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,740
it was probably the best day
of my life

721
00:45:56,835 --> 00:45:59,027
when you walked in
looking for a job.

722
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:01,479
- Quit it.
- No, I mean it.

723
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:08,253
I know you do.

724
00:46:10,774 --> 00:46:12,467
Are you looking in my head?

725
00:46:14,373 --> 00:46:16,232
I'm looking in your heart.

726
00:46:18,532 --> 00:46:21,811
<i>She's from society.
She don't understand us kind of folks.</i>

727
00:46:21,936 --> 00:46:23,782
<i>Claims her ancestors...</i>

728
00:46:34,077 --> 00:46:35,115
Stop!

729
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,639
Stop fighting, you stupid men!

730
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:51,017
He had his hands over you.

731
00:46:51,177 --> 00:46:53,913
- She's not your property.
- Shut up. I can speak for myself.

732
00:46:54,038 --> 00:46:56,104
You left me alone
with no promise to come back,

733
00:46:56,229 --> 00:46:59,058
and attack the man who's helping
keep me safe? How dare you?

734
00:46:59,227 --> 00:47:01,069
He's helping because I asked him to.

735
00:47:01,279 --> 00:47:02,153
Get out!

736
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,493
If you knew what I had done
to return to you...

737
00:47:08,914 --> 00:47:10,286
I rescind your invitation.

738
00:47:13,154 --> 00:47:14,245
Sookie, don't.

739
00:47:15,152 --> 00:47:16,221
Please.

740
00:47:36,393 --> 00:47:38,433
Can't you see what he's really like?

741
00:47:39,084 --> 00:47:42,016
- How can you think about be with him?
- My living room's wrecked.

742
00:47:42,141 --> 00:47:44,658
I've got a killer, a vampire
and a shape-shifter on my plate.

743
00:47:44,783 --> 00:47:47,365
Right about now, I'm not thinking
about being with anybody.

744
00:47:58,238 --> 00:48:00,333
This is where you live?

745
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:02,255
Fuck me.

746
00:48:03,278 --> 00:48:05,550
Come on in, Tara.
Make yourself at home.

747
00:48:05,907 --> 00:48:06,968
If you insist.

748
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:09,387
I insist. Come on.

749
00:48:32,961 --> 00:48:34,437
I knew it was you.

750
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,623
I knew it from the second
we found Maudette.

751
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,148
People said:
"No, not Jason Stackhouse.

752
00:48:39,273 --> 00:48:40,877
"He's too dumb". But I knew.

753
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:44,125
I said that shifty bastard's
a goddamn psychopath.

754
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,986
I ain't arguing with you, Andy.

755
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:48,226
Detective.

756
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:50,892
- Tell us all about it, son.
- I'll tell you all about it.

757
00:48:51,017 --> 00:48:52,865
I'll tell you exactly what happened.

758
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:55,438
This piece of shit
lured those poor girls

759
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:58,727
into his king-size bed and dirty sheets
to fuck them and kill them.

760
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:01,960
Andy, he called us.
Let the boy confess.

761
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:03,439
Go ahead, Jason.

762
00:49:03,564 --> 00:49:04,814
How'd it happen?

763
00:49:07,068 --> 00:49:10,179
- I don't know.
- Oh, don't even try that on.

764
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:13,082
Bud, give me 5 min alone with him.
I'll get you every detail.

765
00:49:13,207 --> 00:49:15,007
What do you mean you don't know?

766
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:16,913
I don't remember what I done...

767
00:49:18,882 --> 00:49:20,083
... to any of them.

768
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,626
But they keep dying all around me,

769
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:26,047
so I gotta be the guy, right?

770
00:49:27,417 --> 00:49:28,985
Let's take them one at a time.

771
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,895
Yeah, let's start with Amy Burley.

772
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,349
That ought to be fresh
in your so-called mind.

773
00:49:36,998 --> 00:49:38,106
I took V.

774
00:49:39,354 --> 00:49:41,444
Not with the others, just with her.

775
00:49:41,569 --> 00:49:43,513
- We both did.
- V?

776
00:49:45,206 --> 00:49:46,206
I knew it.

777
00:49:49,317 --> 00:49:50,793
And when I woke up,

778
00:49:52,647 --> 00:49:53,700
Amy was...

779
00:49:55,484 --> 00:49:56,661
Well, like she was.

780
00:49:56,821 --> 00:49:59,644
Dead's the word you're looking for.
Stone-cold dead.

781
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,301
We were alone in the house.

782
00:50:09,608 --> 00:50:11,539
God, I must have done it.

783
00:50:14,197 --> 00:50:15,781
But I don't know why.

784
00:50:16,793 --> 00:50:19,050
And honest to God, I loved her.

785
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:20,309
Bullshit.

786
00:50:21,006 --> 00:50:22,552
You hated Maudette.

787
00:50:22,677 --> 00:50:25,039
- You hated Dawn.
- I didn't hate them.

788
00:50:26,104 --> 00:50:28,024
I mean,
we had some pretty good times.

789
00:50:28,149 --> 00:50:30,954
It was... It was fucking
and fighting, like with any girl.

790
00:50:34,044 --> 00:50:37,467
I just... I don't understand
what would have made me do it.

791
00:50:40,394 --> 00:50:43,205
Your gran knew what you were like.
She guessed, she called you out,

792
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:45,108
and you grabbed a knife
and went to town.

793
00:50:45,233 --> 00:50:46,926
No, I didn't kill Gran

794
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,614
and you know it.

795
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:51,048
You better damn well find who did.

796
00:50:51,209 --> 00:50:53,301
This is the worst confession
I ever heard in my life.

797
00:50:53,779 --> 00:50:55,884
Fuck you, Andy, that's all I got!

798
00:51:07,684 --> 00:51:08,684
Look,

799
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:12,545
I don't want to hurt nobody else.

800
00:51:14,777 --> 00:51:15,948
Lock me up.

801
00:51:17,863 --> 00:51:19,785
For Christ's sake, lock me up.

802
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,456
Not before we get some solid facts.

803
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:27,116
We'll fucking waterboard you
if that's what it takes.

804
00:51:27,577 --> 00:51:29,170
- What?
- Lock him up.

805
00:51:37,518 --> 00:51:40,097
Come on, now.
About time you found the law.

806
00:51:40,421 --> 00:51:42,799
Hey, wake up. I know it's early.

807
00:51:42,924 --> 00:51:45,436
But I gotta tell you...
Wait, somebody's coming.

808
00:51:52,497 --> 00:51:53,907
Girl, guess what?

809
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,128
Jason Stackhouse is the murderer.

810
00:51:57,253 --> 00:51:58,657
Yes, I swear.

811
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,661
He's looking all crazy, in a hot way.
You know him.

812
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:04,758
But they're throwing him
in a cell right now.

813
00:52:05,783 --> 00:52:08,466
We are so lucky he didn't kill us.
