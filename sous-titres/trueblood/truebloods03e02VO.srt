1
00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:15,374
My ear.

2
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:17,404
My fucking ear.

3
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:33,255
You're next.

4
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,109
Heel.

5
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:45,044
Your Majesty.

6
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,383
I said escort him,
not hunt him like an animal.

7
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:53,719
He is a goddamn animal.

8
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,222
He killed three of us,
ripped off Louie's ear.

9
00:00:57,395 --> 00:01:00,184
You're about to get deader,
dead-ass motherfucker.

10
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:01,394
Cooter.

11
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:03,813
Back off.

12
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,833
- Seriously?
- Call me that again.

13
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:10,444
I fucking dare you.

14
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:13,674
Coot can be a little sensitive
about his name

15
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,377
and the evisceration of his friends.

16
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:20,490
For future reference, Coot,
I'm not a fan of improvisation.

17
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:21,956
When I give you an order,

18
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:24,491
I expect it to be followed exactly.

19
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:26,043
You understand?

20
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,553
These wolves do your bidding?

21
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:31,766
Unfortunately,
not as well as I'd hoped.

22
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,634
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Compton.

23
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:35,553
You're sorry?

24
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:39,432
Your Majesty,
you've had me abducted by werewolves.

25
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,768
Dragged across state lines.

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,311
They took silver to me,

27
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,104
fed on my blood.

28
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:48,528
You drank...

29
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:51,238
from my guest?

30
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,126
Join me at my home.

31
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:09,352
I will explain everything.

32
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:13,424
That was an order.

33
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:03,065
Tara, what...

34
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,410
What are you doing?

35
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:13,245
Open up your goddamn mouth.
I ain't playing.

36
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:15,120
Spit it out.

37
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,922
What are you doing to her?

38
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,201
Saving her life.

39
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:20,801
You're too busy praising Jesus
to realize your daughter

40
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,593
trying to move in with him.

41
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,014
You can go to hell for this, baby.

42
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,058
- Please, Lord, forgive her.
- Will you move the fuck back?

43
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,603
Get out of the way.
With a mother like you,

44
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,229
it's a miracle she ain't do this.

45
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,271
Where you taking her?
Hospital.

46
00:04:34,396 --> 00:04:36,808
No. Let me go.
I'm going with you.

47
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:39,144
You failed this girl
for the last time, you hear me?

48
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:41,764
Now get the fuck up out my way.

49
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:50,087
It stands for Operation Werwolf,

50
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:53,584
some kind of secret Nazi commando force
from World War II.

51
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,878
You found this
branded on a dead man's neck?

52
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,673
Bill summoned Jessica there.

53
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,423
He wants to show us
who kidnapped him.

54
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,133
Nazi werewolves.

55
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:03,344
That dead guy was strong,

56
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,679
fast enough to take Bill.
He had to be supernatural.

57
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:08,306
I was hoping you could tell us more.

58
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:09,981
Never seen it before.

59
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:13,062
Why do I think
you're blowing me off?

60
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:20,269
Let's go to the ladies' room
and stare at ourselves in the mirror.

61
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,416
Here's what I know about werewolves:

62
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,652
There's a reason
their existence has remained

63
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:30,327
a myth to humans
for thousands of years.

64
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:33,173
They're territorial, vicious,

65
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:35,345
pathologically secretive.

66
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,467
Boy, does that sound familiar.

67
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:39,444
And here's what I know about you:

68
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:42,742
You're so blinded
by your obsession with Bill Compton,

69
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:46,345
you're likely to run through the streets
screaming "werewolf bait",

70
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,342
alerting whoever has Bill
that we're onto them

71
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:50,975
or getting yourself killed.

72
00:05:51,302 --> 00:05:52,351
I'm that stupid?

73
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:54,061
No, you're human.

74
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,437
Don't underestimate me.

75
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,939
Don't underestimate yourself.

76
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,651
Your life is too valuable
to throw away.

77
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:15,249
So, Pam,

78
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,716
when you're feeding on someone,

79
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:22,548
- how do you not kill 'em?
- Bill didn't teach you that?

80
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:26,248
Bill doesn't want me
to feed on people.

81
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,941
And now he's gone and...

82
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:34,065
It's in the heartbeat.
You feel it in the blood.

83
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:39,094
And when it slows, you stop.

84
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,157
But how do you stop?

85
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:54,336
I think about crying children
with soggy diapers.

86
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:55,497
Also maggots.

87
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:02,366
Let's say...

88
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:06,008
that you did kill somebody
by accident.

89
00:07:08,992 --> 00:07:11,055
What would you do with the body?

90
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:14,058
You have no connections
in the were community.

91
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,895
They're not gonna answer your questions.
They don't want you to know they exist.

92
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:21,033
Bill's out there somewhere
in danger.

93
00:07:22,072 --> 00:07:24,693
I can't just go on with life
like that's not happening.

94
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:26,493
You know that,

95
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,601
maybe better than anyone.

96
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:31,492
- When Godric went miss...
- Bill Compton is no Godric.

97
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:34,311
But he's everything to me.

98
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,590
Please don't do that.

99
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,617
It makes me feel...

100
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:45,227
disturbingly human.

101
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:48,244
I risked my life
to help you find Godric,

102
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,044
and I don't expect you
to do the same for Bill,

103
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:52,769
but at the very least,

104
00:07:53,757 --> 00:07:54,757
I hope...

105
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:56,934
you'll help me if you can.

106
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:06,406
You gotta get me home before dawn.

107
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,129
It's going to be all right.

108
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:03,792
I won't hurt you.

109
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:21,453
You're late.

110
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:23,473
Talbot.

111
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,167
Welcome to Mississippi.

112
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:31,421
Sorry I'm not dressed,
but we were expecting you last night.

113
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,507
There were complications
with his escort.

114
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:35,506
Fucking werewolves.

115
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:39,155
Let's show you to your room,
get you all cleaned up.

116
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,055
My room?

117
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:43,350
Your Majesty,
you promised me an explanation.

118
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:48,392
And I have no intention
of letting you leave without one.

119
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:51,942
I just redecorated the guest room.

120
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:55,130
Wait till you see the bed, Bill.
It's marvelous.

121
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:58,112
It once belonged
to Countess Elizabeth Bathory,

122
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:01,206
Hungary's legendary serial killer.

123
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:02,809
Rumor has it...

124
00:11:02,934 --> 00:11:05,290
that she loved to torture virgins

125
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,165
and bathe in their blood.

126
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:14,371
Now, be careful of the door, Bill.

127
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:17,114
It's 100 percent sterling silver
from Morocco.

128
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:19,928
It's light-tight, of course.

129
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,962
Bathtub's through there.

130
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:25,267
And if you need anything,

131
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:27,394
anything at all,

132
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:29,775
someone will always be
right outside of your door.

133
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,808
Just ring the little bell.

134
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:36,278
You're only making matters worse
for yourself by holding me captive.

135
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,029
No one's holding anyone captive.

136
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:42,534
We're conducting business.
You're a guest

137
00:11:42,812 --> 00:11:43,862
in my home.

138
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:45,549
Guests are invited.

139
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:47,289
Guests can leave
of their own accord.

140
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,286
And once you've heard my proposal,

141
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,043
so can you, if you choose.

142
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:52,627
Enough business.

143
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:54,611
Time to rest.

144
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:56,562
You had the bleeds twice this week.

145
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:58,967
We'll talk over dinner.

146
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:01,136
So nice to meet you, Bill.

147
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,721
Enjoy the bed.

148
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:12,562
He's a challenge.

149
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:15,437
I think
I'm gonna have to bring in the girl.

150
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:18,368
I threw up all the pills.
I'm okay.

151
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:21,993
I don't need to go to the hospital.
Just pull over, please.

152
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,494
Bitch, you tried to kill yourself.

153
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:30,969
I didn't plan it.

154
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,570
I just saw the bottles,
and I thought:

155
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:37,172
"Enough".
I deserve some peace.

156
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,588
And I deserve to plan
your fucking funeral?

157
00:12:39,713 --> 00:12:41,843
Spend the rest of my goddamn life
blaming myself?

158
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,011
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:45,929
If you take me to the hospital,
they'll lock me in a padded room,

160
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:48,350
drug me, and force me
to tell them what happened.

161
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,511
If I tell them
about Eggs and Maryann,

162
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:54,022
they'll throw away the key.

163
00:12:57,729 --> 00:12:59,361
Eggs would want you to live.

164
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,179
Eggs doesn't want shit.

165
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:05,139
Eggs is dead.

166
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:10,928
The one time in my entire life
I thought I was happy,

167
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,542
I was a fucking zombie.

168
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,130
What the hell is wrong with me,
Lafayette?

169
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:21,425
Life ain't not
having problems, Tara.

170
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,219
It's about being able to deal
with the ones you got.

171
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,557
Obviously, I can't.

172
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,671
You can and you will,

173
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:31,017
if I gotta drag your narrow ass
through the world kicking and screaming.

174
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:34,855
Look, the Buddhists weren't lying
when they said life is suffering.

175
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:39,401
It don't mean you get to check out early
and leave me here.

176
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:44,788
What are you doing?

177
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:47,617
First,
I'm gonna get some food in you.

178
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:50,698
Second,

179
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,416
there's something you need to see.

180
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:03,912
You want me to stay here?

181
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:06,595
I feel weird leaving you all alone.

182
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,170
I'm a vampire, Sookie.
I don't need...

183
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:13,518
I don't need a babysitter.

184
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,380
Of course you don't.

185
00:14:18,114 --> 00:14:19,232
Be gentle with him.

186
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,403
- If you feel anything from Bill...
- I'll call you.

187
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,793
What are you doing here?
It's almost dawn.

188
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,583
B positive.

189
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,878
Thought you might be hungry.

190
00:14:42,804 --> 00:14:45,133
You can't keep showing up,
leaving stuff at my door.

191
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:47,311
Now, listen to me.

192
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:52,599
If there's one thing that I learned
from this whole thing with my mama,

193
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:55,339
it's that
I gotta take better care of you.

194
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,544
Of course you couldn't control yourself.
Be like if I hadn't eaten

195
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:02,317
and people were walking around
with hamburgers on their necks.

196
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,487
That's not what it's like.

197
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:08,532
You don't know what it's like.
You never will.

198
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,199
Biting people,

199
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:12,409
getting so mad
that I do bad things by accident,

200
00:15:12,534 --> 00:15:14,371
that's in my...
It's in my nature.

201
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:17,192
Wanna know what's in my nature?

202
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:19,709
Running back to my mama

203
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,963
and doing anything that she tells me
for the rest of my life.

204
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:25,632
I ain't gonna do it.

205
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,803
We can fight our natures together.

206
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,670
It's too late.

207
00:15:37,998 --> 00:15:39,913
Don't say that, Jessica.

208
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
So gross.

209
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:06,022
My family junk.

210
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,926
I'm sorry.

211
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:11,657
It's 5 A.M.

212
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,782
What are you doing
eating my chicken in the dark?

213
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:15,792
I couldn't sleep.

214
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:23,733
I just kept thinking
about how Gran would be doing

215
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:26,294
handstands in her grave
if she saw her...

216
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:28,612
Her house like this.

217
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:31,387
So I thought
I'd come and clean up, and...

218
00:17:32,103 --> 00:17:33,703
And then I got hungry.

219
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,846
I figured you'd be with Bill.

220
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:43,853
What did I say?

221
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,071
There's werewolves?

222
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:55,498
Holy shit.

223
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,142
Bigfoot? Is he real too?

224
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,309
- I don't know. I guess it's possible.
- Santa?

225
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:02,747
Jason, focus.

226
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,205
- Sorry. What can I do to help?
- Nothing.

227
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:09,504
That's what I'm supposed to do too,
which is totally impossible.

228
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:12,756
Every sound I hear,
every time the phone rings,

229
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:14,718
every shadow, I think it's Bill.

230
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,501
I keep expecting him
to come through the door and say...

231
00:18:23,022 --> 00:18:24,512
Let me talk to Andy.

232
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,813
I won't tell him
the whole werewolf part,

233
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:29,573
but maybe there's something
he could do to help.

234
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:32,978
We went through some pretty...

235
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:35,447
intense shit together
during the whole Maryann thing.

236
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:38,158
What kind of shit?

237
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,370
I don't know.
I don't remember half of it.

238
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:45,312
And don't even think
about reading my mind,

239
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:47,631
because I just wanna
put all that behind me.

240
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:49,961
You heard about Eggs.

241
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:52,868
I helped him remember things.

242
00:18:53,368 --> 00:18:56,509
That's why he went after Andy
and got himself killed.

243
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,812
That wasn't your fault, believe me.

244
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,723
Tell that to Tara.
I don't think she's gonna forgive me.

245
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:04,584
Maybe I deserve that.

246
00:19:05,886 --> 00:19:07,688
Well, you were just trying to help.

247
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:09,606
It's the thought that counts.

248
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:14,272
Tara's tough. She'll get through it.

249
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,947
Sookie, you just need some sleep.

250
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:20,571
Let me worry about Bill for a while.

251
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,664
It's just you and me now.

252
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:30,418
Well, you're gonna marry Bill,
and now it's you, me and Bill.

253
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:45,516
Don't move.

254
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:47,435
Get out.

255
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:52,573
Which is it?
Don't move or get out of the car?

256
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:57,165
Come on.

257
00:19:58,769 --> 00:19:59,769
Hey, Mama!

258
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:02,703
Joe Lee.

259
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,746
Quit hollering.

260
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:08,569
It's too dang early.

261
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:14,295
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell is he?

262
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:18,216
My name's Sam Merlotte.

263
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,030
That's the guy I told you about,
the one asking all the questions.

264
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:25,306
- Found him spying.
- Spying? I was sleeping.

265
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:28,017
All right?
Put the gun down.

266
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:31,271
- I'm not here to hurt nobody.
- You from Collections?

267
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:33,967
Because I put that check in the mail
yesterday.

268
00:20:35,252 --> 00:20:36,802
That name's familiar.

269
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:39,095
We met before?

270
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,971
Thirty-four years ago.

271
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:49,038
Tommy, put the gun down.

272
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:51,875
- What?
- Put the gun down.

273
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:56,616
It's you.

274
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,724
It's really you.

275
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:02,781
It's really who?

276
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,892
Who is he?

277
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:28,380
<i>Grab her, knock her out.</i>

278
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:31,638
<i>Be back in time to watch</i>
Let's Make a Deal.

279
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:38,291
Morning, Sook.

280
00:21:39,827 --> 00:21:41,049
You okay?

281
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:45,178
Did you just see someone here?

282
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,890
When I see things
other people don't.

283
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:52,208
It's because I ain't taking
my medication and I...

284
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:57,140
Come on out, you big coward.

285
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:58,858
What have you done with Bill?

286
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,631
Motorcycle boot. Size 10.

287
00:22:26,222 --> 00:22:28,222
- Now, that's just weird.
- What?

288
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:30,715
Tracks end here.
Which don't make a lick of sense

289
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,940
unless he turned himself into a bird
and flew away.

290
00:22:36,582 --> 00:22:37,582
Or a wolf.

291
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,430
Panther or coyote maybe,

292
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,678
but I ain't never seen no wolves
in these parts.

293
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:49,624
Until now.

294
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,658
Jesus Christi.

295
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,185
What the fuck, Lafayette?

296
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:12,314
We drive 2 h 30 to show me something
and you take me to a fucking nuthouse.

297
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,184
How could you?
You can't commit me against my will.

298
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,953
- I know my rights.
- Ain't nobody fucking committing you,

299
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:20,864
but if you don't chill out quick,
somebody might change their mind.

300
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:32,201
We're here
to see Ruby Jean Reynolds, please.

301
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,309
Just one bite. Come on.

302
00:23:39,844 --> 00:23:42,086
Come on, Ruby.
You gotta eat something.

303
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:46,174
Why do you do this?

304
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:50,659
Can I help you?

305
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:53,269
That's just my son, Lafayette.

306
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:57,685
You told me your son passed away.

307
00:23:58,139 --> 00:23:59,139
He did.

308
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,646
God killed him

309
00:24:01,262 --> 00:24:02,731
because he's a faggot.

310
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,769
But he keep coming back.

311
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:10,571
This is Jesus.

312
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:14,077
He's a Mexican,
but he ain't raped me yet.

313
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:18,414
I'm sorry.

314
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,566
Don't worry. I'm used to it.

315
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:24,187
This is my cousin, Tara.

316
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:28,112
I'm glad you're here.

317
00:24:28,352 --> 00:24:30,980
I've been taking care of your mother
for six months.

318
00:24:31,825 --> 00:24:33,429
I think you're the first visitor.

319
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:35,279
Don't listen to him.

320
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,851
People just keep coming and going.
They coming and going, baby.

321
00:24:39,384 --> 00:24:43,106
What you want with me, Lafayette?
Wish to hell they'd leave me alone.

322
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:48,111
Listen, if you can get her to
eat something, you'd be my hero.

323
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,131
He spits in my food

324
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:52,281
through them rotten-cheese teeth.

325
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:54,051
Wetback.

326
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:57,311
- Oh, my fucking...
- Nice to meet you.

327
00:25:04,344 --> 00:25:06,044
Mama, you remember Tara.

328
00:25:11,646 --> 00:25:13,096
God killed you too.

329
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:15,328
Almost.

330
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:19,761
Well, that's my job.

331
00:25:20,006 --> 00:25:22,940
I was just doing what I had to
to protect myself,

332
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:24,147
but I ain't no hero.

333
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:27,239
Detective Bellefleur,
in addition to being stabbed,

334
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:29,627
the victims
were also clawed by an animal.

335
00:25:29,752 --> 00:25:31,362
What kind of animal was that?

336
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:33,990
Well, that's a good question.

337
00:25:36,353 --> 00:25:40,163
And, I'm sure Sheriff Dearborne
would love to answer it for you.

338
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:42,752
- Detective...
- Can I get one other question?

339
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,086
We're still working on that.

340
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:49,896
We're not sure if the suspect
trained the animal.

341
00:25:50,021 --> 00:25:51,716
What are you doing here, Stackhouse?

342
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:55,511
These reporters, they're here for you?
Is this because of Eggs?

343
00:25:55,777 --> 00:25:58,258
No, it's because of me winning
the Miss America Pageant.

344
00:25:58,383 --> 00:26:01,267
- Thought I told you to lay low.
- I need your help with something.

345
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:05,301
- Ain't I done enough for you already?
- I was trying to save your life.

346
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,620
Now I'm trying to save yours.

347
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:11,027
I'm sorry.
I know I shouldn't be here,

348
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,067
but Sookie, she's trying
to blame herself for killing Eggs.

349
00:26:15,252 --> 00:26:17,671
We gotta make this right.
We gotta make it right.

350
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:23,478
How about a second lunch?

351
00:26:28,073 --> 00:26:31,380
- Won't he come looking for his clothes?
- I'll bet he'll come looking for more.

352
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,591
I'd feel a lot better
if you let me call Andy.

353
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,844
I've already got somebody on it.
He's a sheriff and a vampire.

354
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,390
Listen, Terry.
You can't tell anyone about this.

355
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:42,883
Help me!

356
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:45,645
This guy is my one shot
at finding Bill.

357
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:50,524
I'm not so good with secrets.
You're a lot better at things

358
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,892
than you give yourself credit for.

359
00:26:53,373 --> 00:26:55,978
I've been out there hollering
for help for 10 minutes.

360
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,416
I didn't hear you.

361
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:59,700
- Let me get that.
- No. I can do it all by myself.

362
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:01,577
Just like I do everything else.

363
00:27:08,638 --> 00:27:11,837
Would you mind telling Arlene
how I'm good at things and all?

364
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:13,078
Sure.

365
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:15,376
But if you want my advice,

366
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:17,176
tell her yourself.

367
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,012
You wait to tell people
how you feel about 'em,

368
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,105
you never know what can happen.

369
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:25,793
Hold up.

370
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,746
- You know how to use one of these?
- I ain't that blond.

371
00:27:39,896 --> 00:27:41,496
I've always liked you,

372
00:27:42,717 --> 00:27:43,717
and...

373
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:46,289
I'd miss you if you got killed.

374
00:27:47,146 --> 00:27:48,624
Just so you know.

375
00:27:59,502 --> 00:28:00,502
I was 16.

376
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:03,435
Your daddy was doing
12 years in prison.

377
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,460
For a crime I didn't commit.

378
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:09,812
Your mama didn't even tell me about you
till after she gave you away.

379
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:14,650
I didn't know what else to do.
The Merlottes seemed like good people.

380
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:17,714
They had money and a big house.

381
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,892
They said
they could give you a better life.

382
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:23,341
Did they?

383
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:26,662
Did you have a good life, Sam?

384
00:28:27,785 --> 00:28:28,914
Till I was 15.

385
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,970
What happened when you were 15?

386
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:39,203
I think y'all know.

387
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,398
Was that the real reason
you gave me away?

388
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:46,390
Because of what I am?

389
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:50,546
I knew there was a chance,
but your daddy's regular.

390
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:52,730
And I prayed
that you'd turn out like him.

391
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:55,024
Why would you pray for that?

392
00:28:57,223 --> 00:28:59,070
What you are is special, son.

393
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:02,269
You got something extra in you.

394
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:05,284
- You should be proud of that.
- Is that right?

395
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,170
Because what being special
has meant to me

396
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:12,611
is walking this world alone,
not knowing what the hell I am,

397
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:14,627
why I am this way.

398
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,550
Joe Lee may be married to a shifter

399
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,310
and raising another,

400
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:27,319
but there ain't no way he can understand
what it's like to be one.

401
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,020
I am so, so sorry
you had to go through that all alone.

402
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:35,541
I am too.

403
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:43,216
What about no one telling me
my whole damn life I had a brother?

404
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,366
Anybody fucking sorry about that?

405
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,399
Boy, don't use that tone with us!

406
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,213
- Calm down.
- Welcome to the family.

407
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:52,167
You can have them.

408
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:04,643
Why didn't you tell me?

409
00:30:05,086 --> 00:30:06,470
She made me promise not to.

410
00:30:06,986 --> 00:30:10,356
- Didn't want nobody seeing her.
- But six months, Lafayette?

411
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:12,976
Alone in this place?
Even she don't deserve that.

412
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:15,972
Right, she don't. You know
how much it costs keeping her here?

413
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:18,838
More than two legal jobs' worth,
that's how much.

414
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:25,937
I mean, the only reason why I'm paying,
because I hate her raggedy ass so much,

415
00:30:26,062 --> 00:30:28,117
I don't wanna take care of her
my goddamn self.

416
00:30:28,554 --> 00:30:30,636
If that were true,
you would've left her to the state,

417
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,371
or on the street
where you found her.

418
00:30:36,452 --> 00:30:37,877
You think I can end up like her.

419
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,049
There's some darkness
in this family.

420
00:30:42,613 --> 00:30:44,637
My mama, your mama.

421
00:30:45,447 --> 00:30:47,470
But they ain't strong enough to beat it.
We are.

422
00:30:48,944 --> 00:30:50,055
We've been fucking

423
00:30:50,804 --> 00:30:54,039
fighting tooth and nail
to survive this bullshit

424
00:30:54,164 --> 00:30:55,627
our whole life,

425
00:30:57,031 --> 00:30:58,772
and I ain't letting you give up now.

426
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:04,396
I get it.

427
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:06,309
You promise?

428
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:11,221
Promise.

429
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,956
Now let's get the fuck up out of here.
It stink in here.

430
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:21,307
But, hooker, if you ever try to pull
the shit you pulled last night again,

431
00:31:21,432 --> 00:31:24,456
I swear, your ass
is gonna get a room next to Ruby Jean.

432
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:26,985
And I'll make sure
the motherfucker spooning your peas

433
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,929
ain't half as hot as Jesus.

434
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,099
- Is you feeling me?
- Yeah, I'm feeling you.

435
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,454
- We clear?
- We clear.

436
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:37,853
We got it. All right, now.
We got it.

437
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:44,579
1958 Plymouth Fury.

438
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:52,284
You know that's the same car
they used in <i>Christine?</i>

439
00:31:55,254 --> 00:31:57,873
- Stephen King? Horror movie?
- Yeah, you think I don't know that?

440
00:32:01,732 --> 00:32:04,065
Probably think I can't even read.

441
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:05,784
I didn't say that.

442
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:09,426
I bet they sent you to one of them
fancy fuck schools, didn't they?

443
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:14,532
I'd give anything to be adopted,

444
00:32:14,657 --> 00:32:17,148
grow up with rich, normal parents
instead of these freaks.

445
00:32:17,273 --> 00:32:18,523
Would you, now?

446
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:21,913
Well, they weren't rich,

447
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,458
and they weren't so normal either.

448
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:27,736
When they saw what I was,
they walked out on me.

449
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,519
So I'm supposed to feel sorry
for you now?

450
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:32,533
At least you had 15 good years.

451
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:35,703
Did you know you were gonna shift?
Did they tell you what to expect?

452
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:40,118
Would've much rather had that
than what I got.

453
00:32:40,243 --> 00:32:44,039
You've known them a couple hours,
and all they did was coo on you and cry.

454
00:32:44,274 --> 00:32:46,046
You got no idea
what you're talking about.

455
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:51,897
Well, I didn't realize this was
a "whose life is more fucked?" contest.

456
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,548
If it means that much to you,
you win.

457
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,285
Look, I got no idea how to deal
with this whole family thing.

458
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,241
Never imagined I had a brother,

459
00:33:06,863 --> 00:33:08,819
something like that
was even possible.

460
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,187
All right, I'm not here
to take anything away from you.

461
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,910
Good,
because I ain't got nothing to take.

462
00:33:27,595 --> 00:33:28,631
I need to run.

463
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,551
- To cool down.
- Care if I join you?

464
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,782
Don't care.

465
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:44,268
I used to get in a lot of fights.

466
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:46,159
After you.

467
00:34:01,258 --> 00:34:02,526
<i>Bon Temps Hardware.</i>

468
00:34:03,002 --> 00:34:04,421
Do you carry chain saws?

469
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:08,207
- Yeah? How much are those, huh?
- <i>Two sixty-eight twenty-two.</i>

470
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:09,378
How much?

471
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:12,196
<i>Two hundred and sixty-eight
dollars and twenty-two cents.</i>

472
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:16,380
- Can I rent one of those for the night?
- <i>Forty-nine ninety-five.</i>

473
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:18,429
- Awesome. Thanks.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

474
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:53,456
Chilled carbonated blood.

475
00:34:54,982 --> 00:34:57,052
It's cruelty-free,
all willingly donated.

476
00:34:57,732 --> 00:34:59,377
Note the citrusy finish.

477
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,563
This one ate only tangerines
for weeks.

478
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:08,253
Mr. Compton,
thank you for joining us.

479
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:11,316
It is an honor
to have you in my kingdom again.

480
00:35:15,942 --> 00:35:17,781
Your Majesty has been
very hospitable.

481
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,568
Perhaps my queen will take
this into consideration

482
00:35:20,693 --> 00:35:22,578
before she has you staked.

483
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:26,633
If staking vampire royalty
were a viable option,

484
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:29,121
trust me,
you would not be sitting here.

485
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:31,071
Why am I?

486
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:36,216
I wanna make you sheriff
of Mississippi Area 2.

487
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,053
The world's only cactus plantation.

488
00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:42,890
You didn't kidnap me
and drag me across state lines

489
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,266
just to offer me a job.

490
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,262
You're too hung up on state lines.

491
00:35:46,387 --> 00:35:48,437
Those lines will soon
cease to exist.

492
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:52,732
You're waging war
against the queen of Louisiana?

493
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:56,017
War?

494
00:35:57,941 --> 00:35:58,864
How barbaric.

495
00:35:59,392 --> 00:36:02,075
Vampire politics
may be medieval, but I'm not.

496
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:03,881
Excuse me, gentlemen.

497
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:06,457
I need to drain the second course.

498
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:11,917
Carlo, bring me that Thai boy.

499
00:36:15,596 --> 00:36:17,446
I mean Sophie Anne no harm.

500
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:22,542
In fact, just the opposite.
I intend to marry her.

501
00:36:26,872 --> 00:36:28,772
For the moment, she says no.

502
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:31,605
But a queen is entitled
to change her mind.

503
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:36,235
And how will you make that happen?

504
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,068
With your help, of course.

505
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,462
<i>Well, that's my job.</i>

506
00:36:44,587 --> 00:36:47,587
<i>I was just doing what I had to
to protect myself,</i>

507
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,127
<i>but I ain't no hero.</i>

508
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:51,895
<i>The citizens of Bon Temps
may beg to differ. </i>

509
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:00,358
TV star.

510
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,637
I mean, detective.
Detective Bellefleur,

511
00:37:04,158 --> 00:37:05,658
you are a real-life,

512
00:37:06,454 --> 00:37:08,004
honest-to-Jesus hero.

513
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,437
You're the wind beneath my wings.

514
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:14,488
Stop it.

515
00:37:17,783 --> 00:37:19,483
You are embarrassing me.

516
00:37:21,537 --> 00:37:23,855
You got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

517
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,038
You shot the bad guy.

518
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:27,719
Right in the head.

519
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,996
Everybody loves you.

520
00:37:32,348 --> 00:37:35,449
What do you want me to do?
Stand up and tell them all the truth?

521
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:39,172
- You'll go to jail.
- Maybe that's where I belong.

522
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:43,381
I keep...

523
00:37:44,643 --> 00:37:46,165
trying to do good all the time,

524
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,501
but all I ever end up doing
is just...

525
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,182
hurting people.

526
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,169
You're a good guy, Stackhouse.

527
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:55,741
You got a lot of heart.

528
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,442
You're prettier than most girls.

529
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,821
If you just applied yourself right,
you could accomplish almost anything.

530
00:38:04,294 --> 00:38:05,490
You really think so?

531
00:38:05,857 --> 00:38:08,108
Why else would I be babysitting
your drunken ass,

532
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:10,495
making sure you don't
piss your entire future away?

533
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,378
I love you, Andy.

534
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:21,336
You're my best friend.

535
00:38:23,226 --> 00:38:24,776
Now, that's just sad.

536
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:42,731
They came for you.

537
00:40:43,155 --> 00:40:45,275
Just one.
This morning.

538
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:47,903
He took off
before I could get anything out of him.

539
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:50,243
That why you're here?

540
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:52,657
Or do you know something about Bill?

541
00:40:54,154 --> 00:40:55,285
I lied to you.

542
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,070
You and Godric were in the SS?

543
00:42:13,686 --> 00:42:15,938
We posed as whatever would
help us in our search.

544
00:42:16,063 --> 00:42:17,993
But you were hunting
the Nazi werewolves?

545
00:42:18,187 --> 00:42:19,687
The symbol is runic.

546
00:42:20,501 --> 00:42:24,290
This... pack dates back
a lot farther than the Nazi Party.

547
00:42:24,565 --> 00:42:26,115
So they aren't Nazis?

548
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:28,736
No, they're much more than that.

549
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,039
These are not ordinary werewolves.

550
00:42:33,188 --> 00:42:36,088
They're organized, well-funded,
highly trained,

551
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:38,763
and fueled by vampire blood.

552
00:42:39,628 --> 00:42:41,683
Why didn't you tell me last night?

553
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,187
The bigger question is why am I
risking everything to tell you now?

554
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,180
My loyalty is not to Bill.

555
00:42:49,473 --> 00:42:51,757
In fact, it would advantageous
for me in numerous ways

556
00:42:51,882 --> 00:42:53,308
if he were never found.

557
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:55,595
But...

558
00:42:59,758 --> 00:43:00,585
But?

559
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:08,386
Now they're coming for you, and...

560
00:43:09,844 --> 00:43:10,670
I owe you.

561
00:43:12,197 --> 00:43:15,091
When you said you were risking
everything to tell me,

562
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:17,427
what did that mean?

563
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,600
The goal was to keep you out of danger,
not put you in more of it.

564
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,004
You can't just say something like that
and then leave.

565
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:29,754
I'm not leaving.

566
00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:32,741
You're going to invite me in

567
00:43:32,866 --> 00:43:34,416
so I can protect you.

568
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,281
Or have passionate primal sex
with you.

569
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:43,237
- How about both?
- You're not gonna distract me

570
00:43:43,362 --> 00:43:44,641
by talking nasty.

571
00:43:44,766 --> 00:43:46,016
I already have.

572
00:43:51,271 --> 00:43:52,796
Are you going to invite me in?

573
00:43:53,271 --> 00:43:54,621
I'm still Bill's.

574
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,760
So you are.

575
00:44:06,403 --> 00:44:09,354
Warm blood bisque
infused with rose petals.

576
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:15,879
There's a lot of natural gas
to be had in Louisiana.

577
00:44:16,152 --> 00:44:17,487
I enjoy the music.

578
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:20,046
Frankly, I've outgrown my sandbox.

579
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,259
Sophie Anne
is a delightful eccentric.

580
00:44:23,384 --> 00:44:25,353
Please, she's as mad
as a monkey on a trike,

581
00:44:25,478 --> 00:44:27,747
- and she has been for centuries.
- Talbot.

582
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:30,292
We don't need to say
everything we think.

583
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:37,028
For a number of reasons, she's incapable
of managing her queendom.

584
00:44:37,153 --> 00:44:39,462
Take you, for example.
She has

585
00:44:39,754 --> 00:44:42,072
She has one of the most promising
young vampires

586
00:44:42,197 --> 00:44:44,146
in the country under her command,

587
00:44:44,408 --> 00:44:45,974
and she sends you to where?

588
00:44:48,473 --> 00:44:50,123
What a waste of talent.

589
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:52,955
She didn't send me to Bon Temps.

590
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:55,828
It was my home before I was made.

591
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,069
After the Great Revelation,
I chose to go there to mainstream.

592
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:02,160
You expect me to believe
she'd allow you to move to a tiny town

593
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:04,927
in the middle of a swamp
and date a waitress?

594
00:45:10,897 --> 00:45:13,543
I know you're still working for her

595
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:16,691
and I know she has secrets,

596
00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:19,829
and I wanna know what they are.

597
00:45:20,743 --> 00:45:23,712
In return,
I'll make you sheriff of Area 2.

598
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,265
Perhaps Your Majesty is using werewolves
to gather his intelligence as well.

599
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:32,888
There's clearly been a mistake.

600
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,438
I am not the vampire
you are looking for.

601
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,790
I am not privy
to the queen's secrets,

602
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:42,011
nor do I have...

603
00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:44,729
any interest in being your sheriff.

604
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:49,486
- I'm sorry to waste your time.
- Poor Sookie.

605
00:45:50,472 --> 00:45:53,958
Such a shame she has to pay
the price for your stubbornness.

606
00:45:54,829 --> 00:45:56,169
You leave Sookie out of this.

607
00:45:57,102 --> 00:45:59,202
You're in my house, Mr. Compton.

608
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:01,431
Put your fangs away.

609
00:46:08,973 --> 00:46:11,069
I'm sorry if it's hard on you
being here,

610
00:46:11,864 --> 00:46:15,403
but I gotta work,
and I am not leaving you alone.

611
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:18,223
It's hard being anywhere right now.

612
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:20,261
Might as well be here.

613
00:46:21,983 --> 00:46:22,983
Love you.

614
00:46:30,681 --> 00:46:32,414
How long you been standing there?

615
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:33,806
Little while.

616
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:34,931
You sick?

617
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:37,877
Because of my shrimp again?
Good.

618
00:46:39,623 --> 00:46:40,542
Now,

619
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:43,633
I know Coby and Lisa
are part of you,

620
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:46,386
and maybe you think I'm not
the kind of person you want around them.

621
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:50,682
But I made a list.

622
00:46:51,704 --> 00:46:52,976
A list of what?

623
00:46:54,051 --> 00:46:56,229
Ten reasons why you can
trust me with your kids.

624
00:46:57,499 --> 00:46:58,549
Number one:

625
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:01,162
I'm a nurturer.

626
00:47:01,997 --> 00:47:04,114
I found a baby armadillo
by the side of the road

627
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:05,489
and I nursed it.

628
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,378
Now it sleeps under my bed,

629
00:47:07,614 --> 00:47:08,825
and its name is Felix.

630
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:11,797
Number two:

631
00:47:12,322 --> 00:47:14,684
I have a diploma
from anger management,

632
00:47:15,056 --> 00:47:17,876
where I learned talking
about your feelings is the thing to do.

633
00:47:19,556 --> 00:47:20,806
Number three...

634
00:47:30,057 --> 00:47:31,207
Number three:

635
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:34,405
I never killed nothing by accident.

636
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,520
Number 4...

637
00:47:52,129 --> 00:47:53,179
Busy night?

638
00:47:55,488 --> 00:47:56,706
You the only waitress?

639
00:47:57,628 --> 00:48:00,084
Actually, I'm a bartender,
and I ain't working tonight.

640
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:03,169
- Then what are you doing here?
- Honestly?

641
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,560
Trying not to kill myself.

642
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,344
And how is that going for you?

643
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:13,010
I'm still alive.

644
00:48:13,819 --> 00:48:15,119
Makes one of us.

645
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,561
You got any of those Tru Bloods?

646
00:48:21,515 --> 00:48:24,815
We only got the B-positive,
and the microwave's busted.

647
00:48:26,572 --> 00:48:28,196
You a friend of Bill Compton's?

648
00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:31,533
You?

649
00:48:32,238 --> 00:48:33,288
Not really.

650
00:49:03,564 --> 00:49:04,524
What the fuck?

651
00:49:08,036 --> 00:49:09,036
Holy shit.

652
00:49:16,112 --> 00:49:17,112
Fuck.

653
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,294
Andy, I'm telling you, I can
walk in a straight line. Look.

654
00:49:21,419 --> 00:49:22,969
Like a fucking arrow.

655
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:25,366
I ain't letting you drive like that.

656
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:31,280
- Get in.
- Well, this is fun.

657
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:39,990
I ain't never been
in the front seat before.

658
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:48,318
<i>Detective Bellefleur,
we've got a 586 in progress in Hotshot.</i>

659
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:53,555
Rosie, you realize a 586
means illegal parking? Over.

660
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:57,656
<i>I could have sworn
that's what Kenya said. </i>

661
00:49:57,781 --> 00:50:01,116
<i>Anyway, they're busting a meth lab,
whatever the code is for that.</i>

662
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:02,241
<i>Over.</i>

663
00:50:04,656 --> 00:50:06,106
Wanna take a drive?

664
00:50:09,096 --> 00:50:10,658
I ain't never been to Hotshot.

665
00:50:10,783 --> 00:50:12,683
Nothing to write home about.

666
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,589
You ain't even on duty.
What are you doing here?

667
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:24,762
But more importantly,
what is Jason Stackhouse doing here?

668
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:26,521
- Take two, one...
- Stop it.

669
00:50:27,538 --> 00:50:28,940
You stay in the car.

670
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:30,515
Staying in the car.

671
00:50:32,373 --> 00:50:34,023
This is my town, Kenya.

672
00:50:35,601 --> 00:50:37,621
And whatever happens in my town

673
00:50:38,964 --> 00:50:39,869
concerns me.

674
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:41,815
Quit speechifying.

675
00:50:42,301 --> 00:50:44,529
There ain't no cameras here,
you damn fool.

676
00:50:44,654 --> 00:50:47,254
You sure did sound smart
on the TV, Andy.

677
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:49,982
There a problem here, officers?

678
00:50:50,107 --> 00:50:52,548
Calvin Norris, we got a warrant
to search your property.

679
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,230
What for?

680
00:50:57,106 --> 00:50:59,610
- Get off my land, you fucking pigs!
- Stand back, sir.

681
00:50:59,735 --> 00:51:03,017
Don't tell me what to do.
You got no right to be here.

682
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:05,547
- Calm down, Mr. Norris.
- Fuck you.

683
00:51:05,672 --> 00:51:08,484
I'm an officer of the law,
and you are not allowed to say that

684
00:51:08,609 --> 00:51:10,236
to an officer of the law.

685
00:51:10,361 --> 00:51:11,611
That's the law.

686
00:51:14,259 --> 00:51:16,500
In there. Inside. I see him.

687
00:51:28,231 --> 00:51:29,252
Are you all right?

688
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:45,476
Goddamn it, stop!

689
00:51:55,638 --> 00:51:57,947
Sheriff's Department.
Stop!

690
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:02,493
I got one.

691
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:05,621
I got me a drug dealer.

692
00:52:16,314 --> 00:52:17,314
Big night.

693
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:31,187
Just ride on that shit.
Fuck that shit.

694
00:52:31,312 --> 00:52:34,628
I'll ride that shit like a pony.
This is where it happened, dude.

695
00:52:34,753 --> 00:52:37,555
Andy put that serial-killer
nigger down right here.

696
00:52:47,648 --> 00:52:49,582
Shit. It's the freak's girlfriend.

697
00:52:49,864 --> 00:52:51,959
His name was Eggs,
you racist piece of shit.

698
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,892
You're the one who went
and fucked a killer, bitch.

699
00:52:59,197 --> 00:53:00,593
Apologize to the lady.

700
00:53:01,322 --> 00:53:04,931
Serial killer weren't enough for you?
You gotta go fuck a goddamn vamper too?

701
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:08,329
I said,

702
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:12,046
apologize to the lady.

703
00:53:12,931 --> 00:53:14,124
Fuck you.

704
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:28,151
Blood gelato.

705
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:34,210
Sookie has nothing to do with this.
She's innocent.

706
00:53:34,705 --> 00:53:37,630
We know that you love her,
that you've killed for her.

707
00:53:38,832 --> 00:53:41,120
And from the look in your eye,
I can see you'd do it again

708
00:53:41,245 --> 00:53:43,119
if you thought that would save her.

709
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,530
So romantic.

710
00:53:46,398 --> 00:53:47,798
It's not romantic,

711
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:49,642
it's delusional.

712
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,666
Lorena.

713
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:53,841
Oh, goodie.

714
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,941
I'm just in time for dessert.

715
00:54:11,733 --> 00:54:13,233
To have and to hold,

716
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:16,421
to love and to cherish,

717
00:54:17,152 --> 00:54:20,580
to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
until death do you part.

718
00:54:21,587 --> 00:54:23,894
Doesn't bother you that you'll
be the only one dying?

719
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:26,008
I'm not gonna talk about this
with you.

720
00:54:29,236 --> 00:54:32,213
So you'd really rather stay out here
all night than invite me in?

721
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:35,643
One minute you lie to me,
the next minute you ask me to trust you.

722
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,740
You do something generous
and selfless,

723
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:42,612
and then you follow that up
with something nasty

724
00:54:43,102 --> 00:54:44,552
or downright cruel.

725
00:54:48,426 --> 00:54:49,387
Invite me in.

726
00:54:49,512 --> 00:54:52,762
- You can't bully your way into...
- Invite me in now.

727
00:54:53,172 --> 00:54:55,416
Mr. Northman,
will you please come in?
