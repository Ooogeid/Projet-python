1
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:05,636
Help!

2
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:07,339
Someone, please!

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,025
Sweetie.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,852
What did you get yourself into?

5
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:29,436
My God, Jason.

6
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:31,951
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:34,537
It's okay.

8
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:37,264
Like hell it is! Look at her.
She is definitely not.

9
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:39,794
Bangin' on me ain't gonna
change anything none.

10
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,574
Darling, I heard yelling.

11
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:46,584
Sweet Lord in heaven.

12
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,688
What did you do?

13
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,763
- Me?
- I found her, Miss Lefebvre. He...

14
00:01:01,068 --> 00:01:03,608
- He just got here.
- I saw you last night.

15
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:06,319
I heard you all fighting,
then she took a shot at you,

16
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,613
and you ran off.
And now she's dead.

17
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,073
We had a fight.

18
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,531
But I came here to apologize.

19
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:18,687
She fired a gun at you,
and you come back to apologize?

20
00:01:19,284 --> 00:01:20,576
I didn't do this.

21
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:24,671
- You gotta believe me.
- Well, I'm calling the police.

22
00:01:25,382 --> 00:01:26,521
Then call 'em!

23
00:01:29,343 --> 00:01:31,198
I had nothing to do with this.

00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,980

27
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:16,540
I don't get it.

28
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:19,732
She was so pretty.

29
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,442
Well, maybe...
it was just her time.

30
00:03:24,768 --> 00:03:26,584
She was only 23 years old.

31
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:29,295
Ain't no 23-year-old in the world
whose time has come.

32
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:31,583
Hey, y'all. What'd I miss?

33
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,134
Dawn's dead, Mama.

34
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:37,341
I know. What a shame.

35
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,556
Who they got in there?

36
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:41,586
Jason and Sookie Stackhouse.

37
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:45,009
She found the body, but it sounds like
they think he might have done it.

38
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,184
He didn't.

39
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:48,273
- Then who did?
- I don't know.

40
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,398
Probably the same person
that killed Maudette.

41
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:53,361
I tell you one thing, man.
We're too small

42
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:56,245
a town to be losing girls
one after the other like this.

43
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:59,326
Whoever it is,
I hope they fry the fuck.

44
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,384
- Pardon my language, Miss Maxine.
- No need to apologize.

45
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,912
We're all excited.

46
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:12,463
To be a fly on the wall
in that apartment right now.

47
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:19,554
Now, I realize you've been
through a lot. And you're scared.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,970
But I need you to try
and remember when you got here.

49
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:25,557
Was the door open
or just unlocked?

50
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:29,230
Open, I think.

51
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:35,310
<i>It pisses me off the way
she calls me "Andy,"</i>

52
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,641
<i>everyone calls Bud "sheriff. "
Why can't they call me</i>

53
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:40,821
<i>"detective," goddamn it? When am I
gonna get some respect around here?</i>

54
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:44,726
<i>Would you look at that?
A fine pair of perfect, natural breasts.</i>

55
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:46,711
<i>I'd have laid down money
that they were fake.</i>

56
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:48,224
<i>Well done, God.</i>

57
00:04:48,344 --> 00:04:51,419
<i>Now and then, not so well done,
letting her die like you did.</i>

58
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,172
<i>Fuck. Fuck.</i>

59
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:56,213
<i>Fuck am I gonna do?
I already got out of this once.</i>

60
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,901
<i>No way they gonna let me walk again.</i>

61
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:00,717
<i>And I'm too damned pretty
to go to prison.</i>

62
00:05:01,737 --> 00:05:03,616
Sorry... What was the question?

63
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,163
Is that the exact position
you found her in?

64
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:08,145
I covered her up with a sheet, but

65
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:10,818
- but I don't think I touched her.
- I wish you hadn't have done that.

66
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:13,920
Next time I find a friend dead,
I'll try to remember that.

67
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:16,706
I keep waiting for this heat to break,
but it won't.

68
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:18,977
It's the stubbornest
summer we're having.

69
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:20,684
Oh, I know.

70
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:24,705
I feel like a cat on a hot tin roof.

71
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,497
That's from a play.

72
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:32,978
I sure could use a beer right now, me.
Y'all want some?

73
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,059
- If you're getting one.
- Bring me one.

74
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:37,758
While you're in there,
would you rustle up a bucket of ice?

75
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,959
And some of those nice
plastic cups we got

76
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,095
at the Super Save a Bunch
last weekend.

77
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:44,075
And maybe some paper doilies.

78
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:46,284
Lord, woman, what's with you
and them doilies?

79
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:48,267
Doilies are to protect the table.
We outside.

80
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:50,972
They might wanna put 'em down
on the car or something.

81
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:53,061
Just bring the doilies,
please.

82
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,482
Fine.

83
00:05:55,893 --> 00:05:58,516
If all our conversations end
with them saying "fine,"

84
00:05:58,636 --> 00:06:01,016
why do they bother
putting up a fight?

85
00:06:02,608 --> 00:06:04,704
So this fight you heard
Dawn and Jason having,

86
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:07,340
- were you able to make any of it out?
- Just the tail end,

87
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,925
right before the gunshot.
He called her...

88
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,570
a very bad word.

89
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,057
And what was that word?

90
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,342
It starts with a "B".

91
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,613
I see.

92
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:30,625
That'll be all.
Thank you, Miss Lefebvre.

93
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:32,704
You're welcome, Andy, dear.

94
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:06,054
You gonna make me wait in the car,
can you at least turn on the A.C.?

95
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:08,182
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

96
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,574
Fuck.

97
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:21,481
Fuck.

98
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,650
Couldn't hear me yelling?
Car's hotter than hell.

99
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:47,136
Shut up.

100
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:55,035
Thank you, Sookie.

101
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:58,287
- We'll be in touch.
- Let's roll before I melt in here.

102
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:02,193
Stop. Mama,
I don't need any sunblock.

103
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:04,783
Please, Hoyt,
if anyone needs sunblock, it's you.

104
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:07,032
Your skin's whiter than Desitin.

105
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:10,731
Mama, I'm gonna move out.
I swear it, I will.

106
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:13,517
You won't. Now get down
so I can get your neck.

107
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:27,346
Came as soon as I heard.

108
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:40,654
I'm sorry you had to be
the one to find her.

109
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:43,695
He was gonna be somebody.
Right?

110
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:46,672
I guess.

111
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:51,462
I tell you, Sook,

112
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,652
sometimes I don't even recognize
this world we're living in.

113
00:08:57,992 --> 00:09:00,293
- I mean, goddamn it.
- Be careful, now.

114
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:02,900
God didn't do this.

115
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:10,397
You think maybe I should
shut down the bar for the day?

116
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:12,996
All that'd do is deny people
a good, stiff drink

117
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:15,641
- on the day they could use it the most.
- Yeah, but...

118
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:17,977
I know it's supposed
to be my day off and all,

119
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:21,762
but the last thing I need right now
is time alone with my thoughts.

120
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:24,918
All right, then.

121
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:26,767
We'll open.

122
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:31,407
I may be late, though. I gotta swing
by home and tell Gran what's going on.

123
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:33,752
That was le Bon Temps,
she already knows

124
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:34,785
Still...

125
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:40,587
- with Jason and everything-
- Excuse me, are you Mr. Merlotte?

126
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:43,544
Detective in charge
tells me you're the landlord.

127
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,166
- That's right.
- We need to get in the victim's storage

128
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,780
unit, but we don't have a key.
If you could find one,

129
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,083
it'd be a big help right about now.

130
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,139
Miss?

131
00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:00,076
Could you please let us by?

132
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:11,488
Neil Jones, my new apprentice.
He's from Kentucky.

133
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:18,380
Lift, kid. Come on, lift.

134
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:22,041
You don't have to be too careful.

135
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:23,559
Ain't gonna hurt her.

136
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:35,560
So you had a fight,

137
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:37,598
she took a shot at you with a gun,

138
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:39,480
and you just left?

139
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:42,586
Didn't see her again till you
showed up with booze and flowers

140
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:44,990
- and found her dead this morning?
- That's my story,

141
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,315
it ain't gonna change.

142
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,567
Except it just did change.

143
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:52,321
You just admitted you're the one
who found her, not Sookie.

144
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:55,065
I didn't.

145
00:10:56,815 --> 00:10:59,945
You're trying to trick me.
It don't count if I get tricked.

146
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:02,331
Does it?

147
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:05,311
Make you hot?

148
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:08,244
Killing girls
and sticking it to 'em?

149
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,985
See, I think it does.

150
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:13,092
I think it turns you on.

151
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,344
Sounds to me like it turns you on.

152
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:22,553
Tell me, is that how you do it?
Kill 'em then fuck 'em?

153
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,148
Or do you fuck 'em
and then kill 'em?

154
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:26,627
Or I know.

155
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:28,528
You strangle 'em

156
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:32,324
as you're fucking 'em,
don't you, you sick fuck?

157
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:36,240
How many other women you done this
to besides Dawn and Maudette?

158
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,366
I didn't...

159
00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:43,706
Gotta use the bathroom.

160
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,581
Man's gotta pee, Andy.

161
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:51,918
- Bathroom? Bathroom?
- It's over there.

162
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:16,950
Son of a bitch.

163
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:19,492
You shouldn't have laughed.

164
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:21,336
What are you talking about?

165
00:12:22,018 --> 00:12:24,781
When he came back at me with that crack
about me being the one getting

166
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,832
turned on,
you shouldn't have laughed.

167
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,466
I guess it just struck me as funny,
'cause you were working so hard on him,

168
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,145
and I don't think he did it.

169
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,116
What the fuck?

170
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:40,740
Bud, we got two dead girls,

171
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,003
and this dumbfuck admits
to sleeping with both of 'em

172
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:45,797
- within hours before they were killed.
- Yeah, and both

173
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,431
our dead girls got bit
by vampires too.

174
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:51,690
Far as I can tell,
Stackhouse don't have fangs.

175
00:13:11,996 --> 00:13:14,358
<i>What the hell you doing in there?</i>

176
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:17,677
I'll be out in a minute.

177
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,094
What the fuck was that?

178
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:28,084
Fuck, you gotta be shitting me.

179
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:44,309
<i>I said, hold on. I'll be there.</i>

180
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:50,416
- I hear you guys brought Jason in.
- So?

181
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,533
- You charging him with anything?
- Not yet.

182
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:54,131
Asking him some questions.

183
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,764
I assume he's been
properly Mirandized, then.

184
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:02,783
Tell me you informed him he has a right
to have an attorney present.

185
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:06,315
Maybe. Doesn't matter though,
'cause he's got you here now.

186
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:10,186
Is that funny 'cause I'm a woman
or 'cause I'm a black woman?

187
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:12,775
I thought it was funny, you know,
just 'cause

188
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:15,400
you talk like a lawyer
but you ain't one.

189
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:19,399
How do you know all this anyway?
You been taking night classes?

190
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,390
School is just for white people looking
for other white people to read to 'em.

191
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,046
I figure I save my money
and read to myself.

192
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:31,303
I'm gettin' you out of here.

193
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,326
- Like hell you are.
- You charging him with anything?

194
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:35,883
She's right.

195
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:38,051
We can't hold him.

196
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:41,967
He can't say where he was last night.
At least could done make some shit up.

197
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:45,596
Listen, I told you where I was.
I was... home alone. Sleeping.

198
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:48,054
You never sleep alone, Stackhouse,
and you know it...

199
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:49,562
Guys, he was with me.

200
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:51,135
What's this, now?

201
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,827
If y'all were together last night,
how come he don't seem to know it?

202
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:57,254
Because I asked him not
to tell anybody about us.

203
00:14:57,374 --> 00:15:00,079
And he's just surprised to hear me
being the one blabbin' about it.

204
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,444
Aren't you, baby?

205
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:06,728
Wha...

206
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:08,122
You buying this?

207
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:11,128
People think just because
we got vampires out in the open now race

208
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:13,196
isn't the issue no more.
But you ever see the way

209
00:15:13,316 --> 00:15:15,248
folks look at mixed
couples in this town?

210
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:17,508
Race may not be the
hot-button issue it once was,

211
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:19,547
but it's still a button
you can push on people.

212
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:21,883
Would you be willing
to go on record with this?

213
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:24,343
- You're lying, you'd be guilty...
- Perjury.

214
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:25,555
I know.

215
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,477
You got a Bible,
I'll swear on it right here.

216
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:32,051
Jason and I were together last night
and it was a beautiful thing.

217
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:40,263
You're free to go.

218
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:41,906
Jesus.

219
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:45,555
- Come on, baby. Let's take you home.
- Okay, baby.

220
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,686
Hey, Gran.

221
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,419
- I heard.
- About Jason too?

222
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:01,755
He didn't do it, you know.

223
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,094
- I know.
- Jason may be many things,

224
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,903
but he's not a murderer.

225
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:08,561
I know...

226
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:10,139
The thing is though,

227
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:12,361
in all the years
that I've lived in Bon Temps,

228
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:13,919
I can't recall but...

229
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:17,722
two, maybe three murders.
And now there are two in one week.

230
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,863
People are not gonna stand for it.

231
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:24,045
If the police can't find the person
who did it, they're gonna find Jason.

232
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,722
- He needs your help.
- Gran, how am I supposed to...

233
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:29,924
You use the gift God gave you.
Listen in on people,

234
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:32,815
keep your ears open.
You're bound to hear something.

235
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:36,248
- It's got nothing to do with my ears.
- Whatever it is you use to listen,

236
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:37,417
use it.

237
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:39,705
He is your brother,
Sookie.

238
00:16:45,774 --> 00:16:46,971
Good girl.

239
00:16:59,805 --> 00:17:01,883
<i>Come and pick up
your fucking orders...</i>

240
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:06,649
<i>Who killed Dawn? I wonder
if he had sex with her or not.</i>

241
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:08,516
<i>Seems like a waste if he didn't.</i>

242
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,574
<i>She sure was pretty.
Never even looked at me.</i>

243
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:12,857
<i>Can't get that letter
in Cosmo out of my head.</i>

244
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:15,657
<i>How much better could
an orgasm with a vampire be?</i>

245
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:17,915
<i>I wonder,
is it that much better?</i>

246
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:21,511
<i>What the hell is this world coming to?
Dead fucks, niggers </i>

247
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:24,680
<i>and regular folk all livin' together.
If God wanted it like this,</i>

248
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,710
<i>he'd have made us look the same.
It ain't good. Maybe these really </i>

249
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,386
<i>- are the end times.</i>
<i>- What everybody's upset about?</i>

250
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:32,711
<i>These whores had it coming,
hanging out in vampire bars.</i>

251
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:34,556
<i>That ain't natural,
and it ain't safe.</i>

252
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:38,288
<i>You seem sad that girl is dead.
I wonder if y'all were friends.</i>

253
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:40,604
<i>And if you were, that means
you're probably next.</i>

254
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:43,866
<i>Fucking fang-bangers, crazy,</i>
<i>every last one of you.</i>

255
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:47,167
<i>Just like those women who write
love letters to serial killers...</i>

256
00:17:47,518 --> 00:17:49,983
I asked for ranch dressing
with these fries.

257
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,441
Two margaritas.

258
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,865
That Dawn sure left us
high and dry, didn't she?

259
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:58,792
It's not like
she meant not to be here.

260
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,933
I know, but if she didn't
spend her nights off

261
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:04,837
at that vamp bar in Shreveport,
she still would be.

262
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:09,550
Did I just hear you right?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

263
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,428
Please. Ain't there even a part of
you think she had it coming?

264
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:14,188
No, not a single part.

265
00:18:14,756 --> 00:18:16,665
And I'm taking your ranch.

266
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:21,708
- You're late.
- Sorry, boss.

267
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:30,512
Listen, we should probably talk.

268
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:33,868
About last night?

269
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,209
What about last night?

270
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,186
You're gonna make this
hard on me, aren't you?

271
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:41,729
Actually, no, I'm gonna
make it very, very easy.

272
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:43,861
Nothing happened
between us last night.

273
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:46,920
And if anybody asks,
you didn't see me at all, okay?

274
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,446
I'm telling people I spent
the night with Jason.

275
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:51,842
- Jason Stackhouse?
- Yes.

276
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:54,254
I was with Jason last night.
And if you say different,

277
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:56,812
they're gonna haul
both our asses into jail.

278
00:18:57,246 --> 00:18:58,766
You lied to the police for him?

279
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,226
Shit, Tara.

280
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:05,306
I know you carry a torch for the guy,
but... I don't get it, I really don't.

281
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:07,462
There's more to Jason
than meets than eye.

282
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:09,672
Deep down he is a very good person.

283
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:32,917
Fuck!

284
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:37,525
Go fucking down.

285
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:50,356
Come on.

286
00:19:53,747 --> 00:19:56,740
<i>In Iraq today,
10 U.S. Marines were killed...</i>

287
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,974
Motherfucker.

288
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:13,151
Oh, baby.

289
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,594
My sweet, sweet baby.

290
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:24,977
<i>Sure is too bad about Dawn.</i>

291
00:20:25,438 --> 00:20:28,959
<i>I already miss the way her butt used
to hang out of the bottom of her shorts.</i>

292
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,568
<i>Sookie Stackhouse.
I hope that brother of yours gets</i>

293
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:34,862
<i>what he deserves and
he fries for what he's done.</i>

294
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:37,952
<i>- They were trash.
- Crying shame is what it is.</i>

295
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:40,407
<i>This place ain't gonna
be the same without Dawn.</i>

296
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:42,908
<i>She had the prettiest, nicest smile.</i>

297
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:44,954
<i>Why was I so scared to talk to her?</i>

298
00:20:45,074 --> 00:20:46,880
<i>I'll neve know
what her voice sounded like.</i>

299
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,473
<i>I bet it sounded like angels
and parakeets mixed together.</i>

300
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:52,238
Quit flirting, Barry.

301
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,934
I just wanted to say thank you.

302
00:20:57,744 --> 00:20:58,754
For...

303
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,220
For what?

304
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:08,562
All right then.

305
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:14,735
Jason, you look me in the eye
and you tell me the truth.

306
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:16,028
Did you kill Dawn?

307
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:17,961
What? No.

308
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:20,407
Jesus, Sook.

309
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:25,996
Look, when Maudette died,
I thought I might've done it.

310
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:27,998
And it turned out I didn't.
With Dawn,

311
00:21:28,158 --> 00:21:30,422
I don't even think I might've done it,
so I know I didn't.

312
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:31,586
You swear?

313
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,797
But the way you're acting,
seems like you want it to be me.

314
00:21:35,957 --> 00:21:37,943
Sorry. Gran asked me
to listen in on folks,

315
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,830
see if I can't clear your name.

316
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,721
And sometimes it's hard...

317
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:44,581
I gotta stop you, because it sounds like
you're reving up for a long one.

318
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:46,529
And I really need to see LaFayette.

319
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:48,220
Talk to you later.

320
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:55,317
- What the fuck, LaFayette?
- I'm busy. What's your problem?

321
00:21:55,477 --> 00:21:57,319
My problem is my dick.

322
00:21:57,986 --> 00:21:59,803
It's been hard since 3:00.

323
00:21:59,923 --> 00:22:02,741
- Something went wrong with that vamp...
- Will you shut the fuck up?

324
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,749
- Sorry.
- It's your loud ass.

325
00:22:05,977 --> 00:22:08,572
And ain't nothing wrong
with the shit I sold you.

326
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:09,957
What the hell is it?

327
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,109
How much you take?

328
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:13,788
The whole thing.

329
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:18,895
You took the whole thing?

330
00:22:19,935 --> 00:22:22,669
You a dizzy motherfucker.
I said one drop,

331
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:25,219
two max,
and you took the whole thing?

332
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:29,127
I was in the backseat of a cop car,
I had it on me, and I panicked, okay?

333
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:32,322
Now, just give me something to make it
go away, I don't care what it costs.

334
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:34,718
Ain't no antidote to V, boyfriend.

335
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:41,146
When my grandpa was alive,

336
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:43,714
he had gout.

337
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,850
And he said just
the weight of a sheet

338
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,516
on his big toe
was too much to bear.

339
00:22:51,184 --> 00:22:54,108
So help me God, that's exactly
what this feels like.

340
00:22:55,294 --> 00:22:57,738
Maybe you should
try rubbing one out.

341
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,090
Were you listening to me?

342
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:02,714
I got gout of the dick!

343
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:09,538
Vampires.

344
00:23:21,186 --> 00:23:22,607
Any fries for you?

345
00:23:29,706 --> 00:23:30,662
What you want?

346
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:33,851
May I have a bottle
of O negative, please?

347
00:23:35,243 --> 00:23:36,668
A negative's all we got.

348
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:38,378
A negative then.

349
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:42,447
Pretty crowded in here tonight.
Something going on?

350
00:23:46,282 --> 00:23:47,772
Sam just bought a case.

351
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:49,941
We got O neg and A neg.
Plenty of each.

352
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,267
Fuck him.
I'm giving him A.

353
00:23:52,427 --> 00:23:54,728
And don't microwave it neither.
He can have it cold.

354
00:23:55,073 --> 00:23:56,377
You are so bad.

355
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:06,740
Are we out of O?

356
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,569
Blood is blood.
What difference does it make?

357
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:11,066
He prefers O.

358
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:15,864
- I'll take it to him if you like.
- Good. He gives me the creeps.

359
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:24,685
Come on.

360
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:26,153
Where are we going?

361
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:35,654
You know my friend
who works here?

362
00:24:36,216 --> 00:24:37,846
Someone killed her last night.

363
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:39,161
How?

364
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:41,460
- Say you're sorry.
- Excuse me?

365
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,419
You wanna learn to fit in with people?
You gotta say you're sorry.

366
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:47,581
You don't even have to mean it.
Lord knows they don't most of the time.

367
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:49,265
I am sorry.

368
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:51,095
Thank you.

369
00:24:51,215 --> 00:24:53,718
Anyway, I'm the one who found her.
Strangled.

370
00:24:54,164 --> 00:24:56,491
- Cops think it was my brother.
- Was it?

371
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,834
No, he's not capable of it.

372
00:24:59,506 --> 00:25:02,107
I've been around long enough to know
just about anyone is capable

373
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:04,623
- of just about anything.
- He didn't do it.

374
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:08,449
So I listened
in on people's thoughts,

375
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:10,436
hoping I might hear
something to clear him.

376
00:25:10,556 --> 00:25:12,354
And apparently
there's this vampire bar

377
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:15,346
where Maudette and Dawn used
to hang out at in Shreveport.

378
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,584
You know it?

379
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:18,359
Fangtasia.

380
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,376
Fangtasia?

381
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,756
You have to remember that
most vampires are very old.

382
00:25:24,944 --> 00:25:27,070
Puns used to be
the highest form of humor.

383
00:25:29,448 --> 00:25:31,859
Well, I was thinking
if I went there

384
00:25:31,979 --> 00:25:34,007
I could do
some sniffing around.

385
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:36,329
You think maybe
you could take me?

386
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:38,871
How about tonight?

387
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:41,837
The sooner the better.
I just gotta tell Sam I'm leaving,

388
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,309
- then run home and change.
- Meet you there.

389
00:25:44,706 --> 00:25:45,645
Thank you.

390
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:51,178
I'm asking you this as a friend, okay?
This is not a date.

391
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:52,693
Fine.

392
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:57,682
- It's not a date. I'm serious.
- As am I.

393
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:13,764
Is it all right if I take
the rest of the night off?

394
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:15,493
Why?

395
00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:19,567
I need to go to that vampire bar
in Shreveport so I can snoop around

396
00:26:19,687 --> 00:26:21,750
and see if I can clear
my brother's name,

397
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:25,261
and Mr. Compton was kind enough
to agree to take me.

398
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,842
Oh, Jesus. Sookie, you gonna
get yourself killed,

399
00:26:31,002 --> 00:26:32,900
- you know that?
- I'll be fine.

400
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:34,215
Baby,

401
00:26:34,432 --> 00:26:36,094
the fact that you think
you'll be fine,

402
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:38,212
only proves just how not fine
you're gonna be.

403
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:39,851
Vampires think about one thing,

404
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,584
and one thing only:

405
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:44,949
drinking your blood.

406
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:46,616
Like humans aren't bloodthirsty?

407
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:49,243
People want to see my brother
hang for a crime he didn't commit.

408
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:50,570
Is that what you want?

409
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,885
- I'm not saying don't help him.
- Frankly, I'm surprised at you.

410
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:55,992
I thought you were for the VRA.

411
00:26:56,152 --> 00:26:59,216
I think they should have their own bars.
I just don't think people

412
00:26:59,336 --> 00:27:01,753
- ought to go there.
- Separate but equal?

413
00:27:01,873 --> 00:27:04,823
I don't give a shit about equal.
We can give them more than we got.

414
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:08,468
- Just so long as everything's separate.
- Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

415
00:27:08,772 --> 00:27:09,467
But

416
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:11,094
But I'm going.

417
00:27:13,902 --> 00:27:15,053
I can't stop you.

418
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:17,688
You can't.

419
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,182
Penny for your thoughts.

420
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:45,497
I thought you liked
not knowing my thoughts.

421
00:27:45,617 --> 00:27:47,123
Most of the time I do.

422
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:50,971
You won't care for it.

423
00:27:51,565 --> 00:27:53,505
That doesn't mean
I don't wanna know.

424
00:27:58,488 --> 00:28:00,140
You look like vampire bait.

425
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:02,414
What's that supposed to mean?

426
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:06,486
I promised your grandmother no harm

427
00:28:06,606 --> 00:28:08,886
would come to you
at Fangtasia tonight.

428
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:12,190
I'm not sure I'm gonna be able
to keep that promise

429
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,700
with you dressed like this.

430
00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:18,233
So are you saying
you think I look nice?

431
00:28:19,943 --> 00:28:21,536
Doesn't matter what I think.

432
00:28:21,886 --> 00:28:23,497
This isn't a date, remember?

433
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:38,511
This ain't a part of my job description,
goddamn it.

434
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:40,051
Don't turn around!

435
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:40,901
What?

436
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:45,101
- I said don't look at me.
- What the hell are you doing?

437
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:49,636
I think I might've OD'd.

438
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:51,934
Oh, my God. On what?

439
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:55,487
V.

440
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:57,405
You're doing V now?

441
00:28:58,268 --> 00:28:59,681
It was my first time.

442
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:02,211
Where on earth did you
come across V in this town?

443
00:29:04,752 --> 00:29:06,894
My cousin is dealing
vampire blood now?

444
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:09,219
Goddamn idiot.

445
00:29:10,218 --> 00:29:12,349
Least that explains
why I walked in on you

446
00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:15,848
dancing around in that
Laura Bush mask yesterday.

447
00:29:16,184 --> 00:29:18,061
Because I gotta tell you,
without a reason,

448
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:19,511
that was some fucked up shit.

449
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,066
All right, let me see it.

450
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:27,102
How long have you had
the erection?

451
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:29,938
- Well, how do you know?
- I read.

452
00:29:30,264 --> 00:29:32,937
You're not the first vain-ass,
body-conscious ex-jock

453
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:35,777
to overdo the V and wind up
with an acute case of priapism.

454
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,544
- Pa what?
- Priapism.

455
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:40,532
Now lift the ribeye and let me see
what we're dealing with.

456
00:29:48,314 --> 00:29:50,142
Oh, Jason, that's...

457
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,293
Yeah, it's bad, ain't it?

458
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:54,421
Sweetie, we gotta get you
to a hospital now.

459
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:58,633
- No hospitals. No way.
- Do you want to keep your dick or not?

460
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:22,142
I haven't seen you in a while.

461
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:23,570
I'm mainstreaming.

462
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,577
Good for you. Who's the doll?

463
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:27,771
Pam, this is Sookie.
Sookie, this is Pam.

464
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:29,136
Pleased to meet you.

465
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,586
Can I see your ID?

466
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,109
Sure.

467
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:39,632
How funny. Who'd have thought?
Getting carded at a vampire bar.

468
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:43,178
I can no longer tell human ages.

469
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:45,555
We must be careful
we serve no minors

470
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:48,085
in any capacity.

471
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:51,993
Twenty-five, huh?

472
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:54,741
How sweet it is.

473
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:07,565
This feels a little bit like
what a vampire bar would look like

474
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:10,235
if it were a...
A ride at Disneyworld.

475
00:31:10,355 --> 00:31:12,120
Don't get too comfortable.

476
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,418
It tends to get more authentic
as the night wears on.

477
00:31:20,014 --> 00:31:21,685
Can I get you something to drink?

478
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:24,192
Please.

479
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:31,931
How's it going, Bill?

480
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:34,793
Very well.

481
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:37,418
I'll say it is.
This your meal for tonight?

482
00:31:38,184 --> 00:31:40,751
This is my friend Sookie.
Sookie, Longshadow.

483
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:42,187
Nice to meet you.

484
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,574
I'll have a gin and tonic, please.

485
00:31:46,694 --> 00:31:48,825
And I'll have a bottle
of O Negative.

486
00:31:52,957 --> 00:31:56,097
Sookie here would like to know
if she could ask you a few questions.

487
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:57,949
Would this be acceptable?

488
00:31:58,069 --> 00:32:01,126
I just have a couple of pictures
I'd love you to take a look at.

489
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,594
You recognize
either of these women?

490
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:06,293
Yeah, I've seen them
both here before.

491
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:08,637
Great, thank you. And do you
also happen to remember

492
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:10,508
who they hung around with?

493
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,747
That's something
we don't notice here.

494
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:14,143
You won't either.

495
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:15,876
Okay, then.

496
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:18,332
Thank you. I appreciate you
taking the time.

497
00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:21,259
This one.

498
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:23,361
She wanted to die.

499
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:29,450
- How do you know?
- Everyone who comes here does

500
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,327
in their own way.

501
00:32:31,946 --> 00:32:33,895
That's who we are: Death.

502
00:32:55,845 --> 00:32:58,089
<i>Oh, my God. He's so powerful.</i>
<i>So beautiful.</i>

503
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,517
<i>The closer I step,</i>
<i>the more beautiful he gets.</i>

504
00:33:00,637 --> 00:33:04,504
<i>You can do this. Just walk up there</i>
<i>and offer yourself to him...</i>

505
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:07,238
How's your drink?

506
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:09,614
A gin and tonic's pretty much
a gin and tonic

507
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:11,285
no matter where you drink it.

508
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,620
I know exactly what you mean.

509
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:23,144
Who's that?

510
00:33:24,184 --> 00:33:25,821
Oh, you noticed him,
did you?

511
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:29,037
- No, it's not like that. I just...
- Everyone does.

512
00:33:30,147 --> 00:33:31,100
That's Eric.

513
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:34,701
He's the oldest thing
in this bar.

514
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:50,611
I'm Taryn.

515
00:33:54,988 --> 00:33:56,621
Still think you're in Disneyworld?

516
00:34:02,614 --> 00:34:05,451
You say that this has never
happened to you before?

517
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:06,714
No, sir.

518
00:34:08,499 --> 00:34:10,849
Well, no sign of hypertension.

519
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,724
I'm gonna ask a question and
I'm gonna need you to be honest with me.

520
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,435
Have you taken any drugs today?

521
00:34:23,581 --> 00:34:26,109
- No, that's a negative.
- So no marijuana, then?

522
00:34:27,387 --> 00:34:28,700
How about cocaine?

523
00:34:29,302 --> 00:34:30,588
- Meth?
- No.

524
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:32,407
Vampire blood?

525
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:33,650
What?

526
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:35,243
Hell, that's sick.

527
00:34:35,627 --> 00:34:37,475
I mean, to even suggest that is...

528
00:34:37,595 --> 00:34:40,362
Yeah, yeah, you'd never
do anything like that.

529
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:41,876
All right.

530
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:43,861
Let's have a look.

531
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:47,255
Oh, boy.

532
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:50,132
Sure glad I'm not you.

533
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:53,802
That looks kind of like an eggplant,

534
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:56,556
what with that color and the way
it's all swell up at the end.

535
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,670
Can you fix it?

536
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,686
Ordinarily we like
to treat this in stages.

537
00:35:02,027 --> 00:35:03,892
First and least radical
being an injection

538
00:35:04,012 --> 00:35:06,190
of anti-inflammatory drugs
into the penis.

539
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:10,721
A needle in my dick?

540
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:13,489
That's the least radical thing
you can do?

541
00:35:13,931 --> 00:35:15,074
It is, yes.

542
00:35:15,326 --> 00:35:18,698
But you've progressed to the point
you wouldn't benefit from that at all.

543
00:35:18,818 --> 00:35:20,663
In my opinion,
we need to aspirate.

544
00:35:22,552 --> 00:35:24,876
I need to drain the blood
out of your penis.

545
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:34,265
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

546
00:35:36,453 --> 00:35:37,601
Where are you going?

547
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,304
Look, I will admit to sometimes

548
00:35:39,424 --> 00:35:41,633
having a sick curiosity
about medical shit,

549
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,728
but I ain't that fucking curious.

550
00:35:45,962 --> 00:35:47,846
Tara, stay with me?

551
00:35:51,117 --> 00:35:53,304
I ain't never gonna be the same
after this.

552
00:35:54,134 --> 00:35:55,031
You're not?

553
00:35:55,191 --> 00:35:56,409
Are you ready, son?

554
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:00,135
Ain't you gonna
put me out or something?

555
00:36:00,255 --> 00:36:03,164
I don't think we can afford the time
it would take to sedate you.

556
00:36:03,284 --> 00:36:05,864
Besides, without knowing what
other substances you've taken,

557
00:36:05,984 --> 00:36:07,933
I don't want to risk
a drug interaction.

558
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:09,989
Now, just lean on
back there for me.

559
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:11,207
There you go.

560
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:13,992
It's... It's gonna be okay.

561
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,260
You gotta breathe, though.

562
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:23,081
All right, then.
You're gonna feel a stick

563
00:36:23,201 --> 00:36:25,645
in three, two...

564
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:47,458
I hate to ask but would you mind
walking me to my car tonight?

565
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,137
No problem.

566
00:36:51,563 --> 00:36:52,839
Don't hate to ask.

567
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:54,816
Not with what's been going on.

568
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:58,306
Well, I ain't never been
with no vampire. But still,

569
00:36:58,872 --> 00:37:01,972
you know,
you can't be too safe, you know?

570
00:37:03,324 --> 00:37:04,939
Get the lights for me,
would you?

571
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:17,173
<i>I'm used to living in a small town</i>

572
00:37:17,293 --> 00:37:19,571
<i>and knowing everybody in it.
You knew you were safe.</i>

573
00:37:19,691 --> 00:37:21,806
<i>It's a new day now.</i>

574
00:37:21,926 --> 00:37:23,241
<i>Don't I know it.</i>

575
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,962
<i>How come no one fucked me?</i>
<i>I got a dog collar too.</i>

576
00:37:29,357 --> 00:37:31,586
<i>How'd you like me to rip
that tape off your tits?</i>

577
00:37:31,942 --> 00:37:34,085
<i>It ain't gay
if a guy's a vampire, is he?</i>

578
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:36,947
<i>I'm gonna get in a fight
if I don't fuck a vampire tonight.</i>

579
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:38,862
You able to pick up anything?

580
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:42,608
All anyone's thinking about
here is sex, sex, sex.

581
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:46,339
One needn't be telepathic
to pick up on that.

582
00:37:58,647 --> 00:37:59,917
Don't say "uh-oh."

583
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,825
Vampire are not supposed
to say "uh-oh."

584
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,036
It's Eric. He's scanned you twice.
He's going to summon us.

585
00:38:07,448 --> 00:38:08,475
He can do that?

586
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:32,406
- It has been a while.
- Yes, well,

587
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:35,358
- I've been...
- Mainstreaming.

588
00:38:37,557 --> 00:38:38,578
I heard.

589
00:38:42,674 --> 00:38:45,409
I see that is going well for you.

590
00:38:45,813 --> 00:38:48,496
Yes, of course. Uh, sorry.
Eric, this is my friend...

591
00:38:48,656 --> 00:38:51,148
- Sookie Stackhouse.
- How do you know my name?

592
00:38:51,268 --> 00:38:52,965
I never forget a pretty face.

593
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:54,418
You're in my vault.

594
00:38:54,886 --> 00:38:58,522
Great. That's just great.

595
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:00,257
It's nice to meet you.

596
00:39:00,658 --> 00:39:02,929
- Well, aren't you sweet.
- Not really.

597
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,018
I understand you've been
asking questions

598
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:15,494
about some of my customers.

599
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:17,532
- I have.
- If you have anything to ask,

600
00:39:17,652 --> 00:39:19,198
you should ask it of me.

601
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:21,540
All right. I...

602
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:25,741
You recognize either one
of these girls?

603
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:36,448
Well, this one
offered herself to me.

604
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:40,715
But I found her too pathetic
for my attentions.

605
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:45,068
Now, this one, however...

606
00:39:47,565 --> 00:39:48,709
I have tasted.

607
00:39:51,376 --> 00:39:54,145
- I remember them both.
- On account of the vault?

608
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,400
Never had either of them, though.
They weren't really my type.

609
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:02,102
Well,

610
00:40:02,354 --> 00:40:03,303
thanks a lot.

611
00:40:03,423 --> 00:40:06,813
- That is all your time I need to take.
- I'm not finished with you yet.

612
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:10,607
Please.

613
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,997
Sit.

614
00:40:23,408 --> 00:40:25,662
Are you quite attached
to your friend?

615
00:40:26,287 --> 00:40:27,428
She is mine.

616
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:30,445
I am his.

617
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:32,399
What a pity.

618
00:40:32,893 --> 00:40:33,891
For me.

619
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,661
Sit with us.

620
00:40:40,473 --> 00:40:42,651
We have catching up to do,
you and I.

621
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:44,862
It has been too long.

622
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:58,236
<i>My backup was supposed to be here
15 minutes ago.</i>

623
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:01,276
<i>I can't handle a raid on my own.</i>
<i>These fucking vampires...</i>

624
00:41:01,396 --> 00:41:02,839
We have to get out of here.

625
00:41:03,457 --> 00:41:05,257
Cops are coming.
There's gonna be a riot.

626
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:08,585
- You are an undercover cop?
- I'm not but that man in the hat is.

627
00:41:09,797 --> 00:41:11,514
We do nothing illegal.

628
00:41:11,674 --> 00:41:13,349
<i>Go ahead and do it. Open me up.</i>

629
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:15,442
<i>I don't care.
Make me feel something.</i>

630
00:41:15,562 --> 00:41:18,646
There's a vampire named Taryn
in the toilet with that man you kicked.

631
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:21,225
- She's feeding on him.
- How do you know this?

632
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:23,526
Freeze!

633
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:24,546
Police!

634
00:41:26,313 --> 00:41:27,244
Don't move!

635
00:41:27,475 --> 00:41:28,313
Follow me.

636
00:41:28,433 --> 00:41:29,599
Let's get out!

637
00:41:35,281 --> 00:41:36,455
I enjoyed meeting you.

638
00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:38,143
You will come again.

639
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,256
Get your ugly self down here.

640
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:02,970
Hey, Tara. Sookie ain't home.

641
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,049
No, just please let me in, okay?

642
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:07,078
I'm gonna crack you
in a way you'll...

643
00:42:07,198 --> 00:42:09,336
- Don't let her in.
- Is there a problem here?

644
00:42:09,456 --> 00:42:11,490
You bet your tiny white ass
there's a problem.

645
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,576
Little bitch hid my Captain Morgan.

646
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:15,738
I didn't hide it, Mom.
I threw it out.

647
00:42:16,928 --> 00:42:18,269
Look, my Gran's at the market

648
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:20,863
and I ain't supposed to let anyone in
while she's gone.

649
00:42:20,983 --> 00:42:23,377
- You let her in.
- Well, I know her.

650
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,672
- Mama, let him go.
- Maybe I should call Sheriff Dearborne,

651
00:42:26,832 --> 00:42:29,147
so he can come out here
and throw you in jail

652
00:42:29,267 --> 00:42:31,282
where I guarantee ain't no
Captain Morgan

653
00:42:31,402 --> 00:42:33,005
gonna be waiting for you.

654
00:42:39,408 --> 00:42:40,811
This ain't over.

655
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,041
Can we turn this down?

656
00:43:02,628 --> 00:43:04,725
What language
are they speaking, anyhow?

657
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:06,082
Cambodian.

658
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:09,299
You don't like it?

659
00:43:11,574 --> 00:43:13,683
You think we can pull over
for a minute?

660
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:15,900
I need things to stop.

661
00:43:17,913 --> 00:43:18,799
Sure.

662
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:36,181
I just need a couple minutes
of quiet and then we can go.

663
00:43:36,301 --> 00:43:38,449
Well, I'm in no hurry.
You take your time.

664
00:43:42,314 --> 00:43:44,489
I'm sorry I've got you
into any trouble.

665
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:45,890
Don't apologize.

666
00:43:46,822 --> 00:43:49,391
We vampires are always
in some kind of trouble.

667
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:54,740
I prefer to be in it with you.

668
00:44:17,275 --> 00:44:18,138
Open up.

669
00:44:18,258 --> 00:44:20,811
Open the window and let me
do the talking, okay?

670
00:44:24,672 --> 00:44:26,701
- Hello, officer.
- Evening, miss.

671
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:32,166
- What are you two doing out this late?
- Driving home from a date.

672
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:35,759
We were raiding a bar
not too far from here.

673
00:44:36,029 --> 00:44:38,013
Y'all coming from there
by any chance?

674
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,257
Not us.

675
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,902
It's called Fantasia.
That ring any bells?

676
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:47,801
How about you, son?

677
00:44:48,295 --> 00:44:49,865
You seem awful quiet.

678
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:52,542
Don't you talk?

679
00:44:54,303 --> 00:44:56,366
I'm a man of few words.

680
00:44:57,341 --> 00:44:58,821
A man of few words.

681
00:44:59,985 --> 00:45:01,084
I like that.

682
00:45:02,755 --> 00:45:05,205
Let me just shine this light
here on your neck, miss,

683
00:45:05,555 --> 00:45:06,676
if you don't mind.

684
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:13,208
Not at all.

685
00:45:17,522 --> 00:45:20,471
Why don't you ask her if you can
shine it between her legs?

686
00:45:20,591 --> 00:45:21,615
Excuse me.

687
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:27,209
Vampires sometimes like to feed
from the femoral artery.

688
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:31,168
The blood flows more freely
down there

689
00:45:32,417 --> 00:45:34,918
so one doesn't
have to suck as hard.

690
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:38,774
Or so I've been told.

691
00:45:48,033 --> 00:45:49,576
I like your gun.

692
00:45:50,444 --> 00:45:51,877
It's a beautiful weapon.

693
00:45:53,479 --> 00:45:54,534
Thank you.

694
00:45:57,443 --> 00:45:58,356
May I have it?

695
00:45:58,476 --> 00:46:00,235
I want you to stop this right now.

696
00:46:00,355 --> 00:46:01,088
Sure.

697
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:03,308
I guess.

698
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:07,554
Nice.

699
00:46:09,787 --> 00:46:11,623
It's heavier than I imagined it.

700
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:14,172
Is it loaded?

701
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,692
Well, yes.

702
00:46:16,062 --> 00:46:17,361
Yes, it is.

703
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,598
Bill, you are freaking me out.

704
00:46:23,006 --> 00:46:25,035
Now, you listen to me, officer.

705
00:46:26,274 --> 00:46:29,087
I do not take kindly
to you shining your light

706
00:46:29,207 --> 00:46:31,208
in the eyes of my female companion.

707
00:46:33,272 --> 00:46:35,629
And as I have more
than 100 years on you,

708
00:46:36,398 --> 00:46:39,299
I do not take kindly
you to calling me "son."

709
00:46:40,403 --> 00:46:42,400
So the next time
you pull somebody over

710
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,638
on suspicion of being a vampire,

711
00:46:46,077 --> 00:46:48,392
you better pray to God
that you're wrong.

712
00:46:50,389 --> 00:46:52,771
Because that vampire
may not be as kind to you

713
00:46:52,931 --> 00:46:54,101
as I'm about to be.

714
00:46:57,468 --> 00:46:59,236
I'm not gonna kill you.

715
00:47:01,186 --> 00:47:03,036
But I am gonna keep your gun.

716
00:47:05,287 --> 00:47:07,161
- Does that sound fair?
- Yes.

717
00:47:07,597 --> 00:47:09,089
- Yes, what?
- Yes, sir.

718
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,228
There you go.

719
00:47:16,435 --> 00:47:17,880
Now, you have a nice night.
