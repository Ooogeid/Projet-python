1
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:09,762
Spicy.

2
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:13,763
Who's a pretty girl? Huh?
You're a pretty girl.

3
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,931
You're pretty.
Yes, you are.

4
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,142
Piss off.

5
00:00:19,756 --> 00:00:22,565
I know it's not too good
to be all matchy-matchy,

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,856
but you and your...

7
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:28,558
dusky little bloodbeast
are totally at odds with my decor.

8
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:31,030
Nobody cares what you think
about anything. Shut up.

9
00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:37,694
- I'm awful sorry.
- No, you're not.

10
00:00:38,228 --> 00:00:40,831
- Good girl.
- Ignore him. He's the cleaning lady.

11
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:42,627
Psycho fugly thug.

12
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,630
You know him?

13
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,778
I thought I did.

14
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,444
Why is she here?

15
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:34,945
Why is she here?

16
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,780
- She wants to be with me.
- Hence the restraints.

17
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:38,991
She's mine.

18
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,035
Relax. Nobody wants her.

19
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:42,661
Certainly not I.

20
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,892
Why is he here?

21
00:02:46,017 --> 00:02:48,000
Because I have a present
for you, sir.

22
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
Please.

23
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:53,004
You're not supposed
to bring work home.

24
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,174
Darling, king.

25
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,358
You never disappoint.
Shall we retire to the study?

26
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:08,395
What is going on here?
What's wrong with you?

27
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:13,051
Your behavior is somewhat erratic.

28
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:15,252
Help me.

29
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:40,678
As always, the deposit
will go to your trust account.

30
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,469
But I want cash.

31
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:45,235
Last time you had any real money

32
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,978
you ended up at the slots in Biloxi,
slaughtering a group of elderly women.

33
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,855
They wouldn't let me have a turn.

34
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,190
Why are you dragging
another girl around?

35
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:55,577
So sloppy.

36
00:03:57,577 --> 00:03:59,827
I'm tired of cleaning up after you.

37
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,582
This is one
is spectacularly different.

38
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:06,952
She's such a fucking disaster.
We could be twins.

39
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:09,331
The attraction is electric.

40
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:12,932
You're a huge freak.

41
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:15,546
But I like your work.

42
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:19,033
Bill Compton

43
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,594
is lying to me.

44
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,636
Yes, sir.

45
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:25,108
Who keeps a dossier on his human?

46
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:26,919
Why would he care about
her family tree?

47
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:30,477
Sophie Anne's overstated
perfume is all over this.

48
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:31,979
That's what I thought.

49
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:36,901
She's already escaped us once,
this barmaid.

50
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,119
Send a wolf, what'd you expect?

51
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,829
Maybe I should send you back
to Bon Temps

52
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:46,825
to acquire Sookie Stackhouse.

53
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,621
I don't have to go anywhere.

54
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:51,172
She's in Jackson.

55
00:04:57,993 --> 00:05:01,043
I'll let you play
your little game of hard to get.

56
00:05:01,737 --> 00:05:04,794
You're gonna be that much sweeter
when you're mine again.

57
00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:06,847
You know, Russell was right.

58
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:10,582
You're not very smart.

59
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:13,637
You played yourself into a corner,

60
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:15,244
you tiresome cow.

61
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:22,821
What happened back there?

62
00:05:23,372 --> 00:05:24,576
Why were they shifting?

63
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,574
- You almost shifted.
- Couldn't help it.

64
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,078
When that energy starts rolling,
it takes you over.

65
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:32,005
We're lucky we got out
of there alive. Fuck!

66
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:37,056
I know it was terrible-
You don't know anything.

67
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:39,088
If you don't slow down,
you're gonna kill us.

68
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:41,680
And I am not gonna die
because of your shitty girlfriend

69
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:43,605
and a Mississippi pothole!

70
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:54,133
I had to be mean to make you listen.

71
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:55,688
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:55,903 --> 00:05:57,653
She wasn't always shitty.

73
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,733
We were great together.

74
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:05,165
When she wasn't drinking
or cheating.

75
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,248
She used to play horseshoes
with my dad,

76
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,315
help my mom plant tomatoes.

77
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,080
But tonight she was half-naked
in a wolf skin, getting branded.

78
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:17,304
Tell me more
about Russell Edgington.

79
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:20,112
He's just some rich vampire.
That's all I knew till tonight.

80
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,965
- I gotta talk to him.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

81
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,297
The brand, the blood, the vampire.

82
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:28,303
He knows where Bill is,
or he knows who knows.

83
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,221
I promised Eric
I'd keep you out of trouble.

84
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:34,018
You ain't going near him, Sookie.

85
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,272
This is completely unnecessary.

86
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:46,348
I told you I come in peace.

87
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:49,889
Hello. Have we met?

88
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:53,101
Eric Northman, sheriff,
Louisiana Area 5.

89
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,581
I've come to see the king.

90
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,155
Talbot, royal consort.

91
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,060
Permit me to facilitate.

92
00:07:06,197 --> 00:07:07,751
Let him go, you idiots.

93
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,816
I humbly request permission
to hunt your territory

94
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:17,895
for the vampire missing
from my area.

95
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,196
I appreciate your courtesy, Eric.

96
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:21,899
It's very old-world.

97
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:25,736
Nobody has manners anymore.
It was all so beautiful once.

98
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,424
Your fugitive,
what's his name again?

99
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,908
I'm responsible for him,
and I'm ashamed to admit it,

100
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,954
but he's wanted
for selling vampire blood.

101
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,626
That's heinous.

102
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:42,377
Are you sure?

103
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:44,296
Let's ask him.

104
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:45,789
<i>Voilà.</i>

105
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:49,718
He's not missing,
and he's way too square to deal V.

106
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:54,165
You tried to pin that on me?

107
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,706
We all know it's your queen
behind this, Northman.

108
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:00,077
And that you did
the selling for her.

109
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,148
You see, Mr. Compton has
accepted a position in my court

110
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,417
and therefore keeps nothing from me.

111
00:08:10,997 --> 00:08:12,699
You're here of your own accord.

112
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:15,455
Which means...

113
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:18,338
Sookie is no longer mine.

114
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,037
A king in front of them,
a queen behind them,

115
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:27,662
and they're talking
about a human girl.

116
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:28,908
Men.

117
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,427
Your Majesty...

118
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:34,089
I confess.

119
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:39,768
I sold the blood at my queen's command
and accused Bill to protect her.

120
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:43,251
So, what do I do now?

121
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:46,733
Unless I give the Magister Compton,
he'll murder my progeny.

122
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:50,362
Darling, so sad.

123
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:53,656
The Magister

124
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,328
is a nasty little...

125
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:58,797
anachronistic toad,

126
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,793
a ridiculous remnant
of the Middle Ages.

127
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:02,541
The only power he has over us

128
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,218
is the power we give him.

129
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,834
There may be a way
to solve all our problems.

130
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:13,177
Sleep here.

131
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,388
You're more than welcome.

132
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:19,433
How can I refuse?

133
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,025
You can't just walk back in here.
Give me my key.

134
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,411
Shut up!
Don't tell me what to do!

135
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:41,538
It's my key,
and I'll use it whenever I want!

136
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:43,662
You walked out on me.
You got no right.

137
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:45,847
We'd still be together
if you weren't so weak!

138
00:09:45,972 --> 00:09:47,961
- Keep it down.
- Don't tell me to keep it down!

139
00:09:48,842 --> 00:09:50,964
Because I don't give a shit
about the neighbors!

140
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,133
I'm here to save your fucking life.

141
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,927
Liar. You drug addict.

142
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,137
You sold your soul to a vamp.
I saw you.

143
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,139
He's more than a vamp.

144
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,537
You ignorant redneck.

145
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:04,630
- If he knew what you saw...
- Fuck him.

146
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:06,777
I'm warning you...

147
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:08,440
if anybody

148
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,943
finds out
what went on at Lou Pine's...

149
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:15,791
That's your neighbor?

150
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:20,410
- Hell, no.
- She got nothing to do with this.

151
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,704
You're fucking my wolf, bitch.
In my house.

152
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,067
<i>Like I did with Coot and Roy
and Bobby and Travis.</i>

153
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,715
Like you did with Coot and Roy
and Bobby and Travis.

154
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,623
What'd you say to me, whore?

155
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:32,756
I can throw you out,
blood or no blood.

156
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,769
No, I'm not sleeping with him.

157
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:37,344
But you traded this good person
who loves you

158
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,638
for a shot of V,
that burn on your back,

159
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,767
and a dumb biker who's half the man
and half the wolf that Alcide is.

160
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:45,652
I will fuck you up!

161
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:47,646
I will cut you!

162
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,482
Back off.

163
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:53,886
Where is Bill Compton?

164
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:57,311
<i>Who the hell is Bill Compton?</i>

165
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,629
Do you like your new gown?

166
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,257
I picked it out especially
for my lover.

167
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:22,888
Thank you so much.

168
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:26,515
Even when I'm away from you,

169
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:30,358
I can feel your flesh molded to me.

170
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:33,004
That's how close we are now.

171
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,236
That's really sweet.

172
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:36,546
I know.

173
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:40,365
Almost forgot.

174
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,986
You have a text message.

175
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:46,307
"Bitch, where are you?"

176
00:11:47,902 --> 00:11:50,459
You said no boyfriends. Who is he?
Who's Lafayette?

177
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,419
I'll rip your throat out.

178
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:56,703
He's my cousin.

179
00:11:58,198 --> 00:11:59,848
And he's gay.

180
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:06,301
Well, how do I get rid of him?

181
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:07,918
How about...

182
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,979
"I'm busy, bitch"?

183
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:14,508
No, "bitch." He wrote "bitch."
Too many "bitches. " "Hooker"?

184
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,483
In his other messages,
he calls you "hooker. "

185
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:20,085
"Hooker." No, "hookah".
That's a water pipe.

186
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:22,886
Tell him I'm okay.

187
00:12:23,781 --> 00:12:26,703
Say, "Trust me, motherfucker."

188
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:30,271
"Trust me, motherfucker. "
Brilliant.

189
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:36,026
Watch how fast
I type "motherfucker".

190
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,381
It's cool, right?

191
00:12:40,531 --> 00:12:41,737
Amazing.

192
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,326
I'll delete it
so you can watch again.

193
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:51,493
Look. Look at me.

194
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:56,606
Love you.

195
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:01,783
I'm a fan of the regular mulch,
myself.

196
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:05,217
That's good for everyday,

197
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:07,245
but I love that red mulch.

198
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,461
I use it in all my flowerbeds.

199
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:11,516
It would look so good
by your wishing well.

200
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:14,157
I don't know.
That seems kind of wild.

201
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:21,144
Morning, Kenya.

202
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:22,939
Morning, Kevin.

203
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,872
Morning.

204
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:31,685
- What you doing here?
- What am I doing? I'm here to work.

205
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,312
Really?

206
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,386
Chomping at the bit.

207
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:38,442
Point me at the crime scene
and let's go get her.

208
00:13:38,911 --> 00:13:41,611
Acting Sheriff Andy Bellefleur,
would you come out here, please?

209
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:45,132
Can it wait? I was just going
to the restroom.

210
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:47,868
Morning, boss.
I'm ready for my first day.

211
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,046
I guess this means you find
my performance inadequate.

212
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,383
I'll if you don't get out to the corner
and cross them little kids to school.

213
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:07,616
What's going on, Andy?

214
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:10,798
Why does Jason Stackhouse
need a desk in the Sheriff's Department?

215
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:13,044
Nobody else is using it.
What do you care?

216
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:16,630
Run those folders in the conference room
over to the courthouse?

217
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:20,340
Please, Deputy Jones.

218
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:27,169
I don't want a desk.

219
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:29,948
I wanna be out in the field,
where it's real.

220
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:31,244
That's where I shine.

221
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:33,721
This ain't magic, Jason.
You gotta learn the ropes.

222
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:36,711
Trust me, I'm pushing you
through fast as I can.

223
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,877
Now, Rosie's home with female pains,

224
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:41,505
so for now,

225
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,423
you're in charge of the phones.

226
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:46,107
Can I at least have a uniform?

227
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,178
Let me get right on that.

228
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,066
Easy.

229
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:56,804
He's just showing me
how strong he is.

230
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:58,355
Makes me proud.

231
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,400
Watch it.

232
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:05,987
- That's your damn father.
- I know exactly who he is.

233
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:07,395
It's nothing.

234
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,908
It's a little game
they ought to play in private.

235
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:12,763
He'll make it up to me.
Won't you, boy?

236
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,383
Maybe you need to talk
amongst yourselves, all right?

237
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:18,333
Y'all listen to Sam.

238
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,551
He's always got the good ideas.

239
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:25,048
It's all been said.

240
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:40,188
Look at you.
You doing what I think you're doing?

241
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,859
Me, Terry Bellefleur...

242
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,821
I'm moving in with Arlene Fowler.

243
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:50,324
Congratulations.

244
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,113
You're cracking my ribs, buddy.

245
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:01,189
Now, it's gonna be okay.

246
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,253
Sure, it's scary.

247
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:06,754
She's a little crazy, but so are...

248
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:08,825
Is everybody, you know?

249
00:16:09,237 --> 00:16:10,302
Don't worry.

250
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:12,621
I ain't worried.

251
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,432
I've never been so not worried.

252
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:18,810
This is what normal people do, Sam.

253
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,378
They fall in love.

254
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:24,085
They make each other laugh.
And they move in together.

255
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,144
They raise kids.
They fight over money.

256
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:28,820
They get old and fat together,
and it's normal.

257
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:32,076
And it's happening to me.

258
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:36,242
- I can't believe it.
- Well, I can.

259
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:38,330
Nobody deserves it more.

260
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,668
Baby?
I don't feel too good today.

261
00:16:44,022 --> 00:16:47,130
I ain't cleaned nothing,
I ain't cleared nothing out.

262
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:50,133
I'm the luckiest man in the world.

263
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,270
Coming, honey.

264
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:59,708
We can't be kissing right now.
Just put that in the living room.

265
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,273
Happy for you, Arlene.

266
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,990
I never thought
it would happen again.

267
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,366
And again.

268
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:16,347
And again.

269
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:18,703
And that other time too.

270
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,410
But especially now.

271
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:24,959
Sweet Jesus, I am a hurting gator.

272
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,337
You know...

273
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:29,339
Hey, Joe Lee.

274
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:33,927
I got these tenants here.
You could be my on-site handyman.

275
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:35,845
Handyman?

276
00:17:36,428 --> 00:17:39,391
I got a list as long as my leg.

277
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,478
- Well, if it don't hurt my back.
- He'd love to.

278
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:45,689
Time for work, bro.

279
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:48,653
Have a great day, Sam.

280
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,725
<i>It's gone too far
and it's picking up speed.</i>

281
00:18:22,165 --> 00:18:24,665
<i>I gotta tell the packmaster
everything.</i>

282
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:26,813
Gonna run errands.
Won't take long.

283
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,441
- What's a packmaster?
- Goddamn it.

284
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,526
I gotta do what I gotta do.

285
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,151
This is were business.

286
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:34,946
We mustn't tell you anything.

287
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:38,491
I've been listening to private thoughts
since I was a little girl.

288
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:40,535
Keeping secrets is how I survive.

289
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,081
Then I'll have to dig it out of you,
and I really don't like to do that.

290
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,960
Pack isn't a democracy.

291
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,715
Most weres don't have much sense.
You saw.

292
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,381
They're all teeth and fight and sex.

293
00:18:57,034 --> 00:18:58,282
Packmaster's our alpha.

294
00:18:58,407 --> 00:19:00,889
He makes the big decisions,
keeps the rest of us in line.

295
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:03,808
How much does your packmaster
know about last night?

296
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,811
That's what I have to find out.
Then he'll tell us what to do.

297
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,773
- I'm coming along.
- I'm not breaking another rule for you.

298
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,356
Then you might as well
invite Debbie over to tear me up,

299
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:14,194
'cause that's what she'll try to do.

300
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:18,072
Work with me, Alcide.

301
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:20,575
It gets easier.

302
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:29,751
I'll take the car accident
on Euclid.

303
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,920
I'll take the vandalism over
at the high school.

304
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:33,588
What do I do?

305
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:36,257
File that for me.

306
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,001
You're driving me nuts.

307
00:20:22,126 --> 00:20:24,326
I can't work a desk no more, Andy.

308
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:28,035
It's sucking the life out of me.

309
00:20:28,398 --> 00:20:29,616
I need a cold case.

310
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:31,848
I need a special assignment.

311
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:35,067
I need some fucking thing
to do right fucking now

312
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:39,394
or I'll blow up like a M80
and take this whole place with me.

313
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,713
Don't worry.

314
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:43,176
I'll give you just what you need.

315
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:47,724
Suck on that thing.
Don't play with it.

316
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:49,473
There you go.

317
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:54,114
Now, this here cigarillo
is called a Macanudo Ascot.

318
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,434
But my personal favorite, boyfriend,
is the Schimmelpenninck panatella.

319
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,279
I don't care what they call it.
It tastes like shit.

320
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:04,657
Pussy.

321
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,320
Tommy, can you go inside for me,
please?

322
00:22:13,738 --> 00:22:15,438
I got five more minutes.

323
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:17,165
Get, please.

324
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,628
How you doing?

325
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,914
What happened to her?

326
00:22:29,524 --> 00:22:30,524
Excuse me?

327
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,095
You ain't got to be gentle.

328
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,978
She hated me and I hated her.
Just tell me how she died.

329
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:36,777
What, your mom?

330
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,258
Of course you'd think that.
I'm such a... idiot.

331
00:22:42,383 --> 00:22:44,529
I should have told you from the start.
She's good.

332
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:45,697
She...

333
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,241
She threw her breakfast
in my face yesterday.

334
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:52,207
Well, that's good, I guess.

335
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:54,825
It's her style, for sure.

336
00:22:56,486 --> 00:22:58,084
So, what are you doing here?

337
00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:02,952
I came by to see you.

338
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,260
Somebody been talking to you?

339
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,146
You heard a conversation
with my name in it?

340
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:12,246
Because whatever was said,
it ain't fucking true.

341
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:14,189
And you best not tell nobody

342
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:16,321
for your own fucking sake,
you feel me?

343
00:23:19,202 --> 00:23:21,441
Look, man, it's my day off.

344
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:24,485
I thought that maybe
you'd like to go watch a movie.

345
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:28,072
Me?

346
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:37,317
You don't want to. Forget about it.

347
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:40,186
I don't even know why...
It's a bad idea anyway.

348
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:44,047
It's just that I'm working.

349
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:46,924
- Till when?
- Eleven.

350
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,596
Eleven.

351
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:55,482
I would go with you, but...

352
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,690
No, I get it.

353
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:03,334
I'm going inside now.

354
00:24:13,883 --> 00:24:15,328
What are you doing?

355
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,410
I'll hang.

356
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:20,157
It's only nine hours.

357
00:24:21,186 --> 00:24:22,636
Nothing else to do.

358
00:24:25,978 --> 00:24:26,978
After you.

359
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,650
Oh, Lordy.

360
00:24:42,699 --> 00:24:45,663
If these were ordinary were junkies
scoring on the street,

361
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,053
I wouldn't be here,

362
00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:49,487
but they're organized
and drinking from the source.

363
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,247
Sookie was there.
She can back me up.

364
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:54,700
You'll be disciplined
for exposing us to a human, Alcide.

365
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,910
Yes, sir.

366
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,663
It's not his fault. We only wanted
to tell you what we saw.

367
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,184
I already know all about it.

368
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,582
Then you have a plan?

369
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,293
Whatever it is, I support you, sir,
a hundred percent.

370
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,171
Do nothing, tell no one.

371
00:25:08,392 --> 00:25:10,800
- How's that help the pack?
- Russell Edgington...

372
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,196
There's nothing I can do about him.

373
00:25:13,488 --> 00:25:16,013
He's the goddamn vampire king
of Mississippi.

374
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,274
Colonel Flood,

375
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,562
That gang is recruiting.
We can't sit back and let some fanger

376
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,231
- pick us off one by one.
- Edgington is ancient.

377
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:29,629
He's had a pack of weres serving him
for centuries all over the world.

378
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,485
Now he's on our doorstep.

379
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:34,824
We gonna be smart.

380
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,077
Let him do what he wants to do
until he goes away.

381
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,705
If he's part of our history,
you should have told us about him.

382
00:25:41,128 --> 00:25:43,791
I am saving us from extinction.

383
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,377
I'd rather be extinct
than slave to a dead man.

384
00:25:46,723 --> 00:25:49,630
<i>Don't know what else to do.
There's no one to help me.</i>

385
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,158
<i>He'll kill us all.
Maybe I'll just leave town.</i>

386
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:53,467
<i>I'm scared shitless.</i>

387
00:25:54,025 --> 00:25:55,175
<i>Show no fear.</i>

388
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,305
Don't question your packmaster, boy.

389
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,806
We gotta do something.

390
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:00,132
Let him go.

391
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:02,518
He can't help. He's afraid.

392
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:03,895
Bullshit.

393
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:12,612
Obey.

394
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:17,585
It wasn't bullshit.

395
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:21,545
I know.

396
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,664
I trust you.

397
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:28,629
"I'll give you what you need."

398
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,455
Goddamn piece of shit.

399
00:27:20,781 --> 00:27:21,847
Son of a bitch.

400
00:27:22,588 --> 00:27:23,588
Now what?

401
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,515
License and registration.

402
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:49,959
What for?

403
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,794
What'd I do?

404
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,296
We can discuss that further at a point
in time according to regulations.

405
00:27:55,421 --> 00:27:58,709
License, registration
and your insurance card.

406
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,055
I don't think so.

407
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,179
You'd better.

408
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,807
- I'm a cop.
- I don't think you are a cop.

409
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,591
Are you resisting me?

410
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,866
Because if you are,
observe the official police vehicle

411
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,150
where I came out of.

412
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:16,402
Where's your badge?

413
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,020
Where's your gun?

414
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:22,618
Where's your shirt?

415
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,385
All right, all right.
It's no secret.

416
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:31,292
I'm a Deputy Sheriff liaison,
which means I'm in training.

417
00:28:32,555 --> 00:28:34,455
But I'll be a cop real soon.

418
00:28:34,658 --> 00:28:35,658
Real soon.

419
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,007
So give me your ID.

420
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,052
Please?

421
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:43,763
You don't give up, do you?

422
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,181
No, ma'am, I don't.

423
00:28:48,972 --> 00:28:51,854
Why were you crying
the first time I saw you?

424
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:55,401
I wasn't crying.

425
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:57,971
I never cry.

426
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:04,378
I'm Jason Stackhouse,
and I wanna know you.

427
00:29:11,957 --> 00:29:14,141
But since you're not gonna
write me a ticket,

428
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:16,003
because you're a fake policeman,

429
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:18,716
and I got milk and mayonnaise
in the back, well...

430
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,758
Well, at least tell me your name.

431
00:29:22,746 --> 00:29:23,746
Crystal.

432
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:28,467
And your phone number.

433
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:29,475
No phone.

434
00:29:30,174 --> 00:29:32,245
- Everybody has a phone.
- I don't.

435
00:29:33,243 --> 00:29:36,143
- Meet me tonight at Merlotte's.
- Can't do it.

436
00:29:37,388 --> 00:29:39,038
I'll be there, Crystal.

437
00:29:42,635 --> 00:29:44,654
Excuse me,
can you hand me them peanuts?

438
00:29:54,097 --> 00:29:55,678
How's your first night going?

439
00:29:55,803 --> 00:29:57,628
I'd rather carry crap
than change tires.

440
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,479
Well, that's great.

441
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,174
It'll be a busy night.

442
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,942
Well, it's always a busy night
when you're the only waitress.

443
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,349
How come you never
look me in the eye?

444
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:12,968
Because I do not care
to be hypnotized,

445
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:15,866
which is apparently
what you walking dead people like to do.

446
00:30:19,707 --> 00:30:20,568
Hi there.

447
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,730
Welcome to Merlotte's.
I have a very romantic

448
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,669
red vinyl booth for the two of you
right over there, and...

449
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,018
And whatever happens...

450
00:30:31,356 --> 00:30:33,106
do not tip your waitress.

451
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:34,769
Do not.

452
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:38,253
Alrighty, then, let's go.

453
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:57,938
So you been here before?

454
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,231
Not since my daddy joined AA.

455
00:31:00,356 --> 00:31:03,194
But it sure does feel good
to be back, especially with you.

456
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:08,240
You feel free to order
anything that you want.

457
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,005
- Doesn't matter how much it costs.
- Thank you.

458
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,039
I don't eat much.
I don't wanna get fat like my mama.

459
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:17,192
At least not
until I had a baby or two.

460
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,627
I can't wait to have babies.

461
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,259
I'm real excited about it.

462
00:31:21,384 --> 00:31:24,131
Probably in like another two years
or so, but...

463
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,678
What's the matter?

464
00:31:31,702 --> 00:31:32,702
My ex.

465
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:36,766
What, him?

466
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:37,937
For real?

467
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:43,250
He look like he got bombed by radiation
on his way to middle school.

468
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,779
That's a giant sixth-grade boy
right there.

469
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:48,364
You don't know him.

470
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:51,102
He's really very sweet.

471
00:31:51,706 --> 00:31:52,706
Come on.

472
00:31:53,355 --> 00:31:56,205
He's Little League.
You're a smoking-hot vampire.

473
00:31:56,463 --> 00:31:57,863
You're the majors.

474
00:32:01,516 --> 00:32:03,166
And a "hell, yeah" too.

475
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:13,889
What?

476
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,523
<i>Get your ass home now.</i>

477
00:32:15,648 --> 00:32:17,048
No, I'm not gonna.

478
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,398
I got a job now.

479
00:32:18,523 --> 00:32:20,332
<i>I don't give a shit about no job.</i>

480
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,492
<i>Do what I say when I say it.</i>

481
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:25,341
<i>You hear me, you little shit?</i>

482
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:32,306
Why?

483
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:34,996
Tara, why?

484
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,752
I was afraid.

485
00:32:36,877 --> 00:32:39,776
Of me?
You were afraid of me?

486
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:41,049
That's insane.

487
00:32:41,174 --> 00:32:42,880
But you tied me up.

488
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,530
To keep you safe.

489
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,172
What other reason could there be?

490
00:32:56,381 --> 00:32:59,686
You have no idea
how much you've hurt me.

491
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:06,809
I feel like I've been staked.

492
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:14,636
I'm sorry, Franklin.

493
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:17,202
It's my fault.

494
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:19,776
My head is all confused.

495
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:24,066
Can you forgive me?

496
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:30,257
It's not you I'm afraid of,
it's this place.

497
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:33,260
All the other vampires...

498
00:33:34,237 --> 00:33:36,237
they're the ones who scare me.

499
00:33:44,204 --> 00:33:47,059
I'll never let them touch you.

500
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:00,367
There's only you.

501
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,120
They don't exist.

502
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:10,034
There's only you.

503
00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:20,374
You've circled certain names here.

504
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,680
I wonder why.

505
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,347
You're joking.

506
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:26,979
Am I?

507
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,327
I never saw this
before you showed it to me.

508
00:34:29,452 --> 00:34:31,568
I don't even know what it is.
Where did it come from?

509
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,071
Franklin Mott found that,
in your house.

510
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:39,591
With all due respect,
why would you believe him?

511
00:34:39,957 --> 00:34:42,246
It's my word against his.

512
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,476
Well, exactly.
He's an old friend.

513
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:47,153
- I'd trust him with...
- Your genealogy?

514
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,326
My genealogy.

515
00:34:52,802 --> 00:34:55,524
Earl Stackhouse, Sookie Stackhouse.

516
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:57,211
Those are the circled ones.

517
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:00,206
I have a theory, Bill.
Do you know what I think?

518
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:02,391
No, but I'm fascinated.

519
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:07,213
I think telepathy runs
in this family.

520
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,732
I think you've been playing
Track the Telepath.

521
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,380
You are trying to discover
the origins and the meaning

522
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,155
of your human's curious
mental condition,

523
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,623
because somehow,

524
00:35:18,257 --> 00:35:19,257
somewhere,

525
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,368
there is a payoff.

526
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:25,280
It's a theory beautifully built,

527
00:35:25,405 --> 00:35:27,483
of air and imagination.

528
00:35:29,157 --> 00:35:30,919
But it has nothing to do
with me, sir.

529
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:37,676
Excuse me, sir, can I talk to you?

530
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,144
In private?

531
00:35:42,496 --> 00:35:43,496
Guard!

532
00:35:57,484 --> 00:35:58,484
Buddy.

533
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:03,661
I deserve more of a welcome than that,
the news I got for you.

534
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,621
Sorry, I'm just kind
of waiting on somebody.

535
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:10,198
I pulled every string in my collection
on your behalf today.

536
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,316
I'm a deputy?

537
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:14,922
Pretty damn close.

538
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:18,053
They'll wave everything
but the physical.

539
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:20,427
- Boy, I'm in.
- And the written exam.

540
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,932
Wait, we talked about this.
I can't take no test.

541
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:27,101
You gotta. Come on, it's easy.

542
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:30,098
You just shove all that stuff
in your head, write your answers,

543
00:36:30,223 --> 00:36:33,824
and forget it all the next day,
learn on the job, like everybody else.

544
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:37,569
Come on, get your head up off the floor.
You'll do great.

545
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:41,088
Who's the girl?
Got a new one?

546
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,199
Don't matter.
She ain't coming.

547
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:49,606
You gonna break?

548
00:36:51,725 --> 00:36:52,725
You break.

549
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,167
Or I will.

550
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:57,172
Whatever you want.

551
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,853
You drove all this way
and waited all day

552
00:37:01,978 --> 00:37:03,478
and most of the night so...?

553
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,730
It was fun.

554
00:37:05,908 --> 00:37:06,908
You know?

555
00:37:07,854 --> 00:37:09,015
Drinking beers,

556
00:37:09,976 --> 00:37:11,311
talking to people.

557
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,209
Watching you do your thing.

558
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:16,731
My thing? That?

559
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:19,887
No, no, that is not my thing.

560
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:23,657
Still got to look at you.

561
00:37:27,165 --> 00:37:28,579
Did you look at me?

562
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:34,194
I can't be looking with all that grease
flying around the kitchen.

563
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:35,319
Right.

564
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:38,046
But I saw you.

565
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:42,927
Every now and again.

566
00:37:49,796 --> 00:37:50,851
So we gonna play?

567
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:54,355
I'll play.

568
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:56,481
And I'll break.

569
00:37:58,322 --> 00:38:00,477
I don't want you coming
in here running the table,

570
00:38:00,602 --> 00:38:02,095
making me look bad.

571
00:38:03,396 --> 00:38:05,230
I don't think that's possible.

572
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,784
Listen at you talking
all that bullshit to me.

573
00:38:16,823 --> 00:38:18,370
Can I stay with you tonight?

574
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:20,380
How come?

575
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,882
You know... brother time.

576
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,347
- You tell your folks, though.
- Yeah, I will.

577
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:29,515
I mean it.

578
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,809
I said I would, and I will.

579
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:35,479
You're lying, and that puts me right
in the middle of the Mickens,

580
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:38,005
which is exactly
where I don't wanna be.

581
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,950
Something's going on with you all.
I feel it.

582
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:43,249
I know it.

583
00:38:44,843 --> 00:38:46,657
What does Joe Lee want from you?

584
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:49,326
Nothing.

585
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,621
He's just a prick.

586
00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:55,171
You can talk to me, Tom.

587
00:38:56,241 --> 00:38:57,241
Sure.

588
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:09,304
You're a little edgy, bat boy.

589
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,473
- Get out.
- What are you gonna do?

590
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:13,038
Tell the king?

591
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:14,977
He's off you, bro.

592
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:17,579
You're on his shit list.

593
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,290
Everybody knows it.

594
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,483
Even his dirty little lapdog.

595
00:39:24,424 --> 00:39:26,224
You know what else I hear?

596
00:39:26,638 --> 00:39:30,566
And this is sexy good news.

597
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,019
You're gonna love this.
I know I loved it.

598
00:39:34,754 --> 00:39:36,957
Your Bon Temps piece of country ass,

599
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:39,085
your little blond ho

600
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:42,332
is fucking a werewolf

601
00:39:42,457 --> 00:39:44,214
right here in Jackson.

602
00:39:44,656 --> 00:39:46,552
- Suck that dick.
- Where?

603
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:56,476
Where is Sookie?

604
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:33,445
Thought you stood me up.

605
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:39,015
I didn't.

606
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,141
I tried to go in there
a couple times.

607
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:42,465
It was too...

608
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:46,889
This ain't right.

609
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:50,429
I shouldn't be here.

610
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,075
I shouldn't be anywhere near you.

611
00:40:54,145 --> 00:40:55,145
Why?

612
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,037
It's the way it is.

613
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,040
You don't understand,

614
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:01,929
and I can't explain.

615
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:04,875
Listen, don't go.

616
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:08,309
I gotta.

617
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,147
Take a walk with me.

618
00:41:19,776 --> 00:41:21,226
Just a little walk.

619
00:42:01,864 --> 00:42:03,514
You're an outdoor girl.

620
00:42:04,664 --> 00:42:06,353
I'll tell you that for nothing.

621
00:42:08,377 --> 00:42:10,427
You're happy here in the woods.

622
00:42:12,744 --> 00:42:13,744
Maybe so.

623
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,416
I'm that way too.

624
00:42:26,048 --> 00:42:27,648
We got that in common.

625
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,610
Something's happening to us.

626
00:42:39,102 --> 00:42:40,432
I don't wanna jinx it.

627
00:42:41,453 --> 00:42:43,503
Those things you can't explain.

628
00:42:45,671 --> 00:42:47,191
I don't care about 'em.

629
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:49,307
That's what you say now.

630
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,126
I'm pretty sure I mean it.

631
00:42:54,299 --> 00:42:56,053
And I just might mean it forever.

632
00:42:57,478 --> 00:42:59,328
There is no forever for us.

633
00:43:01,676 --> 00:43:02,876
It's only now.

634
00:43:03,888 --> 00:43:06,566
- That ain't true. It couldn't be.
- It is true.

635
00:43:08,014 --> 00:43:09,414
Now is everything.

636
00:43:12,304 --> 00:43:13,736
Now is perfect.

637
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:17,344
I've never been happier
in my whole life

638
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:19,463
than I am right now with you.

639
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:24,476
If you don't want me
to touch you more,

640
00:43:25,465 --> 00:43:27,465
if you want me to stop here...

641
00:43:29,371 --> 00:43:32,274
I'm gonna have to step away,
because I'm...

642
00:43:35,684 --> 00:43:36,884
I'm all upset.

643
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,983
We got that in common too.

644
00:44:00,393 --> 00:44:02,144
Please accept my apologies.

645
00:44:02,269 --> 00:44:05,018
- A matter to which I must attend.
- Trouble?

646
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,957
Not really.
More of an experiment.

647
00:44:07,082 --> 00:44:08,982
Perhaps I can be of service.

648
00:44:12,145 --> 00:44:13,858
Indulge my boy Talbot, will you?

649
00:44:14,435 --> 00:44:15,944
Let him give you the full tour.

650
00:44:16,332 --> 00:44:18,206
Makes him positively blithe.

651
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:23,241
I have a child of my own
in the Magister's bony hands.

652
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,998
- If you could help as soon as poss...
- All in good time, Eric.

653
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:42,551
You.

654
00:44:44,775 --> 00:44:45,775
You.

655
00:44:46,347 --> 00:44:47,350
Boys only.

656
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:53,398
Show me everything.

657
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,400
Man.
That's a call, right there.

658
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,373
Don't open it.

659
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,424
What do you mean, don't open it?

660
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:13,919
Fuck.

661
00:45:16,182 --> 00:45:18,224
You sneaky shifter piece of shit.

662
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:19,924
Give me back my boy.

663
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:22,063
Tommy, get over here.
I'll beat you blind.

664
00:45:22,188 --> 00:45:25,262
Breaking down my door?
Who the hell do you think you are?

665
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:27,943
- Go home.
- I ain't leaving without my son.

666
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,228
- He ain't going anywhere with you.
- You don't get it,

667
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,790
you dumb motherfucker.

668
00:45:33,915 --> 00:45:35,294
I own him,

669
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:36,663
head to tail.

670
00:45:36,788 --> 00:45:38,693
Fuck you, you broke-down bastard.

671
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,311
You don't own shit.

672
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,540
You live in a house I own.
You wanna keep it, get out,

673
00:45:43,665 --> 00:45:45,651
before I throw your ass
in the parking lot!

674
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:47,077
You don't think I'll do it?

675
00:45:47,825 --> 00:45:49,875
I'll do it.
I'd love to do it.

676
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:55,043
Sorry.

677
00:45:55,847 --> 00:45:57,147
I'm liquored up.

678
00:45:58,234 --> 00:46:00,134
I can't even think straight.

679
00:46:02,796 --> 00:46:03,946
He's gotta...

680
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:07,689
to learn responsibility.

681
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:14,002
It'll all be better in the morning.

682
00:46:29,347 --> 00:46:30,997
What the fuck was that?

683
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:42,139
What's the matter?
Who made you cry?

684
00:46:42,796 --> 00:46:43,996
I'll kill him.

685
00:46:45,071 --> 00:46:46,071
Nobody.

686
00:46:47,181 --> 00:46:49,055
It's only I'm hungry,

687
00:46:49,804 --> 00:46:51,554
and they brought me this.

688
00:46:52,055 --> 00:46:53,905
And I can't eat day lilies.

689
00:46:59,247 --> 00:47:01,795
Tell Talbot we don't want
his fucking flowers!

690
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,147
And don't come back!

691
00:47:04,272 --> 00:47:05,972
She wants to be with me!

692
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:13,996
God, you are sexy.

693
00:47:17,205 --> 00:47:18,168
We need to talk.

694
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,984
Don't say that.
Women say that, everything goes black,

695
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:23,922
and I wake up surrounded
by body parts.

696
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,959
Baby, no, no, it's okay.

697
00:47:26,762 --> 00:47:28,765
That's not where I'm going at all.

698
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,010
I'm into you.

699
00:47:33,065 --> 00:47:34,755
I mean, really into you.

700
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:43,521
But if we're gonna be together,
you have to remember

701
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:45,345
that I'm alive.

702
00:47:45,886 --> 00:47:47,036
I have needs,

703
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:48,765
like food.

704
00:47:50,194 --> 00:47:53,327
- You're right. I'm ashamed.
- No, baby, it's just a thing.

705
00:47:54,255 --> 00:47:56,414
- I'll remind you.
- I can do better.

706
00:47:56,885 --> 00:47:59,876
- Let me take you somewhere for dinner.
- I would love that.

707
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,212
There's Shoney's in Vicksburg.

708
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,200
Great.

709
00:48:06,709 --> 00:48:08,635
We'll celebrate
your last night as a human.

710
00:48:10,015 --> 00:48:10,929
What?

711
00:48:11,197 --> 00:48:12,397
I'm proposing.

712
00:48:13,976 --> 00:48:15,266
I'm gonna turn you.

713
00:48:22,765 --> 00:48:24,715
Will you be my vampire bride?

714
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:36,706
And what is this?

715
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:40,835
Japanese vampire erotica
from the 16th century.

716
00:48:41,784 --> 00:48:43,419
Exquisite detail.

717
00:48:44,342 --> 00:48:45,772
You learn any tricks?

718
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:49,883
You know as well as I
there's nothing new except someone new.

719
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,897
It's an eclectic collection.

720
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,149
You should see
what we have in storage.

721
00:48:58,274 --> 00:49:00,274
Russell's a greedy little boy.

722
00:49:00,906 --> 00:49:03,159
He wants what he wants
and he takes it.

723
00:49:03,718 --> 00:49:05,733
He's the same way about people.

724
00:49:06,651 --> 00:49:07,651
Watch out.

725
00:49:28,912 --> 00:49:29,844
And this?

726
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:31,719
Some random tribal crown.

727
00:49:32,307 --> 00:49:34,357
He must have a hundred of them.

728
00:49:34,781 --> 00:49:37,043
This one's Scythian, I think.

729
00:49:38,158 --> 00:49:39,158
Viking.

730
00:53:15,294 --> 00:53:16,544
It's beautiful.

731
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,520
Quite.

732
00:53:53,653 --> 00:53:55,189
You have to go now.

733
00:53:55,709 --> 00:53:57,191
Is that all you have to say to me?

734
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,442
There's no time.
You must take her away.

735
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,904
Wherever I'm going,
you're coming too.

736
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:03,273
It's too late.

737
00:54:03,572 --> 00:54:04,866
There's no hope for me.

738
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:08,411
You've gotta get her out of Jackson
as fast as you can.

739
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,955
- I believe him.
- What do you mean, there's no hope?

740
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:12,415
You have to leave now.

741
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:14,584
I will, but tell me
what I'm running from.

742
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,470
Come on in.

743
00:54:20,959 --> 00:54:22,534
That's for Debbie, fucker.

744
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:25,052
Grab the girl, you imbecile.

745
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,406
Uncle Coot is gonna get you.

746
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,020
Maybe not!

747
00:54:46,245 --> 00:54:48,224
Fantastic!
