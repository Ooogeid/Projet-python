1
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:15,098
Pig!

2
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,784
Just give in.

3
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:35,528
It feels so good.

4
00:00:38,477 --> 00:00:39,747
What's she done to you?

5
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:08,234
What the...?

6
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:19,995
Stop.

7
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:36,387
<i>I'm here, Sam.</i>
<i>You're gonna be the one.</i>

8
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:32,442
Nobody move!

9
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:38,342
I said don't fuckin' move!

10
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:45,338
What the hell are you doin'?

11
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:48,849
Put on some goddamn pants.

12
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:53,190
What the hell?

13
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:06,972
Godric, can you hear me?

14
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:10,408
Isabel and Eric sent us.
Godric!

15
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,011
I know he's down here somewhere.

16
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,064
I heard the awful things
they're plannin' to do.

17
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,131
Remember how I said
I was claustrophobic?

18
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:20,231
I wasn't makin' that part up.
It's bad.

19
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:23,640
Okay, I can't take elevators,
walk-in closets.

20
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:26,418
You know, hotels where they tuck
the sheets in all tight?

21
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:29,280
Just thinkin' about that
makes me want to scream.

22
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,677
Jesus Christ,
Vampire Exterminator?

23
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,631
Silver and Stakes?

24
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:35,419
Send'Em Back to Hell?

25
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:37,922
So sick teachin' kids
to hate like this.

26
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:39,648
I don't have time for games.

27
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:42,508
- I need to get out of here.
- Take a deep breath.

28
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:43,815
Look at me.

29
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:45,899
It's gonna be okay.

30
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:48,150
We're gonna figure
this out, all right?

31
00:04:52,455 --> 00:04:53,705
Okay, I'm okay.

32
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:57,440
So the Newlins knew who we were
the minute we walked in.

33
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:59,830
Same way they knew
to come after me at the airport.

34
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,717
'Cause someone at that nest
is a traitor.

35
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,929
A vampire's siding with the Fellowship
to get Godric out of the way?

36
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:08,239
'Cause he wants to be sheriff?

37
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:11,018
I've heard of ambitious,
but that's just plain crazy.

38
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,465
You've met him. I mean,
he would rip our throats out

39
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,137
for lookin' at him sideways.

40
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:16,412
If it's true,

41
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,399
Bill and Eric could do
a lot worse to him

42
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:20,064
when they find out.

43
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,970
Bill had to have sensed
my fear.

44
00:05:26,322 --> 00:05:29,307
He's gonna come storming through
this church any second.

45
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,580
And you don't seem
happy about that because?

46
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:36,460
These fanatics are about to barbecue
a 2000-year-old vampire

47
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:38,688
in front of the entire congregation.

48
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:42,232
Who knows what else
they're capable of?

49
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,676
Get out of my way!

50
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:45,886
But we have so much
catchin' up to do.

51
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,054
Move now!

52
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,222
I will not ask again.

53
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:53,906
You smell like her.

54
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:55,558
Sweet.

55
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,315
And cheap.

56
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:06,431
William Compton,

57
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:08,356
you're still so sensitive.

58
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:12,560
Some might say it's a weakness,
but I've, I always found it oddly

59
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:13,622
cute.

60
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,397
We can play this game all night,

61
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:21,431
but we both know
I am stronger and faster,

62
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:22,556
so really,

63
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,258
what's the point?

64
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:27,803
What are you doin' here?

65
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,722
I've missed you.

66
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:33,698
It's been so long.

67
00:06:47,436 --> 00:06:48,657
You're back early.

68
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,738
I loathe musicals.

69
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:54,964
They're always
so desperately cheerful,

70
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:56,290
aren't they?

71
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,150
I brought you a present.

72
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:04,631
Frances,

73
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:06,052
this is Alfred.

74
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:07,634
Alfred, Frances.

75
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,763
Hello.

76
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:10,756
Frances is in this chorus.

77
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:13,121
She has real talent.

78
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:15,037
Show him.

79
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:17,561
Right here?

80
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,354
That will not be necessary.

81
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:39,750
Don't mind him.

82
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,991
He's in one of his moods.

83
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:44,379
Again.

84
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:48,322
But I'm sure we can find a way to...

85
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:51,032
cheer him up.

86
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:55,323
I meant what I said.

87
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:57,293
No more.

88
00:07:57,988 --> 00:08:00,573
You can't starve yourself,
darling.

89
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,686
Just taste her.

90
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:14,202
She smells like...

91
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:16,953
apricots.

92
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,590
Remember those?

93
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:41,103
Leave now.

94
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:49,623
You are such
a wet blanket.

95
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,497
I don't know why I keep
bothering with you.

96
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:53,672
Why do you?

97
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:56,535
I can't stand the sight of you.

98
00:08:57,728 --> 00:08:58,828
So dramatic.

99
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:05,294
Perhaps we should head
back South.

100
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,331
This town's a cultural desert.

101
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:11,258
- It's no wonder we are so depressed.
- I'm not depressed.

102
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:16,522
I'm seeing clearly
for the first time in years.

103
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:19,975
I won't do this any longer.

104
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:21,331
It's over.

105
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:23,729
No more innocent lives

106
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,149
and bloody beds
and cruelty for sport.

107
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,598
You are a vampire.
They are food.

108
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:30,903
That's your nature.

109
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:33,274
It is your nature.

110
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:35,991
You have lost your humanity,

111
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:37,868
and you have stolen mine,

112
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,703
made me into a monster.

113
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,289
I forgot myself,

114
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:45,339
and I will have to live
with the things we've done

115
00:09:45,464 --> 00:09:46,598
for an eternity.

116
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,540
I sometimes forget
how young you are.

117
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,427
This conscience of yours,

118
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:57,763
you will outgrow it.

119
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,888
Trust me.

120
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:01,989
We will get through this

121
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:03,936
together.

122
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:08,297
I will never again be
what you want me to be.

123
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:24,415
If Sookie is hurt
in any way because of you,

124
00:10:25,255 --> 00:10:27,676
I will not stop
until I drive a stake

125
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:30,638
through whatever semblance
of a heart you have left.

126
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:32,934
It's true.

127
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:35,939
You're in love...

128
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:38,628
with a human.

129
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,655
That's so tragic it's funny.

130
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:54,072
You have got to be joking me.

131
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,867
This is the Fellowship of the Sun?

132
00:10:57,504 --> 00:10:59,108
That's their army?

133
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:02,467
Scared little boys
with bibles and crossbows.

134
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:04,211
Don't underestimate them.

135
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:06,539
Support for their movement
is growing.

136
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:09,997
Their leadership camps are overflowing
with self-righteous extremists,

137
00:11:10,122 --> 00:11:13,122
all willing and ready
to die for their cause.

138
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:15,897
That can be arranged
quite easily.

139
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:19,431
Not until we know for sure
the Fellowship has Godric.

140
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:21,659
What about your boy Hugo,

141
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:23,741
and Sookie?

142
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:27,598
- They've been in there too long.
- There's no sign of alarm.

143
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:30,873
And if Hugo were in serious danger,
I would know it.

144
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:33,531
I felt something earlier,
but it passed.

145
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:34,856
He's okay now.

146
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:37,005
Tell me,

147
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,103
what is it that you find so fulfilling
about human companionship?

148
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,914
They feel much more strongly
than we do.

149
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,217
Everything is urgent,

150
00:11:51,064 --> 00:11:52,064
exciting.

151
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,874
Maybe because their lives
are so temporary.

152
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:58,122
Yes, they certainly don't keep well.

153
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:03,152
Don't you find the prospect
of him growing old,

154
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:05,522
sickly, crippled, somewhat,

155
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:07,888
repulsive?

156
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:11,867
I find it curious.

157
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,440
Like a science project.

158
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:16,863
How does Bill Compton feel

159
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:18,963
about your interest in Sookie?

160
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:23,406
I'm not interested in Sookie.

161
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:27,547
And even less
in how Bill Compton feels.

162
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,035
My only interest is finding Godric.

163
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:33,343
Of course.

164
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:36,661
Don't look at me like that.

165
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:39,091
Do you really believe these fools

166
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,646
could overpower a vampire
such as Godric

167
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,595
and hold him for weeks?

168
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,381
Stan is sure of it.

169
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:48,030
But I have known Godric a long time.

170
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:51,728
It's hard to imagine anything
could overpower him.

171
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:58,635
Not anything human.

172
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:08,943
It just don't make sense.

173
00:13:09,742 --> 00:13:12,912
How somethin' wrong
could feel that right.

174
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,877
Hey, ain't that a song?

175
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:23,689
Don't cry.

176
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:26,322
It's my fault.

177
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:30,422
If anyone's goin' to hell,

178
00:13:32,301 --> 00:13:33,651
it's gonna be me.

179
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,809
I wanted this every bit
as much as you did.

180
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:42,402
And the strange thing is,
I don't even feel guilty about it.

181
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,673
So you're cryin' 'cause...?

182
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:50,542
Because I'm so happy.

183
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:57,335
I thought I loved Steve,

184
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:02,102
but I never even knew what love was
until you just showed me.

185
00:14:05,108 --> 00:14:06,108
That's...

186
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:07,863
intense, huh?

187
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:08,988
I know.

188
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:11,786
Right now,

189
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:13,622
here with you,

190
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,806
I feel closer to God
than I ever have.

191
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,111
Come on, we have to go.

192
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:29,242
I gotta get ready for training.

193
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,745
No, forget trainin'.
We have to go tell Steve.

194
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:33,571
What?

195
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:36,598
Vow of honesty, Jason.

196
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:38,897
Just 'cause I broke my vows
 doesn't mean

197
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:41,421
I'm ready to throw all
my beliefs out the window.

198
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:43,225
Hold on a sec.

199
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:45,698
We just can't walk in there
and tell him.

200
00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:47,193
No, we have to.

201
00:14:47,811 --> 00:14:50,663
Somehow, someday,

202
00:14:51,164 --> 00:14:52,849
God will forgive us.

203
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,685
It's the only way
we can have a future together.

204
00:14:56,298 --> 00:14:58,175
Let's just think
about this for a second.

205
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,455
A: Steve has guns.

206
00:15:00,652 --> 00:15:02,458
Then there's the lockdown
tomorrow night.

207
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,733
And secondly,

208
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,997
we're gonna be locked in this church

209
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,021
with Steve and his guns all night.

210
00:15:08,146 --> 00:15:09,640
Oh my Lord, the lock-in.

211
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:12,327
The morning ceremony.
You're right.

212
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:14,797
We have to put God's
interests before our own.

213
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:16,802
That's right.
God comes first.

214
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:19,431
But I promise you,

215
00:15:19,556 --> 00:15:22,809
when I am standin' up there

216
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,493
next to Steve,

217
00:15:26,043 --> 00:15:27,964
all I'm gonna be thinking
about is you.

218
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:29,564
Yup. Yeah, me too.

219
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:32,573
And the minute it's over,
we'll tell him, right?

220
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:35,564
Absolutely.
I can't wait.

221
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:36,969
Me either.

222
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,101
There's somethin' I have
to tell you.

223
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,228
I haven't...

224
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,955
I ain't never told nobody before.

225
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,207
Not even my best friend.

226
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:11,255
Hell, especially not my best friend.

227
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:18,769
I ain't never done it.

228
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:23,789
With a girl, I mean.

229
00:16:26,645 --> 00:16:28,495
What have you done it with?

230
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:34,689
Just myself.

231
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:39,372
So you're a virgin.

232
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:49,115
Well, big whoop.
So am I.

233
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:51,259
You are?

234
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,970
Well, just 'cause I'm a vampire,
you think I'm a slut?

235
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,616
Of course not.

236
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:58,850
I don't think you
could ever be a slut.

237
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,928
I don't think anybody is,
really.

238
00:17:05,017 --> 00:17:07,445
Some people, they just want
somebody to be with.

239
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:12,195
Well, I totally would have been a slut
if I could've gotten away with it.

240
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:14,908
Me and my friend Laurie,

241
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,836
we had this bet since eighth grade

242
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:18,676
over who'd lose it first.

243
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:20,598
I mean, she was like pregnant

244
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:22,823
before I even got my first kiss.

245
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:26,294
Man, my dad was such a dickhead.

246
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,080
So what's your excuse?

247
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:33,818
I was gonna wait, you know,

248
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:37,393
till I met the right one.

249
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:40,805
But the right one

250
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:43,645
just never showed up,

251
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:47,014
and by then I'd waited for so long,

252
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:50,522
I figured I can't just give it away
to anybody.

253
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,343
So now I'm 28.

254
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:01,863
And most girls probably think
I'm like some kind of

255
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:04,401
bisexual gay or somethin'.

256
00:18:05,463 --> 00:18:07,708
Not that I got any kind
of problem with them.

257
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:12,522
But I'm not.

258
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:15,952
Well, I'm not most girls.

259
00:18:18,517 --> 00:18:20,667
I'm not even a girl, technically.

260
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:23,804
But if you're okay with that,

261
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:28,022
I'd be your first.

262
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:32,736
You would?

263
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:40,836
Now?

264
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:42,531
No, silly.

265
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:43,730
No, not tonight.

266
00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:48,059
It's gonna be dawn. I get sick
if I don't rest during the day.

267
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,698
It's no problem.
That's great.

268
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:51,750
But,

269
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:54,289
we can cuddle if you like.

270
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,494
Just don't freak out
if I look a little...

271
00:18:58,343 --> 00:18:59,343
dead.

272
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:07,437
<i>Maybe the little rats have run off.</i>

273
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:11,331
- Joined the Fellowship themselves.
- Careful. Hugo is mine.

274
00:19:11,456 --> 00:19:13,591
Oh, please.
If you cared about him so much,

275
00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:15,744
we'd have been
in that church hours ago.

276
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:17,763
With no plan, no exit strategy.

277
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:20,297
That's why you'll never be sheriff.
You don't think.

278
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:22,076
And you're too chicken shit to act.

279
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,231
That's why we been gettin'
Godric's coffee for the last 40 years.

280
00:19:26,356 --> 00:19:27,356
And you,

281
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:30,339
Fellowship has your maker
and your telepath,

282
00:19:30,464 --> 00:19:33,145
and still you do nothin'.

283
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,425
Are you questioning my loyalty?

284
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:41,130
Just trying to return Godric
to his rightful position.

285
00:19:41,435 --> 00:19:42,347
Really?

286
00:19:43,104 --> 00:19:45,334
'Cause I think maybe you have
another agenda.

287
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,890
Maybe you think starting a war

288
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:49,938
will distract us from the truth...

289
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:52,190
That you're so starved for power,

290
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,067
you murdered Godric for his title.

291
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:55,579
That is a lie.

292
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:58,270
How dare you accuse me?

293
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:02,120
We don't know this.
There's no proof.

294
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:03,170
Not yet.

295
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:05,121
But I will find it.

296
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:07,661
And when I do,

297
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:11,976
there will be no mercy.

298
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:14,669
In the meantime,

299
00:20:15,978 --> 00:20:18,876
you two can stand here
and quibble over his position,

300
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:23,471
or run into that church
and kill them all. I no longer care.

301
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:28,288
If Godric is gone,

302
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:32,567
nothing will bring back
what I have lost.

303
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:51,922
Eggs, wake up.

304
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:56,355
Hey, gorgeous.

305
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,873
What are we doing on the couch?

306
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,776
How'd we get here?

307
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:04,154
I have no idea.

308
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:08,631
Last thing I remember was

309
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:12,816
followin' those Reese's Pieces
clothes into the woods.

310
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,420
I don't even remember coming
back here.

311
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:20,506
Me neither.

312
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:23,551
I guess that joint must have
knocked us out cold.

313
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,910
That's never happened to me before,

314
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,239
at least not from smokin' one joint.

315
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:31,497
It's happened to me
a couple times.

316
00:21:31,622 --> 00:21:33,972
Maryann's weed is some serious shit.

317
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:38,206
Yesterday,

318
00:21:38,656 --> 00:21:40,860
that weird place you took me to
with the blood,

319
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:42,884
- you couldn't...
- I got no idea what that is,

320
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,608
but I'msure it's got nothin' to do
with us gettin' high and passin' out.

321
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:48,863
Maybe we been smokin' too much.

322
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:50,788
Maybe we need to sober up.

323
00:21:54,952 --> 00:21:55,904
That's okay.

324
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:57,649
I'm high enough
just bein' with you.

325
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:02,862
Listen.

326
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:05,539
Just because you got
a little too stoned,

327
00:22:05,664 --> 00:22:07,283
that don't make you
your mama.

328
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:11,823
You're right.

329
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:16,013
Sometimes it's like you're Sookie.

330
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:20,338
Like you can read
my mind or somethin'.

331
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:23,842
I just get you, that's all.

332
00:22:58,255 --> 00:22:59,255
Mornin'.

333
00:22:59,723 --> 00:23:02,130
Refreshments?
How did y'all sleep?

334
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,127
They're coming for us,
you know?

335
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,816
That's what I thought.

336
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:08,794
Figured a pretty girl like you'd have
a vamp running off to her rescue.

337
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:10,743
We were kinda hopin' for it,
weren't we?

338
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:12,364
Yes, sir.
Bring it on.

339
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:13,897
Yeah, we're ready for 'em.

340
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:17,231
- We've been ready for a long time.
- You're gonna get yourself killed.

341
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,063
That's not threat, it's a fact.

342
00:23:19,886 --> 00:23:21,564
They've got you all
twisted up,

343
00:23:21,689 --> 00:23:22,839
with their...

344
00:23:23,294 --> 00:23:26,631
With their glamoring
and their empty promises

345
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:28,072
and their evil blood.

346
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,505
You're the ones who are twisted.
You call yourself Christians?

347
00:23:31,756 --> 00:23:33,369
Jesus would be ashamed of you.

348
00:23:37,556 --> 00:23:39,064
We're just gonna have to

349
00:23:39,189 --> 00:23:40,918
agree to disagree
on that one.

350
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:42,359
Now,

351
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:46,466
things got a little out of hand
last night,

352
00:23:48,423 --> 00:23:50,138
and I apologize for that.

353
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:52,434
I'm not the monster
that the vampire-lovin' media

354
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,723
makes me out to be.

355
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:54,894
Yeah, right.

356
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:57,843
All I want is a couple of answers,
and then I'll be happy to feed you

357
00:23:57,968 --> 00:23:59,729
a nice breakfast
and send you on your way.

358
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,522
- What do you want to know?
- Shut up.

359
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,137
We need to get out.
Tell them what they want to know.

360
00:24:04,262 --> 00:24:05,735
Her name is Sookie Stackhouse,

361
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,068
and I'm Hugo Ayers.

362
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:10,298
We were sent here by the vampires
of Area Nine to find their sheriff.

363
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:16,539
From Bon Temps?

364
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:18,873
How do you know
where I'm from?

365
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:22,623
You're Jason Stackhouse's...

366
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:25,154
sister.

367
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:26,751
Am I right?

368
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,508
You know Jason?

369
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,690
He's got
nothin' to do with this.

370
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:35,939
Come on, Gabe.

371
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,244
How do you know my brother?

372
00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:46,064
- Nice work.
- We sat down here

373
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:48,111
all night waiting for
your boyfriend to show up.

374
00:24:48,543 --> 00:24:50,439
You can play damsel in distress,

375
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:52,240
but I'm gettin' us out of here.

376
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:55,451
Hugo, do me a favor, please.
Just shut the fuck up.

377
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,431
<i>Barry.
Barry, can you hear me?</i>

378
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:03,964
<i>You've got to help me.
I need you to go to the hotel</i>

379
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:05,953
<i>and find Bill Compton
and tell him</i>

380
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:08,426
<i>I'm at Fellowship of the Sun
Church in the basement.</i>

381
00:25:08,551 --> 00:25:11,175
<i>The sheriff is here somewhere
and I'm in big trouble.</i>

382
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,094
<i>Don't ignore me.
This is a life or death</i>

383
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,842
<i>situation. Please.</i>

384
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:19,089
We need to rest.

385
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:25,714
So the minute I shut my eyes,
you can run into the sunlight

386
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,629
and destroy yourself
to save her?

387
00:25:28,422 --> 00:25:30,955
Care about you too much
to allow that.

388
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:37,243
I may love her,
but I am not suicidal.

389
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,958
I know better than anyone
what you are capable of.

390
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:52,838
Lorena, this is foolish.

391
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:57,794
We are getting weaker.
The bleeds have begun.

392
00:26:00,855 --> 00:26:03,564
You may be able
to keep me here awake

393
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:04,689
for a day,

394
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:06,887
maybe two,

395
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:09,989
but not forever.

396
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,710
You're right.

397
00:26:12,748 --> 00:26:14,398
Forever is a long time.

398
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:16,639
Then again,

399
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:19,493
I'm very patient.

400
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:34,548
And who were you gonna call?

401
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:38,509
If you will not
let me go to her,

402
00:26:40,193 --> 00:26:42,726
at least let me find
someone who will.

403
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:46,639
I am begging you.

404
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:50,816
Let me call
and wake up Eric Northman.

405
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,669
He is the reason
that Sookie's in danger.

406
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:57,377
He is also the reason I'm here.

407
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,745
He wants the girl, William.

408
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,209
Just let him have her.

409
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:20,554
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

410
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,524
- Hey, Stackhouse.
- How's it goin'? Lookin' good.

411
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,741
Hey, where you off to, Jason?

412
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,058
- Just takin' a walk.
- With your suitcase?

413
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,914
Get in the car, Stackhouse.

414
00:27:41,096 --> 00:27:43,264
- Get in the fucking car.
- Okay, okay.

415
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:44,251
Now.

416
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:56,279
With a bull mask

417
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:58,400
and these giant claws.

418
00:27:58,850 --> 00:27:59,850
Claws?

419
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:03,315
And the whole town
had these big black-saucer eyes

420
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,432
like zombies.

421
00:28:33,322 --> 00:28:34,472
Good morning.

422
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:38,024
Maryann, you okay?

423
00:28:38,202 --> 00:28:40,589
Oh, I am fantastic.

424
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:44,347
I slept outside last night
and I communed with my animal nature.

425
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:45,765
No shit.

426
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:48,861
This little fella hopped by,
and I thought,

427
00:28:48,986 --> 00:28:50,603
"Yummy. Rabbit stew."

428
00:28:51,922 --> 00:28:52,855
Poor bunny.

429
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:55,808
Feeling sorry for things
is just an excuse

430
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:57,818
not to celebrate
your own happiness.

431
00:28:58,444 --> 00:28:59,528
Speaking of...

432
00:29:03,189 --> 00:29:05,326
you two look
positively glowy.

433
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,344
What did you do last night?

434
00:29:08,986 --> 00:29:11,610
We just crashed out, I guess.

435
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:15,264
Did you throw a party here

436
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:16,863
while we were gone?

437
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,653
'Cause when we got home,

438
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:20,629
the place looked like a frat house.

439
00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:23,969
I had a few people over for drinks.
That a problem?

440
00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:27,014
It's Sookie's house,
and she can come home anytime.

441
00:29:27,455 --> 00:29:28,712
And when she does,

442
00:29:28,837 --> 00:29:30,664
She'll be grateful that you fixed

443
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:33,646
that nasty old water heater
and you took care of the place.

444
00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:36,081
You're such a good friend.

445
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:44,698
She is so fuckin' weird.

446
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:46,753
I know. Isn't it great?

447
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:54,041
You know what burns me the most,

448
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,841
is that I brought you into my home.

449
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:57,837
- I treated you like family.
- I know,

450
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,353
and I'm so sorry.

451
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:02,007
It's just that,
uh, I'm weak.

452
00:30:02,222 --> 00:30:03,372
Yes, you are.

453
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,964
I gave you a chance at salvation,

454
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:09,397
a chance to live in His holy light,

455
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:10,933
and you chose them?

456
00:30:11,122 --> 00:30:12,922
I know it was wrong.
I...

457
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,312
Wait. Who are "them"?

458
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,130
Oh, please, cut the act.

459
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:20,181
I know who you are
and who you're workin' for.

460
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:22,236
The road crew?

461
00:30:24,922 --> 00:30:26,072
That's funny.

462
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,202
Boy, I didn't think that you were
the sharpest tool in the shed.

463
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,698
Good at takin' orders,
but not too bright.

464
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:34,331
But boy, was I wrong.

465
00:30:34,522 --> 00:30:37,168
You are snakier
than a snake in the grass.

466
00:30:39,243 --> 00:30:40,124
Buddy.

467
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:45,301
You're making a mistake.

468
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,789
You're confusin' me with...
With somebody else or somethin'.

469
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:53,239
Say a prayer.

470
00:30:55,911 --> 00:30:57,511
You are going to hell.

471
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:01,115
And you are going there today.

472
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:07,322
- Take care of him.
- Yes, sir.

473
00:31:07,855 --> 00:31:10,117
Start walkin', vampire lover.
Come on.

474
00:31:25,689 --> 00:31:26,739
Hello, Sam.

475
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:30,493
Been lookin' for you.

476
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,206
Figured you would be.

477
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:38,757
- Now, what's that for?
- Come any closer,

478
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:40,779
you'll find out.

479
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:44,489
You think I'm scared of dyin'?

480
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:47,818
I know you're scared
of Maryann.

481
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:51,025
Those scars on your back,

482
00:31:52,052 --> 00:31:53,661
that how she got you
to be her whore?

483
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:56,038
It ain't whorin'
if you do it for love.

484
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:58,775
You can stop pretending
you ever gave a shit about me.

485
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,710
Honey, I ain't
talkin' 'bout you.

486
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,559
- We had fun, but...
- We had fun?

487
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:07,890
I fucking trusted you!

488
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,511
I shared parts of myself

489
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,179
I never shared with anyone.

490
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,890
How can you do this
to your own kind?

491
00:32:15,552 --> 00:32:18,480
Sam, I used to be scared
and stupid,

492
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:21,386
full of shame, just like you.

493
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,400
She could've killed me.

494
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:26,221
I deserved it.

495
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:29,656
But she saw something in me,

496
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,669
and she saved me.

497
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:34,859
Gave me a whole new life.

498
00:32:35,922 --> 00:32:38,277
No fear, no limits, just love.

499
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:41,516
Killing people,

500
00:32:41,922 --> 00:32:44,336
cuttin' out their hearts,
that ain't love.

501
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,930
You know what you are
next to Maryann?

502
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:48,097
An ant.

503
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:50,134
A flea.

504
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:53,904
- It's kinda perfect.
- If I'm so fucking insignificant,

505
00:32:54,922 --> 00:32:57,860
why is she going through all
this trouble trying to get me?

506
00:32:58,332 --> 00:33:00,130
'Cause you got away from her once.

507
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:01,855
She can't control you.

508
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:06,598
See those funny
big black-eyes folks

509
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:08,954
we were all runnin' around
with actin' all crazy?

510
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:11,624
That's Maryann's energy
inside of them.

511
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:13,397
She is drivin' them

512
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:15,226
like tiny little remote control

513
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,410
airplanes.

514
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:19,390
But that don't work on us

515
00:33:19,822 --> 00:33:21,332
'cause we're shifters?

516
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:24,861
All supernaturals,
we got a natural resistance.

517
00:33:25,556 --> 00:33:27,598
And she can force our shifts

518
00:33:27,723 --> 00:33:29,628
and other stuff with other supes,

519
00:33:29,753 --> 00:33:31,531
but she can't get inside us.

520
00:33:32,507 --> 00:33:33,844
We gotta go to her

521
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,239
on our own free will,

522
00:33:37,689 --> 00:33:38,817
and she just

523
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,331
loves a challenge.

524
00:33:40,456 --> 00:33:41,791
I'm not a challenge,

525
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:44,572
I'm a person.

526
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,942
Well, not exactly.

527
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:54,156
I'm sweatin' like a pig.

528
00:33:54,537 --> 00:33:55,401
God.

529
00:33:55,823 --> 00:33:58,302
You want to get wet
with me one last time, Sammy?

530
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:04,273
What is she?

531
00:34:06,422 --> 00:34:08,655
What the fuck is she?

532
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,715
She's God, dumb-dumb.

533
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,732
I need to use the bathroom.

534
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:22,664
Come on, let me out of here!

535
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:23,585
Here.

536
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,464
- I'll turn my back.
- I don't need that.

537
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:30,130
- I need to get the hell out of here.
- Hugo, this is not helping.

538
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:31,850
Just sit down.

539
00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:34,017
Try to relax.

540
00:34:34,142 --> 00:34:36,532
<i>Praise his light.
Open your hearts.</i>

541
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,531
<i>I'll infiltrate the Fellowship.</i>

542
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:41,331
<i>- Absolutely not.
- Let her speak.</i>

543
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:44,081
<i>They're sending in a spy tomorrow.
I'll be with her.</i>

544
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:47,831
You.

545
00:34:49,273 --> 00:34:50,723
You're the traitor.

546
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:54,341
Maryann is not God.

547
00:34:54,574 --> 00:34:57,820
Well, she's as close to God
as we'll ever get.

548
00:34:58,837 --> 00:35:00,897
People call her all kinds of things.

549
00:35:01,022 --> 00:35:02,022
Kali,

550
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:05,744
Lilith, Isis, Gaia.

551
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,002
But what she really is, is a maenad.

552
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:12,664
What the fuck is that?

553
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:13,986
According to the Greeks,

554
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,470
maenads were handmaidens
of Dionysus.

555
00:35:17,107 --> 00:35:19,700
But they're really
a lot more than that.

556
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,618
Dionysus, the god of wine?

557
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:24,763
Maybe if you own a bar
I suppose it makes sense

558
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:27,631
that you would know that one.
But guess what else they called him?

559
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:29,164
The Horned God.

560
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:30,461
Sound familiar?

561
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:33,022
Satan?

562
00:35:33,456 --> 00:35:35,215
Dionysus, Satan.

563
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,631
It's really just a kind of energy.

564
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:39,470
Wild energy, like...

565
00:35:40,064 --> 00:35:41,972
lust, anger, excess,

566
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,431
violence.

567
00:35:43,556 --> 00:35:45,506
Basically, all the fun stuff.

568
00:35:46,055 --> 00:35:48,297
Maryann brings it out in people.

569
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:51,249
She channels it, controls it.

570
00:35:52,581 --> 00:35:54,193
She's immortal, Sam.

571
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:56,268
She never wasn't here,

572
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:01,158
so there ain't no point in fightin' her.
You see, you'll never win.

573
00:36:07,343 --> 00:36:08,874
I'm not gonna let her kill me.

574
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:13,763
Bein' a part of something divine
is worth dying a thousand times.

575
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:14,938
You'll see.

576
00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:20,156
If I give myself up,

577
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:23,830
will she go away,
leave everyone alone?

578
00:36:23,955 --> 00:36:25,465
I wouldn't bet on that.

579
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,975
She's havin' too much fun,

580
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:30,020
and this town's full
of crazies ripe for the pickin'.

581
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:33,675
She's like a pyro
in a room full of matches.

582
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,230
Just go to her, Sam.

583
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:37,991
Play nice.

584
00:36:38,628 --> 00:36:40,297
She might even let you live.

585
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,154
Stay the fuck away from me.

586
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:51,351
I used to be just like you.

587
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:54,086
Thought I was
a real emancipated thinker,

588
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:57,048
especially when Isabel
took me to bed,

589
00:36:57,874 --> 00:36:59,437
and the sex was,

590
00:37:00,689 --> 00:37:01,789
... amazing.

591
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:03,618
The best I ev... Well,

592
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,557
you know.
It's addictive, isn't it?

593
00:37:07,522 --> 00:37:09,643
To be desired
by something that powerful.

594
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,370
I'm no addict.

595
00:37:12,874 --> 00:37:16,531
Nah. I guess you wouldn't know how,
your life changes to suit them.

596
00:37:16,854 --> 00:37:18,797
You start missin' work,
can't get up

597
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:20,865
can't stand to leave them
after dark.

598
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:24,669
Before you know it, you're somebody
you don't even recognize.

599
00:37:24,794 --> 00:37:26,319
So you went
to the Fellowship

600
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,579
because you can't control yourself?

601
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,072
I begged her to turn me.

602
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,459
It was the only way we could
be together as equals.

603
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,019
But see, they don't want
us to be equals.

604
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:42,053
No, she's just been using me.

605
00:37:43,456 --> 00:37:44,556
The same way

606
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,551
- that Bill's been using you.
- You don't know Bill.

607
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:50,197
I know he and his friends
are having you do their dirty work.

608
00:37:50,322 --> 00:37:52,936
I mean, a telepath's gotta be
a real trophy for a vampire.

609
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,897
- Shut up.
- All they care about

610
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,331
is their own kind.

611
00:37:56,456 --> 00:37:58,275
That's why I joined the Fellowship.

612
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,511
So if the Newlins care
so much about you,

613
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,301
how come you're still in here?

614
00:38:03,563 --> 00:38:04,701
Face it, Hugo.

615
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:07,993
You're nothin' but
a fangbangin' traitor to them.

616
00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:13,636
Gabe, she knows everything.
You can let me out now.

617
00:38:14,703 --> 00:38:15,703
Anybody.

618
00:38:16,553 --> 00:38:17,964
Come on, let me out!

619
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,007
You're so all-fired
important to them, aren't ya?

620
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:27,997
Welcome. So glad you're here.

621
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:29,197
Praise His light.

622
00:38:29,322 --> 00:38:30,598
Cute pajamas.

623
00:38:30,723 --> 00:38:32,643
Simon, Julia.

624
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,331
This is your first lock-in, right?

625
00:38:34,456 --> 00:38:35,930
I'm excited too.

626
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:36,823
Amen.

627
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:38,357
Hey, darlin'.
Looking good.

628
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:39,863
You too.

629
00:38:39,988 --> 00:38:42,520
Well, I told you that suit
was a winner.

630
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,782
I need to talk to you in private.

631
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,285
It's about Jason Stackhouse.

632
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:51,857
Of course.

633
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,085
I'm a good soldier for Christ,
and I'm tellin' you, man,

634
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,721
there's been some kind of mistake.

635
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:03,255
You're damn right there's
been a mistake, boy.

636
00:39:04,357 --> 00:39:06,797
And it started the minute
your mama spread her legs

637
00:39:06,922 --> 00:39:09,616
and pushed out you
and your whore of a sister.

638
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,049
Don't ever...

639
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:17,187
talk about my sister.

640
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:22,401
That the best you can do,
sister fucker?

641
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:43,046
That's the best
I can do, dick brain.

642
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:57,797
Forget what I said last week.
Live in the now, baby doll.

643
00:39:57,922 --> 00:39:58,997
<i>I don't know.</i>

644
00:39:59,122 --> 00:40:00,993
'Cause I'm back

645
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:03,784
- and I'm packin' somethin'wild.
- <i>I got out of rehab.</i>

646
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:06,695
Yes or no, sweetness?
'Cause this shit is goin' faster

647
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,397
than fritters at a fat farm.

648
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:10,922
- <i>I can do half a vial.</i>
- Well, okay.

649
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:22,002
Eggs, Tara,
y'all seen Sam?

650
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,465
He ain't here.
Blew off the whole day

651
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,256
with little Miss Employee
of the Month.

652
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,598
Thank you, Jesus,
Santa Claus and Hare Krishna.

653
00:40:28,723 --> 00:40:30,969
- I need to borrow her a minute.
- Wait for me.

654
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:37,698
Excuse you. It says
"ladies" on that door.

655
00:40:37,823 --> 00:40:39,918
So what you skank ho's
doin' in here?

656
00:40:40,043 --> 00:40:41,521
Watch yourself, bitch.

657
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,689
I am.

658
00:40:42,932 --> 00:40:44,874
And I's is gorgeous.

659
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:50,614
How's your leg?

660
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:51,907
Great.

661
00:40:53,656 --> 00:40:55,952
What? I got
a powerful immune system.

662
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,598
You got powerful death wish
is what you got.

663
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,624
And we're gonna talk
about this later.

664
00:41:10,543 --> 00:41:13,178
God, I think I might have
done somethin' bad,

665
00:41:13,691 --> 00:41:16,097
somethin' real bad.

666
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,517
Comin' out of your mouth,
that's scary.

667
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:20,399
So Terry and I,

668
00:41:21,127 --> 00:41:23,281
- we've been, you know...
- Fuckin'.

669
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:27,698
Well, Lord knows
I've been pullin' out all the stops.

670
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:30,685
My hot oils,
my nasty lingerie,

671
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,856
but every time
we get cozier than first base,

672
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:36,243
he goes runnin' like somebody
lit a fire in his whiteys.

673
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,410
Okay, cut to the real bad part.

674
00:41:40,189 --> 00:41:41,506
So last night,

675
00:41:43,389 --> 00:41:46,264
I thought I'd try gettin',
a few drinks in him,

676
00:41:46,389 --> 00:41:47,564
loosen him up and,

677
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:49,797
seemed like it was
workin' pretty good.

678
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:52,334
Till I blacked out.

679
00:41:54,522 --> 00:41:55,846
You blacked out?

680
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:59,115
Hadn't happened to me
since junior prom.

681
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:04,054
The thing is...

682
00:42:06,723 --> 00:42:08,123
I think I might of

683
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,760
had my way...

684
00:42:11,888 --> 00:42:13,783
with him a little bit,

685
00:42:15,251 --> 00:42:17,102
kinda against his will,

686
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:19,028
maybe?

687
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,496
Are you telling me you
date-raped Terry Bellefleur?

688
00:42:24,395 --> 00:42:27,275
- How's that even possible?
- God, I don't know.

689
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,097
But he was just... He was acting
so weird when we woke up.

690
00:42:30,222 --> 00:42:32,910
I mean, weirder than usual.
And...

691
00:42:33,888 --> 00:42:36,661
there were certain telltale
signs that we'd...

692
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:39,389
- You know?
- And you don't remember anything?

693
00:42:50,556 --> 00:42:53,612
Now, see, that just ain't
motherfuckin' fair.

694
00:42:54,185 --> 00:42:55,185
Excuse me?

695
00:42:56,263 --> 00:42:59,492
The first time
in my goddamn life
I ain't chasin' after trouble...

696
00:43:02,361 --> 00:43:05,373
and it just keep walkin'
in my fuckin' door.

697
00:43:06,855 --> 00:43:07,955
Look at you.

698
00:43:08,443 --> 00:43:09,443
Damn.

699
00:43:10,322 --> 00:43:13,464
Ain't nothin' good can come out
of somethin' so pretty.

700
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:15,094
You must be Lafayette.

701
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:16,761
I'm Eggs.

702
00:43:18,189 --> 00:43:19,289
Tara's Eggs?

703
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,870
That just don't sound right.

704
00:43:21,995 --> 00:43:24,226
Your name's Benedict.
Why don't people call you Ben?

705
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,144
- Or Dict.
- Behave.

706
00:43:26,449 --> 00:43:28,197
Satan in a Sunday hat, girl.

707
00:43:28,502 --> 00:43:30,815
I'm tryin' to tell you,
Satan in a beautiful fuckin'

708
00:43:30,995 --> 00:43:32,445
fuckin' Sunday hat.

709
00:43:37,563 --> 00:43:38,783
Get out here.

710
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,409
I'm gonna kick your ass so hard,
you'll be shittin' boots.

711
00:43:41,656 --> 00:43:43,830
Andy, what happened to your arm?

712
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,658
I ain't talkin' to you,
devil worshiper.

713
00:43:48,633 --> 00:43:50,183
I saw you last night.

714
00:43:50,953 --> 00:43:52,087
I saw all of you.

715
00:43:52,388 --> 00:43:53,949
You...? You saw us what?

716
00:43:54,151 --> 00:43:55,454
Go ahead, deny it.

717
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:58,764
Laugh at the crazy drunk guy,
but I know what I saw.

718
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,264
He ain't here, Andy.
You want me to go call him?

719
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:04,083
Fuck you, zombie woman.

720
00:44:04,674 --> 00:44:06,602
Fuck all y'all devil zombies.

721
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,270
Turnin' this town
into a orgy from hell.

722
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,797
I'll stop ya.

723
00:44:11,332 --> 00:44:14,587
I will stop ya
if it's the last thing I ever do.

724
00:44:16,557 --> 00:44:17,862
Oh, my God.

725
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:19,459
Did you smell him?

726
00:44:21,018 --> 00:44:23,144
At least it never
gets boring around here.

727
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:24,533
Pick you up later?

728
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:31,434
You look like you just saw a ghost.

729
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,430
I was just...

730
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:11,708
decoratin'.

731
00:45:15,284 --> 00:45:17,826
I got these
at the gift store downstairs.

732
00:45:19,345 --> 00:45:20,701
Blood scented.

733
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:23,749
But to me,
they just smelled like soup.

734
00:45:26,334 --> 00:45:27,307
You like 'em?

735
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:30,545
They're perfect.

736
00:45:34,495 --> 00:45:36,316
That's what I was goin' for.

737
00:45:39,394 --> 00:45:40,994
'Cause you're perfect,

738
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:44,133
and I want your first time
to be as perfect as you are.

739
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,488
Take off your pants.

740
00:46:11,591 --> 00:46:12,591
Fuck.

741
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:13,841
Shit!

742
00:46:23,032 --> 00:46:24,197
Thank God it's you.

743
00:46:24,577 --> 00:46:26,227
Been runnin' for hours.

744
00:46:27,237 --> 00:46:29,210
Steve and Gabe,

745
00:46:29,711 --> 00:46:31,210
they've gone crazy.

746
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:32,914
They tried to kill me.

747
00:46:58,956 --> 00:46:59,956
Finally.

748
00:47:00,848 --> 00:47:02,226
I've missed you.

749
00:47:03,714 --> 00:47:04,714
Thank you

750
00:47:05,817 --> 00:47:07,167
for your service.

751
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:38,228
What happened to your face?

752
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,755
Listen, she knows everything,
which never would have happened

753
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,163
if you hadn't kept me locked
down with a goddamn mind reader.

754
00:47:43,288 --> 00:47:45,570
I hope the reverend knows that
I'm gonna need protection now.

755
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:49,616
You want protection,
you fangbangin' sack of shit?

756
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:53,100
How's that for protection, huh?

757
00:47:53,225 --> 00:47:55,416
Here's a little more
protection for ya.

758
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,706
Stop it!

759
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:04,852
You and your moron brother think

760
00:48:04,977 --> 00:48:06,811
you make an asshole out of me?

761
00:48:06,936 --> 00:48:08,353
That's what you think, huh?

762
00:48:08,478 --> 00:48:10,789
Get your filthy hands off me!

763
00:48:10,914 --> 00:48:13,167
What's wrong? Your own kind
not good enough for you?

764
00:48:13,292 --> 00:48:15,880
How about if I show you
what you've been missin'?

765
00:48:17,417 --> 00:48:19,966
... and a decade or so in Miami.

766
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,815
The beaches are gorgeous at night,

767
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,860
and the German tourists
are delicious.

768
00:48:28,317 --> 00:48:30,420
Open that door and I will end you.

769
00:48:32,173 --> 00:48:34,015
I've given you everything.

770
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,190
Everything!

771
00:48:36,035 --> 00:48:39,049
And you threw it away
moanin' over what you've lost.

772
00:48:39,796 --> 00:48:41,292
You disgust me.

773
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:42,986
Then let me go.

774
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:45,586
I made you, and you are mine.

775
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,882
You know I don't love you.

776
00:48:48,649 --> 00:48:50,133
You have never tried.

777
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:52,455
I have spent decades tryin'!

778
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:55,272
I despise myself
for what I did for you.

779
00:48:55,552 --> 00:48:57,300
God help me,
I killed innocent people

780
00:48:57,425 --> 00:48:59,102
to prove to you that I loved you.

781
00:49:00,493 --> 00:49:02,243
But it was pure nihilism.

782
00:49:05,993 --> 00:49:06,993
I do not,

783
00:49:08,744 --> 00:49:09,744
I cannot,

784
00:49:11,809 --> 00:49:13,878
I will never love you.

785
00:49:19,214 --> 00:49:21,808
Men have readily

786
00:49:21,933 --> 00:49:23,684
laid down their lives

787
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:27,015
to spend just one night with me.

788
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,850
What more can I give?

789
00:49:32,466 --> 00:49:34,721
Then what is it
that you want from me?

790
00:49:35,498 --> 00:49:36,498
Choice.

791
00:49:39,055 --> 00:49:40,123
Let me go.

792
00:49:43,031 --> 00:49:44,081
Without me,

793
00:49:45,195 --> 00:49:46,635
you would be alone...

794
00:49:48,073 --> 00:49:48,901
forever.

795
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:50,987
You're the one
that's afraid of that.

796
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:56,651
You are the saddest, loneliest
creature I have ever known.

797
00:49:57,335 --> 00:49:58,652
How dare you!

798
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:09,297
You hate me that much?

799
00:50:10,402 --> 00:50:11,402
Let me go.

800
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,046
I cannot live without you.

801
00:50:19,075 --> 00:50:20,325
You'll have to.

802
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:22,602
Don't.

803
00:50:29,637 --> 00:50:30,937
As your maker...

804
00:50:35,174 --> 00:50:36,374
I release you.

805
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,256
You released me.

806
00:50:44,187 --> 00:50:45,377
Nothing left between us.

807
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:47,767
What could you possibly have
to gain from this?

808
00:50:47,892 --> 00:50:50,723
You're making a fool
of yourself with that girl.

809
00:50:51,454 --> 00:50:53,474
You have no future with her.

810
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:56,886
Everyone knows it but you.

811
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:03,144
Someday, you'll see this
for what it is,

812
00:51:04,525 --> 00:51:06,000
an act of love.

813
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:12,110
I have a message for Bill Compton.
He there?

814
00:51:12,643 --> 00:51:13,708
I'm sorry,

815
00:51:14,185 --> 00:51:15,718
he's tied up right now.

816
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,990
I'll be happy to pass it along.

817
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,827
Tell him Sookie Stackhouse
is in the basement

818
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,812
<i>of the Fellowship of the Sun Church.</i>

819
00:51:22,937 --> 00:51:25,581
<i>She said the sheriff's there
and she's in some kind of trouble.</i>

820
00:51:30,624 --> 00:51:32,774
<i>Sookie, you hear me?
This is the last time I'm doin' you</i>

821
00:51:32,899 --> 00:51:35,129
<i>and your vampire buddies a favor,
so don't even... </i>

822
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:40,096
Yeah, show me how you scream
for that big fat vampire cock.

823
00:51:43,592 --> 00:51:44,851
Scream for me, baby.

824
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,154
Godric?
