1
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:10,519
Don't take it personally.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,133
The Were you were fighting
had vampire blood in him.

3
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:18,809
Bill's, in fact,
so I know it's strong.

4
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:22,467
Werewolves doing V?

5
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:25,900
Goes against everything
we stand for.

6
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:30,321
- The rest of the pack into that shit?
- The ones who took Bill, at least.

7
00:00:30,904 --> 00:00:33,248
Like I need more reasons
to hate them.

8
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,082
Is Debbie your ex-girlfriend?

9
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,759
She's my fiancée.

10
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:46,789
She moved out a month ago.

11
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:47,914
A month?

12
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:50,518
And you still haven't got
new furniture?

13
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:52,393
I don't have time for it.

14
00:00:54,094 --> 00:00:56,884
You ever hear from her?

15
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:00,189
My sister, Janice, does.

16
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:02,454
She runs a beauty parlor.

17
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:05,940
Debbie still goes in
to get her hair done up.

18
00:01:17,883 --> 00:01:18,994
Almost done.

19
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:39,348
Are you hurt?
I know the werewolves have you.

20
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,782
Nobody has me.

21
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:43,102
I have left my life in Bon Temps.

22
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,771
And I am leaving you.

23
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,980
Shut the fuck up.

24
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,989
The last time I saw you,

25
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:54,234
you asked me to marry you.

26
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:57,650
You did us both a favor
by not saying yes.

27
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:00,399
You have to say that.

28
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,537
Someone's listening.

29
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:03,748
<i>Lorena, actually,</i>

30
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,917
to whom I have just made love.

31
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,301
<i>Ça va, Sookie?</i>

32
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:10,796
<i>We fucked
like only two vampires can.</i>

33
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:13,900
I didn't hold back
for fear of hurting her

34
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:15,259
like I do with you.

35
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:20,702
Look at your life
since I entered it.

36
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:23,100
I've only caused you pain.

37
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:24,602
That's not true.

38
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:25,824
I am death.

39
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,523
I will bring you only suffering.

40
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:31,817
<i>Our worlds are too different.</i>

41
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:33,421
Our natures too.

42
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,363
We were doomed from the start.

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,272
I don't believe you.

44
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:40,618
<i>Believe what you want.</i>

45
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:43,293
You are no longer of concern to me.

46
00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:46,624
Do not try to find me.

47
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:48,626
<i>I do not wish to be found.</i>

48
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:37,706
What does he mean,
he doesn't wanna be found?

49
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,327
I'm pretty sure it means
he doesn't wanna see you anymore.

50
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,019
That isn't what he said.

51
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:45,325
- What do you think he said?
- I don't know what he said.

52
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,828
I just know that isn't
the man I love.

53
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,067
Maybe the man you love
never existed except in your head.

54
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,543
Is that supposed
to be making me feel better?

55
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,447
No matter how well
you think you know somebody,

56
00:04:57,572 --> 00:05:00,614
they can still turn around
and kick you right in the nut sac.

57
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,829
I don't have a nut sac, and Bill...

58
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,791
he's risked everything for me.

59
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,283
Our love is way bigger

60
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:14,063
than him breaking up with me
over the phone.

61
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,066
How many relationships you been in?

62
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:18,651
What does that matter?

63
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,279
All I'm saying is there's no nice way
of getting out of these things.

64
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,296
Come here.

65
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:35,073
Oh, my God, you're so warm.

66
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:38,462
It's okay, I'm just not used to it.

67
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:40,761
It's a Were thing.

68
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:42,654
We run hot.

69
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:47,638
I thought maybe
you were coming down with the flu.

70
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:57,314
You probably want some privacy.

71
00:05:57,571 --> 00:05:59,394
That's the last thing I want.

72
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:06,227
At least let me go put on a shirt.

73
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,757
Get back here, you little shit!

74
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,575
Were you sleeping in my parking lot?

75
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:52,404
We hadn't left yet because...

76
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:54,080
well...

77
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:56,037
we got nowhere to go.

78
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,231
We're a little behind in rent.

79
00:06:58,356 --> 00:07:00,753
Plus, our landlord
got foreclosed on.

80
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:05,215
That's why you came here.
To eat my food and steal from me.

81
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:08,346
Tommy tried to break into my safe.

82
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:09,321
Shit.

83
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:13,223
Sometimes I think that boy's cheese
done slid right off his cracker.

84
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:17,728
He does desperate things
when we fall on hard times.

85
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:20,189
When you fall?
How often does this happen?

86
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,858
I don't wanna know.
This is not my problem.

87
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:25,319
I know it ain't.
Just please

88
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,909
don't take it out on Tommy.

89
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,617
- What happened now?
- No one's hurt.

90
00:07:32,397 --> 00:07:33,911
Sam caught Tommy stealing.

91
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,355
Oh, that boy makes my ass itch.

92
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:42,086
I ain't asking for your sympathy.

93
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,171
I can't have you living
in my parking lot.

94
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,599
No, we'll be gone
the second he gets back.

95
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:48,467
He's just off somewhere
being himself up.

96
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:52,096
Won't be long.

97
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:54,306
It better not be.

98
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:07,619
Tell me everything you know
about Bill and Sookie.

99
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:10,572
She says it was love at first sight.

100
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:13,281
- You don't believe that?
- In love?

101
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:14,666
Hell, no.

102
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:17,363
People just get what they want
and leave.

103
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:18,956
And what does Sookie want?

104
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:20,550
Quiet.

105
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,835
Being a telepath gets real noisy,

106
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:25,802
and she can't hear Bill.

107
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:28,966
Her brother, is he a telepath too?

108
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,729
Jason barely knows
what he's thinking,

109
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:34,647
let alone anyone else.

110
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,474
If you keep smiling like that,
I'm gonna get jealous.

111
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:41,539
I thought I loved him
for a long time

112
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,327
but he never loved me back.

113
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:49,374
Then he is an idiot.

114
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:57,721
- Where is Sookie now?
- Jackson, Mississippi.

115
00:08:57,846 --> 00:08:59,454
- Where in Jackson?
- I don't know.

116
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:00,794
Find out.

117
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:17,211
<i>You sound awful.</i>

118
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:19,277
Bill...

119
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:21,768
broke up with me.

120
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:24,104
<i>Oh, my God.
What an asshole.</i>

121
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:27,107
Tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

122
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:30,280
No, I just need to cry my eyes out
for about a week.

123
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,071
What you need
is your best friend, right now.

124
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,573
Give me your address.

125
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:36,658
After all you've been through?

126
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,244
I don't want you
getting mixed up in my mess.

127
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:42,372
You'd do it for me. I'm getting
in the car right now.

128
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:43,662
Address.

129
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:45,461
I'm exhausted.

130
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:47,892
I'll call you tomorrow, I promise.

131
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:54,259
What do you want from Sookie?

132
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,388
You should be more concerned
with what I want from you.

133
00:09:58,932 --> 00:09:59,932
Let me go.

134
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,808
Not gonna happen.

135
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:13,251
That was the best sex
I've had in decades.

136
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:16,907
At least somebody enjoyed it.

137
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:21,815
There was true passion
between you and I tonight.

138
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,832
Any passion you felt was me
killing my love for Sookie.

139
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:28,530
It had nothing to do with you.

140
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,085
It's been a long night,
and I need to sleep.

141
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,926
Now get the fuck out.

142
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:43,757
I'm happy.

143
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:46,503
You're with me.

144
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:49,815
And you're not going anywhere.

145
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:52,981
Even if it takes 40 years,

146
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:55,988
I know you will love me again.

147
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:02,661
You can't help but love.

148
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,229
Cheese and rice.

149
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,297
You scared me half to death.

150
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,768
- What the hell are you doing out there?
- Waiting for you to invite me in.

151
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:41,491
Can all vampires fly?

152
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,368
Can all humans sing?

153
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,719
Are you kidding?

154
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:46,955
Couldn't carry a tune
in a bucket with a lid on it.

155
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:51,293
Come on in.

156
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:57,559
How goes the search?

157
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,020
Turns out,

158
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,137
he's not who I was looking for.

159
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:12,989
You smell like the ocean in winter.

160
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:15,942
How is that possible?

161
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,260
Bill doesn't smell like anything.

162
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:19,654
That's not possible.

163
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,366
You played by the North Sea
as a child.

164
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:26,884
How did you know?

165
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:29,373
I'm smelling your memories.

166
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:31,771
Not even you can do that.

167
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:36,195
I got skills you can't even dream of,
cowboy.

168
00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:55,190
You want more?

169
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,901
You want more?

170
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,029
Or I boring you?

171
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,870
That'll be all.

172
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,902
<i>... The Vampire Rights
Amendment's impending passing</i>

173
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:27,805
<i>has left many up in arms,
but perhaps none so much...</i>

174
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,630
What time you wanna head back
to Bon Temps?

175
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:35,290
Since you're not looking
for that asshole anymore.

176
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,315
I still plan on finding him.

177
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:39,609
Okay, doormat.

178
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:41,309
I'm not a doormat.

179
00:13:42,095 --> 00:13:43,822
I just want him to say it
to my face.

180
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,324
- What, he didn't hurt you enough?
- I think he's in trouble.

181
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,948
Maybe I'm wrong, but if he can
look me and tell me it's over,

182
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:51,275
then I'll leave him.

183
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,999
You looking for closure?
Just let it go, move on.

184
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,696
Says the man cooking in a wok

185
00:13:55,821 --> 00:13:57,711
because he's too sad
to buy a new frying pan.

186
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:01,840
I need more information.
Take me to that engagement party.

187
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,216
No fucking way.

188
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:06,052
I paid my debt.

189
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,128
I know you're still
hurting over Debbie.

190
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:10,932
Seeing her with those creeps
might help you get over her.

191
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,046
Are you insane?

192
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:14,286
Either one of us showing up
after last night

193
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:16,146
is just asking to get
our asses kicked.

194
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,312
You go if you gotta.
Don't put your shit on me.

195
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:27,873
Ring, ring, hooker.
Ring, ring.

196
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:30,954
Now, I know
you holing up at Sookie's,

197
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,752
but long story short,

198
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:35,179
I gots me a six-figure bucket seat

199
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:38,046
cradling my black ass
right the fuck now.

200
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:40,777
And you got yourself my old ride.

201
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,721
That's right, Buddha done did us
a 180, he did.

202
00:14:43,846 --> 00:14:46,483
Now, why don't you calls
a motherfucker back, please?

203
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,403
Shit.

204
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:15,914
You must be Janice.

205
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:17,582
And you're Sookie Stackhouse?

206
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,432
Thank you, Jesus.

207
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:22,283
I'd have settled
for a two-bit hooker

208
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:24,839
to get my brother's mind off
that bitch Debbie Pelt,

209
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,216
but you are cute

210
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:27,968
and sweet.

211
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,705
You're just what he needs.

212
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,927
Thanks for coming over.

213
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:35,868
When you called,
I was checking my horoscope.

214
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:37,413
Do you know what it said?

215
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:39,688
"Things are looking up
for somebody close to you."

216
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:41,481
Nailed it.

217
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:45,235
Don't get too excited.
Alcide and I are just working together.

218
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:48,221
You don't look like
you work construction to me.

219
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,263
Someone I care about's gone missing,
and Alcide...

220
00:15:52,006 --> 00:15:54,661
has inside information
about the folks I think have him.

221
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,749
I called you because I need to get
into Lou Pine's without standing out.

222
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,308
You need to look the part.

223
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:03,420
Well, that is my specialty.

224
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:06,674
How deep do you wanna go?

225
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,842
I wanna look like
I could kick some serious ass.

226
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:11,052
Which I can.

227
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:15,300
All right, let's pick out
some temporary tattoos.

228
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:18,148
No chance of anything more
between you and my baby brother?

229
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:19,477
I'm not really looking,

230
00:16:19,655 --> 00:16:21,273
and he's still hung up on his ex.

231
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,521
Finding out about her engagement party
did not help matters.

232
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:26,646
Yeah, right, engagement party.

233
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:28,079
Excuse me?

234
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:30,728
No, right. That's right,
engagement party.

235
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:32,633
<i>That bitch Debbie's getting herself</i>

236
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,738
<i>initiated into
that nasty pack of freaks.</i>

237
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:38,433
- How did Al find out about it?
- Hollis told him last night.

238
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:40,247
<i>Fucking Hollis and his big mouth.</i>

239
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:43,282
<i>I'm glad he didn't say nothing
about her being hooked on V.</i>

240
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:48,046
But if Alcide still loves Debbie

241
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:50,356
don't you think he should go
and try to...

242
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,261
- talk her out of it?
- No, he should not.

243
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:57,140
My psychic told him if he stayed
with her, he would get himself killed.

244
00:16:57,532 --> 00:17:00,276
Did he listen? No.
She ended up dumping his ass.

245
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:02,020
Why'd he stay with her so long?

246
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,206
She was his first love,
he never met anybody so alive,

247
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:06,316
all that shit.

248
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,547
But how many bullets
are you gonna take for somebody?

249
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:12,350
How many bad things gotta happen
to you and the ones you love

250
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:13,615
before you realize

251
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,797
feeling alive ain't enough?

252
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:20,221
I am just glad he made it out alive.

253
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:27,048
Arlene, what's happening, baby?

254
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:30,131
I'm trying to buy my crew here a round
after a long day.

255
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,384
A long day?
It's lunch, okay?

256
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,551
And I'm the only waitress working,
as usual.

257
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:37,623
You'll get your beer
when you get it.

258
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:39,015
Where's she takin' it?

259
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,600
Right here.

260
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,394
QB 1 gets the first beer.

261
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:50,257
Who's that cocky little shit?

262
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:53,530
You're mad
because he's about to break

263
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,782
your passing record.
He's close.

264
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,991
Say he's got the best arm
of any kid in Bon Temps since...

265
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,037
Well, since you.

266
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,299
What's his name?

267
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:05,624
Kitch Maynard.

268
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,732
Don't even think
about finishing that pitcher.

269
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:09,847
Fucking winning name.

270
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:11,798
Get on up here, Bud.
Get up here, young man.

271
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,594
I'm gonna keep it short.

272
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:19,472
Everything I learned
about being a good cop,

273
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:21,601
I learned from you.

274
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:24,386
You always been a hell
of a sheriff, Bud,

275
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,396
and I'm gonna miss you.
Kevin.

276
00:18:27,014 --> 00:18:30,424
We figured, since you hung up
your hat for good,

277
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:34,255
it's time
you put on your new dancing shoes.

278
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:43,427
Thank you.
They're beautiful.

279
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:48,293
It's been a great honor
serving this community.

280
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:52,547
And it's an even greater honor

281
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,491
having served with such fine men.

282
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,066
And woman.

283
00:18:56,482 --> 00:18:58,887
And it is in that spirit
that I announce to you

284
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,722
your new acting sheriff...

285
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,194
That's how you drink a beer.

286
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,858
That's a surprise.

287
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,526
And a hell of an honor.

288
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:20,127
It's Kitch, right?

289
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,202
Around here they call me QB 1.

290
00:19:22,718 --> 00:19:24,871
But you probably can't remember that
far back, can you?

291
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:27,170
- What's your name?
- Tammy.

292
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:31,169
You are smoking.

293
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:33,838
You got all them dimples.

294
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,590
I'd have made out with you,

295
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,133
but unfortunately for you,

296
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,761
you're with a disrespectful
fucktard...

297
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,563
... who's causing a ruckus
when a fine, upstanding citizen

298
00:19:43,688 --> 00:19:45,409
is getting all commemorated.

299
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:51,731
You think you're a rock star,
don't you?

300
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,483
World at your feet,

301
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,716
folks serving you beer underage.

302
00:19:55,871 --> 00:19:59,155
Girls sucking your cock whenever
you say go. No offense, Tammy.

303
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,818
You ain't nothing, boy.

304
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,077
You'll find that out soon enough.

305
00:20:04,397 --> 00:20:07,914
Yeah, well, come end of season,
they'll be shouting my name,

306
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:10,083
and they'll forget you ever existed.

307
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:14,693
But 10 years from now,

308
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,938
there's gonna be a version of you,

309
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:19,217
10 years younger,
doing the same thing to you.

310
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,220
And then who you gonna be?

311
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:23,555
What?

312
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:26,151
Yeah, that's right.
You heard me.

313
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:30,270
Touchdown.

314
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:33,329
Well, I guess the only way
to get a promotion in this town

315
00:20:33,454 --> 00:20:34,649
is to drink like a fish,

316
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:36,776
hallucinate farm animals,

317
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,055
and kill a black man.

318
00:20:38,432 --> 00:20:39,432
Promotion.

319
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:42,074
Pig!

320
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,526
- Here, let me help you.
- God, you wanna help me?

321
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:49,163
How about doing your job, boss?

322
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:53,793
Right now I'm a hostess,
waitress, bartender,

323
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,337
busboy,
because everybody you hire

324
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,125
comes to work whenever they fucking feel
like it or ends up dead.

325
00:21:00,331 --> 00:21:02,455
And I've got enough
on my plate without...

326
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,951
I'll get someone else in here
soon enough, okay?

327
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:08,411
You have got to start looking
out for your own, Sam.

328
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,300
In here.

329
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:26,292
I guess my sister took to you.

330
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:29,913
Debbie's getting initiated into
Coot's pack, and she's addicted to V.

331
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,681
Shut the fucking door.

332
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,875
Debbie's a bloodhead?
How'd you find out?

333
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,710
I was poking around
in Janice's brain.

334
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:38,626
She didn't tell you
because she's trying to protect you.

335
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,836
- Why don't you let her?
- Because I know you care about Debbie.

336
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:45,094
No matter what she did to you.
You'd wanna know if she were in danger.

337
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,960
She's gonna let
those fucking mongrels brand her.

338
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:51,059
- V's the only reason. It's gotta be.
- Of course it is.

339
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,782
Maybe it's not too late
for you to get through to her.

340
00:21:53,907 --> 00:21:55,438
Stop her from ruining her life.

341
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:56,558
Fuck!

342
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,485
That mean you're coming with me?

343
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,238
I probably won't get in otherwise.

344
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:06,241
Fine.

345
00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:08,743
We're gonna have to go
in separate, though.

346
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:11,467
You might be able to fool some
with that getup.

347
00:22:11,592 --> 00:22:14,716
They're just gonna
beat the shit out of me, again.

348
00:22:20,823 --> 00:22:23,389
How long did you work
for Sophie Anne?

349
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,347
- Thirty-five years.
- As?

350
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:29,189
I was a procurer.

351
00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:32,588
Were you any good?

352
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,103
I received no complaints.

353
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:38,898
And then you started sampling
the local flavor in Bon Temps.

354
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:41,401
I was on sabbatical.

355
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,870
Well, now you're
playing coy, William.

356
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:48,157
So which is it you doubt,
my intentions

357
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,131
or my power?

358
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:57,125
Can you assure me that you will be able
to usurp her territory?

359
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,613
That depends
on the quality of your information,

360
00:22:59,738 --> 00:23:01,004
now, doesn't it?

361
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,331
I insist.

362
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:11,723
"A woman

363
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,241
"is only a woman,

364
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,782
"but a good cigar

365
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:18,646
"is a smoke."

366
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:22,657
Rudyard Kipling.

367
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:26,077
No Shakespeare, but less impetuous.

368
00:23:27,212 --> 00:23:28,865
And he never stole spoons.

369
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:33,286
Your Majesty,

370
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:35,576
if I am going to sign
my own death warrant

371
00:23:35,701 --> 00:23:37,206
I will need something in return.

372
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,362
When I have fulfilled my duties,

373
00:23:45,255 --> 00:23:46,705
I want Lorena gone.

374
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:48,443
Gone?

375
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,377
It is a punishable offense
to kill another vampire.

376
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:56,184
Not if no one reports it.

377
00:24:07,935 --> 00:24:09,135
Eric Northman,

378
00:24:09,835 --> 00:24:11,835
the queen's sheriff of Area 5,

379
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:14,753
has been selling vampire blood,

380
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,470
and I believe it is at her behest.

381
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,168
If the Magister finds out,
he'll put her on trial.

382
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,421
He's been itching
for another inquisition for centuries.

383
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:28,132
Why on earth would she be so stupid?

384
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:30,187
The Great Revelation.

385
00:24:30,827 --> 00:24:34,512
She's close to losing her fortune
now that we're being taxed by the IRS.

386
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:41,437
Tug on the purse strings,
you'll find a lady's heart.

387
00:24:49,516 --> 00:24:51,030
That's very nice, Bill.

388
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:53,504
Very nice.

389
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,470
I feel like celebrating.

390
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:25,974
Missed you.

391
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:39,412
You miss me?

392
00:25:48,832 --> 00:25:50,132
Did you miss me?

393
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:01,695
I can't stop thinking about you.

394
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:05,021
Something about you is just so...

395
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:07,361
What's the word?

396
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,834
Motherfucker.

397
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Magical.

398
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:24,039
We have so much ahead of us.

399
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,259
When people come in, first thing,
count how many of them there are.

400
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,003
More than two always gets a table,
never the bar.

401
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,429
So say there's three.

402
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:41,724
Pull out one, two, three menus
and walk them to their table.

403
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,982
What about the waitressing part?

404
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,188
You gotta be 18 to serve alcohol.

405
00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:50,483
That is so not fair.
I'm never gonna be 18.

406
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,027
I used to be the best server
at our church pancake night.

407
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,907
- Think you can handle it?
- I'm a vampire, not a fucking idiot.

408
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,741
Hi, welcome to Merlotte's.
Table 5's available.

409
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:03,706
If you'll just follow me
right this way.

410
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,991
A hostess ain't gonna help me
with my workload.

411
00:27:10,116 --> 00:27:12,451
And she sure as heck ain't
helping herself to my tips.

412
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:13,464
Calm down.

413
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:16,020
I put an ad for another waitress.

414
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:18,261
No one said anything
about Jessica getting tips.

415
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:20,471
People love giving redheads tips.

416
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,600
And I've always been
the only redhead at Merlotte's, Sam.

417
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,968
You know that.

418
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:28,451
Sorry.

419
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:32,279
I get a little emotional when I'm...

420
00:27:33,328 --> 00:27:35,069
When I see people

421
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,149
taking advantage of you.

422
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:39,962
What are you talking about?

423
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:43,214
You let in every stray, Sam.

424
00:27:43,612 --> 00:27:45,926
First that old dog,
and then your folks,

425
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,562
and now Jessica.

426
00:27:48,064 --> 00:27:50,918
I mean, it's your business.
It's not a charity.

427
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,554
I can take care of myself.

428
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,380
My folks won't be
coming around anymore.

429
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,258
You sure they know that?
They're grilling in the parking lot.

430
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:04,269
One thing's for sure:

431
00:28:04,394 --> 00:28:06,780
we'll never be as bad
of parents as they are.

432
00:28:06,905 --> 00:28:08,936
Your server will
be right with you, all right?

433
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:11,877
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

434
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:20,531
- No, you've got me confused, I think.
- Jessica, it's Chip from Bible study.

435
00:28:24,184 --> 00:28:25,786
Hi. Oh, my God.

436
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:30,261
I can't believe you're alive.
Your folks are gonna be so happy.

437
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,855
- My God, it's a miracle.
- Yeah, I guess so.

438
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,505
Praise Jesus. Praise him.

439
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:41,818
You shitting me?

440
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,365
My little brother
just got busted dealing dope.

441
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,564
You won't find a better product.

442
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:49,393
- You a cop?
- No, sir.

443
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:51,828
I know your boy's a lean,
mean selling machine.

444
00:28:51,953 --> 00:28:53,564
I'm just here to up your game.

445
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:55,441
Help you step up in the world,

446
00:28:56,244 --> 00:28:57,694
clean some shit up.

447
00:28:58,193 --> 00:29:00,272
I'll go grab the Dirt Devil
from Felton.

448
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,281
- See if he's hungry too.
- I ain't his mama.

449
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:09,413
What do you say?

450
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,681
You feel me?

451
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:16,604
Nothing this hot
will cost you this little

452
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:18,775
and earn you so much.

453
00:29:20,353 --> 00:29:22,889
We're not getting in business
with people like you.

454
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:24,821
People like me?

455
00:29:25,704 --> 00:29:27,556
- Look...
- No, you look, son.

456
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:32,658
Polite's in short supply around here.
It's time you get your ass home.

457
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,234
Ain't you pretty, princess?

458
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:42,113
- Get the fuck up out my ride.
- How about no?

459
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:44,865
- How about I whup your fucking ass?
- Faggot.

460
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,875
I told you we ain't
so polite around here.

461
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,454
How'd you end up
in Bon Temps tonight?

462
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,865
I was just on my way home
back from picketing

463
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,552
the baby-killer factory
up in Birmingham.

464
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:14,998
Stopped for a bite.

465
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:17,525
You wanted to stop for a bite

466
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,442
but you decided it was too late,

467
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,193
so you drove straight home.

468
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:23,483
It is late.

469
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,815
Then you got a little lost
on the 165,

470
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,249
and that's why you got home
a little late

471
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:32,538
and a little hungry.

472
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:35,049
And you never even saw me.

473
00:30:37,347 --> 00:30:39,128
I hate being hungry before bed.

474
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,097
Take that.

475
00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:59,153
Get your fucking hands off me,
dead man.

476
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,651
- Take the deal.
- You'll have to kill me first.

477
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,946
I think I'll kill
all your brother-cousins first.

478
00:31:06,675 --> 00:31:09,408
- How does that sound, Lafayette?
- That sounds good.

479
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:12,097
- Excellent.
- We'll sell.

480
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,205
Just let me fucking go.

481
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:19,223
And that's called closing the deal.

482
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:24,434
Let's go, RuPaul.

483
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:29,044
Get the fuck up out of here.

484
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,847
What do you want
with Sookie and Bill?

485
00:31:35,972 --> 00:31:36,972
Nothing.

486
00:31:38,193 --> 00:31:41,197
My employer's interested in them.
Him, mostly.

487
00:31:41,905 --> 00:31:44,317
That where we're going?
To your employer?

488
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:48,781
"Slappy's Snack Shack, five miles.
Persimmons and cherries."

489
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,786
If there is one thing
that I miss more than sunshine,

490
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:56,163
it is good fruit.

491
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,721
Where are you taking me?

492
00:31:57,846 --> 00:32:00,077
Here I am trying to make
pleasant conversation,

493
00:32:00,202 --> 00:32:01,752
and you wanna ruin all my surprises.

494
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:05,618
There ain't nothing pleasant
about being bitten and tied up.

495
00:32:05,743 --> 00:32:06,799
You're tough.

496
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:09,134
I could taste it in your blood.

497
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,508
I'm not a bad guy, Tara.

498
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:15,140
I just wanna make sure
that we have a chance.

499
00:32:16,627 --> 00:32:19,395
Untie my hands.
I'll give you whatever chance you want.

500
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,221
Are you like this
with your other boyfriends?

501
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:24,275
This is kidnapping.

502
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,194
This is opportunity.

503
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:31,247
My job supports my financial needs.

504
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,016
My emotional ones.

505
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:38,789
It's just there's so much
I wanna tell you.

506
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,954
Then tell me where we're going.

507
00:32:41,534 --> 00:32:43,034
I've been so lonely.

508
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,933
But now you're mine...

509
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:48,777
all that's changed.

510
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,785
I figured the sooner you left Bon Temps,
the happier you'd be.

511
00:33:18,086 --> 00:33:19,955
Unless you plan
on stealing from me more.

512
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,926
You don't know shit about me.

513
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:30,097
I know you got
a pretty raw deal with your folks.

514
00:33:32,462 --> 00:33:34,562
I know you think I got off easy.

515
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,226
Why'd you even look us up, anyway?

516
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:46,290
When I was your age...

517
00:33:48,136 --> 00:33:49,486
I had no example.

518
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,056
And everything I did...

519
00:33:56,725 --> 00:33:58,775
Shit that was worse
than stealing, by the way.

520
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,063
... I did blind.

521
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:02,873
And I survived,

522
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:06,282
but it caught up with me so bad,
sometimes I wished I hadn't.

523
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:09,797
Guess I wanted to see
how different it could have been.

524
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:12,633
And now that you have?

525
00:34:14,236 --> 00:34:16,675
I see that I can't get back
what I lost.

526
00:34:18,115 --> 00:34:19,709
But you're still young,

527
00:34:21,247 --> 00:34:23,765
and you don't have to make
the same mistakes.

528
00:34:24,848 --> 00:34:26,527
And you could stay with me.

529
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:30,109
- I could set you up at the bar.
- You don't get it.

530
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:33,474
My folks are fucked up,
but they can't get by without me.

531
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,156
Now, I know it feels like that,
but they're not your problem.

532
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:37,533
That's all they are.

533
00:34:37,964 --> 00:34:39,564
I ditch them tomorrow,

534
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,912
they end up in the gutter
by the end of next week.

535
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:43,664
You think I can live with that?

536
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:50,129
I won't be free of these people
until the day they die.

537
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,468
I have to say
I'm a little disappointed, Lafayette.

538
00:34:56,782 --> 00:34:58,300
I pegged you as a professional,

539
00:34:58,425 --> 00:35:02,072
but clearly, you lack
the necessary artistry.

540
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:06,224
Bossman, have you seen this face?

541
00:35:06,922 --> 00:35:08,397
It ain't nothing but art.

542
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,565
You walk into every situation
all flash and fire.

543
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,790
You expect them to adapt to you.

544
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:15,780
That's not salesmanship.

545
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:17,399
It's ego.

546
00:35:23,193 --> 00:35:24,913
- What?
- <i>We're being raided.</i>

547
00:35:34,953 --> 00:35:36,759
<i>That is the Magister.</i>

548
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,820
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

549
00:35:49,043 --> 00:35:51,492
Magister.
What a pleasant surprise.

550
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,075
There's nothing pleasant about this.

551
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:55,778
This...

552
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,679
is blasphemy.

553
00:35:59,183 --> 00:36:00,183
Take her.

554
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,222
I know I ain't got no fangs,

555
00:36:04,347 --> 00:36:06,782
and I know I can't talk
whatever language

556
00:36:06,907 --> 00:36:09,834
that is you talk in,
but I can move your shit.

557
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:16,340
Oh, hell.

558
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,843
How am I supposed to deal
with this fucked-up-ness?

559
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,557
I wanna be a cop.
A real one.

560
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:29,228
- That's good, Stackhouse.
- I've been old Jason long enough.

561
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:33,941
Apply yourself like I told you.
Someday you might make a good one.

562
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,979
No, I don't think you're hearing me.

563
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,863
You see, I'm not doing
them fake ride-alongs

564
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:45,588
and filling out forms.

565
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:48,903
I'm thinking
there's gotta be an easier way.

566
00:36:49,028 --> 00:36:51,523
You've been thinking
that way your whole life, Stackhouse.

567
00:36:51,648 --> 00:36:53,248
Where's it gotten you?

568
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,311
You're gonna make me a cop,
and you're gonna make me one now.

569
00:36:58,436 --> 00:37:01,336
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.
There's rules.

570
00:37:02,216 --> 00:37:03,466
There any rules

571
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,652
about taking
TV interviews and promotions

572
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,040
for not shooting a killer dead

573
00:37:09,316 --> 00:37:11,400
when I'm the one who's gotta
live with doing it?

574
00:37:11,525 --> 00:37:12,942
Any rules about that?

575
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:15,406
I push this, it'll blow up
for the both of us.

576
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:18,311
You know, I read something
in all that cop homework

577
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:21,952
about when you make up stories
about murderers and crimes.

578
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,503
What do they call that again?

579
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:27,268
Falsifying evidence.

580
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,946
Falsifying the evidence.

581
00:37:31,743 --> 00:37:32,943
Last few days,

582
00:37:34,204 --> 00:37:35,904
shooting a known killer,

583
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:38,088
tackling a drug dealer in Hotshot.

584
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,812
I'm already the best cop you got,

585
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:44,827
Sheriff Andy Bellefleur.

586
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:53,672
Shit.

587
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,310
These dogs plumping up real good.

588
00:38:00,894 --> 00:38:02,094
There you are.

589
00:38:02,696 --> 00:38:04,489
Boy, I'll whup you.

590
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,311
Now, here's what's gonna happen.

591
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,336
I'm gonna give you a place to stay

592
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:20,339
for now
till you get back on your feet.

593
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,590
No more stealing,

594
00:38:23,408 --> 00:38:24,822
no more drinking,

595
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:28,445
- or the deal's off.
- I think we can manage that.

596
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:32,452
Don't see why not.

597
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,105
Think you can fly
straight from now on?

598
00:38:39,228 --> 00:38:40,651
Supposed to be a joke.

599
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:46,105
Maybe I can.

600
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,350
- Not you.
- Russell's expecting me.

601
00:38:56,764 --> 00:38:58,593
He's out.
He'll be a while.

602
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:00,472
We'll wait.

603
00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:04,695
Is this for me?

604
00:39:08,865 --> 00:39:09,965
It's skinny.

605
00:39:28,863 --> 00:39:31,159
<i>It's a private party.
Hollis ain't here.</i>

606
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:33,717
<i>We're on our own.</i>

607
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,074
- Shoot it.
- No, thanks.

608
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,302
<i>She looks familiar.
Did I bang her?</i>

609
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:51,805
Fuck, yeah!

610
00:39:56,716 --> 00:39:57,978
- Again.
- Again.

611
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,015
One more.
Third time's the charm.

612
00:40:12,171 --> 00:40:13,785
Who the fuck are you?

613
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,457
She's with me, Debbie.

614
00:40:26,782 --> 00:40:29,282
In the mood for anything
in particular?

615
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:31,631
Someone smoky.

616
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:33,722
Not too fatty.

617
00:40:34,094 --> 00:40:35,694
See, I was thinking...

618
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:37,893
ethnic.

619
00:40:40,911 --> 00:40:43,270
You said you were a procurer?

620
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:53,269
Procure.

621
00:40:54,636 --> 00:40:55,736
As you wish.

622
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,018
Let her go!

623
00:41:11,578 --> 00:41:12,886
I am who you want.

624
00:41:13,955 --> 00:41:15,634
But I have been framed.

625
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:19,017
"You've got the wrong man."

626
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,826
"My dog ate my homework."

627
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:22,729
"I saw Goody Osburn with the devil."

628
00:41:24,379 --> 00:41:27,609
Excuses are one thing I can assure you
do not get better with age.

629
00:41:28,905 --> 00:41:31,205
Do you deny the blood was being sold

630
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:34,019
in your area?

631
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,544
Not on my orders.

632
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,230
Then on whose?

633
00:41:40,607 --> 00:41:41,757
Your queen's?

634
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,661
What shall it be, sheriff?

635
00:41:53,002 --> 00:41:55,054
Desecration of the blood

636
00:41:55,812 --> 00:41:58,843
or treason against your regent?

637
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,979
Both among the most dire of crimes.

638
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,160
It was Bill Compton!

639
00:42:16,414 --> 00:42:18,364
It's true. He's gone missing.

640
00:42:19,511 --> 00:42:22,414
You've seen yourself how easily
he betrays our kind for personal gain.

641
00:42:22,947 --> 00:42:24,677
I believe he is behind this,

642
00:42:24,802 --> 00:42:27,502
and I am gathering evidence
to bring him to you.

643
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,070
Now let me finish my work.

644
00:42:34,626 --> 00:42:36,526
They say the loss of a child

645
00:42:37,728 --> 00:42:39,528
is the deepest of despair.

646
00:42:42,207 --> 00:42:43,518
Two days, Mr. Northman,

647
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,413
or she dies.

648
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,298
A true death.

649
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,119
You thought this
knight-on-a-white-horse shit would work?

650
00:43:01,675 --> 00:43:03,914
- With me?
- What have you done to yourself?

651
00:43:04,178 --> 00:43:05,978
I finally got free of you.

652
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:08,293
And I never been happier in my life.

653
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:09,794
I still care about you.

654
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,965
- The pack will never let you back in.
- I don't need your pussy pack.

655
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,766
And I was fucking Coot
when I was still with you.

656
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:21,067
- This isn't about us.
- Like hell.

657
00:43:21,407 --> 00:43:24,726
You came here and brought this skank
just to make me jealous.

658
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:25,894
Skank?

659
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:28,313
Well, coming from you,
that's just funny.

660
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,498
You did not just say that to me
at my own fucking party.

661
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,637
Alcide came here despite
every good reason in the world not to

662
00:43:36,762 --> 00:43:39,133
because he believes
the woman he fell in love with

663
00:43:39,258 --> 00:43:41,326
still lives inside you somewhere.

664
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,046
He's willing to risk his life
to make sure you hold on to her,

665
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:45,716
even if he doesn't get to.

666
00:43:47,106 --> 00:43:48,506
It isn't too late.

667
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,212
We can get out of here right now.

668
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:55,465
What the fuck is this?

669
00:43:55,738 --> 00:43:59,094
- It's just a conversation, Coot.
- She's all done with you, Herveaux.

670
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,597
She went and found herself
a real wolf.

671
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,100
Come on.

672
00:44:05,491 --> 00:44:06,893
Let's do this shit!

673
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,311
Leave him alone, Coot.

674
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,440
- Let him stay.
- No way in hell.

675
00:44:13,035 --> 00:44:14,484
He needs to see this.

676
00:44:14,797 --> 00:44:16,625
He ain't never gonna let us b baby,

677
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,286
till he understands
I'm with you for good.

678
00:44:53,745 --> 00:44:55,636
He's one of the ones who took Bill.

679
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:00,324
I have...

680
00:45:01,656 --> 00:45:03,306
an errand to attend to.

681
00:45:05,692 --> 00:45:08,580
If I'm not back before Mr. Compton
returns with our dinner,

682
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,832
you feel free to start without me.

683
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,172
Who's that?

684
00:46:32,686 --> 00:46:34,086
Russell Edgington.

685
00:46:34,322 --> 00:46:36,964
He's a rich antiques dealer here.

686
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:06,004
What's a vampire doing
in a wolf den?

687
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:08,700
Why are they submitting
to this fanger?

688
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:25,299
He supplies them.

689
00:47:26,445 --> 00:47:28,253
Holy shit.

690
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,641
Not tonight, pumpkin.

691
00:47:43,108 --> 00:47:44,235
Otherwise

692
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,488
your brand don't last.

693
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,510
Tonight...

694
00:47:54,947 --> 00:47:58,041
you continue the grand tradition
of expanding our pack.

695
00:47:59,268 --> 00:48:00,668
My contribution

696
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:03,986
is but a small token of gratitude

697
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,133
for our collaboration
throughout the ages.

698
00:48:08,822 --> 00:48:09,719
The ages?

699
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:15,975
Drink.

700
00:48:28,922 --> 00:48:31,123
I leave you amongst your own

701
00:48:31,968 --> 00:48:33,118
to celebrate.

702
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,052
All yours.

703
00:49:11,092 --> 00:49:12,841
- Shy?
- Perhaps.

704
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,593
I'll take good care of you.

705
00:49:25,478 --> 00:49:27,528
- What's your name?
- Destiny.

706
00:49:29,264 --> 00:49:30,508
What is your real name?

707
00:49:31,592 --> 00:49:32,592
Camilla.

708
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,101
What is your name?

709
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:41,981
Ann.

710
00:49:42,106 --> 00:49:44,731
What does your husband think
about your profession?

711
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:47,483
- No husband.
- Children?

712
00:49:47,814 --> 00:49:50,253
Never wanted any.
World's too fucked up.

713
00:49:52,424 --> 00:49:54,646
- And your family?
- Told me I wasn't worth nothing.

714
00:49:54,771 --> 00:49:58,328
- I figured they ain't worth knowing.
- Perhaps you're right about that.

715
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,206
No point anyway.

716
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:03,708
What?

717
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,076
Loving anyone,

718
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:07,629
anything.

719
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:11,729
Feels good at first,
but it always turns to crap.

720
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:16,304
I know the truth about life.

721
00:50:18,524 --> 00:50:20,671
It's a hell I'll never
get out of alive.

722
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,078
No one does.

723
00:50:47,964 --> 00:50:49,128
Debbie, you dumb bitch.

724
00:50:56,058 --> 00:50:57,720
This is so fucking wrong.

725
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,471
What's happening?

726
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,732
Are they all shifting?

727
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,935
You need to get out of here.

728
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,649
Sookie, run. Run!

729
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,183
What have we got here?

730
00:52:03,475 --> 00:52:05,625
So, what kind of party we having?

731
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:28,703
- Ladies first.
- Why, thank you, Russell.

732
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,212
Please join us.
