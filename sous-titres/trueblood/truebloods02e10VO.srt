1
00:00:54,892 --> 00:00:56,347
Godric is gone.

2
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:57,891
I know.

3
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,792
I'm so sorry.

4
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:14,341
What are you dreaming about?

5
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:22,712
This kind of reminds me

6
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:25,175
that bus ride back from All-State.

7
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:28,578
Nothing looks exactly
the way I left it.

8
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,232
Know what I mean?

9
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:32,818
I've never been away before.

10
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:36,267
Seems like something's
different to me though.

11
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:45,789
What the hell?

12
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,922
Look at this guy.

13
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,593
Let go!

14
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:06,519
He just ran right in front of me.

15
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:12,399
Are you all right?

16
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,155
What the hell's wrong
with your eyes?

17
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,323
Let's go.

18
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:22,894
- Wait, wait, where you going?
- We gotta find Sam!

19
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:24,286
It's almost time, man.

20
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,076
Sync: mpm & Arrow

21
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:09,767
What do you think?

22
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:12,561
I think you've outdone yourself.

23
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:20,903
Feathers.

24
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:22,078
Perfection.

25
00:05:28,175 --> 00:05:30,507
I'm thinking

26
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:33,169
more meat.

27
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,451
Five more pounds of ground chuck?

28
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,430
Think about who this is for.

29
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:42,007
Let's aim higher.

30
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:44,343
Corn-fed Kobe it is.

31
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,529
You're finally getting it, Karl.

32
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,427
I want the two of you to bring me

33
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:52,344
the most expensive meat.

34
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:54,228
Organs,

35
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,896
kidneys, livers,

36
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,933
anything you can find.

37
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:00,776
You want us to go kill something
so it's extra fresh?

38
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,302
No, don't worry.

39
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:07,658
I have other people bringing us
something living to sacrifice.

40
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,003
Any sign of anybody outside?

41
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:29,263
No bug-eyes here.
Just a hangover.

42
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,430
Thanks for going over there.

43
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:33,442
Station was totally empty.

44
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,128
Cells were all wide open.

45
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:36,729
They think I'm a bad cop.

46
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:39,444
You should see the square.

47
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,441
Looks like New York City
or something.

48
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:43,568
People banging their heads on posts.

49
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:45,612
Graffiti everywhere.

50
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:48,855
People pissing all over
the sidewalk.

51
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:51,285
This whole town's
going down the crapper.

52
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,103
Yeah, trust me, I know.

53
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,749
I got no idea how we're going
to deal with a goddamn maenad.

54
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,186
A mae-what?

55
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:03,846
Wait,

56
00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:06,383
you don't remember
any of what I told you last night,

57
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,326
before you passed out
and spent the whole fucking day in bed,

58
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:11,138
sleeping off your bender?

59
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:12,313
You said...

60
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:15,391
Maryann Forrester
was to blame for all of this.

61
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:18,020
The bug-eyes and the craziness.

62
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:20,266
Yeah, and the people showing up dead

63
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:21,953
with their hearts cut out.

64
00:07:22,078 --> 00:07:24,193
- In the back seat of your car?
- She did that?

65
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,072
She killed Daphne too.

66
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,365
Fuck me.

67
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:34,077
We got another serial killer.

68
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:37,475
Listen.

69
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,687
She is a supernatural creature.

70
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:43,921
She is immortal.

71
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:45,645
She has powers.

72
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:48,022
And she's not leaving
till she gets what she wants,

73
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:49,383
which I think is me.

74
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,678
What's she want you for?

75
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:56,558
I think to cut my heart out
while a bunch of naked people watch,

76
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:58,060
all for...

77
00:07:58,813 --> 00:07:59,813
Dionysus

78
00:08:00,377 --> 00:08:02,397
or Satan, or some God who has horns.

79
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:07,214
People thought I was crazy
because I thought I saw a pig.

80
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:08,736
Well, you did see a pig.

81
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,841
And you were right.
That pig was a part of all this.

82
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:13,216
That pig was...

83
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,727
doing some of Maryann's
dirty work for her.

84
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:20,998
Well, if what you say is true,

85
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:23,460
we need to kill that bitch.

86
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:25,844
She don't die, remember?

87
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,886
Sam, come to Merlotte's.

88
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:38,691
<i>Calm down.
Tell me what's wrong.</i>

89
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:40,248
There's a mob.

90
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:43,304
They've got Terry
and they are coming for me next.

91
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:47,651
I've already seen you all caught up
in Maryann's weirdness.

92
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,588
Jesus, I know,
but she's after us now,

93
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:51,752
and she's crazy.

94
00:08:51,877 --> 00:08:53,940
I mean,
she is Hannibal Lecter crazy!

95
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:56,243
And I'm scared she's gonna
get my kids!

96
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,253
<i>And nobody's even picking up
the phone</i>

97
00:08:58,378 --> 00:08:59,969
<i>at the sheriff's office.</i>

98
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:02,923
All right.

99
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:04,853
All right, I'll be right there.

100
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,214
This is Jason Stackhouse.

101
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,217
Just want to let y'all know
a couple a folks got hit by a car

102
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,760
up on the square.

103
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,421
But they... They ran off.

104
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,056
Ask them what the heck's
going on all over town.

105
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:21,407
And if somebody could
call me back and tell me

106
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:23,595
if we've been attacked
by terrorists or what.

107
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,159
Fucking answering machine
at the sheriff's office.

108
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:30,194
There's something seriously wrong
in Bon Temps. I can feel it.

109
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,255
If it ain't the vamper

110
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,014
and his vamper lover.

111
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:38,577
There's those fucking eyes again.

112
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:42,074
Mother, come back here.

113
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,701
Oh, thank God you're home.

114
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:46,418
- She's gone, like, totally batshit.
- What the devil...?

115
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,212
I had nothing to do with it,
I swear!

116
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,889
At first I thought maybe it was just
a bad reaction to her new diet pills...

117
00:09:52,014 --> 00:09:54,343
but practically
the whole town's got these eyes.

118
00:09:54,578 --> 00:09:57,221
- How long has she been like this?
- Since last night.

119
00:09:57,454 --> 00:09:58,578
And I will be,

120
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:02,391
for as long as it takes for him
to get his offering.

121
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,227
That sounds fucking fucked-up.

122
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:07,272
She's been on about Sam Merlotte
and how they're gonna offer him to God.

123
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,816
Offer yourself up to me,
Jason Stackhouse.

124
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:11,693
You...

125
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,156
dirty...

126
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:14,281
little...

127
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,073
monkey.

128
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,201
- Mama!
- Does she ever calm down?

129
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:21,271
Playing Wii gets her to focus.

130
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:23,079
But I wouldn't call it calm.

131
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:28,657
I'm gonna crack
open your fucking skull, bitch!

132
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:32,157
So she says God is coming?

133
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,316
Yes, and that everybody's waiting
at Merlotte's so they can catch Sam

134
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:38,091
- and take him to Maryann's.
- Maryann's? Where's that?

135
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,846
Well, it's your house.

136
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,339
What?

137
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:46,412
They're gonna rip that boy open
and serve him up like barbecue!

138
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:51,858
Has anybody been attacked
by something with claws?

139
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,280
I heard Arlene say
that that poor woman you found

140
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,405
in Andy's car had her back
scratched up pretty bad.

141
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:58,817
And then I also heard
somebody say that Daphne

142
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:00,616
had some kind
of weird scar on her back.

143
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:04,454
- The new waitress at Merlotte's?
- There's a new waitress at Merlotte's?

144
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:06,540
We should talk to her.

145
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,020
She's dead.

146
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:10,518
She had her heart cut out
just like the other one.

147
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:12,421
- Fudge!
- I'm going to Merlotte's

148
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,908
and find out what the hell
is happening on my turf.

149
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,993
If this is the same
creature we think it might be,

150
00:11:17,118 --> 00:11:19,052
you do not want to go anywhere
near it, trust me.

151
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:21,636
Mr. Compton, I ain't about
to sit back

152
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:24,098
and let monsters destroy my town.

153
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:27,810
Jason, this would be one
of those times to use your head.

154
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,287
Oh, I am.

155
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:32,315
I ain't never been so clear
in my whole life.

156
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:34,214
This here

157
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,444
is the war I've been training for.

158
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:39,156
He can take care of himself.
We've seen that.

159
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,481
Be careful, you hear?

160
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:46,586
Drive straight up to Merlotte's,
get inside as fast as you can,

161
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:48,415
and do not go into the woods
by yourself.

162
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,374
I won't.

163
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:52,452
- I mean it.
- I know. Come here.

164
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:58,050
And where's Tara?

165
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:01,845
She's been partying
pretty hard over at Mary...

166
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:05,599
It's just something that people say.
"Party over at Maryann's".

167
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,752
- I gotta get over there.
- After you.

168
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,359
- Should I have gone with them?
- And leave me alone here with her?

169
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,692
No fucking way.

170
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:28,238
You here?

171
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,499
Empty.

172
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:34,461
Like the sheriff's office.

173
00:12:36,802 --> 00:12:38,302
There's people here.

174
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:40,652
I can smell them.

175
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,245
Thank you, Sam, for coming so fast.

176
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,398
I know how much punctuality
means to you.

177
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:01,154
Are you all right?

178
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:03,324
I am now.

179
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:08,065
Because soon he'll be getting
what's his.

180
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,376
Shit.

181
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,610
Not this shit again.

182
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,691
At least shoot the cheap liquor!

183
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,885
Bottom shelf, bottom shelf!

184
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,903
We call this move
"stress inoculation."

185
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:48,976
Fuck.

186
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,162
- Come on. Back door.
- They're getting away!

187
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:00,475
Go get him!

188
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:03,178
Follow me!

189
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,481
I'll get you, Sam Merlotte!

190
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,848
Hard!

191
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,391
Cut his feet off!

192
00:14:11,948 --> 00:14:13,018
Freaks!

193
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:18,190
Motherfucker!

194
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:19,941
In here! In here!

195
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:26,072
Damn it, this door don't lock
from the inside!

196
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,200
I can't hold it!

197
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,040
Here.
Okay, that'll do it.

198
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,583
Hold up a second.

199
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:52,307
We have our EPW right where we want him.
And there ain't no place for him to go.

200
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,461
- And what does that mean?
- It means we have secured the target.

201
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:56,728
Mission accomplished!

202
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:00,649
Bodenhouse.

203
00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:03,360
Go call Maryann
and tell her she can come pick him up.

204
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,405
We are fucked.

205
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:08,839
We're still alive.

206
00:15:08,964 --> 00:15:09,964
For now.

207
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:14,788
What are we gonna do?
Are we gonna have to kill them all?

208
00:15:15,463 --> 00:15:17,873
Even if we could, these
are our friends and neighbors.

209
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,143
And cousins.

210
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:20,877
Right.

211
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:23,588
We can't kill them.

212
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:25,928
We are fucked.

213
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:31,067
Yes, we are.

214
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,039
Peanut?

215
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:53,414
<i>You sound nice.</i>

216
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:56,866
It burns where I'm tied up.

217
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,374
It burns like fire, Mama.

218
00:16:02,814 --> 00:16:04,546
Tying her up's
not making her better.

219
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,924
I done told you,
it's for her own good.

220
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:09,415
Ours too.

221
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:13,555
Tara, baby.

222
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:16,500
Tell your mama what you need.

223
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,986
Tara, you stronger than whatever
this is and you know it.

224
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:29,988
Now, get the fuck up out of there!

225
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:38,673
If only Miss Jeanette
were still alive.

226
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,857
She don't need no damn
backwoods witch.

227
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:43,752
She need Thorazine
and a padded cell.

228
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:51,426
"Bless the Lord

229
00:16:51,948 --> 00:16:53,031
"Oh my soul

230
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:56,113
<i>"And all that is within me</i>

231
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,704
"bless His holy name

232
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:00,435
"And forget not all His benefits

233
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,187
"Who forgives

234
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:05,515
"all your iniquities"

235
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,602
"Who heals all your diseases,

236
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:12,088
"who redeems your life
from destruction.

237
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:14,115
"Hallelujah, God."

238
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:21,618
Jesus and I agreed
to see other people.

239
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:24,834
But that don't mean we don't
still don't talk from time to time.

240
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,128
You've been good to my Tara.

241
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,634
I hadn't left a hole in this girl,

242
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,958
maybe whatever's in there
wouldn't have crawled in.

243
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,578
I kicked her out on her birthday.

244
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:41,747
I was feeling all poor, pitiful me

245
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:44,062
because of the shit
I had brought on myself.

246
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:46,730
If I wasn't acting like
a stupid little bitch,

247
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,979
I would have seen trouble
coming after her a mile away

248
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:50,610
and I would have handled that shit.

249
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,405
He's coming.

250
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:55,198
He's on his way.

251
00:17:56,628 --> 00:17:59,470
And he's gonna kill us all.

252
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:18,893
What in God's name...?

253
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,790
Whatever the hell it is,

254
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:23,551
it reeks.

255
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:09,233
Lafayette, where is Tara?

256
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:10,833
<i>She with me.</i>

257
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,026
I need to know
when you gonna be back.

258
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:16,529
I'm here in what used to be
my living room.

259
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,073
Sook, you gonna have to get up
out that house now.

260
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,649
Is Tara okay?

261
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,411
I ain't half as worried about her

262
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,788
as I am about you up
in that fucking house. Get out.

263
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:25,956
<i>Run!</i>

264
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:27,468
Be right there.

265
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:28,593
Come on.

266
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,419
What are you doing in my house?

267
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,739
This is not

268
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:35,297
your house.

269
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,995
It is now.

270
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:40,929
I strongly suggest
you remove yourself immediately.

271
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:44,278
My, you found yourself
quite the specimen.

272
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:46,269
Though I daresay
there's nothing stopping him

273
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,644
from one day leaving you cold.

274
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:50,313
You don't scare me.

275
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,183
Sookie, go now.

276
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,493
Ravage me!

277
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,162
Ravage me!

278
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,291
What did you do to him?

279
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,383
What are you?

280
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,593
None of your business!

281
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:27,675
Bill, let's get out of here.

282
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:32,090
That was fun!

283
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:38,048
What are you?

284
00:20:48,983 --> 00:20:51,291
Aren't you glad I didn't take
your advice and quit drinking?

285
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:53,376
This could save our lives.

286
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:57,805
And if I'd left this town
when I wanted to,

287
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
nobody'd be in this situation.

288
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,511
Don't beat yourself up, Sam.
You've been real good to this town.

289
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:07,806
Even if you are a sometimes-nudist.

290
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:13,259
What if Terry had shot that guy
in the head instead of the shoulder?

291
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,649
The people are gonna
start dying soon.

292
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,426
People are already dying.

293
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:20,626
Nancy LeVoir, Daphne...

294
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:23,740
Hell, I never even
knew her last name.

295
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:25,863
Landry.

296
00:21:31,305 --> 00:21:33,355
If that was even her real name.

297
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:37,501
I heard y'all was close.

298
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,243
I'm real sorry.

299
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:41,746
Thanks.

300
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,730
When I was growing up

301
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:46,567
I had a nanny.

302
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:48,945
Her name was Annie.

303
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:51,705
Annie the nanny.

304
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:55,669
She used to say to me that...

305
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:58,639
in the country of the blind,

306
00:21:59,308 --> 00:22:00,818
the one-eyed man was king.

307
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:05,268
I think she told me that
because she thought I was...

308
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,424
one of the blind.

309
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:09,566
But you...

310
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,830
You got the burden of being
the one-eyed man.

311
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:15,993
I envy that.

312
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:22,757
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

313
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:26,309
I don't either.

314
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:06,319
Do you know anybody
named Peanut Burch?

315
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:10,179
I wish I could remember.

316
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,640
I know there's something
I was supposed to do.

317
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,107
Harder! Harder!

318
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:18,980
Asshole!

319
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,567
Oh, mama.

320
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:29,730
That's good.

321
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:40,793
All right!

322
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,214
This party's over!

323
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,683
Come on!

324
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:02,315
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

325
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:20,540
What you gotta go do that for?

326
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:26,925
Piece of shit!

327
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:29,561
Let's go!

328
00:24:29,686 --> 00:24:30,909
Hey, asshole!

329
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,145
- Come here.
- Ambush!

330
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,230
Ambush!

331
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:44,579
Okay, stay chill.

332
00:24:45,273 --> 00:24:47,318
Nobody needs to get hurt.

333
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,196
Yeah! Nail her!

334
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,368
Wait,

335
00:24:56,743 --> 00:24:57,743
stop!

336
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,207
Don't hurt my special lady.

337
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,262
<i>Do it!</i>

338
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,377
<i>I need a haircut anyway, baby.</i>

339
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,421
Yeah, I'm gonna do it!

340
00:25:09,482 --> 00:25:10,383
Timeout.

341
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,786
Time the fuck out!

342
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:15,494
All right,

343
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:16,895
Stackhouse.

344
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,517
Name your demands.

345
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,781
Here's how it's gonna be.

346
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:24,220
Y'all go and leave,

347
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:26,232
every last one of you.

348
00:25:29,772 --> 00:25:32,488
Leave us alone
and then you can have her.

349
00:25:35,273 --> 00:25:36,273
All right.

350
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:39,453
The order is to retreat.

351
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:40,997
Immediately.

352
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,456
God damn it!

353
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,726
When I give an order, you follow it.
Now get on out of here.

354
00:25:45,851 --> 00:25:48,629
We will unfuck this situation
at a later date.

355
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:51,981
Move it! Fall out! Out! Out!

356
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:55,382
Left, right, left!
Come on, then! Double-time.

357
00:25:55,507 --> 00:25:56,507
Let's go!

358
00:25:58,243 --> 00:26:00,381
All right, Stackhouse.
You gonna hand her over.

359
00:26:00,506 --> 00:26:02,281
Keep moving. Move!

360
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:04,613
The faster you move,
the quicker you get her.

361
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:06,681
My hero.

362
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:08,931
I love it when you get
all military like that.

363
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:10,234
Where's your guns?

364
00:26:16,546 --> 00:26:17,681
I'm all right.

365
00:26:17,806 --> 00:26:20,661
No, you are not all right.
None of this is all right.

366
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:22,647
I'm calling Eric.

367
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:24,676
I will not turn to Eric.

368
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,854
I gotta get you to Dr. Ludwig!

369
00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:29,073
Sookie, what happened back there?

370
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,382
- What did you do to her?
- I don't know. I swear.

371
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:37,714
It was Maryann that attacked me
in the woods. Evenwithout a scar

372
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:40,306
I could feel her there on my back
when she was touching me.

373
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:43,309
- I will kill her.
- Good.

374
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:44,878
How?

375
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:49,914
Tara has been
under Maryann's influence.

376
00:26:50,263 --> 00:26:52,235
Maybe she can be of some help to us.

377
00:26:52,655 --> 00:26:54,805
Give me your wrist so I can heal.

378
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:07,750
Sam, it's Stackhouse.
You can come on out.

379
00:27:08,913 --> 00:27:09,835
They're gone.

380
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:13,381
Look, I got rid of all them
saucer-eyed motherfuckers.

381
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,423
Bullshit.

382
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:16,868
I swear on my gran's

383
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,052
grave.

384
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,105
- Let's see your eyes.
- My eyes? Oh.

385
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,420
Now get out here.

386
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:33,195
I locked all the doors.

387
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,523
Hey, thanks, Jason.

388
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:44,161
But... I don't think
they're gonna let up till they get me.

389
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:46,539
How the hell did you get them out?

390
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:49,181
I threatened to shoot a bunch of nails
into Arlene's brain.

391
00:27:49,306 --> 00:27:50,580
But guys, come here.

392
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:54,338
If we gonna get out of here,
we gonna need even a bigger divergence.

393
00:27:57,739 --> 00:27:59,885
There's Sam Merlotte!
Get him!

394
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,881
That ain't exactly
what I was talking about,

395
00:28:02,006 --> 00:28:03,655
but you work with what you got. Go!

396
00:28:24,342 --> 00:28:26,580
There's no escaping, Sam Merlotte.

397
00:28:26,762 --> 00:28:28,112
The God Who Comes

398
00:28:28,642 --> 00:28:30,583
always gets what he comes for.

399
00:28:32,552 --> 00:28:34,614
And as for you, Jason Stackhouse.

400
00:28:35,024 --> 00:28:36,024
Not cool.

401
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:39,633
There ain't no normal god
gonna come nowhere near you people

402
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,315
And God ain't gonna be happy
with you, Jason.

403
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,596
I bet he'll eat you.

404
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,315
 I always wanted to know

405
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,075
what human flesh tastes like.

406
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:52,441
Guys.

407
00:28:53,015 --> 00:28:54,648
You guys, you gotta save yourselves.

408
00:28:55,377 --> 00:28:56,970
We'll get you out of here, Sam.

409
00:28:57,095 --> 00:28:58,095
Then what?

410
00:28:58,605 --> 00:28:59,779
She's not gonna let up.

411
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,081
Ever.

412
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:05,534
I'm ending this.

413
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:07,536
No fucking way!

414
00:29:07,772 --> 00:29:09,956
Maybe this'll all stop with me.

415
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,529
Would you snap the fuck out of it!

416
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:48,872
This has got to be the worst
motherfucking intervention in History.

417
00:29:54,572 --> 00:29:56,267
Oh, thank God. Sook.

418
00:30:03,972 --> 00:30:06,745
- How's it going?
- Never been better in my whole  life.

419
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,076
Come back later.

420
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:11,580
There's no such thing as later
during finals week.

421
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:13,014
Calc so blows.

422
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:14,061
Excuse me.

423
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,710
Excuse me.

424
00:30:16,956 --> 00:30:18,983
I ain't selling tonight,
Cream Cheese. Okay?

425
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:20,959
Come on, I'll pay extra.

426
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:22,528
You ain't hearing me.

427
00:30:22,705 --> 00:30:25,024
<i>Well, I ain't leaving
till I get the V.</i>

428
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:29,473
You are leaving.

429
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,686
Slow your row.
It ain't even me.

430
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:39,253
Talk to your boy, Eric.
He the one got me pushing the shit.

431
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:40,838
Where is she?

432
00:30:44,461 --> 00:30:45,509
You can come on in.

433
00:30:58,339 --> 00:30:59,565
What's happened to you?

434
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:02,544
Get me the fuck out, you cunt,
or I will kill you.

435
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,240
We are losing her, Sook.

436
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,870
It's all...

437
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:22,534
dark.

438
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:24,613
Nothing.

439
00:31:25,172 --> 00:31:27,843
- You see into her head?
- Stop trying to rape my brain.

440
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,063
I can't see or hear anything.

441
00:31:31,374 --> 00:31:32,924
It's not her. It's...

442
00:31:33,508 --> 00:31:34,433
She's gone.

443
00:31:34,822 --> 00:31:36,435
Don't say that.
She in there.

444
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,604
Just... Just keep trying.

445
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:40,648
I know, but what am I
supposed to do?

446
00:31:40,852 --> 00:31:43,859
You have to go further into her mind
than you ever have before.

447
00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:58,745
You try and kill yourself?

448
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:01,252
I don't blame you,
with your fucked-up life.

449
00:32:09,705 --> 00:32:11,929
There's something I can't...
I can't cross.

450
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,430
An abyss.

451
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:16,133
- I will glamour her.
- What?

452
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:17,309
It may help.

453
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:20,479
- I don't want to hurt her.
- If we leave her like this,

454
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,565
who knows what harm may come to her.

455
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:24,973
Or us.

456
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:51,659
You can feel my influence,
can't you, Tara?

457
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,954
Don't fight it.

458
00:32:55,531 --> 00:32:56,831
Let me in, Tara.

459
00:32:58,806 --> 00:32:59,806
Let me in.

460
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:11,184
Thank you, Sam.

461
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:14,514
Thank you for giving us
all this gift

462
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:17,127
so that he can come into the world.

463
00:33:29,906 --> 00:33:31,270
<i>Silence!</i>

464
00:33:33,006 --> 00:33:34,194
<i>It is me,</i>

465
00:33:35,261 --> 00:33:36,779
<i>the God Who Comes.</i>

466
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:41,277
I have come,

467
00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:43,141
and now I am here.

468
00:33:45,805 --> 00:33:47,441
You're the God Who Comes?

469
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,696
Horns. Need horns.

470
00:33:53,006 --> 00:33:54,252
Well, go get them.

471
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,243
<i>Sam Merlotte, you are my offering!</i>

472
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:02,906
People, your work here is done.

473
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:04,375
<i>Go home.</i>

474
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,794
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

475
00:34:07,248 --> 00:34:09,582
He is the best offering ever.

476
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,299
<i>You will all have...</i>

477
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:14,301
<i>great weather and...</i>

478
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,220
<i>good crops.</i>

479
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:17,388
<i>Now leave.</i>

480
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,682
Bullshit. God has horns.

481
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:29,152
Is that really God?

482
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:31,860
Lord.

483
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:33,987
Lord.

484
00:34:37,488 --> 00:34:38,488
Smite me.

485
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:41,948
What's he saying?
I can't hear.

486
00:34:42,073 --> 00:34:44,331
- I don't know!
- Smite me,

487
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:46,369
Lord.

488
00:34:48,143 --> 00:34:51,078
I don't even know
what you saying, man.

489
00:34:52,238 --> 00:34:54,192
Smite me, motherfucker.

490
00:34:56,605 --> 00:35:00,055
I smite thee, Sam Merlotte!

491
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,440
<i>Die!</i>

492
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,747
What the fuck just happened?

493
00:35:14,872 --> 00:35:16,738
I got no fucking idea.

494
00:35:24,974 --> 00:35:26,850
There. Happy?

495
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:28,394
Well?

496
00:35:32,276 --> 00:35:33,576
Tell your leader

497
00:35:33,994 --> 00:35:36,341
I am very pleased with my offering.

498
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,926
Thank you, God.

499
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:39,798
You are welcome.

500
00:35:40,156 --> 00:35:41,616
You're all blessed.

501
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:45,406
Now go.

502
00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:50,522
Squad.
Report to Maryann for debriefing.

503
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:55,027
Anybody who wants to de-brief me
can do so right now.

504
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:11,348
What the hell happened to Sam?

505
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:13,448
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

506
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:19,468
I'll explain later.

507
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:24,906
Just help me put these fucking flares
out before they start a fire.

508
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:33,739
That's the last drink
I will ever take.

509
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,652
<i>Tara, let Sookie in.</i>

510
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,346
It's not working.

511
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:44,310
Tara, you are safe here.

512
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:47,412
You have to do exactly as I say.

513
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,164
I am not your fucking slave girl.

514
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,209
If ever there was a time to listen
to a white man, this would be it.

515
00:36:52,506 --> 00:36:54,586
Jesus, please, Jesus.

516
00:36:55,307 --> 00:36:56,883
Let Sookie in.

517
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:01,552
Now.

518
00:37:38,972 --> 00:37:40,146
Oh, my God.

519
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:44,743
I'm crazy.

520
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:47,580
I'm really crazy.

521
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:52,339
It wasn't you.

522
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:54,583
It's not you.

523
00:38:02,232 --> 00:38:03,106
Mama!

524
00:38:04,251 --> 00:38:05,301
I'm sorr...

525
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:08,285
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mama.

526
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:10,681
I knew it wasn't you, baby girl.

527
00:38:10,806 --> 00:38:12,356
I knew it wasn't you.

528
00:38:19,332 --> 00:38:20,213
Thank you.

529
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:24,937
I need some air.

530
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:47,699
I gotta go get Eggs.

531
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,918
I've known Tara my whole life,

532
00:38:57,525 --> 00:38:59,252
and every trace of her was gone.

533
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:01,131
Replaced.

534
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:05,300
 I thought vampires were the only ones
who could hypnotize people.

535
00:39:05,672 --> 00:39:07,001
No offense, Sookie,

536
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:09,148
but humans are shockingly
susceptible to about

537
00:39:09,273 --> 00:39:11,514
every form of thought manipulation.

538
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:13,752
It's all coming from Maryann.

539
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,268
All of it.

540
00:39:17,206 --> 00:39:18,897
They eat people's

541
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:19,897
hearts.

542
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,058
But she wants more.

543
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:25,627
She wants their souls.

544
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,532
- And that chant.
- Chant?

545
00:39:32,424 --> 00:39:33,424
Bacchus.

546
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:45,380
I've seen that look
on your face before

547
00:39:45,924 --> 00:39:47,341
and I don't like it.

548
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,306
I read about some ancient creatures
many years ago.

549
00:39:56,723 --> 00:39:59,106
But I always assumed
it was just a myth.

550
00:40:02,464 --> 00:40:04,764
But I believe Maryann might be one.

551
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:06,982
What is she,

552
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,222
and more importantly,

553
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:11,825
how do we kill her?

554
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:14,143
I do not know how to defeat her,

555
00:40:15,355 --> 00:40:17,505
but I know one vampire who might.

556
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:19,958
Might.

557
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:24,504
But if I'm gonna make it by daylight,
I must leave now.

558
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:26,311
Let's go.

559
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,540
I must do this alone.

560
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,720
But I'll be back by morning.

561
00:40:32,454 --> 00:40:33,854
And Jason and Sam,

562
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:35,805
Tara and Lafayette...

563
00:40:38,855 --> 00:40:40,437
you can do more good for them here.

564
00:40:41,418 --> 00:40:42,568
You're right.

565
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:45,533
I left everybody before
and look what happened.

566
00:40:47,294 --> 00:40:48,579
Can you do...

567
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:52,403
whatever it was
that you did to Maryann...?

568
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,117
You do it again?

569
00:40:55,582 --> 00:40:56,732
I don't know.

570
00:40:57,701 --> 00:41:00,064
I don't even know
what it was that I did.

571
00:41:00,766 --> 00:41:01,766
All right.

572
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:04,917
Keep your friends safe,

573
00:41:06,188 --> 00:41:08,507
and by all means,
you stay away from your home.

574
00:41:11,394 --> 00:41:12,385
Promise me.

575
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:14,542
Promise.

576
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:34,296
But I never get to go to the party!

577
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,914
You know how many invitations
I've passed up

578
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,981
to stay home with my crybaby son?

579
00:41:39,106 --> 00:41:41,381
You always go,
and you always drag me along with you.

580
00:41:41,506 --> 00:41:43,041
Oh, you selfish little shit.

581
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,460
You can spew as much venom
as you want.

582
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,754
- You won't go to the Merlotte's.
- You could come with me,

583
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:50,730
maybe meet a nice girl

584
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:52,717
instead of that devil slut.

585
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,344
I'm tired of this shit.

586
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:57,665
Treat Jess with respect, or I'm gonna
lock your ass up in that cubbyhole

587
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:01,470
- until Vampire Bill gets home.
- Oh, you're Dirty Harry now, huh?

588
00:42:01,771 --> 00:42:03,687
Because you're dipping
your penguin dick

589
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,708
in that vamper tramp?

590
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:06,815
You are cut

591
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,442
from the same cloth as your daddy.

592
00:42:09,806 --> 00:42:11,611
You are both half-men.

593
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,989
- Miss Fortenberry...
- Just calm down.

594
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,687
A half-man and a dead whore.

595
00:42:17,145 --> 00:42:19,079
Who else would have either of you?

596
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,203
Jess, don't.

597
00:42:20,328 --> 00:42:21,790
Look, lady. You have no idea

598
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,925
how little control
I have over my actions.

599
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,168
You also don't know
that I haven't eaten in days.

600
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:27,252
Seriously?

601
00:42:28,472 --> 00:42:29,337
Wait.

602
00:42:30,867 --> 00:42:34,081
You give me one good reason
why I shouldn't drain you dry.

603
00:42:34,206 --> 00:42:36,386
I don't gotta give you nothing.

604
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:38,016
Fuck, no!

605
00:42:40,447 --> 00:42:41,881
Welcome, Mr. Compton.

606
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:43,856
The queen is expecting you.

607
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,030
Your Majesty.
