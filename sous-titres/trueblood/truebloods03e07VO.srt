1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,173
No wonder Bill was drawn to you.

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,343
- You're delicious.
- Fuck you.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,553
I've never tasted anything like you.

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,263
What are you?

5
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,349
I'm the bitch that's gonna kill you.

6
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:22,021
Let me go.

7
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,573
Do it.

8
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,742
- But...
- Do it.

9
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:40,122
I love you.

10
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:44,948
You wouldn't know love
if it kicked you in the fangs.

11
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:10,820
Help!

12
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:53,881
Shut the door.

13
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,509
She had to have the key
to the manacles.

14
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:58,734
- Is he dead?
- No.

15
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,263
He's in real bad shape, but he's...

16
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,015
You sure?
Because he looks dead.

17
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:05,206
He isn't dead!

18
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:08,729
When vampires are dead,
this is what they look like.

19
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:10,815
Jesus Christ.

20
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:13,484
We've got to get out of here.
There's wolves all over.

21
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:14,581
I know.

22
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:16,695
It's only a matter of time
before they come.

23
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,145
I said, I know.

24
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,868
- Please, help me wrap him up.
- What?

25
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,203
We ain't got that...

26
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,920
I am not leaving here without him.

27
00:03:31,508 --> 00:03:33,435
Let's wrap him up in the tarp.

28
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:45,891
Shouldn't have.

29
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:49,217
Vampire burrito?

30
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:51,355
For me?

31
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,141
What can I do you for?

32
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,053
Here for the fights.

33
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:16,750
What fights?
There ain't no fights here.

34
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:21,508
I was told there was gonna be
some dogfighting here,

35
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,512
and I was hoping
to get in on the action.

36
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:25,817
You was told, huh?

37
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,100
By who?

38
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,103
Man didn't give me his name.

39
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:35,065
Told him I had money. He told me
where I could go to spend it.

40
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:39,862
Now, you don't strike me
as the dogfighting type.

41
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,704
Well, you got me all wrong,

42
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,161
because I love me
some high-stakes gambling,

43
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:49,830
and dogfighting's
the ultimate sport for me.

44
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:53,347
And once you done it, you
realize cards are for pussies.

45
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:56,862
Well, like I already told you,

46
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:58,380
ain't no fights here.

47
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,677
I got money to burn.

48
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,760
I'll give you some.

49
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,990
Don't you even think about it.

50
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,717
- You a cop?
- No, no, no. I swear.

51
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:18,091
Show me your gun.

52
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:28,661
If you are a cop, you sure as
shit ain't carrying a cop's gun.

53
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:31,914
- I told you, I ain't a cop.
- Turn your shit around and go.

54
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,572
Do it and I will let you live.

55
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:38,321
All right.

56
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,830
Easy.

57
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,591
Just let everybody else go,
take the vamp with them.

58
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:57,730
- You and me, we can talk.
- Fuck you.

59
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:00,776
I'm the one with the fucking gun.
Ain't no one going nowhere.

60
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,506
- Sweetheart...
- I ain't your sweetheart no more.

61
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:05,681
Now give me a minute to think.

62
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:08,569
<i>I didn't want to do this.
Calm down, Debbie. Pull it together.</i>

63
00:06:08,694 --> 00:06:10,426
<i>Fuck, I can't.
I need some more V.</i>

64
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:13,080
<i>Maybe this vamp still has
some blood left in him.</i>

65
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,745
Don't even think about it, bitch.

66
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,626
Oh, you sure picked a dumb-ass
time to call me bitch, bitch.

67
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,088
- Hey now, Sook. Don't do that.
- Sookie, I got this.

68
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,423
You ain't got shit.

69
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,889
This ain't you.
No way you're pulling that trigger.

70
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:26,785
<i>These people killed my packmates.</i>

71
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,345
It's that V.

72
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,245
- <i>An eye for an eye.</i>
- This isn't you.

73
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,224
<i>They can pay us back
only with their lives.</i>

74
00:06:32,911 --> 00:06:34,309
Alcide, I've been listening in

75
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:36,854
and she ain't exactly
misrepresenting herself.

76
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:38,378
Okay, freak.

77
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:42,068
Your mind-reading shit's
getting real fucking old.

78
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,229
Look at me.
Look at me.

79
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,156
You loved me.

80
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,408
I know it.

81
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:53,467
I'd have given up everything
for you,

82
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:56,623
but you wouldn't even
give me a baby.

83
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:00,389
- Sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry?

84
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,964
What happened to, "I won't bring
one of our kind in the world"?

85
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,133
It's too fucking late
for you to be sorry.

86
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,762
It's never too late.

87
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:09,428
You want to talk about it,

88
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,637
we can.

89
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,044
Back off.

90
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,223
<i>Listen to me, Sook.</i>

91
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,726
- <i>I take her out when she ain't looking.</i>
- Tara, don't.

92
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,519
There ain't no going back.

93
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:19,593
This is who I am now.

94
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,317
It's just a scar.
We all got scars.

95
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,320
<i>If she shoots him, we're next,
and I'm not gonna die here.</i>

96
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,446
Give me the gun.

97
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,648
That was your last step.

98
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,366
You ain't getting another.

99
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,582
<i>I don't care what you do, Sook.
Just distract her for me.</i>

100
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:42,669
Fuck you.
Bitch, I'll kill you.

101
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:44,421
Go ahead and try.

102
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,926
Get off of me.

103
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:48,133
What the hell is going on in here?

104
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,778
Oh, my fucking God!

105
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:13,922
Sorry, Debbie.

106
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,869
He didn't leave me any choice.

107
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:22,000
You had a choice.

108
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:27,047
And you picked the fucking fangbanger
over one of your own?

109
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:36,722
Go on. Get him in the van.

110
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:41,813
I'll be right out.

111
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,131
Tara, keep the ends
wrapped up tight.

112
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:48,360
What's it gonna be...

113
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,612
sweetheart?

114
00:08:51,755 --> 00:08:53,376
You gonna kill me too?

115
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:56,235
You fucking better,

116
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,010
because if you don't,

117
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,650
I'll sniff you out.

118
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,335
I will.

119
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:07,589
I will come after you,

120
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:08,839
and I

121
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:11,441
will hunt

122
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:13,918
you down.

123
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,275
I believe you.

124
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:30,485
- You got him?
- The V is making me strong.

125
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:33,071
Plus, the fucking fanger's
lost a lot of weight in blood...

126
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:37,034
Is the V making you insensitive
as well or is that just you?

127
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,327
He left me for dead.

128
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,120
Well, two wrongs don't make a right.

129
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,289
Come on.
Close the door. I'm riding in the back.

130
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:44,958
He ain't gonna make it.
Don't do this to yourself.

131
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,543
Close the door!

132
00:09:46,993 --> 00:09:48,921
- Let's go. We got company.
- Oh, shit.

133
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,998
You need a faster van.

134
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:04,937
- Did you just...
- Yeah.

135
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:10,557
Motherfucker!

136
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:23,830
You all right?

137
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:27,344
No, it's just funny.

138
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,848
Never really thought I was

139
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:31,961
smart enough to get depressed,

140
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,383
but here I am.

141
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:36,768
Is this still about Crystal?

142
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:40,178
Just got all these questions
spinning around in my head.

143
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:42,320
I don't know what to do with them.

144
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:43,267
Like?

145
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,435
Like...

146
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:49,481
why is it that I barely know her,
but I already love her?

147
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,986
And who the fuck is that dick
she's living with?

148
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,530
And why would someone like her
put up with that shit?

149
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:57,990
And also,

150
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:00,409
She's named after the Champagne?

151
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,550
Because I'm thinking she was.

152
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,573
- She's from Hotshot.
- Yeah.

153
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,043
She's probably named after that drug
that keeps the town afloat.

154
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:11,707
No way.

155
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:14,298
I'll bet you 100-to-1
her middle name's "Meth."

156
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,040
You're a Christian.

157
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,760
That ain't cool, to judge.

158
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:22,651
I know. I'm sorry.

159
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,516
I'm trying to snap you out of it.

160
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:25,795
That's all.

161
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:29,238
And I appreciate it,
but it ain't gonna work.

162
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,362
You remember that dealer
you took down last week at the bust?

163
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,961
I just told you,
it ain't gonna work.

164
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,577
Reminding me of last week's glory
ain't gonna change the fact

165
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,008
that this week
ain't done shit for me yet.

166
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:48,110
Well, you think they still
got him down at the jail?

167
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:49,612
I think so, yeah.

168
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,990
Why don't you go and talk to him?

169
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:54,923
He's the best shot you got
at getting answers about Crystal,

170
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,662
and he's just sitting down there
at the jail locked up waiting for you.

171
00:12:00,706 --> 00:12:02,304
That's genius is what that is.

172
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,890
Oh, bubba.

173
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:08,352
I knew you and me being roommates
wasn't gonna suck forever.

174
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:23,367
May I come in?

175
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:26,021
- Summer.
- I'm just kidding.

176
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,839
I'm not a vampire
like your last girlfriend.

177
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:31,536
Girlfriend?

178
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:56,691
I baked

179
00:12:57,831 --> 00:12:58,735
biscuits.

180
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,422
My great-gram's recipe,
still warm from the oven,

181
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:04,116
butter churned by hand,

182
00:13:04,814 --> 00:13:08,232
and homemade strawberry
preserves I picked myself

183
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:09,944
from the church-house garden.

184
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:14,501
This place could use
some sprucing up, huh?

185
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,422
- What?
- Nothing.

186
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,955
I just wasn't expecting you,
that's all.

187
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,635
I know, and maybe
I should have called first.

188
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,803
But...

189
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:30,851
I had the most amazing time
with you the other night,

190
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,019
and then yesterday,
I sat by the phone

191
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,856
waiting for you to call,
and you didn't.

192
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:38,234
Yeah. I got off of work late,
and I should have.

193
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,803
Because I woke up this morning,
it hit me.

194
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,453
"Summer," I said, "why play games?"

195
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:45,703
And then I decided

196
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:48,148
that I was gonna declare
my feelings for you,

197
00:13:48,273 --> 00:13:50,036
and let the chips fall
where they may.

198
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,140
And if you don't feel
the same way about me,

199
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,610
well, then that will be your loss.

200
00:13:54,955 --> 00:13:56,460
So here it goes.

201
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:01,050
I like you, Hoyt.

202
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,476
I wanna be your girlfriend,

203
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:06,086
and I really want you
to taste my biscuits.

204
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,765
Those biscuits?

205
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,103
Oh, mama.

206
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,581
Hey, are you Summer?

207
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,992
You told your roommate about me?

208
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,402
Summer, these are...

209
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,907
I'm telling you, this one here,

210
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,117
she's gonna make a great
grandmama one day.

211
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:30,851
She's a keeper.

212
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:36,821
- Thanks for your vote.
- Oh, you earned it.

213
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,545
You eat, I'll spruce.

214
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:51,274
Hadley.

215
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,566
Your Majesty.

216
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,771
I wish you didn't have
to see me like this.

217
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:02,442
The reason your human is trembling,
is because I've let her in on my plan.

218
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,485
Which is?

219
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,779
Which is to sink my fangs
into her and drink

220
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:08,734
until you tell me what it is
about Sookie Stackhouse

221
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:10,793
that has so obviously piqued
your interest.

222
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:13,721
Sookie Stackhouse?
I have no interest in her.

223
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,905
And if I drink too much,

224
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:18,917
well, so be it.

225
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:20,664
Fine.

226
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:22,295
So be it.

227
00:15:23,026 --> 00:15:24,026
Really?

228
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,301
You've kept this one around
a long time.

229
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:32,148
Must be some reason for that.

230
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:35,244
Why do you care about Sookie?

231
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,935
Because you do.

232
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:39,396
And because my king does.

233
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:41,055
Your king?

234
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,427
Russell Edgington
is the most duplicitous vampire

235
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:47,529
in the Americas, maybe the world.

236
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,117
- You honestly think you can trust him?
- Like I can trust you?

237
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,922
The only vampire a vampire can trust

238
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,290
is the vampire he made.

239
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:05,922
I give her three stars.

240
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:14,097
- What do you know about Sookie?
- Nothing.

241
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:24,687
Stop.

242
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:27,819
I'll tell you.

243
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,946
Hadley, don't.

244
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:34,978
The queen's confided in you?

245
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:36,953
Some.

246
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:38,830
But also...

247
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,339
Sookie's my...

248
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:44,316
My cous... Cousin.

249
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Tell me.

250
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:53,608
Tell me, tell me.

251
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,523
I certainly wasn't expecting that.

252
00:17:23,696 --> 00:17:25,546
Looks like we got a runner.

253
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,214
- He belong to any of y'all?
- Ain't mine.

254
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,041
Look at the size of the balls
on that son of a bitch.

255
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,834
We can't have dogs running
around on the loose.

256
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:37,142
Hey, you.

257
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:40,809
That's right, you little fucker.

258
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,936
Who the hell let you out?

259
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,090
Go get him, Bobby.

260
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:48,784
Look at you,

261
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:51,778
sitting all nice and pretty for me.

262
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,158
Tell you what.

263
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:57,280
You ain't gonna stand a chance
in that ring.

264
00:17:57,897 --> 00:17:59,147
No, you're not.

265
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:12,449
Give me some kind of sign
if you're still with me.

266
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,113
If you make it through this,

267
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:28,356
you owe me.

268
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,073
Come on, baby.

269
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:38,298
Drink.

270
00:18:39,255 --> 00:18:40,255
Please.

271
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:52,189
Thank you so much.

272
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:05,685
Easy. Come on.

273
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:15,586
You need to try and relax.

274
00:19:15,711 --> 00:19:16,711
Relax?

275
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:19,144
I ain't even breathed for a week.

276
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:20,369
Then try to.

277
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:22,855
Take a breath.

278
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:25,673
You need it.

279
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,189
Greetings, T-Dub.

280
00:19:57,611 --> 00:19:59,800
- Remember me?
- Of course I do.

281
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:02,556
- You put me in here.
- I'm a cop.

282
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,452
That's not what I hear.

283
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,198
I'm almost a cop.

284
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,090
And I'm here to interrogate you.

285
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:16,214
- Do I look like a rat to you?
- Ain't nobody asking nobody

286
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:17,933
to rat nobody out.

287
00:20:24,554 --> 00:20:26,596
Could you stop pacing like that?

288
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:30,645
Look, man, all I wanna know about
is Crystal.

289
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,190
My cousin?

290
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,770
She's your cousin?

291
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:40,113
Then you must know
who that asshole she's living with is.

292
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,823
That asshole is my...

293
00:20:44,505 --> 00:20:45,785
You're smart.

294
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:48,204
I ain't saying another word.

295
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:52,264
Listen, T-Dub.

296
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,625
I don't know Crystal very well,
but the little bit I do know her

297
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,881
tells me she is a good person
in a bad situation.

298
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:02,802
And I think she deserves better,

299
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:04,087
don't you?

300
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
I mean,

301
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,182
you're family.

302
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:14,703
I'm gonna tell you
what you wanna know.

303
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,152
But you have got to bring me
some meth.

304
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:21,111
What the fuck?
I can't do that, man.

305
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,319
I've been in here without it
for almost a week

306
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:25,241
and I cannot
fucking take it no more.

307
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:29,162
What the hell, Stackhouse?
You ain't supposed to be back here.

308
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:31,352
I'm just sweeping, you know?

309
00:21:32,217 --> 00:21:33,667
Where's your broom?

310
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:35,762
That's a good point.

311
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:38,187
Those squad cars need washing again.

312
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:39,872
I'm on it, boss.

313
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:47,159
Shit. Jason fucking Stackhouse.
What the fuck am I gonna do?

314
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:49,432
My heart bleeds for you.

315
00:21:50,137 --> 00:21:52,477
Why don't you what you do best
and shut up.

316
00:22:09,518 --> 00:22:10,663
I'll be quick.

317
00:22:11,332 --> 00:22:13,425
Cool.
I'm just gonna check on Sook.

318
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,260
Sook, you all right back there?

319
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:31,391
Shit.

320
00:22:31,848 --> 00:22:33,129
She ain't answering?

321
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:39,482
- It's still light out. You open that...
- You think I give a fuck?

322
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,702
- What happened?
- You're fucking asking me?

323
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,328
We have to get her to a hospital.

324
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,590
- Get out.
- But I can help.

325
00:22:54,715 --> 00:22:55,665
Get out!

326
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,754
Don't you fucking die on me, Sookie.

327
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,549
Do not fucking die.

328
00:23:19,788 --> 00:23:20,788
Damn.

329
00:23:24,312 --> 00:23:25,762
Boy, you look mean.

330
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:28,262
You sure do mind good.

331
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,857
You're gonna roll
right onto your back

332
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:33,511
and take it like a little girl
later on, ain't you?

333
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,283
I'm betting against you.

334
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:42,652
All right, then.

335
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:44,629
Slide on in here, teddy bear.

336
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,998
What the hell?

337
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,851
<i>Doctor Sekuler to the ER.</i>

338
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,045
Let's go.

339
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,936
All right, BP's dropping.
She's gonna palp, let's go.

340
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:04,983
I'm sorry.

341
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:09,201
Get ready to transfuse.

342
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,353
Pressure's steady.

343
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,792
Two more in.

344
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:23,210
Line is in.

345
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,329
Here we go.

346
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:28,466
Piggy-back it.

347
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,176
Pressure's good.
All right, I'll call the blood bank.

348
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,766
Another four units on standby,
just in case we need it.

349
00:24:37,152 --> 00:24:39,502
- She's starting to seize.
- Got it.

350
00:24:40,928 --> 00:24:43,380
- Pressure's accelerating.
- Let's get the cart in here.

351
00:24:43,505 --> 00:24:44,805
Watch that line.

352
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,890
Miss Thornton?

353
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,670
How is she?

354
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:59,163
- She's lost a lot of blood.
- How much blood?

355
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:00,163
A lot.

356
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,170
- What about a transfusion? Can't...
- We tried. Her body rejected it.

357
00:25:06,448 --> 00:25:08,131
Maybe you gave
the wrong kind of blood?

358
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:11,300
You checked her first, right?
You better not have taken a guess.

359
00:25:11,748 --> 00:25:13,636
Your friend
doesn't have a blood type.

360
00:25:14,702 --> 00:25:17,516
- Everybody has a blood type.
- Exactly.

361
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,561
But for whatever reason,
we couldn't establish hers

362
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,102
and we are running out of time.

363
00:25:22,506 --> 00:25:24,851
So I put in an order for O-negative.

364
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:27,067
O-neg is universal donor.

365
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,526
But your friend...

366
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:33,363
I have never seen a reaction
like that before.

367
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,452
I'm sorry.

368
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,844
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to notify the family.

369
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,591
Piece of shit.
Don't even die good.

370
00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:48,673
Bring in the next one.

371
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:54,886
Mama loves you.

372
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,309
Get up, boy.

373
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:30,922
- Go, Tommy.
- Take it to him, Tommy.

374
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:32,340
Oh, boy.

375
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,344
Motherfucker!

376
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:40,223
Go. Git.

377
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,141
Come on, Tommy. Let's go.

378
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,362
- You owe me 500 buck.
- I don't owe you shit.

379
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:57,821
Hey, son.

380
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,864
Don't you snarl at me.

381
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:07,375
Good dog.

382
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:10,461
Good, good.
Now get the fuck out of here.

383
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,513
- Your clothes.
- Don't you tell...

384
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:21,597
Your clothes!

385
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,314
Sorry.

386
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:33,426
You got a minute?

387
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:38,864
Last time you came to me all shaky
like this, you wanted to buy some V.

388
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:42,159
I told you, that shit's behind me.
I just need some meth.

389
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:43,661
What?

390
00:27:43,844 --> 00:27:45,594
It ain't for me, I swear.

391
00:27:45,908 --> 00:27:48,248
It's for this dude
who we got in lockup.

392
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:50,435
He's got this information I need,

393
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,472
but he'll only give it to me
if I get him some meth.

394
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:56,879
I don't deal no fucking meth.

395
00:27:57,974 --> 00:28:00,223
And even if I did,
I wouldn't sell the shit to you.

396
00:28:00,348 --> 00:28:02,053
And you ought to thank me for it.

397
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:04,974
Goddamn it, Lafayette, I'm in love.

398
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,601
With the dude in jail?

399
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,650
With his cousin.

400
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,068
<i>It's me.</i>

401
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:17,902
Where's she at?

402
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,221
- It's Sookie.
- <i>What about her?</i>

403
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:27,288
Say something.
You're starting to freak me out.

404
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,217
We're at the hospital

405
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:30,583
in Ruston.

406
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:33,871
<i>Sook's in a coma, Jason.</i>

407
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:35,934
<i>You need to get here.</i>

408
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,923
You need to get here now.

409
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,480
Sook's in the hospital.
Sook's in the fucking hospital.

410
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,922
- You warm now, son?
- Little better, yeah.

411
00:28:46,047 --> 00:28:47,547
Now you give a shit.

412
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,019
I thought Tara had a shitty mother,
you take the cake.

413
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:53,022
- Don't talk to your mother that way.
- Don't talk to me that way

414
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,567
Like making people scared?
Think you're good at it?

415
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,898
I can't understand the power
you got over this people,

416
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:01,533
because I see you for what you are.

417
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:04,115
You're just a scared man
in saggy underpants

418
00:29:04,446 --> 00:29:06,902
with no discernable
life skills whatsoever.

419
00:29:08,883 --> 00:29:10,790
- Come on, Tommy.
- Where are you going?

420
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,366
Taking him with me.

421
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:15,169
- I can't.
- You can. You can be free of them.

422
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,671
He's my son.
You can't do this to me.

423
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,005
I can, and so can he.

424
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,219
I thought the Merlottes
were the worst people I'd ever met.

425
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:26,055
The two of you Mickens
make them look like a coup Dalai Lamas.

426
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,780
You really fucking do.

427
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:29,974
I'm sorry, Sam.
I know we let you down...

428
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,644
You're sorry. Great.

429
00:29:32,274 --> 00:29:34,104
Duly noted. Come on, Tommy.

430
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:35,689
You coming with me?

431
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:42,936
I can't promise you a perfect life,

432
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,616
but I can promise you
it'll be better than now.

433
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,998
- I'm coming.
- All right.

434
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,127
Come on, let's do this.

435
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,040
Don't you worry, Lindy.

436
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:01,923
- We'll get him back.
- I hate you!

437
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,217
I hate your fucking guts.

438
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,345
I understand that this is hard,
but as the responsible party here,

439
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,863
there's certain decisions
that you might have to make.

440
00:30:13,988 --> 00:30:15,488
I ain't responsible.

441
00:30:16,142 --> 00:30:17,690
But you are the next of kin.

442
00:30:20,764 --> 00:30:23,408
Maybe, but I ain't responsible.

443
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:25,143
I mean, I can't be.

444
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:28,245
I understand your position,
but in the event your sister...

445
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,713
Leave him alone, please.

446
00:30:29,838 --> 00:30:32,079
- But I...
- I said, leave him alone.

447
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,916
Go find somebody else's organs
to harvest or some shit.

448
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,084
I'm sorry.

449
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,504
I'll smooth it over.

450
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:44,981
Listen to me. Fuck her.
This shit ain't over.

451
00:30:45,422 --> 00:30:47,178
Just don't make no sense.

452
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:50,387
How can Sookie not have
a blood type?

453
00:30:51,689 --> 00:30:52,789
You got one?

454
00:30:54,001 --> 00:30:55,101
AB-negative.

455
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:58,536
I only know it because
I'm always cutting myself

456
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:00,611
with power tools and whatnot.

457
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:04,307
But Sook, she ain't never
really been sick before.

458
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:06,363
Definitely never
stayed in a hospital.

459
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
Wasn't even born in one.

460
00:31:09,603 --> 00:31:10,743
I didn't know that.

461
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,621
Our mama was always waiting
till the last minute

462
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,139
to do everything.

463
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:18,408
And Sook,
she was coming out real fast,

464
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,754
so there wasn't any time.

465
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,672
Our daddy had to deliver her
on the dining-room table.

466
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,809
Saw more of it than I cared to.

467
00:31:34,123 --> 00:31:37,478
You think it's all this vampire blood
she's had that did this to her?

468
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:39,994
It ain't the blood she drank
that did this.

469
00:31:40,495 --> 00:31:42,650
It's the piece of shit vampire
she drank it from.

470
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,600
You really kicked him
out in the sun?

471
00:31:49,503 --> 00:31:51,903
And he's nothing
but fucking ash now,

472
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:53,486
and good riddance.

473
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:02,615
Don't you do this to me.

474
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:11,019
I wasn't playing before
when I said you're all I got.

475
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:13,847
I fucking need you.

476
00:32:14,436 --> 00:32:15,736
So come on back.

477
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,229
And I fucking need you too.

478
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,147
Come on, y'all.
Stop cussing at her.

479
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:25,641
We're gonna figure this thing out.

480
00:33:22,592 --> 00:33:23,642
Where am I?

481
00:33:28,094 --> 00:33:29,548
You're in the hospital.

482
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,897
You can't seem to stay
out of trouble, can you?

483
00:33:32,022 --> 00:33:33,872
I don't...
Do you know me?

484
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:35,599
Come.

485
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:36,805
Who are you?

486
00:33:36,992 --> 00:33:38,142
I'm Claudine.

487
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,644
Oh, dear.
Your cup is empty.

488
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:44,699
We can't have that, can we?

489
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,559
Oh, Claudine.

490
00:34:11,595 --> 00:34:12,591
It's beautiful.

491
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:14,802
Drink.

492
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,604
It's the most amazing thing
I've ever tasted.

493
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,106
You've had it before.

494
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:42,887
Okay, but where did she come from?

495
00:34:43,012 --> 00:34:44,321
Oh, don't be fooled.

496
00:34:44,446 --> 00:34:47,296
That pond is bigger and deeper
than you think.

497
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:51,672
Can we dance?

498
00:34:52,118 --> 00:34:53,728
We can always dance.

499
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,968
I knew you were gonna say that.

500
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,333
And I knew you were going
to say that.

501
00:34:58,503 --> 00:34:59,304
Come.

502
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,191
I think over again
my small adventures,

503
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,437
my fears,

504
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,455
those small ones that seemed so big.

505
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:13,312
For all the vital things
I had to get and reach,

506
00:35:13,437 --> 00:35:15,362
and yet there is only
one great thing,

507
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,831
the only thing,

508
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,660
to live to see the great day
that dawns

509
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,121
and the light that fills the world.

510
00:35:25,347 --> 00:35:26,623
That's beautiful.

511
00:35:26,748 --> 00:35:28,928
That's because that shit is Inuit.

512
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:33,135
And we all is used
to lesser religions.

513
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:45,739
I'm gonna have to sit this one out.

514
00:35:45,864 --> 00:35:48,696
I guess I don't have
the endurance that you all have.

515
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:50,939
Oh, not to worry.
You will one day.

516
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,760
- You promise?
- I do.

517
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,140
Don't go back.

518
00:35:58,405 --> 00:36:00,032
- Come with us.
- Where?

519
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:01,209
Our home.

520
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:03,660
It's more beautiful
than anything you can imagine.

521
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,521
- How do you get there?
- Swim.

522
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,156
- Come.
- <i>Hate deep water.</i>

523
00:36:07,281 --> 00:36:09,958
<i>Mama and Daddy were killed by water.
Don't. Can't swim.</i>

524
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,227
I can't.
See, I never learned to swim.

525
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,661
<i>Do not fear the water.</i>

526
00:36:13,786 --> 00:36:16,030
<i>It wasn't the water
that killed them.</i>

527
00:36:16,155 --> 00:36:17,155
What?

528
00:36:18,257 --> 00:36:21,261
If it wasn't the water
that killed them, then what did?

529
00:36:23,962 --> 00:36:25,462
The dark approaches.

530
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,601
The dark approaches.

531
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:30,229
How is she?

532
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,550
Motherfucker.

533
00:36:32,476 --> 00:36:34,066
- She's dying.
- Thanks to you.

534
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,109
- I can help.
- The fuck you can.

535
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,827
Oh, hell, no.
He's the one who did this.

536
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:41,448
- Shit.
- Jason, there is no time.

537
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,053
My blood can save her.

538
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:45,077
Hurry.
See you all at home.

539
00:36:45,446 --> 00:36:48,857
- I've never seen a vampire before.
- I promise. You don't want to.

540
00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:50,273
Bill's not like that.

541
00:36:50,398 --> 00:36:52,594
I don't have time to explain
why you're wrong.

542
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,062
You have to come with us.

543
00:36:54,187 --> 00:36:56,129
- It's not safe for you anymore.
- Why?

544
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,549
- He will steal your light.
- What light?

545
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:04,930
I'm not going with you.
I don't know you.

546
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:07,224
Do not let him take it from you.

547
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,568
Promise me.

548
00:37:12,603 --> 00:37:14,503
How do I get back from here?

549
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,003
Do it.

550
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,654
It's my call.

551
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:42,134
Do it.

552
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:07,351
Come on, Sookie.

553
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:28,343
I come bearing gifts

554
00:38:29,492 --> 00:38:32,882
because I want you to know
how rotten I feel

555
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:35,407
about the way
I've been treating you.

556
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:38,823
I sent one of my minions
to Tiffany's

557
00:38:40,281 --> 00:38:43,170
to pick up
a little something for you.

558
00:38:45,552 --> 00:38:48,294
How'd you know
I was a Tiffany's girl?

559
00:38:50,548 --> 00:38:52,041
Most women are.

560
00:38:52,459 --> 00:38:53,959
And those who aren't

561
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:56,944
just think they're not.

562
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,368
They're beautiful.

563
00:39:00,143 --> 00:39:01,797
They're sterling silver.

564
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Excellent.

565
00:39:05,414 --> 00:39:07,803
They'll match my chains.

566
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:14,915
Unfortunately,
seeing you now I realize

567
00:39:16,384 --> 00:39:18,384
your ears are already pierced.

568
00:39:21,746 --> 00:39:24,298
Would you object
to my piercing your eyelids?

569
00:39:28,174 --> 00:39:29,432
Not at all.

570
00:39:30,012 --> 00:39:31,012
Very well.

571
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,549
Enough.

572
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:50,988
Mr. Northman.

573
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,120
It's only enough
if Bill Compton is with you.

574
00:39:55,245 --> 00:39:56,601
- Is he?
- No, Magister.

575
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,409
But the queen of Louisiana is.

576
00:40:02,343 --> 00:40:04,366
- Our deal...
- You were correct before

577
00:40:04,491 --> 00:40:06,073
in suspecting me,

578
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:09,491
but everything I did
was at her behest.

579
00:40:13,023 --> 00:40:15,433
You realize, of course,
you're committing treason,

580
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:19,318
throwing your queen
under the bus as you are.

581
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,899
But she's no longer my queen.

582
00:40:22,703 --> 00:40:24,903
My loyalty is to Mississippi now.

583
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:30,761
And Mississippi's proud to claim
Mr. Northman as one of her own.

584
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:33,984
Love the place.
Love your vibe.

585
00:40:34,109 --> 00:40:36,159
We must talk franchising later.

586
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,520
Russell Edgington.

587
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,238
You may call me King.

588
00:40:44,754 --> 00:40:46,860
Is it true what Northman says?

589
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:50,223
Yes, Magister.

590
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,033
Then I'm afraid
I'm going to have to arrest you.

591
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,083
By the powers vested in me
by the authority...

592
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:59,258
- The authority?
- I hereby...

593
00:41:01,246 --> 00:41:02,546
Are you serious?

594
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:05,539
Who are the authority?

595
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,214
What gave them the authority?

596
00:41:10,749 --> 00:41:12,469
Nothing. No one.

597
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,849
You okay?

598
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,200
They took it,
as I am taking it today.

599
00:41:16,325 --> 00:41:19,768
I no longer recognize the authority.

600
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,397
You are aware...
She stays on the table!

601
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:28,304
You are aware

602
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,280
that just saying that
is a cardinal sin.

603
00:41:32,938 --> 00:41:35,838
I am aware of just what a tough
little boat I'm putting you in.

604
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:38,044
Honestly, it is kind of fun.

605
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:44,177
You know I'm beholden by duty
to convey your blasphemy to the...

606
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,727
To the authority?

607
00:41:46,345 --> 00:41:48,013
Well, that won't be happening.

608
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,688
But enough about you.

609
00:41:50,673 --> 00:41:53,951
In exchange for the money
she owes the IRS,

610
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:55,719
Queen Sophie Anne,

611
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,181
has kindly accepted
my marriage proposal.

612
00:42:01,744 --> 00:42:03,044
I had no choice.

613
00:42:06,053 --> 00:42:07,096
Your Majesty...

614
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,875
Yes, my loyal subject?

615
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,869
Oh, we would be delighted

616
00:42:12,994 --> 00:42:15,337
if you would officiate
the wedding for us.

617
00:42:15,853 --> 00:42:18,374
I am forbidden to conduct

618
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:20,576
any rights of alignment

619
00:42:20,701 --> 00:42:22,178
unless specifically authori...

620
00:42:22,303 --> 00:42:26,082
Unless specifically authorized
to do so by the authority.

621
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:29,296
Yes, well, perhaps you have not
quite grasped

622
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,821
the subtext of our earlier exchange,

623
00:42:31,946 --> 00:42:34,050
but there's a new fucking authority

624
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,177
in town.

625
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:39,526
I swear fealty now and always

626
00:42:40,051 --> 00:42:42,017
to the one true vampire authority

627
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,352
in whose wisdom and justice I...

628
00:42:51,498 --> 00:42:54,385
You pathetic fool.

629
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,122
Blindly doing the bidding of others,

630
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,126
just like humans.

631
00:43:00,157 --> 00:43:01,581
It's vampires like you

632
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:04,206
who've been holding
the rest of us back for centuries.

633
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:44,386
You can dish it out, but you sure
can't take it, can you, Magister?

634
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,761
Let's see how this plays out, Pam.

635
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:48,500
You can always taunt later.

636
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,051
Can we hurry this along?

637
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:53,953
I'm getting cold feet.

638
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:56,301
Of course, my little pudding.

639
00:43:58,446 --> 00:44:00,231
This could be so much less painful

640
00:44:00,356 --> 00:44:02,656
if you just said the fucking words!

641
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,943
I am bound by duty

642
00:44:07,888 --> 00:44:09,854
to uphold the sacred laws of...

643
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,660
Your call.

644
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:24,995
I hereby pronounce you...

645
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:28,747
husband and wife.

646
00:44:31,176 --> 00:44:32,176
Thank you.

647
00:44:32,593 --> 00:44:33,693
Yes, thanks.

648
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,714
So happy I could bleed.

649
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,176
- Congratulations, Your Majesties.
- Yes, congrats.

650
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:42,554
You realize,

651
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,989
the authority
will never recognize...

652
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,266
Its own irrelevancy?

653
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,934
That's where you and I differ.

654
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,270
I truly believe they will,
and soon.

655
00:44:54,953 --> 00:44:55,953
Andalusia,

656
00:44:57,163 --> 00:44:58,695
the Iberian Peninsula.

657
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:02,271
Later 9th century, no?

658
00:45:05,992 --> 00:45:07,242
Well, whatever.

659
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:10,509
It's a long enough time
for you to have outgrown

660
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,112
your blind allegiance
to the authority

661
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:15,004
and their rule of law.

662
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:17,033
There is only one law:

663
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:18,840
The law of nature,

664
00:45:19,286 --> 00:45:21,040
the survival of the fittest.

665
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:23,281
We need to take this world
back from the humans,

666
00:45:23,406 --> 00:45:26,289
not placate them with billboards
and PR campaigns

667
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:27,932
while they destroy it.

668
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:31,992
That is not authority.
That is abdicating authority.

669
00:45:32,117 --> 00:45:33,267
Your Majesty.

670
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:35,881
Shall we?

671
00:45:39,557 --> 00:45:40,487
We shall.

672
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:44,616
Actually, no.

673
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,120
Say hello

674
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,950
to the true death.
