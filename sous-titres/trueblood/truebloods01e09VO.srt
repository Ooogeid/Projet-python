00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:57,970
- Ginger, enough.
- Thank you.

2
00:02:28,723 --> 00:02:29,746
Humans.

3
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,073
Honestly, Bill, I don't know
what you see in them.

6
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,753
How did I end up with you people?

7
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:31,277
Jesus.

8
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,164
Mother Mary in heaven.

9
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:39,726
I'm so sorry, Mama.
I'm so sorry.

10
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:42,502
When Ginger is finished,
glamour her for me.

11
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:45,552
Are you sure? She's been glamoured one
too many times already.

12
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:47,411
Who knows how much of her is left.

13
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:49,583
It's either that or turn her.

14
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:51,813
You want her?

15
00:04:52,646 --> 00:04:54,962
Please, I'm not that desperate.

16
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,042
- Glamour it is.
- Excellent.

17
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,950
Come.
I'll buy you a Blood.

18
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:17,402
- Thank you.
- How do you stomach that stuff?

19
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:19,196
Don't you find it metallic and vile?

20
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:21,616
I don't think about it.
It's sustenance, that's all.

21
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:26,226
What?

22
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:27,807
If you're their poster boy,

23
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,714
the mainstreaming movement
is in very deep trouble.

24
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:33,900
Tru Blood.
It keeps you alive,

25
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,036
but it will bore you to death.

26
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:39,842
- Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
- You killed a vampire, Bill.

27
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:41,241
For a human.

28
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,479
- What are we gonna do about this?
- What do you have in mind?

29
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:47,850
- I'll take the girl.
- No.

30
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:55,273
You can have anyone you want.
Why do you want her?

31
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:56,962
Why do you want her?

32
00:05:58,497 --> 00:06:00,345
You're not in love
with her, are you?

33
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:03,864
- Sookie must be protected.
- Now, that sounds like an edict.

34
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:06,603
But it couldn't be,
because I would know about that.

35
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:09,120
Admit it.

36
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,619
You love her.

37
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,849
If I hadn't done what I did,

38
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:18,464
would you have let
his disloyalty stand?

39
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,982
Whatever I did to Longshadow, I wouldn't
have done in front of witnesses.

40
00:06:22,102 --> 00:06:24,553
Especially not vampire witnesses.

41
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:27,840
Not smart, Bill.

42
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,342
Not smart at all.

43
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:43,170
All I'm saying is, Lafayette
didn't have to kidnap him.

44
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,073
And I'm pretty sure
he left with some V.

45
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:47,374
Hey. If you wanna make
the same arrangement

46
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,409
with Eddie Lafayette's got,
then have at it.

47
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:53,099
This is the only thing I could think of
to get you out of blowing a vampire.

48
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:58,352
You done this before, haven't you?

49
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:00,046
- Done what?
- This.

50
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,230
Kidnapping vampires.

51
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:07,115
Jesus. I should have known
something wasn't right

52
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:10,664
the second you walked into my life
carrying that big bag of crazy.

53
00:07:10,784 --> 00:07:13,615
'Cause any woman with a purse that big
is bound to have something in it

54
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:15,703
- I don't wanna know about.
- Jason.

55
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:20,845
Baby, you're sweet,
but you've gotta mellow out.

56
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:31,685
What the fuck is this hippie music?

57
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:46,789
Put these on.

58
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:52,099
Thank you, but I'm fine, really.

59
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:55,342
I'm just gonna dry out
my hair and be on my way.

60
00:07:55,672 --> 00:07:57,878
You're not going anywhere.
Eric and your boyfriend

61
00:07:57,998 --> 00:08:00,065
aren't nearly done talking just yet.

62
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,052
Is

63
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:05,519
- Bill in some kind of trouble?
- That's for the boys to figure out.

64
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,741
Right now, what you need to do
is change out of your clothes.

65
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:13,787
There's vampire in your cleavage.

66
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:18,792
Allow me.

67
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,384
Thank you.

68
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:30,970
I'm beginning to understand
the fuss everyone's making over you.

69
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:36,536
Hey there, Pam.

70
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:38,811
Who's your new friend?

71
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:42,482
Nice to meet you, Sookie.

72
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:45,525
Right. Nice to meet you too.

73
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,273
You don't have to be so scared.

74
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:50,241
They're really very nice here.

75
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:55,392
AMY: Here.

76
00:08:57,095 --> 00:08:58,972
- You got him?
- Yeah.

77
00:08:59,092 --> 00:09:01,694
Tape the windows shut. Here.

78
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:08,109
Clear this out. We gotta clear
all this shit out.

79
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,269
- Lift his legs.
- I got it.

80
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:17,357
- Ready?
- How's this one go?

81
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:19,102
Tie his arm there.

82
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:26,924
What?

83
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:31,364
I guess I got a little
paranoid after 9/11.

84
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:34,695
No, 'cause after New York and D.C.,

85
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,953
terrorists were gonna
come straight to Bon Temps.

86
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:39,572
- And I said I was paranoid.
- Get his feet.

87
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:42,349
What are you gonna do to me?

88
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:45,337
I was kind of wondering that myself.

89
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:48,388
We're gonna drink from him.

90
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:49,841
And then what?

91
00:09:50,427 --> 00:09:52,885
Dude, I got this.
What's the plan?

92
00:09:53,046 --> 00:09:56,098
Jason, can you please
try to live in the now with me.

93
00:09:57,318 --> 00:09:59,021
I do live in the now.

94
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:02,938
In fact, I've gone entire months
without thinking about shit.

95
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:06,224
But the truth is, right now,
the now kind of sucks.

96
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:09,236
And if we both can't admit that,
then we are 100 percent fucked.

97
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,453
- Who wants the first taste?
- Well, I ain't doing it. Not like this.

98
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:21,456
- Thank you.
- I said, stop talking to me.

99
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:23,323
Come with me, baby.

100
00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:27,071
- Don't let your fear get in your way.
- Look, it ain't fear, all right?

101
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:29,515
It's just...

102
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:35,470
He's looking me right in the eye.

103
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,640
It ain't right.

104
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:41,685
Look at him.

105
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:45,412
- Fine. I'll see you when I get back.
- Wait, wait, wait.

106
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,414
Ain't you supposed to
cut it with aspirin?

107
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:49,902
No, there's no risk of clotting
when the V's this fresh.

108
00:11:05,302 --> 00:11:06,395
My God.

109
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:12,734
You look...

110
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:15,972
really happy.

111
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:28,922
Come on, baby.

112
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,817
Come with me.

113
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:36,082
Don't. Don't do it.

114
00:11:38,518 --> 00:11:39,743
I said, don't talk to me.

115
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,972
What exactly did you do to my mama?

116
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:03,056
You were here.
You saw it.

117
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:05,892
Yeah, but I wanna know exactly
how and why it worked.

118
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,362
'Cause I'm already taking
a monster leap of faith

119
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:10,130
even considering this demon crap.

120
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,347
Fine, then.

121
00:12:12,017 --> 00:12:13,485
It's like this.

122
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:15,567
Your mind, your...

123
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:19,182
Your body, it's just a physical
manifestation of your soul.

124
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,451
And your soul is sick.

125
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:24,793
My soul don't wanna get ripped off.

126
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:30,777
- How's your mama doing?
- She's doing great.

127
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:32,921
But she believes in
shit like this. I don't.

128
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,873
If you don't believe

129
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:39,086
then why'd you come
all the way out here tonight?

130
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:45,308
How much it'll cost me?

131
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,137
- 799,95.
- What?

132
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:52,105
799,95.

133
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:54,191
Cup of rum's on the house.

134
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:56,114
My mama paid less than half that.

135
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,904
What I do takes varying
amounts of energy,

136
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,982
and involves varying
amounts of risk.

137
00:13:02,102 --> 00:13:03,984
Now, what you got inside you

138
00:13:04,104 --> 00:13:06,787
is much more powerful
than what your mama had.

139
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:08,457
Much more dangerous too.

140
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:10,569
I'm worse than her?

141
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:14,494
I once found that woman on
the ground, eating her own vomit

142
00:13:14,614 --> 00:13:17,466
'cause she didn't wanna waste
the alcohol she lost bringing it all up.

143
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,077
Think about it.

144
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:27,259
But not for too long.

145
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,105
You can't afford
to keep pushing people away.

146
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:37,660
Your loneliness is spreading
to your eyes.

147
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,140
It's becoming a part of who you are.

148
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:46,207
You're one hell
of a saleswoman, aren't you?

149
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:49,792
Next time you're alone

150
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,876
stand in the mirror
and count backwards from 10.

151
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:56,189
If you can get all
the way down to zero,

152
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:58,632
then I'm wrong.

153
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:03,058
But if you can't stand your own
company for 10 seconds,

154
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:07,366
how you gonna expect to do it
for the rest of your life?

155
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:16,923
So you're not in any trouble?

156
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:18,959
A simple slap on the wrist,
that's all.

157
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,050
You swear? Because Pam
made it sound like...

158
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,163
Pam was turned almost 100 years ago,

159
00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:26,848
and yet somehow still behaves
as though every day were Halloween.

160
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:29,903
She's all drama and theatrics.

161
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:31,323
I assure you,

162
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:33,926
everything's gonna be fine.

163
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,632
I'm gonna take a shower. I still feel
like there's blood all over me.

164
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:47,406
Don't look up.

165
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:01,183
Wait, wait, wait.

166
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:03,570
First

167
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,881
we have to thank the vampire

168
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,174
for the gifts
that he's bestowed upon us.

169
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:15,374
- We are grateful...
- Fuck you.

170
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:16,918
... for your gift to us.

171
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:19,287
Ignore him.

172
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:43,090
<i>Can you see it?</i>

173
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:45,773
<i>Where are we?</i>

174
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:47,894
<i>Nowhere.</i>

175
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:50,591
<i>Everywhere.</i>

176
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:53,183
<i>Together.</i>

177
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,815
Aren't you tired?

178
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:33,333
Every time I close my eyes,
I see her face.

179
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:35,602
Your cat?

180
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,234
Gran.

181
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,146
But now that you mention it,
Tina's in there too.

182
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:47,383
You do know that I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you?

183
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:50,798
That I am here for you,

184
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:53,105
to protect you?

185
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:55,445
And what if I don't wanna
need to be protected?

186
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:57,384
What if wanting to be
protected makes me feel

187
00:16:57,504 --> 00:17:00,362
like the helpless little girl
I used to be all over again?

188
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,239
All of the things that
you need to be protected from,

189
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:10,264
all of the trouble you're in,

190
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:12,742
you're in because of me.

191
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:15,056
So

192
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:18,664
you needing to be protected
has nothing to do with you

193
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,234
or who you are.

194
00:17:23,163 --> 00:17:24,663
All of it is my fault.

195
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,229
So why don't you just go to sleep,

196
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,042
and let me be the one
to worry about it?

197
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,471
All the trouble I'm in.

198
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:45,880
It's mine. I chose it.

199
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,303
- I chose it when I chose you.
- Yes, but...

200
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:51,991
Don't you think I wanna
blame somebody else?

201
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,909
But what happened to my gran,

202
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:57,598
and now to poor Tina,

203
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:02,316
it's my fault. And it's sweet of you
to try to take it on for me,

204
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:05,753
but if I let you, I'd be so mad at you,
I'd never be able to look at you again.

205
00:18:07,022 --> 00:18:08,629
And right now your face

206
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:11,677
is just about the only thing
getting me by.

207
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:16,375
So why don't we just
leave it on me, okay?

208
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:20,059
Very well.

209
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:34,532
Night, Bill.

210
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:02,945
- You're a fucking dead woman.
- Oh, my God!

211
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:06,981
Honestly, you are like a little boy.

212
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:09,424
Did I scare you?

213
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,215
Come here, lie down.
I wanna show you something.

214
00:19:20,113 --> 00:19:22,121
- What we looking at?
- The trees.

215
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:25,156
But we're not just looking,
we're listening too.

216
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:27,808
Listening to trees?

217
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,410
Can you hear that?

218
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:35,081
It's like the leaves are talking.

219
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:37,178
They're laughing.

220
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,276
Because they're ticklish.

221
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:44,754
That's right.

222
00:19:54,335 --> 00:19:55,492
We still high?

223
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:01,677
Because I don't normally
talk like this.

224
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:03,282
Plus,

225
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:05,748
I'm feeling kind of lightheaded too.

226
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:09,717
You're talking like this because
your mind is starting to open up.

227
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:14,006
And you're lightheaded because you
haven't eaten anything. So here.

228
00:20:15,462 --> 00:20:16,908
Have an almond,

229
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:18,370
they're raw.

230
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:25,929
Oh, my God.

231
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:29,452
These crazy good.

232
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:33,024
That's why we gotta change the way
you eat. Raw foods. Nothing processed.

233
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:36,010
Because the cleaner the body,
the cleaner the soul,

234
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,323
the cleaner the experience.

235
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,138
Cleaner than last night?

236
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,380
Much cleaner.

237
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:03,280
He'll stop.

238
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,579
He'll stop.

239
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:15,650
Ain't you worried
somebody's gonna hear him?

240
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:18,069
We live in the middle of nowhere
of the middle of nowhere.

241
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:21,993
- Yeah, I guess, but...
- He isn't a person, Jason.

242
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:24,175
Did I say he was?

243
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:25,973
All I'm saying is...

244
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,092
My truck, for example.
It ain't a person either.

245
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:34,530
But I still fill it with gas
and give it oil from time to time.

246
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:38,006
- You're saying we should feed him now?
- Ain't he gonna die if we don't?

247
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:39,342
Who cares?

248
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,348
I just... I still think we should
have a plan, that's all.

249
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,808
I do have one.

250
00:21:50,618 --> 00:21:51,719
And here it is.

251
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,371
Everything's gonna work out,
because it has to.

252
00:21:56,168 --> 00:21:57,494
That ain't a plan.

253
00:21:57,614 --> 00:21:59,453
Because when I am with you,

254
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:00,925
what I feel...

255
00:22:01,836 --> 00:22:04,294
I've never felt that
with anybody else ever before.

256
00:22:06,947 --> 00:22:08,528
And I'm a person that...

257
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:11,656
That a lot of bad stuff has
happened to in the past.

258
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:14,307
And so I deserve this.

259
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:17,763
I love you.

260
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:31,949
Oh, my God.

261
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:36,490
Oh, my God. I mean, why is it
that we all need to be loved,

262
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,259
but then when somebody
finally says, "I love you,"

263
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:40,937
people just run scared.

264
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,610
I love you,

265
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:46,855
whether you like it or not.

266
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:49,650
I'm not afraid to admit it.

267
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,190
Know what?

268
00:22:57,197 --> 00:22:58,449
You're right.

269
00:22:59,966 --> 00:23:01,080
Fuck it.

270
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:05,301
I love you too.

271
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:18,216
Say it again.

272
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:21,912
- l...
- Come on.

273
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:24,642
You get it once, that's all.

274
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
Ten.

275
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:30,179
Nine.

276
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:32,059
Eight...

277
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,957
Don't you knock? What if
I was doing something private?

278
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:39,437
I taught you that was a sin against God.
So if I walk in on you doing it,

279
00:23:39,557 --> 00:23:41,681
it's your problem, not mine.
What do you want?

280
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:44,716
- Sam's here to see you.
- You ain't sleeping with him, are you?

281
00:23:44,878 --> 00:23:46,527
What makes you jump
to that conclusion?

282
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:48,629
He brung flowers.
Men only bring flowers

283
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:50,864
if they already slept
with you and looking to again.

284
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:54,143
That especially goes for white men,
as black men are less prone to grovel.

285
00:23:59,835 --> 00:24:00,857
What do you want?

286
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:06,113
To apologize for anything
I said that hurt your feelings

287
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:10,491
- and sort things out between us.
- That's a load. It's sex he wants.

288
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:15,389
- She drinking again?
- Nope.

289
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:18,159
That's her, stone-cold sober.

290
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:20,994
- Look, you should go.
- Why?

291
00:24:21,114 --> 00:24:23,430
Because I'm just
too fucked up for this.

292
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,400
I hate to break it to you,
you're not the most

293
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,592
fucked up person in this house,
much less this town.

294
00:24:27,754 --> 00:24:29,820
What do you think
this is between us anyway?

295
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,906
We were clear from the beginning
it was just gonna be us fucking.

296
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:34,441
It's too late for that.

297
00:24:34,561 --> 00:24:37,077
- What are you, a masochist?
- No, I'm not at all.

298
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:39,429
But I've spent my life
running away from people

299
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:42,482
or pinning my hopes on somebody
I can't have. I'm done with that.

300
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,926
Like it or not, you've reminded
me that I'm a social animal.

301
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,797
I'd rather deal with your
fucked up shit than be alone.

302
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:50,891
Here's some fucked up shit
for you to deal with.

303
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,426
Do you know that right now,

304
00:24:52,546 --> 00:24:54,577
I'm thinking
I have a demon inside me?

305
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:56,371
And the solution is have

306
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,799
some crazy ass lady who lives
in a bus out in a swamp

307
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,835
perform a $800 exorcism on me that there
is no way in hell I can afford?

308
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:06,106
So go ahead.

309
00:25:06,226 --> 00:25:08,591
Now try and tell me you still
want something more with me.

310
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:11,678
Not if it's gonna be like this.
But I'd like it if we could have...

311
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:13,138
We can't, all right?

312
00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:17,559
Look, just go, okay? Get out of here
and save us both a lot of misery.

313
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,307
All right, I'll see you at work.

314
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,965
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

315
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:33,600
I know, right?

316
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,036
So you guys having
an engagement party or what?

317
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:38,643
We'd like to, but I don't know
where we'd throw it.

318
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:40,707
You know, our place
isn't big enough.

319
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:45,780
You could have it here, if you like.

320
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:49,449
Oh, thanks. But I wouldn't wanna
put you out like that.

321
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:53,012
You wouldn't be putting me out.
It'd be like any night, except I'd

322
00:25:53,132 --> 00:25:55,805
close the place to the public
for you and your nearest and dearest.

323
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:59,126
That would be amazing.

324
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:02,437
Except I was thinking could we maybe
do it in the warehouse next door?

325
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:06,647
Or even outside? 'Cause if we did it
in here, it'd feel like work, you know?

326
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,887
You were thinking, huh?

327
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:11,972
About the party I only just now
offered to throw for you?

328
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:17,577
You are a spectacular man.

329
00:26:18,965 --> 00:26:21,707
And you are one hell of a conniving
suck-up when you need to be.

330
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,954
I'll cover the catering
and the band.

331
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:29,505
Alcohol and all the other
incidentals are on you.

332
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,548
Got it.

333
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:33,393
And I may be conniving,
but I still mean it.

334
00:26:33,513 --> 00:26:36,345
You are gonna make some woman
extremely happy one day.

335
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:39,598
Maybe I'll meet a woman who's willing
to take that chance with me.

336
00:26:39,718 --> 00:26:42,855
- Morning, Sookie.
- Ain't nothing good about this morning.

337
00:26:58,258 --> 00:26:59,640
"Secret Sauce"?

338
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:02,400
Who you fucking kidding?
Since when is it right to call

339
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,725
mayonnaise a fucking secret?

340
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,259
I don't know.

341
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:07,778
I kind of like it, though.

342
00:27:08,507 --> 00:27:10,546
You can like it all you want to.

343
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:12,049
It's still mayonnaise.

344
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,668
What are you thinking?

345
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:18,878
Thinking fucking roots should
learn where to grow, them.

346
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:22,359
What?

347
00:27:29,018 --> 00:27:30,018
Wait!

348
00:27:32,472 --> 00:27:33,472
Wait!

349
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:39,205
The fuck, man?

350
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:41,619
Shut it down!

351
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,205
Get the fuck off me!

352
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,664
Asshole.

353
00:27:44,825 --> 00:27:46,959
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You got a screw loose?

354
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,864
- You could've killed me, you know?
- I'm sorry, I know.

355
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:52,334
But this ain't just some root
growing up out of nowhere.

356
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:54,174
It's connected to that tree.

357
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:56,457
Everything we see, man, it's all...

358
00:27:56,577 --> 00:27:58,886
- It's all connected...
- The fuck are you talking about?

359
00:27:59,048 --> 00:28:00,647
You some kind of tree hugger now?

360
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:02,683
You gonna kill
your best buddy to save a tree?

361
00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:04,084
Chill, son.

362
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:06,219
I could give a fuck if you're sorry!

363
00:28:06,522 --> 00:28:09,897
I'm about to get married.
There are people that count on me!

364
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:12,608
Okay, come on.
Let's go get you cleaned up.

365
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:17,219
Shit.

366
00:28:20,253 --> 00:28:21,492
Is everything all right?

367
00:28:25,116 --> 00:28:27,521
Tell me, Hoyt,
were you on the football team?

368
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:33,367
- Were you on the football team?
- No, I wasn't.

369
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,778
Then you do not call me Jay.
You got that?

370
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,533
Yeah, I'm sorry.

371
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:54,188
Goddamn it, Jay.

372
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:58,607
Goddamn it.

373
00:29:04,715 --> 00:29:07,060
- What can I get for you today?
- Your boss around?

374
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,283
Tell him you're looking for him.
What can I get you?

375
00:29:09,403 --> 00:29:11,451
Don't know, I haven't decided yet.

376
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:14,313
And while you make up your mind,

377
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:16,957
how about I tell you what you
can get for me?

378
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:20,331
I'd love to have whoever's killing off
my family's head on a platter.

379
00:29:20,451 --> 00:29:22,320
Think you could arrange that for me?

380
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,555
I don't appreciate your tone,
Miss Stackhouse.

381
00:29:24,716 --> 00:29:27,708
And I don't appreciate my officers
of the law enjoying casual lunches

382
00:29:27,828 --> 00:29:30,186
while there's a killer out there
trying to hunt me down.

383
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,855
Did you know he got into
my house again last night?

384
00:29:33,093 --> 00:29:34,908
- He did?
- Yes, and he killed my cat.

385
00:29:35,028 --> 00:29:36,824
He cut her head off
and took it with him.

386
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:39,146
Jesus. How come you
didn't call the station?

387
00:29:39,315 --> 00:29:41,238
Because they would've send you.

388
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,845
And if I had called,
you'd still be here right now

389
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:46,119
acting like you don't know
what you're gonna order

390
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:48,078
even though you always
have the cheeseburger.

391
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,457
Hey there, Detective,
I'll take your order.

392
00:29:50,577 --> 00:29:52,192
- No, it's my table.
- I got it.

393
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,014
Just take a break.
It'll do you some good.

394
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,754
What can I get for you?

395
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:05,387
Go with the goddamn
cheeseburger and fries.

396
00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:23,592
Listen, you all right?

397
00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:26,293
Sometimes I wish I smoked, you know?

398
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:29,949
So you could sneak outside without
anybody knowing there's something wrong.

399
00:30:34,855 --> 00:30:36,761
I'm really sorry about your cat.

400
00:30:39,097 --> 00:30:41,308
Maybe I shouldn't have
come in today.

401
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:43,050
Yeah, I was gonna say, why did you?

402
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:44,811
I don't know.

403
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:46,546
Maybe because lately it seems like

404
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:48,682
if I called in sick
every time somebody I loved

405
00:30:48,802 --> 00:30:51,058
got murdered I'd never make it
in for a single day of work.

406
00:30:51,947 --> 00:30:53,686
Don't you think
Sam would understand?

407
00:30:53,848 --> 00:30:56,290
I guess. But if I went home,
what would you do?

408
00:30:56,475 --> 00:30:58,592
Me? What's it got to do with me?

409
00:30:58,712 --> 00:31:01,330
Well, with Arlene doing nothing
but showing off her ring

410
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,238
to anybody who will look at it,
you'd be the only one waiting tables.

411
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:07,250
Yeah, she is gonna be
a handful, that one.

412
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,706
Can you imagine what she was like
the first time she got married?

413
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:14,358
What about you?

414
00:31:14,478 --> 00:31:15,828
You ever been married?

415
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,345
Is this the part where the sister

416
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:20,629
as what the girl's intentions
are with her brother?

417
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:24,737
Because right now,
I am all about protecting Jason.

418
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,990
He misses you, Sookie.

419
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:31,025
- Right.
- No, he does.

420
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,827
I mean, between your grandma passing

421
00:31:33,947 --> 00:31:36,312
and then what happened
afterwards with you...

422
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:39,382
- He told you about that?
- Yeah, he couldn't not.

423
00:31:39,502 --> 00:31:42,484
- I mean, he's a mess about it.
- Well, you wouldn't know it.

424
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:46,548
I know what you must think of him.

425
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,451
And I get why
you're mad at him, I do.

426
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:52,453
But he loves you.

427
00:31:54,201 --> 00:31:56,789
You still got people around you
who love you.

428
00:31:58,872 --> 00:32:01,488
And all I can hope
is that maybe one day,

429
00:32:01,608 --> 00:32:03,921
I can be counted in
among those people.

430
00:32:05,946 --> 00:32:09,437
You are way too good for him.
You know that, right?

431
00:32:10,022 --> 00:32:11,431
Of course, I know that.

432
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:12,879
I'm not stupid.

433
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:40,961
<i>You can call me all the names you want,
but I am confident in my position</i>

434
00:32:41,081 --> 00:32:43,163
<i>that when the day comes
that I meet my maker,</i>

435
00:32:43,283 --> 00:32:44,700
<i>it is I who will be allowed</i>

436
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,541
<i>to pass through the gates
into the glory of eternity.</i>

437
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:50,971
<i>Thank you, Reverend. Miss Flanagan,
would you like to turn the conversation</i>

438
00:32:51,091 --> 00:32:52,439
<i>back to the VRA?</i>

439
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,223
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

440
00:32:54,385 --> 00:32:57,611
<i>After the massacre of three of our kind
in Louisiana earlier this week</i>

441
00:32:57,731 --> 00:33:00,976
<i>I think the world should take notice
of the fact that we have not retaliated.</i>

442
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:02,482
<i>And we will not.</i>

443
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:06,186
<i>Which leaves us with the question
of exactly who is hunting whom</i>

444
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:09,740
<i>- out there in America tonight?
- I applaud your rhetoric.</i>

445
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,259
<i>That was very impressive.</i>

446
00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:13,072
Shut the fuck up!

447
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,836
Thank you.
Thank you. Please, I...

448
00:33:25,154 --> 00:33:27,774
What is it?
I need you to move me.

449
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:31,176
Too much pain. This chair
is digging into my skin.

450
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:32,845
Thought y'all couldn't feel pain.

451
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,282
When you don't drink,

452
00:33:35,402 --> 00:33:38,471
your body... Your whole body
aches more than anything

453
00:33:38,591 --> 00:33:40,227
I ever felt when I was alive.

454
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:41,389
Please?

455
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:44,986
- Well, if I move you, will you shut up?
- I promise.

456
00:33:45,912 --> 00:33:48,495
- This better not be a trick.
- It's not.

457
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:50,429
And don't you fucking bite me.

458
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:52,885
I don't even have the energy.
Just, please?

459
00:33:56,056 --> 00:33:57,337
Jesus.

460
00:33:57,457 --> 00:33:59,940
For a vampire,
you sure are a doughy fuck.

461
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,060
I'm sorry.

462
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:06,145
There. That any better?

463
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:08,360
I think so, yeah.

464
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:12,586
Yeah, good,
'cause now I'm all fucked up.

465
00:34:26,052 --> 00:34:27,428
What the hell?

466
00:34:33,642 --> 00:34:36,310
I found an envelope
full of cash in my cubby.

467
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:40,370
- You know anything about it?
- We'll talk after work.

468
00:34:40,532 --> 00:34:43,123
- You know I can't...
- I said, after work, all right?

469
00:34:43,303 --> 00:34:45,671
Anyone needs me,
I'll be in my office.

470
00:34:57,423 --> 00:35:00,690
<i>Yes, he's done it again.
Another lovely shot.</i>

471
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,828
<i>A hole in one.</i>

472
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:34,633
- Nice to meet you.
- Chow is Longshadow's replacement.

473
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:42,307
I take it by your being here,
there was no way around it, then?

474
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:45,712
I can't really say.
Didn't exactly look into it.

475
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:48,513
Tell me,

476
00:35:49,436 --> 00:35:52,235
do you enjoy it, living halfway up
his backside the way you do?

477
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,530
Yes, it's nice.
You should try it.

478
00:35:56,076 --> 00:35:58,491
We're gonna have to stop by the bar
where Sookie works first.

479
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,078
She needs to know that I'll be gone.

480
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,150
Don't forget how this started.

481
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:07,083
She came to Fangtasia to help you.

482
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,710
Fine.

483
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:10,377
Go to the bar.

484
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,546
Might be smart
to check out the competition.

485
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:14,466
Yes, indeed.

486
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:16,146
What's your game?

487
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,996
Excuse me?

488
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:20,697
You were playing Wii.
What's your game?

489
00:36:20,817 --> 00:36:21,817
Golf.

490
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:24,039
What's your best score
on Pebble Beach?

491
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:26,791
- Seven under.
- Mine's 11 under.

492
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:31,482
I liked Longshadow better.

493
00:36:31,778 --> 00:36:33,022
It still hurts?

494
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:35,777
That went right away.

495
00:36:36,387 --> 00:36:38,466
I guess that's a perk of me doing V.

496
00:36:39,204 --> 00:36:40,214
But this...

497
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,995
This stretching just feels
so goddamn fucking good.

498
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:45,393
Another perk.

499
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:51,019
Then what's with the weight, dude?
I thought all you vampires

500
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:52,548
were supposed to be in shape.

501
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,713
We are what we were
when we were turned.

502
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,507
I led a very sedentary life.

503
00:36:57,233 --> 00:37:00,291
- What's sedentary?
- Desk job. I was an accountant.

504
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,072
Sat around a lot,
ate a lot of junk food.

505
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:07,912
How's someone go
from being an accountant

506
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,415
to being a vampire?

507
00:37:09,779 --> 00:37:11,640
It wasn't the straightest line.

508
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,797
I always had this sense
that it wasn't

509
00:37:16,056 --> 00:37:18,081
really my life I was leading.

510
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,501
But I convinced myself
it was the life I wanted.

511
00:37:22,464 --> 00:37:23,568
Then one day,

512
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,376
about a year ago,

513
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:27,747
I came home from work
to find my wife crying

514
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:30,860
like her whole family had just died.

515
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,653
Turns out my son
had had a fist fight at school.

516
00:37:35,798 --> 00:37:39,342
So one of the kids suggested to him
that I might be a fucking faggot.

517
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,393
Kids are morons.

518
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:47,229
That's precisely the reaction
my wife wanted me to have.

519
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:49,507
And when I didn't...

520
00:37:50,676 --> 00:37:54,353
- What, she never even had a clue?
- How could she, when even I didn't?

521
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:59,654
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

522
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:04,414
Comes a point in life when you realize
everything you know about yourself,

523
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:06,619
it's all just conditioning.

524
00:38:09,073 --> 00:38:12,126
It's the rare man
who truly knows who he is.

525
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,585
At least I accomplished that.

526
00:38:18,186 --> 00:38:20,590
I guess it helps
that you don't look all that gay.

527
00:38:24,466 --> 00:38:26,039
Most of the gays I've come across,

528
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,784
- they look like...
- You.

529
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,576
You're what we're supposed
to look like.

530
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,626
Anyway, after she left me
and took my kid,

531
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:39,980
I went to a gay bar,
hit on a couple of men.

532
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:41,988
Got laughed at.

533
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:43,197
Or pitied.

534
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,972
Then I saw this one guy.

535
00:38:47,177 --> 00:38:49,338
He was even less
of a looker than me,

536
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:53,367
and he had beautiful
young men all over him.

537
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,752
Somebody told me he was a vampire.

538
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:58,291
I guess I just thought:

539
00:38:59,165 --> 00:39:00,339
"That's for me."

540
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:04,515
After that,
it was just a matter of time

541
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:07,021
before I found someone
willing to turn me.

542
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:09,723
That's crazy.

543
00:39:09,883 --> 00:39:12,476
I told you it wasn't
the straightest of lines.

544
00:39:17,517 --> 00:39:18,351
So...

545
00:39:20,664 --> 00:39:23,470
how did it work out for you?
With the guys and everything?

546
00:39:27,895 --> 00:39:28,783
You tell me.

547
00:39:37,486 --> 00:39:40,633
- I'd like that on the side, please too.
- Okay, coming right up.

548
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:47,872
- What's going on?
- His place is even more depressing

549
00:39:47,992 --> 00:39:49,450
than I thought it'd be.

550
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:52,242
- What are they doing here?
- Give me a minute

551
00:39:52,362 --> 00:39:53,809
and then we'll talk. Where's Sam?

552
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:56,020
- I don't know. Why?
- He's in his office.

553
00:40:00,021 --> 00:40:02,792
- Try to behave yourself.
- Don't I always?

554
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:07,845
<i>It's Bill Compton.</i>

555
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:10,688
<i>I need a minute of your time,
if that's all right.</i>

556
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:13,956
It's open.

557
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:19,054
- Who's this?
- His name's Chow.

558
00:40:19,174 --> 00:40:21,003
- He need to be in my office too?
- Yes.

559
00:40:21,757 --> 00:40:24,423
I have very little time,
so I'll be brief.

560
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,545
I've been called away.

561
00:40:27,906 --> 00:40:30,763
And I need you to watch over Sookie,
protect her while I'm gone.

562
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:34,892
That's just priceless.

563
00:40:35,052 --> 00:40:37,530
Don't expect her to be
too keen on the idea.

564
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,731
Sookie hates feeling
like she doesn't have her independence.

565
00:40:40,891 --> 00:40:43,968
I'm really starting to get fed up
with you telling me who Sookie is.

566
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:45,319
I know.

567
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:48,100
And I also know
how you feel about her,

568
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:49,615
and I don't like it.

569
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:53,160
But I'm asking you
because you're the only one I can ask.

570
00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:57,247
You're the only person I know of
who can protect her in my absence.

571
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:03,446
Will you do it?

572
00:41:06,241 --> 00:41:07,497
Of course I will.

573
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:11,309
But I'll be doing it for her,
not for you.

574
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:15,431
Thank you.

575
00:41:23,311 --> 00:41:26,568
So simply present this card at the door
when you get to Fangtasia,

576
00:41:26,966 --> 00:41:28,739
and the first round is on me.

577
00:41:29,499 --> 00:41:32,366
Also, Thursdays are ladies nights,
so be sure to bring a date.

578
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:34,243
That is, if you can get one.

579
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:36,900
She got you.

580
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:39,666
- Thanks, ma'am.
- Not him.

581
00:41:41,077 --> 00:41:43,168
- He doesn't get one.
- What gives, bro?

582
00:41:46,098 --> 00:41:48,082
What'd you do to your arm there...

583
00:41:48,868 --> 00:41:49,678
bro?

584
00:41:56,802 --> 00:42:00,190
- I take it your business here is done?
- I came to talk to Sookie.

585
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:04,398
I'll give you three minutes.
We have a tribunal to get to.

586
00:42:05,884 --> 00:42:06,692
What?

587
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,761
Come with me.

588
00:42:11,148 --> 00:42:13,606
Before I go, a word of advice:

589
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:18,607
We know when a human has wronged us.
We can smell it.

590
00:42:21,421 --> 00:42:25,224
Do not make the mistake of letting the
pretty blond vampire lady on television

591
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:27,279
make you feel too comfortable.

592
00:42:28,497 --> 00:42:30,504
We may not have retaliated...

593
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:32,666
yet.

594
00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:36,480
We know who you are.

595
00:42:40,584 --> 00:42:41,899
Have a nice night.

596
00:42:43,263 --> 00:42:45,566
- I have no choice, I have to go.
- Why?

597
00:42:45,686 --> 00:42:48,827
- Because I killed a vampire.
- I know that, I was there, remember?

598
00:42:48,947 --> 00:42:50,986
He was gonna kill me.
You were defending me.

599
00:42:51,704 --> 00:42:54,808
If one of you killed another one of you
defending one of us, you don't think

600
00:42:54,928 --> 00:42:57,300
- there would be a trial?
- I'll come with you then.

601
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,037
I can and I'm going to.
I wanna testify for you.

602
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:02,039
Damn it, Sookie, you can't.
You can't come.

603
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:03,677
And you can't testify.

604
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:06,428
You will not be welcome there.

605
00:43:07,174 --> 00:43:08,360
You lied to me.

606
00:43:08,942 --> 00:43:11,355
You said that everything
was gonna be okay,

607
00:43:11,475 --> 00:43:12,848
but it's not, is it?

608
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:18,047
I honestly don't know.

609
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:24,293
Just look after yourself, all right?

610
00:43:25,861 --> 00:43:27,808
I've asked Sam to watch over you.

611
00:43:27,928 --> 00:43:29,771
I wish you hadn't have done that.

612
00:43:30,552 --> 00:43:33,041
Be smart, Sookie, and just let him.

613
00:43:33,788 --> 00:43:36,488
There's still somebody out there
who wants to kill you.

614
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:39,202
Fine.

615
00:43:39,888 --> 00:43:40,851
I will.

616
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:44,511
- Thank you.
- And time.

617
00:43:52,207 --> 00:43:53,545
If I had any feelings,

618
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:56,426
- I'd have the chills right about now.
- Not me.

619
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:07,579
Now.

620
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,948
You all right?

621
00:44:33,016 --> 00:44:34,508
Look, I'm sorry about...

622
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:38,458
Right now I don't even remember what
it is I'm supposed to be mad at you for,

623
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:40,866
so why don't we both
just forget it, okay?

624
00:44:40,986 --> 00:44:42,314
That's good by me.

625
00:44:45,176 --> 00:44:47,206
- It was in the flood.
- A flood?

626
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:48,789
Oh, my.

627
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,858
It was the shits.

628
00:44:53,165 --> 00:44:55,643
But you gotta play the hand
you're dealt, I guess.

629
00:44:55,763 --> 00:44:57,173
And when you say you...

630
00:44:57,293 --> 00:45:00,464
were living at your grandmother's,
I take it to mean your grandfather was

631
00:45:00,584 --> 00:45:01,790
already gone?

632
00:45:02,751 --> 00:45:03,866
I'm so sorry.

633
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:06,610
Why? It wasn't your fault.

634
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:10,669
It's that a boy needs a man in his life
to teach him what it means to be a man.

635
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:15,059
Whatever.

636
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,623
That's the hardest part
of all this for me.

637
00:45:18,238 --> 00:45:19,242
My boy.

638
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:22,387
He's got nothing but women
around him now.

639
00:45:22,672 --> 00:45:24,226
He needs me. I'm not there.

640
00:45:26,732 --> 00:45:28,646
I'm sure he'll be all right.

641
00:45:29,674 --> 00:45:31,036
I mean, look at me.

642
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:37,020
Don't you try to glimmer me.

643
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,014
Amy warned me about that.

644
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:41,281
I'm too depleted to glamour you.

645
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:45,285
That's something
I haven't quite mastered yet, anyway.

646
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,455
Really?
You can't just do it?

647
00:45:49,385 --> 00:45:52,152
Learning to be a vampire
doesn't happen overnight

648
00:45:52,272 --> 00:45:54,419
any more than learning
to be a man does.

649
00:45:59,045 --> 00:46:00,420
You gonna marry her?

650
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:02,725
Who, Amy?

651
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:04,858
I don't know.

652
00:46:06,684 --> 00:46:08,727
We haven't been together that long.

653
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,477
But...

654
00:46:15,153 --> 00:46:16,715
just between you and me?

655
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,237
- I could really see her being the one.
- She's not.

656
00:46:22,502 --> 00:46:24,492
- What?
- Don't do it. Don't marry her.

657
00:46:24,612 --> 00:46:26,770
- Ain't none of your business.
- She's a psychopath.

658
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,597
- Fuck you, Eddie.
- She is.

659
00:46:28,717 --> 00:46:30,889
She is far more dangerous
than I could ever be.

660
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:32,157
That's enough.

661
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:40,264
Look, I gotta go out
and get some more beer.

662
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:44,028
But while I'm gone,
keep your fucking howling to a minimum.

663
00:46:51,221 --> 00:46:52,900
Can we talk about it now?

664
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,037
Sure.

665
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:58,003
That's not talking about it.

666
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:02,119
I can't take it.

667
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,572
- I appreciate it, I do. But...
- You're keeping it.

668
00:47:04,732 --> 00:47:07,824
- You can't tell me I'm keeping it.
- It's my money, so, yes, I can.

669
00:47:07,944 --> 00:47:10,662
- You're a stubborn son of a bitch.
- That makes two of us.

670
00:47:16,548 --> 00:47:18,979
You really believe
you have a demon in you?

671
00:47:24,254 --> 00:47:26,720
I think I got something
inside me that is...

672
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:28,000
scared...

673
00:47:29,673 --> 00:47:30,929
and pissed off...

674
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,113
and mean...

675
00:47:33,492 --> 00:47:34,655
And fucked up.

676
00:47:37,825 --> 00:47:39,522
Think it's stupid, don't you?

677
00:47:39,642 --> 00:47:43,298
Look, two years ago nobody even knew
there was such a thing as vampires.

678
00:47:43,731 --> 00:47:46,103
Now we gotta deal with them
every goddamn day.

679
00:47:47,067 --> 00:47:49,240
And who knows
what else is out there?

680
00:47:51,026 --> 00:47:52,714
Eight hundred bucks? That's...

681
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:54,289
That's a lot of money.

682
00:47:59,229 --> 00:48:00,795
People in this town drink a lot.

683
00:48:02,268 --> 00:48:03,454
I'm doing okay.

684
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,182
So I guess I'm having an exorcism.

685
00:48:19,386 --> 00:48:20,523
You're welcome.

686
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,320
I don't know how to ever thank...

687
00:48:31,064 --> 00:48:32,867
Interesting night, huh, Sook?

688
00:48:33,186 --> 00:48:34,213
I guess.

689
00:48:34,647 --> 00:48:36,443
Maybe a little too interesting.

690
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:38,509
Shit, ain't no such a thing
as too interesting,

691
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:40,011
only too dull.

692
00:48:41,371 --> 00:48:42,808
<i>How big is your dick?</i>

693
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:52,914
You know what? There is such a thing
as too interesting.

694
00:48:59,299 --> 00:49:01,064
- Where's Arlene?
- She just left.

695
00:49:01,411 --> 00:49:03,569
Of course she did.
Listen, I have to get out of here.

696
00:49:03,689 --> 00:49:06,131
Would you mind covering
the rest of my side work for me?

697
00:49:06,614 --> 00:49:09,238
Sure, but is that really
the best idea,

698
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:11,370
- you going home by yourself?
- I'm not going home.

699
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,195
I'm going to stay at Bill's.
No one'll come looking for me there.

700
00:49:14,547 --> 00:49:17,126
- Okay, then.
- Thanks, I owe you one.

701
00:49:20,234 --> 00:49:21,467
No worries.

702
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:56,453
While I got you alone

703
00:49:56,573 --> 00:49:58,705
I wanted to say thanks for
everything you've been doing.

704
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:01,115
You're fitting in great around here.
Really.

705
00:50:01,235 --> 00:50:04,855
I should be the one thanking you.
Lord knows I really needed this job.

706
00:50:05,365 --> 00:50:06,739
But you are welcome.

707
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:09,469
So, where are the others?

708
00:50:09,692 --> 00:50:13,219
Arlene {\said she}had to get back to her kids,
Sookie took off a couple of minutes ago.

709
00:50:14,046 --> 00:50:16,041
- What?
- I know, I tried to stop her, but...

710
00:50:16,161 --> 00:50:18,700
- She say where she was headed?
- She was going to Bill's.

711
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:19,976
Goddamn it.

712
00:50:24,437 --> 00:50:25,599
Hey there, Sam.

713
00:50:27,162 --> 00:50:29,564
Turns out that little story
you told me the other day

714
00:50:29,684 --> 00:50:33,004
about growing up in a nudist colony
didn't exactly check out.

715
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:34,581
We need to talk.

716
00:50:35,207 --> 00:50:36,405
Sure, just...

717
00:50:37,503 --> 00:50:40,455
You know, I forgot something in the bar,
but I'll be right back.

718
00:50:40,928 --> 00:50:41,738
Okay?

719
00:50:58,341 --> 00:50:59,345
Hey, dog.

720
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:02,727
Screw you too.

721
00:51:21,405 --> 00:51:25,374
My God. Didn't anyone ever tell you
not to sneak up on people like that?

722
00:51:26,314 --> 00:51:28,419
What are you doing
so far away from home?

723
00:51:29,884 --> 00:51:32,259
Tell you what, why don't you
come spend the night with me

724
00:51:32,379 --> 00:51:34,800
and I'll take you back
to Merlotte's tomorrow, okay?

725
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:44,252
Come on.

726
00:51:44,987 --> 00:51:46,478
It's night-night time.

727
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:49,160
Come on.

728
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,207
Come on.

729
00:51:52,186 --> 00:51:54,612
You know, if we're gonna be
sleeping together,

730
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,477
we're gonna need a name
to call you by.

731
00:51:57,862 --> 00:51:59,600
What do you think of "Dean"?

732
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,729
- I like it too.
- Dean. Dean the dog.

733
00:52:05,282 --> 00:52:08,091
Look at you, looking away.
What a gentleman.

734
00:52:11,111 --> 00:52:14,622
Here, would it make you more comfortable
if I got under the covers?

735
00:52:24,396 --> 00:52:25,417
Come on.

736
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,431
Hop up in bed with me.

737
00:52:28,298 --> 00:52:31,797
You can't sleep on the floor all night.
You're gonna catch a draft.

738
00:52:32,172 --> 00:52:32,986
Now,

739
00:52:33,209 --> 00:52:34,110
hop up here.

740
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:39,483
Good boy, Dean.

741
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:43,988
Sweet dreams.

742
00:53:20,794 --> 00:53:21,804
Wake up.

743
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,794
Wake up.

744
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:28,017
Here.

745
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,846
You brought me Tru Blood?

746
00:53:33,457 --> 00:53:34,584
Just drink.

747
00:53:44,984 --> 00:53:46,663
You're on my feet.
