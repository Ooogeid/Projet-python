1
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,848
Will you two shut up?
I can't think.

2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,449
Andy, what the hell did you do?
There's someone inside.

3
00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:20,144
- What happened?
- Step back!

4
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,238
- I got it.
- Andy's got it.

5
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,106
Don't touch anything.

6
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:27,624
- We were out trying to find Andy's car.
- Someone fucking moved it.

7
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:28,986
Suddenly, there's this...

8
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:32,215
- Person in there...
- We need an ambulance. Call the cops.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,109
What? I am the cops.

10
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,831
Oh, my God. Please tell me

11
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:38,537
- it's not Lafayette, please.
- Check for a pulse.

12
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,083
- Forget it. There ain't no pulse.
- What? Why?

13
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:44,710
Because there ain't no heart.

14
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:45,948
Sick fuck.

15
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,240
It's not him.
It's not Lafayette.

16
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,017
Who the heck is that?

17
00:00:53,624 --> 00:00:54,470
<i>Demon!</i>

18
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,692
Synchro: mpm, Arrow

19
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,657
<i>World's going to shit.
No respect.</i>

20
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:32,943
<i>Wonder if she even knows.
Poor sorry girl.</i>

21
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,655
<i>Miss Jeanette.
They'll find out I knew her,</i>

22
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,206
<i>that I went to her. Find out everything.
Fuck, I pushed her.</i>

23
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:41,327
<i>I cussed her out.
Now look at her.</i>

24
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,248
<i>Shit.</i>

25
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:44,704
Is there something else
you ain't telling me, Tara?

26
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:47,455
No. I have never seen
that woman before.

27
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,543
Careful here, son.

28
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,511
Her leg will break off
like a chicken wing

29
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:53,047
if you hold her like that.

30
00:02:53,228 --> 00:02:56,133
<i>What kind of sick fuck would throw
a body in a detective's car.</i>

31
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,501
<i>Shit.</i>
<i>I just got it detailed too.</i>

32
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:08,604
Over here.

33
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:14,458
Body's in full <i>rigor mortis</i>, Bud.

34
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:17,905
Which is consistent with the vic
being killed elsewhere

35
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:21,012
then brought here into the scene
sometime in the past four hours,

36
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,528
since that's when I...

37
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:24,635
drove over here.

38
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:29,583
Andy, why don't you call it a night?
Your sister's waiting on you.

39
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:32,392
Now? We've got a murder
investigation,

40
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:34,839
Bud, you need your
best detective on this.

41
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,591
I know, Andy,
but you clocked in at 8 a.m.

42
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:39,602
You're overworked.

43
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:41,602
You're also drunk.

44
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:42,972
What?

45
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:45,285
I am not

46
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:47,127
overworked.

47
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:50,739
I don't know about you, but...

48
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:54,627
I think I've seen enough dead bodies
to last me a lifetime.

49
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:58,445
Except this one, I just don't get...

50
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:03,252
With everyone Rene killed,
you could see his rage.

51
00:04:03,922 --> 00:04:05,070
But this...

52
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,371
Cutting out that
poor woman's heart...

53
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,340
Someone just wanted
to see her suffer.

54
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:14,926
Every time I think I know
what's what it turns out

55
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:17,944
I don't know anything.

56
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:22,446
I'm good to close up
and go home if you are.

57
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:25,556
Sweetie, how did you know the woman
that got killed?

58
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:27,834
Sookie, I told you, I nev...

59
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:32,916
That was...

60
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:36,150
That was the woman who gave me
and my mamma the exorcism.

61
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:40,337
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

62
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,824
You're gonna have to tell
the police about it.

63
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:45,923
You know that.

64
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,210
Shit.

65
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:53,292
I'll probably have to spend
all night answering questions.

66
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,850
My mamma's gonna fall to pieces
when she finds out.

67
00:04:58,503 --> 00:04:59,752
Listen, you go home.

68
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:02,054
Sookie and I will close up.

69
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:04,775
Kenya.

70
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:06,388
I remembered something.

71
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:12,353
Your bedtime will be at 4 a.m.
and not a minute later.

72
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:15,445
- Whatever.
- And whilst you are under my roof,

73
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,361
hunting is completely forbidden.

74
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:20,486
Like I'd know where to find
people in this bumfuck town.

75
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:22,071
Are we even in a town?

76
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,911
We also recycle in this house.

77
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:28,360
Tru Blood and other glass items
go in the blue container.

78
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:31,363
And paper products
go in the white container.

79
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,117
Can I have one of those?

80
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:40,297
- Hello?
- <i>It's me.</i>

81
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:43,757
I'm gonna be a little late.
Something real awful happened out here.

82
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,441
<i>I'll tell you all about it.</i>

83
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:47,554
Do you need me?
I can meet you at the bar.

84
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:49,348
I always need you.

85
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,643
But... You just stay there,
It'll give me something

86
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,261
to look forward to.

87
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:57,648
Take your time.

88
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:05,616
Jessica, I'm gonna have a guest
coming over shortly,

89
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,620
- Can we eat her?
- You may not.

90
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,220
Well, who is she?

91
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:11,807
- Is she your girlfriend?
- Yes.

92
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,580
- Is she a vampire?
- No.

93
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:17,876
Do I have to be nice to her?

94
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,098
I need you to go upstairs
and get cleaned up.

95
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:22,381
Remove your makeup
and make yourself presentable.

96
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:24,640
I will not have you
looking like a slattern.

97
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:25,678
A what?

98
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:28,762
A lady of the evening.

99
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
Awesome!

100
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,810
"The Acts of the Apostles,
chapter 26, verse 18.

101
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:40,691
"Jesus informed Paul of his purpose,
"to open people's eyes,

102
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,749
"to turn them
from darkness to light,

103
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:45,235
"and from the power of Satan
unto God.

104
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:48,632
"If God is light,
then Satan is darkness.

105
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:52,318
"If we human beings
are the children of God,

106
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:55,467
"then creatures of darkness
are undoubtedly...

107
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:58,157
the children of Satan."

108
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,116
An exorcism?
Last time

109
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,048
it was a pig
in the middle of the road.

110
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:36,289
Crazy ass motherfucking Paul
Bunyan pig, if memory serves.

111
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,916
- Plus, a naked woman.
- What the fuck?

112
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:42,086
- That's what I saw.
- You've got quite an imagination.

113
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,410
As far as we know,
her name's Nancy Levoir.

114
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:48,467
And she's been a cashier
at De Soto's pharmacy in Keachi

115
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,009
for almost 20 years.

116
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:52,638
The woman's got a voodoo bus
out in the middle of the woods.

117
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,786
Any particular place in the woods?

118
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,911
Or just the middle of the woods
in general?

119
00:07:58,036 --> 00:07:59,384
Andy, sit down.

120
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:00,687
Help us out, Tara.

121
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,429
You're the only onewho knows her,

122
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:04,399
and she ended up dead
outside your workplace.

123
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,703
- In your car.
- While you were there

124
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:09,792
keeping me inside, pouring me
drink after drink after drink.

125
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:12,121
What was it
you didn't want me to see?

126
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:14,552
A word with you in private.

127
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:18,355
Don't go nowhere.
I know you're pulling something.

128
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:24,933
- You're done for the night.
- I know what I'm doing.

129
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:26,954
I got it under control.

130
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,228
At best, you're a material
witness to a homicide.

131
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,143
At worst, you could be a suspect.

132
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:35,619
That is bullshit.

133
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:38,865
- You can't be sticking your nose...
- Lord, sheriff.

134
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,567
What did they do to Miss Jeannette?

135
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:41,692
Tell me!

136
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:45,411
What did they do to her?

137
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:48,107
I told you not to call her up.

138
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:50,362
- It's a murder investigation.
- Tara, baby.

139
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:51,668
Is it true?

140
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,083
Is it Miss Jeanette?

141
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:07,166
She saved my life.

142
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,390
Mama.

143
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:12,886
There was no Miss Jeannette.

144
00:09:13,265 --> 00:09:15,301
She was just some woman
who worked in a pharmacy.

145
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,472
All that stuff on the bus,
it wasn't real.

146
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:19,933
- Don't you lie to me.
- She told me so herself.

147
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:22,102
You don't know what you're
talking about.

148
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:25,699
She's just saying all this 'cause
she's still angry with me.

149
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:28,566
No... I mean, yes,
but no, it's true.

150
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:32,070
She gave me ipecac and peyote and
made me think I was killing my demon.

151
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:36,069
It is a sin to speak ill

152
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,598
of the dead like that.

153
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:38,960
She was a good woman.

154
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,904
It was a scam.

155
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:43,415
She stole from you and from me.

156
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:46,175
- I'm so sorry.
- But she cured me.

157
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:48,505
She cured me.

158
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:51,215
I'm all right now, ain't I?

159
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:54,241
Ain't I still right?

160
00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:37,555
Bucket.

161
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:41,129
Bucket.

162
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:13,630
Please, I didn't do anything!

163
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:15,799
I don't know anything!
I swear!

164
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:17,529
Please, don't kill me.

165
00:11:21,603 --> 00:11:22,973
What do you want from me?

166
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,141
Tell me!

167
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:25,702
What the fuck?

168
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:35,981
Hey, where the hell are you going?

169
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:44,736
You?

170
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:47,211
Holy shit.

171
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:51,506
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I wish I knew.

172
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,563
Where the hell are we?
Who...?

173
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:57,485
Who are these people?

174
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,343
What the fuck is going on?

175
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,179
Will you shut your mouth,
you fucking inbreed.

176
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:06,772
Where... Where are they taking
that guy?

177
00:12:06,897 --> 00:12:08,047
I don't know.

178
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:10,562
But sometimes there are screams.

179
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:13,128
Jesus fucking Christ.

180
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:18,945
How long have you been here?

181
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:24,447
I ain't got no idea.

182
00:12:27,117 --> 00:12:29,349
They tore out
that poor woman's heart.

183
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:32,617
I have never seen so much fear
on someone's face.

184
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:36,490
I'm sorry you had to see that.

185
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:42,061
I couldn't keep the voices out,
I was in too much shock to resist.

186
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:44,769
There's just so...

187
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:47,349
So much noise.

188
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,455
This is the first quiet
I've had all night.

189
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,450
I need to tell you something.

190
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:03,286
Please, just...

191
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,007
Shut up.

192
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:09,231
Kiss me. Just make it go away
for just a little while.

193
00:13:12,163 --> 00:13:13,745
Well, hi, there.

194
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,327
You must be Sookie.

195
00:13:20,492 --> 00:13:22,339
I love your shower.

196
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:28,396
Mama, I'm sorry.

197
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:32,373
I didn't wanna have to tell you
all that stuff.

198
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,177
'Cause in spite of everything
you've done, there's some sick,

199
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:39,480
sick part of me
that can't bear to see you suffer.

200
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,869
And I thought if you found out
she was a fraud...

201
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:43,994
No, girl.

202
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:46,233
There wasn't no fraud.

203
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:49,640
I am living, breathing,

204
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:51,275
thriving proof

205
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:53,416
there wasn't no fraud.

206
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,531
I'm still healed.

207
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:57,185
Healed stronger than ever.

208
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:59,586
- You are?
- The Lord tested our faith

209
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,471
by taking Miss Jeannette
away from us.

210
00:14:01,596 --> 00:14:02,696
I stay true.

211
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,382
I wish I could say the same
about you, baby.

212
00:14:07,463 --> 00:14:08,863
I'll pray for you.

213
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:10,254
Don't.

214
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:12,890
I'm actually doing better
than I have in a long time.

215
00:14:13,015 --> 00:14:14,936
Well, let's pray
for Miss Jeannette, then.

216
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,962
There's something evil out there,
and it wanted her soul.

217
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:19,405
If you're not careful,

218
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,234
it's gonna come for yours too.

219
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,156
I came as soon as I heard.

220
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:32,042
- Are you all right, sweetheart?
- Yeah.

221
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:34,808
That's my mother.

222
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:40,587
Miss Thornton.
Maryann Forrester.

223
00:14:41,593 --> 00:14:42,872
I've heard all about you.

224
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:45,593
What a rare opportunity this is.

225
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:49,807
I've always wondered what it would be
like to gaze into the eyes of someone

226
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,050
so devoid of human compassion,

227
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:55,101
that you would abandon your own
child when she needed you most.

228
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:57,089
What?

229
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:00,875
Just as I thought.

230
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:03,193
Emptiness.
Nothing inside.

231
00:15:04,142 --> 00:15:06,821
It's always something out there
that gets all the blame or the credit.

232
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,934
- Wether it's Jesus or Jeannette.
- Who are you?

233
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:10,993
What I can't believe
is that your daughter

234
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,078
still manages to feel
any love for you.

235
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:15,247
Since you've abused,

236
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,967
betrayed and forsaken her love

237
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:18,528
since the moment she could feel.

238
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:20,203
That's extraordinary.

239
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:23,793
She's a hell of a girl.
Come on.

240
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:25,676
Let's get you home.

241
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:29,052
You killed her?

242
00:15:29,943 --> 00:15:31,293
Not entirely, no.

243
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:33,932
Well, you obviously
did something to this...

244
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:35,850
This....

245
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,485
- Now, how old are you?
- Seventeen.

246
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,189
Oh, my God.
Where are your parents?

247
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,122
Is she always like this?

248
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:44,919
So what then, you...

249
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:47,273
bit her?

250
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:50,645
You drained her?

251
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:55,424
- Did you have sex with her?
- No.

252
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:56,549
Old.

253
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:01,126
Jessica was brought to me
as a condition of my punishment.

254
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,180
I had to create a vampire

255
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,298
as reparation for the one
I destroyed to save you.

256
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,426
So this is all your fault.

257
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,093
Jessica, I need you
to retire for the morning.

258
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:22,606
My sleeping quarters
are beneath the stairs.

259
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:25,650
And you may stay there until
we make other arrangements.

260
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:27,835
- But I'm not tired...
- Go!

261
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:32,407
Compared to Fangtasia, this blows.

262
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:43,335
We can't turn her out.
Not yet.

263
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:45,655
She's a very young vampire.

264
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:49,372
At her age, with her impulses,

265
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:51,301
she could be dangerous.

266
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:53,511
Where has she been tonight?

267
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,805
Here with me, and before that,
with Eric and Pam.

268
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,846
So there's no way she could have
anything to do

269
00:16:57,971 --> 00:17:00,132
with the woman
with her heart missing?

270
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,506
Probably not.

271
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,703
Two weeks and...

272
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,905
you never said anything.

273
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:14,532
I've laid in bed for hours,

274
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,173
talking about my laugh,
your laugh, the weather,

275
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:21,706
rules of football,
and not once did you mention

276
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,941
- that you slept with and killed...
- I did not.

277
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:25,412
a 17-year-old girl.

278
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:32,226
For a century and a half,

279
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:34,658
I never turned a human

280
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:40,215
because I couldn't bear
to inflict the suffering I felt

281
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,740
when I was turned.

282
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:45,326
The pain of that is not
an easy thing to share.

283
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:47,671
If I'm with you, and she's with you,

284
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,401
then she is with me.

285
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:52,318
And I'm sure as heck
sharing in that.

286
00:17:52,746 --> 00:17:55,181
If I withheld anything,
it was only to protect you.

287
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,701
If she'd stayed with Eric
I still wouldn't know.

288
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:01,125
That's not protecting me,
that's lying to me.

289
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:05,798
How am I supposed to ever trust you
if you keep something like that from me?

290
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,754
What else are you keeping from me?

291
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,041
Nothing.

292
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,513
I can't stay.

293
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:21,806
Not tonight.

294
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,854
I've shared every dark, horrible
corner of my life with you.

295
00:18:29,273 --> 00:18:32,150
What made you think I couldn't
handle every bit of yours?

296
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,879
I'm a lot stronger than you think.

297
00:18:48,278 --> 00:18:51,379
The vampires as a group
have cheated death.

298
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:55,175
And when death has no meaning,
then life has no meaning.

299
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:59,137
And when life has no meaning,
it is very, very easy to kill.

300
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,192
Not true, Reverend Newlin,
life has great meaning for us.

301
00:19:02,317 --> 00:19:04,344
We've all known the joy
of human life.

302
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:07,256
And as several of your kind
demonstrated in Louisiana

303
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:09,728
three weeks ago,
we most certainly can die.

304
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:12,508
Your assertion is little more
than a veiled incitement

305
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,303
for your supporters to come kill us.

306
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,786
No amount of political grandstanding

307
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:19,863
can hide the fact that you know
who killed my family.

308
00:19:19,988 --> 00:19:21,868
Their blood is on your hands.

309
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,454
That's an outrageous accusation.

310
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:26,145
Can you back that up, reverend?

311
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,793
My father's death was an
assassination, pure and simple.

312
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,386
A killing meticulously planned,
ruthlessly executed.

313
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:36,380
From there, all we have to ask
is who stands the most to gain.

314
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:38,718
<i>We're running out of time.
Last word, Miss Flanagan?</i>

315
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,669
Clearly, Rev. Newlin's grief
over the loss of his father

316
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:44,766
hasn't hindered him from some
political grandstanding himself.

317
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:48,090
It's a beautiful, sunny morning
in America, Miss Flanagan.

318
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:50,210
I wish you were here.

319
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,941
Give me 12 hours, reverend.
I'll be right there.

320
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,859
All right, thank you, Nan Flanagan

321
00:19:55,116 --> 00:19:56,626
<i>and Reverend Steve Newlin.</i>

322
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:59,119
May His holy light shine
upon you, Sharon.

323
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:03,279
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

324
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:07,539
You're so handsome.
You're getting good at this.

325
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,010
Getting better.

326
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,129
I have a long way to go.

327
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,135
- Any notes?
- Well,

328
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,630
sometimes you can sound a little
too much like a preacher.

329
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:19,198
- Well...
- I'm just thinking ahead, darling.

330
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:22,178
You could be governor of Texas
if you play your cards right.

331
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,865
You know, you had her cornered.

332
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,306
I thought those fangs
were gonna come out any second.

333
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:30,867
I wish they would. That'd be a sight.
Let the world see what she really is.

334
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:33,624
Good morning, everybody, how'd I do?

335
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:35,782
- Thanks so much.
- Good. You were good.

336
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:38,251
Can you get some pineapple
out here? Thanks.

337
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:41,072
Hi. How are you doing?
Wish my dad was here to see you.

338
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,004
Thank you so much, reverend.

339
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:44,846
Have a good time.

340
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,993
Orry Dawson. You son of a gun.
Come here.

341
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:49,247
Oh, reverend. Ah.

342
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:51,885
Mrs. Newlin.

343
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,511
I have someone I'd like you to meet.

344
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:58,089
This here is Jason Stackhouse
from down the road of peace

345
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,407
in Bon Temps.

346
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,297
You're, like,

347
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:03,719
the most famous person I've met.

348
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:07,232
- We're all equals here.
- Wait. Bon Temps.

349
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:09,978
Weren't you the poor soul they were
accusing of these murders?

350
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:12,228
Yeah. I was.

351
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,564
But I was saved.
Just like Orry said

352
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,021
I would be.

353
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:18,594
And for the first time
in my life I feel like

354
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:21,534
- God has a purpose for me.
- Well, he does.

355
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,330
He does for us all.

356
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:26,703
This here's God's purpose for me.

357
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:30,351
I've been reading your father's book,
and it's really making me,

358
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:34,004
think about things.

359
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:35,919
Well, then you realize,

360
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,837
his true message is love.

361
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:40,632
Despite of what all those
liberal wing nuts say about him.

362
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,966
It's like he says.

363
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:44,260
"I'm coming from the darkness
into the light."

364
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,373
Jason's a newcomer to our flock,

365
00:21:46,498 --> 00:21:49,228
but he's been most enthusiastic
about the message.

366
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:52,310
- He's got great potential.
- That's a praise, coming from Orry.

367
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:55,570
He was one of my father's
closest advisors.

368
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:58,960
You know, I think Jason
would make a fine candidate

369
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:00,854
for the Light of Day Institute.

370
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:04,082
Steven and Sarah run
a leadership conference in Texas,

371
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:06,917
where they train the best
and brightest to spread our gospel.

372
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:09,710
Think of it as a springboard
for fulfilling your destiny.

373
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:13,331
- A leadership conference?
- It is a terrific

374
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,647
program, Jason.

375
00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:16,659
Now, if you have the time and money,

376
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:19,051
it is a once in a lifetime
opportunity.

377
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:20,672
How muchdoes it cost?

378
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:23,049
Well, now, I don't handle
the money myself...

379
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:24,258
2 000 dollars.

380
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,219
We cover room, board
and transportation

381
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,221
and you just pay
for your class fees.

382
00:22:28,435 --> 00:22:30,056
I don't know if I can afford that.

383
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,281
I know it's a hardship,

384
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:35,174
but there's no price for salvation.

385
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:36,604
Why don't you pray on it?

386
00:22:36,894 --> 00:22:38,544
God'll give you a sign.

387
00:22:41,232 --> 00:22:42,532
I'll pray on it.

388
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,195
God'll give me a sign.

389
00:22:46,224 --> 00:22:47,907
May his holy light shine upon you.

390
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,809
She was expecting you last night.

391
00:22:58,248 --> 00:23:00,342
Yeah, there was a bit of a...

392
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:03,006
- a murder in my parking lot.
- We heard.

393
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:10,702
I'll see if Maryann is available.

394
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,560
<i>How did you get in here?</i>

395
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:41,496
<i>If you'd broken it,
I'd be really angry.</i>

396
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:42,621
<i>I'll just</i>

397
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:44,190
<i>Go.</i>

398
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:45,788
<i>In this weather?</i>

399
00:24:47,054 --> 00:24:48,402
<i>Where are your clothes?</i>

400
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:51,174
<i>I don't know.</i>

401
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:55,159
<i>You are very interesting.</i>

402
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,910
<i>How old are you?</i>

403
00:24:58,035 --> 00:24:59,035
<i>Seventeen.</i>

404
00:25:05,785 --> 00:25:07,485
It's a beauty, isn't it?

405
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,160
Mycenaean, I'm told.

406
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:15,188
Maryann's still asleep.
Is there a message I may pass along?

407
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,183
Tell her I have something for her.

408
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,847
Have a seat, Mr. Lancaster.

409
00:27:00,972 --> 00:27:01,972
Thank you.

410
00:27:08,787 --> 00:27:11,677
Is there a problem
with my grandmother's papers?

411
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,376
I know you've asked for a copy
of the deed to the house.

412
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:16,325
Oh, no, no, that's all okay.

413
00:27:21,028 --> 00:27:23,478
I have some terrible news,
I'm afraid.

414
00:27:24,953 --> 00:27:27,503
Your great-uncle Bartlett
has passed on.

415
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,913
I know it's so soon
after your grandmother.

416
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:32,888
This must be quite a shock.

417
00:27:35,245 --> 00:27:36,845
Tell me what happened.

418
00:27:37,327 --> 00:27:38,327
Well...

419
00:27:39,663 --> 00:27:41,707
The Lincoln Parish Fire Department

420
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:44,382
found him a few miles
south of Simsboro.

421
00:27:45,476 --> 00:27:46,831
He washed up on the shore.

422
00:27:47,997 --> 00:27:49,667
How did he get
all the way down there?

423
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:54,158
The Walnut Creek
runs behind his house.

424
00:27:54,858 --> 00:27:57,717
Sheriff's guessing
he got too close and fell in.

425
00:27:58,128 --> 00:28:00,759
They're calling it
an accident officially.

426
00:28:00,884 --> 00:28:04,185
There's no sign of burglary
or forced entry at the house,

427
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,360
and he was such a sweet old man

428
00:28:06,837 --> 00:28:09,209
that there'd be no reason
to hurt him, anyway.

429
00:28:10,763 --> 00:28:13,528
There were no marks,
or anything on his body?

430
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:15,721
Well,

431
00:28:15,846 --> 00:28:18,275
there's gators
and fish in the water.

432
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,513
And he'd been there
for a few weeks, so...

433
00:28:22,273 --> 00:28:24,493
There's not much of a body

434
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:25,913
to speak of.

435
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:27,232
Oh, my God.

436
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:31,542
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

437
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,001
He was

438
00:28:33,489 --> 00:28:35,239
truly a kind, giving man.

439
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,458
I was proud to call him my friend.

440
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:46,484
The one consolation, Sookie,

441
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:50,019
is that your great-uncle
Bartlett cared for you deeply.

442
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,001
He stated in his will
that he wished for you to inherit

443
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:56,233
all his financial assets.

444
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:57,812
It's not much,

445
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,285
$11,000 near abouts.

446
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:03,115
But it's a token
of how special you were to him.

447
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,686
Go ahead. Take it.

448
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:10,118
It's yours.

449
00:29:43,473 --> 00:29:44,923
Stunning, isn't it?

450
00:29:46,055 --> 00:29:48,455
It's the god Pan
and his human lover.

451
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:50,616
And she doesn't have a name?

452
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,096
She could be any of us,
couldn't she?

453
00:29:56,393 --> 00:30:00,392
The Greeks knew there is the flimsiest
veil between us and the divine.

454
00:30:01,388 --> 00:30:04,767
They didn't see the gods as being
unaccessible as everyone does today.

455
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:06,859
Except for my mama.

456
00:30:06,984 --> 00:30:09,014
She thinks she's got
a direct line to Jesus.

457
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:11,542
You have an uncanny talent

458
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:13,859
for connecting everything
back to your mother.

459
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,439
Don't get me wrong. She deserved
everything you gave her,

460
00:30:16,598 --> 00:30:17,562
but still...

461
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:21,019
If you took care of yourself for once
instead of protecting her,

462
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:24,011
she'd still be your mother.
You'd just be happier.

463
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:31,558
I could use more papaya.

464
00:30:35,873 --> 00:30:38,945
Doesn't it seem like she's got
an endless supply of tropical fruit?

465
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,264
- And pot.
- Now, that I didn't notice.

466
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:44,388
I've been smoking pot
since I was 10.

467
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:45,761
My first kumqwat,

468
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,594
three months ago.

469
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,598
I thought I was bad.
Sneaking cigarettes when I was 12.

470
00:30:54,138 --> 00:30:55,899
God, if you think that's bad,

471
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:58,740
I don't even wanna tell you
the other shit I've done.

472
00:31:05,703 --> 00:31:07,031
Have you ever...

473
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:09,783
With Maryann?

474
00:31:13,395 --> 00:31:14,636
You must be high.

475
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,520
I mean, she's so far beyond me,

476
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:19,586
it's like she's on another plane.

477
00:31:19,894 --> 00:31:21,545
I'm starting to get her
more every day,

478
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,383
but I think the main idea is,

479
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:25,841
we're all luckier
than we can imagine.

480
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,333
Maybe you are.

481
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:31,004
You didn't just see
your first dead body last night.

482
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:37,315
You're lucky you made it
this far before seeing one.

483
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,975
Trust me, I've seen more
than I care to.

484
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:43,942
And you're okay with that?

485
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,855
Sure. It's lucky
I wasn't one of them.

486
00:31:48,526 --> 00:31:51,032
And I'm also lucky
you haven't moved my hand yet.

487
00:31:59,037 --> 00:32:00,115
Fresh towels.

488
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,482
They're Egyptian.

489
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:05,152
Thanks.

490
00:32:09,406 --> 00:32:10,344
I should...

491
00:32:11,218 --> 00:32:13,378
I should really
get changed for work.

492
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:46,394
Nobody needed towels.

493
00:32:52,743 --> 00:32:55,230
Yeah, I guess I do miss
that son of a bitch.

494
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:57,517
He was my best friend.

495
00:32:59,888 --> 00:33:01,138
Yeah, mine too.

496
00:33:02,797 --> 00:33:04,044
But then I think,

497
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:06,797
how could that be
the same fuck you...

498
00:33:06,922 --> 00:33:08,071
We never knew

499
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:09,859
who Rene really was.

500
00:33:09,984 --> 00:33:12,058
All those innocent people he killed.

501
00:33:16,236 --> 00:33:18,047
You know what I can't believe?

502
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,457
That God would let him die
for no reason.

503
00:33:24,512 --> 00:33:25,714
You know what I...

504
00:33:25,987 --> 00:33:27,237
When I was in jail,

505
00:33:27,362 --> 00:33:30,049
the Fellowship of the Sun,
they came to visit me.

506
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,052
The vampire haters?

507
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,803
No, it turns out they are
about a lot more than just vampires.

508
00:33:35,548 --> 00:33:38,509
If I'm ever going to find answers,
that's where it's gonna be.

509
00:33:40,427 --> 00:33:43,888
Why does it gotta be with them,
I mean, we got a church right here.

510
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,751
And what does that
backass church give you?

511
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:49,443
They teach me to be
a Christian, for one.

512
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:52,242
And not hate vampires,
or hate anybody else.

513
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:54,265
So you're hung up on the hating.

514
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:56,324
The Fellowship,
it's bigger than that.

515
00:33:56,557 --> 00:33:59,431
When I'm there, I feel like
I'm meant to be a part of it,

516
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,740
like I got a calling from Jesus.

517
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,550
Or from Steve Newlin himself.

518
00:34:15,216 --> 00:34:16,470
I heard about the...

519
00:34:18,383 --> 00:34:19,508
At Merlotte's.

520
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,933
I'm sorry.

521
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,967
Thanks, Hoyt, that's sweet of you.

522
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:27,204
Sidney Matt Lancaster
came by a bit ago.

523
00:34:27,745 --> 00:34:29,866
He had some bad news.

524
00:34:31,538 --> 00:34:32,945
Uncle Bartlett passed away.

525
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:36,942
What happened?

526
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,411
They're saying it was an accident.
He fell into the Walnut Creek.

527
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,599
Behind his house.

528
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:44,956
There's something else.

529
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:49,123
He left us an inheritance.

530
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,914
He left me the inheritance.

531
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:55,092
But I don't want it.
Here.

532
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:56,797
Wait.

533
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:58,972
Why did he leave it to you?

534
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,603
I was the one who used
to mow his lawn every Sunday.

535
00:35:01,728 --> 00:35:04,160
I don't know. He was old.
It's yours now.

536
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:05,894
Come on, now.
Maybe we should split.

537
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,279
I do not want it.

538
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:15,286
I gotta get to work.

539
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:18,391
It's good to see you, Hoyt.

540
00:35:38,363 --> 00:35:39,315
Thank you.

541
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,818
<i>Is this what you imagined
it would feel like?</i>

542
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,223
<i>All right, you stay with me.</i>

543
00:35:49,616 --> 00:35:51,666
<i>And we will do things...</i>

544
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,764
<i>that you cannot possibly imagine.</i>

545
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:03,994
<i>What's wrong?</i>

546
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:05,733
<i>Don't stop.</i>

547
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,333
<i>Don't stop.</i>

548
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:15,877
<i>What are you?</i>

549
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:18,214
<i>Baby boy,</i>

550
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:21,174
<i>you're not the only one
who's special in this world.</i>

551
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,684
I ignore when you're hiring
another waitress,

552
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,346
but me and Sookie are fixing
to drop dead from exhaustion.

553
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:33,315
I mean, look here.
Nine out of ten broken.

554
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:39,237
I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to put an ad out.

555
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:41,907
That's why Daphne's here.
She came in looking for work.

556
00:36:42,392 --> 00:36:45,243
I think you owe it to yourself
to at least give her an interview.

557
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,330
I used to work
at the Cracker Barrel in Alexandria.

558
00:36:51,096 --> 00:36:52,599
Yeah, sure.
Come on in.

559
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:53,724
Thank you.

560
00:36:56,662 --> 00:36:59,424
Can I start
parking over near your trailer?

561
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:01,635
Instead of, you know,

562
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:03,480
where the...

563
00:37:04,577 --> 00:37:05,472
You go ahead.

564
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:07,275
I love you.

565
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,693
Nine out of ten.

566
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,108
I'm Sam Merlotte.

567
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,292
Daphne, right?

568
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:19,559
I like the name.

569
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,742
I think it's French.
My mama is half Cajun.

570
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,119
So, Cracker Barrel, huh?

571
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:34,701
Some people think I'm an asshole.

572
00:37:35,512 --> 00:37:36,512
It's true.

573
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,815
I pick fights with strangers,
I've cussed out old ladies.

574
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,249
I even pissed
in my boss' coffee once.

575
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:45,377
You do not need
to be telling me this shit.

576
00:37:45,502 --> 00:37:47,440
What else do we have to do
down here?

577
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,563
I mean, don't you
talk to the others?

578
00:37:53,197 --> 00:37:56,087
Most of the time I just
keep to my fucking self.

579
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:01,639
And think.

580
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:04,674
Like about how to get out of here?

581
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:08,395
No. About why I'm here
to begin with.

582
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,017
All the shit I've done in my life.

583
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:13,546
The drugs,

584
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:14,854
the sex,

585
00:38:16,152 --> 00:38:17,300
the website.

586
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:20,291
I did it so my life
wouldn't be a dead end

587
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,095
and this is where I end up.

588
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:28,669
- What kind of punchline is that?
- See, that's why we gotta talk.

589
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:31,979
We have to tell each other all
the shit we've done.

590
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:34,101
That way, if one of us gets out,

591
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:36,678
he can tell the world
about both of us.

592
00:38:37,454 --> 00:38:38,859
I just hope it's me.

593
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:41,014
Whatever.

594
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:43,657
If it make you feel any better,
keep talking.

595
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:45,088
All right.

596
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,697
When I was 20,

597
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:50,890
my cousin Rufus,
he was going out with this girl

598
00:38:51,015 --> 00:38:52,916
who claimed she could crush
a beer can,

599
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,122
with her tits.

600
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,206
And one night, when we were alone,

601
00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:59,044
I asked her to show me.

602
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,019
One beer can lead to another,
and before you knew it,

603
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,092
she was crushing my head

604
00:39:05,114 --> 00:39:06,378
with her tits.

605
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:09,707
Rufus came home, and he was so mad

606
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:11,556
he threw me out of the window.

607
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:14,902
My hip shattered
into a million pieces,

608
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,669
and they replaced it

609
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,635
with metal.

610
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:22,966
My ass is magnetic now.

611
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:27,309
I pray to God you ain't
the last motherfucker

612
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:28,826
I meet before I die.

613
00:39:29,302 --> 00:39:30,548
Come on, come on.

614
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:32,350
What about you?

615
00:39:32,475 --> 00:39:35,032
You must've done
all kinds of shit you regret.

616
00:39:35,629 --> 00:39:38,089
Well, I got in trouble
with my boss once

617
00:39:38,214 --> 00:39:41,210
for punching out three
stupid rednecks at the bar.

618
00:39:42,986 --> 00:39:44,131
You regret that?

619
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,431
Hell, no, you fucking deserved it.

620
00:39:52,443 --> 00:39:54,939
I'm sorry I hassled you
for being gay.

621
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:57,769
I was an asshole about it.

622
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:01,828
At least I got through to you.

623
00:40:04,426 --> 00:40:06,338
If it makes you feel any better,

624
00:40:07,112 --> 00:40:08,946
when I was 15,

625
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:10,662
at Safety Patrol Camp,

626
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,001
I let my bunk mate blow me.

627
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,470
The name Nancy Levoir ring a ding?

628
00:40:36,522 --> 00:40:38,051
How about Miss Jeannette?

629
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,296
- Pitcher of Abida light.
- Not the usual Dixie draught?

630
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:43,123
No, Jason's not drinking,
and Hoyt says

631
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:45,151
his mama wants him
to watch his weight.

632
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,057
Please, she's one to talk.

633
00:40:47,182 --> 00:40:49,798
That woman's got more chins
than a Chinese phone book.

634
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,808
- Come on, have a drink with me.
- I don't drink no more.

635
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:56,561
I don't do nothing
that can screw me up.

636
00:40:56,686 --> 00:40:58,075
Them days are over.

637
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,792
You don't gotta be drunk
to bang my brains out, do ya?

638
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,811
I appreciate the offer, darling,

639
00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:06,138
but I'm happy hanging with my
buddy tonight.

640
00:41:07,285 --> 00:41:08,799
Are you two like, gay together?

641
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:12,094
No. Just turning over a new leaf.

642
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,030
Your loss, baby.

643
00:41:15,622 --> 00:41:16,770
How about you?

644
00:41:17,217 --> 00:41:18,569
Do you wanna party?

645
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,350
Never mind. Time's up.

646
00:41:22,628 --> 00:41:23,858
I don't teach.

647
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:25,825
I absorb.

648
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:35,693
I'd rather stay pure for that
leadership conference,

649
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:38,210
but if you wanna hit that,
man, I'm cool.

650
00:41:41,436 --> 00:41:44,335
No, I'm not much of a hitter,
you know.

651
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:47,821
I like 'em nicer than that.

652
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:50,491
Durastrong, 40-gallon trashliners.

653
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,573
Found one at the scene.
They sell them at club stores.

654
00:41:53,698 --> 00:41:56,012
You know anybody who uses them,
call me.

655
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:57,078
All right.

656
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,014
I was just out back,

657
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:05,002
and you can smell
the blood out there.

658
00:42:05,127 --> 00:42:08,066
What kind of sick animal
would keep a poor woman's heart?

659
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:09,577
You know Rene Lenier,

660
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:11,765
or Marshall, whatever his name was?

661
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,257
I heard that the
American Vampire League,

662
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:16,954
they wanted to teach him a lesson.
So they dug him up,

663
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,956
and they turned him
into one of their own.

664
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:20,690
So he could've killed that woman.

665
00:42:20,815 --> 00:42:23,674
Better be careful. Rene Marshall
might still get you.

666
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,811
Don't you people have any shame?

667
00:42:28,957 --> 00:42:30,642
His name was Drew Marshall.

668
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,327
And he's dead, and he's buried,
and he ain't never coming back.

669
00:42:43,087 --> 00:42:45,336
That's for your drinks,
now you all need to leave.

670
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:46,271
Up.

671
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,898
Shake a leg. Out!

672
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,775
- Go!
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

673
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,963
Keep walking.
Don't eyeball me.

674
00:42:52,088 --> 00:42:53,459
He's such a nutball.

675
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,809
You din't have to do that.

676
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,786
Leadership conference, huh?

677
00:43:03,151 --> 00:43:04,251
What church?

678
00:43:06,091 --> 00:43:06,958
Marlboro.

679
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,403
Baptist.

680
00:43:08,528 --> 00:43:09,585
In Baton Rouge.

681
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:11,591
It's only for a week.

682
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:14,030
Just give me a chance
to get away from everything.

683
00:43:14,155 --> 00:43:16,018
I wish I could take a week off.

684
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:20,933
I finally started cleaning out
Gran's room today.

685
00:43:21,813 --> 00:43:24,392
I couldn't even bear
to pack away a single thing.

686
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,596
Yeah, I know.

687
00:43:25,785 --> 00:43:26,947
I miss her too.

688
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:31,723
And I'm hoping maybe God'll tell me
why he had to take good people away.

689
00:43:31,848 --> 00:43:33,275
Like Gran and Amy.

690
00:43:33,526 --> 00:43:35,098
Jason, Amy was a V addict.

691
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,112
Yeah, that don't mean
she deserved to die.

692
00:43:38,419 --> 00:43:40,540
I can't help it, Sook, I loved her.

693
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,661
And when you love someone
you've got to love it all.

694
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,803
Otherwise it ain't love.

695
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,867
There you are, Stackhouse.

696
00:43:49,992 --> 00:43:51,670
Got a couple of questions for ya.

697
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:53,773
Humour him, he's toasted.

698
00:43:54,422 --> 00:43:56,181
Have a good time at church camp.

699
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,840
Here we go!

700
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:02,995
We won, we won!

701
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,018
There you go, darling.
One more time.

702
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:09,248
Tara, you know where Sam is?

703
00:44:09,373 --> 00:44:11,834
Out back. He's being
a little weird tonight.

704
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:14,650
I heard about your uncle Bartlett.

705
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,820
I'm sorry.

706
00:44:16,249 --> 00:44:17,091
Thanks.

707
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:19,248
I think I'll be fine.

708
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:21,645
I wish people
would stop dying around here.

709
00:44:24,098 --> 00:44:25,912
Try the A negative.

710
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,565
Less like ass than the A positive,

711
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,420
but more like ass
than the B negative.

712
00:44:39,065 --> 00:44:40,915
You have to keep your strength.

713
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:44,191
Two thirds of new vampires
never survive the first year.

714
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:46,362
I can't help it if I don't like it.

715
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:49,566
You know, Eric let me feed
on a guy with tattoos,

716
00:44:49,691 --> 00:44:51,006
and nipple piercings.

717
00:44:51,131 --> 00:44:52,414
I'm not Eric.

718
00:44:52,729 --> 00:44:55,065
You are so not Eric.

719
00:45:05,261 --> 00:45:06,920
Hardly seen you all night.

720
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,165
Well, haven't had the best day.

721
00:45:10,805 --> 00:45:12,876
The woman in the parking lot
or something else?

722
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,503
Don't feel much like talking.

723
00:45:18,455 --> 00:45:20,633
It's slowing down
pretty good in there, so I was...

724
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,632
You wanna cut out early
and go see Bill?

725
00:45:22,757 --> 00:45:24,488
I wouldn't ask you
if it wasn't important,

726
00:45:24,613 --> 00:45:26,306
but we had a fight, and there's...

727
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,516
I don't need to hear
every last detail of your life.

728
00:45:31,985 --> 00:45:34,813
I guess I've owed you an apology
for a while now.

729
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:38,077
I never meant to hurt you, Sam.

730
00:45:38,766 --> 00:45:40,227
You know how much I care about...

731
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:43,198
Don't it seem like you're always
either apoligizing or yelling at me?

732
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:44,985
Don't you get sick of it?

733
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:48,117
'Cause I sure do.
I can't be whatever you want

734
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:50,179
whenever you want anymore.

735
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,224
I'm tired of charring my ass
on your back burner.

736
00:45:55,731 --> 00:45:58,268
I will need you in early
to make up for lost hours.

737
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:01,810
In Keachi!

738
00:46:02,741 --> 00:46:04,992
You didn't get a prescription
filled out there?

739
00:46:05,117 --> 00:46:06,510
Don't lie to me.

740
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:08,742
You sure about that?

741
00:46:14,493 --> 00:46:16,188
What? I'm working.

742
00:46:17,183 --> 00:46:20,140
Clearing my name,
since I'm a suspect, allegedly.

743
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,422
Now, if you don't mind,
I'll just do-si-do round here.

744
00:46:25,558 --> 00:46:27,342
You're embarrassing yourself.

745
00:46:27,745 --> 00:46:30,344
I'm taking you off the case.
For your own sake.

746
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,289
I'm a good cop.

747
00:46:36,187 --> 00:46:38,795
I can close the case,
let me show people that, please.

748
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:40,421
Can't you go do something else?

749
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,541
I don't do anything else.

750
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:45,342
This is it.

751
00:46:47,776 --> 00:46:49,058
I'm sorry, Andy.

752
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,284
You have something of mine.

753
00:47:58,971 --> 00:48:01,407
Karl said you stopped by
with a gift.

754
00:48:04,222 --> 00:48:05,840
I do love presents.

755
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,151
I don't know
how you found me, but...

756
00:48:26,853 --> 00:48:28,988
I assume this is what you came for.

757
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:33,612
I'm sorry I was...

758
00:48:34,505 --> 00:48:36,284
young and scared at the time.

759
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,300
I remember.

760
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:51,010
Money.

761
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,383
My, you're a sweet thing.

762
00:48:57,591 --> 00:48:59,227
It's not your money I want.

763
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:03,766
Listen, If you think you can
get back at me by luring Tara...

764
00:49:03,891 --> 00:49:05,280
Get back at you?

765
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,361
How in the world
did you get the impression

766
00:49:10,486 --> 00:49:12,281
that this was about you?

767
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:15,831
What?

768
00:49:16,302 --> 00:49:19,364
Maryann said she was coming down
and she wanted to see you.

769
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,344
Still?

770
00:49:20,865 --> 00:49:23,580
You're either dumber than I thought,
or you're way too good for me.

771
00:49:23,705 --> 00:49:25,621
Cut it out. I just wanted
to see where you work.

772
00:49:25,746 --> 00:49:26,904
Is that so bad?

773
00:49:28,651 --> 00:49:30,185
You are a lucky man.

774
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:32,196
And since the bartender likes you,

775
00:49:32,726 --> 00:49:34,804
drinks are on the house.
What'll it be?

776
00:49:36,212 --> 00:49:37,515
Give me something sweet.

777
00:49:38,181 --> 00:49:39,648
I can ma you a rum and Coke.

778
00:49:40,886 --> 00:49:42,029
A margarita,

779
00:49:42,154 --> 00:49:43,445
or a white russ...

780
00:49:49,234 --> 00:49:50,737
That's more like it.

781
00:50:12,097 --> 00:50:14,394
All right, I guess
that's not so gross.

782
00:50:15,357 --> 00:50:18,097
Two parts O negative,
to one part B positive.

783
00:50:18,222 --> 00:50:19,350
Remember that.

784
00:50:22,535 --> 00:50:23,994
I need to talk to you.

785
00:50:24,723 --> 00:50:25,605
Alone.

786
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:28,045
Don't know if we can, with...

787
00:50:33,601 --> 00:50:36,288
Jess, I feel like
we got off to a bad start.

788
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:38,112
And it's totally my fault.

789
00:50:38,563 --> 00:50:40,494
I never got a chance
to hear your side of things,

790
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,830
find out what you're like,
none of that.

791
00:50:43,102 --> 00:50:44,248
Can you forgive me?

792
00:50:44,977 --> 00:50:46,854
You really wanna get to know me?

793
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:49,086
Of course I do.
You deserve that.

794
00:50:49,656 --> 00:50:52,481
And, frankly, I'm curious about you.

795
00:50:52,606 --> 00:50:54,842
I've just got one huge favor to ask.

796
00:50:56,106 --> 00:50:58,106
Give me tonight with my boyfriend,

797
00:50:58,231 --> 00:51:01,031
and we'll have all night
tomorrow to ourselves.

798
00:51:01,483 --> 00:51:02,558
Just us girls.

799
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:06,553
Sure.

800
00:51:06,678 --> 00:51:08,605
I guess I have
nothing but time now, right?

801
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:14,579
Good night.

802
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,783
I must say I'm impressed.

803
00:51:21,401 --> 00:51:22,995
It's almost like
you glamoured her...

804
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:26,082
Did you have anything to do
with Uncle Bartlett's death?

805
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:36,384
He hurt you.

806
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:40,569
My God.

807
00:51:42,491 --> 00:51:44,581
Is it that easy for you to kill?

808
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,353
Does human life
mean so little you can

809
00:51:48,047 --> 00:51:49,485
just kill on command,

810
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:51,690
toss someone in the water?

811
00:51:54,768 --> 00:51:58,223
I cannot have people dying
every time I confide in you.

812
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,619
I never felt more inhuman
than when I had to kill Rene.

813
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,182
It still haunts me.

814
00:52:03,808 --> 00:52:06,835
And now you've made me feel
like I killed another person.

815
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:09,395
I feel sick.

816
00:52:15,782 --> 00:52:18,142
I always thought,
as different as we are,

817
00:52:19,655 --> 00:52:20,623
somehow...

818
00:52:21,376 --> 00:52:23,117
we could still be together.

819
00:52:26,098 --> 00:52:27,684
And now I don't know.

820
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:31,529
I don't know anything.

821
00:52:39,597 --> 00:52:40,597
Please.

822
00:52:43,063 --> 00:52:44,530
Say something, Bill.

823
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:02,889
I cannot,

824
00:53:03,893 --> 00:53:05,731
and I will not lose you.

825
00:53:06,794 --> 00:53:08,315
For all the ways I have

826
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:09,854
dismayed,

827
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:10,937
aggrieved,

828
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,640
or failed you,

829
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:14,845
I swear, I will atone.

830
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:18,259
But I am not sorry.

831
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,936
I refuse to apoligize

832
00:53:22,061 --> 00:53:24,826
for what you have awakened in me.

833
00:53:28,264 --> 00:53:30,040
You are my miracle, Sookie.

834
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,894
For the first time in 140 years,

835
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:36,359
I felt something,

836
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:39,560
I thought had been
lost to me forever.

837
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:45,346
I love you.

838
00:53:48,147 --> 00:53:50,476
And for that,
I shall never feel sorry.

839
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,003
Damn you, Bill Compton.

840
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:57,752
I love you.

841
00:55:25,543 --> 00:55:26,905
I got a plan.

842
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:28,858
- I'm busting us out.
- Don't be an idiot.

843
00:55:28,983 --> 00:55:30,868
- I'll come back for you. Promise.
- Shut up.

844
00:55:37,652 --> 00:55:39,877
Shushing won't do you any good,
sweetheart.

845
00:55:40,436 --> 00:55:42,120
We hear everything.

846
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,674
Since you made me come
all the way down here,

847
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,643
I'm gonna take out
some of the garbage.

848
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:56,147
Royce Allen Williams,

849
00:55:57,348 --> 00:55:58,917
we have a few questions for you,

850
00:55:59,042 --> 00:56:02,565
with regard to a fire
which killed three of our kind.

851
00:56:02,757 --> 00:56:04,257
No fucking way, man.

852
00:56:04,566 --> 00:56:06,070
I don't know anything.

853
00:56:06,195 --> 00:56:08,154
Crimes against vampires
are on the rise.

854
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:10,875
We even lost a sheriff
just days ago.

855
00:56:11,617 --> 00:56:12,660
We seek answers.

856
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,374
Die, you dead fucker!
