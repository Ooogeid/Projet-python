1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,589
What the hell are you doing here?

2
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:05,020
Nothing. Sleeping.

3
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:07,636
Did you touch me?
Hell no, I swear.

4
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:10,841
Sookie, listen. Bill asked me to look
after you while he was away.

5
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:12,682
Did he ask you to do it buck-naked?

6
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:16,727
- I want you out of here. Now.
- Listen, Sookie.

7
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:21,191
I need to tell you something about me,
something I've never told.

8
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:23,332
Oh, my God, it's you.

9
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:26,154
- You're the murderer.
- No, no, Sookie...

10
00:00:26,357 --> 00:00:28,324
Oh, my God, you killed
my grandmother.

11
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:59,853
I'm not the killer, I swear.

12
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:03,097
I'm a shape-shifter.

13
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:07,432
Shut the fuck up.

14
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:29,527
Synchro: Arrow, mpm

www.sub-way.fr / www.seriessub.com

16
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:46,218
What's that for?

17
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:50,092
- Give me your hand.
- Why?

18
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:53,476
"Why, why, why. Why's it have to
be in the woods?

19
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:56,048
"Why's it have to be before dawn?

20
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:58,482
"Why 799.95?

21
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:00,294
Why, why, why."

22
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:03,066
You think knowing the answers
will save you?

23
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,771
Shut up and give me your hand.

24
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,317
Oh, you nasty bitch.

25
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,683
That's cleaner than anything
you've ever touched.

26
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,117
Hold it over the fire.
Keep it there.

27
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:22,962
Angelica root and spit.

28
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:26,946
A lot stronger than holy water.

29
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:30,998
You got poison
oozing out your pores.

30
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:33,748
You live near a highway?

31
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:37,689
Cook with a microwave
or talk on a cell phone?

32
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:39,364
- Who doesn't?
- I don't.

33
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,074
All that pollution and technology,
that's how demons travel.

34
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:47,990
That's why I stay away
out here in the woods,

35
00:03:48,904 --> 00:03:50,585
away from civilization.

36
00:03:51,657 --> 00:03:53,778
- Rub it on your face.
- Are you serious?

37
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,282
You make sure to get
around your eyes.

38
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:00,469
That's the demon's doorways.

39
00:04:07,768 --> 00:04:08,768
Drink.

40
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:18,428
- Jesus, what the hell is it?
- Snake juice.

41
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,936
- It's made from snakes?
- No. It snakes down in you,

42
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:25,590
coils around that evil
and rips it out.

43
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,263
All of it.

44
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:29,710
Every last drop.

45
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:47,540
If I were you,
I'd get my filthy mind off of him.

46
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,251
What was it that you vampires say?

47
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:52,821
"Jason is mine."

48
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:55,791
It's not like that.

49
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:57,382
He's a good person.

50
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,948
- Are you implying that I'm not?
- Well...

51
00:05:01,673 --> 00:05:03,369
Jason isn't planning to kill me

52
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:05,672
after I'm no longer any use to him.

53
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:08,882
Sophomore year of college, I walked away
from an academic scholarship

54
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,896
so I could go
to this Guatemalan village,

55
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:14,401
help them build their very first
irrigation system

56
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:17,747
so they could have fresh water,
crops that didn't give them dysentery.

57
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:20,489
So don't you dare
get morally superior on me.

58
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:23,643
I am an organic vegan,

59
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:25,869
and my carbon footprint
is miniscule.

60
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:28,637
'Cause I know that, ultimately,

61
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:31,041
we're all just
a single living being.

62
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,000
But you are not.

63
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,885
- What the hell?
- You got a clot forming.

64
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,601
There.

65
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:46,798
Okay, I need tape to keep it
at that angle.

66
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:03,246
I was half-dead.
He only tried to help.

67
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:07,045
He should've told me about this.
Why wouldn't he tell me about this?

68
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,870
I won't tell him if you won't.

69
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:10,872
Withholding is tantamount to lying,

70
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:13,190
and I can't have
that in our relationship.

71
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:14,865
This is so beneath us.

72
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:17,380
Jason loves you.

73
00:06:18,065 --> 00:06:20,244
He never cared about anyone before.

74
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:24,374
He even thinks
that you might be the one.

75
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:25,938
You talk about me with him?

76
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:31,950
And he said that? He said that he
thinks that I might be the one?

77
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:37,828
If I die here,
Jason will never forgive you,

78
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,075
even if he wanted to.

79
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:42,904
He's not as evolved as you are.

80
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:44,674
I know.

81
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:48,744
<i>A shape-shifter?</i>

82
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:51,512
Most of us refer to ourselves
simply as shifters.

83
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:53,187
Well, how many of you are there?

84
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:58,671
Thousands, tens of thousands, maybe.
We don't exactly have a newsletter.

85
00:06:58,831 --> 00:07:01,656
Do you come from, like,
a family of shifters or something?

86
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:05,113
It's hereditary, so yeah, I suppose.

87
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:08,116
But,

88
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:10,513
I was adopted.

89
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,209
And the family that took me in...

90
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,021
We just never talked about it.

91
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:23,229
Can you turn into anything,
like cats, birds?

92
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,544
Cats, sure.

93
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:28,032
Yeah, I can do bird,
but flying's hard.

94
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:32,131
Dog's the easiest for me.

95
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:34,500
People like dogs.

96
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:36,673
Most other animals leave you alone.

97
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:40,382
I used to scratch your belly
in the parking lot at the bar.

98
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,645
That wasn't me, that was a real dog.

99
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:48,553
Yeah, I need a live animal
in order to...

100
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,523
To shift.
You know, as a model.

101
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,558
Kind of like an imprint.

102
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,103
Can you turn into another person?

103
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:01,483
Humans are too complex.

104
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,090
Despite what you might see
at the bar.

105
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:08,156
Can you do it any time, or...?
Or what?

106
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,489
Yeah, but it wears off
if I fall asleep.

107
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:16,581
And on a full moon,
I can't stop the shift.

108
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:19,584
- Like a werewolf.
- We're not werewolves.

109
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:24,283
Hey, werewolves are dangerous,
nasty creatures.

110
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:25,883
Do not call me a werewolf.

111
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:28,677
Werewolves exist too?

112
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,228
What else is there?

113
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,665
More than you can imagine.

114
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,682
I can't...

115
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:08,717
Life is just getting too weird
too fast.

116
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:14,848
Could a werewolf have killed Gran?

117
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:19,081
I suppose it's possible.

118
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:23,725
Oh, my God. Bill's been
dragged off by vampires,

119
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,526
and now I find out you're something
I never even knew existed.

120
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:36,271
Don't!

121
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:42,877
I thought you of all people
would understand.

122
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:44,378
Because I'm dating a vampire?

123
00:09:44,538 --> 00:09:46,296
You live with a secret.

124
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,797
I don't hide who I am.

125
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:52,233
I wanted to tell you for years!

126
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:54,516
I kissed you!

127
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:57,705
And I know
you wanted to do more than that.

128
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:00,309
Were you gonna tell me
before or after?

129
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,078
Spit,

130
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:12,685
smoke,

131
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:14,283
root.

132
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:16,549
Cleanse the body.

133
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,924
Cleanse the soul.

134
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:22,351
Snake,

135
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:23,673
seek,

136
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:24,807
search,

137
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,414
find.

138
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:28,489
Bring it to the light.

139
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:31,240
The light.

140
00:10:33,588 --> 00:10:34,509
Fuck!

141
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:37,272
- My stomach.
- It's angry.

142
00:10:38,324 --> 00:10:40,510
It's digging its claws
so it can hold on.

143
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:42,132
Don't you fight back.

144
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,688
Let your body be the battleground.

145
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,391
You let that demon destroy itself.

146
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:51,569
I feel sick.
Let it go, let it go.

147
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:53,197
Let it go, let it go.

148
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:54,271
Let it go.

149
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:55,951
Let go of all that sickness,

150
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:57,685
all that rage,

151
00:10:57,922 --> 00:11:00,159
all that anger, all that hate,

152
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,629
all that self-pity.

153
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:04,850
It's just fuel for the demon
inside of you.

154
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:06,607
Fuck.

155
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:16,667
Come forth, demon.
Leave this child in peace.

156
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:18,847
Come into the light.

157
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:20,900
Show yourself.

158
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:27,119
That ain't real.

159
00:11:27,806 --> 00:11:29,020
What's there?

160
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:31,316
Tell me what you see.

161
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:35,090
It's me standing right over there.

162
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:37,742
It's me.

163
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:40,827
The demon will take on any form
to stay alive.

164
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,789
It knows your weaknesses.
It preys on your fears.

165
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:49,795
Only you can destroy it.

166
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:04,421
Don't let it fool you, Tara Mae.

167
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:06,379
You stand up to that demon.

168
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:15,798
No, Mama, please,

169
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,115
- don't hurt me.
- One of you must die.

170
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:36,534
Good girl.

171
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:38,901
Good girl, good girl.

172
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:42,516
It's all over now.

173
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,186
That demon is gone forever.

174
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,157
You spend more time your hair
than any man I've ever met.

175
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:57,175
The trick is to make it look
like you didn't do nothing.

176
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,044
It's harder than it might seem.

177
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:01,799
I don't think you need any help
looking good, you know it.

178
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:05,397
I think I might have had
one too many beers last night.

179
00:13:05,522 --> 00:13:08,218
I feel like I been shot at
and missed, shit at and hit.

180
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:13,521
We need to talk about Eddie.

181
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:17,216
Well, I've been thinking.

182
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,136
The way we've been treating him,
it's just really uncivilized, you know?

183
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:22,809
Yeah. I do know.

184
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:25,811
We can't let him go, of course,

185
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:29,546
but we can try to make things
a little bit more comfortable for him.

186
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,739
Do you know what
Stockholm syndrome is?

187
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:35,234
It's a disease.

188
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,821
Not exactly. It's something that happens
to people who are kidnapped.

189
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,300
It's like, over time,

190
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:44,037
they start to get closer
to their kidnappers.

191
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:46,661
It's kind of like being
part of a family.

192
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:48,702
Really?

193
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:51,587
All we need to do
is make Eddie love us.

194
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:53,320
And he already loves you.

195
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:56,641
And then eventually, we wouldn't
have to keep him locked up.

196
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:59,137
He could just be in the house
with us, like he's...

197
00:13:59,262 --> 00:14:00,280
Like a pet.

198
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,351
And we could travel with him.

199
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:05,066
We could sell his blood,
when we need money.

200
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:07,824
And just live out of backpacks
and see the whole world.

201
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:09,434
We just need boots and a map.

202
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,021
I ain't never seen snow.

203
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:13,058
Tibet.

204
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:16,608
We can climb the Himalayas.
We can visit the Dalai Lama.

205
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:18,569
And snowboard naked.

206
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:21,905
Right, I gotta go to the store.
I wanna get Eddie some Tru Bloods.

207
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:23,349
Really?

208
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:25,786
I love you.

209
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,738
- I love you too.
- I love you more.

210
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,890
Oh, my God.

211
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:42,926
You are even better looking
than you were yesterday.

212
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:52,061
Mama, wake up.

213
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:56,903
Baby, where you been?
I've been so worried.

214
00:14:57,028 --> 00:14:58,567
I had the exorcism.

215
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:03,196
Tara, are you...?

216
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:05,668
It worked, Mama.

217
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,451
It worked.

218
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:09,278
Jesus answered my prayers.

219
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:12,199
We're saved.

220
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,431
Both of us, saved.

221
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,690
You did a brave thing, Tara Mae.

222
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:22,299
I am so proud of you, my baby.

223
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:24,674
My whole life, I thought
you didn't...

224
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:26,940
I thought...

225
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:30,814
I forgive you.

226
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:34,073
Get dressed.

227
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:36,067
I'm taking you out to celebrate.

228
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:37,720
Anywhere you wanna go.

229
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:42,127
How about Mamaw's Mudbugs
over in Keachi?

230
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:44,285
- That too far to drive to?
- Are you kidding?

231
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:45,988
I'd drive anywhere for you.

232
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:58,883
Sookie, could you reach me up
another box of paper lanterns?

233
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:01,793
I'm kind of busy right now
setting up your bar.

234
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,319
Thank you, Terry.
You are so sweet and reliable.

235
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:09,694
I always know what to expect
from you. No nasty surprises.

236
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:12,545
That's just because
you don't know me very well.

237
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:20,482
These lanterns are just precious.

238
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:24,902
But they ought to alternate colors.
Like boy-girl seating.

239
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,863
But they're already in place.

240
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,995
- It won't take a minute to change.
- All right.

241
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,273
Don't you think they should
hang in little scallops,

242
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:34,085
like a gingerbread house?

243
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,477
It'll be more romantic that way,
not like some hick barn dance.

244
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:42,170
- What do you want it to look like?
- A debutante ball.

245
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,465
Hug your neck. You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

246
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,376
I'll be right back. Thank you, Sam.

247
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,050
How did you know what she wanted?

248
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:54,432
My cousin Portia was a deb
in Shreveport when she turned 18.

249
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,479
Every Bellefleur woman's
been doing it

250
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:59,118
since they started having them
before the Revolutionary War.

251
00:17:00,223 --> 00:17:02,553
It must be nice
to come from such an old family.

252
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:06,500
All families are old, Sam.
Some just keep better records.

253
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,731
<i>Sam, hush that dog up.</i>

254
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,496
<i>What are you doing
to get him so riled up?</i>

255
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:21,017
Mitch, there's
something wrong with Sam.

256
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:29,485
Lord in heaven.

257
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:40,640
Don't put the red ones next to
the green ones. This ain't Christmas.

258
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:43,909
Get that dog out of here.

259
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:46,458
<i>Don't shut me out, please.</i>

260
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:51,489
Georgia,

261
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:54,431
your replacement just showed up.

262
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:58,558
"Thought you said you were
gonna get rid of her quick."

263
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:01,333
"Bitch, I love you,
you scandalous whore."

264
00:18:02,177 --> 00:18:04,802
Take your man. Take his ass.

265
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:06,964
<i>I'm company.</i>

266
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,294
<i>Shut up. Shut up
and get back upstairs.</i>

267
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:13,239
You better walk down them stairs
like:

268
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:19,718
<i>Oh, I forgot to tell you, Georgia.
I saw the picture...</i>

269
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,702
Well, this an unexpected pleasure.

270
00:18:30,647 --> 00:18:31,943
I can't stay long.

271
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:36,926
Boyfriend, I can make you stay longer
than you ever thought you could.

272
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,573
Actually, I had something else
in mind.

273
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:42,665
- What?
- A little, uh, V-juice?

274
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:44,118
Sold out.

275
00:18:48,956 --> 00:18:49,932
What?

276
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:53,968
Ain't nothing I can do.
My supplier only comes out after dark,

277
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:55,969
if you know what I mean.

278
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,094
Damn it.

279
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,308
I have a speech tonight.

280
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,322
You got stage fright?

281
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:08,871
I could help you with that.

282
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,314
You know I can.

283
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,329
I can't mess up my clothes.

284
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:24,927
I love how Mamaw's Mudbugs
is exactly the same

285
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:28,211
as when we used to go there
when I was little. Remember?

286
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,099
Until I lost my license.

287
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:37,132
First thing in the morning,
I'm going down to DMV.

288
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,022
- What's wrong?
- Maybe one bucket was enough.

289
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:45,416
I told you not to suck the heads.

290
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,569
Good Lord in heaven.

291
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:48,524
Hold on.

292
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:51,559
I'll find us a drugstore,
get you some Pepto.

293
00:19:59,614 --> 00:20:02,286
Excuse me. What aisle's
the Pepto-Bismol on?

294
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:04,205
Aisle 7. Right over there.

295
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,916
I know you.

296
00:20:08,794 --> 00:20:11,254
No, I'm sure you've mistaken me
for someone else.

297
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:13,281
Miss Jeanette.

298
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:16,275
No. I'm needed up front, ma'am.

299
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,774
No. No, I know your face.
Don't run away from me.

300
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:22,874
Don't touch me.

301
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:25,433
Don't touch you? I ought to kill you,
you fake, lying bitch.

302
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:27,552
- I will call the police.
- Go ahead.

303
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:31,426
Tell 'em how you charged me $800
to spit in my face and poison me.

304
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:34,211
- You know what? I'll call them myself.
- Wait, wait.

305
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,898
What was in that shit you
gave me, that snake juice?

306
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:40,286
Ipecac syrup and a small amount
of peyote.

307
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:42,858
- It's perfectly safe.
- I puked my guts out.

308
00:20:43,071 --> 00:20:45,230
I hallucinated stabbing
a little girl.

309
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:47,783
- What the fuck kind of person are you?
- Look.

310
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:50,919
I got a son in prison,
another one in Iraq.

311
00:20:51,204 --> 00:20:54,653
I got a daughter with diabetes,
and 3 grandbabies I gotta take care of.

312
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:57,550
I do what I have to for my family.

313
00:20:58,158 --> 00:20:59,167
Same as you.

314
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,162
I actually believed you had
fixed me.

315
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:04,575
Oh, my God,
I am such a fucking dumb-ass.

316
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Listen.

317
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:10,166
Just because Miss Jeanette ain't real
doesn't mean she can't help people.

318
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,031
You saw how it worked for your mama.

319
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:15,497
She still sober?

320
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:18,404
Once she finds out about you,
she'll be drinking again.

321
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:20,448
Maybe she don't have to find out.

322
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:23,576
Faith's a powerful thing.

323
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:28,711
Fuck,

324
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:29,958
fuck, fuck.

325
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,155
- You get something for me?
- They're out.

326
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:48,829
I'd ask you to dance,
but I don't dance.

327
00:22:49,392 --> 00:22:50,769
Thanks anyhow, Terry.

328
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:54,075
Sometimes,
crowds makes me feel guilty

329
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,261
for not having fun
like everyone else.

330
00:22:57,055 --> 00:22:59,338
And then I feel guilty
for feeling guilty.

331
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,205
Guilt is a useless emotion.

332
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,734
Or so I've heard.

333
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:09,932
I just wish Bill was here.

334
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,646
There's some dead people
I wish was still around too.

335
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:49,085
Idiot. You fed on a human
that belonged to another.

336
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:52,619
Three months of starving
till your fangs grow back

337
00:23:52,744 --> 00:23:54,694
will teach you better manners.

338
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:57,362
Brothers and sisters
of the tribunal,

339
00:23:57,487 --> 00:23:59,337
is this fair? Is this just?

340
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:05,396
Now, Luisa, the other one, please.

341
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:07,449
From the root.

342
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:24,297
Sentence

343
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:25,750
passed

344
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:28,466
and executed.

345
00:24:29,758 --> 00:24:32,224
The trial is concluded.
Best of luck.

346
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:33,618
Moving on.

347
00:24:34,988 --> 00:24:36,361
This looks interesting.

348
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:41,370
Eric Northman, sheriff of Area 5.

349
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:43,777
- Magister.
- Well, then.

350
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:47,988
Bring me your murderer.

351
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:17,184
It's nice not to have to sneak
it to you no more, ain't it?

352
00:25:22,036 --> 00:25:25,769
- Yeah, it is surprising.
- See? I told you Amy wasn't a psycho.

353
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,413
The more time you spend with us,
you'll see she's an amazing woman.

354
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:33,159
What made her change her mind?

355
00:25:34,787 --> 00:25:36,263
She wants you to live with us,

356
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,184
like part of the family.

357
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:39,331
I do too.

358
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:41,911
She

359
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:45,572
tell you about finding
the Tru Bloods you brought me?

360
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:49,874
You're lying.

361
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:53,686
What did she say?

362
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:57,365
She said that withholding
was tantamount to lying

363
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,685
and that your relationship
was better than that.

364
00:26:00,114 --> 00:26:00,987
Fuck.

365
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:04,782
God, that even sounds like her.

366
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,151
She's playing you, Jason.

367
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:08,789
No, she is not.

368
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:11,447
Ain't nobody plays Jason Stackhouse.

369
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:14,503
If you don't let me go,
she's going to kill me.

370
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:16,337
She would never do that.

371
00:26:16,462 --> 00:26:18,294
- She's a...
- Psychopath?

372
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:19,960
Jason, we're late.

373
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm coming.

374
00:26:22,605 --> 00:26:25,044
Bye-bye, Eddie.
We'll see you in a few hours.

375
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:28,047
I was thinking, we could
bring one of the TVs down here.

376
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:29,662
Does that sound good?

377
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,706
Come on.

378
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,814
You're wrong about her.

379
00:26:44,658 --> 00:26:47,273
Eddie, where you at? I'm at your
crib. The door was wide open.

380
00:26:47,514 --> 00:26:49,589
This is fucked up as fuck.

381
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:51,694
Call me when you get
this message, bitch.

382
00:26:58,227 --> 00:27:01,790
Jason fucking Stackhouse,
you bigmouth motherfucker.

383
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,785
Honey, let me set a spell.
I'm sweating all over this dress.

384
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,478
What, you won't dance with me?

385
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:19,128
What aine thing
at your own fais do-do.

386
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:23,327
Go ask Sookie to dance.
The poor thing's got nobody here.

387
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:25,023
Everyone's afraid of her.

388
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:27,245
Go on.

389
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:34,625
Y'all having a good time?

390
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,213
You look lonely as a cloud.
Ain't right.

391
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:39,946
Why, thank you, Rene.

392
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:42,455
Arlene is a lucky lady.

393
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:46,909
Not everybody likes
a coon-ass like me.

394
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:48,192
I do.

395
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:49,628
So does Bill.

396
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,967
I don't have nothing
against vampires, you know that.

397
00:27:55,318 --> 00:27:56,676
But you're a good girl.

398
00:27:57,495 --> 00:27:59,347
I think you deserve better.

399
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:01,528
Mind if I cut in?

400
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,020
Okay, truce?

401
00:28:13,546 --> 00:28:16,082
It's not fair you being mad
about something I can't help.

402
00:28:16,207 --> 00:28:18,770
I'm mad that you didn't
trust me enough to tell me.

403
00:28:19,152 --> 00:28:21,075
You hid the most important
thing about yourself.

404
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:22,111
So what?

405
00:28:22,586 --> 00:28:25,165
- You're with Bill now.
- Yeah, and you're with Tara.

406
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:26,894
Another thing you didn't tell me.

407
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:29,437
'Cause there's nothing to tell.
Oh, does she know that?

408
00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:32,112
Or the fact that you can
turn into a dog?

409
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,120
It's none of her business.

410
00:28:35,426 --> 00:28:37,048
And you know what, I didn't tell you

411
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,136
because I knew
this is how you'd react.

412
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:41,431
But you're right.
I didn't trust you.

413
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:44,006
I trusted my instincts,
and they were dead-on.

414
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,755
I think I'll get another beer.

415
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,899
- Do you guys... you want one?
- Oh, no.

416
00:28:52,184 --> 00:28:54,140
- You want one, babe?
- Oh, no. I'm fine.

417
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:02,395
You know, I think she's
my favorite girl you ever dated.

418
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:06,017
- Where'd you meet her at?
- It's kind of embarrassing.

419
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:08,063
Fangtasia.

420
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:10,433
- What? The fuck you doing there?
- Vampire bar?

421
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:12,125
The only reason I went there

422
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,546
was 'cause there was
this band playing that I like.

423
00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:18,102
You one brave motherfucker
going there to see them play.

424
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:21,167
It's just a bunch of losers
wearing black.

425
00:29:21,332 --> 00:29:23,304
Amy and I could tell
just by looking at each other

426
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,764
we didn't really belong there.
Then one thing sort of led to another.

427
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:30,788
Never did see the band.

428
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,412
Oh, God, I wanna be you.

429
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:36,391
So is this it? She the one gonna take
Jason Stackhouse

430
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:38,006
off the market for good?

431
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:39,865
I don't know.

432
00:29:41,756 --> 00:29:43,505
Now, what you waiting for?

433
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,780
Life is short.

434
00:29:45,003 --> 00:29:47,253
You find a good one, you keep her.

435
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:50,023
You're right.

436
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:53,681
I never felt this way
about any girl before.

437
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:56,462
I think that's maybe why...

438
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,389
I think I lost the upper hand
in the relationship, you know?

439
00:30:05,245 --> 00:30:06,342
That sucks.

440
00:30:06,927 --> 00:30:08,038
What sucks?

441
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:10,026
- You take it back.
- Take it back?

442
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:11,366
Take it back.

443
00:30:11,702 --> 00:30:13,997
You just say,
"Woman, this is what I want.

444
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:15,923
This is the way it's gonna be."

445
00:30:16,243 --> 00:30:18,484
And if she even don't like it,
she'll respect you.

446
00:30:18,646 --> 00:30:20,811
She can't help it.
It's in her DNA. Fact.

447
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:24,117
Well, well, now I wanna be you.

448
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:25,626
Fuck you.

449
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:28,872
And if she don't respect you? She
ain't someone that you wanna be with.

450
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:36,981
- He's right.
- I've been keeping an eye on you, Hoyt.

451
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:41,006
That is your third beer,
and that is two too many.

452
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,176
You set that down. Right now.

453
00:30:46,902 --> 00:30:50,167
You know, I plan on having
about six more beers.

454
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:51,686
And

455
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:55,690
enough tequila to drown
a Mexican sea captain, woman.

456
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,952
Excuse me.

457
00:31:03,646 --> 00:31:07,015
Longshadow was choking the girl
and would have killed her.

458
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:08,951
So you murdered a higher life form

459
00:31:09,113 --> 00:31:10,744
for the sake of your pet.

460
00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:14,335
You broke an ancient
and fundamental law.

461
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:18,532
You decreased our numbers
at a critical time in our history.

462
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,291
Very bad.

463
00:31:20,722 --> 00:31:22,607
Very, very bad.

464
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,288
Magister,

465
00:31:25,023 --> 00:31:27,103
Longshadow broke the law first.

466
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:31,083
She was mine and he knew it. He
would have killed her and fed from her.

467
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,945
Hello, human.

468
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:35,938
Irrelevant.
Happens every day.

469
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:38,359
He was stealing from Eric.

470
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,362
Sheriff?

471
00:31:43,476 --> 00:31:44,903
Yes, Magister, it's true.

472
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,949
Longshadow was a thief and a liar.

473
00:31:47,678 --> 00:31:49,174
He was hurting my business.

474
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,204
The business part,

475
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:55,652
that is a serious offense.

476
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:59,044
And it was the human
who exposed Longshadow.

477
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:01,098
Would you tell him, Eric?

478
00:32:03,344 --> 00:32:05,470
The only reason the girl was there

479
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,794
was because I called her.

480
00:32:07,988 --> 00:32:09,638
To protect your wealth.

481
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:12,016
To protect my wealth, yes.

482
00:32:12,846 --> 00:32:14,202
Magister, she is...

483
00:32:15,974 --> 00:32:16,799
valuable.

484
00:32:17,431 --> 00:32:20,797
Humans exist to serve us.
That is their only value.

485
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:24,144
There are those among us
who think differently.

486
00:32:26,408 --> 00:32:28,866
Do you question my authority?

487
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:31,337
I am the magister.

488
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:33,895
I was trained in the Inquisition,

489
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,581
and I am the adjudicator

490
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:38,719
for every vampire territory
in North America.

491
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:40,660
As the humans say,

492
00:32:40,785 --> 00:32:43,631
the humans you love
more than your own kind,

493
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,592
back your shit down.

494
00:32:56,919 --> 00:32:58,424
Well, you haven't bored me.

495
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:02,167
That works in your favor.

496
00:33:04,397 --> 00:33:07,043
And you seem to be
obedient to your sheriff.

497
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,928
For the most part.

498
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:14,747
When it matters,

499
00:33:16,073 --> 00:33:16,957
yes, he is.

500
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:19,319
The usual sentence

501
00:33:19,444 --> 00:33:22,587
is five years
in a coffin chained with silver.

502
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:26,422
During which time your body
will waste

503
00:33:27,265 --> 00:33:28,961
to leather and sticks.

504
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:32,429
You'll probably go insane.

505
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:36,309
However,

506
00:33:38,858 --> 00:33:40,308
I'm feeling a bit...

507
00:33:43,145 --> 00:33:43,974
creative.

508
00:33:53,995 --> 00:33:55,826
You know what I love most
about Rene?

509
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,665
Aside from his fine little
Cajun butt.

510
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,211
He's good to the kids.

511
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:07,400
You know, he's good to me.

512
00:34:08,306 --> 00:34:10,717
All the rest were fixer-uppers.

513
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:12,719
But Rene, he's...

514
00:34:13,062 --> 00:34:15,679
He's solid
all the way to the foundation.

515
00:34:16,493 --> 00:34:18,058
I can count on him.

516
00:34:20,055 --> 00:34:21,366
And I've never had that

517
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:22,683
in all my life.

518
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:25,827
Well, I know what you mean.

519
00:34:26,473 --> 00:34:29,611
I never knew I could have something
like what I have with Jason.

520
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:32,781
I'm not about to let
anything destroy that.

521
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:36,142
I don't know anyone
can trust anybody these days.

522
00:34:36,346 --> 00:34:38,001
They're always keeping things
from you.

523
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:40,789
And you don't even know
who people are or what they are.

524
00:34:46,932 --> 00:34:49,067
You know what I love about Jason?

525
00:34:49,374 --> 00:34:51,188
Everything is right on the surface.

526
00:34:51,313 --> 00:34:53,258
You never have to wonder
what he's thinking.

527
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,347
Yeah, 'cause he ain't thinking.

528
00:34:56,424 --> 00:34:58,488
Hey, girlfriends, what's up?

529
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,642
Tara, you look... You look great.

530
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:04,397
Prom night, 2000.
I ain't wore it since.

531
00:35:04,681 --> 00:35:06,357
Well, it still fits you.

532
00:35:08,157 --> 00:35:09,407
Tara, come here.

533
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:13,445
I've never seen you like this.
Is this because of Sam?

534
00:35:14,525 --> 00:35:15,866
I saw you. In his office.

535
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:18,671
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It's none of your business.

536
00:35:18,796 --> 00:35:21,246
I'm just not sure that dating Sam
is such a good idea.

537
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:23,331
At least he doesn't drink my blood.

538
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:45,629
- You want a beer?
- I don't drink.

539
00:35:48,404 --> 00:35:50,195
Had me a very interesting
conversation

540
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,833
with a man at the naked
community over in Beaumont.

541
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:55,028
That's right, I already told you.
Last night.

542
00:35:55,424 --> 00:35:57,704
Before you ran off
to avoid talking to me.

543
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:00,988
What's your story, Merlotte?

544
00:36:01,571 --> 00:36:02,921
Who's your people?

545
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:05,792
I was adopted.

546
00:36:06,376 --> 00:36:07,726
That's the truth.

547
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,271
At 15, I was on my own.

548
00:36:11,443 --> 00:36:12,443
Fifteen?

549
00:36:13,565 --> 00:36:14,560
Where'd you go?

550
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:15,816
Who took you in?

551
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:20,415
I need to know what your life was
before you bought up property here

552
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,178
and women started getting killed.

553
00:36:44,627 --> 00:36:45,427
Mom?

554
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:13,268
Where the hell did you come from?

555
00:37:13,393 --> 00:37:17,627
I come from exactly the same place
everybody else comes from, Andy.

556
00:37:18,684 --> 00:37:20,395
I been checking up on you.

557
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,951
You got no records before you
moved here. Nothing.

558
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,663
No taxes, no social security,

559
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:27,600
no credit card bills,

560
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:29,588
no previous address.

561
00:37:30,473 --> 00:37:32,000
- Jesus fuck, Andy.
- Shit.

562
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:35,193
Don't you ever get tired
of being in everybody's way?

563
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:38,964
I'm gonna have to pay
for dry-cleaning.

564
00:37:43,618 --> 00:37:44,627
Look at you.

565
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,809
Listen.

566
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:49,352
I have a situation.

567
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:51,168
A very serious situation.

568
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:54,440
And I need your help with it
right now.

569
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:57,082
I'm here
on official police business,

570
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:59,570
and we're in the middle
of a conversation.

571
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,745
Well, let me wrap it up for you.

572
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,586
He don't know anything.
He didn't do anything.

573
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:06,836
And he doesn't give a shit.

574
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:09,576
Come on, Sam.

575
00:38:18,435 --> 00:38:19,838
How much have you had to drink?

576
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:22,645
Quit acting like my damn boss
and just fuck me, please.

577
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,992
- did you have that exorcism?
- Can't you just be a normal guy

578
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,524
- and go with it?
- Because I'm not a normal guy.

579
00:38:29,649 --> 00:38:31,867
- Who the fuck cares?
- Damn it, Tara.

580
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:36,675
I'm a person. I'm not
a fucking prop for you to use

581
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,321
every time you need to feel better.

582
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:41,863
- Sam, please. I'm not right.
- You're not the only one with demons.

583
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,215
What the fuck do you want from me?

584
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:51,203
I don't want a goddamn thing
from you.

585
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:53,500
I don't want nothing from nobody!

586
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:19,943
Motherfucker, I told you to
keep your goddamn mouth shut.

587
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:21,694
This is my good shirt.

588
00:39:22,118 --> 00:39:25,448
- And yeah, I kept my mouth shut.
- My supplier, he gone.

589
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:27,429
He fucking missing.

590
00:39:27,554 --> 00:39:29,676
If other vampires
find out I've been selling,

591
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:32,915
the same shit is... You understand it?
The same shit is gonna happen to me.

592
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:36,459
You got nothing to worry about.

593
00:39:36,785 --> 00:39:37,610
Bitch,

594
00:39:38,136 --> 00:39:40,182
you think life
is just this one fucking game

595
00:39:40,307 --> 00:39:43,189
that you always win
no matter how many dead folk

596
00:39:43,496 --> 00:39:45,133
are piling up around you.

597
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:48,359
Maudette. Dawn. Your grandma.

598
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:52,968
I ain't gonna be next, bitch.

599
00:39:53,496 --> 00:39:56,836
On my mama grave, motherfucker.
I ain't gonna be next.

600
00:39:58,061 --> 00:39:59,071
Fucking...

601
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,859
You have no nest.

602
00:40:13,351 --> 00:40:15,748
You prefer to consort with humans.

603
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:20,336
You seem to have lost
all sense of our priorities.

604
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:23,605
William Compton, you owe us...

605
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:26,332
a life.

606
00:40:54,988 --> 00:40:56,614
Oh, precious Jesus,

607
00:40:56,782 --> 00:40:58,832
God, save me, save me.

608
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:00,459
Make it all a dream.

609
00:41:05,022 --> 00:41:06,928
Put me in the coffin, magister.

610
00:41:07,468 --> 00:41:08,842
I will go willingly.

611
00:41:09,002 --> 00:41:11,201
Please, it's the first time
I ever snuck out.

612
00:41:11,326 --> 00:41:13,514
I just wanted to go
to Ashley's party.

613
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,232
I only ever get to go to
youth choir and prayer group.

614
00:41:17,804 --> 00:41:20,933
If you take me home, I won't say a word
to Mama and Daddy or anybody.

615
00:41:21,058 --> 00:41:23,184
Please, please, just please help me.

616
00:41:24,624 --> 00:41:27,069
There's no help for you, child.

617
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:36,703
Meet your Maker.

618
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:48,079
Please don't let them kill me.

619
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:49,716
Please. I don't wanna die.

620
00:41:54,506 --> 00:41:56,741
Honey, you seen Sam?
We're out of ice.

621
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,230
I'll get it.

622
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,782
I could use a break
from all this anyhow.

623
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:05,015
Well, thanks for having such
a great time at my party.

624
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:34,596
That's not funny.

625
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:02,098
Sookie, it's me.

626
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,617
- He's in here. He almost...
- What, hey?

627
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:16,275
Please, please don't leave me.
Don't leave me. Please don't leave me.

628
00:44:17,379 --> 00:44:20,119
- I won't. I won't. I promise.
- Don't leave me.

629
00:44:39,759 --> 00:44:40,929
What the fuck?

630
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,710
<i>Look, if you wanted to feed him,
we should've talked about it first.</i>

631
00:44:56,835 --> 00:44:58,738
<i>I don't need
your fucking permission.</i>

632
00:44:59,074 --> 00:45:01,899
<i>If we don't trust each other,
how is he 6ever gonna trust us?</i>

633
00:45:02,024 --> 00:45:04,634
This ain't a game, woman.
I don't want him ending up dead.

634
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:07,164
God, Jason, come on.
He's gonna kill us.

635
00:45:08,382 --> 00:45:09,416
He won't.

636
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,379
I'm gonna let him go, and don't
even try to fucking stop me.

637
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:17,507
- Please, don't.
- Get out of here! Goddamn.

638
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:20,135
- Please, hurry.
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

639
00:45:21,004 --> 00:45:22,721
Don't tell me what I can...

640
00:45:29,006 --> 00:45:29,840
Fuck.

641
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:35,358
If you wanna torture anyone,
torture me.

642
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:37,136
Torture? This?

643
00:45:37,912 --> 00:45:39,567
I don't think so.

644
00:45:40,644 --> 00:45:42,489
I could show you torture,

645
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:43,754
if you like.

646
00:45:47,652 --> 00:45:50,874
- I was... I was wrong to speak.
- You can quit stalling.

647
00:45:51,034 --> 00:45:52,751
What you see in this...

648
00:45:52,911 --> 00:45:56,864
cow, Mr. Compton,
is merely a response to stimuli.

649
00:45:57,645 --> 00:45:59,148
Humans are quite...

650
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:00,829
primitive,

651
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:04,916
incapable of feeling pain
as we do. But...

652
00:46:05,507 --> 00:46:06,731
you know that.

653
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,290
Luisa.

654
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:18,216
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want..."

655
00:46:18,554 --> 00:46:20,421
I can't remember what's next.

656
00:46:20,753 --> 00:46:22,383
According to our records,

657
00:46:22,565 --> 00:46:25,135
you've never been a Maker,
is that right?

658
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:29,371
But you know the procedure?

659
00:46:36,772 --> 00:46:37,958
Then proceed.

660
00:47:10,853 --> 00:47:12,251
Are you a Christian?

661
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,428
I was.

662
00:47:16,577 --> 00:47:17,786
I'm a good girl.

663
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,631
Jesus will take me home to heaven.

664
00:47:23,577 --> 00:47:24,868
What's your name?

665
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:26,708
Jessica.

666
00:47:28,757 --> 00:47:30,166
Look at me, Jessica.

667
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:35,873
You're safe now.

668
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,648
Look in my eyes.

669
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:47,067
Everything will be fine.

670
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,191
I hate to interrupt,

671
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:51,289
but glamour is not permitted.

672
00:47:52,712 --> 00:47:54,878
- She's just a girl.
- You are boring me.

673
00:47:55,003 --> 00:47:57,167
Shut up and do as you're told.

674
00:48:04,092 --> 00:48:06,039
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Let go.

675
00:48:06,164 --> 00:48:08,599
- Let go of me! No!
- It's all right.

676
00:48:08,724 --> 00:48:10,214
Stop it! Stop!

677
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:23,040
Forgive me.
