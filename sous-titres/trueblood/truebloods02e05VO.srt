1
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:08,602
What did you say?

2
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:10,749
You heard me.

3
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:12,848
Come on.
Keep up, slowpoke.

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:14,808
Well, hey,

5
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:17,024
I don't know what you're saying.

6
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:18,849
You're so lonesome, Sam.

7
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:21,248
I saw it in your eyes
last night at the lake.

8
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:22,249
What?

9
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:24,991
- It was dark, you did not.
- Did too.

10
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:29,111
You're carrying that secret
like a 2-ton sack of feed on your back.

11
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,364
It doesn't have to be that way.

12
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:34,215
Secret. What secret?

13
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:35,471
Fibber.

14
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:40,665
I ain't in the mood tonight,
little girl.

15
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:05,739
Hey, your own self.

16
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,483
Sync: mpm, Arrow
for the sub factory

17
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:40,982
Jesus Christ!

18
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:44,194
Jesus Christ, you...

19
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,456
You... You're...

20
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,849
Shapeshifter, and proud of it.

21
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:51,670
How'd you...?
How did you find out about me?

22
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,022
Last night in the woods?

23
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:57,225
I watched a dog jump in the water

24
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,545
and it came up you.

25
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:04,526
Isn't this great?

26
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:10,438
Yeah, it's... It's pretty great.

27
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:14,316
You're not alone anymore.

28
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,120
Crap. Hand me my drawers.

29
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:38,432
Good party.

30
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:42,501
Later, darling.

31
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:43,826
Wait... Wait.

32
00:03:49,683 --> 00:03:51,272
It's in the air, I guess.

33
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:54,524
Looks like it.

34
00:03:57,351 --> 00:03:58,651
See you at work.

35
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,770
Right.

36
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:05,516
Come on, special lady.

37
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,217
Wait!

38
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:15,304
<i>Shit, she's following me.</i>

39
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,320
<i>Oh, shit, oh, shit.
What the fuck are you?</i>

40
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:18,691
<i>Go away, don't hurt me.</i>

41
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:20,634
I am the last person
you should be afraid of.

42
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,678
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Sookie Stackhouse.

43
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,422
- Gotta go.
- We have to talk about this.

44
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:27,369
We don't.

45
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,108
Have a good evening, sir.

46
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,435
Well, excuse you.

47
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:33,232
- Don't.
- He didn't hear.

48
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,872
He's glamoured, can't you tell?

49
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:36,066
Listen.

50
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,449
His mind's full of fog
and disco music.

51
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,450
By the way, they can't glamour me.
Can they glamour you?

52
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,764
No, but I fake it.

53
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:50,791
<i>You ever hear any vampire thoughts?</i>

54
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,082
God, no.

55
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,434
Don't even say that out loud.

56
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:55,877
I didn't.

57
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:01,115
Listen, I don't know what little fried
corn-on-the-cob town you're from,

58
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,261
or what candy-ass vampires you're with,
but this is Dallas, baby.

59
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,805
You watch your tone of voice.
And don't you call me "baby."

60
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,697
Dallas vamps are serious
and scary as shit.

61
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:11,546
Mine are too, thank you very much.

62
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,524
I had to learn quick
how to handle myself.

63
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:15,731
If they knew what we could do,
they'd suck us dry.

64
00:05:15,992 --> 00:05:18,407
They'd do worse than that.
You think I don't know?

65
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:20,986
That's why we need to swap
stories. We can help each other.

66
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,039
I don't want any help.
Just forget about it.

67
00:05:23,164 --> 00:05:25,947
You can't tell anybody about me,
please.

68
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,373
Jessica, we discussed this.

69
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,524
All I did was order him
off the menu.

70
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:36,669
You didn't say
not to order off the menu.

71
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,127
I would no more allow you
to feed on that young man

72
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,382
than to watch the pornography
on television.

73
00:05:41,963 --> 00:05:42,963
Porno?

74
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,928
Hey, Sookie, there's dirty
movies on TV.

75
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:47,516
I know. Yuck.

76
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:50,849
To your room, please.
Tru Blood.

77
00:05:51,512 --> 00:05:54,659
You are going to be so sorry
when I get an eating disorder.

78
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:56,856
Private!
Keep out!

79
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:02,954
- Where have you been?
- I was asking the bellboy,

80
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,989
if there's a candy machine,
what's a continental breakfast...?

81
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:08,416
You cannot wander off on your own.

82
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:11,286
The situation here
is more complicated than we thought.

83
00:06:11,694 --> 00:06:14,373
We don't know nearly enough
about the Dallas vampires.

84
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,483
They can't touch me.

85
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:18,438
I'm yours.

86
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,340
Every...

87
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:22,653
single...

88
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:24,238
part of me.

89
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:27,365
Completely and totally...

90
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:28,704
yours.

91
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,417
I'm don't think it matters to them,
sweetheart.

92
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,809
As long as it matters to you.

93
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,273
Tell me you understand.

94
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:42,897
Promise me you'll do as I say,
not because I say it,

95
00:06:43,022 --> 00:06:44,601
but for your own sake.

96
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:46,488
Bill, I've known since the airport

97
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,156
that we're up to our necks
in a big old vampire mess again.

98
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,078
I don't want to get beat up or dead,

99
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:55,142
I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

100
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,410
Is this room secure, do you think?

101
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:01,877
- Yeah, I believe so. But...
- Then, honey...

102
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:03,452
for a little while,

103
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:05,492
let's not worry.

104
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:08,904
We have something to be happy about.

105
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,379
I don't think so.

106
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,389
Yes, we do.

107
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,552
We're in a vampire hotel.

108
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:18,831
It's light-tight.

109
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,409
For the very first time,

110
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:31,683
you don't have to leave me alone
in bed at dawn.

111
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:34,410
I forgot about that.

112
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,340
I didn't.

113
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:43,711
My only desire is to keep you safe.

114
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:48,387
Your...

115
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,152
only desire?

116
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:51,516
Well...

117
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,082
You're talking to the man.

118
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:14,773
<i>Hoyt Fortenberry?</i>

119
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:19,706
Who's this?

120
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,410
Jessica Hamby.

121
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:23,752
Maybe you don't remember me.

122
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,282
Oh, my Lord.

123
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:28,535
I remember you, all right.

124
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:30,634
I can't stop thinking about you.

125
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:32,889
Really?

126
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:34,638
I mean, really-really?

127
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,222
Really-really, and some more.

128
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,728
- Hoyt!
- Can you hang on?

129
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,144
Who the heck is calling you
at this time of night?

130
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:44,064
It's a girl, isn't it?
I know it's a girl.

131
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,901
You tell her it's not decent
or ladylike to... How dare

132
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,570
<i>you lock the door on me
in my own house?</i>

133
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,150
So where were we?

134
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:57,369
<i>Well,</i>

135
00:08:57,808 --> 00:09:00,663
you were telling me
how you couldn't stop thinking about me,

136
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:01,832
and,

137
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:04,133
<i>I can't stop thinking about you.</i>

138
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:07,683
And I'm all bored here in Dallas.

139
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,082
<i>You want to watch TV together
long-distance?</i>

140
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:13,815
Or I could tell you
about my comic book.

141
00:09:14,324 --> 00:09:15,679
<i>We could do both.</i>

142
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:17,953
I mean, I would just love that.

143
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:22,895
So it's called <i>Space Tomb.</i>

144
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,145
<i>And this time
they're on the planet Historion</i>

145
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,470
<i>Sea Leopard's just pitching a fit.</i>

146
00:09:32,563 --> 00:09:33,655
Get up! Get up!

147
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:36,408
- I said get up. Put on your sweats.
- What's happening?

148
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:38,911
Come on, let's haul
your butt outside,

149
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,454
you pansy fangbanger.

150
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,831
- Let's go!
- God!

151
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,811
My God, that's right.
Rise and shine for God!

152
00:09:44,936 --> 00:09:46,250
Come on, let's go.

153
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,845
Move, move, move!

154
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,546
Stand up straight.

155
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,924
Make a line you can be proud of.

156
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,592
Let's go. You're supposed

157
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,962
to be leadership material.

158
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:57,947
Mrs. Newlin?

159
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:01,649
I know you're wondering
what this is all about.

160
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,977
Well, God needs your obedience,

161
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:05,861
God needs your will

162
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:07,189
and your faith.

163
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,164
And in due time,
all will be revealed to you.

164
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,444
Could somebody reveal a bathroom?

165
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,904
Because I really need one.

166
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,566
Sorry,

167
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:17,074
not till you've earned it.

168
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:19,783
Jumping jacks, everyone.
Let's go.

169
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:21,272
Maximum effort.

170
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,789
You too good for this?

171
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,583
I'm telling you right now,
I want to see a change in your attitude.

172
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,293
I want to see command presence.

173
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:32,506
You don't want to do the Lord's work?
You feel like walking away? Go ahead.

174
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,875
You stay, you drop and give me 30.

175
00:10:35,954 --> 00:10:38,096
I said give me 30!

176
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,933
I'll tell you when you can laugh,

177
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,501
you pissant little sinner.

178
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:45,676
Give me 50.

179
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,847
Start pushing.

180
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:50,535
Anyone else?

181
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,848
That the best you ladies can do?

182
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:55,696
You disgust me, all of you! Pitiful!

183
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,990
I pray Jesus isn't
watching this crap today.

184
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,763
Come back.

185
00:12:04,783 --> 00:12:05,783
I'm here.

186
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:08,882
I'm right here with you.

187
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:13,170
I was just thinking
about Sookie's gran.

188
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:17,115
She was like my real mom.

189
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:19,152
Such a good person.

190
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:21,788
Truly good, through and through.

191
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:25,495
- What would she think of me?
- She'd like you.

192
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,903
She did appreciate a handsome man.

193
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:30,749
Well, I wish I could've met her.

194
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:31,918
Me too.

195
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:35,818
She made this house the one
place in the world I felt safe.

196
00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:38,802
And now I'm gonna live here.

197
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:40,987
Happy day after your birthday.

198
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:44,648
It was the only good one
I ever had, because of you.

199
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:51,352
The first of many, Tara Mae.

200
00:13:33,316 --> 00:13:35,506
This is a continental breakfast?

201
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:38,015
What's wrong with it?

202
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:40,537
I just thought it would be more...

203
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:42,279
continental.

204
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:45,549
Well, the danishes are Danish.

205
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,968
- And they're free.
- Free?

206
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,192
I didn't know.
Would it be all right if...?

207
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:52,706
- Yeah, whatever.
- Now, Barry, let's get to it.

208
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:55,295
Why won't you just leave me alone?

209
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,638
Because I've never met
another telepath,

210
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:00,450
- have you?
- No.

211
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:03,842
- And don't say that word.
- It's what you are.

212
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,744
Nobody knows
what it's like to be us.

213
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:07,500
We need to stick together.

214
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,139
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

215
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,516
Yes, it is.
My life is shit.

216
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:13,656
I can't do anything
normal people do.

217
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:15,770
If I'm not around vampires,
I can't hardly think.

218
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,039
I used to feel exactly the same.

219
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:20,582
- Like I had a disability.
- More like a curse.

220
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:22,762
But lately,
since I met my boyfriend,

221
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:25,549
it seems like telepathy
can come in handy sometimes.

222
00:14:25,674 --> 00:14:27,427
You can even make a little money.

223
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:29,659
I'm starting to see it
in a whole new way.

224
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,693
Then you're even crazier than I am.

225
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:32,791
<i>Brazilian wax.</i>

226
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,957
<i>Feels like that bitch ripped
out my female organs.</i>

227
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,667
<i>Get a vamp to pay for laser.
Somebody bite me.</i>

228
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,482
<i>Concentrate. Shut her out.</i>

229
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:42,658
<i>Concentrate so hard your hair hurts,
till everything goes quiet.</i>

230
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:44,316
- <i>Concentrate...</i>
- Quit!

231
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,951
Do you know if Hotel
Carmillais is hiring?

232
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:50,847
- There wasn't anybody at the desk.
- No, ma'am, we're fully staffed,

233
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,433
but you can fill out an application.
We'll keep it on file.

234
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:54,752
Come with me.

235
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:56,977
You can control it.

236
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:00,894
I wish it was true.

237
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,215
Barry, it is.

238
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,359
I can teach you how.

239
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:07,504
There's enough people
in my brain already.

240
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:08,783
You're on your own.

241
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:10,552
Right this way.

242
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:30,108
I dreamed you were gone.

243
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:32,112
You did?

244
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:35,357
That's funny, because...

245
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:36,934
I was.

246
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:42,732
It was only for a few minutes.

247
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,011
I had to.

248
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,291
Bill, it's the most amazing thing.

249
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,200
I met another telepath.

250
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:52,117
He's not very nice
and he's not very good at it.

251
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:56,416
But... it's wonderful knowing
there's somebody besides me.

252
00:15:56,735 --> 00:15:59,777
You made him aware of your gift
after everything I've said?

253
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:01,152
Not on purpose.

254
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:03,982
We were in each other's heads
before we knew it.

255
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,632
I thought you'd be happy for me.

256
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:10,565
The more people know what you do,

257
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,804
the harder it is for me
to protect you.

258
00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:15,177
He can't even admit
what he is to himself.

259
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:17,007
He's not gonna do
any talking about me.

260
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:19,815
- You can't be sure.
- Yes, I can.

261
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,516
I'm good at this.

262
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:25,275
If all I'm supposed to do in Dallas
is shut up and take orders,

263
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,950
I might as well be slinging
beers at Merlotte's.

264
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,157
You're the one who told me
I was more than a waitress.

265
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:33,514
You are.

266
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,649
- But...
- What?

267
00:16:37,683 --> 00:16:38,746
Never mind.

268
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:40,933
Talk to me.

269
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:44,768
Lean on me.
I've leaned on you plenty.

270
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:49,149
Well, here I am,

271
00:16:49,316 --> 00:16:51,680
responsible for you and Jessica,

272
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:54,492
and yet no decisions are mine

273
00:16:55,672 --> 00:16:57,097
and it makes me feel...

274
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:58,372
Like a human?

275
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:02,436
Like a waitress.

276
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:06,690
You're walking in my shoes
and it's giving you blisters.

277
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:15,014
Eric is strangely intense
about all this.

278
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:18,662
It's not like him.

279
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:20,702
I don't trust it.

280
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:22,499
Don't you worry about Eric.

281
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,210
We'll do the job and go home.

282
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:27,271
A deal's a deal.

283
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:30,657
Sookie, you know what he's like.

284
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:34,282
What's it to him
to break a contract with a girl?

285
00:17:35,224 --> 00:17:36,224
A woman.

286
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:40,341
He needs me.

287
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:43,102
He won't want to make me mad.

288
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:48,465
I can't lose you.

289
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:51,168
You never will.

290
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,910
Hope you're enjoying
that Co-Cola, Arlene.

291
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:07,035
Well, thank you, Daphne, I am.

292
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:11,214
Because unlike you, I actually
did my closing prep last night.

293
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,675
I'd appreciate it if you gave me a hand,
just for today.

294
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,428
Then you'll never learn.

295
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,904
Now, some people around here
might let you slide on by,

296
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:20,932
but I'm thinking
about your future as a server.

297
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,520
- That's real generous.
- Don't forget to make the iced tea.

298
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,566
Hey, good-looking.

299
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:31,743
Hey... you.

300
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,297
Could you make
the iced tea for me, please?

301
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,744
- Don't you do it.
- Please?

302
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,842
You better not.

303
00:18:48,657 --> 00:18:51,422
- The hell with you all...
- See what you did?

304
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:58,057
Mean old freckle-face
redheaded witch.

305
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:00,287
Good morning, Daphne.

306
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:02,389
Back at you, boss.

307
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:10,249
Hey, why'd you take off last night?

308
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,646
I looked everywhere for you.

309
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:15,307
I just went for a little run.

310
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:17,906
You know, I always seem
to need one after a shift.

311
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:19,740
Hey, me too.

312
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,912
I reckon you had all you could
handle for one night

313
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,539
- anyway.
- I reckon you underestimate me.

314
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:29,374
- Guess we'll find out.
- When?

315
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:32,549
Soon.

316
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,004
Better be.

317
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,913
Terry, Lafayette's back!

318
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,476
Thank God, brother.

319
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:47,808
Thank God.

320
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:49,102
Can we talk?

321
00:19:57,282 --> 00:20:00,223
Where the fuck have you been?

322
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,537
Couldn't pick up a damn phone?

323
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:07,312
Sorry.

324
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:10,892
Sorry's not good enough.
Not only did you leave us high and dry,

325
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:14,049
but there are people here
who give a shit about you.

326
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,566
We didn't know
if you were alive or dead.

327
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:25,658
Ordinarily, right about now,
you'd be telling me to fuck off

328
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:28,517
in some colorful and creative way.

329
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:32,772
Well, you want to talk,

330
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:35,286
do some talking.

331
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,182
All I want to know is,
can I have my job back?

332
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:43,619
I ought to tell you to fuck off.

333
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:46,028
All that pressure in the kitchen
just about put Terry back

334
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,653
in the VA hospital.

335
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,878
Of course you can have your job back.
The place ain't the same without you.

336
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,982
Thank you, Sam.

337
00:21:08,257 --> 00:21:09,809
What happened to you?

338
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,449
It's midnight.
You're out of ammo.

339
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,886
You got five hungry vampires
snapping at your ass.

340
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,770
What are you gonna do?

341
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:35,616
- What are you gonna do?
- Run.

342
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,336
Run fast.

343
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:41,758
Get up.

344
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,219
You gotta keep going.
You have five hungry, snapping vampires.

345
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,341
Fuck it, I hate this, I just
want to be a bank teller again.

346
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:51,099
That's fine, dude.
Let the vampires chew you up.

347
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,811
You're not good enough
to lead for the Lord.

348
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,979
That's how you do it, Stackhouse.

349
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,716
- You better pace yourself.
- This is my pace.

350
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:03,820
Asshole.

351
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:17,835
Are you still here?
Or did you come back?

352
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:21,102
Karl and I slept over.
Don't you remember?

353
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:22,548
Maybe not.

354
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,570
You were having a very nice time.

355
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:26,683
Maybe not.
What's all this?

356
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,826
Looks like we need a place to stay.

357
00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:31,605
Stay today?

358
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:33,697
Stay tonight?

359
00:22:34,502 --> 00:22:35,652
Little while.

360
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,249
But you have your own home.

361
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:39,482
That's not mine.

362
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:42,276
- What?
- It belongs to one of my clients.

363
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,937
He was out of the country,
but he's back this morning.

364
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:46,322
I'm sure I told you, no?

365
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:48,506
No. You... You didn't.

366
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,828
Look, I... I hate to tell you this,

367
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,579
but this isn't gonna work.

368
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,549
But I assumed...

369
00:22:57,815 --> 00:23:00,565
And we've all been so happy
living together,

370
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,739
that you'd want to have us close.

371
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:04,893
Maryann, I'm a guest here myself.

372
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:07,844
I can't be having a houseful of people
Sookie doesn't even know.

373
00:23:08,223 --> 00:23:09,649
She wouldn't mind.

374
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:11,848
You explain how much we mean to you.

375
00:23:12,153 --> 00:23:14,124
Don't get me wrong,
I couldn't be more grateful

376
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:15,977
for everything you've done.

377
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,448
But I don't feel right about this.

378
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,483
You can't move in.

379
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,521
I'm sorry.

380
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:30,008
I see. Okay.

381
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:42,295
Did you know Maryann wants us
all to be roommates here?

382
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,647
No, cool. I guess that other guy
came back from Peru.

383
00:23:44,772 --> 00:23:45,840
No, not cool.

384
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,884
Not gonna happen.
I just moved in.

385
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:51,416
Okay, fine, we can go
somewhere else, if that's how you feel.

386
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:54,582
That's all you got to say?

387
00:23:55,248 --> 00:23:58,990
- Relax. It's no big deal.
- Are you, nomads? Fucking Bedouins?

388
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,257
We move around a little bit.
Nothing wrong.

389
00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:03,691
Nothing except I didn't know.
You could've told me.

390
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:06,493
Who cares? What matters
is being with the people you love.

391
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:07,904
Other things matter too.

392
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,285
Like knowing the truth
about people you love.

393
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,825
So while we're on the subject,

394
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,500
what exactly is your thing
with Maryann?

395
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,999
When I was ready to lay down and die,
she lifted me up, same as she did you.

396
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,626
Now you follow her?

397
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:24,378
I'm not her dog, if that's
what you're trying to say.

398
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:27,757
And why all of a sudden are you
so paranoid about Maryann?

399
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,804
Because I'm trying not to be a fool.

400
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,743
You know what this is really about?
Your history's so fucked up,

401
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:34,931
you have no clue what family is.

402
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:37,382
That's not fair.

403
00:24:37,805 --> 00:24:39,187
I do have a clue.

404
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,100
Sort of.

405
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:44,075
Kind of.

406
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:47,772
Who gives a damn about a house?

407
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,009
Maryann, Karl and me,
we take care of each other.

408
00:24:51,134 --> 00:24:52,115
Of you.

409
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:56,749
That's family, Tara.

410
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,920
How are we gonna work on
our defensive tactics

411
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:07,857
if we can't even climb a fence?

412
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:08,923
Let's go.

413
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,209
Next, come on.

414
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:12,181
Come on.

415
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,347
Get up there.
Let's go, come on.

416
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,100
Come on.

417
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,978
- You should have paced yourself.
- If you're lying down,

418
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:24,188
you better be dead.
Stand up.

419
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,733
Come on.

420
00:25:27,498 --> 00:25:28,693
Why do you embarrass me?

421
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,175
Why do you straight-out
embarrass me?

422
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,986
What's your name, failure?

423
00:25:34,238 --> 00:25:35,238
Luke.

424
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:37,308
It's Luke.

425
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:40,549
Luke, your entire family
has been ambushed by vampires,

426
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:43,952
and they're bleeding to death
on the other side of this fence.

427
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:47,628
Yeah, they are.

428
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,179
Your mama and daddy

429
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,173
are drowning in buckets
of their own blood

430
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:52,368
calling your name.

431
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:54,431
It's gonna be over in 30 seconds.

432
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,951
Let's go.

433
00:25:56,577 --> 00:25:57,983
Nice work, Luke.

434
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:00,016
They're gone. Massacred.

435
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:02,757
You'll never see them again
and it's your own damn fault.

436
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:04,270
- Stay right there.
- I tried.

437
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:06,708
Now what are you gonna you do?

438
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:08,649
He's a big fat loser.

439
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,433
He's brought shame on himself,
shame on you

440
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:13,029
and shame on his religion.

441
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,030
What's a real leader gonna do?

442
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:16,863
Just get rid of me.

443
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:20,349
Just leave me.

444
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:21,848
Up to you.

445
00:26:31,815 --> 00:26:33,782
Luke, look at me.

446
00:26:37,316 --> 00:26:39,680
It's only a damn fence.
Come on.

447
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:41,871
Come on.

448
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,679
I got you, brother.

449
00:26:49,994 --> 00:26:51,461
It's not too late.

450
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,987
You're gonna save your family.

451
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,616
Now that's a freaking soldier
of God.

452
00:26:59,939 --> 00:27:00,939
Good job.

453
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,371
- Good job, Jason.
- Praise His light.

454
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,071
Good work!

455
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:09,168
- Next! Let's go, let's go.
- Come on, guys.

456
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,090
You should have told me Eric
hired a fucking human, Isabel.

457
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:18,803
Now, wait just a minute.

458
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,512
- Respect her.
- Thank you.

459
00:27:20,825 --> 00:27:23,637
I couldn't tell you, Stan.
You've been off on your own for days.

460
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:26,394
Are you certain Godric was abducted
by the Fellowship of the Sun?

461
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,074
They're the only ones
with the organization and manpower.

462
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:31,565
But they're amateurs.

463
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,115
It doesn't make any sense.

464
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,695
This is Godric we're talking about,
2000 years old.

465
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:38,133
Old don't make you smart.

466
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,392
Besides, there's no proof.

467
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:43,715
If they've got him,
I'll hear it. That's my job.

468
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:45,689
There's no reason to wait.

469
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,770
We need to take these fanatics down.
Full-out attack.

470
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:51,294
Exterminate them
like the vermin they are,

471
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:52,564
leave no trace.

472
00:27:53,413 --> 00:27:55,208
Vampire-hating church annihilated.

473
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,466
Wonder who did it?
Fucking brilliant.

474
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,809
I doubt the King of Texas
would approve the destruction

475
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:01,897
of our international
political agenda.

476
00:28:02,022 --> 00:28:03,022
Fuck that.

477
00:28:03,771 --> 00:28:05,541
The great revelation
is the biggest mistake

478
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,712
- we ever made.
- Don't use Godric

479
00:28:07,837 --> 00:28:09,687
to make your own little power play.

480
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:12,064
You're completely incompetent!

481
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,235
What's happened to Godric
that he surrounds himself with clowns?

482
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:19,027
We invited you as a courtesy.

483
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:22,450
This is not your territory.
You have no voice here.

484
00:28:22,804 --> 00:28:24,004
Yeah, sheriff.

485
00:28:24,632 --> 00:28:26,433
Why don't you run on back down
to Louisiana?

486
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:28,038
We don't need you or your puppets.

487
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,498
I'm not going anywhere.

488
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:32,710
- And I'm nobody's puppet.
- What we need is a plan.

489
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,796
- I have a plan.
- It's not a plan, it's a movie.

490
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,239
It's not a movie,

491
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,360
it's a war.

492
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:43,063
Idiots.

493
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,982
- I'm in the middle of something...
- I know.

494
00:28:51,107 --> 00:28:53,080
... you can't come in here
in front of my people.

495
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:56,280
- I want to talk to you about it.
- I've got to get them to respect me...

496
00:28:56,405 --> 00:28:59,008
- We are supposed to be partners.
- We are partners.

497
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:01,310
Then why does Gabe
always know more than I do?

498
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:04,616
- I don't have time for this.
- You mean you don't have time for me.

499
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:07,990
This is very valuable information,
Gabe.

500
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:09,190
It's excellent work.

501
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:11,732
I told both of you,
I don't care for this.

502
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:13,657
You're going too darn far.

503
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:16,792
Thank you, Reverend Newlin.
I'll put things in motion.

504
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:17,739
Thanks.

505
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:19,676
You don't listen to me at all
anymore.

506
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:20,716
What?

507
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:27,123
- You wanted me?
- Yes! You were fantastic today.

508
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,143
- He was such a warrior.
- So you said. I'm impressed.

509
00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:34,619
You're rising
to the next level recruit.

510
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:36,732
I am? What's that?

511
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:39,110
Come take a little walk with me.

512
00:29:39,883 --> 00:29:41,737
- I'll go too.
- We got it, honey.

513
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:45,511
I'm going to show you something
that very few people have seen.

514
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:53,929
Man to man?
Sometimes I almost understand

515
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:55,812
why some people believe in divorce.

516
00:29:55,937 --> 00:29:57,229
But you got Sarah.

517
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,876
I got her
even when I don't want her.

518
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:02,763
You know I'm just kidding.

519
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,952
- All right, you ready?
- Yes, sir.

520
00:30:05,077 --> 00:30:08,114
Light of Day Institute
Research and Development.

521
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,433
Holy sh...

522
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:11,976
Holiness!

523
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:18,206
We're not exactly sure yet
of all the ways to take them out.

524
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:20,546
At first, we just focused
on the guns,

525
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:23,820
but then we thought,
"Hey, what's a wooden arrow?"

526
00:30:24,268 --> 00:30:25,771
It's an itty-bitty stake.

527
00:30:25,896 --> 00:30:27,270
That's right, Jason.

528
00:30:27,395 --> 00:30:29,992
An itty-bitty stake
to drive through a vampire's dead,

529
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:32,580
rotten heart at 324 feet per second.

530
00:30:32,894 --> 00:30:34,334
And that's all she wrote.

531
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:36,020
I got silver bullets,

532
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,586
silver bullets with holy water,
wooden bullets.

533
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:40,503
- We talked about those.
- Yes, sir.

534
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:41,754
A flamethrower.

535
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:43,131
Man!

536
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:44,925
Silver throwing stars.

537
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:48,172
Now, that I wouldn't
have thought of.

538
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,673
Decapitation might work,

539
00:30:54,027 --> 00:30:56,979
so we got a guillotine on order,
just in case.

540
00:30:57,254 --> 00:30:59,273
- What...?
- That's...

541
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,218
Machine like a giant razor.

542
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:03,777
Cuts the heads right off.

543
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:07,364
I bet that'd do it, all right.

544
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:10,906
There's one good thing about having
these hellbeasts among us:

545
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:13,214
we'll find better ways to kill them.

546
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:27,763
Keep it running.
We're not going in.

547
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,244
You wanna give me your order,
please?

548
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:47,996
We already gave our orders
to that other girl, twice.

549
00:31:48,121 --> 00:31:49,496
Sorry, she sucks.

550
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:52,076
What's wrong with that fool bartender?
Where's our beers?

551
00:31:54,891 --> 00:31:57,206
You don't need any beers.
Your butt's as big as a barn.

552
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,625
You look like you're pregnant.

553
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,472
Nice of you to show up
for work tonight.

554
00:32:01,597 --> 00:32:02,795
I said I was sorry.

555
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:05,589
I would have got fired.
Lucky you slept with the boss.

556
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,251
Step up your game.
We're way behind.

557
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:12,315
Arlene, don't make me fire you
for talking trash.

558
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,751
You be nice to her, Sam.
It's Tara's fault, anyway.

559
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:17,141
- What's my fault?
- Sleeping where you eat.

560
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:20,354
Jesus Christ, Terry,
what'd I ever do to you?

561
00:32:20,712 --> 00:32:22,898
You leave him alone
and give me my beers!

562
00:32:23,154 --> 00:32:24,775
You know what?
Here they are.

563
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,373
- Fuck you very much.
- Fuck you too.

564
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:29,071
I'm gonna go just get my...

565
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:32,199
- Son of a...
- Go, Daphne.

566
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,409
Bitch!
Congratulations, Arlene.

567
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:36,281
You're Merlotte's Best Waitress
for Life.

568
00:32:36,406 --> 00:32:37,871
Quite frankly, I aim higher.

569
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,832
Aim the plates for the tables,
that's all I ask.

570
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,043
I hope I'm nicer to the people
when I'm your age.

571
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,088
How freaking long
do I have to wait for my 7 and 7,

572
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,322
diet and rum,
two Scotches and a screwdriver?

573
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:51,218
- You never gave me that order.
- You just weren't paying attention.

574
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,430
- No, you weren't and yes, I was.
- Cos, what's the holdup on my tequila?

575
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:57,797
- You never asked me for a tequila.
- You know what? Tara's on drugs.

576
00:32:58,263 --> 00:32:59,325
Tara, you high?

577
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,520
I wish I was,
the way everybody's dogging me.

578
00:33:05,392 --> 00:33:06,817
Fuck all y'all!

579
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:12,328
Daphne, get up on my way.

580
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:20,579
We're done.

581
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:48,483
Get on outta here.
Bathtub's occupied.

582
00:33:50,602 --> 00:33:51,445
I know.

583
00:33:56,624 --> 00:33:58,126
Did I stay too long?

584
00:33:58,456 --> 00:33:59,661
Do you want me to leave?

585
00:34:00,794 --> 00:34:01,944
Please don't.

586
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:12,465
I'll help you.

587
00:35:00,244 --> 00:35:03,177
Mary Magdalene washed
the feet of Jesus...

588
00:35:05,058 --> 00:35:06,826
and dried them with her hair.

589
00:35:09,558 --> 00:35:10,889
Isn't that lovely?

590
00:35:15,674 --> 00:35:17,671
But wasn't she, like...

591
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:20,318
a hooker?

592
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:23,193
She was not.

593
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:28,295
Everybody thinks so,

594
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,462
but that's not in the Bible.

595
00:35:37,189 --> 00:35:38,968
She admired Jesus,

596
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:43,370
she loved him,

597
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:48,937
and she wanted to show him.

598
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,450
You don't mean it.

599
00:36:03,134 --> 00:36:04,336
No, I don't,

600
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:07,331
but I ought to.

601
00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:10,625
Do you know what I think?

602
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,175
I think that after all your trials,

603
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,489
heartache and pain,

604
00:36:24,737 --> 00:36:26,778
God wants you to have a reward.

605
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:29,937
Are you sure?

606
00:36:33,202 --> 00:36:34,650
Let me reward you.

607
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:45,828
Let me help you find
your way back to joy.

608
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:02,553
We take them all out at once.
Pre-emptive strike.

609
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,978
Of course, so the federal government
can bombs us back to the Middle Ages.

610
00:37:06,103 --> 00:37:07,295
Things were better then.

611
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,769
Then go to Romania and live in a cave,
you ranchero poser.

612
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,803
Godric has protected you,
made you rich,

613
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:17,067
and you stand here spitting
and scratching like infants.

614
00:37:17,398 --> 00:37:19,694
Don't any of you care
that there's a traitor in your midst?

615
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:21,196
- No.
- Impossible.

616
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,343
Somebody tried to kidnap me
from the airport.

617
00:37:23,468 --> 00:37:25,492
You were the only ones
that knew she was coming.

618
00:37:26,153 --> 00:37:27,153
Explain.

619
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,426
- Unless it was you...
- Or you.

620
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:31,759
If y'all argue any more,
I'll either fall asleep

621
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:34,334
or start screaming,
so this is what we're gonna do:

622
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:37,379
I will infiltrate
the Fellowship of the Sun.

623
00:37:38,296 --> 00:37:39,965
- Absolutely not.
- Let her speak.

624
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,969
Since Bill glamoured the kidnapper,
no one knows who I am.

625
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:46,756
I'll pretend to join the church,
and check out all their thoughts.

626
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:49,224
No. During the day,
none of us can help you.

627
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:52,269
It'll only take a little while.
Really, Bill. It's simple.

628
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:54,646
Waste of time,

629
00:37:57,285 --> 00:37:59,075
when we could drink them all.

630
00:38:00,036 --> 00:38:01,686
I want no part of this.

631
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,325
There's no easier way to find out
if they're involved.

632
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,053
If it leads us to Godric,
we'll do it.

633
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:10,287
The decision is made.

634
00:38:14,038 --> 00:38:15,041
A few words.

635
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,886
So tell me,

636
00:38:26,195 --> 00:38:29,096
how goes
your human-vampire relationship?

637
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:36,649
You knew it would come to this.

638
00:38:37,545 --> 00:38:38,975
She was just clawed and poisoned

639
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,735
by a creature we don't know
and we can't find,

640
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:44,295
and now, in Dallas,
you're playing with her life.

641
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,945
It's no game to me.

642
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:49,113
All this for a colleague?

643
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:51,057
For the sheriff of Area Nine?

644
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:52,672
Why?

645
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:22,219
Godric is my maker.

646
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:46,656
Thanks for helping me close.

647
00:43:49,729 --> 00:43:53,131
I broke a lotta things today,
it's the least I can do.

648
00:43:54,636 --> 00:43:56,580
I'm sure you'll make it up to me.

649
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:58,477
I'm sure I will.

650
00:44:04,003 --> 00:44:05,003
Nice,

651
00:44:06,278 --> 00:44:07,828
you run a little hot.

652
00:44:10,073 --> 00:44:11,522
Everybody else is...

653
00:44:12,044 --> 00:44:15,443
98.6 but I'm always around 100, 101.

654
00:44:16,136 --> 00:44:17,136
Me too.

655
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:19,359
It's a shifter thing.

656
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:22,074
I never knew.

657
00:44:24,376 --> 00:44:27,115
I can't believe I'm the first one
you've ever met.

658
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:29,498
I mean, we're not common,

659
00:44:30,266 --> 00:44:31,625
but we are out there.

660
00:44:33,113 --> 00:44:34,795
Ran into a few werewolves,

661
00:44:35,988 --> 00:44:37,985
but nobody like us.

662
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:45,180
What's it feel like when you change?

663
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:50,645
Like sparks

664
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,039
running all over my skin.

665
00:44:54,086 --> 00:44:56,180
Used to scare the shit out of me.

666
00:44:57,193 --> 00:44:58,193
Me too.

667
00:44:59,247 --> 00:45:01,343
But now it just feels awesome.

668
00:45:01,717 --> 00:45:02,717
There's...

669
00:45:03,176 --> 00:45:06,568
There's sort of a build.
Like, a pressure.

670
00:45:08,871 --> 00:45:10,371
Where does it start?

671
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:15,527
Here?

672
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:17,796
Maybe...?

673
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:19,968
Maybe here?

674
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:25,083
Probably here, because that...

675
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:26,514
That's where it hits me.

676
00:45:27,844 --> 00:45:29,836
That's it.
Right about there.

677
00:45:31,394 --> 00:45:33,861
And sparks start flying inside too.

678
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,654
And you feel all lit up
like a broke power cable.

679
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:43,577
Or a Christmas tree.

680
00:45:44,368 --> 00:45:45,764
And you just...

681
00:45:46,974 --> 00:45:48,131
explode.

682
00:46:17,593 --> 00:46:19,234
Are you gonna say or should I?

683
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:21,386
Say what?

684
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,426
Nice rack.

685
00:46:26,816 --> 00:46:27,866
Nice balls.

686
00:46:37,284 --> 00:46:39,698
I have to ask a question.
Human stuff.

687
00:46:40,561 --> 00:46:42,408
I'll wait for you at the elevator.

688
00:46:50,722 --> 00:46:53,556
Excuse me, is Barry the bellboy
working tonight?

689
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:56,228
No, I'm sorry, Barry quit today.

690
00:46:56,476 --> 00:46:57,480
What?

691
00:47:00,728 --> 00:47:01,728
Shoot.

692
00:47:17,106 --> 00:47:18,906
Are you waiting up for me?

693
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,331
I guess I am.

694
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:33,577
Rough night?

695
00:47:35,297 --> 00:47:36,447
Really rough.

696
00:47:40,172 --> 00:47:42,275
We looked at houses today.
We didn't find anything,

697
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,869
but don't worry,
we'll be out by morning.

698
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:48,031
I filled the fridge with your favorite
things and I made you dinner.

699
00:47:51,418 --> 00:47:52,418
Don't go.

700
00:47:54,301 --> 00:47:55,601
I'll call Sookie.

701
00:47:56,902 --> 00:47:58,254
I want you to stay.

702
00:47:59,742 --> 00:48:01,179
You're so good to me.

703
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,274
You know why I'm good to you?

704
00:48:17,246 --> 00:48:19,146
Because you need it so much.

705
00:48:20,655 --> 00:48:23,455
And because it makes you
bloom like a flower.

706
00:48:37,365 --> 00:48:38,465
Look at you.

707
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,332
The King of Sheba.

708
00:48:40,811 --> 00:48:41,811
Hey, baby.

709
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:55,651
You saw them in the lair tonight.

710
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,210
Despicable.

711
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:02,096
Vicious, petty, vile creatures.

712
00:49:03,472 --> 00:49:04,773
You're different.

713
00:49:05,423 --> 00:49:06,973
You're not like them.

714
00:49:08,126 --> 00:49:09,476
Bill, you're not.

715
00:49:10,913 --> 00:49:12,263
You have a heart,

716
00:49:13,388 --> 00:49:15,088
whether it beats or not.

717
00:49:16,418 --> 00:49:17,786
You can love.

718
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,167
There wasn't one other vampire there
that could say the same.

719
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:25,700
Let's slip away back
to Bon Temps right now.

720
00:49:27,417 --> 00:49:30,300
Let them devour each other
and leave us alone.

721
00:49:30,854 --> 00:49:32,654
You know we can't do that.

722
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,518
Stan's as nutty as a fruitcake

723
00:49:37,189 --> 00:49:39,039
and I gave my word to Eric.

724
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,732
If anything happens to you
in that church...

725
00:49:46,857 --> 00:49:48,083
Don't say it.

726
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,485
Don't even think it.

727
00:49:52,586 --> 00:49:54,036
I'll be in and out,

728
00:49:54,773 --> 00:49:55,823
easy-peasy.

729
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,825
It's been a long night.

730
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:17,294
Don't feel like you have to...

731
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:19,292
Quit talking crazy.

732
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,535
I just meant

733
00:50:24,484 --> 00:50:27,002
I would be satisfied
to simply hold you.

734
00:50:27,779 --> 00:50:29,723
I would not be satisfied.

735
00:50:31,492 --> 00:50:32,592
Not one bit.

736
00:50:36,236 --> 00:50:38,236
Then what do you want, Sookie?

737
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:41,247
Say it.

738
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,091
I want you.

739
00:50:46,621 --> 00:50:47,921
Every which way.

740
00:50:50,373 --> 00:50:51,375
I just...

741
00:50:53,234 --> 00:50:54,133
want you.
