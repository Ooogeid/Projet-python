1
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,708
It's me. Sookie, it's me.

2
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:39,272
You all right?

3
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,409
Come here.

4
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:08,049
- Get your fuckin' hands off me!
- What are you doing here?

5
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:11,456
I was making sure Sookie got home safe.
The door was open.

6
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:14,786
- What are you doing here?
- It's okay. Let him go.

7
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:24,170
What happened?

8
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:37,243
Synchro: Arrow, mpm

9
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:45,325
Episode 6 Season 1

10
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:51,007
www.sub-way.fr / www.seriessub.com

11
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,143
- You get any prints off that drawer?
- Nothing plain.

12
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,688
Think we got a partial
on the sink, though.

13
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,592
Why don't you go upstairs
and lie down.

14
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,596
They're gonna be in there a while.
As soon as we find anything,

15
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:14,149
I'll let you know.

16
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:18,764
<i>- Oh, shit. I got blood on my boots.
- So more blood, don't be sick.</i>

17
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:20,833
<i>Pull it together,
you pull it the fuck together.</i>

18
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:23,014
<i>Do your job.
No wonder they don't respect you.</i>

19
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:25,411
<i>Cut her up real good.
Must be 30 stabs.</i>

20
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:28,659
<i>Throat's wide open. Holy hell,
we've got ourselves a serial killer.</i>

21
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,770
<i>Lynn and the grandkids to
the lake for the weekend.</i>

22
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,091
<i>Poor woman stuck raising
these bat-shit crazy</i>

23
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:35,463
<i>Stackhouse kids
didn't deserve this....</i>

24
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,104
Maybe I could

25
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:45,053
use a little air.

26
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:25,111
So I should never have left you alone,
and I lost my temper. I shouldn't have.

27
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:28,342
Do you think you could
apologize to me some other time?

28
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,649
I just...

29
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,613
Whatever you need, anything I can do,
you know I'm right here.

30
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:37,997
I know.

31
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,457
- Thank you.
- <i>Hold you, make it better</i>

32
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:45,410
<i>I'm the one. So sorry.
Sorrowful. Soft skin.</i>

33
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:49,626
I said another time, Sam.

34
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,217
What happened to Bill?

35
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,382
I'll go get him.

36
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:10,217
Thank you.

37
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,101
She's asking for you.

38
00:05:25,606 --> 00:05:27,731
There something you wanna say to me?

39
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:34,977
- I want you to stay away from her.
- {\You know,}Sookie doesn't take kindly

40
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:37,126
to people making decisions for her.

41
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:40,844
You don't need to tell me
who Sookie is.

42
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,270
I know who she is.

43
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:47,467
I've known a long time.

44
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,918
Then you also know that
this is neither the time

45
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:52,938
nor the place for you to...

46
00:05:53,058 --> 00:05:56,223
- mark your territory.
- There's a woman lying dead downstairs.

47
00:05:56,343 --> 00:05:58,532
She wouldn't be there
if it weren't for you.

48
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,166
Anything happens to Sookie,

49
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:04,505
I promise...

50
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:07,578
I'll be sharpening a stake
with your name on it.

51
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:25,965
Looks like she put up
a hell of a fight.

52
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:30,897
See those defensive cuts
on her hands?

53
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,435
Straight to the bone?

54
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:34,272
Hardcore.

55
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:36,071
Psycho son of a bitch.

56
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:40,113
Going after her all the way that way.
It's the sickest thing I ever seen.

57
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:42,989
I've seen worse.

58
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:46,318
There was a murder
about six years ago.

59
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:48,910
Lady snapped.
Blew her husband's head off

60
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,857
while he was watching the game.

61
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,332
Big chunks of brain all over the TV.

62
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:55,441
Why'd she do it?

63
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:57,979
I guess she wanted to
watch something else.

64
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,256
How the hell would I know?

65
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,279
People don't murder
'cause they're right in the head.

66
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,429
I told you we never should
have released Jason.

67
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:08,931
Now, come on.
This is his grandma we're talking about.

68
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:11,713
You think
that little pervert ain't capable?

69
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,197
Adele did bring the fang
into a church.

70
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,756
Sure that ruffled more
than a few feathers.

71
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:18,316
If he didn't do it himself.

72
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:20,860
- But vampire Bill said...
- Vampire Bill?

73
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:23,905
You on a first-name basis
with that bloodsucker now?

74
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,047
These things are crafty.

75
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:27,950
They've killing long enough

76
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,443
- to know how to cover...
- Am I interrupting?

77
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:32,223
Mr. Compton, this...

78
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:34,406
Official crime scene.
You can't be in here.

79
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:35,757
It's all right.

80
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:39,504
I suspect vampire Bill's
been around a dead body

81
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:40,795
or two before.

82
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:42,884
Isn't that right, sir?

83
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:49,745
Friend of yours, wasn't she?

84
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,754
I suppose she was.

85
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,229
We got couple more questions for you.
You mind?

86
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:58,201
Not at all.

87
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,044
Sookie tells us you were here
when she found the body. Is that right?

88
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:05,993
I arrived a few moments after.

89
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:09,075
Kind of late
to be making house calls.

90
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:13,128
All right.
I guess you don't sleep.

91
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:15,535
They sleep.
Just not at night.

92
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,378
So you make a habit of visiting Miss
Stackhouse in the middle of the night?

93
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:23,746
We had certain personal
matters to discuss.

94
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:27,844
After you left my home, I was waiting
for her to return from her engagement.

95
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:30,397
When I heard her car in the drive,
I came across the cemetery.

96
00:08:30,517 --> 00:08:33,349
You're saying you heard a car coming
from clean across the cemetery?

97
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:35,268
Heightened senses
are a common side effect

98
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:38,401
- of our condition.
- But you didn't see or hear

99
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:40,975
any other vehicles
coming from the house?

100
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:43,620
- Something like a truck maybe?
- No.

101
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,082
Lot of folks wouldn't be too keen on
a vampire moving in next door,

102
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:48,517
but Adele Stackhouse,

103
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:51,183
she welcomed you
with open arms, didn't she?

104
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:55,608
- She was very gracious, yes.
- So...

105
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:04,456
They were all very gracious
to your... people.

106
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,315
That's just about the one
thing they had in common.

107
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:13,014
Now, is that one hell
of a plus-size coincidence or what?

108
00:09:13,174 --> 00:09:14,307
I don't believe so.

109
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,758
- Excuse me?
- I suspect whoever did this

110
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:20,980
is targeting women
who associate with vampires.

111
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:25,496
You can't be serious.
Adele Stackhouse? And a vamp?

112
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:29,576
I don't think Sookie's grandmother
was the intended victim.

113
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,414
I should probably call Jason.

114
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:41,504
I could do it if you like.

115
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:45,725
Thank you.

116
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:18,001
<i>This is Stackhouse.
Know what to do.</i>

117
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,903
<i>To leave a voice message...</i>

118
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:21,550
What's going on?

119
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,915
They are about to move
your grandmother.

120
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:35,012
You might wanna go sleep
at a friend's. Someplace less isolated.

121
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:36,778
I'm not going anywhere.

122
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:40,878
- Sookie, perhaps...
- No. This is my house.

123
00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:43,970
- I'm staying right here.
- Turn her there. All right.

124
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,370
Coming through.

125
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:57,303
<i>Please, God. Hope she didn't
recognize meat that vampire bar.</i>

126
00:10:57,486 --> 00:10:59,667
<i>I look different, it was dark,
and she was...</i>

127
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:02,156
<i>Dumb luck you're not
in that bag right now,</i>

128
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:03,908
<i>screwing that vampire.</i>

129
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:06,724
<i>You could be next.</i>

130
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:09,954
- Truly sorry about your grandmother.
- Are y'all done in there? 'Cause...

131
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:11,497
I'd like to clean up.

132
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:13,058
If that's all right.

133
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:14,737
All right, then.

134
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:18,824
You call us
at the first sign of anything.

135
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:23,185
- Keep an eye on her.
- I will.

136
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:25,578
They are right.
You should not stay here.

137
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:26,698
I agree.

138
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:29,483
You can have my trailer.
I'll sleep at the bar.

139
00:11:31,012 --> 00:11:32,784
I'm as safe here as anywhere.

140
00:11:33,411 --> 00:11:36,147
Besides, I got both of you
to protect me, haven't I?

141
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,827
I have to go.

142
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Of course.

143
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:45,291
It's almost dawn.

144
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:50,212
And I will come back. Later.

145
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,806
I can take it from here.

146
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:01,444
Don't worry about me.

147
00:12:03,064 --> 00:12:03,968
Go.

148
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:21,243
There's an extra mop round back.

149
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:23,162
Would you mind getting it for me?

150
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:25,490
Gran took a lot of pride
in her home.

151
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:28,376
She wouldn't want anyone
to see it like this.

152
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:23,866
Oh. That looks great.

153
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:27,031
- Why don't you put it in the kitchen?
- It was so sad.

154
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:30,061
That Stackhouse girl hasn't
come out of the kitchen.

155
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:32,673
I heard she hasn't cried
a single tear.

156
00:13:32,793 --> 00:13:35,581
You know she's been going around
with that vampire.

157
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:45,216
Mrs. Fortenberry,

158
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:48,895
- you shouldn't have.
- You poor child.

159
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:51,709
I am so sorry for your loss.

160
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:53,735
That's very kind of you.

161
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:56,990
Gran often talked about you, so...

162
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:58,841
thank you.

163
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:02,321
Yeah, 'cause nothing says
I'm sorry like a tuna cheese casserole.

164
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,554
Another one?

165
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:06,447
I ain't seen Jason.
Is he here yet?

166
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,267
How the hell should I know.
I ain't his keeper.

167
00:14:12,464 --> 00:14:13,439
Bitch.

168
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:16,400
Adele was just an angel
sent from heaven.

169
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:18,360
Too good for this world.

170
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,439
We're all gonna miss her so much.

171
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,334
<i>Heard they almost cut off her head.</i>

172
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:26,285
<i>I don't see any blood.
I should have gotten here sooner.</i>

173
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:29,120
<i>Maybe I should have brought
my red velvet cake</i>

174
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:30,581
- <i>instead.</i>
- Excuse me.

175
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:36,488
I just can't believe it.

176
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:38,797
Are you all right?

177
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,801
- I'm fine. Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

178
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:43,823
It's the least I could do.

179
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:46,680
You poor thing.

180
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,959
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

181
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:53,395
Now, if you need help with moving

182
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:55,166
or anything at all...

183
00:14:56,165 --> 00:14:58,192
Am I moving?
I'm not moving.

184
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:01,534
But, honey.
With it happening...

185
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:04,319
- right here.
- I have far more good memories

186
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:06,274
of this kitchen than bad ones.

187
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:08,563
What a good way to look at it.

188
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:12,039
You know, you really are smarter
than anyone gives you credit for.

189
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,028
Oh, sweetie.
I didn't mean it like that.

190
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:20,172
Maxine Fortenberry,
you put that pie down

191
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:21,341
right now!

192
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:24,315
Come here. She's losing it.

193
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,378
This is Gran's pie!

194
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:35,288
Well, I'm sorry.
I was just making some room.

195
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:37,807
<i>Poor girl is crazy as a bedbug.</i>

196
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:40,350
<i>- We know you killed your grandmother.
- After I spent all morning</i>

197
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,351
<i>- making this casserole.
- Dead because of you.</i>

198
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:45,741
- <i>... your face in front of everybody...</i>
- If y'all excuse us.

199
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,465
I need Sookie upstairs.

200
00:15:50,672 --> 00:15:52,621
Just give us a little girl time.

201
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:55,925
Come on!

202
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:04,393
- I shouldn't have lost it like that.
- Don't you feel sorry for yelling

203
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:06,668
at that snoopy old bitch.
She's been sticking her nose

204
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:08,964
- where it don't belong for years.
- Say it.

205
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:12,352
I mean, if she talked any more shit,
she'd be shaped like a toilet.

206
00:16:15,211 --> 00:16:16,374
I'm sorry.

207
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:19,006
Gran's gone.

208
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:21,529
She's really gone.

209
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:23,163
Yeah, she is.

210
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,159
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

211
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:35,399
- Can't even think straight.
- Of course you can't.

212
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,149
How can you,
with all these circling buzzards.

213
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:40,717
You know you're not
their entertainment.

214
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:44,381
You don't have to dance for 'em.
You gotta feel whatever you're feeling.

215
00:16:45,262 --> 00:16:46,600
I'm not sure I'm...

216
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,402
feeling anything.

217
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:55,351
I'm just numb.

218
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:57,603
- Numb is good.
- Yeah.

219
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:00,627
Numb is probably exactly
what you need right now.

220
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:04,480
Stop worrying about being
so damn appropriate.

221
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:07,150
This is not an appropriate event.

222
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:15,971
Thank you for getting me
out of there.

223
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,366
I haven't had
a single minute of silence.

224
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,062
Can't seem to...

225
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,340
block anything out right now.

226
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,717
You want me to tell 'em all
to shut the hell up?

227
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:31,230
- I wish it were that easy.
- It is.

228
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:33,826
Your wish...

229
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:35,827
is my command.

230
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:37,518
I don't do drugs.

231
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:39,765
Relax.

232
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:43,510
This is not drugs.
This... is just a Valium.

233
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:47,740
I'll tell you what.
Put it in your night stand,

234
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,405
just in case you change your mind.

235
00:17:52,276 --> 00:17:54,883
I'm gonna go
and check on the circling buzzards.

236
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:56,738
- Lafayette?
- Yes ma'am.

237
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:00,458
Would you mind...

238
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:02,592
taking this downstairs for me?

239
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,883
I will guard it with my life.

240
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,983
Holy shit.
This ain't no good.

241
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:42,040
Yeah, I know. I know.
I'm late.

242
00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:45,319
My alarm broke
and I couldn't find my phone.

243
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:50,195
What you doing here?

244
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:51,467
My job.

245
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:56,094
Fuck.

246
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:57,723
He don't know, him?

247
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:04,646
Man, I am so sorry.

248
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,062
About what?

249
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:12,515
You want me to call anyone?
Your cousin Hadley?

250
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:14,895
No one's heard
from her in over a year.

251
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:17,891
Since she ran away
from that rehab Gran paid for.

252
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:20,754
I don't even know
how to get hold of her.

253
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:22,706
What about Bill?
Gonna invite him?

254
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,323
Tara, he can't go.

255
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,965
- You're right.
- It's not like you've...

256
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,613
known a lot of vampires.

257
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,550
Kind of takes getting used to.

258
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,046
I'm not sure
I'll ever get used to it.

259
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:35,419
What?

260
00:19:35,563 --> 00:19:38,532
'Cause not everyone is as open-minded
as you. Shoot me.

261
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:41,850
- {\You should}Hear the things people are saying.
- I do.

262
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:47,022
- Bill did not kill my grandmother.
- Don't you get all mad at me.

263
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,227
Nobody's blaming Bill...

264
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:50,366
exactly.

265
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:53,386
But didn't you tell me
he had scary-ass friends?

266
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:54,905
Not all vampires are like that.

267
00:19:55,065 --> 00:19:58,386
I'd fuckin' lose it if anything happened
to you. You know that, right?

268
00:20:02,022 --> 00:20:04,324
Tara, last night was so horrible...

269
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:08,975
I don't know how I would've gotten
through it if it weren't for Bill.

270
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,900
When I'm around him...

271
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:15,388
I don't know
how to explain it exactly, but...

272
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:18,873
it's like I almost feel normal.

273
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:33,110
- What the fuck?
- It's your fault!

274
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:36,196
Gran is dead 'cause of you.
It should have been you!

275
00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:37,990
Don't you lay a hand on her!

276
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,659
She's screwing a vampire.
A fucking vampire!

277
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:43,787
That vampire was there for her
when you weren't.

278
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:47,333
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Is that how your grandma raised you?

279
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:49,001
To beat on your own sister?

280
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:50,835
Look at you!

281
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,172
I don't even recognize you anymore!

282
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:56,485
Get the hell out of here.
Get out!

283
00:20:57,335 --> 00:20:58,347
Get out!

284
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:03,405
You okay?

285
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:26,469
- I need to ask you a few questions.
- Not now.

286
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:28,790
- Where were you last night?
- I don't know.

287
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:31,210
I was with a girl.
Tara Thornton?

288
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:32,753
What? No.

289
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:36,506
Yeah, I didn't think so.
What's this one's name?

290
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:39,619
I don't remember her name. Okay?

291
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:41,637
I got a number.

292
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,974
- I don't know what I did with it{\though}.
- Why ain't that convenient?

293
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:49,313
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

294
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:51,990
It's Detective Bellefleur.

295
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:54,883
And what the fuck
do you think it means?

296
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:56,985
Are you saying
I killed my grandmother?

297
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:10,791
You's a stupid bitch,
Jason Stackhouse.

298
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:22,974
Jason Stackhouse tossed Andy Bellefleur
like he was nothing but a rag doll.

299
00:22:23,538 --> 00:22:26,305
Rene makes me watch
that Friday Night Smackdown with him.

300
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:28,184
Those men are built
thicker than walls,

301
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:30,822
but I ain't never seen
one of 'em do that.

302
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:33,473
Well, you know, Jason?
He work out a lot.

303
00:22:34,177 --> 00:22:35,856
He real strong.

304
00:22:38,522 --> 00:22:41,071
All right, everybody!
Sookie needs her rest.

305
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:43,058
It's time for y'all to go now.

306
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:47,577
What the hell are y'all staring at?
You heard me. The sideshow's over. Get.

307
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:49,803
Let's go! Let's go.

308
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:53,321
We appreciate y'all coming out.
Love you all. Come on, let's go.

309
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:54,751
Let's go. Thank you.

310
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,380
That means you too.

311
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:04,528
Look, I get it.

312
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:07,203
But right now she needs to be alone.

313
00:23:08,391 --> 00:23:10,587
If there's anything I can do,
you call me.

314
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:12,528
You're a good friend.

315
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:15,124
Now get the fuck out of here.
Please.

316
00:23:16,557 --> 00:23:17,557
All right.

317
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:23,030
Don't make me throw you all out myself,
'cause you know I will.

318
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,520
I heard you.

319
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:34,173
What the fuck is it
with white people and Jell-O?

320
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,259
I don't understand.

321
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,028
What the hell are we gonna do
with all this?

322
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:40,170
Toss it.

323
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,896
Sookie don't need
no bad juju cooking.

324
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:44,254
Bad juju?

325
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:48,889
Way to a man's heart is through
his stomach. That shit true as gold.

326
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:52,513
You put some love in your food,
and the folk can taste it. Smell this.

327
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:56,403
You can smell the... fear and nastiness
coming off that corn bread.

328
00:23:58,169 --> 00:23:59,636
Taste just fine to me.

329
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,403
See, bitch, you gonna wish
you ain't did that. Watch.

330
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:57,635
Maybe I should go
check on Sookie.

331
00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:01,294
Trust me. That child is dead
to the world right now.

332
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:04,214
What the fuck?

333
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,286
What the hell are you doing?

334
00:25:19,363 --> 00:25:20,856
Bill, what's wrong?

335
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,029
I thought...

336
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:27,786
I had a dream. That's all.

337
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:31,047
You go back to sleep. But I...

338
00:25:32,058 --> 00:25:33,256
You don't worry.

339
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,209
I'm not going anywhere.

340
00:25:39,596 --> 00:25:40,440
Go on.

341
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:07,979
Do you think they're capable
of loving a person?

342
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:20,749
Who knows what they're capable of?

343
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:36,693
Lord,

344
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,578
we gather here today to remember
the life of Adele Stackhouse.

345
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:43,415
To celebrate the time that
she enjoyed here on Earth.

346
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:46,097
And to thank you
for each precious moment...

347
00:27:46,574 --> 00:27:48,167
Sookie, my hand.

348
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:50,297
Sorry. Sorry.

349
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:56,098
But even as we grieve,
we shall be comforted...

350
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,065
knowing that she is at peace
in the Lord's kingdom.

351
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,653
And there shall be
no more death.

352
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:04,728
Uncle Bartlett,
what are you doing here?

353
00:28:04,888 --> 00:28:06,605
She was my sister.

354
00:28:07,943 --> 00:28:10,582
You haven't been part
of this family in a long time.

355
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,279
Come on.
Give the guy a break.

356
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,364
Sookie Stackhouse
has prepared a few words.

357
00:28:18,735 --> 00:28:19,577
Honey?

358
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,286
You wanted to say a few words?

359
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:24,756
Sookie, you okay?

360
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:47,758
"Adele Stackhouse was

361
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,004
"everything to me.

362
00:28:51,305 --> 00:28:53,071
"She wasn't just my grandmother.

363
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:54,200
"She was

364
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:56,927
"my parent, my teacher

365
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,622
and my best friend."

366
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:03,209
<i>Oh, please. If it weren't for you,
she'd still be alive.</i>

367
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:04,817
<i>Vampire giving a eulogy.</i>

368
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:07,142
<i>Thought she was a good girl.
Guess you never know.</i>

369
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:09,442
<i>You oughta be in that grave.
And you will be one...</i>

370
00:29:09,562 --> 00:29:10,957
<i>Shame on you, we all know</i>

371
00:29:11,077 --> 00:29:12,753
To say she'll be missed...

372
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,475
just doesn't cut it 'cause...

373
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,314
I can even imagine a world
without her in it.

374
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:25,950
She was always there,

375
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,019
with a kind word

376
00:29:28,978 --> 00:29:30,325
and a hot meal...

377
00:29:31,942 --> 00:29:33,486
and a shoulder to cry on.

378
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:36,642
Not just for me, but...

379
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:38,864
<i>Forgive me.</i>

380
00:29:38,984 --> 00:29:40,246
... everyone who knew her.

381
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:42,826
<i>I never meant to hurt no one.</i>
<i>I couldn't...</i>

382
00:29:42,986 --> 00:29:44,828
<i>Poor pathetic thing.</i>

383
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:46,294
<i>Just as nuts as nuts can be.</i>

384
00:29:46,414 --> 00:29:48,081
<i>You're sleeping with her killer.</i>

385
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:49,499
<i>She's dead because of you.</i>

386
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:50,660
Shut up!

387
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,187
All of you,
just shut the fuck up!

388
00:29:56,884 --> 00:29:58,091
<i>Look at her, cursing...</i>

389
00:29:58,251 --> 00:30:00,009
<i>This whole world's
just plain crazy...</i>

390
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:01,751
<i>Oh my God, Sookie, oh my God.</i>

391
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,287
<i>That's a shame.</i>

392
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:18,391
Is there anyone else who'd care
to share a few words?

393
00:30:20,933 --> 00:30:22,583
I got something to say.

394
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:27,829
What is she doing?

395
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:29,967
No, Mama.

396
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,711
Oh, my fuckin' God, girl.
This is about to get ugly.

397
00:30:42,313 --> 00:30:44,654
I didn't know Ms. Stackhouse
like a lot of you did.

398
00:30:47,383 --> 00:30:49,421
But the few times I did meet her...

399
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,481
she was nothing but kind to me.

400
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:57,442
She was a good

401
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,177
God-fearing woman.

402
00:31:04,983 --> 00:31:07,136
And when I was going
through some bad things...

403
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,946
my daughter would go stay with her.

404
00:31:12,283 --> 00:31:14,292
And I always knew
she'd be just fine.

405
00:31:18,424 --> 00:31:20,979
Adele Stackhouse took care
of my baby when I couldn't...

406
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:24,594
and I'll always be
grateful for that.

407
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:35,349
Just hold on for a sec.

408
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:37,106
Why? So you can hit me again?

409
00:31:37,266 --> 00:31:38,712
Go ahead, tell me it's my fault.

410
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,965
Tell me how you wish
it were me in that coffin.

411
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,417
- I deserve it.
- I'm sorry.

412
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:51,321
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't touch me.

413
00:31:53,449 --> 00:31:54,921
I didn't mean to hurt you.

414
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,669
- You gotta know that.
- You invited Uncle Bartlett!

415
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:00,797
- How could you do that?
- He has a right to be here!

416
00:32:01,716 --> 00:32:03,698
Look, I know he and Gran
had their problems.

417
00:32:03,818 --> 00:32:06,359
But wherever they were,
it don't matter no more.

418
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:08,980
'Cause that's what family does.

419
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,331
Always forgive each other.

420
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:15,478
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

421
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,705
Please.

422
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,777
I mean, we're all we've got.

423
00:32:24,637 --> 00:32:25,816
We've got nothing.

424
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,671
I was moved.
Very moved.

425
00:32:52,741 --> 00:32:55,977
You should come to our next Descendants
of the Glorious Dead meeting.

426
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:58,459
That some kind of
support group thing?

427
00:32:58,724 --> 00:33:01,065
I went to one of those
AA meetings once.

428
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:02,900
It was nothing but a cult.

429
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:07,145
Hi, baby.
This is my precious daughter, Tara.

430
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:09,907
We've met like a hundred
times too many. Excuse us.

431
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,097
- The hell are you doing?
- Just talking to that nice lady.

432
00:33:14,217 --> 00:33:15,936
Let go my arm.
You're hurting me!

433
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:17,367
Oh, I'm hurting you?

434
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:18,939
That's funny.

435
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:22,128
'Cause the last time I saw you, you
were beating my head in with a bottle.

436
00:33:22,602 --> 00:33:24,175
Oh, sweet Jesus.

437
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:27,379
You poor child.

438
00:33:28,952 --> 00:33:30,136
I am so sorry.

439
00:33:37,577 --> 00:33:40,274
You have no right
to speak for that woman.

440
00:33:42,265 --> 00:33:44,859
She was more of a mother
to me than you ever were.

441
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:47,507
She took care of me.
She fed me,

442
00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:49,548
she put clothes on me.

443
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:53,226
She called Social Services
on you twice.

444
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:55,419
- You hated her guts.
- No.

445
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:57,685
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

446
00:33:57,907 --> 00:34:00,199
You used to call her
a white devil bitch.

447
00:34:00,676 --> 00:34:01,867
That wasn't me.

448
00:34:01,987 --> 00:34:03,795
That wasn't me
that said those things.

449
00:34:03,955 --> 00:34:05,602
'Cause you were
too drunk to remember

450
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:07,729
- don't mean it never happened.
- Please, baby.

451
00:34:08,082 --> 00:34:09,196
Just listen.

452
00:34:12,574 --> 00:34:14,745
All those terrible things
I did to you.

453
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:18,017
It wasn't me who did them.

454
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,814
I have a demon inside of me.

455
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:25,566
What?

456
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:27,353
A demon.

457
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:30,174
Living and breathing inside me.

458
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:31,875
Eating me up.

459
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,048
Don't you laugh
at the devil, Tara Mae.

460
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:39,914
'Cause he's as serious as cancer.

461
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:41,187
I'm sorry.

462
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:43,887
I'm sorry.
You have a demon inside you?

463
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,733
- Fuck me. That's too good.
- It ain't funny.

464
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:49,337
You have no idea
what I go through,

465
00:34:49,457 --> 00:34:51,467
wrestling with this demon.

466
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,148
I try and do right.

467
00:34:54,953 --> 00:34:56,273
I try so hard...

468
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,513
but it breaks me down.

469
00:34:59,435 --> 00:35:01,326
It poisons everything.

470
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:07,056
I wanna be the mama
you deserve.

471
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:11,793
I can make up for everything.
I can. It's not to late.

472
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:13,914
But I can't do this alone.

473
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,370
Do what?

474
00:35:20,763 --> 00:35:22,298
I got to get it out of me...

475
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,335
and it's very expensive.

476
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:33,076
And that's why you came
to this woman's funeral?

477
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:35,170
'Cause you want money?

478
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,098
I had nowhere else to go.

479
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:42,232
Tara, please.

480
00:35:42,775 --> 00:35:44,363
Don't walk away
from me.

481
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:46,397
I am still your mama.

482
00:35:48,351 --> 00:35:49,462
I need you!

483
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:52,964
You're all I've got.

484
00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:38,816
I'm so sorry.

485
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:49,972
Sorry for you loss.

486
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:52,338
We're not done, Stackhouse.

487
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:53,965
<i>What?</i>

488
00:36:55,835 --> 00:36:56,884
<i>Oh, Lord.</i>

489
00:37:42,823 --> 00:37:43,639
Fuck!

490
00:37:43,941 --> 00:37:44,834
Fuck!

491
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,656
Shit!

492
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:02,771
Fuck!

493
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:36,861
I was looking for you.

494
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,733
Well...

495
00:38:40,423 --> 00:38:41,388
you found me.

496
00:38:46,111 --> 00:38:47,580
I liked your speech.

497
00:38:48,628 --> 00:38:50,182
What I heard of it, anyway.

498
00:38:55,227 --> 00:38:58,653
Especially liked the part where you told
the whole town to shut the fuck up.

499
00:39:00,647 --> 00:39:02,538
Yeah, I'm a real crowd pleaser.

500
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:11,693
I'll walk you home.

501
00:39:42,335 --> 00:39:44,029
So how about you take a bath?

502
00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:47,992
I'll find us some stupid movie on TV.
Something with aliens.

503
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:51,726
- Romantic comedy then?
- Sam, not now.

504
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:53,419
I just...

505
00:39:54,495 --> 00:39:55,778
I need to be alone.

506
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,454
Thanks.

507
00:40:20,923 --> 00:40:22,556
She said she wants to be alone.

508
00:40:24,332 --> 00:40:25,315
Well, I don't.

509
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,637
Me either.

510
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:05,641
Won't ever give you enough
of this goddamn chicken.

511
00:43:08,082 --> 00:43:09,632
Lady, I want the legs.

512
00:43:12,229 --> 00:43:13,652
You piece of shit!

513
00:43:13,942 --> 00:43:15,393
I'll fucking
kill you.

514
00:43:15,776 --> 00:43:17,797
Don't worry.
She says that all the time.

515
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:34,337
Come on, you gotta admit,
it has a certain charm.

516
00:43:34,457 --> 00:43:35,636
You live here?

517
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,961
You want a beer?

518
00:43:40,627 --> 00:43:42,424
- They're warm.
- Yeah. Sure.

519
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:49,056
This is really where you live?

520
00:43:51,406 --> 00:43:53,848
Yes, Sam.
This is really where I live.

521
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,796
You trying to make me feel bad?

522
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:57,518
No. It's just...

523
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:02,013
- Thought you lived with Lafayette.
- I was.

524
00:44:02,453 --> 00:44:05,041
Do you know he has
a webcam in his bathroom?

525
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:08,454
No way I'm letting a bunch
of perverts watch me pee.

526
00:44:14,774 --> 00:44:17,142
You should've told me
you needed somewhere to stay.

527
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:18,406
Why?

528
00:44:18,526 --> 00:44:21,025
So you can ride up on
your white horse and save me?

529
00:44:23,076 --> 00:44:25,346
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

530
00:44:26,701 --> 00:44:28,645
Try and turn everything
into a fight.

531
00:44:29,807 --> 00:44:32,214
Why is it so hard to just let
someone be nice to you?

532
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:35,156
I don't know.

533
00:44:35,484 --> 00:44:37,540
You think maybe I have
bad self-esteem.

534
00:44:37,821 --> 00:44:40,347
Maybe it's the only way I know
how to express my real feelings.

535
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:47,101
- I should go.
- Would you relax?

536
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:50,009
- I was only teasing.
- Maybe I'm sick of being teased.

537
00:44:50,129 --> 00:44:51,024
Stay!

538
00:44:53,145 --> 00:44:54,701
- Please.
- What for?

539
00:44:55,183 --> 00:44:56,643
'Cause I want you to.

540
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,532
I don't wanna play games.

541
00:45:03,498 --> 00:45:04,921
I don't want no strings.

542
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:08,544
I just...

543
00:45:09,265 --> 00:45:11,165
I want something real in my life.

544
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:13,013
And you think I don't?

545
00:45:20,169 --> 00:45:21,507
If we do this...

546
00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:24,424
we really did this.

547
00:47:28,257 --> 00:47:31,199
- Holy shit.
- I'll take that as a compliment.

548
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:33,301
I guess I really
needed that.

549
00:47:33,421 --> 00:47:35,206
Me too. Let's do it again.

550
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:38,776
<i>- Come back.
- I had to baby. I'm sorry. I love you.</i>

551
00:47:38,936 --> 00:47:40,374
<i>I love you too.</i>

552
00:47:40,494 --> 00:47:42,877
<i>I need you. I need you</i>
<i>so fuckin' much...</i>

553
00:47:43,813 --> 00:47:45,292
I guess they made up.

554
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,834
Listen...
I gotta go.

555
00:47:54,202 --> 00:47:55,083
What?

556
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,478
It's the middle of the night.

557
00:47:58,526 --> 00:48:00,214
What just happened?
Did I do something?

558
00:48:00,374 --> 00:48:01,652
It's not about you.

559
00:48:03,026 --> 00:48:03,984
I'm sorry.

560
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:09,150
I'll see you at work, okay?

561
00:48:13,094 --> 00:48:14,394
<i>This feels so good!</i>

562
00:48:16,411 --> 00:48:17,330
Oh, God!

563
00:48:19,754 --> 00:48:20,952
I love you.

564
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:23,718
I love you.

565
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:29,425
Is...

566
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:31,138
Is something wrong?

567
00:50:16,478 --> 00:50:17,554
Hi, Mama.

568
00:50:21,655 --> 00:50:22,989
I knew you'd come.

569
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:48,849
Do it.

570
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,002
I want you to.
