1
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:05,713
What the hell?

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,382
You've outdone yourself.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,177
I have other people bringing us
something living to sacrifice.

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,179
So she says God is coming?

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,082
And everybody's at Merlotte's
to catch Sam

6
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:16,578
and take him to Maryann's.

7
00:00:16,703 --> 00:00:19,602
I'm going to Merlotte's and find out
what the hell is happening on my turf-

8
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:25,107
We have secured the target.
Mission accomplished!

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,179
You want me to call anyone?
Your cousin Hadley?

10
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:30,446
No one's heard from her since she ran
away from that rehab Gran paid for.

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,366
What are you doing in my house?

12
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,742
You don't scare me.

13
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,782
What did you do to him?

14
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,853
What are you?

15
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,211
None of your business!

16
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,908
Y'all go and leave,
every last one of you.

17
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,636
- Come on out.
- There's Sam Merlotte!

18
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,627
<i>It is me, the God Who Comes.</i>

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,358
<i>I smite thee, Sam Merlotte!</i>

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,788
- I can't see or hear anything.
- I will glamour her.

21
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,579
I gotta go get Eggs.

22
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,998
It's all coming from Maryann.
How do we kill her?

23
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,460
I do not know how to defeat her,
but I know one vampire who might.

24
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,587
A half-man and a dead whore.

25
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:30,881
Fuck no!

26
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,475
Welcome, Mr. Compton.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,001
The queen is expecting you.

28
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:35,527
Your Majesty.

29
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,734
Is this a bad time?

30
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:55,259
A bad time?

31
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:58,074
There's not such thing as bad.

32
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:00,202
Or time, for that matter.

33
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,379
Want to join me?

34
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,134
Sync: mpm & Arrow

35
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,488
Get up!

36
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:45,531
Have you lost your mind?

37
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:47,714
Didn't you hear 
what she said about you?

38
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,689
- And me.
- She's my mama!

39
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:51,131
She gets to!

40
00:03:51,884 --> 00:03:53,294
The hell are you from?

41
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:54,649
- Mama?
- I'm sorry.

42
00:03:57,055 --> 00:03:58,195
You all right?

43
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,123
I should have listened to vampire Bill
when he warned me about you.

44
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:12,858
Now, come on.

45
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,201
Do we have to?

46
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:18,552
I think I actually enjoyed that.

47
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:21,290
You see what you did to her?

48
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,721
Come on.

49
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,389
What gives you the right to say no
to the femoral blood of a good woman?

50
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:59,089
You know what your problem is,
William?

51
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,197
You are a snob.

52
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:03,457
I hate snobs.

53
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,955
Tiny, tiny souls, or penises.

54
00:05:07,218 --> 00:05:08,218
Or both.

55
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:11,685
Get out.

56
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,650
- Have you eaten?
- Not tonight, but...

57
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:22,320
I have several new members of court.

58
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:23,764
A Latvian boy.

59
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,589
Has to be tasted to be believed.

60
00:05:25,714 --> 00:05:27,597
Not polluted like most humans.

61
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,452
Tastes the way they used to taste

62
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,954
just after I was turned,

63
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:34,407
before the Industrial Revolution
fucked everything to hell.

64
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,543
- Should I summon him?
- No, thank you.

65
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:39,746
There are a pressing matters
at hand I need your help with.

66
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:42,945
I need to know how to kill a maenad.

67
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:45,422
A maenad?

68
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,849
In Bon Temps?
That's random.

69
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,932
Yes. She seems to have caused
some sort of mass

70
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,066
hypnosis.

71
00:05:52,514 --> 00:05:55,645
The whole town has devolved
a primitive state in a matter of days.

72
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:57,707
Oh, my, she's an Old One.

73
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,963
Well, they're all old.

74
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:00,900
Relics.

75
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:03,653
- Ancient Greece, correct?
- Before that even.

76
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:05,838
Orgies, sacrifice?

77
00:06:06,585 --> 00:06:07,490
Cannibalism?

78
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,289
We suspect.

79
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:10,496
Fun.

80
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,373
So how do I kill it?

81
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,541
You can't.

82
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,003
She's convinced herself
she's immortal and so she is.

83
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:25,548
William, surely you know
that everything that exists

84
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:27,525
imagined itself into existence.

85
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:32,015
I'm not entirely familiar
with that theory, no.

86
00:06:33,452 --> 00:06:34,702
Think about it.

87
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,834
You're a wild young girl
who's married to some jerk

88
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,479
who treats you like property

89
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:41,316
and is also fucking
some 14-year-old boy.

90
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:43,735
And along comes this religion,

91
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,873
which encourages you
to get hammered,

92
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:49,108
run naked through the woods,
have sex with whoever,

93
00:06:49,315 --> 00:06:50,591
or whatever,

94
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:53,416
and it's all part of getting
closer to God.

95
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:56,019
I could see how that would have
its appeal,

96
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:59,167
especially to humans
with their tendency towards Puritanism.

97
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:00,415
Exactly.

98
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,355
So you're fucking everybody
in the dirt.

99
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:06,001
Why not kill something
and eat it raw?

100
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:08,218
Hey, you're super extra pious.

101
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,865
There's nothing you can't do,

102
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,221
and each time you do it just brings you
one step closer to the divine.

103
00:07:14,697 --> 00:07:16,726
- Isn't that delusional?
- Never underestimate

104
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,591
the power of blind faith.

105
00:07:19,116 --> 00:07:21,673
It can manifest in ways
that bend the laws of physics

106
00:07:21,798 --> 00:07:23,346
or break them entirely.

107
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:27,403
I bit her and it poisoned me.

108
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:28,948
Of course it did.

109
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:32,533
We can only drink human blood,
and she's no longer even remotely human.

110
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:34,369
But she started out as human.

111
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,438
Hello. Evolution?

112
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,915
We started out that way too.

113
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:44,659
Less than two hours till dawn.

114
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:47,538
Shall we have sex?

115
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,261
Kidding.

116
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:56,766
I haven't enjoyed sex with men
since the Eisenhower administration.

117
00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:59,950
- I really ought to get back to...
- Nonsense.

118
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:03,106
Sookie's not in any trouble.
You would know it.

119
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:06,901
- But I...
- Spend the day and leave tomorrow.

120
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:09,371
- I really would l...
- I insist.

121
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:19,455
By the way, you haven't told me
what you think of my new day room.

122
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:24,665
It's lovely.

123
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:28,381
Tara, stop pacin'.
You need to get some sleep.

124
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:30,997
We have to go get him.

125
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:33,550
And we will as soon as Bill
gets back.

126
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:36,139
He might have some information
about how to deal with Maryann.

127
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:38,739
He might have some information?
He might not.

128
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:40,518
And Eggs needs to get out now.

129
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,539
Tara, it's just too dangerous.

130
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:44,730
How many times
have you put yourself in danger

131
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:46,096
for the man you love?

132
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,814
You get that option and I don't?

133
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:50,090
Baby girl, it's better this way.

134
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,407
Oh shit, she coming for you.

135
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:57,495
I finally found a strong, beautiful,

136
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,220
good man who loves me,

137
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:02,373
and you want to keep me from saving him
'cause you're afraid I might get hurt?

138
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:06,249
How hurt do you think I'm gonna be
if we wait and something happens to him?

139
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:08,504
I ain't lettin' you go back
to somebody who beats you.

140
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:11,132
- He beat her?
- No, it... It wasn't him.

141
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,019
It was Maryann.
Her influence.

142
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:15,292
She didn't throw the punches
herself, did she? No.

143
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,518
Now, sit down and shut the fuck up.

144
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,048
Sookie, my back pocket,
get them handcuffs.

145
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:24,157
These are fur.

146
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:26,567
Give me your hand.

147
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,550
Give me your goddamn hand.

148
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,319
I will never forgive you for this.
Never.

149
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:34,451
You're just jealous
'cause I found love

150
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:37,368
and you know you never will,
you fuckin' freak.

151
00:09:38,216 --> 00:09:39,827
Baby, it's for you own good.

152
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:42,913
You too. You don't want me to be
happy 'cause you never were.

153
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,457
I only want you to be happy.

154
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,876
And you had to settle
for a dead man.

155
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,818
That's supposed to get me
on your side?

156
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:55,352
I'm goin' on the front porch
to make sure that woman

157
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:57,316
- don't try to come up.
- She will?

158
00:09:57,441 --> 00:09:59,555
All I know is if it's
supernatural and it wants you,

159
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,781
it ain't gonna wait for you
to come to it.

160
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:19,389
You are kiddin' me.

161
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:21,076
This ain't happenin' to you.

162
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:25,498
Seriously?

163
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:27,875
You can become any animal anytime?

164
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:31,399
Yeah, as long
as I've imprinted on it.

165
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:35,299
That is fuckin' cool, man.

166
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,689
Yeah, well,

167
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:38,508
as cool as that may be,

168
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,846
we still got a maenad
we gotta deal with

169
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,188
- before it takes our whole town out.
- Listen, you can't deal with it.

170
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:47,921
All right, your best bet's
to leave while you still can.

171
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:50,341
Shouldn't we think about
getting the law in involved?

172
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:51,709
I am involved.

173
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:54,040
Well, I meant Sheriff Dearborne,
Kenya,

174
00:10:54,165 --> 00:10:56,109
that other guy, the squirrelly one.

175
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:58,163
Sheriff's station was wide open
and empty.

176
00:10:58,288 --> 00:10:59,670
They ain't gonna help.

177
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,535
Then we have got to be the law.

178
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:08,455
Guys, I read a book about this.
This is Armageddon.

179
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,155
This is the <i>Oral History
of the Zombie War.</i>

180
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:15,839
We need weapons, lots of them.

181
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:19,718
I hate to break it to you, but guns
aren't gonna do jack shit to Maryann.

182
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:21,971
And you can't shoot anybody else.

183
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,351
These are our friends,

184
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,766
this is our town.

185
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:28,686
Well, sometimes you need
to destroy somethin' to save it.

186
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,850
That's in the Bible.

187
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,059
Or the Constitution.

188
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:37,338
Is she in there?

189
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:51,232
Who's out there?

190
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:00,029
No need to be afraid.

191
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,436
Just come on out so we can see
each other.

192
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,119
Coby?

193
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,803
- Is our mama here?
- No, no. Not right now.

194
00:12:26,928 --> 00:12:28,495
Good. Will you help us hide?

195
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,704
And will you make us lunch?

196
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:34,084
We haven't eaten since the day
before yesterday.

197
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:37,504
We are taking off.

198
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:39,603
- Where you going?
- Sheriff's office.

199
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:41,800
We gotta arm ourselves.
Hey, Coby, Lise.

200
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:43,702
Jason, no. You... You...

201
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:45,994
You're walkin' into something
bigger and more dangerous

202
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,389
than you can even imagine.

203
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,092
I gotta do this.

204
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:52,212
You're gonna get yourself killed.

205
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:55,981
And probably a lot of other people
as well. Just think this through.

206
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:57,949
Time for thinking is over.

207
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,716
It's time for action.

208
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:02,241
Maybe Sam's right.

209
00:13:05,846 --> 00:13:07,867
Has he been
to Leadership Conference?

210
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,550
Has he had paramilitary training?

211
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:12,999
You're a damn fool, Jason.

212
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:14,243
Come on.

213
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:17,336
Let's go inside, get you kids
somethin' to eat. Come on.

214
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,176
You're a damn fool, Jason.

215
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:24,563
By the way, you're welcome
for me saving your life!

216
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:30,213
Can you believe that?

217
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:31,638
What an asshole.

218
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,029
Welcome to my world, Jason.

219
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,353
Don't you at least want to sit down?

220
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:54,378
Nope.

221
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:02,408
It's a text from Bill.

222
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:05,114
From five hours ago.
Damn it.

223
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:07,153
I'm getting a new phone
as soon as Eric pays me.

224
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:08,978
You're working for Eric?

225
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:11,495
Great.

226
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:14,139
Bill's not coming back
until tomorrow.

227
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:17,932
Well, then I guess we better
not plan on him saving us.

228
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,871
Mama, you gotta let me go.

229
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:25,244
You keep me here
and anything happens to Eggs,

230
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:27,822
you will have destroyed
my one chance at true love.

231
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:29,132
Girl,

232
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,532
you don't want true love.

233
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:34,156
True love will rip you open.

234
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:35,894
It'll tear you up.

235
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,570
I will forgive you.

236
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:39,898
For everything.

237
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:41,781
Everything.

238
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,215
You know that is a lot.
And this is a one-time-only offer.

239
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,592
I can't, baby.
I can't.

240
00:14:47,811 --> 00:14:51,210
- If you don't, God will judge you.
- It's God telling me not to.

241
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:53,249
It is Satan.

242
00:14:53,846 --> 00:14:56,538
That's Satan
in your motherfuckin' Sunday hat.

243
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,604
Satan has been telling you
he is God for a long time,

244
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:01,961
and you've fallen for it hook,
line, and sinker.

245
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:03,300
That ain't true.

246
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:04,626
Yes, it is.

247
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,580
I see it in your eyes,

248
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,024
and it's looking right back at me.

249
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:14,013
Like it has ever since I was born.

250
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:17,747
God, you've never been
a real woman of God.

251
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,587
You never stepped outside
your own ignorance and fear

252
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:23,494
and done something selfless

253
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:25,441
for me or for anybody.

254
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,396
God is knocking
on your door right now, Mama.

255
00:15:32,157 --> 00:15:34,457
It couldn't be more loud and clear.

256
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:36,891
Are you gonna let him in?

257
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:53,701
Lord God, I take refuge in you.

258
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:57,070
Save and deliver me
from all those who pursue me,

259
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:00,231
or they will tear at me
like a lion and rip me to pieces

260
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:02,565
and there will
be no one to rescue me.

261
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,211
What was it like inside Tara's head?

262
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:09,011
Like there was no limit,

263
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:11,964
like anything could happen

264
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,592
and it probably will.

265
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:19,475
And you can feel
your insides expanding,

266
00:16:19,924 --> 00:16:22,016
but there's also this...

267
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,064
This emptying out

268
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:28,501
of everything right at
the very center of your being,

269
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,020
and you don't want that
to ever stop.

270
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:33,531
Ever.

271
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,300
Damn, that sound nice.

272
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:41,627
Here you go.

273
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,864
And more where that came from.

274
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:47,086
What's wrong with our mama?

275
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:50,514
I'm not sure.

276
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:54,004
- But I think she's sick.
- Is she blind?

277
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:58,372
Well, she might be sometimes,
but not always.

278
00:16:59,214 --> 00:17:00,391
Is she gonna die?

279
00:17:02,017 --> 00:17:03,367
Not anytime soon.

280
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,407
Now listen, has she...

281
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,193
Has she been sick
in front of you a lot?

282
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,308
She doesn't seem sick.

283
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,327
She seems crazy.

284
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:16,783
Is she crazy?

285
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:20,495
Everybody gets a little crazy
every now and then.

286
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:23,137
She's always kissin' Terry

287
00:17:23,262 --> 00:17:26,209
and doin' other gross stuff
when her eyes get weird.

288
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,108
Can we get her a doctor?

289
00:17:28,389 --> 00:17:30,588
Or someone to make her
like she used to be?

290
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:32,799
Like a vampire.

291
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:35,718
- I bet a vampire would know what to do.
- Where's vampire Bill?

292
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:37,783
I don't know.
I think he's...

293
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:39,430
He's still in Dallas.

294
00:17:39,744 --> 00:17:41,516
Don't you know any other vampires?

295
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:47,771
How's your leg?

296
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:50,039
Better than ever.

297
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:52,639
How'd that happen?

298
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:56,364
Eric made me drink
his motherfuckin' blood

299
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,991
- is how that happened.
- Me too. He tricked me.

300
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,869
- Somebody need to slap that bitch.
- I have.

301
00:18:02,504 --> 00:18:03,538
Look at you.

302
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:06,507
Have you had...

303
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:09,293
any dreams...

304
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:10,549
about him?

305
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:15,758
- Now, Sook, how would you know that?
- What kind of dreams?

306
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:20,522
It's like he's always in my head.

307
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:23,339
And sex dreams,
all kind of nasty and...

308
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:25,928
fantastic.

309
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,298
Which freaks me the fuck out

310
00:18:28,423 --> 00:18:30,982
because I hates that motherfucker
more than you'll ever know.

311
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:35,236
Hell. What now?

312
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:37,309
What?

313
00:18:38,056 --> 00:18:41,360
I can't stay in there with her,
sayin' those things that break my heart.

314
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:44,453
I will keep guard
while one of you goes to sit with her.

315
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:47,540
- She can't hurt you like me.
- Yes, she can.

316
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:51,109
- You ain't gonna shoot yourself.
- Show me some respect, boy.

317
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:52,845
I taught you how to shoot a gun.

318
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,168
When those boys from your school
was givin' you trouble.

319
00:18:55,293 --> 00:18:57,095
Yeah, but auntie, that was a BB gun

320
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,051
you used to shoot cats with.

321
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,428
You shot cats?

322
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:03,022
Only when they went
to the bathroom in my yard.

323
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:07,624
All right now.

324
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,568
- What you doin'?
- Tara, baby, I got the gun!

325
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:18,279
- You are not really doing this.
- Go unlock the handcuffs.

326
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:20,256
Go!

327
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:26,996
Miss Thornton,
Lafayette was recently shot.

328
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:28,618
- He's been...
- Go unlock Tara.

329
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:30,541
So she can go back to Maryann?

330
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,710
You've seen what it's like
in there. That evil.

331
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:34,544
You're sending Tara back?

332
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:37,199
I got a chance
to win my baby back for real.

333
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:39,592
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

334
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:45,006
- Keys?
- It's... It's in my pocket,

335
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:46,724
but I can't can't move.

336
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,166
I pity you.

337
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:04,886
I don't hate you
like your mama does.

338
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:07,951
You can't help what you are.

339
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,917
But I cannot let you
keep me and Tara apart.

340
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,388
And that's why
I'm gonna have to kill you.

341
00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:22,956
I thought you wanted
to be a vampire.

342
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,946
You know how you feel
with my blood inside you?

343
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:39,049
Well, being a vampire
is like that...

344
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:42,851
times a million.

345
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,995
Goodbye, sweetheart.

346
00:20:54,543 --> 00:20:56,752
- What the hell did you do to him?
- Nothing.

347
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:58,753
Tara, baby, go!

348
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:02,148
And don't you ever forget
I did this for you!

349
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:07,403
I need the keys.

350
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,101
You are being a fuckin' idiot.

351
00:21:24,562 --> 00:21:26,571
You think Sam's
ever turned into a dog

352
00:21:26,696 --> 00:21:28,972
and then had sex with a lady dog?

353
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:32,078
Jesus, Jason,
you're talkin' about bestiality.

354
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:34,573
No, it ain't bestiality
if there ain't a human involved.

355
00:21:34,698 --> 00:21:36,437
Then it's just nature.

356
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:39,364
Sure don't seem like nature to me.

357
00:21:39,489 --> 00:21:41,255
What the fuck?

358
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:46,215
That was Everlee Mason.

359
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:49,308
We gotta fix things, Andy.

360
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,017
I ain't lettin' weird shit
like this take over my town.

361
00:21:52,142 --> 00:21:53,937
No fuckin' way.

362
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,782
Really? You dialed 911
and you got me?

363
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,382
Honey, you are fucked.

364
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:07,032
Gotta go. Good luck.

365
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:10,701
Hey there, Detective Bellefleur.

366
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:13,161
I missed you.

367
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:16,946
Don't you remember me?
We almost had sex once.

368
00:22:23,303 --> 00:22:26,383
How would you like to get fucked
every which way but north?

369
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:29,251
It's okay, Andy.

370
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,426
I got this.

371
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:32,264
You just go get the heat.

372
00:22:32,564 --> 00:22:34,911
Stackhouse!
This is a serious operation.

373
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:36,817
Ain't about you
gettin' your pole wet.

374
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:39,220
Dude, do not cockblock me.

375
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:43,860
It'll keep her from telling
anyone else we're here. Now go.

376
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:47,696
I'm gonna turn you inside out, boy.

377
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:50,913
That sounds like it's gonna hurt.

378
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:13,613
Jackpot.

379
00:23:20,948 --> 00:23:22,022
Dance with me.

380
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:23,496
Come on.

381
00:23:29,565 --> 00:23:30,715
Damn it, Bud!

382
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:33,124
You know I hate to dance!

383
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:41,751
Cut it out!

384
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:45,031
I gotta take a dump.

385
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,517
- Why you shakin' like that?
- Because he is traumatized.

386
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:00,727
Well, so am I.

387
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:03,726
I'm gonna do something
and I'll need you to move fast.

388
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:05,822
Grab the gun when she drops it.

389
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:07,067
Can you do that?

390
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:10,987
It's all right.
She ain't gonna shoot you.

391
00:24:13,597 --> 00:24:14,897
Would you please

392
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,409
at least lower that gun,
Miss Thornton?

393
00:24:17,534 --> 00:24:18,984
He is freakin' out.

394
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:26,632
Run!

395
00:24:27,255 --> 00:24:28,338
Let's go get Tara.

396
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:31,981
It's not my fault!

397
00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:34,498
She forgave me!
Let her go!

398
00:24:46,306 --> 00:24:47,941
Did you know my daddy?

399
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:49,515
I did not.

400
00:24:50,634 --> 00:24:51,884
Your mom...

401
00:24:52,512 --> 00:24:55,188
she split up with him
before I came to town.

402
00:24:57,235 --> 00:24:58,782
I heard about him, though.

403
00:24:59,155 --> 00:25:00,453
What did you hear?

404
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
That...

405
00:25:03,855 --> 00:25:05,834
He was...
He was a bit of a wild card,

406
00:25:07,812 --> 00:25:09,462
with a big personality.

407
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:12,298
I don't even know
what he looks like.

408
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:15,388
Mama cut him out of all the picture she had.

409
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:18,191
All I know is his name's Duane,
and he tattooed

410
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,931
Mama's name on his stomach.

411
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,690
Well, he must have loved her a lot,

412
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:24,686
because you know that hurt.

413
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,950
Excuse me.

414
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,979
Nothin' to be afraid of.

415
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:48,209
- Just here to see Eric.
- He won't be here till after dark.

416
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,500
Well, obviously.

417
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,297
I have two kids with me.

418
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,163
Can we wait inside?

419
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:56,634
I can't let anyone in.

420
00:25:58,494 --> 00:25:59,844
Not even for a...

421
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,580
hundred dollars?

422
00:26:17,965 --> 00:26:19,850
I can hold that for you if you like.

423
00:26:19,975 --> 00:26:21,884
Might make it a little easier
for you to drive.

424
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:24,587
Ain't nobody gonna
point this pistol but me.

425
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:25,962
Ain't personal.

426
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,010
- Are you okay?
- Nope.

427
00:26:34,181 --> 00:26:35,949
I need you to suck it up.

428
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,536
I cannot do this alone.

429
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:38,661
I know.

430
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:41,220
We just need to get in,
get Tara and get the hell out.

431
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:46,793
And if Maryann gives us any trouble,
you have to shoot her.

432
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,081
- I will.
- I mean it.

433
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:50,313
In the head.

434
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:14,694
Baby.

435
00:27:15,295 --> 00:27:17,445
Where you been?
I was so scared.

436
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:19,712
Don't you ever leave me again, okay?

437
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:20,810
I won't.

438
00:27:20,935 --> 00:27:21,935
I promise.

439
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,442
I love you.

440
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:27,850
We gotta get you out of here, okay?
Let's go somewhere else, please.

441
00:27:28,018 --> 00:27:29,131
Listen to me.

442
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:30,906
But everything you want...

443
00:27:31,855 --> 00:27:33,055
is right here.

444
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:37,485
I knew you'd come.

445
00:27:38,563 --> 00:27:40,758
I don't know what you are,
but I want out.

446
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:43,658
- It's too late for that.
- You made me eat somebody's heart.

447
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:45,865
And you loved it.

448
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:48,120
Admit it.

449
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:50,100
You don't want us.
You want Sam.

450
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:53,573
- We ain't got nothing to do with it.
- Nothing to do with it?

451
00:27:55,418 --> 00:27:56,318
You...

452
00:27:57,268 --> 00:27:58,368
summoned me.

453
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,676
- What?
- That night in the woods

454
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:04,011
with that unfortunate pharmacist.

455
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,722
You saw me.

456
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:09,871
Well, you saw you through me.

457
00:28:13,303 --> 00:28:15,413
<i>Mama, please.
Don't hurt me.</i>

458
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:17,001
<i>One of you must die.</i>

459
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,769
But Miss Jeanette was a fake.

460
00:28:20,894 --> 00:28:23,689
She scammed people
by making up crazy rituals.

461
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:28,026
Ritual is powerful thing.

462
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:31,520
And calling forth
that kind of energy...

463
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:34,542
has consequences.

464
00:28:34,992 --> 00:28:35,992
So...

465
00:28:36,612 --> 00:28:37,762
she was real.

466
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:40,683
Sadly, no.

467
00:28:41,414 --> 00:28:44,677
she wasn't the vessel,
but you have to try every option.

468
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:47,346
Please, just let us go.

469
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,687
That doesn't work on me anymore.

470
00:29:12,956 --> 00:29:14,446
That's more like it.

471
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:31,388
Get on in there.

472
00:29:32,744 --> 00:29:33,744
He came.

473
00:29:34,932 --> 00:29:37,031
- What?
- The God Who Comes.

474
00:29:37,156 --> 00:29:38,188
He came!

475
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:40,858
Yeah, and he smoked
old Sam Merlotte but good.

476
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:43,301
What are you talking about?

477
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,019
He had horns.

478
00:29:49,673 --> 00:29:51,873
And he took Sam Merlotte
and he smote him.

479
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,412
And then Sam disappeared.

480
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:55,641
Gone.

481
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,939
And then... And Sam's clothes
just fell to the ground.

482
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,064
Empty.

483
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:04,381
You fucking morons!

484
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:15,893
Out! Get out!

485
00:30:21,632 --> 00:30:24,091
Must I do everything myself?

486
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:30,411
You ain't got nothin' like grenades,

487
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:31,902
flamethrowers?

488
00:30:32,326 --> 00:30:33,526
I'll tell you.

489
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,784
If you let me blow you.

490
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:39,376
Rosie, I ain't never taken
advantage of someone

491
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:40,709
while she was fucked up.

492
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:42,137
What a liar!

493
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:45,005
I know that Patsy Lyle passed out
in the middle of having sex with you.

494
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,965
She was fine when it started.

495
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,245
Come on.

496
00:30:49,952 --> 00:30:51,887
I'm real good at it.

497
00:30:53,825 --> 00:30:56,074
I just wouldn't feel right
about it, darlin'.

498
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:58,583
Would you feel right about it now?

499
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:02,731
Shoot him.
I want to see what happens to his head.

500
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:06,140
What's the game
with the one bullet in the gun

501
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,750
and you don't know
if it'll go off or not?

502
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:10,902
That Chinese fire drill?

503
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:13,580
- Russian roulette.
- Yeah, that's it.

504
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:16,578
Kevin, drop it.

505
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:23,834
It's okay.

506
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:27,546
Kevlar.

507
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:30,655
Cool.

508
00:31:30,952 --> 00:31:32,010
You get one for me?

509
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:35,389
Only got the one.

510
00:31:35,732 --> 00:31:37,082
Well, that sucks.

511
00:31:40,974 --> 00:31:43,896
<i>You know how big this match is.
Not only are both of these men</i>

512
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:46,968
<i>champions of their respective brand,
I mean, you know... </i>

513
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:50,839
Damn. I should have frozen
these Snickers bars first.

514
00:31:50,964 --> 00:31:54,089
What the hell.
It's all gonna melt when I cook it.

515
00:31:54,214 --> 00:31:55,867
Maybe I'll freeze it then.

516
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:02,328
Mama, what the heck are you doin'?
Hot sauce.

517
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:06,434
Oh, God.

518
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:08,219
Nobody's gonna eat that.

519
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,256
He will.

520
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:12,384
And he is gonna love it.

521
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:16,407
- We have to hurry.
- We ain't goin' nowhere.

522
00:32:16,532 --> 00:32:20,536
Maryann will remember this day
for the rest of her life.

523
00:32:21,284 --> 00:32:24,896
I don't have the heart to tell her
it's all downhill from here.

524
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:27,979
- What the hell are you talkin' about?
- 'Cause there ain't a woman alive

525
00:32:28,104 --> 00:32:30,440
who'd go through with it
if she knew the truth.

526
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:33,962
You can go ahead and pack
that box of chardonnay in the car.

527
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:38,243
- We ain't goin'.
- You are not keepin' me from this.

528
00:32:38,576 --> 00:32:40,954
When Daddy died, I promised you
I would take care of you.

529
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:43,122
You were ten. Let it go.

530
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:45,801
I've already let
too much bad happen to you.

531
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:49,337
You haven't let
enough bad happen to me.

532
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:53,118
You know how many times I wanted
to go down to Merlotte's

533
00:32:53,243 --> 00:32:55,166
and drink myself silly

534
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:59,764
and find some dumb redneck
to take to my bed?

535
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:01,348
But no.

536
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:03,526
I had to take care of you.

537
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,301
- You ain't yourself right now.
- Lordy, boy,

538
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:12,611
you are every bit
as big a pansy as your daddy.

539
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,028
Daddy was a hero.

540
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:15,234
Daddy...

541
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:17,448
was a secret drinker.

542
00:33:18,057 --> 00:33:19,993
You want to know
what I really think?

543
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:22,948
A closet homosexual.

544
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:27,542
That man just liked to dance
more than a normal man should.

545
00:33:27,847 --> 00:33:29,540
Yeah, I don't want to hear this.

546
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,754
It's just mean.

547
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:33,131
He died protecting me
and you from a burglar.

548
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:36,739
Daddy put a bullet in his own head,

549
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:39,262
'cause he was too weak
to handle his responsibilities.

550
00:33:43,361 --> 00:33:46,118
I lied and said it was a burglar,

551
00:33:46,243 --> 00:33:49,813
'cause otherwise we'd have never gotten
that life insurance money, dumb ass.

552
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:05,055
My Gran lived
and died in that house,

553
00:34:06,432 --> 00:34:08,125
and now it's like people

554
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,396
who are the exact opposite
of everything she was are...

555
00:34:15,173 --> 00:34:16,455
defiling her.

556
00:34:20,741 --> 00:34:22,913
I almost got raped in Dallas,

557
00:34:24,477 --> 00:34:26,277
but this is so much worse.

558
00:34:26,937 --> 00:34:28,887
Don't take it personal, Sook.

559
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:32,714
They ain't themselves,
and they're not doin' it on purpose.

560
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,178
When I met Maryann,

561
00:34:34,303 --> 00:34:37,001
I knew there was something
seriously off about her.

562
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:40,442
She was thinking creepy foreign stuff,
and I could tell it wasn't good.

563
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:42,567
You couldn't have stopped her.

564
00:34:44,131 --> 00:34:47,431
How come there's so much wrong
in the world, Lafayette?

565
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,037
How come so many people
are willing to do bad things

566
00:34:55,444 --> 00:34:56,923
and hurt other people?

567
00:34:58,446 --> 00:34:59,868
Because they're weak.

568
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:04,097
Well, I am not weak,
and I am not afraid.

569
00:35:04,265 --> 00:35:07,150
I am gonna kick that bitch's evil ass
out of my Gran's house

570
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:08,884
and then you are gonna shoot her.

571
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:10,745
- In the fuckin' head.
- Right.

572
00:35:11,628 --> 00:35:14,263
Y'all are trespassin'.
You're gonna have to pay a fine.

573
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:16,317
Or go to the brig.

574
00:35:19,138 --> 00:35:22,927
The fine is a hundred million dollars
and your pants.

575
00:35:23,052 --> 00:35:25,077
- I'll take that gun.
- Hey, about drugs?

576
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:27,827
- Would you take some drugs?
- I do not take drugs, thank you.

577
00:35:27,952 --> 00:35:30,329
- What do you got?
- MDMA. Pharmaceutical grade.

578
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:33,001
- You ain't got no oxy?
- Drugs are for losers, baby.

579
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:36,375
It'll make sex real nice.

580
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,941
Okay. Give me.

581
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:40,704
- How much you want?
- All of 'em.

582
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:43,392
Yeah. 'Cause if a job
ain't worth doin' all out,

583
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,144
then why order a hamburger

584
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:48,748
unless there's steak at home
or somethin' like that, right?

585
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,102
I don't wait anymore.
Going in through the back porch.

586
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,188
I'll be right behind, soon as I get done
with these bugeyed freaks.

587
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,408
I got a yellow one.

588
00:35:57,065 --> 00:35:58,665
Here, chickie chickie.

589
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:00,486
Here, chickie chickie.

590
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,534
Why should I help you,

591
00:36:07,475 --> 00:36:08,475
shifter?

592
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,830
Because I need your help.

593
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:12,449
We need it.

594
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,169
And hopefully someday I might be able
to give you somethin' you need.

595
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:19,221
Can you give me Sookie Stackhouse?

596
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,400
That's a shame.

597
00:36:23,152 --> 00:36:25,094
That would be a tribute
I would not soon forget.

598
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:27,151
I'm not here to give you tribute.

599
00:36:27,276 --> 00:36:29,716
No, you're here to request my help

600
00:36:29,841 --> 00:36:32,851
based on a hypothetical future
in which you return the favor.

601
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,732
But you are known
to not be friendly toward those like me.

602
00:36:42,524 --> 00:36:43,696
Why should I trust you?

603
00:36:44,093 --> 00:36:47,220
Because until somebody
starts trusting somebody,

604
00:36:47,345 --> 00:36:49,045
we're all single targets

605
00:36:49,612 --> 00:36:50,995
just ripe for the picking.

606
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:55,096
I have no knowledge
of this maenad creature,

607
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:57,981
although I suspect
it's the bullheaded beast

608
00:36:58,106 --> 00:37:01,505
- that passed through recently. Right?
- That thing owes me a pair of shoes.

609
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,961
- So can you help us or not?
- I do know someone

610
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:07,272
who might be able
to offer something useful.

611
00:37:07,943 --> 00:37:08,721
Might...

612
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:10,089
be able to.

613
00:37:10,766 --> 00:37:12,058
Can we see your fangs?

614
00:37:15,922 --> 00:37:17,687
Don't you like vampires,
little girl?

615
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,778
Our almost stepdaddy hated vampires,

616
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:26,941
but we don't.

617
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:29,492
He went on a vacation with Jesus.

618
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:32,404
You make me so happy
I never had any of you.

619
00:37:32,996 --> 00:37:34,732
Come on, Pam. They're funny.

620
00:37:34,857 --> 00:37:37,083
They're like humans, but miniature.

621
00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:39,267
Teacup humans.

622
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:40,294
I hate them.

623
00:37:41,141 --> 00:37:42,421
They're so stupid.

624
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:44,272
But delicious.

625
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:47,301
So can you call this other person
who might be able to...

626
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:49,369
Better yet, I'll go see her.

627
00:37:51,174 --> 00:37:52,723
But I must leave right away.

628
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:55,684
- No problem.
- I'll walk you out.

629
00:37:56,061 --> 00:37:58,562
Please get those horrible things
out of here.

630
00:37:59,669 --> 00:38:01,856
I'll be smelling them for a week.

631
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:06,104
You have my cell phone number.

632
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:08,712
I'll let you know
if I learn anything of use to you.

633
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:13,744
Good night, tiny humans.

634
00:38:18,555 --> 00:38:20,147
He can fly!

635
00:38:22,129 --> 00:38:25,117
Come on, Coby.
Let's get you two back to Bon Temps.

636
00:38:25,242 --> 00:38:26,542
Come on, get in.

637
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Let's go.

638
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,762
Here we go. All done.

639
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:02,443
Lookie here.

640
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,090
It's a present.

641
00:39:10,011 --> 00:39:11,497
He loves presents.

642
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:49,586
Remember when your Gran
was layin' here...

643
00:39:50,107 --> 00:39:51,507
all bloody and dead?

644
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,202
Of course I do.

645
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:57,936
Come on down here with me.

646
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:07,206
It's okay.

647
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:10,360
It's okay. It's okay.

648
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:16,158
Stop.

649
00:40:19,406 --> 00:40:20,406
Come on.

650
00:40:31,622 --> 00:40:33,235
You smell good.

651
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,376
You don't.

652
00:40:34,747 --> 00:40:36,258
Not at all.

653
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:39,636
Makes you feel more alive

654
00:40:40,244 --> 00:40:42,100
bein' in the presence of death,
don't it?

655
00:40:45,768 --> 00:40:47,330
I guess you'd know that.

656
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:48,905
Not as much as you.

657
00:40:51,145 --> 00:40:54,007
How come you let him
put his dead pecker inside you?

658
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:58,676
- It ain't natural and it ain't right.
- I don't think you're in any position

659
00:40:58,801 --> 00:41:01,267
to talk about
what's natural and right.

660
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:33,485
What are you in the mood for?

661
00:41:33,653 --> 00:41:35,153
Nothin' for me, thank you.

662
00:41:35,591 --> 00:41:38,029
William, you have to eat
before we play Yahtzee.

663
00:41:38,154 --> 00:41:41,284
I need you to play your best game.
I only feed from Sookie.

664
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:48,625
Why on Earth would you do that?

665
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,042
Your Majesty, I implore you.

666
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,933
If you've told me everything
about maenads,

667
00:41:53,058 --> 00:41:54,965
then give me leave
to return to Bon Temps.

668
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:56,908
Oh, dear.

669
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,343
Ludis.

670
00:42:04,368 --> 00:42:05,308
Your Majesty.

671
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,104
Ludis, this is my good friend
Bill Compton.

672
00:42:11,038 --> 00:42:12,789
Would you allow him
to feed from you?

673
00:42:12,914 --> 00:42:14,025
Yes, of course.

674
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,321
- I appreciate the offer, but the...
- William, you have to at least try him.

675
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:19,791
I insist.

676
00:42:22,983 --> 00:42:24,286
I will have a sex with you.

677
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:27,766
That will not be necessary.

678
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:40,256
I love watching two men together.

679
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:48,306
Can I help you?

680
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:54,566
Horse nettle.

681
00:42:54,923 --> 00:42:56,666
Also known as bull nettle,

682
00:42:57,055 --> 00:42:59,688
the Devil's tomato,
and my personal favorite,

683
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:01,577
the apple of Sodom.

684
00:43:03,432 --> 00:43:04,863
It's quite poisonous.

685
00:43:04,988 --> 00:43:07,162
But in the tiniest of doses,

686
00:43:07,613 --> 00:43:10,238
a savory addition
to any wine-based sauce.

687
00:43:13,782 --> 00:43:16,283
Gives it a pungent hint of madness.

688
00:43:19,177 --> 00:43:21,505
- A little touch of total abandon.
- Stop!

689
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,844
And I can tell that you
are no stranger...

690
00:43:24,013 --> 00:43:26,097
- Bitch, I said stop!
- ... to total abandon.

691
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,510
Poor Karl.

692
00:43:37,485 --> 00:43:40,069
You didn't really advance much
in this lifetime.

693
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:45,993
You cook, don't you?

694
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:52,012
I hate threes.

695
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:55,334
Your Majesty,
I really need to leave.

696
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:04,678
Maenads are sad silly things.

697
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:07,171
The world changed centuries ago

698
00:44:07,515 --> 00:44:09,749
and they're still waiting
for the God Who Comes.

699
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:12,549
Does he ever come?

700
00:44:12,877 --> 00:44:15,688
Of course not.
Gods never actually show up.

701
00:44:15,816 --> 00:44:18,066
They only exist in humans' minds,
like money

702
00:44:18,234 --> 00:44:19,384
and morality.

703
00:44:19,861 --> 00:44:22,153
If I can't kill her,
how do I get her to leave Bon Temps?

704
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:26,160
She has to believe
that she's successfully summoned forth

705
00:44:26,285 --> 00:44:28,694
Dionysus...
in hope that he will...

706
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:30,954
ravish her,
quite literally devour her,

707
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:33,081
until she's lost into oblivion.

708
00:44:33,383 --> 00:44:34,825
So she seeks...

709
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,110
death...

710
00:44:36,235 --> 00:44:37,293
the true death.

711
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,198
The one thing she's evolved beyond.

712
00:44:40,323 --> 00:44:41,571
Ironic, isn't it?

713
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:44,474
You know, they're really not that smart,
these maenads.

714
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,823
So how does she summon
this nonexistent god of hers?

715
00:44:47,948 --> 00:44:49,565
I never said he was nonexistent.

716
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,378
I just said he never comes.

717
00:44:51,893 --> 00:44:54,261
She believes if she finds
the perfect vessel,

718
00:44:54,386 --> 00:44:57,389
sacrifices and devours
part of him or her

719
00:44:57,514 --> 00:44:59,575
while surrounded by the magic
of her familiars,

720
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,558
then her mad god will appear.

721
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,237
At that point, when she willingly
surrenders herself to him...

722
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:07,699
- The only point she can be killed.
- He was the smartest boy in class.

723
00:45:09,243 --> 00:45:12,412
- The perfect vessel... human?
- They prefer supernatural beings.

724
00:45:14,126 --> 00:45:16,855
- The two-natured.
- Shifters, yes.

725
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,290
And Weres.

726
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,707
Fortunately,
they show little interest in us.

727
00:45:20,832 --> 00:45:23,081
Something about our hearts
not beating.

728
00:45:23,206 --> 00:45:25,925
But they'll try any other being
that straddles the two worlds.

729
00:45:26,145 --> 00:45:28,005
As long as it has a beating heart.

730
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,346
You have to remember,
they've been trying for centuries.

731
00:45:31,009 --> 00:45:32,969
They're constantly improvising
their recipes

732
00:45:33,094 --> 00:45:36,522
in hopes of finding that one magic
element that will make it all happen.

733
00:45:36,647 --> 00:45:37,647
Idiots.

734
00:45:40,586 --> 00:45:41,586
Excuse me.

735
00:45:42,651 --> 00:45:45,443
Hadley, keep our guests entertained,
won't you?

736
00:45:48,176 --> 00:45:49,176
Really?

737
00:45:49,554 --> 00:45:51,367
- How interesting.
- How's my cousin Sookie?

738
00:45:53,088 --> 00:45:54,138
She's good.

739
00:45:55,305 --> 00:45:56,747
Be sure and tell her I said hey.

740
00:45:57,179 --> 00:45:59,179
- I don't know.
- How's Gran?

741
00:46:00,836 --> 00:46:02,527
I'd love to talk to her sometime,

742
00:46:02,652 --> 00:46:05,213
but I owe her so much money.

743
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:08,634
I think it's best
that you are not in touch.

744
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:10,969
Oh, I know.

745
00:46:11,094 --> 00:46:13,944
There's no place for me
in that world anymore.

746
00:46:15,044 --> 00:46:16,642
Still think about 'em, though.

747
00:46:18,646 --> 00:46:19,753
That'll be all.

748
00:46:22,101 --> 00:46:24,608
Well, seems your friend
Mr. Northman is here.

749
00:46:25,222 --> 00:46:27,722
Then it's definitely time
for me to go.

750
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:31,034
This alpha male posturing,
you really should just fuck each other

751
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:33,244
and get it over with. I could watch.

752
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:35,916
Thank you for seeing me.

753
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,249
Enjoy your restricted diet.

754
00:46:41,028 --> 00:46:43,293
I do look forward to meeting her.

755
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:54,630
Yahtzee.

756
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:05,492
What are you doing here?

757
00:47:06,572 --> 00:47:08,944
Hoping the queen can tell me
how to kick a maenad's ass.

758
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,870
Now why would you want to do that?

759
00:47:13,072 --> 00:47:14,982
So that you'll look like a hero
to Sookie?

760
00:47:16,797 --> 00:47:19,547
This paranoia,
it's really quite unbecoming.

761
00:47:21,734 --> 00:47:23,963
Has she... mentioned me?

762
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:27,922
That was really
quite desperate of you,

763
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:31,550
tricking her into drinking your blood
so that she became attracted to you.

764
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,428
Unlike you who fed her your own blood
the very night you met.

765
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:38,432
- How do you know that?
- So you're not denying it?

766
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,184
- I was saving her life.
- Isn't that convenient?

767
00:47:42,364 --> 00:47:44,271
You stay away from Sookie, Eric.

768
00:47:45,114 --> 00:47:47,384
Or I will tell the queen
that you're forcing humans

769
00:47:47,509 --> 00:47:49,401
to sell vampire blood for you.

770
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:54,654
- You wouldn't.
- I won't,

771
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,035
as long as you never come close
to Sookie ever again.

772
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:00,246
I don't like threats.

773
00:48:00,492 --> 00:48:01,642
Neither do I.

774
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:23,394
Why are we parking so far away?

775
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:25,661
So we can sneak up on them.

776
00:48:26,186 --> 00:48:27,686
Element of surprise.

777
00:48:31,062 --> 00:48:32,312
Carbs. Load up.

778
00:48:48,315 --> 00:48:49,615
You think Sam...

779
00:48:50,067 --> 00:48:51,817
could turn into a chicken

780
00:48:52,277 --> 00:48:53,717
and lay his own egg?

781
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:57,245
Wouldn't that be weird,
eating something

782
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,721
that just came out of you?

783
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:03,058
What kind of a perverted brain
would even think of something like that?

784
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:10,258
Why ain't you never liked me, Andy?

785
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:12,484
Is it because how much pussy I get?

786
00:49:14,446 --> 00:49:16,884
Because I ain't taking
any pussy away from you.

787
00:49:17,009 --> 00:49:19,009
There is more than enough
pussy to go around.

788
00:49:19,134 --> 00:49:20,684
It ain't about pussy.

789
00:49:21,638 --> 00:49:23,786
I just think you've had
everything too easy.

790
00:49:24,824 --> 00:49:27,013
What have I ever had that was easy?

791
00:49:27,138 --> 00:49:29,109
You were all-state quarterback.

792
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:31,368
You think that was easy?

793
00:49:31,689 --> 00:49:34,620
I'm starting to have knee issues,
and I ain't even 30 yet.

794
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:35,883
What else?

795
00:49:36,231 --> 00:49:38,890
Well, yeah, women do just
throw themselves at you.

796
00:49:39,015 --> 00:49:42,430
- You don't even have to do anything.
- Yeah, well, actually I do.

797
00:49:43,017 --> 00:49:45,067
I work out like a motherfucker,

798
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:47,935
and I watch a lot of porn
to learn stuff.

799
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,580
What else?

800
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:54,067
Well, my best friend...

801
00:49:54,435 --> 00:49:56,209
killed my grandma

802
00:49:56,421 --> 00:49:57,821
and my girlfriend.

803
00:49:58,308 --> 00:49:59,858
I come from no money.

804
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:03,075
My mama, my daddy:
died when I was 11.

805
00:50:03,244 --> 00:50:05,746
- So did mine.
- Your daddy died in Vietnam,

806
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:09,536
but your mama ran off
with some Yankee race car driver.

807
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:11,752
You may hate me.

808
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:16,757
You may think you're better than me,
and maybe you are,

809
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:19,968
but you and me
are the ones who have received

810
00:50:20,345 --> 00:50:22,345
the calling to save this town.

811
00:50:24,244 --> 00:50:25,766
So obviously God...

812
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:28,062
wants us to bury the hatchet.

813
00:50:28,435 --> 00:50:30,062
It's all up to us, ain't it?

814
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:31,433
It is.

815
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:33,815
And we can't fuck it up.

816
00:50:35,497 --> 00:50:36,997
We won't fuck it up.

817
00:50:37,122 --> 00:50:39,654
Because this town
might be full of crazy rednecks

818
00:50:40,106 --> 00:50:41,306
and dumbasses,

819
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,619
but they're still Americans.

820
00:50:45,945 --> 00:50:47,829
And that used to mean something.

821
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:49,371
It still does.

822
00:51:01,214 --> 00:51:02,214
Shotgun.

823
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,853
Bandoleer.

824
00:51:12,356 --> 00:51:13,356
Let's go.

825
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:38,637
Funny thing is,

826
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,713
I've always hated blood.

827
00:51:41,078 --> 00:51:44,202
Yeah, I never wanted to be
a coroner or a undertaker.

828
00:51:44,327 --> 00:51:46,815
I wanted to be a DJ

829
00:51:47,622 --> 00:51:48,950
or a boat captain.

830
00:51:49,075 --> 00:51:51,280
Mike, enough with the foreplay.
Let's just...

831
00:51:51,405 --> 00:51:53,155
Let's just do it already.

832
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:56,018
On one condition.

833
00:51:56,143 --> 00:51:57,581
I have to be on top.

834
00:51:57,775 --> 00:51:58,775
Fine by me.

835
00:51:59,207 --> 00:52:00,694
That's better for my back, anyway.

836
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:14,366
I want me some of that.

837
00:52:14,895 --> 00:52:17,850
Show me how you can
shake your moneymaker.

838
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:21,756
That's it.

839
00:52:38,501 --> 00:52:39,357
Too much?

840
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:43,988
Way too much.

841
00:52:53,789 --> 00:52:55,239
What are you doing?

842
00:52:55,592 --> 00:52:57,041
Tear it up. It's paid for.

843
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,370
That's Gran's!

844
00:53:00,495 --> 00:53:02,345
No, I need it for the nest.

845
00:53:27,339 --> 00:53:28,615
Where you been at?

846
00:53:29,643 --> 00:53:31,075
I was looking for you.
