1
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,482
<i>Holy shit.</i>

2
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>V.</i>

3
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,238
Stay back, Sookie.
Don't shoot him.

4
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:33,407
- He knows.
- He knows what?

5
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,202
- Who do you work for?
- Give me a taste, fucker. Come on.

6
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:38,579
Who sent you?

7
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,777
I can't talk.

8
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:00,514
For the last time:

9
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,414
Who is your master?

10
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:06,242
<i>Think you can mad-dog me,
you fucking fanger?</i>

11
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,234
<i>You got nothing on Jackson.</i>

12
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,168
If I tell you,
I'm as dead as you are.

13
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:14,432
You might as well kill me now.

14
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:20,629
As you wish.

15
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,940
I got your rug all wet. Heh.

16
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:26,205
Lorena. Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.

17
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,708
I'm fine.
I'll heal in a minute.

18
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:32,419
The Celtic tapestry was a gift

19
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:36,022
from the lord of Glyndyfrdwy
in 1387.

20
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:37,967
We'll find a way to clean it up.

21
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,359
Or we'll put a planter
or two in front of it

22
00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:43,973
and we'll hide the burn marks.

23
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:48,225
It's like Armageddon in here
anytime someone chips a dessert glass.

24
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:52,523
Okay, now if everyone could please
leave me alone with Mr. Compton.

25
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,068
We could all use a moment to let...

26
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,331
cooler heads prevail.

27
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:07,048
This may be difficult
for a Louisianan to understand,

28
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:09,631
but in the kingdom of Mississippi,

29
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:13,918
our appetite for unprovoked
violence is... nil.

30
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:18,299
Fangs.

31
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:24,474
It was Miss Krasiki
who recommended you.

32
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:27,627
If we are to be working together,

33
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:29,393
I suggest you learn to get along.

34
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,578
- You do Lorena's bidding now?
- That's what she thinks.

35
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,734
But given your privileged
standing with Queen Sophie Anne

36
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,732
I'd rather have you for my own.

37
00:04:45,604 --> 00:04:47,804
Whatever lies Lorena has told you,

38
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:51,143
she has motives of her own.

39
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,657
I am well aware.

40
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,631
She really is quite unsophisticated
for someone so old.

41
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:02,199
Do you know that she wanted me
to make you watch

42
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,514
while she killed your human?

43
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:09,035
And speaking of,

44
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:11,435
vampire to vampire...

45
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:16,315
how much do you really love
that human of yours?

46
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,212
Why not turn her,

47
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:24,310
as I turned Talbot centuries ago?

48
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:27,014
Spend eternity together.

49
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:31,617
That's a commitment.

50
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:38,005
That is impossible.

51
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:41,056
The alternative is to subject her

52
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:43,682
to the vicissitudes of mortality

53
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,515
and to the mercy of forces,
such as...

54
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,120
for instance, me.

55
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:55,562
Your Majesty, that is no choice.

56
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,860
Of course it is.

57
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:01,694
Is it your human's welfare

58
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
you value

59
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,072
or your own desire?

60
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:07,323
You are a fraction of my age.

61
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:08,901
One day you'll see

62
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:11,537
you can't have both.

63
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:19,186
We're all a little frazzled

64
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,254
by the worries of the day.

65
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,433
Why don't you...

66
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,915
sleep on it?

67
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:47,078
Fresh graves are ideal for
disposing of an unwanted body.

68
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:51,136
The ground's already disturbed,
so no one would think to dig again.

69
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:54,364
So much for keeping him alive
so we could question him.

70
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,540
- That's what I was planning.
- But then you saw his brand.

71
00:07:00,132 --> 00:07:01,932
Brings back many memories.

72
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:03,756
Unpleasant ones.

73
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,399
If you'd given me a chance
to listen to his thoughts...

74
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:09,261
You have no concept
of how dangerous werewolves are.

75
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,472
They're virtually silent.
They have no fear of death.

76
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:15,267
When they've had a bit of our blood,
their strength can be a challenge.

77
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,810
Even for me.

78
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,740
Like I said,

79
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,885
thanks for saving my life.

80
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:33,664
How's your bullet wound?

81
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,549
It would have healed
a lot faster if you had...

82
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:38,824
I will never fall for that again.

83
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:43,857
Maybe the next time you shoot me.

84
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,298
I'll walk you back.

85
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,602
Do you know anyone named Jackson?
It's the only thing I could make out.

86
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:02,588
Maybe that's the person
he's working for.

87
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:04,513
Jackson is where he lives.

88
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,678
He had a Mississippi accent.

89
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:11,714
- Can't you people tell the difference?
- Oh, my God, he's from Jackson?

90
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:14,153
Do you think that's where Bill is?

91
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:16,036
We have to go, like yesterday.

92
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:17,707
I can't.

93
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:20,082
Not yet.

94
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:24,128
The problems of the world consist
of more than finding your boyfriend.

95
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:28,257
You shouldn't go by yourself, either.
These werewolves are looking for you.

96
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,051
You're no good to Bill
or to me if you're dead.

97
00:08:31,557 --> 00:08:34,173
How can you expect me to sit around
when we have a lead?

98
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,392
It'll be morning by the time
you get to Jackson.

99
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,875
If you're planning on rescuing
a vampire during daylight

100
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,811
I have overestimated
your intelligence.

101
00:08:42,503 --> 00:08:43,981
Take the day to think it over.

102
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,130
Fine.

103
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:46,630
I'll leave tomorrow.

104
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:48,986
But I have to go.
Bill would do it for me.

105
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,198
I don't expect you to understand.

106
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:56,931
I understand very well.

107
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:03,116
If I do get
into some kind of trouble,

108
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:05,202
you'll feel it, right?

109
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,006
How fast can you get to Mississippi?

110
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,417
Probably not fast enough.

111
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:14,856
Stay out of trouble,
Miss Stackhouse.

112
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:16,555
It'll do us both a favor.

113
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,211
Go ahead. Bite me.

114
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,778
Go on, fucking do it.

115
00:10:17,102 --> 00:10:19,034
What the hell?
I said you could bite me.

116
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:21,536
Why not?

117
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:23,623
Because you want me to.

118
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:33,061
<i>Here we go.</i>

119
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:36,250
<i>Final table at Festa al Lago
about to get under way.</i>

120
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,679
<i>We started five days ago
with 368 players.</i>

121
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,227
Hey there.

122
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:49,106
Wasn't expecting company.

123
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,859
- Tommy said you split.
- He told you that?

124
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:56,714
He must have misheard.

125
00:10:57,128 --> 00:10:59,783
I'm not the kind to skip out
on his own blood kin.

126
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:01,326
Course you ain't.

127
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,120
Hey, Lindy. Sam's back.

128
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,060
I'll go get her.

129
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:07,185
Mama?

130
00:11:09,848 --> 00:11:12,632
I don't appreciate you
trying to get me killed.

131
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:14,692
I don't appreciate you
coming into my house

132
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:16,367
like you belong here.

133
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,839
I figured since we're related,
you could keep up, but...

134
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:26,588
How the hell should I know?
We never have guests.

135
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:27,936
Pull them off the bed.

136
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:30,994
Hold on, hold on, now.

137
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,484
I came over to say goodbye.
I wasn't gonna stay the night.

138
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,111
We ain't letting you
spend your money on no motel.

139
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,740
Mama, if he wants
to stay in a motel, let him.

140
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:43,142
- No, I gotta get back to Bon Temps.
- At this time of night?

141
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,268
I got my life back there
just like you got yours here.

142
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:50,459
I don't wanna intrude
any more than I already have.

143
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:54,542
Joe Lee, down the sink.

144
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:56,506
Dadgum, I just cracked it open.

145
00:11:56,706 --> 00:11:58,257
Down the sink. Jesus H.

146
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,385
You ain't seen your son
in over 30 years,

147
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,641
and you can't cork it for one night?

148
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:06,082
- We ain't alcoholics.
- Don't ever get married, Sam.

149
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,517
The second you do,
that's when they start to woman you.

150
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,396
I know it may not look like it,
but we are just so, so proud of you,

151
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:14,453
and what all you done with yourself.

152
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:18,402
I just wish we were the kind of people
that could make you proud of us.

153
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:21,762
All right, listen.
Stop worrying about what I think.

154
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:23,408
Start with them.

155
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:31,416
Now, come on.
Take care of your mama.

156
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:34,461
All right.
Lindy, come on.

157
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,921
We'll see each other again.

158
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,840
You best get going
before she climbs in the trunk with you.

159
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:42,676
You forgot these.

160
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,443
You must have dropped them
when you were changing...

161
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,682
the oil.

162
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,771
You?

163
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:54,773
A cop?

164
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,438
I wish you were there.

165
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:59,217
Tonight, boom,

166
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,696
the universe showed me my destiny.

167
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:03,073
And for me,

168
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,978
that's to protect and serve
the citizens of Renard Parish.

169
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,704
Police work just ain't about
tackling people.

170
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,623
There's marksmanship,
paramilitary training.

171
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,550
I got all that now.

172
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:20,006
And let's face it, would you feel safe
with me patrolling the streets or Andy?

173
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,860
That's what I thought.

174
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:25,930
That's what I thought.

175
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,557
Oh, my God.

176
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,066
What the hell just happened?

177
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:37,112
You lost yourself to the void.

178
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,261
I'd claim it was a gift,

179
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:46,110
but actually,
it's common to most vampires.

180
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:48,779
I never do this.

181
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:50,953
What, one-night stands?

182
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,820
Cheap motels?

183
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:56,796
Vampires?

184
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,825
None of it.
No offense.

185
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,923
Actually, the cheap motel, yes.

186
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:03,248
But only once.

187
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:07,559
Come to think of it,
why do you need a motel room?

188
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,307
Don't y'all sleep in the ground?

189
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:13,424
It's nice to have a place to shower,

190
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:14,549
shave,

191
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:16,925
and ravage you.

192
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:21,195
Fuck.

193
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,155
Did this all happen
because we beat the crap

194
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,871
out of a couple rednecks tonight?

195
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,366
You did.

196
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,050
You would've killed them
if I hadn't have stopped you.

197
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:33,178
Wanted to.

198
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:36,180
Where does all that come from?

199
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:39,855
You don't wanna poke that.

200
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,181
I'm entitled to a little bit
of curiosity.

201
00:14:42,306 --> 00:14:44,406
I hardly know a thing about you.

202
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,923
I don't know if you have
a husband or a boyfriend.

203
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,226
This was great and all...
Okay, mind-blowing.

204
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:57,646
But let's not make it
into something that it wasn't.

205
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:00,482
Just take me home.

206
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,062
Can I at least ask your name?

207
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:05,648
Even better, I-I'll walk.

208
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:08,383
My name is Franklin.

209
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,101
Please give it up.

210
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,244
Knowing my name isn't gonna make
you feel any less dirty,

211
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:14,852
or me any less...

212
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:41,273
Fangtasia.
This better be good.

213
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:43,775
Pam, it's Jessica Hamby.

214
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,763
<i>We talked yesterday.
I'm the one who...</i>

215
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:47,862
I remember you perfectly.
What is it?

216
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:52,257
I really desperately need your help.
I don't know where Bill is,

217
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:54,911
and, gosh, you guys are
the only other vampires I know...

218
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,511
Spit it out, cupcake.
I'm in the middle of something.

219
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,708
Right.

220
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,702
You remember how I was asking
how you would...?

221
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:05,895
You know, what you would do if you,

222
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:08,299
like, killed somebody by accident?

223
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:11,069
Did you call the hypothetical
hardware store

224
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:13,282
and buy a theoretical chain saw?

225
00:16:14,665 --> 00:16:18,204
And that's just the problem.
I went to get the chain saw, and now...

226
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,103
he's gone.

227
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:21,903
What?

228
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,024
I left for 15 min
and he disappeared.

229
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,062
The problem you have
is that there is

230
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,037
no dead body in your house?

231
00:16:32,985 --> 00:16:35,300
Doesn't sound like a problem to me.
Gotta run.

232
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,376
Babies, they're all the same.

233
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:38,411
Now,

234
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,007
where were we?
Oh, right.

235
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:44,757
Lie back, sweetheart,
and think of Estonia.

236
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:55,598
- Oh, my God, you have a brother?
- Yeah. News to me too.

237
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,490
What are they like?

238
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,446
I'm more at home
with the folks here.

239
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:04,147
Speaking of which,
you heard about the...?

240
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,742
Jesus Christ.

241
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:10,457
- And Andy shot him?
- Welcome back, huh?

242
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:14,140
Good thing this town
doesn't have many other bar options.

243
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:17,605
So how long should I expect you
gone for this time?

244
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,579
Two, maybe three days at the most.

245
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,669
If I leave by 4,
I can get there by sundown.

246
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:25,358
Sam, how can you expect me
to stay here and do nothing

247
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:27,379
when Bill might be in Jackson?

248
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,215
- You know me.
- I know you well enough not to argue.

249
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,047
- You need anyone to...?
- If you really wanna help,

250
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:36,512
I'm kind of leaving Jessica here
on her own while I'm gone.

251
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:40,475
Do you think you could make sure
she doesn't do anything horrible?

252
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:43,603
- How?
- I don't know. Give her a job?

253
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:45,798
Just kidding.

254
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,650
Can you imagine? Arlene would freak.

255
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:51,193
You don't get back,
she's getting your job.

256
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:52,843
I'll be fine.

257
00:17:55,146 --> 00:17:56,074
Nice ring.

258
00:17:58,148 --> 00:17:58,993
Thanks.

259
00:18:01,418 --> 00:18:03,366
What is the rank between
a sergeant and a captain

260
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:05,366
in the Louisiana State Police?

261
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:06,491
Skip.

262
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:10,366
The legal blood-alcohol limit
in the state of Louisiana is?

263
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,520
When you're drunk?

264
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:16,244
Next one.

265
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,017
Jessica says it's too late
for us to be together.

266
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:22,463
What do you think she means by that?

267
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:24,519
- That's on the test?
- No, I'm asking you.

268
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:27,991
Come on, man. Not now.

269
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,525
You're quizzing me.
I'm in the zone.

270
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,267
You're 0 for 22.
At least this you could help me with.

271
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:34,612
All right, listen.

272
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:37,438
I've heard every breakup excuse from

273
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:41,235
"You're a son of a bitch, Stackhouse"
to "You're a fucking asshole, Jason."

274
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:44,578
And you know what?
They're all saying the same thing.

275
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:47,967
They can't handle
the heat you're packing.

276
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:51,463
So Jessica is having trouble
handling my heat?

277
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,290
The only thing to do
is to move on to someone who can.

278
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,635
That's why every girlfriend I've had
has been hotter than the last.

279
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:01,756
I don't know how I'll find
someone better than Jessica.

280
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:04,212
Man, there are two kinds
of people in this world:

281
00:19:04,337 --> 00:19:06,087
people who got no dreams,

282
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:08,945
people who got dreams
and don't do nothing about it,

283
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,538
and people who go out
and fulfill their dreams.

284
00:19:11,663 --> 00:19:14,571
I'm the third kind.
So you gonna help me out or not?

285
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:18,370
I'm trying to help you, but the website
says you have to pass the written exam.

286
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,160
You think Andy Bellefleur
knows half of this shit?

287
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:24,078
There's gotta be an easier way.

288
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:26,472
I'm ready now.

289
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:28,069
You know?

290
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,076
I know between good and evil.

291
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:35,173
I'm like a ninja-level marksman.
I got all the training I need.

292
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:37,452
You wanna know
the blood-alcohol limit is?

293
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:38,826
I don't need to know it.

294
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:41,515
If it's on the sample test,
it's not on the real thing.

295
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,190
Everybody knows that.

296
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:46,684
Him and me,
we haven't even talked about kids,

297
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:50,980
but, well, maybe this is the good Lord
telling me that this man's a keeper.

298
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,052
I mean, Don't you think?
Children being a blessing and all.

299
00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:56,721
Pardon, dear.
Need to adjust the probe.

300
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,572
That's better.

301
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,745
There's the critter, see?

302
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,953
That's my baby?

303
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:07,241
It ain't much more
than a head and a heart,

304
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:09,616
but that's all you need, don't you?

305
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:15,088
This one a bit of a surprise?

306
00:20:15,727 --> 00:20:17,127
A little, I guess.

307
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:20,927
My boyfriend and me,
we haven't been together for very long.

308
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,650
At least two, three months
by the looks of it.

309
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,970
Excuse me?

310
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:28,893
Twenty-five millimeters
from crown to rump.

311
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,811
I'd say
the tadpole's at least nine weeks on.

312
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,898
Nine weeks? Are you sure?

313
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Maybe ten.

314
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:44,733
Phone! I'm wiping.

315
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:45,951
I'm frying!

316
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:51,733
Merlotte's, this is Tara.

317
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,751
<i>I'm glad.</i>

318
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,045
It's Mike Spencer.
How are you?

319
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:58,077
I'm at work.

320
00:20:58,202 --> 00:20:59,173
How are you?

321
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:01,642
Same old.

322
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,269
<i>I don't know if you heard.</i>

323
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:08,349
The Talley funeral's today.

324
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
The what?

325
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:11,644
Eggs.

326
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:13,813
<i>We're at the cemetery.
You might wanna...</i>

327
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:15,356
come over, say goodbye.

328
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,642
Thanks, Mike.

329
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:19,828
I'm leaving now.

330
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:21,733
Don't start without me.

331
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:30,121
Where is everyone?

332
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:32,328
Just us.

333
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:36,002
He didn't have any people,
as far as I could find.

334
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,753
Didn't know who else to call.

335
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,755
I'm not blaming you.

336
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:42,391
It's just at a funeral,

337
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:44,719
you expect, you know, people.

338
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,180
Loved ones.

339
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:48,556
Well, you're here.

340
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,433
If I'm the only one, who paid?

341
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,101
I did.

342
00:21:54,854 --> 00:21:56,875
I understand
if you don't want me here,

343
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,442
but I thought
Eggs deserved a real funeral.

344
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:02,911
Come on.

345
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,786
The casket's nice.

346
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:11,643
You didn't have to.

347
00:22:13,522 --> 00:22:15,888
None of this makes me feel better
about anything.

348
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,435
But maybe it might help you.

349
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:20,689
It doesn't.

350
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:24,238
I know you mean well.
You always have.

351
00:22:25,228 --> 00:22:27,626
But there ain't anything
anyone can do right now.

352
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:32,075
At least you got somewhere
to come see him now.

353
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,780
Might not seem like much,

354
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:38,188
but I like having a place to go
when I wanna see Gran.

355
00:22:38,612 --> 00:22:41,081
Every time I visit her,
it hurts a little bit less.

356
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,554
Will you come back home?

357
00:22:47,874 --> 00:22:49,921
It's okay
if you're still angry with me.

358
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,954
I'll be in Jackson for a couple days.
I got a lead on Bill.

359
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:55,733
You can have the house to yourself.

360
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,110
Lafayette's making me so crazy
I wanna eat the wallpaper.

361
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,652
I think this is everybody.

362
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:10,930
Friends, we have gathered

363
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,898
to pay our final respects
to Benedict Talley.

364
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,956
Your presence here assures
that his memory will not be forgotten,

365
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:21,439
as Christ assures
that his soul will not be forsaken.

366
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:24,532
Let us pray that he will find
eternal peace and comfort

367
00:23:24,657 --> 00:23:26,357
in the arms of our Lord.

368
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,640
Who's there?

369
00:24:23,017 --> 00:24:24,337
Good God in heaven.

370
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,422
Caroline, my dearest.

371
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:28,226
The war ended...

372
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,217
three years ago.

373
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,720
I was sure you had perished.

374
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:37,934
I'm home now.

375
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,562
I haven't slept an hour
since you left.

376
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:52,946
I prayed for you.

377
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:55,451
I pleaded with God for your return.

378
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:00,039
Especially in these last few days.

379
00:25:01,111 --> 00:25:01,999
Is it Sarah?

380
00:25:04,643 --> 00:25:05,378
Thomas?

381
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:08,131
Both?

382
00:25:15,632 --> 00:25:16,389
Come.

383
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,989
I sent Sarah away to Tennessee.

384
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:37,441
He was too young.

385
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:40,705
I tried to protect him.

386
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,757
You did all anyone could.

387
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:48,283
I heard many children were taken.

388
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,564
I feared the worst.

389
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:53,217
No one will come for him.

390
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:56,345
Undertakers won't touch
anyone with the pox.

391
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,308
I resolved
to bury him myself tomorrow.

392
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,131
It's your papa.

393
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,319
I've come to see you off.

394
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,313
You're as cold as the earth.

395
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:34,800
Do not be afraid.

396
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,011
Are you afflicted?

397
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:39,805
I am.

398
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:41,617
I was...

399
00:26:43,695 --> 00:26:45,825
My human life was taken from me.

400
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:50,316
Are you a ghost?

401
00:26:50,852 --> 00:26:52,869
I am here to bury our son.

402
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:56,190
I cannot be infected.

403
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,598
What are you?

404
00:26:58,633 --> 00:26:59,783
What are you?

405
00:27:01,415 --> 00:27:02,765
Demon? The devil?

406
00:27:03,837 --> 00:27:05,039
You've taken my husband.

407
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,958
I will not let you take my son.

408
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,194
Caroline, no. Listen.

409
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,670
Stay back!

410
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:33,359
This is your doing, I assume?

411
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:34,811
Unhand her.

412
00:27:36,004 --> 00:27:37,412
She is my wife.

413
00:27:39,854 --> 00:27:42,827
In her condition,
she's hardly more human than animal.

414
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:46,080
Except for her blood, of course.

415
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:49,943
I will die
before I allow you to harm her.

416
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:00,515
Look at me.

417
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:06,361
Look at me.

418
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:12,504
Kill me!
I can't bear this anymore!

419
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,026
Do what you will...

420
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,319
with my body. My soul will be safe.

421
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,758
Darling.

422
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:46,133
Darling Caroline.

423
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:53,059
I'm so sorry
to have to do this to you.

424
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:39,360
Can I help you, son?

425
00:29:43,071 --> 00:29:46,224
Can I get another test paper?
There's something wrong with this one.

426
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:49,328
I'd say
there's something wrong with you.

427
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,855
Wake the fuck up.

428
00:30:02,187 --> 00:30:03,145
What's up?

429
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,762
I was just getting my gloves.

430
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,851
I need your authorization
on this PWE form

431
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:08,931
before we, us, over yonder working,

432
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:12,159
can do the other side of the road,
supervisor.

433
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,161
I know what you're thinking.

434
00:30:16,593 --> 00:30:18,829
But I got a lot on my mind lately.

435
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,267
That must feel new.

436
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:25,114
Try spending every waking moment
mopping up your cousin's tears

437
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:27,575
and keeping her away
from pointy objects.

438
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,452
See how much sleep you get then.

439
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,661
Holy shit.

440
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,248
Anybody! Help!

441
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,710
- Help!
- I'm coming.

442
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,570
It's...

443
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:41,964
It's dead.

444
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:45,259
- Got no head.
- It's got no head, man.

445
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,212
<i>That must be her.
Said blond and pretty.</i>

446
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,937
<i>No wonder
the girl's a magnet for trouble.</i>

447
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:17,523
Hold on.

448
00:31:17,648 --> 00:31:20,085
- Get your hands off me!
- I ain't trying to hurt you.

449
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,004
You're a werewolf.
I've had vampire blood.

450
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:24,087
- I'll kick your ass.
- Listen.

451
00:31:24,212 --> 00:31:26,400
Eric Northman's the one who sent me.

452
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:28,325
My name's Alcide Herveaux.

453
00:31:28,461 --> 00:31:30,012
I'm here to look after you.

454
00:31:34,104 --> 00:31:35,607
Holy crap.

455
00:31:35,732 --> 00:31:37,061
Look at this layout.

456
00:31:40,011 --> 00:31:41,311
What's going on?

457
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,108
This all yours?

458
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:46,820
Something the matter or...?

459
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:51,283
After you left, we just got to wondering
what kind of life you got down here.

460
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:55,579
We figured we ain't got nothing else
to do today, let's go see for ourselves.

461
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,831
Didn't have to do much looking around
to find you.

462
00:31:58,382 --> 00:31:59,870
Never thought any son of mine

463
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,502
would have a place like this.

464
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,713
I thought we agreed...

465
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:07,298
Agreed to wait a piece,

466
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:09,927
before getting back together again.

467
00:32:10,348 --> 00:32:11,929
Ain't you happy to see us?

468
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:14,848
I didn't say that.

469
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,352
I just don't do well with surprises.

470
00:32:18,587 --> 00:32:20,585
Mama, he doesn't want us here.

471
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,574
That's not true.

472
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:27,840
Y'all...

473
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:29,780
Y'all came all this way,

474
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:31,898
and I'm buying you lunch.

475
00:32:32,023 --> 00:32:33,773
- All right?
- All right!

476
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:35,911
Whatever you want.

477
00:32:37,585 --> 00:32:39,650
Always dreamed
f having my own chicken shack.

478
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:42,001
I would call it
Mickens' Chicken and Chitlins.

479
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,752
That'll happen.

480
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,758
Mr. Fortenberry states
he was clearing the ditch to replace

481
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,087
a drainage pipe
when he located the victim.

482
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:54,261
The head and hands are missing,
but there's no blood,

483
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:56,432
so he probably bled out
before being brought here.

484
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,477
Muscle tissue shows
signs of tearing rather than cutting,

485
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,231
so it looks like our unsub
just tore his head clean off.

486
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,900
Only thing I know can do
that's a vampire.

487
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:08,902
That would explain
why there's no blood.

488
00:33:10,845 --> 00:33:11,572
I quit.

489
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,200
Bud, wait up.

490
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,668
Where you going?

491
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,964
Did you hear me?

492
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:20,080
I quit.

493
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:21,749
I've had it with this.

494
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:25,419
Every time we clear one murder,
two more spring up. It's like crabgrass.

495
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:27,421
We need you to sign the report.

496
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,649
You sign it.

497
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,328
Or you. I don't care.

498
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,217
Take this crap.

499
00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:33,898
All of it.

500
00:33:36,627 --> 00:33:39,777
Forty-three years
and what have I got to show for it?

501
00:33:40,213 --> 00:33:42,811
Gaps in my brain
and polyps in my ass.

502
00:33:43,963 --> 00:33:46,226
I don't need this horseshit!

503
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,967
The house is in no shape for guests,
I know.

504
00:33:54,578 --> 00:33:56,825
It's a long story.
I'll tell you about it in the car.

505
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,836
<i>I hear you read minds.</i>

506
00:33:58,961 --> 00:33:59,961
<i>That true?</i>

507
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:01,463
Yes, it is.

508
00:34:01,714 --> 00:34:03,200
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

509
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,752
<i>So we could have a whole conversation
with me sitting here clamped shut?</i>

510
00:34:08,198 --> 00:34:10,310
It's kind of rude
with just the two of us,

511
00:34:10,435 --> 00:34:12,813
but in a room full of strangers,
it might come in handy.

512
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:15,135
I'll keep that in mind.

513
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:18,968
What I don't understand is...

514
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:21,668
if you had
Eric Northman's blood and all,

515
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,394
why he can't look after you?

516
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:25,134
It's not like that.

517
00:34:25,746 --> 00:34:27,272
I'm not his.

518
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:30,635
How'd he rope you
into taking me to Jackson?

519
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,860
My old man,

520
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:34,746
he's got a construction company
in Caddo Parish.

521
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:37,171
Came up a little short on a project.

522
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:38,784
Went to Northman for a loan.

523
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:40,828
Wouldn't be my first choice.

524
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,477
You take what you can get.

525
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:45,249
Only reason I'm here
is to help him get out of debt.

526
00:34:45,855 --> 00:34:47,334
I don't do favors for vamps.

527
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:50,293
Plus,
I know the pack is sniffing around.

528
00:34:50,584 --> 00:34:52,256
You ain't getting nowhere
without an in.

529
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,748
Are you friends with them?

530
00:34:53,873 --> 00:34:56,223
I wouldn't
call them friends exactly.

531
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,722
My ex is banging their leader.

532
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:02,850
Sorry.

533
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:06,322
That pack is a cancer to our kind.

534
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:09,861
Weres have lived in Jackson
for almost 200 years

535
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:11,685
without a single human knowing it.

536
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,246
Now these sons of bitches come to town,
there's a crime streak a mile wide.

537
00:35:15,371 --> 00:35:18,036
Not to say the rest of us
are above violence,

538
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:19,908
but you shut the barn door
behind you.

539
00:35:20,183 --> 00:35:22,983
One of them came after me
last night, in here.

540
00:35:24,215 --> 00:35:25,611
Northman mentioned that.

541
00:35:26,185 --> 00:35:27,780
Looks like a hell of a fight.

542
00:35:28,988 --> 00:35:30,669
You gonna be ready for more of that?

543
00:35:31,116 --> 00:35:33,266
They took someone I love from me.

544
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,592
I don't know about you,
but I was raised to fight back.

545
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,199
Great.

546
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:40,596
You'll get us both killed.

547
00:35:41,568 --> 00:35:42,868
I'll pack light.

548
00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:55,194
What is she?

549
00:35:55,817 --> 00:35:57,017
Is she your...

550
00:35:57,714 --> 00:35:58,906
Your wife?

551
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:02,625
She is not.

552
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:05,294
Will she kill me?

553
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,033
I will not allow her to hurt you.

554
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:13,870
You've hurt her enough
for two lifetimes, William.

555
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,322
I warned you.

556
00:36:15,821 --> 00:36:18,308
There's our world and theirs.

557
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,972
Between lies only suffering.

558
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,097
If you can kill me...

559
00:36:26,668 --> 00:36:28,560
I beg you, do it now.

560
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:36,785
Make her forget.

561
00:36:38,507 --> 00:36:39,507
Go on.

562
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,200
You brought this upon her.
You must undo it.

563
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:54,819
We can never be together.

564
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,108
I was never here.

565
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:08,985
Goodbye, young Thomas.

566
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:14,783
The only way
to show your love for a human...

567
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:16,746
is to stay away.

568
00:37:19,087 --> 00:37:20,087
Forever.

569
00:37:23,861 --> 00:37:25,461
Do you understand now?

570
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:03,587
Johnson's my best goddamn man.

571
00:38:03,712 --> 00:38:05,616
They're all dumber
than a box of rocks.

572
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,576
Sir, that's unfair.

573
00:38:07,775 --> 00:38:09,870
To boxes maybe.

574
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,554
- Or rocks.
- Talbot, dear,

575
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,375
we forgot
to offer Cooter a refreshment.

576
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,461
Could you?

577
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:17,650
Of course.

578
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,133
Zima, correct?

579
00:38:26,212 --> 00:38:27,930
Sir, it's been 24 hours,

580
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,202
and still no sign of him
or the waitress.

581
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,719
Can your pack of imbeciles
do nothing right?

582
00:38:35,086 --> 00:38:36,436
Somebody got him.

583
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:38,087
Eric Northman.

584
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:40,776
Who?

585
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,547
He's a sheriff under Sophie Anne.

586
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:45,906
He has a perverse
interest in that waitress.

587
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:47,991
I'm sure
he's been watching over her.

588
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,548
Good day's rest?

589
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,334
I've considered your offer.

590
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,224
My service to Queen Sophie Anne

591
00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:04,633
has brought only suffering to me

592
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:08,408
and the humans
that I have lived amongst.

593
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:10,847
I recognize that now.

594
00:39:11,737 --> 00:39:13,037
For their safety

595
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,435
and also for mine...

596
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,649
I hereby renounce

597
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,235
my fealty
to the kingdom of Louisiana...

598
00:39:25,883 --> 00:39:28,926
and I humbly pledge my loyalty
to Your Majesty.

599
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:32,452
Wonderful.

600
00:39:34,353 --> 00:39:35,288
Wonderful.

601
00:39:37,944 --> 00:39:39,543
We don't need the girl after all.

602
00:39:40,563 --> 00:39:42,290
You're letting her go?

603
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,756
But you gave me your word.

604
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,966
I have.

605
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,719
To Mr. Compton.

606
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,723
And I intend to keep it.

607
00:40:06,898 --> 00:40:08,739
It's good to see you
working and all.

608
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,518
- It's my job.
- No, I know.

609
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:14,244
It's just, you know,
after everything...

610
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:17,289
it's good to see you're okay.

611
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:18,832
I mean, you seem okay.

612
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,500
Are you okay?

613
00:40:21,134 --> 00:40:22,587
I'm getting there.

614
00:40:23,434 --> 00:40:24,784
Little by little.

615
00:40:26,497 --> 00:40:28,800
You know,
I lost a lot of people I love too.

616
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:30,330
Loved a lot.

617
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,386
And if you ever wanna...

618
00:40:32,594 --> 00:40:34,765
talk or whatever...

619
00:40:37,427 --> 00:40:39,786
Because you and Sookie
are like sisters,

620
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:41,611
and Sookie is my sister,

621
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,441
so we're like family.

622
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,527
Even though we ain't been
that close lately.

623
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:51,957
You're a good friend.

624
00:40:54,522 --> 00:40:56,286
Could be better.
I should be there for you.

625
00:40:57,305 --> 00:40:58,914
Wish I had you there that night.

626
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:00,826
Yeah, but I wasn't there.

627
00:41:02,065 --> 00:41:03,386
I mean, the...

628
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:05,605
I'm sorry I wasn't there,

629
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,172
and I'm sorry it happened.

630
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,508
Jason, what's with you?
You didn't do anything.

631
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,682
You know what?
I shouldn't beat myself up over it.

632
00:41:17,969 --> 00:41:20,021
If you need me,
I'm gonna be over here.

633
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,911
God... This motherfucker.

634
00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:41,623
Hello, sweetheart.

635
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:46,503
Hop in.

636
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,226
Listen.
Listen, I moved what I could.

637
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:58,014
I mean, even at half off,
the shit is still expensive.

638
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,119
I'm gonna need some more time.
Relax.

639
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:03,353
You'll ruin your new ride.

640
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,607
Pam's been a bit harsh lately.

641
00:42:08,144 --> 00:42:10,194
She's under a lot of pressure.

642
00:42:10,388 --> 00:42:14,114
I thought it would be a good time
for a small gift to my top salesman.

643
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:15,824
What's the catch?

644
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:18,994
You'll have to pay the insurance.
I'm not an idiot.

645
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:21,746
And I'm gonna have
to sell you the car for $1

646
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,183
to avoid that pesky gift tax.

647
00:42:29,777 --> 00:42:33,133
Mind you, it may look a little
out of place parked outside of that...

648
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:36,052
strange plywood hut you live in.

649
00:42:36,566 --> 00:42:38,847
No, I ain't taking
on no more of your shit.

650
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,299
You have great value, Lafayette.

651
00:42:44,023 --> 00:42:46,210
You're discreet, efficient,

652
00:42:46,955 --> 00:42:49,223
and you have a network
of loyal customers

653
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,186
with enormous disposable income.

654
00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:53,695
You could become quite wealthy
if you wanted to.

655
00:42:55,441 --> 00:42:57,032
I don't need no more money.

656
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,427
I never thought of you
as lacking in ambition.

657
00:43:04,552 --> 00:43:06,860
But perhaps you're content
with moth-eaten afghans

658
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:08,752
and secondhand furniture.

659
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,840
I'll think about it.

660
00:43:15,221 --> 00:43:16,760
Don't make me wait too long.

661
00:43:19,528 --> 00:43:21,166
You can owe me the dollar.

662
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,812
Spit it out.
You're breaking up.

663
00:43:29,784 --> 00:43:30,899
No, it's not...

664
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,067
- It's not...
- "It's not you, it's me."

665
00:43:34,192 --> 00:43:36,213
If I had a nickel for every time...

666
00:43:36,843 --> 00:43:38,031
I'd have 15 cents.

667
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,199
No, it is me.

668
00:43:39,855 --> 00:43:40,855
It is.

669
00:43:42,063 --> 00:43:43,279
I'm...

670
00:43:44,183 --> 00:43:45,833
I got me a baby coming.

671
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,583
What?

672
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,044
And I didn't wanna
tell you because... Because it...

673
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,546
Oh, my God.

674
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,631
We're gonna have a baby?

675
00:43:56,321 --> 00:43:57,926
Yes, we are.
You're gonna be a daddy.

676
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,804
Only let's not tell anybody
just yet.

677
00:44:11,175 --> 00:44:13,691
I never dreamed in my life
I could be so happy.

678
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:15,944
Thank you for making my life
mean something.

679
00:44:20,221 --> 00:44:21,671
Thank you, darling.

680
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,619
How many has he had?

681
00:44:35,744 --> 00:44:37,465
The boy can hold his liquor.

682
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,466
Kill it.

683
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,593
Well, I don't care. He's underage.

684
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,886
I'm right here, dick.

685
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:45,432
He'll be 20 next April.
What's the difference?

686
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,726
It makes a big difference
if I lose my license.

687
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,160
What are you doing
feeding him shots anyhow?

688
00:44:52,005 --> 00:44:53,064
I've known my son

689
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,524
a lot longer than you have.

690
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,856
I suggest you don't tell me
how to raise him.

691
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,530
I suggest you follow the rules
in my bar.

692
00:45:02,805 --> 00:45:04,861
You talk to me like
I'm some kind of drunk.

693
00:45:04,986 --> 00:45:06,486
Well, you are drunk.

694
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,894
Dude, you throw a punch,
you are so one of us.

695
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:11,787
Okay, that's enough.

696
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:14,294
God almighty, y'all sure know
how to piss all over

697
00:45:14,419 --> 00:45:15,879
a perfectly fine reunion.

698
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,897
You should call it a night.

699
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,860
Come on.

700
00:45:24,705 --> 00:45:26,655
Don't take it personal, Sam.

701
00:45:27,638 --> 00:45:29,934
Joe Lee ain't got a bad bone
in him when he's sober.

702
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,194
We'll go.

703
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,189
I don't wanna embarrass ourselves
any more than we already have.

704
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:37,315
Just make sure they get home safe.

705
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,296
Get in the van, boys.

706
00:45:40,585 --> 00:45:42,447
- We'll see you soon?
- Sure.

707
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,680
Good evening, miss.

708
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,538
Are you home alone tonight?

709
00:46:10,663 --> 00:46:12,533
Listen, I don't know
what you have in mind,

710
00:46:12,658 --> 00:46:14,742
but you are messing
with the wrong girl.

711
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:23,178
Vampires can't enter a home
without an invitation.

712
00:46:23,303 --> 00:46:24,453
A human home.

713
00:46:24,578 --> 00:46:27,659
And the last human owner
of this house died a year ago.

714
00:46:28,257 --> 00:46:29,257
Fuck.

715
00:46:29,872 --> 00:46:31,788
How come nobody tells me
any of this?

716
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:35,139
Come, Miss Hamby, sit down.

717
00:46:35,825 --> 00:46:36,918
I just wanna talk.

718
00:46:38,646 --> 00:46:39,838
How do you know my name?

719
00:46:41,144 --> 00:46:42,244
It's my job.

720
00:46:43,452 --> 00:46:44,835
I find things.

721
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:47,137
Yeah, well, what sort of things?

722
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,139
Anything that needs finding.

723
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:53,560
Do you have anything like that?

724
00:46:58,728 --> 00:47:00,442
He owns this place.
He's been gone.

725
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,527
I can't even reach him on his phone.

726
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,147
Yes, him too, but...

727
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:07,031
I was thinking of somebody else.

728
00:47:08,605 --> 00:47:09,655
Think hard.

729
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:14,367
Has anyone else gone missing

730
00:47:15,142 --> 00:47:16,124
lately?

731
00:47:26,152 --> 00:47:27,880
Maybe this will jog your memory.

732
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,516
So you do know him.

733
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:40,440
It's a head.
How do you expect me to react?

734
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:41,487
Come on.

735
00:47:42,545 --> 00:47:43,342
Tell me.

736
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,305
Where'd you meet
this handsome devil?

737
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:47,238
Who broke the ice?
I'm guessing him.

738
00:47:47,954 --> 00:47:50,988
"You've sure got some
pretty lips, girlfriend."

739
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,703
Stop.

740
00:47:55,062 --> 00:47:56,039
Put it down.

741
00:47:59,246 --> 00:48:02,086
The important part is that
he's no longer a problem.

742
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,363
See?

743
00:48:03,687 --> 00:48:04,737
I help you,

744
00:48:05,698 --> 00:48:07,300
you help me a little

745
00:48:07,678 --> 00:48:08,728
in return.

746
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:10,678
Now...

747
00:48:11,811 --> 00:48:14,411
why don't you tell me
everything you know

748
00:48:14,912 --> 00:48:16,362
about Bill Compton?

749
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,250
Get back here!

750
00:49:46,454 --> 00:49:47,358
Shit!

751
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,915
Might not look like much,

752
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,132
but Lou Pine's,

753
00:50:04,257 --> 00:50:06,377
it's the oldest were bar
in Mississippi.

754
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:12,342
It's nice to see a face
from the old pack.

755
00:50:12,591 --> 00:50:15,450
I figured the new wolves
are drinking enough for all of us.

756
00:50:16,645 --> 00:50:17,984
Who's the civilian?

757
00:50:18,109 --> 00:50:19,159
She's cool.

758
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,026
She's a friend.

759
00:50:22,588 --> 00:50:24,272
Am I not dressed properly?

760
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,772
You look like dinner.

761
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,267
I'll keep an eye on her, Hollis.

762
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,249
Gonna have to split off.
See you with me, they ain't gonna talk.

763
00:50:45,547 --> 00:50:47,630
- Where are you gonna be?
- With my guys.

764
00:50:48,535 --> 00:50:49,891
I'll be watching you.

765
00:50:50,198 --> 00:50:52,772
You make it quick,
for your own sake.

766
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:07,750
Hey, boys.

767
00:51:08,785 --> 00:51:10,000
Oh, my God.

768
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:12,184
I am so stupid.

769
00:51:12,438 --> 00:51:13,861
I left my wallet in the car,

770
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,518
but I am parched.

771
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,699
Any of you guys mind
buying a girl a cosmo?

772
00:51:18,068 --> 00:51:19,367
You here alone, cream puff?

773
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,869
You are stupid.

774
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:25,129
I've been to much tougher places
than this.

775
00:51:25,254 --> 00:51:28,042
Any of you heard of a place
in Louisiana called Fangtasia?

776
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:29,746
You're a fangbanger?

777
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,422
There's nothing meaner
or stronger than a vampire.

778
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:34,674
What's not to like?

779
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,092
You'd be surprised.

780
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,344
<i>If you knew we kicked one
two days ago,</i>

781
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,608
<i>you'd be on your knees right quick.</i>

782
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:42,265
Why don't you tell me about it?

783
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,229
Let's talk in private.

784
00:51:48,945 --> 00:51:49,945
Sure.

785
00:51:50,296 --> 00:51:51,190
Why not?

786
00:52:03,477 --> 00:52:04,537
Me first or you?

787
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,664
You know a vampire?
Can you take me to him?

788
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,291
Like a three-way sort of deal?

789
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,369
- Where is he?
- Shut the fuck up.

790
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,628
I got more vampire blood in me
than you think.

791
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:15,548
Hey, asshole.

792
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,403
Goddamn!

793
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,907
I'll run out of bats
if he keeps this up.

794
00:52:41,337 --> 00:52:43,034
Now get him out of here.

795
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:44,327
Now!

796
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,716
Come on, man.
She ain't worth it.

797
00:52:59,816 --> 00:53:01,886
I barely even know her.
I mean Debbie.

798
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:04,680
What about Debbie?

799
00:53:05,673 --> 00:53:06,599
Oh, shit.

800
00:53:09,263 --> 00:53:10,937
Debbie's getting engaged to Coot.

801
00:53:13,168 --> 00:53:14,398
Come on, Hollis, stop it.

802
00:53:17,074 --> 00:53:18,820
The party's tomorrow night.

803
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,196
Here.

804
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:24,645
I'm sorry I gotta be the one
to break it to you.

805
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,387
Good evening...

806
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:48,099
Who told you my name?

807
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:51,352
I met a delightful
baby vampire tonight.

808
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,354
Actually, no,

809
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:56,994
she was irritating as all get-out,
but she did tell me a great many things,

810
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,442
such as your name

811
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,669
and the fact that you live in a house
owned by the human companion

812
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,136
of Mr. Bill Compton.

813
00:54:04,815 --> 00:54:06,483
Why is that important to you?

814
00:54:06,608 --> 00:54:07,702
Who do you work for?

815
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:11,581
Well, now who's interested
in getting to know me all of a sudden?

816
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:17,859
Mind if I...

817
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:21,008
- come in?
- Hell no.

818
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:24,030
I got a terrible track record
with letting people into this house.

819
00:54:24,155 --> 00:54:26,095
Don't be that way, Tara.

820
00:54:29,147 --> 00:54:30,147
Tara.

821
00:54:31,642 --> 00:54:33,519
That is such a beautiful name.

822
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,758
As far as you're concerned, my name is:
"That girl from Bon Temps, huh?

823
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,129
"Wonder how she's doing.

824
00:54:39,254 --> 00:54:41,285
"Too bad I can't get a hold
of her anymore. "

825
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,111
Actually, I can get a hold of you

826
00:54:44,483 --> 00:54:46,033
any time I want.

827
00:54:47,499 --> 00:54:48,849
Isn't that right?

828
00:54:57,388 --> 00:54:58,961
You wanted to come in?

829
00:55:00,223 --> 00:55:01,423
If you insist.

830
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:04,531
Come in.

831
00:55:05,441 --> 00:55:06,385
Please.

832
00:55:37,242 --> 00:55:38,542
Most impressive.

833
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:43,184
You won the trust
of Russell Edgington himself.

834
00:55:44,262 --> 00:55:46,280
A bravura performance.

835
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,460
I don't care what you believe.

836
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:52,628
My only loyalty is to my king.

837
00:55:53,445 --> 00:55:56,145
Your only loyalty
is to your own sentiment.

838
00:55:57,364 --> 00:55:59,064
It's your great failing.

839
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,977
A century ago,
it was to your human wife.

840
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,696
Now it's that ridiculous waitress.

841
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,407
You'll say anything to save her.

842
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:15,006
We can never love humans
without bringing suffering upon them.

843
00:56:16,662 --> 00:56:18,082
You taught me that...

844
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,669
and I will never forgive you.

845
00:56:22,468 --> 00:56:24,296
It's an essential truth,

846
00:56:25,126 --> 00:56:26,882
one you refused to face

847
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:30,099
because you clung
to the illusion of humanity.

848
00:56:31,228 --> 00:56:32,138
You are right.

849
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,848
Is that what you wish to hear?

850
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:36,726
You proved it to me once
and now I've learned it again.

851
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,278
You have won.

852
00:56:40,244 --> 00:56:42,494
You've deprived me of my freedom...

853
00:56:44,331 --> 00:56:45,359
and my home...

854
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,233
my humanity.

855
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,519
But I will never,

856
00:56:53,852 --> 00:56:54,852
ever...

857
00:56:55,268 --> 00:56:56,576
love you.

858
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,098
Never!

859
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,880
Yes. Make love to me.

860
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,482
Never. I will never.

861
00:57:40,528 --> 00:57:41,728
I so love you.
