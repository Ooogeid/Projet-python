1
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,513
- Back off.
- Keep out of this.

2
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,392
- I don't take orders from vamps.
- Get away from her.

3
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,677
He saved her life.

4
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:20,779
After he almost fucking killed her.

5
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:23,686
- You're alive. Sweet Jesus.
- Is everything okay?

6
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:25,611
Yeah, she had a nightmare.

7
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:27,776
Say something.

8
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:29,804
You brain damaged?

9
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,251
I need to speak to Bill, alone.

10
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,538
So he can finish what he started?
Hell, no.

11
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:43,000
Everyone, please.

12
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:44,918
Y'all heard her. Out.

13
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:04,895
You're afraid of me.

14
00:01:06,574 --> 00:01:07,817
Can you blame me?

15
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:10,884
I never meant to hurt you.

16
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:16,200
I couldn't stop.

17
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:17,525
I know.

18
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,248
I can't take back what I've done.

19
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:24,251
You can't.

20
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:28,161
I don't know how
to start forgiving you.

21
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,466
Don't know if I ever will.

22
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:32,425
There's too much.

23
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,696
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

24
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:38,597
I don't wanna be forgiven.

25
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:40,426
From the day we met,

26
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,647
it's been one long,
bloody fight.

27
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:49,796
And I keep waiting
for it to be over,

28
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,529
for us to be happy,

29
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,601
to start our lives together

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,030
like a normal couple.

31
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,623
But it's never gonna
happen for us, is it?

32
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,691
I want you to have all that.

33
00:02:08,636 --> 00:02:10,836
I want you to lie in the sunlight.

34
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,064
Have children.

35
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:17,896
Grow old with someone.

36
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:20,389
I want you to have
the life you deserve.

37
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,918
And I cannot give it to you.

38
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:34,255
I love you, Sookie Stackhouse.

39
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:37,698
And I will love you forever.

40
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:41,325
I love you too.

41
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:53,130
Be safe.

42
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,557
This isn't a room,

43
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,175
it's a fucking closet.

44
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,563
Where am I supposed
to put my birds? Hadley!

45
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,849
You never said she was going
to live with us.

46
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,391
She's my wife, Talbot.

47
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,270
We just acquired the state of Louisiana.
I thought you would've been excited.

48
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:14,678
Excited?

49
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:17,692
Franklin's brains
won't wash off the guest linens.

50
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,277
I had to bury werewolves
under the gazebo.

51
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,745
And that Sookie bitch staked Lorena.

52
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:25,776
I've had enough excitement,
thank you.

53
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,460
They made quite a mess, didn't they?

54
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:35,997
Well, at least you're safe.

55
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,295
That's what matters most to me.

56
00:05:39,585 --> 00:05:40,464
Words.

57
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,688
Oh, things may be
getting complicated soon.

58
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,300
I'm afraid I acted somewhat
impulsively while I was gone.

59
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,283
What did you do?

60
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,019
Spit it out.

61
00:05:54,317 --> 00:05:55,917
I killed the Magister.

62
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:58,249
He deserved it.

63
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,113
Are you out of your fucking mind?
The Authority will never stand for it...

64
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,544
Fuck the Authority.

65
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,323
They won't be able to prove a thing.
I made sure of that.

66
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:08,492
You're acting like
a century-old child.

67
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:09,734
Relax!

68
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,580
I've already sent
a 500 000 $ check to the AVL

69
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,873
in support
of their Vampire Rights Amendment.

70
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,967
- You can't buy everything.
- Of course I can.

71
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:19,253
This is America.

72
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:21,928
Forgive the interruption,
Your Majesty.

73
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,632
There's a were-bitch in your study.

74
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,980
Go, while I babysit your wife.

75
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:41,650
- What's up, pumpkin
- They killed my Cooter.

76
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,194
He died a hero.

77
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,812
He weren't no hero.

78
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:49,217
He just wanted to do some V
and have a little fun.

79
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,675
And they shot him in the heart.

80
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,430
Let me go after them.

81
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:57,332
I'll rip their fucking heads off!

82
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,127
I like your energy.

83
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,431
- What do you think, Northman?
- I enjoy a good head-ripping

84
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,299
as much as the next vampire.

85
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,718
But it might be wise

86
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:10,596
to consider the value
of the heads in question.

87
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,683
You mean the Stackhouse girl?
She's something special, isn't she?

88
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,781
She fucked my ex-boyfriend
and made him shoot my fiance.

89
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:20,481
- She's a cunt.
- But she's a special cunt.

90
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,608
Don't worry, darling.

91
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:25,486
I'll let you play with her first.

92
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,211
Go.

93
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,914
Respectfully, Your Majesty,

94
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,256
given the recent turn of events,

95
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,711
bringing Sookie into this
may not be the best idea.

96
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,493
That's exactly why I need her.

97
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:46,707
I may have inadvertently
started a war tonight.

98
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:48,842
Miss Stackhouse
could be my secret weapon.

99
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:51,804
Well, Sookie's abilities
are unpredictable at best.

100
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,640
And like most humans,
she's ruled by petty emotions.

101
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:56,486
I would not trust her.

102
00:07:57,617 --> 00:08:00,067
The real question is:
Can I trust you?

103
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:02,606
You turned on your own queen.

104
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,692
Now that I've freed
your feisty little ward

105
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,567
how do I know
you won't sell me out as well?

106
00:08:12,507 --> 00:08:16,004
Because I have been searching
for you for a thousand years.

107
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:21,004
A true leader.

108
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:24,445
One strong enough to unite us all.

109
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:28,049
I believed my maker, Godric,

110
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,374
was such a vampire,
but he was...

111
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:31,976
weak.

112
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:35,554
He succumbed to his humanity,
and it killed him.

113
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:38,976
Dispatching the Magister,
that proved

114
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,086
without a doubt that my search...

115
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:45,274
- It has finally ended.
- That was rash and foolish.

116
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,591
It was brave and uncompromising.

117
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,573
Vampires have yearned
for someone to stand up,

118
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,438
to the tyranny
of the Authority for centuries.

119
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,540
Just give me the chance.

120
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:09,214
And I will show you

121
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,221
just how deep my loyalty runs.

122
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:21,736
Hush little baby don't say a word

123
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:25,663
Papa's gonna buy you a mocking bird

124
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:30,008
And if that mocking bird don't sing

125
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:34,455
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring

126
00:09:36,164 --> 00:09:38,285
When's Papa gonna buy
Mama a diamond ring?

127
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,455
That's what I wanna know.

128
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:47,622
And if that diamond ring turns brass

129
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:52,409
Papa's going to buy you
a looking glass

130
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:56,407
If that looking glass gets broke

131
00:09:57,082 --> 00:09:59,348
Papa's going to buy you a billy goat

132
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Rene.

133
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:06,396
Don't you worry, Chelle.

134
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,524
I'll take real good care
of our baby.

135
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:11,349
You're dead.

136
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:14,071
They buried you.

137
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:17,156
Death can't keep me from my boy.

138
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,710
You're gonna finish
what daddy started,

139
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,435
<i>ain't you, petit boug?</i>

140
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,373
Gonna be just like
your old man, you.

141
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:28,410
He ain't gonna be nothing like you.

142
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:30,045
Get away from us.

143
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,150
I'm in his blood, boo.

144
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,968
Ain't nothing you can do about that.

145
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,265
Wake up, wake up.

146
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:45,462
You're dreaming, baby.

147
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:53,011
I never thought I'd miss you,
but I totally did.

148
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:56,968
All right. There's some stuff
that I gotta tell you,

149
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:58,916
but promise me
you won't get mad.

150
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,491
There's no time for this.

151
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,703
You must collect your things
and leave immediately.

152
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,955
- Where we going?
- We're not going anywhere.

153
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,029
- But...
- Look at me.

154
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:09,796
As your maker, I release you.

155
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,887
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

156
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:17,259
It means our ties are broken.
You are free to go.

157
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:21,055
Well, but, uh, what if
I don't wanna be released?

158
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,266
- You can't stay with me.
- I ain't going anywhere. No way.

159
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,351
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

160
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:28,815
I drained someone.

161
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,741
I was hungry and I was sad,
and it was an accident.

162
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:35,665
But I didn't know how to control myself.
Because you never taught me.

163
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,039
I need you.
You are the only maker I've got.

164
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,914
I can't take care of you!

165
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:42,386
I can't protect you!

166
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:47,497
I'm no good to you.

167
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:49,747
Well, I'm no good either.

168
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,959
And I don't care what you say,
I am not leaving.

169
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:04,806
I don't wanna be alone anymore.

170
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:43,458
I don't wanna talk about it.

171
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:52,947
If you need to get back
to Jackson, I understand.

172
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,356
I'll be fine.

173
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:57,701
Sookie, I know you're tougher
than a one-eared alley cat.

174
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,820
But I ain't leaving you alone
right now.

175
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,824
Besides, Jackson won't be
too friendly tonight.

176
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:06,460
There's a guest room upstairs.

177
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,620
You're welcome to it
for as long as you need.

178
00:13:13,596 --> 00:13:15,419
Someday it won't hurt so bad.

179
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:18,972
Is that what you keep telling
yourself about Debbie?

180
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,978
Andy, what are you doing here?

181
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,847
Just cos I let Bill give you blood,
don't mean I forgive him.

182
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:28,849
Sook, you need to press charges.

183
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:33,320
What he did to you,
that's domestic... something.

184
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,273
Actually, it sounds more like
assault or attempted murder.

185
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,516
I'm not gonna press charges on Bill.

186
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:40,694
Your brother's just trying
to look out for you.

187
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,904
I know,
but Bill didn't attack me on purpose.

188
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:47,200
He was starving and unconscious.
It's his nature.

189
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,718
That's no excuse.

190
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:54,842
It's over between me and Bill.

191
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:57,261
There's nothing more to talk about.

192
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:58,720
Maybe it's not the time.

193
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:01,382
If you change your mind,
we can get a restraining order.

194
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,607
No, screw the restraining order.

195
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:06,587
If he come near you again,
I'm gonna kill him, I swear.

196
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,222
You ain't killing nobody.

197
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:10,975
<i>Stop looking at me.
She's gonna hear what I'm thinking.</i>

198
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,610
<i>Don't lose your shit on me.</i>

199
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,436
<i>Shut up, brain. Stop thinking.
She's gonna find out.</i>

200
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,771
Find out what?

201
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:19,219
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

202
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:24,070
You got no right being in my
head. That's trespassing.

203
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,606
I do so have a right.
If you're gonna come into my house

204
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:28,575
threatening to kill people
and lying to me.

205
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:30,785
Fine. I'll leave.

206
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:33,955
Somebody's gotta make that fanger pay
for what he did to you.

207
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,223
That fanger?

208
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:38,210
That's not who you are.

209
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:41,922
That's now how Gran raised you.
You ain't a bigot or a murderer.

210
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,394
I know you love me
and you're just trying to protect me,

211
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,878
but I have seen enough
killing and hating.

212
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,603
I can't take any more.

213
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,575
Please just tell me
you ain't gonna do anything stupid.

214
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:09,950
You ever gonna tell me
what happened to you?

215
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:17,572
Someday.

216
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:20,208
Just not tonight.

217
00:15:22,116 --> 00:15:25,216
Well, hooker, I need to know.
You got a death wish?

218
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:30,587
I don't.

219
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:34,858
I fought like
a motherfucker to survive.

220
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:40,815
Never realized how much
I wanted to live till...

221
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,230
I can't go there right now,
Lafayette.

222
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,942
You ain't got to go nowhere.

223
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:00,267
You just stay right here with me.

224
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,207
Get in here before someone sees you.

225
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:39,363
Make sure that's everything.

226
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:42,242
Because you ain't welcome back
here, you understand?

227
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,878
I want you boys to know
I don't blame you.

228
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,097
I'd leave us too if I could.

229
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:48,548
And what's stopping you?

230
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:52,677
That son of a bitch done nothing
but knock you up and suck you dry.

231
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,721
That son of a bitch is your daddy.

232
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:56,673
And he's my husband.

233
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:01,161
I know he's no good.

234
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:04,147
But love don't discriminate.
That's why...

235
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,386
You can hate me if you want,

236
00:17:10,316 --> 00:17:12,016
but I'll still love you.

237
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:14,682
Both of y'all.

238
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:19,400
As long as I'm still breathing.

239
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,166
Take care of my boy, Sam.

240
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,486
Take care of yourself too.

241
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,289
I'm so glad ya'll got each other.

242
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:44,437
- Well, let me help you with that.
- I'm stronger than I look.

243
00:17:44,886 --> 00:17:46,036
I believe it.

244
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:48,686
But if you wanna help,

245
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,777
I could really use some money.

246
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:54,448
I got no right to ask,

247
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,950
but Joe Lee spent
every cent we had on that fight.

248
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,048
That ain't gonna get us far.

249
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:14,884
I don't give a fuck where it gets
you as long as it's out of here.

250
00:19:48,492 --> 00:19:49,588
Motherfuck.

251
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,777
And now you can fly too.
Ain't you fancy?

252
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:58,530
Mama, how you get out the hospital?
And what are you doing here?

253
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,048
Hell, I came to protect you.
They coming for you.

254
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,910
Who? Who coming for me, Mama?

255
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:09,582
The vampires, the witches.

256
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,710
The dogs and the cats, they know.

257
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:15,341
They all know.

258
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,132
And they are coming for you, baby.

259
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:21,278
But I got here. I got here.

260
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:34,840
You wanna be alone?

261
00:20:47,189 --> 00:20:48,990
I used to do this all the time.

262
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:53,413
Just lie in the sun
till the whole world faded away.

263
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:57,884
And your Gran would yell
about you putting on sunscreen.

264
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:01,030
"You're frying
like a fritter in a pan."

265
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:05,280
My whole life's at night now.

266
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:09,349
You gonna go back to Bill again?

267
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:12,558
No one's ever hurt me so bad.

268
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:16,941
I trusted him with every part of me.

269
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:19,924
Maybe it's stupid
to trust someone that much.

270
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:24,657
You didn't ask for any of this.

271
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:28,244
I knew what he was the minute I laid
eyes on him. I knew he was dangerous.

272
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:31,805
And I ain't gonna lie,
that's part of what I fell in love with.

273
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:34,167
Bill gave you his blood
before your first date.

274
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,418
He saved my life.

275
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:38,489
We both know what drinking
their blood does to you.

276
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,883
- Maybe he glamoured you.
- Glamouring doesn't work on me.

277
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,598
It might be over between me and Bill,
but what we had was real.

278
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,585
And I can't just flip a switch
and turn my heart off.

279
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:52,114
You know what you sound like?

280
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:54,732
One of those sad country songs
about dumb bitches, who let their men

281
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:57,415
cheat and beat on them
all for the sake of true love.

282
00:21:58,326 --> 00:21:59,589
Let me tell you something.

283
00:21:59,714 --> 00:22:02,779
At the end of those songs,
the dumb bitches always end up dead.

284
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:05,114
- Did you just call me a dumb bitch?
- I'm sorry,

285
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,138
but if you go back to that vampire,
that's what you are.

286
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,694
What I can do in my brain,

287
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:12,674
it's every bit as deadly
as Bill's fangs.

288
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,640
I know what it's like
to be afraid of my own body,

289
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:17,585
to not be sure
what it's gonna do next.

290
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:19,316
I've killed.

291
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,216
I may not have cheated,
but I wanted to.

292
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,884
- Me and Bill, we ain't so different.
- Yes, you are.

293
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:27,084
I saw the look in his eye.

294
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:30,746
Same as Franklin's: cold and crazy.

295
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,102
Like a rattlesnake.

296
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,438
- That isn't the Bill I know.
- Maybe you don't know the real Bill.

297
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:40,706
I don't wanna fight with you.

298
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:44,259
You've been through a lot.
I can see you're in pain.

299
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:47,156
- Let's talk about it.
- I can't.

300
00:22:50,357 --> 00:22:51,881
Because trust me, Sook,

301
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:53,871
you don't wanna hear
what I've gotta say.

302
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:55,326
Morning, Tara.

303
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:03,533
Good. Maybe you can flirt
some sense into that girl,

304
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,879
because logic sure
as hell ain't working.

305
00:23:30,318 --> 00:23:31,313
Hold on.

306
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:35,631
Yeah, I'm coming.

307
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:37,626
Goddamn it.

308
00:23:39,054 --> 00:23:40,850
Let me unlock the goddamn...

309
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,712
I need your truck.

310
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,589
What happened to your face?

311
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:47,715
Come right in.

312
00:23:51,393 --> 00:23:53,027
What did you do, swim here?

313
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,683
It was the only way
they couldn't track me.

314
00:23:56,031 --> 00:23:58,436
What, is that drug-dealer
code for something?

315
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:03,983
I don't wanna cause you no trouble,
but I had no other place to go.

316
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:07,653
- All's I need is your truck.
- My truck.

317
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:09,498
Yeah, I heard you.

318
00:24:11,939 --> 00:24:13,620
But, Crystal,
you ain't getting my truck

319
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,578
until you tell me
what happened to your face.

320
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:19,281
Can I get a towel?

321
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:23,419
And some whiskey?

322
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,372
<i>Got any of those Tru Bloods?</i>

323
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:38,469
Motherfucker!

324
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,392
That's Tara.
She's all bark and...

325
00:24:45,305 --> 00:24:46,901
Well, she bites too.

326
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,238
But at least she ain't
a vampire like our hostess.

327
00:24:50,543 --> 00:24:53,111
Chili's down in Monroe
had a vampire bus boy.

328
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:54,700
He's real fast.

329
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:58,122
Well, seems like you're gonna
fit in just great around here.

330
00:24:58,442 --> 00:25:01,415
Now, this is nice place to work.
Don't let nobody tell you different.

331
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,669
You mean all the dead waitresses?
I heard.

332
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,139
But I figure,
world's been around long enough.

333
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:09,664
No matter where you step,
somebody's died there.

334
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:12,510
What an interesting way
to look at it.

335
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:14,592
Besides, I got two kids to feed.

336
00:25:14,717 --> 00:25:16,848
This recession and all,
can't afford being picky.

337
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,059
I got two kids too.
Lisa and Coby.

338
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:22,562
And the one on the way?

339
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:25,174
You have a name yet?

340
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:26,678
How'd you know?

341
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:32,405
- Who's this?
- This is Holly, your new waitress.

342
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:34,490
Don't sleep with her.

343
00:25:36,112 --> 00:25:36,935
All right.

344
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,648
It's okay.

345
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,038
It's okay, it's just me.

346
00:26:01,614 --> 00:26:04,228
I've been promised
to Felton since I was 4.

347
00:26:05,002 --> 00:26:06,194
Four years old?

348
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:08,692
Is that even legal?

349
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,361
Case you hadn't noticed, we don't
care much for the law in Hotshot.

350
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,510
Well, is it like a church
or cult or something?

351
00:26:15,635 --> 00:26:18,743
Because I've done that,
and they washed my brain.

352
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:23,289
Daddy says God's just a drug,
like meth or whiskey.

353
00:26:23,546 --> 00:26:24,546
Felton.

354
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:27,418
He did this to your face?

355
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:29,420
After you came and saw me.

356
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,132
What? This...?
This is because of me?

357
00:26:34,805 --> 00:26:36,928
Because I told him I weren't
gonna marry him no more.

358
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,330
Great.

359
00:26:43,222 --> 00:26:46,260
I mean, not great
that he punched you in the face.

360
00:26:46,385 --> 00:26:48,682
Great that you ain't
getting married.

361
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:54,655
Goddamn. What is it
about you, Crystal?

362
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,449
Why do you make me feel this way?

363
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,410
What way?

364
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:03,007
Like I'm home.

365
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:10,263
I gotta go. Give me your keys.

366
00:27:10,388 --> 00:27:11,709
But you said...

367
00:27:20,318 --> 00:27:21,835
If you wanna go...

368
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:24,448
... I'll drive you anyplace you say.

369
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,392
But I think you wanna stay with me,

370
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:33,313
and you're just scared.

371
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,612
You don't know them.

372
00:27:37,837 --> 00:27:39,287
They don't know me.

373
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,586
Moms, I done told you,
ain't nobody coming for me.

374
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:59,284
- Who knocking, then?
- That ain't for me, Mama.

375
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:00,770
Trust me.

376
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:10,021
You got a lot of people
real worried, Ruby Jean.

377
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,981
That white bitch say,

378
00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:14,775
"Sit there. I'll be right back."

379
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:16,569
You showed her.

380
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,502
I gotta pee, Jesus.

381
00:28:23,212 --> 00:28:25,870
One of our new nurses left your
mother in the garden.

382
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,956
It won't happen again.

383
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,043
For what I pay that place,
it better not.

384
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:35,921
Come in, please.

385
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:45,867
Thank you for coming
on your day off.

386
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:49,619
I didn't wanna call
the hospital in case they...

387
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,228
They sent the cops?

388
00:28:55,637 --> 00:28:58,179
I guess that wouldn't be too good
for your business, huh?

389
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:00,404
About the other night...

390
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,073
I ain't going back there.

391
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:04,914
You ain't taking me back.

392
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,749
I ain't crazy. It's them drugs
they're giving me.

393
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,149
You got power, boy.

394
00:29:14,997 --> 00:29:16,495
You always have.

395
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,173
That's why they're coming.

396
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:22,464
I got to protect you,

397
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,678
but I can't if you keep drugging me.

398
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,847
- Mama, give me the knife.
- Do not touch me.

399
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,477
Ruby Jean,

400
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:33,979
you're right.

401
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,275
Your son is very powerful.

402
00:29:40,065 --> 00:29:41,987
But I'm not gonna let
anything happen to him.

403
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:50,453
Just give me the knife.

404
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:53,416
Let's watch some TV.

405
00:30:04,115 --> 00:30:08,094
TV's all faggots
and murderers and ho's, Jesus.

406
00:30:09,972 --> 00:30:11,262
Where the clicker?

407
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:32,615
I'm not gonna hurt you.

408
00:30:35,683 --> 00:30:39,441
I need you to deliver
a message to your cousin.

409
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,983
I ain't seen Sookie since...

410
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,683
Tell her exactly what I say,

411
00:30:47,936 --> 00:30:49,422
and nothing more.

412
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,464
Janice, listen to me.
Stay there, call Dad.

413
00:30:53,864 --> 00:30:54,935
I'm on my way.

414
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,183
Goddamn it.
Debbie?

415
00:30:57,597 --> 00:31:00,107
She and her pack of Were trash
burned down my sister's salon.

416
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,027
It's one thing coming after me,
it's another going after my family.

417
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,987
It's 'cause you helped me.

418
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,490
Debbie was crazy
long before you came around.

419
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:11,284
I just gotta find her before she goes
after anyone else I love.

420
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,081
Sorry, Sookie.

421
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,081
I gotta go.

422
00:31:16,732 --> 00:31:20,044
Of course. They're your family.
Don't be sorry.

423
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,545
Should come with me.

424
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:24,798
But you...

425
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,782
I am not gonna spend my life running.
That's not a life.

426
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:29,887
Russell and his wolves
will come back for you.

427
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:34,183
Call somebody to come stay with you.
Your brother, that sheriff.

428
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:37,510
My brother and Andy wouldn't
stand a chance against Russell.

429
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:39,605
I can't let anyone else
get hurt because of me.

430
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:43,108
- I ain't leaving you here alone.
- If I'm in danger, Bill will come.

431
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:44,860
Sure about that?

432
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,865
You can read minds
and shoot light out of your fingers.

433
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:56,121
Who am I to tell you
what's best for you?

434
00:31:57,409 --> 00:31:59,608
If I knew what was best for me,

435
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:02,312
I would have fallen in love
with someone like you.

436
00:32:03,664 --> 00:32:04,723
Back at you.

437
00:32:06,421 --> 00:32:08,300
It's too bad we're so stupid, huh?

438
00:32:11,956 --> 00:32:13,556
I'm glad I met you.

439
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:15,391
You take care of yourself.

440
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,666
You'll come back
and see me sometime?

441
00:32:42,724 --> 00:32:44,124
You can bet on it.

442
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,893
Keep your eye on Tara.
If she needs anything, get it.

443
00:33:15,018 --> 00:33:18,217
She starts yelling or throwing drinks,
come and find me.

444
00:33:19,613 --> 00:33:21,457
Sounds like my kind of girl.

445
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,167
Don't you flirt with her, either.

446
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,513
- She your girlfriend?
- She ain't my girlfriend.

447
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:27,921
She's going through some stuff
that's none of your business.

448
00:33:33,351 --> 00:33:34,887
Is Jessica Hamby working tonight?

449
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,307
Give it a rest, man.
She's way out of your league.

450
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:40,726
Who the hell are you?

451
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:42,102
Tommy Merlotte.

452
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,605
You're in my family's establishment,

453
00:33:44,928 --> 00:33:47,149
so you listen to me when I tell you

454
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,681
Jessica's done with you.

455
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:50,611
She's moving on to a real man.

456
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:53,822
You wanna pick a fight,
do it with somebody your own size.

457
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,075
What do you say?
Wanna take this outside?

458
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,952
Nobody's taking nothing nowhere.

459
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:01,455
Hey. Hoyt, I apologize
for my brother.

460
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:03,514
Tara, get him a drink
on the house, please.

461
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:06,218
In my office. Now.

462
00:34:08,611 --> 00:34:10,438
- I hate that dick.
- Hoyt's not a dick.

463
00:34:10,563 --> 00:34:13,682
And whatever's going on between him
and Jessica, I want you stay out of it.

464
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:17,334
- You ain't my father, so...
- I ain't Joe Lee. I care about you.

465
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:19,073
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

466
00:34:19,198 --> 00:34:22,601
I could take that big crybaby with
both my hands tied behind my back.

467
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:27,106
It's been a fight for you up until now,
but it don't have to be that way.

468
00:34:28,181 --> 00:34:31,047
All right, so how about you just
give trouble a rest for a while

469
00:34:31,172 --> 00:34:33,737
and focus on building
a future for yourself?

470
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,449
What are you talking about?

471
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,574
Well, Merlotte's was my dream.

472
00:34:38,558 --> 00:34:40,786
I want you to start thinking
about one of your own.

473
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:43,714
Get some money saved up.

474
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,050
You go to college,
make something of your life.

475
00:34:47,564 --> 00:34:48,501
College?

476
00:34:50,581 --> 00:34:53,131
You really don't know me
at all, do you?

477
00:35:02,694 --> 00:35:04,244
That was much better.

478
00:35:07,693 --> 00:35:09,356
I'm getting fast, aren't I?

479
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:13,152
Yeah, but werewolves are faster.

480
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:17,957
- You think they're coming for you?
- Or Sookie.

481
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:19,241
Or both of us.

482
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,578
- Why aren't you with her, then?
- Because she doesn't want me to be.

483
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,570
If she needs me, I will know it.

484
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,001
She screwed up your proposal,
I get it.

485
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,920
But when she was looking for you,
she was wearing your ring.

486
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,117
Jessica, it's over.

487
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
No way.

488
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:37,829
Way.

489
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:40,671
But you love her.

490
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:42,707
I do.

491
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:48,945
Which is why I have to let her go.

492
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:55,463
I love Hoyt.

493
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,376
But he's so good and sweet.

494
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,746
He deserves to be with somebody
who deserves him.

495
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:11,319
I'm sorry.

496
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:15,153
It sucks.

497
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:52,708
Who's there?

498
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,846
Where have you been?

499
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:09,796
Is Gran here?

500
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,159
I should've called,

501
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:19,548
and said I was sorry for running
away from that rehab.

502
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,489
- None of that matters anymore.
- You're right.

503
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:25,450
Gran is fine wherever she is.

504
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:29,349
We're the ones who are fucked.

505
00:37:31,121 --> 00:37:33,021
I didn't come here to visit.

506
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:37,548
I've got a message for you

507
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:39,756
from Eric Northman.

508
00:37:40,746 --> 00:37:42,296
How do you know Eric?

509
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,446
What's he done to you?

510
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:46,172
Nothing too bad yet.

511
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,562
But if I don't tell
you this exactly,

512
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:51,435
it ain't gonna be pretty.

513
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:52,728
Tell me what?

514
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:55,105
Russell is coming for you.

515
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:57,858
Don't trust Bill.

516
00:37:58,165 --> 00:38:00,415
Oh, and I'm supposed to trust Eric?

517
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:03,981
What does all this
have to do with you, anyway?

518
00:38:04,686 --> 00:38:05,824
I've gotta go.

519
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:07,826
Hadley, wait.

520
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,034
You can't just leave like this.

521
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,539
I've got to. And so should you.
They're coming.

522
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,754
Russell was powerful enough
to kidnap Bill,

523
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:17,043
and God knows what he's got on Eric.

524
00:38:17,168 --> 00:38:19,796
If he wants me, he's gonna find me,
no matter where I run.

525
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,965
Sookie, if they find you,
they're gonna do horrible things.

526
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:28,309
I'm so sorry. I hope one day
you can forgive me.

527
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:29,765
Forgive you for what?

528
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,959
<i>I'm the one who told them
about you. All my fault.</i>

529
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:38,484
Go ahead, leave, like you've
been doing for centuries,

530
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:40,943
chasing after this or that
while I sit here alone.

531
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,111
In a mansion with all
the blood you can drink

532
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,781
and all the vampire boys
you could possibly want.

533
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,249
Oh, poor Talbot.

534
00:38:47,738 --> 00:38:50,999
- Are your diamond slippers chafing?
- First the queen, now a telepath?

535
00:38:51,124 --> 00:38:53,974
All you care about's
your precious collection.

536
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:05,801
Your Majesty.

537
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,787
Perhaps I have a solution.

538
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,804
I know I'm a poor substitute,

539
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:16,495
but I would be honored
to keep you company.

540
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:19,851
I don't know.

541
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,710
That sounds like fun.

542
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,330
I am positively

543
00:39:25,242 --> 00:39:26,242
jealous.

544
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:27,951
Fine.

545
00:39:28,726 --> 00:39:32,605
Mr. Northman and I will try to find
some way to amuse ourselves.

546
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,931
<i>Thank you.</i>

547
00:39:50,284 --> 00:39:52,684
I've never been outside
of Bon Temps.

548
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:55,642
Never had no job other than cooking.

549
00:39:56,057 --> 00:39:57,057
You cook?

550
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:00,605
My sister works at Merlotte's.

551
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,773
Not food,

552
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:03,381
meth.

553
00:40:06,486 --> 00:40:08,338
Jason, what am I gonna do?

554
00:40:09,147 --> 00:40:11,366
If I stay here, they're gonna
find me and kill you.

555
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:13,285
That ain't gonna happen.

556
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:18,839
That ain't gonna happen.

557
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:24,977
We're together now.

558
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:28,539
No one's gonna come between us.

559
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,863
That is crazy talk.

560
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:35,860
But I almost believe you.

561
00:40:39,717 --> 00:40:42,814
Is that your stomach growling,
or you got gas?

562
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,282
It's my stomach.

563
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:48,515
I ain't eaten since this morning.

564
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:53,433
Tell you what.
Why don't you hop in the shower?

565
00:40:53,816 --> 00:40:56,304
Come here. And I'll go get
us something to eat.

566
00:40:56,429 --> 00:40:59,240
- I ain't staying here by myself.
- It'll just be a minute.

567
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:01,396
I'll lock the door.

568
00:41:01,655 --> 00:41:03,855
Ain't nothing gonna happen to you.

569
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:06,153
Good.

570
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:26,133
Well. Well, that's
pretty fine, isn't it?

571
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:28,185
I must say.

572
00:41:28,767 --> 00:41:30,612
He's looking over here, huh?

573
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:47,129
Can I help you?

574
00:41:49,121 --> 00:41:51,021
I'm looking for my daughter.

575
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:54,397
- What's your daughter's name?
- Her name's Crystal Norris.

576
00:41:54,522 --> 00:41:56,067
Blond, real pretty.

577
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,558
Got a black eye cos she's so clumsy,
she walked into a wall.

578
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:03,520
Well, I haven't seen anybody
like that around here.

579
00:42:04,928 --> 00:42:07,190
Maybe it's best if you gentlemen
were on your way.

580
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,817
I know she's been here

581
00:42:09,131 --> 00:42:11,570
because she took my truck
and it's outside in your lot.

582
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:14,034
So quit being a fuck mouth
and tell me where she is.

583
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,116
- There a problem here?
- Everything's fine.

584
00:42:16,972 --> 00:42:19,191
Look, I don't know you,
I don't know your daughter,

585
00:42:19,316 --> 00:42:21,746
but this is my bar,
and you ain't welcome here.

586
00:42:23,757 --> 00:42:24,666
Listen up,

587
00:42:24,904 --> 00:42:25,792
shifter.

588
00:42:27,157 --> 00:42:28,660
I find out you're lying to me,

589
00:42:28,785 --> 00:42:31,089
I'm gonna rip your dick off,
and feed it to my hogs.

590
00:42:33,713 --> 00:42:34,885
You heard him, Tommy.

591
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,054
Down, boy.

592
00:42:41,418 --> 00:42:42,668
You smell that?

593
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,979
Yes, sir.

594
00:42:49,095 --> 00:42:50,968
She's snoring like a buzz saw.

595
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:56,213
You told them I'm letting
her spend the night?

596
00:42:57,473 --> 00:42:59,393
They weren't very happy about it.

597
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,261
But I think it's good, you know?

598
00:43:03,054 --> 00:43:04,706
She went through a lot to get here.

599
00:43:05,895 --> 00:43:08,453
I think it's her way
of saying that she needs you.

600
00:43:08,578 --> 00:43:11,114
Waving a kitchen knife is a hell
of a way to say you care.

601
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:12,672
She wasn't gonna hurt anybody.

602
00:43:14,111 --> 00:43:16,384
Ruby Jean has got a flair for drama.

603
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,494
It runs in the family.

604
00:43:22,104 --> 00:43:24,684
What she said before
about you being...

605
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,902
powerful...

606
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,688
It's true, you know that, right?

607
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,059
When I was 5 years old,
that woman told me

608
00:43:31,184 --> 00:43:33,034
I could breathe underwater.

609
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,540
My little ass almost drowned.

610
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,840
So, no, boyfriend, I don't...

611
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,617
listen to most of
what come out her mouth.

612
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,390
She's schizophrenic,

613
00:43:42,847 --> 00:43:44,871
but it doesn't mean
that she's not perceptive.

614
00:43:46,717 --> 00:43:49,334
Just let me say this, then I'll get
off your back, all right?

615
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:54,599
Dealing drugs is very dangerous
for somebody like you.

616
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:57,782
All that energy you've got,

617
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,178
it can go dark if you let it.

618
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,870
I think you've been hanging
around my mama too long.

619
00:44:02,995 --> 00:44:05,466
Her crazy is starting
to rub off on you.

620
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,952
I'll be back in the morning
to pick her up.

621
00:44:10,077 --> 00:44:11,064
Wait.

622
00:44:14,962 --> 00:44:17,712
The dealing, I ain't got
no choice. I don't.

623
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,324
I've been trying to stop
for a while now. It's not that easy.

624
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,595
And if you don't want nothing
to do with me, that's fine.

625
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,270
I just wanted to let
you know because...

626
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:55,608
Checkmate.

627
00:44:59,456 --> 00:45:00,456
I'm bored.

628
00:45:01,342 --> 00:45:02,942
Take off your clothes.

629
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:07,138
A little privacy?

630
00:45:09,636 --> 00:45:10,836
Everybody out.

631
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:40,612
It's been a long time
since I've done this.

632
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:41,948
A man?

633
00:45:43,249 --> 00:45:44,249
A vampire.

634
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,890
Anybody here?

635
00:46:10,746 --> 00:46:11,746
Hello?

636
00:46:29,771 --> 00:46:31,830
Hey! Is anybody in...?

637
00:47:16,923 --> 00:47:18,219
Who in the hell are you?

638
00:47:18,344 --> 00:47:20,420
- You Crystal's father?
- You're the guy...

639
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,488
I'm the guy holding the gun.

640
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:26,198
And I'm telling you Crystal
ain't never coming back here.

641
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:29,053
And you ain't never
going near her again.

642
00:47:29,342 --> 00:47:30,380
Stupid punk.

643
00:47:31,024 --> 00:47:32,849
You got no idea who
you're messing with.

644
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,052
No, you got no idea.

645
00:47:35,773 --> 00:47:39,189
I'm a cop, and I know what
you're up to.

646
00:47:40,073 --> 00:47:43,171
So you're gonna leave
Crystal the fuck alone.

647
00:47:44,868 --> 00:47:47,656
Or me and the whole
sheriff's department

648
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,111
gonna come after you,

649
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:51,236
and your Hillbilly freak show.

650
00:47:52,668 --> 00:47:53,768
You feel me?

651
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:04,779
I feel you, boy.

652
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:19,247
Open up, little piggy.

653
00:49:20,399 --> 00:49:23,360
Or I'll huff and I'll puff,

654
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:26,480
and I'll blow your house down.

655
00:49:27,376 --> 00:49:29,257
I don't wanna kill you, but I will.

656
00:49:31,032 --> 00:49:33,482
I got nothing left
to live for anyway.

657
00:49:35,432 --> 00:49:36,732
You took it all.

658
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:39,493
You brought this
on yourself, Debbie.

659
00:49:40,515 --> 00:49:42,395
Take another step and I will shoot.

660
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,290
Why don't you just pull
the trigger now?

661
00:49:45,505 --> 00:49:47,946
- What do you care?
- There's people that love you

662
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:50,528
for reasons I ain't even gonna
try to make sense of.

663
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:54,711
Talking to me about love.

664
00:49:55,264 --> 00:49:57,839
How noble and shit. Bitch, please.

665
00:49:59,314 --> 00:50:01,014
I see right through you.

666
00:50:03,013 --> 00:50:04,744
You fuck vampires and werewolves

667
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:07,069
because your own kind rejects you.

668
00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:11,169
They know you're nothing
but a freak.

669
00:50:13,515 --> 00:50:15,165
I've had vampire blood.

670
00:50:15,482 --> 00:50:17,430
Lots of it.

671
00:50:17,792 --> 00:50:18,792
Me too.

672
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,620
Your boyfriend's yummy.

673
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,750
- Get back here.
- Jessica, stay in the house.

674
00:50:50,332 --> 00:50:53,132
Since no one was hospitable
enough to invite me in,

675
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,009
I had to wait till you came out.

676
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,637
I take it this is yours.

677
00:50:57,951 --> 00:50:58,930
Let her go.

678
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,599
What do you think, Gus?

679
00:51:02,116 --> 00:51:03,616
Should I let her go?

680
00:51:06,131 --> 00:51:07,473
I take it that's a no.

681
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,299
I'll tell you what.

682
00:51:09,424 --> 00:51:11,826
I'll trade you the red one

683
00:51:12,351 --> 00:51:13,527
for the blond one.

684
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:16,614
How about you and I settle
this among men?

685
00:51:17,373 --> 00:51:19,000
How very sexist of you, Bill.

686
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:22,245
When it comes to killing, I have
always been an equal opportunist.

687
00:51:25,629 --> 00:51:27,542
You are 3000 years old and a king,

688
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:29,877
yet you hide behind guards...

689
00:51:30,305 --> 00:51:31,421
... wolves...

690
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,073
... a baby vampire.

691
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:36,057
You a coward...

692
00:51:38,277 --> 00:51:39,977
... or are you just lazy?

693
00:51:43,402 --> 00:51:44,752
Here you go, boy.

694
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:46,601
Rip her to shreds.

695
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,050
Northman was right about you.

696
00:51:58,175 --> 00:51:59,824
You are a waste of the blood.

697
00:52:09,534 --> 00:52:10,684
Silver spurs.

698
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:12,863
You like?

699
00:53:19,486 --> 00:53:21,740
- Turn over.
- Oh, yes, Daddy.

700
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:33,626
Russell took my family.

701
00:53:35,177 --> 00:53:36,427
Now I take his.

702
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:56,315
Get out of my house, bitch!

703
00:53:56,927 --> 00:53:57,900
Fuck you.

704
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,947
Next time I won't miss.

705
00:54:28,169 --> 00:54:29,098
I love you.

706
00:54:29,448 --> 00:54:30,349
I'm sorry.

707
00:54:30,628 --> 00:54:32,478
- I love you.
- I'm sorry.

708
00:54:34,403 --> 00:54:35,553
I'm so sorry.

709
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:09,388
I'm sorry.

710
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,239
Please don't kill me.
I don't wanna die.
