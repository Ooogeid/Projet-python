True Blood
Season 1 Episode 7 (v.1.0)

3
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,140
Wait a minute.

4
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:32,385
I thought you were supposed
to be invisible in a mirror.

5
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,492
We started most of the myths
about ourselves many centuries ago.

6
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:40,739
If humans thought that we
couldn't be seen in a mirror,

7
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:42,685
it was another way for us to prove

8
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:44,564
that we weren't vampires.

9
00:02:44,684 --> 00:02:46,941
And that way, we could stay hid.

10
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:51,923
So what about holy water?

11
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:53,634
Just water.

12
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:56,142
- Crucifixes?
- Geometry.

13
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:57,096
Garlic?

14
00:02:57,256 --> 00:02:59,231
It's irritating,
but that's pretty much it.

15
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:07,508
- I feel a little weak.
- Of course you do.

16
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:10,872
I fed on your blood.

17
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:14,628
You should take some vitamin B-12
to replenish.

18
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:16,866
Will I need to do that every day?

19
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:18,868
If you don't mind, yes.

20
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:21,559
And no garlic.

21
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:26,918
Is it always like this?

22
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:28,636
No, it is not.

23
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:35,281
I never thought I'd be able to...

24
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:38,971
I am honored that you chose me.

25
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:45,936
<i>Her tiny little legs.</i>

26
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,075
<i>Flexible and smooth.</i>

27
00:03:49,673 --> 00:03:51,025
How's the homework comin'?

28
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:54,234
I hate math.
Gran usually helps me.

29
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:56,086
Maybe I can help.

30
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:57,879
<i>Her skin is perfect.</i>

31
00:03:58,844 --> 00:03:59,907
<i>So soft.</i>

32
00:04:00,503 --> 00:04:02,961
Come sit on my lap
so I can see you better.

33
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,254
I'm good at this.

34
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,578
It's easier than you think.

35
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:24,831
<i>No hair anywhere on her body.</i>

36
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:26,710
<i>Oh my.</i>

37
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,147
Uncle Bartlett loves you, sweetie.

38
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,468
It was just...

39
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:33,865
touching.

40
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:37,738
Wasn't nearly as bad as
what happens to some girls.

41
00:04:38,682 --> 00:04:40,747
- Did you tell anyone?
- Gran.

42
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:43,881
She ran him off and
never spoke to him again.

43
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,655
- Her own brother.
- It wasn't your fault.

44
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:50,068
I know that.

45
00:04:53,062 --> 00:04:53,912
But...

46
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:57,316
Here I am.

47
00:04:58,641 --> 00:04:59,643
I mean...

48
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,998
Just had one of the most
important experiences

49
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:05,135
in a girl's life.

50
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,458
And...

51
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,439
It was

52
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,037
so, so perfect.

53
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:14,031
Great.

54
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:16,350
I hate that...

55
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:21,183
I can't not think about him.

56
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:34,446
You think about whatever
you think about.

57
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,304
It's okay.

58
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:41,466
You're safe with me.

59
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:52,892
<i>You motherfuckers
gonna have to be...</i>

60
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:54,213
<i>patient.</i>

61
00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:59,745
There's good things coming your way.

62
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:04,064
This ain't Christmas morning,

63
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:07,033
and you're all jacked
up on caffeine,

64
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:10,036
ripping off that cheap WalMart paper

65
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:11,978
to get your blender.

66
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:16,009
Whole lot of creativity
went into this package

67
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:18,047
and I want you to enjoy...

68
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,132
Motherfucker.

69
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,449
- Back up the truck, man.
- Don't fuckin' creep, bitch.

70
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:24,847
You're fuckin' creepin'.
What the fuck you doin' here?

71
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,847
I just need to get some more V.

72
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:30,223
I need you to run your ass

73
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:32,937
out of my goddamn doorway,
'cause I'm fuckin' workin'.

74
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:35,714
Come on, buddy.
I just need a little.

75
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,673
- I told you not to take too much.
- Yeah, I know.

76
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:41,468
And you wound up in the hospital.

77
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:43,904
I said keep quiet
about where it came from,

78
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:46,706
and you fuckin' ran off
at the mouth to Tara.

79
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:49,417
Then you got vamped up
and fuckin' threw a cop around.

80
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:51,037
You can't handle the shit, buddy.

81
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:53,219
Look, I will pay however you want.

82
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:56,961
I'll even show my
wiener on your website.

83
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:59,085
You can take your
little stumpy white dick

84
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:01,882
and get the fuck up out my
joint. That's what I want.

85
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:07,227
And what you gonna do?

86
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,641
You gonna call the law?

87
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:15,825
Fuck. What'cha got?

88
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:19,072
Don't fuckin' fuck me,
motherfucker. Hear me?

89
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:21,735
'Cause I will fuck your ass up.
You get me?

90
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:24,992
Get the fuck up outa here.

91
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:29,520
Oh, can you at least tell me
where I can find some more?

92
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,918
Go to the fuckin' morgue,
'cause that's where you're goin'.

93
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:33,697
Get the fuck outa here.

94
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:36,946
Bitch.

95
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:49,180
This is where I spend my days.

96
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:57,132
Does anyone ever get
in there with you?

97
00:07:58,765 --> 00:08:00,532
This is not a place for you.

98
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:05,304
So we can never sleep
beside each other.

99
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:10,876
No one else knows where I rest.

100
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:06,546
<i>What does it mean to accept
Jesus as your personal savior?</i>

101
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,083
We'll write a check for the electric
and put it in the water envelope

102
00:09:10,203 --> 00:09:13,153
then stick the check for the water bill
in the electric envelope.

103
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:15,889
They'll both think it was a
mistake and call about it.

104
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:18,210
Then we'll be in the clear
for another month.

105
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:23,023
I need 445 dollars.

106
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,166
No way, Mama. We are broke.

107
00:09:26,286 --> 00:09:29,208
I need it to exorcise
the demons living inside of me.

108
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:31,503
You need to do what
normal people do.

109
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:33,840
Stop drinking and go to AA meetin's.

110
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:36,495
I'm not a group person,
and the demon knows that.

111
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:38,662
Does the demon know
you spike your coffee?

112
00:09:38,782 --> 00:09:40,847
- I can smell it from here.
- I can't help it.

113
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:43,650
The demon told me to finish off
everything in the house today.

114
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,619
It doesn't want me to get exorcised.

115
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:47,888
Yeah, next time you and
your demon have a little chat,

116
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:50,035
you can tell it to go out
and get a damn job.

117
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:51,725
The demon has a job.

118
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,757
Going after people that
are weak but still have faith.

119
00:09:55,482 --> 00:09:57,326
It's a jealous demon

120
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:00,004
and knows how close I am to Jesus.
That's why it picked me.

121
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:00,978
Oh my God.

122
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:03,313
Don't you dare
take the Lord's name in vain.

123
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,481
Tara, honey...

124
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:16,094
I know I wasn't the best mother.

125
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,193
I fucked up a lot

126
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:22,097
and I'm sorry.

127
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,591
I want to do this
for the both of us.

128
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:28,422
That's why I talked
her down fifty dollars.

129
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:33,385
Please help me with this.

130
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:35,629
Please.

131
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:37,306
Mama.

132
00:10:39,108 --> 00:10:42,980
- Put down that coffee and look at me.
- It's the demon drinkin', not me.

133
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:44,772
- Gimme that!
- What the...?

134
00:10:44,932 --> 00:10:46,613
- Don't spill it!
- Mama!

135
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:57,158
It's the demon!

136
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:00,992
It's the demon!

137
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:29,983
- Fuck.
- What are you doin'?

138
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,527
Nothin'.

139
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:45,325
You went ahead and did it,
huh? My own sister.

140
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,756
Nothin' but a damn fangbanger.

141
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:50,877
Now, you saved it all these years
for a fuckin' vampire?

142
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:52,630
- He is a gentleman.
- He bit you.

143
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:55,283
He doesn't hit me, which is
more than I can say for you.

144
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:57,928
I tried to apologize for
that, but you wouldn't let me.

145
00:11:58,088 --> 00:11:59,805
What are you doin' with that{\Gran's candlesticks}?

146
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:02,181
I'm just takin' half of what's mine.

147
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:04,142
It were her wedding
present from her mother.

148
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:07,311
- I need the money.
- For what? You have a job and a house.

149
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:10,030
Sook, it's none of your business.

150
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:13,333
Gran might have spoiled
you rotten, but I won't.

151
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:17,022
This is my house now.
You put those things down and get out.

152
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,875
You were gonna sell her jewelry?

153
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:38,414
Hey, dog.

154
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:45,452
Goddamn son of a bitchin'
shit ass fuckin' trailer!

155
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:52,740
What are... What are you doin' comin'
in here like you own the place?

156
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,811
Better?
Or you want me to call?

157
00:12:58,502 --> 00:13:00,812
Hi, Sam, it's me,
the girl you've been fuckin'.

158
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:03,083
Mind if I drop by to
interrupt your cussin' spell,

159
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:06,373
- say hi to you and your little dog?
- Yeah, I do mind.

160
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:10,086
Last time I saw you, you left me
high and dry in some fleabag motel

161
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,084
I had to.

162
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:13,973
That wasn't the first time. I don't have
time for that kind of bullshit.

163
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,965
Maybe I'm not in that big a hurry
to get somethin' goin' with my boss.

164
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:19,093
Then why the hell are you here?

165
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,429
And it was your big idea
to have sex, not mine.

166
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,222
- Don't act like this{\you didn't want to}!
- I hired you

167
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:26,515
after you got fired from every place!
You throw being your boss in my face?

168
00:13:26,676 --> 00:13:28,708
Don't treat me like
I'm some kind of asshole!

169
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:31,611
Did you honestly think I'd sleep
with you if I thought that?

170
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:33,413
I have no idea what
the fuck you think,

171
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:35,715
but I think you better
give me one good reason

172
00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:38,084
not to throw you outa right now.

173
00:13:40,243 --> 00:13:41,808
I'm no good at this.

174
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,209
Try harder.

175
00:13:49,526 --> 00:13:50,802
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,201
I don't know how to be
with somebody.

177
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:56,709
I never...

178
00:13:58,325 --> 00:14:00,175
Maybe I'm unboyfriendable.

179
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:05,579
I'm just in a shitty mood.

180
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,013
'Cause of me?

181
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,652
I don't want that.

182
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:11,611
No, it's not you. It's just...

183
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:14,854
This trailer's fallin'
down around me.

184
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,826
Well, at least you're
not living with your mother.

185
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:22,329
Do your folks ever ask you
for money for some stupid ass shit

186
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:24,564
they dreamed up
that you think is crazy?

187
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:26,466
My family's not close.

188
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:27,904
You're lucky.

189
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:33,859
You need a Robertson's screwdriver.

190
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:38,301
How would you know
somethin' like that?

191
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:40,347
No daddy and a drunk mom.

192
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:42,758
All the fixin' fell to me.

193
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:49,241
Place would look good with a...
With a little work.

194
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:07,526
Speakin'.
Who is this?

195
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:11,580
What?

196
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,676
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Thornton,
but it is against bank policy

197
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:18,585
to extend a loan for an exorcism.

198
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:20,687
We both know what's goin' on here.

199
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:22,798
You won't give me a loan
'cause you're a bigot.

200
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:26,344
Many of our clients
are African-American.

201
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,728
You sayin' that
just proves my point.

202
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:31,498
I ain't talkin' about the
color of my skin, but you is.

203
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:33,934
Well, now that is
simply not the case.

204
00:15:34,054 --> 00:15:37,837
We have recently accepted a client
who is a vampire-American.

205
00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:41,341
I don't care who give loans
to if not Lettie Mae Thornton.

206
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:44,612
You are prejudiced against me
because I am a Christian.

207
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:46,870
What? No, I teach Sunday school.

208
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:50,785
Then you know what I'm talkin' about.
The whole world is against us.

209
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:53,320
They even try
and take away Christmas.

210
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:56,839
This is your chance to stop
that persecution in its tracks.

211
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,192
Show Jesus you have
a charitable nature.

212
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,127
A bank is not a charity.

213
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:04,397
Maybe Mister Gus just don't
like women, is that it?

214
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:06,091
No, what...

215
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:07,934
No. I mean, yes, I...

216
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,950
Then let's you and me
work somethin' out.

217
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,564
My landlord don't mind if a get
a little behind in my rent.

218
00:16:13,684 --> 00:16:16,102
No, I think we need to
terminate this conversation.

219
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:20,146
There may be snow on the mountaintop,
but there's fire in the valley.

220
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:21,858
What the hell, Mama?

221
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:25,611
This white devil tried
to sexual harass me!

222
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:27,864
I'm gonna sue his narrow ass!

223
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,406
I assure you, ma'am.

224
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:31,451
What are you doin' ?
Trying to borrow money,

225
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:34,370
'cause I got a daughter who want
me to live a demon inside of me!

226
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,264
Mama, there is no demon.
You just have an addiction.

227
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,751
I can feel it in me right now!
Nobody believes me!

228
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:46,382
I do not want to live
like this no more!

229
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:50,513
I can't!

230
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,379
I gotta go lay down.

231
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,598
That demon's gnawin'
at me somethin' awful.

232
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:12,051
You need to drink some water.

233
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:08,673
I'm paying you to cook,
not beat on customers.

234
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:10,290
I want a motherfucking raise.

235
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,440
I'll think about it, but 'til then,
no trouble. We're gettin' busy.

236
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,295
Tara called.
She ain't comin' in.

237
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,517
What?

238
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:19,684
Hell, we're already
short a waitress.

239
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:22,495
Don't worry, Sam.
We'll make it work.

240
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,171
Well, goddamn.

241
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:27,470
Look at you. All pornalicious.

242
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:30,443
What kind of crazy mix you
done and got yourself into?

243
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:33,647
Can't I just be in a good mood
without it being a big deal?

244
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:35,549
It's a pretty night outside,

245
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:38,051
and I'm glad to be
enjoying it with my friends.

246
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:45,793
It's me.

247
00:18:46,576 --> 00:18:47,962
Hey. Who's me?

248
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:52,799
Like you don't know.

249
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:58,038
- How's it goin'?
- <i>Well, I'm at Merlotte's,</i>

250
00:18:58,158 --> 00:19:00,979
and I'm just waitin'
for you to come on down

251
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:02,644
and buy me a drink.

252
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:05,980
I ain't comin' to
Merlotte's tonight.

253
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:09,138
You ain't avoidin' me, are you?

254
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:13,117
'Cause that's shit's not gonna fly,
cowboy. Not after the other night.

255
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:15,288
Of course not.

256
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:17,867
It's just that I'm going into
Shreveport tonight, that's all.

257
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:19,426
Can I come?

258
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:21,061
Sure.

259
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:24,624
I want to go to that vampire bar.
You know where it's at?

260
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:32,673
I may not know much, but I do know
better than to associate

261
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,941
<i>myself with people
of low moral character.</i>

262
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:36,968
- Oh, okay.
- <i>I hope you enjoy spending</i>

263
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:40,148
eternity in hell!
Asshole!

264
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,619
Will you run that to them crackers.

265
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:04,253
- Sure thing.
- Thank you so much.

266
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:07,560
Don't you look nice tonight.

267
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:10,670
- I love how you did your hair.
- Well, thank you.

268
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:14,674
Honey. That scarf is double cute.

269
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:19,319
There's something
different about you.

270
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,621
You need to tell me
what is goin' on.

271
00:20:22,272 --> 00:20:23,586
Is it a man?

272
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:27,109
I'm not really comfortable
discussing my personal business.

273
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:28,479
Especially not here.

274
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:31,357
Everyone else's
personal life is open to you.

275
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:35,121
I forgive you 'cause I know
you can't help that,

276
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:38,672
but it does make being
your friend kinda lopsided.

277
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:44,871
Please tell me it was
Sam, not that vampire.

278
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:46,957
Yes, it was Bill.

279
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:49,926
And I think I might
be in love with him.

280
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:51,685
Don't tell anybody, okay?

281
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:53,916
Goddamn it!

282
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:55,352
Fuck!

283
00:20:56,432 --> 00:20:57,753
Sook, order up.

284
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,657
Sookie has been with that vampire.

285
00:21:06,145 --> 00:21:08,768
- That's just bar talk.
- She told me so herself.

286
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:11,516
Oh my Lord. Suppose
she gets pregnant.

287
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:14,174
How in the world can she
nurse a baby with fangs?

288
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,544
You just be her friend.
She need one now more than ever.

289
00:21:18,689 --> 00:21:20,847
There you go. You're gonna
love that okra special.

290
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:24,142
It's so fresh, it'll hop
right off your plate.

291
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,077
Don't go anywhere. I need two Bud.

292
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:28,555
You keep your hands
to yourself, Sam Merlotte.

293
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:31,783
- You have no right to touch me.
- You're a damn fool, you know that?

294
00:21:34,547 --> 00:21:37,230
What I do on my own time
is no concern of yours.

295
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,674
Or any of y'all's.

296
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:40,782
Yes, I had sex with Bill,

297
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:44,070
and since every one of y'all's
too chicken to ask, it was great.

298
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:46,373
I enjoyed every second of it.

299
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:49,476
And if you don't like that,
you can just fire me!

300
00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:10,242
Your mama know you're
out in the big city?

301
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,916
- Well, my mama's dead.
- So am I.

302
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:16,169
Let me see some ID.

303
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:26,379
Jason Stackhouse from Bon Temps?

304
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,262
- You related to Sookie by any chance?
- Yeah. She's my sister.

305
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:34,874
Well, how do you know her?

306
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:37,357
She stands out. Do you?

307
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,842
Maybe.

308
00:22:41,054 --> 00:22:42,571
In other ways.

309
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:47,068
- Why are you here?
- Why?

310
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:49,688
Well, you know, I was...
I heard it was cool.

311
00:22:49,808 --> 00:22:52,639
I wanted to check it out,
see what's up.

312
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,294
I'm one of those
open-minded kind of guys.

313
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,756
Tell me why you came here.

314
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:12,101
I want some vampire blood.

315
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:15,622
What time do you get off work?

316
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:19,118
You came for my blood?

317
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:22,329
Yes, you're right.

318
00:23:24,506 --> 00:23:26,389
You're nothing like your sister.

319
00:23:29,897 --> 00:23:30,900
Go on in.

320
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:38,688
And good luck gettin' out.

321
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,055
I don't keep cash in the house.

322
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,265
I'm not here for money.

323
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,362
I'm here for Sookie.

324
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:26,132
Damn. I'm gettin'
eaten alive out here.

325
00:24:26,252 --> 00:24:28,382
You want to meet the devil,
wait at the crossroad.

326
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:29,637
That was a mile back.

327
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:31,971
For Miss Jeanette, you gotta
go past where the devil's at.

328
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:34,711
That is the biggest load
of bullshit I ever heard.

329
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:37,310
You're gettin' as bad off
as Lafayette and his juju.

330
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,981
My poor sister. I pity havin' to raise
a sexual devia.

331
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:43,550
That runs in families,
you know, like demons.

332
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,957
You showed up.

333
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:48,021
I figured that demon
of yours wouldn't let'cha.

334
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,876
You must be Tara.

335
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,076
I'm Miss Jeanette.

336
00:24:56,565 --> 00:24:57,598
You ready?

337
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:00,960
Fully prepared body and
soul for this exorcism?

338
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,087
I didn't eat anything
all day, like you said.

339
00:25:03,256 --> 00:25:04,546
Have you made your peace?

340
00:25:05,152 --> 00:25:06,390
Is it gonna hurt?

341
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,968
Of course it's gonna hurt.

342
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:11,095
It's like childbirth.

343
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,603
Except the demon
don't want to come out,

344
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,519
and it ain't your body
that could get ripped up.

345
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:18,352
It's your soul.

346
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:24,601
In olden days, folks paid my grandmama
using tobacco and livestock.

347
00:25:25,861 --> 00:25:27,243
But today it's cash.

348
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:30,659
In advance.

349
00:25:42,228 --> 00:25:45,754
That demon will not
inhabit you after tonight.

350
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,767
Let's get this shit over with.

351
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,544
Lettie Mae, you're gonna
need to undress now.

352
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,379
<i>It felt like...</i>

353
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,833
Itfelt like every single care

354
00:26:39,953 --> 00:26:43,103
or worry or sadness
I ever had was just

355
00:26:43,223 --> 00:26:44,671
flowing out of me into him.

356
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,916
And, yeah, that hurt at first, but

357
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,662
then when I relaxed,
didn't hurt at all.

358
00:26:53,073 --> 00:26:55,640
I was always too scared
to let 'em bite me.

359
00:26:56,568 --> 00:26:58,664
I don't know, Sook,
I just think that

360
00:26:59,864 --> 00:27:02,080
when there's blood involved,
a line been crossed.

361
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:06,192
Oh, I definitely crossed a line,
but I'm glad I did.

362
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:08,762
Well, you go ahead on
cookin' with your bad ass.

363
00:27:08,882 --> 00:27:10,143
Good for you.

364
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:13,500
It ain't possible to live
unless you crossin' somebody's line.

365
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:19,032
Skank.

366
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:32,568
Excuse me.

367
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,781
May I take a picture of you?

368
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:40,279
You may.

369
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,583
No pictures.

370
00:27:47,442 --> 00:27:50,128
- He said I could take it.
- I did not say you could keep it.

371
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,058
Pretty good dancer.

372
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:05,076
Can I get you another?

373
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:09,655
But I will have somethin' stronger.

374
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,779
Not Tru-Blood, but really strong.
You know what I'm sayin'?

375
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,948
We've got Kentucky
straight bourbon, whiskey.

376
00:28:18,173 --> 00:28:20,433
Hundred proof. It'll turn the
lining right off your stomach.

377
00:28:20,553 --> 00:28:22,661
Uh, yeah. Somethin'
stronger than that.

378
00:28:23,063 --> 00:28:24,507
But you know, a different color?

379
00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:26,758
Just tell me what the
fuck you want, little boy.

380
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:28,649
Somethin' closer to
the color of the walls.

381
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:30,717
- There you are, hon.
- You know what I'm sayin'.

382
00:28:30,837 --> 00:28:32,004
- Come sit.
- Hang on.

383
00:28:32,164 --> 00:28:35,282
- Why don't you hold on a minute?
- I know what you're looking for.

384
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,257
- Come into...
- Goddamn.

385
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:40,345
- It's hotter than hell in here.
- No, it's an icebox.

386
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:42,264
You're sweating for another reason.

387
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:44,591
- I could use some V.
- Hey, V-Eight.

388
00:28:44,711 --> 00:28:46,518
I don't think that
they serve that here.

389
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,247
- Why the fuck would I want V-Eight?
- Hey, shut up.

390
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:53,316
Listen, they can hear really well.
Alright, so let's talk about it later.

391
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,070
Alright? Let's get out of here
before you get us both killed.

392
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,006
I ain't goin' nowhere
until I get what I came for.

393
00:29:02,214 --> 00:29:04,082
Purse? Let's do it.

394
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:09,458
<i>What kind of stupid bitch would
go and do something like that?</i>

395
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:11,399
Something like what, Royce?

396
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:15,021
- Fuck a vampire.
- Fuck a vampire?

397
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:17,512
Hell, no. I like my meat alive.

398
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:31,531
Well, hey there, sugar.

399
00:29:48,073 --> 00:29:51,424
- Get us three Tru-Bloods.
- Y'all need to go somewhere else.

400
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:54,043
This is a family place.
Locals only.

401
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,546
We just closed
on a place up the road,

402
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,633
so that makes us official
citizens of Renard Parish.

403
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:03,503
- We're the new locals.
- My place, my rules.

404
00:30:03,944 --> 00:30:05,906
Discrimination against vampires

405
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:09,042
is punishable by law in
the great State of Louisiana.

406
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:11,615
Personally, I don't give a fuck,

407
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:14,439
but I am thirsty.

408
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:18,251
You are not welcome here.

409
00:30:19,938 --> 00:30:22,906
That shit only works
in a private home.

410
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,786
How nice to see you again, Sookie.

411
00:30:29,197 --> 00:30:30,871
You are looking
delectable as always.

412
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:33,400
- You know them?
- We've met.

413
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:38,463
It looks like little Miss Holdout
has given up the goods.

414
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:40,106
<i>Brava.</i>

415
00:30:40,765 --> 00:30:42,842
Did he leave enough
for the rest of us?

416
00:30:43,002 --> 00:30:44,219
I am his.

417
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:47,787
Well, he is not here, is he?

418
00:30:48,987 --> 00:30:50,697
And while Bill's away,

419
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,047
Malcolm will always play.

420
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:04,998
Don't you think for one second
I'd ever have anything to do with you.

421
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:07,951
You were trash while you were alive,
and now you're just dead trash.

422
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:11,071
I'm gonna drain you so slowly,
you're gonna beg me to kill you.

423
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,914
Jihad this, motherfucker!

424
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,655
- You are a dead man.
- Maybe.

425
00:31:22,775 --> 00:31:24,676
But I'm gonna take
one of y'all with me.

426
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:33,293
I'm gonna reach down your throat
and yank you inside out by your dick.

427
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:34,845
Please leave him alone!

428
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:36,396
Stop this!

429
00:31:38,098 --> 00:31:38,964
Now!

430
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:44,554
You're here for me, not them.

431
00:31:44,674 --> 00:31:47,656
We had to get your attention,
and I do believe it worked.

432
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:52,655
What do you want?

433
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,446
You never call me back.

434
00:31:55,285 --> 00:31:58,494
Now, if I remembered
what feelings were, mine might be hurt.

435
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:02,741
Join our nest, Bill.

436
00:32:05,062 --> 00:32:06,459
Forget these blood sacks.

437
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,183
Mainstreamin's for pussies.

438
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,433
Let's party like we used to, huh?

439
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:18,057
We used to have so much fun.

440
00:32:21,195 --> 00:32:22,228
Alright.

441
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:26,880
- Let's go.
- Bill, what are you doin'?

442
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:29,616
- I should be with my own.
- But you're not like them.

443
00:32:29,736 --> 00:32:31,786
You're better than they'll ever be.

444
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:35,754
I am not human, Sookie.

445
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:37,999
I am vampire.

446
00:32:58,805 --> 00:33:01,581
Well, that ain't right, him
comin' in here like that.

447
00:33:02,008 --> 00:33:04,017
Ain't right them things even exist.

448
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:06,672
Well, it is a full moon tonight.

449
00:33:16,683 --> 00:33:18,665
Let's take the V
and go to a roadhouse.

450
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:20,209
Not so fast, dude.

451
00:33:20,543 --> 00:33:22,435
The setting is crucial.

452
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:25,505
You know, just breathe deep.
Think about something that you like.

453
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:27,357
Sunrise on the Gulf.

454
00:33:28,648 --> 00:33:30,710
- I never get up that early.
- Well,

455
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:32,724
something beautiful then.

456
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,227
You know, whatever you think
is relaxing and nice.

457
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,724
How about you?

458
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:44,232
I'm Amy Burley.

459
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,295
Pleased to meet you.

460
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:52,259
- Where you from?
- Storrs, Connecticut originally.

461
00:33:52,721 --> 00:33:54,668
You know,
I knew that you'd drive a truck.

462
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:57,605
- I knew it. I bet you work outside{\, too}.
- Maybe.

463
00:33:58,254 --> 00:34:00,285
Or maybe I run a store at the mall.

464
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:04,412
Really, I'm a doctor.

465
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:08,000
- What's your specialty?
- Legs.

466
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:09,679
I'm a leg doctor.

467
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:12,067
Doc, I love this truck.

468
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:15,096
I do. It's authentic.
You know, it's how a truck should be.

469
00:34:15,256 --> 00:34:17,931
None of that stupid extended cab,

470
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:20,310
four wheel drive just to go
to the mall crap.

471
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:24,648
How much V you got?

472
00:34:25,557 --> 00:34:27,060
How far to your place?

473
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:28,717
Get in.

474
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:38,958
- Where'd you learn how to do this?
- I learned from my mama.

475
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:42,457
And she learned from hers and so on,

476
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:45,490
going back a thousand years.

477
00:34:48,077 --> 00:34:50,381
Now, we're gonna lure this demon out

478
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:52,284
- and then...
- Lure it out?

479
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,210
With a bunch of rocks?

480
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:57,672
Don't you need a Ouija board
and some chicken bones?

481
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:59,098
- Shut up.
- It's my money.

482
00:34:59,258 --> 00:35:01,027
- But it's my demon.
- Look!

483
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,843
I know you love your daughter.

484
00:35:07,828 --> 00:35:09,660
And I know you love your mama,

485
00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:11,962
or else you wouldn't be here.

486
00:35:13,907 --> 00:35:16,185
But this is a serious situation

487
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:19,198
for all of us.

488
00:35:19,475 --> 00:35:21,072
Demons can kill.

489
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:25,466
And this one will given
half a chance.

490
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,741
Y'all need to calm down.

491
00:35:39,149 --> 00:35:40,711
The sacred crone-stone.

492
00:35:41,283 --> 00:35:43,608
It's been in my family since Africa.

493
00:35:44,493 --> 00:35:47,428
My generation was twelve kids,

494
00:35:48,434 --> 00:35:50,665
but the stone chose me.

495
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:01,007
You ain't puttin' that thing
on my mama.

496
00:36:01,127 --> 00:36:03,121
Soon as that demon
leaves your mother,

497
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:05,402
it'll be lookin' for
a new place to stay.

498
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:07,625
Come on.
We all gonna have to be still.

499
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:09,605
Don't even breathe.

500
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,150
Let it find the possum.

501
00:36:37,806 --> 00:36:41,246
"Sing a crone-stone song.

502
00:36:42,221 --> 00:36:45,168
"Sing what land made me.

503
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:49,208
"Dream tinker is my drum.

504
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,920
"I hold the power

505
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,320
"of the stone,

506
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,949
"the water,

507
00:36:56,526 --> 00:36:57,547
"the leaf,

508
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,027
"the dirt.

509
00:36:59,493 --> 00:37:03,389
"Stone, water, leaf, dirt.

510
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:05,308
"Sing a demon song.

511
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,001
"Sing the night made you.

"Dark and wet.

"Hungry and cold.

"Trapped in darkness forever,

00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,280
"lonely for the light.

"You are safe here.

517
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:23,784
"Safe and welcome.

518
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:26,141
"Safe and welcome.

519
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,917
"By the power of the stone,
I bid you depart

520
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:35,171
"and join the world of light!"

521
00:38:06,507 --> 00:38:07,544
I froze up.

522
00:38:07,664 --> 00:38:09,636
I let everybody down.
I didn't do nothin'.

523
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:11,752
This ain't Baghdad, Terry.

524
00:38:12,997 --> 00:38:14,817
It's Merlotte's, okay?

525
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:19,053
Ain't nothin' anybody coulda' done.

526
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,821
I'm supposed to.

527
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,150
I know where that house
they bought is at.

528
00:38:30,397 --> 00:38:31,923
About four miles away,

529
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:34,203
right at the edge of town.

530
00:38:34,323 --> 00:38:35,838
It'd be easy to sneak up on 'em.

531
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:37,915
If you think you can sneak up
on a vampire,

532
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:40,286
then y'all are dumber in the head
than a hog is in the butt.

533
00:38:40,406 --> 00:38:42,615
Fuckin' a vampire
don't make you no expert.

534
00:38:42,735 --> 00:38:44,471
You're contaminated
from normal people.

535
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:46,279
What would you know
about normal people?

536
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:48,150
I know they don't fuck dead things.

537
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,982
You mess with Bill Compton.

538
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:52,865
I promise, you will be a dead thing.

539
00:38:56,205 --> 00:38:58,626
We gotta do somethin'.
These rednecks are gettin' riled up.

540
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:00,687
They're talkin' about going
after the vampires.

541
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:03,542
- That's not my problem.
- I hope they kill 'em all.

542
00:39:04,054 --> 00:39:06,519
- Bill is not like them.
- He went with 'em.

543
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,679
- To get them away from here.
- Doesn't matter.

544
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:11,559
- He belongs with his own kind.
- My God, are you listening to yourself?

545
00:39:13,214 --> 00:39:15,367
Whatever goes on between you
and him's your business,

546
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:17,729
but I do not want him in my bar.

547
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,288
<i>Weren't for little Stackhouse bitch,</i>

548
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:23,101
<i>there wouldn't be no vampires
comin' around here at all. </i>

549
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:26,448
<i>Round 'em all up at daybreak
and shoot the sunlight into 'em. </i>

550
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,290
I went to Wellesley.

551
00:39:28,677 --> 00:39:32,335
I was supposed to do pre-law but I said
screw it, I studied philosophy instead

552
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:35,425
and that pissed
the parental units off big time,

553
00:39:36,012 --> 00:39:38,956
as if the meaning
of life's just irrelevant, right?

554
00:39:39,884 --> 00:39:43,113
I got two years
at Vo-Tech studyin'...

555
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,202
landscape technology.

556
00:39:45,627 --> 00:39:48,554
I couldn't take anymore
of that artificial lockjaw lifestyle,

557
00:39:48,714 --> 00:39:50,845
- so hit the road.
- Lockjaw?

558
00:39:50,965 --> 00:39:52,062
Like rabies?

559
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:55,317
No, it's talking with your teeth
clenched together

560
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:57,225
so you don't get lines in your face.

561
00:39:57,345 --> 00:39:59,995
"Amy, please tell me
you're not having sex

562
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:02,365
with that disgusting man."

563
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,810
People who talk that way
don't want anyone to know

564
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,128
- they got their teeth knocked out.
- Where are your CD's?

565
00:40:08,248 --> 00:40:10,409
- They're over there.
- Where's the V at?

566
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:14,027
I love your place, man.
It's very unselfconscious.

567
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:16,467
- So off the grid.
- It was my parents house.

568
00:40:16,587 --> 00:40:18,840
Haven't really done much
with the place since they passed.

569
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,308
That's even better.

570
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:23,864
I mean, this place goes back
to like a more legitimate time,

571
00:40:23,984 --> 00:40:26,611
you know, before everything
got totally out of whack.

572
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:28,555
Your parents are part of Gaia.

573
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,210
You know what Gaia is,
right? Theory of Gaia?

574
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:37,177
The Earth is a living organism.

575
00:40:37,993 --> 00:40:40,436
Makes weather, which is good for us.

576
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:44,033
Plants give us the chemicals we need.
Everything is connected.

577
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:45,711
But you know that.

578
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:48,991
I don't like how they keep

579
00:40:49,111 --> 00:40:52,089
taking stuff away.
Like Pluto's not a planet anymore

580
00:40:52,524 --> 00:40:54,578
and a brontosaurus
stopped being a dinosaur.

581
00:40:54,698 --> 00:40:57,705
You can't say somethin' stopped being
what it's always been.

582
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:01,109
- Do you live by yourself?
- Yeah.

583
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,505
Come on, let's do the V's.

584
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:06,215
Slow down, baby.

585
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:09,375
Do you even know how
this stuff works?

586
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:13,607
It's blood. It carries
oxygen to our organs, right?

587
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:16,721
And that's what makes them function.
So it keeps us goin'.

588
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,727
It's like gas in a car engine.

589
00:41:19,982 --> 00:41:20,985
Vampires,

590
00:41:21,657 --> 00:41:25,206
they don't need oxygen. Everything
just runs directly off the blood.

591
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:28,248
Ah, like those cars
that run on corn.

592
00:41:29,513 --> 00:41:31,240
I've had this blood for like

593
00:41:31,883 --> 00:41:33,045
forever, so

594
00:41:33,473 --> 00:41:36,036
we're gonna need to take some steps
to keep it from coagulating.

595
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:37,933
Coagulating?

596
00:41:39,338 --> 00:41:40,338
Aspirin.

597
00:41:40,505 --> 00:41:41,505
Insert.

598
00:41:42,224 --> 00:41:44,128
We'll get the full effect faster

599
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,800
and more intense.

600
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:56,075
You just know

601
00:41:56,783 --> 00:41:59,448
this is what Holy Communion
is symbolic of.

602
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,009
This is the real deal here.

603
00:42:02,628 --> 00:42:03,635
None of that

604
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:06,028
lame ass empty ritual.

605
00:42:07,644 --> 00:42:09,236
This is nature's greatest gift.

606
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,871
- I thought they'd get all mushy.
- See, the V adapts.

607
00:42:19,256 --> 00:42:20,808
It wants to be in us.

608
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:43,294
We honor Gaia

609
00:42:43,658 --> 00:42:46,356
and seek the deepest
relationship to her.

610
00:42:52,035 --> 00:42:53,035
Me too.

611
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,539
And Pluto can start being
a planet again,

612
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:58,018
connected to stuff.

613
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:02,414
By taking the blood of
the night into our bodies,

614
00:43:02,575 --> 00:43:04,701
we water the flowers of our souls.

615
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:08,212
Nothing is real.

616
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:10,593
Everything is permitted.

617
00:44:12,552 --> 00:44:13,762
Damn it, Bill.

618
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:15,680
Please pick up.

619
00:44:17,033 --> 00:44:19,335
<i>- Bill Compton.
- To leave a voice message,</i>

620
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:22,191
<i>press 1 or just wait for the tone. </i>

621
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:25,147
Bill, this is
the third time I've called.

622
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:27,014
A lynch mob is going
after those vampires.

623
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:29,619
You gotta get outa there.
Call me back now.

624
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:31,657
<i>When you finish recording,
you may hang up</i>

625
00:44:31,777 --> 00:44:33,761
<i>or press pound for more options. </i>

626
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,562
I know, right.

627
00:46:04,964 --> 00:46:08,521
I can't believe I spent 400 dollars
to watch you drown a damn possum.

628
00:46:08,868 --> 00:46:10,810
You better not have done
anything bad to my mama.

629
00:46:11,114 --> 00:46:12,840
Is my demon gone forever?

630
00:46:13,577 --> 00:46:14,731
That one is.

631
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:17,044
- I got another one?
- No.

632
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:19,926
You belong to yourself now.

633
00:46:20,686 --> 00:46:22,864
But we're gonna have to do
somethin' about your daughter.

634
00:46:23,024 --> 00:46:24,741
You ain't gonna do nothin' for me.

635
00:46:25,245 --> 00:46:26,251
Your demon

636
00:46:26,672 --> 00:46:28,841
isn't the same kind
as your mother's,

637
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,081
but it's definitely living in you.

638
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:33,609
Now you think I got
a motherfuckin' demon?

639
00:46:33,729 --> 00:46:35,405
Bitch, you as fucked up as your bus.

640
00:46:35,525 --> 00:46:38,213
That's that demon talkin' right now.

641
00:46:39,182 --> 00:46:41,341
And deep down inside,
you know it's true.

642
00:46:41,501 --> 00:46:42,646
No, I do not.

643
00:46:44,355 --> 00:46:45,600
I can help you.

644
00:46:45,835 --> 00:46:47,138
I don't want help.

645
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:50,266
I don't need it,
and I sure as hell can't afford it.

646
00:46:52,835 --> 00:46:54,479
Do you have many friends?

647
00:46:57,694 --> 00:46:59,690
Do you have trouble keeping a job?

648
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,700
You have your own place?

649
00:47:05,814 --> 00:47:07,258
You have a boyfriend?

650
00:47:09,502 --> 00:47:11,996
How long have you ever been
with the same man?

651
00:47:20,878 --> 00:47:22,522
Find me when you're ready.

652
00:47:24,744 --> 00:47:26,306
Let's go. Come on, Mama.

653
00:48:43,013 --> 00:48:45,215
- What are you doin'?
- Turning this shit into napalm.

654
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:47,212
I ain't taking no chances.

655
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:51,385
Alright, boys.
I'm gonna take the front porch.

656
00:48:51,649 --> 00:48:53,348
You {\boys}go around back
to the back windows.

657
00:48:53,508 --> 00:48:54,561
Which windows?

658
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:57,310
- Don't matter, fucktard.
- You'll fuckin' spill it.

659
00:48:59,907 --> 00:49:01,877
You wait 'til you hear me
break the glass.

660
00:49:01,997 --> 00:49:02,997
Alright?

661
00:49:15,423 --> 00:49:16,456
Go! Go!

662
00:49:22,488 --> 00:49:23,521
Hurry up!

663
00:49:24,346 --> 00:49:25,463
Go! Go!

664
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:31,135
Stop running, dipshit!

665
00:49:53,308 --> 00:49:55,159
Bet you didn't do
much fishin' in Iraq.

666
00:49:55,677 --> 00:49:57,532
No fish in the sandbox.

667
00:49:58,988 --> 00:50:01,002
No wonder
they're so pissed off at us.

668
00:50:01,122 --> 00:50:03,668
We got channel cats
and Shreveport poontang.

669
00:50:04,945 --> 00:50:06,178
I missed this.

670
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:09,257
Gettin' up before dawn
like when we were kids,

671
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:10,857
watch the sun comin' up.

672
00:50:24,974 --> 00:50:26,544
That was Sam Merlotte.

673
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,292
I done that before.

674
00:50:32,585 --> 00:50:34,262
Where the fuck was he goin'?

675
00:50:34,382 --> 00:50:35,671
Where has he been?

676
00:50:36,307 --> 00:50:37,575
Nobody cares.

677
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:46,314
Detective Bellefleur.

678
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,670
Shit.

679
00:51:11,646 --> 00:51:14,535
<i>B.T.P.D, what's goin' on.</i>

680
00:51:17,137 --> 00:51:18,846
As soon as we complete our portion,

681
00:51:18,966 --> 00:51:21,065
you can get in there
and start investigatin'.

682
00:51:21,185 --> 00:51:23,519
It's probably Arson,
and I'll say that.

683
00:51:24,158 --> 00:51:26,451
Now we know one way
to get rid of 'em.

684
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:28,804
Excuse me.

685
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,633
Special of the day,
country fried vampire.

686
00:51:33,793 --> 00:51:37,220
This'll take the heat off of them having
to find out who's killing those women.

687
00:51:37,924 --> 00:51:39,239
Is Bill in there?

688
00:51:40,874 --> 00:51:42,189
No way of knowin'.

689
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:45,895
They're awful messy,
but there was four of 'em.
