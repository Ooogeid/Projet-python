1
00:00:02,499 --> 00:00:03,756
<i>Who are these people...</i>

2
00:00:03,917 --> 00:00:06,468
<i>I cannot wait to get the hell out
of this Podunk town.</i>

3
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:08,560
Make sure you do,
and before it's too late,

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,426
- Believe me, I know.
<i>- How'd she know what I was thinking?</i>

5
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:14,444
Oh my God!

6
00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:17,020
I think Merlotte's just got
its first vampire.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,733
I think you're right.

8
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:20,523
And what can I get for you tonight?

9
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:23,485
Do you have any
of that synthetic bottled blood?

10
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:25,715
No, I'm so sorry.

11
00:00:25,945 --> 00:00:27,806
You're our first... vampire.

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,869
What the fuck is this?
You had sex with a vampire?

13
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:35,069
Once. I videotaped it.

14
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:38,116
You like this?

15
00:00:41,763 --> 00:00:45,048
You know how many people
are having sex with vampires these days?

16
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:49,129
- Can I get y'all anything else?
- <i>He's {\probably}got 11 or 12 pints in him.</i>

17
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,590
<i>Holy shit, that's almost $10,000.</i>

18
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:53,932
- We have to stop them.
- Who?

19
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:56,773
The Rattrays. They're gonna drain him
and sell his blood.

20
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:00,610
This ain't over.

21
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:04,116
What are you?

22
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:05,777
I'm a waitress.

23
00:01:06,145 --> 00:01:09,614
Guess who was found strangled
to death in her apartment?

24
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:13,186
- You know Maudette Pickens?
- We've already seen the videotape.

25
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,538
- You didn't know she was taping it?
- You need to come with us.

26
00:01:16,906 --> 00:01:19,499
- May I call on you sometime?
- Sure.

27
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,407
Would you mind meeting me around
the back of the bar when I get off?

28
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:25,296
- I have a favor to ask you.
- I'd be delighted.

29
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:39,114
Where's your fuckin' chain now?

30
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:40,780
God!

31
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:45,254
Dumb-ass ponytail.

32
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,781
Here we go.

33
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:56,560
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

34
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,336
Fuck you, Fido.

35
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:18,968
What the fuck...?

36
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:27,150
Show your fuckin' face, freak!

00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:23,307
<i>- It's too bad I don't have fangs.
- Oh, yeah!</i>

41
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:26,311
<i>Rip your fuckin' throat out.
Fuck, yeah!</i>

42
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,889
<i>Here it comes.</i>

43
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:29,780
<i>Are you ready?</i>

44
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:31,585
<i>Fuck.</i>

45
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:33,442
<i>Fuck, yeah!</i>

46
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,049
<i>That was intense, huh?</i>

47
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:05,428
Shit.

48
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,029
Fuck

49
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:09,290
Fuck!

50
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:13,252
Oh, Jesus.

51
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:31,769
<i>A moron.</i>

52
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:39,316
I didn't kill her.

53
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:45,588
I didn't kill her!

54
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:49,286
Somebody sure as hell did.

55
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:03,045
<i>A vampire?</i>

56
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:04,669
You're sure?

57
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:07,653
I saw his fangs.

58
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:11,749
Maudette had fang marks
on her inner thigh.

59
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:14,251
We know. We examined the body.

60
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:19,008
This be the same vampire
your sister's messin' around with?

61
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:20,225
First,

62
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:23,653
my sister ain't messin' around
with nobody. She don't mess around.

63
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:24,877
And second,

64
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:27,736
I don't know.

65
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:30,083
I never met the other vampire.

66
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:32,520
I never met any vampire,
I hope to hell I never do.

67
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,063
What did this vampire
on the videotape look like?

68
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,151
Bald-headed.

69
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,153
Weird skeleton tattoo.

70
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:44,115
And he looked crazy.

71
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:48,077
Crazy out of his motherfuckin' mind.

72
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,210
It's interesting, because...

73
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:56,710
this the only videotape we found
in Maudette's apartment.

74
00:06:58,146 --> 00:07:00,729
I guess that means
somebody took them all, right?

75
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:02,883
Somebody didn't
want you to see them?

76
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:06,928
Or somebody only wanted us
to find this one?

77
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:10,991
Because it supposedly
clears him of a crime

78
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:13,643
that maybe
he came back later to commit?

79
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:22,202
Come on, Andy.

80
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:25,928
I'm not that smart.

81
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,852
I can't feel my legs.

82
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:55,854
Quick, drink before
the wound closes.

83
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:58,701
- Would I be a vampire?
- You won't be. Goddamn it,

84
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:00,338
do you want to live or not?

85
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:49,691
<i>Go back to the green room.</i>

86
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:52,177
<i>Turns out I'm first
in the walk and talk challenge.</i>

87
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:54,850
<i>Walking and talking
can't be too hard, right?</i>

88
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,842
<i>B.J., your category
is Names of U.S. States.</i>

89
00:09:01,964 --> 00:09:04,195
Oh, Mother, damn.

90
00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:07,425
<i>Memphis.</i>

91
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,053
<i>New Jersey. New York. Connecticut.</i>

92
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:21,491
- Hello, Hooker. What's the T?
- Where are you?

93
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:24,275
<i>I'm on my way to a party in Monroe.</i>

94
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:28,319
And hell, no, I ain't swingin' by
to pick your needy ass up.

95
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:30,406
<i>Lafayette, please.</i>

96
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,134
My momma's passed out
on the coach, and...

97
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,539
I can't face cleaning her up
and putting her to bed.

98
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,329
It's just too goddamn depressing.

99
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:40,528
What's depressing is how often
I get this phone call from you,

100
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:41,951
that's depressing.

101
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:44,629
Why come you won't call
Jason Stackhouse?

102
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:46,892
You're a mean, nasty bitch.

103
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:49,450
<i>And you need to move your sorry
ass out your momma's house,</i>

104
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,053
- <i>that's what you need to do.</i>
- Yeah, whatever.

105
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,340
Alright.

106
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,720
Alright, I is on my way.

107
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:59,915
But you might got to find
your own ride home.

108
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:01,979
Just in case I get lucky.

109
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,771
What you mean if you get lucky?

110
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:06,442
Your standards are so low
you always get lucky.

111
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:09,046
Damn straight.

112
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:11,948
Hallelujahs, hallelujahs.

113
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:15,116
Good Lord, I'm comin'!

114
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:18,414
Jesus.

115
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:22,399
What the fuck?

116
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:27,253
Did I say you could come in?

117
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:38,220
Look, it's 3:00 in the morning.

118
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,442
You have no idea
what I've been through since last night.

119
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:47,110
I spent the whole day thinkin'
I'd really killed Maudette Pickens.

120
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:49,964
Oh, my God.

121
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:58,252
I thought I'd accidentally
strangled her during sex.

122
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:02,831
And Bud and fucking Andy waited

123
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:07,020
12 whole hours to show me a videotape
that proved I didn't do it!

124
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:15,344
I thought I'd ruined my whole life.

125
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:44,677
Do I taste different
from other people?

126
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,400
Yes.

127
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,187
What are you?

128
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,965
Apparently I'm not dead.

129
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:00,034
What I am is telepathic.

130
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,974
I can hear people's thoughts.

131
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:07,964
Even mine?

132
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,049
That's why I like you so much.

133
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,068
I can't hear you at all.

134
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:19,987
You have no idea how peaceful it is
after a lifetime of...

135
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,425
May I ask you a personal question?

136
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:56,191
Bill, you were just
licking blood out of my head.

137
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:59,465
I don't think it gets
much more personal than that.

138
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:03,452
How do you manage a social life

139
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:06,235
with men your own age?

140
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:08,935
- Their only thought must be...
- I don't date.

141
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:10,468
Ever?

142
00:13:10,993 --> 00:13:12,067
Oh, I've...

143
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:14,797
I've been on a few dates.

144
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:18,863
<i>Man, I can't wait to see her naked.
I wonder if she's a natural blond.</i>

145
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:20,970
<i>Nothing worse than a blond
with a big, black bush.</i>

146
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,430
What the heck?

147
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,884
<i>Not every guy was a pig.</i>

148
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:28,227
<i>The kind of girl I could marry
and spend {\the rest of}my life loving.</i>

149
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:32,695
<i>And never have those thoughts of Matt
Damon, Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead</i>

150
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:35,985
<i>with that little Santa hat on.</i>
Where you goin'? What's wrong?

151
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:38,808
But

152
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,719
it always ends up the same.

153
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,408
There must be some people
who know about your talent.

154
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:46,274
The people closest to me.

155
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,099
But... we never talk about it.

156
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:54,169
And I do my best
to stay out of their heads.

157
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:56,401
Over the years I've learned how.

158
00:13:57,099 --> 00:13:59,903
I figure it's kind of unethical
to listen in to my family

159
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:01,601
and my friends, my boss.

160
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:03,348
But... they know.

161
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,607
Other people suspect
or... they think I'm psychic.

162
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,768
Most people just think I'm crazy.

163
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:13,883
What does it sound like?

164
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:16,039
It's sort of like

165
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:19,750
a stream of consciousness.

166
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:23,534
Gets weirder
when people are mad, or...

167
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:25,143
upset and...

168
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:26,911
sometimes...

169
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:35,504
Sometimes it's just images.

170
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:53,437
I should be gettin' home.

171
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,545
Bill, I feel completely healed.

172
00:15:10,364 --> 00:15:11,364
You are.

173
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:17,460
Do doctors know
that V-juice can do this?

174
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,257
And we wanna keep it that way.

175
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,714
I should show you to your car.

176
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:56,077
- How you doin', motherfucker?
- What's up, Joe?

177
00:15:57,064 --> 00:15:58,590
Sexy ass over there.

178
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:02,216
Hey, baby.

179
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,551
Big boy, what's up, you?

180
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:21,987
What's up, baby?

181
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,174
I'm Terrell.

182
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:26,878
Tara. All right.

183
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:29,453
So what's

184
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,599
a fine girl like you

185
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,061
doing sitting here all by herself?

186
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:37,749
I'm watching my fool cousin trying
to hit on the straightest man here.

187
00:16:42,737 --> 00:16:43,737
All right.

188
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:46,300
Baby, I am the straightest man here.

189
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:48,653
Really?

190
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:52,557
You can just ask
any one of these honeys.

191
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:54,501
Look,

192
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:57,353
I should tell you. I am married.

193
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:00,048
- That's not a problem for me.
- Well,

194
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:02,650
my husband is a mercenary.

195
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:05,344
Black oil.

196
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:08,989
He just got back from assassinating
some guys in Iraq.

197
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:11,909
- You makin' this shit up.
- I wish I was.

198
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:16,229
'Cause he ain't worth me, I can tell you
that, if he {\ever}caught me with another man,

199
00:17:16,863 --> 00:17:18,178
he'd kill us both.

200
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,707
I'm not sure who he'd kill first.

201
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:22,093
Probably me.

202
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:24,428
I hope so.

203
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,675
Bitch, you crazy.

204
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:30,984
He already shot one guy in the nuts,
just for buying me a CD.

205
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:33,643
Hell, no.

206
00:17:58,835 --> 00:17:59,646
Fuck!

207
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,620
Oh, my God!

208
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:17,635
This how you wanna play?

209
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,023
How old are you?

210
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:32,509
- Am I allowed to ask that?
- I was made a vampire in 1865.

211
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:36,441
- When I was 30 human years old.
- You look older than that.

212
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:40,377
Life was harder then.

213
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:42,189
Were you in the Civil War?

214
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:43,598
I was.

215
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:46,085
Would you be willing to come,
talk to my grandmother's club?

216
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:49,874
It's... mostly a bunch of old people
who had family in the war.

217
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:53,427
They call themselves
the Descendants of the Glorious Dead.

218
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:55,494
The Glorious Dead?

219
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:59,891
There is nothing glorious
about dying in a war.

220
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,291
Bunch of starvin', freezin' boys,

221
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:05,107
killin' each other so
the rich people can stay rich.

222
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:07,356
Madness.

223
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:10,323
I'm sure it was awful.

224
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:21,914
Would it make you happy
if I did this?

225
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:24,296
It would make
my grandmother ecstatic.

226
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,891
Would it make you... happy?

227
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:34,833
Yes.

228
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:42,988
I'll do it then.

229
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:49,727
And look forward
to meeting your grandmother.

230
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:53,069
When may I call on you?

231
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:56,294
I'm off work tomorrow.

232
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:00,356
Just after dark then.

233
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,116
Sam's still up.

234
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,394
That's creepy.

235
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,641
<i>We never should have
given them the vote</i>

236
00:20:58,761 --> 00:21:00,743
<i>and legitimized their
unholy existence.</i>

237
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:03,463
<i>The American people need to know
these are creatures of Satan.</i>

238
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,981
<i>Demons, literally.
They have no soul.</i>

239
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:08,228
<i>But Reverend Newlin,
you must be aware of polls</i>

240
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:10,419
<i>that show consistently
growing support </i>

241
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:12,799
<i>- for vampire rights.
- Those polls are fixed.</i>

242
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:15,406
<i>Do you know how much money
these monsters have givent o politicians</i>

243
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:17,942
<i>of both parties?
As well as the corporate media?</i>

244
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:20,775
<i>That's nonsense. Vampires don't seek
to control human policy</i>

245
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:23,454
<i>It's of very little interest to us.
We simply want the...</i>

246
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,371
<i>You can't trace any of it.
It's all been laundered.</i>

247
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:29,774
<i>Are you accusing my organization
of criminal activity, sir?</i>

248
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,753
<i>I will not speak
to her directly, Sharon.</i>

249
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:35,851
<i>- Why is that, Reverend Newlin?
- My commitment to Christ Jesus,</i>

250
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:39,217
<i>praise his name, compels me
not to recognize her kind.</i>

251
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:41,817
<i>That's gonna make it
difficult to have a dialogue.</i>

252
00:21:41,937 --> 00:21:44,013
<i>I will not speak to her directly.</i>

253
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:47,737
<i>Thank you, Sharon. Now, TBBN...</i>

254
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:53,639
I don't think Jesus would mind
if somebody was a vampire.

255
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,954
I don't either, honey.

256
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,261
Is this sausage different
from what you usually make?

257
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:09,911
It tastes so much more complex
than it usually does.

258
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,289
Oh, dear, you think it's gone bad.

259
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,857
No, it's delicious.
It's like I can close my eyes

260
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:18,462
and I can see the farm
the pig lived on,

261
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:20,299
and feel the sun and the rain
on my face,

262
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:22,897
and even taste the earth
that the herbs grew out of.

263
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,009
Good morning, Tara.

264
00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:32,654
No, you sit down.

265
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,362
- I'll make a new pot.
- All right.

266
00:22:39,682 --> 00:22:41,372
- You look awful.
- Yeah.

267
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:42,698
Well, I feel even worse.

268
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:45,935
Yes, you can take a shower here.

269
00:22:46,055 --> 00:22:48,203
And you can borrow
some of my clothes.

270
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:49,134
Thanks.

271
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:51,123
Any news about Jason?

272
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:53,795
Yeah, we heard already.
They let him go last night.

273
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:55,711
- I knew they would.
- I didn't.

274
00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:58,480
Well, I'm glad to see
you're still alive.

275
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,295
You obviously did not hook up
with that vampire last night.

276
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:05,345
- Sometimes you are just plain dumb.
- Shut up!

277
00:23:05,946 --> 00:23:08,209
Lucky Gran was already in bed
when I got in last night.

278
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:09,377
Did he bite you?

279
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,967
Are you sure? 'Cause you know
they can hypnotize you.

280
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:15,105
Yeah, and black people are lazy,
and Jews have horns.

281
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:19,687
You must be glad they let
Jason go home Miss Stackhouse.

282
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:23,312
I can't even believe
that they arrested him to begin with.

283
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:26,257
I have a good mind to call
Bud Dearborne and chew him out.

284
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:28,311
Jason's a good boy.

285
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:29,833
Everybody knows that.

286
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:39,784
I'm sorry I was such a bitch
to you last night.

287
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:42,921
Well, I'm sorry I been acting
like I'm your mother.

288
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,121
I just worry about you.

289
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:48,560
- You're basically my only friend.
- Am I too late for breakfast?

290
00:23:51,854 --> 00:23:53,798
I'm so glad they didn't lock you up.

291
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:56,423
Me too.

292
00:23:57,634 --> 00:23:59,642
I don't even know
why they suspected me.

293
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,278
I think somebody heard
I'd been with Maudette.

294
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:03,270
Had you?

295
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,883
- No.
- Are you sure?

296
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:06,615
She was a woman.

297
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:09,337
That's funny.
At least she was human.

298
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:12,844
You will never believe
what happened.

299
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:15,357
- Hey, Gran.
- Sit down.

300
00:24:15,477 --> 00:24:18,227
- I'll fix you breakfast.
- What happened?

301
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:20,670
Apparently,

302
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,592
a tornado touched down
over at Four Tracks Corners.

303
00:24:26,188 --> 00:24:28,771
It turned over that rent trailer
in the clearing.

304
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:30,287
You know the one?

305
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,312
And it killed that couple

306
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:36,770
- That's been staying in there.
- Mack and Denise Rattray?

307
00:24:37,524 --> 00:24:39,380
They were trapped under the trailer.

308
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,980
Mike Spencer said
they were crushed to a pulp.

309
00:25:49,455 --> 00:25:50,886
What are you doing here?

310
00:25:51,232 --> 00:25:52,477
You know Mike Spencer.

311
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:55,389
Of course. You buried my parents.

312
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:57,848
Yep. My new job. Parish coroner.

313
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:00,715
But I still run the funeral home.

314
00:26:01,148 --> 00:26:02,521
That's gotta be convenient.

315
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:07,957
This is still
a restricted crime scene.

316
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,124
Why are you here?

317
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:13,210
When I heard what happened,
I just had to come look.

318
00:26:13,703 --> 00:26:15,103
What an awful thing.

319
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,245
You know, I did hear you weren't
too fond of the Rattrays.

320
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:20,084
Where'd you hear that?

321
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:22,917
My niece is the emergency room nurse
in Monroe.

322
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,212
Says somebody busted up
old Mack pretty bad last night.

323
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:29,798
- And everybody says that {\somebody}it was you.
- They were hurting a friend of mine.

324
00:26:30,476 --> 00:26:32,343
This be that vampire
I been hearing about?

325
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,731
The one who was living
at the old Compton house?

326
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,778
The old Compton house?

327
00:26:36,898 --> 00:26:39,238
- Just across {\the field }from where I live?
- That's the one.

328
00:26:39,358 --> 00:26:41,761
Your grandmother lets you
associate with a vampire?

329
00:26:41,881 --> 00:26:43,374
You can take that up with her.

330
00:26:43,494 --> 00:26:45,776
I'm sure she'd just love to know
that somebody thinks

331
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,605
she's not taking proper care of me.

332
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:49,256
The Rattrays were draining him.

333
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:51,348
Draining vampires
is against the law, isn't it?

334
00:26:51,468 --> 00:26:53,647
I was simply doing my civic duty
by stopping them.

335
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:55,089
And now they're dead.

336
00:26:55,703 --> 00:26:57,070
Killed by a tornado.

337
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:58,510
Tornados hop.

338
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:00,624
This one didn't land anywhere else.

339
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:05,146
And nobody around here heard or saw
anything like a tornado last night.

340
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:08,922
Are you telling me you seriously
think one man could do all this?

341
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:10,085
He's not a man.

342
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:14,682
They're really not that
different from you and me

343
00:27:14,802 --> 00:27:16,831
if you bothered to try
to get to know one.

344
00:27:17,661 --> 00:27:18,968
You're a good girl.

345
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:21,976
I have to see you go down this path.

346
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:25,245
Lucky for you, Sheriff Dearborne,
nobody's forcing you to watch.

347
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:28,089
Now, if y'all two rednecks
will excuse me, I've gotta go.

348
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,430
You know, he sleeps
in the ground all day.

349
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,458
I don't think he's gonna even
look at the rug.

350
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:49,440
I'm not doing this for him.
I'm doing this for me,

351
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,484
so I can be proud of my home.

352
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:53,549
And how do you know where he sleeps?

353
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:55,866
I don't, actually.

354
00:27:58,654 --> 00:27:59,899
What's that smell?

355
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:03,497
What smell?

356
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:07,646
It smells like rotten food,
or something. You can't smell that?

357
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:10,899
Well, find it.

358
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:27,420
You can't smell this?

359
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:33,247
I better throw this out.

360
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,723
Jason and Tara are coming over
this evening as well.

361
00:28:42,516 --> 00:28:44,774
- Gran.
- Well, they invited themselves.

362
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:48,062
Jason said that he wants to meet
the vampire for himself,

363
00:28:48,224 --> 00:28:50,815
and Tara said she thought
she ought to be here as well.

364
00:28:50,975 --> 00:28:54,564
{\I don't know }Why everyone's getting their panties
in a wad about some stupid vampire?

365
00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:58,175
Did you want to be alone with him?

366
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:01,092
I don't know.

367
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:03,366
Maybe.

368
00:29:05,685 --> 00:29:07,552
Aren't you gonna tell me
to be careful?

369
00:29:09,092 --> 00:29:12,281
You're always careful, Sookie,
about what counts.

370
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,381
And I can depend on that.
Isn't that right?

371
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:36,280
Look, I'm just saying.

372
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,489
Do you want a vampire
sucking blood out of you?

373
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,851
I'm just trying to get to know
the man, that's all.

374
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:43,763
'Cause that's where it's gonna end up.
Always does.

375
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:45,739
What do you know
about vampires, anyway?

376
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,664
Yeah, I know a lot more
than I care to.

377
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:52,127
Oh, please, you ain't even got
enough sense to pour piss out of a boot.

378
00:29:56,624 --> 00:29:57,714
That's my beer.

379
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,634
You asked if I wanted anything
to drink,

380
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:02,915
and I said I'd have a beer.

381
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,101
And that's when you went
to the fridge.

382
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:08,726
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.

383
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:10,333
- Here.
- It's okay.

384
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:31,462
I don't like it when you do that.

385
00:30:31,673 --> 00:30:32,839
I've upset you.

386
00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:41,128
Since you're here.

387
00:30:46,122 --> 00:30:47,244
What's wrong?

388
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:50,350
You have to invite me in.

389
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,773
Otherwise it's physically impossible
for me to enter a mortal's home.

390
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:57,126
Seriously?

391
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,181
Come on, try.

392
00:31:00,203 --> 00:31:01,155
I can't.

393
00:31:01,755 --> 00:31:03,152
I can't even try.

394
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:06,500
That is so weird.

395
00:31:08,361 --> 00:31:10,683
Oh, Bill, won't you please come in?

396
00:31:12,478 --> 00:31:13,823
- Thank you.
- So

397
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:17,189
if I were to withdraw my invitation,
would you have to leave?

398
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:23,183
Well, I'll have to remember that.

399
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:37,981
Oh, my stars.

400
00:31:38,451 --> 00:31:39,684
Of course.

401
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:41,523
You don't...

402
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,275
I... I'm sorry.

403
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:54,501
Your people, Mr. Compton,

404
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:57,292
they were from this area I believe.

405
00:31:57,766 --> 00:31:59,958
Yeah, my father's people
were Comptons,

406
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:02,381
and my mother's people
were Loudermilks.

407
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:04,689
Oh, there are a lot
of Loudermilks left.

408
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:08,662
But I'm afraid old Mr. Jesse Compton
died last year.

409
00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:09,763
Yes, ma'am.

410
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:11,848
That's why I came back to Benton.

411
00:32:13,008 --> 00:32:14,778
There were no living Comptons so

412
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:16,910
I've set up home
in the old Compton place.

413
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,841
And as I expect the VRA to pass...

414
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:22,280
I wouldn't be too sure
about that if I were you.

415
00:32:25,048 --> 00:32:28,436
A lot of Americans don't think
you people deserve special rights.

416
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:30,822
They have the same rights you have.

417
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:33,745
No, I'm just saying there's a reason
things are the way they are.

418
00:32:34,982 --> 00:32:36,448
It's called injustice.

419
00:32:37,204 --> 00:32:39,210
Listen, it's called,
"This is how we do it."

420
00:32:41,714 --> 00:32:44,132
This is my house.
I will not tolerate rudeness.

421
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,337
Did you know the Stackhouses,
Mr. Compton?

422
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:59,800
I remember Jonas Stackhouse.

423
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:04,378
He and his wife moved here
when Benton was just a hole in the road.

424
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,529
I was a young man of 16.

425
00:33:09,394 --> 00:33:11,742
Isn't this the house he built?
I mean, at least in part?

426
00:33:11,904 --> 00:33:13,119
Yes, it was.

427
00:33:13,487 --> 00:33:14,536
Did you own slaves?

428
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:20,985
I did not, but my father did.

429
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:27,084
A house slave, a middle-aged woman
whose name I cannot recall,

430
00:33:27,729 --> 00:33:29,829
and... And a yard slave.

431
00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:32,850
A young, strong man named Minus.

432
00:33:33,255 --> 00:33:37,323
This is just the sort of thing my club
will be so interested in hearing about.

433
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:38,770
About slaves?

434
00:33:39,872 --> 00:33:43,349
Well, about anything having
to do with that time.

435
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,550
I look forward to speaking
to your club, Mrs. Stackhouse.

436
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:55,358
Now,

437
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,938
if it's all right with you,

438
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:00,805
I thought that Sookie and I
might take a walk.

439
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:04,394
It's such a lovely night.

440
00:34:08,205 --> 00:34:09,974
It's all right with me

441
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,302
if it's all right with Sookie.

442
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:18,309
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- I don't think it's {\any of }your business.

443
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,967
She's right, Jason.

444
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,533
Look, Gran,
I am the man in this family.

445
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:27,814
You are a man in this family,
but I am the oldest person here

446
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:30,623
and this is my house.
You better respect me, boy.

447
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:32,329
Actually,

448
00:34:33,258 --> 00:34:34,858
I'm the oldest person here.

449
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:39,732
Shall we?

450
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,421
We shall.

451
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:56,847
Well, thanks for making me
look like a fool in front of him, Gran.

452
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:02,144
You don't need any help
looking like a fool.

453
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:07,147
I went to the Rattrays' trailer.

454
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,736
I told you I was strong.

455
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,555
I don't believe I fully gauged

456
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:14,408
the extent of your strength.

457
00:35:15,764 --> 00:35:17,620
Over the years, we become stronger,

458
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:20,291
and more skillful of hiding
what we've done.

459
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,201
You might want to remember
for next time: Tornados hop,

460
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:26,683
they don't just land in one place.

461
00:35:30,618 --> 00:35:32,929
So I guess you've killed
a lot of people.

462
00:35:34,473 --> 00:35:36,344
I killed a few by accident at first.

463
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,052
I was never sure
when I was gonna get my next feed.

464
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,819
But it's all different now.

465
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:43,914
There's Tru Blood.

466
00:35:44,617 --> 00:35:47,262
I can get donor blood
from a clinic in Monroe.

467
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:50,799
Or I can glamour someone
into letting me feed on them for love,

468
00:35:51,677 --> 00:35:53,477
and then they'll forget all about it.

469
00:35:54,677 --> 00:35:56,448
Did you feed on the Rattrays?

470
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:00,850
After I'd given you my blood,
while you were healing.

471
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,125
You drank a lot of my blood.

472
00:36:06,017 --> 00:36:07,383
What will that do to me?

473
00:36:07,928 --> 00:36:09,972
Well, you'll have keener senses.

474
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,661
What else?

475
00:36:16,545 --> 00:36:18,278
Your libido will be more active.

476
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:23,411
Is--? Is that it?

477
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,878
I'll always be able to feel you.

478
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,744
I'll be able to find you fast.

479
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:36,072
If you're ever in trouble,
that could come in quite handy.

480
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,775
You're gonna have to give me
a minute here, Bill.

481
00:36:45,217 --> 00:36:47,472
I'm feeling a little overwhelmed.

482
00:36:50,968 --> 00:36:51,890
Of course.

483
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:15,561
I don't know why your grandmother
was so short with you.

484
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:17,605
You're just trying to protect Sookie.

485
00:37:18,413 --> 00:37:21,309
I hate it when people treat me
like I ain't got a lick of sense.

486
00:37:22,278 --> 00:37:24,035
Like I'm still just a kid,

487
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:26,450
I don't know, in the way.

488
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:28,448
I know what that's like.

489
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:31,021
It sucks, that's what it's like.

490
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:34,630
You feel alone in the world,
like nobody understands you,

491
00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:36,260
or even sees you.

492
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:38,313
Sucks.

493
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:40,056
That ain't right,

494
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:42,304
because everybody is, you know,
somebody.

495
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:45,381
What?

496
00:37:45,892 --> 00:37:48,871
We're all just trying to be...
Trying to be seen to...

497
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:50,838
To matter.

498
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:56,464
You're right.

499
00:37:59,383 --> 00:38:01,150
How'd you get to be so smart.

500
00:38:02,172 --> 00:38:04,188
I'm not smart at all. I'm not.

501
00:38:04,694 --> 00:38:06,690
I am constantly doing things
I shouldn't

502
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,490
and end up getting me in trouble.

503
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:10,901
I'm a fucking idiot sometimes.

504
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:14,326
Well, can I tell you a secret?

505
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:15,982
I am too.

506
00:38:16,883 --> 00:38:18,536
It's not that much of a secret.

507
00:38:20,152 --> 00:38:21,374
What? What?

508
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:25,104
"Not that much of a secret."

509
00:38:31,532 --> 00:38:32,354
Shit.

510
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:35,774
I was supposed to pick up Dawn
from work.

511
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:39,137
Goddamn it.

512
00:38:41,495 --> 00:38:42,995
She gonna be all pissed.

513
00:38:44,748 --> 00:38:47,657
<i>- Good night, Gran.
- Night, Jason. Drive careful.</i>

514
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,709
You said you could glamour somebody
into letting you bite them?

515
00:38:58,981 --> 00:39:00,401
What is that, hypnosis?

516
00:39:00,712 --> 00:39:01,541
Kind of.

517
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:02,690
It's similar.

518
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,879
All humans are susceptible to it.

519
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:07,918
Have you done it to me?

520
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:11,560
- And I never will.
- Really?

521
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:12,977
Try.

522
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,859
- I don't feel comfortable with that.
- You chicken?

523
00:39:49,775 --> 00:39:51,430
Can you feel my influence?

524
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:00,581
No, not a bit. Sorry.

525
00:40:02,393 --> 00:40:04,441
Well, Sookie, this is very strange.

526
00:40:04,928 --> 00:40:08,131
You don't like not being able
to control people, do you?

527
00:40:10,136 --> 00:40:12,249
It's not a very attractive trait.

528
00:40:12,902 --> 00:40:16,182
Humans are usually more squeamish
about vampires than you are.

529
00:40:18,575 --> 00:40:21,213
Who am I to be squeamish about
something out of the ordinary?

530
00:40:22,518 --> 00:40:25,273
Sookie, Jason, y'all get out
of the water now.

531
00:40:29,153 --> 00:40:31,969
<i>How can our car insurance go up
so much after just one ticket?</i>

532
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:34,809
<i>Damn it all to hell, Iate
having to ask Mama for money.</i>

533
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:36,644
Damn what all to hell?

534
00:40:37,574 --> 00:40:40,691
I can break open my piggy bank
if you need some money.

535
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:45,011
- Who told you we need money?
- Mama.

536
00:40:46,538 --> 00:40:49,227
Corbett, I swear,
I haven't spoken a word.

537
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,158
Do you know why you're here?

538
00:40:55,142 --> 00:40:57,914
Your parents, they're concerned
about something

539
00:40:58,034 --> 00:40:59,767
that can't possibly exist.

540
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:04,465
But you and I are gonna put all
this silliness to rest today.

541
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,393
Now, can you tell me
what I'm thinking?

542
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:13,056
<i>I'm thinking about
the color red and the number 9.</i>

543
00:41:13,176 --> 00:41:14,378
The color red

544
00:41:14,754 --> 00:41:16,020
and the number 9.

545
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,740
The psychologist thinks

546
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,261
that Sookie just reads
our body language

547
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:25,222
and is highly observant. That's all.

548
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:28,905
That's a relief. <i>That's bullshit.</i>

549
00:41:29,693 --> 00:41:30,596
Isn't it?

550
00:41:30,716 --> 00:41:32,227
What's body language?

551
00:41:32,347 --> 00:41:34,231
<i>Why was that doctor so scared?</i>

552
00:41:34,351 --> 00:41:36,288
<i>Because she was lying to me,
that's why.</i>

553
00:41:36,587 --> 00:41:40,056
<i>Because there is something
to be scared of inside my little girl.</i>

554
00:41:41,725 --> 00:41:44,332
<i>Oh, my God. She knows
everything I'm thinking.</i>

555
00:41:44,957 --> 00:41:47,144
<i>Oh, sweet Jesus. What do I do?</i>

556
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:49,301
<i>Poor child. She can't.</i>

557
00:41:57,441 --> 00:41:59,359
I was diagnosed with ADD.

558
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:02,660
They tried to put me on drugs
but my mama wouldn't let them.

559
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,119
She knew that wasn't it.

560
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,363
She tried to protect me
even though I scared her.

561
00:42:11,455 --> 00:42:12,658
When did you lose her?

562
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:14,913
Just before I turned 8.

563
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,107
Both my parents.

564
00:42:17,227 --> 00:42:18,318
Flash flood.

565
00:42:20,754 --> 00:42:22,565
I lost my wife and my children.

566
00:42:23,787 --> 00:42:25,698
Everyone I knew from human life.

567
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:29,520
Most of them are buried here
in this cemetary.

568
00:42:29,802 --> 00:42:32,180
You really don't consider
yourself human at all?

569
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:35,605
I'm not human.

570
00:42:45,346 --> 00:42:46,824
Can you turn into a bat?

571
00:42:49,246 --> 00:42:52,163
There are those who can change form,
but I'm not one of them.

572
00:42:52,476 --> 00:42:53,598
Can you levitate?

573
00:42:55,432 --> 00:42:56,795
Turn invisible?

574
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:58,408
Sorry.

575
00:43:00,596 --> 00:43:02,819
You don't seem like
a very good vampire.

576
00:43:03,941 --> 00:43:05,126
What can you do?

577
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,117
I can bring you back to life.

578
00:43:25,796 --> 00:43:27,349
This is where you live?

579
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:30,895
Since old {\Jesse }Compton had no living
heirs when he died,

580
00:43:31,015 --> 00:43:32,416
ownership reverts back to me.

581
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:35,085
I thought that wasn't for sure
unless the VRA passes.

582
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:39,768
I haven't been getting in any trouble
with the renovations I've been doing.

583
00:43:39,888 --> 00:43:42,641
Although of course
I've been doing it myself in the night.

584
00:43:43,972 --> 00:43:46,972
I need an electrician, but I can't get
anyone to return my calls.

585
00:43:49,386 --> 00:43:53,383
Maybe if I made a few calls tomorrow,
I could come by after work

586
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,511
and tell you who to contact.

587
00:44:00,152 --> 00:44:01,008
Thank you.

588
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:10,985
Take your clip out.

589
00:44:27,124 --> 00:44:27,868
May I?

590
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,733
I can smell the sunlight
on your skin.

591
00:45:41,482 --> 00:45:42,949
I should see you home.

592
00:45:46,553 --> 00:45:47,487
All right.

593
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:55,691
What's the matter, baby?
Don't you like me?

594
00:45:56,113 --> 00:45:57,987
Oh, sure, I like you, Jason.

595
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,831
I wouldn't tie any old man
up to my bed.

596
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:03,923
So call in sick.

597
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,357
Sam won't mind.

598
00:46:06,882 --> 00:46:09,042
One, Sam would mind.

599
00:46:09,293 --> 00:46:11,576
And two, we've had sex,
like, three times today.

600
00:46:11,696 --> 00:46:14,211
At this rate, we're gonna burn out
by the end of the week.

601
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:17,109
And then you're gonna
get all weird and closed-off,

602
00:46:17,229 --> 00:46:19,560
and I've already been down
that road with you, baby.

603
00:46:21,357 --> 00:46:22,446
But I'm horny.

604
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,617
Well, I'll be back by midnight.

605
00:46:27,825 --> 00:46:30,436
You're not...
You're not leaving me here like this.

606
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,884
You just better be happy that's
all I'm doing to you, baby.

607
00:46:37,493 --> 00:46:38,227
What?

608
00:46:41,152 --> 00:46:41,830
What?

609
00:46:43,049 --> 00:46:45,295
You can just think of it as foreplay.

610
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,045
Foreplay my...

611
00:46:48,259 --> 00:46:48,976
Don't!

612
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,360
Okay, this ain't funny, goddamn it.

613
00:46:58,681 --> 00:46:59,959
Goddamn it!

614
00:47:01,134 --> 00:47:01,911
Don't!

615
00:47:03,013 --> 00:47:03,791
Fuck!

616
00:47:05,372 --> 00:47:06,239
Bitch.

617
00:47:16,056 --> 00:47:16,989
Hey, sugar.

618
00:47:17,645 --> 00:47:19,645
Make Mom another stinger, would you?

619
00:47:22,101 --> 00:47:23,979
You listen to me, Jane Bodenhouse.

620
00:47:24,526 --> 00:47:26,305
You're already drunk as a skunk.

621
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,253
Ain't no man in here
gonna wanna take you home.

622
00:47:29,373 --> 00:47:31,551
Sam will have to call your son
to come and get you

623
00:47:31,671 --> 00:47:33,298
just like he always does,

624
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:36,050
even though everybody knows
it humiliates him to death.

625
00:47:36,548 --> 00:47:38,316
Ain't you ashamed of yourself?

626
00:47:39,952 --> 00:47:43,576
- What'd you just say to me?
- I said any particular brand of cognac?

627
00:47:44,085 --> 00:47:47,719
No. Whatever you have
that's nice and cheap.

628
00:47:48,883 --> 00:47:50,411
I told you {\where you could}to buy your uniform.

629
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,834
How come you don't wear a uniform?

630
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:55,045
Because I own this place
and wear what I want.

631
00:47:55,702 --> 00:47:58,170
How come Terry Bellefleur
don't wear a uniform?

632
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,797
Because I spend enough time in them.

633
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,508
No. Because you're a man.

634
00:48:03,195 --> 00:48:05,718
And Sam don't feel the need
to sexualize the men

635
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:08,137
in his employment the same way
he do the women.

636
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,895
- You don't have to wear the uniform.
- Thank you.

637
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:17,368
- Remind me why I hired you again.
- Affirmative action.

638
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,312
Loaded skins and a pitcher of Bud.
Is that it for y'all?

639
00:48:29,343 --> 00:48:31,682
<i>If you serve them nachos
off them titties,</i>

640
00:48:31,802 --> 00:48:33,217
<i>we'd all be mighty obliged.</i>

641
00:48:33,337 --> 00:48:35,563
<i>Ain't nothing I like more
than lickin' food off...</i>

642
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,292
<i>That's a fine ass too.</i>

643
00:48:39,968 --> 00:48:41,707
You wanna let go of the lady, you?

644
00:48:41,827 --> 00:48:43,775
Or you want me to knock you
into next week?

645
00:48:43,895 --> 00:48:45,850
Damn it, you're about
to break my arm.

646
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:47,561
Apologize.

647
00:48:49,553 --> 00:48:50,352
Sorry.

648
00:48:55,025 --> 00:48:57,853
Maybe you and your friends
should find someplace else to eat.

649
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:02,715
Let's go.

650
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,019
Don't look at me, you.

651
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:10,616
Rene, you should have let me
handle that myself.

652
00:49:11,294 --> 00:49:13,005
Merlotte's is a nice place.

653
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,283
And we all want to keep it that way.

654
00:49:16,209 --> 00:49:18,642
And besides, you remind me
of my baby sister, you.

655
00:49:19,321 --> 00:49:21,448
I hope to God that somebody
will stick up for her

656
00:49:21,568 --> 00:49:23,519
if some asshole
ever does her that way.

657
00:49:33,964 --> 00:49:37,882
Would you tell Rene thank you for
helping me out with that jerk tonight?

658
00:49:38,002 --> 00:49:40,351
I was so flustered I think
I might have seemed ungrateful.

659
00:49:40,471 --> 00:49:43,787
<i>Please let me get my period tonight.
Even though Rene wants one of his own,</i>

660
00:49:43,907 --> 00:49:46,715
<i>but I sure don't want him to</i>
<i>feel like he's being forced...</i>

661
00:49:49,137 --> 00:49:50,574
Did you just read my mind?

662
00:49:50,848 --> 00:49:52,796
Sorry. I'm not very focused tonight.

663
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:55,184
My private thoughts
are none of your business.

664
00:49:58,789 --> 00:50:00,256
Wanna step into my office?

665
00:50:04,162 --> 00:50:06,381
I swear I try not to listen,

666
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,359
but I can't always keep my guard up.

667
00:50:08,784 --> 00:50:11,135
Is it true you can't hear
the vampire's thoughts at all?

668
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:15,419
God, that's...

669
00:50:15,728 --> 00:50:17,853
I mean, that must be
very relaxing for you.

670
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:21,837
You know, not having
to work so hard not to hear.

671
00:50:31,756 --> 00:50:32,856
Can you hear me?

672
00:50:35,593 --> 00:50:37,572
- I don't want to hear you.
- Why not?

673
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,522
I'd have to quit if I read
your mind and I like it here.

674
00:50:40,992 --> 00:50:42,813
- You don't have to quit.
- I've had to leave

675
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:45,802
every job I've ever had because
I could hear my boss' thoughts.

676
00:50:45,922 --> 00:50:47,924
You might be surprised
by what you find.

677
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:50,573
- Not all surprises are good.
- Try sometime.

678
00:50:55,288 --> 00:50:56,338
Now listen,

679
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,415
don't you worry.

680
00:50:59,016 --> 00:51:01,446
You got a job here
as long as you want one.

681
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:10,566
I should get back to work.

682
00:51:21,238 --> 00:51:22,035
Come on.

683
00:51:29,313 --> 00:51:32,133
Baby girl,
don't even let that get you down.

684
00:51:33,842 --> 00:51:35,178
Don't let what get me down?

685
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:38,013
Don't let nothing get you down.

686
00:51:38,723 --> 00:51:40,423
It's the only way to live.

687
00:51:44,514 --> 00:51:46,966
- Ain't that right, Big John?
- Right.

688
00:51:52,022 --> 00:51:53,250
Hey, how's Jason?

689
00:51:53,556 --> 00:51:56,493
He's probably pretty
pissed off at me right about now,

690
00:51:56,957 --> 00:51:59,690
- but, hell, he probably deserves it.
- You know, I have to say I...

691
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,704
I'm surprised you and him
got back together.

692
00:52:01,912 --> 00:52:04,540
No more than I am, baby. Believe me.

693
00:52:04,715 --> 00:52:05,875
Think it's gonna last?

694
00:52:07,484 --> 00:52:09,253
Is there a reason you want to know?

695
00:52:10,433 --> 00:52:12,447
Ever since I've been friends
with Sookie,

696
00:52:12,567 --> 00:52:14,922
I've just gotten a kick out
of watching Jason's escapades

697
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:16,826
with women, you know.

698
00:52:20,531 --> 00:52:21,432
Sort of.

699
00:52:25,234 --> 00:52:27,414
God only knows what happened
to my tables.

700
00:52:27,534 --> 00:52:28,719

708
00:53:49,389 --> 00:53:51,230
Well, hey, there, little human chick.

709
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,585
Hi, I'm here to drop off
some information

710
00:53:55,705 --> 00:53:58,108
about an electrician for Bill Compton.

711
00:53:58,228 --> 00:53:59,369
Is he here?

712
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,073
Maybe.

713
00:54:04,168 --> 00:54:05,840
She smells fresh.
