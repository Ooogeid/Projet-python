1
00:00:00,939 --> 00:00:01,997
<i>Destiny...</i>

2
00:00:02,122 --> 00:00:03,711
The design is clearly ancient,

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,310
launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

4
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:07,808
Where the hell are we?

5
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:09,949
Several billion light years
from home.

6
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:11,808
We are on a ship,
but we have no idea

7
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:14,106
where we are in relation to Earth.

8
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:16,899
This ship could be
the most important discovery

9
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:19,165
mankind has made
since the Stargate itself.

10
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,576
These are the wrong people,
in the wrong place.

11
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:23,812
We've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

12
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:26,537
We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

13
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:29,904
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

14
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:32,187
Could you stop people
running around,

15
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:34,997
activating every bloody system
they can get their hands on?

16
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:35,941
I will.

17
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:39,459
Our reserves...

18
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:41,065
are gone.

19
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,668
All of our power is gone.

20
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,868
- Our trajectory has changed.
- What are you talking about, Rush?

21
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:50,155
Lieutenant,
what the hell's he talking about?

22
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:57,437
Ronald Greer.

23
00:00:58,635 --> 00:01:02,339
I can't think of a better way
to move on from...

24
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:05,617
From this world into the next,

25
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:07,930
or whatever comes,

26
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:13,347
than to fly into the most powerful thing
in all creation...

27
00:01:16,274 --> 00:01:17,281
A star.

28
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,081
Out in a blaze of glory.

29
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:30,465
I like that.

30
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:35,671
That's beautiful.

31
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:47,189
Projet-SG (1.00)

32
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:06,970
Everyone here?

33
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:08,239
All here, sir.

34
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:10,379
If I could have your attention?

35
00:02:14,744 --> 00:02:16,655
You've all heard
about our situation.

36
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,294
It sucks.

37
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:21,143
I'm gonna repeat the facts

38
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:23,327
so that we are all clear.

39
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:27,644
In just over a day,
this ship will fly into a star.

40
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,636
Now, we have no power
to change its course.

41
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:32,491
We have no idea
how to steer the ship

42
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,863
even if we did.
We are having another bad day.

43
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,304
So here's what we're gonna do.

44
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,056
We have a working shuttle.

45
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:46,332
We think there are three planets
out there that might be habitable.

46
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:48,655
Now, we think...

47
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:52,459
We believe that it's no coincidence

48
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:55,589
that Destiny dropped out of FTL
in this solar system,

49
00:02:55,714 --> 00:02:57,098
to give us a chance.

50
00:02:57,474 --> 00:02:58,482
Now...

51
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,564
once we know for sure

52
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:03,265
that there is a planet
out there for us,

53
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:05,891
we are gonna have a lottery.

54
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:09,563
We will draw the names of 15 people.

55
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,692
The shuttle can hold twice that.

56
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,018
Not once it's been loaded up
with supplies.

57
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:19,347
Besides,
there's only life support for 17, max.

58
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:20,572
You said 15.

59
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:23,516
I will be choosing two of the people

60
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,880
myself.

61
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,138
Two people with the necessary skills
to fly the shuttle

62
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,286
and survive on the planet.

63
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:33,712
Yeah, I bet I can guess
who they are!

64
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:38,036
I'll be taking my name
out of the lottery.

65
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:42,531
Anyone who wants to join me,
keep talking.

66
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,271
We're still many hours away from knowing
if the first two are even habitable,

67
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,936
so I suggest you
all go back to your quarters

68
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:54,170
and wait it out.

69
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:56,321
That's all I have for now.

70
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,822
What?

71
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:05,280
You should pick everyone
who goes on that shuttle.

72
00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:08,268
It's the responsible thing to do...

73
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,246
And you should include yourself.

74
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:14,873
If they're gonna survive,
they'll need leadership.

75
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,334
And an HR lady, I'm guessing.

76
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,487
I am not above that.

77
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:22,797
I would want you
to consider me, yes.

78
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:25,874
I would want you
to consider everyone

79
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:28,315
who could contribute
to their survival.

80
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:32,851
I think you should do your job

81
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,264
and make the choices
you need to make.

82
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,521
It wouldn't be very fair.

83
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,315
It would be more unfair
to send the wrong people...

84
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,232
We're all the wrong people!

85
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,511
These are the wrong people.

86
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:49,575
That's up to you.

87
00:06:58,267 --> 00:06:59,274
Who goes?

88
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,682
Other than you and me, I mean...

89
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:03,718
Or haven't you given it
much thought?

90
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:07,774
We can come up with a short list.

91
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:12,240
Factor in skills and strengths
to increase their chances of surving.

92
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:16,758
- Take age and sex into consideration...
- How about just the people we like?

93
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,917
- That's not what I'm saying...
- Leave.

94
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:23,227
- Handpicking two of them is a cop out.
- And by that I mean get out now,

95
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:26,271
or I'm gonna take
your name out of the lottery.

96
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,240
I may just anyway.

97
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,207
Please don't.

98
00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:59,209
God, you didn't even set your alarm.

99
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:04,103
I don't have time for this.

100
00:08:04,522 --> 00:08:06,488
I thought you had
an interview today.

101
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:09,316
They canceled. I was up all night.

102
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,986
Playing those stupid games.

103
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,395
- They canceled, or you canceled?
- Seriously, mom,

104
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:17,178
it's not my skill set.

105
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:18,621
Nothing is.

106
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:22,154
I'm late. We'll talk about it later.

107
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,163
Damn it.

108
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:05,920
I'm just hoping to find a planet,
grow some food,

109
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:08,541
not that I know...

110
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:10,641
a damn thing about farming.

111
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,886
You sound pretty sure
we're both going.

112
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:17,472
Yeah, maybe I am.

113
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:20,992
Has he told you
we're the two he's picked?

114
00:09:21,924 --> 00:09:23,392
No, it's just obvious.

115
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:25,063
How?

116
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,988
There's only two qualified pilots
on the ship

117
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:30,861
me and the Colonel.
He took himself out.

118
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:33,322
That explains you. Why me?

119
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:36,366
Come on, Chloe, he has to pick you.

120
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,532
Why?

121
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:40,495
You're the daughter of a U.S. Senator.
He's probably been ordered to.

122
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,418
Being a Senator's daughter

123
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:45,240
isn't gonna help anyone survive
on that planet.

124
00:09:47,023 --> 00:09:49,796
I think the Colonel's the kind of man
who makes his own decisions.

125
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,054
I'm not one of the two, Matt.

126
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,145
At least, I shouldn't be.

127
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:04,264
- I don't even know if I want to be.
- Don't say that.

128
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:08,148
There's still a chance
that I'll get chosen in the lottery...

129
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,359
But if I don't,
I want you to know that...

130
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:16,688
I have probably felt closer to you
in these past few days

131
00:10:16,813 --> 00:10:18,408
than I have ever felt to anybody,

132
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:22,058
- so if this is goodbye...
- It's not.

133
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:23,207
It might be.

134
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:27,929
I'm glad he's gonna pick you.

135
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:30,420
I want you there.

136
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:35,494
What are the odds?

137
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:37,928
One in five, one in six?

138
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,374
Something like that.

139
00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:47,301
We'll see.

140
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:55,816
So how are you gonna get
the thing off the ship?

141
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:56,989
With the remote...

142
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,535
When the shuttle takes off.

143
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,951
We might even get one last look
at the Destiny

144
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,130
from the outside
before it gets out of range.

145
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:11,003
- What are you guys doing here?
- We heard your message in a bottle.

146
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,569
It started out as a documentary,
actually.

147
00:11:15,897 --> 00:11:18,385
- We want to be part of it.
- Figured you'd be busy.

148
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:22,306
Eli, you realize the odds
of anybody finding a kino out here...

149
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,599
Probably nil, I know.
Let's do it anyway.

150
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:28,562
Let's do something.

151
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:32,009
Let's leave something
of ourselves behind.

152
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,943
So who's first?

153
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:48,122
I'm Chloe Armstrong.

154
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:50,750
I'm 23, and...

155
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,712
I just want to say that my

156
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:58,961
father gave his life, so that all of us
could survive another day,

157
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,327
and we did.

158
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,143
Another day.

159
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:12,877
Sorry, you radioed me?

160
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,449
Yes...

161
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:20,127
The first planet is too cold.

162
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:22,139
Frozen methane.

163
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:24,360
The second is too hot.

164
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:25,726
The third,

165
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:29,183
that happens to be behind the star
at the moment.

166
00:12:29,635 --> 00:12:31,889
Too far away
to determine habitability.

167
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,443
When will we know?

168
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:36,838
It doesn't matter.
We don't have any choice.

169
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:40,192
We're gonna have to launch the shuttle
before we can get close enough.

170
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,219
The odds are good, though.

171
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:45,604
Its orbit...

172
00:12:46,073 --> 00:12:47,797
is in between the other two.

173
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:50,101
The Goldilocks zone,

174
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,395
they call it.

175
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,105
Not too hot and not too cold.

176
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:56,191
Just right.

177
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:00,602
What if we used the engines
from the shuttle

178
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:02,394
to push the Destiny off course?

179
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:05,949
That's a good thought, but...

180
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,859
I'm afraid
I've already run the numbers, and...

181
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:12,644
Without getting into delta-v

182
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:15,335
- thrust-to-weight ratios, then...
- Not a chance.

183
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:17,045
No.

184
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,630
When do we launch the shuttle?

185
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,153
We could wait a few more hours,

186
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:22,911
but the extra time,

187
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:25,971
I don't think it's gonna give us
any more info than we already have.

188
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:27,973
When the shuttle's loaded, then.

189
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:39,693
If, by chance,
you were thinking of choosing me

190
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,023
as one of the two...

191
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:44,448
Please don't.

192
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:46,783
Why?

193
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:49,093
This ship...

194
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:51,731
coming here...

195
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:53,574
was my destiny.

196
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,615
My life's work was to be here.

197
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,032
Not...

198
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:02,132
trying to survive on some rock

199
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:04,018
with a bunch of strangers.

200
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:06,662
In fact,

201
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:09,822
you can take my name
off the lottery altogether.

202
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:15,687
Look, Rush,

203
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,181
I realize I should've listened
to you sooner.

204
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:20,365
- No, I wasn't myself.
- Still,

205
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:22,270
you were right.

206
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,058
It really wouldn't have made
any difference.

207
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:34,247
Do you mind if I ask you
who you are gonna choose?

208
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:39,044
Lieutenants Scott and Johansen.

209
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:42,343
I would've thought Scott and Greer.

210
00:14:42,468 --> 00:14:43,822
Yesterday's heroes.

211
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,176
I've got my fingers crossed
for Greer.

212
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,094
You could easily arrange that.

213
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:52,307
Fix the lottery?

214
00:14:57,953 --> 00:14:59,973
There'll be those
who'll think you did anyway.

215
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:27,362
My name is Camile Wray.

216
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:30,927
My age is...
None of your business, Eli.

217
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,160
If...

218
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:39,991
If anyone finds this
within the next,

219
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:42,148
I don't know, 40 years,

220
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,081
tell Sharon that...

221
00:15:49,404 --> 00:15:51,019
My last thoughts were for her.

222
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:56,101
The names of every person
in this room

223
00:15:56,226 --> 00:15:58,164
are written down
on one of this piece of paper.

224
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:02,335
Dr. Rush and I
have chosen to exclude ourselves.

225
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:05,423
If anyone else feels the same way,

226
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:07,424
now would be the time to speak up.

227
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,441
If your name is chosen,

228
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:14,832
you are to go directly up
these stairs

229
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:17,581
to the shuttle,
where you'll be met by the two people

230
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:19,352
that I have already chosen.

231
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,287
Lieutenant Scott has pilot training,

232
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,622
and TJ's skills as a medic

233
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:28,248
will be essential on the planet.

234
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:32,490
If your name is not chosen,

235
00:16:33,883 --> 00:16:35,212
you are to remain here

236
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:37,624
until I receive word
the 15 are aboard,

237
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:40,153
and the shuttle's rear hatch
is secure.

238
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,635
Does anyone have anything to say?

239
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:11,029
Airman Becker.

240
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:16,284
Go.

241
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,616
David Walters.

242
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:28,008
Camile Wray.

243
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:45,496
Lieutenant James.

244
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:56,533
Dr. Park.

245
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:06,324
- Take a seat and strap in.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,198
Mr. Brody.

247
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:44,772
Sergeant Riley.

248
00:19:06,902 --> 00:19:08,229
And Dr. Boone.

249
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:13,945
That's 15. We're done here.

250
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:18,088
- You can fit more people on that thing.
- I need you to shut up.

251
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,117
Come on, people!
If we don't do something, we're done!

252
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,934
He's right, we got to do something.

253
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:33,067
Now, I don't want to have
to do that to anybody else...

254
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:36,788
But I will.

255
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:52,357
That's it.

256
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:57,320
Full count.

257
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:19,133
This is Scott.
Everyone's aboard.

258
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:22,487
Rear hatch is secure.

259
00:20:23,246 --> 00:20:25,890
Give yourself
a 60-second countdown, Lieutenant.

260
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:27,820
Some of us would like
to see you off.

261
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:28,945
<i>Copy that.</i>

262
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,665
We're releasing the docking clamps.

263
00:21:25,812 --> 00:21:27,410
The kino's sending back pictures.

264
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:33,958
This is Scott. We're away.

265
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:37,587
- You're looking good, Lieutenant.
<i>- I expect we'll be out of radio range</i>

266
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,231
by the time we fire up
the main drive, so...

267
00:21:43,286 --> 00:21:45,795
- We'll be thinking of you guys.
- You too, brother.

268
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:48,389
You too.

269
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:50,266
<i>Matthew, T.J...</i>

270
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:52,609
Take good care of those people.

271
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:12,413
There it is.

272
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,498
That's the Destiny?

273
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:38,356
Thank you, Eli.

274
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:42,219
I never thought I'd get the chance
to see the ship from the outside.

275
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:46,549
You know what,
I think I'm gonna go for a walk.

276
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:48,741
How does that sound?

277
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:51,285
Sounds like a plan.

278
00:22:53,775 --> 00:22:55,767
I shall be in my quarters
for the duration.

279
00:22:55,892 --> 00:22:58,459
I have 100 pages of a truly

280
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,670
mediocre book to finish.

281
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:19,022
I'm sorry
I got you involved in this.

282
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:21,481
Actually...

283
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:23,638
I'm not.

284
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,277
Yet!

285
00:23:27,143 --> 00:23:29,699
I'll probably be sorry
at the end of the day but...

286
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,830
We don't have that long, do we?

287
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:39,125
No.

288
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:43,046
How will it happen?

289
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:50,143
There will be turbulence
from the solar wind,

290
00:23:50,922 --> 00:23:53,347
far worse than
what we've previously experienced.

291
00:23:54,636 --> 00:23:55,643
Heat,

292
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:56,991
obviously.

293
00:23:58,044 --> 00:24:01,492
And intense G-forces.
I suspect the ship will be

294
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,285
torn apart long before
we reach the star.

295
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:11,353
Hopefully it will be quick.

296
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,181
While I don't condone
behavior of that kind.

297
00:24:46,306 --> 00:24:48,870
In any way, shape,
or form, I gotta say,

298
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:53,065
The look on Telford's face when
you put him down was priceless.

299
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:55,230
Complete and total shock.

300
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:57,488
He was surprised, yes, sir.

301
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,816
I guess you can say
you even got away with it.

302
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,176
I'm just...

303
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:08,347
Sorry I...

304
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,828
That I disappointed you,

305
00:25:11,272 --> 00:25:12,279
sir.

306
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,265
You're a good man, Sergeant.
I know that.

307
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:19,311
Besides, the bastard had it coming.

308
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:23,485
Yes, sir, he did.

309
00:25:28,397 --> 00:25:29,517
So long.

310
00:25:30,952 --> 00:25:32,170
At ease, Ronald.

311
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,534
Colonel, just go
whenever you're ready.

312
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,241
No, I got it, I just...

313
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:52,623
Can you just wait outside, Eli.
Thanks.

314
00:25:57,771 --> 00:25:59,728
Hi, Emily, I just...

315
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,368
I just wanted to say...

316
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,836
Well, you know. You know.

317
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,165
Where is everybody?

318
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:47,583
All the fun people are here.

319
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:56,489
Our father, who art in heaven.

320
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,729
Hallowed be thy name.

321
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,868
Thy kingdom come,

322
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,381
Thy will be done,

323
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:04,917
On Earth, as it is in heaven.

324
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:07,902
Give us this day our daily bread,

325
00:27:08,404 --> 00:27:10,606
And forgive us our trespasses,

326
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,023
As we forgive those
who trespass against us,

327
00:27:14,685 --> 00:27:16,863
And lead us not into temptation.

328
00:28:27,895 --> 00:28:28,902
What?

329
00:28:29,762 --> 00:28:32,544
Nothing, I just...
I realized it was past midnight.

330
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:36,112
Does that mean
they've gone into the sun?

331
00:28:37,191 --> 00:28:38,659
No, nothing like that.

332
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:42,762
It's his birthday.

333
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,226
That's all he means.

334
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:51,937
Happy birthday.

335
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:55,463
Thanks.

336
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,832
Mr. Brody, would you come up here?

337
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:02,067
I need you to confirm
a spectrographic analysis for me.

338
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:11,874
Oxygen, nitrogen, liquid water.

339
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,692
Only trace levels of CO2.

340
00:29:17,185 --> 00:29:18,201
What?

341
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,002
It means
there won't be much vegetation.

342
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,887
The thermometer won't be spending
much time above zero, either.

343
00:29:25,298 --> 00:29:26,950
But we can survive, right?

344
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:32,120
It'll be great.

345
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,471
What are we so happy about?

346
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,929
We're gonna live, Eli.

347
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:54,018
What about the turbulence
and the heat and the death?

348
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:57,076
All of that
would have happened by now.

349
00:30:57,323 --> 00:31:00,107
- The shield is protecting us.
- But you said we were out of power.

350
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,090
I was absolutely certain of that,

351
00:31:02,215 --> 00:31:05,082
I have never been more pleased
to be wrong in all my life.

352
00:31:53,052 --> 00:31:55,347
The lights just came back
on in my room.

353
00:31:56,252 --> 00:31:57,354
What's going on?

354
00:31:57,711 --> 00:31:58,718
Stand by.

355
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,027
Colonel!

356
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,551
You're right!

357
00:32:02,676 --> 00:32:05,059
The systems are coming back
online all over the ship.

358
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:07,361
There's a rumor spreading
we're still here.

359
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,459
We are.

360
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,513
Destiny needs all its power reserves
to protect itself, and us...

361
00:32:13,672 --> 00:32:14,678
Guys?

362
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:17,514
We're in the star.

363
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:22,432
That can't be right.
We're talking thousands of degrees.

364
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:24,426
We've just flown through the corona,

365
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:27,558
which is even hotter,
to say nothing of magnetic fields,

366
00:32:27,683 --> 00:32:29,238
gravitational stresses.

367
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:32,575
Destiny intended that from the moment
it entered the star system.

368
00:32:33,143 --> 00:32:35,547
You're telling me
it flew into the sun on purpose?

369
00:32:35,672 --> 00:32:38,263
- Why?
- To replenish its reserves.

370
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,902
- You're telling me this ship...
- Is powered by the stars themselves.

371
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,615
Solar powered, quite literally.

372
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,738
There is no other explanation.

373
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,537
The engine just came back on.
We're pulling out of it!

374
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,000
The shuttle.
We've got to call them back.

375
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,557
- We haven't communications yet.
- I'm working on it.

376
00:33:25,682 --> 00:33:27,796
If you don't figure it out
before we go into FTL

377
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,658
We can't strand those people here.

378
00:33:29,783 --> 00:33:31,445
This would be an excellent time

379
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,966
for you to trust me
to solve this problem.

380
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:44,859
I'm gonna put us in a high orbit,
spend a little time looking around

381
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:47,171
for the best spot
before we put down.

382
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:53,897
They're gone.

383
00:33:56,764 --> 00:33:59,046
I can't help but think
maybe they're the lucky ones.

384
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:01,289
- Don't, TJ.
- The planet is a rock.

385
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,583
I said stop it.

386
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:07,753
All right, here we go.

387
00:34:09,086 --> 00:34:10,798
<i>This is Young, come in.</i>

388
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:16,014
Right there, right there!

389
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:20,182
This is Scott.
Sir, how the hell...

390
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,073
We're just as surprised as you are.
I'll explain later.

391
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:24,937
Get your ass back aboard this ship.

392
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,611
Look, there it is!

393
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,244
Will do. Scott out!

394
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:35,673
Everybody hear that?

395
00:34:38,265 --> 00:34:39,934
We have a visual of you, Destiny.

396
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:41,745
Plotting an intercept course now.

397
00:34:49,932 --> 00:34:51,139
Colonel, stand by.

398
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,523
Brody, come here.

399
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:55,220
What is it?

400
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:57,437
I don't know yet.
Am I reading this right?

401
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,026
You've got to be kidding me.

402
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:04,852
We're so close,
you can almost touch it.

403
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,560
What's going on, Lieutenant?

404
00:35:07,196 --> 00:35:10,363
The Destiny is accelerating
away from us.

405
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:12,531
We can't match it.

406
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:15,446
Colonel, we have a problem here.

407
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:16,841
What is it?

408
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:20,010
<i>We can see you,
but the shuttle's computer can't come up</i>

409
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:23,495
<i>with an intercept solution.
Destiny is accelerating too fast.</i>

410
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,882
I'm trying to put something
in manually here, but...

411
00:35:26,445 --> 00:35:28,374
There's no way
to cross the "T", sir.

412
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:30,523
We're gonna fall short.

413
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,090
You're on full power, yes?

414
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,552
I put the throttle up right away.
It's just not gonna be enough.

415
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,623
<i>You must have
afterburners or something...</i>

416
00:35:40,748 --> 00:35:42,222
It's not an F-16, Eli!

417
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,474
It's a spaceship.

418
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:47,060
Is there anything
we can do from this end?

419
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,584
Is there any way
to slow the Destiny down?

420
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:50,773
That would do it.

421
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:53,178
Negative.

422
00:36:00,161 --> 00:36:01,450
We're out of ideas here.

423
00:36:02,503 --> 00:36:03,647
Come on, guys.

424
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:06,720
Come on.

425
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:12,795
I want you to turn
and head directly towards the planet.

426
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,926
We'll send you the exact course
in a moment.

427
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:18,278
<i>No, no, no, the planet is a rock.</i>
We'd rather take our chances trying...

428
00:36:18,403 --> 00:36:20,552
<i>Do what I'm saying.
We don't have much time.</i>

429
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,743
In order to reach the star,

430
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:38,862
Destiny used an aerobraking maneuver
to slow down.

431
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:42,354
I'm suggesting Lieutenant Scott
perform a slingshot maneuver

432
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:44,660
around the planet
to do exactly the opposite.

433
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,036
A gravity boost.

434
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,158
<i>It should put Destiny
directly in our path.</i>

435
00:36:48,283 --> 00:36:51,687
We're all aboard with that idea, Doctor.
Just give me the course and speed.

436
00:36:52,114 --> 00:36:54,367
This planet's getting pretty big
in the windows here.

437
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,220
One moment.

438
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,185
I got it.

439
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,099
There's many variables.
Are you sure?

440
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:09,520
Math boy.

441
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,563
Send it.

442
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:14,275
Okay, math boy.

443
00:37:15,807 --> 00:37:17,192
Sending the new course now.

444
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,572
Is this gonna work?

445
00:37:18,896 --> 00:37:20,142
It's gonna be close.

446
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,207
Got it.
All right, everybody, hang on again.

447
00:38:11,818 --> 00:38:12,877
That's them.

448
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,401
Why am I watching this on TV?

449
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,507
Okay, we're only gonna
get one shot at this.

450
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:25,510
Wish it wasn't
the first time I tried it.

451
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:28,190
There they are.

452
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,646
You've got us lined up.
You're doing fine.

453
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:36,816
No, he isn't.

454
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:38,565
We're coming up on them too fast.

455
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:50,496
Our relative velocity is too great.

456
00:38:50,892 --> 00:38:53,669
Unless you can match our speed,
you're gonna crash into the ship.

457
00:38:53,794 --> 00:38:55,123
This is all we've got.

458
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:58,752
It's coming up pretty fast on us!

459
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,046
- I know, I know, I know.
- We have to come left!

460
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:04,062
- A little this way, Lieutenant.
- What we need is more speed.

461
00:39:04,694 --> 00:39:08,178
Fire maneuvering thrusters.
That might just make the difference.

462
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:28,031
Main engines off!

463
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:38,943
Thrusters off.

464
00:39:39,353 --> 00:39:41,555
Docking clamps engaged.

465
00:39:42,474 --> 00:39:43,797
We're still in one piece!

466
00:39:46,325 --> 00:39:47,339
Well done!

467
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:49,210
Well done!

468
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:52,285
We're on our way down.

469
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:16,072
I'm dead serious about it.

470
00:40:16,197 --> 00:40:19,203
That was the worst shuttle docking
I have ever seen in my life.

471
00:40:19,328 --> 00:40:21,752
What are you talking about?
I barely even dented it!

472
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,281
- The grinding noise!
- At the very least,

473
00:40:24,406 --> 00:40:26,178
there is a giant scrape
along the bottom.

474
00:40:26,303 --> 00:40:28,842
I'm gonna make you put on a space suit,
fix it right now.

475
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,389
Sergeant, we're gonna need
high temperature

476
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:35,213
- spaceship paint for Scott here.
- Yes, sir. I believe I've found some.

477
00:40:37,124 --> 00:40:38,477
Dr. Rush, have a seat.

478
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:40,842
These two have even showered.

479
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,231
No, thanks.

480
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,900
Come on, we should celebrate.

481
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:47,861
Celebrate what?
That we're back where we started?

482
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,948
Come on, have a seat, Rush.

483
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,700
- Some other time.
- All right,

484
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,619
give him a double ration.
He deserves it.

485
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,455
Why's that, then?

486
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:00,373
I'm in a good mood.

487
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:03,753
We're to be rewarded
at your whim, then?

488
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,837
No, no... Just stop.

489
00:41:05,962 --> 00:41:07,704
What, you want some reasons?

490
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,341
I'll give you three.

491
00:41:10,317 --> 00:41:12,177
You were right
about the power situation.

492
00:41:13,796 --> 00:41:14,805
Not really.

493
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,736
You figured out the subspace
communications, how to call the shuttle.

494
00:41:19,124 --> 00:41:22,687
- We needed to get those supplies back.
- You took your name out of the lottery.

495
00:41:25,507 --> 00:41:26,608
So did you.

496
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,297
I was injured.
You actually made a sacrifice.

497
00:41:35,414 --> 00:41:36,701
Unless you knew...

498
00:41:39,286 --> 00:41:41,748
That Destiny was gonna make it
all along.

499
00:41:44,848 --> 00:41:46,094
Cheers, everyone.

500
00:41:57,698 --> 00:41:58,858
Let it go, sir.

501
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:02,144
He didn't know. I saw his face.

502
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,728
- There's no way.
- No.

503
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,147
What if he did?

504
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:10,211
He's right, sir.

505
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:11,935
Let it go.

506
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:16,781
A lot of work.
