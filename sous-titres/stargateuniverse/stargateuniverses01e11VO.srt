1
00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:03,419
This is what Destiny intended
from the moment it entered the system.

2
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:09,050
We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,423 --> 00:00:12,331
The ship came here for a reason.

4
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:15,724
Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,018
He and Young are bumping heads.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,987
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:26,067
I don't know what to do with myself.
I'm the last person who should be here.

8
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:30,196
You're the wrong man for the job.
You don't believe in the mission.

9
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,360
Neural interface?

10
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:36,142
A repository of knowledge
that can be downloaded into one's mind.

11
00:00:36,478 --> 00:00:38,496
Do you know what this device
did to General O'Neill?

12
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,624
- The informations overwhelmed him.
- It damn near killed him.

13
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,086
Young is not going to listen,
and Dr. Rush,

14
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,901
well, like you said,
he's in no hurry to come home.

15
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,122
He's completely unresponsive.

16
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:51,550
You just couldn't wait?

17
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:54,762
Anyone who had access to that room
was ordered not to sit in that chair.

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,389
You wanted somebody there

19
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:59,152
because you didn't have the guts
to do it yourself!

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,032
This is someone trying to undermine
the Colonel's authority.

21
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:03,576
We cannot let that happen!

22
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,314
Somebody's trying to frame me.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,401
Where's Rush?

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,858
He didn't make it.

25
00:01:52,786 --> 00:01:53,936
No headaches?

26
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,407
Any blurry vision?

27
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,408
I'm fine.

28
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:59,238
You sleeping okay?

29
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,774
I'm good. I gotta go.

30
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,961
You lost someone under your command.

31
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:12,608
Most recently, three people.
Gorman, Spencer, and Rush.

32
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,591
It happens.

33
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:15,718
I know how much it affects you.

34
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:18,149
In different ways, I let them down.

35
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:21,766
- If you ever want to talk, I'm here.
- I don't.

36
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:22,808
You should.

37
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,851
I'm sorry?

38
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:28,497
You felt like you let
Sergeant Spencer down.

39
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:29,730
We all do.

40
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:32,568
There's been a lot going on
between you and Rush.

41
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,363
- What are you saying?
- That a lot has been left unresolved.

42
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:38,577
Another time.

43
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:47,958
Off to file your latest report
back to Earth?

44
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,161
That's right.

45
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:52,463
I'm curious about the details
you intend to provide

46
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,216
regarding the incident
with Dr. Rush.

47
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:57,134
Exactly what happened.

48
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:02,239
I'm scheduled to file my report
with Earth later today,

49
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:05,184
and it may cast some doubt

50
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,793
on your version of events.

51
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:09,230
There were only two people
on that planet, me and Rush.

52
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,174
I'm talking about the obvious issues
between the two of you.

53
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:14,842
That doesn't change anything.

54
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,529
If you want to accuse me,

55
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,739
you should have the guts
to come out and accuse me.

56
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:23,035
- I don't have proof of anything.
- You just want to be in charge again.

57
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,204
I'm saying you had plenty of motive.

58
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,376
Really?

59
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:29,959
Do you think that I want people
suspecting me of murder?

60
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:33,754
Maybe that burden is easier to bear
than actually dealing with Rush.

61
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,090
I'll admit it, I don't miss the man.

62
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,267
I say we're all better off.

63
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,221
That's reassuring.

64
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,680
So if you don't measure up,
you just get left for dead?

65
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:59,670
What exactly is the criteria, then,
for sticking around?

66
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:01,236
Do you agree?

67
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:04,118
Let's do this.

68
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:12,001
<i>All good?</i>

69
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:13,419
All good.

70
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:19,870
When you get a chance,
can you check the shower system?

71
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:22,595
- The pressure's been kind of low.
- Sure, once I'm done here.

72
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,931
Caine's pretty cute.

73
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:28,893
There is nothing sexier
than a widower.

74
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:31,280
A man who's proven
that he can make a commitment

75
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,788
and is single through
no fault of his own.

76
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,942
- <i>What more could you ask for?</i>
- I can hear you.

77
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:42,976
I'm so sorry!

78
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:44,992
<i>How about we just...</i>

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,032
<i>Carry on like nothing happened?</i>

80
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:49,413
Thanks.

81
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:54,255
God... Kill me now.

82
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:59,089
All right, I think we're ready.

83
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:13,406
<i>Welcome aboard Destiny.</i>

84
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:15,279
<i>I'm Lieutenant Matthew Scott.</i>

85
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:24,675
- You okay?
- Excuse me?

86
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:29,179
<i>Who are you?</i>

87
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:50,187
Sergeant, what happened?

88
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:53,024
I have absolutely no idea, sir.

89
00:06:58,324 --> 00:06:59,974
Now, what do you think?

90
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:03,297
I'm an IT tech.
You know, I fix earth computers.

91
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:05,674
Not ancient communication devices.

92
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:08,260
Malfunction in the connection?

93
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,013
- That's quite a hiccup.
- I've seen worse.

94
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,558
We don't exactly know
what these stones do, do we?

95
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,810
Not personally.

96
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:20,647
I just got put on stone duty
'cause Riley's not back on his feet yet.

97
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:23,859
Sir, you have been
under quite a bit of stress.

98
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,403
You're not suggesting
that I imagined it?

99
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:32,201
Whoever took over your body
was acting...

100
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,078
- Kind of strangely
- Look...

101
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,164
There is no way that I hallucinated
that ship or that alien.

102
00:07:37,726 --> 00:07:39,583
My imagination isn't that good.

103
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:43,921
I was on a ship, and I saw an alien.

104
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:46,238
Now...

105
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,135
I want to know exactly what happened,
what went wrong and why.

106
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,264
Until then, the communications room
and that device are off-limits.

107
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:56,023
Understood?

108
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,541
- Got a minute?
- Please, sit.

109
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,586
You know, I always figured
limited resources meant

110
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,094
that every day would be
a struggle for survival,

111
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:29,409
but I never thought
it would come to this.

112
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:32,356
- That's some sort of hint?
- Yeah, it's a hint.

113
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,050
If you're wondering what to get me
for christmas, I need socks.

114
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:39,202
I heard about today's incident.

115
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:41,495
Caine's looking into it.

116
00:08:43,204 --> 00:08:46,984
You know, I find it interesting
that the device just happens

117
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,987
to malfunction moments after we had
our conversation this morning.

118
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,739
- I guess it's kind of coincidental.
- That's one word.

119
00:08:53,251 --> 00:08:54,658
Another is "convenient".

120
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,201
And another is "surprising".

121
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:58,368
Okay, your turn.

122
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,342
You actually think that...

123
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:05,460
This will keep me
from filing my report back to Earth?

124
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,380
Actually, yeah.
No, I'm pretty sure it will.

125
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,970
When the time comes,

126
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:19,271
let's hope that those
who sit in judgment of you

127
00:09:19,812 --> 00:09:21,727
grant the mercy you denied Dr. Rush.

128
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:25,708
I believe you mean
"allegedly" denied Dr. Rush.

129
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:28,382
Communications with Earth
will resume

130
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:31,403
as soon as I am completely satisfied
that the next attempt to connect

131
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,989
will not result
in another coincidence,

132
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,623
or convenience,

133
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:37,284
or a surprise.

134
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:55,835
Thank you.

135
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,455
We have tomatoes...

136
00:09:59,304 --> 00:10:01,513
We finally have tomatoes!

137
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:02,601
More or less.

138
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,362
That's odd.

139
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,419
So I was talking to Dr. Inman,
and she said the hydroponics team

140
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:22,668
will have strawberries for us
in about a month.

141
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:26,041
Sort of strawberries.
Talk to me when they start growing meat.

142
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,377
Actually, they're working
on a soy-based protein.

143
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:32,376
Happy thanksgiving, everyone.
Enjoy your tofurkey.

144
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,975
You're in a bad mood.

145
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:39,392
- What's the matter?
- I haven't slept much.

146
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:42,801
Colonel Young has me working
round the clock trying to figure out

147
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:45,857
- everything that Rush was working on...
- You can't be serious.

148
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:50,251
Colonel Young was willing
to sacrifice his own life

149
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:52,985
so that one of us could have a shot
at getting on the shuttle

150
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,055
when the ship was heading
towards that star.

151
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,864
You think he's
a cold-blooded murderer?

152
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,532
I wasn't saying that.

153
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,072
It's fine.

154
00:11:04,684 --> 00:11:07,167
Can you believe it?
Tomatoes!

155
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:11,753
What?

156
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,717
From the second we got on this ship,
they've been calling all the shots.

157
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:19,886
What we eat, where we sleep.
What we do and when.

158
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:21,925
And we just sit back and let them.

159
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:24,141
They're the ones with the guns.

160
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:27,394
<i>I mean, we have every right
to be afraid.</i>

161
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:31,739
<i>Look at what happened
to the last person to challenge them.</i>

162
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:34,238
<i>So...</i>

163
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:36,694
What do you think we should do?

164
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:41,103
I don't know...

165
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:53,279
Purple plants?
Are you kidding me?

166
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:56,340
Purple chlorophyll is sensitive
to red and infrared light.

167
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,092
The planet's probably
orbiting a red dwarf.

168
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,471
The kino says breathable atmosphere,
water, and oxygen.

169
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,013
I'm concerned about potential
stellar flare activity.

170
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:06,266
Spot radiation.

171
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,977
All right, then. We'll suit up.

172
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:18,664
You've got to see this.

173
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,305
It just showed up.

174
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,101
Bringing it up...

175
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:52,505
Now.

176
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,572
What is it doing?

177
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:06,284
Nothing, yet.
It's just sitting there.

178
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:10,080
We should try communicating with it.

179
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,318
How?

180
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,253
We have broadcast capability.

181
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,461
Of course, there's no way
they'd understand us.

182
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:21,591
But I guess there's only
one way to find out.

183
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:27,889
Two alien encounters in a day.
What are the chances?

184
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:30,601
I am thinking likely... Zero.

185
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,671
Okay, sending... Now.

186
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,047
Let's hope they speak Ancient.

187
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,277
This can't be a coincidence.

188
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,397
I bet you I was
on that ship this morning.

189
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,656
You piqued their curiosity,
they came to check on us?

190
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,617
I'm thinking they've been
checking on us for a while.

191
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,887
There's no other way
they can find us this fast.

192
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:53,748
They... Answered back.

193
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,758
That's not a translation.

194
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,972
- They answered in English.
- Now, how the hell is that possible?

195
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,348
What did you say?

196
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:13,530
"We're peaceful humans
from planet Earth.

197
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:15,529
We mean you no harm
and we'd like to meet you."

198
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,064
- What do I do? What do I say back?
- Nothing.

199
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:20,025
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

200
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,573
Get our weapons on-line.
This is Colonel Young.

201
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:25,327
All personnel,
report to designated areas.

202
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:27,240
I need you and Greer
in that shuttle.

203
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:40,921
Something's happening.

204
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:51,139
I think they're launching
smaller ships.

205
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
Oh, my god.

206
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:06,613
Only 30% of the weapons
are coming on-line.

207
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,406
Rush put limits.

208
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,327
Right, after what happened to Riley.

209
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,060
We were still in the process
of checking each gun's functionality.

210
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:14,371
Find a way around it.

211
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:39,896
Disengaging.

212
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,381
Come on.

213
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:09,035
First real space battle over here.

214
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,314
- You got it?
- Just about.

215
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,579
Activate the forward battery.

216
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,414
That's what I'm trying to do.

217
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:52,969
- Come on, get back. Come on.
- Let's go.

218
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:08,652
We're taking heavy fire!

219
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:11,130
- Can you boost power to the shields?
- I'm workin' on it.

220
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:13,239
Shield power is being
drained by the weapons.

221
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,791
Come on, move, go.

222
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,543
Stay back!

223
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,799
We've got surges all over the ship.
The weapons system wasn't ready.

224
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:33,968
Eli, everyone onboard this ship
is counting on you.

225
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,763
- I don't need to hear that.
- You can do this.

226
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:39,449
- No. No, I can't!
- Yes, you can.

227
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:42,288
- Why is this all on me? What about him?
- I don't care.

228
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:45,730
Both of you!
I need this ship working now!

229
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,191
You should've thought of that
before you got rid of Rush.

230
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:51,069
Just fix it.

231
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:45,010
You guys okay?

232
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:46,135
Check her!

233
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:40,762
They're pulling back.

234
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:09,704
Colonel Young, this is Airman Dunning.
Please respond.

235
00:20:12,449 --> 00:20:14,999
- They're retreating.
- We got 'em on the run.

236
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:18,132
Let's give them something
to remember us by.

237
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:29,635
I need you to end pursuit
and fall back to Destiny.

238
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,511
But...

239
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:33,314
<i>Do not engage.
I repeat, do not engage.</i>

240
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,663
Chloe may be on board
one of those ships.

241
00:20:52,436 --> 00:20:54,262
- What the hell happened?
- Easy, Lieutenant.

242
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,421
It was nobody's fault.
We were not ready for this.

243
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,317
- They gave up pretty quickly.
- The attack may have been a distraction

244
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:02,134
to try to come in close
and take prisoners, try to gain intel.

245
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:04,501
- Why are we the enemy?
- I don't know.

246
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:06,887
Sir, that ship is still
within shuttle range.

247
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:08,683
- Request permission to...
- Denied.

248
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,824
You wouldn't stand a chance.
With me.

249
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:12,940
- What are we going to do?
- I'm going after her.

250
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,568
- How?
- The communication device.

251
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:16,717
Sir, you are only assuming
that's the same ship...

252
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,568
Guess I'll find out
when I'm on board.

253
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:52,442
Let's elevate this.

254
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,625
Have a seat,
and I'll get to you as soon as I can.

255
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,291
Thanks so much.

256
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,133
- Anything I can do?
- Take your pick.

257
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,042
Grab some gauze.

258
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:04,893
Chloe was taken.

259
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:06,477
What? How?

260
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,535
One of the ships latched on,
cut a hole.

261
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:12,962
- I can't get a pulse over here!
- Grab the bag.

262
00:22:13,384 --> 00:22:14,963
Keep the pressure on him, please.

263
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:20,546
Caine, we need you.

264
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,092
Okay, that's good.

265
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,604
Tighter.

266
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,569
Let me do it.

267
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not going to happen.

268
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:48,282
For the record,
I think this is a very bad idea.

269
00:22:49,072 --> 00:22:51,452
Yes, but it's the best
of the bad ideas.

270
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,407
Go.

271
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:59,085
I think I got most of the weapons
back on-line.

272
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:02,706
- How long is he going in for?
- 20 minutes, then we pull him out.

273
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:07,719
You can always go back in
if you don't find her.

274
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:19,874
<i>We are not your enemy.</i>

275
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,149
We mean you no harm.

276
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,881
I don't think it understands you.

277
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,884
They spoke English.

278
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,637
<i>They sent a one-word message.</i>

279
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,565
<i>For all we know, they have a translation
device on their ship or something.</i>

280
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,599
<i>Then they would have
sent it in Ancient.</i>

281
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:37,934
Why did you attack us?

282
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,211
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

283
00:26:32,502 --> 00:26:33,966
Why did you do that?

284
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:39,289
You want to help me?

285
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:59,018
This is how you read my mind.

286
00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:03,529
Do you understand?

287
00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:07,950
This one transmits.

288
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,379
This one receives.

289
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:20,513
Like this. Here, like this.

290
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,127
Do not engage.

291
00:27:40,252 --> 00:27:42,285
Chloe may be aboard
one of those ships.

292
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:52,628
- What happened?
- He's back.

293
00:27:53,312 --> 00:27:54,356
What just happened?

294
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:56,424
The alien ship is closing in on us.

295
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,535
Send me back.

296
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:27,872
Send me back!

297
00:28:37,027 --> 00:28:38,077
Good to go.

298
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:40,185
Ready.

299
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,975
It's not working.

300
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,693
Why isn't it working?

301
00:28:52,624 --> 00:28:53,624
Untie me.

302
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,132
There doesn't seem to be
anything wrong with the device.

303
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,592
Did you find Chloe?

304
00:29:25,628 --> 00:29:28,099
Guys? You may have noticed
they're attacking us again.

305
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,438
Our shields aren't
going to hold for much longer.

306
00:29:34,787 --> 00:29:37,055
Bring the main weapon on-line.

307
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:38,905
Fire on the big ship.

308
00:29:39,464 --> 00:29:41,450
Chloe is still on board that ship!

309
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:42,905
Do it now, Eli!

310
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,130
Return fire!

311
00:29:44,255 --> 00:29:45,700
Everything we've got!

312
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:23,737
We can't keep this up.
The weapons system is overloading.

313
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,240
- Shields are down almost 50%.
- I know!

314
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:29,660
- Where are you going?
- To try and save Chloe.

315
00:30:33,683 --> 00:30:35,233
It's okay, it's okay.

316
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:40,632
We have to go.

317
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:42,108
Here.

318
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,225
Oh, God...

319
00:30:54,682 --> 00:30:56,132
Where are we going?

320
00:30:58,211 --> 00:30:59,211
This way.

321
00:31:08,578 --> 00:31:09,343
Report!

322
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:10,765
Bad and more bad.

323
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,578
Too much power
is going to the weapons.

324
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,693
- Our shields are going to fail.
- Bolster them.

325
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:17,875
Devote all remaining weapons power
to the main weapon.

326
00:31:18,194 --> 00:31:20,094
Keep firing on the big ship.

327
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,950
Not like you,
taking the shuttle without asking.

328
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,650
He'll say no, and I don't want
to disobey an order.

329
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:36,136
- You got a problem with that?
- You want to save her?

330
00:31:36,672 --> 00:31:37,520
Do it.

331
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,688
I'm going.
You don't have to.

332
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:41,725
I'm already here.

333
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,163
- They're retreating.
- Keep firing.

334
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:50,074
We fire again,
and we risk blowing ourselves up.

335
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,493
I don't have a choice.
Do it.

336
00:31:56,185 --> 00:31:57,957
They're...
They're retreating.

337
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:01,695
All of them except that one.

338
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,508
Wait.

339
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,838
They're gone.

340
00:32:57,788 --> 00:32:59,393
Colonel Young said you were dead.

341
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,611
Did he?

342
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,731
- Did he say how it happened?
- Rock slide.

343
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:06,544
Obviously, he was wrong again.

344
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:12,197
This is Greer.

345
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,365
<i>Come in.</i>

346
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:18,203
Go ahead.

347
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:21,900
You are not going to believe this.

348
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:37,096
I managed to...

349
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:38,807
activate the...

350
00:33:39,248 --> 00:33:41,788
systems on the crashed ship.

351
00:33:42,826 --> 00:33:43,896
Found a database.

352
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:47,149
I'd only just begun
to look through it when...

353
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:49,234
aliens showed up.

354
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:51,870
I guess I must have
accidentally activated

355
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:53,945
some kind of distress beacon.

356
00:33:55,275 --> 00:33:57,785
Anyway, I'm glad I did.
I would have died out there.

357
00:33:58,351 --> 00:34:00,120
There are a few people who thought

358
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,888
Colonel Young left you to die
on purpose.

359
00:34:03,962 --> 00:34:05,381
I imagine there were.

360
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:09,296
He would have rightly assumed
that I was... I was gone,

361
00:34:09,678 --> 00:34:11,078
in the rock slide.

362
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,468
So, what happened
when the aliens brought you

363
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:15,836
on their ship?

364
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:17,111
To be honest?

365
00:34:18,594 --> 00:34:20,279
I don't remember that much.

366
00:34:22,028 --> 00:34:25,187
The few times I was conscious,
they were... probing my mind.

367
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:30,484
I'd rather not think about it.

368
00:34:31,484 --> 00:34:33,125
I know they were frustrated.

369
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,408
I seemed to be able to resist
giving them the information they wanted.

370
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:40,160
He used their own
neural interface against them,

371
00:34:40,656 --> 00:34:42,755
getting what he needed
so we could escape.

372
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,780
Location of the fighter bay,

373
00:34:44,905 --> 00:34:47,045
basic operating systems.

374
00:34:47,412 --> 00:34:48,612
Anything else?

375
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,655
Like why they wanted to destroy us?

376
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,465
I don't think they did.

377
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,517
What they really want

378
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,090
is Destiny.

379
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:03,100
Probably only care about us
because we recently came aboard.

380
00:35:05,546 --> 00:35:06,660
What they want

381
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,078
is a way past her defenses,

382
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,856
try and find out
what secrets she might hold.

383
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:21,914
Unfortunately, I didn't have time
to find out any more.

384
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:26,415
My first priority was getting
Chloe and I

385
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,661
off the ship.

386
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,044
It's good to have you back.

387
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:34,768
Both of you.

388
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,567
I suppose you're wondering...

389
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:19,236
- Why I didn't tell everyone the truth.
- It's your word against mine.

390
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,721
I didn't tell anyone you tried
to frame me for Spencer's death.

391
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:25,165
Well, that's true.

392
00:36:28,034 --> 00:36:30,280
No, I just wanted to know
whether I can assume

393
00:36:30,758 --> 00:36:32,689
that you are going to
try and kill me again

394
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,255
next chance you get.

395
00:36:35,205 --> 00:36:37,088
I saved you from those aliens.

396
00:36:38,507 --> 00:36:40,125
You fired on the alien ship

397
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,623
- while I was still aboard.
- Well, so was Chloe.

398
00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:46,286
That was a command decision,
protecting the greater good.

399
00:36:49,196 --> 00:36:50,374
Yes, indeed.

400
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,193
Look...

401
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,462
I realize...

402
00:36:55,534 --> 00:36:57,069
That I did provoke you.

403
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,326
If it means anything...

404
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:02,970
Regret leaving you on that planet.

405
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,836
Don't get me wrong.
You deserved it,

406
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:07,148
but I regret that I lost control,

407
00:37:07,273 --> 00:37:10,561
that I became a man that
I couldn't respect anymore.

408
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:13,795
You're here, I'm here.
We just have to live with it, don't we?

409
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,790
So does everyone else on board.

410
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,901
They don't need the distraction.

411
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:20,839
They don't need
to doubt their leadership,

412
00:37:20,964 --> 00:37:23,282
and this ship needs to be ready
for the next encounter.

413
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:33,373
If we haven't found
our way home by then.

414
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,993
Of course.

415
00:37:38,928 --> 00:37:40,966
So, what?

416
00:37:41,687 --> 00:37:43,594
We just pretend nothing happened?

417
00:37:44,293 --> 00:37:46,555
Well, it's not like
we were ever friends.

418
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:56,064
For the sake of the crew.

419
00:37:57,464 --> 00:37:59,056
For the sake of the crew.

420
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,008
Hey there.

421
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:20,801
- Do you mind?
- No, it's okay.

422
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:28,232
You want to try some?

423
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,681
What is it?

424
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,324
A little something
that Dr. Inman's been working on.

425
00:38:32,932 --> 00:38:34,742
She claims it tastes like gin.

426
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:37,648
I say it's a little closer
to rubbing alcohol.

427
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,312
Solid sales pitch.

428
00:38:41,264 --> 00:38:42,319
No, thank you.

429
00:38:42,914 --> 00:38:43,927
All right.

430
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,451
What do you think?
You and James,

431
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,679
any chance there?

432
00:38:50,804 --> 00:38:52,663
It could just get really awkward.

433
00:38:53,602 --> 00:38:55,274
You know, if things didn't work out.

434
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:59,298
Being stuck on this ship with someone
you've had a bad relationship with?

435
00:38:59,776 --> 00:39:00,789
No thanks.

436
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:03,590
It's probably best
to just keep things...

437
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,830
professional.

438
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:06,964
For as long as we can.

439
00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:08,945
Anyways, I mean, we'll see.

440
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,800
If we're here much longer,

441
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:14,555
I hereby reserve the right
to completely change my mind.

442
00:41:47,654 --> 00:41:49,203
The Colonel's dangerous.

443
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:51,794
We need to do something about that.

444
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,213
I tried.

445
00:41:54,156 --> 00:41:54,970
I know.

446
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,659
Damn near killed me for it.

447
00:41:59,187 --> 00:42:00,909
Next time will be different.
