1
00:00:00,613 --> 00:00:03,586
This is what Destiny intended
from the moment it entered the system.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,978
We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,425
The ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,812
Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:19,185
He and Young are bumping heads.

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,089
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,765
We pretend nothing happened.

8
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,182
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,027
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:30,321
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,115
I'm not sick.

12
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,285
What about the father?

13
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:41,082
This is unlike other kind of technology
we've encountered before.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,585
If they're indigenous to this universe,
they might be willing to trade.

15
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:47,296
You lost the kino?

16
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,548
No, I took a wrong turn
trying to steer it out.

17
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,468
I just need to take a look
and get my bearings.

18
00:00:56,426 --> 00:00:59,349
We haven't found any other sort of exit,
or access to ground level.

19
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:01,977
- We're not going to make it.
- Fire in the hole!

20
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:08,074
- It didn't had the desired effect.
- We just made things worse.

21
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:11,903
God be with you, Colonel.

22
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:18,019
Riley...

23
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,372
Eli would want someone documenting
the efforts to rescue the team

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,477
left behind.

25
00:01:22,602 --> 00:01:25,235
Given that Eli is one of the team
that was left behind,

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,148
I would have thought he'd want
everyone doing anything possible

27
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:29,422
to help rescue them.

28
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,798
You didn't like my idea.

29
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,050
Telling Destiny to go back
isn't going to work.

30
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:35,928
- How do you know?
- Because I've already tried it!

31
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:39,173
I'm done.

32
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:44,163
The Stargate aboard this ship
is much more primitive

33
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:46,659
than the later models
found in the Milky Way.

34
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:50,034
As you can see from this map,
each time Destiny stops,

35
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:52,837
it's in range
of only a small group of gates.

36
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:55,712
That means the next time
we drop out of FTL,

37
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,867
the planet the team was stranded on

38
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,994
will no longer be in range
of Destiny.

39
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,413
However, Dr. Rush
and Mr. Brody are working on...

40
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,417
That's weird.

41
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:07,877
What happened?

42
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,658
The battery must have died.

43
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,548
I just got this one.

44
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:17,638
It wasn't me.

45
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,659
I am not the sort of person
who just jumps into bed with anyone.

46
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:22,808
I thought we...

47
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:29,231
Colonel Young asked you
to check on me.

48
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:32,583
Yes, but he's asking me
to keep tabs on everybody.

49
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:34,786
He believes in you.

50
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:36,405
He doesn't have much choice.

51
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:39,033
I'm also here
because I'm your friend.

52
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:42,665
I'm sorry, it's just that...

53
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:47,500
Rush, come in.

54
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,001
Several systems are down.

55
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,837
Looks like Destiny's activated
some kind of power-saving mode.

56
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:55,174
That's strange,
our reserves are at maximum capacity

57
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,745
from the last recharge.

58
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,183
Life support's fine.
I should be able to work round it,

59
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:01,357
get the lights back on
in a couple of minutes.

60
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:02,932
Maybe we shouldn't.

61
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:04,058
What?

62
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,740
Work around it.
There's got to be a good reason.

63
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:08,784
This whole ship is falling apart.

64
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:11,982
Computers don't last forever.
Maybe it's a malfunction.

65
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:14,966
We're not going to be able
to do anything in the dark.

66
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,810
We have two days of water, tops.

67
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:20,880
We'll find more.

68
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:22,015
Step one,

69
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:24,199
we get out of these tunnels.

70
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,006
We're off to a bad start.

71
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:27,706
We'll find food and water.

72
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:31,063
- They can't turn the ship around.
- We'll use the gates to catch up.

73
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,286
In order to connect the dots
between here and the Destiny,

74
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:36,239
there have to be gates
in range of each other

75
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:39,844
between this planet
and wherever Destiny stops next.

76
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:42,980
Plus, this remote only tells you

77
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:46,308
which gates are in range of this planet,
not where they are.

78
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,024
There's no way to know
which direction we'd be going.

79
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:51,814
And in case that's not bad enough,
we have no idea

80
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,524
where Destiny went.

81
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,193
- One step at a time.
- Let's keep a positive attitude.

82
00:04:04,116 --> 00:04:06,245
C4 blast could have
destabilized the whole place.

83
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,455
- Great.
- We had to take the risk.

84
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,780
We're seriously...

85
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:19,091
All we can do right now
is keep moving.

86
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,961
Projet-SG (1.00)
www.projet-sg.com

87
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,010
Son of a...

88
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,001
What do we know?

89
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:56,126
Not much.

90
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:58,923
Several nonessential systems
automatically shut down.

91
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,172
We still only have limited control.

92
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,348
How about rescuing
the team we left behind?

93
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:06,293
We won't know if the planet
they were left on is reachable

94
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:08,468
until we've dropped out of FTL.

95
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:10,178
This is crazy.

96
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:13,656
You'd think some of these tunnels
would lead somewhere.

97
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,357
No wonder the people
that built this place died out.

98
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,467
They probably
all got lost down here.

99
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:21,085
Just wandered around thinking,

100
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,810
"If only we had thought
to put in a few more exits."

101
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:27,409
Or one of those maps
you see in a mall with a big red dot.

102
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,644
"You are here."

103
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:31,735
How hard is that?

104
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:34,034
I'd kill for
a big red dot right now.

105
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,535
I can't take this anymore.

106
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,329
All right, let's stop,
take a quick breather.

107
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,506
Five minutes.

108
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,000
Still looking for that kino?

109
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:56,722
So what are you doing?

110
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,066
I've been thinking
about using the gates.

111
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:00,943
And?

112
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:05,739
I may have painted
an overly bleak picture before.

113
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,664
I'll admit,
I was freaking out a bit.

114
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:11,203
And now?

115
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:16,166
We do know that Destiny
is traveling down a path,

116
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:19,962
basically a corridor
of gates left behind

117
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:22,440
by the ships
that were sent in advance.

118
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:24,621
It meanders somewhat, but generally,

119
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:26,541
it heads in one direction.

120
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:28,846
They wouldn't put gates
on every planet.

121
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,476
Obviously not.

122
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:33,851
People don't realize
how big a galaxy is.

123
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:34,768
Anyway...

124
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,036
Let's say the gates
in range of the planet we're on

125
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:46,488
are in this circle.

126
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:51,785
This circle represents
the gates in range

127
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,705
of Destiny the next time
it drops out of FTL.

128
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,248
We need to get to that circle.

129
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,598
Yeah, right.

130
00:06:57,746 --> 00:07:00,930
Now, hopefully, there are gates
in range of each other

131
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,588
between these circles.

132
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:06,757
Once we are in range of Destiny,
the address will show up on here.

133
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,678
You see how easy it is
to make a simple map?

134
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:15,476
How do we know
we're going the right way?

135
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:18,812
We don't,

136
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:22,101
but if we do go the wrong way,
we'll either run out of addresses

137
00:07:22,226 --> 00:07:24,026
because we've hit the edge
of the corridor,

138
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,266
or we'll run into planets
we've been to before

139
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:29,393
or at least addresses I'll hopefully
remember or recognize, but...

140
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,480
At least it's a 50-50 shot.

141
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:34,629
Good.

142
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,085
- We should really get moving.
- Why? It hasn't been five minutes.

143
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,544
Eli, seriously!

144
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:58,301
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

145
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,189
I suspected as much.

146
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,607
If it's true...

147
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,234
I know.

148
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:07,578
You're not going to tell Young?

149
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:09,053
It's not certain.

150
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:13,617
You have to tell him.

151
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:21,750
She's upset.
We all are.

152
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,052
But she's fine, though?

153
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:27,091
I don't have to worry
about putting her back out there?

154
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:31,838
A few words of encouragement from you
wouldn't hurt, though.

155
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,265
She thinks that you're only send her
because you don't have a choice...

156
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,433
I don't.

157
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:41,186
I know you think
she's a good soldier.

158
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,564
Is she aware I know
about her relationship with Scott?

159
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:49,278
She's not over him, either,
but that's not an issue.

160
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:51,113
Thanks.

161
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,129
There's something else...

162
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:00,414
I need to tell you.

163
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,248
That sounds serious.

164
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:06,879
- <i>Colonel Young, come in.</i>
- Rush, go ahead.

165
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,047
You're gonna wanna see this.

166
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,730
I'll be right there.

167
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:13,093
You were going to say?

168
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:18,509
It can wait.

169
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:21,344
It's more of a longer conversation.

170
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:32,738
When I was left behind on that planet
with the crashed alien ship...

171
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:33,956
I remember.

172
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:37,692
One of the things I saw there
appeared to be a map of this galaxy.

173
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:39,578
- Including the Stargates.
- And?

174
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,164
Mr. Brody and myself
have been working on our own map,

175
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,117
based on our own records

176
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:46,168
of where Destiny has been thus far.

177
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,420
I thought Destiny had a map
of where it's been.

178
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,006
But we're trying to create
a clearer picture of the galaxy...

179
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,883
Just cut to the chase.

180
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,385
I was hoping to have
some better news, but if I'm right...

181
00:09:57,412 --> 00:10:00,015
Then we are at the very edge
of this galaxy.

182
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,976
Now, how is that bad news?
Destiny travels between galaxies.

183
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:06,451
Yeah, but the space
between galaxies is huge.

184
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:08,357
Empty.

185
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,905
That's why that power-saving
protocol kicked in?

186
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,196
I don't know, it could be,
but there will be no more gates.

187
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:18,235
No chance of dialing back
to this system.

188
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:23,810
If we don't find them
the next time we drop out of FTL...

189
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:27,569
We won't have another chance.

190
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,473
Oh, my God.

191
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:42,099
What?

192
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:43,468
The kino.

193
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:46,603
Look, look, an exit!

194
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,983
- The kino found an exit.
- That's awesome. Where's the kino?

195
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,777
- I have no idea.
- Right. Exactly.

196
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:57,732
At least now we know
that there is a way out of here.

197
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,158
Left or right?
What's it going to be?

198
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,433
We're traveling blind,
so what difference does it make?

199
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:05,414
Left. I like left.

200
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:08,208
No offense to what you like,
man, but...

201
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,160
He's right.
We should go left.

202
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:15,257
How do you know?

203
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:18,761
Because that's what this map says.

204
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:23,683
There's been a few
of these along the way.

205
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,942
I thought they were just
decorative at first.

206
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,689
So far they've been the same
except for one thing.

207
00:11:31,204 --> 00:11:33,692
This symbol seems to be
in different places.

208
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:38,753
"You are here."

209
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:41,375
There have been maps down here
this whole time?

210
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,076
That's awesome.
Are you sure?

211
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,872
Well, this seems to be
the fork we're standing at.

212
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,172
There's only one way to find out.

213
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:54,005
- What are you doing?
- Going to go look for another one.

214
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,850
Greer!

215
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:13,440
She's right.
There's another map...

216
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:26,578
I tried.

217
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:29,769
I did, really!

218
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:32,918
I was about to tell him,
and then he got called away by Rush.

219
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,503
You should have told him anyway.

220
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,005
It sounded important.

221
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,223
So is this.

222
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:42,386
- I know.
- He's going to find out soon enough.

223
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,346
I mean, you're starting to show.

224
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:45,996
I know.

225
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,357
Are you afraid of
what he's going to say?

226
00:12:50,594 --> 00:12:52,729
Or not say, I don't know.

227
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,107
Tell him right now.

228
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:58,720
It just seems like
there's always something.

229
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,491
Matt!

230
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:06,028
I'm fine.

231
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,700
Oh, my God.

232
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,919
Come in, Greer!

233
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:19,123
Ron, can you hear me?

234
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,945
Maybe the signal
can't penetrate the rocks.

235
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:25,853
We could hear James pretty clearly.

236
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,120
Three hours.

237
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:41,658
Besides dialing,

238
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:43,552
checking for safe environment,

239
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:46,049
roughly eight to ten minutes
per planet.

240
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:47,609
Factor in time to get back,

241
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:50,284
we'll be able to see
roughly 20 planets.

242
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:53,215
At least we know
the direction to go in.

243
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,149
We'll find them, Sir.

244
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:56,414
Good luck.

245
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,650
<i>Colonel, it's TJ, come in?</i>

246
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:02,469
Go ahead.

247
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:04,145
<i>Have they left?</i>

248
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:07,443
Unfortunately,
it's a very short window.

249
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:10,009
<i>Do you have some time
to talk in private?</i>

250
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:11,667
I'm on my way to see to Dr. Volker,

251
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:14,086
talk about the charging plates,
putting them back online.

252
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:16,178
Nothing seems to be
working around here.

253
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:17,403
Can it wait?

254
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:26,948
Come on, buddy!

255
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,244
Wait, wait.

256
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,456
All right, stop!

257
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,650
Stop moving rocks.

258
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,296
We need to get out of here.

259
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,042
Look, I saw those rocks
coming down...

260
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:51,890
He would want us to get out of here,
especially if there was no hope for him.

261
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,311
You just say that because you think
you need to get us out.

262
00:14:56,818 --> 00:14:57,771
Gear up.

263
00:14:58,312 --> 00:15:00,148
Give me a second here.
Just... Go.

264
00:15:10,364 --> 00:15:11,464
Look, Greer?

265
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:15,732
I'm sorry, man.

266
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,878
Move, move, move,
this thing's coming down.

267
00:15:32,893 --> 00:15:33,741
Please.

268
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,100
The boy has to eat.

269
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,039
Look, don't you go near there.

270
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,605
- You got to let him out.
- I don't got to do nothing!

271
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:45,874
Mom?

272
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:48,608
The boy has to learn.

273
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:13,138
Can anybody hear me?

274
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:15,069
I'm here!

275
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,316
Scott, this is Greer, come in.

276
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,121
Come in...

277
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:36,026
At least the tremors have stopped.

278
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:39,541
Probably got far enough
from the cave-in.

279
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:08,667
I'll go.

280
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:00,299
Done.

281
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,854
Done.

282
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:33,278
He wasn't always like this.

283
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:35,613
You say that all the time.

284
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,948
He was a good man,

285
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:39,434
a good father.

286
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,120
- You were too young to remember.
- I hate him.

287
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:44,122
It's not his fault.

288
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,340
Don't care.

289
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,460
You need to be strong.
I know you got it in you.

290
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:51,934
He needs us, both of us.

291
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,607
Nobody else
is going to take care of him.

292
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:57,010
We need to go.

293
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,220
Where?

294
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,044
Far away. Both of us.

295
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,891
We need to get out of here.

296
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,812
Eli, hold up a second.

297
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,839
What?

298
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,363
I'm saying maybe the thing to do
is stay put.

299
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,241
If it is possible to connect the dots
between here and Destiny,

300
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,202
then Colonel Young is going to send
a team back to look for us.

301
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,348
We'd be better off
waiting for them to find us.

302
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:08,623
We don't know how long
Destiny is going to stop for.

303
00:20:09,094 --> 00:20:11,417
There might not be enough time
for them to get here,

304
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:13,738
and then to gate back to Destiny.

305
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,090
We need to take the chance.

306
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:34,357
Okay, dial it.

307
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:50,164
It's hard to see.

308
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:53,126
Looks pretty foggy.

309
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,712
But everything else is good.

310
00:20:57,271 --> 00:20:58,548
It's safe to go.

311
00:21:38,018 --> 00:21:39,018
Get out.

312
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:44,886
Get out.

313
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:47,263
I don't have any money.

314
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,384
Probably a good thing down here.

315
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:36,426
It'll take a minute
for the Gate list to refresh.

316
00:22:37,218 --> 00:22:39,565
If Destiny's in FTL,
it won't show up, right?

317
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:41,609
Right.

318
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:45,196
Shouldn't we spend more time
on these planets, to see if it does?

319
00:22:45,487 --> 00:22:47,255
What if it is out of FTL,

320
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,922
but just one planet away from here?

321
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:51,744
See, I knew this was a bad idea.

322
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,914
Didn't you say
we should stop being negative?

323
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:56,983
10 minutes.

324
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:58,708
We give each planet...

325
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:05,466
- You hear that?
- Of course we heard it.

326
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:07,844
Dial the Gate.

327
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,253
I'm dialing.

328
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:10,922
Dial faster.

329
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:12,181
I'm dialing!

330
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:56,491
Holy...

331
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:57,778
Go!

332
00:24:41,777 --> 00:24:43,856
Mom, we have to go!
Mom, wake up!

333
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,470
You should've let me burn.

334
00:25:19,147 --> 00:25:20,233
It's beautiful.

335
00:25:21,557 --> 00:25:23,562
Not that I'd want to be stuck here
for a long time,

336
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:25,606
but it is an incredible
sight to see.

337
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:31,487
This is our tenth planet.
We have less than an hour and a half.

338
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,157
This is a lot more complicated
than I'd anticipated.

339
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:38,202
Who'd have guessed Destiny had skipped
over so many planets with Gates on them?

340
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,996
Getting back should be much quicker.

341
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,293
We have extra kinos and a remote.
Time to split up, cover more planets.

342
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:47,007
Agreed.

343
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:51,007
We're going to find them.
We just need a bit of luck.

344
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,925
I'm afraid I don't believe in that.

345
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:56,804
So you'll take one team
and I'll take the other?

346
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,906
<i>The fires...</i>

347
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:10,523
<i>The fires were everywhere.</i>

348
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:12,651
<i>That oil burned hot.</i>

349
00:26:12,776 --> 00:26:15,151
Got so we forgot what a clean
breath of air felt like.

350
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:17,493
Emphysema, asthma, bronchitis.

351
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,840
They said none of the guys sent in
to put out the fires showed any effects.

352
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:22,788
Come on, you buy that?

353
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,292
How can that be true?
Those fires were everywhere...

354
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,468
The man's a living hell.

355
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:32,862
Sent by the devil himself
to torture me for all eternity.

356
00:26:33,277 --> 00:26:34,967
Just a little skin reaction,
they said.

357
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:37,386
Just a little itchy on the arm.

358
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:41,781
The FDA approved it though it'd never
been through any large-scale trials.

359
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,151
There were no side effects.

360
00:26:44,276 --> 00:26:45,841
They said it was the war,

361
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:47,231
not the vaccine.

362
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,273
Between 1998 and 2000,

363
00:26:49,654 --> 00:26:53,247
20,000 soldiers had to be hospitalized
after receiving the vaccine

364
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:55,613
even though they had never
been deployed overseas.

365
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,491
The Pentagon failed
to report that to Congress!

366
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:01,220
Wasn't as bad as
the sand fleas, though.

367
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:02,870
They got under your skin and how.

368
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,747
Carried all kinds of diseases.

369
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,499
Diseases you can't even say.

370
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:08,125
Tank busters.

371
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,726
Uranium depleted.
I loaded those munitions.

372
00:27:10,851 --> 00:27:13,105
Nothing dangerous coming off those.
What do you think?

373
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,717
18,000 times in two years
those alarms went off.

374
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,262
It's not the mustard gas,
never the mustard gas!

375
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,429
It was cigarettes.

376
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,473
Deodorant!
Can you believe that?

377
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,433
Chronic fatigue,
loss of muscle control,

378
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:26,560
headaches, dizziness, memory loss,

379
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:28,229
shortness of breath, brain cancer...

380
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,940
I'm going to kill him.
Put him out of his misery.

381
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,566
It was the war.

382
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,846
It was the war!

383
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:36,487
It wasn't the fires.
They were everywhere.

384
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,030
Big black billowing smoke.

385
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,032
The war is why he can't breathe.

386
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,261
Listen, I'm sorry.

387
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:02,551
One thing turned into another.
Next thing I know, a 5-minute update...

388
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:03,889
I'm pregnant.

389
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,933
You're pregnant?

390
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:28,372
How far along are you?

391
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:33,912
About 22 weeks.

392
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:36,649
It's yours.

393
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,042
Ours.

394
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:42,729
A baby.

395
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,872
On this ship...

396
00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:52,289
I'm keeping it.

397
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,276
No, I didn't...
I didn't say you shouldn't.

398
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:01,405
What are you saying?

399
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,166
We're going to make this work.

400
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,830
That's what we're going to do,
we're going to make it work.

401
00:29:46,354 --> 00:29:47,922
This is a problem.

402
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,089
What?

403
00:29:49,214 --> 00:29:53,332
The kino says the atmosphere on
the planet we just sent it to is toxic.

404
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:56,351
- We can't go through.
- We can't get that kino back.

405
00:29:56,476 --> 00:29:59,130
And we won't know
if the next address we try is safe.

406
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:01,853
- Dial another one.
- But I just said that...

407
00:30:01,978 --> 00:30:04,845
- We can't stay here, can we?
- No, no, but I...

408
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,586
You stay, I'll go, I'll go.
I'll radio back if it's safe.

409
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,033
Look, we stay here,
we're as good as dead anyway.

410
00:30:11,158 --> 00:30:12,268
Dial another one.

411
00:30:16,568 --> 00:30:17,594
They left you.

412
00:30:18,737 --> 00:30:19,648
Abandoned you.

413
00:30:19,773 --> 00:30:20,734
They did

414
00:30:21,235 --> 00:30:23,049
what they had to do.

415
00:30:25,335 --> 00:30:28,593
- They thought I was dead.
- Nobody's going to save you.

416
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:31,911
Nobody cares.

417
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:35,141
In the end, all there is

418
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:37,304
is you.

419
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:40,851
You alone.

420
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:52,313
Doctor says
there's an infection in his brain.

421
00:30:53,537 --> 00:30:55,144
There's nothing they can do for him.

422
00:30:58,665 --> 00:30:59,915
I enlisted.

423
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:02,943
What for?

424
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:06,405
I didn't get the scholarship.

425
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,948
But you worked so hard.

426
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,897
Wasn't fast enough.

427
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,621
You always said it wasn't his fault.

428
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:18,167
His choice wasn't wrong.

429
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,193
He just wanted to be somebody.

430
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,205
I want to be somebody.

431
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:27,092
You don't have anything
to prove to anyone.

432
00:31:27,443 --> 00:31:29,157
You didn't let him change you.

433
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:32,056
Nothing can hurt
the spirit God gave you...

434
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,647
I have to use it.

435
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:36,155
Don't I?

436
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:39,688
To make a difference.

437
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,168
You can still change your mind.

438
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:50,366
I'm not going to.

439
00:32:21,091 --> 00:32:23,670
All right, I'm okay.
It's cold and dark,

440
00:32:25,298 --> 00:32:27,820
but I can breathe,
and there's no crazy dinosaurs,

441
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:30,887
at least not yet.
Come on through.

442
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,592
It's kind of pretty.

443
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:55,973
Sometimes we would spend Christmas
at a cabin in Vermont.

444
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,141
Amazing...

445
00:32:58,534 --> 00:33:02,136
that a planet on the other side of
the universe can remind you of Vermont.

446
00:33:08,596 --> 00:33:10,492
Here we go,
the next set of addresses.

447
00:33:12,487 --> 00:33:13,660
Oh, God...

448
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,580
What?

449
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,036
I recognize this one.

450
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,696
- One we've been to before?
- Not recently.

451
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:22,499
That's not good.

452
00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:24,880
It's the one
with the downed alien ship.

453
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,686
The planet Rush was stranded on.

454
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:32,310
We've been heading the wrong way.

455
00:33:39,294 --> 00:33:40,736
Okay, so what now?

456
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:43,536
Can we retrace our steps?

457
00:33:43,661 --> 00:33:44,661
Wait...

458
00:33:47,975 --> 00:33:49,568
We should go to this planet.

459
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,563
Why?

460
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,597
Look, even if we retrace our steps

461
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:55,280
and try this all again
with different choices,

462
00:33:55,915 --> 00:33:57,492
we're traveling blind.

463
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,159
Rush said he we was able to boot up
the computer on that alien ship.

464
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:03,332
Yeah, and that's
what brought the aliens.

465
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,169
But in the small time that he was there,
he was able to glean some information

466
00:34:07,294 --> 00:34:10,422
about the shape of this galaxy
and where the Stargates are.

467
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:14,421
If I can do the same,

468
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,808
we won't have to stumble around.

469
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:20,432
We'd have a map.

470
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,685
Okay, but what about the aliens?

471
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:25,911
Believe me, you do not want to end up
a prisoner on one of those ships.

472
00:34:26,036 --> 00:34:28,899
I realize we might
not have much time.

473
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,402
We'll have to get
in and out quickly.

474
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:33,282
If they're not there now.

475
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,590
I hope this is a good idea.

476
00:35:46,002 --> 00:35:47,348
All right, come on.

477
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:01,325
How about this?

478
00:36:16,598 --> 00:36:17,911
We're in the right place.

479
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:21,011
I didn't see any other Alien spaceships,
did you?

480
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,293
Clock is ticking.

481
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:23,776
I know, I know.

482
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,900
15 minutes.

483
00:36:36,084 --> 00:36:38,904
- Where'd you get that number?
- I like it.

484
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,354
This is an Alien spaceship.

485
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,660
Exactly. 15 minutes, that's it.
End of discussion.

486
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,047
Nice work, Lieutenant.

487
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:58,993
Thank you, sir.

488
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:00,661
Any word from Rush?

489
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:01,940
Not yet.

490
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:04,788
I'm glad you made it back.

491
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,885
They thought I was dead.

492
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,524
I don't think
they would have left me otherwise.

493
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,821
I hope that choice doesn't mean
we've lost them.

494
00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:30,715
None of this makes any sense.

495
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:35,711
- Okay, time's up, we need to walk away.
- Not yet.

496
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,753
Wait.

497
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,525
- You said none of this makes sense...
- I know. I know.

498
00:37:40,976 --> 00:37:41,983
Go back.

499
00:37:43,824 --> 00:37:46,388
- What do you mean?
- The screens, go back.

500
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:53,520
There! Select that.

501
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,071
There it is.

502
00:38:03,379 --> 00:38:04,865
How did you know that?

503
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,108
I don't know.

504
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,130
Can you read this?

505
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,953
No, I just...

506
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:11,603
Know what it means?

507
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:14,781
Can you use this
to get us back to <i>Destiny</i> or not?

508
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:21,191
I think so.

509
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:25,677
- We have to hurry, though.
- Why?

510
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:30,562
If I'm reading this right,
<i>Destiny</i> is about to leave the galaxy.

511
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:32,673
If we don't get back on board
before it does,

512
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:35,238
we're going to be stranded for good.

513
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:36,383
Game over.

514
00:38:45,664 --> 00:38:46,977
Five minutes.

515
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:58,210
Seriously, there was no quicker way?

516
00:39:00,498 --> 00:39:02,965
If I'm right,
this planet should be just...

517
00:39:03,331 --> 00:39:05,050
There it is!
<i>Destiny</i>!

518
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:06,218
Dial!

519
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,143
Down to the wire.

520
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:17,430
Incoming wormhole.

521
00:39:42,028 --> 00:39:43,175
You cut it close.

522
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,049
And the others were not with him.

523
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,472
What happened?

524
00:39:52,648 --> 00:39:55,299
I don't know.
It didn't connect.

525
00:39:55,424 --> 00:39:56,810
- Why not?
- I don't know!

526
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,771
So where are they?

527
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:00,717
Again.

528
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,141
- What happened?
- I said I don't...

529
00:40:40,696 --> 00:40:41,696
What?

530
00:40:42,117 --> 00:40:43,398
The address disappeared.

531
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,984
How can it be there one second
and gone the next?

532
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,613
They jumped.

533
00:40:52,378 --> 00:40:53,492
We missed it.

534
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:56,870
We must have just...

535
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:58,914
missed it.

536
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:08,270
That's it.

537
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,344
We're done.

538
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:28,402
I'm trying to carry on for Eli.
Don't you think he'd want me to?

539
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,107
I think it's important.

540
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:33,031
I know you've been through a lot.

541
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:34,890
I only need a minute or two.

542
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:37,672
What happened on the planet?

543
00:41:39,248 --> 00:41:41,714
People are going to want
to hear your story.

544
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:48,299
Maybe another time.
