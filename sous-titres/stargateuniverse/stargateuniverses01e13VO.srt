1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:03,127
This is what Destiny intended
from the moment it entered the system.

2
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:08,758
We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:11,931
The ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,470
Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:18,726
He and Young are bumping heads.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,576
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

7
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:23,337
We pretend nothing happened...

8
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:25,769
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,300
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:29,904
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,990
- Do not let him take over any system.
- He's doing it anyway.

12
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:36,702
We've sealed off Colonel Young
and most of the military personnel.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,080
- We've taken the ship.
- You've got our attention.

14
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,332
- <i>What do you want?</i>
- All military personnel

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,926
to hand over their weapons.

16
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:44,960
I'm just a little surprised

17
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,420
you're taking Rush's side.

18
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,388
Rush was an inconvenience,

19
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:51,050
so Colonel Young left him
on that planet to die.

20
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,052
He has a transmitter
implanted in his chest.

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,804
That's how they were following us.

22
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,722
Even if we survive to the next jump,

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,156
they'll track us again.

24
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:00,226
We need to find a way
to work together.

25
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,852
Pretend it never happened?

26
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,437
You shouldn't have left him.

27
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,183
You think I don't know that?

28
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:09,860
Projet-SG (1.00)
www.projet-sg.com

29
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,291
Should you be out of bed?

30
00:01:55,912 --> 00:01:57,491
There's too much work to be done.

31
00:01:58,097 --> 00:01:59,847
We'd best get on with it.

32
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:02,121
"We?"

33
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,047
Ready.

34
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:15,092
All right,
go ahead and re-pressurize.

35
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,560
Re-pressurizing.

36
00:02:21,873 --> 00:02:23,309
<i>It's holding steady.</i>

37
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:33,978
- <i>And we've got atmosphere.</i>
- <i>Very good.</i>

38
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:37,490
<i>Continue with the repairs.
Begin with navigation and propulsion.</i>

39
00:02:38,394 --> 00:02:39,492
<i>Roger that.</i>

40
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,703
What the hell are you doing?

41
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:46,827
Repairing the damaged shuttle,
if that's all right.

42
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,668
- You just had surgery.
- I'm fine, thank you.

43
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,356
You look like you're ready
to drop dead.

44
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,081
And that would be a bad thing?

45
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:57,176
That would be a bad thing.

46
00:02:58,297 --> 00:03:00,763
The civilians aboard this ship
didn't try to take over

47
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,599
because I was doing a bang-up job,
I get that.

48
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,767
Good for you.

49
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:06,066
I also get

50
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,181
that I have to make this work.

51
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:11,073
So I've ordered my people
to make a special effort.

52
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:14,308
I would like to do the same,
even with you.

53
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,305
That must have taken
quite the effort.

54
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:20,997
You have no idea.

55
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:31,070
Scott, we just dropped out of FTL.
Please have a team ready on standby.

56
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,950
- But the gate isn't dialing.
- Why not?

57
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,380
Because there's nothing there.

58
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:39,301
What?

59
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:42,686
It appears we have dropped out of FTL
into empty space.

60
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:44,811
No planets, no stars, nothing.

61
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,476
<i>You might want to
re-check that data.</i>

62
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:59,530
The ships that are seeding the gates
ahead of Destiny,

63
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,508
I thought they send a record
of the star systems in our path.

64
00:04:03,218 --> 00:04:04,218
They do.

65
00:04:05,657 --> 00:04:06,757
That star...

66
00:04:07,736 --> 00:04:09,624
is not supposed to be here.

67
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:16,250
All right, sit tight, guys.
Gate's not dialing.

68
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,006
They think it might be
some kind of a glitch in the database.

69
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:22,727
And here I was worried
I'd have to cut short my delicious meal.

70
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:25,558
You okay?

71
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,445
Look like you might be
coming down with something.

72
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:30,489
I'm fine.

73
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:33,674
Just tired.

74
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:41,732
We call that...

75
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:43,892
Cold.

76
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,577
It's gonna take a little time.

77
00:04:47,897 --> 00:04:51,290
"A special effort on our part
towards a spirit of

78
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:53,817
"cooperation."

79
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:57,198
The Colonel's right about that.
We have to live with these people.

80
00:04:57,323 --> 00:04:58,740
Doesn't mean I got to like it.

81
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,300
You do.
At least, you have to look like.

82
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,635
Good luck with that.

83
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:07,929
Am I wrong?

84
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:10,392
Does she look like she's
coming down with something?

85
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:11,977
It's a G-2 star.

86
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:13,635
Yellow dwarf,

87
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,756
similar to our own sun.

88
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,840
Because Destiny
didn't know it was here,

89
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,655
the star's gravity well
disrupted our propulsion systems,

90
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:27,327
causing us to drop
out of FTL prematurely.

91
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:30,454
It's a glitch in the technology.

92
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:32,623
So what happens now?

93
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:35,165
We've entered a parabolic course.

94
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,212
Once we're 'round the star,
we'll be far enough away

95
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,632
from its gravitational influence,
back into FTL,

96
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,217
and on our way.

97
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:45,871
How long's that going to take?

98
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,183
A few weeks.

99
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:51,517
There is, however, a silver lining.

100
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,607
A planet?

101
00:05:54,732 --> 00:05:56,897
Only one in the solar system,
so far as I can see.

102
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:00,427
About the same size as Earth.

103
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:03,319
Looks close.

104
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,594
It is.

105
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:08,158
Within shuttle range.

106
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:09,576
Atmosphere?

107
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:11,771
In a word?

108
00:06:12,609 --> 00:06:13,609
Perfect.

109
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:26,947
I've been over the database
a dozen times.

110
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:32,182
No evidence of any glitch
or anomaly.

111
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,043
I couldn't find anything either.

112
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:40,107
It's like this star
just appeared out of nowhere.

113
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:43,902
Vigorous surface activity,
strong stellar winds,

114
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,099
bipolar outflow.

115
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:47,523
It's brand-new.
It's straight out of T-Tauri phase.

116
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:49,408
Which would still make it like,

117
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:51,660
a hundred million years old?

118
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:53,704
It's 200 million.

119
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:58,153
How far ahead of us
are those gate-seeding ships?

120
00:06:58,278 --> 00:07:02,296
It doesn't make any sense.
The ships would have noticed it.

121
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:05,299
And dropped a shiny
new Stargate on the planet.

122
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,338
That's the weirder thing about this.

123
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:09,845
If this star really is this young,

124
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:13,474
then that planet should still be
a ball of molten rock.

125
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:29,698
We're through the upper atmosphere.

126
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,617
Everything looks good.

127
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:35,175
I'm going to set her down
on that land mass directly below us.

128
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,133
No sign of any wildlife.

129
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:49,917
That we can see.

130
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,132
It's pure.

131
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:11,004
- How you feeling?
- Great.

132
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:12,608
A little sunshine,

133
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:15,138
fresh air, water,
just what I needed.

134
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,526
Check this out!

135
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:20,958
There's a whole grove of trees
back there

136
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:23,379
loaded with these things.

137
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:28,841
It's like a kiwi.

138
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,926
- We'll do an edibility test...
- I'll do it.

139
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,790
What the hell are you doing?

140
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:39,434
- That's nice.
- We don't even know if it's poisonous.

141
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:41,538
We will.

142
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,344
<i>We're getting
a ton of plant samples.</i>

143
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:48,028
<i>TJ thinks there's all sorts
of medicinal possibilities.</i>

144
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,528
That's great.

145
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,461
We also found some fruit.

146
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:54,209
Greer went ahead and ate one.

147
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,994
So far he hasn't had
any reactions to it.

148
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:59,705
- How about water?
- <i>Tons of it. Pure, too.</i>

149
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,818
<i>We'll bring back
as much of it as we can.</i>

150
00:09:01,943 --> 00:09:04,793
No alien creatures
slithering around?

151
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,099
No, nothing.

152
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:08,118
It's weird,

153
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,133
but it's daytime,
so who knows what comes out at night.

154
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:13,550
Load up the shuttle,
and head on back.

155
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:15,983
Do a fly-over of the area
on your way.

156
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:18,140
<i>Copy that. Scott out.</i>

157
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:22,755
There you are.

158
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:24,907
This place.

159
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:27,274
It reminds me of home.

160
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:31,001
We used to go camping,

161
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:32,797
Olympic Peninsula.

162
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:37,201
My dad and I, we'd go hiking

163
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,446
for days at a time,

164
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:40,829
find these amazing

165
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,257
vistas and canyons,

166
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:46,153
waterfalls...

167
00:09:50,352 --> 00:09:51,602
Time to go, TJ.

168
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,990
Damn near perfect.

169
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:18,033
It doesn't makes any sense,
the ship not knowing about this place.

170
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,369
Of all the planets
to put a Stargate on,

171
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,826
I would think that...

172
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,440
Looks like
we weren't the first ones here.

173
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:49,439
It's massive.
2,000 feet high, at least.

174
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:52,896
We detected a faint em field around it,
but nothing else.

175
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:54,271
Those markings.

176
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,924
Like some kind of alien language.

177
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:00,126
Do you think it's the same ones
we keep running into?

178
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:02,703
Not with this level of technology.

179
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,371
What, to build this thing?

180
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:07,708
To create a planet.

181
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:11,596
They actually built this planet?

182
00:11:13,302 --> 00:11:14,715
The Genesis Device.

183
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:19,553
<i>The end of wrath of khan.</i>

184
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:23,199
The reason why Destiny
had no knowledge of this star system

185
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,476
is that it was placed there
after the gate-seeding ships had passed.

186
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,438
You're telling me
they built the star too?

187
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,690
That would make them

188
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,184
the number one all-time
advanced civilization.

189
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:35,736
That would be an understatement.

190
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,863
So, what do we do about this?

191
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,948
We send a team back down there.

192
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,116
What?

193
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:43,785
Look, our orbit has been refined.

194
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,038
It's going to be four weeks,
two days, seven hours

195
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,789
before we jump back to FTL.

196
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,787
I'm proposing
we take advantage of the wait.

197
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:52,169
You said we were almost
out of shuttle range.

198
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,357
We are, but...

199
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:58,045
We're going to swing back into range

200
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,607
once we circle the star

201
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:01,636
and before we jump to FTL.

202
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,225
We send a team down now,

203
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,130
and we can pick them in a month,
loaded with supplies.

204
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:09,644
We time it right on the return,
we could take two, maybe three trips.

205
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:12,397
What about the aliens?

206
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,940
We didn't see them.

207
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:16,234
It doesn't mean
that they're not around.

208
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:19,654
Look, we have three hours left

209
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,881
before we're out of shuttle range.

210
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:24,659
If we're going to do this,
we have to do it quickly.

211
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,685
Just to say this out loud,

212
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,603
assuming that this star
and this planet

213
00:12:32,728 --> 00:12:35,712
were created
by the most incredibly advanced

214
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,148
aliens ever,

215
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,509
maybe they don't want anyone
messing around with it.

216
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,677
We need the food and medicine.

217
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:44,226
I agree.

218
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,140
- The gains outweigh the risks.
- Do they?

219
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:50,310
We're 0-for-3 on close encounters
of the third kind.

220
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,937
What makes you think

221
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,855
that these guys
are gonna be different?

222
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,548
I'm not sending anyone down there
without protection.

223
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:59,291
And we'll have the shuttle
in case we got to bug out.

224
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,365
Everything we do out here is a risk.

225
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:15,926
I heard you found some plants
with possible analgesic properties?

226
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,301
High concentration of salicin.

227
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,341
Similar to aspirin.
You got a headache?

228
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,260
Only since I've been on this ship.

229
00:13:28,453 --> 00:13:31,128
Take these, steep them in hot water,
and drink it.

230
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:35,832
So, you're joining the team
going down to the planet?

231
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,333
Yeah, all types of medicinals.

232
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,259
I can't pass it up.

233
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:42,988
- How about you?
- I don't know.

234
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:45,758
I mean, part of me wants to, but...

235
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:48,869
What if Rush's calculations are off?

236
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,725
Can we trust him?

237
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:54,436
You tell me.

238
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,487
I want 'round the clock watch
on camps.

239
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:02,585
Guard details on every science team
going into the woods.

240
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,111
Hopefully we'll be able to fix
the damaged shuttle before you return,

241
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:08,027
and double up on supplies
we can bring back.

242
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:11,183
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

243
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:14,676
You're coming too?

244
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:16,438
Is there a problem with that?

245
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:19,407
Happy camping.

246
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:25,974
You all set?

247
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,910
Cole will be looking after Franklin
in the infirmary while I'm away.

248
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,218
I told her to contact me
if there's any change in his condition.

249
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,334
Anything else?

250
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:53,518
<i>We're clear.</i>

251
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:56,566
We'll see you in a month.

252
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,483
All right, folks, you got
the whole month to enjoy the scenery.

253
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:55,620
We need to set up camp,
establish a perimeter.

254
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,404
Sun moves that way.

255
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:58,672
Guys?

256
00:15:58,797 --> 00:15:59,892
Over here?

257
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:02,846
Sun moves that way,
so that's west, okay?

258
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:05,145
River's back that way
about half a klick...

259
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,464
kilometer.

260
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,757
We'll sleep in the shuttle for now,

261
00:16:08,882 --> 00:16:10,999
but I want shelters built ASAP.

262
00:16:11,124 --> 00:16:13,597
How many of you guys
have gone camping before?

263
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:19,079
Well, okay, that's fine.
Just watch, ask, and learn.

264
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:21,605
You guys know your team assignments.
Let's get going.

265
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:30,614
I don't have a team yet.

266
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,040
Oh, yeah, right, sorry.

267
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:34,326
Do you feel like
helping TJ with plants?

268
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:36,685
Sure.

269
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:45,721
- What's going on over here?
- I'm not digging the latrine.

270
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:50,717
Is that what you told him to do?

271
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:52,457
Somebody's got to do it.

272
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:57,282
True enough.

273
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,102
Start digging.

274
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,029
What?

275
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:01,478
No, you can't make me.

276
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,512
You too.

277
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,609
- But sergeant, I...
- You're going to dig, okay?

278
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:07,897
You're both going to dig,
and you're gonna love every moment,

279
00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:10,694
or you will keep digging
until you do.

280
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:14,532
The spirit of co-operation.

281
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,274
We're all friends now.

282
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,078
So we'll photograph and log
every plant we find.

283
00:17:26,203 --> 00:17:29,456
Don't ingest anything
until we do a proper edibility test.

284
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:32,461
You all right?

285
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,630
Yeah, just...

286
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:40,968
It's passing.
I'm fine.

287
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:49,668
The amount of food and water
we get on that ship,

288
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:52,957
it's a wonder we're not all fainting
from malnutrition.

289
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,408
Well, I just got the word.

290
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,866
Destiny is now officially
out of range.

291
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,631
No turning back.

292
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,608
We are stuck here.

293
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:31,093
How's it going?

294
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,708
Well, I hope they bring
back tons of food.

295
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,835
The last of that fruit
that they brought back is already gone.

296
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,143
Or so you think.

297
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,157
Snuck this earlier.

298
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:52,897
I'll split it with you

299
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,924
if you promise not to rat me out.

300
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,267
Deal.

301
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:01,571
So, tell me...

302
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:03,209
Thanks.

303
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:07,437
You think it's possible
to create a star?

304
00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:09,731
No way.

305
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:13,908
Now, being transported to a ship
on the other side of the universe

306
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,153
by a wormhole,

307
00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:17,205
that's totally doable.

308
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,164
That star just appeared
out of nowhere,

309
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,449
and the planet's age doesn't match.

310
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,201
If some all-powerful alien beings
didn't create it,

311
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,333
who did?

312
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,688
I'm sorry.
I'll go somewhere else.

313
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:53,066
No, that's okay.

314
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:56,945
I wanted to thank you.

315
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,138
I know all the military personnel

316
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,699
are trying to mend fences,

317
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,843
but you're one of the few
who actually seems to mean it.

318
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:06,929
We've got to work it out, right?

319
00:20:07,517 --> 00:20:10,851
It's interesting that we've now been
given the time down here to do that.

320
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,082
We were pretty lucky
to find this place.

321
00:20:14,895 --> 00:20:17,590
My mom used to say
there's no such thing as luck.

322
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:20,051
Only the hand of god,

323
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,345
giving you a little help
when you need it most.

324
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:27,086
Somewhere along the line, I mean,
I stopped believing all that,

325
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,006
but now...

326
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,103
I look at this place,

327
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:34,736
put right in our path

328
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:37,028
for us to find.

329
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:40,379
Tell me that isn't a miracle.

330
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:45,002
How's it going?

331
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:46,550
- Terrible.
- Great.

332
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:48,300
Which is it?

333
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,520
Propulsion's almost completely shot.

334
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:52,766
Might be able
to fly down to the planet,

335
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:54,987
but it won't
have enough power to get back up.

336
00:20:55,112 --> 00:20:56,255
So there's that.

337
00:20:56,894 --> 00:20:58,715
We're making some progress
on navigation.

338
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,434
We can turn left,
but not right, or up, or down.

339
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:04,756
Why did you say "great"?

340
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:07,495
We can turn left.

341
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:12,854
Go ahead.

342
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,052
While Destiny's engines
are off-line,

343
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:17,442
I'd like to use the extra power
to strengthen the shield,

344
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,245
maybe explore
some damaged areas in the ship,

345
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,080
possibly make some repairs.

346
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:23,805
<i>Reclaim some real estate.</i>

347
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:26,409
Exactly.

348
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:30,698
You go ahead. I'll have
Lieutenant James put a team together.

349
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:32,753
You two, you keep at it.

350
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:35,851
You have a month to get this thing
to fly to and from that planet

351
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:37,937
and do more than make a left turn.

352
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,234
- Fate brought us here?
- I don't know, maybe.

353
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:46,888
Maybe that's
what brought us to Icarus

354
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,406
and then Destiny.

355
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:52,032
You don't believe that?

356
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,846
You miss your flight, the plane crashes.
You weren't spared for a reason.

357
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,483
God doesn't have a master plan for you.
Things just happen.

358
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:03,968
So we're born, we live, we die?
It's all random?

359
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,158
And along the way, you do the best with
whatever crap you happen to step in.

360
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:16,114
I'm starting to get a bad feeling.

361
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:19,124
Me too.

362
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:23,003
I'm afraid we made a mistake

363
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,301
sending those people
down to that planet.

364
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,176
The mistake was not going with them.

365
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:29,485
You okay?

366
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:31,656
Here...

367
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,060
Gosh...

368
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,266
I thought you were feeling better.

369
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:39,679
I am.

370
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:43,234
Let me help you back to camp.
You should lie down.

371
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,276
I'm not sick.

372
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,030
How far along?

373
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:01,619
About 15 weeks.

374
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:03,413
Right before we left Icarus,

375
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,337
but nobody knows,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

376
00:25:06,968 --> 00:25:09,066
- Eventually they're going to...
- I know.

377
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:13,297
I know, but not now.
I'll figure out when the right time is.

378
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:17,797
Sure.

379
00:25:17,922 --> 00:25:20,129
Back on the ship,
I wasn't doing well,

380
00:25:21,202 --> 00:25:25,063
getting anemic, but out here,
with all the food and water...

381
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:28,066
Actually, the morning sickness
is a good sign.

382
00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:32,658
What about the father?

383
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:39,203
What the hell is it?

384
00:25:39,502 --> 00:25:40,751
I don't know yet.

385
00:25:41,232 --> 00:25:42,665
Looks like a robot.

386
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,543
Figure it out.

387
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,589
No problem, once I've attended
to the other hundred things on my list.

388
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:50,965
Put somebody else on it.

389
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,933
I'm not going to have anyone
touch this thing without me present.

390
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:56,750
I'm going to get to it, Colonel.

391
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,182
Close it up.

392
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:08,355
You okay?

393
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:12,032
Homesick for Destiny?

394
00:26:12,414 --> 00:26:14,238
Only a few more days
till we head back.

395
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,541
Honestly?

396
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,954
I'm not.

397
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,030
I like it here.

398
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:31,159
I'm starting to wonder
if Dr. Caine is right.

399
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:35,515
That it's no accident
we found this planet.

400
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:37,791
We were brought here by god?

401
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:39,119
Or whoever.

402
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:41,040
I don't know.

403
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:44,268
If some alien beings

404
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,607
are powerful enough
to create this place...

405
00:26:49,293 --> 00:26:52,690
Maybe there is some kind
of higher power in the universe

406
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:56,491
that knew we were in trouble,
put this planet here for us to find.

407
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,747
Maybe it's time we
stop thinking about...

408
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:03,948
What's that?

409
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,979
- When?
- <i>Tonight, just now.</i>

410
00:27:22,104 --> 00:27:24,976
<i>Coming from the obelisk,
shooting straight up into the sky.</i>

411
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:28,398
Dr. Volker detected
some kind of a...

412
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:31,529
A strange radiation.
He's working on it.

413
00:27:32,414 --> 00:27:34,986
It's like this whole thing
suddenly came to life.

414
00:27:36,105 --> 00:27:38,418
Why now?
Why not when they first got there?

415
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:40,366
Perhaps their initial impact

416
00:27:40,854 --> 00:27:42,793
wasn't enough to trigger an alert.

417
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:44,361
But now...

418
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,056
So this light,

419
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:48,668
you think it'll bring
the aliens back to the planet?

420
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:50,376
<i>You won't be there to find out.</i>

421
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,005
Destiny is almost in range.

422
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,465
Colonel Young wants us
to start breaking up camp,

423
00:27:57,214 --> 00:27:58,418
get ready to head back.

424
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:01,915
- What about the obelisk? I need time...
- We don't have enough time.

425
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:05,266
We need to be ready to fly
as soon as Destiny is in range

426
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:06,950
so we can make a couple trips,

427
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,796
and get all that food
back to the ship.

428
00:28:12,176 --> 00:28:13,899
All right, you heard the man.

429
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,367
Move your asses!

430
00:28:16,018 --> 00:28:17,111
Let's go.

431
00:28:28,077 --> 00:28:29,671
Again with this?

432
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,335
The shuttle can fly.

433
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,919
It can now go both left and right
and up and down.

434
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,988
But like I said before,
too many problems with propulsion.

435
00:28:38,564 --> 00:28:40,956
Fact is, we may never be able
to fully repair it.

436
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,431
All kinds of Citrus-type fruits,
beans, potatoes...

437
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:46,976
Sweet potatoes.

438
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:49,101
Scott says they're amazing.

439
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:52,166
They cannot get back here
fast enough.

440
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:54,857
You seem concerned, Dr. Rush.

441
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,641
Something we should know about?

442
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:01,947
No problems with your calculations?

443
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:04,443
The shuttle will return
as scheduled?

444
00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:08,579
And Destiny will leave this system

445
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,082
never knowing who created it...

446
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,709
Or why.

447
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,836
You might want
to give her some time.

448
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:46,425
We're breaking camp,
and she takes off without telling me?

449
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,994
She's thinking about staying here.
A lot of people are.

450
00:29:50,112 --> 00:29:51,998
Come on, you can't be surprised.

451
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:54,792
You've heard people.
They like it here.

452
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,628
I like it here too,
but we cannot stay.

453
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,755
- It is out of the question.
- Why not?

454
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,174
If people want to stay,
they have the right...

455
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:04,135
Where have you been?
We've got to move.

456
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,878
I'm not going.

457
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,059
I understand how you feel.
I like it here too,

458
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:13,795
but we cannot stay.

459
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,771
- The Colonel gave us orders...
- Matt, don't!

460
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,923
- I can't go back there.
- Why not?

461
00:30:18,355 --> 00:30:20,255
- It's safer here.
- Safer?

462
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:23,029
The aliens who built this rock
may be on their way back!

463
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:23,863
Good.

464
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:26,157
If they're advanced enough

465
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,299
to build a solar system,

466
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:31,203
I know they can help
us get back home.

467
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,362
Not if they don't wipe us out first.

468
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,667
Why do you immediately think
they're going to harm us?

469
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,553
I'm sorry, do you not remember
what the last aliens did to you?

470
00:30:39,678 --> 00:30:41,680
This planet was created for us.

471
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:44,683
We were led here for a reason.

472
00:30:45,832 --> 00:30:47,303
For God's sake...

473
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,638
What if they don't come back?
Then what?

474
00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:52,068
I'm okay with that.

475
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:55,436
I'm healthier here.
There's food and plenty of water.

476
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,563
And we're bringing a ton of it back!

477
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,731
And eventually, it'll run out.

478
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:01,658
What about the winters?

479
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:05,230
Dr. Volker, you said you found evidence
it gets very cold here.

480
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:07,907
Yes, well below freezing,

481
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,675
- for months, TJ.
- So we'll build better shelters.

482
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,578
I don't even think
it will come to that.

483
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,164
The beings who created
this world will return.

484
00:31:15,695 --> 00:31:18,204
And they will help us get back home.
I know it.

485
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:21,378
You would rather take your chances
out here than on Destiny?

486
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,246
We don't know where that ship is going,
or if we'll ever even make it home.

487
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:25,883
There's a Stargate on it.

488
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,510
As long as we have...

489
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:28,678
Matt...

490
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,270
I'm pregnant.

491
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:39,127
I can't go back there.

492
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:44,684
I can't stand the thought
of raising a child on that ship.

493
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:55,093
We are in range. You are clear
to make the first trip back.

494
00:31:55,218 --> 00:31:57,965
We only have the one shuttle,
so time is of the essence.

495
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,181
<i>Sir...</i>

496
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:02,753
- <i>We have a problem down here.
</i>- What is it?

497
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:07,550
Some of the people have decided
they would like to stay on the planet.

498
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:08,834
You tell them no.

499
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,636
<i>I tried</i>.

500
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,282
They have pretty much
made up their minds.

501
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:14,557
<i>Who are they?</i>

502
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,320
11 people total.

503
00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:20,202
Dr. Caine,

504
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,290
Chloe,

505
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:26,110
- Lieutenant Johansen...
- What?

506
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,125
<i>No! Scott, you tell them...</i>

507
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,250
And me.

508
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:38,135
- 11?
- Including some of my own people.

509
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,653
And Scott, he has the nerve

510
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:41,737
to ask me
to fly him back down to the planet

511
00:32:41,862 --> 00:32:43,848
after he drops off
the ones returning to the ship.

512
00:32:43,973 --> 00:32:45,129
I can understand

513
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,172
some of them wanting to stay,

514
00:32:47,603 --> 00:32:48,951
but Lieutenant Scott and TJ?

515
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:50,748
Yeah, he says he feels an obligation

516
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:53,323
to help the people
survive down there.

517
00:32:54,376 --> 00:32:56,473
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to make sure

518
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,955
they don't stay down there.

519
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,477
You cannot force them to come back.

520
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:02,021
I think he can.

521
00:33:03,185 --> 00:33:06,233
We're going to lose more people
through attrition aboard this ship.

522
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,069
We simply cannot afford
to shed that many people at one time.

523
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,428
What do you expect him to do?
Bring them back at gunpoint?

524
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:13,365
Well, if it comes to that, yes.

525
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,938
You allow Lieutenant Scott

526
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,866
to return with those
who want to come back to Destiny,

527
00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:22,549
then send down a military
detail and round up the rest.

528
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,183
That's great, Rush, coming from you.
First you want to kick the military out,

529
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:28,850
and now you want us
rounding people up at gunpoint.

530
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:34,928
Those people have the right

531
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,182
to make their own decisions
about their future.

532
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:42,638
Not all of them.

533
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:46,843
Did you...

534
00:33:48,912 --> 00:33:50,662
Dd you tell him about me?

535
00:33:51,845 --> 00:33:54,395
I'll let you do that.
It's not my place.

536
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:01,399
He is the father, right?

537
00:34:05,322 --> 00:34:07,378
I caught a few looks between you.

538
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:10,422
I don't think anyone else knew.

539
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,675
I haven't heard any rumors
or anything.

540
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:24,186
You are going to be okay.

541
00:34:28,313 --> 00:34:29,463
I'll be here,

542
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:32,796
and I'm not going
to let anything happen to you.

543
00:34:45,555 --> 00:34:48,292
- Have you gone mad?
- I really don't want to argue with you.

544
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:50,040
- You're letting them stay?
- Not all.

545
00:34:50,165 --> 00:34:52,041
- You're giving them a shuttle?
- It's damaged.

546
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,383
It's not damaged anymore!

547
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,637
You said that the shuttle
may never be fully functional.

548
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:58,679
- We may need the shuttle...
- I'm not going to leave them down...

549
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,222
You cannot let them stay...

550
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,932
I have made my decision.

551
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:04,524
Is it ready?

552
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,501
Yeah, but there's still some issues

553
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:09,755
as to whether it can hold up
through atmospheric entry.

554
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,430
Questions that are about
to be answered.

555
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:23,987
Eli just radioed.

556
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:26,498
Colonel Young is on his way
down here.

557
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:27,958
Why?

558
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,126
How?

559
00:35:37,517 --> 00:35:39,617
We're entering upper atmosphere.

560
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,482
<i>So far so good.</i>

561
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:57,279
Come on, hold it together.

562
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,350
Yeah, right there!

563
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,860
<i>Destiny, this is Young.
I made it through.</i>

564
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,772
Has anyone changed their minds
about returning to the ship?

565
00:36:40,755 --> 00:36:41,976
Here's the deal.

566
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:45,294
I am leaving
the damaged shuttle behind

567
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:47,954
for those who want to stay.

568
00:36:49,394 --> 00:36:51,959
You can use it
for shelter and power,

569
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,616
fly around in short hops
on the surface.

570
00:36:54,741 --> 00:36:58,491
You will not be able to leave
the atmosphere, so don't even try.

571
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:02,719
What it will do
is give you guys a fighting chance

572
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,326
while you are down here,
especially with winter on the way.

573
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:07,894
Thank you.
I know this isn't...

574
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:09,369
I'm not finished.

575
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,518
I will leave it for you
only under one condition.

576
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,234
All military personnel
will return with me to Destiny.

577
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:23,699
Reject my proposal,
and we'll take you all back by force.

578
00:37:24,131 --> 00:37:27,425
- You can't do that.
- That's not something you want to test.

579
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,166
Sir, some of these people
just don't feel safe on board.

580
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,891
None of us feels safe.

581
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:34,370
- That doesn't mean we give up.
- They're not.

582
00:37:34,495 --> 00:37:37,880
That ship is the best chance we have
of getting home.

583
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,348
I disagree, sir.

584
00:37:40,865 --> 00:37:43,051
I believe we were brought here
for a reason,

585
00:37:43,718 --> 00:37:47,598
and that whoever created this planet
will provide for us.

586
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,789
They are our best chance
of getting back home.

587
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:04,848
What's it going to be?

588
00:38:24,996 --> 00:38:27,857
You want to stay here
out of obligation to these people.

589
00:38:27,982 --> 00:38:29,056
To protect them.

590
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,060
I can respect that,
but there are people back on the ship

591
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,644
who don't have a choice,

592
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,109
and you have an obligation
to them as well.

593
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:41,735
They need you.

594
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:30,963
Welcome home.

595
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,710
As predicted,

596
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:11,426
we've corrected our course

597
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:12,889
and jumped back into FTL.

598
00:40:13,964 --> 00:40:15,746
I'm sorry you didn't get your wish.

599
00:40:17,556 --> 00:40:18,832
And what wish was that?

600
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,629
Aliens advanced enough
that they could build a star system.

601
00:40:23,207 --> 00:40:26,426
Finally somebody you could
have a decent conversation with.

602
00:40:32,704 --> 00:40:33,904
I enjoy chess.

603
00:40:46,706 --> 00:40:48,487
- Do you have a moment?
- Can it wait?

604
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,163
I wanted to better explain my reasons
for choosing to stay behind.

605
00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:55,663
Look, I realize you're probably
not hungry, Lieutenant, but I am.

606
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:57,635
I hear they're serving up
a feast in the mess,

607
00:40:58,046 --> 00:40:59,613
so why don't we talk about it later?

608
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:01,138
- Sir...
- Later.

609
00:41:02,788 --> 00:41:04,791
What if we were meant to stay there?

610
00:41:05,372 --> 00:41:06,372
All of us?

611
00:41:07,997 --> 00:41:10,974
What if that planet was a lifeline,

612
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:14,009
and we just let it go?

613
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:19,879
I can't pretend to answer that,
Matthew.

614
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:21,675
No one can.
