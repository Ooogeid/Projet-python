1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,294
This is what <i>Destiny</i> intended
from the moment it entered the system.

2
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:08,924
We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,206
The ship came here for a reason.

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,587
<i>Destiny</i> is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:19,435
He and Young are bumping heads.

6
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,859
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,519
We pretend nothing happened.

8
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:25,979
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:27,735
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:30,071
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,691
The convulsions have stopped,
but he's unresponsive.

12
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:35,742
He's in a deep catatonic state.

13
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,611
<i>This is Scott, Sir.
We are in a bit of a pickle down here.</i>

14
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:43,345
We haven't found any other sort of exit
or access to ground level.

15
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,164
We've got less than half an hour.
We're not going to make it.

16
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:48,167
They just jumped.

17
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:50,042
God be with you, Colonel.

18
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:51,966
All of you.

19
00:01:17,372 --> 00:01:18,572
<i>Colonel Young?</i>

20
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:28,671
<i>We're all here.</i>

21
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:30,243
I'm on my way.

22
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:56,704
Dr. Rush has just confirmed

23
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:59,267
that our current FTL jump

24
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:02,329
will take us between galaxies.

25
00:02:03,426 --> 00:02:05,207
Which means it could take some time

26
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,835
before we are able to make
another Gate connection

27
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,087
to replenish our supplies.

28
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:15,217
Strict food and water rationing
will be reinstated as of now.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,638
It also means
that any hope of rescuing

30
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:22,141
Chloe Armstrong, Eli Wallace,

31
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,109
or Lt. Matthew Scott is...

32
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:36,864
<i>Colonel Young, would you please join me
in the control interface room?</i>

33
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:39,189
I'll be right there.

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,160
That is all.

35
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:02,515
I've figured out why the ship's been
trying to conserve power.

36
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,767
We're going to fall short.

37
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:06,936
Short of what?

38
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,562
Our destination.

39
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,191
No matter how I do the sums,
and how I try and conserve power,

40
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:15,207
<i>Destiny</i> won't make it
across the void.

41
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:31,043
Projet-SG (1.00)
www.projet-sg.com

42
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,842
We just passed through a star.
We should be recharged.

43
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,219
Yes, we did,
but like everything else on this ship,

44
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:44,161
<i>Destiny</i>'s FTL drive and power reserves
are nowhere near 100%.

45
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:47,852
The database says the ship barely made
the last intergalactic jumps.

46
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,915
Recent battle damage
couldn't have helped.

47
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,898
But if the ship realizes that it can't,
why is it trying?

48
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,593
It's programmed to follow
a predetermined path.

49
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,183
Since we haven't managed
to take control of the ship,

50
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:01,688
our presence is secondary to that.

51
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:04,113
<i>Destiny</i> will drift
the rest of the way,

52
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:06,488
but our bones will be dust by then.

53
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:09,674
What do we do?

54
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,959
I'm open to suggestions.

55
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:14,837
How much will we fall short?

56
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,427
50,000 light years, give or take.

57
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:19,008
A few percent of the total.

58
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,138
What if we can increase
the FTL drive's efficiency?

59
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:26,307
Work better
with the same amount of power.

60
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:28,748
Five percent would do it, actually.

61
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:30,519
We don't know how the engines work.

62
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,980
We could make things worse.

63
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,315
Mr. Brody's right.

64
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,765
Am I the only one here who thinks
we shouldn't screw around

65
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,745
with ancient drive technology
without a clue about what we're doing?

66
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,073
We'll bring someone that does.
I can think of two or three people.

67
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,701
- Who's the best?
- Amanda Perry.

68
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,079
She was part of the team

69
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,249
helping to design
the next generation of hyperdrives.

70
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,168
There's no one better qualified.

71
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,129
Let's make that happen.
Let's get her on board.

72
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,800
For all her abilities,

73
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:06,430
there are certain disabilities
of which you should be made aware.

74
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:08,045
For how long?

75
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,476
Potentially several weeks.

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,397
Of course, there'll be someone
to assist with the day to day things.

77
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:17,608
She requires a respirator

78
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,234
in order to breathe.

79
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:22,446
Obviously, there's going to be
some kind of adjustment.

80
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:24,740
Will I be able to see my family?

81
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:26,861
They've got clearance.

82
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,539
Then I'll do it, Sir.

83
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:49,056
Lieutenant? You all right?

84
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:51,012
Mandy...

85
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:06,156
God, I'm really here, aren't i?

86
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:08,883
You sure are.

87
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,063
It takes a moment
to get used to the transfer.

88
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:15,749
You're telling me.

89
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:24,520
I'm sorry, Sir. I couldn't do it.

90
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,052
Just leave her. Leave her.

91
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:37,354
So Lieutenant James had trouble
getting used to the ventilator.

92
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,025
I'll be fine.

93
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:46,266
Fix the ship.

94
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,479
Ms. Wray?

95
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,481
Take all the time you need
to adjust.

96
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:03,272
This is Mary.
She'll be your helper while you're here.

97
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:07,955
She'll also brief you on how to cope
with your host's disabilities.

98
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,679
Afterwards, Dr. Strom
was hoping to see you...

99
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:13,766
I'm going home.

100
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:25,778
I couldn't do it.

101
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:29,209
Yeah, I know. I heard.

102
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:31,865
It's okay.

103
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:34,315
No, it isn't.

104
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:36,724
I let him down.

105
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,320
The Colonel?

106
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,330
Listen, he's the last person that...

107
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:50,138
I recognize you.

108
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:55,256
As I was saying,
this is the mess hall,

109
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:57,684
one of the places
you probably want to try and avoid.

110
00:07:58,384 --> 00:07:59,394
What are those?

111
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:04,566
They're a kind of fruit we collected
from a planet we visited recently.

112
00:08:05,454 --> 00:08:07,027
May I try one?

113
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:10,548
I'll warn you,

114
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:13,193
most people find
these rather bitter.

115
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,168
Most people
spit them right back out.

116
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:28,048
This is the first food I've been able
to feed myself since I was nine.

117
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:32,085
<i>TJ, this is Young.
Have you seen Rush?</i>

118
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,228
<i>He turned his damn radio off.</i>

119
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,596
I think I've gotten you in trouble.

120
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:41,979
They're on their way now, Sir.

121
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,991
I took my vacation time.

122
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,660
All of it?

123
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:00,208
We have a lot of lost time
to make up for.

124
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,249
You got rid of the ugly chair.

125
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:17,216
You can do better than that.

126
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,235
Five or six percent would do it.

127
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,668
That's the thought.

128
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:32,821
The problem is

129
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,851
how to do that without any access
to the ship's core systems.

130
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:39,235
Or for that matter, any knowledge
of how they work in the first place.

131
00:09:40,652 --> 00:09:41,952
I'm just saying.

132
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:44,514
Show her everything you've got.

133
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,811
Nicholas?

134
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,023
It's me again.

135
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:11,122
We came out of FTL.

136
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,505
Something's happened to the ship.

137
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,694
I promise to get to everyone,

138
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:25,664
but I need anyone
who has a potential head injury

139
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:28,001
or internal trauma
to move to the front of the line.

140
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:29,667
Don't be shy.

141
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:33,761
Put us to work.

142
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:38,005
Anyone who's shaky,
don't take any chances.

143
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:40,555
- The quiet could be in the worst shape.
- What about you?

144
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:43,531
I'm fine. Go.

145
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:47,699
Are we under attack or not?

146
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,276
- It was a malfunction.
- No sign of any hostile ships in range.

147
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,790
Not that I can tell, anyway.

148
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:57,447
- What happened, then?
- An explosion in the FTL drive.

149
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,782
- We're adrift.
- Why?

150
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:02,209
- An overload?
- It could be anything.

151
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,247
- Can we access the engine?
- Not without a space suit.

152
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,499
Most of the ship's unpressurized.

153
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,459
Best to check the damage
from outside.

154
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,129
- I can fly a kino pretty well.
- Get to it.

155
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,714
You two monitor from here.

156
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:15,799
I'll use the stones to report this.

157
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,309
Mandy, are you sure
you're all right?

158
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,085
For a second there,

159
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:31,773
I was back on Earth in a strange house,
back in my own body again.

160
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,537
The link is temporarily severed
when we go in and out of FTL.

161
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:38,155
I'm sorry, we weren't expecting
that to happen.

162
00:11:39,218 --> 00:11:40,218
I'm fine.

163
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,162
- What do you remember?
- I was walking,

164
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,874
then I was somewhere else,
and I don't know how I got there.

165
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,897
Then the explosion happened.

166
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:52,627
So the lapse happened before?

167
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,977
Sometimes concussions can cause
short-term memory loss and confusion.

168
00:11:57,102 --> 00:12:00,093
We'll keep you here tonight,
make sure it's nothing more serious.

169
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:03,375
He was on the floor.
I couldn't tell if he was hurt or not.

170
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,223
Put him over here, guys.

171
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:17,027
Franklin?

172
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:23,432
<i>This is Volker.
Are you getting pictures?</i>

173
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:25,261
Yeah, we see it.

174
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,656
So is there anything
I need to worry about?

175
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:34,132
I've been with Amanda a long time.

176
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:35,837
We'll monitor her blood pressure,

177
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,964
and there's a few other things
I need to show you

178
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,510
that just come with the territory,
and she'll be fine.

179
00:12:42,558 --> 00:12:45,158
I'm sorry,
it's just I'm new to all this.

180
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:48,625
You'll be fine too.

181
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,741
- What's happening?
- Incoming wormhole.

182
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:07,619
<i>This is Rush.
We have an incoming wormhole.</i>

183
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,187
<i>Sgt. Greer, meet me in the Gate room
with a defense team.</i>

184
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:23,371
I need everybody out of here!

185
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:25,679
That won't be necessary, Sergeant.

186
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,729
Don't shoot!

187
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,189
- Stand down!
- Told you.

188
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,889
I didn't expect
to see you again either.

189
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:46,307
You weren't expecting to see us?

190
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:49,264
Didn't you guys figure out
a way for us to dial in?

191
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,805
I joined a book club.

192
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,265
It's supposed to be all women,

193
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,675
but there are a few enlightened
young men who stop by

194
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,635
and claim to have an interest
in 19th century chick-lit.

195
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,271
Can we concentrate
on eating right now?

196
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,439
Sorry.

197
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:20,150
You know what, why don't I do that?

198
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:22,255
We'll be fine.

199
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:25,305
One at a time.

200
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:26,945
Got it.

201
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:41,115
This isn't freaking you out, is it?

202
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:43,265
You're here.

203
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:45,133
That's all that matters.

204
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:49,675
Here.

205
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:53,517
We were pretty much resigned to the fact
that we were stuck out there.

206
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,602
Talk about feeling
like a third wheel.

207
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,355
On the second night,

208
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,890
the kino remote just lit up.

209
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:02,734
I guess I just thought you guys
must've figured something out.

210
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:04,565
We dialed back,

211
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,696
- and here we are.
- I didn't think

212
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,705
it was possible to miss this bucket.

213
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,952
Do you people realize
you just scared the crap out of us?

214
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,270
- Sorry, sir.
- You're forgiven.

215
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:17,082
- Are they going to live?
- Looks like it.

216
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,875
- It couldn't have been all that bad.
- That's good.

217
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:23,713
Because if we don't get the FTL drive
fixed, that's where we'll all be going.

218
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:25,382
- Really?
- Really, Eli.

219
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,176
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have
to put you right back to work.

220
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:29,885
Welcome back.

221
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:41,715
How's he doing?

222
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:44,425
Same,

223
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:47,610
but something changed
since we got stuck.

224
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:49,656
Doesn't he look different to you?

225
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:51,825
Maybe.

226
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,300
It's like he's in there,
and he knows exactly what's going on,

227
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:57,080
but his brain and his body
just aren't connected anymore.

228
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,275
I don't know.

229
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:00,985
I talked to Rush,

230
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,545
and he says I'm probably
just imagining it.

231
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:06,047
Maybe I am.

232
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:09,676
I mean, I haven't slept
in I don't even know...

233
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,763
- Why?
- I keep having the same bad dream.

234
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:16,933
I am stuck in a dark room,

235
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,015
but I'm not me,

236
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:20,885
and I can't get out.

237
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:22,731
Are you claustrophobic?

238
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:24,865
Little bit.

239
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:28,612
Maybe it's some weird phantom memory
from your switch with Dr. Perry.

240
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,125
Hey, math boy,

241
00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:37,037
Got those calculations
I was asking about?

242
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,565
Done.

243
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:44,753
Please don't call me that.

244
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:48,295
I know what that's like.

245
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:52,510
Nick called me "Little Miss Brilliant"
a couple of times, and it stuck.

246
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:56,495
Nicholas.

247
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,977
We were colleagues back at SGC

248
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,705
a couple of years before Icarus.

249
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:07,022
He used to like to bounce ideas off
of me when working on that ancient proof

250
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,610
that you ended up solving.

251
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,678
Congratulations, by the way.

252
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:14,991
Look where it got me.

253
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:16,993
I would do anything to be here.

254
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:19,496
Anyway,

255
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,310
after Nick's wife passed away,

256
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:25,065
we used to have these long talks

257
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,155
about his work and my work,

258
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:29,905
the Ancients,

259
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,132
ascension.

260
00:17:31,765 --> 00:17:33,468
It was like he didn't even see
the chair.

261
00:17:34,465 --> 00:17:36,780
I tried calling him "Mr. Brilliant"
a few times,

262
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:39,265
but I don't think
he ever got the hint.

263
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:41,435
You had a thing?

264
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,852
For him?

265
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:45,188
What's wrong with that?

266
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:48,864
I just find it kind of surprising.

267
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,110
Why, because a disabled person
can't have feelings for someone?

268
00:17:53,235 --> 00:17:55,485
Because you were talking about him.

269
00:17:58,325 --> 00:17:59,285
Thanks for this.

270
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:02,175
Sure...

271
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:16,030
You've got something?

272
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:19,306
Dr. Perry's concluded that the explosion
may be to our advantage.

273
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,140
How?

274
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,530
There was an overload. One that probably
shouldn't have happened

275
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,981
because the system is incredibly robust
with more safeguards than I can count,

276
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,858
but it happened,

277
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:31,651
and as with most overloads,

278
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,290
It happened in the weakest link.

279
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:35,736
The FTL drive is made up
of 16 separate modules.

280
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:38,290
The one that blew up
was the weakest link

281
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:41,560
- because it was the least efficient.
- The ship can fly on the other drives?

282
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:43,429
Even better than that.

283
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:45,248
Without the worn-out drive

284
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,916
bringing down overall efficiency,

285
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:50,170
<i>Destiny</i> should be able
to make it across the void.

286
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,463
That's great work.

287
00:18:52,035 --> 00:18:53,800
I wouldn't pat anyone
on the back just yet.

288
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,190
We still need to isolate
and bypass the damage.

289
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:58,756
With no access to the core systems,
It has to be done manually.

290
00:18:59,171 --> 00:18:59,971
Or...

291
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:01,385
Or what?

292
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,705
The robot we found.

293
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:06,250
We think it might be able
to do some,

294
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,115
or maybe all of the repairs.

295
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,983
I've already programmed rudimentary
instructions to begin the repairs.

296
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,390
Scott, this is Young. Eli and Dr. Perry
have a shuttle mission to brief you on.

297
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:19,515
<i>Copy that, sir, I'm on my way.</i>

298
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:23,965
What are the odds?

299
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:25,872
That this is going to work?

300
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:29,035
Fair to middling.
Time's an issue.

301
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:33,395
There is another option.

302
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:36,045
The Chair.

303
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,636
If we can gain access
to the core systems, we can bypass

304
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,716
that damaged section
in a single command.

305
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:43,973
Tell you what,
if it comes right down to it,

306
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,600
I'll sit in the thing myself.

307
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:09,955
<i>Getting into position now.</i>

308
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:24,889
<i>Opening rear hatch.</i>

309
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:29,355
<i>Okay, we're good.</i>

310
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,325
Here we go.

311
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:42,035
Come in.

312
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:47,745
I'd like permission to join the team

313
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,706
going through the Stargate
to the planet.

314
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,040
Scott's going.

315
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:54,375
He's a little busy
flying the shuttle right now.

316
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,129
He's already on his way back.

317
00:20:58,555 --> 00:21:00,341
So is this how it's going to be?

318
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:02,218
Maybe I'd like to see

319
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,145
where I might have
to raise our child.

320
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:06,785
If the ship isn't fixed by then.

321
00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:09,975
Maternal instincts, I guess.

322
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:15,481
Permission granted.

323
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:17,436
Thanks.

324
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,445
I'll be careful.

325
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,560
Lt. Scott found fresh water
due East of the Stargate.

326
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:26,910
It'll be your first stop.

327
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:29,390
We should check out
as much land as possible

328
00:21:29,515 --> 00:21:31,164
in case we end up
having to live there.

329
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:34,985
Send it.

330
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,718
You know, we just came from there.
This is a waste of time.

331
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:45,637
It's standard procedure.

332
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:49,349
If you ask me, sometimes
you military people are a little too...

333
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:51,535
Holy crap!

334
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:54,979
- Did you see that?
- I saw. Shut it down.

335
00:21:57,945 --> 00:22:00,045
Looks like they found your camp.

336
00:22:01,575 --> 00:22:03,821
- Can they get through the Stargate?
- Not without a remote.

337
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,930
Lucky we weren't still there,
or they'd have one.

338
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:07,492
Either way, we're cut off.

339
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,694
We have to fix the ship.

340
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:15,485
You know, I could just
go to the corner store.

341
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,149
We need a decent grocery shopping.

342
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:20,541
We're almost out of everything.

343
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:25,365
I shouldn't be long.
I'll be right back.

344
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,385
I could've gone.

345
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:34,472
I wanted her
to get out of the house.

346
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,141
Even if it's just for an hour.

347
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:48,425
That's it.

348
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:50,760
You've done it.
That isolates the drive.

349
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:53,240
That was the easy part.

350
00:24:53,365 --> 00:24:55,645
We'll start on the bypass
in the morning, okay?

351
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:58,866
You guys don't do much for fun
around here, do you?

352
00:25:01,825 --> 00:25:03,525
There is Mr. Brody's still.

353
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:04,961
You have a still?

354
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:06,565
Come and see.

355
00:25:08,204 --> 00:25:11,225
So I'm in a room, but I'm not me.

356
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:12,825
What do you see?

357
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,595
Nothing.
Blackness,

358
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,175
But I know that I am not alone.

359
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:19,675
What if it isn't a dream?

360
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,230
- Thank you, Mr. Brody.
- Cheers.

361
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,305
- Thanks.
- Now, be careful.

362
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:27,650
This stuff has only
one redeeming quality.

363
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:42,025
We make do with what we have, right?

364
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:45,945
Speaking of,

365
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,005
how are you managing
without your coffee?

366
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,175
I must admit,

367
00:25:53,105 --> 00:25:56,095
that's been one of the most difficult
things about being stuck up here.

368
00:25:56,915 --> 00:25:57,915
The hardships.

369
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:01,135
I think "insanity" is the proper word.
There and back again.

370
00:26:01,535 --> 00:26:03,269
I've even had dreams
about the stuff.

371
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,975
For years after my accident,
I had dreams that I could walk.

372
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:10,775
I remember you telling me that.

373
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:14,305
And then I get to do this,
and it's...

374
00:26:15,175 --> 00:26:16,625
It's all happening.

375
00:26:17,545 --> 00:26:19,695
God, it's like a dream come true.

376
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:25,565
- But we have to fix your ship.
- We do.

377
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:27,915
And then I'll have to wake up.

378
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:37,565
Sir?

379
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,307
I think...

380
00:26:44,195 --> 00:26:46,895
I think I was the one
who damaged the ship.

381
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:52,300
I'm starting to notice that redeeming
quality you were talking about.

382
00:26:52,425 --> 00:26:55,005
You'll have to ask yourself
if it was worth it in the morning.

383
00:26:56,675 --> 00:26:58,925
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

384
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:02,940
After your wife passed away,

385
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:05,625
and we'd have those long talks,

386
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:11,075
did you have any clue
how I felt about you?

387
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:14,415
I thought you felt sorry for me.

388
00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:18,636
I guess I thought
the same about you at first.

389
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:22,181
I thought you were absolutely brilliant.
Remember I used to call you

390
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,499
- Little Miss Brilliant...
- Just forget about that.

391
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:29,516
I could never be sorry about that.

392
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:33,465
Good night.

393
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,026
Would you like to come in?

394
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:33,441
I'm sorry, darling, I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

395
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:35,880
- Why?
- I just, I can't do this.

396
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:40,201
It's me.

397
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:44,249
I think we both know
it's a bit more complicated than that.

398
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,140
The word is "insane".

399
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:52,188
But this is also
a once in a lifetime chance for me.

400
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,445
Mandy...

401
00:29:00,064 --> 00:29:01,064
You know,

402
00:29:01,813 --> 00:29:03,713
probably better than anyone,

403
00:29:04,547 --> 00:29:07,055
how I was when Gloria passed away.

404
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:11,168
I recently experienced

405
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:15,045
something that made me
go through it all again.

406
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:17,671
More than a dream.

407
00:29:19,086 --> 00:29:21,086
As real as this is to you now,

408
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:24,741
and I can tell myself

409
00:29:25,267 --> 00:29:26,855
that it's been years

410
00:29:27,373 --> 00:29:28,533
all I like.

411
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:33,368
But in my heart

412
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:37,093
It's just happened again.

413
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,189
Well, at least this time...

414
00:30:01,297 --> 00:30:02,497
I can do this.

415
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:20,484
Sorry...

416
00:30:21,707 --> 00:30:22,757
What is it?

417
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,593
The Colonel needs to see you
in the interface room right away.

418
00:30:26,718 --> 00:30:29,160
- Both of you.
- Is everything all right?

419
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:31,495
No, it's about to hit the fan again.

420
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:34,304
Let's go.

421
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,429
You were gone for hours!

422
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:49,805
I know, I'm sorry.

423
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:51,660
I locked my keys in the car...

424
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:54,226
I thought you had gotten
into an accident.

425
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:57,367
I imagined you being taken away
by an ambulance!

426
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:00,848
Camile, I'm sorry!

427
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:02,776
My imagination just went...

428
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:09,299
I know what it's like to wait
for someone you love to come home.

429
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,640
I'm here now.

430
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:14,556
I know.

431
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,004
Mary?

432
00:31:22,734 --> 00:31:24,507
I don't know what's happening.

433
00:31:25,136 --> 00:31:26,742
I'm just going to elevate her legs

434
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:28,817
above her heart to stabilize.

435
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,998
You're doing fine,
just try and stay calm.

436
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:32,723
We were just talking,
and then she...

437
00:31:33,346 --> 00:31:34,350
I don't know.

438
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:37,219
- What's going on?
- She's going to be okay.

439
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,887
Lieutenant James left the comm room

440
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:43,609
without wiping her imprint

441
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,142
off of the stone.

442
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:47,655
It got knocked onto the table,
and nobody noticed.

443
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,908
We think that in that opportunity,
an alien might have taken advantage,

444
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,036
used the stones,
and sabotaged our FTL drive.

445
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:57,022
She told me she blacked out
around the time of the explosion.

446
00:31:57,147 --> 00:31:59,875
I thought it was
post-concussion syndrome.

447
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,254
Mystery solved.

448
00:32:03,592 --> 00:32:05,297
I don't see how it changes anything.

449
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,165
What part don't you get?

450
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,074
- They know we're here.
- Yeah, they already did.

451
00:32:10,616 --> 00:32:14,557
Without a tracking device, they can't
know where we've dropped out of FTL.

452
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,070
He's right.

453
00:32:16,536 --> 00:32:20,340
The void is unimaginably huge.
They can't know our location.

454
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:23,641
Unless the alien
who took over James's body

455
00:32:23,766 --> 00:32:25,442
managed to broadcast it.

456
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,571
Like a subspace message, you mean.

457
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:30,364
Or the alien

458
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,520
figured out our position
before the explosion

459
00:32:32,645 --> 00:32:34,159
and took it back with them.

460
00:32:34,851 --> 00:32:37,251
- How would it know how...
- They sabotaged the ship.

461
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,248
How did they know how to do that?

462
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:40,820
He's right.

463
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,496
That's it, then.

464
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:47,471
They're coming.

465
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:50,099
I'm so sorry.

466
00:32:50,224 --> 00:32:51,601
Don't be silly.

467
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:54,159
I brought this on myself.

468
00:32:57,218 --> 00:32:58,818
Forgive the intrusion.

469
00:32:59,223 --> 00:33:00,273
Come on in.

470
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,524
Colonel Young used the stones
to report.

471
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:09,028
Dr. Perry may have to return to her body
in the next several hours.

472
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,475
We think it's best that she returns
to an Air Force facility.

473
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,313
- We'll say our goodbyes.
- I'll wait outside.

474
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:41,926
Let's go!

475
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:47,608
This is Young.

476
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,195
<i>While repairs to the ship
are still days from being complete,</i>

477
00:33:51,716 --> 00:33:53,308
<i>despite our best efforts,</i>

478
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:56,533
<i>we believe an attack
will happen at any moment.</i>

479
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,468
<i>Shields will not withstand
a sustained bombardment.</i>

480
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:04,338
<i>This time, we will not
be able to jump to FTL.</i>

481
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,119
<i>Neither can we escape
through the Stargate.</i>

482
00:34:09,236 --> 00:34:12,780
<i>Lieutenant Scott will be in charge
of our ship's defenses.</i>

483
00:34:12,905 --> 00:34:15,205
<i>Follow his orders as you would mine.</i>

484
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,526
<i>If boarded,</i>

485
00:34:17,651 --> 00:34:21,190
<i>Sergeant Greer
will coordinate the strike teams,</i>

486
00:34:22,297 --> 00:34:23,560
<i>but everyone</i>

487
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,093
<i>will have to join in our defense.</i>

488
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,890
We'll give them a good fight.

489
00:34:40,243 --> 00:34:42,413
When the time comes,
don't wait too long.

490
00:34:49,994 --> 00:34:51,194
It'll be okay.

491
00:34:56,419 --> 00:34:57,428
I want you there

492
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,196
to talk me through it.

493
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,686
This is all my fault.

494
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,085
I panicked.

495
00:35:17,258 --> 00:35:18,574
The Chair...

496
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,864
<i>They're here, Sir.</i>

497
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:29,439
Tell me what to do.

498
00:35:29,612 --> 00:35:32,880
We've managed to isolate
the damaged module from the rest.

499
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,340
Command the ship to enter FTL
on the remaining drives...

500
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,050
How the hell do I do that?

501
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:41,096
First you have to sit in the Chair.

502
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:45,354
Wait!

503
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,727
Dr. Franklin just spoke.

504
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,437
Something about the Chair.

505
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,783
What about it?

506
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,949
That's all he said,
but I think he knows what's going on,

507
00:35:53,074 --> 00:35:54,943
and he was trying to say
it should be him.

508
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,111
You can't know.

509
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,197
No, Sir, but I really think that...

510
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,784
- We're under attack. I'm gonna do this.
- She might be right.

511
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,793
I can't ask a man
to sacrifice his life.

512
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:05,454
He's already been through it.

513
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,498
His brain will have
the time to heal.

514
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,125
- We don't have time for this!
- Which is why it should be him.

515
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,419
At least give him the choice.

516
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:36,944
This ship is under attack.

517
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:41,240
If someone doesn't go back,
sit in the Chair and help the repairs,

518
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,116
the ship's going to be taken.

519
00:36:44,794 --> 00:36:46,694
We're all going to be taken.

520
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,675
Do you understand

521
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,849
what we are asking you to do?

522
00:37:15,436 --> 00:37:19,086
Fire on the smallest ships.
They're going to try and board us.

523
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:35,239
Go back to your team.

524
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:57,024
The temperature's dropping fast.

525
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,396
Any idea why?

526
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,652
I don't know.
This is something new.

527
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:08,735
Go.

528
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,102
Something's happening.

529
00:38:55,344 --> 00:38:57,285
Sergeant, keep an eye on that door.

530
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,710
Dammit!

531
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,389
<i>We're about to be boarded
right on top of your position.</i>

532
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:08,514
Copy that.

533
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:17,765
- I thought you were...
- The FTL drive is powering up.

534
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:47,300
Does this mean you fixed the ship?

535
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,219
Camile?

536
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:52,514
No, it's me again.

537
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,143
Don't you hate that?

538
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:58,714
What's our status?

539
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:01,732
The damaged section of the ship
has been bypassed.

540
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,109
The FTL drive
has increased efficiency.

541
00:40:04,893 --> 00:40:07,446
It looks like
we're going to make it across.

542
00:40:18,103 --> 00:40:19,103
We did it.

543
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,693
Yes, we did.

544
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,820
And now it's time to go.

545
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,192
It's not a very nice thing to say,

546
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,974
but I do hope
you need my help again.

547
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:51,299
I'm not above arranging that,
you know.

548
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,006
Welcome back, Camile.

549
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,124
Anything happen?

550
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:56,774
You'd know better than I would.
I was watching a closed door.

551
00:41:56,899 --> 00:41:58,932
- Did it stay closed?
- Yes, Sir.
