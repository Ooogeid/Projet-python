1
00:00:00,956 --> 00:00:01,958
<i>Destiny.</i>

2
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:03,711
The design is clearly ancient,

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,348
launched hundreds
of thousands of years ago.

4
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:07,776
Where the hell are we?

5
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:09,860
Several billion
light years from home.

6
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:10,976
We're on a ship,

7
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:14,077
but we have no idea where we are
in relation to Earth.

8
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:16,937
This ship could be
the most important discovery

9
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:19,270
mankind has made
since the Stargate itself.

10
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:21,550
These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

11
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:23,713
We've got wounded.
We need to get home.

12
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:26,465
We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

13
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,904
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

14
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,778
Even if we can get the life support,

15
00:00:32,903 --> 00:00:35,041
- we don't have much food and water.
- Then go get some.

16
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,537
Little boys playing soldier.
I'm sorry I've no interest in playing...

17
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,857
I'm trying to save the lives
of everyone aboard that ship.

18
00:00:45,705 --> 00:00:47,514
We do have power issues
to be aware of.

19
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:50,049
If I wasn't being clear,
I was giving you an order.

20
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:32,474
- Dr. Rush, I was wondering if...
- Not now!

21
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:46,909
What are you doing?

22
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:49,031
Good morning.
Young asked us to figure out...

23
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:51,569
These systems are off for a reason.
They need to stay off!

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,225
Don't know whether the ship
has electrolyzed it to produce oxygen,

25
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,417
but you can see
there's not much left in there.

26
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:18,698
We did some calculations based
on our estimates of the water depth

27
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:20,431
- and tank dimensions.
- And?

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,501
- Just over 90,000 liters.
- 91,046.

29
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:25,770
Ish.

30
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,088
Go, math boy.

31
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,192
- Sounds like a lot.
- It wouldn't fill a swimming pool.

32
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:34,783
Still, it's enough to loosen
the rationing restrictions, isn't it?

33
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:37,156
I think I know
where you're going with this,

34
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:39,700
and believe me when I say
that I, too, could use a shower.

35
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:43,093
I don't think the showers use water.

36
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,152
They just spray a sort of mist

37
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:48,459
that you kind of stand in,
and it sorta beads up...

38
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:51,696
There's one in the crew quarters.

39
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:53,756
How do you know
if you haven't tried it?

40
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,266
How do you know I haven't tried it?

41
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:57,676
We know.

42
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,480
Thank you, Lieutenant Rosegarden.

43
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,517
He's right.
You're worse than he is.

44
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,972
You can tell them apart?

45
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,711
We also identified
a recycling system for liquid waste,

46
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:13,192
so once we get
that system up and running...

47
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:19,921
Okay, folks, let's have
a better day than yesterday.

48
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:21,205
Thank you.

49
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:30,062
- Your ration, sir.
- Thank you.

50
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:35,215
I ordered you here 20 minutes ago.

51
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:37,018
I've been working.

52
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:39,830
Throughout the night, actually,

53
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,348
trying to find out
why our power reserves are so low.

54
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,371
- I'm quite concerned, so should you be.
- Okay, how bad is it?

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,478
I haven't been able to access

56
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,124
any of the main systems yet,
so I don't know.

57
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:54,405
You look exhausted.
Maybe you should take a break.

58
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,913
Get the information we need
and make some informed decisions,

59
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,338
and we report...

60
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:04,535
Could you stop people running around

61
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:07,121
activating every bloody system
they can get their hands on?

62
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:08,372
I will.

63
00:04:09,964 --> 00:04:12,001
That was delicious.
Thank you very much.

64
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,708
That man is a lot of work.

65
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,679
Let's bring in the next one, please.

66
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:31,125
Doctor, I'm very sorry
to bother you.

67
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,244
I know you're busy,
but I really need your...

68
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:35,386
What did I say?

69
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:54,960
Projet-SG (1.00)

70
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,046
Come on, it doesn't have
to be profound.

71
00:04:58,171 --> 00:05:01,262
Just who you are
and something you want to say. Like...

72
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:06,151
I'm Eli Wallace, I'm 25 years old,

73
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:08,411
I'm currently unemployed,

74
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,706
and just for posterity's sake,
I'd like to say,

75
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,672
take your stinking paws off me,
you damn dirty ape!

76
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:20,535
I'm not really gonna say that.

77
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:22,696
Try it. Say something.

78
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:33,342
It could be that Rush
is just starting a fire

79
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,876
so he can put it out, or it could be

80
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,627
that he's so far ahead of us

81
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:39,797
he can see problems
that none of us can see.

82
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,091
What do you want us to do?

83
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:43,550
Help him.

84
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:46,428
The man likes to work alone.

85
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,098
With the way he's been treated,
you can hardly blame him.

86
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,975
I can blame him all day long.

87
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:54,311
- It's pretty hard not to, considering.
- This isn't helpful.

88
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,604
It's the truth.

89
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,292
We're stuck with Rush for now.

90
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:02,111
Scott is checking out the other shuttle,
seeing if it's operational.

91
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,531
He asked that you two join him
when we were done here, so off you go.

92
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Dismissed.

93
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:13,372
Please tell me that's everyone.

94
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,500
We still have the question
of what to do with the senator's body.

95
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:19,320
We'll get to him.
He's not going anywhere.

96
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,176
I'd appreciate a file on everyone
by sometime tomorrow.

97
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:23,831
Nothing fancy.

98
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,900
- My assignment, sir?
- Recipes, Becker.

99
00:06:29,116 --> 00:06:31,066
For the love of god, recipes.

100
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:37,224
2nd Lieutenant Vanessa James.

101
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:38,358
26.

102
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,398
Air Force Special Forces.

103
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:42,402
All I have to say is...

104
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,634
I don't want to die out here.

105
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:55,742
I thought we were done.

106
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:58,188
There are still dozens
of human resources issues

107
00:06:58,313 --> 00:07:00,209
- we need to talk about.
- Pick one.

108
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:03,756
The matter of Lieutenant Johansen
resigning her commission.

109
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,473
Consider her reactivated.

110
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:08,635
- I don't know if that's up...
- Up to me? Yeah, it is.

111
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,909
We need a medic.

112
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:13,741
I don't even know
why she resigned in the first place.

113
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,386
That's none of my business.

114
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:20,782
Colonel, look what we figured out.

115
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:22,854
We're calling it a recharging plate.

116
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,089
We've tweaked it so it works
with Earth technology.

117
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,767
We have to be careful
not to leave them on the plate,

118
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:31,241
or it fries the battery...

119
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:35,564
- Not bad.
- It's great.

120
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:37,634
- Turn it off.
- Why?

121
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,416
Rush says we have power issues.

122
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,126
We've got them to recharge.

123
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,202
But as soon as he gives the go-ahead,
you kids can go crazy.

124
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:47,466
For now, help me pass the word
to stop pushing buttons.

125
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,016
It's cool, guys.
This one's secure.

126
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,232
You can fly this thing?

127
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,006
I can fly an F-302.

128
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,861
Yeah, in a simulator.

129
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,198
This is a real spaceship, man.

130
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:13,317
Yes, it is.

131
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,163
So...

132
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:19,962
Pretty screwed up.

133
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,417
Yeah, pretty screwed up.

134
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,101
They're gonna work it out?

135
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:31,249
We're pretty freakin' far from home.
I don't know.

136
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,678
Not today.

137
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:38,600
You should have shipped out
weeks ago, T.J. It's not right.

138
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:40,715
It ain't right at all.

139
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:46,191
I'm here,
so what do you want us to do?

140
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:49,038
Help me figure out
what kind of bird we got here.

141
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:50,134
I just...

142
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:51,954
radioed Brody to come down,

143
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:54,029
help translate the controls.

144
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:57,558
Took me half an hour
just to find the "on" switch.

145
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:00,789
Maybe we can take a little joyride?

146
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,508
Oh, joy.

147
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:11,403
You don't have to follow me around.

148
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:13,988
- What do you mean?
- I mean that I'm okay.

149
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,896
You said something,

150
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:19,679
I thought you were following me,
and it was about to get awkward.

151
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,433
I don't mind the company. I just...

152
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:26,826
don't want to keep you
from anything important.

153
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:28,275
I am done with important.

154
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,731
- I'm taking the day off from important.
- You should.

155
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:32,506
- So should you.
- Me?

156
00:09:33,638 --> 00:09:36,235
I don't even know
what to do with myself, Eli.

157
00:09:36,548 --> 00:09:38,285
I'm the last person
who should be here.

158
00:09:38,924 --> 00:09:40,144
I'm second to last.

159
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,179
You're underestimating yourself.

160
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:44,736
So are you.

161
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:49,587
Can you show me how to use
that shower you were talking about?

162
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:53,388
Yes, I can.

163
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,413
Scott's checking out the shuttle,
seeing if it's operational.

164
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:02,115
Everyone else's holding
the work 'til you give the green light.

165
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,277
Thank you.

166
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:09,605
Look, I want you to know
that I'm well aware that in the field

167
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,665
of ancient technology,
or any other subject I can think of,

168
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,112
you're the best I've got.

169
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:17,972
But we can't be working
at cross purposes.

170
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:21,954
All I ask is that you check with me
before issuing orders...

171
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,957
Check with you?
No, you see, you got it backwards.

172
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,673
If you're doing something,

173
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:28,919
I want to know what it is,
and this is not a request.

174
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,698
Done. I'll tell you everything.

175
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:33,492
If there is an issue
that affects everybody on this ship,

176
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:36,760
- like we're running out of power...
- I think I already told you that.

177
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,172
I'm not here to snap you back
or piss you off,

178
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:43,046
but if we're gonna be on this ship
for any length of time, we need to be...

179
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:44,226
on the same page.

180
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,410
I think...

181
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:47,868
our length of time
together on Destiny

182
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:49,999
may be shorter than you think.

183
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:54,236
I get it.
Who can I bring in to help?

184
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:55,988
Honestly,

185
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:59,085
it may take longer than we've got
to bring someone else up to speed.

186
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:02,077
- Volker it is.
- Perfect, terrific.

187
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,538
You can tell him
to sit on his hands if you want to.

188
00:11:12,514 --> 00:11:13,914
Spencer, Sergeant.

189
00:11:14,913 --> 00:11:15,913
I'm 31.

190
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:19,553
All I want to say is
I never asked for this.

191
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,216
All I want is...

192
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:25,537
To get off this ship.

193
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:32,462
What's it feel like?

194
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:33,848
What?

195
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:37,491
What's it feel like
on your bare skin?

196
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:39,239
It's really warm!

197
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,154
I'm just standing guard!
Anybody could walk in.

198
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,093
What?

199
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,122
Whatever.
I need to talk to you.

200
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,095
Alone.

201
00:11:50,662 --> 00:11:51,766
It's important.

202
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:56,499
I am so torn.

203
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:00,635
Chloe, I'm gonna take Eli for a minute.
That all right with you?

204
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:08,571
I'll check back with you later, OK?

205
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:22,821
- Heard you could use a helper.
- You heard wrong.

206
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:25,932
Young said not to take no
for an answer.

207
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:28,330
If he wanted to be helpful,
he would have sent Eli instead.

208
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:30,482
Well, thank you for that,

209
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:33,524
but Eli's a kid, really,
and I'm an astrophysicist...

210
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:36,946
I neither need
nor want your help, all right?

211
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:42,196
Look, he's just gonna drag me
right back in here, and you know it.

212
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:44,224
Come on.

213
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:47,224
Right. I'm concerned
that Destiny is on the verge

214
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,066
of losing power.
Look for yourself.

215
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:53,754
This ship's been flying around
for a million years.

216
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:54,891
I know.

217
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:57,234
So I don't understand
why all of a sudden...

218
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,362
We showed up and started
doing things, how about that?

219
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:03,323
- Like what?
- Dialing back to Earth, for one!

220
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,173
Come on, we had to try.

221
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,559
Look out a window, man.

222
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:09,805
We're flying faster
than the speed of light.

223
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,498
Are we close to the end of our rope?

224
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,027
You're obviously not capable
of seeing the signs.

225
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,067
Well, speaking of signs,

226
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:20,362
when was the last time you slept?

227
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:23,087
If you know what you're looking for,
there are clear indications

228
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:25,262
power is being channeled
into life support...

229
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,515
How can you know that? We're still
locked out of the core systems.

230
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,558
Out!

231
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,978
- Okay, forget I said anything.
- Now!

232
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,188
- I'll work quietly.
- It's too late for that.

233
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,222
I told him you'd be a waste of time,

234
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:38,984
that we can ill afford!

235
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,512
If you can't see the signs
staring you in the face

236
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:43,310
then you're no good to me!
Get out!

237
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:11,114
Look...
We just want to talk.

238
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:14,561
You said "alone."

239
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,730
How else was I supposed
to get you out of there?

240
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,328
What's going on, Eli?

241
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:20,954
You mean right now?

242
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:22,402
Don't be an idiot.

243
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:25,947
You must be getting to know me,
because I respond really well to that.

244
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,543
We can't get a straight answer
from anybody about whether or not

245
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,160
we're gonna make it back to Earth.

246
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,101
I don't think anybody knows.

247
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:34,241
They don't know, or won't tell us?

248
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,917
I'm pretty sure if they knew,
they would tell you.

249
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:38,835
They'd tell you.

250
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:41,605
Me?

251
00:14:44,098 --> 00:14:45,217
Are you serious?

252
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,093
Yeah, we are, Eli.

253
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:48,887
You're on the inside.

254
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,792
Rush needs you,
the Colonel's looking out for you.

255
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,349
Tell you what,

256
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,437
if they tell me, then I'll tell you.

257
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:00,598
That's all we ask.

258
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:03,791
That's it?

259
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:07,108
Great.

260
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:08,900
This has been good.

261
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,117
I think as a group, we've bonded.

262
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,875
You got to be kidding me.

263
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,047
I know.

264
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,920
You were in there 5 minutes.

265
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:23,672
He kicked me out.

266
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:26,508
What's the matter with you?
You're a grown man.

267
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:30,720
- I know that, but he said out.
- What the hell did you say to the man?

268
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,223
Nothing! I was just trying to figure out
what his problem was.

269
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,615
It's our problem, Volker,
it's not just his.

270
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,645
- I need you to get back in there.
- I'm telling you, he's gone crazy.

271
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,689
We already knew that.
Go.

272
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,525
This isn't the old crazy,
this is a whole new crazy.

273
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,486
Would you like me to hold your hand?
Is that what you need me to do?

274
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,446
- Colonel, I'm trying...
- All right.

275
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:51,685
Here we go. Let's do this.
I'll take you there myself,

276
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,071
and for God's sake, if you people
can't stand up to the son of a bitch...

277
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:20,604
Did you do that, Rush?

278
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:23,481
Is that what you think?

279
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,176
No, I didn't,

280
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,988
but I have been standing here
for the past few minutes

281
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,803
watching systems fail

282
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,053
all over the ship, and there's nothing
that I could do to stop that.

283
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,912
The FTL drive
was amongst the last to go.

284
00:16:38,586 --> 00:16:40,790
We could be in range of a Stargate.

285
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,101
You see what I mean?

286
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,171
No, there's no countdown.

287
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:51,315
There's got to be
emergency reserves.

288
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,492
I don't think you seem to understand
what's going on here, Colonel.

289
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:57,650
Our reserves are gone.

290
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,842
All of our power is gone.

291
00:17:06,977 --> 00:17:08,291
Dr. Dale Volker.

292
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:10,613
I'm 34 years old,

293
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:16,048
and despite what you may
or may not have heard, from...

294
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:18,726
a certain scottish person,

295
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:21,611
I like to think
that I'm a pretty fine astrophysicist.

296
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:25,437
They don't send you to work
on solving the mysteries of the universe

297
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:27,627
on other planets
if you're a hack, right?

298
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,657
So...

299
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:31,848
That's all I have to say.

300
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:34,928
And we can't all be Mozarts, right?

301
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,231
Some of us are...

302
00:17:37,818 --> 00:17:38,894
Salieris.

303
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:42,577
Not that there's anything wrong
with that.

304
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:44,626
I like Salieri.

305
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,640
I find his music is...

306
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:52,345
It's soothing. I'm not suggesting
that he's Mozart, either.

307
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,892
Although Mozart did go a little nuts,
didn't he?

308
00:17:58,398 --> 00:17:59,644
All right, I'm done.

309
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:02,444
He's maybe a Schubert at best.

310
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:05,573
Or an Elgar.

311
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,243
I'm done, Eli.

312
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,842
The lights went off
in my compartment.

313
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:17,549
- It's the same all over.
- Why?

314
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:19,768
Why does everybody think
that I know everything?

315
00:18:28,694 --> 00:18:30,150
Not funny, Eli!

316
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,485
It wasn't me!
We had a power failure or something.

317
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,587
- I was on my way to go...
- Well, I'm freezing, and I can't see!

318
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:38,181
Wait...

319
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:40,160
Here, let me help.

320
00:18:41,644 --> 00:18:43,146
Sorry! Sorry...

321
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,088
Everything just stopped
and went pitch black.

322
00:18:46,378 --> 00:18:48,168
I completely freaked.

323
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:50,014
Yeah, we heard.

324
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:54,375
- How was the shower?
- Fine, thanks for asking.

325
00:18:55,691 --> 00:18:58,511
Look, just go find out
what's going on. I'm okay.

326
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:01,264
Here, here, it's something, anyway.

327
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:04,515
Don't make
any long distance phone calls.

328
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,647
Thanks.

329
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:13,735
Wait for me?

330
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:17,142
Sure.

331
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:20,686
- Turn around.
- Sure.

332
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:24,915
So it wasn't anything you did?

333
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,364
Since I arrived, I have been unable
to access any of the core systems,

334
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:31,703
power, navigation, or propulsion.

335
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:35,081
- Why didn't you bring somebody else in?
- Because I'm the only qualified person!

336
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:37,981
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Maybe it's like a lantian device.

337
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:41,482
- You need the ancient gene to access...
- Destiny predates that technology.

338
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:43,663
- You know that for a fact?
- Yes, Colonel!

339
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:45,741
I know many, many things for a fact!

340
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:49,604
I know you asked Gorman to poke around
in the weapons systems, for a fact!

341
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:52,649
I know you have ordered
teams of people all over the ship

342
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,365
to do things
that they know nothing about for a fact!

343
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:58,891
You think all those things
add up to this, Rush?

344
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:00,441
Does that make sense to you?

345
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:02,131
Look... Look!

346
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:05,408
No, you're right. You are right.

347
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:08,801
It was your reckless,
pointless attempt to dial Earth

348
00:20:08,926 --> 00:20:11,555
that robbed me of the time
I need to solve this problem!

349
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:13,711
Maybe we're missing something.

350
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,623
Yes, the opportunity of a lifetime!
Because you wouldn't listen to me!

351
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,835
T.J., this is Young.
We could use a medic in the gate room.

352
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:24,219
- Nobody's blaming you.
- I ran out of time!

353
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:26,017
- We can fix this.
- Fix this?

354
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,935
What do you think, just because
you give the order that it's possible?

355
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,270
There is no more power!

356
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:35,020
Destiny saved every last ounce
of its reserves for life support,

357
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:36,951
and I've seen it happening!

358
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:39,870
I've seen it being
sequestered away from me!

359
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:42,401
I tried to... I tried to stop it.

360
00:20:42,526 --> 00:20:44,159
I tried to stop it, but I couldn't.

361
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:46,486
In a few days' time, this...

362
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:48,790
This ship will go dark!

363
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:51,650
It will go dark and cold...

364
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:57,242
T.J., now.

365
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:04,264
I'm Sergeant Hunter Riley.

366
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:07,819
I'm one day short
of my 30th birthday.

367
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:12,114
I grew up on a farm.

368
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:16,226
I have relatives
who've never even left the state,

369
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:19,002
and here I am halfway
across the universe, so...

370
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,375
No regrets.

371
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:33,918
So...

372
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,234
Rush was right.
Everything but life support is dead.

373
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:39,487
Why now?
Why just when we show up?

374
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:41,439
Because we just showed up.

375
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,534
There's the Stargate.

376
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:45,932
It's a power hog,
and we had it on all day yesterday.

377
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:49,226
There's still some power and the shields
are still working to some degree.

378
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,719
- Again, that's to keep us alive.
- For how long?

379
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:55,090
We're gonna have to wait
for Rush to wake up for an answer.

380
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:57,595
T.J. says
he's not gonna be up for a while. So...

381
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:00,497
Where does that leave us?

382
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:03,275
- Dead.
- Dead.

383
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:06,335
Not right away.

384
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,620
Yeah, we have days, maybe a lot of days,
but if there's no Stargate in range...

385
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,870
And there's not.

386
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,553
We don't have the power anyway.

387
00:22:12,678 --> 00:22:15,792
So it's a race between food,
water, and life support.

388
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,017
I don't buy that.

389
00:22:17,142 --> 00:22:19,866
We can't do anything
without access to the ship's systems.

390
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:22,427
I mean, I could stand here all day.

391
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,512
I put a kino into search mode

392
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,598
and sent it into un-pressurized areas
of the ship looking for...

393
00:22:30,987 --> 00:22:33,309
an active console somewhere.
Nothing yet.

394
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,062
Also,

395
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,563
I was looking into if there's any way
we could integrate the shuttle's power

396
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:40,048
with the ship's system?

397
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,102
So you're working the problem.

398
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,185
Does the computer-hacking dropout
have to save our asses...

399
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,777
The dropout is still here.

400
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:56,249
Or are you gonna get
your head out of yours?

401
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,813
The shuttle idea's pretty good.

402
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:03,291
- Yeah, there might be a work-around.
- Let's do that.

403
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,181
Thank you, Eli.

404
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:12,931
By the way, it's...

405
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:15,294
MIT dropout.

406
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:17,411
You want a gold star for that?

407
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:20,764
- No, I just...
- Do something.

408
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:22,675
I'm gonna be gone for a few hours.

409
00:23:23,222 --> 00:23:25,080
- Gone?
- To report this mess.

410
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:27,253
If you need me, yank me back.

411
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,920
Lieutenant Matthew Scott.

412
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,675
I'm 26 years old,

413
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:39,902
and...

414
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:44,535
I'd like to say a prayer for all of us,
if that's okay.

415
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,132
Sure, yeah. Whatever you want.

416
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:49,326
The lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

417
00:23:52,628 --> 00:23:54,778
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures,

418
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:56,976
he leadeth me to still waters...

419
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:04,750
I'll take it from here, Peter.

420
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:05,882
Again?

421
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:08,883
What can I say?
I'm a glutton for punishment.

422
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:10,351
Okay.

423
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:04,501
- What's going on, Sergeant?
- Actually, I was coming to ask you.

424
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:10,120
Colonel Young went back to report.
I'm Colonel Telford.

425
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:12,228
I'd like to speak with
Dr. Rush immediately.

426
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:14,807
He's had a nervous breakdown, sir.

427
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,342
- What?
- But I can take you to Lt. Scott.

428
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:19,730
He's in the shuttle.

429
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,693
That was quick.

430
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:31,779
It doesn't take very long
to say "we're screwed."

431
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:34,461
I'm sorry, sir.

432
00:25:34,956 --> 00:25:36,749
I wish there was something
we could do.

433
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:42,456
There is.

434
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:01,182
I'll shout down when
she's ready to see you.

435
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:23,878
Lieutenant Tamara Johansen.

436
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:26,797
I'm a paramedic.

437
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,092
I actually quit my job
a few weeks ago.

438
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:33,176
I shouldn't even be here.

439
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:38,054
To think,
I could have missed all of this.

440
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:10,103
Emily...

441
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:11,776
No, don't.

442
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:15,716
I said that you could come in,
but that's all.

443
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,855
Scott, Johansen,

444
00:27:54,528 --> 00:27:55,689
a word, please.

445
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:04,125
There's no power
except for the shuttle?

446
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:06,147
Sir, you already know that.

447
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,478
Matt, this is Colonel Telford.

448
00:28:09,484 --> 00:28:10,576
That's right.

449
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:13,252
Would either of you
two officers care to explain

450
00:28:13,377 --> 00:28:15,818
how Colonel Young managed
to let things fall apart so fast?

451
00:28:16,748 --> 00:28:18,549
There was no way of knowing
this was...

452
00:28:18,674 --> 00:28:20,517
You're saying
Rush didn't see it coming?

453
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,090
That's what I thought.

454
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,662
I want to know what's really going on
aboard this ship.

455
00:28:30,182 --> 00:28:31,713
It's just, it's ridiculous.

456
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:32,845
It's true.

457
00:28:34,405 --> 00:28:35,685
Let's say that it is.

458
00:28:36,488 --> 00:28:37,590
Why?

459
00:28:39,147 --> 00:28:40,843
Why are you putting me through this?

460
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:43,715
Because I wanted to say...

461
00:28:58,647 --> 00:28:59,528
I'm sorry.

462
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,949
I didn't chose my job over you.

463
00:29:05,106 --> 00:29:06,710
It wasn't just about the job.

464
00:29:07,717 --> 00:29:08,725
I know.

465
00:29:19,596 --> 00:29:20,466
I love you.

466
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:48,953
I'm guessing that didn't go well.

467
00:29:51,729 --> 00:29:52,736
Sir...

468
00:29:59,837 --> 00:30:02,312
- How does this change anything?
- What do you mean?

469
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:04,928
Let's say that
I believe all of this.

470
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,138
I don't really, but even if I did,

471
00:30:07,617 --> 00:30:10,215
you did choose, and you chose to go.

472
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,590
- I didn't choose this.
- You knew there was a chance

473
00:30:12,715 --> 00:30:14,895
- you wouldn't be coming back.
- I am coming back.

474
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,940
No.

475
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,151
You wouldn't be here like this
to say goodbye

476
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,419
if you really thought
there was a chance.

477
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:25,064
Listen, I'm doing
everything that I can. I'm going...

478
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:27,199
I'm gonna do everything that I can.

479
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:30,591
I want nothing more
than to get back here to be with you,

480
00:30:30,716 --> 00:30:34,241
and I want nothing more than for you
to be here for me when I do get home.

481
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:38,878
I'm just saying
I don't know when that will be.

482
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,087
Please...

483
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,804
You made your choice, Everett.

484
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,489
And I made mine. Nothing's changed.

485
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:57,896
And I really...

486
00:30:59,145 --> 00:31:01,353
I really do hope that
you're gonna be okay.

487
00:31:01,478 --> 00:31:03,026
Don't. Don't, please.

488
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:04,687
Emily, please. Emily...

489
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,667
Just let me go.

490
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:18,715
I gave you a direct order.

491
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,856
Sir, I understand
you gave me a direct order,

492
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:23,928
and I respectfully suggest
it would be a complete waste of time!

493
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:26,217
I'm telling you,
the ship came here for a reason!

494
00:31:29,023 --> 00:31:31,222
- Sir?
- The ship came here for what reason?

495
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:34,186
- Colonel Young?
- Yeah.

496
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:36,872
What the hell was Telford
just ordering you to do?

497
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:40,081
Use the communication stones
to report that you need to be replaced.

498
00:31:40,537 --> 00:31:42,039
He's probably right about that.

499
00:31:42,807 --> 00:31:43,968
So, the ship...

500
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:46,153
came here for what reason?

501
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,919
The odds of coming out of FTL
on the outer edge of a star system

502
00:31:57,377 --> 00:31:58,657
are astronomical.

503
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:00,898
Throw in the fact that there are

504
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:03,748
three potentially habitable planets,

505
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:07,746
plus a gas giant to act as a comet
catcher on the outside of the system?

506
00:32:08,104 --> 00:32:09,426
We're talking miraculous.

507
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,792
So there's a chance now

508
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:14,598
that we're going to live...

509
00:32:15,663 --> 00:32:17,617
Though our definition of habitable

510
00:32:18,055 --> 00:32:21,780
just means the surface temperature range
allows for the presence of...

511
00:32:22,377 --> 00:32:23,385
liquid water,

512
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,625
and since the primary's a red dwarf,

513
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,805
the planets must have
a relatively short orbital radius

514
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,444
just to fall within that range,

515
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:34,618
which means there's a likelihood
at least one or two of them

516
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:38,984
will be tidally locked, meaning one side
will always be facing the star,

517
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:42,620
which increases the prospect
of geological instability

518
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:45,460
due to tidal stresses,
and I can't stand earthquakes.

519
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:47,275
I was in one when I was 13,

520
00:32:48,743 --> 00:32:51,150
and I cut both my feet
on broken glass.

521
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,965
But it might be nice!

522
00:33:09,131 --> 00:33:10,613
Hey. How are you?

523
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:15,784
How did I get here?

524
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:17,879
You're not that heavy.

525
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,516
You passed out for a little while.

526
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:24,742
- How long?
- About 10 hours.

527
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,589
It's probably the first real sleep
you've had since we arrived here.

528
00:33:30,606 --> 00:33:31,864
Has anything happened?

529
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:34,635
Not since we lost power, no.
You haven't missed a thing.

530
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:36,870
How do you feel?

531
00:33:38,086 --> 00:33:39,127
Embarrassed.

532
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:40,644
Don't be.

533
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,061
Well, you weren't there.

534
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,040
Your head's pounding, right?

535
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:49,147
How many cups of coffee
do you normally drink a day? Four, five?

536
00:33:50,704 --> 00:33:53,906
You're in caffeine withdrawal.
So are a dozen other people on board.

537
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:56,112
It can make you pretty crazy.

538
00:33:56,855 --> 00:33:58,160
You should see the smokers.

539
00:33:59,732 --> 00:34:01,205
You're looking at one.

540
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:03,332
Double whammy?

541
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:07,002
I was gonna let you sleep it off,
but Young wants you to see something.

542
00:34:11,973 --> 00:34:14,619
If you don't do one,
they're not gonna know who you are.

543
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:17,764
Eli, I have nothing to say.

544
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,972
People are gonna find this,
they're gonna want to know who we were.

545
00:34:21,971 --> 00:34:23,831
Look, I'll do your slate, okay?

546
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:25,900
This is Dr. Nicholas Rush.

547
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:28,636
He is the lead scientist
of the Icarus project.

548
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,928
Now just say what you feel.

549
00:34:57,423 --> 00:34:58,431
Come on in.

550
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:01,932
Orbital insertion trajectory?

551
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,711
- That was my first thought.
- I thought your first thought was

552
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:07,896
we were going fly
into the damn thing.

553
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,022
But no, sir.

554
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,601
I'm guessing
we'll get close enough to kiss,

555
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:13,343
but not enough for capture.

556
00:35:13,468 --> 00:35:14,812
An aerobraking maneuver?

557
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:18,391
The math's over my head,
but we should come out of a slingshot

558
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,950
somewhere in-system.

559
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,243
Where there are habitable planets.

560
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:25,956
I didn't tell him.

561
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,499
No, but you're all smiling.

562
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,725
We're still too far out to know
if they're anything more than rocks,

563
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:34,173
but we found three candidates
before Big Bertha filled up the sky.

564
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,793
So this trajectory
is no accident, then.

565
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:39,125
The man's quick.
We'll know once we're clear.

566
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:41,847
That'll be in... six minutes.

567
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,399
Who translated this?

568
00:35:44,873 --> 00:35:46,525
You know it's completely backwards.

569
00:35:50,387 --> 00:35:51,781
Well, pull up a chair, sir.

570
00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:53,971
This'll be a show
you don't want to miss.

571
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,447
So we're clear,

572
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:59,545
my definition of habitable
includes a sandy beach, a tropical...

573
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,534
There's gonna be severe turbulence
when we contact the atmosphere.

574
00:36:05,124 --> 00:36:07,998
- We'll pass the word.
- About our previous conversation.

575
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:11,548
- Rush, no need to apologize.
- I wasn't about to.

576
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:14,505
I was suffering
from withdrawal symptoms.

577
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,734
Yeah, I know.
I know all about it.

578
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:20,938
A lot of work.

579
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,897
Hello there.
Adam Brody is my name...

580
00:36:29,716 --> 00:36:31,015
Can I start again?

581
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:35,048
My name's Adam Brody,
as I said earlier.

582
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,727
Hello... cut.

583
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,315
Adam Brody, engineer.

584
00:36:42,404 --> 00:36:43,912
I like football, and...

585
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:46,490
- What?
- Dude, this isn't for a dating service.

586
00:36:46,615 --> 00:36:49,247
I don't know why that came out.
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

587
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:51,530
No, it's all good.
What do we got?

588
00:36:51,655 --> 00:36:53,967
We have your name, we have your job.

589
00:36:54,883 --> 00:36:56,266
What else is there?

590
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:59,692
- You're 40-something, so...
- 36.

591
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:05,386
We got that now.
We'll fix that in editing...

592
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,934
All that's left is
what you want to say for posterity.

593
00:37:11,582 --> 00:37:12,811
I always knew...

594
00:37:13,255 --> 00:37:14,860
I was gonna die in space.

595
00:37:15,873 --> 00:37:18,687
From the moment
I stepped through the Stargate, I...

596
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:24,737
I mean, I didn't expect this,
but I knew something...

597
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:27,144
Awful was going to happen.

598
00:37:29,987 --> 00:37:31,062
I just knew it.

599
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:36,611
This is Young.

600
00:37:36,736 --> 00:37:39,590
We are expecting atmospheric turbulence
in a few minutes.

601
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,391
Find a secure place
and plunk your asses down.

602
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,029
- Don't shoot, it's me!
- You can talk through that thing?

603
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,818
I can talk through this thing!

604
00:37:54,883 --> 00:37:57,443
- Riley asked me how to...
- I asked him how the kino works...

605
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:01,027
We took a wrong turn...

606
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,837
I can and will kick your ass.

607
00:38:03,962 --> 00:38:05,083
Let's do that later.

608
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:08,994
We're gonna pass close to a gas giant.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

609
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:12,059
We're short on radios.
Help me spread the word.

610
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:13,649
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

611
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:19,630
Wrong turn, really?

612
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:23,634
You gonna stick to that story?

613
00:38:26,026 --> 00:38:27,495
Go, help. Now.

614
00:38:55,048 --> 00:38:56,458
90 seconds to contact.

615
00:39:03,005 --> 00:39:04,549
Come on, come on...

616
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,717
I'm coming!

617
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,302
We don't have much time.

618
00:39:07,985 --> 00:39:09,888
You've seen planets from space.

619
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:15,119
How could you let yourself
get jaded to this stuff so fast?

620
00:39:15,244 --> 00:39:17,938
I'm not jaded.
I've just got other stuff on my mind.

621
00:39:21,013 --> 00:39:23,539
We're just passing through
the atmosphere of a gas giant

622
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:25,627
on the far side of the universe
in an...

623
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,700
ancient spaceship.
I'm sure there'll be other gas giants...

624
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,785
OK, let's go.

625
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:41,615
- Can we please slow down?
- Trust me, it'll be worth it.

626
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:47,634
I guess everybody had the same idea.

627
00:39:49,468 --> 00:39:50,663
It's beautiful.

628
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:07,446
30 seconds to contact. Hang on.

629
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,155
No, no, I need everyone
away from the walls.

630
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:18,415
Away from the walls.

631
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,315
The turbulence
could break your back.

632
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:29,373
Sit down.

633
00:41:29,004 --> 00:41:30,254
Hell of a ride!

634
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:33,156
Guess, it was.

635
00:41:34,814 --> 00:41:36,910
Let's find these planets
you were talking about.

636
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,655
There they are, dead ahead.

637
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:43,026
We should be able to analyze
the atmosphere of the nearest planet

638
00:41:43,151 --> 00:41:44,960
- within a few hours.
- Are we clear?

639
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:48,527
- Yes, sir. Did you catch any of that?
- I couldn't get back in time.

640
00:41:48,652 --> 00:41:50,841
- This is unbelievable.
- Lieutenant, look at this.

641
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:54,052
- You sure missed a great show.
- Please, everyone be quiet!

642
00:41:55,819 --> 00:41:57,139
Our trajectory has changed.

643
00:42:00,293 --> 00:42:01,305
Changed?

644
00:42:02,628 --> 00:42:05,522
The planet has altered Destiny's course
more than we hoped.

645
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,266
What are you talking about, Rush?

646
00:42:09,713 --> 00:42:11,741
Lieutenant,
what the hell is he talking about?
