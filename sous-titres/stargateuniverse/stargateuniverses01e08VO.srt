1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:02,405
<i>Destiny.</i>

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,086
The design is clearly ancient,

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,682
launched
hundreds of thousands of years ago.

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,019
Where the hell are we?

5
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:10,208
Several billion
light years from home.

6
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,936
We are on a ship,
but we have no idea where we are

7
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:14,350
in relation to Earth.

8
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:17,326
This ship could be
the most important discovery

9
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,598
mankind has made
since the Stargate itself.

10
00:00:19,723 --> 00:00:21,883
These are the wrong people,
in the wrong place.

11
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:24,086
We've got wounded.
We need to get home.

12
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:26,687
We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

13
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,279
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

14
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:34,158
- Looks like we entered the Hoth system.
- Minus 47 degrees Celsius.

15
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:35,837
Nasty planet.

16
00:00:35,962 --> 00:00:39,062
- How are we going to cut the ice?
- Plasma cutter cut through the ice.

17
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:41,882
- It's Dr. Rush. What's your status?
- We've got pure ice.

18
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:45,586
We should be able to break it up
into manageable pieces and haul it back.

19
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:00,101
Secure the perimeter.

20
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:04,067
Welcome to the jungle.

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,857
Let's get to work!

22
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:11,466
Your first alien planet.

23
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:14,503
Everything you expected?
More?

24
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:15,857
Less?

25
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:17,969
We saw what it was gonna be
like on the kino.

26
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,380
True.

27
00:01:19,669 --> 00:01:22,662
But it is nice to get off the ship,
get some fresh air.

28
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:25,452
Even if it is a bit sticky.

29
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:28,328
So you're not nervous at all?

30
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,989
Afraid some

31
00:01:30,114 --> 00:01:33,403
giant alien insect
is going to come out and bite you?

32
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:39,150
Sorry, I'm sure it's perfectly safe.

33
00:01:39,743 --> 00:01:41,719
Everyone has to pitch in
and do their share.

34
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:43,494
Including you, Eli.

35
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,830
What?

36
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:52,105
I need a break.

37
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:56,067
So hot.

38
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:59,729
All you're doing is standing there.

39
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,848
Making sure
nothing crawls up your ass.

40
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,747
And I appreciate that.

41
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:16,950
How's it going?

42
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:19,162
Good.

43
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,150
Digging?

44
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:25,931
You doing okay?

45
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:27,487
In general?

46
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:30,874
I'm fine.

47
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:32,528
Good.

48
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,625
Good. That's excellent.

49
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:42,594
What's so funny?

50
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:44,019
Nothing.

51
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,023
No, seriously.

52
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,876
You're laughing pretty hard.

53
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:51,741
Come on, tell me.

54
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,030
Why won't you tell me?

55
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,248
It's about me, isn't it?

56
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:05,549
How are we supposed to know
what's safe to eat?

57
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:07,072
We can't know for sure.

58
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:08,869
What's that saying?

59
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,987
"A starving man..."

60
00:03:21,164 --> 00:03:22,347
Maybe it wasn't ripe.

61
00:03:23,384 --> 00:03:24,388
Try it.

62
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:28,019
- No, thanks.
- You just exposed yourself now.

63
00:03:28,144 --> 00:03:29,473
Come on, seriously?

64
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:32,202
If you had a reaction,
we wouldn't know which one caused it.

65
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:34,729
Volker just puked.

66
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,826
Have you eaten anything here?

67
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:42,896
Sorry.

68
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,389
Are you staying hydrated?

69
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:48,705
What about any numbness,

70
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:50,807
- or how's your vision?
- No, it's...

71
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:53,684
My head's pounding,
and my neck's a little...

72
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:58,521
We should get him back to the ship.
Eli, dial back.

73
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:13,507
I don't know,
I just started feeling dizzy.

74
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,942
It came on pretty fast.

75
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:19,589
- You're running a temperature.
- I thought it was just the heat.

76
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,495
Is your neck bothering you?

77
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:24,504
It just started.
Stiff at the back, mostly.

78
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:27,741
Right.

79
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:28,877
I'm on it.

80
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:30,829
Guys, listen up!

81
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:33,210
Get your stuff, we're bugging out!

82
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:34,346
Wait, wait.

83
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,623
We can't leave.

84
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:38,564
If it's something that they got here,
it could be contagious.

85
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:40,444
So, what are we supposed to do?

86
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:43,883
We have 36 hours
before the Destiny leaves.

87
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:46,220
For the sake of everyone else
on board, I say we...

88
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:47,802
- We wait.
- Here?

89
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:49,325
For what?

90
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,831
At least for a little while.
Just see how this plays out.

91
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:10,684
Projet-SG (1.00)

92
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:13,801
It could be anything, really.

93
00:05:13,926 --> 00:05:16,962
A virus, a bacteria.
There's no way to know if it's airborne.

94
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,113
<i>You've only been there three hours.</i>

95
00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:20,996
If it's something
they picked up locally,

96
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,524
then the progression
is unfolding quickly.

97
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:25,316
Until we know more, I'm recommending

98
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:28,429
that we don't return to the Destiny
with anything that might be contagious.

99
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:29,556
<i>Roger that.</i>

100
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:32,761
Let us know if anyone on board
is exhibiting similar symptoms.

101
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:35,941
At least that way we'll know for sure
if it has nothing to do with the planet.

102
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:37,097
<i>Will do.</i>

103
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:39,075
<i>Check in every hour regardless.</i>

104
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,407
Copy that.

105
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:41,543
<i>Young out.</i>

106
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:08,206
Shut it off, Greer.

107
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:17,588
You must have some suspicions.
I've seen you giving them shots.

108
00:06:17,713 --> 00:06:20,084
I started them both
on high doses of antibiotics.

109
00:06:20,637 --> 00:06:22,955
I hate to waste it,
but given the symptoms of headache,

110
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,305
fever, and neck pain,

111
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,759
- it's better to be safe than sorry.
- So what is it, bacterial meningitis?

112
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,428
I don't know,

113
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,356
but if it turns out
that's what it is,

114
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,317
and I haven't done anything,
they could die.

115
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:34,446
You don't know.

116
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:36,758
You're using up our antibiotics
on a hunch?

117
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,824
That was my judgment call.

118
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,077
That's great.

119
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:50,459
- I thought it wasn't far.
- It's not.

120
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,216
You doing okay?

121
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:55,919
Fine.

122
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,409
Over here.

123
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:01,244
What is that smell?

124
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:03,823
It's sulphur.

125
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:06,186
I'd hate to see the ants
who made those.

126
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:13,097
Hello! What are you doing?
Haven't you seen alien?

127
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:16,191
- This is what's making people sick?
- I don't know.

128
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:19,605
They make chemical weapons
from this stuff.

129
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:23,768
But we don't know
the exact compound or concentration.

130
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:27,527
- There's more over here.
- It's all right, I believe you.

131
00:07:29,178 --> 00:07:32,688
Look, I know she doesn't want to make
anybody else on the ship sick,

132
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:34,781
but what if staying here

133
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:37,098
is going to kill us?

134
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:41,923
This couldn't get much worse.

135
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,141
I'm afraid
that's a failure of imagination.

136
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:49,631
Top five desert island movies.

137
00:07:52,107 --> 00:07:53,118
What?

138
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:54,744
It'll help pass the time.

139
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,402
I'll go first.

140
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:01,187
Hackers.
Obvious, I know.

141
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,328
The matrix.

142
00:08:04,824 --> 00:08:05,850
Old school.

143
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:08,612
You got to have something
to make you laugh, right?

144
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,543
If trilogies count as one,

145
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:14,703
then all three original <i>Star Wars</i>,

146
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,811
but if only one, then, Empire.

147
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:20,868
That's four.

148
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,173
Man, this is hard.

149
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,189
I could pick so many.

150
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:28,212
Maybe it should be top 10...

151
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:32,152
- Good will hunting has got to be...
- James is not doing well.

152
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,844
- Where is she?
- How many does that make now?

153
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:38,399
That's Chloe, Volker,
Marsden and Franklin.

154
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:39,691
Now James, too.

155
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:42,072
- Let me look at your eyes.
- I'm fine.

156
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:44,111
You're not.
You need a shot too.

157
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:53,624
Dial out!

158
00:08:54,102 --> 00:08:55,220
Dial the gate!

159
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,204
Destiny, come in.

160
00:08:57,461 --> 00:08:59,189
If you can hear me, please respond!

161
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:00,918
- What's wrong?
- I don't know!

162
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:03,209
- Why is it doing that?
- We've got to get out of here!

163
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,538
- We can't!
- Why is it doing that?

164
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:41,288
What the...

165
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:45,950
Did you guys hear?

166
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,869
There was a kino already there?

167
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:49,287
How is that possible?

168
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,634
We dropped out of FTL, the gate dialed,
we sent a kino to check out the planet.

169
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:56,460
They go through,
and there's another one already there

170
00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:58,485
lying on the ground
not far from the gate.

171
00:09:59,814 --> 00:10:00,825
Guys?

172
00:10:01,486 --> 00:10:03,405
We only sent one kino, right?

173
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:05,300
Turns out the databank was full.

174
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:07,966
Looks like the databank is full.

175
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,561
- What's on it?
- Us.

176
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:14,967
What do you mean, "us"?

177
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:18,700
They're watching the recording now,
but I heard a bunch of us are on it.

178
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:20,209
Doing what?

179
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:23,584
Going through the gate to the planet
to gather food.

180
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,991
Then apparently some people
started getting sick.

181
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:30,212
- I think that I was one of them.
- But that didn't happened.

182
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,380
Obviously.

183
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,215
You're fine, right?

184
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:35,052
Apparently,

185
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,219
they found human remains, too.

186
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,179
It's weird.

187
00:10:49,193 --> 00:10:50,204
You okay?

188
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:51,486
It just hit me.

189
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:54,807
Sure you're okay otherwise?

190
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,221
- Pretty understandable.
- Not to me.

191
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:01,410
I was talking about the barfing.

192
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:02,999
I was moving on.

193
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,900
How is this possible?

194
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:08,164
I don't know.

195
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:10,335
What about an alternate reality?

196
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:16,216
Sir, given the illness
that developed on the planet,

197
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,303
I suggest that we quarantine everyone
who went through to retrieve this kino.

198
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,434
And everyone they came
in contact with since returning.

199
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:27,564
- That's all of us.
- Here.

200
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,438
I'll have to coordinate on radio

201
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,773
Brody was also in the gate room
when they got back.

202
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,567
We were only there for, like,

203
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:35,746
a half hour at most.

204
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,539
That's more than enough time
to come in contact with a contagion.

205
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,016
Wait a second.

206
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:42,828
You're worried because
people got sick on this recording,

207
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,791
which never happened.

208
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:46,538
We don't know that.

209
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:50,876
- What are you saying?
- That is clearly us.

210
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,753
The recording happened somehow.

211
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,963
What do you think
was wrong with the gate?

212
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:58,008
It looks like the wormhole connection
was unstable.

213
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,557
It would have been extremely dangerous
to even attempt travel.

214
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:06,391
Sir?

215
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,018
Go.

216
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:13,987
So...

217
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:15,650
Keep watching?

218
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:20,739
Can you fast forward, please?

219
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:30,415
<i>Chloe's dead.</i>

220
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:40,133
<i>All dead.</i>

221
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,541
Something's wrong with the gate.

222
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:52,176
Rush doesn't think
we can risk using it,

223
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:53,968
even with what's happened.

224
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,395
We can't reach Destiny
on radio, either,

225
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,476
so apparently we're trapped here.

226
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:12,899
There's 22 hours until Destiny
jumps back into FTL.

227
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:20,549
The creatures seem to be nocturnal.

228
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,598
They stopped coming
once the sun came up.

229
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:28,152
Hopefully the gate will start working
before it gets dark again.

230
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:31,054
Apparently...

231
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:33,911
We don't have much ammunition left.

232
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:36,688
What are you doing?

233
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:51,064
Volker wasn't killed
by the creatures.

234
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,867
T.J. Says he died of the illness
during the night.

235
00:13:54,357 --> 00:13:57,228
Everyone seems to be coming down
with symptoms at this point...

236
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,355
Do I need to point out yet again

237
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,549
that documenting this
could be important?

238
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:03,968
See?

239
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:05,259
See?

240
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,846
- <i>Who do you think is gonna see that?</i>
- Us.

241
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:09,621
Us! We are!

242
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:11,122
<i>You look ridiculous.</i>

243
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:12,321
<i>It won't fly.</i>

244
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,452
<i>If someone hadn't shot it...</i>

245
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:23,639
Scott was bitten
by one of the creatures.

246
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,283
He's now in a coma.

247
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:26,798
Eli, you okay?

248
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:30,178
Compared to most everyone else.

249
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,966
Don't go too far.
We are under quarantine.

250
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:39,567
Sergeant Greer
has found a cave nearby.

251
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:43,229
It could be our best chance
to survive another night,

252
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,333
if it comes down to that.

253
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:47,232
We could use some help!

254
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:50,189
Good man.

255
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:54,707
My turn.

256
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,608
Sorry.

257
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:02,943
So at least
it's a defensible position.

258
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:04,635
Backs to the wall.

259
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,190
Better than being exposed
on all sides.

260
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:22,213
I have a lot of respect
for people who do what you do.

261
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:25,549
It's not easy.

262
00:15:26,611 --> 00:15:28,119
I can tell it really...

263
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,716
affects you
when you can't help people.

264
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:32,731
It does.

265
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:37,204
My mom was a nurse.

266
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,499
She got stuck by a needle

267
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,616
trying to restrain a junkie
in the E.R.

268
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,541
<i>She got HIV.</i>

269
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:49,920
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

270
00:15:52,436 --> 00:15:54,226
My father couldn't handle it.

271
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:56,756
He just left.

272
00:15:58,356 --> 00:15:59,772
I was 14 at the time.

273
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:01,962
That must have been hard on you.

274
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:06,191
Do you have a family?

275
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:08,748
My parents.

276
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:10,383
My dad's retired.

277
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:12,378
What did he do?

278
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:14,080
He was a tailor.

279
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:17,152
He's actually the one
who taught me how to do stitches.

280
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:19,143
I remember this one time

281
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:21,836
he cut himself pretty badly
with some scissors, and...

282
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:25,931
He sewed it up himself
and kept right on working.

283
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:30,002
Brothers or sisters?

284
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:31,278
A sister.

285
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:33,108
She has two kids.

286
00:16:34,646 --> 00:16:35,783
I miss them.

287
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:42,013
I'm really afraid
that my mom's just going to give up

288
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:44,055
if I die out here.

289
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:58,403
I remember as a kid, I was...

290
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:00,870
I don't know, maybe seven or eight,

291
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:02,829
my grandfather died,

292
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:05,106
and my parents took me
to the funeral.

293
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,481
Watching his casket

294
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,401
getting lowered into the ground,

295
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,003
it was the first time
that I realized

296
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:14,086
I was going to die one day.

297
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,202
I mean, I knew people died.

298
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,902
I'm talking about the idea
that my consciousness was going to end.

299
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:25,126
I wasn't gonna see
what happened to the world.

300
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,422
It was such an empty,

301
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:31,299
<i>dark feeling,</i>

302
00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:34,956
<i>like I was falling down
a pitch-black hole. It was...</i>

303
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:37,086
<i>Scared the crap out of me.</i>

304
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:40,056
<i>I take it you don't believe
in the afterlife.</i>

305
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:43,395
<i>That fear</i>

306
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:45,864
<i>was almost too much to handle.</i>

307
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:47,482
<i>I guess maybe I thought</i>

308
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,953
I'd just get used to it.

309
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:51,531
But you don't.

310
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,686
It scared me just as much

311
00:17:55,811 --> 00:17:57,117
every time.

312
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:01,296
<i>Most people realize their own mortality
at some stage of the game, Eli.</i>

313
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:03,790
<i>It's not a particularly
unique experience.</i>

314
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:05,234
<i>I know.</i>

315
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,168
<i>The question is,</i>

316
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:08,972
did it change you?

317
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,964
Did it inspire you to make something
of this short existence that we have?

318
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,642
I'm here,

319
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:19,525
aren't I?

320
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:23,819
Of course, the Ancients...

321
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,402
evolved to a point where their...

322
00:18:26,963 --> 00:18:29,069
physical bodies
were no longer necessary,

323
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:33,106
found a way for consciousness
to become immortal.

324
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:37,050
You really think that's possible?

325
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:41,335
I know it is.

326
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:47,207
Maybe not for you and me,

327
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,624
but that idea...

328
00:18:52,082 --> 00:18:53,794
It's the reason why I ended up here.

329
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,773
You think if we learn enough,

330
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:01,490
that somehow,

331
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,934
somewhere out there

332
00:19:04,432 --> 00:19:06,716
we could discover how it's done?

333
00:19:12,507 --> 00:19:14,142
We have to make it through the day.

334
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:25,330
You're okay?

335
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:27,398
It didn't happen.

336
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,460
It's not clear what happened.

337
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:32,840
I know I didn't go to that planet

338
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:35,006
and have all those people die
under my watch.

339
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,859
It wasn't your fault, Sergeant.

340
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,878
There was anything
you could have done differently.

341
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:43,132
I am not interested
in what did not happen.

342
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:51,657
Regardless of how that recording
came into existence,

343
00:19:51,782 --> 00:19:53,233
avoiding the issue is simple.

344
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:55,818
We just don't go back
to that planet.

345
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,863
Doesn't bother you?

346
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,033
Like you said, it didn't happen.

347
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:04,292
Just a story, right?

348
00:20:05,603 --> 00:20:08,335
I am curious to find out
how it turns out, though.

349
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:15,195
Not me.

350
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:21,980
What just happened?

351
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:24,138
She started complaing
that her head hurt.

352
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:25,858
She just dropped.

353
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,100
It's been three hours
since we dropped out of FTL.

354
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:31,354
That's about the time
people began to get sick

355
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,178
on the planet in the recording.

356
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:37,911
Over here.

357
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,251
Right here.

358
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,488
You said she just passed out?

359
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:45,930
I've got 4 more cases. Everyone who went
to the planet, or came in contact

360
00:20:46,055 --> 00:20:48,204
- with someone who did.
- Can it be contained?

361
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:51,511
I don't know, but whatever it is,
it's extremely virulent.

362
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:55,394
On the kino recording,
Eli said Volker died because of it.

363
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:57,422
How quickly?

364
00:20:58,332 --> 00:20:59,530
Within 12 hours.

365
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,274
M4 carbine.

366
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:09,720
Hold the grip firmly,

367
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:12,355
stock braced against your shoulder.

368
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,786
It's got a kick.

369
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:16,257
Keep your finger off the trigger

370
00:21:16,382 --> 00:21:18,743
until you're ready to kill
whatever it is you're pointing at.

371
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:19,972
Short bursts.

372
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:21,366
We don't got much ammo.

373
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,050
Go ahead.

374
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,265
You mean shoot for real?

375
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,050
That way.

376
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:31,989
Safety's off.

377
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:43,697
What happened to short bursts?

378
00:22:00,372 --> 00:22:03,293
- You sure they're down there?
- Saw 'em go home last night.

379
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:06,488
You really think
this is a good idea?

380
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:08,044
The best defense

381
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:09,601
is offense.

382
00:22:12,537 --> 00:22:13,955
Fire in the hole.

383
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:15,639
Literally.

384
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,291
I hope we didn't just piss them off.

385
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,117
That's disgusting.

386
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,274
Come on,
we got more of these things to hit.

387
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,947
His pulse is very weak.

388
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:07,910
- Did using the other remote help?
- We were able to get a connection,

389
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:10,315
but the wormhole is still unstable.

390
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:12,476
Nothing from Destiny on the radio.

391
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,696
Is it broken or is there a chance
it could resolve by itself?

392
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:19,758
There are a number of things that
could be causing temporary interference.

393
00:23:20,093 --> 00:23:23,361
We have 11 hours until Destiny
is supposed to jump back into FTL.

394
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,696
There's no way of telling
how long it's gonna last.

395
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:28,502
And I guess it would be crazy
to try and go anyway.

396
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,491
We can't assume

397
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:34,987
that the gate is actually
even connecting to Destiny.

398
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:38,467
There'd be very little chance
of surving an unstable wormhole.

399
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,477
A fire would be nice.

400
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:43,609
I couldn't find any dry wood.

401
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:55,298
Are they still watching
the recording?

402
00:23:57,954 --> 00:24:00,148
I don't know what to do.
They just keep showing up,

403
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:03,107
and I don't have enough antibiotics
for all these people.

404
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,152
It would help if I knew the cause.

405
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,331
You're not feeling good?

406
00:24:14,971 --> 00:24:16,137
Just go slow...

407
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:33,049
See anything?

408
00:24:35,161 --> 00:24:36,173
Good.

409
00:24:36,764 --> 00:24:38,314
Maybe we got them all today.

410
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:45,814
You see that?

411
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:48,246
Did you see something?
I think I saw something!

412
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:51,241
If you see anything move out there,
don't ask,

413
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:52,636
just shoot.

414
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,104
Right.

415
00:25:06,247 --> 00:25:07,258
I think...

416
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:09,188
the batteries in this one are dead.

417
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,630
The kino has night vision.
Why didn't I turn it on?

418
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:19,225
Never mind.

419
00:25:32,986 --> 00:25:34,247
Come on, come on!

420
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,623
I don't think we're gonna make it.

421
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:00,287
I'm out!

422
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,728
Come on, come on...

423
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,207
Gimme!

424
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:07,881
Where are you going?

425
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:09,170
He's crazy.

426
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,960
You're crazy!

427
00:26:11,645 --> 00:26:12,654
You are.

428
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:14,905
Come back!

429
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:17,630
Wait!

430
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,801
Son of a...

431
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:31,772
Wait!

432
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:34,149
- Stop!
- Someone's got to try.

433
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:35,954
Look, I'll radio if I make it.

434
00:26:36,265 --> 00:26:38,130
- You'll know it's safe.
- If?

435
00:26:39,046 --> 00:26:40,057
But you said...

436
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:44,151
For a moment there,
I thought we were in trouble.

437
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:47,690
What?

438
00:26:51,455 --> 00:26:54,241
"For a moment there,
I thought we were in trouble?"

439
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:57,355
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

440
00:26:57,938 --> 00:26:58,699
It's...

441
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:01,118
Butch's last line
before he and Sundance

442
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,246
run out to face the Bolivians.

443
00:27:03,795 --> 00:27:05,164
One of my favorites, too.

444
00:27:07,557 --> 00:27:09,904
We do have something
in common after all.

445
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,929
<i>Destiny?</i>

446
00:27:20,578 --> 00:27:21,589
Come in!

447
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:53,570
What is it?

448
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,761
Some sort of microorganism.

449
00:27:55,886 --> 00:27:58,772
- Something from the planet?
- Not the planet they just went to,

450
00:27:58,897 --> 00:28:01,220
the planet you and Scott went to,
the ice planet.

451
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,847

How do you know?

452
00:28:03,663 --> 00:28:05,826
This is a sample of the water
we've been drinking?

453
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,519
When people outside the quarantine
started having symptoms,

454
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,537
I knew we need to look for
another source.

455
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:12,407
But we tested it at the time.

456
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:14,649
At the time, we couldn't see it.

457
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:16,912
The microscope
just wasn't powerful enough,

458
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:18,738
the organism was too small.

459
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:20,406
Well, it isn't now.

460
00:28:20,837 --> 00:28:23,420
It's possible that a batch of water
wasn't purified properly,

461
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:25,024
and it contaminated the rest.

462
00:28:25,322 --> 00:28:26,516
So we've all got it?

463
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,022
 Everyone's
immune system is different.

464
00:28:29,147 --> 00:28:31,375
The time it takes for symptoms
to emerge will vary,

465
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:34,046
but once it's strong enough
to pass from the blood

466
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,496
to the nervous system,

467
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,433
it works fast,

468
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:39,299
and the antibiotics won't cut it.

469
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:43,368
For a moment,
I thought we were in trouble.

470
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,534
Oh, my god!

471
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:15,737
Oh, my god...

472
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:42,606
It's 45 minutes...

473
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,187
Until Destiny jumps back into FTL.

474
00:29:49,283 --> 00:29:51,599
Everyone here is dead except me.

475
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:57,242
I don't remember much
after we were attacked.

476
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:59,246
One of the creatures...

477
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,188
bit me, and...

478
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:02,744
I lost consciousness.

479
00:30:04,341 --> 00:30:06,214
I was starting to feel sick,

480
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:09,261
headache,
pain in the back of the neck.

481
00:30:10,012 --> 00:30:11,671
The bite still hurts like a bitch,

482
00:30:11,796 --> 00:30:13,894
but everything else is...
Is better.

483
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,565
The gate still doesn't seem
to be working.

484
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:20,092
I can't reach Destiny on the radio.

485
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:23,950
I'm hoping it's just
a communications problem,

486
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:25,589
and that everything else is...

487
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:27,291
Is OK up there.

488
00:30:28,503 --> 00:30:32,097
I'm sending this through, I'm expecting
that you will send a signal

489
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:33,815
that it is safe to proceed.

490
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,710
I will wait as long as I can,

491
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,992
and then
I'll head through regardless.

492
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:40,141
On my own,

493
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,549
I likely won't survive
the night here.

494
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:11,077
What just happened?

495
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,368
It went back in time.

496
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:22,365
What are you doing?

497
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,154
Making sure it hasn't happened yet.

498
00:31:25,814 --> 00:31:27,152
What hasn't happened yet?

499
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:29,518
A solar flare.
It's the only explanation.

500
00:31:30,652 --> 00:31:33,537
If a wormhole's trajectory
takes it too close to a star,

501
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:36,459
and it passes through
an active solar flare,

502
00:31:36,746 --> 00:31:39,353
it can cause it to move
forwards or backwards in time.

503
00:31:39,712 --> 00:31:40,718
In some cases,

504
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:43,205
the wormhole can actually
loop back around

505
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,547
and connect to the same gate
in a different time,

506
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:47,353
in this case, the past.

507
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:53,326
This is making my brain hurt.

508
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:56,277
Oh, my god.

509
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,624
Back to the future.

510
00:31:59,032 --> 00:32:00,700
How could I not put that on my list?

511
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:04,171
The "us" on that recording dropped
out of FTL and went to the planet.

512
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,423
Some time later,
a solar flare occurred,

513
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,212
preventing normal gate travel.

514
00:32:08,337 --> 00:32:11,977
So Scott thought that he was sending
the kino back to the Destiny,

515
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:14,848
but he was actually sending it
back to the planet,

516
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,034
but in the past.

517
00:32:16,874 --> 00:32:19,895
God, that is so weird to think
that was really us on the kino.

518
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:22,398
Us in a previous unaltered timeline,

519
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,078
modified now by the introduction
of the kino from the future.

520
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:28,433
Why are we dialing
the gate back there?

521
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:29,363
As I said,

522
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,968
to make sure the solar flare
that disrupted gate travel

523
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:33,188
hasn't happened yet.

524
00:32:33,823 --> 00:32:35,987
Thankfully, it hasn't.

525
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:38,372
But why do we care about that?

526
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:41,325
Because I think
we might have to go back there.

527
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:49,851
I was starting to feel sick,

528
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,595
<i>headache,
pain in the back of the neck.</i>

529
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,139
<i>The bite still hurts like a bitch,</i>

530
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,615
<i>but everything else is...</i>

531
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,748
<i>Is better...</i>

532
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:00,227
It's possible, I guess.

533
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,979
The venoms of various animals,

534
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,885
snakes, spiders, scorpions,

535
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,234
they've been tested
for their antibiotic properties.

536
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,431
Are you saying
that thing that bit me

537
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:10,529
can actually cure
what's making everybody sick?

538
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,691
You fell into a coma. It releases
a sort of venom when it bites.

539
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:18,125
You apparently survived,
said you were feeling better.

540
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:19,464
But...

541
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,318
You were just guessing,

542
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:23,334
and those things were...

543
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:26,431
Based on this video,

544
00:33:26,556 --> 00:33:29,275
people are going to die
from this infection, and quickly.

545
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:31,959
It seems like
a wild stab in the dark,

546
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:34,988
- but I don't know what else to do.
- We've all been exposed,

547
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,843
so it's just a matter of time
before we all get it, right?

548
00:33:42,025 --> 00:33:43,103
I'll go, sir.

549
00:33:44,604 --> 00:33:46,021
Not by yourself, you won't.

550
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,801
We don't need liabilities, Scott.

551
00:33:54,004 --> 00:33:55,250
I'm good to go, sir.

552
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:57,763
Getting kino visuals.

553
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,452
It's night time, and...

554
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:01,830
surprise, surprise, it's raining.

555
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,861
Which means those things
will probably be out.

556
00:34:03,986 --> 00:34:05,957
Too bad.
They were easy pickings

557
00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:08,462
when they were sleeping
in their nests during the day.

558
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,003
- We can't wait.
- According to the time stamp

559
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:12,844
on the recording, you have an hour

560
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,492
until the first team lost contact
because of the solar flare.

561
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:18,173
- 45 minutes, to be safe.
- How many do you think we'll need? 

562
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,891
Hopefully a small dosage
of the venom will do it.

563
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:22,226
Dead or alive?

564
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,138
Alive, preferably.

565
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:26,563
I can't exactly
anticipate the physiology.

566
00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:28,190
Not much time.

567
00:34:29,086 --> 00:34:30,100
Good luck.

568
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:51,658
What?

569
00:34:54,194 --> 00:34:55,663
Her pulse is very weak.

570
00:34:57,551 --> 00:34:59,269
I just want you to be prepared.

571
00:34:59,795 --> 00:35:01,408
I'm not sure she's going to make it.

572
00:35:02,418 --> 00:35:03,554
Of course she is.

573
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,304
We're out of antibiotics.

574
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:50,574
Why do people
always wait until times like these

575
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:52,274
to tell how they really feel?

576
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:55,667
It's so stupid.

577
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:56,792
I just...

578
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:05,675
I screw it.

579
00:36:09,452 --> 00:36:12,520
We haven't known each other
that long,

580
00:36:12,645 --> 00:36:13,845
but I think...

581
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:17,004
We make each other happy.

582
00:36:18,822 --> 00:36:20,894
When I'm near you,
things are just...

583
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,621
Better.

584
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:29,447
You don't even know
how amazing you are.

585
00:36:33,936 --> 00:36:35,024
It doesn't matter.

586
00:36:42,504 --> 00:36:44,812
I've never had a best friend before.

587
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:51,850
Never... Never known anyone
like that before, never loved...

588
00:36:55,084 --> 00:36:56,096
I just...

589
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:03,107
I need to make sure that you know

590
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:08,343
that I'm here for you...

591
00:37:12,558 --> 00:37:13,633
Always will be.

592
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:22,071
Please don't die.

593
00:37:44,902 --> 00:37:46,065
She's gone.

594
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:45,533
I don't see anything!

595
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:47,407
They got to be here somewhere.

596
00:38:48,002 --> 00:38:49,848
<i>Colonel Young, this is Rush coming.</i>

597
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:51,703
I read you. Go ahead.

598
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,957
- Checking in.
- <i>Nothing yet.</i>

599
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,521
It's raining pretty hard.

600
00:38:59,276 --> 00:39:01,886
I'm sorry to have to tell you,
we've already lost four people.

601
00:39:03,138 --> 00:39:04,174
Doctors Franklin

602
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:05,850
<i>and Volker,</i>

603
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:08,268
<i>Lieutenant James...</i>

604
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:11,848
And Chloe.

605
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:18,044
Copy that.
Check in again in 10 minutes.

606
00:39:21,615 --> 00:39:22,638
We need you.

607
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:36,221
We need you.

608
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:56,369
Come in, please.

609
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:01,383
Colonel Young, do you read?

610
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:07,948
If you've found this,

611
00:41:08,491 --> 00:41:11,791
it's because a solar flare
interfered with gate travel,

612
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:15,893
and I managed to send this kino
back in time.

613
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:20,072
All right, listen very carefully.

614
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,937
There is a disease

615
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,429
in the water we brought back
from the ice planet.

616
00:41:24,554 --> 00:41:25,654
It is fatal,

617
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,599
and we all drunk it,
but there is hope.

618
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:31,414
There's a creature

619
00:41:31,951 --> 00:41:35,131
that lives on this planet,
lots of them, actually,

620
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:37,230
that could hold the key
to saving you.

621
00:41:37,558 --> 00:41:38,646
In small doses,

622
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,328
their venom actually
cures the disease,

623
00:41:41,453 --> 00:41:43,542
but be very careful.
They're deadly.

624
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,397
<i>They're also nocturnal.
They only come out at night.</i>

625
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:49,656
You can get them during the day
while they're asleep in their nests,

626
00:41:49,781 --> 00:41:51,402
and they're not far from the gate.

627
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:04,401
Come on!

628
00:42:10,148 --> 00:42:12,404
Please believe me.
You don't have much time.

629
00:42:12,682 --> 00:42:13,682
Act now,

630
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:17,673
or you are all going to die.
