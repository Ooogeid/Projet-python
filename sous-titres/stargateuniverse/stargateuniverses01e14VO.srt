1
00:00:00,427 --> 00:00:03,419
This is what Destiny intended
from the moment it entered the system.

2
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:09,050
We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:12,379
The ship came here for a reason.

4
00:00:13,628 --> 00:00:15,675
This ship is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,560
He and young are bumping heads.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,961
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:23,566
We pretend nothing happened.

8
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:26,013
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:26,613 --> 00:00:27,860
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,154
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,298
- I want to see the alien ship.
- Were you just trying to distract me?

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,994
So I wouldn't notice
what Rush was doing?

13
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,987
I knew it was coming,
but I didn't know when.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,360
Navigation, propulsion and many others
have been locked out by a master code,

15
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:46,740
which we have had no luck
in breaking.

16
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,340
This ancient device
is pretty much a death sentence.

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,924
I'm not stopping you, Rush.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,261
Go, sit, be my guest.

19
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,327
Projet-SG (1.00)
www.projet-sg.com

20
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:43,878
Have you seen my glasses?

21
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,270
Bread box.

22
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:53,076
You're up early.

23
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:55,786
- Am I?
- I thought you'd sleep in.

24
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:57,320
I've got things to do.

25
00:01:57,964 --> 00:01:58,868
4:00?

26
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:00,327
What?

27
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,662
Dr. Browning.

28
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:04,248
Oh, that's today, right.

29
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:23,726
Listen...

30
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,044
I won't be able to make it today.

31
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:28,397
- Nicholas...
- Nothing to worry about.

32
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:53,498
Who can tell me the significance
of Shor's algorithm?

33
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,377
It's a quantum algorithm

34
00:02:57,502 --> 00:02:59,595
used for integer factorization.

35
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,765
It's important
because it can, in theory,

36
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,360
be used to break the widely used
public-key cryptography scheme

37
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,685
known as RSA.

38
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,718
RSA is based on the assumption

39
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:11,565
that factoring large numbers

40
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,871
is computationally infeasible.

41
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,032
This assumption is valid
for classical computers.

42
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:18,970
No classical algorithm is known

43
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:21,562
that can factor in polynomial time.

44
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,326
Professor Rush?

45
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,754
Very good.

46
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:41,637
- What are you doing here?
- Sorry, not now.

47
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,053
Weren't you taking Gloria
to the oncologist today?

48
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:46,393
- She wanted to go by herself.
- Doesn't sound like her.

49
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,067
- Are you sure she really meant it?
- Oh, yes, quite sure.

50
00:03:49,424 --> 00:03:51,355
I thought you'd be worried sick.

51
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,080
I am. Very concerned.

52
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:16,505
It's back.

53
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:19,049
I had a feeling.

54
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:22,511
You did?
You never said so.

55
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:30,566
I can't go through this again.
I can't.

56
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:36,499
<i>Nick, are you there?</i>

57
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:41,238
Are you coming home?

58
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:53,569
Yes, soon, soon.

59
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,456
- Hi, I'm Dr. Daniel Jackson.
- So you are.

60
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,605
Your office told me
that you hadn't come in for the day.

61
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,211
I don't have time for this.

62
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,006
You're going to want to hear that.
Is there some place we could talk?

63
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,175
You're going to tell me
about the Stargate program.

64
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:27,386
Your current dilemma...

65
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:31,285
How to unlock the Stargate's
ninth and final chevron.

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,070
Specifically,

67
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,558
how much energy will be required.

68
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:37,938
How do you know?
Those details are classified.

69
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,829
The project hasn't even been
named yet, has it?

70
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:43,027
How about "Icarus"?

71
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:47,489
I know
because it's already happened...

72
00:06:49,148 --> 00:06:51,348
And you're just a figment
of my imagination.

73
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:55,539
Reliving all of this
is just a necessary evil,

74
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:58,709
an unfortunate side effect
to a process I can't control,

75
00:06:59,223 --> 00:07:02,055
and it keeps getting in the bloody way
of what I need to do.

76
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,797
You,

77
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,133
the University,
the clouds in the sky,

78
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:08,097
all just a dream,

79
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:09,655
a distant memory,

80
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:13,086
and one I'd really rather went away.

81
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:25,103
What the hell's going on?

82
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,843
His pulse is strong.
BP's elevated, but not dramatically.

83
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,744
He didn't want to
involve anyone else.

84
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:42,472
I am in command of this ship,
and that means

85
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:44,658
you don't do anything
without involving me.

86
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:45,923
Do you understand?

87
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:48,133
What is all this?

88
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,390
We modified the interface.

89
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:53,518
We hope it'll allow us to use the chair
without causing damage to the subject...

90
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:54,515
And?

91
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:57,267
Rush is the first subject.

92
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,520
- Let's wake him up.
- I can't.

93
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,774
Severing the connection is dangerous.
He has to do it himself.

94
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,454
Without me,
Rush still would've done it.

95
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:10,579
Even after
what happened to Franklin?

96
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:13,069
This is the only way
to unlock control of the ship.

97
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,076
The code has to be in the databank.

98
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:18,122
Let's forget about Rush for a second.
If he wants to kill himself, so be it.

99
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:21,708
How do you know this modification
you've made is not going to backfire

100
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,398
put the whole ship in jeopardy?

101
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:24,795
I don't.

102
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,707
How does this new interface work?

103
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:30,468
We created a buffer to slow down
the transfer of information.

104
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:32,735
We also limited the connection

105
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,472
to a narrow range
of the subject's subconscious.

106
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:38,033
That should protect
the vast majority of his brain.

107
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:41,770
In a worst case, we hope only
the memories we targeted could be lost.

108
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,356
If it works,
the data stored in the ship's computer

109
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,221
should be made available to Rush
through a dream.

110
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:49,444
A dream?

111
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,962
A semi-lucid one.

112
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,657
Sort of a stimulated recall
of the memories in question.

113
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,522
How does he wake up?

114
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:57,139
There's a built-in trigger.

115
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:59,125
It should appear to him
as a distinctive door.

116
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,081
He just has to open it
and walk through.

117
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:04,459
He seems stable for now.

118
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,127
Okay, let's say this is working.

119
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:09,464
Do you have any feedback?
Do you know what Rush is doing?

120
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,302
Anything goes wrong,
I'm pulling the plug.

121
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:24,396
Get on a plane. Go.

122
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:26,356
I don't want to go alone.

123
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:28,400
- I'll go with you.
- Thank you.

124
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,571
The truth is,
as much as I'd like to...

125
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:35,347
I don't think I have the strength.

126
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:51,369
My god, Nick...

127
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:53,967
Don't worry.
I haven't lost my mind, not yet, anyway,

128
00:09:55,258 --> 00:09:57,012
but as you can see,
I am rather busy.

129
00:09:57,371 --> 00:10:00,415
Ignoring it isn't helping anyone.

130
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,059
Burying yourself in work this way.

131
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:05,141
- She needs you...
- Thank you for your concern.

132
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:08,106
But I really cannot deal
with any distractions at the moment...

133
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,400
Is that what your dying wife
is to you?

134
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,928
No, of course not.

135
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:13,320
She wants to go home.

136
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,614
One last time.
You should take her.

137
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:20,689
I know you mean well,

138
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:22,173
I really do.

139
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:24,768
But I can't go anywhere.

140
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:26,815
Not now.

141
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,569
Are we okay?

142
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,751
Sure.

143
00:10:56,312 --> 00:10:57,312
Why not?

144
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,243
You chose to sit here by yourself
instead of with me.

145
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:03,578
You looked busy.

146
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,879
I need to know
that we're going to be okay.

147
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,717
I know you think that I betrayed you,
and I'm sorry.

148
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,593
I never meant to hurt you.

149
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:21,888
It will never happen again.

150
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,016
Your friendship
means too much to me.

151
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:34,985
Never a dull moment.

152
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,530
Shall we see where we are now?

153
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:44,828
- What do we got?
- Take a look.

154
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:50,876
- Are those buildings?
- Were.

155
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:53,337
They look like ruins.

156
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,609
It's the first sign of civilization
on a planet.

157
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:57,507
- Human?
- No signs of any life.

158
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,129
We should go check it out.

159
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:01,470
Six hours.

160
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:02,929
You guys gear up.

161
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:06,475
- I'd like to go.
- Me too.

162
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:11,980
Chloe has been studying
all of Dr. Jackson's work.

163
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:13,231
Really?

164
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,609
- You have?
- Say something archeological.

165
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:17,189
Stratification.

166
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:19,237
- That's good.
- Thank you.

167
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,656
Plus, didn't you say
you took ancient history?

168
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,450
- I did.
- At Harvard.

169
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,953
I don't see how that helps us billions
of light-years from earth, but I get it.

170
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,693
I'm pretty sure we've established
this ship is no safer than any planet.

171
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:32,542
Kidnapped by aliens, right here.

172
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,378
I don't have a problem
with you going.

173
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,879
I never said I did.

174
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:39,299
Just be careful.

175
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:48,825
Every code that's ever been cracked,

176
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:52,853
every cipher
in the last two millennia

177
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,274
has been based on those
that came before them.

178
00:12:56,935 --> 00:13:00,821
This code, however, is so old
there may be no known predecessor.

179
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,614
A proto-encryption?

180
00:13:02,988 --> 00:13:03,865
Exactly.

181
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:07,285
How do we attack it
with no basis, then?

182
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:11,243
None of you?

183
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,334
Nothing?

184
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:16,968
None of you see any pattern in this?

185
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:21,253
So, what good are you lot, then?

186
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:24,678
- Why are you here?
- I've never even seen those symbols...

187
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,046
Yes, you have!

188
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,390
You have, because I have,
and you are all me!

189
00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:37,357
Get out!
All of you just get out!

190
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:48,122
It's not their fault.

191
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:52,918
I know.

192
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:57,047
I'm the one who can't solve it.

193
00:13:57,893 --> 00:14:00,464
Despite the fact
it's right in front of me.

194
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:03,425
Have you given any thought
to what we talked about?

195
00:14:06,285 --> 00:14:08,763
- I'm going to fail at that, too.
- I'm sorry?

196
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,475
Solving the issues
of dialing the ninth chevron.

197
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,581
I'll devote two and a half years
of my life to that.

198
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,719
Meanwhile, my wife...

199
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:19,233
is going to spend
her dying days alone

200
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:23,153
while I'm off, out,
trying to solve that little problem...

201
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:27,532
And then some kid,

202
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,130
some big child

203
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,341
with no meaningful education

204
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:34,048
is going to jump in
at the last moment...

205
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:36,191
And solve it,

206
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:37,900
just like that.

207
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:40,086
No sense of ambition.

208
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:43,733
He spends most of his time
playing ridiculous games,

209
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:46,828
and yet he's the genius
I'll never be.

210
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:51,973
He's the one who should be here now,

211
00:14:53,107 --> 00:14:54,476
seeing what I'm seeing.

212
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,231
Look...

213
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,664
Obviously you're not yourself
right now.

214
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:02,317
I do understand what it is
you're going through.

215
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,902
Yeah, I know.

216
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:05,028
I lost my wife.

217
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:09,937
I could do nothing to save her.
It's a terrible, helpless feeling.

218
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:17,348
Yeah, my wife's not the answer.

219
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:20,362
Data does come quicker
when I'm with her,

220
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,504
but it's not gonna help me
if I can't interpret it.

221
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,367
There's patterns
I'm just not seeing.

222
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,762
I'm just saying if you need time,
take it, be with her.

223
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,559
That's more important right now.
That's more important than anything.

224
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,783
Thanks, you've been really helpful.

225
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,042
Your nose is bleeding.

226
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:02,419
The kino really couldn't
do this place justice.

227
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,052
It's pretty incredible.

228
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:05,472
Awesome.

229
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,841
It doesn't look like anybody's
been here for a long, long time.

230
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,392
We have about six hours
to figure out what happened.

231
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:22,319
Let's look around.

232
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:30,857
Progress?

233
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:33,332
His nose was bleeding.
It's stopped now.

234
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,292
What does that mean?

235
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:37,920
I don't know exactly,
but it can't be good for him,

236
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:39,920
the way this thing
messes with the brain.

237
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:41,854
His heart rate and BP
have been fluctuating.

238
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:44,198
- You said he was stable.
- I said, "for the moment."

239
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:45,829
That was over an hour ago.

240
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:51,254
No way at all to tell
if he's having any success?

241
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:54,138
All I'm able to monitor is the rate
the data's flowing into his mind,

242
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,106
and that's been fluctuating as well.

243
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:58,350
What are the odds that yanking him
will kill him?

244
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:04,064
I wouldn't even hazard a guess.

245
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:16,042
I've spent most of the last 20 years
watching what I ate,

246
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:19,937
denying myself
the things I most loved,

247
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:21,915
and now,

248
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:27,379
I could eat anything I want,
and nothing seems appealing.

249
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:37,138
Why are you here, Nick?

250
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,100
Because this is what happened.

251
00:17:43,877 --> 00:17:45,689
You have work to do.
Go and do it.

252
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,141
I am doing it.

253
00:17:47,606 --> 00:17:49,442
It doesn't seem to matter
where I am.

254
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:53,882
You have the chance
to change so many things.

255
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:58,785
The one thing you can't change
is what's happening to me.

256
00:18:02,423 --> 00:18:03,832
Don't let that hold you back.

257
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:23,060
When the time comes,
I know you'll be there.

258
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,359
Okay, every time I turn,
I see another wall...

259
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:45,232
So what do you think that means?

260
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,727
What do you got, buddy?

261
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:49,662
Well, it's pretty cool.

262
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:53,403
Looks like a network
of underground tunnels.

263
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:54,758
We should check it out.

264
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:55,759
Why?

265
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,834
- Don't you want to know who lived here?
- How does that help us?

266
00:19:01,132 --> 00:19:03,341
So far destiny
has stopped on planets

267
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:05,435
that had something
on them that we need.

268
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,187
It's not always gonna be the case...

269
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,730
You see anything on the kino?

270
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:10,945
But we...

271
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,444
What could possibly be down there
that we would need?

272
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:15,995
I don't know.

273
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:18,865
How about a power source
capable of dialing back to Earth?

274
00:19:19,227 --> 00:19:20,033
Come on.

275
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,035
- You never know.
- They don't seem advanced.

276
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,644
Actually, many advanced
alien civilizations

277
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:27,957
found in the Milky Way
and Pegasus galaxies

278
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,473
lived in what appeared to be
primitive stone architecture

279
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:33,338
that concealed extremely
powerful technology.

280
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:39,803
I admit that was a big nerd moment,
but it's true, isn't it?

281
00:19:40,103 --> 00:19:42,806
All right, you got the kino footage.
Let's go.

282
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,432
Yeah, that's the thing.

283
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,393
We don't have

284
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,145
the kino footage.

285
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:51,272
What do you mean?

286
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:54,776
It's a bit of a maze...

287
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:56,335
You lost it?

288
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,696
I took a wrong turn
trying to steer it out.

289
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,657
I just need to take a look
and get my bearings.

290
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:04,982
The footage may be important.

291
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:14,087
I'm going to stay up here
and cover your backs.

292
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:15,964
Are you scared?

293
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:25,098
That was a joke.

294
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,714
I'm sorry,

295
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,354
I must have mistakenly thought
we were on that level now.

296
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:35,822
You know, friends
who can kid each other like that?

297
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,737
- Don't kill me.
- Come on, you can take up the rear.

298
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,030
We won't go far.

299
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:50,373
What's his problem?

300
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:52,807
I didn't think anything scared him.

301
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:54,627
He's a little claustrophobic.

302
00:21:27,237 --> 00:21:28,589
I need to sit down.

303
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,753
"God is our refuge

304
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:21,139
"and strength,

305
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:24,575
"a very present help in trouble.

306
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:26,847
"Therefore we shall not fear,

307
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,174
"though the Earth be removed,

308
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,643
"though the mountains be carried
into the midst of the sea,

309
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,870
"though its waters roar
and be troubled,

310
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:42,000
"though the mountains shake
at the swelling thereof.

311
00:22:43,673 --> 00:22:44,857
"There is a river,

312
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:49,484
"the streams whereof
make glad the city of God,

313
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:52,453
- "the holy habitation of the most..."
- I want you to practice, okay?

314
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,642
... "God is in the midst of her.

315
00:22:56,987 --> 00:22:58,747
"She will not be moved.

316
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:04,007
"God will help her

317
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:07,020
"when the morning dawns."

318
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:54,739
- What was that?
- Probably wind.

319
00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:57,393
Anyone else think we've seen enough?

320
00:23:59,113 --> 00:24:00,772
Weren't you hoping for dead bodies?

321
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,767
Some evidence of human
skeletal remains, actually,

322
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:05,736
and there don't seem to be any.

323
00:24:07,891 --> 00:24:09,322
Oh, God, get it off!

324
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,313
Get it off!

325
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:12,438
Get off!

326
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,536
That's it.
I am out of here!

327
00:24:18,913 --> 00:24:20,362
Good idea. Let's go.

328
00:24:24,164 --> 00:24:24,962
Why?

329
00:24:28,332 --> 00:24:29,175
Don't move.

330
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,112
Oh, my god, what?
What is it?

331
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:35,643
Run.

332
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:51,489
I think you got it.

333
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,139
Do you read?

334
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:06,629
Lieutenant Scott,
Sergeant Greer, come in.

335
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:08,800
<i>This is Scott, sir.</i>

336
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,924
<i>I'm glad to hear your voice, sir.</i>

337
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:11,843
<i>We are...</i>

338
00:25:12,365 --> 00:25:14,109
<i>in a bit of a pickle down here.</i>

339
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:15,178
What's that?

340
00:25:15,488 --> 00:25:18,346
We are trapped
in an underground tunnel.

341
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:20,741
We were exploring the ruins.

342
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:23,366
Sergeant Greer was forced
to fire his weapon.

343
00:25:24,242 --> 00:25:25,523
The tunnel collapsed on us.

344
00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:27,764
<i>No one is hurt.</i>

345
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:30,542
<i>Eli and Chloe are looking
for another way out,</i>

346
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:32,024
<i>but if they can't find one,</i>

347
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:34,198
<i>we're going to need help
getting out of here, sir.</i>

348
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,535
Why was Sergeant Greer
forced to use his weapon?

349
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:41,956
There was a spider, sir.
It was approaching Chloe.

350
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:43,875
A spider?

351
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:46,794
It was a sizable spider, sir.

352
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:49,463
I'll send a team.

353
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:51,678
Young out.

354
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:54,677
Less than two hours
before we jump into FTL.

355
00:25:58,118 --> 00:25:59,302
This is my fault.

356
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:01,998
We shouldn't have come down here.

357
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:07,815
So, the good news is,

358
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,947
we haven't run
into any more spiders.

359
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:12,418
Did you find the kino?

360
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:14,741
Unfortunately,
these tunnels seem to go on forever.

361
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:18,242
We haven't found any other sort
of exit or access to ground level.

362
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:19,599
We heard wind howling.

363
00:26:21,836 --> 00:26:23,302
That's what you said it was.

364
00:26:23,427 --> 00:26:25,901
Me, I'm already having
trouble breathing.

365
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:28,180
- There's air down here.
- My heart rate is very high.

366
00:26:28,723 --> 00:26:30,050
Slightly dizzy.

367
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:34,008
All right, calm down. There's got to be
more than one way in and out of here.

368
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:37,202
I take it the digging
is not going well.

369
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:40,551
We got C-4.

370
00:26:40,676 --> 00:26:43,163
That's not going to do anything
but make this worse.

371
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:46,242
Colonel Young just radioed
through the Gate.

372
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:47,739
They're sending a rescue team.

373
00:26:49,306 --> 00:26:50,816
And what are they going to do?

374
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:58,157
Do you read?

375
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,119
We hear you.
Where are you?

376
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,413
We just found the tunnel entrance.

377
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,706
Is everyone okay?

378
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:06,880
We're fine.

379
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:08,005
Look...

380
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,899
How bad is it?

381
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:14,423
I'm not going to lie to you.
It does not look good.

382
00:27:15,818 --> 00:27:17,385
We're going to get you out of there.

383
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:19,384
Let's get to work!

384
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,010
I'm sorry,

385
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:01,041
I rang the bell several times,

386
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,566
the door was open.

387
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:07,977
Your nose is bleeding again.

388
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,047
I've got great news. Our source inside
the Lucian Alliance has come through.

389
00:28:13,172 --> 00:28:16,444
We've got the location of a planet
that might suit our power requirements.

390
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,149
That's terrific.

391
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:21,774
I'd though you'd be more excited.

392
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:25,950
It's going to take some doing.
There's a mining outpost...

393
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,371
Jackson, do you understand anything

394
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:30,487
on that board?

395
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,547
No, not really.
Why? Should I?

396
00:28:38,704 --> 00:28:39,954
I don't either.

397
00:28:40,657 --> 00:28:43,471
I didn't expect it
to just present itself.

398
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,639
Why should it?
It's a code.

399
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:47,516
It's meant to be hidden.

400
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:49,352
Code for what?

401
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:52,271
Destiny.

402
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:58,486
This is all information
stored in her memory banks.

403
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,354
At least I suspect,
a small fraction of it.

404
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,619
All completely meaningless to me
in this form without context.

405
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,187
And unfortunately,

406
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:11,826
I don't think staying here any longer
is going to make it much clearer.

407
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:16,045
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yep. I'm done.

408
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,863
How is your wife doing?

409
00:29:26,157 --> 00:29:27,257
She's dying.

410
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:30,393
Today, actually.

411
00:29:31,348 --> 00:29:32,748
I really am sorry.

412
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,429
Yes, so am I.

413
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,069
Shouldn't you be with her?

414
00:29:43,189 --> 00:29:44,657
You keep saying that.

415
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,492
Yeah, it's true, isn't it?

416
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:51,622
What's the date today?

417
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,791
You say your wife is going to die today
but you...

418
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,876
No, please, just tell me.

419
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:57,586
April, 6th.

420
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:00,881
April the 6th...

421
00:30:05,143 --> 00:30:08,222
She's taken a turn for the worse.
The doctors say the situation's grave.

422
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,038
They don't think she's going to make it
for the day, thank you.

423
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,030
April, 6.

424
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:26,490
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

425
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,660
But Gloria didn't die on April 6.

426
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,586
Well, it's not the ultimate answer
to life, to universe and everything,

427
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,034
that's 42.

428
00:30:41,316 --> 00:30:43,966
- Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.
- Thank you, you've been very helpful.

429
00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:59,319
The address of this house
is number 4,

430
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,733
not 46.

431
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:04,570
Why does it say 46 on the door?

432
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:08,616
Well, 46 divided by 2 is 23.

433
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:12,119
I'm sure
you've heard of the 23 enigma.

434
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,493
Yeah,
it refers to some ridiculous notion

435
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:16,969
that everything and anything
is connected to the number 23.

436
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:19,210
Most rational people
acknowledge the enigma is evidence

437
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,292
of the mind's power to perceive truth
in almost anything.

438
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:24,518
Yeah, if you look for it,

439
00:31:25,225 --> 00:31:26,342
you're gonna find it.

440
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,727
So, what is this?

441
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,026
Is this my mind playing tricks?

442
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,415
Am I seeing something
that's not there?

443
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,489
Convincing myself this is somehow

444
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,429
significant.

445
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,126
Lieutenant James
this is Colonel Young, come in.

446
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,728
I wish I had a better news
for you, sir.

447
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:09,753
We're doing the best we can,

448
00:32:10,318 --> 00:32:12,304
but things are pretty slow-moving.

449
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,903
<i>You're running out of time.</i>

450
00:32:14,028 --> 00:32:15,613
<i>Yes, sir. We know.</i>

451
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:17,685
Can I panic now?

452
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:23,023
We've got less than half an hour.
We're not gonna make it.

453
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,360
Seriously, what are we gonna do?

454
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,786
Sir, he just suffered
from some sort of cardiac event.

455
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,412
He seems somewhat stabilized,

456
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,813
but I don't know
of much more of this he can take.

457
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:40,583
Leaving him in there
is gonna kill him?

458
00:32:41,591 --> 00:32:42,891
I think so, sir.

459
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:44,962
It's a matter of time.

460
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,386
And you say plugging him out
can kill him too.

461
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,942
I advised against it, but maybe
the risk is better than the certainty.

462
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:53,104
Things are not going well
on the planet.

463
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:54,972
We won't have enough time
to dig them out.

464
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,558
However,
if Rush can find the master code,

465
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,955
we may be able to stall
Destiny's jump into FTL.

466
00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:03,286
We risk sacrificing Rush.

467
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:05,858
According to you, he's chosen
to stay connected to that chair.

468
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,860
He may not be aware
of the danger he's in.

469
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:11,739
If we jump to FTL,
Eli, Scott, Greer and Chloe

470
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,568
are gonna be left behind.

471
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:15,909
So right now,
looks like their best chance is Rush.

472
00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:30,516
We couldn't find any other access.

473
00:33:32,735 --> 00:33:34,053
Maybe it's time we made one.

474
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,724
<i>Lieutenant,
we're running out of time.</i>

475
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:39,704
We know.

476
00:33:40,004 --> 00:33:43,554
<i>We're going to use C-4 to try and blow
a hole in the top of the tunnel.</i>

477
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,440
How far back are you
from the collapsed opening?

478
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:49,777
Not far.
About 10 meters.

479
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,446
Move as far back as you can,
and let me know when you're clear.

480
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:53,614
Copy that.

481
00:33:54,551 --> 00:33:55,556
Let's go, guys.

482
00:34:01,595 --> 00:34:03,666
- Good?
- We'll see.

483
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,251
We're ready.

484
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:08,671
Hopefully, we're clear down here.

485
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,842
Fire in the hole!

486
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,859
- <i>Lieutenant, do you read?</i>
- Yeah, we're still here.

487
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:33,821
Doesn't look like that had
the desired effect.

488
00:34:34,314 --> 00:34:35,314
No, sir.

489
00:34:36,387 --> 00:34:38,197
We just made things a lot worse.

490
00:34:41,072 --> 00:34:41,912
I'm sorry.

491
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,707
No, it's not your fault, Lt.
You did the best you could.

492
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,444
Get your team back to the ship.

493
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:50,963
Sir, we still have time...

494
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,047
Not much.

495
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:55,134
That was an order, lieutenant.
Go.

496
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:38,218
You're not here for me.

497
00:35:40,286 --> 00:35:41,991
I've already been through this.

498
00:35:43,061 --> 00:35:44,361
No, you haven't.

499
00:35:44,762 --> 00:35:45,934
Not really.

500
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,237
I was here.

501
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,074
You can't lie to yourself.

502
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,911
You chose this memory

503
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:58,614
because it's one
you'd rather just forget.

504
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:07,122
What you need is here now.

505
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:08,897
That's why you're here.

506
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,350
It's not for me.

507
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:14,481
You just want your answer.

508
00:36:17,284 --> 00:36:18,927
I need an answer.

509
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:22,145
You're dying.

510
00:36:24,745 --> 00:36:25,525
I know.

511
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,500
You'd rather die than fail?

512
00:36:30,142 --> 00:36:32,192
What have you become, Nicholas?

513
00:36:35,332 --> 00:36:36,982
The things you've done,

514
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:39,613
it's not who you are.

515
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:40,931
It's not you.

516
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:44,076
I always had it in me...

517
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:50,216
To make the hard decisions.

518
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:53,383
I have reasons.

519
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:57,756
Good reasons.

520
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,369
To hurt people?

521
00:37:00,753 --> 00:37:01,903
Are you sure?

522
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:07,516
You tell yourself
my death gave you courage.

523
00:37:10,244 --> 00:37:12,244
In truth, it made you callous.

524
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,983
You're not the man I loved.

525
00:37:18,394 --> 00:37:19,744
He died with you.

526
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,691
I was never your conscience,
Nicholas.

527
00:37:24,913 --> 00:37:28,159
You still have one of your own.
You just need to listen to it.

528
00:37:30,826 --> 00:37:33,026
Some people live their whole lives

529
00:37:34,187 --> 00:37:35,711
and never find what we had.

530
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:41,244
Don't let what happened to me
change you this way.

531
00:37:41,766 --> 00:37:43,266
It's nobody's fault.

532
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,870
I know...

533
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:52,624
I know that.

534
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,230
It's one stupid gene.

535
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:57,614
Passed on to me by my mother,

536
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:03,299
incapable of performing
its one simple function,

537
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:05,978
to repair damaged DNA.

538
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,954
That's it, isn't it?
That's why you're here.

539
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:14,918
Of course.

540
00:38:16,825 --> 00:38:17,825
Go.

541
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,505
I know how much you loved me.

542
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:35,312
Stop taking it out on everyone else.

543
00:38:37,116 --> 00:38:39,316
I haven't forgotten you, Gloria...

544
00:38:42,272 --> 00:38:43,622
And I never will.

545
00:38:56,243 --> 00:38:57,125
Listen to me.

546
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,170
We got five minutes to stop this ship
from jumping into FTL.

547
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,048
Peoples' lives are depending on it.

548
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,550
I can't...
I can't do that.

549
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,678
I can't do that...

550
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:09,763
I can't do anything about that...

551
00:39:14,641 --> 00:39:16,841
Lieutenant Scott, can you hear me?

552
00:39:19,253 --> 00:39:20,603
We can't stop it.

553
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,916
Understood, sir.

554
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:33,495
God be with you.

555
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:35,958
<i>All of you.</i>

556
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,086
It's not over, son.
Don't give up.

557
00:40:14,985 --> 00:40:16,335
They just jumped.

558
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:30,338
What are you doing
out of the infirmary?

559
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:31,869
I got work to do, Colonel.

560
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:35,557
How about solving the access code
to turn this ship around?

561
00:40:37,205 --> 00:40:38,555
Funnily enough...

562
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,855
- I thought you didn't find anything.
- I didn't say that.

563
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,441
I said I couldn't stop the ship
then and there.

564
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,193
Even though it nearly killed me,

565
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:48,400
I managed to find a clue

566
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:51,323
which may give us
control of this ship once and for all.

567
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:52,971
A clue?

568
00:40:53,096 --> 00:40:54,096
46.

569
00:40:55,073 --> 00:40:56,818
That seems a little too simple.

570
00:40:56,943 --> 00:40:59,664
It's the number of chromosomes
in human DNA.

571
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:01,796
- Genetic code.
- This helps us how?

572
00:41:01,921 --> 00:41:03,085
We know in other cases,

573
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,827
with their later technologies,
that the Ancients used

574
00:41:05,952 --> 00:41:07,952
sensors that restricted access

575
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,342
by detecting specific
genetic markers.

576
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,526
The access code to the Destiny
is not like that.

577
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:14,221
It's definitely numerological.

578
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,389
The problem we've had
is that we had no basis,

579
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,518
- nowhere to start.
- We were taking shots in the dark.

580
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,895
- And now?
- Now we know where to start.

581
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,758
They used their own genetic code,
likely a specific one.

582
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:27,215
More evolved than ours, no doubt,

583
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,511
but all we have to do now
is run through the variations.

584
00:41:29,636 --> 00:41:31,822
We're still talking about
billions of possibilities here.

585
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,199
I've written a program
which is going to

586
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,267
go through the permutations.

587
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:38,829
So how long?

588
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:40,372
Several days.

589
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,631
Really?

590
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:44,835
- Or several years...
- I was being a bit more optimistic.

591
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,947
That's a little different for you.

592
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:52,801
All this, this was...

593
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,914
worth risking your life for?

594
00:41:56,744 --> 00:41:57,744
We'll see.
