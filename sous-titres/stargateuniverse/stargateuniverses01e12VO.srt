1
00:00:00,185 --> 00:00:03,252
This is what Destiny intended
from the moment it entered the system.

2
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:08,924
We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,136
This ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:13,374 --> 00:00:15,524
Destiny is
powered by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:18,893
He and Young are bumping heads.

6
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,847
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:23,524
Let's pretend nothing happened.

8
00:00:23,795 --> 00:00:25,945
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:28,386
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,717 --> 00:00:30,029
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,158
I'm curious
about the incident with Dr. Rush.

12
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:37,370
I managed to activate the systems
on the crashed ship.

13
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,935
Aliens showed up.

14
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:40,247
Do not engage.

15
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:42,200
Chloe is on those ships.

16
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:44,288
They didn't want to destroy us.

17
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:46,349
What they really want is Destiny.

18
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,169
Another nightmare?

19
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:54,787
Every time I close my eyes.

20
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:58,347
Maybe you should talk to T.J.

21
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,251
It's not the dream, it's...

22
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:02,376
What?

23
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:07,192
Look, you're...

24
00:03:08,644 --> 00:03:10,272
They're gone, okay?

25
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:12,959
We got you back, you're safe now.

26
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,881
So, move on?
Get over it, right?

27
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:18,447
That's not what I'm saying.

28
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,656
Forget it.

29
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,447
I want to help you.

30
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:25,487
It's fine.

31
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:28,178
I just need to clear my head.

32
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:46,405
Same dream?

33
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,125
Me too.

34
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:56,462
What did they do to us?

35
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:59,514
I don't remember everything.

36
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:01,959
Yeah, me neither.

37
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:05,411
Maybe that's a good thing.

38
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:12,251
Everyone thinks we're safe.

39
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:15,464
They think that
they'll never find us again.

40
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:19,702
We're not safe, are we?

41
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:36,442
Projet-SG (1.00)

42
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:45,242
We need to talk.

43
00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:47,947
I was thinking the same thing.

44
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:49,925
Were you, now?

45
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:52,784
The communication stones.

46
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:57,463
- What about them?
- You took one.

47
00:04:57,773 --> 00:04:59,332
It's the only explanation.

48
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:02,343
You were the first to open the box.
You kept one for yourself.

49
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:04,486
And why would I do that?

50
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,640
Maybe you thought it was some kind
of insurance policy.

51
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:10,111
You thought it wasn't safe
to keep in your room,

52
00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:12,770
especially after that whole incident
with Spencer's gun.

53
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,310
So you kept one with you.

54
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,818
That's how the aliens got hold of one,
and that's how I wound up on that ship.

55
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,450
Doesn't sound like a denial, Rush.

56
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,328
We should really be worried about
how they found us.

57
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,080
They tracked the stone...

58
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,999
- We don't even know how that works.
- Maybe they're smarter than us?

59
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,709
They're advanced, sure,

60
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:38,045
but not as advanced as the Ancients.

61
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,673
I suspect it's something
much simpler.

62
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:43,317
- Like what?
- Subspace tracking device.

63
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:46,040
We took care of the ship
you brought over.

64
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:48,375
But there may be another one...

65
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,349
Attached to the outside of the hull.

66
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:53,122
Where is this coming from?

67
00:05:54,117 --> 00:05:56,362
I was in direct neural contact
with one of the aliens

68
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:57,731
for quite some time.

69
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,669
Ever since, I've been having...

70
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,236
Flashes.

71
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:03,404
Images.

72
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,822
Of what?

73
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:09,603
You don't know?

74
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,862
I don't know, but what I do know is,

75
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:15,340
they've been tracking this ship
for some time before we got here.

76
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:17,093
For them,

77
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:19,795
Destiny's something like
an obsession.

78
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,519
Look, we're out of FTL,
will be for several hours.

79
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,705
Now's the perfect time
to take a look.

80
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:46,569
Kino's through.

81
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:51,744
Mr. Brody,

82
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,371
please dial back
the tensile strength of the shield.

83
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,670
Roger that.

84
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:23,484
You know, it's a big ship.

85
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:26,737
- This could take a while.
- You have something better to do?

86
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,060
Keep me posted.

87
00:07:46,826 --> 00:07:48,680
Can I have a word with you, Colonel?

88
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:49,809
All right.

89
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,179
Not here.

90
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:05,067
I don't know what happened on the planet
between you and Rush,

91
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,765
maybe I don't want to know.

92
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,001
Spit it out.

93
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:11,573
We never did find out
who put that weapon in your quarters.

94
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:16,512
- There has been some speculation.
- I'll bet.

95
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,414
As far as I'm concerned,

96
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:21,451
we were better off without him.

97
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:24,375
I just want you to know

98
00:08:24,864 --> 00:08:26,357
that whatever happens...

99
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:27,835
<i>Colonel Young, come in.</i>

100
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,092
Go ahead.

101
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,318
We've found it.

102
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,391
It's on the underside of the ship.

103
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:44,519
I fed the kino track
into the shuttle controls,

104
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:47,004
so it should lead you right there.

105
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:57,918
Any time now, Lieutenant.

106
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:07,921
<i>All right, guys,</i>

107
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,091
ship's jumping to FTL
in a little over one hour.

108
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:13,177
That's plenty of time.

109
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:41,178
What is this place?

110
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:43,449
As far as I can tell,

111
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:45,375
it's some kind...

112
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,155
of Ancient research lab.

113
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:50,294
Not exactly ideal for our purposes,

114
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,218
but the level of connectivity
with the ship's main systems

115
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,675
should be adequate.

116
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,306
Do we have to do it now?

117
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:01,016
We'll never get
a better opportunity.

118
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:04,770
You should get your people
in position.

119
00:10:31,495 --> 00:10:32,784
What are you doing here?

120
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:35,145
I want to see the alien ship.

121
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:38,553
You know it's just parked there
to track us.

122
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,597
I know, but I want to see it.

123
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:43,142
Come in.

124
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:48,702
There it is.

125
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:52,693
How long has it been on the ship?

126
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:54,866
Rush says since before we got here,

127
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:57,406
although it's not entirely clear
how he knows.

128
00:10:57,974 --> 00:10:58,974
He knows.

129
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:10,294
Weapons hot...

130
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:13,672
Target locked.

131
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:15,424
Weapons firing.

132
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:35,965
That's it.

133
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,364
They can't get to us anymore.

134
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:45,636
<i>Brody...</i>

135
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,422
<i>Brody, where are you?</i>

136
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:51,788
Hydroponics.

137
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:54,247
<i>All right, stay there. It's on.</i>

138
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:57,432
What, now?

139
00:11:58,139 --> 00:11:59,667
<i>You signed off on this.</i>

140
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:01,442
Yeah, I know. I just...

141
00:12:02,673 --> 00:12:03,674
Stand by.

142
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:07,893
Didn't expect to see you here.

143
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,952
I just wanted to check on
some of the medicinals here.

144
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:13,357
Right, sure.

145
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:18,462
Meet up with you
in about a half an hour.

146
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,895
That was just...

147
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,996
Volker and his...

148
00:12:28,554 --> 00:12:29,692
bridge club.

149
00:12:56,773 --> 00:12:58,151
Docking procedure.

150
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,078
Sir, I'm reading a negative
on the docking clamps.

151
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:17,445
Let's reset.

152
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:23,927
Still negative.

153
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:27,597
Eli, we've got a problem.

154
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,474
The docking clamps will not engage.

155
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:31,810
What?
That's impossible.

156
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,145
Hang on.

157
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:02,085
What the hell?

158
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:08,805
I'm locked out.

159
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,370
What do you mean you're locked out?

160
00:14:15,038 --> 00:14:17,593
<i>Someone's transferring controls
to another station.</i>

161
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,483
I've got nothing.

162
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,890
The door won't open either.

163
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,447
We're jumping to FTL in 8 minutes.

164
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,753
<i>What happens
if the ship's not locked down?</i>

165
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:31,161
The shield won't envelop
the shuttle.

166
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,849
- And what?
- <i>I don't know for sure.</i>

167
00:14:34,017 --> 00:14:35,653
Nothing good, I know that.

168
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:39,920
The shuttle wouldn't go into FTL
with the rest of the ship.

169
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,147
- Which means what?
- <i>I'm not sure,</i>

170
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,133
but I think the shuttle
would be vaporized.

171
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,055
Seven minutes.

172
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,207
All right...

173
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:59,084
Eli, let's...
Let's think this through.

174
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:02,295
You said somebody
was transferring controls?

175
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,758
- That's what it looks like from here.
- <i>Well, can you do something about it?</i>

176
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:08,907
- If I...
- <i>Stay calm.</i>

177
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,262
Take your time.

178
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,452
Five minutes, sir.

179
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:21,013
I'll bet you a buck.

180
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,089
Rush, this is Young.

181
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:25,511
Over.

182
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:34,187
<i>Greer, this is Colonel Young.</i>

183
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:35,350
Go ahead, sir.

184
00:15:35,947 --> 00:15:38,260
Take a detail.
Find Rush now.

185
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:42,899
Four minutes.

186
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:47,769
- Stop it. Stop it now.
- Chloe, we've talked about this...

187
00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:49,931
The shuttle docking clamps
won't engage.

188
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,158
- What?
- You have to stop.

189
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:54,399
- But I can't.
- They're going to die.

190
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:56,246
I can't stop in the middle of this.

191
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,540
- They are going to die!
- Dammit!

192
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:08,235
Eli, this is Dr. Rush, come in.

193
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:12,571
- Go ahead.
- <i>Now, listen carefully.</i>

194
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:15,496
I'm in the process
of transferring access to the computer

195
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,877
away from the control
interface room.

196
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:21,104
<i>Now, there's nothing
you can do to stop that.</i>

197
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,732
All you're doing is slowing it down.

198
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,097
<i>Let me complete the transfer,</i>

199
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:28,278
<i>then I'll lock down
the clamps manually.</i>

200
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:29,904
Don't listen to him.

201
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,545
<i>Keep doing what you're doing.</i>

202
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,150
We're in no man's land here.

203
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:35,702
Neither of us have control.

204
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:38,449
<i>Now, let me finish
before we jump to FTL.</i>

205
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:40,571
Don't do it, Eli.
That is an order.

206
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:42,500
Two minutes, sir.

207
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,883
- What's going on?
- It can't dock and we're about to jump.

208
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,341
I didn't know the transfer
would cause this to happen.

209
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:58,642
- Shut it down.
- I don't have everything yet.

210
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,584
If I stop now,
Eli's going to shut me out,

211
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,021
and our position
will be compromised.

212
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:10,207
- Colonel?
- <i>Negative.</i>

213
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,948
Eli, do not let that man
take over a single system.

214
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,324
He's doing it anyway.

215
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,159
The transfer's almost complete.

216
00:17:17,322 --> 00:17:18,883
I know why you're doing this.

217
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:21,426
I also know you agreed
that nobody should get hurt.

218
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:24,744
We could lose everyone on our side.

219
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:26,169
Shut it down!

220
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:42,435
I got it!

221
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:44,104
I got it!

222
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:54,872
Let's go.

223
00:17:57,413 --> 00:17:58,632
Good work, Eli.

224
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:08,297
So, where do we stand?

225
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,255
How much control do we have?

226
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,048
We're about to find out.

227
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,512
What the hell?

228
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:27,443
Come on.

229
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:47,428
It's Rush. He's sealing off
corridors all over the ship.

230
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,614
Brody, why's your radio turned off?

231
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:04,726
Is there a problem?

232
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:09,819
Sorry.

233
00:19:11,955 --> 00:19:13,568
You weren't supposed
to be down here.

234
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:16,641
Guys, what is it?

235
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:19,388
What's happening?

236
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,818
- Get out of my way.
- Put the gun down.

237
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:28,416
- I'm not going to ask you again.
- Just take it easy.

238
00:19:29,694 --> 00:19:31,252
Airman, what are you doing?

239
00:19:31,694 --> 00:19:34,817
Something's going on, Lieutenant.
We're cut off from the rest of the ship.

240
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,675
I'm trying to report to the Colonel,
but these people won't let me through.

241
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,879
I'm sorry.

242
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:42,305
It was inevitable a few people would
be stuck on the wrong side of the line.

243
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:46,194
What line?

244
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,187
We've sealed off Colonel Young
and most of the military personnel.

245
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:51,272
To put it bluntly,

246
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,863
we've taken the ship.

247
00:19:57,085 --> 00:19:58,944
Put the gun down.

248
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:00,240
Not a chance.

249
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:05,169
Why you doing this?

250
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,539
Colonel Young's actions
left me no choice.

251
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,251
I'm doing this on behalf
of all the civilians onboard this ship.

252
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,335
What do I do?

253
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:18,842
We're not going to go shoot anybody.
Put the gun down.

254
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:25,509
Now, everyone just
needs to remain calm.

255
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:27,350
This will be over soon enough.

256
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:35,441
Rush, this is Young.

257
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,402
<i>I know exactly what you're trying to do,
and there is no way in hell</i>

258
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,694
<i>that I am going to let you
get away with it.</i>

259
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,940
I'm not acting alone, Colonel.

260
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,623
<i>Besides,</i>

261
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:46,525
<i>what's done is done.</i>

262
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:49,279
I already have
the food and water supplies,

263
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,083
plus control of all accessible systems
has been transferred

264
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,503
over to the consoles
on my side of the line.

265
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:57,875
What is it?

266
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:02,552
That's not entirely true.

267
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,180
He stopped the transfer prematurely
so I could lock down the shuttle,

268
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,130
which saved your lives,
by the way...

269
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:09,379
Moving on...

270
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,021
That left us control
with one key system...

271
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:14,317
Life support.

272
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:16,652
So you mean that we can
shut down their heat and air

273
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,602
on the other side whenever we want?

274
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:20,679
We wouldn't do that.

275
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,513
Do you have any idea
what's going on here?

276
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:28,272
As a matter of fact, I don't.
Am I the only one?

277
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:30,413
You've got our attention.

278
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,797
<i>What do you want?</i>

279
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:35,569
All military personnel to hand
over their weapons immediately

280
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,103
and submit to civilian authority.

281
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:42,236
Is that it?

282
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:47,092
It does tend to be how civilized people
structure their societies, Colonel,

283
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:51,012
be that as in nations
or in microcosm.

284
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,437
- As opposed to what?
- <i>Military dictatorship.</i>

285
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:56,327
That's got to stop.

286
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:00,693
Well, Eli tells me there might
be a problem with your plan.

287
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:02,987
<i>Something to do with life support.</i>

288
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:10,765
I was hoping
that he wouldn't notice that.

289
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,164
<i>Anyway, I've done the calculations.</i>

290
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,032
We're occupying a much larger area,

291
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:19,212
therefore we have
a greater volume of air.

292
00:22:19,693 --> 00:22:23,012
<i>Plus we have the hydroponics lab
producing some oxygen.</i>

293
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:25,895
Not enough to make a difference.

294
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:29,564
If you cut us off right now,

295
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,975
we'd have at least three days,

296
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,602
<i>which is around about the same amount of
time you would have to go without water.</i>

297
00:22:36,227 --> 00:22:38,320
<i>If it comes down to a contest... </i>

298
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:41,901
I'm not sure
what the final outcome would be,

299
00:22:43,002 --> 00:22:44,638
but it wouldn't be pretty.

300
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:46,364
It's not pretty now.

301
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,066
Sergeant...

302
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:05,764
What did he say?

303
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:07,129
Nothing,

304
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:09,502
but they're still
pumping air in here.

305
00:23:09,627 --> 00:23:12,015
He'll give in.
He's got no choice.

306
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,628
We have the Gate room
and the communication room.

307
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:16,203
He's completely cut off.

308
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:19,939
Yeah, but he still has one thing
that might make a difference.

309
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,941
Come on, buddy, you got this.

310
00:23:27,644 --> 00:23:30,700
It's a very complicated
lock-out program, okay?

311
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,604
I'm going to need some time.

312
00:23:32,772 --> 00:23:34,564
So, I got a head count.

313
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:37,553
Lieutenant Johansen and Airman
Dunning are unaccounted for,

314
00:23:37,678 --> 00:23:40,209
so I think we can assume
that they are on the other side.

315
00:23:40,857 --> 00:23:41,753
Of course,

316
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,338
because someone's on the other side,
doesn't mean they're...

317
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:48,864
- On the other side.
- Obviously not.

318
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:52,722
We've got half a dozen civilians,
all of which claim to know nothing.

319
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:55,618
- What about Chloe?
- She's with them.

320
00:23:58,473 --> 00:24:00,497
- Like I said...
- How's it coming?

321
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:03,261
Slowly,

322
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:05,444
and it doesn't help
that I'm starting to get hungry.

323
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,025
Low blood sugar is not my friend.

324
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,337
It's not the food
that I'm worried about. It's the water.

325
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:11,502
If dehydration sets in,
we'll be in trouble.

326
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:14,202
- Is there anything we can do about it?
- They've offered a trade.

327
00:24:14,564 --> 00:24:18,030
A limited amount of food and water
in exchange for Eli.

328
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:23,920
- Me?
- I've already agreed to it.

329
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:27,252
He's the only one who can get us around
whatever Rush did to those computers.

330
00:24:27,377 --> 00:24:30,502
I know that, and they know that,
and that's why they want Eli,

331
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:32,357
but there is another way in.

332
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,750
All right, guys, I'm here,

333
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:44,447
and as you can see...

334
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:49,022
I am alone.

335
00:24:53,047 --> 00:24:54,198
Open the door.

336
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,831
Irony.

337
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,105
Put it down.

338
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:02,959
Come on.

339
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:17,771
So...

340
00:25:18,814 --> 00:25:19,935
Here we are.

341
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,999
I can't help but notice
that you seem to be,

342
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,461
well, working with these people.

343
00:25:28,855 --> 00:25:30,948
What did you think,
I was a prisoner?

344
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:32,855
I was hoping they...

345
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:36,248
Wait a minute.

346
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,496
In the control room,

347
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,165
when you came by,

348
00:25:43,318 --> 00:25:45,180
were you just trying to distract me?

349
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:47,545
So that I wouldn't notice
what Rush was doing?

350
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:48,462
What?

351
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,623
Don't "what" me...

352
00:25:53,036 --> 00:25:54,311
Of course not.

353
00:25:55,396 --> 00:25:58,191
Look, I knew it was coming,
but I didn't know when.

354
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:05,563
Believe me or don't believe me.
It doesn't matter.

355
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:06,688
I guess...

356
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:09,859
I'm just a little surprised

357
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,987
you're taking Rush's side
against Young.

358
00:26:13,426 --> 00:26:15,251
Rush was an inconvenience,

359
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:18,173
so Colonel Young left him
on that planet to die.

360
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:19,368
Deliberately.

361
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:43,142
The hole the aliens cut in the hull
is on the other side of the line,

362
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,437
on their six.

363
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:45,561
Suit up.

364
00:26:49,248 --> 00:26:51,980
Lieutenant, I already told you,
I want you here

365
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:54,120
in case it doesn't work.

366
00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:11,379
We shouldn't have given food and water.
It's just going to give them more time.

367
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,692
That doesn't matter.
They know they've got no choice.

368
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:15,424
Why don't they just
give it up, then?

369
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:22,463
He's a full bird Colonel
in the United States Air Force.

370
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:25,167
He's used to getting his way,

371
00:27:26,494 --> 00:27:28,020
but he also knows

372
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,722
that every military
in the free world

373
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:34,084
takes orders
from a civilian government.

374
00:27:35,748 --> 00:27:38,781
We just need to stick together
until he remembers that.

375
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:48,424
I'll leave you to it.

376
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,989
To what?

377
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:53,512
Once again,

378
00:27:54,136 --> 00:27:56,299
I find myself
in need of your assistance.

379
00:27:57,374 --> 00:27:59,053
What exactly are you doing?

380
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:02,614
We are going to squeeze
every last ounce of power

381
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,142
out of the ship's systems,
and then when we're done,

382
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:08,381
we're gonna find some more.

383
00:28:09,342 --> 00:28:10,663
What for?

384
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:12,039
The shields.

385
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:14,244
We're going to need them.

386
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,942
The tracking device
was on that ship that we blew up.

387
00:28:37,307 --> 00:28:39,175
One tracking device
was on that ship?

388
00:28:39,812 --> 00:28:41,010
There's another one?

389
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:44,509
Surgically implanted in my chest,

390
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:46,864
next to my heart.

391
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:58,518
<i>Colonel... </i>

392
00:29:03,063 --> 00:29:03,963
<i>we gotta go.</i>

393
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:09,789
This is insane!

394
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,804
Does anyone else know about this?

395
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,087
I had to be sure
she wasn't implanted too.

396
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:17,755
And?

397
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,673
There's no surgical scar.

398
00:29:21,938 --> 00:29:25,096
They're almost within weapons range.
I'm dialing up the shield.

399
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:26,972
Wait!

400
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,266
Maybe...

401
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:33,354
Maybe that's the wrong plan.

402
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:35,356
Maybe we should

403
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,441
throw everything we have
into weapons.

404
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:39,903
We can't take on three ships
at once.

405
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,238
We can't run away either.

406
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,337
That's exactly why
I have to do this.

407
00:29:45,061 --> 00:29:47,487
If we can survive
until the next jump,

408
00:29:48,016 --> 00:29:50,246
they're going to realize
they can't get past the shields,

409
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,339
- and they're gonna give up.
- Don't know that.

410
00:29:52,464 --> 00:29:54,331
That's the way it's been
for a long time.

411
00:29:54,456 --> 00:29:58,129
They attack, they try and get onboard,
the ship's automated defenses.

412
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,317
Stop them.

413
00:30:00,018 --> 00:30:01,413
They're attacking us now

414
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:03,796
because they're hoping
we're going to make a mistake.

415
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,413
Don't!

416
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,306
Eli, do you want to die?

417
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,058
That's what's going to happen.

418
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,726
If you don't let me do this.

419
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:26,574
What's the matter with you?

420
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,280
- Right.
- What?

421
00:30:28,942 --> 00:30:29,952
Sure.

422
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:49,443
You'll open the door
for Scott and his team,

423
00:30:49,568 --> 00:30:50,848
and I'll go find Rush.

424
00:30:54,263 --> 00:30:56,534
I just wanted to see
if there's anything you need.

425
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:58,034
You can let us out of here.

426
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:00,566
Don't worry, you won't 
stay in here for much longer.

427
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,735
Because the Colonel's
going to take back the ship.

428
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,987
You don't have any idea
what you're up against.

429
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,275
I think we do.

430
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:07,698
Not a clue.

431
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:09,937
Sorry, but a bunch of civilians

432
00:31:10,464 --> 00:31:12,867
up against the Colonel's training
and experience?

433
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:14,497
It's about listening to reason.

434
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,290
Not once you took the ship.

435
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,708
That made it war,

436
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:19,569
and that's what we do.

437
00:31:19,955 --> 00:31:22,033
It's not going to make
life on this ship any easier,

438
00:31:22,158 --> 00:31:24,314
it's not going to make
what those aliens did to you.

439
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:26,509
Neither will anything
you could possibly say to me.

440
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:34,607
- What was that?
- They're back.

441
00:31:37,183 --> 00:31:38,660
What's happening?

442
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:40,101
Stay here.

443
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,401
This is Wray. Report.

444
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,519
We've got company.

445
00:31:54,236 --> 00:31:55,246
So I figured.

446
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,497
Let's go.

447
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:01,475
Sergeant?

448
00:32:03,061 --> 00:32:04,088
They're fine.

449
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,506
I went easy on them.

450
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:13,055
That's it.
That's all the power we're going to get.

451
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,000
The shields are holding.

452
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:22,481
Listen up.
If you have to use force, so be it,

453
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,817
but we still have to
live with these people tomorrow.

454
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:26,485
Remember that.

455
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,776
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

456
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:33,659
What is going on?

457
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:35,477
They found us.

458
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,288
How?

459
00:32:43,468 --> 00:32:45,490
We knew this was coming.
We're prepared.

460
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,880
Who's we?

461
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,789
I know Rush is the only person
on this ship

462
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:52,924
who has any idea
what you've been through,

463
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:55,255
but it doesn't mean
that you can trust him.

464
00:32:56,168 --> 00:32:57,363
He saved my life

465
00:32:57,488 --> 00:32:59,680
when Colonel Young was ready
to sacrifice us both.

466
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,270
We can't afford to have

467
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,148
a majority vote every time a decision
needs to be made.

468
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,558
We need a leader.

469
00:33:12,345 --> 00:33:15,284
All right, put the gun down.
You guys okay?

470
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,702
Yeah, we're fine.

471
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,172
Come on, let's go.

472
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,159
You were surgically implanted

473
00:33:28,284 --> 00:33:29,673
with a tracking device.

474
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,537
Is that what this was all about?

475
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:34,666
You thought if Young
was in command he'd what?

476
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:36,355
Throw you out of an airlock?

477
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:38,360
Given my previous experience,

478
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:40,996
it's hardly an unreasonable assumption,
and remember,

479
00:33:41,372 --> 00:33:42,686
this was your idea.

480
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:45,314
Doesn't matter whose idea it was.

481
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,592
It's over.

482
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:54,314
Everybody down, now!

483
00:33:54,964 --> 00:33:56,052
On the floor!

484
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:57,785
Get down!

485
00:33:58,247 --> 00:33:59,745
I said get down!

486
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,080
Wait, wait, wait!

487
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:03,580
Wait.

488
00:34:17,674 --> 00:34:18,847
Get the weapons online.

489
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:21,600
He can't.

490
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,102
Why?

491
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,140
I created a separate lockout code.

492
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:26,521
Give him the code.

493
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:28,221
- We're under attack.
- I know.

494
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:31,527
The best form of defense is to devote
all of our power to the shields.

495
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,007
- Not your decision.
- It's already been done.

496
00:34:34,132 --> 00:34:34,947
Really?

497
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,491
Maybe I should just
shoot you right now.

498
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:52,256
Get 'em out of here.

499
00:34:53,262 --> 00:34:54,061
Wait.

500
00:34:54,229 --> 00:34:55,726
He has a transmitter in his chest.

501
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,509
That's how they've been
following us.

502
00:34:57,634 --> 00:34:59,706
Even if we survive to the next jump,

503
00:35:00,045 --> 00:35:01,767
they'll just track us again.

504
00:35:08,152 --> 00:35:09,481
T.J., take care of it.

505
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,650
What?

506
00:35:12,032 --> 00:35:13,152
Cut it out.

507
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,195
I can't just go digging around
in his chest.

508
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,435
- She's not qualified.
- We'll use the stones.

509
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,908
- We'll get someone...
- We're not equipped. Are you crazy?

510
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:23,748
That we've got to get
that transmitter out.

511
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,873
Sir, I don't recommend giving up

512
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,417
any military personnel
at this particular moment.

513
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,421
I'll do it.

514
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:35,132
I don't need to know what I'm doing.

515
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,925
It won't be me, right?

516
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,126
This is Dr. Brightman.

517
00:35:57,846 --> 00:35:58,859
Thank you.

518
00:35:59,678 --> 00:36:00,908
What did you give him?

519
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,745
An anesthetic I made from the venom
of a creature we ran into a while back.

520
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,821
In low doses,
it'll knock you out pretty good.

521
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:09,333
You gave him alien venom?
Is that safe?

522
00:36:10,196 --> 00:36:12,044
Without it,
we'd all be dead right now.

523
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,298
I thought at first
we were gonna have to go in blind,

524
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,379
but then Eli,
he's one of our people,

525
00:36:19,104 --> 00:36:20,541
came up with this.

526
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,684
It's a camera.
He took it out of a kino.

527
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:25,474
- What's a...?
- It's like a video transmitter.

528
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:28,415
Anyway, we took it apart
and mounted it on that,

529
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,726
and that way,
we can go in arthroscopically.

530
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:36,097
What is that?

531
00:36:37,102 --> 00:36:39,196
- We're under attack.
- What?

532
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,240
Shields are holding.
We're good.

533
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,742
Welcome on board.

534
00:36:49,091 --> 00:36:51,314
- All right, that's it.
- That's it? We got weapons?

535
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:53,613
I found a way around the lock-out,
but I think...

536
00:36:53,738 --> 00:36:54,461
What?

537
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:57,306
I think Rush might be right
about this one.

538
00:36:58,067 --> 00:37:00,377
If I'm reading this correctly,
the shields can't take more.

539
00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:03,993
- All the more reason to shoot back.
- We can't spare the power.

540
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:07,057
Weaken the shields even a little,
and they might collapse completely.

541
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,280
That's what's going
to happen anyway, isn't it?

542
00:37:09,405 --> 00:37:11,209
But maybe, not before we jump.

543
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:12,062
Maybe?

544
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,063
You got something
I can hold this open with? Thank you.

545
00:37:37,236 --> 00:37:38,732
Can you hold that, please?

546
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,215
Thank you.
Hold it up.

547
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:42,374
Thank you.

548
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:08,970
Okay, I see it.

549
00:38:10,923 --> 00:38:13,282
Getting it out's going to be
a bit tricky, but...

550
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:16,293
Are you okay?

551
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,504
Oh, god.

552
00:38:20,027 --> 00:38:21,098
Oh, my god...

553
00:38:22,582 --> 00:38:23,700
Eli, this is Scott.

554
00:38:23,825 --> 00:38:26,351
We just lost the connection.
What the heck is going on down there?

555
00:38:26,476 --> 00:38:28,430
- <i>Say again?</i>
- We've lost the connection.

556
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,946
<i>The doctor is gone.</i>

557
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:34,645
Maybe there's too much interference
with all the enemy fire on the shields?

558
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:35,896
- Fix it.
- What?

559
00:38:36,304 --> 00:38:37,773
I'm guessing as it is!

560
00:38:39,302 --> 00:38:40,943
Sorry, you're on your own.

561
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,819
<i>You get that thing out of him.</i>

562
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,384
Shields aren't gonna last much longer.
There's nothing I can do.

563
00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:47,485
- How long till we jump?
- Just over a minute.

564
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,195
Get that thing out of him,
or I'm gonna have to!

565
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,507
He's coming to!

566
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,582
Hold him down, hold him down!

567
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,043
- Give him a dose of anesthetic.
- What are you doing to me?

568
00:38:59,264 --> 00:39:00,295
Hold him steady.

569
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,041
I can see it.

570
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:13,016
I need you to hold this.

571
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:22,396
There it is.

572
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,823
All right, I got it.

573
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:29,721
Now pull it out.

574
00:39:53,735 --> 00:39:54,558
We got it.

575
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:02,315
Shields are barely registering!

576
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,274
We're jumping!

577
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:27,871
Okay, we can close him up.

578
00:40:27,996 --> 00:40:29,009
Nice work.

579
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:45,025
How'd we do, sir?

580
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,438
The ship's taken some damage.
Eli's looking into it. Anyway...

581
00:40:48,995 --> 00:40:50,238
we're still here.

582
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,411
All right, everyone,

583
00:40:53,562 --> 00:40:56,995
I need all of you to head
back into your quarters now.

584
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:00,837
Everyone.

585
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,627
Sir, we can't guard 'em all
if we let them split up.

586
00:41:04,325 --> 00:41:05,700
It's over, Sergeant.

587
00:41:07,105 --> 00:41:09,290
All right, people,
you heard the man.

588
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,273
Let's go.

589
00:41:40,885 --> 00:41:42,520
I'm open to suggestions.

590
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:45,335
Obviously,
we need to find a way to work together.

591
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:48,004
Pretend it never happened, you mean.

592
00:41:49,872 --> 00:41:51,424
You shouldn't have left him.

593
00:41:53,497 --> 00:41:55,046
You think I don't know that?

594
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:06,565
It's not over, sir.

595
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:09,147
No, it isn't.
