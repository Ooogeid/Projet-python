1
00:00:00,245 --> 00:00:03,252
This is what Destiny intended
from the moment it entered the system.

2
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:08,924
We are going to survive,
we are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:12,400
Ths ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,005
Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:18,351
He and Young are bumping heads.

6
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,910
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:23,600
We pretend nothing happened.

8
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:26,221
We need to be ready for
the next encounter...

9
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:27,735
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,029
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,296
They're coming.

12
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:34,450
Who's coming?

13
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,270
The Lucian alliance,
they want Destiny.

14
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:37,745
They can open the doors!

15
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:41,540
- Take cover!
- Grenade!

16
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,043
Fall back!

17
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:48,297
- You'll be okay.
- What happened?

18
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,366
You were shot.

19
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,928
<i>You are surrounded.
Lay down your weapons</i>

20
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,450
<i>or we will vent
the entire compartment to space.</i>

21
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:55,888
- Can they do it?
- Yes.

22
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,525
Then they should have.

23
00:00:57,995 --> 00:00:58,995
Wait!

24
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:05,525
We will not be complying
with your request to surrender.

25
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:09,110
We have 12 missing
and presumed captured

26
00:01:09,405 --> 00:01:11,112
including Riley, TJ,

27
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:12,490
Chloe and Eli.

28
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:15,866
I'm going to save
every one of those hostages

29
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,100
and I'm going to retake this ship.

30
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:19,775
Do you understand me?

31
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:42,180
We've got the medical supplies
you requested.

32
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:45,250
We are prepared to give them to you
as a show of good faith.

33
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,375
Thank you.

34
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,225
One condition:

35
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:51,405
you and I meet to make the exchange.

36
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,245
Agreed.

37
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,415
Let's do this.

38
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:03,135
Ready.

39
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:13,805
Now, remember:

40
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,175
quick kills, centre mass.

41
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:24,215
All right.

42
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,688
You ready to do this?

43
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:31,901
We're ready.

44
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:37,375
Bring the medic.

45
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:50,377
Open the door.

46
00:02:58,035 --> 00:02:59,035
I'm in.

47
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:18,035
- Who is this?
- Ronald Greer is also a medic.

48
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:21,600
Another offer of good faith?

49
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:23,410
In exchange for Lt. Johansen.

50
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:25,287
First things first.

51
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,225
Go and check the supplies
and see they're what you need.

52
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:54,845
- Hold your fire!
- Don't shoot!

53
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,883
- Power went out throughout the ship.
- I can see that. Please step aside.

54
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,914
- Get behind me.
- She takes one step in your direction,

55
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,625
- and I will shoot her myself.
- I've got the shot, sir.

56
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:23,353
Projet-SG (1.00)
www.projet-sg.com

57
00:04:26,615 --> 00:04:30,390
My men have been ordered
to execute the prisoners if I am killed.

58
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:32,315
Step back in my direction.

59
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:43,616
Sir, I've got the shot.

60
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,334
Stand down, Sergeant.

61
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,395
Damn it!

62
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:04,100
- What happened?
- They surprised us?

63
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:05,575
What do you mean?

64
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,075
They surprised us!
Do you want me to explain it again?

65
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,309
Hostages are useless
if they are dead.

66
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,975
At least they serve a purpose!

67
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,107
Tell them.

68
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:19,205
Tell them.

69
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:27,355
I'm here.

70
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:31,330
She just killed Rivers.

71
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,635
Understood.

72
00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:47,310
Don't fall asleep.

73
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:48,685
It's dangerous.

74
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:50,808
That's a concussion.

75
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,538
It's boring.

76
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,366
So what do you think
they'll do with them?

77
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:10,555
Who?

78
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:12,525
The prisoners.

79
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:15,490
Probably drop them off
on some planet.

80
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:16,765
I don't know.

81
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:20,875
I just hope everyone's okay.

82
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:25,175
I just hope it's over.

83
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,905
Not much we can do about it.

84
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:37,771
Rest time is over.

85
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:45,779
This feels familiar.

86
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:51,035
- What the hell just happened?
- We still don't know.

87
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,210
We're just getting systems
back online.

88
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:55,539
- Maybe we can analyse.
- Screw analyze!

89
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,458
Fix it!

90
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,667
- Got to know what's broken...
- Do it now!

91
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,245
Rivers...

92
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,681
- is dead.
- What?

93
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:17,603
It was going to be someone.

94
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:26,528
Would you prefer
it was Chloe or Eli?

95
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:27,795
Lt. Johansen perhaps?

96
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:30,885
You were thinking the same thing!

97
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:33,110
Figure out what's wrong
with the ship

98
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:34,285
and fix it,

99
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:35,575
fix it now.

100
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:01,313
I have orders to help.

101
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:04,575
What's your name?

102
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:06,725
Koz.

103
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:10,781
I'll let you know what I need.

104
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:31,735
You do know
there is a way to save them.

105
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,640
- You're just not wired to consider it.
- I'm not surrendering this ship.

106
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:40,602
What exactly is so wonderful
about it?

107
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:43,480
We give up, she kills everyone

108
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,630
except for those
who have value to her.

109
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:48,165
And let me tell you,
that's not a hell of a lot of people.

110
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:55,492
- This is Young.
- <i>I'd like to speak to the civilian.</i>

111
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:14,720
Colonel Young has proved that
he cannot be trusted.

112
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:16,615
<i>Can you?</i>

113
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,684
Then why did you let them
plan an ambush?

114
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,812
I voiced my disagreement.

115
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:27,815
<i>And you could not stop them.</i>

116
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:30,525
Obviously not.

117
00:09:30,865 --> 00:09:32,779
<i>For that,
one of your men was killed.</i>

118
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:36,015
If you fail to live up
to your promise twice...

119
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:39,244
I will kill again.

120
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:41,005
<i>Do you understand?</i>

121
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:47,044
No, I don't understand,

122
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:49,195
<i>but I do believe you.</i>

123
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:52,945
Then I would like to take you up
on your initial offer...

124
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:55,552
with one modification:

125
00:09:57,415 --> 00:09:59,615
four of your men for four of ours,

126
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,517
and food and water for three days.

127
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:06,955
Will food and water
be offered to the hostages?

128
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:08,690
They're no good to me dead.

129
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:11,715
Then we're agreed.

130
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:21,870
Next time we take supplies with us
in the first wave.

131
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:23,875
If there is a next time.

132
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:34,841
Damn it!
Flashlight!

133
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,880
- What's happening?
- I don't know,

134
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,355
I'm up to my wrists
in someone's body right now.

135
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:01,159
Do we have any answers yet?

136
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:03,785
Just the one.

137
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:08,375
Every crash has been exactly
46 minutes, 37.4 seconds apart.

138
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:09,575
So?

139
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:11,635
It'll be easier to show you.

140
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:21,013
What am I looking at?

141
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,141
That's our problem.
It's a binary pulsar.

142
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:27,769
It's the combination of
a rotating neutron star and probably

143
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,575
a white dwarf orbiting
around a single point in space.

144
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,774
What does that mean to us?

145
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:37,225
Pulsars give off gamma radiation
and X-rays as they rotate,

146
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,531
short deadly bursts
of ionized radiation.

147
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,575
The shield and the hull
protect us right now.

148
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,286
But the pulsar is literally
feeding off of the white dwarf,

149
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,456
stripping off material
and creating an accretion disc.

150
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,000
White dwarf ploughs through
that material every orbit...

151
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,420
Which gives off
an even bigger gamma ray burst

152
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,585
on top of what
we're already getting hit with.

153
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,140
That's why our systems
are shutting down.

154
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:59,968
The shield has to draw extra power
in order to compensate.

155
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,345
And that happens every 46 minutes

156
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:04,639
37.4 seconds.

157
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,395
It's what's killed that man.

158
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,186
And it's going to be what kills us.

159
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,147
The Lucian Alliance just dialed in
when the damn thing was in range.

160
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:15,579
Destiny had to drop out of FTL
to make the connection.

161
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:19,154
- It's bad timing, bad luck.
- Then why are we still here?

162
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,491
Our FTL capability's been compromised.
Don't yell.

163
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:24,534
We don't know why yet.

164
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,860
The shield is what's keeping us alive.
But sooner or later

165
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:29,435
it's going to fail.

166
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:32,755
- When it does...
- We're dead.

167
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,470
The radiation burst is what's causing
the system malfunctions.

168
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:46,098
Which will only get worse.

169
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,365
Because the shield
will fail eventually, yes.

170
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:53,435
Unless we can find a way
to make the jump to FTL.

171
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:58,026
- How much time?
- <i>According to Rush,</i>

172
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:00,570
we can withstand two more bursts.

173
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:04,157
People will start dying
by the third.

174
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,112
We saw what one of those bursts
did to a man

175
00:13:06,237 --> 00:13:08,215
when he wasn't protected
by the ship's hull.

176
00:13:09,565 --> 00:13:11,365
First we'll make the trade

177
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:14,584
<i>and then we'll discuss
this new problem.</i>

178
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,500
Has their medic
completed Varro's surgery?

179
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,625
Not yet.

180
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:26,125
- Then, find out what's taking so long.
- I'll do it.

181
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,700
She told me
to check on your progress.

182
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:42,320
Tell her it'd be a lot faster
if the lights didn't keep going off.

183
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:44,945
That's a whole other problem.

184
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,242
The Destiny came out of FTL
within range of a pulsar.

185
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:51,455
Time is short
before the shield fails.

186
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:55,167
- Crewman Young and his men are on it...
- She won't let them.

187
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:00,945
I'll do my best to convince her.

188
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,315
You do that.

189
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:22,736
We've got the supplies
that they requested

190
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,830
<i>and we're ready to make
the prisoner exchange.</i>

191
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:25,955
Copy that.

192
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:46,710
I'm fine. I'm fine.

193
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:48,831
And Varro?

194
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:52,186
I've done all I can for him.

195
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:06,642
Will he live?

196
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:08,865
I got the bullet out
and stopped the bleeding

197
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,766
so he should have a chance.

198
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:12,786
I'd like to take a look
at the other wounded.

199
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:17,457
Fine.

200
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,516
Let's go.

201
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,268
You got it?

202
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,140
What's this?

203
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,898
A flak vest...
just in case.

204
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,806
How can I expect them to trust me

205
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:49,454
if I can't even demonstrate
a willingness to trust them in turn?

206
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:51,094
With all due respect, ma'am,

207
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:52,826
I don't think they can be trusted.

208
00:15:58,235 --> 00:16:00,292
You tell Colonel Young
I appreciate his concern.

209
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:04,254
Colonel said you wouldn't take it.
I just thought I'd try.

210
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:14,951
Are you sure about this, sir?

211
00:16:17,705 --> 00:16:19,155
Good enough for me.

212
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:22,731
Hope you make
a better impression than I did.

213
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:40,832
Commander Kiva, are you ready?

214
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:42,334
<i>We are.</i>

215
00:16:43,455 --> 00:16:45,015
Brody, open it.

216
00:16:54,838 --> 00:16:56,942
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

217
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:34,719
I asked for civilians.

218
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:37,013
These are the two we had.

219
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:39,307
We agreed on four for four.

220
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,013
Four.

221
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:02,789
What about Lt. Johansen?

222
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,137
She stays.

223
00:18:04,262 --> 00:18:07,083
Even if we figure out a way
to jump back into FTL...

224
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,837
and right now the odds
are not good...

225
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,725
Then we're right back
where we started.

226
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:15,327
But this doesn't have
to end with one of us losing.

227
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:17,700
If we could just figure out
a way to work with each other...

228
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:21,469
I can see you're someone
who enjoys talking through problems.

229
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:23,865
But if you don't solve this new one

230
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,842
then neither of us will have
anything to talk about.

231
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:56,163
Alright, get in the infirmary.

232
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:01,431
Where's Chloe and Eli?

233
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:04,601
She said they were
the only two civilians.

234
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:09,924
Then where the hell are they?

235
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,253
Now, if we could just...

236
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:22,822
Sorry. Sorry!

237
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:28,475
Take a break, Eli.

238
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:32,485
Have to be getting close by now.

239
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:34,260
You know what?

240
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:36,437
We should do this twice a week.

241
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:39,860
This is the kind of exercise
that really motivates me:

242
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,999
carrying a wounded person
the length of the whole ship

243
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:45,865
in low oxygen.

244
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:47,823
Good times.

245
00:19:49,394 --> 00:19:50,438
Thank you, Eli.

246
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:54,108
Now it's your turn to carry me.

247
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,605
You're an amazing friend.

248
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:02,017
You can never
have too many of those.

249
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:03,372
Unless you're

250
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:06,365
one of those people on Facebook

251
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,758
who just accepts
everybody's friend request.

252
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:17,799
It's like, come on, you know,
be a little selective.

253
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:45,496
Damn it!

254
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,604
Sorry. Sorry!

255
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:52,200
It's okay.

256
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:53,325
Are you okay?

257
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:54,544
I'm okay.

258
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,060
Sorry.

259
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:02,696
Okay, thanks.

260
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:07,899
There's no sign of Eli or Chloe.

261
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:09,017
Maybe they're...

262
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,395
There's no fatalities
on our side except for Rivers.

263
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:14,261
They must be hiding somewhere.

264
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:15,573
I hope so.

265
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:20,270
That boy would take a bullet before
he let them touch a hair on her head.

266
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:23,990
Don't get distracted.

267
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,736
I'm not. I'm not.
I just...

268
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:29,537
I want to get this done with.

269
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,324
And I wish Colonel would give
the word so we can go in there

270
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:34,459
and properly resolve the situation.

271
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,462
Look, he'll do the right thing
when the right time comes.

272
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:39,672
You've got to trust that.

273
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:41,134
100%.

274
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:47,013
I don't know how you do it, man.

275
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:50,599
Then you need to learn.

276
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:02,384
Thank you.

277
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,453
Your commander already
showed her appreciation

278
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:08,993
by not killing me.

279
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,121
It must be difficult to be forced
to save the life of your enemy.

280
00:22:14,243 --> 00:22:15,552
I would have done it anyway.

281
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:18,758
- How's the pain?
- Bearable.

282
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:22,821
- Look, I'm trying to say...
- I don't really care.

283
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:26,386
I've been on my feet for far too long
and I have other patients.

284
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,804
So, excuse me.

285
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,508
Conserving air

286
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,316
or unconscious?

287
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:44,225
Just thinking.

288
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:48,741
About what?

289
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:56,165
I used to think
I had a lot of friends.

290
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:00,633
But I don't.

291
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:05,630
They're a billion light-years away

292
00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:08,428
but they're still your friends.

293
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:11,124
They don't really care about me.

294
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:16,936
And I don't really care
about them either.

295
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:18,305
That's nice.

296
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:21,566
Because until I met you,

297
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:26,237
I didn't really know
what a friend was.

298
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:28,792
Do you know what I mean, Eli?

299
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:35,329
A friend is someone
who will support you no matter what.

300
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:39,959
Like you.

301
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,308
Why don't we...

302
00:23:42,103 --> 00:23:43,326
I am not just saying that

303
00:23:43,451 --> 00:23:45,551
because I feel like
I'm going to pass out.

304
00:23:47,215 --> 00:23:49,510
And even if I do,
I just want to say it first.

305
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:50,883
And you did, so...

306
00:23:51,008 --> 00:23:52,972
Whenever I say
stuff like that to you,

307
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,017
you always react like I've just
awarded you some runner-up prize.

308
00:23:59,324 --> 00:24:00,416
And it's not.

309
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:04,634
Yeah, I know.

310
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:13,379
It's just that...

311
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:15,073
I know.

312
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:21,509
Of course you do.

313
00:24:32,953 --> 00:24:34,555
There's a console over there.

314
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,046
I didn't notice that
when we came in.

315
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:42,334
And it's got power.

316
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:45,191
Can you call for help?

317
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,459
I can try.

318
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:58,204
Dr. Park.

319
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:01,509
Look.

320
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:03,883
It's not much of a solution

321
00:25:04,257 --> 00:25:06,170
but we don't have to shield
the entire ship.

322
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,339
Just the side
facing the pulsar array.

323
00:25:09,104 --> 00:25:11,195
We'll have to leave shielding
on the underside

324
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,302
but we could transfer
something like 90%.

325
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,097
It should buy us enough time
to restore FTL capability.

326
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:19,823
So, why haven't you guys
done it yet?

327
00:25:19,948 --> 00:25:21,894
Because it can't be done
from inside the ship.

328
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,147
It could if we controlled
the core systems, but...

329
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,899
Look, someone is
going to have to go for a walk.

330
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,183
I can tell you where to go,
what to do.

331
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,257
The mechanics of it
are relatively simple.

332
00:25:33,382 --> 00:25:36,000
Then why don't you put on
a spacesuit and do it?

333
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:39,513
Well, you get the FTL drive
back online while I'm gone

334
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:40,797
and you've got a deal.

335
00:25:42,181 --> 00:25:44,147
- We'll get it done, sir.
- I know you will.

336
00:25:44,272 --> 00:25:45,272
Gear up.

337
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,968
<i>They have only the time
between the gamma ray bursts</i>

338
00:25:57,093 --> 00:25:59,007
<i>to complete their work.</i>

339
00:25:59,132 --> 00:26:00,558
<i>The next one</i>

340
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:04,195
is less than 20 minutes from now
so obviously time is an issue.

341
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,731
So what do you need from us?

342
00:26:07,072 --> 00:26:09,069
There's a hull breach
in the access corridor

343
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:11,018
that's under your control.

344
00:26:11,818 --> 00:26:13,863
It's the exit point
closest to the array.

345
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,407
<i>We need you to let us in.</i>

346
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:24,498
Transfer control
of all the ship's systems to us

347
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:27,668
and we will let them in.

348
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:29,837
You do understand

349
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,880
that if you don't help us
save the ship

350
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:35,319
we will all die.

351
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:37,511
<i>I understand completely.</i>

352
00:26:38,445 --> 00:26:41,475
And I want you to transfer
the ship's systems to us.

353
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:52,940
When was the last time you ran
a security sweep in there?

354
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,271
Never mind.
I'll do it. Radio.

355
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:02,674
Calvos, this is Telford.
Give me access to the damaged section.

356
00:27:30,726 --> 00:27:32,380
You tell me.
You think she's bluffing?

357
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:35,566
She doesn't have to.
She knows who she's dealing with.

358
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:38,715
But to be fair,
you don't have much of a choice.

359
00:27:39,627 --> 00:27:42,493
At least they'll keep some of us alive
for a while anyway.

360
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:44,348
Yeah, like you.

361
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,116
You forget I've recently been
in their employment.

362
00:27:47,254 --> 00:27:48,654
I wouldn't envy me just yet.

363
00:27:57,911 --> 00:27:59,423
<i>It's about damn time.</i>

364
00:28:00,318 --> 00:28:01,470
Listen, do it.

365
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,223
Transfer control of the ship
and surrender yourselves.

366
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,498
<i>Everyone but Rush and Brody.</i>

367
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:08,978
<i>Have them retreat to one
of the auxiliary control rooms.</i>

368
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,938
They're gonna notice
Rush is missing.

369
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:15,109
Tell them he panicked and ran away.
They'll be looking for him to late.

370
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:18,949
<i>At the first available opportunity,
I'll access one of the gateroom consoles</i>

371
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,525
<i>and transfer control
of the ship back to Rush.</i>

372
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,118
The second they find out,
they're gonna start shooting prisoners.

373
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,494
They won't find out.

374
00:28:27,045 --> 00:28:28,776
Not right away, anyway.

375
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,553
I won't lock them out completely.

376
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,005
They can have control of the ship
until I decide they can't.

377
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,291
They'll herd all of the prisoners
into one compartment.

378
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:40,843
If they don't, I'll suggest it.

379
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,848
When they do, I'll contact Rush
on this channel,

380
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:46,849
I'll tell him in which compartment
he can vent the atmosphere.

381
00:28:47,648 --> 00:28:48,768
And you?

382
00:28:49,713 --> 00:28:51,812
You let me worry about that.
I got to go.

383
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,835
It's all clear.

384
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:04,819
Best not to stick around.

385
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:09,810
This is Young.

386
00:29:09,935 --> 00:29:12,014
I am prepared to surrender
control of this ship

387
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:14,919
provided certain conditions are met.

388
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:16,796
<i>Go ahead.</i>

389
00:29:17,236 --> 00:29:19,036
I need you to guarantee me

390
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,758
the safety of my people.

391
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,542
<i>Agreed.</i>

392
00:29:22,914 --> 00:29:25,541
Nobody gets hurt
during the changeover,

393
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:27,848
and no retribution afterwards.

394
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:30,603
Anything else?

395
00:29:32,023 --> 00:29:33,023
That's all.

396
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:38,567
Well, Mr. Brody,
time to panic and run off.

397
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,889
Hold on a sec.

398
00:29:40,138 --> 00:29:43,030
We just got a message
from an unexplored part of the ship.

399
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,577
It's Eli. What do we do?

400
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,372
Well, you got to go.
Good luck.

401
00:29:52,745 --> 00:29:53,945
Yeah, you too.

402
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:57,309
Transfer control to them.

403
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:06,373
Anything?

404
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:10,975
I wrote it in ancient,
so it could take a while to...

405
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:17,773
What is it?

406
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:18,983
We got a message.

407
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:20,977
What's it say?

408
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:28,075
We'd better stay put.

409
00:30:31,242 --> 00:30:32,329
Transfer complete.

410
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,581
Open them.

411
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,140
No shooting.
That's a good sign.

412
00:31:53,947 --> 00:31:55,947
I think the stitching is torn.

413
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:58,156
You're moving around too much.

414
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:03,228
I understand your anger
at losing the ship,

415
00:32:03,353 --> 00:32:04,838
but it wasn't yours to begin with.

416
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:09,511
When all this is settled,
sins will have to be forgiven.

417
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:12,867
Truce?

418
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,284
Open them.

419
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:40,040
46 minutes, gentlemen.

420
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,432
They're in.

421
00:32:56,332 --> 00:32:58,183
Attenuating the shield strength.

422
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,481
<i>Dialing back artificial gravity.</i>

423
00:33:32,856 --> 00:33:34,511
A power relay just went down.

424
00:33:54,505 --> 00:33:55,616
Something wrong?

425
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,384
We lost a power relay.

426
00:33:58,905 --> 00:34:00,873
Then why aren't you dealing with it?

427
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:05,042
Go. I can open and close doors.

428
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:57,094
- <i>This is it?</i>
- <i>It's where he said it was going to be.</i>

429
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,962
- What happened?
- The transfers just stopped.

430
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,460
<i>What's the matter?</i>

431
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:03,468
<i>It won't lock.</i>

432
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:10,542
<i>Colonel Young, this is Scott.
How are we doing for time?</i>

433
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,764
14 minutes.

434
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:45,116
This is Calvos.

435
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:47,641
Kiva and Telford
have both been shot.

436
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,584
The commander is still breathing
but unconscious.

437
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:55,003
Get them to the medic.

438
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,171
Yes, sir.

439
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,389
- Any sign of the enemy?
- None.

440
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,472
Where are your men?
How did they get into the gateroom?

441
00:37:06,028 --> 00:37:08,183
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

442
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,436
I've got people outside this ship!

443
00:37:15,492 --> 00:37:17,548
The enemy has somehow
breached our lines.

444
00:37:17,673 --> 00:37:20,073
Both Telford and Kiva
have been shot.

445
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,163
I'm assuming command.

446
00:37:24,196 --> 00:37:27,018
<i>Colonel Young, this is Scott.
Ready to come back in.</i>

447
00:37:27,143 --> 00:37:28,493
<i>Lower the shield.</i>

448
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:33,856
<i>I repeat, this is Scott, over.</i>

449
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,480
<i>The shield is still up.</i>

450
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,471
<i>We cannot get back inside.</i>

451
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,466
They just saved our lives.
Lower the shield.

452
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,760
- Keep moving.
- Lower the damn shield!

453
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:48,495
<i>Lower the shield.</i>

454
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,904
<i>Try a different channel!</i>

455
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,687
<i>This is Scott.
Please respond!</i>

456
00:37:54,948 --> 00:37:56,106
Something's gone wrong.

457
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,940
We have to find you another way.

458
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:00,125
<i>There's no time for that, Rush!</i>

459
00:38:00,641 --> 00:38:02,571
<i>What other way is there?</i>

460
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,411
- An airlock in the forward section.
- We think.

461
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,776
It's in a totally unexplored
part of the ship.

462
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:13,707
Besides, we can't open it from here.

463
00:38:18,522 --> 00:38:20,672
I need you to head back
towards the front of the ship.

464
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,424
<i>Negative, negative!</i>

465
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,009
Listen, that's the way in.

466
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,387
<i>We're looking at
the way in right now.</i>

467
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,307
You need to go there
as quickly as you can.

468
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:38,745
<i>We're on our way.</i>

469
00:38:43,694 --> 00:38:44,905
What's going on?

470
00:38:45,648 --> 00:38:48,079
- I'm getting a message.
- What's it say?

471
00:38:48,258 --> 00:38:50,075
- That I gotta go.
- What do you mean?

472
00:38:50,243 --> 00:38:53,968
I'm telling them where you are,
so you'll be safe until they come.

473
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,409
Where are you going?

474
00:38:58,534 --> 00:39:01,713
Whatever happens, you know, right?

475
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:04,216
You're scaring me.

476
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:07,921
I gotta go.

477
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:28,456
What happened?

478
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:32,828
Come on...

479
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,798
Separate the civilians.

480
00:39:46,747 --> 00:39:48,385
Take them to another compartment.

481
00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:00,313
What are you doing?

482
00:40:00,779 --> 00:40:02,879
I'm going to put an end to this.

483
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,371
<i>Bring their injured soldiers to me.</i>

484
00:40:18,496 --> 00:40:20,459
Not if you expect me
to save your commander.

485
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:54,951
They're not going to make it.
