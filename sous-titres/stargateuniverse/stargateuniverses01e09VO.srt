1
00:00:01,014 --> 00:00:01,995
Destiny...

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,669
The design is clearly ancient,

3
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,388
launched hundreds
of thousands of years ago.

4
00:00:06,513 --> 00:00:07,859
Where the hell are we?

5
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:09,812
Several billion light years
from home.

6
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:10,992
We are on a ship,

7
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:14,106
but we have no idea
where we are in relation to Earth.

8
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:16,982
This ship could be
the most important discovery

9
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:19,178
mankind has made
since the Stargate itself.

10
00:00:19,303 --> 00:00:21,626
These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

11
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:23,631
We've got wounded.
We need to get home.

12
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:26,198
We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

13
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:29,699
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

14
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:33,741
In this case
are five ancient communication stones.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,182
You physically take control
of an individual at the other end.

16
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:41,253
She's not going to have it.
She's 16.

17
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:44,607
We barely even know each other.

18
00:00:45,172 --> 00:00:46,779
If anyone finds this

19
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:49,759
within the next,
I don't know, 40 years,

20
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:52,536
tell Sharon...

21
00:00:56,972 --> 00:00:58,579
My last thoughts were of her.

22
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,020
Your shift's over.

23
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:42,266
- I'm good.
- You need rest.

24
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:45,873
- I've been sitting on my ass for hours.
- General O'Neill's orders.

25
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:05,737
Got plans for tonight?

26
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:10,367
This is delicious.
My compliments to the chef.

27
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,423
I'll give you his number,
and he delivers.

28
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:16,038
No kidding?

29
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:19,297
Listen, I wanted to say thank you.

30
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,827
There aren't many people that understand
what I'm going through.

31
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:25,782
Happy to help.

32
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,051
Any time.

33
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,267
Is everything okay?

34
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,957
We've only known each other
a short time,

35
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,528
but I'd like to feel
I can call you a friend.

36
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:37,967
Of course you can.

37
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,178
And as such, I feel a certain...

38
00:03:43,043 --> 00:03:44,043
Obligation

39
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:45,972
to tell you some things...

40
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,395
About your husband.

41
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:58,736
Projet-SG (1.00)

42
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:27,433
You were supposed to join us.

43
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:29,565
I know, sorry.

44
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,061
I pulled a thing.

45
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:33,397
Colonel wants everybody in shape.

46
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,381
Tomorrow. I promise.

47
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:37,175
Let's go!

48
00:04:38,182 --> 00:04:39,194
Come on.

49
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,151
To hell with this.

50
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,599
Mind if I join you?

51
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:00,966
You okay?

52
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:02,574
Fine.

53
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:08,811
Cause you look a little tired.

54
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:10,911
You getting any sleep?

55
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:13,187
I said I'm fine.

56
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,193
I'm fine too, thanks for asking.

57
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,754
<i>We've managed to secure
two more sections of the ship.</i>

58
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,829
I'm sending a team in to take a look.
I need you to operate a kino for me.

59
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:32,581
Kinda busy here.

60
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:33,999
Doing what?

61
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:37,836
I can't say.

62
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,312
<i>And what's that supposed to mean?</i>

63
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:42,549
That I was told not to say.

64
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:44,862
A secret mission, is it?
How intriguing.

65
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,636
Look, you're gonna have
to talk to Colonel Young...

66
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:50,099
About this.

67
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:52,959
Do me a favor,
have a look at your chest.

68
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,938
<i>Is there any insignia there,
thats says</i>

69
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,774
"Lieutenant" or "Sergeant,"
or anything like that?

70
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:03,948
- All I got is "you are here."
- Exactly.

71
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:08,385
- I'll be down when I'm done.
- Don't bother.

72
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:09,994
I'll manage.

73
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:13,090
He says he's fine,
but I'm worried about him.

74
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:16,723
Him and about a dozen others.
I want you to do psych evaluations.

75
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:20,630
Everyone, civilians, military.
I've been meaning to ask you anyway.

76
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,967
Don't you think Camile might want
to do them? Being H.R.

77
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,661
- You took psych in college, right?
- One course, undergrad.

78
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,009
- That hardly qualifies me.
- That's perfect. Get to it.

79
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,375
You can do it.

80
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,051
Hold on.

81
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,195
The door on your right, try it.

82
00:06:58,701 --> 00:06:59,993
More quarters.

83
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,838
Not bad...

84
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:04,883
Moving on.

85
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,802
So do I start crying now,
or do we build up to that?

86
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:11,430
Tell me how you're doing.

87
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,799
How I'm doing...

88
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:14,641
With life on the ship.

89
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,188
It sucks. I hate it.

90
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:22,441
How about your hydroponics lab?
Any luck there?

91
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,317
The seeds won't sprout,
which really sucks,

92
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:28,311
because I would have liked
to have started to grow some food.

93
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,940
I'm not really much
of a fruit and vegetable guy,

94
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:33,786
but anything would be better
than the crap you've been serving us,

95
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,828
and there's not enough water,
and the beds are rock hard,

96
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:39,514
and don't let me forget to mention

97
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,698
that I was shot
by one of your people!

98
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:45,765
So you're doing fine, then.

99
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,324
How's it coming?

100
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,930
I've run simulations

101
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,874
on a dozen variations of Telford's plan
to power the Gate,

102
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,184
but so far...

103
00:07:59,134 --> 00:07:59,895
Problems.

104
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:01,291
Such as?

105
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:04,015
Catastrophic failure,

106
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:05,484
every time.

107
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:09,154
Horrible death, fire and brimstone,

108
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,448
- dogs and cats living together...
- I get it.

109
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:15,170
Keep at it.
I want to make sure.

110
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,602
You're next up
to use the stones to visit Earth.

111
00:08:20,724 --> 00:08:22,459
It's all right, sir, I can wait.

112
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,171
You've been waiting. Take your turn.
Wray will be going too.

113
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:28,740
All right. Thanks.

114
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:33,343
<i>Go ahead.</i>

115
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,857
- What the hell is this?
- We found the dentist's office.

116
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:02,557
Don't touch anything.
Leave it!

117
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:04,214
I'm on my way.

118
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,071
It's me, Camile.

119
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,067
Weird.

120
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:33,939
Neural interface?

121
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:38,294
A precursor to an Ancient device
SG-1 discovered several years ago.

122
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,280
A repository of knowledge
that can be literally...

123
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,599
downloaded into one's mind.

124
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,084
This is one of those things?

125
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,449
Within that knowledge
may be the master code

126
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,196
to unlock the ship's core systems.

127
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:52,883
Navigation, propulsion.

128
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:54,176
You're sure?

129
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,595
We can't be certain
till someone actually sits in the chair.

130
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,697
It looks like it holds you down
and shoots bolts into your head.

131
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:03,101
They're merely electrodes
allowing the transfer of data.

132
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:05,604
Do you know what a device like this
did to General O'Neill?

133
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:09,107
The amount of information
overwhelmed him.

134
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,318
It damn near killed him
is what it did.

135
00:10:11,674 --> 00:10:14,404
- It led to incredible discoveries...
- And it damn near killed him.

136
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,865
The only thing we know for sure

137
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,641
is an ancient device like this
is pretty much a death sentence.

138
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,119
Nobody sits in it.

139
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:22,955
I want guard detail posted.

140
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,083
So, what are we to do, Colonel?
Ignore what this chair can do for us?

141
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,709
I'm telling you to ignore it.

142
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:30,212
But to study it
without sitting in it.

143
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:34,088
But, Colonel, this predates those found
in the Milky Way.

144
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:36,927
I'd bet
the effects are far less severe.

145
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:38,679
And your own life?

146
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:43,643
So you're fine
as long as someone else volunteers...

147
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,307
If it means getting these people home,
I'll sit in the damn thing.

148
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:48,814
<i>Colonel Young.
Come in.</i>

149
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:51,262
Go ahead.

150
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:53,360
<i>Colonel Telford's
in the communications lab.</i>

151
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:55,704
<i>He switched bodies with Scott
and he wants to talk to you.</i>

152
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:56,772
I'm on my way.

153
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:59,292
Colonel, so far
I've only managed to access

154
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,366
portions of Destiny's database.

155
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:03,697
We still can't control the ship.

156
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:06,766
Even if we could turn this thing around
right now and head back to Earth,

157
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:09,279
how long would that take,
another million years?

158
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:12,189
You want this chair
to be a wonderful discovery,

159
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:14,047
that's fine. Prove it.

160
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:17,931
You prove you can use it safely
to do something we need it to do.

161
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:21,126
Until then, no one goes near.

162
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,857
Always you on the stones.
Don't you let anyone else take a turn?

163
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:34,860
Why haven't you given us the data
collected during our experiment?

164
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:36,868
We're still working on it ourselves.

165
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:39,197
I've a team of scientists on Earth.
We want to help.

166
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,765
Till things get out of hand,
then you jump ship, leave us on our own.

167
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,098
How did Rush do it?

168
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:46,486
How did he defuse the situation?

169
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:48,066
When I know, you'll know.

170
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,637
I don't get it.

171
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:53,958
I'd think you'd be doing everything
to get these people and yourself home,

172
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,589
back to your wife.

173
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:03,055
If you need anything,
ask Lieutenant James.

174
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,270
Camile, it is you, right?

175
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:13,070
I didn't know
you were checking in today.

176
00:12:13,195 --> 00:12:16,650
I'm not, actually.
This is a personal visit.

177
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:19,026
Last time I was here,
I didn't get a chance to go home.

178
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:21,744
Right, of course,
but since I have you...

179
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,230
I'll be there in a minute.

180
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,913
Colonel Telford's team
is working on adjustments to their plan.

181
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:32,279
They're making progress.

182
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:34,586
Young is not going to listen,

183
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,312
at least not anytime soon,

184
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:37,774
and Dr. Rush...

185
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:41,676
Well, like you said,
he's in no hurry to come home.

186
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:43,768
Still trying
to take command of the ship?

187
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:46,014
He and Young are bumping heads, yes.

188
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,850
Right now, Young seems to be
winning that battle.

189
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:51,144
And you?

190
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:53,611
I'm caught between them,

191
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:56,233
not sure which camp
is the better choice.

192
00:12:56,563 --> 00:12:58,781
Maybe it's time
you started your own.

193
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:03,939
Your mail, all four letters.

194
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:05,252
Popular guy.

195
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:07,295
So, I'm your chaperone.

196
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,240
Where do you want to go?
Any family, friends?

197
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:11,240
There's a buddy
I want to catch up with.

198
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:14,626
- He's at Edwards, or he was...
- No problem.

199
00:13:18,891 --> 00:13:19,897
You okay?

200
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,783
I would imagine the level of stress

201
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:25,637
that comes with trying to figure out
the inner workings of this ship...

202
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:28,224
I know, it's intense,
especially figuring

203
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,351
we've only just scratched the surface
of all there is to know.

204
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:35,897
So how are you dealing with it?
How do you relieve the stress?

205
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:39,701
I...

206
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:42,473
Read.

207
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,410
35! 36! 37!

208
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,249
38! 39!

209
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:52,657
One, two, three, 18!

210
00:13:52,782 --> 00:13:54,958
One, two, three, 19!

211
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,459
Move it, move it!

212
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,383
Come on, people, faster!

213
00:13:59,763 --> 00:14:01,499
Faster, Franklin, move it!

214
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,086
You're pathetic, Franklin,
you know that?

215
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,212
Go again!

216
00:14:05,923 --> 00:14:07,137
Again, Franklin!

217
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,619
Move that fat ass!

218
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:10,429
You're pathetic!
Go again!

219
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,745
She's not cleared,
so stick with the cover story.

220
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:45,634
Hey there.

221
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:48,681
I'm looking for Annie Balic.
I'm an old friend of hers.

222
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,168
Does she live here?

223
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:52,605
She's my mom.

224
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:18,792
Is it really you?

225
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:22,211


226
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:37,448
If someone wants to volunteer
to sit in it, why won't he let them?

227
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:40,329
- He's trying to protect us.
- Please.

228
00:15:40,746 --> 00:15:41,915
It's politics.

229
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,360
He resists at first,
comes around eventually,

230
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:48,905
gives it the green light,
and if it works, he's the big hero.

231
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,415
And if it doesn't, well...

232
00:15:52,022 --> 00:15:53,507
You get to take the blame.

233
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:58,623
- Yes.
- How am I coping?

234
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:01,785
Honestly?

235
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,129
I don't know.

236
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:07,323
The people on board make it easier,
that's for sure.

237
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,654
I made some good friends,

238
00:16:11,774 --> 00:16:13,305
and I met Matt.

239
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:17,294
So there's that to be grateful for.

240
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:20,872
So are things getting serious
between you two?

241
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:24,218
He's been a real comfort.

242
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:28,368
When we're together...

243
00:16:31,335 --> 00:16:32,670
It's not so lonely.

244
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:36,453
You know?

245
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:36,060
Say the word,
and I'll call child protective services.

246
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:37,612
He says she'll be home soon.

247
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:39,389
Which was three hours ago.

248
00:17:40,846 --> 00:17:42,481
I just want to make sure that he...

249
00:17:57,622 --> 00:17:59,007
I'm Colonel Telford.

250
00:17:59,718 --> 00:18:01,413
I'm a friend of Matthew Scott's.

251
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:03,832
Is he okay?

252
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,868
Yeah, he's fine.
He's on a mission.

253
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,909
It's classified.
I can't say where, but...

254
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:11,556
He got your letter.

255
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,176
It said you need to see him?

256
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,728
Have you seen your parents?

257
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,316
No point. They're not cleared.
I can't tell them who I really am.

258
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:27,283
You can tell them
that their daughter's okay,

259
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:31,018
you can tell them that she misses them
and she loves them.

260
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:33,631
Go see them.

261
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,979
I tried to sell that.
I did.

262
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:41,364
- Right.
- I really...

263
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:44,572
Come here.

264
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,584
It's so strange, this...

265
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:49,499
Other body.

266
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,994
You know,
food doesn't taste quite right.

267
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,505
Wine either.

268
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,325
Now, this...

269
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,711
This feels right.

270
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,354
So much for retiring to our beach.

271
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:10,630
None of that right now.

272
00:19:15,907 --> 00:19:17,113
Forgot the rowboat.

273
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:24,658
Why did I forget the rowboat?

274
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:41,112
Come here.

275
00:19:41,237 --> 00:19:42,238
Come on...

276
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:46,327
Come here...

277
00:19:49,298 --> 00:19:50,333
It's okay...

278
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:53,746
Dr. Rush, you got a sec?

279
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:56,892
I'm doing psych evaluations,
the entire crew.

280
00:19:57,017 --> 00:19:59,051
- No, thank you.
- Colonel Young ordered them.

281
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:01,845
It's just a talk, see how you're doing,
give you a chance to voice

282
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,734
any problems or frustrations.

283
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:05,623
I'm fine.

284
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:08,015
No problems, no complaints.
Is that it?

285
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:15,618
He's usually not this shy.

286
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:19,993
It must be the uniform.
He loves the military.

287
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,638
Did you eat?

288
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,671
Go brush your teeth.

289
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,645
Matthew, go.

290
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,691
Is Lieutenant Scott...

291
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:47,871
I don't know
how good of a friend you are,

292
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,584
or what he might have told you...

293
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:51,749
He said there was a pregnancy,
but that you were...

294
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,930
I couldn't.

295
00:20:53,748 --> 00:20:55,367
I couldn't go through with it.

296
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,730
Why didn't you tell him?

297
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:02,808
I didn't want to burden him.
He was dealing with a lot of stuff.

298
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:26,913
What is it?

299
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:36,769
Now, that's good.

300
00:21:38,283 --> 00:21:41,575
Look, there's a bad guy out there,
put a gun in my hand, I'll go kill him.

301
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:43,977
Not going to lose any sleep over it.

302
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,970
Your ass needs saving,
I'm gonna save it,

303
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:47,430
or I'm gonna die trying.

304
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,765
I didn't ask to be like this.

305
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,560
Nobody made me this way.

306
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:54,424
You want to riff about my...

307
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:56,648
My childhood,

308
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,351
how my daddy...

309
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:01,220
Beat my ass, really...

310
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:04,322
Really messed me up?

311
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:10,620
What, you think
you can understand me?

312
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:14,832
- No, I just want to talk...
- I wish people would just shut up...

313
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:16,224
be happy...

314
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:18,336
For what I am.

315
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:19,949
People?

316
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,736
People less willing or able to do...

317
00:22:24,437 --> 00:22:25,439
What I do.

318
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,064
He fought in desert storm,
didn't he?

319
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:32,854
Your dad?

320
00:22:33,468 --> 00:22:36,354
- I'm not talkin' about him.
- You're the one who brought him up.

321
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:38,231
What was he like?

322
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:56,083
My mom used to babysit him
after school.

323
00:22:58,307 --> 00:22:59,475
This is her house.

324
00:23:01,523 --> 00:23:02,808
She died last summer.

325
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:05,653
This new job, though.

326
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,216
Insane hours,
but the money's really good,

327
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:11,394
so I should be able to hire
a sitter real soon.

328
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:12,974
What's the job?

329
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:17,703
I dance.

330
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:25,028
Matt said something about
you going to college,

331
00:23:26,483 --> 00:23:27,652
becoming a lawyer?

332
00:23:30,105 --> 00:23:31,307
That was then, right?

333
00:23:39,992 --> 00:23:40,993
It's time.

334
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,270
I need to use your cell phone.
Real quick.

335
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:52,019
I'll be right back.

336
00:23:53,555 --> 00:23:54,556
Sorry.

337
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:55,908
Be right there.

338
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:01,586
Come here.

339
00:24:04,553 --> 00:24:06,235
You are going to take a deep breath,

340
00:24:06,624 --> 00:24:08,427
and you're gonna find the strength.

341
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:11,629
You're gonna go back to that ship,

342
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:13,659
and you are gonna
work with those people.

343
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,149
Motivate them,
do whatever you need to do

344
00:24:16,274 --> 00:24:17,926
to get yourself back home.

345
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:23,370
Because I'm gonna be here.
I'm not going anywhere.

346
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:27,626
- Promise?
- I already did that 12 years ago.

347
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,170
The only thing that won't be here
when you get back

348
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:37,215
will be that stupid chair
over there.

349
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:51,872
I love you too.

350
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,081
Be right here.

351
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,411
So they just patched me
through to Matt,

352
00:25:22,241 --> 00:25:23,312
And I told him.

353
00:25:25,112 --> 00:25:26,399
He was angry, wasn't he?

354
00:25:28,474 --> 00:25:29,819
He's gonna need some time.

355
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,939
It's a lot to take in right now,
but, anyway,

356
00:25:34,064 --> 00:25:37,319
long story short,
the mission that he's on right now

357
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,390
takes care of him financially,
so he's...

358
00:25:40,924 --> 00:25:44,897
going to arrange to have his monthly
Air Force check directly deposited

359
00:25:45,497 --> 00:25:46,766
into your bank account.

360
00:25:51,478 --> 00:25:54,760
- Really?
- Yeah, that way you can quit your job,

361
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,356
you can go back to school

362
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:59,328
- and follow through with your dreams...
- Wait a minute.

363
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,136
If Matt wants to help us out,
that's great...

364
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,749
But, I'm okay with my job.

365
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:13,015
Wait, what about college?

366
00:26:13,717 --> 00:26:14,727
Me, a lawyer?

367
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:17,085
- Like that was ever going to happen.
- Did you even try?

368
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,478
Tell matt thanks,

369
00:26:20,552 --> 00:26:22,355
but I've got things
under control here.

370
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,059
He doesn't have to worry about us.

371
00:26:48,371 --> 00:26:49,982
I told you it wouldn't take long.

372
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,239
I've been able to access
the subspace link between Destiny

373
00:26:56,544 --> 00:26:58,639
and the unmanned ships
that were sent out ahead of it.

374
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:00,854
The ones seeding these Stargates
on the planets.

375
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:04,121
We have data on literally thousands
of gates that have already been seeded.

376
00:27:04,938 --> 00:27:07,325
I've only managed to get
through a fraction of it, but...

377
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,712
I found something quite interesting.

378
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:16,759
Almost the same mineral composition
as the Icarus planet.

379
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:18,631
How long?

380
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:19,929
One year away.

381
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:23,394
Naturally-occurring naquadria
throughout the planet's crust.

382
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:25,184
Ample power for our needs.

383
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:27,353
One more year,
we can gate back home?

384
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,022
It's not quite as simple as that.

385
00:27:31,264 --> 00:27:33,067
We have to learn
how to steer the ship.

386
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,454
How to orbit the planet.

387
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:37,027
Not to mention how to make the gate work
to dial home from there.

388
00:27:37,152 --> 00:27:39,819
As I said, much to be done,
but we will of course need...

389
00:27:40,632 --> 00:27:43,094
- the master code.
- You better get to work cracking it.

390
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:45,368
Sounds like you've got
the better part of a year.

391
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:48,979
But the...

392
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:51,794
- Neural interface device...
- Is still off-limits.

393
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,394
God, you think I don't know
what you're doing here?

394
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:56,828
Crack the damn code, Rush.
That's your job.

395
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:08,449
Hey, how'd it go?

396
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:10,642
Great.

397
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:13,096
And you?

398
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,515
Great.

399
00:28:23,813 --> 00:28:25,415
One year, and we're out of here?

400
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,468
- First we have to do what's necessary.
- Then get to it.

401
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:29,915
I will,

402
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:31,857
but we'll need your...

403
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:33,544
support,

404
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,831
shall we say.

405
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,759
Look, if it means
getting off this tin can,

406
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:41,844
we're all in.

407
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,361
I can't wait another year.

408
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:49,261
- I want off this ship now.
- Chill out, Spencer.

409
00:28:50,035 --> 00:28:51,854
A year's a hell of a lot better
than forever.

410
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:03,992
That is much better.

411
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:06,689
We'll crack it.

412
00:29:07,868 --> 00:29:08,704
We will.

413
00:29:09,072 --> 00:29:12,174
If we can, I know that Colonel Young
will give us access to the chair.

414
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:13,929
He has to, a chance like this?

415
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:16,045
This is our ticket home.

416
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:19,006
The word's getting around.
Everyone's really excited.

417
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,311
Yeah. It was good timing
because I don't know about you,

418
00:29:22,748 --> 00:29:26,240
but I was getting
to the end of my rope here.

419
00:29:54,453 --> 00:29:55,458
It's weird.

420
00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:57,520
I've never even met your wife.

421
00:29:58,058 --> 00:30:00,552
I only saw that picture you had
in your office at Icarus.

422
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:03,008
Telford, you connected with him.

423
00:30:05,014 --> 00:30:06,038
So, what...

424
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:09,133
This is a residual memory of his

425
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:11,968
that somehow transferred
to my subconscious?

426
00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:17,106
Doesn't mean
it was an actual memory.

427
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,241
It could've been one of his dreams.

428
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:22,606
Just because I saw her
doesn't mean the two of...

429
00:30:25,853 --> 00:30:26,657
Thanks.

430
00:30:40,244 --> 00:30:43,057
Dr. Boone told me about a planet
Rush discovered in the database.

431
00:30:43,182 --> 00:30:45,653
- Is it true?
- Yeah, finally some good news.

432
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:47,343
I hope it pans out the way.

433
00:30:47,468 --> 00:30:50,725
While you were gone, Colonel Young
asked me to do psych evaluations

434
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,601
on the entire crew,
assess people's state of mind,

435
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,184
any red flags
that we might need to be aware of.

436
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:57,631
Yeah, that's a good idea.

437
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:01,516
So, I was just kind of wondering
if you had some time to maybe...

438
00:31:01,641 --> 00:31:03,039
Sit down and talk to me?

439
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,055
Right.
No problem, but, you know,

440
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,762
I have some things to do today.
Is tomorrow OK?

441
00:31:08,887 --> 00:31:09,937
Yeah, OK.

442
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:11,601
Tomorrow's good.

443
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:16,457
Sorry.

444
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,760
- Watch where you're going.
- Easy! I said sorry...

445
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:21,295
- Expect people to get out of your way!
- What's your problem?

446
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,048
My problem is fat asses
clogging up the hallway.

447
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,509
What did I do?

448
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:29,158
I don't know what your problem is,
but get it together fast!

449
00:31:29,283 --> 00:31:30,985
- He ran into me!
- Shut up!

450
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,863
I don't care who ran into who!

451
00:31:32,988 --> 00:31:34,892
You keep pulling this crap,
I'll lock you up.

452
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,084
You got that?

453
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:41,511
Get out of here.

454
00:31:42,354 --> 00:31:43,467
Take a walk.

455
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,755
A son!

456
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:05,177
That is...

457
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:08,008
wild.

458
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,544
Yeah, tell me about it.

459
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:13,851
What's his name?

460
00:32:15,636 --> 00:32:16,648
Matthew.

461
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,198
I got an 8-year-old kid named after me.
How weird is that?

462
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:28,350
Are you okay?

463
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:32,139
It's a lot to...

464
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:33,841
deal with.

465
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:35,697
Angry...

466
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,543
That she didn't tell me,

467
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:41,021
that I couldn't be there for him.

468
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:43,877
Look, one more year,

469
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,531
and then you can take him

470
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,617
to soccer games and little league.

471
00:32:54,627 --> 00:32:55,806
What's the mother like?

472
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:00,810
She's got her issues.

473
00:33:01,884 --> 00:33:03,294
You two were close?

474
00:33:04,505 --> 00:33:05,514
Not really.

475
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,759
Yeah, I mean, for a short time,
but things happened.

476
00:33:11,454 --> 00:33:12,656
We lost touch.

477
00:33:13,836 --> 00:33:14,836
Until now.

478
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,131
- What are you doing here?
- Stay away from my wife,

479
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,800
you pathetic piece of scum!

480
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,510
Keep your finger out of my face.

481
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:17,638
You get back to me, pretend to be me,
crawl into bed with my wife?

482
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,472
No, he didn't pretend to be you!

483
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,475
He never pretended to be you.

484
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,394
He told me who he was all along,

485
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:25,562
and I didn't sleep with him,
by the way,

486
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:27,815
but thanks for not
jumping to conclusions.

487
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,967
He's a friend.
He's helping support me through this.

488
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:32,633
What, really? Is that right?

489
00:34:32,758 --> 00:34:34,764
Not all men are like you,

490
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:37,330
and I know
you're still sleeping with her.

491
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:39,451
He tell you this?

492
00:34:48,641 --> 00:34:50,462
What happened?
What just happened?

493
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,260
The connection
must have been severed, Colonel.

494
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,597
- I don't know why...
- Are you kidding me?

495
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,236
- Colonel Young...
- Not now.

496
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:05,269
Eli was checking
the planetary database.

497
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,184
The subspace link from the ships
that are seeding the gates?

498
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:10,569
I came across something
that didn't quite fit

499
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:12,561
with the coordinates established.

500
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:14,664
- Can't this wait?
- No, sir, it can't.

501
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,350
Rush lied.

502
00:35:20,706 --> 00:35:23,395
The Icarus planet
that he discovered a year away?

503
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:25,038
Doesn't exist.

504
00:35:25,987 --> 00:35:27,092
It's fake data.

505
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:29,710
He planted it himself.

506
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:45,782
You lied to these people.

507
00:35:46,364 --> 00:35:48,364
- I gave them hope.
- False hope, Rush!

508
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:51,126
Yeah, well, so was dialing Earth.

509
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,952
I knew it was pointless at the time,
but you persisted.

510
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:55,282
Why?

511
00:35:55,407 --> 00:35:56,713
To boost morale.

512
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:00,484
- You tell me the difference.
- I'll tell you, one is a lie.

513
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:01,609
Who cares?

514
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:04,328
Who else knows?

515
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,247
Wray overheard, so we can assume
everyone knows on the ship.

516
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,641
Well done, Colonel.

517
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,126
You've just ruined the chance
to maximize productivity.

518
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,212
I wasn't the one
who planted false information.

519
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,131
There may be an Icarus-type planet
buried in the data.

520
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,735
There may very well be.

521
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:21,041
I've only begun to scratch the surface,
but I'd be a lot further on

522
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,713
- if you would just let me use...
- Again with the chair!

523
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:26,850
- It could be our salvation...
- It could kill somebody!

524
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,270
A sacrifice that could save
the lives of everyone else on this ship.

525
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,282
I'm not stopping you, Rush.

526
00:36:35,544 --> 00:36:37,444
Go, sit, be my guest.

527
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:48,253
That's what I thought.

528
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:09,735
You hiding out, too?

529
00:37:11,377 --> 00:37:13,128
TJ is doing her psych evals.

530
00:37:13,618 --> 00:37:16,066
- I've been trying to avoid her.
- Why?

531
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:20,320
You start opening up,

532
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:23,448
you end up saying
personal stuff you probably shouldn't,

533
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:27,547
and you have to live with these people,
see them every day,

534
00:37:27,885 --> 00:37:31,580
have her give you weird looks
as she passes you in the hall?

535
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:33,200
Gets awkward.

536
00:37:41,668 --> 00:37:43,082
Chloe tells me you're a dad!

537
00:37:44,384 --> 00:37:45,489
Congrats.

538
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,741
Got yourself a mini-Matt.

539
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:54,851
See, that's what I'm talking about.

540
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:57,524
I speak and say things I shouldn't,

541
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,645
and I talk before I think...

542
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,361
- It's okay.
- No, no!

543
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:03,174
Look at you, you're...

544
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,536
you're bummed.

545
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:07,200
You found out that you have a son,

546
00:38:07,873 --> 00:38:11,414
but now he's probably not ever going to
get the chance to actually meet you,

547
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,536
and that sucks.

548
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:15,667
You don't want to talk about that.

549
00:38:20,355 --> 00:38:21,506
I'm going to go now.

550
00:39:06,873 --> 00:39:08,877
I've completed 14 psych evals.

551
00:39:09,002 --> 00:39:11,970
I have eight more scheduled,
the rest of the ship's avoiding me.

552
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,604
What's wrong?

553
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:18,689
Bad day.

554
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,261
A lot of those lately?

555
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,200
Something else is bothering you.

556
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,026
What happened?

557
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,792
This my psych eval?

558
00:39:41,661 --> 00:39:42,709
It can be.

559
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,260
Come on, talk to me.

560
00:39:59,026 --> 00:40:00,026
Bad day.

561
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,830
Dr. Volker?

562
00:40:17,057 --> 00:40:17,946
Yes.

563
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,361
Welcome to Earth.
I'm Major Peterson.

564
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:22,690
A car is waiting for you,
anywhere you want to go.
