00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,436
Projet-SG (1.00)

2
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,200
All right, get out,
get out of the way!

3
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,339
This is Scott, slow down the evac!
We are coming in too hot!

4
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,382
Colonel, come in!

5
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:57,397
My God, where are we?

6
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:01,795
What is this place?

7
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:04,126
Get them off the gate!

8
00:03:07,383 --> 00:03:08,479
Where are we?

9
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,118
- What is this?
- Why didn't we come through to Earth?

10
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:13,319
There was no time to explain!
Off to the side!

11
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,645
What's going on?

12
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,293
This is Scott, come in!

13
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:24,995
Colonel, come in!

14
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:28,142
- I need a medic!
- Over here!

15
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:33,921
- Can you move your fingers?
- No, I think my arm's broken.

16
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:37,432
Okay, just hold your arm there,
and we'll put it in a sling, okay?

17
00:04:01,894 --> 00:04:04,076
<i>Keep calm, keep calm.</i>

18
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,510
Clear this area, there could still be
more incoming!

19
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:47,652
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,788
Oh, God. Move, move.

21
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:54,734
Where the hell are we?

22
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:03,352
- Where's Colonel Young?
- He was right behind me.

23
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:17,866
- Move, move, move.
- Quiet.

24
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:21,732
- Stay calm!
- Excuse me.

25
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:23,034
Keep it down!

26
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,315
Move, move.

27
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:29,689
Colonel...

28
00:05:30,306 --> 00:05:31,211
Colonel?

29
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:33,093
Don't move.

30
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:36,779
- Where are we?
- I don't know, sir.

31
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:37,962
Are you... Sir...

32
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,924
You're in charge, all right?

33
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:49,908
Yes, sir...

34
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:57,856
- I'm coming!
- Clear the crowd, people.

35
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,905
- Coming through!
- Let's go, move, move!

36
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,312
Is he okay?

37
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,848
I don't know.

38
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:17,068
- What is this place?
- Look, I just did what Rush told me to.

39
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:19,211
- Where is he?
- I don't know he went through...

40
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:24,249
- Eli, help me find him.
- Well, I...

41
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:35,214
What in the hell was that?

42
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:36,705
I don't know.

43
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:38,864
Sergeant,

44
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:42,122
I need you to get these people settled,
and you find out who

45
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:43,619
and what we've got.

46
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:45,728
Nobody leaves this room.

47
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:47,179
Yes, sir.

48
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:53,867
Eli! Now!

49
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:03,694
The core of the planet
is the power source.

50
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:06,121
You have to channel it into the weapon
to destroy the ship.

51
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:08,135
<i>- Can't do it, dude.</i>
- Doin' it.

52
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,390
<i>It's a programmer's jokes,
a problem unsolvable.</i>

53
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:11,597
Already solved it.

54
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,719
<i>- No, you didn't.</i>
- Just shut up!

55
00:07:13,994 --> 00:07:16,059
And watch this...

56
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,230
- What the hell!
<i>- What happened?</i>

57
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:26,487
Nothing happened.

58
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:29,435
- I'm back at the beginning.
<i>- You're so full of yourself.</i>

59
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,492
No. It worked.
The firing code locked in.

60
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,564
<i>Whatever.</i>

61
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:38,954
That was extremely unsatisfying.

62
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:54,498
Eli Wallace?

63
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:57,297
Actually,

64
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:59,269
Eli's not here right now.

65
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,662
Okay, whatever you guys think that I did
I swear, you've got the wrong guy.

66
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:07,922
Do I look like someone
who would be standing here

67
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:10,989
if I didn't already know everything
there is to know about you?

68
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,683
- Yeah, not really.
- Right.

69
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:15,698
Who are you?

70
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:17,555
Dr. Nicholas Rush.

71
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:19,456
May we come in?

72
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:20,781
Why?

73
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:25,693
You've spent a great
deal of time recently

74
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:28,173
playing an online
fantasy game called Prometheus.

75
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:31,959
Big brother's
got nothing better to do?

76
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:36,098
Last night, you solved
the Dakara weapons puzzle.

77
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:39,322
Yeah, a month of my life
went into that.

78
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:41,720
You know what happens
when you solve that thing?

79
00:08:41,993 --> 00:08:42,881
Nothing.

80
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:44,196
We're here.

81
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:46,060
That happened.

82
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:48,730
To complete that particular puzzle,

83
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:51,780
you had to solve a millennia-old
mathematical proof

84
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:53,525
written in another language,

85
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:56,422
for that, you've won
something of a prize.

86
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,486
Well, whatever it is,
i'll take the cash equivalent.

87
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:01,723
There isn't one.

88
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:03,985
It's a non-disclosure agreement.

89
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:05,843
Non-disclosure?

90
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:07,045
So you guys

91
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,418
really embedded a top secret problem
into a game hoping someone...

92
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,760
like me would solve it?

93
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,389
So, what do you need me for now?

94
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:18,974
I assure you,

95
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:21,560
it'll be worth your while
to sign it.

96
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:26,148
- And if I don't?
- We'll beam you up to our spaceship.

97
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:32,543
Right.

98
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:36,740
I think I want my lawyer
to look over it first.

99
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:39,912
And by "lawyer," I assume
you mean "mother."

100
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,119
So we'll just agree
then that I will call you.

101
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:06,174
What the...

102
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:13,767
Welcome aboard the Hammond, Eli.

103
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:19,034
Yes, that is the planet Earth,
and yes, you are on a spaceship.

104
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,495
We need your help, Eli.

105
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,885
To be honest, I don't know
how long it's going to take.

106
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,811
I should call my mom...

107
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,295
- Tell her where I am.
- That's probably not gonna work up.

108
00:10:32,155 --> 00:10:32,975
Right.

109
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,800
You can speak to her on the way.

110
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:37,007
There's a cover story to follow.

111
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:38,006
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,967
On the way to...

113
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:43,225
To another planet,
21 light years from here.

114
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:45,560
I can't go. I...

115
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:49,439
- I have things that...
- We know about your mother's condition.

116
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:52,484
You just know everything, don't you?

117
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:55,153
We also know
you are currently unemployed,

118
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,990
and that your mother's
medical coverage is...

119
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:00,742
An ongoing issue.

120
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:04,163
We'll see she gets the best care
while you're gone.

121
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,926
And if I don't sign, what?

122
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:08,278
You're going to erase my memory?

123
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:11,799
Something like that.

124
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:17,848
Can I get some pants?

125
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,879
<i>Hello, I'm Dr. Daniel Jackson,</i>

126
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:33,525
<i>and behind me is a Stargate.</i>

127
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:35,819
<i>It was originally built
millennia ago by</i>

128
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,530
<i>an alien race
who we call the Ancients.</i>

129
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,813
<i>Over the next few hours
we'll be touching on some</i>

130
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:43,855
<i>... there are 39 symbols
representing star constellations</i>

131
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,169
<i>as seen from Earth...</i>

132
00:11:45,294 --> 00:11:47,534
<i>... when a connection is made
between two Stargates,</i>

133
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:50,436
<i>... an unstable energy vortex
emerges from the gate</i>

134
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:55,630
<i>... and settles into the event horizon
or puddle as we like to call it.</i>

135
00:11:56,143 --> 00:11:58,383
<i>Later, it was discovered
that using an eighth symbol</i>

136
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,130
<i>would actually dial another galaxy</i>
<i>in hundred of thousands of light years</i>

137
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,785
<i>via an interstellar wormhole...</i>

138
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,852
<i>... it is believed an unprecedented
amount of power is required...</i>

139
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,353
<i>- ... mysterious ninth chevron...</i>
<i>- The first six symbols...</i>

140
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,507
<i>Icarus base was establish on a planet
discovered two years ago...</i>

141
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:16,959
<i>The entire purpose of the project
is to hopefully one day</i>

142
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:21,031
<i>dial the nine chevron address
found in the ancient database.</i>

143
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,172
<i>Hi! I'm Dr. Daniel Jackson.</i>

144
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:25,786
<i>Now, you've heard the term
"hyperspace" for years...</i>

145
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,580
- Where are you?
- <i>It's top secret.</i>

146
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:31,910
I'm serious, ma. I can't say
anything more than that.

147
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:35,003
I don't understand. Why could you not
at least tell me you were leaving?

148
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,814
I'm sorry, but did you get
the letter from...

149
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,800
<i>Yeah, the Air Force, I got it.</i>

150
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:41,927
Are you in a plane now?

151
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,554
- You sound like you're in an airplane.
<i>- No.</i>

152
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,931
It's nothing like that.

153
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:48,892
I want you to know that
they're going to look after you.

154
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:50,769
You didn't have to do this.

155
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:52,346
This is good.

156
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:57,025
Really, it's the kind of thing
I always dreamed of.

157
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:07,536
Hi.

158
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:09,279
You mind?

159
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:10,542
No, go ahead.

160
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,005
Thank you.

161
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:18,880
First time on a spaceship, too?

162
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,702
Me?

163
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:23,061
I've been on lots of...

164
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:24,761
various...

165
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:27,681
- Eli Wallace.
- I know.

166
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,133
You've heard of me?

167
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:31,226
I have.

168
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:33,436
That almost never happens.

169
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,902
- And you are?
- Chloe.

170
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:37,899
I work for Alan Armstrong.

171
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,008
Senator of California.

172
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,448
Yeah, yeah.

173
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,239
I have heard of California.

174
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,700
My last job was in the burger
and fries field.

175
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:50,287
- How'd you line that up?
- I was a political

176
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,105
science major at Harvard, so...

177
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:55,036
I hear it's a good school.

178
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:57,252
- For a while there, I was at...
- MIT.

179
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,806
- I know.
- Really?

180
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:01,256
What else
have they told you about me?

181
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,117
- What?
- I've seen this writing before.

182
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:20,044
- In the game?
- Yeah.

183
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,414
We're on a ship?

184
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:39,475
The design is clearly Ancient,

185
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:42,088
in the truest sense of the word.

186
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:43,846
Launched...

187
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,143
hundreds of thousands of years ago.

188
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,996
Faster than light,

189
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:52,140
- yet not through hyperspace.
- What are you doing?

190
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:54,440
Who knows how far it's travelled.

191
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:58,647
We've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

192
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:16,248
<i>Lt. Scott, come in.</i>

193
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:18,208
Go ahead.

194
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,294
We've got a problem, one of the
air vents just shut down in here.

195
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,048
Copy that.

196
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,841
Yeah, the air's getting
pretty thin in here, too.

197
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,457
What does that mean?

198
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:30,631
That the life-support system
is failing.

199
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:34,376
We should probably do
something about that.

200
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:48,405
- Well, it's always just one more year.
- It's a command.

201
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:51,283
- Where?
- It's a lot safer than other places.

202
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,221
You've put your time in, Everett.

203
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:56,123
- When this tour's over, I promise
- You know what?

204
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:59,332
Never mind, don't bother.
You always end up choosing

205
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,839
somewhere other than here.

206
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:04,296
I am not choosing my job over you.

207
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,715
How you can even say that to me?

208
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,509
I love you,

209
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,511
but I can't wait anymore...

210
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:19,853
Are you okay?

211
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:22,287
Sweetheart, baby, look at me.

212
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,450
<i>Colonel?</i>

213
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:37,355
Oh, my God.

214
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,362
Can't you do something?

215
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:44,869
He's having a seizure.
There's nothing I can do.

216
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:01,353
<i>Scott, this is Colonel Young,
come in please.</i>

217
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,564
<i>Our guests have arrived
a few minutes early,</i>

218
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,012
<i>what's your position?</i>

219
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:08,817
No, not yet.

220
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:13,961
<i>Lieutenant, drop whatever you're doing
and get your ass up here.</i>

221
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:19,954
I'm on my way, sir.

222
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:29,223
Bye.

223
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:42,477
Holy...

224
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:49,017
Senator...

225
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,986
It is my honor to welcome you
to Icarus base.

226
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,384
This is
my executive assistant, Chloe.

227
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,825
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- The pleasure's mine.

228
00:17:57,164 --> 00:17:58,712
She's also my daughter.

229
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,705
You must be the...

230
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,486
Contest winner, yeah.

231
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:06,751
- That is a big gun.
- Rail gun.

232
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,391
500 rounds per minute.

233
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:10,380
This is Lieutenant Scott.

234
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,674
He's been assigned to you,
Mr. Wallace.

235
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,217
Shall we go inside?

236
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:20,390
Unbelievable.

237
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:22,970
Yeah, it is.

238
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:26,604
It's weird how fast you can start
to take something like this for granted.

239
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:32,694
So, if a Stargate can instantly
transport you to another planet,

240
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,893
why did we fly here on a spaceship?

241
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,383
Something to do with how this one's tied
into the planet for power.

242
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:41,766
Apparently, it's been modified
to only dial out

243
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:44,112
because incoming wormholes
are too dangerous.

244
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:48,001
You're the genius.
You can probably tell me better.

245
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:50,420
All I did was solve a puzzle
in a video game.

246
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:54,435
You figured out something doctor Rush
has been trying for months,

247
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,256
which, by the way,

248
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:58,511
a lot of people were glad to see.

249
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,514
You know Colonel Telford.

250
00:19:02,345 --> 00:19:04,809
- Ready for this, Colonel?
- You just give the word, sir.

251
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,676
I gave it quite a while ago,
Colonel.

252
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:09,814
I'm just here to see
how my $1.6 billion is being spent.

253
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:13,777
Very good.
Thank you, everyone.

254
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:16,310
Dismissed.

255
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:23,228
Now, as you know, up until now,

256
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:26,756
we have been unable to channel
the precise amount of power necessary

257
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:29,571
to unlock the Stargate's
ninth and final chevron.

258
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:33,046
However, thanks to some ingenuity
from young Mr. Wallace here,

259
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:37,331
- that problem has finally been solved.
- We've heard that before.

260
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:39,010
This time we're sure.

261
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,171
That's what I figured out?

262
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:45,141
I embedded the mathematical problem
we had to solve into the game.

263
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:49,109
I then engineered your solution
into a practical, workable application.

264
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:53,483
- What say we get on with it?
- Absolutely.

265
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,180
Sergeant Riley...

266
00:19:57,335 --> 00:19:59,271
- Chevron 1 encoded.
- Sir...

267
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:07,997
We're dialing now?

268
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,651
- A test, to see if we can connect.
- Chevron one locked.

269
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,462
If we do, we'll send an automated
reconnaissance drone through.

270
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,255
We'll see what's on the other side.

271
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,537
Chevron 2 locked.

272
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:19,175
- And then they'll go?
- No, first, we close down again,

273
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,345
assess the data we receive,
and then perhaps send the away team.

274
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,613
If it works.

275
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:25,950
Chevron 4 locked...

276
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:28,992
Until then, they're just
interested observers like us.

277
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,521
Chevron 5 locked.

278
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:33,189
Chevron 6 encoded.

279
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:36,313
Chevron 6 locked.

280
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,737
Chevron 7 encoded.

281
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:41,865
Chevron 7 locked.

282
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,450
Chevron 8 encoded.

283
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,204
Chevron 8 locked.

284
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:49,914
Chevron 9 encoded.

285
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:58,588
What's going on?

286
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:00,675
I don't know,
we never got this far before.

287
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:02,969
Chevron 9...

288
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:05,889
Chevron 9...

289
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:08,273
Will not lock.

290
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:17,618
We matched the power requirements
down to the EMU.

291
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,997
It must work.

292
00:21:19,431 --> 00:21:21,737
Power levels in the gate capacitors
are going into the red.

293
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:23,529
- Shut it down.
- No, wait...

294
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:26,409
- We've fluctuations from the core...
- Shut it down now.

295
00:21:43,718 --> 00:21:45,681
- It should have worked.
- Well, it didn't,

296
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:48,751
- and drawing power from the core is...
- Dangerous, we're aware...

297
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:50,558
Regardless of what's been spent,

298
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,812
my first priority is to ensure
the safety of the people on this base.

299
00:21:58,949 --> 00:21:59,950
Of course.

300
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:01,725
Of course...

301
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,366
We'd best run through
your equations again.

302
00:22:07,322 --> 00:22:08,493
You'll excuse me.

303
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:11,795
You are not seriously
putting this on me?

304
00:22:17,578 --> 00:22:18,461
Not my fault.

305
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:29,299
People, you have to calm down.

306
00:22:29,424 --> 00:22:31,605
Seriously, you have to calm down.

307
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:33,184
We got power!

308
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,148
Can I have
everybody's attention, please?

309
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,882
All right, please listen!

310
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:44,741
Listen up!

311
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:48,063
What is going on?

312
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:51,082
We're on an ancient spaceship.

313
00:22:51,612 --> 00:22:52,612
What?

314
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:55,312
That's all I've got.
Now, what that means is...

315
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:58,126
It means we need to use the Stargate
to get us all back home.

316
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,211
That is definitely on the list
of things to do,

317
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,255
- but right now...
- It's an order.

318
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,605
We're working on it.

319
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,996
I need to speak to the person
responsible for this.

320
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:08,386
- Where is Dr. Rush?
- Just shut up for a second!

321
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,815
How dare you talk to me...

322
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,389
Dad?

323
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:12,794
Dad, please...

324
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:13,920
Water?

325
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:16,893
- Over here.
- Sit down.

326
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,526
My pills...

327
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:25,751
Look, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to
explain the situation.

328
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,809
We are on a ship,

329
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,868
but we have no idea where we are
in relation to Earth.

330
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,624
Now, with respect, sir,

331
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:36,415
the reason you might be having
a hard time breathing right now,

332
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
is because...

333
00:23:38,177 --> 00:23:41,317
the ship's life-support system
is not functioning properly.

334
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:44,496
Dr. Rush
is working on that right now.

335
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,675
Brody and Park?

336
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,984
- Here.
- Here.

337
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:50,785
Okay, good, you two are with me.

338
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,265
- But these consoles just came on.
- No. Nobody touch anything yet.

339
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,353
Dr. Rush needs your help.

340
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,721
Everybody else...

341
00:23:58,381 --> 00:24:00,563
Just stay calm, stay put.

342
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:01,731
Please.

343
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:03,415
Stay put?

344
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,786
What do you mean,
you're just going like that?

345
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:08,773
There has to be a mistake
in here somewhere.

346
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,561
Seriously, who uses
a whiteboard anymore?

347
00:24:12,044 --> 00:24:14,529
You have computers,
like, everywhere around here.

348
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:16,496
Power flow was in the target range.

349
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:18,706
Why wouldn't the address connect?

350
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:20,129
Wrong address?

351
00:24:20,254 --> 00:24:22,599
There is only one, found
in the ancient database on Atlantis.

352
00:24:22,724 --> 00:24:24,116
With no other instructions.

353
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:26,545
No, but that's not the issue.
It has to be your proof.

354
00:24:27,228 --> 00:24:28,304
My proof works.

355
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:31,403
You know how I know that it does?
Because you said so.

356
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:33,379
Gentlemen, how's it coming?

357
00:24:34,752 --> 00:24:36,793
- What are you doing?
- Starting from the beginning.

358
00:24:36,918 --> 00:24:38,392
Wait! Save, save!

359
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,395
Mr. Wallace, I would like you to join me
for dinner in the officer's mess.

360
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,042
We're quite close to a breakthrough,
actually. I'd like Eli to keep working.

361
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,883
Well, we've been here for six months.
It can wait a few more hours.

362
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:52,508
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

363
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:03,793
So, Colonel, you really have

364
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,965
no idea where this ninth-chevron
Stargate address is going to send you?

365
00:25:08,744 --> 00:25:09,841
No idea at all.

366
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,137
But the Ancients built
the Stargate with nine chevrons.

367
00:25:14,492 --> 00:25:16,131
It's got to go somewhere.

368
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,475
... we've also known for some time
the only way to unlock the ninth chevron

369
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,123
was to solve the power issues.

370
00:25:52,248 --> 00:25:55,219
Well, if anyone's going to solve it,
I think Eli will.

371
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:57,221
That's right.

372
00:25:58,102 --> 00:25:59,149
It's true...

373
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,892
I am Mathboy.

374
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:18,117
- I would like to propose a toast.
- No, that's really not necessary.

375
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,413
Not to you.

376
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:23,748
When the proposal for this project
first crossed my desk,

377
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,266
I did not want to approve it.

378
00:26:25,391 --> 00:26:27,585
It seemed clear to me at the time
there were enough

379
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,004
terrestrial matters of importance
that needed that money.

380
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,508
Now, being a proud father
of a beautiful young woman is one thing.

381
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,345
Having that young woman
exceed every...

382
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,057
possible expectation
is quite another.

383
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,462
It was my daughter, Chloe,
who reminded me

384
00:27:28,587 --> 00:27:31,756
that there was no greater endeavor than
seeking an understanding of who we are

385
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:35,515
- and the mysteries of the universe.
- Not in those exact words.

386
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,978
It was also her idea
to embed the ancient proof in a medium

387
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:42,660
that would give us access to brilliant
young minds that we'd have overlooked.

388
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,832
And so, to all the brave men and women
who have volunteered...

389
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,001
What was that?

390
00:27:51,848 --> 00:27:52,993
This is Young.

391
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:00,261
The base is under attack.

392
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,264
All non-combatant personnel
report to your designated areas,

393
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,725
everyone else to your battle stations.
This is not a drill.

394
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,578
Senator, I need you and your daughter
to go with Lieutenant Scott.

395
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:09,865
Eli, you as well.

396
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:22,772
What's going on in here?

397
00:28:24,698 --> 00:28:26,579
The life-support system is on,

398
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,332
but for some reason,
it's not working properly.

399
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:31,459
I'm attempting to reset it.

400
00:28:32,426 --> 00:28:33,961
He has no idea what he's doing.

401
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:37,705
Step away from that thing.

402
00:28:38,263 --> 00:28:40,550
- That screen says what you're doing...
- Eli, please!

403
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:43,682
- Is that what it says or not?
- You know what it says in this screen

404
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:47,350
because I embedded a rudimentary version
of the ancient language into the game.

405
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:50,198
- This is not a game.
- Don't touch it, Rush.

406
00:28:50,323 --> 00:28:53,425
When the oxygen aboard this ship
falls below critical level,

407
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,851
it will become increasingly difficult
to concentrate.

408
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:58,143
What you're doing
could blow the whole ship.

409
00:28:58,268 --> 00:28:59,201
Are you sure?

410
00:28:59,326 --> 00:29:01,697
Back off now, or I will shoot!

411
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,964
Lower your weapon!

412
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:05,730
He already screwed us once.
I'm not going to let him do it again!

413
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,827
I need to get through, people.
Stand aside.

414
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,256
We're under attack.
Don't know who, don't know why.

415
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:23,052
Consider the charges dropped.
Go take your anger out on them.

416
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:24,530
Yes, sir.

417
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,317
<i>What do we got, Lucian alliance?</i>

418
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,895
That would be my guess.
They haven't introduced themselves.

419
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,529
<i>They started shooting
the minute they came out of hyperspace.</i>

420
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:44,323
Our shields are holding,
but we're not the target.

421
00:29:44,637 --> 00:29:45,833
What's heading our way?

422
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,202
<i>A full squadron of gliders
and a troop transport.</i>

423
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,831
We cut them down some, but the rest
will be on your doorstep in 3 minutes.

424
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,124
Did you copy?

425
00:29:53,688 --> 00:29:56,001
If we can get to the transport
before they land their troops,

426
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,368
we stand a chance.

427
00:29:58,224 --> 00:30:01,465
I'm going to press that button.
It's going to fix the life-support,

428
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:03,843
and then you and I and everyone else

429
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:07,274
will be able to breathe
and think much better.

430
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:09,364
Don't do it.

431
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,437
Look,

432
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:19,775
I know we are in
a tough situation here,

433
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,278
but I am giving you an order.

434
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,975
Lower your weapon.

435
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,178
So?

436
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,782
I suppose
that would have been too simple.

437
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,979
Apparently, that did nothing.

438
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:06,140
This may take a little more time, TJ.
Hang in there.

439
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Copy.

440
00:31:10,729 --> 00:31:12,828
Does Colonel Young know about this?

441
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:14,420
He knows.

442
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,390
Two weeks ago, you told me

443
00:31:16,515 --> 00:31:19,335
that this was the best
experience of your life.

444
00:31:19,818 --> 00:31:21,468
Something must have happened.

445
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:22,989
The scholarship came in.

446
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:27,343
I guess I've just been too afraid
to admit what I really want.

447
00:31:28,766 --> 00:31:31,172
You didn't tell me
you had even applied.

448
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,183
There's nothing else going on.
You know I'd tell you.

449
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:37,061
- Unless you were protecting someone...
- I'm not.

450
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:40,564
Like I said,
I just hadn't made up my mind.

451
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:16,392
I'm reading a dangerous
energy spike in the core.

452
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:22,025
- I need your help.
- With what?

453
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,649
- The ninth chevron.
- What?

454
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:26,944
- We need to get the hell out of here!
- It took us 2 years to find this site.

455
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,405
The properties are unique.
This may be our last chance.

456
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:33,253
If this bombardment continues,

457
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:35,335
the radioactive core's
going to go critical.

458
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,288
You mean the planet,
it's going to explode?

459
00:32:40,362 --> 00:32:42,668
- If my math works...
- We can't assume that...

460
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,360
I said "if". Then if it works,

461
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:47,529
then it's not a power supply issue,
it's the gate address.

462
00:32:47,654 --> 00:32:51,218
We've known the first eight symbols.
The ninth has to be the point of origin.

463
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,141
What if we're not on the planet
you're supposed to be dialing from?

464
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:57,816
- This is where we are.
- What if we aren't supposed to be here?

465
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,205
<i>Icarus base, Telford.
We can't hold 'em back.</i>

466
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,216
Let's go! Go!

467
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:25,868
Sergeant Riley,
dial the Stargate to Earth!

468
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:29,356
Take cover!

469
00:33:39,194 --> 00:33:40,550
Chevron one locked.

470
00:33:41,113 --> 00:33:44,229
Follow me, the symbols on the Stargate
are constellations as seen from Earth,

471
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,623
that's what you said?

472
00:33:45,748 --> 00:33:48,240
What if Earth is supposed to be
the point of origin?

473
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:52,194
The only viable power source was here,
light years away.

474
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,303
What if that doesn't matter?
What if it's the only combination

475
00:33:55,428 --> 00:33:57,152
that will work, like a code.

476
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,161
A code?

477
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,678
Chevron four encoded.

478
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:04,485
- Stop the dialing sequence.
- I have my orders.

479
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,396
Get out of my way,
get out of the way!

480
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:08,752
We can't risk dialing Earth.

481
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:18,514
Come on, let's go.

482
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:32,367
Dad?

483
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:33,904
Dad!

484
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:38,200
My father! There could still be people
trapped on the other side.

485
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,424
All right, let's go, people!
You need to move it to the gateroom!

486
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,187
This is Scott.

487
00:34:43,312 --> 00:34:45,666
I got about a dozen or so people
cut off from the gateroom,

488
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,255
south-east corridor.

489
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:52,923
Dammit...

490
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,260
- Is that Dr. Simms?
- Stay with me.

491
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,638
He was helping pull people
back from the surface.

492
00:35:02,716 --> 00:35:04,082
Simms, can you hear me?

493
00:35:06,745 --> 00:35:07,563
No!

494
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,288
Come on, we got to go.

495
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:53,609
That is impressive.

496
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:57,988
Power's fluctuating
at critical levels.

497
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,034
Colonel, I'm detecting a massive
build-up of energy from the planet!

498
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:05,788
Recall our fighters.

499
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:08,499
Radio Colonel Telford he's got 2 minutes
to get his people aboard

500
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,485
before we jump to hyperspace!

501
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:14,880
What's everybody doing?
I ordered an evacuation!

502
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:19,959
He didn't dial Earth.
It's the ninth chevron address.

503
00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:21,108
What?

504
00:36:22,383 --> 00:36:24,890
The attack started a chain reaction
in the planet's core,

505
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,851
there's no way of stopping that,
and any blast could easily translate

506
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,312
through an open wormhole.
It's too dangerous to dial Earth.

507
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,153
- You could have dialed somewhere else.
- This is our only chance.

508
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:35,207
- Shut it down.
- We can't, it's too late...

509
00:36:35,332 --> 00:36:36,607
System's not responding.

510
00:36:36,732 --> 00:36:38,862
- I need to save these people.
- We have a way out.

511
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,744
We don't know what's on
the other side!

512
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,593
Can't be worse than here, can it?

513
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:51,250
Nobody move!

514
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,131
Await further instructions.

515
00:36:59,727 --> 00:37:00,676
What's that?

516
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,262
- It doesn't look like life-support.
- I realize that.

517
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:14,239
What are we looking at?

518
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:16,441
It's a star map.

519
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:19,763
That's the Milky Way.

520
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:23,647
I believe it's a visual log
of the ship's journey.

521
00:37:24,518 --> 00:37:25,826
This is where we are now?

522
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:28,294
No.

523
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:31,248
That's where the ship
originally embarked from.

524
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:32,886
Earth.

525
00:37:34,122 --> 00:37:35,755
It's leaving the galaxy.

526
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,712
It did.

527
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:37,950
Long ago.

528
00:37:38,075 --> 00:37:39,287
That was Pegasus.

529
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:42,323
So those points are more stars?

530
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:43,719
No...

531
00:37:44,183 --> 00:37:45,679
they're galaxies.

532
00:37:52,212 --> 00:37:53,680
Where the hell are we?

533
00:37:55,325 --> 00:37:57,527
Several billion
light years from home.

534
00:38:07,406 --> 00:38:08,327
Stand clear.

535
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:14,226
- You could take down the roof with it.
- No time for argue.

536
00:38:14,351 --> 00:38:16,793
I need you to lead the evacues.
You need to go with him.

537
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,928
No, I'm staying here
until I know my father's okay.

538
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:23,208
Make sure everyone carries as much
of the expedition supplies as they can.

539
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,092
Why?

540
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,511
You're not going to Earth.
Rush dialed the ninth chevron.

541
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,285
Go.

542
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:30,555
Go!

543
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,907
Once I'm through,
follow one at a time on a three-count!

544
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,192
You good? Okay, let's go.

545
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:26,531
If you can hear me, stand back!

546
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:33,074
Okay, get down.

547
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,387
Fire in the hole!

548
00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:44,158
Dad?

549
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:48,660
Dad?

550
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:50,452
Put your weight on me...

551
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:52,639
Keep calm, everybody.

552
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:56,852
- I got you.
- Please...

553
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:09,031
Everybody, stay calm! Don't push!

554
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:22,911
Dad!

555
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:25,672
Careful, careful...

556
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:27,490
You're okay, sir.

557
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:30,828
- Are you okay?
- I'm the last one. I'm all right.

558
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,680
Go. I'm right behind you.

559
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,082
Hammond, this is Young, come in.

560
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,062
Hammond, this is Young.

561
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:41,354
Come in.

562
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,191
Let's go, let's go, come on, people.

563
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,996
Let's do it, let's do it.

564
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:09,411
- Sir!
- Go!

565
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:51,174
We've got Colonel Carter.

566
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:53,574
On screen.

567
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,888
<i>General, we barely got away.</i>

568
00:41:57,243 --> 00:41:58,682
<i>The planet was destroyed.</i>

569
00:41:59,013 --> 00:42:01,278
We managed to beam most
of our people off the surface

570
00:42:01,403 --> 00:42:02,853
before jumping to hyperspace.

571
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,551
<i>We also believe
that the enemy forces were destroyed.</i>

572
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,353
<i>Any word on how they gained intel
on our base?</i>

573
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:11,778
<i>No.
What about casualties?</i>

574
00:42:12,211 --> 00:42:13,047
12.

575
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:15,010
80-plus MIA.

576
00:42:15,414 --> 00:42:16,916
The bunker-shielding technology

577
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:19,220
prevented us from beaming out
anyone inside.

578
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:21,705
How many people made it
through the gate to Earth?

579
00:42:22,027 --> 00:42:23,017
None.

580
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:24,001
<i>None?</i>

581
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:26,528
<i>Our sensors indicated
that the Stargate was active</i>

582
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:28,920
<i>for a full six minutes
before the core went critical.</i>

583
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:30,714
They didn't come through here.

584
00:42:31,172 --> 00:42:32,452
<i>Then where'd they go?</i>

585
00:42:41,263 --> 00:42:42,492
Okay, listen up!

586
00:42:43,081 --> 00:42:44,519
Everybody who is able,

587
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,838
we are going to search this ship
top to bottom.

588
00:42:47,963 --> 00:42:49,141
Teams of three.

589
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:54,528
- Weapons?
- 23, including handguns.

590
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:57,571
- One per group?
- Yeah.

591
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:02,495
Flashlights, radios...
only when necessary.

592
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,326
Once those batteries are dead,
they are dead.

593
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:08,000
Regular check-ins with Dr. Rush
in the control room

594
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,128
every 10 minutes, and keep in mind,

595
00:43:10,523 --> 00:43:13,195
as far as we know,
this bucket is really freakin' old,

596
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,801
and there may be areas of damage
where life-support is unstable.

597
00:43:17,145 --> 00:43:19,137
Look, be smart, okay?

598
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,781
Don't touch anything
that looks like it might be dangerous.

599
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,400
How are we supposed to know
what's dangerous?

600
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:27,479
- Becker, right?
- Yes, sir. I work in the mess.

601
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:29,272
I mean, I did.

602
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,539
Well, don't touch, just look.

603
00:43:34,187 --> 00:43:35,570
You're James, right?

604
00:43:36,543 --> 00:43:37,739
Yes, Lieutenant.

605
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:40,033
You and Riley are with me.

606
00:43:40,566 --> 00:43:41,624
Subtle, man,

607
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:43,433
subtle...

608
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:45,550
If it's okay with you, sir,
it might be best,

609
00:43:45,675 --> 00:43:48,276
given your obvious skills,
if you could hang back here,

610
00:43:48,401 --> 00:43:50,252
help keep the rest
of these people calm.

611
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:51,878
Don't patronize me, son.

612
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,351
No, sir.

613
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:25,904
Are you all right?

614
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,611
I'm solid, Lieutenant.

615
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:29,387
I'm trained for this.

616
00:45:31,174 --> 00:45:33,677
- Look, I didn't mean...
- Look, not now.

617
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,041
<i>Rush, this is Scott, come in.</i>

618
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:47,419
<i>Rush, this is Scott, come in.</i>

619
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:50,455
Hello.

620
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:51,586
<i>This is Eli.</i>

621
00:45:51,711 --> 00:45:52,707
Where's Rush?

622
00:45:53,723 --> 00:45:55,043
Bathroom, if he found it.

623
00:45:57,308 --> 00:46:00,173
I'm at what looks like
a bulkhead door. It won't open.

624
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,480
<i>I was hoping Rush
could open it from there.</i>

625
00:46:03,675 --> 00:46:04,973
Should I find him?

626
00:46:06,128 --> 00:46:06,948
No.

627
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:15,790
- Here, give me a hand.
- What happened to being smart?

628
00:46:15,915 --> 00:46:19,057
This could be the engine room.
We got to at least open a few doors.

629
00:46:19,182 --> 00:46:19,984
Do we?

630
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:21,486
Do we really?

631
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:29,772
<i>Hang on.</i>

632
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:33,299
No, keep doing what you're doing.

633
00:46:34,951 --> 00:46:37,938
I think I found where you are.
The door is flashing red.

634
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:39,379
<i>Can you open it?</i>

635
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,800
Red is usually bad, isn't it?

636
00:46:42,107 --> 00:46:43,842
<i>Maybe the door is stuck.
Just try it.</i>

637
00:46:47,825 --> 00:46:49,305
You should probably step back.

638
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:01,580
Not good, not good, more red!

639
00:47:06,686 --> 00:47:07,490
Close it!

640
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:09,409
<i>- Close it now!</i>
- I'm trying!

641
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:20,879
Okay, we established
why that hatch was closed.

642
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,965
A lot of others are closed
for the same reason.

643
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,426
We're only occupying a fraction
of the ship right now.

644
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,936
<i>It goes on forever,</i>

645
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:30,597
<i>but if there are damaged areas
that aren't sealed,</i>

646
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,105
that could be our problem.

647
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,251
Good timing. We just found...

648
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:37,671
Really?

649
00:47:37,796 --> 00:47:38,855
This is Dr. Rush.

650
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,867
<i>Meet me in the gateroom immediately.</i>

651
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,585
Everyone.

652
00:47:50,163 --> 00:47:51,392
What's going on?

653
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,328
In this case

654
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:57,490
are five ancient
communication stones.

655
00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:01,677
They work over vast distances
in real time.

656
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,630
We can talk to the people on Earth.

657
00:48:04,165 --> 00:48:05,006
Yes.

658
00:48:05,747 --> 00:48:09,093
You physically take control
of an individual at the other end.

659
00:48:09,842 --> 00:48:11,095
I brought these with us

660
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,401
in the event we ended up somewhere
out of range of normal communication.

661
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:15,850
So let's use them.

662
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,095
I already have.

663
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,069
Are they sending help?

664
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:23,938
No.

665
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,297
- Why? Why are they not sending help?
- The only means of dialing this gate

666
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:30,406
from our galaxy
was destroyed in the attack.

667
00:48:30,805 --> 00:48:31,829
We're cut off.

668
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:36,579
- I want to use one of those stones now.
- I have spoken with General O'Neill.

669
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,457
- I am a United States Senator!
- I've explained our situation clearly.

670
00:48:39,848 --> 00:48:42,627
In light of my knowledge
and experience,

671
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:45,004
- he has placed me in charge.
- He did what?

672
00:48:48,411 --> 00:48:50,718
I have faith in our ability

673
00:48:51,073 --> 00:48:52,285
to repair the ship,

674
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,055
and to work together,

675
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:56,015
but if we're to survive this,

676
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,035
we need leadership

677
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,186
and a clear chain of command.

678
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,635
We only have a few
hours of air left.

679
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,236
- I want to speak to the General.
- Please.

680
00:49:05,361 --> 00:49:06,359
Give it to him!

681
00:49:10,555 --> 00:49:12,073
Dad? Dad!

682
00:49:13,845 --> 00:49:15,108
Excuse me. Okay.

683
00:49:15,942 --> 00:49:17,328
Okay, he's still breathing.

684
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,510
Oh, my God!

685
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:22,625
- I saw him taking some pills?
- Warfarin, for his heart.

686
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:25,753
Blood-thinners are the last thing
he needs if he's bleeding internally.

687
00:49:26,057 --> 00:49:28,334
- Please do something!
- I told you, I'm just a medic.

688
00:49:28,459 --> 00:49:29,734
Everyone, please,

689
00:49:30,144 --> 00:49:32,844
there's no need for us all
to congregate in the one place.

690
00:49:33,365 --> 00:49:36,745
Ms. Johansen, please find
adequate accommodation for the injured,

691
00:49:37,198 --> 00:49:40,393
- and everyone else...
- No, I don't recognize your authority.

692
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,847
As an IOA representative,
I think you,

693
00:49:42,972 --> 00:49:45,759
... much more comfortable.
Please go there, and stay there,

694
00:49:46,476 --> 00:49:48,276
until you're asked to do
something useful.

695
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,010
Something useful?

696
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,739
We do not want to settle in!

697
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,365
We want to get back!

698
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,568
Right?

699
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:58,119
We should be working
on getting home.

700
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,452
- Exactly.
- I'm not sure if that's even possible.

701
00:50:00,577 --> 00:50:02,271
What? You haven't even tried!

702
00:50:02,396 --> 00:50:04,867
Maybe you should actually do something
instead of standing around

703
00:50:04,992 --> 00:50:07,629
- talking about being in charge.
- If that's even true.

704
00:50:07,998 --> 00:50:10,098
Everybody! Everyone, calm down!

705
00:50:11,429 --> 00:50:12,258
Now,

706
00:50:12,778 --> 00:50:14,093
the fact is,

707
00:50:15,602 --> 00:50:18,014
Colonel Young put me in charge,

708
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,249
and I expect

709
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:22,383
all SG personnel
to follow my orders!

710
00:50:22,508 --> 00:50:24,967
As for the rest of you,
you get out of line,

711
00:50:25,445 --> 00:50:26,760
we will lock you down.

712
00:50:31,412 --> 00:50:32,487
Now, Dr. Rush

713
00:50:33,065 --> 00:50:34,716
is right about a couple things.

714
00:50:34,841 --> 00:50:37,450
First off,
we all have to work together.

715
00:50:38,525 --> 00:50:41,547
And second of all,
we don't all have to stay here, so...

716
00:50:42,118 --> 00:50:43,279
Let's move out.

717
00:50:46,695 --> 00:50:48,127
Come on, move. It's okay.

718
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:49,629
You heard him...

719
00:50:55,477 --> 00:50:56,792
I think we need you...

720
00:50:58,127 --> 00:51:00,867
So I've got your back for now,
but if I were you,

721
00:51:00,992 --> 00:51:03,601
I would find some way
to dial that gate back to Earth.

722
00:51:20,486 --> 00:51:22,398
I've got some testing equipment
over here.

723
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:23,871
Looks broken.

724
00:51:24,284 --> 00:51:27,458
- We'll get back to that.
- What about all these ancient crates?

725
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,195
If it's not ours, don't touch it.

726
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,566
Did no one think
of labeling anything?

727
00:51:31,691 --> 00:51:33,394
Every case has a bar code.

728
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:36,214
All right, anyone find
a bar code reader?

729
00:51:36,339 --> 00:51:38,723
Guess that got left behind
along with the food and water.

730
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:39,765
We got food.

731
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,861
Yeah, protein bars,
and this powdered stuff.

732
00:51:42,986 --> 00:51:44,130
Look, everybody.

733
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,102
Seeds? Volker,
you've got to be kidding.

734
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,397
- I got a case of blank paper.
- We should start a suggestion box.

735
00:51:49,783 --> 00:51:51,107
What are you staring at?

736
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:55,570
You were in detention.

737
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,116
- For good reason.
- What did you want him to do,

738
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,409
leave me there?

739
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:03,711
Of course not.

740
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:06,998
I was just wondering
what to do about it now.

741
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:09,959
That's not up to you.

742
00:52:11,263 --> 00:52:12,211
We'll see.

743
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,134
No, no. Don't do it.

744
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,374
<i>I need you to help check
for any open bulkhead doors</i>

745
00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:25,697
<i>that lead to damaged parts of the ship.
Rush will direct you.</i>

746
00:52:26,055 --> 00:52:26,926
Copy.

747
00:52:43,574 --> 00:52:45,707
<i>There should be
an elevator directly ahead.</i>

748
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,687
Copy that.

749
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:10,161
<i>Are you there yet?</i>

750
00:53:10,286 --> 00:53:12,215
This is Scott.
Radio silence, please.

751
00:53:26,753 --> 00:53:27,982
What's going on?

752
00:53:31,797 --> 00:53:33,128
We almost lost you.

753
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,378
You were thrown
clear across the room.

754
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:37,743
Where are we?

755
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:40,524
Where are we?

756
00:53:41,145 --> 00:53:43,236
We're on a ship. It's ancient.

757
00:53:43,361 --> 00:53:45,619
Rush says it's thousands
of years old, and we're...

758
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:47,907
pretty far off into the universe.

759
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:50,142
What's he doing to get us home?

760
00:53:50,585 --> 00:53:53,424
He says he's working on it,
but we have bigger problems.

761
00:53:53,549 --> 00:53:55,606
The life-support system
isn't working properly.

762
00:53:56,404 --> 00:53:58,734
If we can't get it fixed,
there's not much time.

763
00:53:59,532 --> 00:54:02,139
You should also know that
he used the communication stones,

764
00:54:02,264 --> 00:54:04,282
and he said General O'Neill
put him in charge.

765
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,459
I don't think so. I don't think...

766
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,527
Sir, you shouldn't be trying
to get up just yet, okay?

767
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:14,009
I don't think I have a choice, TJ.
I can't feel my legs.

768
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,604
Jeez!

769
00:54:28,367 --> 00:54:29,698
What is that thing?

770
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:31,593
Come here, I'll show you.

771
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:40,776
It's a camera.

772
00:54:41,892 --> 00:54:43,195
It's a flying camera.

773
00:54:44,272 --> 00:54:46,889
I'm calling it a kino,
you know, after the Russian...

774
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,078
I figure maybe we can use it
to check out the damaged areas.

775
00:54:51,804 --> 00:54:52,997
- That's good.
- Yeah.

776
00:54:53,432 --> 00:54:55,374
That's good.
Where's it going now?

777
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,360
I don't know, it's just doing its thing,
but there's lots more of 'em.

778
00:55:10,421 --> 00:55:11,940
- Yeah, it's cool.
- Yeah.

779
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:14,413
Do you want one?

780
00:55:14,942 --> 00:55:17,438
It's not a gumball machine, Eli.

781
00:55:20,963 --> 00:55:23,415
Okay, so you figured out
where they keep the kinos,

782
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,196
what else have you figured out?

783
00:55:33,249 --> 00:55:34,444
Give me a break, man.

784
00:55:34,854 --> 00:55:37,838
This is my second spaceship,
and my first was yesterday.

785
00:55:37,963 --> 00:55:38,811
I know.

786
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:42,820
Icarus was my first
SGC assignment after training.

787
00:55:43,827 --> 00:55:46,183
I haven't been at this much longer
than you have.

788
00:55:46,815 --> 00:55:48,693
Did they beam you out of your house?

789
00:55:48,983 --> 00:55:50,471
No, you got me there.

790
00:55:51,675 --> 00:55:52,921
Got any food on you?

791
00:55:53,046 --> 00:55:53,894
No.

792
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:55,088
Tylenol?

793
00:55:55,213 --> 00:55:56,227
Headache?

794
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,302
Yeah.

795
00:55:57,427 --> 00:55:58,366
Me too.

796
00:55:59,826 --> 00:56:03,599
Neuroproaxia is a temporary paralysis
that can follow a concussive injury.

797
00:56:04,258 --> 00:56:05,427
You don't know?

798
00:56:05,755 --> 00:56:08,044
You'd need an MRI
and a qualified doctor

799
00:56:08,169 --> 00:56:10,866
who knows how to read it to know
for sure if there's spinal damage.

800
00:56:11,257 --> 00:56:12,451
We don't have either.

801
00:56:12,923 --> 00:56:14,912
Hopefully, it's just
the nerves in shock.

802
00:56:15,243 --> 00:56:17,790
Best I can do is insist
that you remain still.

803
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,137
Your tour was over two weeks ago.

804
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,213
You should be in some classroom
in San Diego.

805
00:56:25,487 --> 00:56:26,341
Seattle.

806
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:29,760
That's where my scholarship was.

807
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,388
I'm sorry.

808
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:35,143
That part's not your fault.

809
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:39,020
Tell Rush I want to see him.

810
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:40,768
Yes, sir.

811
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:47,635
What's that?

812
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,584
Flying camera ball.

813
00:56:49,709 --> 00:56:51,556
- I'm calling it a kino...
- Don't ask.

814
00:56:56,671 --> 00:56:58,255
That's marvellous.

815
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,931
It comes with a remote.
I thought we could use to look around.

816
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,530
What do you have?

817
00:57:07,276 --> 00:57:08,709
It's not so good, really.

818
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,193
These processing nodes
are scrubbers,

819
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:14,221
responsible for
cleaning CO2 from the air.

820
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:16,140
Here, here, and here.

821
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:19,143
It's indicating malfunctioned.
Others are failing.

822
00:57:21,442 --> 00:57:22,728
Greer, this is Scott.

823
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:25,149
I'm heading for the gateroom.
Meet me there.

824
00:57:26,037 --> 00:57:28,996
Look, I'm just saying
that she better stay out of my face.

825
00:57:29,121 --> 00:57:32,159
I'll remind her of your
personal space issues next chance I get.

826
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:38,621
Col. Young wants to see you.

827
00:57:39,013 --> 00:57:41,165
There should be a kind of grate
covering the node.

828
00:58:00,418 --> 00:58:01,647
<i>What do you see?</i>

829
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:03,696
A problem.

830
00:58:05,229 --> 00:58:06,901
We see a very big problem.

831
00:58:17,895 --> 00:58:19,005
What happened?

832
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:20,882
You collapsed.

833
00:58:21,616 --> 00:58:22,999
We brought you here.

834
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:25,709
What's going on?

835
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:30,168
- I'm not sure. I've been here with you.
- You need to know what's happening.

836
00:58:30,293 --> 00:58:31,602
This is important.

837
00:58:31,727 --> 00:58:33,634
Dad, I was worried about you.

838
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,879
And I'm scared.

839
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,767
One step at a time, honey.

840
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,476
One step at a time.

841
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:47,743
My pills...

842
00:58:47,868 --> 00:58:50,326
No, daddy, you can't take
any more of those.

843
00:58:51,057 --> 00:58:53,674
Your ribs are badly bruised.
You will bleed internally.

844
00:58:54,169 --> 00:58:57,199
If I don't take those pills, a bruise
is gonna be the least of my problems.

845
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,371
I know.

846
00:59:00,433 --> 00:59:01,850
Don't worry about me.

847
00:59:02,227 --> 00:59:05,833
- Find out what's going on out there.
- No, I want to be here with you.

848
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:09,207
And I want you here, but right now,
I want to know what's going on

849
00:59:09,332 --> 00:59:11,088
just a little bit more.

850
00:59:14,379 --> 00:59:15,885
I'll be here when you get back.

851
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:30,727
What's going on?

852
00:59:30,852 --> 00:59:32,818
I don't know.
The air filter's full of crap.

853
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,270
Come on,
they want us to keep looking.

854
00:59:35,395 --> 00:59:36,197
Let's go.

855
00:59:36,547 --> 00:59:37,845
All right, okay.

856
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:43,760
Alkaline.

857
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:47,281
Everyone's heart rates are elevated,
people are reporting headaches...

858
00:59:47,406 --> 00:59:48,209
What?

859
00:59:48,377 --> 00:59:51,170
The used-up residue of whatever
magic compound the ancients used

860
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:52,630
to scrub CO2 from the air.

861
00:59:53,182 --> 00:59:56,222
So now we have two big problems
relating to the life-support.

862
00:59:56,347 --> 00:59:59,052
Our first priority must be
to seal off any of the leaks.

863
00:59:59,647 --> 01:00:01,263
If we can manage that, then...

864
01:00:01,718 --> 01:00:05,935
we can maybe buy ourselves a day or so
before the build-up of CO2 kills us.

865
01:00:06,865 --> 01:00:08,854
As it stands,
how much time do we have?

866
01:00:09,384 --> 01:00:10,375
I don't know.

867
01:00:10,683 --> 01:00:12,099
Couple of hours at most.

868
01:00:12,953 --> 01:00:13,817
Awesome.

869
01:00:14,397 --> 01:00:15,725
Brody, there was...

870
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:18,781
some medical-grade soda lime
in the supply manifest?

871
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:20,241
It never made it.

872
01:00:20,836 --> 01:00:21,945
That's a pity.

873
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:30,407
In a ship this old...

874
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:32,578
There's bound to be...

875
01:00:32,703 --> 01:00:34,520
systems past their designed life.

876
01:00:34,645 --> 01:00:37,132
Okay, let's say we find the leaks.
Can you fix this?

877
01:00:38,071 --> 01:00:40,000
I doubt this stuff
can be cooked off.

878
01:00:40,954 --> 01:00:44,260
Perhaps if there were stores
of this substance in a clean form,

879
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,184
or something else capable
of CO2 sequestration,

880
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,687
calcium carbonate,
lithium hydroxide, then...

881
01:00:49,993 --> 01:00:51,480
yes, "if".

882
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:53,443
That's not going to matter

883
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:55,943
because you're going to get
the gate dialed back to Earth

884
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:59,321
before this becomes
an issue, Rush, right?

885
01:01:00,414 --> 01:01:02,658
That's the thing
you're taught to say in officer training

886
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:06,203
presumably for the benefit
of those that don't know any better.

887
01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:19,695
Please.

888
01:01:21,254 --> 01:01:23,234
What makes you think I won't try?

889
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,156
I found what looks like a shuttle.

890
01:01:45,505 --> 01:01:49,246
Looks like there are two shuttles
attached to individual docking sleeves.

891
01:01:49,899 --> 01:01:52,152
- We're all going to die.
- Shut up, Franklin.

892
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:55,060
I'm just saying what
everyone's got to be thinking.

893
01:01:55,185 --> 01:01:57,603
I said, shut up,
or else you're going to be first.

894
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:02,760
This the door?

895
01:02:04,124 --> 01:02:06,155
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
Can you close it?

896
01:02:10,551 --> 01:02:11,746
It won't close.

897
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:16,508
We can't close it from here, either.

898
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:18,579
There's something wrong
with the mechanism.

899
01:02:32,837 --> 01:02:34,271
I think I found the leak.

900
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:39,755
There's another door
on the back of the shuttle,

901
01:02:40,064 --> 01:02:41,548
but there's no control.

902
01:02:42,631 --> 01:02:44,628
Then maybe we can
close it off locally.

903
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:51,663
The shield keeping the air inside
is obviously not 100% effective.

904
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,711
It probably wasn't designed
to compensate

905
01:02:54,836 --> 01:02:56,939
for the amount of damage
the ship has sustained.

906
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,603
Is there a way of boosting it?

907
01:02:59,423 --> 01:03:01,151
At least in the areas we need it?

908
01:03:01,834 --> 01:03:03,228
We haven't found a way yet.

909
01:03:03,353 --> 01:03:05,406
It seems to be operating
at maximum capability.

910
01:03:10,202 --> 01:03:11,620
Open the door!

911
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:19,322
That's not good.

912
01:03:28,776 --> 01:03:30,602
That's very good, a very good sign.

913
01:03:31,944 --> 01:03:34,116
I don't have time for this, do I?

914
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:36,854
Two problems. We're venting atmosphere
from a damaged shuttle,

915
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,647
and even if we could seal it off,

916
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,777
the life-support system in this ship
is past its expiration date.

917
01:03:42,446 --> 01:03:45,195
We'll build up CO2
to lethal levels within a day.

918
01:03:45,695 --> 01:03:47,072
That explains the headache.

919
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,613
You already had one.

920
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,035
They'll find a way,
it's what they do.

921
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,317
Most of these people
aren't even supposed to be here.

922
01:03:53,442 --> 01:03:55,998
- How did the ship get damaged?
- We don't know.

923
01:03:56,418 --> 01:04:00,252
It seems it's been through a battle,
at least the parts we can access.

924
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,929
We're still cut off from most
of the ship. It's huge.

925
01:04:03,054 --> 01:04:05,302
They tried jamming something
into the shuttle doorway

926
01:04:05,427 --> 01:04:08,177
to keep it open long enough
to let the person inside get out...

927
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,194
But it just opens again.

928
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,307
Some sort of safety mechanism.
Like an elevator.

929
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,126
Rush says he can't override it.

930
01:04:15,587 --> 01:04:18,312
- How long do we have right now?
- As it stands...

931
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,773
- Rush says if we don't get it closed...
- We've got just over an hour.

932
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,949
Bad air's better than no air.

933
01:04:36,142 --> 01:04:38,469
Guess a day's better than an hour.

934
01:04:40,206 --> 01:04:42,044
Someone's got to go in there

935
01:04:42,808 --> 01:04:44,201
and close this door.

936
01:04:51,539 --> 01:04:52,721
My head is pounding.

937
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:55,303
Heartbeat has accelerated.

938
01:04:55,655 --> 01:04:57,753
It's getting harder
and harder to breathe,

939
01:04:59,376 --> 01:05:02,731
as our very lives
are being vented out into space.

940
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,402
- That is gonna get old very fast.
- This needs to be documented.

941
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,444
- No one's going to see that.
- How do you know?

942
01:05:10,334 --> 01:05:11,634
We made it here.

943
01:05:12,589 --> 01:05:13,992
Someone else could, too.

944
01:05:17,698 --> 01:05:18,698
If we die,

945
01:05:19,314 --> 01:05:21,700
maybe this can help them
to find out what happened to us.

946
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:23,252
But we're not dead yet.

947
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:30,946
I'm starting to have
slightly blurred vision...

948
01:05:31,071 --> 01:05:31,927
What?

949
01:05:35,729 --> 01:05:37,349
So how are we going to decide who?

950
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:40,104
I assume we're not
going to get any volunteers.

951
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:43,414
What's another day going to buy us?

952
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:44,910
Time...

953
01:05:45,262 --> 01:05:46,700
To find a way to survive.

954
01:05:48,366 --> 01:05:49,594
May I see the list?

955
01:05:51,772 --> 01:05:53,702
I marked the names
of anyone injured.

956
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:56,535
Right.

957
01:05:56,832 --> 01:06:00,423
We have to find out peoples' skills,
background, experience...

958
01:06:00,548 --> 01:06:03,469
Doesn't take any special skills
to die from asphyxiation!

959
01:06:03,594 --> 01:06:05,688
Look, what I'm saying is,

960
01:06:05,813 --> 01:06:08,589
it shouldn't be someone
with potentially valuable knowledge,

961
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:12,210
or abilities we might need
to help us survive beyond this.

962
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,590
Are you really
suggesting what I think...

963
01:06:14,715 --> 01:06:17,178
Doc, half the people on this ship
already want to kill you.

964
01:06:17,303 --> 01:06:18,515
I don't care.

965
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:21,685
You can't ask someone
to sacrifice themselves, period!

966
01:06:22,868 --> 01:06:24,878
Politicians ask military personnel

967
01:06:25,003 --> 01:06:28,186
to sacrifice themselves
for the good of others all the time.

968
01:06:28,747 --> 01:06:30,986
If someone doesn't go in
there and close that door,

969
01:06:31,422 --> 01:06:32,802
we're all going to die.

970
01:06:33,352 --> 01:06:34,355
Period.

971
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:49,381
Franklin is still working
at the airlock controls locally,

972
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:51,347
but it doesn't look good, sir.

973
01:06:51,735 --> 01:06:54,301
Camile's explaing the situation
to everyone else on board.

974
01:06:54,685 --> 01:06:55,636
I'll do it.

975
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:58,736
- Sir?
- This isn't the kind of thing

976
01:06:58,861 --> 01:07:01,319
I can ask somebody else
to volunteer for.

977
01:07:01,444 --> 01:07:04,138
If we're going to make it past this,
we're going to need you, sir.

978
01:07:04,263 --> 01:07:07,084
I don't know about that. You're doing
a pretty good job, Lieutenant.

979
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:10,609
Look at the mess we're in.
If that's not proof that we need you...

980
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,277
I'm not sure anyone should do it.

981
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:14,468
I don't want someone
sacrificing for me.

982
01:07:14,593 --> 01:07:16,754
I say we figure this out together
while we have time,

983
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:18,784
- or we all die trying.
- Listen to me.

984
01:07:19,183 --> 01:07:21,396
It needs to be done,
and I'm doing it.

985
01:07:23,868 --> 01:07:26,384
- Look, sir, you can barely stand.
- Help me.

986
01:07:27,161 --> 01:07:29,904
The paralysis is temporary,
you know that now. You will recover...

987
01:07:30,029 --> 01:07:31,380
- I need your help.
- No.

988
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:32,881
- It's an order.
- I know.

989
01:07:33,377 --> 01:07:35,958
You can have me court-martialled
when we get home, but I am not

990
01:07:36,316 --> 01:07:37,761
gonna help you kill yourself.

991
01:07:41,401 --> 01:07:43,143
My father's not in his room.

992
01:07:44,182 --> 01:07:46,679
We'll find him.
He does not leave this room.

993
01:07:47,899 --> 01:07:49,231
He can't have gotten far.

994
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:52,324
- I told him what was going on.
- Greer, this is Scott, come in.

995
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:56,872
Greer, do you read?

996
01:07:57,404 --> 01:08:00,088
<i>Senator Armstrong is missing.
He may be headed your way.</i>

997
01:08:00,673 --> 01:08:01,782
He's here.

998
01:08:04,195 --> 01:08:05,366
He's got a gun.

999
01:08:08,148 --> 01:08:09,622
I don't want to shoot you.

1000
01:08:10,554 --> 01:08:12,462
I don't think you want to shoot me.

1001
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:16,466
- Get out of the way.
- Just give me a little more time.

1002
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:18,301
Let me try and fix this.

1003
01:08:18,778 --> 01:08:20,067
I don't have much.

1004
01:08:34,959 --> 01:08:37,404
<i>Guys, I'm not seeing any change,
whatever you just tried,</i>

1005
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,604
- it's not working!
- The problem's obviously mechanical.

1006
01:08:45,505 --> 01:08:46,580
You can't fix it.

1007
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:53,021
Tell me what to do.

1008
01:09:02,022 --> 01:09:03,384
Dad, no, wait!

1009
01:09:19,432 --> 01:09:20,762
<i>Open the door!</i>

1010
01:09:22,006 --> 01:09:23,116
<i>Open the door!</i>

1011
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,648
- I can't!
- Please open the door...

1012
01:09:29,946 --> 01:09:31,495
He was dead on his feet.

1013
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:33,293
Dad, no!

1014
01:09:34,422 --> 01:09:35,445
I love you.

1015
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:38,682
Please open the door...

1016
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:43,412
<i>Not him!</i>

1017
01:09:43,537 --> 01:09:45,484
There's nothing
I can do for him here.

1018
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:49,351
<i>Help him!
Open the door, please!</i>

1019
01:10:21,732 --> 01:10:23,718
He can't leave me...

1020
01:10:42,925 --> 01:10:44,573
At least he bought us a day.

1021
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,545
You!
You did this!

1022
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:01,485
You killed him!
You've killed all of us!

1023
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:03,844
Stop!
Little help here...

1024
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,720
Relax.

1025
01:11:06,809 --> 01:11:09,194
Just get away from me!
All of you!

1026
01:11:13,212 --> 01:11:14,269
Miss Armstrong...

1027
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:16,146
You're in shock.

1028
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:18,298
Believe me, I understand.

1029
01:11:19,594 --> 01:11:22,277
Everyone deals with tragedy
in different ways.

1030
01:11:22,783 --> 01:11:25,510
- You're looking for someone to blame.
- I'm not looking.

1031
01:11:28,173 --> 01:11:29,618
I'm sorry about your father.

1032
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,720
I truly am.

1033
01:11:34,381 --> 01:11:35,707
He was a good man,

1034
01:11:36,577 --> 01:11:38,611
and he certainly
wouldn't have been my choice,

1035
01:11:39,225 --> 01:11:40,795
but you must realize,

1036
01:11:41,806 --> 01:11:43,468
none of this was my fault.

1037
01:11:44,423 --> 01:11:47,302
I didn't create the situation
that forced us here.

1038
01:11:48,627 --> 01:11:50,160
There was no other way.

1039
01:12:10,878 --> 01:12:12,228
Miss Armstrong...

1040
01:12:13,691 --> 01:12:15,890
I know you don't
want to hear this just now,

1041
01:12:16,668 --> 01:12:17,668
but...

1042
01:12:19,227 --> 01:12:20,126
this ship...

1043
01:12:22,488 --> 01:12:25,590
This ship could be
the most important discovery

1044
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,426
mankind has made
since the Stargate itself.

1045
01:12:29,569 --> 01:12:31,310
You know the Icarus project

1046
01:12:31,877 --> 01:12:34,340
was something
your father truly believed in,

1047
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,393
enough to risk his career
to support.

1048
01:12:38,934 --> 01:12:41,523
What difference does it make
if we all die?

1049
01:12:44,044 --> 01:12:47,495
A number of people died
during the attack on the base.

1050
01:12:48,751 --> 01:12:50,240
Some of them I knew very well.

1051
01:12:52,024 --> 01:12:54,411
I'm sure some had
more value than others.

1052
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,163
As human beings,

1053
01:12:58,576 --> 01:13:00,337
all of them were invaluable.

1054
01:13:04,907 --> 01:13:06,007
My point is,

1055
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:08,666
I promise you,

1056
01:13:09,492 --> 01:13:11,302
I will do everything I can

1057
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:14,448
to make sure no one
gave their life in vain.

1058
01:13:16,224 --> 01:13:17,224
No one.

1059
01:13:24,802 --> 01:13:26,377
Please give me a chance.

1060
01:13:53,502 --> 01:13:54,502
Colonel...

1061
01:13:56,806 --> 01:13:58,611
We've lost Senator Armstrong.

1062
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:00,330
Oh, my God.

1063
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,188
- He's bought us some time.
- To do what?

1064
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,620
We're working on it.

1065
01:14:04,745 --> 01:14:07,525
First up is trying to
dial the gate back home.

1066
01:14:07,852 --> 01:14:10,070
- Should you even be on your feet?
- No.

1067
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:12,811
I am on my feet, and right now
we're trying to get home.

1068
01:14:13,186 --> 01:14:14,786
Camile, I need your help.

1069
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:18,172
You know these people.
I need you to spread the word.

1070
01:14:18,297 --> 01:14:20,705
Try to keep things
as positive as you can.

1071
01:14:21,545 --> 01:14:23,320
- I can do that.
- Good.

1072
01:14:42,384 --> 01:14:44,687
I can't believe my dad is gone.

1073
01:14:46,292 --> 01:14:47,986
I watched him die,

1074
01:14:49,744 --> 01:14:52,278
and I still just can't accept it.

1075
01:14:58,339 --> 01:14:59,702
Tell me about him.

1076
01:15:01,587 --> 01:15:02,622
Why?

1077
01:15:03,053 --> 01:15:04,932
Man died so I could live.

1078
01:15:06,228 --> 01:15:09,462
I'd like to know
a little more about him.

1079
01:15:12,081 --> 01:15:14,258
No matter how tired he was,

1080
01:15:16,493 --> 01:15:18,173
or how long he'd worked,

1081
01:15:19,175 --> 01:15:21,210
or what was going on in his life,

1082
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:25,225
he always had time to listen to me.

1083
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:29,482
I'd go on and on.

1084
01:15:31,656 --> 01:15:33,307
He never preached.

1085
01:15:36,066 --> 01:15:39,709
He never told me what to do,
even though sometimes I wished he would.

1086
01:15:42,823 --> 01:15:44,291
He would just listen,

1087
01:15:47,118 --> 01:15:49,255
and then he would tell me
that he loved me.

1088
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:55,873
The best part was if I'd had
a fight with my mom.

1089
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:58,136
He never took sides.

1090
01:16:00,382 --> 01:16:01,421
Oh, God.

1091
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:04,154
My mom...

1092
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:08,382
He was her whole life.

1093
01:16:11,187 --> 01:16:13,478
She probably thinks we're both dead.

1094
01:16:14,252 --> 01:16:15,236
All I know

1095
01:16:15,519 --> 01:16:17,756
is that he wanted you to go on.

1096
01:16:20,098 --> 01:16:21,109
I know.

1097
01:16:25,395 --> 01:16:27,600
I got to get back to the search.

1098
01:16:29,479 --> 01:16:30,752
You gonna be okay?

1099
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:33,364
I don't know.

1100
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,138
Fair enough.

1101
01:16:58,183 --> 01:16:58,988
What?

1102
01:16:59,905 --> 01:17:01,243
What are you doing?

1103
01:17:06,147 --> 01:17:07,912
Just watched a man die.

1104
01:17:17,347 --> 01:17:18,747
Don't you even care?

1105
01:17:23,081 --> 01:17:24,433
Of course I do,

1106
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,489
and I'm also trying to learn
as much as I can,

1107
01:17:28,614 --> 01:17:30,186
as quickly as I can.

1108
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:32,397
That is, in addition

1109
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:35,024
to running nine separate searches
in the database

1110
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:37,811
in the hope of solving
our life-support issues.

1111
01:17:45,147 --> 01:17:45,973
Right.

1112
01:17:49,574 --> 01:17:50,999
Found anything?

1113
01:17:53,847 --> 01:17:54,858
Destiny.

1114
01:17:58,345 --> 01:17:59,353
As in ours?

1115
01:18:00,665 --> 01:18:02,088
The name of the ship.

1116
01:18:02,622 --> 01:18:04,217
Translated from Ancient.

1117
01:18:06,414 --> 01:18:08,748
I've also discovered
that they were never here.

1118
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:12,449
I thought his was an ancient ship.

1119
01:18:12,974 --> 01:18:13,896
It is,

1120
01:18:14,619 --> 01:18:16,425
but they sent it out unmanned,

1121
01:18:17,504 --> 01:18:19,777
planning to use the gate
to get here,

1122
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:22,109
when it was far enough out
at the end of the universe,

1123
01:18:24,009 --> 01:18:26,554
but they probably learned to ascend,
before that time.

1124
01:18:27,289 --> 01:18:28,432
Learned to what?

1125
01:18:29,722 --> 01:18:30,832
Ascension.

1126
01:18:32,525 --> 01:18:35,869
It's a process, where by consciousness
converts to energy,

1127
01:18:36,561 --> 01:18:38,815
that no longer requires
physical form.

1128
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:41,617
That wasn't in the video.

1129
01:18:42,976 --> 01:18:44,927
Well, there's more than one video.

1130
01:18:47,492 --> 01:18:49,197
We should get back to work.

1131
01:18:55,415 --> 01:18:56,230
Sorry.

1132
01:19:07,882 --> 01:19:08,951
I think I got it.

1133
01:19:09,873 --> 01:19:12,775
It wasn't even that hard to find.
It's right here in the dialing program.

1134
01:19:13,045 --> 01:19:15,757
- You're sure?
- Yes, it's an eight-symbol address.

1135
01:19:16,113 --> 01:19:18,068
You mean you can
dial this thing back to Earth?

1136
01:19:18,193 --> 01:19:21,590
There's no point of origin indicated,
there's only 36 symbols on this gate.

1137
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:24,782
I'm assuming the ninth symbol represents
some x-factor distance equation.

1138
01:19:24,907 --> 01:19:26,893
Well, I don't care. Start dialing.

1139
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,573
Don't we want to bring
Dr. Rush in on this?

1140
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:31,706
Well, you said this wasn't
that hard to find?

1141
01:19:31,831 --> 01:19:32,683
No.

1142
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:35,659
Then he probably
already knows and didn't tell us.

1143
01:19:38,663 --> 01:19:39,740
No, no, no...

1144
01:19:39,865 --> 01:19:42,151
- What?
- Someone's dialing the gate.

1145
01:19:56,641 --> 01:19:57,796
Colonel Young.

1146
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:00,610
- You're up.
- Nice to see you, too, Rush.

1147
01:20:00,735 --> 01:20:02,588
I did order you to report to me.

1148
01:20:02,713 --> 01:20:04,295
Yes. What are you doing?

1149
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:05,800
We're trying to dial Earth.

1150
01:20:06,064 --> 01:20:09,011
- That would be a mistake.
- Riley thinks he's found the address.

1151
01:20:09,373 --> 01:20:11,992
His understanding of ancient
is marginal at best.

1152
01:20:12,117 --> 01:20:15,020
With respect, Doctor, I know enough
to recognize a reference to Earth.

1153
01:20:15,145 --> 01:20:17,500
He says the address
wasn't that hard to find, Rush.

1154
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:19,908
No, no, this is a complete
waste of power we may need.

1155
01:20:20,033 --> 01:20:22,984
We have the address back, all we need
is the right point of origin.

1156
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:24,399
And we've got 36 tries.

1157
01:20:24,524 --> 01:20:27,113
We barely have enough power to operate
the main systems.

1158
01:20:27,494 --> 01:20:30,487
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

1159
01:20:30,612 --> 01:20:33,565
- You see, that's news to me.
- He didn't tell me that either.

1160
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:36,006
I've only just learned myself,
you know what I'm doing.

1161
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:37,373
Even if it doesn't work

1162
01:20:37,696 --> 01:20:40,418
the people aboard this
ship need to see us at least try.

1163
01:20:40,818 --> 01:20:44,005
So what, you're gonna drain what little
power we have for the sake of morale?

1164
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:45,256
How ridiculous.

1165
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:51,612
What was that?

1166
01:20:55,449 --> 01:20:57,643
Anyone near the observation deck?

1167
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:08,654
Colonel, it looks like
we've dropped out of FTL.

1168
01:21:08,988 --> 01:21:10,644
Because we were draining power?

1169
01:21:10,961 --> 01:21:12,033
No, no.

1170
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:14,220
If I'm right,

1171
01:21:15,054 --> 01:21:17,121
the gate should begin to dial
any moment.

1172
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:25,932
How did you know that?

1173
01:21:26,944 --> 01:21:29,383
The ship detected a Stargate,

1174
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,025
on a planet within range
that may have what need.

1175
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:32,947
What?

1176
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:35,863
How the hell are there even
Stargates out here?

1177
01:21:36,973 --> 01:21:41,354
The Ancients sent out a number of
unmanned ships ahead of this one.

1178
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,550
They're programmed to gather data,

1179
01:21:43,675 --> 01:21:44,690
resources,

1180
01:21:45,094 --> 01:21:48,388
to manufacture Stargates, and
deposit them in habitable worlds.

1181
01:21:48,851 --> 01:21:52,114
Any relevant information is relayed
back here to help plot the course.

1182
01:21:52,849 --> 01:21:55,618
You're telling me that this
ship knows we're in trouble?

1183
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:57,453
Yes, because I told it we were.

1184
01:21:57,877 --> 01:21:59,908
Essentially,
we're flying on auto-pilot.

1185
01:22:01,211 --> 01:22:03,261
This ship may have stopped
when it was within range

1186
01:22:03,386 --> 01:22:05,044
of a Stargate regardless
of our need,

1187
01:22:05,831 --> 01:22:07,623
but I have reason to believe.

1188
01:22:12,834 --> 01:22:15,888
So, what we need is on the
other side of that wormhole.

1189
01:22:16,568 --> 01:22:18,684
An educated guess, yes.

1190
01:22:20,444 --> 01:22:22,242
There's only one way to find out.

1191
01:22:22,367 --> 01:22:25,147
Sir, you can't do that. We have
no idea what's on the other side.

1192
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:27,208
We can use the kino to find out.

1193
01:22:27,798 --> 01:22:30,069
I expect that's the
purpose of this device.

1194
01:22:37,766 --> 01:22:40,065
- I'm getting readings over here.
- What have we got?

1195
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:42,256
Temperature, gravity,

1196
01:22:42,381 --> 01:22:45,046
atmosphere composition,
barometric pressure...

1197
01:22:45,171 --> 01:22:47,051
Oxygen nitrogen, very little CO2,

1198
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:49,839
extremely low humidity.
Habitable, but just barely.

1199
01:22:50,241 --> 01:22:51,326
Good enough.

1200
01:22:51,451 --> 01:22:53,847
Looks like four other addresses
came up here, too.

1201
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,888
They could be other
planets within range.

1202
01:22:58,214 --> 01:23:00,161
Maybe we should think about
dialing them up...

1203
01:23:00,286 --> 01:23:01,714
No, they're locked out.

1204
01:23:01,839 --> 01:23:03,469
The ship chose this one.

1205
01:23:03,594 --> 01:23:06,397
The Stargate is open, all we
have to do is step through.

1206
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:08,955
What we have to do
is put a team together.

1207
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:15,150
- Looks like our time might be limited.
- What is it?

1208
01:23:15,594 --> 01:23:18,117
It's a countdown.
Just over 12 hours left.

1209
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:19,410
What happens then?

1210
01:23:20,206 --> 01:23:22,380
I suspect we jump back into FTL.

1211
01:23:30,557 --> 01:23:31,795
Palmer is a geologist.

1212
01:23:32,251 --> 01:23:33,583
Obviously, she should go.

1213
01:23:33,947 --> 01:23:36,280
Franklin and Brody are the best
of the rest of what we have.

1214
01:23:36,405 --> 01:23:39,718
- Thanks for the ringing endorsement.
- He didn't even mention me.

1215
01:23:39,843 --> 01:23:41,807
Franklin goes, the others stay.

1216
01:23:42,312 --> 01:23:44,852
We're still gonna need people
working on the problem from this end.

1217
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:46,676
I'd like to go.

1218
01:23:48,678 --> 01:23:49,482
Really?

1219
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:51,984
If I can help, then,

1220
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:54,028
- Colonel Young, please.
- What?

1221
01:23:54,373 --> 01:23:56,030
You don't think I can handle it?

1222
01:23:56,619 --> 01:23:59,367
- He's going.
- I've been off-world before.

1223
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:02,824
You have made a habit out of
pulling our asses out of the fire.

1224
01:24:02,949 --> 01:24:05,339
Eli, you want to go, you're going.

1225
01:24:07,306 --> 01:24:10,920
The only one I'm questioning right now,
is you, Dr. Rush.

1226
01:24:12,703 --> 01:24:16,092
Well, besides Palmer, I'm the only
one who knows what we're looking for.

1227
01:24:16,545 --> 01:24:18,969
We have 12 hours to find what
we need and get back on the ship.

1228
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:21,397
- Sure you can't stop it?
- We're just along for the ride.

1229
01:24:21,522 --> 01:24:23,641
Then we may all be better off
on the planet.

1230
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:26,602
That's another reason
why I should go.

1231
01:24:27,402 --> 01:24:30,356
Someone to assess whether long-term
survival there is even an option.

1232
01:24:31,144 --> 01:24:32,083
All right.

1233
01:24:34,857 --> 01:24:38,436
I want everyone clear that Scott
is in charge of this mission.

1234
01:24:38,902 --> 01:24:42,316
Let's gear up, let's find whatever
supplies we have, and move out.

1235
01:24:52,094 --> 01:24:54,189
- About Eli.
- He volunteered.

1236
01:24:54,314 --> 01:24:56,523
- He's not trained for this.
- Like a lot of the people

1237
01:24:56,648 --> 01:24:58,884
we got here. I'm gonna
need to know what they're made of.

1238
01:24:59,436 --> 01:25:00,557
He'll slow us down.

1239
01:25:00,682 --> 01:25:02,489
If he does,
you send him back to the gate.

1240
01:25:02,614 --> 01:25:05,432
Listen, if we're gonna make it,
and I'm not talking the next few hours

1241
01:25:05,557 --> 01:25:08,144
we're gonna need
everyone on board to step up.

1242
01:25:13,931 --> 01:25:15,192
Keep an eye on Rush.

1243
01:25:37,016 --> 01:25:38,132
We'll be back, sir.

1244
01:25:38,947 --> 01:25:39,884
Good luck.
