1
00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:03,210
This is what Destiny intended
from the moment it entered the system.

2
00:00:04,949 --> 00:00:08,841
We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,163
The ship came here for a reason.

4
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:15,435
<i>Destiny</i> is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,809
He and Young are bumping heads.

6
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,735
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

7
00:00:21,943 --> 00:00:23,365
We pretend nothing happened.

8
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:25,831
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:27,652
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:29,945
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:33,032
<i>What do you got, Lucian Alliance?</i>

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,750
<i>That would be my guess.
They haven't introduced themselves.</i>

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,038
<i>Any word on how
they gained intel on our base?</i>

14
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,706
<i>Casualties?</i>

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,125
<i>12. 80-plus MIA.</i>

16
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:45,795
I'm pregnant.

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,546
It's yours.

18
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,226
Ours.

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,509
I know that we've had
our differences in the past.

20
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:55,054
It was my duty to express concern
for how everyone else felt about you.

21
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:58,391
I've never even met your wife.

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,351
Telford, you connected with him.

23
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,521
Was it a residual memory of his
that transferred to my subconscious?

24
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:06,766
I would think you'd be doing everything
to get these people home,

25
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:08,441
to get yourself home,

26
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:09,902
back to your wife.

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,071
And I know
you're still sleeping with her.

28
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:07,589
You're up late.

29
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,760
I had a very interesting dream.

30
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:13,926
Everyone thinks theirs are interesting.
Nobody else cares.

31
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,740
You're going to care about this one.

32
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:24,043
I'm outside a warehouse, on Earth.

33
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:26,979
There's birds...

34
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,523
At least I can hear them.
Seagulls, I think.

35
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,237
I'm at some kind of meeting.
There's four or five people there.

36
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:37,448
- Who?
- I don't know.

37
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,909
But I'm giving them information.
Reports.

38
00:02:40,646 --> 00:02:41,452
Files.

39
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:43,287
I'm talking about Icarus.

40
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:44,907
In detail.

41
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,124
Who were they?

42
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:48,876
I don't know...

43
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:51,712
They had a Goa'uld cargo ship.

44
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:53,631
The Lucian Alliance on Earth?

45
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,924
I can only guess.

46
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,093
You were the spy who leaked everything
about Icarus to the Lucian Alliance?

47
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,930
- It wasn't me.
- What are you talking about?

48
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,224
On the way back to the car,
I seen my reflection.

49
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:09,355
It was Colonel Telford.

50
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,569
I was Colonel Telford.

51
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:26,038
Projet-SG (1.00)
www.projet-sg.com

52
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:29,329
Rush switched with him two days ago.

53
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:32,276
The only reason I am telling you
is because you are the only person

54
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:34,537
who's ever experienced this
kind of bleed-through memory

55
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:35,868
after using the stones.

56
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:38,884
It was just that once, Sir.
Certainly nothing like that.

57
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,520
Thanks, Lieutenant.

58
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:49,562
All right, look, Sir,

59
00:03:50,224 --> 00:03:53,664
I understand that you have your issues
with Colonel Telford,

60
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,526
- but you cannot...
- Sit down.

61
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,978
Before he was assigned to Icarus,

62
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:05,198
Telford spent a year undercover,
infiltrating the alliance.

63
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:09,452
You really think he would turn?

64
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:11,584
Eight months into his assignment,

65
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,395
there was an attack on a planet
that we had a large team working on,

66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
P2S 569.

67
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,679
37 people were killed.

68
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,634
Now, we later found out
that Telford knew about the attack,

69
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:22,928
and decided to do nothing.

70
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:26,056
In order to protect his cover.

71
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,436
That's what he said.

72
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,226
Stargate Command
let him off the hook,

73
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,270
and everything
was swept under the carpet.

74
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:32,553
But now...

75
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:34,675
Sir, there's got to be
more to it than that.

76
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,484
We know that the Goa'uld
had brainwashing technology,

77
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,528
could make a man
turn against his mother.

78
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:43,716
It is possible that the alliance
now has that capability.

79
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,119
If they do, Sir,
then we can't trust anyone.

80
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:52,291
We were just going over
some of the data we found when...

81
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,870
Take a break, Eli.

82
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,880
Secrets, you two...

83
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,173
Please, go.

84
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:07,622
So I talked to Scott.

85
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:09,928
He doesn't remember
anything like your dream.

86
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:11,545
We have to do something.

87
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:12,895
Agreed.

88
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:16,361
Telford's still on active rotation
with the stones, yeah?

89
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:20,194
He's due to make a connection
in a couple of days with Dr. Morrison.

90
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:24,156
- What if I take Morrison's place?
- And do what?

91
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:26,533
Make contact with the alliance.

92
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,751
It's risky.

93
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,664
It's a pretty good disguise,
being inside someone else's body.

94
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,592
- I'll go.
- That would be a mistake.

95
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,376
- Why's that?
- I had the dream.

96
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,170
There's still elements
I'm trying to piece together.

97
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,384
For example, there's a number, 314.

98
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:42,967
Now, I know it's significant,
but I don't know why.

99
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:45,502
If I'm there,
in Telford's environment, then...

100
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,597
- You're not trained for this.
- Who is?

101
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,099
I'll just have to do my best.

102
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,378
If Stargate Command
is this badly compromised,

103
00:05:54,503 --> 00:05:56,689
I can't tell anyone what you're up to,
do you understand?

104
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,357
Once you are on Earth,

105
00:05:58,631 --> 00:06:00,734
you are on your own, no back-up...

106
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,288
I get it.
Someone has to stop this guy.

107
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:05,072
He can't be allowed to continue.

108
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,088
The alliance probably already
know more about this ship than we do.

109
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,351
- Not much.
- I wouldn't underestimate them.

110
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:11,272
I'm not.

111
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,814
- I need a minute.
- That's about all I got.

112
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,046
Did you bump Dr. Morrison from his spot
on the communication stones?

113
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:23,882
Without consulting me?
Any particular reason?

114
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:27,074
You care to enlighten me?

115
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:33,017
With everything
that we have been through,

116
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:34,893
you really want to do this?

117
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,172
I've got good reason
not to tell you, or I would.

118
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,189
You're going to have to trust me.

119
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:01,949
Welcome back.

120
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:04,391
I'm staff Sergeant Graham.
I'll be your escort.

121
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:06,877
Right.

122
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:24,980
I want to talk to
Colonel Young, now.

123
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:28,280
He is busy at the moment, Sir,
but he said he'd come see you shortly.

124
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,462
Why was I connected with Dr. Rush?

125
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:32,317
That wasn't part of the schedule.

126
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:34,036
Sorry. It was unavoidable.

127
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,079
Why?

128
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:40,367
Dr. Rush had to consult with some people
regarding some technical problems.

129
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:48,062
You're a terrible liar, Lieutenant.

130
00:07:48,187 --> 00:07:49,837
I'd like some fatigues.

131
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:53,106
No problem. This way, Sir.

132
00:08:15,717 --> 00:08:17,412
I need to speak to General O'Neill.

133
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,256
And you are?

134
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:21,961
Colonel Everett Young,
authentication 1619414.

135
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,085
It's urgent.

136
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,569
Everett, I'll have you know

137
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:27,240
I'm missing a national
security briefing for this.

138
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:28,874
Sorry about that, Sir.

139
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:32,582
If you'd ever been to one,
you wouldn't say that.

140
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:36,431
- What's up?
- It's Dr. Rush.

141
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:40,644
He's in the body of Colonel Telford.
Probably hasn't even left the building.

142
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:42,938
- So?
- We need to put a tail on him.

143
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,971
- He's got an escort.
- He'll ditch the escort.

144
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:47,985
We should let him do it,
then follow him.

145
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:49,319
Why?

146
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,738
He's about to make contact
with the Lucian Alliance.

147
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,624
I didn't know you could sew.

148
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:11,800
I can't.

149
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:13,309
Not really.

150
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,992
I hope it doesn't fall apart.

151
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:17,556
It's beautiful, thank you.

152
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,676
Open this one.

153
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:26,503
Can we talk to you for a second?

154
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,140
You made this yourself?

155
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:35,240
If it's a girl,
I can make something else.

156
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,950
No, It's perfect!

157
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,142
- What's going on?
- We're hoping you could tell us.

158
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,459
About Rush?
Going back to Earth on the stones?

159
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,491
I'm sure there's a good reason.

160
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:51,506
- That's what we're afraid of.
- They didn't say anything to you?

161
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,629
Young came in to talk to him
the other day...

162
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,140
- They did kick me out.
- We heard Young went, too.

163
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:02,017
He did?

164
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,419
He's there right now.

165
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:05,520
Something's definitely going on.

166
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,167
Camile, if I could have
a moment of your time, please?

167
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:26,041
- Were you aware of the change...
- We could check those...

168
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,875
Control interface room...

169
00:10:28,257 --> 00:10:30,465
I could meet you guys at the...

170
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,804
I believe you've witnessed
this brainwashing technology.

171
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:44,604
That's true.

172
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:48,730
I recommend we keep the number of people
we bring in on this to a minimum.

173
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,400
Thank you, Colonel,
for stating the obvious.

174
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:55,898
You took a bit of a chance
by telling me, didn't you?

175
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,397
I had to, Sir.

176
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,060
Rush was asking for a free pass.

177
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:01,300
An unscheduled,
unauthorized visit to Earth.

178
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:03,772
The sort of thing he might do
if he was the mole himself.

179
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,872
If he's the mole,
why would he be trying

180
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,791
to frame Telford at this point?

181
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:10,440
- I can't answer that, Sir.
- And if he's telling the truth?

182
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:13,213
Hopefully he'll still be able
to lead us to the alliance.

183
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:15,007
And not lose his life.

184
00:11:17,882 --> 00:11:19,970
I've quite a few
personal things to attend to.

185
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,847
- I'll be a few minutes.
- Not to worry.

186
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:23,605
I came prepared.

187
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:24,588
So, do you know
what they're going to do to Rush?

188
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,847
They didn't let me know.

189
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:31,822
They're trying to
keep me out of the loop.

190
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:32,947
It's not...

191
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:36,648
Where have you been?

192
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,176
It's nice to see you too.

193
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:40,944
Come with me.
We have some things to discuss.

194
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:43,196
Do we?

195
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:44,448
Privately.

196
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,845
We haven't seen you in a while, Colonel.
I hope everything is well.

197
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,634
- I've been on assignment.
- Of course.

198
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:10,150
I'll give you some privacy.

199
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:42,711
Yeah, this is Telford.

200
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,133
I have some new information.
We have to meet.

201
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:50,860
<i>Stand by for instructions.</i>

202
00:15:03,743 --> 00:15:04,743
Get in.

203
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,670
- You're allowing alcohol onboard now?
- I doubt I could stop it.

204
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:25,131
So I can report your command
of this ship is solid as ever, then?

205
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:28,552
I am doing my best to make it work.

206
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:36,299
- Why did I connect with Rush?
- Oh, we'll get to that.

207
00:15:36,424 --> 00:15:39,479
I think we need
to clear the air a little bit.

208
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:43,220
Have another.

209
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:44,893
I'm on duty.
You're on duty.

210
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,377
We're both a billion light years away
from the nearest disciplinary hearing.

211
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:51,579
So, what, you afraid
of what you might say?

212
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:56,485
I don't have anything to hide,
from you or anyone else.

213
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,520
Is that so?

214
00:15:59,516 --> 00:16:03,111
I could've brought you up on charges.
You should just thank me and let it go.

215
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:05,607
Well, I think we both know
that you don't want the details

216
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,841
of that little incident getting out
any more than I do.

217
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:10,635
You cheated on your wife,
and she moved on. End of story.

218
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,397
You took advantage

219
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:14,806
to get back at me
on a personal level.

220
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:20,979
You were sleeping with an officer
under your command!

221
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:24,061
I mean, look at you, Everett.
You're a disgrace.

222
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:25,900
But I'm here, right?

223
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:30,193
And that's...
That's what's killing you, isn't it?

224
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:33,492
Because this was
supposed to be your prize.

225
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,994
Your reward for all that hard work.

226
00:16:36,422 --> 00:16:38,859
An entire year living
with those criminals,

227
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:41,958
thieves, murderers,
pretending to be one of them,

228
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,236
I mean, that's got to take its toll.

229
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:46,611
I'm not doing this again.

230
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:50,988
The man I used to know would not let
37 people die to cover his own ass.

231
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:53,678
What changed?

232
00:16:55,778 --> 00:16:57,453
What happened to you, David?

233
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:03,688
Thanks for the drink.

234
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:23,041
What are we doing?

235
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:25,377
We're waiting, what else?

236
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,610
<i>Daniel, come in.
Do you read?</i>

237
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:47,860
What is it?

238
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:51,361
Carter says they're using
some kind of jamming device.

239
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,571
We can't get a lock
on anyone in the area.

240
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,426
- <i>What's your status?</i>
- They've stopped.

241
00:17:55,551 --> 00:17:57,082
Looks like we're waiting on someone.

242
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:59,244
<i>Well, ground assault is standing by.</i>

243
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,162
They'll move when you call it.

244
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:05,417
Hang on.

245
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:22,016
Who are you?

246
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:24,853
- Sorry, I don't know what you mean.
- All right.

247
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:26,396
Who am I?

248
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:31,317
Whoever you are, you must be using
the Ancient communication stones.

249
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:35,321
- What are you talking about?
- You failed to use the proper code.

250
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,198
Telford would never
make such a mistake.

251
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:45,463
His cover's blown.
Move in. Move in now.

252
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:46,708
They have a ship.

253
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:06,853
Go! Go!

254
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:13,169
We're too late.

255
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:24,454
You okay?

256
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,170
I'm fine.

257
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:38,761
What chance does this baby have
of ever living a normal life?

258
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,265
What's normal anyway?

259
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,959
I don't know,
but I don't think it's this.

260
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,026
Look,

261
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,364
I know right now it seems

262
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:03,368
impossible
that we will ever make it back.

263
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,584
But I also know
that since we've been here,

264
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:10,092
it seems like we're averaging
about five impossible things a week.

265
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,550
So why assume the worst?

266
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:18,763
Look, at the very least,
there are a lot of people here

267
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:21,030
who are going to care
about that baby.

268
00:20:23,076 --> 00:20:24,486
That's something.

269
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:31,055
We are all going to help you.

270
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:33,859
Thanks, Chloe.

271
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,401
Come here.

272
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,575
According to our intelligence,
her name is Kiva.

273
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,460
She's the daughter of a Lucian
Alliance warlord named Massin.

274
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:49,175
One of the higher-ups.
Powerful and brutal.

275
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,832
That intel come from Telford?

276
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,709
At least we know
who the mole is, eh?

277
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,395
There's an easy way to end this.
We cut the connection on the stones.

278
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,521
They get Telford back, we're no closer
to figuring out what they're up to.

279
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:01,509
- Dr. Rush's life is in danger.
- He volunteered. He knew the risks.

280
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:05,835
That ship slipped past our sensors.
We have no idea where it's going.

281
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,158
Telford might, and he may know more.

282
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:10,435
I'm just asking for the chance
to get it out of him.

283
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,105
He still has rights, doesn't he?

284
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,706
He didn't say
how he was going to do it.

285
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:18,557
With all due respect,
you and I both know

286
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:21,487
the people who made the rules
were not prepared for this.

287
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:45,905
I'm sorry.

288
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,009
I know that really hurts.

289
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:51,726
Well, I suppose it was worth it.

290
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:53,600
I had to make it look good.

291
00:21:55,808 --> 00:21:58,949
Of course I didn't give
them the code on purpose.

292
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:01,527
- I'm not a complete idiot.
- On purpose?

293
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,237
What are you talking about?

294
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,395
They were getting suspicious.

295
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,272
I was beginning to have
concerns about that myself.

296
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:10,036
Well, that's why I had to come in.

297
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:12,997
I wasn't sure
whether I was being followed.

298
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,583
I figured

299
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,590
if they thought
I was being taken by force,

300
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:21,047
it might help us salvage something
from this operation.

301
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,580
Nice try.

302
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:27,780
You almost managed to make that
sound convincing.

303
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:31,766
Well, it sounds convincing
because it's true.

304
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:34,519
If you really are colonel Telford,

305
00:22:35,178 --> 00:22:36,580
you'll know my name.

306
00:22:43,646 --> 00:22:44,646
It's Kiva.

307
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,823
Good.

308
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:48,767
Next question.

309
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,830
What's yours?

310
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:55,267
A spy?

311
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,543
A Lucian Alliance spy?

312
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:04,082
You are so desperate to get back at me
that you would say or do anything.

313
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:05,299
We have proof.

314
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,635
Oh, come on, Everett,
this is all about me and Emily.

315
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,595
How do you think
I found out about that?

316
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,474
You switched bodies with Scott,
do you remember that?

317
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,395
He's the one who told me.

318
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,018
He saw it, in his mind, a vision.

319
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:22,108
Call it residual memory,
whatever you want.

320
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,193
It seems that every time
you use the stones,

321
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,606
you leave a little something behind.

322
00:23:28,263 --> 00:23:30,969
Maybe...
Maybe that's guilt.

323
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:33,536
Maybe, deep down inside,

324
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,413
you want the truth to come out.

325
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:43,420
- You're insane.
- Well, you've already confessed.

326
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:45,589
You just won't admit it.

327
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,172
We'll let him sweat a while.

328
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:56,851
Give me a shot, sir.

329
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,308
Won't take long.

330
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:00,405
Appreciate the enthusiasm, Sergeant.

331
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,560
Not yet.

332
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,413
I would really prefer
not to have to do this.

333
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:23,951
I wish I had time to convince you
that I'm not what you think I am.

334
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:25,514
And what's that?

335
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:29,842
I'm a reasonable person just trying
to do what's right for my people.

336
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,196
You make a terrible
first impression.

337
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:34,592
We have brainwashing technologies.

338
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,144
I could try those, but I'm not sure
what they'd do under the circumstances,

339
00:24:40,822 --> 00:24:43,045
with your consciousness
in somebody else's body.

340
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:46,768
Unfortunately, I've learned one thing
about torture over the years.

341
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:49,362
It's... effective.

342
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:55,830
Barbaric, I know, and I hate
lowering myself to this level,

343
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,207
but I need to know who you are,

344
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:02,857
and beyond that, whether or not
you're any use to me.

345
00:25:21,273 --> 00:25:23,062
Has he been given any food or water?

346
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:24,578
Open it.

347
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:28,077
- Maybe I should go in there with you...
- That will not be necessary.

348
00:25:28,202 --> 00:25:29,638
This is on me, only me.

349
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:30,763
Open it.

350
00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:42,702
You can't keep me in here forever.

351
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:45,015
No one's pulling the plug
on the stones, so...

352
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,378
Why don't you just admit what you did,
and we can move on?

353
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,889
I want to talk to Scott.
I have a right to face my accuser.

354
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:51,753
This didn't come from Scott.

355
00:25:52,078 --> 00:25:53,509
You switched with Rush,

356
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:55,076
remember?

357
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:56,012
Rush?

358
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:57,972
This is coming from Rush?

359
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,849
At first,
I didn't believe him either.

360
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:02,396
I figured I'd give enough
rope to hang himself,

361
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:03,477
but guess what?

362
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,354
That didn't happen.

363
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,099
What's that?

364
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:15,702
Airman Dunning brought it along
with his personal effects.

365
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:17,283
Do you recognize them?

366
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:20,912
They were all stationed on Icarus.
The fire suppression team.

367
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,332
They got trapped during the attack
when a corridor collapsed.

368
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,989
They all burned alive,
every last one of them.

369
00:26:29,136 --> 00:26:31,701
You take a good look.

370
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:32,715
Take a look.

371
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:35,301
I want you to look at their faces,
because you killed them.

372
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,577
You killed them as if you'd doused them
with gasoline and lit the match,

373
00:26:38,702 --> 00:26:40,710
and they weren't the only ones.

374
00:26:40,835 --> 00:26:44,143
So we know that you are
a traitor and a murder.

375
00:26:45,014 --> 00:26:46,938
Now we know you're a coward, too.

376
00:26:57,427 --> 00:26:58,893
All right, that's enough!

377
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,453
Stand down, Sergeant!
I said stand down!

378
00:27:03,876 --> 00:27:05,178
Get out, both of you!

379
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:06,889
Get out!

380
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:25,575
So...

381
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,479
Where were we?

382
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:37,822
This will eventually kill you.

383
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:40,325
You'll be killing Telford too.

384
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,265
That might just work out for the best
given that he's been compromised.

385
00:27:43,937 --> 00:27:46,660
I have a full rundown
of the personnel aboard <i>Destiny</i>,

386
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,283
and I doubt very much that civilians or
the scientists would have endured this,

387
00:27:50,408 --> 00:27:53,117
so the question is
whether or not Colonel Young

388
00:27:53,242 --> 00:27:56,339
would have put himself
in this situation, or...

389
00:27:56,464 --> 00:27:58,590
send his first Lieutenant, Scott?

390
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,514
How do you know
I'm someone aboard <i>Destiny</i>?

391
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,668
That's a fair question.

392
00:28:08,078 --> 00:28:10,208
You can make this stop.

393
00:28:13,315 --> 00:28:15,011
If I answer your question,

394
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,363
you're going to kill me.

395
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:19,514
Either way I'm dead.

396
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:20,656
I won't.

397
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:23,075
You have my word.

398
00:28:23,626 --> 00:28:25,338
You have nothing to lose.

399
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,128
I'm Dr. Nicholas Rush.

400
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:47,413
I want this connection cut
and go back to my own body.

401
00:28:47,538 --> 00:28:48,601
No, you don't.

402
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,146
You go back now, your friends
at the Alliance won't be happy.

403
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:55,232
- I don't have friends in the Alliance.
- Not anymore you don't.

404
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:59,030
Your only hope is with us.
You come clean now, I will help you.

405
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:02,740
I am not a spy, Everett!
How many times do I have to tell you?

406
00:29:10,489 --> 00:29:11,852
Recognize it?

407
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,590
Should I?

408
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,258
It's your work.

409
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:25,330
To do with dialing the ninth chevron
that leads to <i>Destiny</i>.

410
00:29:29,652 --> 00:29:30,726
These readings...

411
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,645
Similar Naquadria deposits.

412
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:35,231
We had some issues
adapting the equations,

413
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,316
there should be enough power
to get us there.

414
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:43,322
You've found another Icarus planet.

415
00:29:45,615 --> 00:29:47,076
Let's talk about the outpost.

416
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,823
P2S 569.

417
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,416
We've been through this.
I was cleared of any wrongdoing.

418
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,509
'Cause they didn't have
all the facts.

419
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,621
I couldn't blow my cover.
I didn't have a choice!

420
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:04,005
Remember
that little combat engineer?

421
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,262
She used to follow you around
like a puppy.

422
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:09,223
She was hit in the first blast.

423
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:11,459
Right arm severed at the shoulder.

424
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:14,478
She's screaming, yelling,
begging me to help her.

425
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:17,665
All I could do was watch her
bleed to death in the dirt.

426
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,410
It wasn't my fault.

427
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,525
Now, we already know you did it,

428
00:30:22,143 --> 00:30:24,587
but it's possible
you're not responsible.

429
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,237
What are you talking about?

430
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:29,535
Think about it.

431
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:30,816
Think about it.

432
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:33,503
Why is it that the memory transfer
happens only with you

433
00:30:33,628 --> 00:30:36,208
and only you and no one else
when they use the stones?

434
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,210
They messed with your head, David.

435
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,754
They made you think
you were one of them, and you're not.

436
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:43,340
That's not you.
Now, we can help you.

437
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,034
We can bring you back.

438
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:48,012
But I need you
to take the first step.

439
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:50,097
You tell us

440
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,765
where they're taking Rush.

441
00:30:56,843 --> 00:30:57,857
Tell me.

442
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:14,059
We've replicated it
as best we could.

443
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:15,707
Olan!

444
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:19,907
Meet Dr. Rush.

445
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:25,412
Olan is one of our lead scientists
working on the project.

446
00:31:25,537 --> 00:31:27,301
Your work is impressive.

447
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,013
It was nothing, really.

448
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,972
When I found out
that you were on your way...

449
00:31:32,097 --> 00:31:35,554
We're all very excited
to have Dr. Rush's full cooperation.

450
00:31:36,032 --> 00:31:38,354
Maybe now
we'll actually make a connection.

451
00:31:44,396 --> 00:31:45,736
As you can see,

452
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,373
we've procured
some familiar technology.

453
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:51,456
It was necessary
to implement your methods.

454
00:31:51,854 --> 00:31:53,577
I trust it will suffice?

455
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:55,412
I'll leave you to your work.

456
00:31:59,227 --> 00:32:02,378
The figures for these Naquadria deposits
are correct, yes?

457
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:03,255
Yes.

458
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,140
'Cause if they're out
even by a fraction...

459
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:07,362
We spent months
doing a detailed orbital survey.

460
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:09,635
We mapped every deposit down
to the last vein.

461
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:15,010
All right, then, I'm done.

462
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:16,737
Really?

463
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,145
It's not that difficult
when you know what you're doing.

464
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,147
- But...
- I'm kidding.

465
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:24,692
This is probably going
to take some time.

466
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:27,361
Of course.

467
00:32:28,508 --> 00:32:30,693
Quite possibly
the rest of my life...

468
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:45,640
There's a lot of talk around the ship
about what's going on in that room.

469
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:47,506
This is a military matter, ma'am.

470
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,244
It doesn't concern you.

471
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:50,610
That's the kind of talk

472
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,911
that forced us to try
and take control of this ship before.

473
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:05,858
Do you want the rumors to spread,
or do you want to do something about it?

474
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,221
It'll be over soon enough,
that is all you need to know.

475
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,321
See, that's the wrong answer.

476
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:12,440
Come on, Lieutenant.

477
00:33:12,565 --> 00:33:16,160
Something tells me
you do not want this on your conscience.

478
00:33:16,685 --> 00:33:17,995
Better be careful.

479
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,032
Whatever it is,
we all have to live with it.

480
00:33:29,162 --> 00:33:31,187
I need to communicate
with Stargate Command.

481
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:34,179
- Do we let him out...
- Nobody in or out. That is an order.

482
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,791
I want to talk to him.

483
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:48,442
Progress?

484
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,903
None yet.
You must be joking.

485
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,029
You're stalling.

486
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:54,227
If you want to blow yourselves up,
you go right ahead.

487
00:33:54,352 --> 00:33:55,714
You along with us.

488
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,702
This is going to take time,
and I don't just mean a few hours.

489
00:33:59,055 --> 00:34:01,163
But Olan said we've been close
for months now.

490
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,707
I assumed that with your help,
we'd be able to...

491
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,753
With all due respect to Olan here,
his work is shoddy at best.

492
00:34:08,373 --> 00:34:10,214
Sorry, you're just going
to have to trust me.

493
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:13,842
The whole thing's a bloody mess.
I may have to start from scratch.

494
00:34:32,248 --> 00:34:33,872
You call yourself reasonable?

495
00:34:33,997 --> 00:34:34,822
I am.

496
00:34:35,327 --> 00:34:36,782
You said he was incompetent.

497
00:34:38,165 --> 00:34:39,576
I was stalling.

498
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:40,953
Right.

499
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:44,832
I shouldn't have to demonstrate
how important this is to me.

500
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:47,334
To all of us, Dr. Rush.

501
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:50,618
No more chances.

502
00:34:55,044 --> 00:34:56,329
Now what's happening?

503
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,929
We're not sure.

504
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,853
Young's been back and forth
on the stones all day.

505
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:05,455
Looks like this time
he brought someone back with him.

506
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,233
Who is it?

507
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,394
Welcome to the <i>Destiny</i>, General.

508
00:35:22,524 --> 00:35:23,370
Corporal?

509
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,478
Sorry about that, sir. This way.

510
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:49,423
Who's this?

511
00:35:55,426 --> 00:35:56,623
It's really him.

512
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,110
Let's say it's true.

513
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:06,205
I'm being held without charge.
I've been denied counsel.

514
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,916
- And one of his men attacked me.
- David, he knows.

515
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,459
He authorized it.

516
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,904
Maybe not that last part there.

517
00:36:15,986 --> 00:36:17,883
This is what I've been trying
to tell you.

518
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:21,554
Time to come clean, son.

519
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,945
We need to know
where they've taken Rush.

520
00:36:28,492 --> 00:36:30,503
You checked out
that gate address I gave you?

521
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:32,773
Dead end.

522
00:36:38,418 --> 00:36:40,705
You didn't think I'd give you
anything real, did you?

523
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:45,285
You should see your face.

524
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:47,554
You look so surprised.

525
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:50,040
Actually, I'm disappointed.

526
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:52,134
I was actually holding out hope

527
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:55,676
that it might not be true,
that there was some other explanation.

528
00:36:56,034 --> 00:36:57,130
It doesn't matter.

529
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,656
You can't stop it.

530
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:00,425
Stop...

531
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,010
What?

532
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,111
Here you go.

533
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:22,999
I wouldn't say it was good.

534
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:28,120
What's it like?

535
00:37:29,473 --> 00:37:31,987
We've heard descriptions,
but what's it like being there?

536
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:33,292
On <i>Destiny</i>?

537
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:35,707
You've flown around
in space ships before.

538
00:37:35,832 --> 00:37:37,254
Not an Ancient ship.

539
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,847
Not that far out
into the unknown universe.

540
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:43,499
It's a rust bucket,
what can I tell you?

541
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,597
I can't wait to see it for myself.

542
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,847
What if I can't do it?

543
00:37:53,592 --> 00:37:56,017
What if we just fail
to make a connection?

544
00:37:56,518 --> 00:37:59,109
Kiva promised she wouldn't kill you.
Her word is good.

545
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:03,998
I'll have to kill you myself.

546
00:38:16,246 --> 00:38:17,669
You think I was brainwashed?

547
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:19,780
I came to my senses.

548
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,346
We freed billions of people
from thousands of years of slavery

549
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:25,917
all over our galaxy.

550
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:30,015
Then we patted ourselves on the back,
we left them with no means for survival.

551
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,964
What did we think
was going to happen?

552
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:34,686
- This isn't you, David.
- Wake up, Everett!

553
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:38,523
You think the Lucian Alliance
are just a bunch of criminals?

554
00:38:39,045 --> 00:38:40,943
Who made us judge and jury?

555
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,694
People will do
what they have to do to survive.

556
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:46,622
You should know that by now.

557
00:38:49,672 --> 00:38:51,334
We take whatever we want.

558
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:53,851
We do whatever is good for us

559
00:38:53,976 --> 00:38:56,500
regardless of the impact
on other planets!

560
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,835
What makes us so special?

561
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,607
I know what makes me special.

562
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,989
This is not our ship.

563
00:39:09,953 --> 00:39:11,609
It wasn't intended for us.

564
00:39:11,734 --> 00:39:14,112
Where are they taking Rush?

565
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:17,278
It was supposed to be
for the benefit of all mankind.

566
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,363
He's more far gone
than I thought, General.

567
00:39:21,211 --> 00:39:22,526
I've heard enough.

568
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:25,153
Probably take it to the next level.

569
00:39:26,552 --> 00:39:28,447
Go ahead and do what you need to do.

570
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,412
Communications room, this is Young.

571
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,663
<i>Please cut the General's connection.</i>

572
00:39:44,725 --> 00:39:46,154
Dismissed, Corporal.

573
00:39:58,365 --> 00:40:01,431
This has gone on long enough.
You have to cut the connection.

574
00:40:01,556 --> 00:40:02,440
I can't.

575
00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:04,546
Dr. Rush's life is in danger.

576
00:40:04,671 --> 00:40:08,073
That's more important than getting intel
on the Lucian Alliance!

577
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,035
I just thought maybe
we'd be better off if she knew.

578
00:40:14,276 --> 00:40:15,390
This is Young.

579
00:40:16,187 --> 00:40:17,300
This is Brody.

580
00:40:17,661 --> 00:40:19,958
<i>Bring up the life support controls
for this section.</i>

581
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,176
<i>I got it.</i>

582
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,468
Begin venting the atmosphere
in Colonel Telford's quarters now.

583
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:35,579
Say again?

584
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,611
Begin venting
Colonel Telford's quarters now.

585
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,500
- What the hell are you doing?
- Camile, stay out of this.

586
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,514
He can't do this!

587
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,905
David, can you hear me?

588
00:40:52,513 --> 00:40:53,867
It's got to be a bluff.

589
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,660
To scare him.

590
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:02,897
You can't...

591
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,263
I'm venting the atmosphere
in your room!

592
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,508
You've got five minutes
before you die of suffocation.

593
00:41:26,462 --> 00:41:27,609
Your only hope

594
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:30,810
is to tell me
the location of the Alliance base.

595
00:41:30,935 --> 00:41:32,172
You're bluffing!

596
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,616
- Kill me, and you kill Rush!
- I know.

597
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,869
But right now, I'm thinking
of the greater good.

598
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,207
What's it going to be?

599
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:06,231
Open this damn door!

600
00:42:09,936 --> 00:42:12,237
We both know
you're not going to kill me.
