1
00:00:00,854 --> 00:00:01,940
<i>Destiny.</i>

2
00:00:02,065 --> 00:00:03,544
The design is clearly Ancient,

3
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:06,045
launched hundreds
of thousands of years ago.

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,646
Where the hell are we?

5
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:09,765
Several billion light years
from home.

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,579
We are on a ship,
but we have no idea where we are

7
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:13,939
in relation to Earth.

8
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:16,724
This ship could be
the most important discovery

9
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:19,170
mankind has made
since the Stargate itself.

10
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:21,410
These are the wrong people,
in the wrong place.

11
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:23,618
We've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

12
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:26,086
We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

13
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:29,737
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

14
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,891
I read about these Chinese miners

15
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:39,884
that survived a cave-in for six days
by drinking their urine.

16
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,291
I'm gonna go ahead
and pretend I didn't hear.

17
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:45,753
You know what they ate?
Coal.

18
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:49,069
- Coal?
- It's a true story.

19
00:00:49,594 --> 00:00:51,509
Don't get me wrong,
it was pretty stupid.

20
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:52,885
Almost killed them.

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,162
Water level's down.

22
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,370
Nobody went near that compartment
on your watch?

23
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:58,486
Spencer asked
if he could have a look in the tank.

24
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:01,018
- Why?
- He's a crazy person.

25
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:02,013
Sir.

26
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:03,562
I said no.

27
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:06,431
Nobody goes in there
without my authorization.

28
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,905
Maybe it evaporated
when we went through the star.

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,204
- It's a closed system.
- All that water went somewhere.

30
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:17,353
We're down to half of what we had
when we got here.

31
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:18,868
I don't understand this.

32
00:01:18,993 --> 00:01:21,068
You're the one trying to get
the recycling system up.

33
00:01:21,193 --> 00:01:24,091
- Maybe there's a leak somewhere.
- Ship says it's fine.

34
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:26,919
- If what you're saying is accurate...
- It is.

35
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,963
- We've got a serious problem.
- We wouldn't.

36
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:32,975
- If you did what I asked you to do.
- Can we stick to one problem at a time?

37
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,949
Running out of water wouldn't matter
if we just dial Earth and go home.

38
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:38,281
- I explained that to you.
- The ship's recharged.

39
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:40,855
- The power reserves are full.
- That's the point, they're not!

40
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,001
Where are we at?

41
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:45,278
Probably about less than 40%
of original design capacity.

42
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:47,982
I can't tell when someone
pulls a number out of his ass?

43
00:01:48,427 --> 00:01:49,234
What?

44
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,765
I actually pulled that number
out of my ass.

45
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,238
He's not making it up.

46
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:59,785
If Destiny was ever capable
of dialing back to Earth,

47
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:03,476
it was thousands of years ago,
when the Ancients intended to come here.

48
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:04,617
But not now.

49
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:06,603
You're right.
We have a problem.

50
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:07,956
- Yes.
- Again.

51
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:15,468
Get Brody in on this.
He's an engineer.

52
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:17,812
I need to borrow, Eli.

53
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:26,762
- 40,000 liters?
- That's what I heard.

54
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:28,817
We didn't drink it.

55
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:31,296
It wouldn't surprise me

56
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:33,752
if there was more water
than they're telling us.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,500
They're hoarding it?

58
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,942
It's a big ship.

59
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:38,695
You know the military.

60
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,529
Long as they control the water supply,
they control us.

61
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,331
Yeah,

62
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,099
<i>I'm talking about you.</i>

63
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,654
Those two are harmless.

64
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:55,059
Keep it up.
I need to know who I can trust.

65
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:57,635
I feel like a spy.

66
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:02,139
Clean this room up.

67
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:04,894
Right.

68
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:27,248
Projet-SG (1.00)

69
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,981
- What is it?
- Nothing, sir.

70
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:54,302
Just had a strange feeling.

71
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,153
- We just dropped out of FTL.
- Wasn't that.

72
00:03:58,653 --> 00:04:01,250
I'm on my way to the gate room.
There's a planet in range.

73
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,375
Come on.

74
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:11,197
- What have we got?
- There's only one planet in range.

75
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:13,151
The ship's already dialed it up.

76
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:15,007
We're getting readings now.

77
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,869
Looks like
we entered the Hoth system.

78
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:22,052
<i>Empire strikes back</i>.

79
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:24,889
The second <i>Star Wars</i> movie.

80
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,941
I refuse to call it <i>Episode V</i>.

81
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,893
Minus 47 degrees Celsius.

82
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:30,294
Bundle up.

83
00:04:30,907 --> 00:04:32,311
Is that water ice?

84
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,387
But the atmosphere
is dangerously thin.

85
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:37,067
And poisonous.
13% molecular oxygen,

86
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,538
95% carbon dioxide,
with a hint of argon.

87
00:04:40,437 --> 00:04:41,940
Nasty planet.

88
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:43,676
The only candidate within range.

89
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:45,939
We're gonna have to use
the spacesuits we found.

90
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:48,871
But if that brings back
a half a ton of ice, I'll take it.

91
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:50,721
Shut it down for now.

92
00:04:53,184 --> 00:04:54,960
Lieutenant Scott, come in, please.

93
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,037
There a reason your radio's off?

94
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,479
Come in.

95
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:16,482
Colonel Young is looking for you.

96
00:05:16,877 --> 00:05:19,457
- I think I'd better...
- Go, go.

97
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,592
What, you couldn't find
a broom closet?

98
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:44,798
We're still working on the other suits.
We're close to having a third one ready.

99
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:47,215
- How close?
- A day, maybe?

100
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,056
We'll be back in FTL by then.

101
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:51,614
Well, they're not in great shape.

102
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:53,852
All these years,
there's bound to be degradation.

103
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,854
Keep at it,
we're going to need them.

104
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,692
Looks like
it's just you and me, then.

105
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,551
I could take Kennair, sir.

106
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:08,075
- She's done EVAs before, you're...
- I'm fine.

107
00:06:10,852 --> 00:06:12,298
How are we gonna cut the ice?

108
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:17,622
Plasma cutter.
Should cut through the ice like butter.

109
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:20,497
Just don't get the business end
anywhere near you.

110
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,725
Suit radios are voice-activated
between you.

111
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:25,843
Press here

112
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,762
if you want to tie
into the ship's communication systems.

113
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,850
You're in command while we're gone.

114
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:36,353
- Is everybody clear on that?
- I'm sure we'll manage.

115
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,431
Start dialing.

116
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:48,115
Assuming a fair amount
of physical activity,

117
00:06:48,704 --> 00:06:50,784
you have just over eight hours
of air.

118
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,488
It's what, 11 hours
until the next jump to FTL, right?

119
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:57,720
Don't worry. You'll run out of air
long before we leave you behind.

120
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,193
Thanks.

121
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:28,010
Beautiful?

122
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:31,373
One deep breath, and you're dead.

123
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,666
<i>Destiny, this is Young. Come in.</i>

124
00:08:05,907 --> 00:08:07,712
Yes, sir, we hear you five by five.

125
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:10,943
<i>I've just tested the ice
by the Stargate.</i>

126
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:13,659
<i>I read concentrations of ammonia</i>

127
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:16,250
<i>and several other toxic chemicals.</i>

128
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,746
How high are the readings?

129
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:20,999
Off the charts.

130
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,752
You could try looking
farther afield.

131
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:29,049
Maybe on the other side
of that lake.

132
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,926
Is that really a good idea?

133
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,845
<i>The further from the gate we go,
the less ice we can bring back.</i>

134
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,558
I've got just the thing.
Give me two minutes.

135
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,269
Colonel, give us five.
Eli has an idea.

136
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:45,452
Maybe there's fresh water
in the lake under the ice.

137
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,479
At minus 47,

138
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:49,945
the ice will be 10 feet deep.

139
00:08:50,554 --> 00:08:52,656
We're better off finding
a pressure ridge.

140
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:55,893
Sounds like
you've done something like this before.

141
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:58,068
A million times.

142
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:03,341
Did you feel that?

143
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,043
It's just a tremor.

144
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:08,312
You know,
the last planet I was on exploded.

145
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:11,720
Destiny, this is Young.
We're burning through suit air.

146
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,760
What's going on
with this bright idea?

147
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:18,220
Here we come, people!

148
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:19,349
Here we come!

149
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:22,811
Sorry, it's impossible
to steer by remote.

150
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:26,276
That's fantastic, Eli.
What made you come up with that?

151
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,986
Actually, it represents
my most recent attempt to fly,

152
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,070
but it should carry a ton of ice.

153
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:34,812
Colonel, we're sending through
Eli's latest invention.

154
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:46,157
I love it!

155
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,213
The man gets a gold star.

156
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,259
<i>How much will it hold?</i>

157
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,300
More than you can carry by yourself.

158
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:56,957
All right, we're heading out.
Keep the gate active.

159
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:59,527
We'll radio back
when we find something.

160
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,896
Sir?

161
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:07,207
- <i>Listen, if we don't make it back...</i>
- You will.

162
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:10,214
We're two guys
in million-year-old space suits

163
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,110
walking around alone
on an ice planet.

164
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,279
<i>If we don't make it back...</i>

165
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,074
you're going to do fine.

166
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:20,869
Yes, sir.
Good luck.

167
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:39,622
- The level's dropped.
- Again?

168
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,630
Nobody's been in or out.

169
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:44,901
Brody said there's no leak,
so that leaves one alternative.

170
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:47,937
- Who could steal that much?
- That's a lot of water.

171
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:51,847
I know, I don't know what else to do.
It wouldn't hurt to know where we stand.

172
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:53,524
Start a search.

173
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,553
Let's go, Gorman.

174
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:07,818
Dial it up again, Mr. Riley.
We must maintain communication.

175
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:10,508
It just went off a second ago.

176
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:12,262
Your timing is perfect!

177
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:14,876
Because it's been 38 minutes,

178
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,107
the maximum time a Stargate
can remain open.

179
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:19,261
See, I didn't know that.

180
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,114
<i>It's Dr. Rush.
What's your status?</i>

181
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,379
We've found an exposed area

182
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,795
of ice that looks promising.

183
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:36,863
<i>Testing now.</i>

184
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:38,697
<i>We're pretty far out.</i>

185
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,601
Can't see the gate anymore.

186
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:42,159
It's still worthless.

187
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:43,735
Keep looking.

188
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:31,457
Go ahead.

189
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,385
<i>I found something.</i>

190
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,877
So did I.
Can it wait?

191
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:36,252
<i>It's Spencer.</i>

192
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:38,530
<i>I can deal with him myself
if you'd like, but...</i>

193
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:40,263
No, it's fine.
I'll be on my way.

194
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,852
I didn't steal anything!

195
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,939
- What's this?
- Those are mine!

196
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,149
I brought them through with me
when we evacuated!

197
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:58,288
You brought them through with you?

198
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:01,530
Give me a reason.

199
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:03,194
Back off!

200
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,825
I don't have time!

201
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:06,936
Lock him up.

202
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:09,165
The Colonel can deal with him
when he gets back.

203
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,409
You said you found something.

204
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:24,168
To be honest,
I don't know what I saw.

205
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:27,040
I have to talk to Rush.
You keep searching.

206
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:29,947
Nothing we find is going to add up
to what's missing.

207
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:32,277
I know,
but we have to know what we've got.

208
00:13:32,402 --> 00:13:34,730
No one's gone near the tank,
and it keeps going down.

209
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:19,448
Come on, come on...

210
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:24,779
Destiny.

211
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,782
<i>This is Young.
We got pure ice.</i>

212
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:28,450
That's excellent news.

213
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,203
It's a frozen waterfall.

214
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,204
We should be able

215
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,477
<i>to break it up into manageable pieces
and haul it back.</i>

216
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:36,792
We'll be ready for you.

217
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:39,580
Busy day on Destiny.

218
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,505
I haven't taken anything.

219
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:43,830
I don't think you have.

220
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:45,634
What are you doing?

221
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,479
Checking for stolen rations.

222
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:49,067
It's okay, Dr. Franklin.

223
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:52,933
Confess, Miss Armstrong.
You drank 40,000 liters of water.

224
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,568
- He's kidding.
- I know.

225
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:57,395
I'm just saying, we have rights.

226
00:14:57,838 --> 00:15:00,966
I'm done here, Miss Armstrong.
I hope I haven't inconvenienced you.

227
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:02,025
I understand.

228
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:05,487
I knew that you would.

229
00:15:06,814 --> 00:15:07,816
You.

230
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,616
Next.

231
00:15:25,898 --> 00:15:27,525
This is never gonna be enough.

232
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:30,697
Stand back.

233
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:36,851
- You've done this before, have you?
- At least five times.

234
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,437
You mind if I give it a shot?

235
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:45,590
Remember,

236
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:48,249
all we have are the bullets
we brought with us.

237
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,791
So, are we talking about, like,

238
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,701
one little cloud of bugs,
or are they all over the ship?

239
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:02,210
I'm not even sure that "bugs"
is the right word for them.

240
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,007
- What about "cloud?"
- Except the cloud was alive.

241
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,400
It was almost like
thousands of tiny...

242
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:09,809
alien creatures.

243
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,096
I have a problem
with everything you just said.

244
00:16:13,984 --> 00:16:15,974
What you've just described is...

245
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,162
it's the same

246
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:19,894
as Lieutenant Scott claimed he saw
on the desert planet.

247
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,900
That's what I was thinking,
and maybe some of them followed him.

248
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:26,067
- Wouldn't we have noticed them?
- Not if only a few came

249
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,594
through the gate.
They're like tiny grains of sand.

250
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,636
And then what, started reproducing?

251
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:33,241
If it's a living organism,
then, they would.

252
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,510
So now we've got aliens.

253
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:39,414
What if they start bursting out
of our stomachs?

254
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:41,104
I don't think they're dangerous.

255
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:43,716
It almost felt like
they were trying to communicate.

256
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:45,920
Lieutenant Scott used the same word.

257
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,632
- You said he was delirious.
- I was wrong.

258
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,010
What's your plan?

259
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:56,806
I guess we should stop everyone
from wandering around the ship.

260
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:00,264
After you.

261
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:02,077
Here?

262
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:07,216
This is Lieutenant Johansen.

263
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:08,812
We have a situation.

264
00:17:09,457 --> 00:17:11,351
It's under control,
but as a precaution,

265
00:17:11,476 --> 00:17:13,744
I ask everyone
to return to their quarters

266
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:16,409
and remain there until further notice.
Thank you.

267
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,040
You're...

268
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:23,124
- you're not going to tell them?
- That we've got aliens?

269
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:26,002
We'll keep it
on a need-to-know basis.

270
00:17:26,372 --> 00:17:27,374
What else?

271
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:28,976
You're in charge.

272
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:31,091
And I'm asking your advice.

273
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:32,384
What else?

274
00:17:34,242 --> 00:17:36,471
Always consider the greater good.

275
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:38,532
That's it.

276
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,201
That's enough ice for now.

277
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:49,726
Let's get out of here.

278
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:52,701
<i>Gorman, meet me in the gate room.
We have ice on the way.</i>

279
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:53,956
Copy.

280
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,634
They're on it.

281
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,438
Dial it back, please.

282
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,683
<i>Destiny, this is Young.
How's it going up there?</i>

283
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:25,580
Offloading the sled now.

284
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:27,289
Hurry it up.

285
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:29,104
We want to do one more run.

286
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:33,004
Just so you know,
another matter has come up.

287
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,799
- We have it under control.
- We have aliens on the ship.

288
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:37,196
<i>What?</i>

289
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:38,676
They just shredded Gorman.

290
00:19:40,435 --> 00:19:41,951
What the hell does that mean?

291
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:43,932
<i>Millions of tiny flying razor blades</i>

292
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,892
floating around the ship
like piranha.

293
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,103
Corporal Gorman is alive.
Lieutenant Johansen is tending to him.

294
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,843
He's probably not gonna make it.

295
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:53,720
<i>- That's it. We're coming back.</i>
- That's not necessary, Colonel.

296
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:55,398
Eli is overreacting.

297
00:19:55,993 --> 00:19:58,655
We believe the creatures are the same
as those Lieutenant Scott

298
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,240
<i>encountered on the planet.</i>

299
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,408
<i>They must have followed us back
through the gate.</i>

300
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,648
I doubt those things I saw
were dangerous, sir.

301
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:06,379
They helped me.

302
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:07,997
<i>Gorman may have provoked them.</i>

303
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:10,834
- We'll know more once he comes to.
- If he comes to.

304
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,669
In the meantime, Lieutenant Johansen

305
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,004
has ordered everyone
to remain in their quarters.

306
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,549
<i>They're nothing more
than a nuisance at this point,</i>

307
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,800
but we desperately need more ice.

308
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,135
<i>All right.</i>

309
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:23,888
We'll figure out what to do with them
when we get back.

310
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,143
Sending the sled back through now.
Rush out.

311
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:42,198
You're gonna have to learn
when to shut up.

312
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:46,463
You can't just lie to the guy
and expect...

313
00:20:46,588 --> 00:20:48,037
Once back into FTL,

314
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,230
it could be days
before we find another planet

315
00:20:50,355 --> 00:20:52,608
capable of replenishing
our water supplies.

316
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:55,879
This ice represents a fraction
of what we need to stay alive.

317
00:20:56,196 --> 00:20:58,303
- We need more!
- I know!

318
00:20:58,428 --> 00:21:00,512
- But that doesn't mean you can...
- It does!

319
00:21:00,637 --> 00:21:04,627
- You're making it sound like we're...
- Just stop acting like a child, please!

320
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:11,373
We have to figure this out.

321
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,539
I said "we."

322
00:21:30,794 --> 00:21:32,124
I say we torch 'em.

323
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:34,793
You know, put some teams together,
hunt them down.

324
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,405
- Where'd you get that?
- I can invent things too.

325
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,457
- We've really got to work together...
- Maybe the bugs were responding

326
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:42,413
- out of self-defense.
- Self-defense?

327
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:44,469
Did you see what they did
to Gorman's face?

328
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,626
I'm the one treating him, Sergeant.
I saw exactly what they did to his face.

329
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:50,308
Look, we don't know
what it is we're dealing with,

330
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,595
and "torching" them

331
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,629
may only serve
to antagonize them further.

332
00:21:53,754 --> 00:21:57,120
- We hit them with something else.
- Revenge, that's great.

333
00:21:57,245 --> 00:21:59,751
We got to do something.
If we just sit around

334
00:21:59,876 --> 00:22:02,395
till they drink all of our water,
then we're gonna...

335
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,526
Alien bugs show up
and half our water disappears.

336
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:08,385
Don't tell me
I'm the only one who...

337
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,904
Obviously not. The question is,
what are we gonna do about it?

338
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:14,043
Sergeant, you and your team
go search for this alien...

339
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,484
entity, cloud, bugs, whatever
it is we're calling them,

340
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:18,374
- and report back, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

341
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:19,579
And Sergeant.

342
00:22:19,704 --> 00:22:21,915
- No torching.
- Yes, ma'am!

343
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:23,466
I have an idea!

344
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:41,484
It's gonna be dark soon.

345
00:23:11,992 --> 00:23:13,141
Stand back.

346
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:15,661
<i>Nothing's happening.</i>

347
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:22,066
Yes, there is.

348
00:23:22,552 --> 00:23:23,779
It's like vapor.

349
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:25,987
We just can't see them.

350
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,405
That's what they did when I saw them.
They disappear.

351
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,908
So they're growing
in numbers exponentially,

352
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,870
and consuming our resources
without us even knowing it.

353
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:36,713
You have to get them off the ship.

354
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,587
<i>Sergeant Greer, come in.</i>

355
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:50,678
I'm a little busy right now.

356
00:23:51,018 --> 00:23:53,647
The bugs are getting into the water tank
every time we open the hatch.

357
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:55,820
Once we locate the main swarm,
we're gonna have...

358
00:23:55,945 --> 00:23:58,417
They're in front of me right now.

359
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:02,214
Don't antagonize them.

360
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:03,316
<i>I won't,</i>

361
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:06,188
unless they antagonize me first.

362
00:24:07,672 --> 00:24:09,026
Do they move when you do?

363
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:21,232
They do now.

364
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,966
What we need is an airlock.

365
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,796
Unfortunately, there are none

366
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:32,025
in the habitable compartments
of the ship.

367
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,569
I know what to do.

368
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:38,363
This isn't gonna keep us going
very long.

369
00:24:40,307 --> 00:24:43,734
Maybe Destiny will figure out
we're getting short on water

370
00:24:44,662 --> 00:24:47,735
and find us a planet
with nice fresh water

371
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,444
right next to the Stargate.

372
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,823
Come on, we deserve a break.

373
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:04,520
Can you hear me?

374
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:10,078
I'm sorry, sir,
the ice just gave way.

375
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:14,230
Are you hurt?

376
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,816
Negative. I'm okay, but...

377
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:18,975
I'm wedged in pretty good.

378
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:22,008
Good thing, too.
Looks like a long way down.

379
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:23,896
All right, just hold on.
I'm gonna...

380
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:26,169
I'm gonna throw a line down.

381
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:33,937
Here it comes.

382
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:38,628
I need you to tell me
when you've got it.

383
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:48,939
Got it.

384
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,365
Now, if you can manage it,

385
00:25:52,193 --> 00:25:55,678
run it under both your arms
and fasten it across your chest.

386
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,307
Done this before, too, have you?

387
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,982
At least a dozen times.

388
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:07,565
Now, I want you to pull yourself up.
I'm gonna pull from this end.

389
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,192
You ready?

390
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,236
One,

391
00:26:12,922 --> 00:26:13,923
two,

392
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:14,942
three!

393
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,969
Pull!

394
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:20,394
Pull, Scott!

395
00:26:20,817 --> 00:26:21,818
Come on!

396
00:26:21,943 --> 00:26:22,813
Pull!

397
00:26:32,872 --> 00:26:34,249
How stuck are you?

398
00:26:35,286 --> 00:26:36,585
Pretty dang stuck.

399
00:26:37,315 --> 00:26:39,222
Is there any way
you can dig yourself out?

400
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:40,928
I'm not sure.

401
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:50,435
That's okay.

402
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,031
That's passed.

403
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,229
Still here, sir.

404
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:01,577
All right, let's just...

405
00:27:02,472 --> 00:27:04,318
let's think about this for a second.

406
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,594
<i>Destiny, this is Young.</i>

407
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:10,041
Go ahead.

408
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,879
<i>We've got a situation here.</i>

409
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,381
There was a tremor and Scott

410
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,675
<i>fell through the snow
into a crevasse.</i>

411
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,510
<i>He's fine,
but he's just out of reach.</i>

412
00:27:18,014 --> 00:27:19,220
<i>I tried to pull him up,</i>

413
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,556
but that's not gonna happen soon.
How's that other space suit coming?

414
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:26,515
We stopped work on that.
I confined everyone to quarters.

415
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:29,021
<i>All right, it was just a thought.</i>

416
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,568
We'll figure it out.

417
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,610
How's your bug situation?

418
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:40,566
Same as before.
Don't worry about it.

419
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:42,660
<i>Don't you worry either, T.J.</i>

420
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:45,449
I'll be out of here in no time.

421
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:49,920
Good luck.

422
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:51,407
Johansen out.

423
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:54,732
Everyone is lying.

424
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,717
Grown-ups do that.

425
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:14,847
<i>This is Greer. It's working.</i>

426
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:17,537
<i>They're moving away from us
as we move forward.</i>

427
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,375
Good job.
Keep it up.

428
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:29,305
How about you lower the gun down,
and I shoot myself free?

429
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,624
That's good thinking.

430
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,131
There's no way
the bullets will ricochet into your ass.

431
00:28:33,256 --> 00:28:35,247
Maybe I can cut my way out
with the plasma cutter.

432
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:37,479
You get one hole in that suit,
you're dead.

433
00:28:37,604 --> 00:28:40,009
Maybe there's a way for me
to get down there.

434
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,660
That's just as stupid.

435
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,180
"That's just as stupid, sir."

436
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:48,433
The last thing we need is for both of us
to be stuck down here.

437
00:28:56,997 --> 00:28:58,012
You okay?

438
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,236
Closed in a little tighter,

439
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:01,858
but I think...

440
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:03,157
What?

441
00:29:03,728 --> 00:29:04,737
What?

442
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:09,080
I think I'm losing suit pressure.

443
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:25,214
I thought we were supposed
to be confined to quarters.

444
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,599
I heard over the radio...

445
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:31,227
there was a tremor.

446
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:34,355
Lieutenant Scott
fell into a crevasse.

447
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:35,530
Oh, my god.

448
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:36,789
He's okay.

449
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,485
Just...

450
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:40,228
stuck.

451
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,447
- Do they have enough air?
- Young says he's got it under control.

452
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,135
I just...

453
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,947
thought you would want to know.

454
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,334
Thanks.

455
00:30:05,643 --> 00:30:06,827
<i>I think the ice</i>

456
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,251
<i>tore a hole in his suit.</i>

457
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:10,683
How big a tear is it?

458
00:30:10,984 --> 00:30:12,143
<i>I can't see it,</i>

459
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,615
but I can hear it.

460
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,563
It's hissing out pretty good.

461
00:30:17,714 --> 00:30:18,949
An hour at most.

462
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:20,818
<i>Plenty of time to make it back.</i>

463
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:22,523
If I wasn't stuck!

464
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,898
You have to consider the amount of time
you have left now.

465
00:30:27,023 --> 00:30:29,063
<i>I'm aware of the damn time, Rush.</i>

466
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:31,141
All I'm saying is
if you delay much longer...

467
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:33,038
<i>Listen to me!
I know what you're saying,</i>

468
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,208
and I'm not going anywhere without him
and that's the way it's going to be!

469
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,710
What's the matter with you?

470
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,105
Miss Armstrong,

471
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,052
- you should return to your quarters.
- You know where you can go?

472
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:51,975
Look, Colonel,

473
00:30:53,123 --> 00:30:56,242
I understand your desire
to rescue Lieutenant Scott,

474
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:57,229
of course,

475
00:30:57,548 --> 00:31:00,024
<i>and only you can decide
how much time you have left,</i>

476
00:31:00,373 --> 00:31:01,529
<i>but Lieutenant,</i>

477
00:31:02,248 --> 00:31:03,486
<i>if Colonel Young</i>

478
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:04,963
<i>remains there,</i>

479
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:06,489
<i>trying to free you,</i>

480
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:08,968
to pull you up by himself,

481
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:12,535
there's a chance
he might not make it back.

482
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:16,297
<i>He's right.</i>

483
00:31:17,947 --> 00:31:19,592
Just keep the gate active.

484
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:21,670
We're gonna make it back in time
with your ice,

485
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,588
<i>which is all you really care about.</i>

486
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:24,725
<i>Young out!</i>

487
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:29,346
Damn, he's a lot of work.

488
00:31:55,535 --> 00:31:56,539
This is Greer.

489
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:57,873
I locked them up.

490
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:00,263
Closing off
the ventilation in that room.

491
00:32:03,977 --> 00:32:05,839
Vents are closed.
Should be airtight.

492
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:07,925
What are they doing?

493
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,672
Looking for a way out.

494
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:13,779
Let's hope they don't find one.

495
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,031
Come on!

496
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,650
Come on...

497
00:32:49,448 --> 00:32:50,271
Sir...

498
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:56,113
I'm thinking.

499
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:57,478
Go.

500
00:32:59,406 --> 00:33:00,227
It's okay.

501
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:01,630
No, it's not.

502
00:33:01,965 --> 00:33:03,230
Come on, sir.

503
00:33:04,072 --> 00:33:06,003
We both know
you've done this before, too.

504
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:08,861
Done what?

505
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:11,267
Lost people.

506
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,611
Too many times. I'm not...

507
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:17,620
I'm not doing it again.

508
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:20,073
I can't let you do it.

509
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,432
You don't have a choice.

510
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,645
Not that I'm counting,

511
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:26,588
but this is the third time

512
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,945
in almost as many weeks

513
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,175
that you've been willing
to kill yourself,

514
00:33:31,912 --> 00:33:33,665
there's a pretty good chance
at this point

515
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,835
I won't be around
to talk you out of it again.

516
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:41,328
You're a fine, young Officer.

517
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,169
You've got a heart
as big as a house,

518
00:33:44,902 --> 00:33:46,722
and I'm not here
because I want to die.

519
00:33:47,189 --> 00:33:49,220
I'm here because I haven't given up

520
00:33:49,345 --> 00:33:50,819
on saving your ass,

521
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,696
so just shut up and think.

522
00:33:56,904 --> 00:33:58,472
They're gettin' pissed off.

523
00:34:02,134 --> 00:34:03,670
Really pissed off.

524
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:12,508
A few of them got out.

525
00:34:12,994 --> 00:34:14,086
What? How?

526
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,179
We need a plan, Lieutenant!

527
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:20,485
I'm coming down there!

528
00:34:26,538 --> 00:34:28,248
This is beautiful out here.

529
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:58,030
Wake up, Scott!

530
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:00,699
Wake up!

531
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,741
I need you to wake up, Scott!

532
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:06,448
Scott, come on!

533
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:09,217
Wake up!

534
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:13,260
Come on!

535
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:28,256
Come on, I got you.

536
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,049
That's it, pull!

537
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:31,444
Pull.

538
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,760
Come on, Lieutenant.

539
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,721
That's it.

540
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:38,486
That's it, I got you.

541
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:51,424
You're okay.

542
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:58,617
Scott, come on.

543
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:00,634
Hang on, kid.

544
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:08,699
What's the plan?

545
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,283
We open the door,

546
00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:12,896
they go for the water,
we close the lid.

547
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:14,596
All right, who's gonna do that?

548
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,681
I am.

549
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:18,114
- I will.
- I'm not the one with the torch.

550
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,154
Look, I am not
going to let you do that...

551
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,223
I haven't killed any of them.
You are.

552
00:37:22,348 --> 00:37:23,932
I'll stand back, torch them.

553
00:37:24,057 --> 00:37:26,827
- I want you out of sight.
- What, you don't trust me?

554
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,385
I don't.

555
00:37:38,577 --> 00:37:39,590
All right.

556
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,279
Eli, I'm ready.

557
00:38:03,171 --> 00:38:04,801
Make us a clear path
to the gate room.

558
00:38:04,926 --> 00:38:06,491
Seal off everything else.

559
00:38:11,381 --> 00:38:12,247
You're good.

560
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:15,058
<i>If this doesn't work,</i>

561
00:38:15,183 --> 00:38:17,502
lock this compartment off
from the rest of the ship.

562
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:23,300
Destiny, this is Young.

563
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:26,157
I'm on my way back with Scott.

564
00:38:26,987 --> 00:38:27,992
Come in.

565
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:33,143
Let 'em out.

566
00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:51,148
I got 'em!

567
00:38:53,753 --> 00:38:55,719
All right, dial the gate.
We're on our way.

568
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,131
I'm almost at the Stargate
with Scott.

569
00:39:03,543 --> 00:39:04,925
Shut it down so I can...

570
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,094
<i>dial in.</i>

571
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,304
Colonel, we're about to send
these alien bugs through to the planet.

572
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,447
- <i>We've no other choice.</i>
- What?

573
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,807
We need you
to step away from the gate

574
00:39:15,932 --> 00:39:17,663
and remain as still as possible.

575
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:20,021
They're coming through now.

576
00:40:35,504 --> 00:40:36,725
Get his helmet off.

577
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,551
Give her a hand.

578
00:40:49,423 --> 00:40:52,366
His pulse's thready, but he's breathing.
Let's get him out of here.

579
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:26,733
Sergeant Spencer,

580
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:30,112
you step out of line again,
I will deal with you personally.

581
00:41:31,962 --> 00:41:32,864
Understand?

582
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:36,039
Yes, sir.

583
00:41:39,389 --> 00:41:40,989
I don't think he does.

584
00:41:45,952 --> 00:41:48,130
I need to talk to you
about the behavior of one of yours.

585
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,878
That can wait. We need to go
over the new rationing amounts

586
00:41:51,003 --> 00:41:54,299
I was scheduled to use
the communication stones this morning...

587
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:01,883
At approximately 03:00 hours
ship time,

588
00:42:02,008 --> 00:42:04,007
Corporal Gorman
succumbed to injuries

589
00:42:04,132 --> 00:42:07,189
sustained in an encounter
with an alien entity.

590
00:42:07,771 --> 00:42:10,572
Lieutenant Johansen
did everything that she could.

591
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:14,314
I intend to hold appropriate services
tomorrow at 16:00 hours.

592
00:42:15,613 --> 00:42:17,061
How do I turn it off?
