1
00:00:00,213 --> 00:00:03,502
This is what Destiny intended
from the moment it entered the system.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,841
We are going to survive,
we are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:12,272
Ths ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,556
Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:19,352
He and Young are bumping heads.

6
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,829
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:23,418
We pretend nothing happened.

8
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:25,813
We need to be ready for
the next encounter...

9
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:27,652
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:29,899
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,239
You dreamt you were the spy
who leaked everything

12
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,116
to the Lucian alliance?

13
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,412
It wasn't me.
I was Colonel Telford.

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,579
The Goa'uld
had brainwashing technology.

15
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:41,855
It is possible that the
alliance now has that capability.

16
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:43,709
On Earth, you are on your own.

17
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:46,837
You must be using
the ancient communication stones.

18
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,507
- What?
- Telford wouldn't make that mistake.

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,719
We know that you are a traitor
and a murderer.

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,638
Now we know you're a coward too.

21
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:58,461
You've found another Icarus planet.

22
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,185
We're all very excited
to have Dr. Rush's full cooperation.

23
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,728
Kill me and you kill Rush!

24
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,438
Begin venting the atmosphere

25
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,263
<i>in Colonel Telford's quarters.</i>

26
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:13,239
Open this damn door!

27
00:01:17,147 --> 00:01:19,245
We both know
you're not going to kill me.

28
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:29,755
Mr. Brody, this is Wray.

29
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,091
You need
to restore the atmosphere...

30
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,259
Please disregard that request.

31
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,431
<i>By letting this happen,</i>

32
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,014
<i>you are participating in not only
the murder of Colonel Telford,</i>

33
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,735
but Dr. Rush as well.

34
00:01:54,412 --> 00:01:56,445
Sir, you've made your point.

35
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,620
I'm not trying to make a point.

36
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,712
Open the door.

37
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:11,715
- I know what I'm doing.
- You're killing him!

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,257
I know that, Lieutenant.

39
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,675
What should we do?

40
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,779
The Colonel's bluffing.
He's not going to kill him.

41
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,210
What's happening to him?

42
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:18,572
You've killed him.

43
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,194
- You're all in danger.
- What?

44
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,641
They're coming.

45
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,197
Who's coming?

46
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,158
The Lucian alliance.
They're coming to take Destiny.

47
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:18,424
Projet-SG (1.00)
www.projet-sg.com

48
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:24,100
<i>We've been informed
that this ship faces an incursion</i>

49
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:26,857
<i>by armed forces
of the Lucian alliance.</i>

50
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:30,394
<i>The group responsible
for the attack on Icarus base.</i>

51
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:34,565
<i>All military personnel on board
have been placed on high alert.</i>

52
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,817
<i>If the enemy has acquired</i>

53
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,803
<i>the means to dial Destiny,</i>

54
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:41,363
<i>their point of ingress
will be the Stargate.</i>

55
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,614
We're clear.

56
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,868
<i>So the gateroom is off-limits.</i>

57
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,122
<i>All surrounding corridors
have been placed in lockdown.</i>

58
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,709
<i>No one may enter
without proper authorization.</i>

59
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,964
<i>I've provided homeworld security</i>

60
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,884
<i>with intel on the planet
from which the Lucian alliance</i>

61
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,677
<i>intends to launch their assault.</i>

62
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:08,140
<i>They're dispatching forces
as I speak.</i>

63
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:15,534
The best-case scenario,

64
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:17,733
Earth forces
take the launch point intact

65
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,277
and we gain a supply line from home.

66
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,412
The worst-case scenario,

67
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:24,659
our forces don't make it
before the attack is launched,

68
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:27,884
in which case
we'll have to deal with them on our end.

69
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:29,286
In that event,

70
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,372
all non-military personnel

71
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,332
will be ordered
back to your quarters,

72
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,627
where you will remain
until the situation has been resolved.

73
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,171
Make no mistake...
this will be dealt with swiftly

74
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,589
and decisively.

75
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,299
Thank you. That is all.

76
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:58,105
A couple of hours ago,

77
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:02,069
Colonel Telford admitted to being a mole
for the Lucian alliance.

78
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,530
And now, suddenly, he's on our side?

79
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:07,741
- You trust him?
- I didn't say that.

80
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:16,752
- What in the hell was that?
- "What in the hell was that, sir?"

81
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,210
- All you had to do was tell me.
- I was keeping you out of it.

82
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,046
You didn't have to.

83
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,431
If I'd known killing him
and bringing him back

84
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:25,518
was the only way to beat
that brainwash,

85
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:27,134
I'd have been behind you 100%.

86
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,177
So you'll follow orders as long as
I explain everything beforehand?

87
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:31,682
No, sir, that is not...

88
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,486
That's great, because if it was,
we'd have a problem, Lieutenant.

89
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:36,161
Do we have a problem?

90
00:06:40,014 --> 00:06:42,067
Good.
It's not the time for that.

91
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,949
No headaches or blurred vision?

92
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,835
I told you, I'm fine.

93
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:58,417
Rush is fine. I'll find out about me
when I switch back.

94
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:01,241
Look, I really need to go, and...

95
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,298
Can you give us a minute?

96
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:14,349
How are you feeling, David?

97
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:20,213
- Confused.
- I bet.

98
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:26,269
You went the whole nine yards.
To the brink and back.

99
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:27,613
I had to.

100
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,157
In my defense,
it wasn't the first thing I tried.

101
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,410
Yeah. Thanks for that.

102
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,955
At least the brainwashing explains
why you've been such an ass.

103
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:45,689
I've read the SG mission reports
of that method being done in the past.

104
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:47,064
I just never...

105
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,224
You have no idea what it's like
to remember things that you've done...

106
00:08:04,932 --> 00:08:06,232
Terrible things.

107
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:08,814
You weren't yourself, David.

108
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,536
You've got to send me back.

109
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,996
- Not yet.
- I've done all that I can here...

110
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:19,499
I already killed you once...

111
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,542
I'm more useful to you
in my own body with them.

112
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,584
You know that.

113
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,129
How else will you get Rush back?

114
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,789
- Listen...
- Get him out of there.

115
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,008
You've just come back from the dead.
I want you to get your strength back.

116
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,530
Excuse us.

117
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:47,985
Listen, when they come,
I want you here, safe.

118
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:49,677
Safe?

119
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,882
There could be wounded.
We're going to need you.

120
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,999
- What we'll need is a real doctor.
- You're up for this.

121
00:08:58,124 --> 00:08:59,413
Not even close.

122
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:02,082
What are you planning to do?

123
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,127
Evacuate the atmosphere in the gateroom
the minute they step through.

124
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:08,046
Kill them all, you mean.

125
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,632
You think I have a choice?

126
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:15,424
If you're asking for forgiveness,
I can't help you there either.

127
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,467
I'll do my best.

128
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:33,211
You're back.

129
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:38,307
That was me.

130
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,580
I had to see
whether you were faking.

131
00:09:42,057 --> 00:09:43,307
Well, I wasn't.

132
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:45,801
I apologize.

133
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,790
Back to work. I know.

134
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,324
Planetary scans.

135
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,566
<i>It looks like the intel is good.</i>

136
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,083
<i>The planet's laced
with naquadria deposits.</i>

137
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:31,279
<i>We detect an energy signature emanating
from what looks like a pyramid.</i>

138
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:33,840
Pyramid?
That takes me back.

139
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,301
The complex inside is shielded
against beaming technology.

140
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:38,303
So Rush can't be beamed out.

141
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,848
<i>We'll have to go in
with ground forces.</i>

142
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:44,726
All right, Colonel.
You have a go.

143
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,810
What was that?

144
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,247
We're under attack.

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,751
- Can we dial the ninth chevron?
- Not without blowing everything up.

146
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:11,655
Dial it.

147
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:13,599
Get ready!

148
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:16,091
We're going now!

149
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,465
<i>The Lucian alliance
is an organization of humans</i>

150
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,948
<i>from sovereign planets</i>

151
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,826
<i>who have taken control
of the resources and technology...</i>

152
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,405
The air force video?

153
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:01,720
I'm just seeing if there's anything
that might help.

154
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:07,684
What's he going to do?

155
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:09,353
The Colonel?

156
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:12,278
They're sending an army.

157
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:15,609
What do you think he's going to do?

158
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,836
This is it.

159
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,210
It's happening now?

160
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:48,642
Go.

161
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,360
Radio back
when you reach the other side.

162
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,414
And take him with you.

163
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:11,903
I see them, Eli.

164
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,990
All personnel,
report to your designated areas.

165
00:13:15,115 --> 00:13:18,004
This is not a drill.
Defense teams stand by.

166
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,320
- Which button?
- This one.

167
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,312
How long will it take
till we reach vacuum?

168
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,605
A minute or so?

169
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,107
That's about right.

1
00:14:09,505 --> 00:14:12,268
Defense teams stand by
to secure prisoners on my order.

2
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:15,535
Copy that.

3
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,985
Monitor from here,
stay on the radio.

4
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,295
Got it.

5
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:26,085
What happened?

6
00:14:28,975 --> 00:14:30,535
No, no, it's me.

7
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:36,355
The ship...

8
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:40,838
- The Lucian Alliance...
- We know everything. Telford told us.

9
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,464
So what are we doing about it?

10
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:46,927
Let's just say it'll all be over
in a few minutes.

11
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:00,005
Come on.

12
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:08,375
I'm reading a huge energy spike.

13
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:11,900
At this rate, they've got less
than a minute before their core goes up.

14
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:15,705
Get our people out of the shielded areas
And beam them back to the ship, now!

15
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:23,965
The core is going to go critical.
I can't stop it.

16
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:27,425
Still no signal from the other side?

17
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:33,348
Get as many of our people through
as you can.

18
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:49,114
Colonel, we still have two 302s
on their way back from the planet.

19
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,825
We can't wait.
Get us out of here.

20
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,474
Aren't we supposed
to go to our quarters?

21
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,295
These are my quarters.

22
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:31,425
And I'm not going anywhere.

23
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:43,805
They brought Rush along with them.
We're going to have to use the hard way.

24
00:16:57,906 --> 00:16:59,990
- What did you do to the Gate?
- It wasn't me.

25
00:17:00,115 --> 00:17:02,313
You killed over a hundred of my men!

26
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:08,200
Massin, your father's name
was my password.

27
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:10,571
Gate travel must have
severed the link.

28
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:18,045
<i>Lucian Alliance forces,
you are surrounded and sealed in.</i>

29
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:21,164
<i>You will also find the intel
provided by Colonel Telford</i>

30
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:22,848
<i>is now useless.</i>

31
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:25,752
<i>Lay down your weapons
in front of the doors.</i>

32
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,870
<i>Step back into the center of the room
with your hands on your heads,</i>

33
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:33,072
<i>Or we will vent
the entire compartment to space.</i>

34
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:34,555
Can they do it?

35
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,889
Then they should have.

36
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:01,037
Colonel, they're up to something.

37
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:02,914
Talk to me.

38
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:05,792
They've got something
to open the doors!

39
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:07,820
Vent the atmosphere in the Gateroom.

40
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:09,565
- Do it now.
- It's too late.

41
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,593
Take cover!

42
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,807
Get back!

43
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Go!

44
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:28,765
Fall back!

45
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,245
- Rush, you should stay here.
- No, no. The ship's under attack!

46
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:04,920
It's time to go.

47
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,269
- Just wait.
- Let's go.

48
00:19:06,475 --> 00:19:07,475
Now!

49
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,005
There's an elevator this way.

50
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:34,065
Oh, God...

51
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,592
Go!

52
00:19:57,425 --> 00:19:58,425
Wait!

53
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:11,295
<i>You're welcome.</i>

54
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:14,135
Want to get the hell out of there?

55
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:19,845
You've been shot.

56
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:21,511
Sorry, sorry.

57
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:26,985
See, it's okay.

58
00:20:27,365 --> 00:20:28,865
You'll be okay.

59
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:43,449
You'll be fine.

60
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:45,885
You'll be fine.

1
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:14,090
I'll be right back.
Okay?

2
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,583
Over here.

3
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:43,665
Colonel Young?

4
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:46,555
Who is this?

5
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:50,058
<i>Commander Kiva
of the Lucian Alliance forces.</i>

6
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,063
We will not be complying
with your request to surrender.

7
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:07,742
<i>We barely made hyperspace.
This time it was even closer.</i>

8
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:10,078
What about casualties?

9
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:14,832
Two of my 302s couldn't make it back,
and if Rush was still on the planet...

10
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:16,845
I'm sorry, Sam.

11
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:20,505
<i>Did any of them make it to </i>Destiny<i>?</i>

12
00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:22,395
I haven't heard.

13
00:22:33,655 --> 00:22:34,644
So much for that.

14
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,033
Why didn't you evacuate
the compartment to space?

15
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,486
- That was the plan.
- He didn't do it to save you.

16
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:44,654
Not me.

17
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:48,366
The connection was severed
the minute I stepped through the gate.

18
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:54,715
Give me the lay of the land.

19
00:22:56,195 --> 00:22:57,375
This is the Gateroom.

20
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,405
They've also occupied
the surrounding corridors.

21
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:02,100
They had advanced further,
but they pulled back.

22
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:04,780
Just took what they could hold
with limited manpower. That's smart.

23
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:07,555
Once they retreated,
I locked down the area behind them.

24
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:10,360
Given the technology at their disposal,
it won't stop them,

25
00:23:10,485 --> 00:23:12,056
but it should give us some space.

26
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:14,767
The prisoners are being held here.

27
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,150
Between them and us,
30 feet of corridor either way.

28
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:20,796
Tthe second we hit the outside sections,
those hostages are as good as dead.

29
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,363
I've done a head count.

30
00:23:27,978 --> 00:23:30,616
We have 12 missing
and presumed captured,

31
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,244
including Riley, TJ,

32
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,371
Eli, and Chloe.

33
00:23:37,325 --> 00:23:38,435
Come on!

34
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:46,966
What happened?

35
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:49,052
You were shot.

36
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,889
I stopped the bleeding.
You're fine. Look up here.

37
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,707
Look at me. Look at me.

38
00:23:59,335 --> 00:24:00,807
Where are we?

39
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:04,394
I don't know.

40
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:07,487
I've never been
to this part of the ship before.

41
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:08,705
No-one has.

42
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:12,656
I just pressed some random buttons.

43
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,582
We can't get back.

44
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:16,640
I'm guessing
someone locked out elevator access.

45
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:17,580
Us or them?

46
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,827
That's the problem.

47
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:29,955
I just need to get to a window.

48
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:31,844
Get an idea where we are.

49
00:24:32,425 --> 00:24:34,722
And then we can walk back.

50
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,355
I've got you.
Come on. Come here.

51
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:43,022
Ready?

52
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,140
Here we go.
One, two, three.

53
00:24:48,435 --> 00:24:49,485
Lean on me.

54
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:50,955
I've got you.

55
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:52,185
Ready?

56
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:54,215
Here you go.

57
00:24:56,525 --> 00:24:57,725
Colonel Young?

58
00:24:58,565 --> 00:24:59,565
Go ahead.

59
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,865
<i>Here's how I see the situation.</i>

60
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:05,419
We have the Gateroom
and some of your people.

61
00:25:05,935 --> 00:25:07,964
You hold the control interface room,
which I'm told,

62
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:10,091
is the ship's nerve center.

63
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,460
<i>What do you want?</i>

64
00:25:11,585 --> 00:25:14,235
We came here
for the same reasons you did.

65
00:25:15,195 --> 00:25:16,639
We don't want to hurt anyone.

66
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,808
<i>You're welcome
to stay aboard Destiny</i>

67
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,415
<i>and help us realize
the potential of her discovery.</i>

68
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,272
<i>Lay down your weapons and join us.</i>

69
00:25:24,515 --> 00:25:28,515
Or, if you prefer, we can drop you off
at the next inhabitable world.

70
00:25:28,715 --> 00:25:31,863
Or I vent the atmosphere
in the sections you're occupying

71
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:33,585
<i>and keep the ship.</i>

72
00:25:35,475 --> 00:25:37,785
If you had that in you,
you would have done it already.

73
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,372
The point is I have the ability
to end this conversation right now.

74
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:45,600
She wanted to see you.

75
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:48,925
- Wouldn't shut up, in fact.
- As you were, Sergeant.

76
00:25:52,195 --> 00:25:55,887
We are way past the point of fighting
our way out of this situation.

77
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,681
We need to negotiate
with these people.

78
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,809
- And I think I should be the one to...
- No, I think you're right.

79
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:06,515
Him.

80
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:07,565
Him.

81
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:14,755
And her.

82
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:25,665
That's a mistake.

83
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:28,105
It's a demonstration.

84
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:32,632
All it will do is force their hand.

85
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,723
Do you want control of the ship
or not?

86
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,975
They have some of our people.
But we have some of theirs.

87
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,230
So the first thing we need to do
is suggest an exchange.

88
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:57,860
Do you think they'll do it?

89
00:26:57,985 --> 00:27:00,743
No. But I think it's worth a shot.

90
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:05,539
This is the control interface room.

91
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,166
This is the Gateroom.

92
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,770
If we cut our way through the wall here,
we can flank them.

93
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:12,340
- I can lead a team...
- That will reduce our numbers here.

94
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,800
We take the control interface room,
there's no need. The ship will be ours.

95
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,470
- These sections are in red.
- That section is exposed to space.

96
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,970
The ship's shield will hold
long enough for us to pass.

97
00:27:22,095 --> 00:27:24,225
We will slowly
vent atmosphere to space, yes,

98
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,395
but we could seal the corridor again
after we've taken the ship.

99
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:45,590
Take six men.

100
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:47,482
- I'll need twice that...
- Six.

101
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:51,585
And if anything goes wrong...

102
00:27:54,365 --> 00:27:55,665
These three die.

1
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,055
Not her.

2
00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:04,804
She's a medic.
We can use her in the event...

3
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:12,733
Who is this?

4
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,358
<i>My name is Camile Wray.</i>

5
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,728
I am the civilian authority
aboard this ship.

6
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:21,324
I'd like to act as an intermediary

7
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,327
<i>to resolve this issue
without further bloodshed.</i>

8
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,912
<i>Colonel Young
will not transfer control</i>

9
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,694
<i>of this ship to you.</i>

10
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:29,967
And you will?

11
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:35,135
But I will expedite
a prisoner exchange.

12
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:37,136
Your people for ours.

13
00:28:38,473 --> 00:28:39,839
If I release my prisoners,

14
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:43,012
Colonel Young will not hesitate
to vent this compartment.

15
00:28:43,692 --> 00:28:47,099
You have 12 of our people.
We have only four of yours.

16
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:48,976
I propose an even trade,

17
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,686
Four for four.

18
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,188
<i>You maintain your advantage</i>

19
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,457
<i>and gain some much-needed manpower.</i>

20
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:59,779
Colonel Young agrees with this?

21
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:02,035
In our society,

22
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:04,992
the military takes orders
from civilian leadership.

23
00:29:14,447 --> 00:29:15,669
I'll consider it.

24
00:29:16,408 --> 00:29:17,439
Nice job.

25
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,136
That should buy us some time.

26
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:24,715
Look, you're trying to save lives here.
Obviously that's a good thing.

27
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,015
But even if she agrees to the four,
which is doubtful,

28
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,623
she won't go any farther.

29
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:32,686
Once the equation tips
to the point of acceptable losses...

30
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,271
No acceptable losses...

31
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,233
Colonel Young has already determined
what that number is.

32
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,527
He knows the chances of us winning
without loss of life

33
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:40,923
are practically nil.

34
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:43,491
So limit our losses,
yes, all that we can.

35
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,032
But you'll have to do something.

36
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,619
- You don't know that.
- I'm one of your acceptable losses...

37
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,664
- You knew what you were getting into...
- You should have got me out!

38
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,249
You have no clue!

39
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,477
Stop this now, please!

40
00:29:56,824 --> 00:29:58,129
I am going to save

41
00:29:58,471 --> 00:30:00,214
every one of those hostages,

42
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,299
and I'm going to retake this ship.

43
00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:03,717
Do you understand me?

44
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:08,431
Telford has convinced her
that he is still with them,

45
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,081
otherwise he would be dead.

46
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:12,935
Sooner or later he
will make his move.

47
00:30:16,876 --> 00:30:18,301
We are to gamble...

48
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,109
this ship

49
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,902
and all of our lives

50
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,899
in the hope that some traitor

51
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:26,060
has had a change of heart.

52
00:30:36,373 --> 00:30:37,587
Look at that.

53
00:30:48,158 --> 00:30:51,150
I guess those elevators
go more than just up and down.

54
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:56,866
Right there.

55
00:30:57,662 --> 00:30:58,726
You good?

56
00:31:03,207 --> 00:31:05,883
I must have hit a few buttons
I wasn't supposed to press.

57
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:12,661
Is the air getting thin?

58
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:15,789
Life support isn't working out here.

59
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,917
How do you know?

60
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:20,243
I was the one who shut it off.

61
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:22,718
Rush's orders.

62
00:31:23,772 --> 00:31:24,924
There's air.

63
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:27,593
There isn't any new air
being pumped in.

64
00:31:28,743 --> 00:31:30,137
We need to keep moving.

65
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,949
I don't know if I can.

66
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:45,592
No problem.

67
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,338
I got you.

68
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:56,618
This is my Lieutenant, Varro.

69
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
Save him.

70
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:09,584
He's badly wounded.

71
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,557
At even the slightest hint
of trouble.

72
00:32:15,082 --> 00:32:16,678
I'll bring you back, sir.

73
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,740
I need to speak to General O'Neill.

74
00:32:30,355 --> 00:32:33,033
Second-guessing a decision
is a waste of time.

75
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:35,327
I'm not there.

76
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:38,122
But I'm starting to wonder
if maybe I should be.

77
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,915
I can't speak to that, sir.

78
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,186
This should be done, Colonel.
Over.

79
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,505
At the time, I believed
that venting the gateroom

80
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,924
would kill
both Dr. Rush and Colonel Telford.

81
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:50,843
They deserved a chance...

82
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,555
We lost two 302 pilots
sent to stop the attack.

83
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:55,485
Sorry.

84
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,391
Colonel Carter knew she'd lose her ship
if she tried to save them.

85
00:32:58,516 --> 00:33:00,936
But it was the right decision.

86
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:09,528
Are you up for this, Everett?

87
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,825
Because somebody will take your place
if you're not.

88
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,313
I'm not going to let anybody
take that ship.

89
00:33:17,438 --> 00:33:19,250
Then get your ass back there.

90
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:42,769
We're good.

91
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,588
What are you doing?

92
00:34:11,035 --> 00:34:14,009
Just checking to make sure
we're headed in the right direction.

93
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,807
This way.

94
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:28,258
There's no countdown.

95
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:30,651
What?

96
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:33,019
We dropped out of FTL
because someone was gating in.

97
00:34:33,144 --> 00:34:34,825
Why haven't we jumped back?

98
00:34:35,652 --> 00:34:38,575
Someone just activated a console
in one of the access corridors.

99
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,486
A console just came on
using Telford's code.

100
00:34:47,611 --> 00:34:49,685
<i>There's a cordoned-off
section coming our way.</i>

101
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,085
That's his move.

102
00:34:55,502 --> 00:34:57,424
- It's cold.
- Really?

1
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:07,197
What do you find?*

2
00:35:13,086 --> 00:35:15,612
We have to be careful
moving through sections.

3
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:17,906
There's a reason
we've never beenthis far.

4
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:22,161
A ton of compartments
are de-pressurized.

5
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:25,184
Hang on.

6
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:29,209
Ready?

7
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,749
More dark and gloomy.

8
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:48,518
We're good.

9
00:35:52,177 --> 00:35:53,208
Gotcha.

10
00:35:56,336 --> 00:35:57,926
- How are you doing?
- Good.

11
00:35:58,051 --> 00:35:58,947
You sure?

12
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:13,965
Stand by.

13
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:15,297
We're good to go.

14
00:36:16,747 --> 00:36:17,549
Ready.

15
00:36:18,234 --> 00:36:19,806
Just give the word, sir.

16
00:36:21,468 --> 00:36:23,388
- It's locked down.
- I'll handle it.

17
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,863
Okay, get ready.

18
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:11,855
What was that?

19
00:37:32,468 --> 00:37:33,485
Ready.

20
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:41,941
What happened?

21
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,136
You didn't do that?

22
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,554
What is that?

23
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:48,144
Just a minute ago it was a man.

24
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,893
You need to stand down
till we figure this out.

25
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,975
<i>This is Young.
Everybody stand down.</i>

26
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:05,365
Throw me a radio.

27
00:38:05,745 --> 00:38:06,749
Radio?

28
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:12,331
Three clicks, go to channel six.

29
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,499
We're going
to have to try this again.

30
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:32,294
- Let's stop.
- I'm fine.

31
00:38:32,664 --> 00:38:34,878
- Eli, you don't...
- Seriously.

32
00:38:35,622 --> 00:38:36,859
This is nothing.

33
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:42,490
Once, I climbed
the Redridge Mountains

34
00:38:42,938 --> 00:38:46,492
on my way to Stonard
with a full pack.

35
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:47,449
Where?

36
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,403
<i>The World of Warcraft.</i>

37
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,130
That must've given you
quite the sense of accomplishment.

38
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:02,591
A little break.

39
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:18,105
What do you think is happening?

40
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:20,857
We've probably won by now.

41
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,139
You think so?

42
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:28,991
If we won,
then why haven't we been rescued?

43
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:34,307
First,

44
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:36,581
they'll figure out
what to do with the prisoners.

45
00:39:37,582 --> 00:39:38,583
And then

46
00:39:39,165 --> 00:39:41,857
there's that whole
post-victory celebration,

47
00:39:41,982 --> 00:39:43,338
Streamers everywhere.

48
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,601
I'm so tired.

49
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:51,033
You're still losing blood.

50
00:39:52,129 --> 00:39:54,256
I wasn't able to stop it completely.

51
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:02,614
I'm going to take care of you.

52
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,633
It wasn't them.

53
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:18,290
I don't know what happened to our man.
But it's not them.

54
00:40:18,636 --> 00:40:20,667
They aren't able
to do that to a person.

55
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,177
Are you telling me
they had nothing to do with this?

56
00:40:24,652 --> 00:40:25,672
What happened?

57
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:30,010
Overload in the relays
proceeded by temporary disruption

58
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,512
of all shipboard systems,
lights to life support.

59
00:40:32,637 --> 00:40:33,805
How they did that?

60
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:35,335
They didn't.

61
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,351
- What caused it?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.

62
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,438
- They're making their move.
- It wouldn't be that obvious.

63
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:45,108
<i>Would you care to tell me
what's going on?</i>

64
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,434
We don't know.

65
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,279
One of my men is dead.

66
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:52,994
You need to know
that we had nothing to do with that.

67
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,451
<i>Yes, so I'm told.</i>

68
00:40:58,045 --> 00:41:00,499
I'm going to ask
for a show of good faith.

69
00:41:00,984 --> 00:41:02,230
<i>What do you want?</i>

70
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:23,428
How are you?

71
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,120
I'm fine.

72
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,047
We're all fine.

73
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:32,734
What is it that they want?

74
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:35,115
<i>Some of their people
are injured badly.</i>

75
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:38,370
I'm going to need medical supplies
to help them.

76
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:47,955
What's the point?

77
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,758
A goodwill gesture
doesn't have to accomplish anything.

78
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,427
Of course it does!

79
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:55,622
So they lack medical supplies.
Who knows what else they might lack?

80
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:56,950
Water?

81
00:41:57,075 --> 00:41:58,872
They'll get desperate,
make their move,

82
00:41:58,997 --> 00:42:00,851
then they'll be dealing
with the hostages.

83
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:04,521
There's only one way
this is going to end if we wait.

84
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,772
How do you know?

85
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,150
We don't even know
what's going on with the ship!

86
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:09,776
All the more reason to act now.

87
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,012
Rush is right.

88
00:42:14,595 --> 00:42:17,701
We have to take them down,
and we have to do it right now.
