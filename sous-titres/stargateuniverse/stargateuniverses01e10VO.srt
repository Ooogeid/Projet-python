1
00:00:02,074 --> 00:00:03,711
The design is clearly ancient,

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,124
launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

3
00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:07,629
Where the hell are we?

4
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:09,858
Several billion
light years from home.

5
00:00:09,983 --> 00:00:12,541
We are on a ship,
but we have no idea where we are

6
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,043
in relation to Earth.

7
00:00:14,168 --> 00:00:16,774
This ship could be
the most important discovery

8
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:19,035
mankind has made
since the Stargate itself.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,587
These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

10
00:00:21,712 --> 00:00:23,710
We've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

11
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:26,517
We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

12
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:29,450
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

13
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:32,847
Colonel, this chair pre-dates
those found in the milky way.

14
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,131
You want this chair to be
awonderful discovery,

15
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:36,637
that's fine, prove it.

16
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:38,095
I didn't steal anything!

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,747
- What's this?
- Those are mine!

18
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,645
I brought them when we evacuated!

19
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,675
- Where you going?
- What's your problem?

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,262
My problem is fat-asses like you
clogging up the hallway!

21
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:50,235
I've had it with you!

22
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:07,459
Looks like a sweet potato.

23
00:01:07,838 --> 00:01:09,934
That is so not going to be sweet.

24
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:13,155
How do you know?

25
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,036
Analysis we did
when we dug the first ones up.

26
00:01:16,322 --> 00:01:18,528
- Just to make sure it was safe.
- It's safe.

27
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,288
It's safe.

28
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:46,685
Now, that is one sweet potato.

29
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:51,997
Really?

30
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,204
Everybody try it!
Dig in.

31
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:03,523
Oh, my god.
I think I'm going to be sick.

32
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,332
It is food, people!

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,507
It will keep us alive.

34
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:09,438
Becker, boil 'em up, mash 'em up,

35
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,263
- and serve 'em up.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:12,667
Who's on KP duty?

37
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:15,885
Sergeant Spencer, but he should have
been here an hour ago.

38
00:02:22,673 --> 00:02:25,728
Sergeant Spencer, you have KP duty,
and you are late.

39
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:34,222
Spencer, get your sorry ass out of bed!
You have KP duty!

40
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,065
I do not have time for this, Sergeant.
Let's go.

41
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:00,532
What was wrong
with the old schedule?

42
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:02,973
I'm worried that we may be
pushing them too hard.

43
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,704
- It's not boot camp.
- No.

44
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:07,895
No, in boot camp you have opportunity
to learn from your mistakes.

45
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:10,867
Colonel Young,
this is Sergeant Greer.

46
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:13,025
Go ahead.

47
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,443
I'm in Sergeant Spencer's quarters.

48
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:18,113
He did not show up for duty.

49
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:20,809
I came by to check up on him.

50
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:24,071
Greer, what is it?

51
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,913
He's been shot, sir.

52
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:29,446
He's dead.

53
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:41,095
Projet-SG (1.00)

54
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:52,432
When did it happen?

55
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:55,860
Rigor's set in pretty good,
but not completely,

56
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:57,633
so I'd guess...

57
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:00,865
An hour either side of...

58
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,532
0200.

59
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:04,607
And no one heard the shot?

60
00:04:04,732 --> 00:04:07,256
He chose to have his quarters
away from everybody else.

61
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,989
Based on the blood on the wall

62
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:11,041
and the position of the body,
I'd say he was...

63
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,419
Sitting on the edge of the bed.

64
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,587
Suicide.

65
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:19,579
Why was he even allowed
access to a gun?

66
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:22,663
- He was a highly trained NCO.
- He was unstable, you know it.

67
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:25,782
- With duties that required to be armed.
- It was required of him?

68
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:29,051
- I have said it from day one that...
- It wasn't suicide.

69
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:33,512
- What are you talking about?
- Do you see a gun?

70
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,319
It was gone when I got here.

71
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,725
I checked the whole compartment.
Whoever did this took the weapon.

72
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:52,925
So, any suspects?

73
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:58,249
Excuse me for being blunt,
but there is a killer on board the ship.

74
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:02,207
Do we have any idea who did this?

75
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:04,813
I don't know. I'm still trying to
wrap my head around it.

76
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,938
- It's unbelievable.
- Is it?

77
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,956
You put ordinary people
under enough stress,

78
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,977
you'll find they're capable
of anything.

79
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:15,731
Add to that the fact
he was hoarding water and food,

80
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:18,489
involved in several confrontations,

81
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:21,063
I doubt you'll find many tears
shed over this man.

82
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,197
He was one of our own, Rush.

83
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:26,044
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
was he your friend?

84
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:32,635
Did he, in fact, have one single friend
on board this ship?

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,774
James hung out with him.

86
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,711
She... Tolerated him.

87
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,960
All right, so no one
could stand the guy.

88
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,341
Does not make it okay.

89
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,670
I didn't mean to suggest
that it did.

90
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,929
What I do suggest
is that Colonel Young,

91
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:50,546
you should find out
who this killer is quickly.

92
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:12,316
As I am sure many of you
have already heard,

93
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,110
Sergeant Spencer
was killed last night.

94
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,921
He signed the weapon out
of the equipment lock-up yesterday,

95
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,376
and the nine millimeter handgun
was not returned,

96
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:23,793
and is still missing.

97
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:29,054
I'm aware of how extremely disturbing
this is for all of us.

98
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:30,836
So,

99
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,645
this is what we're going to do.

100
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,060
Lieutenant Scott,

101
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:36,572
Eli,

102
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:37,563
Mr. Brody,

103
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:40,605
Lieutenant James
and Dr. Park were together

104
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,485
playing cards in the mess
at the time of the murder.

105
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,272
They can all corroborate
each others' stories,

106
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:48,297
which gives them an alibi...

107
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:51,934
I was in the control room all night.

108
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:54,505
- I was in the hydroponics lab.
- Check the kino footage!

109
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:58,934
I'm sure others will have alibis,
but some of us won't.

110
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,403
I was in my bunk sleeping at the time,
but I can't prove that,

111
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:05,841
and that makes me as much
of a suspect as anyone.

112
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:10,012
That is why I am turning over
full control of the investigation.

113
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:13,295
All right.

114
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,852
We are going to do
a room-by-room search,

115
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,357
starting with quarters,
until the weapon is found.

116
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,441
Now, everyone needs to stay here

117
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,629
until that search is complete,
but...

118
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:27,342
You are not searching my room
without me there.

119
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:30,407
Anybody who wants to be there

120
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,994
when their room is being searched
can come when their name is called.

121
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:35,850
That fair?

122
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:40,774
Dr. Franklin, you can be first.

123
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,212
Who else would like to
be present when their...

124
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:51,553
It'll take all day that way,
but we can do two at a time.

125
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:55,099
If that's what you want.
You two, follow me.

126
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:12,982
All right, Dr. Franklin,
stay near the hatch, please.

127
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,303
Guess I should be thankful
there's no cavity search.

128
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:35,993
That can be arranged, Franklin.

129
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,600
We don't like this any more
than you do.

130
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:41,301
Right.

131
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:51,831
There's nothing here.

132
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:54,640
You can just stay here now
until the all-clear.

133
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:04,025
You know, I understand the need
for a thorough investigation,

134
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,737
check all possibilities.

135
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:08,297
But you shouldn't lose sight
of the obvious.

136
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,131
What?

137
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,779
Sergeant Greer has to be
your number one suspect.

138
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,657
He killed Spencer,

139
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,347
ran away to hide the gun,

140
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,391
then went back and called it in?

141
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:21,390
Besides, if he did do it,

142
00:09:21,558 --> 00:09:24,436
- you'd have no evidence at all.
- Not helping your argument...

143
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:25,657
I'm just saying,

144
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:29,401
he's one of the few people
we can eliminate as a suspect.

145
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,390
Colonel Young, come in.

146
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,285
What is it?

147
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:42,860
I've found some new information
regarding the Ancient chair interface.

148
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,767
Have they checked your quarters?

149
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:46,705
I don't know. I've got work to do.

150
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:50,339
- Where are you?
- The control interface room.

151
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:52,886
I've come across
some interesting data...

152
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:55,235
You're supposed to be here,
waiting with the rest of us.

153
00:09:56,531 --> 00:09:59,556
Obviously neither one of us
has anything to do with this business.

154
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,826
That's not the point.

155
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:04,132
While this was going on,
we could keep working.

156
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,415
Obviously I was wrong.
Rush out.

157
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,150
Rush, get your ass
back to the gateroom.

158
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:14,565
Colonel Young,
this is Scott, come in.

159
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:17,047
Go ahead.

160
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:18,830
You're up, sir.

161
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:20,590
Do you want to be here, or...

162
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:22,776
No, you go ahead, I'll wait here.

163
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,154
There's obviously nothing here.
Let's move on.

164
00:10:47,424 --> 00:10:48,230
Come on.

165
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:54,826
What is it?

166
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:10,544
Colonel, this is Scott.

167
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,712
I need you to get down
here right away.

168
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:20,133
Where was it?

169
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:22,102
In the air vent.

170
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,473
The vent.

171
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,778
That's imaginative.

172
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:27,151
I didn't mean to look that hard.

173
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,465
That's okay.

174
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,314
I was the one
who authorized the search.

175
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:31,699
Right.

176
00:11:31,964 --> 00:11:34,776
- You don't believe I put it there?
- No, sir. Of course not.

177
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:39,323
Somebody's trying to frighten me.

178
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:40,824
Right.

179
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,550
This what I've been thinking.

180
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:45,078
We say that we found it
in a storage room.

181
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:48,081
Only the person who hid it
will know any better.

182
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:50,370
Maybe we can smoke 'em out that way.

183
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,914
Are we sure that that's a good idea?

184
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,421
He did not kill Spencer.

185
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,174
- I'm not saying that he did...
- This is someone

186
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,134
trying to undermine
the Colonel's authority.

187
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,927
- That can't happen.
- Eli's right.

188
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:03,552
I want you to take this gun to Wray,

189
00:12:03,677 --> 00:12:05,430
tell her where and how you found it.

190
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:06,600
Leave nothing out.

191
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,421
She'll know what to do.

192
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,105
I can't investigate myself.

193
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,356
You can't be asked to investigate
your immediate superior officer.

194
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:17,957
That leaves Wray.
We got to play this by the book.

195
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:20,856
But with all due respect, sir,
if the book covers this, I missed it.

196
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:23,072
I need you to listen to me.

197
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,280
Something's going on here.

198
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:28,830
If we get caught, this is going to turn
into a bigger mess than it already is.

199
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:31,915
So I need everything
above board, out in the open.

200
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,335
That is an order.

201
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,364
This looks bad.

202
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:44,596
- It doesn't prove anything.
- That's not the point.

203
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:46,717
This is a question of morale.

204
00:12:46,842 --> 00:12:49,226
A lot of people onboard
are going to have doubts.

205
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:53,643
Eli, you were flying a kino
in everyone's face last night.

206
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:55,857
Just until the poker game,

207
00:12:56,172 --> 00:12:57,172
Then...

208
00:12:57,991 --> 00:12:59,277
I put it in search mode.

209
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,089
Maybe it caught something.

210
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:04,491
Something that might indicate
that Young had nothing do with this.

211
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:09,256
Or that he did.

212
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,585
I find that hard to believe.

213
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:16,281
Have you contacted Earth yet?

214
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:20,521
I was just about to use
the communication stones.

215
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:23,052
Well, whatever
your superiors advise...

216
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,914
We are on our own out here.

217
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:29,805
Best we handle this ourselves.

218
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:45,403
Thanks for coming.

219
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,373
I need a favor.
You've heard about what's been going on.

220
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,381
That's pretty hard to miss.

221
00:13:56,506 --> 00:13:57,676
I didn't do it.

222
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:05,218
Unfortunately, it looks like
I'm going to have to clear my name

223
00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:07,228
before I can find out who did.

224
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,229
- I don't understand...
- Wray used the stones

225
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:13,435
Please.
To talk to her IOA superiors.

226
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,164
She came back authorized to hold
an evidentiary hearing on the matter.

227
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,149
- Doesn't sound so bad.
- Don't kid yourself.

228
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,776
She's going to come after me.

229
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,454
- Why?
- The IOA's been chomping at the bit

230
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:26,531
to have one of their own in charge.
This is the best shot they've got.

231
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,870
- You could talk to General O'Neill.
- Miss Armstrong, I could stay in charge

232
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,827
without having to run to General O'Neill
if that's what I wanted to do.

233
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:35,415
This is about more than that.

234
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,340
The point is,

235
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:39,806
if she's going to be
the de facto prosecutor,

236
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:41,296
I'm gonna need a defense.

237
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:43,237
So...

238
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,851
- Me?
- You went to harvard.

239
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:48,220
Political science.

240
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,901
This is more politics than law.

241
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:52,834
I would think Lieutenant Scott...

242
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,409
I don't want it to seem like
the military against the civilians.

243
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:00,490
Please.

244
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,080
Doctor...

245
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:06,017
Have you ever seen Colonel Young

246
00:15:06,142 --> 00:15:07,989
attack one of his own men before?

247
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:10,067
I wouldn't call it an attack.

248
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:16,021
He was defending me.

249
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,630
Have you ever seen Colonel Young

250
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:20,943
have any kind
of physical confrontation

251
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:22,395
with one of his men?

252
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:25,797
But I'm not military.

253
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,777
You did serve at Icarus base

254
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:30,703
for a period of six months,

255
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:32,794
which was under his command.

256
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,933
Spencer was out of control.

257
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,685
He had to do something.

258
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,855
Did he?

259
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:40,674
I was in the control room
running a test.

260
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,051
Colonel Young and Dr. Rush were...

261
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,518
Were talking.
I don't think they realized

262
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:46,894
that I could hear them.

263
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:48,693
And what were they saying?

264
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:52,801
Colonel Young was complaing
about Sergeant Spencer.

265
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,461
Said that he had gotten out of hand,

266
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,040
and if the situation didn't improve,
he might have to take,

267
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,821
drastic measures.

268
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:03,878
But you have no way of knowing
what he meant by that, do you?

269
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,505
Assuming you heard correctly.

270
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,881
No, not at the time. 

271
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,647
I don't remember
the exact details of the conversation.

272
00:16:10,164 --> 00:16:12,320
But you do remember
speaking with Colonel Young

273
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:13,963
about Sergeant Spencer.

274
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:17,642
The Colonel
was doing most of the talking.

275
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:20,154
I think he just wanted
to let off steam.

276
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,329
Do you remember him saying
that if things didn't improve,

277
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:25,984
he was going to have to take
drastic action?

278
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:28,169
I'm not sure he used
those exact words.

279
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,425
Do you agree

280
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,659
that Sergeant Spencer
was a disruptive force,

281
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:36,147
that his attitude

282
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:39,873
was damaging to morale
and was only getting worse?

283
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:44,992
Then would you say that his...

284
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:46,963
Removal from the situation

285
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,591
has been a net benefit,

286
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:51,219
or a detriment?

287
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:53,261
I know what you're trying to do.

288
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:55,533
You want me to suggest that...

289
00:16:56,387 --> 00:16:57,826
We're better off without him,

290
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:01,770
and therefore imply that Young
may have drawn the same conclusion.

291
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,795
That as Commander,

292
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:06,605
he may have believed
he had no choice.

293
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,954
That would be pure speculation,
and I'm having none of it.

294
00:17:15,431 --> 00:17:17,543
Didn't stop him
from saying it out loud, did it?

295
00:17:19,077 --> 00:17:21,205
Are you sure there's nothing
in the kino footage?

296
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:24,150
I've confirmed alibis
for half a dozen or so people,

297
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:26,238
but I haven't found anything
that helps him.

298
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,074
You found a empty bottle
of sleeping pills

299
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,124
in Sergeant Spencer's quarters,
didn't you?

300
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:35,925
Did you know he was taking them?

301
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:38,491
I wish I had.

302
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,725
I might have been able to help him.

303
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:44,046
You're suggesting
that he had a dependence,

304
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,940
and as a result,
that he was suffering from withdrawal.

305
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:49,526
It would explain a lot of things.

306
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,736
But you don't know that for a fact.

307
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:53,559
Hypothetically,

308
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,741
if he was suffering from withdrawal,
it could have caused him

309
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,370
anxiety, depression,
even suicidal tendencies.

310
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:03,331
In fact, all the physical evidence,

311
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,494
the blood spatter,
the angle of the wound,

312
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:06,876
the position of the body,

313
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,129
it was all consistent with suicide.

314
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,472
But you're not a forensic scientist.

315
00:18:11,597 --> 00:18:14,674
No, but I've seen
gunshot suicides before.

316
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,941
And in those cases,

317
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:18,757
was the gun ever absent
when the body was found?

318
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,305
No, but it's obvious
that someone planted...

319
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,965
- It's not up to you to speculate...
- Isn't it true, Lieutenant,

320
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,396
that if we were on Earth,
there is a simple test you could do

321
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,274
to determine if Sergeant Spencer
had fired that gun?

322
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,694
I suppose we could test his hand
for powder residue,

323
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,694
and properly test the weapon
for fingerprints,

324
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:37,336
but we don't have the necessary...

325
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:40,082
Is it possible
that a forensic scientist from Earth,

326
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:43,705
say, using the communication stones,
might have been helpful

327
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,969
even without the equipment
you're talking about?

328
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:49,328
If we hadn't handled the weapon
or contaminated the crime scene...

329
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:52,922
Yeah, but whose decision was it
to have us investigate this ourselves?

330
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:55,855
Ms. Wray, I think it was my turn
to ask questions.

331
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,051
What are you doing?

332
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,111
I'm taking my turn, as we agreed.

333
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:07,765
Would a proper autopsy
be able to determine

334
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,398
if he was in fact
suffering from withdrawal?

335
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:12,763
Expert or no expert,

336
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:16,755
without any actual forensic
equipment or facilities,

337
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:20,097
is it possible to know for certain
what really happened?

338
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:23,900
I don't think so.

339
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,874
I think it's time
that we take a short recess.

340
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:30,168
We'll resume in an hour.

341
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,341
Thank you.

342
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:38,961
I need to talk to you,

343
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,244
now.

344
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,352
What was that?

345
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,228
- We're trying to get to the truth here.
- I don't think that's possible.

346
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,189
We can't afford to have an unsolved
murder hanging over our heads.

347
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,386
So forget about the possibility
that the Colonel is being framed

348
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:56,740
- and just get this over with?
- I don't think Young

349
00:19:56,865 --> 00:19:59,643
is so far above reproach
as you seem to think he is.

350
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,450
You're the human resources person.
You would know all about that.

351
00:20:03,732 --> 00:20:04,948
In fact, you know more

352
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:06,937
about every person
on this ship than anyone.

353
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:10,250
If we're throwing due process
out the window, who do you think did it?

354
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,824
We'll just go with that.

355
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,480
You don't think he really did it.

356
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,369
I'm not so sure
what to think anymore.

357
00:20:17,494 --> 00:20:19,632
Spencer was a menace,
we all know it.

358
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:21,427
Maybe it's just like Rush said,

359
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,389
- he thought he had no other choice.
- No, that's crazy.

360
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:27,433
Well, let's face it,
how well do any of us really know him?

361
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,546
She wants to gather
all the evidence she can

362
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,020
and then put it to a vote.

363
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,755
- What, like a jury?
- No, everyone.

364
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:37,017
I say we end this right now.

365
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,015
I say we go in there,

366
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,823
tell 'em that the party's over,

367
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,720
and get back to work!

368
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:45,076
Who's with me?

369
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:49,133
All right, take it easy, Greer.

370
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,160
This is mob rule.

371
00:20:53,073 --> 00:20:54,878
This is what used to do
to guys like me

372
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:57,380
for looking at white women
the wrong way.

373
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,348
Now, you think I'm gonna hang back
and let this go...

374
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:04,929
Am I interrupting something?

375
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:06,234
No, sir.

376
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,099
At ease.

377
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,685
This has gone on long enough,
Colonel.

378
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,965
We're ready to back your play.

379
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,511
That won't be necessary.

380
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,529
Ms. Wray and I have already
come to an agreement.

381
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:22,447
She's going to close the investigation
for lack of evidence against me.

382
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,306
I, in return, will be stepping down.

383
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:27,085
From this moment on,
she's in command.

384
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:42,576
I hear congratulations are in order.

385
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:44,589
Really?

386
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:48,014
I was just wondering
what I'd gotten myself into.

387
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:50,684
An opportunity to do
things differently, perhaps?

388
00:21:51,212 --> 00:21:52,810
What do you want, Nicholas?

389
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:56,356
Control over my science team,
including Eli.

390
00:21:56,704 --> 00:21:58,150
But you report to me.

391
00:21:58,904 --> 00:21:59,918
Of course.

392
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,402
That's it?

393
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,986
You sound surprised.

394
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,787
- This is it?
- This is it.

395
00:22:18,912 --> 00:22:21,937
Not very impressive.
I mean, as far as chairs go.

396
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:24,211
Well, time will tell, I suppose.

397
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:26,680
So you sit in the chair,

398
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,795
it downloads the secrets of the universe
into your head?

399
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,890
Then you die.

400
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,517
Not necessarily, Eli.

401
00:22:32,822 --> 00:22:34,394
Every time it's ever been tried.

402
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,854
- This close to death.
- Who's tried it?

403
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,166
- General O'Neill, for one.
- And he survived.

404
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,651
We don't have little gray aliens
to set things right this time.

405
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,027
No, we don't, but...

406
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,072
this is an earlier model
of that same device,

407
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,532
possibly a prototype.

408
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,750
Built very early in their evolution.

409
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,038
In my experience, the 1.0 version
is usually the most buggy.

410
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,464
It's also the simplest.

411
00:22:56,522 --> 00:23:00,420
Maybe it's really simple.
It just tells you how to fly the ship.

412
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:04,590
I'm sure it's a bit more than that,

413
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,503
but your point is well made.

414
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,881
It's knowledge of this ship we need.

415
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,681
If we're to survive,

416
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,434
or for that matter,
get back to Earth one day,

417
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:16,853
then I'm convinced that this chair

418
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,438
is the only way to do that.

419
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,773
Maybe there's a way

420
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,851
of choosing what information
gets downloaded.

421
00:23:22,976 --> 00:23:26,112
Or it's just a matter of slowing down
the download so it can be cut off.

422
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:29,491
There's only one way to find out.

423
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:33,863
This is our priority now.

424
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:45,570
I don't get it.

425
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:50,401
If Wray admits that there's
not enough evidence against you...

426
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:53,704
There may not be enough to convict,
but there's plenty to cast doubt.

427
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:57,578
If I force the issue,
we risk dividing the crew.

428
00:23:58,259 --> 00:23:59,437
We can't afford that.

429
00:24:00,097 --> 00:24:01,814
These people need a real leader.

430
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,240
- Whether they like it or not?
- Maybe.

431
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:08,696
Nobody signed up for this,
and I can't just assume

432
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,972
they're going to follow my orders,
and I can't rule the ship by force.

433
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:13,734
I mean I won't.

434
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:17,996
All right.

435
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,559
You tell us that Wray is in charge,
that is fine,

436
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,654
but as far as me, and Tamara,

437
00:24:25,258 --> 00:24:27,281
and the enlisted personnel
are concerned,

438
00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:29,645
you are still
our commanding officer,

439
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,508
and nothing is gonna change that.

440
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,334
Still here?

441
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,943
Yeah, I got stuck
with the late shift.

442
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:46,193
How's it coming?

443
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:48,653
It's not.

444
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,782
We ran all Ancient systems diagnostic.
Nothing.

445
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:55,076
Rush is trying to write a new program,
but it seems like this thing

446
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:58,755
is designed to prevent any access
except through the chair itself.

447
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,860
Which would prevent an Alien species

448
00:25:00,985 --> 00:25:02,880
who doesn't happen
to share Ancient physiology

449
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:05,002
from trying to hack in, I guess.

450
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:06,778
Maybe Rush is right.

451
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:08,954
Maybe we're close enough
for it to work.

452
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:10,951
Believe me,

453
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,894
if Rush thought it was safe,
he'd be sitting there right now.

454
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:16,972
Maybe...

455
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,610
You should get some rest.

456
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:23,898
Rush is due to relieve me at 2300.

457
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,089
If I wasn't here,
I'd never hear the end of it.

458
00:25:29,118 --> 00:25:32,196
Maybe you could go to the mess
get me some alien mashed potatoes?

459
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:34,949
Really?

460
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:36,770
I'm starving.

461
00:25:41,595 --> 00:25:42,609
You got it.

462
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:07,202
This is Eli!

463
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:09,504
Anybody on this channel?
I need help!

464
00:26:11,452 --> 00:26:12,796
This is Young. What is it?

465
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:15,698
I have a medical emergency.
I need help now!

466
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:19,243
- What's...
- I don't know.

467
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:25,325
What happened?

468
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:33,716
How long's he been in here?

469
00:26:40,477 --> 00:26:43,794
I went to the mess for five minutes,
when I got back, he was on the chair.

470
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:57,808
Well, the convulsions have stopped,
but he's completely unresponsive.

471
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,259
He's basically
in a deep catatonic state.

472
00:27:00,597 --> 00:27:02,347
Is there anything
you can do for him?

473
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:06,540
We could try a high dose of lorazepam,
see if it'll bring him out of it,

474
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,258
but I'm flying blind here.

475
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:10,962
Do it.

476
00:27:25,985 --> 00:27:27,015
How is he?

477
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:31,010
You just couldn't wait, could you?

478
00:27:33,022 --> 00:27:36,473
Anyone who had access to that room
was ordered not to sit in that chair...

479
00:27:36,598 --> 00:27:37,488
You knew.

480
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,980
The temptation was there.

481
00:27:39,105 --> 00:27:41,799
In fact, you made sure of it
by telling them it was our only chance!

482
00:27:41,924 --> 00:27:43,160
You wanted somebody there

483
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:45,479
because you didn't have
the guts to do it yourself!

484
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:46,747
Both of you, stop!

485
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:51,670
It was under my authority,
so ultimately, it's my responsibility.

486
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,796
I know.

487
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,613
All right, we need to talk.

488
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,140
You've got those things running day
and night, all over the dang ship,

489
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:16,731
and you are telling me
not one of them saw something...

490
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:18,806
Anything out of the ordinary.

491
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:21,639
I've been over it twice,
there's nothing there.

492
00:28:21,764 --> 00:28:22,616
Look again.

493
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,870
He was framed, Eli.

494
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:29,294
We are going to find out by who,
and we're going to put a stop to it.

495
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:56,231
This is Brody in the gateroom.

496
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:03,783
Go ahead.

497
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:06,951
We have an active gate,
and we sent through a kino.

498
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:08,871
Atmosphere is nominal.

499
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,873
Temperature is in the green.

500
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:14,436
- We're good to go.
- I'll be there in a minute.

501
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,349
- May I have a moment of your time?
- I have to get down to the gateroom.

502
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,556
We're ready to send a team
to the next planet.

503
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:34,199
That's actually
what I wanted to talk to you about.

504
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,612
I notice that myself
and a few other marines

505
00:29:36,737 --> 00:29:39,072
were taken off
the away team duty list.

506
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,312
May I ask why?

507
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:42,949
Call it a...

508
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:44,938
temporary adjustment.

509
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,417
You thought it was me
who killed Spencer at first, didn't you?

510
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:50,738
You were a valid suspect.

511
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,523
If you can't deal with that,
it's your problem, not mine.

512
00:29:55,957 --> 00:29:57,336
Now, get out of my way.

513
00:30:02,115 --> 00:30:03,217
Yes, ma'am.

514
00:30:11,466 --> 00:30:13,227
But I'm not going anywhere.

515
00:30:17,844 --> 00:30:20,359
It doesn't look like there's
much vegetation around the gate,

516
00:30:20,856 --> 00:30:23,112
so you may have to widen
your search.

517
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,825
Lieutenant James and airman Rennie
will be providing security,

518
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,194
but you're in charge.

519
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,910
Congratulations.

520
00:30:42,992 --> 00:30:43,792
What?

521
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:46,158
I'm sorry.
I should have caught it.

522
00:30:46,283 --> 00:30:47,554
You have to look close.

523
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:55,468
- There's nothing there.
- Look at the time codes.

524
00:30:57,115 --> 00:30:58,361
They don't match.

525
00:31:00,435 --> 00:31:03,126
- Wait, what's that?
- That is a deletion.

526
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:06,197
I wouldn't have even noticed it,
except it caused a glitch in the code.

527
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,425
It's from the exact time
that Spencer was shot.

528
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,784
- So the kino did pick up something.
- It must have.

529
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:13,230
But if it's deleted,
how does it help us?

530
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:17,044
Because whoever did this was good,
but not good enough.

531
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:23,060
But I always back up the last two days
of footage on my hard drive.

532
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:24,583
Why?

533
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:26,483
My documentary.

534
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:29,894
I have to download it to my computer
before I can edit it.

535
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:32,615
If there's an ancient version
of iMovie in the database,

536
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,183
I haven't found it.

537
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:40,528
There.

538
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,279
Colonel Young, go to channel 2.

539
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,911
- What is it, Lieutenant?
- I've got something you need to see.

540
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:13,999
I tell ya, if I could change one thing
about the day we escaped from Icarus,

541
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,306
- I would've worn better shoes.
- Really?

542
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:19,466
Those are nice shoes.

543
00:32:22,284 --> 00:32:25,192
Seriously, how much longer
do we have to keep this up?

544
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,986
There's obviously nothing here.

545
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,203
Spoke too soon.

546
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:56,046
An alien ship?

547
00:32:57,116 --> 00:32:59,434
- Are you sure?
- That's what he said.

548
00:32:59,928 --> 00:33:01,277
How long till we jump?

549
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:04,106
Just over 2 hours.

550
00:33:04,361 --> 00:33:05,561
I'm on my way.

551
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:11,950
- I was just coming to get you.
- I have to get to the planet.

552
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,074
It can wait.

553
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,340
Look, they found the remains
of a crashed alien ship.

554
00:33:15,465 --> 00:33:17,734
There's very little time
before we jump back to FTL.

555
00:33:19,771 --> 00:33:20,871
It can wait.

556
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:25,002
It's been about a week
since I ran out of pills.

557
00:33:26,075 --> 00:33:27,505
Haven't slept much since.

558
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,215
I can't think.

559
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:33,068
Everything's...

560
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:36,388
I don't know.

561
00:33:37,756 --> 00:33:39,414
These people don't even realize

562
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:42,617
they're inside
a big floating coffin.

563
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:47,651
I wish I could come up
with something better to say.

564
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:53,844
I'm sorry.

565
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:01,997
The kino kept recording,

566
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,292
but the file must have gotten corrupted.
This was all I could get.

567
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,922
The point is, it wasn't there
when Greer found the body,

568
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:12,007
so we know someone took it,
along with the gun.

569
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:14,347
Who would have the skills
to delete the file

570
00:34:14,472 --> 00:34:16,505
- from the mainframe?
- It's not that hard, really.

571
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,201
Anyone with a basic knowledge
of the ship's computer.

572
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:21,526
At least a dozen people,

573
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:22,751
if not more.

574
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:27,512
I'm sorry.

575
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,120
I don't know what to say.

576
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:34,405
Obviously, we need
to re-think our situation.

577
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,405
Obviously.

578
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:39,409
We should recall the team
from the planet...

579
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,119
No, we can't do that.

580
00:34:41,773 --> 00:34:43,205
In over a dozen planets,

581
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,576
we haven't had a single indication
of advanced technology up until now.

582
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:51,236
This mess isn't going anywhere.

583
00:34:52,705 --> 00:34:54,790
He's right.
This ship could be important.

584
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,343
I'm going too.

585
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:00,199
- If you think it's really...
- I'm not asking permission.

586
00:35:00,324 --> 00:35:01,441
I'm telling you.

587
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:06,898
Let's go.

588
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:28,417
It's not Ancient.

589
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,427
That much we've figured out of them.

590
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:32,755
The material, the design,
it's different.

591
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,332
It's not emitting any radiation,
or EM fields.

592
00:35:35,457 --> 00:35:36,793
It's basically dead.

593
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:38,046
Have you been inside?

594
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:40,764
We've located a hatch,
but we haven't figure out how to get in.

595
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,064
We'd probably have to cut it open.

596
00:35:43,189 --> 00:35:44,817
How much time would that take?

597
00:35:45,285 --> 00:35:46,590
More than we have.

598
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,426
We're pushing it as it is.

599
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:51,152
Lieutenant, let's pack it up.

600
00:35:52,308 --> 00:35:54,109
Just give me
a couple of more minutes.

601
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,105
- It's going to make a difference?
- Well, it might.

602
00:35:58,185 --> 00:36:00,440
All right.
I'm willing to push it if you are.

603
00:36:00,861 --> 00:36:02,493
Take your team to the gate.

604
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:07,725
- Are you sure?
- We'll be right behind you.

605
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:11,531
Whatever you say.

606
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,326
Volker was right.

607
00:36:25,038 --> 00:36:26,176
This is unlike

608
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,932
any other kind of alien technology
we've encountered before.

609
00:36:31,705 --> 00:36:34,884
If they're indigenous to this universe,
they might be willing to trade.

610
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:37,089
Knowledge, information...

611
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:39,128
There has to be a way in.

612
00:36:39,686 --> 00:36:40,999
I know it was you.

613
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,660
I'm sorry?

614
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:45,915
The files...

615
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,696
were not corrupted.

616
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:50,415
The kino kept recording
until you came into the room.

617
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:52,918
Let's hear it.

618
00:36:53,347 --> 00:36:56,296
Let's hear how you lie
your way out of this one.

619
00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:07,839
I heard the shot.

620
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,812
I went to investigate.

621
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:14,940
Then I found him.

622
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:18,280
And then,
you decided to frame me for murder.

623
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:22,090
That's a bit melodramatic.

624
00:37:25,354 --> 00:37:28,537
I knew there wouldn't be
any real evidence against you.

625
00:37:29,842 --> 00:37:31,906
The idea was to create
just enough doubt

626
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,180
to get you to step aside.

627
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,794
I see.

628
00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:37,881
That was the idea.

629
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:40,869
You're the wrong man for the job.

630
00:37:42,195 --> 00:37:44,720
I'm sorry to have to say,
but I think you know it's true.

631
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:45,888
Do I?

632
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,433
You don't believe in the mission.

633
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:52,507
You resigned your position
as SG leader

634
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,662
because you didn't want to make
the hard decisions.

635
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:59,430
The life and death decisions.

636
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,581
That makes you a liability.

637
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,862
I'm not proud of what I did,

638
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:09,982
but I did it
for the benefit of everyone on board.

639
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:13,057
The end justifies the means.

640
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:16,043
Something like that.

641
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:51,538
Are we done?

642
00:38:52,673 --> 00:38:54,069
We'll never be done.

643
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,651
We shouldn't have left them.

644
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,404
- So we could get stuck there, too?
- No one is stuck.

645
00:39:26,004 --> 00:39:27,656
Not yet. How much time?

646
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:29,282
20 seconds.

647
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:48,969
Where's Rush?

648
00:39:49,673 --> 00:39:50,986
He didn't make it.

649
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:05,844
So, we just stayed too long.

650
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:10,475
On the way, Rush tripped himself up,
started a rock slide.

651
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,088
I was ahead,
but I barely made it through.

652
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,165
I just wanted you to know,

653
00:40:18,735 --> 00:40:22,198
that I've informed the crew
of the evidence that's come to light.

654
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,809
Since you've been
completely exonerated,

655
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:27,515
obviously you should resume
your duties as commander.

656
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,110
Tomorrow.

657
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,055
You need to rest.
She can be in charge one more day.

658
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,063
Thanks.

659
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:51,697
Shut the door.

660
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:02,448
The rest of the kino footage?

661
00:41:03,866 --> 00:41:05,516
Even Scott didn't see it.

662
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,670
I want you to make a copy for me,
put it on this,

663
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:11,046
and then delete it
from your hard drive.

664
00:41:20,181 --> 00:41:21,348
Anything else?
