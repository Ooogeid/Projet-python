1
00:00:00,956 --> 00:00:01,963
"Destiny."

2
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:03,711
The design is clearly ancient,

3
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:06,570
launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

4
00:00:06,695 --> 00:00:07,911
Where the hell are we?

5
00:00:08,036 --> 00:00:10,034
Several billion light-years
from home.

6
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:12,683
We're on a ship,
but we have no idea where we are,

7
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:14,232
in relation to Earth.

8
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:17,008
This ship could be
the most important discovery

9
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:19,301
mankind has made
since the Stargate itself.

10
00:00:19,426 --> 00:00:21,611
These are the wrong people
in the wrong place...

11
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:23,672
We've got wounded,
and we need to get home.

12
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:26,458
We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

13
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,904
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

14
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:32,689
We've got a problem when
one of the air vents shut down.

15
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:35,273
Our first priority must be
to seal off any of the leaks.

16
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:39,226
We can maybe buy ourselves a day or so
before the build-up of CO2 kills us.

17
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:42,208
We can't ask someone
to sacrifice themselves, period!

18
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,399
Dad! No! Wait!

19
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,573
- Looks like we've dropped out of FTL.
- The ship detected a Stargate

20
00:00:47,698 --> 00:00:49,909
on a planet within range
that may have what we need.

21
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:52,808
What we need's on the other side
of that wormhole.

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:19,978
Hot.

23
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:24,585
Cool.

24
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:38,264
- Make sure we can dial back.
- Already on it.

25
00:01:43,998 --> 00:01:45,992
- Looks like gypsum.
- That would be good.

26
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:48,821
Why?

27
00:01:49,337 --> 00:01:52,034
- We're looking for calcium carbonate.
- Calcite.

28
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:56,230
Gypsum is calcium sulphate,
which is 36% calcium carbonate.

29
00:02:05,406 --> 00:02:06,292
It dissolves.

30
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,544
Can we use this sand
to fix the scrubbers?

31
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,317
- That would be convenient.
- No.

32
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:13,063
It's a fair indication
that the components may exist nearby.

33
00:02:13,188 --> 00:02:15,168
For the sake of portability
and efficiency,

34
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:17,946
I'm hoping to find
high-concentration granular limestone.

35
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:20,148
We are looking
for the dried lake bed

36
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,589
or salt-water body
all this sand came from.

37
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,311
It's a desert.

38
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,061
Lime is formed mostly from the remains
of marine organisms.

39
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:33,461
- Are you saying there was life here?
- Not likely anything we've seen before.

40
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:41,711
The water may be gone now,

41
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:45,254
but this desert was formed
by H2O evaporating on a playa floor,

42
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,793
causing gypsum to be deposited
in a fine crystalline form

43
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,752
- called selenite.
- Where're you going?

44
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:51,849
Higher ground.

45
00:02:58,495 --> 00:02:59,869
What's supposed to happen?

46
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:03,293
If this sand is high enough
in calcite concentration,

47
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:05,059
the solution would absorb the acid.

48
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:07,864
- Right.
- The liquid would turn clear.

49
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:10,231
It's not.

50
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:15,528
We're good!

51
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,459
This is Scott.

52
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:22,972
Unfortunately, there's nothing useful
in the immediate vicinity of the gate.

53
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,125
<i>You have 12 hours, lieutenant.
Make 'em count.</i>

54
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:28,151
Copy that.

55
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:31,297
We're moving out!

56
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,765
Too bad we can't just use this sand.

57
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:42,264
There certainly is enough of it.

58
00:03:55,765 --> 00:04:02,992
 Projet-SG (1.00)

59
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,887
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

60
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:24,057
And neither am I, but we're...

61
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,496
We're still alive
because of what he did.

62
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:28,600
- For what it's worth...
- It's worth a lot.

63
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,055
And as long as we're still here,
I promise you...

64
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,031
Colonel,

65
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,535
I've edited lot of my father's speeches
to know what you're going to say,

66
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,686
You don't have a clue,
because I don't.

67
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:47,446
We brought along,

68
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:50,075
an ancient device,
communications stones,

69
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,524
- they allow us to...
- I know what they are.

70
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,933
Good, I'm about to use one of them

71
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:58,218
to report to my superiors on Earth,
tell them our situation.

72
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,648
I want to tell her myself.

73
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,320
You've been sitting here
since he made contact.

74
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:23,197
Let somebody take a shift.

75
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:26,425
I'm not leaving this chair.

76
00:05:27,174 --> 00:05:30,213
I've been on this for the last 6 months,
and I'll be damned if I...

77
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,196
Colonel?

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,428
This is strange...

79
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,431
Dr. Rush, is that you?

80
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:51,964
It's Colonel Young,

81
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,687
and I need you to put me in a room
with General O'Neill.

82
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,337
And I'm going to need you, too.

83
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:04,778
Sir, I told you not to get up!

84
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:08,826
What did he do to himself?

85
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,251
He's got cracked ribs,
more bruises than I can count,

86
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:13,407
and a concussion
that resulted in neuropraxia.

87
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,332
That's just great.

88
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:18,544
- Dr. Mehta.
- Can you help me, please?

89
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:27,632
I had some of my favorite arguments
with your father.

90
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:30,034
Are you saying you won some?

91
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,217
Depends on who you ask.

92
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,691
Major Green'll be escorting you
to see your mother.

93
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:44,757
Please...
Give her my condolences.

94
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,274
Thank you.

95
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,282
So how is it going out there?
Really.

96
00:06:57,727 --> 00:07:00,794
I don't know what Rush has told you.
We may not have much time left.

97
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:03,130
The ship's very old, falling apart.

98
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,257
- Fix it.
- We're trying.

99
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,413
Even if we can get
the life support working,

100
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:09,720
- we don't have much food and water.
- Go get some.

101
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,771
We're not supposed to be there, sir.
These are the wrong people

102
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:16,015
in the wrong place, and, as a group,
they're just not qualified.

103
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,977
Please.

104
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,109
I wasn't qualified to lead
that first team through the Stargate.

105
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:22,829
- I understand that, sir.
- In the past dozen years or so,

106
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:25,703
we've sent hundreds of teams
through that thing...

107
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:31,010
And, the bottom line is...

108
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:34,328
None of us are qualified.

109
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,911
I just think we're gonna get
to a point very soon

110
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:39,958
where everyone on board
should get a chance to say goodbye.

111
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:43,420
Understood.

112
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:00,521
Save it.

113
00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:04,003
That's not very smart.

114
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:06,290
Temperatures like these,
the human body needs...

115
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:08,054
Walk, don't talk.

116
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,710
Just FYI,

117
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:13,806
he's right about the whole
human body-and-water...

118
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:16,059
Walk, don't... Right.

119
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:22,789
Look.

120
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,378
More sand.

121
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,591
- This is pointless. We should go back.
- We just got here.

122
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,284
I still think we should be checking out
the other planets in range of the ship.

123
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,099
I still think you're wrong.

124
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:37,317
The solution's here.

125
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,920
I know it was a mirage,

126
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:11,620
but when we were walking
over that last dune?

127
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:16,074
I thought I saw the statue of Liberty
sticking half out of the sand...

128
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:17,537
Just for a second there,

129
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:19,576
I was all ready to yell:

130
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:21,852
"Damn you!

131
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,688
Damn you all to hell!"

132
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,356
Come on! That was funny.

133
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,074
Was it?

134
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:38,567
Because! It would mean we were really
on Earth, but in the future...

135
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:40,335
And the apes had taken over...

136
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,747
And then buried the statue of Liberty
for some reason.

137
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:45,417
- Have a drink.
- Greer, hold up!

138
00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:47,099
Hold up!

139
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:51,552
It's not gonna work.

140
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:54,152
- Not if we keep stopping.
- I'm saying we need to split up.

141
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,220
Fine with me.

142
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,806
- I agree. You should come with me.
- No, no, you're with me and Greer.

143
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:03,594
Sun's been moving that way,

144
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:05,604
we'll call it west...

145
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,505
Eli, Franklin, Palmer...
And curtis,

146
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:13,543
- you head that way.
- We'll test every 20 minutes or so.

147
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:15,768
After two hours,
you head south-east...

148
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:17,658
That should take you back
to the gate.

149
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:19,478
Wait a second.

150
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,621
Do we really think
that splitting up is the best idea?

151
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,331
I say we head straight back.

152
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:27,960
There's no point in crossing over
the same territory we've just crossed.

153
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:28,888
Or...

154
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:30,629
We could just stick together.

155
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:37,634
Look, Matt...

156
00:10:38,886 --> 00:10:39,828
I'm sorry,

157
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:42,308
I just have this really...

158
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:47,221
Really sick feeling
that you're gonna go that way...

159
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,210
And we're going to go this way...

160
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:52,641
Eli, I need someone that I can trust
to lead the second team, okay?

161
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:53,790
That is you.

162
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,515
Curtis is a good soldier, a tough guy.
He's not gonna let anything

163
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,230
- happen to you.
- Truth is...

164
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,344
I'm slowing you down,
you want to get rid of me.

165
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:03,787
I'm doing what I think
will best accomplish this mission.

166
00:11:04,757 --> 00:11:05,951
You asked to come.

167
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,973
I'm telling you how you can help me.
Now suck it up.

169
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:16,264
Okay, guys...

170
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:18,343
we're going this way.

171
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:19,592
Move out!

172
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:23,484
Radio if you find the lake bed,
we'll double back.

173
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:26,852
When you see the statue of Liberty,
you know what to say, right?

174
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,840
Right.

175
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:30,050
Now we can make some time.

176
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:55,297
She's here?

177
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:57,883
- Right now?
- Yes, ma'am, but as I've explained...

178
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,051
Mrs. Armstrong...

179
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,291
I know I look different,

180
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,317
and I sound different,

181
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:18,076
but it's me.

182
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:21,102
Mom, please.

183
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:23,901
I have something to tell you.

184
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:25,780
Mom...

185
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,287
Stop!

186
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,566
I'm sorry... It's just...

187
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:44,679
The thought
that you're actually on some ship...

188
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:47,265
So far away, I can't even imagine.

189
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:48,850
Mom?

190
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:51,009
Just tell me you're coming home?

191
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,606
I don't know...

192
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:58,390
Mom, please!

193
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,894
The ship is old and damaged.

194
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,604
We were losing air
and somebody had to...

195
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:15,357
He's dead.

196
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:17,879
He's dead, isn't he?

197
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,109
Where is everyone?

198
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,717
Able bodies are searching the ship
for anything that might have

199
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:43,441
CO2-sequestration properties,

200
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:45,614
and the rest are in crew quarters.

201
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:56,198
Colonel, we were able
to dial out to the planet again.

202
00:13:56,323 --> 00:13:58,628
Colonel Young and Chloe
are using the communication stones.

203
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,672
This is Colonel Telford, Dr. Mehta.

204
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,113
Right, okay.

205
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:07,806
Did you make radio contact
with the off-world team?

206
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:11,016
Yes, nothing to report yet.
They've split up.

207
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,185
How much time before
the ship jumps back to FTL?

208
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,715
Roughly nine hours.

209
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,727
Dial out every 20 minutes.
Maintain regular contact.

210
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:21,485
We do have power issues to be aware of.
Dialing the gate is a significant drain

211
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,904
on what seems to be limited resources
at this point.

212
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,248
The away mission
is priority one right now.

213
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:28,781
- Sir?
- I'm fine.

214
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:31,154
I understand that there are
other Stargates in range?

215
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,214
Four other addresses
came up in the system,

216
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,041
- but we seem to be locked out.
- Have you tried working around it?

217
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,751
Rush think that wasn't a good idea.

218
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:40,690
It makes sense to know
what our options are. Do what you can.

219
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,335
There is a reason why these addresses
are being disqualified.

220
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,550
If I wasn't being clear,
I was giving you an order.

221
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,221
If there are good reasons,
find out exactly what they are.

222
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,472
- Let's keep moving, I want to see more.
- You should rest.

223
00:14:53,437 --> 00:14:55,644
Sir, Colonel Young's body
needs time to recover.

224
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,374
- Give me something for the pain.
- The body feels pain for a reason.

225
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:00,433
- I would rather not mask it.
- Just do it.

226
00:15:00,558 --> 00:15:02,686
From the sounds of things,
you need my help here.

227
00:15:11,436 --> 00:15:13,229
All right, come on. Let's go.

228
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:16,830
You better save some of that.

229
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,750
- We need to slow down.
- We need to cover more ground.

230
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,371
It's gonna be impossible
to maintain this pace on the way back.

231
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:25,657
Maybe for you.

232
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,717
How tedious...

233
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:29,833
Little boys playing "soldier."

234
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:31,888
I've no interest
in playing that game.

235
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,975
I'm not playing, I'm trying to save
the lives of everyone on this ship.

236
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,060
If you continue at this pace,
we're gonna die...

237
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,585
Then maybe we will.

238
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:43,441
... light-years away
from the admiring eyes of your father,

239
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:45,944
or your drill Sergeant...

240
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:48,995
Or whoever's approval it is
you so desperately seek.

241
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:51,431
How dare you!

242
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:53,331
- Get up and move.
- Did you see that?

243
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:55,751
What?

244
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,891
I don't know...

245
00:16:01,182 --> 00:16:02,052
Nothing.

246
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:03,998
Let's move.

247
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,093
One hour... one hour,
and then we start circling back.

248
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:11,905
All right, fine.

249
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:43,419
- Just hold that there.
- Thank you.

250
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,980
What did you...

251
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:58,558
That was supposed to be for the pain.
What did you give to him?

252
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,465
A strong sedative,
which we are desperately short on

253
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,785
and I should not have had to use
so that Col. Young

254
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,833
can return to a body
in working condition.

255
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:08,139
You are out of line, Lieutenant.

256
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:11,613
Disregarding the health
of another human being is out of line.

257
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,384
I am well within my rights
as ranking medical officer.

258
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,603
He'll be out an hour or two.

259
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,411
What am I supposed to do?

260
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:22,832
I don't care.
I have other patients to attend to.

261
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:40,547
Something wrong?

262
00:17:43,705 --> 00:17:44,781
No, I'm fine.

263
00:17:46,494 --> 00:17:48,233
Good a place as any
to stop and test.

264
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,459
I take it that's not good?

265
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:56,605
No.

266
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,153
Hey, guys.

267
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,456
Another negative over here.

268
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:06,644
I'll radio Scott
and tell him we're moving on.

269
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:08,174
Yeah, but...

270
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:10,160
That's not what's going down.

271
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:13,466
- It's not?
- No.

272
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,761
There are four other viable addresses
in this thing.

273
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,380
I think I found an override
that'll allow us to dial from here...

274
00:18:20,505 --> 00:18:21,782
- But...
- Look around.

275
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:23,340
This planet is a dead zone.

276
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:26,563
We should've been trying to dial
these other planets.

277
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,996
- Rush said...
- We don't care what Rush said.

278
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:30,859
We don't trust him.

279
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:33,236
Rush doesn't want us all to die.

280
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,989
That doesn't mean we trust him
to make the right decisions.

281
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:37,633
You too?

282
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,702
What about the lake bed?

283
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:43,288
It could be hundreds of miles
from here.

284
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,915
We could be blowing our only chance
of finding a place to evac.

285
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:47,360
Maybe the ship

286
00:18:47,485 --> 00:18:50,028
did bring us here
because there's lime on this planet.

287
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:53,747
For all we know, the Ancients had a way
of locating it that we don't.

288
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:55,931
For that matter,
they could've stopped the ship

289
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:59,036
for longer than 12 hours to find it
and recover it with the proper tools.

290
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:01,676
The fact is, the Ancients wouldn't have
let the life-support system

291
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:03,475
get that screwed up
in the first place.

292
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:08,188
Rush is set on fixing the ship.
He's deaf to any other logic.

293
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,813
We need to find a planet
we can survive on.

294
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:12,942
This might be our last chance.

295
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,021
Gotta keep goin'.

296
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:26,688
Here.

297
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:29,083
Take it.

298
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,183
- I have my own.
- No, no.

299
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:32,925
I can't go on.

300
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:35,262
I'm never gonna make it back.

301
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,207
I know it's here.

302
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:39,187
You have to find it.

303
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:40,782
Take it.

304
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:47,560
- We're gonna leave him here?
- I'll make my way back to the gate.

305
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:50,271
- Go with him.
- I'm not leaving you here alone.

306
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,018
- Make sure he gets back alive.
- What difference does it make?

307
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:54,919
Because if I don't
find what we need,

308
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,094
he's going to be the one to find
some other way to save his own ass

309
00:19:58,555 --> 00:19:59,955
and yours along with it.

310
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:02,417
You're losing it.

311
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:04,881
I'll be okay.

312
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:12,866
<i>This is Eli. Come in.
If you can hear me, please respond.</i>

313
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:15,046
This is Scott, what's up?

314
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,412
We have a problem.

315
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:20,385
Franklin, Curtis, Palmer have given up
and are headed back to the gate

316
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,512
to try dialing the other
addresses in the remote.

317
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:26,015
<i>They have the kino. They don't think
we're gonna find the lime here.</i>

318
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:29,269
<i>They want to look for another planet
that will support life.</i>

319
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:32,232
- They'll get themselves killed.
- We need that remote

320
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,348
- to get back to the ship?
- That's not the point.

321
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,006
A few hours is

322
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:39,195
nowhere near enough time to determine
whether a planet is even safe,

323
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,115
let alone viable
for sustaining life.

324
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,295
The ship...

325
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:46,624
The ship's our only real hope
of ever getting home.

326
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:51,373
Stop them if you can.

327
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,000
I'll turn back when I have to.

328
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,176
- Yes, sir.
- Go!

329
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:00,289
You lead.

330
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:04,262
I'm sorry, excuse me.

331
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,931
Miss Armstrong,
we've got to get going soon.

332
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,766
You get my daughter home.

333
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:12,353
Everyone is doing the best they can,
I assure you.

334
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,772
- That's not good enough.
- Mom, it's not his fault.

335
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:19,485
I'm a personal friend of the President
and of the first lady.

336
00:21:20,223 --> 00:21:22,949
You tell your superiors
that if anything happens to her,

337
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,703
- I will go public with what I know.
- Mom...

338
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:28,244
I'm sorry, she's upset.

339
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:30,077
My husband...

340
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,528
Gave his life for my daughter.

341
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,655
You get her back to me,

342
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:38,445
or the whole world is going to know
what has been going on these past years.

343
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:03,125
- I need water.
- We're almost there.

344
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:07,339
I thought since I gave Scott my canteen,
we'd share.

345
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:09,092
And you were wrong about that.

346
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,149
I should've known.

347
00:23:12,697 --> 00:23:14,916
You think you know me pretty well,
don't you?

348
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:17,033
I helped choose the personnel

349
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:18,586
for Icarus base.

350
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:20,515
I read your file.

351
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,953
And neither you nor Captain Marvel
were on my list, I can tell you.

352
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,206
You think I care?

353
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:28,865
Give me some water.

354
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,214
Keep walkin'.

355
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:34,365
You think,
just because you were born poor,

356
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,205
that it gives you the right
to be angry at the world, how pathetic.

357
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,875
You think that's why I'm angry?

358
00:23:39,228 --> 00:23:40,576
If it wasn't for the army,

359
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:42,863
you'd be in jail, or worse.

360
00:23:45,112 --> 00:23:47,433
- That's what all you rich people think.
- Rich?

361
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,878
My father works in a shipyard
in Glasgow.

362
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:54,265
I earned a scholarship to Oxford
while I was working two jobs.

363
00:23:54,593 --> 00:23:57,984
I have got a right to make decisions
without explaining myself to you

364
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,396
or anyone else.
You give me some of that water!

365
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:02,576
Keep walkin'.

366
00:24:03,684 --> 00:24:05,050
Give me some of that...

367
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:08,167
Don't you ever touch me.

368
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:09,906
Give me some...

369
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:19,715
And you do that again,

370
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:22,357
and I'm gonna put a bullet...

371
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:25,713
- in your face.
- Really?

372
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,612
I don't think so.

373
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,108
You need me.

374
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,220
Otherwise,
you'd have gladly done it by now.

375
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,580
Right now, I pray to the God above
that dehydration will shut you up.

376
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,219
Walk!

377
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:41,683
Or die here!

378
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:43,471
It's your choice,

379
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:44,751
mister...

380
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,401
"decision-maker."

381
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:56,948
Looks like it's worth a shot to me.

382
00:24:58,171 --> 00:24:59,195
Let's do it.

383
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,492
Wait!

384
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:04,681
Stop!

385
00:25:04,806 --> 00:25:07,219
Look, it's not perfect,
but it's better than here.

386
00:25:07,344 --> 00:25:08,714
Vegetation, water, air...

387
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,109
- It's not too late to come with us.
- Don't go.

388
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:14,033
We'll dial back when we know it's safe
to evacuate everyone.

389
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:16,568
- You'll never get back home.
- You don't know that.

390
00:25:16,693 --> 00:25:19,485
Maybe there's a way to use
the gate system to connect the dots.

391
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,837
There has to be a reason
the ship locked out those addresses!

392
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:23,999
Don't.

393
00:25:24,341 --> 00:25:25,160
Please?

394
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,378
Shoot him!

395
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:48,614
Why did you do that?

396
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,133
He told me to.

397
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,959
We saved his life.

398
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,791
- By shooting him?
- He'll live.

399
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,789
You just stranded them.

400
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:06,397
We'll send them another remote.
I wasn't taking any chances.

401
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,263
- Where's Scott?
- Still looking for limestone.

402
00:26:10,506 --> 00:26:11,837
It's almost half-time.

403
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:13,965
We only have six hours
before the ship leaves.

404
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:16,741
Lieutenant, this is Greer. Come in.

405
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,812
I hope he's turned back by now.

406
00:26:19,136 --> 00:26:20,143
Lieutenant!

407
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:22,992
Come in?

408
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:13,872
You must keep going, my boy.

409
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,259
Don't give up.

410
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:18,944
I don't need you to tell me that.

411
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:30,872
I'm not going to let anyone else down
the way I let you down.

412
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:35,510
You really don't have
to follow me around to remind me.

413
00:27:37,132 --> 00:27:38,443
He has his plan...

414
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:41,265
For all of us.

415
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:51,012
He's either out of radio range

416
00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:54,812
or he's lying face-down in the sand,
dead, or soon-to-be.

417
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,707
I'm going back for him.

418
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,405
Well, that's great... suicide.

419
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,249
I'm not leaving him out here.

420
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,275
- I'll go with you.
- You're gonna slow me down.

421
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,243
This man has to get back.
He needs medical attention.

422
00:28:08,368 --> 00:28:09,192
Dial.

423
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,605
He can take Franklin back.
You wait here for me.

424
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:14,639
You have five hours to find him
and get back here.

425
00:28:14,764 --> 00:28:16,610
It has not been a pleasure
knowing you.

426
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:23,342
- What do I need that for?
- Just in case.

427
00:28:24,054 --> 00:28:24,994
In case what?

428
00:28:26,562 --> 00:28:28,450
I don't even know
how to fire this thing.

429
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,933
You'd better be here.

430
00:28:37,203 --> 00:28:38,053
I will.

431
00:28:49,232 --> 00:28:50,387
I have a gun.

432
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,820
Why do I feel like
I've been drugged?

433
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,700
- Good to have you back, sir.
- Son of a...

434
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:05,117
What the hell was Telford doing?

435
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:08,248
You're going to need this.

436
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:16,003
There they are.

437
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:17,463
Hurry up.

438
00:29:18,213 --> 00:29:20,125
- Come on, help him.
- What happened?

439
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,140
Greer shot him.

440
00:29:23,455 --> 00:29:24,303
Water?

441
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,417
That was my ration for the day.

442
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,606
What's going on?

443
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:42,841
We've had a lovely day at the beach.

444
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,561
How about you?

445
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:21,751
I have sinned, father.

446
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,555
I've failed you.

447
00:30:25,853 --> 00:30:27,056
I've failed him.

448
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:31,108
I've failed myself.

449
00:30:33,034 --> 00:30:35,082
We have redemption
through his blood.

450
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:57,081
This is Eli.
If you can hear me, please come in.

451
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:04,278
Please, respond.

452
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:19,585
Do you love her?

453
00:31:21,356 --> 00:31:22,875
She's not going to have it.

454
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:25,354
You're sure?

455
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:27,011
She's 16.

456
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:30,721
We barely even know each other.

457
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,580
What are you going to do?

458
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:38,008
I don't know...

459
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:40,731
About anything.

460
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,018
I thought...
He was my calling.

461
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:48,257
But now...

462
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,560
I am sorry.

463
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:00,627
Why?

464
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,849
I'm the one who's weak.

465
00:32:03,782 --> 00:32:04,925
It's my fault.

466
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:07,626
It isn't.

467
00:32:08,872 --> 00:32:10,035
It's not yours.

468
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,641
This is Scott! Come in!

469
00:33:20,344 --> 00:33:22,750
I found it, I found the lake bed!

470
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:24,812
I've got the lime!

471
00:33:28,357 --> 00:33:29,407
Oh, my God.

472
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:32,241
If you can hear me, wait!

473
00:33:33,005 --> 00:33:34,511
Just wait, I'm coming!

474
00:33:54,987 --> 00:33:55,987
Which way?

475
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:00,661
Move out.

476
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:32,260
Drink!
Come on, Scott, come on.

477
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,135
Take the bag!

478
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:37,745
There's no time!

479
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:40,519
- You have to take it.
- Yes you can.

480
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:43,640
- No, I can't make it.
- Get the hell up! Come on!

481
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,603
I can't make it.

482
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:50,189
I can't carry you and this!

483
00:35:50,953 --> 00:35:52,370
Get your weak ass up!

484
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,026
Come on!

485
00:35:54,794 --> 00:35:55,938
Come on, soldier!

486
00:36:01,082 --> 00:36:03,676
Less than three minutes
before the ship jumps again.

487
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:04,817
Incoming!

488
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:20,120
I'll stay.

489
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:21,895
It's okay.

490
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:23,923
I got it.

491
00:36:36,242 --> 00:36:37,248
Sorry, sir.

492
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:39,071
You did your best.

493
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:51,875
Less than one minute.

494
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:01,969
I see them.

495
00:37:05,128 --> 00:37:06,640
They're carrying something!

496
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:08,133
We've got it!

497
00:37:08,457 --> 00:37:10,693
Don't go! We've got it!

498
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,412
They've got the lime!

499
00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:16,024
- And they're not going to make it.
- 40 seconds.

500
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:19,873
Give me the radio.

501
00:37:25,214 --> 00:37:28,537
I want you to stick your arm
into the event horizon of the puddle.

502
00:37:29,616 --> 00:37:30,789
Seriously?

503
00:37:31,135 --> 00:37:32,082
Are you sure?

504
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,209
No, but I'm betting there's some

505
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,045
kind of a safety protocol prevents
someone being cut-off while en route.

506
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,764
But what if there isn't?

507
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,008
20 seconds.

508
00:37:42,186 --> 00:37:43,452
Eli, do it now!

509
00:37:58,515 --> 00:37:59,523
Come on.

510
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:01,868
Come on!

511
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,740
Five, four, three,

512
00:38:05,154 --> 00:38:06,759
two, one.

513
00:38:31,412 --> 00:38:32,419
Thank you.

514
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:35,553
Scott, look at me.

515
00:38:35,678 --> 00:38:37,856
Lieutenant, look at me.
Look at me!

516
00:38:40,323 --> 00:38:41,958
Well done, Eli. Well done.

517
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:19,889
Look.

518
00:40:17,722 --> 00:40:19,360
I brought you some water.

519
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:22,589
I still have some.

520
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:25,741
- You really need to drink it.
- I'm fine.

521
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,576
Everyone appreciates what you did.

522
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:38,268
Rush say how long it will last?

523
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:40,880
He's not sure.

524
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:45,484
How are you?

525
00:40:55,673 --> 00:40:59,587
My parents died in a car crash
when I was four years old.

526
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:02,250
I'm sorry.

527
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:05,295
The priest, who raised me,

528
00:41:06,787 --> 00:41:10,050
he pretty much drank himself
to death when I was 16.

529
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:13,194
- My God.
- I'm sorry, I'm not trying to,

530
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:16,670
diminish what you're going through.

531
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:19,233
- I know.
- I think my point is...

532
00:41:21,963 --> 00:41:24,236
There's just some things
you never get over.

533
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,998
That's just the way it is.

534
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:41,832
You go on, though.

535
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:46,579
The best that you can.
