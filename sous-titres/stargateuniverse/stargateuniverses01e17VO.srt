1
00:00:00,497 --> 00:00:03,461
This is what <i>Destiny</i> intended
from the moment it entered the system.

2
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:09,091
We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:12,373
The ship came here for a reason.

4
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:15,754
<i>Destiny</i> is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:19,644
He and Young are bumping heads.

6
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,026
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:23,686
We pretend nothing happened.

8
00:00:23,996 --> 00:00:26,146
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:27,902
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,237
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,339
Dad, wait!

12
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:35,576
The Icarus project is something
your father truly believed in.

13
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:36,577
A son?

14
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:37,982
What's his name?

15
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:39,107
Matthew.

16
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:42,708
The few times I was conscious,
they were probing my mind.

17
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,405
It's something
I'd rather not think about, really.

18
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,514
There a reason your radio's off?

19
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:53,411
You couldn't find a broom closet?

20
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:34,385
What are you doing?

21
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:37,902
I should go.

22
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,267
What?
Why?

23
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,741
I can't be doing this.

24
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,220
Right.

25
00:01:49,897 --> 00:01:51,613
You say that now that you're done.

26
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,400
You knew what you were getting into.

27
00:01:57,763 --> 00:01:59,827
You know what?
No. Screw that.

28
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:02,938
I am not going to let you
kick me aside like you did before.

29
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:04,962
Whatever.

30
00:02:09,302 --> 00:02:10,087
Move.

31
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:13,007
Me or her.
You can't have both.

32
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,426
I never said I wanted both.
Now, move.

33
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:17,386
Me or her, Matt...

34
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,954
Get out of my way.

35
00:02:53,341 --> 00:03:00,556
Projet-SG (1.00)
www.projet-sg.com

36
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:23,828
Start to Dr. Volker.
Anybody in the control interface room?

37
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:30,376
How about anybody at all?

38
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,345
Anybody?

39
00:03:45,212 --> 00:03:46,212
You okay?

40
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:49,374
Yeah, the door control doesn't work.

41
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:54,582
No, you don't have to...

42
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:07,115
Stupid ship.

43
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:37,855
Where is everybody?

44
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:39,785
I don't know.

45
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,989
The room was empty when I got here.

46
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:45,868
- Can I help you with something?
- What are you doing?

47
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,078
Nothing you need to worry about.

48
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:49,864
I like to worry.

49
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:55,952
I was just updating
some personnel files.

50
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,846
In the gateroom.

51
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:02,835
Colonel Young and Dr. Rush
know all about it,

52
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,553
in case you'd like to talk to them.

53
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:06,171
I'll do that.

54
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:18,984
Have you seen Matt?

55
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:22,368
I have not.

56
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:30,784
<i>Lieutenant James, come in!</i>

57
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:37,924
<i>Lieutenant James, this is Colonel Young.
Please respond.</i>

58
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,348
<i>You're late
with the current ammunition count.</i>

59
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,879
<i>Lieutenant, what are you doing?</i>

60
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,255
Nothing, sir.

61
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,545
I'm fine.

62
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,914
I am...

63
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,030
I just lost track of time,

64
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,490
but I'm on my way now.

65
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:08,981
James out.

66
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:17,170
So I heard that Colonel Young's
calling off the search for Franklin.

67
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,628
No one was really looking for him.

68
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,089
The man just vanished.

69
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,257
Weird.

70
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:30,844
Dunning...

71
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:32,918
Come on.

72
00:06:45,303 --> 00:06:46,503
What the hell?

73
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:09,970
You okay?

74
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:15,012
Something weird's going on here.

75
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:18,726
What is it?

76
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,391
You look tired.
Maybe you should go lie down.

77
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:33,715
Maybe I will.

78
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Matthew?

79
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:18,293
Something wrong?

80
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:20,165
I need to talk to you,

81
00:08:20,673 --> 00:08:22,709
- about something...
- Just the two I need to see.

82
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:26,782
Am I interrupting something?

83
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,350
- No.
- Good.

84
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,451
I wasn't even in the gateroom today.

85
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:33,921
He said it was empty?

86
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,648
Only person in the room was Wray,

87
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:39,309
working at one of the consoles,
updating the files.

88
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:41,637
Said you told him that Rush
and I knew all about it.

89
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:43,653
I don't know anything about this.

90
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:47,151
And I don't know what to tell you,
Colonel, other than he's lying.

91
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,819
He has no reason to lie.

92
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:50,877
Please.

93
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:52,573
Sergeant Greer has had it in for us

94
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:54,813
since the first day
we came aboard this ship.

95
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,745
Correction. Since the day the two of you
led a mutiny to take it over.

96
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,414
I can understand his suspicion.

97
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,168
I was not in the gateroom.

98
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:14,764
Are you all right?

99
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,210
You didn't pass anyone
in the corridor just now?

100
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,100
Matt, what happened?

101
00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:26,177
<i>We need help in the work-out room!</i>

102
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:29,521
<i>Anyone from the military,
as many as possible! Now!</i>

103
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,203
Get it out!

104
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:37,896
Get it out! Get it out!

105
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:39,998
He thinks a snake is
crawling under his skin.

106
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:41,957
Get it out!

107
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:52,426
A snake?

108
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,761
He said it was crawling around
under his skin, but no one saw anything.

109
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,919
He just flipped out.

110
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:00,164
I can't find anything
physically wrong with him

111
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:02,684
other than the wounds
that he inflicted on himself.

112
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,017
Have you noticed
any unusual behavior from him lately?

113
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,064
He's been his normal self.

114
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,451
As far as I can tell.

115
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,546
All right, well, let's...

116
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:16,393
Let's keep him here,
close eye on him

117
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,326
and let me know when he awake.
I want to talk to him.

118
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,871
No warning or anything?

119
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,748
He just went nuts?

120
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:26,875
Yeah.
Some kind of nervous breakdown.

121
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:29,439
It was pretty scary.

122
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:32,291
Tearing gashes in your own arms?

123
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:34,091
That's intense.

124
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,927
The stress of life on this ship?
Day after day of not knowing

125
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,245
what's ahead?

126
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:41,056
It's a wonder
more people aren't cracking up.

127
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:44,635
I'm just glad
he took it out on himself.

128
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:49,272
And didn't start shooting people.

129
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:55,612
You all right?

130
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:01,272
Hello? Earth to Greer?

131
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:09,248
I'm fine.

132
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:16,926
I always figured
he'd be the first to snap.

133
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,110
If you want to accuse me
of something, come forward.

134
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:37,685
No need for spying.

135
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:42,313
Who you talking to?

136
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,063
Apparently no one.

137
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:12,711
Help!

138
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:15,567
Someone help me, please!
Get me out of here!

139
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:20,364
Wait!
Get me out of here!

140
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,989
- Where the hell is she?
- I don't know, sir.

141
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:46,239
I tried to radio her.
She's not responding.

142
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,559
Lieutenant James, come in!

143
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,701
This is Colonel Young.
Please respond.

144
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,992
I'm so sorry.

145
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:45,281
You can't be real.

146
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,828
Why did you leave me?

147
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:08,032
Yeah, Colonel, go ahead.

148
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,533
<I>I need you in the infirmary.</I>

149
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:23,323
- You're alive?
- She thinks she killed you.

150
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:25,113
How did you...
You were in my room.

151
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,199
You're hallucinating.
Just like Airman Dunning.

152
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,024
- What the hell is going on here?
- We don't know yet.

153
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,705
- I can't find anything wrong.
- I'm seeing things too.

154
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,954
Hallucinations.

155
00:14:38,563 --> 00:14:41,296
My son.
I keep seeing him on the ship.

156
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:42,464
I just...

157
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:44,693
I just talked to him.

158
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:47,802
Your away team.

159
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:51,349
James and Dunning went off-world
with you to the last planet.

160
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:52,933
Maybe they picked something up.

161
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:55,502
We didn't ingest anything that...

162
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:57,892
It could've been airborne,
any number of possibilities.

163
00:14:58,017 --> 00:15:00,398
Corporal Barnes was
on the away team as well.

164
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,025
So was Dr. Volker.

165
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,002
Help!

166
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:05,890
Oh, please, somebody help me!

167
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:07,697
Colonel, we got him.

168
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:12,611
Nothing?

169
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:15,361
No weird things
out of the corner of your eye?

170
00:15:15,486 --> 00:15:16,672
Disorientation?

171
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,900
Feeling pretty much
the way I always do.

172
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:22,712
Hungry, tired,
but I'm not seeing things.

173
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,799
Maybe she's immune to whatever it is
the others picked up.

174
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:28,843
Maybe her symptoms are just
taking longer to show up.

175
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,030
Thanks.

176
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:33,007
- But physically, they're okay?
- So far as I can tell, yeah.

177
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,274
No, he's doing fine, but I'm going
to quarantine the entire away team.

178
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,140
Hopefully isolate the hallucinations
until they pass.

179
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:41,325
What if they don't pass?
What if it gets worse?

180
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,275
I'm sure whatever it is,
TJ'll figure it out.

181
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,569
I mean, she's done
pretty damn good so far.

182
00:15:46,464 --> 00:15:47,897
Is there anything I can do?

183
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:49,461
No. No, I'll pass the word.

184
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:52,829
I'll let everyone know what's going on,
but the situation's been contained,

185
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:54,899
so there's no need
for anybody to get alarmed.

186
00:15:55,024 --> 00:15:57,679
- As soon as I know anything...
- <I>Colonel Young, come in</I>.

187
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,503
<I>Can you come to the infirmary?
I just discovered something.</I>

188
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:05,422
You see?

189
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,097
So, it's difficult to see,

190
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:09,217
which is why I missed it
on my initial examination.

191
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,658
You see right there?

192
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:12,223
Yeah, it looks like a tick.

193
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:14,145
I checked the others.

194
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,094
They all have one, same spot,
top of the neck there.

195
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,086
All except Corporal Barnes.

196
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,277
She's clear.

197
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:22,760
Welcome to our new galaxy.

198
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:26,454
So, the ticks are causing
the hallucinations?

199
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,872
I don't know for sure,
but I think so.

200
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:30,697
Maybe they inject a venom,

201
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,700
some sort of toxin
that affects the brain's chemistry.

202
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,078
Okay, I want out.

203
00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:37,829
Get me out of here.

204
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:40,373
- I want out of here, TJ.
- Okay, just relax, okay?

205
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:51,926
Can you remove it?

206
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,712
They seem similar to Earth ticks.

207
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:55,954
I could try and remove it
the same way.

208
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:58,808
You up for going first?

209
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:29,441
- What happened?
- I don't know. He's crashing.

210
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:30,814
Let's start CPR.

211
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,592
He's breathing.

212
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:50,610
He's back.

213
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,154
All right.
Did we get it? We remove it?

214
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,579
It's dug in even deeper.

215
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:13,562
His pulse is normal.
BP's back in range.

216
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:16,678
Listen...

217
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:19,541
Is removing them impossible?

218
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:24,144
It's just when I tried to pull it off,
it must have released more toxin.

219
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:25,968
I just have
to figure out another way.

220
00:18:26,093 --> 00:18:27,147
Get to it.

221
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,625
Hello?

222
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,616
Hello, sweetheart.

223
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:30,752
It's all right.

224
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,712
It's really me.

225
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:34,561
No, you're...

226
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:36,299
You're not real.

227
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:38,551
Oh, God.

228
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,605
No, this isn't happening.

229
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:46,262
Look at me.

230
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:52,023
Whether I'm real or not,

231
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,419
aren't you...

232
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:56,277
at least happy to see your old man?

233
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:03,833
I have missed you, sweetheart.

234
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:12,502
I've missed you so much.

235
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,896
- So, where do you want to put 'em?
- If we do this, then we could...

236
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,585
What's going on here?

237
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,827
What do you mean?

238
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,977
- We're just talking.
- About what?

239
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,328
Is something
bothering you, sergeant?

240
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:55,157
I don't know.
Should there be?

241
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:56,967
If you've got something to say,

242
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:59,484
why don't you just
go ahead and say it?

243
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,469
You're not taking over
this ship again.

244
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:08,462
- We've no intentions of doing so.
- You're being paranoid.

245
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,487
I know you're up to something.

246
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:15,815
And you have proof of this, do you?

247
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:22,238
Of course you don't.

248
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,314
Are we done here?

249
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:46,201
We haven't had any luck yet
figuring out a way home.

250
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:49,641
God knows if we ever will.

251
00:21:51,995 --> 00:21:54,187
We do have the communication stones.

252
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:57,018
I was able to use them
to go see mom.

253
00:21:57,996 --> 00:21:58,816
How is she?

254
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:01,496
Strong.

255
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:03,682
Fragile.

256
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:08,380
Doing her best, considering.

257
00:22:09,472 --> 00:22:10,578
She's a fighter.

258
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,792
Like you.

259
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:19,337
Sometimes I see you in my dreams.

260
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:22,006
But they always end the same.

261
00:22:28,116 --> 00:22:30,332
I'm trying to get through this,

262
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,013
but it just gets so...

263
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:37,146
One step at a time.

264
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,089
Look at that view.

265
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:44,946
God, I've never seen
anything like it.

266
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:49,432
I always dreamed
that you would live a life of adventure.

267
00:22:49,557 --> 00:22:51,452
- Travel the world.
- I know.

268
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:54,414
- You told me frequently.
- Well, look at you now.

269
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:58,611
Sailing through the universe,

270
00:22:59,183 --> 00:23:02,302
exploring galaxies and planets.

271
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:08,928
You're living my dream, kiddo.

272
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:16,556
What do you got?

273
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:19,397
The venom we extracted
from the jungle planet creature.

274
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,275
It worked as an anesthetic
on Rush during his surgery.

275
00:23:23,036 --> 00:23:25,629
I think that if I apply it
topically to the tick...

276
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:27,485
Knock it out,
give you time to remove it.

277
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,489
That's great.

278
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:31,994
Oh, he's coming to.

279
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,242
What happened?

280
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:35,296
You got a jolt
when we tried to remove the tick.

281
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:36,801
Relax, just relax.

282
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,255
We're going to try
to anaesthetize it,

283
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:43,468
and then I'll try and see
if I can remove it safely, okay?

284
00:23:46,535 --> 00:23:47,842
Let's just take a look here.

285
00:23:56,495 --> 00:23:57,495
It's gone.

286
00:23:58,424 --> 00:23:59,424
The tick.

287
00:24:00,145 --> 00:24:01,397
It just died off?

288
00:24:01,824 --> 00:24:03,107
I don't know.

289
00:24:10,554 --> 00:24:13,044
- Theirs are both still attached.
- Volker as well.

290
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:14,911
Could it have jumped?

291
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,800
Yeah, no, I remember.

292
00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:28,606
Gosh, that's so funny,
I feel like that was forever ago.

293
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:36,836
What are you doing?

294
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:43,397
What's wrong?

295
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:49,557
- I'm fine.
- Really?

296
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:51,783
'Cause you don't seem fine.

297
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:55,197
My father's here.

298
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:58,454
I mean, I know he's not...

299
00:24:59,813 --> 00:25:01,178
here.
I'm just...

300
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:02,303
Just...

301
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,608
Hallucinating?

302
00:25:07,503 --> 00:25:09,734
It's really strange.

303
00:25:10,504 --> 00:25:11,627
He's so...

304
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:14,428
real.

305
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,220
You're seeing him right now?

306
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:17,181
Where?

307
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,010
Right beside me.

308
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:25,730
He can't hear you.

309
00:25:32,175 --> 00:25:35,116
We've got to get you to the infirmary,
just have TJ take a look...

310
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,285
No, I already know what's wrong.

311
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:38,828
There's a tick on me.

312
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:40,872
Matt and his team picked them up.

313
00:25:41,244 --> 00:25:44,143
- One must have jumped to me somehow...
- Wait a minute, what?

314
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:46,679
An alien tick?
Are you kidding me?

315
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:49,245
TJ thinks it might inject
some kind of toxin that causes...

316
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,506
We have to go...

317
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,176
No! No, wait!
It doesn't hurt.

318
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:56,033
- That's not the point...
- And he's not hurting me either.

319
00:25:56,158 --> 00:25:58,742
He?
You mean your imaginary father?

320
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,725
I'm not crazy.

321
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,310
I know what's going on.

322
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,307
I know that he's not real,
but I can't...

323
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:13,408
I'm not ready
to lose him again, okay?

324
00:26:18,305 --> 00:26:20,328
You can't let that thing
stay on you.

325
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,182
I know, okay?

326
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:23,307
I know.

327
00:26:24,118 --> 00:26:24,957
Just...

328
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,665
Humor me, all right?

329
00:26:27,242 --> 00:26:28,664
Give me some time?

330
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:30,999
I'll go see TJ soon,

331
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:32,831
I promise,

332
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:35,042
but for now, just...

333
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:38,179
don't tell anyone, okay?

334
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:40,051
Please, Eli.

335
00:26:55,186 --> 00:26:56,405
Okay, Sergeant, I've...

336
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,576
I don't see anything.
You're clear, too.

337
00:27:43,043 --> 00:27:43,992
What happened?

338
00:27:44,117 --> 00:27:46,518
I want you to go back to your quarters,
and stay there until...

339
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:48,353
- Just a precaution.
- I need to...

340
00:27:48,478 --> 00:27:49,750
Cole can take over for you.

341
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,927
No, Colonel, please, I'm fine.

342
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:55,678
We'll check ourselves periodically,
and if I start hallucinating...

343
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,257
She was in here earlier.

344
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,520
I'll go find her.

345
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,693
Ready?

346
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,460
Colonel Young, come in.

347
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:34,380
Colonel Young, do you read?

348
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:00,961
- Are you okay? I heard you...
- I'm fine.

349
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:02,508
Have you seen Chloe?

350
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:22,473
Come with me to the infirmary.

351
00:30:22,598 --> 00:30:24,405
There's a chance

352
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,177
that the tick that was on me
jumped to you.

353
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:30,286
Have you seen any weird things?

354
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,519
I'm fine...

355
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,626
She's seeing her dad.

356
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,963
We need to get you to the infirmary.

357
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,769
No, I need a little more time...

358
00:30:42,894 --> 00:30:45,023
We can't risk
letting that thing stay on you.

359
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:46,135
Don't leave me!

360
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,596
I'm not...

361
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:52,016
Chloe? Come on.
It'll be okay.

362
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:17,450
Can I help you with
something, Sergeant?

363
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:21,627
You can start
by wiping that smile off your face.

364
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,589
What smile?

365
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,435
I'd appreciate
you not telling lies about me

366
00:31:27,664 --> 00:31:29,080
to Colonel Young.

367
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,141
Lies.

368
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:36,810
Telling him I was in the Gateroom,
messing with the consoles.

369
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,498
I don't know what kind of game
you're playing, but...

370
00:31:45,025 --> 00:31:46,415
What are you doing?

371
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,762
There it is.

372
00:31:50,006 --> 00:31:52,282
I don't know
why you have to remove it.

373
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:54,747
It's not hurting me.

374
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:56,580
You don't know that.

375
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:59,627
It's making you hallucinate.
Who knows what else it's doing.

376
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,710
It's too dangerous
to leave in place.

377
00:32:02,044 --> 00:32:03,254
End of the discussion.

378
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,213
Let's remove it.

379
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:10,719
Tell your mother I love her.

380
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:12,292
I miss her.

381
00:32:14,435 --> 00:32:15,724
I love you, Daddy.

382
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,688
I love you, too, sweetheart.

383
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,459
You're living our dream.

384
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:23,732
Remember that.

385
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,010
<i>Colonel Young, come in</i>.

386
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:54,096
Go ahead, Sergeant.

387
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,317
Colonel Young, we have a problem.

388
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,809
The civilians are trying to take over
the ship again.

389
00:32:58,977 --> 00:32:59,977
What?

390
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,520
<i>I'm pursuing Rush.</i>

391
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,022
<i>He and Wray are trying</i>

392
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,771
to seize control of the ship.

393
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:08,611
I don't know who is working with them,
but we need to mobilize.

394
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:09,778
Now.

395
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,964
I need you to listen to me.
Do not do anything. I will talk to them.

396
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:14,591
<i>Permission to use deadly force.</i>

397
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:17,056
No, did you hear what I said?
I need you to stand down.

398
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:18,871
Do not do anything.

399
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,749
<i>Permission granted.</i>

400
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,292
<i>Use whatever force necessary
to stop them.</i>

401
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:24,514
Copy that.

402
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:28,820
<i>We don't know if these channels
have been compromised.</i>

403
00:33:28,945 --> 00:33:30,519
<i>Go to radio silence.</i>

404
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:41,427
Greer, acknowledge.
I said stand down.

405
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,394
You think
he might be hallucinating too?

406
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,774
How?
All the ticks have been accounted for.

407
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:48,901
Unless there was more than one tick

408
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,319
when you guys got back.

409
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:52,653
Go find Greer.

410
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:55,949
We need to examine everyone
on this ship.

411
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,770
Quarantine anyone who's clear.

412
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:51,301
I know you're in here, Rush.

413
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:57,018
Show yourself!

414
00:35:46,485 --> 00:35:48,655
What are you doing?
Open that door!

415
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:53,505
You're not taking over
the ship again.

416
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:57,445
- <I>Colonel Young, come in.</I>
- Go ahead, Scott.

417
00:35:57,985 --> 00:35:59,335
No sign of Greer.

418
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:01,985
Still not responding
to any radio calls.

419
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:03,284
I'll keep at it.

420
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:06,330
<i>Rush and Wray
are also unaccounted for.</i>

421
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,745
No one knows where they are. Rush isn't
responding to his radio, either.

422
00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:13,505
All right. I'll put
a few more details together.

423
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:16,735
Excuse me.

424
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:22,385
I got to go help look for Greer.
You going to be okay?

425
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,640
But if you feel any different,
see anything out of the usual...

426
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:27,976
No, believe me,

427
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,035
I'm as concerned about this
as you are.

428
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:32,940
Keep me posted.

429
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,980
More than one tick attached to you

430
00:36:38,105 --> 00:36:40,865
would explain why
some of the hallucinations were more...

431
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:43,875
intense than others.

432
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,870
The toxins, maybe they target
the limbic system.

433
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:50,165
It's the area of the brain
that's responsible for

434
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:51,925
emotion.

435
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:54,405
Fear, anger, remorse...

436
00:36:55,085 --> 00:36:56,885
Matt's guilt over his son.

437
00:36:58,365 --> 00:36:59,615
Claustrophobia.

438
00:37:00,045 --> 00:37:01,045
My dad.

439
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:05,597
Let me guess, issue with snakes?

440
00:37:08,345 --> 00:37:09,345
And you?

441
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:16,859
Listen to me...

442
00:37:17,665 --> 00:37:20,571
I can't stop the bleeding.
You have to open that door.

443
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:23,240
If I don't get medical attention...

444
00:37:25,365 --> 00:37:26,577
No, sir, I do not know

445
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,037
who else is involved in the mutiny.

446
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,105
She's refusing to cooperate.

447
00:37:31,555 --> 00:37:33,505
You're not talking to anyone.

448
00:37:34,445 --> 00:37:36,600
Your radio is off!
What is the matter with you?

449
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:39,225
Yes, I will continue
the interrogation,

450
00:37:39,615 --> 00:37:43,065
but at some point, sir,
we are just better off ending this

451
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:44,905
once and for all.

452
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:47,264
Sergeant, listen to me.

453
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:54,015
We are not taking over the ship!

454
00:37:54,474 --> 00:37:55,574
What do you got?

455
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,025
Can't get the door open.

456
00:37:58,585 --> 00:38:00,605
Must have been disabled
from the inside.

457
00:38:01,165 --> 00:38:02,715
I heard Wray's voice.

458
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:08,705
- It's lieutenant Scott!
- Scott, help!

459
00:38:08,945 --> 00:38:10,996
I'm wounded!
Sergeant Greer has got us hostage.

460
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,164
Shut...

461
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:14,705
Quiet, now.

462
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:18,440
Sergeant Greer,
it's lieutenant Scott!

463
00:38:18,565 --> 00:38:19,615
Stand down!

464
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,735
This is Scott, come in.

465
00:38:25,065 --> 00:38:26,637
We found him.
He has locked

466
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,805
<i>with Wray in one of the storage rooms.
I think he's holding her hostage.</i>

467
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:41,902
That's it.

468
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,275
I'm done with you.

469
00:38:53,905 --> 00:38:54,905
Please.

470
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,925
Sergeant...

471
00:38:58,065 --> 00:38:59,065
Don't.

472
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:05,825
Do it.

473
00:39:11,665 --> 00:39:12,665
I said

474
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:14,695
do it.

475
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,170
Colonel Young...

476
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,355
Colonel, we got 'em.

477
00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:02,215
Send TJ.

478
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,140
We have wounded in here.

479
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:13,935
How you doing?

480
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:17,330
I was able to stop the bleeding
and stitch the wound,

481
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,833
so we'll keep an eye out
for infection, but...

482
00:40:20,565 --> 00:40:21,960
She should be okay.

483
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:25,130
- The rest of the crew?
- I checked everyone.

484
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,965
It looks like we got 'em all, so...

485
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:29,634
Hopefully things will get back
to normal around here.

486
00:40:31,005 --> 00:40:32,355
Whatever that is.

487
00:41:47,475 --> 00:41:48,725
What do we got?

488
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:52,605
The atmosphere is good.

489
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,012
10 hours on the countdown.

490
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:01,575
Shall we send a team?

491
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,290
Our luck's got to change
at some point.

492
00:42:08,415 --> 00:42:10,026
Just remember the bug spray.

493
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,248
Scott, this is Young.

494
00:42:15,385 --> 00:42:17,985
Get a team ready.
You're going off-world.
