1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:01,758
<i>Destiny.</i>

2
00:00:02,151 --> 00:00:03,671
The design is clearly ancient,

3
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:06,192
launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

4
00:00:06,317 --> 00:00:07,538
Where the hell are we?

5
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:09,992
Several billion light years
from home.

6
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:12,686
We're on a ship,
but we have no idea where we are

7
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,051
in relation to Earth.

8
00:00:14,176 --> 00:00:16,944
This ship could be
the most important discovery

9
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:19,232
mankind has made
since the Stargate itself.

10
00:00:19,357 --> 00:00:21,409
These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

11
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:23,643
We've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

12
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:26,526
We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

13
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,862
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,532
In this case are five ancient
communication stones.

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,782
You physically take control
of an individual at the other end.

16
00:00:38,865 --> 00:00:40,706
- Where are you?
- <i>It's top secret.</i>

17
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,001
- Wait, did you get the letter from...
- <i>Yeah, the air force, I got it.</i>

18
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,147
- You sound like you're in airplane.
- It's the thing I always dreamed of.

19
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:48,339
Dad, no, wait!

20
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,633
The ship is old and damaged.

21
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:53,052
We were losing air,
and somebody had to...

22
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,330
He's dead, isn't he?

23
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:57,139
- I didn't choose my job over you.
- Wasn't just about the job.

24
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,846
- I want to get back here with you.
- You made your choice.

25
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:22,026
You are so beautiful.

26
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:25,555
Don't.

27
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:30,464
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:32,139
I never meant to hurt you.

29
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:49,984
Sorry, sir, they're waiting.

30
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:56,833
Sorry.

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
We're late.

32
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:17,464
- You're late.
- It's my fault.

33
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:31,552
- Thanks for joining us, Colonel.
- Sorry, I wasn't expecting a party.

34
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:33,736
We may have figured out a way
to get you home.

35
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:38,826
Surprise.

36
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:51,754
Projet SG (1.00)

37
00:02:53,745 --> 00:02:56,926
Now, the power flow issues
are obviously the biggest variable,

38
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,720
but our simulations are encouraging.

39
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:01,816
It's time to take it
to the next level.

40
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:05,022
Any questions?

41
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:07,142
Sounds dangerous.

42
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:10,597
The IOA fully supports
the implementation of this plan.

43
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:13,832
I've seen it for myself,
the situation on board is dire

44
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:15,211
and justifies the risk.

45
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:18,469
I'm not gonna pretend to understand
everything you guys are talking about,

46
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:21,951
but it sounds like there's a chance
that this plan could end badly.

47
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,787
You want to get those people home?
So do we.

48
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:27,668
I'm just saying maybe
they could do a little more calculating.

49
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:30,930
The fact is, we are at the stage
where a practical attempt is the way

50
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:34,067
- to get any more hard data.
- The goal is to save lives.

51
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:38,050
- We don't want to put the ship at risk.
- All we're asking is that you try.

52
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:42,596
It is something I would have to take up
with everyone on board.

53
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:45,349
My office.

54
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:56,521
If it makes you feel any better,

55
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:59,290
Colonel Carter
saved my ass dozens of times

56
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:02,449
using all kinds of wacky science
I didn't understand.

57
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:05,953
I can't force people
to do something they don't want to do.

58
00:04:06,249 --> 00:04:08,470
You're in command of that ship.

59
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:10,550
It's not a democracy.

60
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:14,581
- I'm sorry, it's not that simple.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

61
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:17,557
A United States Senator is dead.

62
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:20,782
His daughter
and dozens of other people are trapped

63
00:04:20,907 --> 00:04:23,096
a billion light years
away from home.

64
00:04:23,616 --> 00:04:25,387
The President wants it done.

65
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,851
Sir, with all due respect...

66
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,450
You are being given a direct order,
Colonel.

67
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:34,335
Regardless of the consequences
to my standing,

68
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,983
I'm going to take the situation
under advisement.

69
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:40,297
I will let you know
my decision tomorrow.

70
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:47,602
Are you sure
you don't want anything?

71
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:49,139
I'm fine.

72
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:52,932
Thank you.

73
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,202
Must be nice to get out, imagine.

74
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:56,670
It is.

75
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:59,281
Everyone's very impressed
with how you're holding up,

76
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:01,904
- under the circumstances.
- I'm doing my best.

77
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,053
You're our eyes and ears now.

78
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:07,430
Your life,
certainly the lives of everyone aboard,

79
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,767
is priority,
but you have to understand,

80
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,524
there's a lot at stake here.

81
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:16,823
You passed me up
for promotion four times.

82
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,735
I never really got a straight answer
as to why.

83
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:21,241
You are...

84
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:24,237
a highly trusted, well-respected member
of this organization.

85
00:05:24,362 --> 00:05:27,455
You would not have been on Icarus
in the first place if you weren't.

86
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,420
The point is,
I know there's no way in hell

87
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:33,089
you'd be talking to me right now
if you had a choice.

88
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:35,109
So, please,

89
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:37,169
can we just cut to the chase?

90
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:40,464
Make this happen.

91
00:05:42,004 --> 00:05:44,105
I'm not a scientist.
How can I do that?

92
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,762
You have influence.
The people on board need to believe

93
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,456
- it'll get them home.
- Even if, it can get us all killed.

94
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:53,352
- Not what I've been told.
- Why are you pushing so hard?

95
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:55,431
If it works,

96
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,003
we think
we might be able to use the data

97
00:05:58,128 --> 00:06:01,694
to re-engineer the process
in one of our ships here in this galaxy.

98
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:05,147
Dial a gate to Destiny
without an Icarus-type planet.

99
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:09,451
And get the team that was supposed
to go in the first place back on board.

100
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:11,916
Now that we know
where the ninth chevron leads,

101
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,790
- the mission has taken more importance.
- Why isn't Rush here?

102
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,628
We're not convinced
Rush wants to come home.

103
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:24,858
And do I have to remind you
how much you have to gain,

104
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:26,877
personally, in all of this?

105
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:30,159
Assuming I live.

106
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:40,140
The ship doesn't have enough power
to dial back to Earth,

107
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:43,044
and as we've seen recently,
when the ship runs out of juice,

108
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,357
it finds a star
and refills its tanks.

109
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,236
Now, theoretically, at that time,

110
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:50,699
the full power of the star
should be available to us.

111
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:52,673
Star power.
Ultimate wattage, baby.

112
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:55,166
It's brilliant.

113
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,959
If we can somehow use the ship
as a conduit

114
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,171
and channel the star's energy
into the gate as we dial.

115
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,394
That would do it.

116
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,717
Problem is
the "ship as a conduit" part.

117
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,800
Does anyone know when the ship
will run out of power again?

118
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:11,263
Tough to tell.

119
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,976
Based on current usage,
probably going to be several months.

120
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,483
Not if we can drain
the power faster.

121
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:20,626
Right, that's part of the plan
that sounded a little vague.

122
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:22,978
- It's possible.
- So you are all for this?

123
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,456
Let's see what Rush says.

124
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:28,792
Given how little we know
about this ship...

125
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:32,265
Can't we at least try it
and aboard if something goes wrong?

126
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:35,934
Well, unfortunately,
the "something goes wrong" part

127
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:38,040
would most likely mean
the ship exploding.

128
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,429
Not according to the people
who came up with the idea.

129
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:42,687
If only all science
was that definitive, Colonel.

130
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,880
You'll have to choose
who you want to believe.

131
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,260
Nothing to worry about.

132
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:52,032
It doesn't hurt at all.

133
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:53,901
Do I look worried?

134
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:55,501
A little.

135
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,435
Trying to figure out
what I'm gonna say to my mom.

136
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:00,646
For my family
I'm on sabbatical in Africa.

137
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:02,991
When it's time to come back,
what do I do?

138
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,399
Click my heels 3 times?

139
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,746
No way for you to disconnect
the transmission yourself.

140
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:08,748
The base needs to be
manually shut down.

141
00:08:08,873 --> 00:08:11,949
There's a device on the other side,
turning off will sever the connection.

142
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,701
- Cool.
- Easiest way to swap consciousness

143
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,961
with someone across the universe
I've ever seen.

144
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:18,643
What's with the kino?

145
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:20,916
First time using the stones.

146
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,459
Very exciting.

147
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:36,058
Any chance I could get
something else to wear?

148
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:42,215
Check me out.

149
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,064
This is weird.

150
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:47,504
The people we're in can't hear us?

151
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:52,280
Wonder what they're doing
with our bodies.

152
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:03,959
- Colonel Telford.
- I'll just get right to it.

153
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,838
I've been ordered to enact
the rescue plan put forward by the IOA.

154
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,957
- Rescue plan?
- I don't understand.

155
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,159
I've brought doctors McCormack
and Williams with me.

156
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:14,344
I believe you know them.
I've set them to work.

157
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:16,090
What about Colonel Young?

158
00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:20,119
Effective immediately,
I'm assuming command of the <i>Destiny</i>.

159
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,481
- You replaced me.
- For now.

160
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,151
- Without waiting my answer?
- You were going to say...

161
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,529
- Give us more time.
- You were gonna be disobeying a order.

162
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,491
I offered you
command of the expedition.

163
00:09:36,862 --> 00:09:38,452
You were my first choice,

164
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,036
but you turned it down.

165
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:44,625
Your exact words, as I recall, were,
"I don't think it's still in me, sir."

166
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,498
I'm there now, whether I like it or not,
whether anyone likes it.

167
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:50,172
This is wrong, and you know it.

168
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:53,967
I've spent my career looking up to you,
because you always did the right thing

169
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,383
even if it meant
disregarding the chain of command...

170
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,532
Don't think I like this.

171
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:03,377
- They can't do this to us, can they?
- For now, they have.

172
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,195
I think it comes down to the fact
that they don't trust Rush.

173
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,023
The truth is, I can't blame them.

174
00:10:08,432 --> 00:10:10,977
- What are we supposed to do?
- They've given you permission

175
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:13,824
to see your families
as long as you guys follow the rules.

176
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:17,982
I hate to go there,
but what happens if they screw up

177
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:20,035
and the ship explodes?

178
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,787
Most likely, we will die here too.

179
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:29,050
Apparently, they're just doing
some preliminary testing,

180
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:31,912
information-gathering,
nothing too crazy.

181
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:34,433
What you're saying is,

182
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,507
live it up while we can.

183
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:52,985
Colonel Telford, I presume.

184
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:09,598
He can use the facilities.

185
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,461
That's it.

186
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,412
And what if the power flow
can't be controlled?

187
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:19,216
If there are
any dangerous fluctuations,

188
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:22,264
we just shut it down and allow the ship
to continue powering up.

189
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,183
Early tests show it should work.

190
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,283
We are not gonna put you
in any more danger

191
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:28,937
than you're already here.

192
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:31,652
From what I gather,
supplies are desperately short.

193
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:35,360
Given the condition of the ship,
it could experience a fatal breakdown.

194
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:38,363
No one is trying
to alarm you unduly,

195
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,745
but we can't continue to scrape by,
barely surviving.

196
00:11:42,214 --> 00:11:44,981
Obviously, we can't say for sure
that this is going to get you home,

197
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:49,355
but the best minds
that we have are working on this,

198
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,831
and I'm sure you'll agree.

199
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,065
It's well worth pursuing.

200
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:11,920
It is spectacular, isn't it?

201
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:18,620
If the plan has any chance
at succeeding...

202
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:19,915
Which it doesn't.

203
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:23,184
Control over
most of the ship's operational systems

204
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,118
is limited, at best.

205
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,833
Navigation, propulsion, and many others
have been locked out entirely

206
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,584
by a master code
which we have had no luck in breaking.

207
00:12:33,157 --> 00:12:35,695
You might wanna know we've come up
with a way of draining the power.

208
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,963
Yes, so I heard.

209
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,692
Many of the power conduits
have been badly damaged,

210
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:42,886
and firing the ship's weapon system

211
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,846
without either repairing them

212
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,433
or isolating the damaged areas
would be prohibitively dangerous.

213
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,394
That's what we're working on
right now.

214
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,659
Just wanted to keep you informed.

215
00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:58,276
She's not gonna understand.

216
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,174
She can barely follow
an episode of Star Trek.

217
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:03,698
You don't have to tell her.

218
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,750
Can I help you?

219
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:16,454
My name is...

220
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:19,798
Phillip.

221
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:24,553
- I work with your son.
- You know Eli?

222
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:27,596
We've recently become very close.

223
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,172
It doesn't feel real.

224
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:45,808
It's like a...

225
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:47,978
bad dream.

226
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,273
You're here.

227
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,659
If this is the only way,

228
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:01,268
I can live with that.

229
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:04,317
I can't stay this way forever, mom.

230
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:06,678
I know.

231
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:10,374
Everyone's working very hard
to get you home.

232
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,572
I'm trying to get through this.

233
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:15,593
I am.

234
00:14:17,185 --> 00:14:18,927
Your father always used to say...

235
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:20,619
One step at a time.

236
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,369
I miss him so much.

237
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:29,476
Me too.

238
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:35,124
Awesome, thanks.

239
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,084
Eli drinks
four or five of those a day.

240
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:39,776
Actually, he quit.

241
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,233
Really?
I find that hard to believe.

242
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:44,549
He's on a bit of a crash diet.

243
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:47,802
You may not recognize him
next time you see him.

244
00:14:48,265 --> 00:14:50,521
- When will that be, do you know?
- I'm sorry,

245
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,072
I'm not sure.

246
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:55,001
Really getting into shape, though.

247
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,329
Can I get you something to eat?

248
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:02,484
Eli said you make the most amazing
chocolate chip cookies.

249
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:05,271
- He told you that?
- Yeah.

250
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:08,875
It's crazy how close you get
in such a short time.

251
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:12,427
Sometimes it's like
he's just right up there in my brain.

252
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:16,665
Why don't I make some?
You can take them back with you.

253
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:22,212
He also said
you make a mean schnitzel,

254
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:25,423
- but I don't want to put you out.
- No, I'm happy to do it.

255
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:29,135
You know,
I thought he'd be calling more often.

256
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,635
Here, let me help you.

257
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:34,111
Tell me...

258
00:15:35,315 --> 00:15:36,317
This...

259
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:38,229
work you're doing.

260
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:42,566
I know you can't tell me much
about it.

261
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,943
I can tell you that it's important.

262
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:46,259
In fact,

263
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,697
it could change
the world as we know it.

264
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,649
Really? My Eli?

265
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:55,036
Not that I'm surprised,
don't get me wrong.

266
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:57,643
He's my son.
Of course I think he's special,

267
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:01,542
but he was always so bright,
so different, but he just...

268
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:04,934
He never seemed to apply himself.

269
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:07,632
Some of it was my fault.

270
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,053
No...

271
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,221
He doesn't blame you at all,
for anything.

272
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:18,435
I'm sorry if this is personal,
but he told me you're not well.

273
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:21,941
Did he?

274
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,497
Lucky guess.

275
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,762
Eggs are in the fridge, right?

276
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:42,937
I didn't think he ever talked to anyone
about it.

277
00:16:43,981 --> 00:16:45,846
He asked me
the Air Force was making good

278
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,547
on their promise to help you.

279
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:51,009
To be honest, the whole thing
makes me a little anxious.

280
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:53,887
I really just want to know
Eli's okay.

281
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:56,951
He is.

282
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:02,201
You make sure you tell him
I'm proud of him.

283
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:08,765
I will.

284
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:15,189
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,276
It's just,
it all happened so suddenly,

286
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:21,184
and I...

287
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,557
I miss him.

288
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:28,217
He misses you too.

289
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:39,485
That's it for me.

290
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:42,060
I'm almost done over here.

291
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,147
You're stalling.

292
00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:47,516
I'm doing things
the way they need to be done.

293
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:51,069
Now, we've isolated power to 40 %
of the operational weapons system,

294
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,207
and it should be enough to get us a read
on our power reduction capability.

295
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,538
- The next time we drop out of FTL...
- Look, this ship...

296
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,079
is old and damaged.

297
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:05,035
The computers aren't registering
half the things they're supposed to.

298
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,564
I want manual confirmation

299
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:09,066
before activating any system
that comprehensive.

300
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:11,610
Over 80% of this ship
is inaccessible

301
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:13,416
without spacesuits right now.

302
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,940
With only two suits,
doing it your way could take months.

303
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:17,512
If that's what it takes.

304
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,861
- Dr. Rush, we're ready here.
- <i>Okay, sending power through.</i>

305
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:34,886
Looks like a coolant leak.

306
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:36,906
- I thought you got it.
- So did I.

307
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,701
There's a problem.
Power's backing up in the relay.

308
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,745
- Shut it down.
- I'm trying. It's not working.

309
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,377
The problem is contained.
It's restricted to that corridor.

310
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:47,352
- That's not the point.
- How big an explosion are we talking?

311
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:49,904
I'm going in. I can seal it.

312
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:52,922
- Are you crazy? You can't go in there!
- We're on the hull!

313
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:02,891
We are in FTL!

314
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,585
If it punctures the hull,

315
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,169
disrupts the shield at all,
even for a microsecond,

316
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:09,314
then the entire ship
could be in jeopardy.

317
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:32,398
It's...

318
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,650
It's gonna be touch and go.

319
00:19:51,547 --> 00:19:54,320
We're proceeding with the test
next time we drop out of FTL.

320
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,136
Colonel, the man nearly died.

321
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:00,164
You're put him in jeopardy.

322
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:02,283
I was trying to make sure
you didn't kill us all.

323
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,700
I'm not going to.

324
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,027
I accept responsibility
for what happened,

325
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:08,540
but you forced the situation,

326
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:11,459
and activating the weapons system
the way you're proposing

327
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:13,499
is completely reckless.

328
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:15,710
Come on, these people are in danger
just being here,

329
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:17,744
evidenced by what just happened.

330
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,619
This ship is falling apart.

331
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:21,803
They're the wrong people.
We need to get them home.

332
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,216
- There's a right way of doing that.
- We are doing it the right way.

333
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:27,989
That's a matter of opinion.

334
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:31,518
Look, I know that we've had
our differences in the past.

335
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:34,263
You wanted me off the team.
I remember.

336
00:20:34,388 --> 00:20:37,485
It was my duty to express concern
for how everyone else felt about you.

337
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,071
So are you suggesting

338
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:41,739
that my judgment is now
somehow clouded,

339
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:44,690
or is it that I'm just plain lying?

340
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:47,238
Admit it, Rush,

341
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:49,770
after everything that's happened,

342
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:52,919
you're afraid
they're not gonna let you come back.

343
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:09,482
Hello?

344
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:10,814
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

345
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:12,553
How's it going?

346
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:14,273
<i>Okay.</i>

347
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:17,090
- How'd your mom take it?
- Couldn't do it.

348
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:18,735
I told her I was a co-worker.

349
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,404
I told my friends
I'm cousin Liz from out west.

350
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:24,889
I may have oversold the job.

351
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:27,928
I said I was gonna change everything
for mankind as we know it.

352
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,662
What the hell?

353
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:33,011
<i>Might as well make her feel like
I left for a good reason.</i>

354
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:34,751
You did.

355
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:36,678
Right. I guess so.

356
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,757
So, some of my old friends

357
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,996
<i>are taking "cousin Liz" out on the town
to see Janelle Monae.</i>

358
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:46,969
- You want to come hang out with us?
- Yes.

359
00:22:06,738 --> 00:22:07,742
Emily, it's me.

360
00:22:09,513 --> 00:22:10,620
No. Emily!

361
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,873
- Emily, please just open the door.
- Go away!

362
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,101
I'm not leaving.

363
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:17,439
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- I will call the police.

364
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:19,545
Please, it doesn't end like this!

365
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,714
Open the door!
I just want to talk to you!

366
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:32,767
I need you to just listen to me, okay?
Because I know this is crazy.

367
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:36,082
I'm barely keeping it together,
and the only thing

368
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:38,723
that's keeping me
from going out of my mind is you.

369
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:42,419
That's making me crazy too,
because I know how much I hurt you,

370
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:44,377
and I know
that you hate me for leaving.

371
00:22:45,193 --> 00:22:47,544
Emily, I really tried.
I didn't want to come here.

372
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:50,451
I tried not to come here,
but I can't stand it!

373
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:52,325
Baby, I'm so sorry.

374
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,455
I'm so sorry,
and I love you so much.

375
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:56,186
I had to try, right?

376
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:59,452
Just in case there was a chance.
A chance that you could forgive me...

377
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,089
Maybe you're just afraid

378
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,843
thinking that I would die out there,
so it's easier to push me away now than

379
00:23:09,413 --> 00:23:12,341
have to face me like this.
I just want to come home...

380
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:15,186
To you, and that's all I want.

381
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:09,947
- Me?
- What's your name?

382
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:11,991
Phil.

383
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,631
Can I buy you a drink?

384
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,966
I have one.

385
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:16,848
Yes, you do.

386
00:24:19,244 --> 00:24:20,360
Want to dance?

387
00:24:21,766 --> 00:24:22,769
Sure.

388
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:28,800
My god, this is awesome!

389
00:25:04,507 --> 00:25:06,572
We're going to go dance.
You guys want to come?

390
00:25:07,564 --> 00:25:08,566
No.

391
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,930
So, how long have
Celina and Josh been together?

392
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:17,300
I don't know.

393
00:25:19,904 --> 00:25:21,690
Too bad about Chloe's dad.

394
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:24,564
What's she gonna do?

395
00:25:25,406 --> 00:25:28,109
- What do you mean?
- Her job. She was working for him?

396
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:32,626
I don't really think
that's on her mind right now.

397
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,037
Sure.

398
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,047
- Tell her we're sorry.
- I will.

399
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,582
You know, it sucks for me,

400
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,459
the Senator was hooking me up
with his wall street connections,

401
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,914
and now that's not gonna happen.

402
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,563
I think I have to go throw up.

403
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:15,573
So is Chloe really okay?

404
00:26:16,264 --> 00:26:17,423
She'll be fine.

405
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,619
I wish she'd call me back.

406
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:22,348
I'm sure she misses you.

407
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,205
I think she's just having
a hard time dealing right now.

408
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:30,097
I really need to
talk to her, you know?

409
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:33,507
About the fact that you're sleeping
with her boyfriend?

410
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:36,552
- What?
- It's pretty obvious you are together.

411
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:38,617
Josh and Chloe broke up.

412
00:26:38,742 --> 00:26:41,766
I don't think she would have suspected
that you're the real reason why.

413
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,923
- I don't know who you...
- How could you do this to me?

414
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,094
- To you?
- You're supposed to be her best friend!

415
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,171
Get your hands off of me.

416
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:09,670
Excuse me, Colonel?

417
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,049
Can I have a word?

418
00:27:11,674 --> 00:27:12,692
One moment.

419
00:27:13,523 --> 00:27:14,886
About Sergeant Greer...

420
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,068
Scott, it's Young.

421
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:30,501
- What just happened?
- We just dropped out of FTL, sir.

422
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:31,804
What's going on?

423
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:34,273
It must have disrupted communication
between the stones.

424
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:36,288
Listen to me,
we don't have a lot of time.

425
00:27:36,552 --> 00:27:38,225
- You've got to...
- Colonel Young?

426
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,783
Baby...

427
00:27:53,181 --> 00:27:55,967
- What just happened?
- We just dropped out of FTL.

428
00:27:57,146 --> 00:28:00,358
Looks like it might have temporarily
disrupted the communication device.

429
00:28:01,318 --> 00:28:02,571
We have to fix that.

430
00:28:03,385 --> 00:28:05,907
Sir, I think Colonel Young wanted me
to shut down the stones.

431
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:08,241
This is no longer his command,
is that clear?

432
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:11,540
The device stays on.

433
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:18,976
A glitch?
That's one hell of a glitch, General.

434
00:28:19,555 --> 00:28:20,948
That's what I'm being told.

435
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:25,195
- They're working on it.
- Yes, sir. Just let me know.

436
00:28:27,894 --> 00:28:29,633
They said it was
some sort of glitch.

437
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,083
Apparently.

438
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:33,392
- It won't happen again.
- How do they know?

439
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:34,964
I don't know.

440
00:28:35,387 --> 00:28:37,332
Right now, I don't care.

441
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:40,384
Did you see that girl
I was dancing with?

442
00:28:40,906 --> 00:28:42,845
She wrote her email address
on my hand!

443
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:44,221
I hate this.

444
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,514
I hate everybody.

445
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:48,722
Captain Buzzkill.

446
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:51,855
No more drinks for cousin Liz.

447
00:28:53,757 --> 00:28:55,527
You see those two over there?

448
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,421
That's my best friend, Celina,
and my ex-boyfriend.

449
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:02,354
You can do better.

450
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:06,287
Do you want to dance?

451
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,498
I think I want to go over there
and punch him in the face.

452
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:12,769
I have an idea.

453
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:14,938
How about we get out of here?

454
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:18,369
Easy...

455
00:29:18,726 --> 00:29:19,854
This is awful.

456
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:22,455
I'm not even drunk at all.

457
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:23,869
Really?

458
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:25,431
Because you seem drunk.

459
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,765
My head's just all foggy.

460
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,439
Almost there...

461
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:32,025
Usually it makes me feel better.

462
00:29:32,698 --> 00:29:34,422
At least for a little while.

463
00:29:35,095 --> 00:29:36,818
It usually makes me dizzy...

464
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,663
And then I fall asleep.

465
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,161
Just once...

466
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:54,433
I'd like to go out with a girl

467
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,777
and not have it end with her crying.

468
00:29:56,902 --> 00:29:59,088
My life was so shallow

469
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:00,576
and pointless,

470
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,722
and then I started
working with my dad.

471
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:08,503
I really thought
that I could do something,

472
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:10,683
make a difference.

473
00:30:11,247 --> 00:30:12,250
You can.

474
00:30:14,204 --> 00:30:16,480
These aren't even my tears!

475
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,107
I'm sorry.

476
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,551
If it makes you feel better,

477
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,070
I had a really great time tonight.

478
00:30:24,786 --> 00:30:25,914
I'm glad.

479
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:31,345
Do you know the last time
a girl that hot

480
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:33,497
told me I was cute?

481
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:36,000
Never.

482
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,420
Doesn't it bother you
she wasn't really talking about you?

483
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:43,766
When you put it like that...

484
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:47,052
I didn't mean that.

485
00:30:47,352 --> 00:30:48,465
Come on...

486
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:50,345
You're cute.

487
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:52,021
The real you.

488
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,068
What?

489
00:31:04,397 --> 00:31:07,248
Nothing. Go on. You were saying...

490
00:31:07,777 --> 00:31:09,829
And you're funny, too,

491
00:31:10,624 --> 00:31:12,143
and you're a genius.

492
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:13,648
And...

493
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:16,248
- Don't say it.
- You're a good friend.

494
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:20,384
Yes...

495
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,467
That's me.

496
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:25,082
I am a good friend.

497
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:28,223
I don't want to be
trapped on that ship,

498
00:31:29,006 --> 00:31:31,472
and I don't want to be
stuck here like this.

499
00:31:32,143 --> 00:31:33,891
I can't feel anything. Can you?

500
00:31:35,264 --> 00:31:38,900
You know what's the worst part
about having a father like mine?

501
00:31:39,025 --> 00:31:41,899
- How did we get onto that?
- You can't live up to it.

502
00:31:42,993 --> 00:31:44,685
He was so great.

503
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:48,155
I'll never be like he was.

504
00:31:50,496 --> 00:31:54,146
My dad definitely would have
punched Josh in the face!

505
00:31:56,527 --> 00:31:58,078
I think I'm gonna take you home.

506
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:00,280
Could you take me home?

507
00:32:15,384 --> 00:32:17,311
A lot of people are behind this.

508
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:21,563
A lot of people play the lottery.

509
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:24,904
What's surprising is
they'd do it with their lives.

510
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:26,907
I know you're opposed.

511
00:32:27,503 --> 00:32:29,461
I have serious concerns myself.

512
00:32:31,378 --> 00:32:33,885
I'm just wondering
how much safer it might be

513
00:32:34,835 --> 00:32:36,704
if you were involved.

514
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:53,887
They can't keep me locked up
in here forever.

515
00:32:54,423 --> 00:32:55,677
You know he will,

516
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:57,369
as long as he can.

517
00:32:58,153 --> 00:32:59,312
What you did...

518
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,939
He had it coming to him.

519
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:05,100
Look, just shut down
the damn stones, man.

520
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:06,674
I'm not you, Ron.

521
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,588
- He's our commanding officer.
- Colonel Young...

522
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:11,625
is our commanding officer.

523
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,184
Telford's got guards posted 24-7.

524
00:33:16,267 --> 00:33:17,708
What am I supposed to do?

525
00:33:18,554 --> 00:33:19,807
This better work.

526
00:33:32,404 --> 00:33:33,548
What are you doing?

527
00:33:34,405 --> 00:33:36,320
I'm making sure
we still have enough power

528
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:38,682
to control these consoles
when approaching the star.

529
00:33:40,005 --> 00:33:43,187
Williams says you've come up with a way
of improving the odds of success.

530
00:33:44,432 --> 00:33:46,106
I don't want to die, Colonel.

531
00:33:46,606 --> 00:33:47,608
Good.

532
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:50,459
Hopefully,
we've proven that's not our goal.

533
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:08,837
I'm sorry.

534
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,839
I couldn't deal with it,

535
00:34:11,488 --> 00:34:14,093
the thought of you
being trapped on that ship,

536
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:15,511
with her.

537
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,804
What do I have to do?

538
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,036
And I shouldn't have
brought it up again.

539
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,214
I know it's over,

540
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:23,268
but you got to understand...

541
00:34:30,941 --> 00:34:31,652
No...

542
00:34:33,764 --> 00:34:35,781
- What's happening?
- We just jumped to FTL.

543
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:45,938
Yes...

544
00:34:47,113 --> 00:34:48,225
Everything okay?

545
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:51,766
It will be soon enough.

546
00:35:02,044 --> 00:35:03,055
All right,

547
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,312
this is ridiculous.

548
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:06,937
Jumping back and forth
without any warning is completely

549
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,105
unacceptable!

550
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:10,524
Seriously.

551
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:39,763
Routing power flow to the Stargate.

552
00:35:40,862 --> 00:35:42,190
Ready to attempt dial-in.

553
00:35:43,682 --> 00:35:44,684
Do it.

554
00:36:39,251 --> 00:36:40,948
Stand back! Everyone back up!

555
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,572
You're gonna overload
the capacitors.

556
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:47,890
Bringing power flow down.

557
00:36:51,863 --> 00:36:53,457
The limitations are not holding.

558
00:36:53,582 --> 00:36:56,041
Because the system wasn't meant
to handle this much power.

559
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:08,600
Stay calm!

560
00:37:08,982 --> 00:37:10,269
The shield is failing.

561
00:37:10,763 --> 00:37:11,885
We need to abort.

562
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,260
Shut it down!

563
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,908
It's not working.

564
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:30,455
- I thought you said you could stop it!
- I know! It won't shut down.

565
00:37:45,744 --> 00:37:47,038
Where are you going?

566
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:54,402
Do something.

567
00:38:05,923 --> 00:38:07,004
They're gone.

568
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,425
Thank you.

569
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:28,429
If I can have everyone's attention,
please...

570
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,326
I'm sorry
to have to tell you that...

571
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:33,535
We will not...

572
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,023
be going home,

573
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:37,904
not yet, anyway,

574
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:40,117
but you can all relax

575
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:41,860
and return to your quarters.

576
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,940
The ship will not be exploding,

577
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,156
at least not today.

578
00:38:47,017 --> 00:38:50,260
Normal power levels
will be restored soon, right?

579
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,732
Yes.

580
00:38:52,981 --> 00:38:53,997
Thank you.

581
00:39:02,102 --> 00:39:04,132
You staged the whole thing.

582
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:06,927
So all of this
was just to get rid of Telford?

583
00:39:07,876 --> 00:39:09,035
Had to be done.

584
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,099
So you're saying that the ship
was never going to explode?

585
00:39:12,635 --> 00:39:16,478
No, we would most definitely all be dead
had I not put certain limits in place.

586
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,774
I also arranged for the alarms
and warnings to go off regardless.

587
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,335
Bit of theater,

588
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:24,167
always nice.

589
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:29,125
- Their plan was never gonna work.
- You could have warned us.

590
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,451
You scared the crap
out of everybody.

591
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,707
I didn't know who was on my side,
did I?

592
00:39:45,246 --> 00:39:48,041
Colonel Telford removed
not only any sense of command,

593
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,648
but the two scientists that designed
and implemented

594
00:39:50,773 --> 00:39:52,497
the program
that was causing the crisis.

595
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:54,748
The situation appeared
to be irreversible.

596
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:58,395
Fortunately, Dr. Rush was able to avoid
catastrophic disaster.

597
00:39:58,563 --> 00:39:59,594
How he did that,

598
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:02,065
along with the data
collected during the experiment.

599
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,537
Those were people's lives
you were experimenting with.

600
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,363
- We were trying to get them home.
- You cut and ran.

601
00:40:08,746 --> 00:40:12,015
There was no point in three more lives
being lost if it could be avoided.

602
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,620
Colonel Telford
was following orders.

603
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,553
Sir...

604
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:19,958
After much consideration,

605
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,416
we have decided to stay
in communication with Earth.

606
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:24,508
I hope personal visits
for everyone on board

607
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:27,406
- will still be permitted.
- That depends, Colonel.

608
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:30,469
- Consider it done.
- Thank you, sir.

609
00:40:30,923 --> 00:40:33,868
I'm afraid the time that
I've allotted for this briefing

610
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:35,348
is now up.

611
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:39,266
General...

612
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,022
We are going to have to be tough.

613
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,860
Disciplined.

614
00:40:51,938 --> 00:40:54,758
The road may be longer
than many of us hoped.

615
00:40:55,888 --> 00:40:57,925
We will have to sacrifice,

616
00:40:58,442 --> 00:40:59,445
compromise,

617
00:41:00,463 --> 00:41:01,958
work together

618
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,119
<i>without exceptions.</i>

619
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,393
I thought you did a good job.

620
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:16,553
People need to know the truth,

621
00:41:17,462 --> 00:41:18,855
but they also need hope.

622
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:21,353
I need you to do something for me.

623
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:24,981
- Sure thing.
- Go over the data

624
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,317
- collected as they tried to dial.
- I have already.

625
00:41:28,357 --> 00:41:30,619
- There's a lot I don't understand...
- You need to learn,

626
00:41:30,744 --> 00:41:33,093
as fast as you can,
and you talk to whoever you have to.

627
00:41:34,183 --> 00:41:35,826
You think Rush is hiding something?

628
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:38,178
That's what I want you to tell me.

629
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:53,540
<i>We are going to survive.
We are...</i>

630
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:55,376
<i>going to make it home.</i>

631
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,001
<i>Make no mistake,</i>

632
00:41:57,577 --> 00:41:59,817
my first priority is to make sure

633
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,603
that we all return

634
00:42:02,527 --> 00:42:03,592
to those we love.
