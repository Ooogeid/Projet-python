00:00:01,026 --> 00:00:02,487
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield<i>...</i>

2
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:04,346
- You gonna hide.
- Puttin' him on the run?

3
00:00:04,468 --> 00:00:06,757
- I can't run.
- Right now it's about keeping ya alive.

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:08,798
You've got history
with these grenade tossers.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,912
The guy with the grenades
is named Guardo.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,580
We hit him hard and his weapons stash,
but he got away.

7
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:14,968
He screwed my ex-wife.

8
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:16,152
Sole purpose...

9
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:19,762
making this investigation
seem like a personal vendetta.

10
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:22,633
He may have assassinated
a gang leader.

11
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,041
This was not
part of the deal.

12
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:26,325
Sure it was.
The part Antwon didn't tell you about.

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,817
This was a calculated move
by Lieutenant Kavanaugh

14
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,960
to put Curtis' life
in jeopardy

15
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:33,252
to compel him to testify
against his team.

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,872
My client is willing
to plead to new charges,

17
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,124
as long as we can reasonably
guarantee his safety.

18
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:40,066
What does he have to say
about his friends?

19
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:42,104
Nothing.
There is one other option, though.

20
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:44,049
I can't turn on my family.

21
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:47,574
We're gonna lose
a vast chance at nailing Vic.

22
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,379
You got to make him believe
that Lemansky gave it up

23
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:51,671
for witness protection.

24
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:52,864
Lemansky's talking.

25
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:54,795
Now all this bullshit
can blow back on me.

26
00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:57,049
If he had a change of heart,
he would've tipped us.

27
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,031
He wouldn't if his deal
meant us going down.

28
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:01,204
We go to the spot and
we'll take his temperature.

29
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:03,187
If he doesn't show,
assume he made the deal.

30
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,967
We got to wait
until you get to Mexico.

31
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:06,858
We got money parked in
an account for you.

32
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,031
- It's all set up.
- I'm not going that route.

33
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:11,958
Why did you even come back here
if you weren't planning on leaving?

34
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:13,117
I came to see you guys.

35
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:14,408
I brought you some food.

36
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:18,356
Shane.

37
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:25,344
Are you happy, Detective Mackey?

38
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:30,075
Break 'em up.

39
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,595
We gonna find out who did this.

40
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:35,035
And we gonna kill him.

I ran down the grocery guy's contacts.

66
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:54,290
No one's seen Guardo.
He's a god damn ghost.

67
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:56,704
Anything south of the border?

68
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:59,400
Our federale is neck-deep
in some prison beef.

69
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:00,532
Couldn't help.

70
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:07,208
How did Guardo get Lem
to show up at that place?

71
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:09,302
Alone.

72
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,868
And the way he died.

73
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:17,863
Shit.

74
00:03:24,315 --> 00:03:25,403
We find Guardo...

75
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,452
He dies the same way.

76
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,851
Only slower.

77
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:35,008
Yeah. He will.

78
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:40,165
If only he'd reach out
to us instead of Becca.

79
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:42,528
- He should've trusted us man.
- He was scared.

80
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,652
If I didn't let the whole thing
with Antwon go

81
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,729
- shit-side up...
- Hey, it's nobody's fault.

82
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:01,216
You were a great cop.

83
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:03,416
You were a great friend.

84
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:05,098
Here's the 21 you deserve, man.

Partner go home?

89
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:44,610
Billings takes 9 to 5
very seriously.

90
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:46,104
Another homicide
volunteer?

91
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,817
It's the third el salvadoran
to confess to Lemansky's murder.

92
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:50,584
First two didn't get one detail right.

93
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,913
This guy wasn't even in the country
when it happened.

94
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:54,824
Guy turns himself in,

95
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,763
takes the prison juice for the killing,

96
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:58,049
keeps the heat off the gang.

97
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,093
Heat? What heat?
I haven't heard a peep

98
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:01,247
out of downtown.

99
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:03,109
No police funeral.
No press conference.

100
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,873
It's like Lemansky
never wore a badge.

101
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,571
He's ready
to be processed.

102
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,483
- Vic check in yet?
- No. I'll get this.

103
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:21,478
Hey, is Vic around?
I can't get him on the phone.

104
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,328
No. He's still taking
some personal time.

105
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,297
He's not supposed
to be back until tomorrow.

106
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:27,430
Is everything OK?

107
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:28,962
I haven't heard from him in days.

108
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:32,234
I leave messages.
He doesn't get back to me.

109
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:33,443
The kids are freaking out.

110
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:36,279
Well, I'm sure he's
just sorting things out.

111
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,125
Yeah.

112
00:05:38,263 --> 00:05:39,681
I'll get a message to him.

113
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:40,967
Have him call me.

114
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:43,142
Thanks.

115
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:50,519
A.C., sorry to startle you.

116
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,250
Can I get a minute of your time?

117
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:54,739
What now, Lieutenant?

118
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:57,712
I just wanna apologize
for my behavior last week

119
00:05:57,871 --> 00:05:58,925
in Captain Wyms' office.

120
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,914
It was out of line.
I let it get too personal.

121
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:03,059
Yeah, you did.

122
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,920
I've been doing a lot of soul searching

123
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:07,733
in the light of Lemansky's death,

124
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:09,768
trying to locate my motives.

125
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,054
Motives for what?

126
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:14,607
For finding his killer.

127
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:15,768
That's not your job.

128
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,466
Wyms' office is in charge
of that investigation.

129
00:06:18,898 --> 00:06:21,881
I know. And Wagenbach, he's a good man.

130
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,195
But he's only looking at this
from the Salvadoran angle.

131
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:26,398
What do you want, Jon?

132
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,832
Same thing I wanted last week.

133
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:30,908
Not gonna happen. You
can't see the line anymore.

134
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:33,776
Nobody can see the line.
Mackey just keeps moving it.

135
00:06:34,205 --> 00:06:36,776
Please. I just need...
You need a time for a dead cop.

136
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:38,688
He deserves that.

137
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:44,451
Okay. What is it?

138
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:48,902
The brick of tar
that we found on Lemansky

139
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:52,173
was a part of something dirty
that Vic put into motion.

140
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:54,843
When Curtis got caught,

141
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:57,761
Vic need to protect himself.

142
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,854
So he let Lemansky take the plea

143
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:02,604
while he brokered a deal
with Antwon Mitchell

144
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:04,622
for his guy's safety in the joint.

145
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:07,078
But the Mitchell deal went bad.

146
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:10,144
Curtis, he panicked,
on the run.

147
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:13,464
Vic knew that this guy was gonna crack,

148
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:16,353
- That curtis was gonna
- Mackey killed his own guy?

149
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:19,710
More than likely, he cut a
deal with the Salvadorans.

150
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,802
But somebody put that grenade
in Lemansky's lap.

151
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:25,031
And Vic, he knows who did it.

152
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:28,077
Let Wagenbach follow
the Salvadoran trail.

153
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:29,791
Let me look into Vic.

154
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:31,026
Discreet.

155
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,228
Respectful.

156
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:37,075
I want your report end of day tomorrow.

157
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:39,843
We'll decide if it
makes sense to pursue.

158
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:41,502
You'll have it.

159
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:43,506
Thank you, sir.

160
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:00,638
There's nothing new on Lem.

161
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:03,518
We've been spending more time
knocking down false confessions.

162
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:05,513
It's all a smokescreen.
It's Guardo.

163
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,028
We stepped on his drug
protection play twice.

164
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,502
Killing Lem was a message to stay away.

165
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,144
Been waiting on you.

166
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:14,860
Water street
methadone clinic got torched.

167
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,045
Go check that out.

168
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,793
We're not arson patrol.

169
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:20,515
Well, it's a drug rehab
in a heavy gang area.

170
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,743
I can't sign off on you
working Lem's murder.

171
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,401
Take a step back.
Focus on something else.

172
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:28,676
If we find something out,
we'll let you know.

173
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:31,840
Hey, um, Corrine was here last night.

174
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:34,179
She hadn't heard from you.
The kids were worried.

175
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:35,405
Maybe you should call her.

176
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:39,115
Right.

177
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:46,418
Shit. Split. Split.

178
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:48,569
Hey!

179
00:08:49,718 --> 00:08:50,755
Hey!

180
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:51,913
Turn that shit off.

181
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:53,739
Come here.

182
00:08:54,552 --> 00:08:56,138
How's Antwon's favorite errand bitch?

183
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:57,503
- You got a need?
- Yeah.

184
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:58,638
To do this.

185
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:05,627
Damn, I got left overs older than you.

186
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,909
Yeah, but not as tasty.

187
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:12,110
Hey, looks like Moses finally made it

188
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:14,036
to the land of milk and underage honey.

189
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:16,580
- She legal.
- And all kind of willin'.

190
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:18,374
Vic.

191
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,204
Goddamn!

192
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,279
Looks like business has been good.

193
00:09:23,002 --> 00:09:24,026
No thanks to you.

194
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,340
Goddamn empty safe.

195
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:30,166
Looks like your daddy
might have a broken sugar, darlin'.

196
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,594
You wanna get off
the dead-banger's list,

197
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,354
you learn to play
by the rules.

198
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,941
The first one is,
we still make the rules.

199
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:44,880
Burnt-out clinic on water.
That's a 1-9er block.

200
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:47,124
Looks like you guys
might be holding the match.

201
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:49,166
- We got no beef with the methadonians.
- No.

202
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,293
They good business.

203
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,273
How's them climbing
off the horse help you?

204
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,246
What we lose in h
we gain in benzos.

205
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:57,367
Some of them junkies
drop 10 tabs a day.

206
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,877
- Clinic knows that's going on?
- They don't give a shit.

207
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:01,114
Getting clean's big money.

208
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:04,623
Turns those street junkies
into state-sponsored ones.

209
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:05,845
Hell, yeah.

210
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:08,347
Some of them zombies been
on the m-dose 20 goddamn years.

211
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,707
Shit.

212
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,812
Get a hold of the torched clinic.

213
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:15,082
See if anybody violent's
trying to kick their dose.

214
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:16,315
Someone on the jones?

215
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:19,047
Hurting. Delusional.
I'd be setting fires.

216
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,399
Call Wyms. Have her post unis
at all the methadone facilities.

217
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:26,267
You, tell your fearless leader

218
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:28,567
he ever needs a favor,
he shouldn't hesitate to call.

219
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,774
I owe him one.

220
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:39,144
Clinic said Quentin garth's been doing
the home-study methadone kick.

221
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:40,823
This idiot's lowering
his own dosage?

222
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:41,954
Down to 30 mils.

223
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,707
Volatile, raging about how
he's being screwed by big medicine.

224
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:45,829
Threatened a counselor.

225
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:49,007
Lives here with his best friend.
No one's seen either of them for 2 days.

226
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:00,619
Kitchen's clear.

227
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:04,230
- Bedroom's clear.
- Looks like

228
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,947
Quentin's seen some time in the desert.

229
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,692
Probably where he
picked up his habit.

230
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:08,903
You smell that?

231
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:10,846
Yeah.

232
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,225
Smells like burnt toast.

233
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,410
Kevin Smith.
The roommate.

234
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:25,691
Cracked his skull open.
Went through his wallet.

235
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:26,820
Left him for dead.

236
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:29,036
I'm glad this guy's
his best friend.

237
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:31,036
I'd hate to see what
he'd do to his enemies.

238
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:45,756
Thank you.
Got anything new on the Lemansky murder?

239
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:48,028
N-- No.

240
00:11:54,062 --> 00:11:56,306
Uh, I called you actually.

241
00:11:56,428 --> 00:11:58,991
Is there any way to get in touch
with your el Salvadoran C.I.?

242
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:01,395
Emolia?
What do you wanna talk to her for?

243
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:02,869
Guardo's my lead suspect.

244
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:05,522
She's seen him, knows that world.
Maybe she's got a pipeline.

245
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,436
She talked about...

246
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:10,280
Going to seattle...

247
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:11,432
Be with her sister.

248
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,457
I really don't know
where she is right now.

249
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:15,499
Um, you parking here?

250
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,108
- I thought your investigation was over.
- It is.

251
00:12:18,256 --> 00:12:19,499
I'm opening a new one

252
00:12:19,902 --> 00:12:21,527
in conjunction
with Lemansky's death.

253
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,597
I'm creating a timeline
for my lead suspect.

254
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:27,612
Who is that?

255
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:30,080
This is footage from
the city and freeway cams

256
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:31,958
on the night that Lemansky was murdered.

257
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:34,433
In his voluntary statement
given the next morning,

258
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:35,995
Mackey said :

259
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:38,052
"It was
too late to see my kids,

260
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:40,592
so I hopped on the 10.

261
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:42,678
Headed towards the coast highway.

262
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:44,347
That drive always clears my head."

263
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,278
You're establishing
a timeline for Vic

264
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:48,594
on the night of the murder?

265
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:51,580
Yeah.

266
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:54,622
Look...

267
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:59,708
Lemansky and Mackey
were extraordinarily tight.

268
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:01,304
Plus you've got no motive.

269
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:04,693
Here's the thing, man.

270
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:09,972
I had Aceveda tell Mackey

271
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:11,953
that Lem was cutting a deal,

272
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:16,761
that he was giving up Vic
and his team for immunity.

273
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:21,236
I knew that Mackey would go to Curtis

274
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:23,034
to try to find out the truth.

275
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:26,424
So we were gonna tail him,
get him on aiding and abetting.

276
00:13:27,252 --> 00:13:29,577
But Vic and his guys, they shook up.

277
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,763
A couple of hours later,
I see him standing over

278
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:33,900
Lemansky's body.

279
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:36,238
Jesus Christ.

280
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:39,218
Maybe it wasn't mackey.
Maybe he couldn't do it.

281
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:41,218
But he needed it done.

282
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,091
He had Lem killed.
Because I gave him up.

283
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:48,564
All right, let's get
an apb out on Quentin.

284
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:50,720
Ex-military.
Probably has guns.

285
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:52,308
Let's track down family members,

286
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,534
drug dealers.

287
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:55,041
And let's ask our clinic guy...

288
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,011
What's up?

289
00:13:58,152 --> 00:13:59,159
What?

290
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:01,590
Have you seen this?

291
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:12,701
Claudette, you knew about this shit?

292
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:13,893
I read it.

293
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:15,845
Lem gave 12 years to this department.

294
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:17,394
God knows how many arrests.

295
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,854
Never saw his picture
in the paper once for any of that.

296
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:22,760
The reporter got wind of facts
and brass couldn't control the spin.

297
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:23,902
That's bullshit.

298
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,744
Johnson's been looking for a corruption
goat since he made chief.

299
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:28,199
He pinned
the horns on Lem.

300
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:30,326
It's a shitty ending
to an ugly story.

301
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:31,893
And with the bad cop buried,

302
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,256
you and the Department
get a fresh start, right?

303
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,507
What happened to Lemansky
was an awful thing.

304
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:38,197
I'm sorry. But he made the choice

305
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:40,118
to stash the heroin in his car.

306
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,563
He made the choice to run.

307
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:44,397
Kavanaugh browbeat
that admission on him.

308
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,908
Then he threatened to dump him
in Antwon's bottom bunk.

309
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:48,361
He ran because he was scared.

310
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:50,031
He forced Lem to make another deal.

311
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:52,677
What are you talking about?

312
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,224
Becca said that Lem made a second deal

313
00:14:58,377 --> 00:14:59,683
with Kavanaugh and the chief.

314
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:02,142
The only way Lemansky
would make another deal

315
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:04,855
was if he turned in other
dirty cops, and he didn't.

316
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:06,752
What?

317
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,126
It was the same deal.

318
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:10,130
He was willing to do more time

319
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,200
if I.A.D. could assure him
they'd keep him out

320
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:13,527
of Antwon's reach.

321
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:15,611
He was killed before it went through.

322
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,741
No.

323
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:19,890
Police council is making a
formal statement this evening.

324
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:22,415
We'll be as respectful as we can.

325
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:25,598
Let me guess.

326
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:28,154
That respectful face is Aceveda's.

327
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:29,288
What do you think?

328
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:38,039
Aceveda said that Lem gave us up,

329
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:41,365
that he told him
about the money train.

330
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,860
Kavanaugh must've heard a rumor,

331
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:45,630
had his wetback bitch
feed it to us, put us in motion.

332
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:47,379
And we goddamn ate it up.

333
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:51,368
Made me think
my own guy turned on me.

334
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:57,257
Hey, Julian, what the hell
is Kavanaugh doing here?

335
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,174
Heard he's working
Lemansky's murder with Dutch.

336
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:18,188
According to his visa stamp,

337
00:16:18,418 --> 00:16:20,576
Rene arrived in L.A. 18 hours after

338
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,061
Lemansky was killed.

339
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,979
He says he's got 2 cousins
who saw him kill Lemansky.

340
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:42,382
Um, cousins got addresses?

341
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:47,672
He doesn't know.

342
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:48,808
Right.

343
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:50,096
I need a minute with you.

344
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:52,442
Okay.

345
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:56,507
Run the cousins'
names through I.N.S., DMV.

346
00:16:56,638 --> 00:16:57,907
See if you can find addresses.

347
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,967
Kavanaugh's working Lem's murder?

348
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:11,621
An angle of it,
and it's not my choice.

349
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:12,761
Which angle?

350
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,464
He didn't really go into any detail.

351
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:17,739
Don't dick me around, Dutchman.

352
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:22,717
You're the angle.

353
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:51,611
Oh, hey. Oh, I'm sorry.

354
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,758
That's OK.
I was just taking a minute.

355
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,258
Oh, my God.

356
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:57,663
Wow. He's big.

357
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:00,945
He's beefy and happy.

358
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:03,039
You mind if, uh...

359
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:04,569
No. Okay. Sure.

360
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:06,712
Hey. It's OK.

361
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:10,543
I just had to take care
of some insurance stuff,

362
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:12,020
so I thought I'd show him off.

363
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,794
He's beautiful, Danielle.

364
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:17,262
Thanks.

365
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:21,531
- See you.
- Yeah.

366
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:24,578
Say bye.

367
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:27,673
Let's go inside.
Come on.

368
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,540
I guess I should start making
my funeral arrangements now.

369
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:43,672
Right, Lieutenant?

370
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:45,015
Why would you wanna do that?

371
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,962
Seems like every cop
you investigate ends up dead.

372
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:50,082
I'm not at liberty to discuss

373
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,008
the details
of my investigation with you.

374
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:53,719
You get my best friend blown up.

375
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,338
You come into my house.

376
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:57,272
You hang your mistake
and your guilt on me.

377
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:58,416
Detail enough?

378
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:00,490
I know this must be the grief talking.

379
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,358
At what point do your bosses realize

380
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:04,565
you're as delusional
as that sick, crazy,

381
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:06,068
twisted ex-wife of yours?

382
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,052
I guess the same time that yours realize
that you've murdered two...

383
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:10,580
of your own team members.

384
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:17,474
Mackey! Kavanaugh!

385
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:21,839
Knock it off! Knock it off!

386
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:23,210
- Get your hands off.
- Now!

387
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:30,863
Jesus. I got a goddamn lump.

388
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:39,558
What the hell was that?

389
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:40,699
It's not the first time.

390
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:43,139
He and Mackey went at it
at Lemansky's crime scene.

391
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:44,933
Took 9 unis to break it up.

392
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:46,954
This is you being discreet?

393
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:49,549
Mackey advanced on me both times.

394
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:51,108
It was self-defense. You saw that.

395
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,884
I.A.D.'s supposed to be
the objective eyes of the department.

396
00:19:54,022 --> 00:19:56,499
Objectivity doesn't lead to brawls
and pissing matches.

397
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:57,776
I don't need that report.

398
00:19:57,921 --> 00:19:59,727
You're done with Mackey.
You're off of this.

399
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,630
Get your ass out of the barn

400
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:04,877
before I hit you
with an insubordination beef.

401
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:07,775
Okay, look, stop.

402
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:15,824
I have proof that Vic
had Lemansky killed.

403
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:20,495
I do.

404
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,020
What proof?

405
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:26,188
Emolia Melendez.

406
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:29,551
Vic used her to get a message
to the el Salvadorans.

407
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:32,856
She set up Lem's murder for Vic.

408
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,720
You told Dutch that you
didn't know where she was.

409
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:42,614
I don't. She called me.
She was terrified.

410
00:20:42,737 --> 00:20:44,992
Maybe she was trying
to create another revenue source.

411
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:47,172
Is there anything this woman
won't say for a buck?

412
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:49,793
Mackey threatened her kid.

413
00:20:50,481 --> 00:20:53,115
She was terrified.
She had no choice, all right?

414
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:54,564
Just bringing this to us now?

415
00:20:54,695 --> 00:20:57,756
I've seen Mackey slip out of every
noose that we've had around his neck.

416
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:00,213
I don't even know who to
trust around here anymore.

417
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:02,157
I mean, you gave me
to the end of the day,

418
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:04,390
and I was just trying
to put the pieces together

419
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,829
before I brought them to you.

420
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:12,339
Let's bring her in.
Let's hear her.

421
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:15,675
All right.

422
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,288
I have D.A. gave us some leads
to where Emolia might be.

423
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:21,345
Dutch is out there writing them down.

424
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:25,124
Okay. I'll give him a call.

425
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:31,674
Emolia, it's Jon. Jon Kavanaugh.

426
00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:35,380
What the hell are you doing here?

427
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:36,712
You alone?

428
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,778
Sebastio's at my mom's. Why?

429
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,506
The detective said he
wasn't coming here, right?

430
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,331
No. What's the matter?

431
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:46,603
No toys.

432
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,631
Sebastio's spending all
this time at your mom's?

433
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:50,960
Yeah. He's safe there.

434
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,105
What are you afraid of?

435
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,257
I snitched on Guardo.

436
00:21:56,832 --> 00:21:59,367
People know.
They want me dead.

437
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:01,437
What about Vic?

438
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,639
He hasn't got your back now?

439
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:05,334
Vic ain't shit for me.

440
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,742
Not taking care of you anymore?

441
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:10,363
Him and his guys shit all over me.
Called Sebastio a retard.

442
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,750
That's wrong.
I'm sorry about that.

443
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:16,363
But I have a way to make things right.

444
00:22:24,314 --> 00:22:25,318
Jesus.

445
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,244
Lem didn't rat.

446
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,003
You made me believe
my own guy turned on me.

447
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:34,827
I have people waiting in my office.

448
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:37,357
You were in bed with
Kavanaugh the whole time.

449
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:41,334
Kavanaugh played us both.
Squeezed me, too.

450
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:43,704
- I had no choice.
- Bullshit.

451
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,636
Your jones to hurt me
let you turn a blind eye

452
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:48,259
at what he was doing to Lem.

453
00:22:49,532 --> 00:22:51,112
You knew about the Antwon threat.

454
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:52,855
That scare
put him on the run,

455
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:54,263
got him killed.

456
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:55,916
What, so it's my fault?

457
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:00,115
When do you ever take
responsibility, Vic?

458
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:02,198
When is anything your fault?

459
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:05,058
If you weren't a heartbeat away
from being forced out right now...

460
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:07,182
What? You'd take my badge?

461
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:08,417
Go ahead.

462
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,371
Is that what you and Kavanaugh want?

463
00:23:11,511 --> 00:23:12,511
Take it all.

464
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,844
Here.

465
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:15,507
Take it.

466
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:17,992
What the hell are you doing?

467
00:23:18,124 --> 00:23:20,906
You wanna end a career,
you do it straight up

468
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,717
to someone who's still alive.

469
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:24,958
Who could still
look you right in the eye.

470
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:29,962
I'm sorry about Lem.

471
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:35,600
Then don't disgrace him.

472
00:23:37,394 --> 00:23:38,678
You know, it's not my fault.

473
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:41,378
It's not my call.

474
00:23:42,678 --> 00:23:44,373
I'm just the face of the decision.

475
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:05,919
I say that Vic used me as a middleman

476
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,637
to set up the hit on his guy.

477
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,201
Yes.

478
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,518
He had it all planned out.

479
00:24:11,077 --> 00:24:13,563
Give the exact time and place
where Lem will be.

480
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:16,098
We'll go over the exact details later.

481
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,781
Thought you stopped other cops
from doing this kind of thing.

482
00:24:18,914 --> 00:24:19,918
Vic did this.

483
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:22,980
I'm just trying to get you
to tell the truth.

484
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,457
It's just somebody else's
truth, that's all.

485
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:27,553
I won't get in trouble?

486
00:24:28,212 --> 00:24:30,631
You're gonna tell 'em
that he threatened your son.

487
00:24:30,796 --> 00:24:32,096
That, uh...

488
00:24:32,491 --> 00:24:33,742
That you were scared...

489
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,409
and you had no other
choice but to do this.

490
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,824
And i'll get
all those things?

491
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,883
A house with a pool.
Monthly checks.

492
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:42,649
This is real, Emolia, this is real.

493
00:24:46,222 --> 00:24:47,254
It might be my mom.

494
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:51,353
Emolia Melendez?
You in there?

495
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:53,081
It's Detective Wagenbach.

496
00:24:53,953 --> 00:24:55,863
I just need to ask you a few questions.

497
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,764
You're not in trouble.

498
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,933
Ma'am? Excuse me.

499
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:03,093
Ma'am.

500
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:08,360
Okay, I need a place where
Vic would wanna meet you.

501
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:11,443
It needs to be a public place
where it's not very crowded.

502
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:13,270
Uh, Sewing shop.

503
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:17,632
Did some work for them the other day.

504
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:20,794
Do you speak english?

505
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,506
Um, excuse me...
Gracias.

506
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:27,633
Hello. Wagenbach.

507
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:31,417
Dutch, Jon Kavanaugh.
Did the Captain called you?

508
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:32,709
No. Why?

509
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,347
Emolia reached out to me.

510
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm on my way
to meet her.

511
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:40,128
She's at Tama's costura,
a Sewing shop on Haden.

512
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:42,245
Uh... Are you sure about that?

513
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,623
I got some possible 20s
from calls her sister made.

514
00:25:44,747 --> 00:25:46,640
I think she's dodging
my knock at one of 'em.

515
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:49,149
You do whatever you want,
but I would think a Sewing shop

516
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,535
would be a great place
to follow up your Guardo lead.

517
00:25:51,668 --> 00:25:53,462
<i>But you know,
this is your case, whatever.</i>

518
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:55,406
OK, I'll meet you there.

519
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,648
And then what did he do?

520
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,233
Shot out the door,

521
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,065
called me a sick shithead,
and then tried to cap me.

522
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:09,064
Got this diving out of the way.

523
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,658
Do you have any idea who it was, Axl?

524
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:12,892
Never seen him before.

525
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,541
Think you could describe
him for a sketch artist?

526
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,044
Yeah.
I got one of those photogenic memories.

527
00:26:23,634 --> 00:26:26,729
Someone is unhappy with him peddling
filth through to the neighborhood.

528
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,457
Porn's a billion-dollar industry.

529
00:26:29,862 --> 00:26:32,748
What? All I'm saying is there's
a lot of people who are okay with it.

530
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:35,653
Look, you start knocking
on doors across the street, alright?

531
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:36,887
I'll get these.

532
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:41,250
You could use
some tight-assed lube yourself, sparky.

533
00:26:42,488 --> 00:26:43,555
What am I supposed to do?

534
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:46,730
Just sit back and let this
shitbag tank my career, too?

535
00:26:47,423 --> 00:26:48,533
He's goddamn poison.

536
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:50,042
Kavanaugh's not my problem.

537
00:26:50,534 --> 00:26:51,555
Oh, I am?

538
00:26:51,686 --> 00:26:53,791
Pensions hasn't received
your retirement paperwork.

539
00:26:54,219 --> 00:26:56,605
- I'm still sorting that out.
- You were supposed to keep

540
00:26:56,753 --> 00:26:59,437
a low profile so you could get out with
a piece of your pension.

541
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,206
There's been a lot going on around here.

542
00:27:02,716 --> 00:27:04,450
Phillips thinks too much is going on.

543
00:27:06,928 --> 00:27:08,969
This came directly
from the chief's office.

544
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:15,400
This puts my retirement
effective immediately.

545
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:18,793
You take it now, the chief will
see you get a piece of your pension.

546
00:27:19,663 --> 00:27:20,686
Why now?

547
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,513
I had until my 15 mark.

548
00:27:23,846 --> 00:27:25,476
Certain things are in motion.

549
00:27:25,986 --> 00:27:27,221
This is a lifeline.

550
00:27:27,352 --> 00:27:29,771
Sign this, and it'll
save us all a lot of grief.

551
00:27:29,912 --> 00:27:31,739
- If you don't...
- You can't cut me loose.

552
00:27:31,887 --> 00:27:32,892
It's not my idea.

553
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:35,112
Brass is gonna be watching
every move you make.

554
00:27:35,311 --> 00:27:36,990
You need me to make this place work.

555
00:27:37,138 --> 00:27:38,916
I need people I can trust.

556
00:27:41,172 --> 00:27:42,542
So you won't help me fight this.

557
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,773
You know a reason I should?

558
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:47,035
Quentin showed up at another clinic.

559
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:48,945
Unis spooked him. He's got hostages.

560
00:27:51,123 --> 00:27:52,506
Who you're gonna trust with that?

561
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,202
All right, boys, here it is.

562
00:27:58,597 --> 00:28:00,984
This guy's got a doctor,
a mother and her 3-month-old son

563
00:28:01,116 --> 00:28:02,284
trapped in an examing room.

564
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:05,069
He's doused the Doc
and the mother with gasoline,

565
00:28:05,189 --> 00:28:07,649
threatened to use them as kindling
if they didn't shut down

566
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:10,710
- all their methadone clinics.
- Negotiator and SWAT's 30 minutes out.

567
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,966
Let's go.
Shane, you coming?

568
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:15,012
- Shane.
- Yeah.

569
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:16,856
Yeah.

570
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:23,516
He'll shoot the cans,
blow the hallway if he

571
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,799
needs to seal himself off.

572
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,325
Hey, there skylights in every room
in this place?

573
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:29,465
Get her out of here.

574
00:28:30,913 --> 00:28:32,214
Get me a peeper scope.

575
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:35,263
I'll go on the roof, see if
I can look in on what's happening there.

576
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:37,522
I don't want anyone
rattling this guy's cage.

577
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:39,349
I don't want anyone talking to him.
Hey.

578
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,778
- Are you with me?
- Yeah.

579
00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:44,518
'cause Ronnie and I
can take care of this.

580
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:46,049
- I'm here man.
- No, you're not.

581
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:47,859
I got innocents soaked with gasoline.

582
00:28:48,174 --> 00:28:49,968
- I need your head in the game.
- It is.

583
00:28:50,297 --> 00:28:51,482
I promise. I'm OK.

584
00:28:52,602 --> 00:28:53,605
Okay.

585
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:02,097
Can I help you?

586
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,039
You have any idea where Vic is?

587
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:05,998
We haven't seen him
since Lem's memorial.

588
00:29:06,738 --> 00:29:07,743
No, I don't. I saw him

589
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:09,668
at the barn for a second.
That's about it.

590
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:13,323
You think Vic's staying here?

591
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:15,299
It crossed my mind.

592
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:16,468
He's not.

593
00:29:18,015 --> 00:29:19,019
Sorry.

594
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,973
Hey. Vic and me, we're not a thing.

595
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:27,661
What about that thing in your arms?

596
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,097
Whatever shitpile you're
cleaning up with your ex,

597
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:32,039
don't come dumping it
on my doorstep.

598
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,046
And don't ever call my son a thing,

599
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,700
you uptight bitch.

600
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:38,699
I'm not uptight, sweetheart.

601
00:29:38,848 --> 00:29:39,902
I'm a realist.

602
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:41,745
You have no idea what has been dumped

603
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:42,931
on your doorstep.

604
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,655
Vic. He is not gonna be there for him.

605
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:47,665
- Well, I don't need anyone's help.
- Really?

606
00:29:47,793 --> 00:29:50,571
You think you're gonna be a full-time
cop and take care of this kid

607
00:29:50,692 --> 00:29:52,998
- all by yourself?
- Just 'cause you couldn't handle it

608
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,326
- doesn't mean that I won't be able to.
- And if they tell you he's autistic?

609
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:02,742
My son is fine.

610
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:04,212
They're all fine at first.

611
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,583
But we have 2 autistic kids,

612
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:09,430
and there's a genetic
predisposition for siblings.

613
00:30:10,195 --> 00:30:12,187
Maybe you're the one
with the screwed-up genes.

614
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:14,737
Maybe. Maybe not.
But keep your eyes open

615
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:17,954
because the sooner the doctors know,
the more they can do for him, okay?

616
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,152
Mom and the doctor
are jammed in the corner.

617
00:30:26,276 --> 00:30:28,926
The baby's on a table by the door.

618
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:30,629
If we can get him to give up the kid,

619
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:33,106
<i>SWAT can drop down between
the junkie and the innocents.</i>

620
00:30:33,238 --> 00:30:35,543
I'll get an E.T.A.
On SWAT and the negotiator.

621
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:38,870
Jesus Christ.
Don't hurt that little baby.

622
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:42,195
Stop! I'm gonna kill
this goddamn baby, man.

623
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:46,842
Everybody just shut the hell up!

624
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,455
I'm gonna kill this goddamn thing.

625
00:30:48,603 --> 00:30:49,615
Hey, Quentin.

626
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:50,826
Shane.

627
00:30:51,895 --> 00:30:52,900
Quentin.

628
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:54,035
Listen to me, man.

629
00:30:54,381 --> 00:30:57,294
The reason the baby's crying
is 'cause of the gasoline.

630
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:59,698
The fumes are probably burning his eyes.

631
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:03,207
What the hell's he doing?

632
00:31:03,352 --> 00:31:04,376
You better get down here.

633
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:07,577
Just hand the kid over to me,
get a little peace and quiet.

634
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:09,223
Just focus on what you got to do.

635
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:14,195
Who the hell are you, man?

636
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:16,009
I'm a cop. What?

637
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:18,297
I'm a cop. Shane Vendrell.
I'm unarmed.

638
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:21,046
Just hand over the crying kid...

639
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,162
and take me instead.

640
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:26,310
A quiet Detective is a much
better bargaining chip, man.

641
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:31,344
Nah. It's a con.

642
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:33,487
You're full of shit.
Just like everything else.

643
00:31:33,635 --> 00:31:35,344
No, it's not a con. It's...

644
00:31:36,777 --> 00:31:37,781
Oh, no!

645
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:39,600
Quentin.

646
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:42,127
Quentin, listen to me.
Open the door, buddy.

647
00:31:42,753 --> 00:31:44,122
Quentin, open the door.

648
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:47,052
Look, OK. Look.

649
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,768
Look, buddy. You see?

650
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:51,636
You see?

651
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:53,126
Oh, my God.

652
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:56,600
Jesus Christ, Shane.

653
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:00,452
It's no con, man.

654
00:32:01,104 --> 00:32:02,112
It's no con.

655
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:03,730
Get ready to move.

656
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:08,363
Any point you think I'm lying...

657
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:10,058
Just...

658
00:32:10,272 --> 00:32:11,639
You just flick your bic, brother.

659
00:32:12,412 --> 00:32:13,416
Okay?

660
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:15,671
Don't worry. I will, man.

661
00:32:16,857 --> 00:32:17,869
Shit!

662
00:32:19,392 --> 00:32:20,395
Quentin!

663
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,321
Quentin, listen to me, man.

664
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:24,693
Is there a closet in there
or a cabinet or something?

665
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:26,438
Somewhere where the baby can breathe.

666
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,282
Yeah. I mean, it's...

667
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:31,903
good. Just put him in there
and close the door, OK?

668
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:33,805
It keeps the fumes out of his eyes.

669
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:46,512
See? I told you, Quentin.

670
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,673
I told you, man, you can trust me.

671
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:54,915
I think this psycho's going for Shane.

672
00:33:01,094 --> 00:33:02,098
Stop. Right there.

673
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:06,356
You get him?

674
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,324
Are you all right?

675
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:10,908
Yeah. Glad you put on a vest.

676
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,044
Check the kid.

677
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:20,021
You wanna tell me what
the hell happened back here?

678
00:33:23,346 --> 00:33:25,980
We just saved 3 innocents
from a homicidal junkie.

679
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:28,986
Maybe you could draw up the paperwork

680
00:33:29,612 --> 00:33:30,665
and let me sign it.

681
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:39,336
You lied. You lied to me.

682
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:40,966
You lied!

683
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:47,224
Captain, here's a sketch
of that guy that shot up

684
00:33:47,357 --> 00:33:48,546
the sex shop this morning.

685
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,381
Black, early 20s, earrings.

686
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:51,640
Narrows things down.

687
00:33:53,122 --> 00:33:54,933
I don't have anybody free.

688
00:33:55,081 --> 00:33:57,031
Could you jump on
this porn shop shooting?

689
00:33:57,171 --> 00:33:59,810
Sounds titillating,
but I'm still a little woozy.

690
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:02,410
That's what I get for trying
to keep the peace, right?

691
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:03,596
Maybe you should go home.

692
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,394
I leave now it chews up
one of my personal days.

693
00:34:06,888 --> 00:34:09,271
I'm gonna hang
and clean up some paperwork.

694
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:10,555
I'll be OK.

695
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:11,691
Thank God.

696
00:34:12,431 --> 00:34:15,757
Circulate it to the skin joints,
bookstores. See if he's a regular.

697
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,172
OK.

698
00:34:18,538 --> 00:34:20,084
DMV didn't have any of the addresses

699
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:22,603
on the cousins of the el Salvadoran
we questioned.

700
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,167
And I'm still waiting on I.N.S.

701
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:25,327
Good girl.

702
00:34:30,156 --> 00:34:31,160
Good girl?

703
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:33,520
It's part of my new
mentoring philosophy.

704
00:34:33,684 --> 00:34:34,689
Right.

705
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:38,606
I thought you were meeting
Kavanaugh and picking up Emolia.

706
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:41,002
Me, too. Sent me to the sewing shop.
It was closed.

707
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:42,130
No one ever showed.

708
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,216
Vic said I should tell Guardo

709
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:48,750
I was sorry for turning on him.

710
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,020
Offer up my handler asrestitucion.

711
00:34:52,735 --> 00:34:54,579
He knew that guardo
would wanna hurt the cop

712
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,480
that crushed his drug
protection comeback.

713
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,312
Jesus. You told 'em it was Lem.

714
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:02,479
They gave me the place, the time.

715
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,150
I set it up. Told him it was a
blond cop I've been working for.

716
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:08,800
You did this because
Vic threatened your son.

717
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:11,722
Said if I did it,
he'd give me 500 bucks.

718
00:35:11,852 --> 00:35:12,865
If I didn't,

719
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:15,363
Sebastio's hospital bill
would be a hundred times

720
00:35:15,485 --> 00:35:16,490
that much.

721
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:17,654
What choice did I have?

722
00:35:18,148 --> 00:35:19,152
You have the money?

723
00:35:19,794 --> 00:35:22,715
No. He was supposed to drop it
off at the Sewing shop yesterday.

724
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,085
He never did.
I got scared.

725
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:27,974
Figured if he could off
his own guy that way,

726
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:30,312
what's to stop him
from killing me and my boy?

727
00:35:30,657 --> 00:35:31,744
That's why she called me.

728
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:35,530
I got a man staying with her
mother and with her son right now.

729
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:39,290
Yeah. I just want us all to be safe.

730
00:35:39,981 --> 00:35:41,133
Far away from Vic.

731
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:43,388
Phillips is on his way.

732
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:46,898
We should wait till he gets here before
we get into more of these details.

733
00:35:47,507 --> 00:35:48,511
You did fine.

734
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:56,902
Hey, uh, what happened to you?

735
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:58,178
I went to the Sewing shop.

736
00:35:58,721 --> 00:35:59,725
Oh, sorry about that.

737
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,535
Emolia moved the meeting place
3 times after I talked to you.

738
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:05,950
Where'd you finally meet her?

739
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:09,127
Behind Sid's.
Coffee place on Wilton.

740
00:36:09,621 --> 00:36:12,074
That place across from the 101 on Ramp?

741
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:14,062
I think so. I think so.

742
00:36:15,165 --> 00:36:16,169
Ask Emolia. She'd know.

743
00:36:16,481 --> 00:36:17,683
Anyway, no harm, no foul.

744
00:36:25,003 --> 00:36:27,357
Easy. Ow!
I know you're pissed at me.

745
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:30,484
I don't give a shit
if I hear from you, OK?

746
00:36:31,037 --> 00:36:32,189
I'll make it up to the kids.

747
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:35,152
Hope you have another bag of cash
put aside for the years of therapy,

748
00:36:35,284 --> 00:36:36,881
- they're gonna need
- Don't say that.

749
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,115
Cass is just like you.

750
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,121
- She internalizes everything.
- Hey!

751
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:41,553
Hey. You doing OK?

752
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,743
Yeah. I'll live,

753
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:45,997
as long as my ex isn't
the one taking care of me.

754
00:36:46,244 --> 00:36:47,495
Hey, Corrine.
Hey.

755
00:36:48,598 --> 00:36:50,416
We're gonna need an x-ray
of that shoulder.

756
00:36:54,902 --> 00:36:56,042
How you feeling?

757
00:36:56,362 --> 00:36:57,366
Good.

758
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,219
I still smell a little like diesel.

759
00:36:59,696 --> 00:37:01,244
Just like Ronnie's aftershave.

760
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:08,039
What the hell was that today?

761
00:37:10,047 --> 00:37:11,808
I just saw a way
to make your plan work.

762
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,524
My plan wasn't turning you
into a duraflame.

763
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:17,184
I've had enough funerals for one week.

764
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:20,032
It was just my own little spin.

765
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:23,291
You can put another one
in the win column, though, right?

766
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,291
Listen, man.

767
00:37:28,307 --> 00:37:30,315
We've all been beating
ourselves up about Lem.

768
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:33,690
But it's like you said, man.

769
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:36,126
It's nobody's fault.

770
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:38,299
Except Guardo's.

771
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:39,806
- Yeah.
- Hey.

772
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:41,913
Come here.

773
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:48,302
Wyms and the chief are trying
to push through my retirement.

774
00:37:48,763 --> 00:37:51,084
I'm not sure why,
but I don't have much time.

775
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,482
- No man.
- That's why you...

776
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:54,499
can't get reckless.
You hear me?

777
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,506
I'm gonna need your help
to finish this thing.

778
00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:02,043
I can't lose you, too, Shane.

779
00:38:05,023 --> 00:38:06,027
You won't.

780
00:38:15,238 --> 00:38:16,390
This doesn't add up.

781
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:18,983
The pieces fit. Motive, timing.

782
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:21,023
He's got a compelling case.

783
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:25,985
Look, you and I both know Vic is a
cop with questionable ethics.

784
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:29,277
He capable of killing another cop?
Maybe. But Lem?

785
00:38:30,544 --> 00:38:31,721
Her story's a little neat.

786
00:38:31,878 --> 00:38:33,692
I'm at the last house
on the D.E.A. List.

787
00:38:33,826 --> 00:38:35,686
I knock. I definitely
hear someone inside.

788
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:38,024
Maybe two people.
They don't come to the door.

789
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:39,818
Then I get a call from Kavanaugh

790
00:38:39,966 --> 00:38:42,106
sending me off and running
to the sewing shop?

791
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,224
Seems strange.

792
00:38:45,162 --> 00:38:47,483
You think he's pushing the story?

793
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:49,409
Lying?

794
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,187
That doesn't fit either.

795
00:38:51,335 --> 00:38:53,684
Here's a guy who wouldn't bend
the rules for his ex-wife

796
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,814
when any other cop
in this building would have.

797
00:38:57,977 --> 00:38:58,981
I know that look.

798
00:39:00,627 --> 00:39:01,681
Something's not right.

799
00:39:02,866 --> 00:39:04,858
Chief wants Vic
on the retired list

800
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,747
before we file any charges.

801
00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:08,755
He's not going without a fight.

802
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,269
What do you want me to do?

803
00:39:12,064 --> 00:39:13,232
Stick to the Guardo angle.

804
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:14,631
Bring Vic in for questioning.

805
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:16,836
See what he has to say
about Emolia's story.

806
00:39:17,198 --> 00:39:18,202
Okay.

807
00:39:21,741 --> 00:39:22,811
I'm gonna head home now.

808
00:39:23,617 --> 00:39:25,658
I might need to take
that personal day tomorrow.

809
00:39:25,807 --> 00:39:28,561
Oh, we'll try to fill the void.

810
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:31,640
Uh, Vic.

811
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,928
You cruising for interns?

812
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:35,080
How's the shoulder?

813
00:39:35,228 --> 00:39:36,282
Kevlar is my friend.

814
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:40,951
Kavanaugh's brought in a witness

815
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:43,363
who claims you hired
the el Salvadorans to kill Lem.

816
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:45,972
What witness?

817
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,814
Emolia Melendez.

818
00:39:50,991 --> 00:39:52,316
What's Kavanaugh offering her?

819
00:39:52,686 --> 00:39:53,722
Witness protection.

820
00:39:55,616 --> 00:39:56,867
So you're here to arrest me?

821
00:39:57,088 --> 00:39:58,520
Right now I just need a statement.

822
00:39:58,652 --> 00:40:00,216
You think I did it? Lem?

823
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,364
I need to take you back to the barn.

824
00:40:05,565 --> 00:40:06,783
Well, I can drive myself.

825
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:14,093
OK. I'll see you back there.

826
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:29,193
Mackey's lawyer will
paint her as a paid snitch,

827
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:30,974
promised the american dream in exchange

828
00:40:31,106 --> 00:40:32,168
for her testimony.

829
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,036
There's no evidence backing this story.

830
00:40:34,538 --> 00:40:36,529
That's why I wanna
continue this investigation.

831
00:40:36,661 --> 00:40:38,053
This report is not complete yet.

832
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,540
What about Wagenbach's
el Salvadoran suspect?

833
00:40:41,462 --> 00:40:43,116
I've seen Dutch cozy up to Mackey.

834
00:40:43,256 --> 00:40:45,066
I don't know where his loyalty lands.

835
00:40:45,198 --> 00:40:46,975
We need to get him off
this Lemansky case.

836
00:40:47,124 --> 00:40:49,321
We don't want another guy
tipped off and on the run.

837
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,189
Okay.

838
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,189
I'll talk to Wyms about him.

839
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,908
But this time if you can't
keep it from becoming personal,

840
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,789
I'll go disciplinary on you, Jon.

841
00:41:04,085 --> 00:41:06,669
You'll lose those lt bars.
You hear that?

842
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,134
I hear it.

843
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,589
Tell the chief he's got my word.
Nothing personal.

844
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:18,613
What's this?

845
00:41:18,757 --> 00:41:21,423
Requesting today's footage
from the 101 freeway cam

846
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:25,045
at the Wilton on-ramp
across from Sid's coffee.

847
00:41:25,522 --> 00:41:26,526
Just a hunch.

848
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:29,176
Any sign of Vic? Not yet.

849
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,479
Captain, a guy fitting the description
of our sex shop shooter

850
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:34,253
was seen in 4 other video stores today.

851
00:41:34,379 --> 00:41:35,860
He bought out every copy of that.

852
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:41,402
I am not familiar with
the "Dick 'n' Granny" series.

853
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:43,564
Hopo productions is owned and operated

854
00:41:43,705 --> 00:41:44,816
by holes and poles, inc.

855
00:41:44,956 --> 00:41:46,371
That the owner who got shot at?

856
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:49,798
Yes. Not only is Axl the producer,
director, and distributor.

857
00:41:50,272 --> 00:41:52,232
But guess who's wearing
the Nixon mask.

858
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,883
The Richard Nixon mask's
a reflection of your

859
00:41:55,031 --> 00:41:56,035
political bent?

860
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:58,142
Or are you just afraid to be associated

861
00:41:58,274 --> 00:41:59,278
with your own smut?

862
00:41:59,772 --> 00:42:00,776
It's my hook.

863
00:42:01,795 --> 00:42:03,638
I'm Richard Nixon
and I'm dickin' granny.

864
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,141
Yeah, we get it.
Who's the old lady?

865
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,606
Why?
She's of age, right?

866
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:12,644
- All my actors sign contracts...
- Whoever shot at you

867
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,038
this morning bought up
every copy of that in the city.

868
00:42:15,262 --> 00:42:17,698
Maybe he's a little upset
about you dickin' granny.

869
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:22,555
Shit. Number 3.

870
00:42:23,247 --> 00:42:24,300
Forgot her name.

871
00:42:24,456 --> 00:42:27,066
First-timer.
She was raw.

872
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:29,601
But in the end, I always
get a good performance.

873
00:42:31,147 --> 00:42:32,908
We need a name and address.

874
00:42:34,044 --> 00:42:35,048
It's Vic.

875
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:37,320
Yeah.

876
00:42:37,451 --> 00:42:40,480
Anyone ever tell you that you
have incredibly expressive eyes?

877
00:42:41,073 --> 00:42:42,192
Ever been on film?

878
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:44,596
Ever been in a mug book?

879
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:50,785
Family emergency.
He can't come in right now.

880
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:52,317
He'll run out of emergencies,

881
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:53,733
then we'll get to the truth.

882
00:42:55,412 --> 00:42:57,667
Hard to believe this place
was ever a church.

883
00:42:59,346 --> 00:43:01,716
We can track down
Axl's granny in the morning.

884
00:43:02,072 --> 00:43:03,109
It's been a long day.

885
00:43:03,258 --> 00:43:06,036
I'm okay. I'll wait for the
address and follow it up tonight.

886
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:09,522
It's your first week.
You can't keep up this kind of pace.

887
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:12,402
Now, I'm just talking general health.

888
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:14,776
You got to take care of yourself.

889
00:43:16,947 --> 00:43:19,449
Can I tell you something
doesn't go beyond these pews?

890
00:43:19,786 --> 00:43:20,791
Of course.

891
00:43:21,581 --> 00:43:23,369
Phillips paid me a visit today.

892
00:43:26,686 --> 00:43:28,348
If I don't turn this place around

893
00:43:29,681 --> 00:43:31,657
before the quarterly
statistics come out,

894
00:43:33,017 --> 00:43:35,634
they might be saying mass
down there again real soon.

895
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:47,874
I'm Captain Wyms.

896
00:43:48,006 --> 00:43:49,611
Sorry to disturb you so late, ma'am.

897
00:43:50,607 --> 00:43:51,611
You know this man?

898
00:43:56,263 --> 00:43:57,274
Edmond!

899
00:43:58,387 --> 00:43:59,465
Edmond!

900
00:44:00,312 --> 00:44:01,974
Stop!
Stop!

901
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,275
Drop the gun!

902
00:44:03,737 --> 00:44:04,740
Drop that gun.

903
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:06,206
Drop the gun.

904
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:08,376
Please, kid, just drop the gun.

905
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:11,106
- Please don't make me shoot you.
- Drop the gun, asshole

906
00:44:11,238 --> 00:44:13,060
- or I will shoot.
- Edmond, don't!

907
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,825
- Just drop the gun, kid.
- Drop the gun goddamn it!

908
00:44:15,957 --> 00:44:17,587
- Do it now!
- Drop... The gun.

909
00:44:19,002 --> 00:44:20,006
Get on your knees.

910
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:21,472
Why did you do it, grandma?

911
00:44:21,604 --> 00:44:23,617
Get down on your knees.
Get down on your knees.

912
00:44:23,755 --> 00:44:24,759
Right now!

913
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,179
How could you let that man
do that to you?

914
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:33,584
He got arrested for stealing
a car 6 months ago.

915
00:44:34,884 --> 00:44:36,415
I need his bail money.

916
00:44:37,798 --> 00:44:39,346
You shouldn't have
done it, grandma.

917
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,827
Why'd you be his whore?

918
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:48,023
What are you doing here?

919
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:52,459
You got Emolia to lie for you.

920
00:44:54,221 --> 00:44:56,540
Now you know the difference
between a lie and a truth?

921
00:44:56,983 --> 00:44:58,498
You think I'm a cop killer.

922
00:45:00,934 --> 00:45:02,053
Maybe I am.

923
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,207
You're a cop, right?

924
00:45:10,894 --> 00:45:13,380
That sounds like a direct
threat on my life, Detective.

925
00:45:13,939 --> 00:45:14,960
You know what that means?

926
00:45:16,565 --> 00:45:17,602
It means you just stepped

927
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:19,961
onto an entirely
new playing field.

928
00:45:21,904 --> 00:45:22,924
And for your sake,

929
00:45:24,274 --> 00:45:25,961
I hope you know the rules of the game.

930
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:31,880
That it? You came all the way down here

931
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,255
just to blow words by me?

932
00:45:33,551 --> 00:45:34,638
It's a street tactic.

933
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,847
Always let the bad guy
know you're on to his game.

934
00:45:38,676 --> 00:45:41,853
Makes him change tact
so he makes mistakes.

935
00:45:42,067 --> 00:45:43,499
Then I guess I should let you know

936
00:45:44,264 --> 00:45:46,272
that you're wanted for
questioning in the murder

937
00:45:46,396 --> 00:45:47,400
of Curtis Lemansky.

938
00:45:48,305 --> 00:45:49,544
There are unis at your house,

939
00:45:49,742 --> 00:45:51,346
and they're waiting to bring you in.

940
00:45:58,943 --> 00:46:00,067
Gabino Guiz.

941
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,816
This is the address
I.N.S. gave me for the cousin.

942
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,042
Nobody home.
What a shock. Let's go.

943
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,694
Oh, that's gross.

944
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:31,891
Dutch. Bloody cat prints.

945
00:46:43,938 --> 00:46:45,386
Crime scene. Tread lightly.

946
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:53,657
6-Paul-32 requesting
4 additional units and CSU

947
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:55,590
at 89 San Marcos.

948
00:46:55,738 --> 00:46:58,652
I've got multiple 187s,

949
00:46:58,932 --> 00:47:01,483
3, possibly 4...

950
00:47:12,517 --> 00:47:14,311
you got to be shitting me.

951
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,698
They're asleep.

952
00:47:16,896 --> 00:47:18,707
I just didn't feel like going home.

953
00:47:20,715 --> 00:47:22,641
I'm sorry I dropped out this week.

954
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:25,686
They just need to hear your voice.

955
00:47:27,983 --> 00:47:28,987
What is it?

956
00:47:29,152 --> 00:47:31,983
Kavanaugh's trying to prove I had
something to do with Lem's death.

957
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,617
Oh, my God. That's ridiculous.

958
00:47:34,766 --> 00:47:37,496
He got some low-life
C.I. To lie for him.

959
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,290
What are you gonna do?

960
00:47:41,562 --> 00:47:42,566
<i>I'll get right to it.</i>

961
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,566
<i>Last year Captain Rawling
initiated an inquiry</i>

962
00:47:46,714 --> 00:47:49,056
<i>into the Farmington gang and drug unit.</i>

963
00:47:50,123 --> 00:47:52,748
Supervised by lieutenant
Kavanaugh from I.A.D.,

964
00:47:52,888 --> 00:47:55,588
<i>this department conducted
a 7 month investigation...</i>

965
00:47:56,149 --> 00:47:57,154
Daddy!

966
00:47:57,285 --> 00:47:59,180
Get out! Go back in your room right now!

967
00:47:59,682 --> 00:48:00,883
I'm sorry. I just didn't want

968
00:48:01,015 --> 00:48:03,493
- her to see.
- <i>Detective Lemansky fled justice,</i>

969
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:04,711
<i>became a wanted fugitive.</i>

970
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:07,659
<i>No doubt the thought
of spending years in prison</i>

971
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:09,437
<i>was a frightening proposition.</i>

972
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:11,494
<i>We'll never know</i>

973
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:14,887
<i>what triggered Detective
Lemansky's reluctance</i>

974
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:16,846
<i>to serve his time.</i>

975
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:18,443
<i>Because less than 24 hours later,</i>

976
00:48:18,887 --> 00:48:20,270
<i>he was found brutally murdered.</i>

977
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,511
<i>Someone dropped a live grenade</i>

978
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:25,946
<i>in the front seat of his car.</i>

979
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:30,448
<i>That murder investigation
is ongoing and as of yet</i>

980
00:48:31,436 --> 00:48:32,852
<i>no suspects are in custody.</i>

981
00:48:36,972 --> 00:48:39,062
<i>And our condolences go out
to Detective Lemansky's</i>

982
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:40,272
<i>friends and family.</i>

983
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,379
<i>But within this tragedy,
there is a message,</i>

984
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:48,685
<i>and one that I hope will
shake this department to its core.</i>

985
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:55,469
<i>Breaking the law and wearing a
badge is a dangerous combination,</i>

986
00:48:57,345 --> 00:48:58,810
<i>and this city will not tolerate it.</i>

987
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:01,692
<i>This department
will not tolerate it.</i>

988
00:49:07,635 --> 00:49:09,693
<i>It's the primary objective
of this Police Council</i>

989
00:49:09,824 --> 00:49:11,642
<i>over the next 18 months</i>

990
00:49:13,206 --> 00:49:15,363
<i>to squash corruption
within our own ranks.</i>

991
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:22,920
<i>And cops involved
in any illegal activities</i>

992
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:25,348
<i>will be rooted out.</i>

993
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,546
<i>They will be relieved of duty</i>

994
00:49:28,895 --> 00:49:31,136
<i>and prosecuted to
the full extent of the law,</i>

995
00:49:32,831 --> 00:49:35,695
<i>just as Detective Curtis
Lemansky was being prosecuted</i>

996
00:49:35,844 --> 00:49:37,243
<i>for his corrupt actions.</i>

997
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:38,543
You son of a bitch.

998
00:49:38,691 --> 00:49:40,205
<i>This community
needs police officers<i>

999
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:42,479
<i>who are peaceful and
trustworthy civil servants.</i>

1000
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:45,146
<i>It's our goal</i>

1001
00:49:45,788 --> 00:49:48,701
<i>to return dignity
and respect</i>

1002
00:49:49,129 --> 00:49:50,150
<i>to the badge...</i>

1003
00:49:56,046 --> 00:49:58,515
And to the men and women who
wear one a reason to be proud.

1004
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:07,312
Nothing personal.
