00:00:00,388 --> 00:00:02,200
<i>Previously on </i>The Shield<i>...</i>

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,413
My Detectives found
12 bodies hacked to pieces.

3
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:06,037
Well, 11 bodies, one arm.

4
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,163
Machete is the weapon of
choice for the salvadorans.

5
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:10,854
It supports the tip that
Aceveda's cronies gave us

6
00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:12,743
that the killers were Salvadorans.

7
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:14,416
The victims were all mexican illegals.

8
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:15,821
IDs? All but the arm.

9
00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:17,533
The guy at I.N.S. IDed the arm

10
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:18,914
from San Marcos house.

11
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:19,915
Eduardo Romero...

12
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,042
A mid-level bureaucrat

13
00:00:21,043 --> 00:00:22,101
in the mexican government.

14
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:24,727
Could embarrass a lot of powerful people
on both sides of the border.

15
00:00:24,728 --> 00:00:25,540
You solve this,

16
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,818
that's a dozen murders
in the win column.

17
00:00:27,977 --> 00:00:29,310
It just might be enough.

18
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:30,417
This door is open.

19
00:00:30,418 --> 00:00:32,042
What do you know about
a guy named Hernan?

20
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:32,977
He's a Fed...

21
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:35,078
Undercover in the
salvadoran organization.

22
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,915
Woman: Benjamin Westcott Gilroy.

23
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,459
The mexican authorities sent him back.

24
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,416
Any family?

25
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:41,417
Wife.

26
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:42,543
I killed Lem.

27
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:44,359
Please forgive me, please!

28
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,618
I can't! I can't do this any more.

29
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:47,728
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:49,415
Vic: You dropped a grenade in his lap.

31
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,541
And what did you do?
Did you run?

32
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:51,542
Shane?!

33
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,214
Shane: I did what I thought
had to be done at the time.

34
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:56,680
He wouldn't go to Mexico.

35
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:57,854
I told him about the money

36
00:00:57,855 --> 00:00:58,791
that we were gonna send him.

37
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,041
And he never turned on us!

38
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:01,855
We couldn't afford
to take that chance.

39
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:03,104
I mean, all I was doing

40
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,336
was following your game plan, coach.

41
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:07,462
Get in your truck, drive away.

42
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,716
Leave here before I kill you.

43
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,076
I called you all last night.

44
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,138
Did you talk to Shane?

45
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,139
What happened?

46
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:26,642
He did it.

47
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:28,827
He killed Lem.

48
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:33,645
Oh, Jesus Chirst.

49
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:37,578
He confessed?

50
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,075
He pocketed a grenade

51
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,687
before Aceveda's even told us
about Lem's deal.

52
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:43,799
He looked him right in the eye,

53
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,862
dropped it in his lap, and ran.

54
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:48,629
Never included us,
never talked to us.

55
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,203
Just took it on himself

56
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:52,926
and killed a guy who was
only looking out for us.

57
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:56,767
Where is he now?

58
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:58,757
Oh, enough.

59
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,204
It's over.

60
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:01,927
He's... He's never coming back.

61
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,020
He's moved on.

62
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,860
Are we here for Hernan?

63
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:11,205
He called a meeting,

64
00:03:11,206 --> 00:03:12,428
said it was important.

65
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:24,120
Reaching out to me is
a big risk to your cover.

66
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:24,948
I know.

67
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:26,751
When I went to up L.A. zinman
on the separate arm

68
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:30,470
that you guys found at San Marcos,
I was met by some new guy.

69
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,460
Talbert.

70
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:34,696
They gave you a new
handler midstream?

71
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:35,707
Yeah.

72
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,642
This guy knew the arm
belonged to Romero.

73
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:38,767
Told me to leave it alone.

74
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:39,879
End of conversation.

75
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,519
A mexican official loses a limb

76
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,797
in a hacked up pile
of dead mexi illegals

77
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:47,696
and the U.S. and mexican governments
both turned a blind eye?

78
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:49,430
I've seen this shit go down before.

79
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:51,618
Some fairway up the food chain
is getting greased.

80
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:52,841
Keep it off the books.

81
00:03:53,055 --> 00:03:54,493
Brings in his own overseer...

82
00:03:54,494 --> 00:03:55,929
Keeps everyone else in the dark.

83
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,581
If you don't trust
who you tell it to then,

84
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,071
you're lost undercover.

85
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:01,822
Well, until I know more,
I need a lifeline.

86
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:11,611
Throway cell phone.

87
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,681
Number can't be traced to anybody.

88
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:15,054
You need me, you call me.

89
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,308
Salvadorans are promoting.

90
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:17,975
I could use a push to Captain.

91
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,370
Get my own crew,

92
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,369
open me up to a whole
lot of gang secrets.

93
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,369
Well, how big of
a push do you need?

94
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,703
Boss has a meeting
at Lonya's bar on ninth.

95
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:28,498
Need a raid at 2:00 Sharp.

96
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:30,741
Well, what am I gonna find?

97
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:31,992
Nothing. I'm gonna tip them off

98
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:33,491
20 minutes before you show.

99
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:35,117
Tell them I've got a mole in the P.D.

100
00:04:35,118 --> 00:04:36,118
Hmm.

101
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:37,471
We'll come and knock.

102
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:43,741
Let's go!

103
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:44,614
What's up?!

104
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:45,365
We got a street fair

105
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:47,177
filled with confetti and dead bodies.

106
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:49,928
Got 6 shot up at the el salvador
del mundo festival.

107
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:52,484
4 dead, multiple injuries,
women and children.

108
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:54,473
I was waiting to see what
the mexican payback would be

109
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:55,724
for the San Marcos murders.

110
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:58,002
- City tactical?
- No, we're on our own, man.

111
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,197
Oh, Shane called in sick today.

112
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:01,198
He OK?

113
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:02,600
Seemed fine last night.

114
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:11,824
Unis are outnumbered.

115
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:12,634
Help them out.

116
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:15,011
Spoke to 3 witnesses.
All tell the same stories.

117
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:17,073
6 mexican bangers
stroll in wearing backpacks.

118
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:18,199
All wearing byz lat ink.

119
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,325
Only nobody pays any attention

120
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:20,573
till they pull out sawed-off shotguns

121
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:21,948
and start shooting at everybody.

122
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,011
Vic: Salvadoran bangers
sponsored this fair.

123
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:25,075
This looks like retaliation

124
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,909
for the San Marcos house murders.

125
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:28,136
Hernan said the el salvadorans

126
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:30,025
had nothing to do with San Marcos.

127
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:31,451
It was an internal mexican beef.

128
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:32,199
Well, he's wrong.

129
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,588
This smells like payback.

130
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:34,986
Bad intel on his P.R.

131
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:36,952
He lied.

132
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:38,802
Danny: Hey, hey!
Step back! Hey!

133
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:40,076
Hey, ma'am! Hey!

134
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:42,705
My son!
My son was shot!

135
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:45,418
Let me see him! No!

136
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:48,529
Look, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to
stay behind the line, OK?

137
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,101
We need to talk to Hernan

138
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:56,473
and find out why he lied to us
about San Marcos.

139
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:57,600
The salvadorans are close to

140
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:59,037
giving him his Captain's stripes.

141
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:00,482
He must not want local law

142
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:01,598
turning up the heat on him.

143
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,654
It's stepping on
his upward mobility.

144
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:04,716
Plus, he's nervous.

145
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:05,724
About what?

146
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:08,724
We got a buddy at I.N.S.

147
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:10,161
Who IDed the chopped off arm

148
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,725
that we found at
the San Marcos house.

149
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:13,337
It belongs to Eduardo Romero.

150
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:15,287
He's a midlevel mexican bureaucrat.

151
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:17,121
Hernan contacted me this morning.

152
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:19,163
He's nervous because
I.C.E. is telling him

153
00:06:19,164 --> 00:06:21,322
to back away from the Romero trail.

154
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:23,531
Wagenbach: Sounds like somebody
in immigration has got their feet 

155
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:24,820
to the fire doesn't want to get burned.

156
00:06:24,821 --> 00:06:25,841
Hernan's spooked.

157
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:28,706
He reached out to me because
he doesn't trust his chain of command.

158
00:06:28,707 --> 00:06:29,957
That doesn't mean we have to back off.

159
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,518
You run with that Romero L.A.

160
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,958
It might be the break we need
in the San Marcos case.

161
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,830
Find the byz lats who
shot up the festival.

162
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:37,108
Hernan wants us to raid

163
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:38,921
a salvadoran bar this afternoon.

164
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,894
He's gonna give the bosses
an early heads-up.

165
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,081
Earn points by keeping
them out of harm's way.

166
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:45,648
Salvadoran bosses are already
planning a retaliation.

167
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:47,021
We need to bring them in now.

168
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:48,834
Going in early could
set Hernan back.

169
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:50,036
He set us back

170
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:51,289
by lying about San Marcos

171
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:52,779
being mexican on mexican.

172
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,707
He can gain favor with the bosses
some other way.

173
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,041
Phillips: Captain Wyms?!

174
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,326
Uh, I know the street festival
thing looks bad.

175
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:05,020
I got the Strike Team and
my best Detectives on it.

176
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:07,535
San Marcos is still unsolved, now this?

177
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:10,366
Wilshire and Central
agreed to lend a hand.

178
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,597
I don't recall asking them for help.

179
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:14,221
Send copies of everything you have

180
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:15,660
on the street fair
shooting and San Marcos

181
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:17,883
so wilshire and central
can back you up.

182
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:22,276
Shane here?

183
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:23,972
No. I haven't seen him.

184
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:25,871
He didn't come home last night.

185
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,358
Everything all right between you two?

186
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,754
Where the hell is he?

187
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:30,211
I'll be right out.

188
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:35,648
I don't know where Shane is.

189
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:36,837
Maybe you should ask the Captain.

190
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:37,903
She might be able to help you.

191
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:38,744
He doesn't do anything

192
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:39,710
without you knowing about it.

193
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,155
Don't dick me around here.

194
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:42,650
I'm not.

195
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:43,651
That's his job.

196
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:47,115
I know what happened last night.

197
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,023
It was a busy evening.

198
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:52,801
You'll have to be more specific.

199
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:56,276
About Lem.

200
00:07:57,963 --> 00:07:58,963
What about Lem?

201
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,339
If you did anything to hurt Shane...

202
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,617
Why would I hurt Shane?

203
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,506
What is it you think you know?

204
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,255
I know everything about Shane.

205
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:12,909
We don't have any secrets.

206
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:17,755
Open and honest.

207
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:20,791
That's always the best way, right?

210
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,558
<i>Exiled</i>

211
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:52,668
Vic: God damn it!

212
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:54,415
Bosses got out of here in a hurry.

213
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,748
Ronnie: Waitress said they all took off

214
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,921
when they heard about
the street Fair shooting.

215
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:00,310
Hernan knew we'd come
early for the bosses.

216
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:02,357
He's pulled them out
early to gain trust.

217
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:04,982
I'm beginning to think this guy
is kind of an asshole.

218
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:05,983
Let's flip it.

219
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:43,484
Yeah?

220
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:45,840
Hey, sorry I missed
your <i>Yamada</i>, amigo.

221
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:47,261
Still need them smokes.

222
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,911
You with the bosses?

223
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:50,874
There a retaliation plan?

224
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,951
<i>Si, los Macanudos and los Dukes.</i>

225
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:55,777
<i>Not the regs.</i>

226
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,721
That shit burns like garbage.

227
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:00,236
Garbage.

228
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:01,681
<i>She got them in stock, eh?</i>

229
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:17,639
Vic: Found your cigars.

230
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:20,109
These the addresses for the bosses?

231
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,924
Why not put two aside for me, eh?

232
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,036
Don't forget me, ay?

233
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,600
Pick you up with the rest of them.

234
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:25,549
<i>Si, amigo.</i>

235
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,550
Buenos noches.

236
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:32,549
I take back the asshole
comment about Hernan.

237
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,550
He came through.

238
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,736
Wants us to scoop him up

239
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:36,265
with the rest of the bosses.

240
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:36,985
Preserves his cover,

241
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:38,548
gets the shot-callers off the street.

242
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:40,239
Buys us some time to make a peace.

243
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,049
Julien: Yeah, but
the shooters were byz lat.

244
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,297
Just picking up the salvadorians

245
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:46,131
might raise suspicions that
we've got a guy inside.

246
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:47,176
Gang sweep.

247
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:48,489
Wide net.

248
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,878
Salvadorans and mexicans.

249
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:53,524
Hernan's just another sad brown face
in the paddy wagon...

250
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:54,892
Until we get him along.

251
00:10:58,739 --> 00:10:59,985
How can I help with the fallout?

252
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:03,597
Phillips had me send over our case files
to Wilshire and Central.

253
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:06,174
Our stats are tanking.

254
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:07,302
He's gonna shut this place down.

255
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:08,550
No, I would have heard something.

256
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:09,737
He's bringing them up to speed

257
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:11,738
so that when they split
the farm in half,

258
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:13,524
the transition goes smoothly.

259
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:15,806
And keeping it under the radar.

260
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:16,927
Protect morale.

261
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:18,983
It's hard to motivate cops

262
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:21,226
when your home base is a sinking ship.

263
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:23,366
I'll look into it on a policy level.

264
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:25,442
How can I help right now?

265
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,738
Those extra bodies you threatened
to spoil us with, I need them tonight.

266
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:29,739
For what?

267
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,988
Gang sweep.

268
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:32,365
Gonna bring in as many byz lat

269
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:33,977
salvadoran bangers as we can.

270
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:36,427
It gives us time to find the shooters,
negotiate a peace.

271
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:39,118
The mexican and salvadoran communities
both feel victimized.

272
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,174
It sounds punitive.

273
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,738
It's a warrant sweep.

274
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:44,176
It's bringing felons
in from the front lines.

275
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:45,510
It'll feel like a siege.

276
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,991
I.C.E. has an undercover operative

277
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:53,880
high up the salvadoran food chain
I need to protect.

278
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,345
I gotta pick him up without
anyone getting wise.

279
00:11:57,805 --> 00:11:59,138
He can help us end this.

280
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:03,171
Man: 4-screen movie theater.

281
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:05,296
Restaurants, shopping.

282
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,180
Walking distance from
our low-income housing.

283
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:09,236
A medical center...

284
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,430
It sounds like a community.

285
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:14,281
These people work hard for their money.

286
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:17,326
Shouldn't have to bus to Beverly Hills
to spend it.

287
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:21,743
Hey, did you hear about
the street Fair shooting?

288
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:22,744
Oh, yes.

289
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:23,991
It's awful.

290
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,680
Yeah, looks like byz lat retaliation

291
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:27,514
for the San Marcos house murders.

292
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,371
Why am I not surprised?

293
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:33,853
Captain Wyms is planning a gang sweep.

294
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:36,549
Everyone with an outstanding warrant,

295
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,068
mexicanos, salvadorans...

296
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:41,416
A blitzkrieg against latinos.

297
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:43,799
A preemptive safety measure.

298
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,931
We're getting gang
members off the street.

299
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,265
Keep the community safe.

300
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:49,055
And between my media contacts

301
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:52,556
and your community and commercial clout,
we convince the press,

302
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:55,578
the neighborhood,
that we're here to help.

303
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:57,431
These people, they...

304
00:12:57,432 --> 00:12:58,876
They don't see us latinos.

305
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:01,348
They see a developer
and a former cop.

306
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:03,486
The barn's at risk.

307
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:06,306
If Captain Wyms doesn't reduce
your crime stats,

308
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:08,617
it goes away, which means
less cops in our district.

309
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:11,117
So, what good is all this
if we can't protect it...

310
00:13:11,118 --> 00:13:12,673
Or the people who come here?

311
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:17,017
Salvadoranio women and children
were injured today.

312
00:13:17,182 --> 00:13:18,793
A sweep of their community...

313
00:13:18,996 --> 00:13:20,107
It's not protection.

314
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,432
It's an assault.

315
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:27,370
There's an operative
inside the salvadorans

316
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,815
who can help solve
the street Fair shooting,

317
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:32,931
but we need to pick him up
without casting suspicion.

318
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:34,709
A gang sweep protects his cover.

319
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,233
I can't spin this alone, man.

320
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:40,441
Can you help me sell this?

321
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:47,863
Tell me what to do.

322
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:52,308
Hey, buddy.

323
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:55,172
Did you miss me?

324
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:56,498
Oh, you missed me!

325
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,060
What do you think?

326
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,921
Where the hell have you been?

327
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,290
I just been driving, thinking.

328
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:06,247
Maybe you were getting
your dick sucked

329
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:07,970
by your under-age nubian whore?

330
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,818
Hey, watch your mouth.

331
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,900
It's my mouth I'm worried about.

332
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:14,456
Don't throw that shit in my face.

333
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:16,100
I left you a message.

334
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:17,871
I said not to wait up.

335
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:19,199
Yeah?

336
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:20,969
That was 24 hours ago.

337
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:23,117
And you know what? I'm still up.

338
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:24,996
Mara, my cell died.
I couldn't get to a phone.

339
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,941
I didn't know what
happened to you!

340
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:28,434
I'm sorry.

341
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:29,872
I'm OK.

342
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:32,199
I was just figuring some shit out.

343
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:33,762
OK? I promise. I promise.

344
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:35,655
I'm so freaked out.

345
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,123
I went to Vic.

346
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,084
I... But I didn't believe
him when he told me...

347
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:42,311
You talked to Vic?

348
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:44,060
When you didn't come home,

349
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:46,005
I went to the barn looking for you.

350
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:48,355
Well, what did you say to him?

351
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,277
I just asked him where you were.

352
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,611
He scared the shit out of me.

353
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:57,445
Well, why would he scare you, Mara?

354
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:00,290
Mara, what did you say to him?

355
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:01,313
I... I don't know.

356
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:03,036
Did you say anything about Lem?

357
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:04,813
Did you?

358
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:11,620
I think he might have figured it out.

359
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:13,688
God damn it.

360
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:16,687
What else, Mara?

361
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,936
What else did you say to him?

362
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:19,690
Huh?!

363
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:21,311
I told him we didn't
have any secrets.

364
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:26,889
You know who this guy is?

365
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:28,439
What he's done?

366
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,998
The shit he can do, Mara,

367
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:31,813
not just to me,
but to you and jacks?

368
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:33,688
What's he done?

369
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:36,626
The two of you?

370
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,607
What else have you done, Shane?

371
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:41,875
What?!

372
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:42,876
Enough!

373
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,967
Is he gonna tell
them about Lem?

374
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,002
Will they send you to prison?

375
00:15:51,003 --> 00:15:51,939
He's not gonna say anything.

376
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,106
You can't go to jail.

377
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:55,439
He's not gonna
say anything to anybody

378
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
because I know everything he's done.

379
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,189
So, you're a threat to him.

380
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:02,818
Oh, God.

381
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,393
We gotta get out of here.

382
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:05,564
We gotta get out of L.A...

383
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,009
I know. I put a call in...

384
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:08,252
This morning to Vice

385
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:09,753
to try to get my spot back.

386
00:16:10,314 --> 00:16:11,814
I'll work for a year or so.

387
00:16:11,877 --> 00:16:14,128
I'll squirrel away enough for us
to get out of here.

388
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:15,752
I just gotta...

389
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:17,620
Take some precautions first.

390
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:19,565
What do you mean?

391
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:21,126
Listen to me:

392
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,751
I don't want you to say
anything, OK, just listen.

393
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:26,252
I want you to pack a bag
for you and Jackson,

394
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:29,052
just light, but enough
to live on for awhile.

395
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:31,238
- What are you gonna...
- No, just listen to me.

396
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:33,429
All right, this is just a backup plan.

397
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:36,477
Just in case we gotta
get out of here in a hurry.

398
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:37,567
OK?

399
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:43,040
Oh, shit.

400
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,003
I...

401
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:47,004
I'm supposed to see
Corrine tomorrow.

402
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,005
She's gonna give us
some baby stuff.

403
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:51,005
You know what? That's good.

404
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:53,144
That's good.
Make a day out of it.

405
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:57,254
Vic won't do anything to us

406
00:16:57,444 --> 00:16:59,666
when we're with his wife and kid, right?

407
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:06,003
Hiatt: Our two key targets:

408
00:17:06,004 --> 00:17:07,754
Octavio Menez, he's calling shots

409
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:09,878
for the salvadorans
while Guardo's M.I.A.

410
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:11,601
SWAT, you'll all about him, OK?

411
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:15,503
My team's on Santi Galas,
who's next in line as the byz lat C.E.O.

412
00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:16,192
Captain?

413
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:19,254
Wyms: OK, the rest of you,
know your man and your location.

414
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:21,064
We'll move to set
positions in 15 minutes.

415
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:24,005
Vic: these Scumbags lives with family
that means elderly and kids.

416
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:26,130
So, safety off, but easy on the trigger.

417
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:27,131
- Let's go.
- OK!

418
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,007
Ronnie?

419
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:32,255
Ronnie, you're bringing in Hernan.

420
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:33,644
They know Mackey.
We need a new face.

421
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:35,004
We already surveilled his apartment.

422
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:36,992
He lives with two other bangers,
so hit him hard.

423
00:17:36,993 --> 00:17:38,784
Bedroom is on the southeast side.

424
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:40,229
Talbert: Agent Talbert, I.C.E.

425
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,088
You can't run an op'
involving one of my men

426
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:45,382
without coordinating
through my office.

427
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:47,093
Uh, this op is time-sensitive.

428
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:48,622
We didn't have time
to run it by Washington.

429
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:50,184
Look, we got a pretty tight lid on this.

430
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:52,060
But we do need the contact password.

431
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:53,172
I'm not signing off.

432
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:54,055
Wyms: Then don't.

433
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,511
We'll do it with or without your help.

434
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:57,373
I'm putting a stop to this.

435
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:59,830
Vic: A fed suit's swarming
a local warrant sweep?

436
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:01,955
Might as well paint
the bull's eye on Hernan's back.

437
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,330
And we don't answer
to your bosses.

438
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,331
Let's go.

439
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,395
Talbert: Shit.

440
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:07,707
Hey.

441
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,412
Password's honeycomb.

442
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:14,747
He calls you off for any reason,
you let him go.

443
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:16,017
All right.

444
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:27,215
Take your positions.

445
00:18:27,216 --> 00:18:28,216
Move on my signal.

446
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:31,036
Let's go.

447
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:39,601
Man: go! Go!

448
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:44,411
Police! Freeze!

449
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:47,080
Honeycomb.

450
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:48,221
Cop: Let me see your hands!

451
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:55,067
Vic: Donde esta Santi?

452
00:18:55,154 --> 00:18:56,154
Donde?!

453
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:57,903
Muevase!

454
00:18:58,406 --> 00:18:59,406
Vic: God damn it!

455
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:01,134
Santi's out the back!

456
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,621
- Police!
- Go, go, go!

457
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:14,251
Don't move!

458
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:18,314
Godspeed.

459
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:36,503
Can I help you?

460
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:37,747
Uh, Shane Vendrell.

461
00:19:39,756 --> 00:19:40,751
One of Vic's guys.

462
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:42,851
Can I talk to you for a minute?

463
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:45,441
A minute. Yeah.

464
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:50,939
What do you need?

465
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,495
A few weeks ago, you gave...

466
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:55,490
Vic some information
about your late husband...

467
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:58,649
Regarding Ben's time in Mexico...

468
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:00,377
People he knew down there.

469
00:20:00,378 --> 00:20:01,564
Vic said he need that stuff

470
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:02,898
to close out Ben's case.

471
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:04,253
Right.

472
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,445
Well, I'm actually working
on a similar thing and...

473
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,677
And I'm gonna have to get those facts

474
00:20:08,678 --> 00:20:10,962
from you as well, if you don't mind.

475
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:15,004
What case are you working?

476
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:15,816
What is this?

477
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:17,326
I can't discuss the details
with you, ma'am.

478
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:19,961
But you're gonna have to
turn over that information.

479
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:21,130
I don't want to have to file

480
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:22,797
a failure to cooperate charge.

481
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:26,566
I was married to a cop
for 20 years, asshole.

482
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:28,255
Don't threaten me
with bullshit charges.

483
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:29,256
Get out of here!

484
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:31,471
Your daughters know
the truth about their father?

485
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:33,690
- What?
- They know he ripped off the city?

486
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,941
Disgraced the badge for
some dirty latina snatch?

487
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:36,503
Shut up!

488
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:37,942
They know he choked
on his own puke?

489
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:40,943
And died a poor miserable
drunk in some mexi shithole?

490
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:42,754
Those autopsy photos are brutal.

491
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:44,755
You want your daughters to see them?

492
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:51,256
I want those mexican money
contacts by tonight

493
00:20:51,257 --> 00:20:54,090
or I show and tell your girls
the whole ugly truth.

494
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:55,421
I'll show myself out.

495
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:05,941
Vic: Look, man, we know why you lied

496
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:08,257
about San Marcos being
an internal mexican beef.

497
00:21:08,258 --> 00:21:10,035
What we don't know is the truth.

498
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,950
Mexicans got something big brewing.

499
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:17,630
Byz lats are working the cartel
outside of Mexico city.

500
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:19,575
The salvadorans want
a piece of it.

501
00:21:20,383 --> 00:21:21,944
Chopping up the bodies
at San Marcos

502
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:24,193
was all about sending
a message to share.

503
00:21:24,194 --> 00:21:25,194
Share what?

504
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:27,749
Only the captains know that.

505
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:29,680
That's why I need that favor.

506
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:31,433
Gotta earn my stripes.

507
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:32,569
And the missing limb

508
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,403
of a mexican government official?

509
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:36,821
I don't know how that got in the mix.

510
00:21:36,822 --> 00:21:38,134
We can't afford a retaliation

511
00:21:38,135 --> 00:21:39,746
for the street Fair shooting.

512
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:41,319
You need to mediate a peace

513
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,708
between the salvadoran
bosses and byz lats.

514
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,191
There's no peace without
the shooters paying a price.

515
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:48,472
I don't make the rules.

516
00:21:48,822 --> 00:21:51,210
If we get the shooters,
dump them in chino,

517
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:54,667
let the salvadorans celebrate
with a little shiv-fest,

518
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,102
you think you could convince

519
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:57,600
the salvadoran grand poobah

520
00:21:57,601 --> 00:21:59,545
to let that satisfy
his blood lust?

521
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,291
Nah. Octavio's not going
to promote me to Captain

522
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:04,102
if I'm running around
talking like Gandhi.

523
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,793
Hiatt: Then talk like Trump, man.

524
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:07,145
Tell him it's about settling the beef

525
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:09,151
so everyone can get
back to business.

526
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:11,040
I'll see what I can do.

527
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,415
Wyms: You know who
the salvadorans were

528
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,290
who were swinging
the machetes at San Marcos?

529
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,227
No, I don't.

530
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:17,289
And it would be the death of my cover
if I started asking.

531
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,456
Talbert: Salvadorans are closing ranks.

532
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,477
It's getting too dangerous

533
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:21,811
for you to be out there.

534
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,902
I just spent 6 months
in a salvadoran lockup...

535
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,091
Two years out here
with these animals.

536
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:29,991
You're not pulling me
out of this.

537
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:34,248
If he can help settle this beef
earn his stripes,

538
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,394
it could give us a front row seat

539
00:22:36,395 --> 00:22:38,950
to whatever it is the
mexi gangs have brewing.

540
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:42,707
OK.

541
00:22:43,855 --> 00:22:44,956
Wyms: Need a minute.

542
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,125
Got a call from Vice.

543
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:53,334
Shane's put in for his old position.

544
00:22:54,524 --> 00:22:55,524
Makes sense.

545
00:22:55,896 --> 00:22:58,694
Lem gone, me being forced out maybe...

546
00:22:59,582 --> 00:23:00,522
It's the right move.

547
00:23:00,523 --> 00:23:02,136
So, you didn't know about it.

548
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,894
He also requested
two weeks unpaid leave...

549
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:06,770
Same amount of time
you might have left here.

550
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:08,457
This news bulletin
have a point?

551
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,291
His down time is gonna be denied.

552
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,340
It'll take two weeks
to process his request.

553
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,644
Means you'll still
be working together.

554
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:16,331
Fine.

555
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:17,458
Then let me get back at it.

556
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:19,024
Don't leave me hanging here, Mackey.

557
00:23:19,025 --> 00:23:20,521
If something happened
between you two

558
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:23,688
- that affects the job, I need to know
- What affects the job,

559
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:25,715
is our friend getting blown to shit.

560
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:27,352
Now, you got
a problem with Shane,

561
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:29,271
you take it up with
his new team leader.

562
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:30,994
I'm just a hired hand here now.

563
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:38,022
Hiatt: The byz lats and the salvadorans
were playing nice together.

564
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:39,967
Paid them to protect your drug run.

565
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,398
Vic: Come on, Santi.

566
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:42,647
Don't you byz lat assholes know

567
00:23:42,648 --> 00:23:44,398
you gotta get along
with these psychos?

568
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:46,896
Either that or get a grenade
shoved up your ass.

569
00:23:46,897 --> 00:23:48,522
Ain't nothing up
my ass except you.

570
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:50,134
Yeah? Well, how am I feeling?

571
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:53,589
Hiatt: If these street Fair
shooters were to go down,

572
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:56,919
well, it would make your
life a whole lot easier...

573
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,240
Not to mention more profitable.

574
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:00,581
Vic: Blood's gonna keep spilling

575
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:02,393
unless they feel vindicated.

576
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:04,212
I mean, you better
settle this soon,

577
00:24:04,213 --> 00:24:06,490
or you're gonna have
nothing left to run.

578
00:24:18,713 --> 00:24:20,461
We know who the salvadorans were

579
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:23,184
who hacked up your illegal
cousins at San Marcos.

580
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:24,962
We were just waiting for

581
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,629
some I.N.S. red tape to clear,

582
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,397
then were gonna pick
them up in a few days.

583
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:32,115
But maybe these guys get lost
on the way back to the barn.

584
00:24:33,524 --> 00:24:36,091
End up in a bad
neighborhood somehow.

585
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,562
You tell me where to lose them.

586
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,223
If I sacrifice my own guys

587
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:44,782
and give you the shooters.

588
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:46,589
Blood for blood...

589
00:24:47,837 --> 00:24:49,059
The old-fashioned way.

590
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,983
Hiatt: The score's even.

591
00:24:51,276 --> 00:24:52,275
The street calms down,

592
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:54,442
everybody gets back
to commerce, right?

593
00:24:58,025 --> 00:24:59,080
Let me make a call.

594
00:25:03,463 --> 00:25:04,629
That can't be traced.

595
00:25:07,652 --> 00:25:08,652
Throway phone.

596
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:10,516
Use all the minutes you need.

597
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:15,904
Hiatt: Hey.

598
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:18,963
So, where exactly are we gonna find
the San Marcos killer?

599
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:20,130
Somewhere eventually.

600
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:25,515
That Gilroy's widow?

601
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:28,339
Vic: Nance, everything all right?

602
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,714
What the hell is your guy up to?

603
00:25:29,715 --> 00:25:30,588
What guy?

604
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:31,922
That god damn hillbilly.

605
00:25:34,404 --> 00:25:35,459
That's interesting.

606
00:25:37,826 --> 00:25:38,716
All right, what's going on?

607
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:40,439
He showed up at my house today.

608
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:43,022
Wanting that information
I gave you weeks ago.

609
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:45,278
Ben's mexican contacts?

610
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,090
Yeah.

611
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:48,089
He said he's working
on some hush-hush case.

612
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,216
Nothing I know about.

613
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:51,450
I gave you those contacts on the Q.T.

614
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:52,281
If they find out

615
00:25:52,282 --> 00:25:53,485
that I was funneling money to him...

616
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:55,027
No, no. They won't. They won't.

617
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:57,432
I told I.A.D. that I dug up that intel

618
00:25:57,715 --> 00:25:59,603
so they'd put Ben's case to bed...

619
00:25:59,778 --> 00:26:01,444
Leave you and the girls alone.

620
00:26:02,782 --> 00:26:04,529
So, if I put a call into I.A.D.,

621
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,530
they'll know what
I'm talking about?

622
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,251
Oh, Jesus Chirst.

623
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,057
It never ends, does it?

624
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:13,282
I'll take care of Shane.

625
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:17,540
He threatened to tell my girls
all the dirty details...

626
00:26:17,718 --> 00:26:20,062
The embezzlement, the affair.

627
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,001
Gonna show them autopsy photos.

628
00:26:22,406 --> 00:26:24,055
I have done everything in my power

629
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:27,074
to keep them protected from the wreckage
of that asshole!

630
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:29,425
You rein him in, Vic,
or so help me God...

631
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:30,965
No, no.
I'll take care of it.

632
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:31,966
I'm sorry.

633
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:34,870
He's coming by tonight.

634
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,093
Late.

635
00:26:42,407 --> 00:26:44,018
What the hell was that about?

636
00:26:45,114 --> 00:26:47,669
Shane's getting ready
for a long, cold winter.

637
00:26:47,803 --> 00:26:50,191
He's looking for
Gilroy's mexican contacts.

638
00:26:51,057 --> 00:26:52,427
He thinks you're
coming after him?

639
00:26:52,428 --> 00:26:55,240
Put in for a transfer to Vice, too.

640
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:56,796
He's covering all his bases.

641
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,477
We gonna be one of
the bases he tries to cover?

642
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:07,929
I need to talk to the baker.

643
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,930
Woman: OK.

644
00:27:18,432 --> 00:27:19,928
I am Yezik. Can I help you?

645
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,429
What the hell is this shit?

646
00:27:21,555 --> 00:27:22,555
Barazek.

647
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:24,178
No wonder you give it away for free.

648
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:25,567
It tastes like old tires.

649
00:27:27,054 --> 00:27:28,742
Hear you got some
old-school guy...

650
00:27:28,743 --> 00:27:30,743
Kesakian... Running your bakery now.

651
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:32,576
I need to chat with him.

652
00:27:32,744 --> 00:27:33,855
Don't know Kasakian.

653
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:39,370
I see about a dozen health violations
in this room alone.

654
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:40,180
Gives me the authority

655
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:41,991
to start opening up all your ovens.

656
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:44,769
You sure all I'm gonna
find is half-baked Barazek?

657
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:47,280
Maybe I could take
a message to someone.

658
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:49,458
That'd be swell, Yezik.

659
00:27:50,121 --> 00:27:52,617
Tell Kasakian I got a business
proposition for him.

660
00:27:52,618 --> 00:27:54,506
I'm a cop,
he's gonna need to know.

661
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,305
Shane's...

662
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:01,798
He's just so hard
to access sometimes.

663
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,647
Did Vic talk about the job much?

664
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:08,121
Not really.

665
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:09,432
I'd ask him about things,

666
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:10,877
try to get him to open up.

667
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:13,716
After awhile, I stopped asking.

668
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:16,189
Shane tells me some stuff.

669
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,850
That's probably better.

670
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:19,098
It'll keep you close.

671
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,119
I gotta be honest.

672
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:23,995
Sometimes I wish he
didn't tell me anything.

673
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,384
It kind of freaks me out.

674
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:27,240
Yeah, the job sucks.

675
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,703
Turned our marriage bad
and made him hard.

676
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:33,588
He wasn't like that
when I first met him.

677
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,231
He was pretty sweet actually.

678
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:38,598
He's had a tough run.

679
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:41,122
The I.A.D. charges and...

680
00:28:41,123 --> 00:28:42,789
Yeah, those were all bullshit.

681
00:28:43,937 --> 00:28:45,869
He had nothing to
do with Lem's murder.

682
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,870
I know.

683
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,597
And I'm glad it got worked out.

684
00:28:50,808 --> 00:28:51,808
Yeah. We all are.

685
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:54,371
It's the...

686
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:57,172
Off-duty shit that
scares me the most.

687
00:28:57,749 --> 00:28:58,749
You know?

688
00:28:59,748 --> 00:29:00,748
No, I don't.

689
00:29:02,702 --> 00:29:04,482
I'm gonna get you more juice.

690
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,950
Eduardo Romero.

691
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:13,795
Mexico's assistant secretary
of trade and ex P.R.

692
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:15,921
Eduardo senior
vice secretary of finance.

693
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:19,278
Hell's this guy's hacked-off arm
doing in Farmington?

694
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,179
And where's the rest of the corpse?

695
00:29:22,765 --> 00:29:25,203
You... You sure you know
where you're going?

696
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:26,981
I used to troll for U.C.L.A. hotties

697
00:29:27,077 --> 00:29:28,854
when I was in community college.

698
00:29:29,325 --> 00:29:31,324
Wasn't gonna take them back to
my shithole in Alhambra,

699
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:32,491
so I'd drive up here,

700
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,538
say I'm going to
my folks' place.

701
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,700
This worked?

702
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:39,384
You'd be surprised.

703
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:41,333
Now how'd you pull it off?

704
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,016
Never went in.

705
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:47,076
We'd find a place with the lights on.

706
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,021
Tell them my folks came home early.

707
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:51,062
We'd have to go to her place.

708
00:29:51,987 --> 00:29:53,547
It's amazing how quick
to thighs spring open

709
00:29:53,548 --> 00:29:55,548
when they think your
folks got coin.

710
00:29:57,364 --> 00:29:58,363
Looks like Eduardo's ex

711
00:29:58,364 --> 00:29:59,919
found herself a rich gringo.

712
00:30:05,427 --> 00:30:06,799
You know, Dutch, I could teach you

713
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,911
a few things about women, if you want.

714
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:13,049
Why don't you write them down,

715
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,938
and I can read them at my leisure.

716
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:23,612
Kasakian?

717
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,335
I'm an associate, Ellis Rezian.

718
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,038
What the hell is this shit, man?
I said I wanted to speak to Kasakian.

719
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,237
Aboush mee ehlar!

720
00:30:30,363 --> 00:30:31,363
Dour indzI.

721
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:32,738
Dour indzI.

722
00:30:35,677 --> 00:30:36,613
I'm sorry.

723
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:37,929
You want to talk business,

724
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,318
we're here in good faith.

725
00:30:40,425 --> 00:30:41,591
Kasakian's insulated.

726
00:30:42,237 --> 00:30:43,348
Rumors must be true.

727
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:46,299
Old world muscle's moving
back in the hood, huh?

728
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,926
I'm just try to teach our American-born

729
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:49,371
about loyalty and respect.

730
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:51,579
Well, maybe I can help.

731
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:52,669
Set a good example.

732
00:30:57,864 --> 00:31:00,488
It's been awhile since we had a good
relationship with law enforcement.

733
00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:01,865
Yeah, well, chopping off people's feet

734
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:02,989
will strain any relationship.

735
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,212
We'd like to fix that.

736
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,682
That's funny, I'm a fixer.

737
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:11,010
There's a new gas station on Talmadge,
Iraqi owned.

738
00:31:11,317 --> 00:31:12,301
Apparently they have their own

739
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:13,802
arab-based petrol supplier.

740
00:31:14,553 --> 00:31:15,552
That sounds fishy.

741
00:31:15,992 --> 00:31:17,801
Could be funneling money
back to Al-Qaeda.

742
00:31:17,802 --> 00:31:19,024
I better check it out.

743
00:31:19,364 --> 00:31:20,864
That would give me comfort.

744
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:22,304
You and me both.

745
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,517
Thanks for coming down.

746
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:36,991
Must be important

747
00:31:37,114 --> 00:31:38,679
to drive all the way out to my house.

748
00:31:39,162 --> 00:31:41,552
We just need to ask you a few questions.

749
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:42,553
About?

750
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:43,554
Your ex-husband.

751
00:31:43,928 --> 00:31:45,872
When was the last time you saw him?

752
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,931
Years ago.

753
00:31:46,932 --> 00:31:48,209
Before I got remarried.

754
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,402
Still talk to him occasionally.

755
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:51,555
Why?

756
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:52,722
Eduardo's severed arm

757
00:31:53,053 --> 00:31:55,330
was found with several
other dead bodies.

758
00:31:55,682 --> 00:31:57,928
We haven't been able to locate
the rest of Eduardo yet.

759
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:58,929
Oh, my God.

760
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:00,806
Has anybody from
the mexican government

761
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:02,918
contacted you, explain
he was missing?

762
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:03,865
No.

763
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:05,492
We're trying to piece together

764
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:06,867
what he was doing in L.A.,

765
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:08,090
who his contacts were.

766
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:09,796
He came up here...

767
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,127
Twice a year, maybe 3.

768
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:13,558
You know why?

769
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,988
He had family interests to attend to.

770
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,593
Never got specific.

771
00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:20,750
Always stayed in a small
hotel in Koreatown.

772
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:24,951
He could have afforded better,
but this place is private.

773
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:29,554
Where are we on Romero
and San Marcos?

774
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:30,367
Eduardo Romero

775
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:32,242
checked into a hotel under an alias

776
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:34,367
two days before
they hacked his arm off.

777
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:35,743
That's why we couldn't find him.

778
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:37,577
Manager says he hasn't been back.

779
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:38,993
Billings: Hotel manager gave us

780
00:32:38,994 --> 00:32:40,993
the plate number of the Mercedes
he was driving.

781
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:43,160
It's an open-ended rental out of L.A.X.

782
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:45,027
The car hasn't be returned yet.

783
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:47,134
Well, whoever was driving that car

784
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:48,932
either chopped up Romero and the bodies

785
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,667
on San Marcos or they know who did it.

786
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,471
Wagenbach: High-end rentals
all have LoJacks on them.

787
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,787
We're on our way there now.

788
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:54,845
Wyms: Vic?

789
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,736
Salvadorans are on board.

790
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:58,844
Let's see where the mexicans are at.

791
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,993
We'll settle our part of the deal
when we're alone.

792
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,285
Byz lats want to do the right thing.

793
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:11,792
I can give you three shooters.

794
00:33:13,305 --> 00:33:14,966
We have witnesses who saw six.

795
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:16,963
I'm saying there was only three.

796
00:33:17,534 --> 00:33:19,534
And you stop looking for any others.

797
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:28,098
We're not gonna do any better.

798
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:29,116
Three murders walk free?

799
00:33:29,117 --> 00:33:29,864
And three don't.

800
00:33:29,865 --> 00:33:30,976
It closes this case.

801
00:33:31,054 --> 00:33:33,276
It gives us a break
from more bloodshed.

802
00:33:38,094 --> 00:33:39,235
OK.

803
00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:41,988
Bring 'em in.

804
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:44,337
The others will find their way
into our net eventually.

805
00:33:50,953 --> 00:33:52,177
Santi: The place you tracked me down,

806
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:53,455
put the gun to my head.

807
00:33:53,677 --> 00:33:55,177
Lose the salvadorans there.

808
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:57,852
We'll teach them how
to use a machete.

809
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:03,864
Hiatt: You want to get
some backup on this?

810
00:34:03,955 --> 00:34:05,501
I mean, what if Santi's setting us up?

811
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,054
His three shooters could be ten.

812
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:08,988
Nah, nah. This is a straight-up deal.

813
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,117
He wants us off the scent

814
00:34:10,118 --> 00:34:11,678
of whatever the byz lats have brewing.

815
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,679
Giving up these idiots is a bargain.

816
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:27,720
You're not gonna believe this.

817
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:35,013
Hiatt: What? What is it?

818
00:34:39,805 --> 00:34:40,860
Spin them this way.

819
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:41,806
We'll go in the side door.

820
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:42,807
Let's go.

821
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:52,438
- Show me your hands!
- Police!

822
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:54,121
Vic: Get against the wall right now!

823
00:34:54,122 --> 00:34:55,063
Against the wall!

824
00:34:55,064 --> 00:34:55,790
Get down!

825
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:58,205
Show me your hands!
On your head!

826
00:34:59,023 --> 00:35:00,023
Don't you move!

827
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:01,769
All aboard.

828
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,237
Black Mercedes is in the garage.

829
00:35:08,585 --> 00:35:09,585
Ready?

830
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:11,647
Don't move!

831
00:35:11,648 --> 00:35:12,523
Hands on your head!

832
00:35:12,646 --> 00:35:13,701
Hands on your head!

833
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:16,833
Turn around.

834
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,460
Eduardo Romero?

835
00:35:22,898 --> 00:35:23,898
Si.

836
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:26,902
I'm glad we found the rest of you.

837
00:35:28,074 --> 00:35:29,696
Billings: It's OK. We're the police.

838
00:35:29,697 --> 00:35:30,697
All right. Leave.

839
00:35:31,136 --> 00:35:33,448
Uh, we need to ask you
a few questions first.

840
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:35,322
Like what happened to
the other half of your arm?

841
00:35:35,323 --> 00:35:36,949
Eduardo: I'm a mexican official.

842
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,061
Diplomatic immunity.

843
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:39,573
And I told you to leave.

844
00:35:39,574 --> 00:35:41,407
We need to get you to a hospital.

845
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:45,074
Dutch.

846
00:35:49,324 --> 00:35:51,268
You ever heard of traveler's checks?

847
00:35:53,322 --> 00:35:55,099
The consulate office is furious.

848
00:35:55,451 --> 00:35:57,228
Claim Romero explicitly told you

849
00:35:57,385 --> 00:35:58,513
not to bring him down here.

850
00:35:58,514 --> 00:35:59,637
Brought him in for his own good.

851
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:00,451
Protective custody.

852
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:01,882
They chopped the guy's arm off.

853
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:03,753
Diplomatic immunity, Dutch.

854
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:05,759
International protocol.

855
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,199
This guy lost his arm
at a grisly crime scene.

856
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,136
He had a suitcase full
of unexplained cash.

857
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:13,067
He was present at
the San Marcos murders.

858
00:36:13,386 --> 00:36:15,069
Mexican consulate's gonna
be here in five minutes.

859
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,637
We're never gonna see this guy again.

860
00:36:16,638 --> 00:36:18,249
How we supposed to stop that?

861
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,513
Romero held onto that cash

862
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,125
like it was his missing hand.

863
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,450
Going home without it
is not an option.

864
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,451
We want him to stick around,

865
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:28,887
we make sure his $230,000
luggage gets lost.

866
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:32,163
That amount of money is booked.

867
00:36:32,164 --> 00:36:34,897
Technically, we should notify
and send to narcotics.

868
00:36:35,354 --> 00:36:37,909
35% of bills test positive
for drug residue...

869
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,417
A lot of bills, a lot of testing.

870
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:42,584
Could be tied up
in the system a while.

871
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:45,292
I'll expect a lot of angry
calls from diplomats...

872
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:46,404
Mexican and our own.

873
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,791
But maybe Romero hangs
around L.A. long enough

874
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:51,180
for us to get into him
and crack this case.

875
00:36:55,231 --> 00:36:57,041
Get that suitcase
out of here before his

876
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:59,486
"get out of the country"
free card shows up.

877
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:03,481
Vic: Open it.

878
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:05,258
Your bail came through.

879
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:07,627
Let's go.

880
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:12,755
These are the shotgun mexis

881
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:14,575
broke up your little street fair today.

882
00:37:14,576 --> 00:37:18,795
Too bad you can't hang around for a
little while and get better acquainted.

883
00:37:19,942 --> 00:37:20,942
Get out.

884
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:23,641
Get out.

885
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:35,826
OK, we kept our end of the deal,
delivered the shooters.

886
00:37:35,827 --> 00:37:37,549
Let's hope Hernan can keep his.

887
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:38,643
He will.

888
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:40,141
We stopped the blood...

889
00:37:40,142 --> 00:37:41,142
For now.

890
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,523
Thanks again for the toys.

891
00:37:50,705 --> 00:37:51,705
You're welcome.

892
00:37:53,455 --> 00:37:55,510
I'm sorry if I said too much earlier.

893
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:56,705
I got a lot on my mind...

894
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:57,890
Listen, it's no problem.

895
00:37:57,892 --> 00:37:59,502
I've been there myself, so...

896
00:38:02,892 --> 00:38:05,144
Some thing happened
between Vic and Shane,

897
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:07,311
some kind of rift,
and it's pretty bad.

898
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:09,830
I don't get involved
in Vic's business.

899
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,719
Well, I get involved with Shane's.

900
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:14,140
We're still married,
and I'm worried about him.

901
00:38:14,364 --> 00:38:16,807
Maybe you should talk to
your children's father.

902
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:19,499
What, you think Vic's
gonna do something to him?

903
00:38:20,394 --> 00:38:22,205
Tell Vic we don't want any trouble.

904
00:38:22,206 --> 00:38:23,372
He can get hurt, too.

905
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:24,888
What?

906
00:38:24,907 --> 00:38:27,795
He has just as much to lose
as we do, if not more.

907
00:38:28,017 --> 00:38:30,017
What the hell are
you talking about?

908
00:38:30,332 --> 00:38:31,719
Just tell him, OK?

909
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,483
Hey.

910
00:38:43,892 --> 00:38:45,058
Number one?
How much?

911
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,514
All of it.

912
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:48,705
I need to see your supply invoices.

913
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:50,103
My gasoline is legal, man.

914
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:51,708
I'm the one with a badge, Abdul.

915
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:53,707
I'll decide whether it's legal or not.

916
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,910
Well, you can't just order
me to show information.

917
00:38:55,984 --> 00:38:57,199
You need a warrant.

918
00:38:57,707 --> 00:38:59,457
You might want to have a
better look at that badge.

919
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:01,735
That gives me the right
to your receipts.

920
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:04,959
I'm a citizen, man.

921
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:06,512
Yeah.

922
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:07,701
Not in my world.

923
00:39:18,264 --> 00:39:19,221
You can't... Aagh!

924
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:25,014
I see here you got a shipment
coming tonight from Nawzad oil.

925
00:39:25,015 --> 00:39:26,953
Maybe they're on the
homeland security watch.

926
00:39:26,954 --> 00:39:28,690
You're gonna refuse
that shipment.

927
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:29,700
That's bullshit, man.

928
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,812
I need the gasoline.

929
00:39:31,044 --> 00:39:31,890
Don't worry.

930
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:33,325
Another supplier will be here tomorrow

931
00:39:33,326 --> 00:39:34,514
to fill up all your tanks.

932
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:35,515
What supplier?

933
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:38,806
I'm not sure, but I'm guessing
it ends in I-A-N.

934
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:40,704
The armenians?

935
00:39:41,202 --> 00:39:42,155
They put you up to this?

936
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:44,883
Nobody puts me up to anything.

937
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:46,845
I'm just a guy

938
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:49,934
looking out for the best
interests of his country.

939
00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:52,780
I'll be back tonight

940
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,336
to check on your patriotism.

941
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:10,828
Vic: Where's Hernan?

942
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:13,722
He called me. He's 20 minutes late.

943
00:40:13,903 --> 00:40:15,592
I know. We lost contact with him.

944
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:16,593
What's that mean?

945
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,403
Any way you guys could have
compromised his cover?

946
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:20,855
No. No.

947
00:40:20,856 --> 00:40:21,939
You saw our operation.

948
00:40:21,968 --> 00:40:24,190
It was strictly on
a need-to-know basis.

949
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:26,842
Shit.

950
00:40:44,731 --> 00:40:45,731
Claudette Wyms.

951
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,031
Captain at the barn.

952
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:50,358
I uh...

953
00:40:50,606 --> 00:40:52,544
Found this buried
under the paperwork

954
00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:54,100
when I moved into my office.

955
00:40:55,232 --> 00:40:57,419
It was taken from Ben when
he was being processed.

956
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,142
Never made its way back to you.

957
00:41:02,731 --> 00:41:06,008
And you thought now would be
the right time to return them?

958
00:41:07,669 --> 00:41:08,669
No.

959
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:11,802
You seemed upset at the barn today.

960
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,364
Wondering if I could help.

961
00:41:15,108 --> 00:41:16,108
It's nothing.

962
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,477
It's taken care of.

963
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:22,115
I have two girls.

964
00:41:22,735 --> 00:41:23,735
A little older...

965
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:25,158
Same age difference.

966
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:27,977
Can't find a picture of
my ex anywhere either.

967
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,475
Guess we know how to pick 'em, right?

968
00:41:31,672 --> 00:41:32,783
Mine had his demons.

969
00:41:33,984 --> 00:41:34,982
He was shot in the head

970
00:41:34,983 --> 00:41:36,045
in the front seat of the car

971
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:37,990
with my oldest sitting next to him.

972
00:41:38,734 --> 00:41:40,234
How they dealing with that?

973
00:41:42,063 --> 00:41:43,461
I don't know. Seem OK.

974
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:46,374
Never know what's going
on in their heads.

975
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,860
Yeah, they don't tell you anything.

976
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:52,410
Well, after a while, you stop asking.

977
00:41:52,793 --> 00:41:53,793
Good night.

978
00:41:55,668 --> 00:41:57,001
You ever blame yourself?

979
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:00,549
Putting them through all that shit?

980
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:03,467
Not any more.

981
00:42:05,216 --> 00:42:06,216
Good for you.

982
00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:09,255
You need my help, you call me.

983
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,090
A few weeks ago...

984
00:42:14,277 --> 00:42:16,610
Vic wanted to know
how Ben got ahold of...

985
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:18,200
Cash down in Mexico.

986
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:22,200
You wired him the money
when he was on the run?

987
00:42:22,464 --> 00:42:24,027
That would be aiding and abetting.

988
00:42:24,028 --> 00:42:25,972
Tough choice for a wife and mother.

989
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:29,526
Vendrell came by today.

990
00:42:29,527 --> 00:42:31,249
He wanted the same information.

991
00:42:31,778 --> 00:42:32,944
He was all jacked up.

992
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:34,779
I just don't want
Vic and his guys...

993
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,668
I won't let them hurt you in this.

994
00:42:44,466 --> 00:42:45,577
Danny: 1-Tango-13.

995
00:42:45,578 --> 00:42:47,851
I have a white male possible D.B.

996
00:42:48,281 --> 00:42:49,486
Requesting an R.A. unit.

997
00:42:49,487 --> 00:42:50,487
Hanlon: Jesus!

998
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,041
Thinking premium or regular unleaded?

999
00:43:08,202 --> 00:43:10,023
Don't come to this house again.

1000
00:43:11,737 --> 00:43:12,549
Keeping the widow warm

1001
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,925
since the old man's been gone?

1002
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:15,759
You've destroyed enough families.

1003
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:17,214
You leave hers alone.

1004
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:22,174
Don't worry.

1005
00:43:22,675 --> 00:43:25,230
It's not like it's a
live grenade or anything.

1006
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:28,627
It's Gilroy's mexican information.

1007
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:31,051
Good luck on the goat farm.

1008
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:34,842
I hear the Juarez P.D. is looking for
a few good hombres.

1009
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:36,377
Think if I was gonna run,

1010
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,710
I'd set up the same
deal we had for Lem?

1011
00:43:39,302 --> 00:43:41,302
The one you knew all the details to?

1012
00:43:41,426 --> 00:43:42,426
Come on, Vic.

1013
00:43:42,925 --> 00:43:44,647
You taught me better than that.

1014
00:43:45,175 --> 00:43:48,615
I knew if I cranked up Nancy's motor,
it would get you here...

1015
00:43:48,616 --> 00:43:49,727
On neutral ground...

1016
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:53,750
So that I cold give you this.

1017
00:43:56,954 --> 00:43:57,954
What is it?

1018
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,190
The original is in a warm, safe place.

1019
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,513
Now, anything happens to me...

1020
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:04,820
or my wife...

1021
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,293
or my son...

1022
00:44:06,827 --> 00:44:08,538
Even my mail man, anybody,

1023
00:44:09,127 --> 00:44:10,378
that I am close to...

1024
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:13,581
that lands on I.A.D.'s doorstep.

1025
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:19,764
Just imagine every wrong,
brutal thing we have ever done.

1026
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,274
It's hard to do, isn't it?

1027
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:24,748
We've done so many.
