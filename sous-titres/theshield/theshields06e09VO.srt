1
00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:01,701
<i>Previously on "The Shield"...</i>

2
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:03,383
How's the quick-mealer business going?

3
00:00:03,483 --> 00:00:04,584
The machines are still here,
which means

4
00:00:04,684 --> 00:00:06,495
you're still ling your pocket
on the department's dime.

5
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:08,196
You wanna keep the machines, go ahead.

6
00:00:08,296 --> 00:00:10,291
Why, so you can still have it to
hang over my head?

7
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:12,685
- Yeah, that's right.
- My detective found 12 bodies

8
00:00:12,785 --> 00:00:14,695
hacked to pieces.
Well, 11 bodies, one arm.

9
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:17,503
The killers were salvadoran.
The victims were all mexicans.

10
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:19,722
- Eduardo Romero?
- Glad we found the rest of you.

11
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:22,078
I'm a mexican official.
Diplomatic immunity.

12
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:24,676
He was present at the
San Marcos murders.

13
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:28,611
We want him to stick around, we make
sure his $230,000 luggage gets lost.

14
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:31,728
- For the exploratory committee.
- It's only for 100,000.

15
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:33,980
You'll get the other half
when the people responsible

16
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,215
for the San Marcos killings
are brought to justice.

17
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:38,262
There's an operative
inside the salvadorans

18
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:40,565
who can help solve the
San Marcos house murders.

19
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,419
Mexicans got something big brewing.
Salvadorans want a piece of it.

20
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:46,563
Chopping up the bodies, San Marcos
was all about sending a message.

21
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:49,876
You know who the salvadorans were who
were swinging the machetes at San Marcos?

22
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:51,916
It'd be the death of
my cover if I started asking.

23
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:53,926
- Did you talk to Shane?
- He killed Lem.

24
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:56,360
I know what you did to Lem.
Like this journal.

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,801
Everything on paper that we have done,

26
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,177
and you're trying to blackmail
us and that is no deal?

27
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:02,539
Tell Kesakian I got a
business proposition for him.

28
00:01:02,644 --> 00:01:04,027
I'm a cop he's gonna need to know.

29
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:07,184
- I'm an associate. Ellis Rezian.
- Kasakian's insulated.

30
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:09,805
Been a while since we had a
good relationship with law enforcement.

31
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:11,750
- That's funny. I'm a fixer.
- I'm Kesakian.

32
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,746
Ok, I need to speak to
the real Kesakian.

33
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:14,856
My father's out of town.

34
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:16,628
How long do you think
you can keep this a secret?

35
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:18,221
Long enough for a miracle.

36
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:20,091
In the meantime, you think
you're running the show?

37
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:23,111
It's only a matter of time before Rezian
finds out your father's out of the game.

38
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:25,346
He's gonna come after you
with everything he's got.

39
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:28,707
My father still has a lot of men
loyal to him, and now I have you.

40
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:31,127
Claudette's been playing you
since the day I showed up.

41
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:34,151
She figured you'd be easier to handle
if you thought there was a future here,

42
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,762
meanwhile orchestrating things
so there won't be.

43
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:39,400
- You caught the man that killed Emily?
- Yeah.

44
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,996
Do you know what your daughter was doing
to get her drugs?

45
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:44,467
- That's not how history has to read.
- Thank you.

46
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:47,467
I've got an appeals hearing
in a couple of weeks.

47
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:49,733
They're gonna decide whether
to force me out or not.

48
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,326
I'll see what I can do.

49
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,073
You're gonna have
to fire your secretary.

50
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,211
I don't think she's giving
you all your messages.

51
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:07,249
Look, I still need to reach a few more
people before I know where you stand.

52
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:10,842
I told you where I stand. They're
kicking me to the curb next week.

53
00:02:10,942 --> 00:02:14,192
The question is, how you gonna
stop it like you promised?

54
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:16,267
It's not as manageable as I thought.

55
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:19,222
You mean, not as manageable as keeping
your daughter's drugging and whoring

56
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:21,842
out of the press after her death? Huh?

57
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:25,625
Look, I am doing all I can,
detective Mackey, but

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,032
I keep slamming up against
your enemies in the department.

59
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:31,871
We had a deal:
your daughter's reputation for my job.

60
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,191
Get back to me tomorrow.

61
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,675
- What do you want?
- An update on the San Marcos murders.

62
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:47,264
Who are you?

63
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:50,392
Cruz Pezuela. He's representing a
local development company

64
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:54,288
that has the backing of various
mexican investment interests.

65
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:56,249
What's that got to do with San Marcos?

66
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:59,585
The San Marcos slaughter angered
a lot of people here and in Mexico.

67
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:01,582
Yeah, we weren't exactly
thrilled about it.

68
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,658
Did you follow up on the
salvadoran gang lead we gave you?

69
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:06,563
Yeah. Can't rule them out.

70
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:09,200
Well, Cruz has brought me another lead,
and I want you two to look into it.

71
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,936
Go through the captain. She's the
only one that gives us marching orders.

72
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:14,157
It's a suspect, Javier Rincon,

73
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:16,685
a salvadoran gang member
who's in county jail right now.

74
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:18,841
- Who's your source?
- Doesn't want to be involved.

75
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:23,441
What is it with you people? We got a guy
who got his arm chopped off at San Marcos

76
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,909
hiding out at the mexican consulate.
Now your source wants to hide behind you?

77
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:29,456
The community either wants us
to solve this crime or it doesn't.

78
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:31,577
- We do.
- Rincon's in county?

79
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:34,652
Well, if he was spouting his
mouth off about San Marcos,

80
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:37,002
trust me, I would have heard about it.

81
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:40,474
I don't remember you two
being on the schedule.

82
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:46,386
Cesar Orozco. He's my source.
Works construction for my company.

83
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:48,852
My office will give you
the site location.

84
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:51,058
Now you can do something.

85
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,982
Aceveda and his amigo had another tip
about San Marcos. Sounds like bullshit.

86
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:03,931
Yeah, but at least it's
specific bullshit.

87
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:06,861
If it's easy to comfirm or
knock down, do it,

88
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:10,518
but no more secret powwows
with them and without me.

89
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:14,741
Ronnie'll find out if Rincon has
any priors. I'll find out about Orozco.

90
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,799
We've been operating on a favor
to favor basis. What you're asking,

91
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,379
this is taking me deeper into the
belly of the armenian beast

92
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,474
- than I ever intended.
- I'll pay you more.

93
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:30,318
This isn't a charge by the hour.
I'd need a percentage.

94
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:33,221
You'll be my partner in this country.

95
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:36,015
Your apartment ain't safe anymore.
Next few days,

96
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:38,432
- I want you to check into a motel.
- They wouldn't dare to hurt me.

97
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:40,514
- They know what my father would do.
- Don't be so confident that

98
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,565
your father's condition
is such a secret.

99
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:46,457
Gangs know, and rumors have
a way of turning to fact.

100
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:48,092
I will find a motel.

101
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:50,947
You can't assassinate your way into
filling daddy's shoes, either.

102
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:53,951
Soldiers see too many heads roll,
they get nervous.

103
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:56,699
But I need a demonstration
of my power, yes?

104
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:59,009
Money's the blood of
these organizations,

105
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:01,394
and whoever's supplying it is the heart.

106
00:05:01,987 --> 00:05:04,652
Now who's putting the most cash
into the peasants' pockets?

107
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:09,113
Rezian. He runs the ports.
Importing of all kinds.

108
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:11,202
It's over 40% of my father's business.

109
00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:13,916
Well, he's the one who's gonna
be looking to take over.

110
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:15,591
He's a threat.

111
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:19,779
You willing to take a short term
hit for a long term gain?

112
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,166
I've ready to save what my father built.

113
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,443
Rincon's serving 6 months
on an ag assault.

114
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,564
They let him out 3 days
ago after a month.

115
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:31,755
- They threw the case out?
- Too many shitheads, not enough pillows.

116
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:34,078
The only thing distracting them is P.O.

117
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,714
My revue panel's next week.

118
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,277
- Any last minute advice?
- Just tell your story.

119
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:45,773
- So what do you think my chances are?
- I've learned not to bet against you.

120
00:05:45,873 --> 00:05:47,916
Even if it's a sure thing?

121
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:53,459
It fixed. Panel's already
decided I'm out.

122
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,453
Hiatt doesn't know all the facts.
He should have kept his mouth shut.

123
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:09,096
You're not even gonna
give me a fair shot?

124
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:12,427
You threw away your fair shot by
taking so many crooked ones.

125
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:15,877
You've got a week.
I need every man on deck.

126
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:19,056
If you're not up to it, you don't
have to wait for the panel.

127
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:25,684
Your quarterly stats are due next week.

128
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,425
I'm gonna solve San Marcos

129
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:30,036
and get you that numbers bump
you need to save this place.

130
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,058
And then you just try to sit
in front of that panel

131
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,232
and tell 'em you don't need
me around here.

134
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:47,519
What were you inside for, Cesar?

135
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:49,167
I hit my wife or something.
That's what she said.

136
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:51,897
Relax, man, we don't care about
how you keep your lady in line.

137
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:53,434
Just tell us about Rincon.

138
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:56,257
I heard him bragging, you know?
San Marcos or something,

139
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:58,008
- so I tried to listen.
- You're mexican.

140
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:00,602
How'd you get close enough to
the salvadorans to hear all that?

141
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:02,733
We both worked in the cafeteria.

142
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,602
I heard Rincon tell the other guy

143
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:06,598
that he hacked them up while
they were still alive.

144
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:10,049
- Him and 2 other guys.
- Rincon say why he killed 'em?

145
00:07:11,026 --> 00:07:14,548
- I gotta go.
- Hey, you go when I say you go.

146
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,466
Look, just answer his questions.
You'll get back to your job a lot sooner.

147
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:20,988
- Man, I told senor Pezuela everything.
- What's Pezuela's interest in this?

148
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:23,241
How's a guy like you even get
face time with him?

149
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:26,213
Everybody knows that he wants the
salvadorans who did the San Marcos.

150
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,773
- Yeah, but why?
- You could have told the mexicans inside.

151
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:30,383
You know they would've
taken care of Rincon.

152
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,017
I was the only one to get close to him.

153
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,147
If I would have said something,
they would have had me do the murder.

154
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,916
- You were scared?
- Yeah.

155
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:38,442
It's not like he's your
old lady or nothing.

156
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:44,630
This is Garine Essagian. She keeps the
books at this armenian bakery I go to.

157
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,560
Come here. There's nothing
to be afraid of.

158
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:51,068
My boss has started me on
working his other business.

159
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:53,747
I noticed something wrong
when I was going through, um,

160
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,413
- how you say?
- Uh, inventory.

161
00:07:56,513 --> 00:07:59,827
- The inventory.
- Her boss is a guy named Rezian.

162
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:04,328
The bakery is a cover
for his extensive import business.

163
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:06,793
Would you mind stepping out a minute?

164
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:08,991
Detective Vendrell will
be right with you.

165
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:13,250
Just take a seat right over there.

166
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,787
Does she have any idea what her boss
would do if he knew she was even in here?

167
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:20,358
Rezian is the armenian
heavy down at the ports.

168
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,355
His people rubber stamp the
inspection process.

169
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:24,958
This guy's got an open door to get
whatever he wants into this country.

170
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:27,420
Why do I get the feeling
you're trying to find your own thing,

171
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,395
Distance yourself from Vic?

172
00:08:29,512 --> 00:08:33,201
She's got the books going back 2 years.
You wanna get a warrant or not?

173
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:37,776
- Solving San Marcos is top priority.
- We don't jump, she could lose her nerve,

174
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,040
and there's plenty of
bodies to go around.

175
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,506
If Hiatt agrees and the team
can handle it, then I'm ok with it.

176
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:47,183
But I don't want to find
her chopped off feet

177
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:49,193
on my desk tomorrow morning.
Yes, ma'am.

178
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:55,016
- Hey, where are we with Rincon?
- Left his parole officer 2 messages.

179
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:57,037
- You wanna hit some salvadoran hot spots?
- No.

180
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,814
If he knows we're looking, he'll turtle.
Let's wait for the P.O.

181
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,546
The feds have been trying
to wrest control of the ports

182
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:03,102
away from the armenians for years.

183
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:05,538
We can do it in a day.
Bust this Rezian.

184
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:07,840
Cut off the armenians
stronghold on the docks.

185
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,639
- What's Rezian running?
- Drugs, girls, lately gasoline.

186
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:14,536
Stolen, uninspected, untaxed.

187
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:16,923
Shane's got some solid intel
on this guy named Rezian.

188
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,829
I brought in this girl who can help
us cut off the armenians at the knees.

189
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:21,608
Can we save the wild stabs in the dark

190
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,477
until after we've caught the
machete wielding psychos?

191
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:26,644
No reason we can't do both.

192
00:09:27,762 --> 00:09:30,823
Julian, go with Shane.
The rest of us stay on San Marcos.

193
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:35,539
Ronnie here would raise a
lot fewer eyebrows in little Armenia.

194
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,756
All right. Make me proud.

195
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,225
Shane's up to something,
and I want to know what.

196
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:46,506
That would've been a great case
for Julian to cut his teeth on.

197
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:48,219
You let Vic make you
doubt your instincts.

198
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:51,759
I'm not so insecure that I
can't take good advice, all right?

199
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,799
You know what happens
if Vic wins that appeals hearing?

200
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:58,272
He waits about 2 seconds to reclaim his
throne, gets you bounced out of here.

201
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:00,275
I'm just saying.

202
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,932
Oh, excuse me.

203
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:10,697
You helping out detective Vendrell?

204
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,243
- Yes.
- That's good, huh?

205
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:19,342
Vic Mackey.
How do you know Shane?

206
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,309
He likes the bakery where I work.

207
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,815
Hey, I need your help.

208
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,161
My armenian's not what it should be.

209
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,331
Pleasure.

210
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:31,985
Pleasure.

211
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,900
Shane definitely knows this girl.

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,032
Well, he wouldn't mess with
the armenians out of school.

213
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:49,255
- Not with our history.
- How can you be so sure?

214
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:51,560
I never thought Shane would
dig himself in such a hole

215
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,309
with Antwon Mitchell to
become his bitch, but he did.

216
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:58,373
Keep an eye on him.
Find out what he's into

217
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:00,271
and whether it can blow back on us.

218
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:12,090
Sounds like it's coming from the back.

219
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,595
Yeah. We need Rincon to give up
the other killers, so follow my lead.

220
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:22,624
Police.

221
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,762
We need to talk to Javier Rincon.

222
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:28,236
Just need to chat him up.

223
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:31,008
His P.O. Said we could find him here.
Just take a second.

224
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:34,104
- What do you want?
- Javier, can you step out front

225
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:36,799
- so we can talk to you, please?
- I'm not leaving, man.

226
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:37,984
They released me early.

227
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:40,940
- I got papers and everything.
- We know you're free and clear.

228
00:11:41,057 --> 00:11:42,782
Then talk to my ass.

229
00:11:44,107 --> 00:11:46,958
Bring it out the front
and shoot the shit.

230
00:11:58,163 --> 00:11:59,677
Vic. Vic!

231
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:06,920
Back it up, man.

232
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:15,372
Now, you can come on your own, or I can
drag you through you friends' blood.

233
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:19,991
You killed 12 people.
Now the mexicans want you dead.

234
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:23,486
We turn you over to them right now, maybe
we stop a gang war. Save a lot of lives.

235
00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:25,932
- I didn't kill nobody.
- Your choice.

236
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:29,539
We could drop you off right now
and you get what you deserve,

237
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,723
or you give us the other killers,

238
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:35,166
- I fix it so you walk away.
- You won't do it.

239
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:38,970
Take us to Byz Lat hood. Let the
mexicans get the answers out of him.

240
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,905
- That what you want?
- He made his choice.

241
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,451
No. Back to the barn. Now.

242
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:57,276
Throw this asshole in the cage.

243
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:00,979
- What the hell was that?
- I was about to ask you the same thing.

244
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,786
Well, I was gonna get the names of the
other 2 killers until you shit all over it.

245
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:06,100
This thing is too important to
play fast and loose.

246
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,917
Yeah? Well, I hope you have
another plan.

247
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:10,760
'cause these salvans don't give up their
own unless it's to save their own skins.

248
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,065
We can't use a coerced confession.

249
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:14,853
- Who's gonna say it was coerced?
- You know what?

250
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:17,062
Some of us are gonna be
here long than a week.

251
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:19,770
Let's get a little sneak peek
at what that's gonna look like.

252
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,109
You can handle the interrogation.

253
00:13:28,144 --> 00:13:30,009
I'll call you later, hon.

254
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:32,861
Who are you?

255
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:34,996
- We're the police.
- You got a warrant?

256
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:37,251
We prefer good old
fashioned cooperation.

257
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:38,419
I don't.

258
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:42,532
A guy named Rezian, what do you
see in every one of those ships

259
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:44,636
that's been through here
in the last week?

260
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:48,261
We got cameras.
You touch me,

261
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,829
and I'll sue the city for that
house I've been wanting in Oxnard.

262
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:52,633
That's the way to dream big.

263
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,237
We know you're on Rezian's payroll.

264
00:13:54,337 --> 00:13:56,724
He tells you which cargo
is safe for inspection.

265
00:13:56,824 --> 00:13:58,482
You let the rest slide in
under the radar.

266
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:01,164
For all we know, you're rubber
stamping the import of nuclear bombs.

267
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:03,722
I got a pal, homeland security.

268
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:07,364
His favorite hobby is pulling
the patriot act out of his ass.

269
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:10,926
Or... we could get what we need
another way and just tell the armenians

270
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:13,581
- it came from you.
- Now, that's just plain mean.

271
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:20,800
Rezian's got a ship coming in every day.
They usually unload around 3:00.

272
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,609
Great. That gives us the afternoon

273
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,205
to hear everything you know
about the armenians.

274
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:27,000
Waste of time. They're not gonna
let this pissant into the loop.

275
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,742
Come on. Let's go.

276
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:34,777
You breath a word about this to Rezian,
I'll find you...

277
00:14:34,877 --> 00:14:36,997
Somewhere without a camera.

278
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,624
This is your last chance to save
yourself. You give me names,

279
00:14:44,724 --> 00:14:47,445
I recommend to the judge
you do your time in a safe place.

280
00:14:47,545 --> 00:14:49,531
- A safe place?
- Yeah.

281
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:01,111
He won't give up the others. We're gonna
have to find some other leverage.

282
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:02,756
One killer's a start.

283
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:04,847
Will the construction worker
Orozco testify?

284
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,618
- I think so, yes.
- That's a mistake.

285
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:07,765
Why's that?

286
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,319
The kind of guys who'll chop up
a house full of people?

287
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:11,949
I hate to think what they'd do next

288
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:14,750
- or who they'd be doing it for.
- What are you talking about?

289
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:18,177
Remember the one-armed man
with the suitcase full of cash?

290
00:15:18,277 --> 00:15:20,338
First the mexican government
sent him his I.D.

291
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:23,451
Then Pezuela shows up with
his arm up Aceveda's ass,

292
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:24,799
getting tips from prison,

293
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,568
representing a company
with the backing of mexican interests?

294
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:29,084
Now there's a conspiracy?

295
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:31,820
Solving these 12 murders
is as big as I need now.

296
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,249
Then let me get Rincon to talk.

297
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:38,059
But if you'd rather walk
away with half a win

298
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,369
and the other killers free to do it
again, you stick with your boy here.

299
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:52,874
I can't drop you off in Byzland,

300
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:55,448
but word that you're the killer is gonna
hit the mexican side of the street,

301
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:56,824
if it hasn't already.

302
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,431
Means I need my own people
to keep my back.

303
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:03,305
Unless I can convince Santi and the rest
of the mexicans that you didn't do it.

304
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:05,883
It takes your price off the street.

305
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:07,565
You give us the other killers
that we need,

306
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:10,488
you can start scheduling your
next welcome home party.

307
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:13,029
- You can convince the wetbacks?
- Count on it.

308
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:16,194
- I gotta hear with my own ears.
- No problem.

309
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:21,883
Japanese american male.
Single hit to the head. Bruised chin.

310
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:24,519
Bit of a scuffle, but he didn't
put up much of a fight.

311
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:26,272
Looks like Dorothy was
an internet cruiser.

312
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:28,390
Maybe he invited the wrong
person over for a quickie.

313
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,213
Ladies and gents, we've got
ourselves a homicide.

314
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:34,408
- No sign of forced entry.
- Yeah, not in the apartment, anyway.

315
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,191
- Uh, what about a murder weapon?
- We've been all through the place.

316
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,660
The guy actually filled out his
emergency contact information.

317
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,897
- His parents live in Eagle Rock.
- I hate notifications.

318
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:47,038
- Steve can do it.
- Oh, no. No way.

319
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:49,775
The folks probably didn't even
know junior switched sides.

320
00:16:49,956 --> 00:16:52,795
I'm really gonna miss that quick-mealer.

321
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:54,552
Fine.

322
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,434
Can I have that?

323
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:02,963
Ma-san balled all over me.

324
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,850
I put an internet profile on your desk.
You should read it.

325
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,208
Have you ever seen a japanese lady wail?

326
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:10,974
- Somebody had to do it.
- Danny or Tina.

327
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:13,839
I'm not gonna let you rule my life
over this vending machine thing.

328
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,247
Sure you are. Read the profile.

329
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:21,187
"Mason Heller. Film nut. Good guy looking
for someone looking for something real."

330
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:24,272
Our suspect. Called the victim
6 times in the last 8 days,

331
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:27,724
Final time last night at 10:00.
M.E. puts tentative T.O.D. at 11:00.

332
00:17:27,824 --> 00:17:30,097
Here he is, even as we speak.

333
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:35,531
Hey, I tried that restaurant
you recommended.

334
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:37,513
- Best spring rolls in L.A., right?
- Yeah.

335
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:39,158
Anyway, thanks for the tip.

336
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,320
Guess whose apartment is 2 blocks
away from where the victim lives.

337
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,052
I thought we'd head back to the scene,
see if Mason dropped the murder weapon

338
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:46,710
- on the way home.
- Good thinking.

339
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:53,419
Is this a friday? It feels like
a wednesday.

340
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,164
Yeah, day after thursday, which relates
to you bashing your lover's face in how?

341
00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:00,783
Tell me about Alan.

342
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:05,968
- I really should go.
- Well, you're not under arrest.

343
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:10,733
But if you do try to leave, we will file
charges and detain you officially.

344
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:12,413
What happened to your hand?

345
00:18:12,513 --> 00:18:14,827
Maybe you cut it flattening
a guy's skull.

346
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:18,666
Mason? Mason?

347
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:21,724
- I know this is hard.
- Oh, come on.

348
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:24,299
This is the male version
of the same old pathetic story.

349
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:28,020
Guy gets the hots bad for a nice piece
of ass and he can't deal with rejection.

350
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,146
You wanna be pissed at me, get even,

351
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:39,430
- don't do it in there.
- Aw, come on. It's not my fault

352
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,932
the guy's got one foot in
the psych ward.

353
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:43,647
He's just fragile. And since
psychological complexity

354
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,898
isn't exactly your
strong suit, back off.

355
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:49,871
Do you got any crisp singles?

356
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:53,654
I wanna get a cup of soup out of one of
your machines while they're still there.

357
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:04,204
Have to be getting close.

358
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:10,196
It cost me 60 bucks to fill my truck.

359
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,659
Of course, Mara insists on full serve.

360
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:18,152
You want to chat up a buddy,
go find one.

361
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:27,891
That's Rezian. This is it.

362
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:42,849
- So do I need to watch my back?
- Do I?

363
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:48,494
- Hey, police! Let's go!
- Down on your knees!

364
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:50,794
On your knees. On your knees.

365
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:52,976
Drop that money! Drop that money!

366
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,160
You're under arrest
for the importing of illegal goods.

367
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,095
You mention one word about how I helped
you out with that gas station owner

368
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:03,107
- and I'll up the charge to murder.
- You make big mistake.

369
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,097
- I'll call for transport.
- Yeah.

370
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:07,386
My people won't let you
get away with this.

371
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:10,953
You don't have people.
Kesakian junior's in charge now,

372
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:12,803
so your crew ain't happening.

373
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:16,562
You keep causing trouble, we'll just
suffocate you on your own gonads.

374
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,647
Was Alan thinking about filing
a restraining order?

375
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:25,562
Ok. Thanks for your help.
Welcome back.

376
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:27,519
- Wish we had better news.
- No murder weapon?

377
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:31,457
No. Walked it 5 different ways. Looked
under every bush, hit every trash can.

378
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:34,311
Wait a minute. You got these 2 beautiful
women looking in trash cans?

379
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:37,421
- it's part of the job, right?
- Ha ha ha ha.

380
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,275
- Garbage pickup's tomorrow afternoon.
- Ok.

381
00:20:42,577 --> 00:20:44,278
- Hey, my man.
- Hey.

382
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:47,160
You are my hero.

383
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,163
Oh, yeah?

384
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,618
Why's that?

385
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:52,283
Hanlon.

386
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:57,122
Oh, I'm sorry. I just assumed, the way
she talks about you. Never mind.

387
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,603
I don't make a habit of banging chicks
that know where to find me in the morning.

388
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:02,797
So the dutchman has a shot then?

389
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:05,630
- Dutch?
- Sure.

390
00:21:05,735 --> 00:21:09,125
You get her fires all stoked,
heat's gotta go somewhere, right?

391
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,665
He's been working that caring mentor
angle like there's no tomorrow.

392
00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:14,269
Uh-huh.

393
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,618
You lost, my friend.

394
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:22,160
Dutchy bailed out on me.
What happened to you?

395
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,837
Look, I told you I'd make another deal

396
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:26,174
and give you the guys who
did San Marcos, and I will.

397
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:29,394
No more deal. We can take care of
the San Marcos business ourselves.

398
00:21:29,494 --> 00:21:31,661
- Rincon didn't do it.
- That's not what we hear.

399
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:35,261
He's a poser. She shot off his
mouth for juice inside.

400
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,821
He didn't kill those people or
he'd be sitting here right now

401
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,693
- courtesy of me.
- Why should I believe you?

402
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:41,891
'cause I'm trying to
prevent more bloodshed.

403
00:21:42,254 --> 00:21:45,069
And I'd glad give up the assholes
who hacked up those people to do it.

404
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:48,054
I have a lead about the real killers.

405
00:21:48,154 --> 00:21:51,274
You sit tight for a day,
forget about Rincon,

406
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,832
and you'll get your justice.

407
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:56,843
One day.

408
00:21:57,028 --> 00:22:00,442
After that, somebody's gonna pay.
I don't give a shit who.

409
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:03,172
Feel safer now?

410
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:08,409
Vic get the names of his accomplices?

411
00:22:08,972 --> 00:22:10,040
Yeah.

412
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:15,497
- These names better check out.
- They will.

413
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:18,274
- So when do I get out of here?
- Answers first.

414
00:22:18,741 --> 00:22:20,884
How'd you kill those
people at San Marcos?

415
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:23,609
Something big's coming up.
I didn't get too much details.

416
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:27,172
All I know is we were cut out by the
mexicans and people are pissed off.

417
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:28,949
Who ordered you to do it?

418
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:31,595
Guardo.
He said we were sending a message.

419
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:34,060
Kill everybody in the house
jungle style.

420
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,431
There's a dude by the name of Romero.
We were supposed to leave him alive.

421
00:22:37,531 --> 00:22:39,575
So you just cut off his arm.

422
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:41,743
Know a guy named Cruz Pezuela?

423
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:43,213
Nah. Don't know him.

424
00:22:43,313 --> 00:22:46,210
Ok. Stay put. It's gonna take a
while to get you sprung.

425
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,511
How'd it go with Shane?

426
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:51,363
Well, he wasn't too subtle
about not wanting me to dig

427
00:22:51,463 --> 00:22:53,016
deeper into the armenians.

428
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:56,962
What happens when we
don't give Santi his revenge?

429
00:22:57,062 --> 00:22:58,613
Hell breaks loose,

430
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:01,819
unless we can find a way to make
Claudette and the mexicans happy.

431
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,142
Here he is.

432
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:13,605
Rincon punked us.
Our guy wasn't where he said he...

433
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:17,714
Second guy was a no-show, too,
but Ronnie sweet talked the sister.

434
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,732
They're both getting sloshed
at a bar up the street.

435
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,433
- Let's go catch us some killers.
- I'll call for backup.

436
00:23:26,732 --> 00:23:29,524
Police! Everybody stay
right where you are.

437
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:37,386
You. Take your glasses off.

438
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:48,209
Damn! Not such a sweet
talker after all, huh?

439
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:01,995
Hey. What happened to
staying at the motel?

440
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:09,241
I need a few things for my father. I was
gonna go in only for a minute, but...

441
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:11,616
The door. I felt someone inside.

442
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,874
Did you see anything?
Did you hear anything?

443
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:16,532
Just the feeling.
You think I'm paranoid?

444
00:24:16,632 --> 00:24:20,016
You'd be stupid not to be.
I'll be right back, ok?

445
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:53,675
Hey! Police! Stay where you are!

446
00:24:53,775 --> 00:24:55,571
Stay where you are right now!

447
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,325
Come here.

448
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:00,804
Let me tell you something.

449
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,063
Rezian's behind bars,

450
00:25:02,163 --> 00:25:04,852
so the port business and the dreams
that go with it went bye-bye.

451
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:07,576
The only way you're gonna earn is to
fall in line with Kesakian's daughter.

452
00:25:07,676 --> 00:25:08,999
She's in charge now.

453
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:10,396
Spread the word.

454
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,378
They know about my father.

455
00:25:30,503 --> 00:25:32,596
They wouldn't dare to do this otherwise.

456
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:34,880
I busted Rezian accepting
an illegal shipment,

457
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,659
so his port business won't be
up and running any time soon.

458
00:25:38,766 --> 00:25:41,284
Then these men need to understand
that they need me.

459
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:42,196
Yeah.

460
00:25:42,296 --> 00:25:44,363
Rezian's gonna come back
kicking and screaming,

461
00:25:44,463 --> 00:25:47,530
so we need to find a way to
keep him behind bars for the long haul.

462
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,405
He has a warrant, or the books.

463
00:25:49,505 --> 00:25:52,581
Yeah, and a star witness who's
not who she says she is.

464
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:53,969
Don't worry.

465
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:56,368
This is where I start earning my keep.

466
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:15,935
Get up.

467
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:41,430
- Rincon being innocent is bullshit.
- You lied to me?

468
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,970
Only way I could get him to give
up these 2 assholes.

469
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,963
The good news is after 18 months
of a long prosecution,

470
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:51,143
- you'll know exactly where to find him.
- Him later. I'll take what you got now.

471
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:28,117
What's the good word?

472
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:32,576
Don't tell me you haven't reached
the right people yet.

473
00:27:33,524 --> 00:27:35,449
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

474
00:27:35,824 --> 00:27:38,296
I tried, but it's not possible.

475
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:40,768
- Try harder.
- No.

476
00:27:44,174 --> 00:27:46,709
Well, I guess it's time the world knew

477
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:49,149
who your daughter really was.

478
00:27:49,552 --> 00:27:53,276
You won't do that. You won't say anything
because you want to still keep your job.

479
00:27:54,226 --> 00:27:56,186
You change your story now,
it'll reveal

480
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:59,467
how you manipulated the circumstances
of my daughter's case,

481
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:02,666
- you'll expose yourself as unethical.
- Ha ha ha ha.

482
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:04,452
I've been accused of worse.

483
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:07,639
No. This time you're gonna verify
it with your own words.

484
00:28:09,747 --> 00:28:13,612
Look, I tried to keep up my
part of the deal, but

485
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:17,472
you've built a mountain of bad
will too high to climb.

486
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:21,399
Good luck, detective.

487
00:28:31,883 --> 00:28:34,730
Wilshire division found 2 bodies
in an alley off Pico.

488
00:28:34,883 --> 00:28:38,075
Well, at least Santi remembered
where to dump 'em.

489
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,642
Wilshire sent over the pictures.

490
00:28:42,742 --> 00:28:45,388
- They our 2 missing killers?
- Well, what's left of them.

491
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:48,031
Their wallets were found in a
trash can down an alley.

492
00:28:48,131 --> 00:28:50,259
Our poking around must
have flushed 'em out.

493
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,793
I would have preferred them back
here alive and talking.

494
00:28:52,893 --> 00:28:55,721
Wilshire's homicide rate
just went up by 2,

495
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,530
but you still have one live murderer

496
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,975
to trot in front of the cameras
right here in Farmington.

497
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:04,164
San Marcos is officially closed.
Thank you.

498
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:06,590
Well, we got the guys who
wielded the machetes,

499
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,085
but not the guys who ordered it.

500
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:12,233
You need me, I'll be digging into how
Aceveda's lap dog fits into this puzzle.

501
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:18,559
It's just a matter of time before we
find the murder weapon, Mason.

502
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:20,022
I can't tell you anything.

503
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:22,932
You won't. There's a fairly
significant difference.

504
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:24,661
It's not a crime to like someone.

505
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:26,988
It is if they don't like you
back and you kill 'em.

506
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:31,035
Did Alan say he didn't want
to see you anymore?

507
00:29:32,944 --> 00:29:34,211
Alan...

508
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:38,499
Mason, here's what we're dealing with.

509
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,681
There are several people who
say you were hounding him.

510
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:42,418
That's supported by the phone records.

511
00:29:42,518 --> 00:29:44,911
There was no forced entry, so
we know he knew his attacker,

512
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:48,346
and you called him an
hour before he died.

513
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:53,046
Now, if you could give us an alibi,
but you don't seem to have one.

514
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,562
I can't tell you anything.

515
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:00,098
Please. I can't.

516
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:03,361
- Why doesn't he ask for a lawyer?
- What's the point?

517
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:05,742
Then why hasn't he confessed?

518
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:10,024
Well, you're the theorizer.
You ask.

519
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,578
Sucks about Sofer not letting
you take a run at her killer.

520
00:30:16,162 --> 00:30:19,291
- What do you mean?
- Oh, I shouldn't have said anything.

521
00:30:19,804 --> 00:30:21,615
We were gonna bring
you into interrogation,

522
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:23,243
give you a chance to show your stuff,

523
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:25,875
but she wouldn't have it.
Said you didn't have the skills.

524
00:30:26,344 --> 00:30:27,465
Really?

525
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:29,637
I guess it's understandable.

526
00:30:29,737 --> 00:30:31,514
- Understandable?
- Well, sure. I mean,

527
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:33,693
obviously she's making a play for Hiatt.

528
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:36,625
Him thinking you're a screwup
just makes you less of a threat.

529
00:30:37,105 --> 00:30:40,610
Sort of petty, but that poor guy
can't take his eyes off you,

530
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:42,612
so what else is she gonna do?

531
00:30:44,032 --> 00:30:46,426
You think Kevin's into me?

532
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:50,021
- I know he's definitely not into her.
- Oh, I don't know.

533
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:52,622
I've seen 'em cozy a couple times.

534
00:30:53,462 --> 00:30:55,383
Look, I'm gonna stay out of it.

535
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:59,000
So please, don't say anything to Danny
'cause she'll know it was me.

536
00:30:59,184 --> 00:31:00,326
Sure.

537
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:06,725
You're safe here.

538
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,985
Just gonna make sure that Rezian
understood his end of our conversation.

539
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:11,862
Then we'll get you out of here.

540
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,989
Turns out no Garine Essagian works
at Rezian's bakery.

541
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,863
But the nice lady on the phone told me

542
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,074
that Kesakian's daughter Diro helps out
with the books from time to time.

543
00:31:30,123 --> 00:31:32,861
Sounds like Shane made a big bust today.

544
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:35,740
On behalf of the department, thank you.

545
00:31:36,414 --> 00:31:38,336
- I'm glad I could help.
- So...

546
00:31:38,436 --> 00:31:42,735
- what brings you to the United States?
- Opportunity. The weather.

547
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,987
Your father?

548
00:31:47,118 --> 00:31:50,517
I hear Kesakian's in the hospital.
I'm sorry.

549
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,097
My father's a noble man.

550
00:31:52,197 --> 00:31:55,237
He's also the leader of a
bunch of brutal yahoos.

551
00:31:55,952 --> 00:31:58,812
- Now, where do you fit into that?
- My father is a businessman.

552
00:31:58,912 --> 00:32:01,444
I just translate, keep the books.

553
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,932
The real ones or the fake ones?

554
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:10,468
Look, you seem like a very nice girl.

555
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,679
I'm sure your intentions are good.

556
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,678
Then why are we having
this conversation?

557
00:32:14,778 --> 00:32:17,107
Because you need a friend
in this department.

558
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,559
Someone besides Shane Vendrell.

559
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:22,391
You ever heard of Antwon Mitchell?

560
00:32:23,513 --> 00:32:26,141
He was the leader of a black
gang called the one-niners.

561
00:32:26,266 --> 00:32:28,426
Shane and he did some
business last year.

562
00:32:28,535 --> 00:32:29,966
Some heat came down

563
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:32,483
and an innocent 14-year-old
girl got killed.

564
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:35,534
Now Mitchell's spending the rest
of his life behind bars.

565
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,312
That has nothing to do with anything.

566
00:32:38,412 --> 00:32:42,837
Shane's still under investigation, and
so is everyone he comes in contact with.

567
00:32:43,286 --> 00:32:46,712
I don't know what kind of arrangement
you two have between you if any,

568
00:32:46,947 --> 00:32:48,464
but just know...

569
00:32:49,222 --> 00:32:50,958
When the chips fall,

570
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:55,325
they always land on Shane's side of the
table. You need anything, Diro,

571
00:32:55,425 --> 00:32:56,478
you call me.

572
00:33:07,774 --> 00:33:09,464
Hey! Hey!

573
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:12,486
- Hey, where you going?
- This is not going to work.

574
00:33:12,586 --> 00:33:14,966
- That cop knows what's going on.
- Who?

575
00:33:15,217 --> 00:33:17,188
Detective Mackey.

576
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:19,927
Hey, listen to me. Listen to me.

577
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:23,103
Look, whatever he told you
was a fishing expedition.

578
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:26,274
- He doesn't know anything.
- He knew my name, who my father is.

579
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,245
I can control him.

580
00:33:28,345 --> 00:33:31,167
I'll see you get compensation for today,
and I thank you.

581
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,463
But we cannot be partners.
I have to be careful.

582
00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:36,752
- Hey, listen to me...
- Do not bother me again.

583
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:43,272
Hey! What the hell did you
say to my C.I.?

584
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:46,661
Who, Garine Essagian?

585
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:50,246
Told her to stay the hell away
from you, same as I would any girl.

586
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:51,897
She didn't concern you.

587
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:54,071
If she's putting money in
your pocket, she does.

588
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:56,465
You don't get to profit off this place.
Not anymore.

589
00:33:56,565 --> 00:34:00,142
We don't need you dragging us into
yet another Vendrell shitpile special.

590
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:02,934
You stay out of my way.

591
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:05,969
- This'll all go a lot smoother.
- I'm not looking for smooth.

592
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:08,449
I'm looking to make you as
miserable as I possibly can.

593
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:09,598
Oh, you gotta try harder.

594
00:34:09,698 --> 00:34:11,871
I've been working for you
so long, I got a high tolerance.

595
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:14,196
Whatever you got going on
with this broad, it ends now.

596
00:34:14,296 --> 00:34:16,964
I want you out of Farmington and
away from everyone in it.

597
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:18,784
What are we, 5 days and
counting till that appeals panel

598
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:20,678
shoves your badge up your ass?

599
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:24,092
- Tells you to find greener pastures?
- I'm not gong anywhere.

600
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,603
There's no trap door this time, Vic.

601
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:30,919
- They got you boxed in.
- Stay away from the Kesakians.

602
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:34,648
I'll stop by and say hi when you
start your security job in Northridge.

603
00:34:34,748 --> 00:34:37,335
Meantime, I'm pulling my
request for a transfer.

604
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,053
You're leaving,

605
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:40,855
so I may as well stay.

606
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:54,145
A man brought this in. Said he found it
in the bed of his pickup,

607
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,467
which was parked a block from Alan's
house last night.

608
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,436
But you already knew that.

609
00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:03,727
We take this down to the lab, it's gonna
come back with your fingerprints on it.

610
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:05,975
- It's just a matter of time.
- My time.

611
00:35:06,393 --> 00:35:09,428
- You said that before.
- Why don't you tell us what happened.

612
00:35:09,678 --> 00:35:13,292
Judge are always more inclined to
be lenient after you've confessed.

613
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:21,320
- You ever heard of progeria?
- It's a kind of disease, right?

614
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:24,042
Only 40 kids in the world have it.

615
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,071
I knew one,

616
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:29,451
Johnny Wilcox.
He was cool.

617
00:35:30,577 --> 00:35:34,254
Yeah, you get old really fast.
You shrivel up. Get arthritis.

618
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,896
He died when we were 12.

619
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,244
Massive heart attack.

620
00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:46,202
Everyone thinks they have more time.

621
00:35:46,302 --> 00:35:49,253
I saw Johnny when they took him
out of his house after he died.

622
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:50,476
Just a...

623
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:53,303
tiny little bump under a sheet.

624
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:56,881
Do you want to see Alan's body?
We could take you down there.

625
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,683
No. I just...

626
00:36:00,403 --> 00:36:02,139
I want to stay here.

627
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:06,911
A good margarita on the rocks with salt.

628
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:10,067
- None of that blended shit.
- Jack. Neat.

629
00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:11,902
Ice is for pussies.

630
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:14,427
Now a bad day, that's a vodka Martini.

631
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:16,994
Who says all cops are alcoholics, huh?

632
00:36:19,106 --> 00:36:21,547
- And then there are days like this.
- So what's it gonna be?

633
00:36:22,074 --> 00:36:24,311
Definitely a 3 Martini night.

634
00:36:27,274 --> 00:36:29,511
Hey, get me out of here.

635
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:32,139
The deal was 2 for 1. Alive.

636
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,812
Guess the mexicans screwed you by
getting to 'em first. Tough luck.

637
00:36:47,045 --> 00:36:48,766
Glad you came up for air.

638
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:51,618
Just in time to I.D. the
San Marcos suspect.

639
00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:55,079
He'll cooperate as soon as all
his property is returned to him.

640
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,981
Oh, you mean the briefcase
with the 200 grand inside?

641
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:59,889
I forgot to ask what all
that money was for.

642
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:01,442
And he never has to answer that.

643
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:04,979
Somebody chopped my arm off, getting
paid would be the last thing on my mind.

644
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:06,722
Well, when you've lived
through that experience,

645
00:37:06,822 --> 00:37:08,400
we'll be interested in your comments.

646
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,201
How do we expedite the
return of the money?

647
00:37:13,653 --> 00:37:17,408
Silent types always made me curious,
so I did a little homework.

648
00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:20,721
I understand you went to college
with Cruz Pezuela.

649
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,850
The guy hangs with an interesting crowd,

650
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,479
everything from government
officials to mexican cons.

651
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:28,095
- What's that have to do with my client?
- I don't know yet...

652
00:37:29,383 --> 00:37:31,073
But I'm gonna find out.

653
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:32,778
Let's go.

654
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:36,890
You might have heard I'm out of here.

655
00:37:38,986 --> 00:37:41,614
They say I got 5 days left,

656
00:37:41,907 --> 00:37:45,239
and I'm gonna use every second of 'em
to find out what's going on here.

657
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:48,572
Why those people died and you didn't,
where that money was going,

658
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,056
and what Pezuela's angle
is in all of this.

659
00:38:01,674 --> 00:38:03,505
Your suspect still here?

660
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:05,023
He never asked to leave.

661
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:07,647
He wants to sit in interrogation
all night, let him.

662
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:09,775
Any fingerprints come back
on the statue?

663
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:12,747
Uh, tomorrow morning.

664
00:38:14,151 --> 00:38:17,139
- You look tired. You should go.
- If only.

665
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:31,635
What do I have to do?

666
00:38:32,307 --> 00:38:35,139
- Change is hard for everybody.
- You still need me.

667
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:38,378
- Hiatt, he's not gonna get it done.
- He'll have his chance.

668
00:38:38,478 --> 00:38:42,019
What, like today?
He's a sheep, not a shepherd.

669
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:44,252
You pushed him too fast.

670
00:38:44,377 --> 00:38:47,100
I solved this thing before the
quarterly stats were due.

671
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,018
You gonna tell me that saving this place
doesn't earn me a spot here?

672
00:38:50,118 --> 00:38:53,338
Nothing that happened today is gonna
change what I have to say to the panel.

673
00:38:53,557 --> 00:38:54,902
Forget the panel.

674
00:38:55,227 --> 00:38:57,923
You've gotta give me more time
to get into the San Marcos thing,

675
00:38:58,023 --> 00:38:59,326
Pezuela's place in it.

676
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:02,752
We have 3 murders whose
only link was to Guardo.

677
00:39:02,893 --> 00:39:04,990
He's either missing or dead.

678
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,815
You're done.

679
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:12,751
- I can get to the truth of this thing.
- Maybe, but we'll never know.

680
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:15,301
Because it's somebody else's job now.

681
00:39:26,923 --> 00:39:29,703
I'm going after Pezuela.
I'm gonna dig up all the dirt

682
00:39:29,803 --> 00:39:32,164
you two have been playing in,
and I'm gonna bring both of you down.

683
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:36,066
You use your last few hours
here any way you want to, detective.

684
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,586
I'll bet at the end of it all,
I'm gonna find out

685
00:39:38,686 --> 00:39:40,968
that it was you who gave
up Hernan's cover, too.

686
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:43,580
- Who's Hernan?
- Undercover I.C.E. Agent.

687
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,458
Infiltrated the salvadorans.

688
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:48,288
He was on the verge of
giving us the San Marcos intel

689
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,896
when word leaked that
the salvadorans had a mole.

690
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:53,550
Did you tell your good buddy Cruz
about the undercover agent

691
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,671
- working the salvadorans?
- No.

692
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:56,872
Sure you did.

693
00:39:57,174 --> 00:39:59,036
All I have to do is prove it.

694
00:40:55,607 --> 00:40:57,015
Good morning.

695
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:58,845
How you doing?

696
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:02,153
Never better. Actually, a little busy.

697
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:07,505
So I've been doing some research,
and it turns out there's a lot of people

698
00:41:07,605 --> 00:41:09,809
that are looking to hire former cops.

699
00:41:09,914 --> 00:41:13,481
You could be an investigator
for a law firm or a P.I.

700
00:41:14,169 --> 00:41:16,751
I know it's not what you want,
but you'd be good at it.

701
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,188
You could take care of the kids.

702
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:22,411
- Thanks for pulling this together.
- No problem.

703
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:25,092
Uh...

704
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,476
I'm sorry...

705
00:41:28,711 --> 00:41:31,246
About everything that's happened.

706
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,792
I can't believe it.

707
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:45,903
We have a problem.

708
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:47,872
what's that?

709
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,756
I heard the cop who solved
the murders is being forced out.

710
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:53,080
Mackey? That's been a long time coming.

711
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:55,599
- Can we do anything about it?
- No. That's done.

712
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:58,329
Well, wouldn't it make more sense
for the community to

713
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:00,752
keep good cops who share our interests?

714
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:03,123
- That's not gonna happen.
- I'd like you to reconsider.

715
00:42:03,223 --> 00:42:05,004
There are plenty of
good cops in Farmington,

716
00:42:05,113 --> 00:42:07,303
- despite your experience.
- Not like him.

717
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,881
The department will be better off
without him and so will the community.

718
00:42:11,022 --> 00:42:12,806
You just have to trust me on that.

719
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:18,466
The rest of what I promised for
your exploratory committee.

720
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:23,754
I might take a few days to cash it.

721
00:42:33,414 --> 00:42:36,700
If you don't confess, we're gonna
arrest you solely on the evidence.

722
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:38,734
You're going to jail.

723
00:42:39,214 --> 00:42:42,077
It really is just a matter of time.

724
00:42:49,724 --> 00:42:51,476
Sometimes I think if you

725
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:54,011
don't admit it to yourself,
to me,

726
00:42:55,524 --> 00:42:58,058
what's gonna happen isn't gonna happen.
But...

727
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,219
some things are just inevitable

728
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:04,594
once certain forces are set in motion.

729
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,487
Can't change it back.

730
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:09,679
Yeah. It's done.

731
00:43:16,304 --> 00:43:19,402
If I tell you how it happened,
how sorry I am,

732
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:22,077
and that all I wanted...

733
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:24,174
was to love him...

734
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,071
And be loved back,

735
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:31,858
can I stay here a while longer?

736
00:43:33,031 --> 00:43:35,706
Sure. Until we need the room.

737
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:38,810
The second I leave here,
my life is over.

738
00:43:41,591 --> 00:43:43,108
Eat your breakfast.

739
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,276
- I told you, stay away.
- Just give me a minute.

740
00:43:55,913 --> 00:43:56,805
Ok?

741
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:00,576
You checked out of the motel.

742
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:03,231
They found out about
my father's illness.

743
00:44:03,356 --> 00:44:05,953
- They will come again. I won't hide.
- I'll protect you.

744
00:44:06,814 --> 00:44:08,175
I already have.

745
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:11,503
Is that what your friend
Antwon Mitchell thought?

746
00:44:12,176 --> 00:44:13,350
Antwon.

747
00:44:13,756 --> 00:44:15,149
Is that what Vic told you?

748
00:44:16,698 --> 00:44:18,168
He told me many things.

749
00:44:19,045 --> 00:44:20,813
That a little girl got killed,

750
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:22,800
that you are being investigated.

751
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,646
Well, that's a crock of shit.

752
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:27,259
Vic's been on I.A.D.'s radar for years.

753
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:29,449
He's being swept out as we speak.

754
00:44:30,463 --> 00:44:32,450
And that little girl was not my fault.

755
00:44:32,935 --> 00:44:35,970
- He has no reason to lie to me.
- He has every reason to lie to you.

756
00:44:36,158 --> 00:44:37,128
He does.

757
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,689
What'd he do, give you
a shoulder to cry on?

758
00:44:39,798 --> 00:44:41,488
Offer to lend a helping hand?

759
00:44:41,644 --> 00:44:42,939
He'll be reaching into your pocketbook

760
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:45,039
- by next week.
- Like you?

761
00:44:46,303 --> 00:44:49,323
- I need to be alone. Now please go.
- No.

762
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:51,216
You're gonna believe me first.

763
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,778
- I'm better off on my own.
- You're gonna get killed without me.

764
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:56,781
Look...

765
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:58,877
I saved your life yesterday.

766
00:44:59,081 --> 00:45:00,551
I took down Rezian.

767
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:03,376
I got him out of the way so that you
could assume the throne. That was me.

768
00:45:03,476 --> 00:45:04,928
I'll pay you more.

769
00:45:05,408 --> 00:45:08,897
Look, I risked my ass for you.
My job.

770
00:45:09,445 --> 00:45:12,777
- Now, that's not how this shit works.
- I'm sorry.

771
00:45:13,012 --> 00:45:15,485
Good-bye!
Go. I mean it. Go!

772
00:45:15,585 --> 00:45:17,874
Listen to me. Vic stole
from your father.

773
00:45:18,297 --> 00:45:19,830
The armenian money train?

774
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:22,372
Got robbed a few years back?
A few guys got killed?

775
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:24,253
The money was never found?

776
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:27,178
That was Vic. Him and his guys.

777
00:45:28,586 --> 00:45:30,339
And he asked me to be a part of it.

778
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:33,370
When I said no, I became a threat.

779
00:45:36,354 --> 00:45:39,545
Vic's had a bull's-eye on
my back ever since.

780
00:45:43,437 --> 00:45:47,161
My father lost 6 months
of profit in that.

781
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:51,736
Well, I guess you've had a
much better understanding

782
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:53,978
of your father's dealings
than you told me.

783
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,813
Well, that's it. Full disclosure.
Both of us.

784
00:46:00,566 --> 00:46:02,428
Now whose side do you want to be on?

785
00:46:03,711 --> 00:46:06,652
- I'm gonna have to deal with him, too.
- Who, Vic?

786
00:46:07,403 --> 00:46:09,891
- Wait a second. I didn't tell you that...
- But you have told me,

787
00:46:09,997 --> 00:46:13,423
and you were right before.
I must finish the job.

788
00:46:13,673 --> 00:46:15,316
There is no middle ground.

789
00:46:22,248 --> 00:46:24,469
The mayor come crying back
to you already?

790
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:26,269
That happened faster
than I thought it would.

791
00:46:27,066 --> 00:46:30,962
- Congratulations on solving the murders.
- Thank you, but I'm not finished.

792
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:34,825
- Couldn't have done it without my tip.
- Or at least not as fast.

793
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,335
Stop turning over rocks.

794
00:46:36,435 --> 00:46:38,834
Not until I find out what's
crawling underneath.

795
00:46:40,763 --> 00:46:44,988
Yeah, I was just telling Aceveda
how much this city needs cops like you.

796
00:46:45,312 --> 00:46:47,206
He doesn't see it that way.

797
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:49,505
- Not yet.
- Not ever.

798
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:57,365
Yeah, you can keep wasting my time.
I'm gonna have plenty of it.

799
00:46:58,384 --> 00:46:59,886
I can get you your job back.

800
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:03,293
I had a city controller trying to
save my job, and he owed me.

801
00:47:03,393 --> 00:47:06,707
He has 10 times the juice you have
and he got nothing done.

802
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,513
He has 10 times the juice,

803
00:47:09,732 --> 00:47:11,703
but I have one more picture.

804
00:47:25,578 --> 00:47:27,236
That's Aceveda.

805
00:47:28,175 --> 00:47:29,630
Where did you get this?

806
00:47:30,987 --> 00:47:32,567
When was it taken?

807
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,570
Gun to his head.

808
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:38,857
Rather than stand up like a man
to his attackers, he gets on his knees

809
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:41,299
and takes a man's dick in his mouth.

810
00:47:43,756 --> 00:47:46,259
Don't think that'll play
too well with the voters.

811
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:49,685
Except maybe in West Hollywood.

812
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:53,389
Use it any way you want,
so long as it doesn't come back to me.

813
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,596
Save your job...

814
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:00,450
But stop digging.

815
00:48:00,872 --> 00:48:01,702
Right now.
