1
00:00:00,881 --> 00:00:02,353
Previously on "The Shield"...

2
00:00:02,388 --> 00:00:03,163
My here and now

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,223
is how to bring down
Pezuela in the 10 days

4
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:06,098
I still have a badge.

5
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,497
Pezuela is one of the biggest
contributors to my campaign.

6
00:00:08,532 --> 00:00:10,024
These files turned up
at my office.

7
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:12,510
I realized Pezuela
was using them

8
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,623
to blackmail
prominent citizens.

9
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:17,657
The Mexican drug cartel
is using Pezuela as a front.

10
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:19,545
This is an I.C.E.
Investigation now.

11
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,209
Chaffee's making
this case a priority.

12
00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:22,539
They need someone on the inside,

13
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:23,806
and that only means me.

14
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:24,743
Pezuela's guard's up.

15
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:27,249
That's why I have to give him
back the blackmail box.

16
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:30,442
I got a plan that'll give Lem
the justice he deserves.

17
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:31,871
Take a look around.

18
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,664
Vic and Ronnie
tried to kill me tonight.

19
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:34,873
They set me up.

20
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:37,114
They think I'm
too stupid to even realize it.

21
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:38,899
Now we have no idea
what Shane knows,

22
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:40,737
what he suspects,
or what he'll do.

23
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,454
I think he broke
my goddamn jaw!

24
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,495
Two-man snatched her
by the hair,

25
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,518
bashed her in the face.

26
00:00:47,553 --> 00:00:49,805
I knew I wasn't ever gonna
see that breezy again.

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,263
I arrest you
for murder,

28
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:52,455
but you
can work with me.

29
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,491
Work with you how?

30
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:54,751
I need your help
getting rid of somebody.

31
00:00:54,786 --> 00:00:56,590
That's gonna mean looking
somebody in the eye

32
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,774
and pulling
the trigger, though.

33
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:58,530
You ain't serious.

34
00:00:58,565 --> 00:01:00,789
You don't know how
goddamn serious I am.

35
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:11,667
www.1000fr.com presents...

36
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:00,615
I want to
play with that.

37
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,230
I know,
but not right now.

38
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:03,054
Why?

39
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,560
'Cause it's time
to go to bed.

40
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:06,895
No, uh,
keep him up, okay?

41
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,178
But it's late.
He's fussy.

42
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:09,718
Good, let's let
the whole block know

43
00:02:09,753 --> 00:02:11,334
that we're both at home,
dealing with a cranky kid.

44
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:12,486
Come on.

45
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:15,037
So, uh, run through
this with me.

46
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,764
In 30 minutes,
I go online.

47
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:20,260
I check the georgia
bulldogs score.

48
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:21,766
I keep checking
every 10 minutes.

49
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:22,637
I log in,

50
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:23,927
answer your E-mails...

51
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:25,271
you order the pizza at 11:00,

52
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:26,515
and you turn on the shower.

53
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,595
Delivery guy comes, and

54
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,179
I yell to you for some cash.

55
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:31,170
Make sure he sees this.

56
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:33,121
I know.

57
00:02:34,148 --> 00:02:34,893
Go.

58
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,041
Okay.

59
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:51,581
Not used to love letters
so late at night.

60
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:53,067
What's so urgent?

61
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:58,136
You think I'm wired?

62
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:01,433
We're more involved now.

63
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:03,053
Rules of engagement change.

64
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:04,093
Midnight texts,

65
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:05,940
chaperones, engagement...

66
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:07,739
sounds like
we're becoming an item.

67
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:10,589
I need you to put a drug dealer
out of business.

68
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,313
You came to the best.

69
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:21,843
This is your drug dealer?

70
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:23,741
Father morton
is letting gang members

71
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,887
deal heroin and cocaine
out of his mission

72
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,119
for a cut of the profits.

73
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:30,039
He another one of your
blackmail-box buddies?

74
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:31,413
What do you want me to do,
arrest him?

75
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:34,813
He submits his yearly fiscal
report to the diocese next week.

76
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:38,399
I want him to recommend
that they close St. Luke's.

77
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:46,674
This church is nearby
Pezuela-ville, isn't it?

78
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,432
Across the street
from our renewal project.

79
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,041
Yeah, you can't
get a liquor permit

80
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:53,104
if there's a church
within 1,000 feet.

81
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,151
Iooked like they were
gonna close last year,

82
00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:56,183
but they didn't.

83
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:57,846
So we need to
give them a little push.

84
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,213
Force his recommendation
for closure

85
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:02,233
by end of day tomorrow.

86
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,795
Pezuela wants to
close the church

87
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,923
to get his liquor permit.

88
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:14,199
How many commandments
does that violate?

89
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:15,858
He wasn't
his normal suave self.

90
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:17,905
He was kind of tweaked.
He had a bodyguard.

91
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,901
Things are heating up.

92
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:21,844
You've got federal approval
to play along.

93
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,283
Rattle the priest,
get him to agree.

94
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:24,942
It's the first step
in an extortion charge.

95
00:04:24,977 --> 00:04:26,493
I'll have to clear
the time with Wyms.

96
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:27,469
I already did...

97
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:29,844
told her I needed your
gang expertise for a day,

98
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,116
and she suggested
I take you for the week.

99
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:33,991
The love
just keeps coming.

100
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:37,894
About my expertise...

101
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:41,200
my hearing was yesterday.

102
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:42,984
I'm out in eight days.

103
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,135
I know.

104
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,511
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:47,424
What I've been doing
for I.c.E. Here...

106
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,414
I'd like it
to be a regular thing.

107
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:51,701
You're forgetting
I've read your file.

108
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:53,606
More importantly,
so has my boss.

109
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,816
Farmington's becoming
a cartel hot zone.

110
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:58,733
When word gets out
that I've crossed the line

111
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:00,508
and I'm working
rogue muscle for Pezuela,

112
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,651
it's gonna open
a lot of doors.

113
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:05,074
I need a soft landing,

114
00:05:05,109 --> 00:05:07,657
you need a pair of eyes
on the inside.

115
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,310
It's a win-win.

116
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:12,449
Not my call
to make, but...

117
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:13,798
I'll pass it
up the line.

118
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,736
In the meantime, follow through
with Pezuela's dirty deed.

119
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:21,971
Hey, uh...

120
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:25,050
you're not actually gonna let
Pezuela shut that church down.

121
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:27,754
We'll get to someone in the
diocese before that happens.

122
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:28,425
Well, good.

123
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,929
I wouldn't want to
piss off Jesus

124
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:32,020
on top of everyone else.

125
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,630
Cool car.

126
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:42,567
Thanks. So, how long
you been bartending?

127
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:43,316
Couple years.

128
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:44,356
But, uh,

129
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:46,974
I go to school days
to be a dental hygienist.

130
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:48,289
Really?

131
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:49,404
Good for you.

132
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:43,183
Yeah, Ronnie,
what's up?

133
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:47,238
Holy shit.
You get a look at the guy?

134
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:47,836
Black guy,

135
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:49,276
but his face was covered.

136
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:50,779
My date took
a frag in the arm.

137
00:06:50,814 --> 00:06:51,921
All right, man, don't worry.

138
00:06:51,956 --> 00:06:53,596
I'm coming.
I'm on the way.

139
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,258
Sync: Vine

140
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:23,608
Holy shit. Hope he had
the wrong address.

141
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,019
Glad I moved to the valley.

142
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:26,355
So much safer.

143
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:27,647
You feeling okay?

144
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:29,803
Don't talk to me,
shithead.

145
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:32,488
So much for your
bamboo-cage fantasy.

146
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:34,344
Claudette called north valley.

147
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,063
Barn's handling the case.

148
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:39,750
Jesus.

149
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:40,965
And you're in one piece?

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,381
What happened
to hanoi Hannah?

151
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,828
She caught a stray.

152
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:44,604
She'll live.

153
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,460
Not sure if I'm gonna get
date number two out of it.

154
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:48,012
Date number one
was ending up here?

155
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:49,235
I'll explain it
to you sometime.

156
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,200
We'll have corrections spit out
a list of recent parolees,

157
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:53,783
see if one of the names
don't jump out at you.

158
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:55,583
I could think
of a dozen dickheads

159
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:57,295
who'd try something
stupid like this.

160
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,046
Porch light bulb was unscrewed.

161
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:00,070
You see or hear anything?

162
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,597
Didn't see his face.

163
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:02,305
Black guy, though.

164
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,137
Saw his arms.

165
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:05,375
He was riding a motorcycle
and had a big gun.

166
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,895
That's all I know.

167
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,935
.357.

168
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,527
That's, like,
armor-piercing.

169
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:11,216
Somebody wanted you dead
two or three times.

170
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:12,614
There's only a few
places in town

171
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,126
you can get high-end lead
like this.

172
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,181
It's a place to start.

173
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:16,318
You okay, Ronnie?

174
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:17,661
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

175
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,360
Shonda here spotted
the motorcycle,

176
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:20,432
got a partial plate.

177
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,256
I don't really like to get
involved in messy shit,

178
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,830
but you helped my cousin out
with that thing,

179
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:25,548
so I figured it wouldn't
be right, not helping.

180
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,208
I appreciate it.

181
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:26,831
What'd you see?

182
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:28,655
The bike was black and red,

183
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,974
one of those fast asian models.

184
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,998
I got some of
the plate number.

185
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,347
Thank you very much.

186
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,767
Timing's kind of creepy,

187
00:08:33,802 --> 00:08:35,358
with all this shit going on
with Shane lately.

188
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:37,073
First thing
that crossed my mind.

189
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:39,325
We'll find the brother
on the other end of the gun,

190
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,168
squeeze the truth
out of him.

191
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:43,491
Hey, you want to
crash at my house?

192
00:08:43,526 --> 00:08:45,022
You got a bamboo cage?

193
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:46,620
For Christ's sake.

194
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:48,525
Oh, shit,
I got that I.c.E. Thing

195
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,717
first thing
tomorrow morning.

196
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:51,781
Olivia still got you
working a Pezuela angle?

197
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:53,381
Well, since Pezuela
squeezed her,

198
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,885
Olivia wants to nail
that asshole worse than I do.

199
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,036
But don't worry.
I'll cancel it.

200
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:59,187
No, no, that's gonna screw you
with setting up Pezuela.

201
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:00,474
Listen, stick with it.

202
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:01,763
I'll head back to the Barn,

203
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:03,552
start trying to find
this shithead myself.

204
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:05,152
I'm not gonna
sleep anyway...

205
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:07,296
not without
my asian throw pillow.

206
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:08,876
All right.

207
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:14,271
Partial plate provided
by our witness.

208
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:16,309
We've narrowed this down
to about 400 names.

209
00:09:16,344 --> 00:09:17,728
We just found a connection.

210
00:09:17,763 --> 00:09:18,990
Maceo padmore.

211
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,948
We know padmore
better as two-man.

212
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:25,590
Who's two-man?

213
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:28,143
Asshole we banged around
the other day,

214
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:30,701
trying to close that
farrah thing you stuck us to.

215
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,604
Any reason
he'd come after you?

216
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,942
Got a little physical
between us,

217
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:35,637
but nothing
more than usual.

218
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:37,228
How the hell did this guy
find my place?

219
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:39,292
Any moron with a laptop
and half a brain

220
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,947
can pay you
a visit these days.

221
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:42,186
We should return the favor.

222
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:44,347
You're already
detailed to I.c.E.

223
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:47,099
If I hear you flashing a badge
anywhere in Farmington today,

224
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:50,716
I'll have you chained to a desk
for the rest of your time here.

225
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:53,259
I want all eyes
looking for padmore.

226
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:54,980
Any information regarding him

227
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:57,319
or the attempted murder
of detective Gardocki,

228
00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:59,950
I want reported to detectives
Wagenbach and Billings.

229
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:02,287
- You're gonna be on desk duty today.
- No.

230
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:04,286
When you're a victim
of a crime, it's mandatory.

231
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:07,105
Well, Shane and Julien can hit
the streets on your behalf.

232
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:11,004
We got an address
on padmore.

233
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,523
Okay, notify SWAT.

234
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:14,899
I'll let the Chief know
you'll need a warrant a.s.a.p.

235
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,307
I would have parked Shane here, too,

236
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:17,334
but I need the manpower.

237
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:18,534
You keep an eye on him.

238
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:19,789
Understood.

239
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:22,911
Hey, I might be on loan-out
to I.c.E. Today,

240
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:24,975
but when you find out
where this padmore prick is,

241
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,672
I will be th...

242
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:28,590
I'll be there
in a heartbeat.

243
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,574
I know.

244
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:30,645
This is bullshit.

245
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,388
Everyone used to
fear this team.

246
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,900
Now word's hit the street
Vic's on the way out.

247
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,819
Suddenly, they think it's all
right to take a shot at us?

248
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:40,540
Now, we need to remind them
who we are,

249
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:42,684
put this asshole's dick
in the dirt.

250
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,763
We don't need to turn the heat
up any higher than it is.

251
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:46,851
This guy almost tried to kill
you over a bloody jaw, man.

252
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:49,546
He and everybody else got to know
that shit ain't gonna fly.

253
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:51,557
There'll be plenty of time
for payback for this dick

254
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:52,550
when we pinch him.

255
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,263
Well, if he happens to fall
in front of a moving bus,

256
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:56,859
consider it an accident.

257
00:10:58,607 --> 00:11:00,071
Let's go talk
to his girls for hire,

258
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:00,991
see where
he mattresses up.

259
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:04,368
Anything we find, man,
we'll let you know.

260
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:13,054
I suppose it's possible...

261
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:14,822
two-man got pissed,

262
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:18,765
- did this on his own.
- Possible.

263
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,976
I just can't figure out what
leverage

264
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,472
Shane might have had
to make him try it.

265
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:24,463
Neither can I.

266
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:25,622
Iook, maybe we're looking
for the devil

267
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:27,438
when he's not
really there.

268
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:28,401
Maybe.

269
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:31,786
It doesn't hurt for us to keep
our eyes open, though.

270
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:36,929
Iook, uh, this ho...

271
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,344
she's a little shy.

272
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:39,711
So let me start off
one-on-one.

273
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:42,263
We can go salt-and-pepper on her
if her tongue freezes up?

274
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:44,166
- Gotcha.
- Okay.

275
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:50,793
Hey, capuchina!

276
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:53,245
Capuchina?

277
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,021
I was plucking
for my next date.

278
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:56,795
Your eyebrows look fine.

279
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,050
I wasn't talking eyebrows.

280
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,321
Listen, I need your
help finding two-man

281
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:01,664
before he finds you.

282
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,526
You said you was gonna
keep my name out of it!

283
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:04,829
I held up my end.

284
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:07,208
Iook, it must have been
some perp in the cage

285
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:08,600
who saw you come in.

286
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,007
All I know is that word is out
that he's looking for you.

287
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:13,140
Shit.

288
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:14,126
Just tell me where
I can look for him.

289
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:15,510
You try talking
to white farrah?

290
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:17,190
She's so spun out
on crank,

291
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:18,925
she doesn't know whether to piss
standing up or sitting down.

292
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,694
Two-man knows
I ratted him out.

293
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:21,134
Listen to me.

294
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:23,168
Hey, listen to me.
Just listen, okay?

295
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:24,121
Listen to me.

296
00:12:24,156 --> 00:12:25,756
The best long-term solution

297
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:28,338
is we pretend
like we never even talked

298
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,268
and that you never pointed
a finger at two-man,

299
00:12:30,303 --> 00:12:33,958
even if some other cop
ever asks you, okay?

300
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:37,881
- Okay.
- Now, where do I find him?

301
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,767
He got peoples
around the way...

302
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:42,110
- cousin, I think.
- Okay, well, cousin's got a name.

303
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:43,942
So, what is it?

304
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:46,180
What is it?

305
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:49,937
Could have been me or you
getting shot at last night.

306
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,900
Could have beenyourwife
made a widow by this guy.

307
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:56,868
This guy, look, he deserves
whatever it is we give him.

308
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:58,107
That's not
for us to decide.

309
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,042
No, it's up to him.

310
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:00,161
But two-man's crazy.

311
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,456
He's big, too.

312
00:13:01,491 --> 00:13:04,049
He's got firepower,
so he's not gonna come easy.

313
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,388
Are you ready?

314
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:07,198
I got your back.

315
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,303
Okay, this guy almost
killed a cop last night,

316
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:10,591
so if he blinks,

317
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,541
let's not
let him get it right this time.

318
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:16,145
Hey! Hey!

319
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,061
It's the police!
Open this door!

320
00:13:19,786 --> 00:13:21,540
- What's going on?!
- Looking for two-man.

321
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:22,462
He's expecting us.

322
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:24,437
You ain't got no right
to come into my house!

323
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:25,195
And do what?
And look for a guy

324
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,676
who almost killed
a cop last night?

325
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:28,975
Get out!

326
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:31,001
- What are you doing?!
- Shut up!

327
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:33,901
Stop!
Let me see your hands!

328
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:34,812
All right,
all right, all right!

329
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,335
Let me see your hands!

330
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,757
Don't move!

331
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:39,635
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

332
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,096
Whoa, whoa, buddy!

333
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:40,943
It's not him.

334
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:42,050
That's not two-man.

335
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:43,402
I ain't two-man, man!

336
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:44,325
I ain't two-man.

337
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,089
Come on, man, chill!
Where's your cousin?

338
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:48,336
What?
I don't know.

339
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:49,660
Why are you sneaking
out the window, huh?

340
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,148
You got a message
to deliver?

341
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:52,271
No, man. Two-man...

342
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:53,239
he was here for a minute,

343
00:13:53,274 --> 00:13:55,207
but he took his stuff
and left, man.

344
00:13:55,242 --> 00:13:56,732
I'm serious.
I don't know nothing.

345
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:59,702
- How long ago?
- About an hour, man.

346
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:07,024
Father morton!

347
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:08,440
Detective Mackey.

348
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:10,007
I need to have a little
conversation with you

349
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,626
about some
of your altar boys.

350
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:14,749
They come here for
a hot meal and a place to sleep.

351
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:17,948
What they do on the street
is out of my hands.

352
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,515
Out of your hands
and into your pocket, right?

353
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:23,315
I know you've been
letting the E-park johnnies

354
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,307
deal out of your mission.

355
00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:26,354
And I also know
you're taking a cut.

356
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:29,497
No squad car and uniforms?

357
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:31,700
What's your play,
detective?

358
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:34,912
My play, padre, is to get you
to change your mission mission.

359
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,083
Your review with the pope
wannabes is next week.

360
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:40,796
You're gonna recommend that
they shut down St. Luke's.

361
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:42,588
Why would I do that?

362
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:44,460
Photographs
of you and damon leeks,

363
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:45,315
the head of the johnnies,

364
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,327
breaking bread,

365
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:48,455
bank statements
showing deposits

366
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,925
into your unauthorized
bank account.

367
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,950
This goes into the shredder

368
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:54,414
as soon as you help
close this place down.

369
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:55,526
I can't do that.

370
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,749
Hey, are you
not hearing me?

371
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:57,775
You're gonna lose that collar,

372
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,815
and I'm gonna gain one.

373
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,798
You're gonna do time
for this shit.

374
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,457
Well, you're gonna
have to arrest me,

375
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:04,684
because I can't
close the doors here.

376
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:19,035
Damon leeks!

377
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:22,720
Shit. Heard they retired
your cracker ass.

378
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,676
Ah, too young and pretty
to retire.

379
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:26,054
I made them shit-can me,

380
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:27,677
which means I only got another
eight days

381
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:30,097
to shit-can
maggots like you.

382
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:33,080
Oh, brother's all about
his thick.

383
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:34,857
Better go easy
on that juice, d.

384
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,511
Your brains turn into hot sauce,

385
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:38,806
shrinks the balls to raisins.

386
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:39,734
Ohh...

387
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:41,213
sorry, I'm too late.

388
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,181
My brain's fine-tuned,

389
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:45,525
and them balls
are the size of cat heads.

390
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,646
Seen your crew
around St. Luke's.

391
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,759
I know you're supplying
the transient crowd

392
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:52,237
with "h" and blow.

393
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:54,069
Just helping the destitute,

394
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:55,548
serving up holy gruel and shit.

395
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,188
Yeah, right.

396
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,499
I need to know how the priest
figures into all this.

397
00:15:58,534 --> 00:15:59,677
He taking a cut of the sales,

398
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:00,827
or are you just paying him rent?

399
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:04,337
He's our spiritual
counselor, man.

400
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:05,636
And I'm the counselor
who's about to

401
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:08,387
crush your heroin-selling
summer camp.

402
00:16:08,422 --> 00:16:09,923
Got nothing to crush.

403
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,603
Y'all got no evidence.

404
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,592
Ain't gonna put no homeless
junkie on the stand.

405
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:14,993
And the priest...

406
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:18,168
he bound by oath
to keep his mouth shut.

407
00:16:18,203 --> 00:16:19,599
Since when
are you a catholic?

408
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:23,139
Yo, since Jesus h. Christ.

409
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,069
I've seen
the preliminary results

410
00:16:28,104 --> 00:16:30,062
from your
exploratory committee...

411
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:31,845
very favorable.

412
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,180
Your years
as a police captain

413
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:35,516
give people a lot of confidence

414
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:36,535
in your ability to lead.

415
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,518
Research is young,

416
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,605
but indicators are promising.

417
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,002
District attorney lima
has also

418
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:45,503
launched an exploratory
committee.

419
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:48,908
Yes, I know.

420
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:50,611
Anita is very aggressive.

421
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:54,546
She's convinced she's going to
be I.a.'s first woman mayor.

422
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,291
Why don't you just say
what you want to say?

423
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:59,883
You're a man of vision.

424
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,538
I believeyouwill be
the city's next mayor.

425
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:03,833
I appreciate
the vote of confidence.

426
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:05,022
But you're green.

427
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:08,682
You lack influential support.

428
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:10,153
You'll need to
surround yourself

429
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:11,953
with people
who can shape that vision.

430
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:13,265
I want to be one
of those people.

431
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,696
Well, thanks for the offer.

432
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:16,168
I'll take it
under consideration.

433
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,680
I have
the influence and power

434
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:20,502
to make you
the next mayor of the city.

435
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:24,301
So, are you
guaranteeingme a win?

436
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:25,310
Yes.

437
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:29,585
I have leverage you couldn't
even begin to understand.

438
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:33,578
Working with me
is not a decision

439
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:35,757
that requires any thought.

440
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:38,635
It's a one-time offer.

441
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:41,519
Forgive me, father,

442
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:42,686
but you have sinned,

443
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:44,452
and I need
a goddamn confession.

444
00:17:44,487 --> 00:17:47,060
I am in the middle
of service. Get out!

445
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:50,243
But I got this question
gnawing at my soul...

446
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,392
why would a priest
protect drug dealers?

447
00:17:52,427 --> 00:17:54,927
So I went and visited
the little douche bags,

448
00:17:54,962 --> 00:17:56,806
and they're all cocky as hell,

449
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:58,395
secure in the knowledge

450
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,163
that their humble priest
won't rat 'em out.

451
00:18:01,198 --> 00:18:03,547
And I think, "wow.
"Whatever it is these bangers

452
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,254
have on the father
is much worse than

453
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,945
what I've laid at your feet."

454
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:12,219
Now, what would be worse
than a priest losing his collar

455
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:13,799
and going to jail?

456
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,762
And it hits me...

457
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:20,660
a priest going to jail
for molesting boys.

458
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:21,924
Get the hell
out of my church.

459
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:24,059
- What, no absolution?
- Come on, come on.

460
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,786
Move it. Listen.

461
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,398
Just because
some sick perverts

462
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:29,718
decide to live out their
fantasies through the collar

463
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:32,620
doesn't mean that every priest
is a gay pedophile.

464
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:35,131
Then what do
the johnnies have on you, sir?

465
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:44,152
I'm not a quitter, padre.

466
00:18:47,978 --> 00:18:51,415
Two years ago,
I had an affair.

467
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,695
One of my parishioners...

468
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,997
keisha leeks.

469
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,920
She had a child.

470
00:18:57,955 --> 00:18:59,167
Holy shit.

471
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:00,889
Damon's sister?

472
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:03,864
And now he's threatening
to out you?

473
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:07,350
Already disgraced my vows.

474
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:09,269
Damon is a psychopath.

475
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:11,692
He's threatening
to kill keisha and Adam

476
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,572
if I don't cooperate.

477
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:16,900
Those bank deposits
are for keisha and the baby.

478
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:19,643
I would never take a dime
of his drug money.

479
00:19:19,678 --> 00:19:22,954
What do you know
about damon's operation?

480
00:19:23,524 --> 00:19:25,744
Keisha lives
with her grandfather.

481
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:28,415
She says damon
uses the old man's place

482
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,124
to cut and bag his dope.

483
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:32,839
You let me
take care of damon.

484
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:35,411
What if I can get
keisha and your kid

485
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:36,990
into a shelter somewhere?

486
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:38,845
I already tried that.

487
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,723
The urban-renewal project
that's taking over the hood

488
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:44,559
closed down the last
two shelters in the area.

489
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:46,199
Nah. You're doing
whatever you can

490
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:48,674
to take care of your blood.
I get it.

491
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:53,616
You leave the good deed
for the day up to me.

492
00:19:58,138 --> 00:19:59,222
Good news!

493
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:02,028
Squad car picked up two-man
on kenmore.

494
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:03,449
How'd they find him?

495
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:05,299
Oh, it's easy to spot
a moving violation

496
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:07,818
when the horsepower's
between their legs.

497
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:11,697
Watched this asshole
run through a stop sign.

498
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,058
Nearly clipped a city bus,

499
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:15,222
then he gave us a fake name.

500
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,674
Lucky he's got a memorable mug,

501
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:18,269
even in black and white.

502
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,814
Shot and tried to kill one
of my detectives last night.

503
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:23,249
I surely did not.

504
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:26,803
I'm glad you're around to vouch
for my character, though.

505
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:28,554
Jaw's feeling better.

506
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:33,330
Hey!

507
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,813
You, uh, you got the guy?

508
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:38,264
Citywide apb. Rookie comes
through with the big bust.

509
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:39,439
Is he, uh...

510
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:40,617
is he talking yet?

511
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:42,617
No, Dutch and Billings
will have first crack.

512
00:20:42,652 --> 00:20:44,899
Let's start with
the tussle at the projects.

513
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:46,200
If he admits
to a beef with Ronnie,

514
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:47,525
that's the open door
we need.

515
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,197
Let's go.

516
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:50,189
Good.

517
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,380
Hey, Steve, hold on.

518
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,181
Just because I'm out
on the street all the time

519
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,568
doesn't mean I haven't heard
about your little lawsuit.

520
00:20:59,603 --> 00:21:02,203
Now, I don't want your
half-assed brand of policework

521
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:03,828
you been phoning in
around here lately

522
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,891
anywhere near a hit on one
of my strike team members.

523
00:21:07,624 --> 00:21:08,687
It's not gonna happen here.

524
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:10,319
The guy shot at a cop.

525
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,295
Cuffs are never coming off.

526
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,132
We'll get him.

527
00:21:24,677 --> 00:21:26,212
Maceo padmore...

528
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:28,636
I'm detective Wagenbach,
this is detective Billings.

529
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:29,558
We're gonna
want to talk to you

530
00:21:29,593 --> 00:21:31,997
about an attempted
shooting last night.

531
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,301
Heard you had a run-in with
detective Gardocki the other day.

532
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,788
Yeah, his fist
ran into my jaw.

533
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:37,983
Is that why
you wanted to kill him?

534
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:39,663
I ain't tried
to kill nobody.

535
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:40,866
Well, then, your motorcycle did,

536
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:42,890
because a witness saw it
fleeing from the scene

537
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:43,849
of the shooting last night.

538
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:47,384
This faggot-ass cop
laid his hands onme.

539
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:49,824
Y'all need to
arrest his damn ass.

540
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,359
Great.

541
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,270
Only 20 seconds in,

542
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:54,150
already, we've got motive.

543
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:55,711
That ain't no motive.

544
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:56,590
I'm Christian.

545
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,688
I turn the other cheek.

546
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:58,986
He could turn both
cheeks.

547
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:00,649
He'd still be
talking out of his ass.

548
00:22:00,684 --> 00:22:01,656
Lucky for Gardocki,

549
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:04,281
you can't hit a guy standing
10 feet away with a clear shot.

550
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:05,200
That wasn't me,

551
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:06,855
so I guess we'll never know.

552
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,272
Assuming it wasn't, where were
you last night around 11:00?

553
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:10,727
Passed out on my bed.

554
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:11,729
Anybody see you?

555
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:12,754
Not that I can think of,

556
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,337
unless the dude that
jacked my bike for that joyride

557
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:17,433
was peeking in my window.

558
00:22:17,468 --> 00:22:19,247
Iook, this is just
getting started.

559
00:22:19,282 --> 00:22:20,542
I'm gonna go check
on my other thing.

560
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:21,565
Yeah, I'll keep
you informed.

561
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,381
Your neighbors know
where you at every night?

562
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,845
They probably know he's
not out trying to kill a cop.

563
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,008
They did hear your
motorcycle leave at 10:30

564
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:30,800
and return
sometime after 1:00.

565
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:32,491
Nice of whoever stole
it to bring it back

566
00:22:32,526 --> 00:22:33,226
when they were done.

567
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:36,165
Be nicer if the dude
had filled the tank.

568
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:40,050
The only chance you have
of getting a better deal

569
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:41,769
is to confess now.

570
00:22:41,804 --> 00:22:44,024
Y'all don't think
I know y'all are fronting,

571
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:46,535
trying to run a game
on a nigga?

572
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,655
From where I sit,

573
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,509
you're about to
lose big-time.

574
00:22:56,657 --> 00:22:58,115
We're gonna let him
stew for a while.

575
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,622
Because we got
plenty of nothing?

576
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:00,606
And he knows it.

577
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:02,973
There's no use going back in
there until we can change that.

578
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:03,932
Anything on the gun?

579
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,411
We got unis
at his apartment

580
00:23:05,446 --> 00:23:07,163
and going over the route
he would have taken to get home.

581
00:23:07,198 --> 00:23:08,502
It's good we know the way,

582
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:09,321
'cause if we don't find
that gun,

583
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:10,776
we may as well
give him a ride home.

584
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:12,241
What about
the cousin's house?

585
00:23:12,276 --> 00:23:14,033
Shane and I... we
checked it out earlier.

586
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:14,935
Two-man had been there.

587
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,231
Well, you better
take another look.

588
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:17,236
Well, what are
waiting for?

589
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,794
A search warrant.
Make a call.

590
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:19,885
I'm pretty sure
I can talk the cousin

591
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,404
into letting us in
without a warrant.

592
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:22,431
It would
save us some time.

593
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:24,802
- Great, we'll send some unis.
- I think just me and Julien.

594
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,667
Too many bodies, it would
look like an occupation

595
00:23:26,702 --> 00:23:28,306
instead of
a friendly request.

596
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:29,758
Okay, get over there.

597
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:32,716
Hey...

598
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:35,924
- give me a minute first?
- All right. I'll meet you outside.

599
00:23:43,124 --> 00:23:43,661
Hey. Where'd you hide the gun?

600
00:23:43,696 --> 00:23:44,605
You getting me
out of here?

601
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,220
Where did you
hide the gun?

602
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:49,311
Look, man, I've got to get to it
before anybody else here does.

603
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,125
Or maybe you want to
put me away with it.

604
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,093
Iook, I am trying
to save you, dumb-ass.

605
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:54,739
Without that gun,

606
00:23:54,774 --> 00:23:56,491
they don't have shit on you.

607
00:23:56,526 --> 00:23:59,367
But I have to
get to it first.

608
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,432
They're on their way to your
cousin's house right now.

609
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,834
If the gun is there,
they are going to find it.

610
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:13,689
- Are you registering that?
- You think I trust you?

611
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:15,724
You wanted me to kill your own
cop buddy, rember that?

612
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,872
Which means we're in this
goddamn thing together.

613
00:24:22,213 --> 00:24:25,556
Right now, please tell me
where the gun is.

614
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:27,519
There's a grate
in the backyard...

615
00:24:27,554 --> 00:24:28,783
some kind of sewer thing.

616
00:24:28,818 --> 00:24:30,866
It's in there,
underneath.

617
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:33,373
Why is the camera off?

618
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:35,167
I didn't think you'd
want a defense attorney

619
00:24:35,202 --> 00:24:38,139
hearing the names I was
just calling this asshole.

620
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:45,325
I stay undercover
for you guys,

621
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,412
keep gaining
Pezuela's trust,

622
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,126
and I.c.E.
Gets a front-row seat

623
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:50,854
to the Mexican
cartel show.

624
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,613
As much as
your tainted reputation

625
00:24:52,648 --> 00:24:54,093
may help you on the street,

626
00:24:54,128 --> 00:24:56,828
it concerns the higher-ups.

627
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:59,571
It's not gonna be an easy sell,
making this a full-time gig.

628
00:24:59,606 --> 00:25:01,723
Come on, you guys make deals
with freeway Rick,

629
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:03,091
Antwon Mitchell.

630
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,759
Here's a chance to put
one of the good guys

631
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,937
back on the street,
get something done.

632
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,208
Yeah?

633
00:25:10,473 --> 00:25:11,999
Send him in.

634
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:14,802
It seems
you're not the only one

635
00:25:14,837 --> 00:25:17,110
that Pezuela
is trying to employ.

636
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:23,128
Pezuela say anything else,

637
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:25,911
indicate why he played
the mayor card this early?

638
00:25:25,946 --> 00:25:28,009
I didn't
get to ask questions.

639
00:25:28,044 --> 00:25:29,448
As soon as I showed
any reluctance,

640
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:30,993
he turned his offer
into an ultimatum,

641
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:32,554
demanded a reply
by tonight.

642
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:35,142
Why is montalban
crawling out of his

643
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:36,799
fine corinthian skin?

644
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:39,691
We're not at liberty
to discuss it.

645
00:25:39,726 --> 00:25:41,419
Hey, I'm the one
on the firing line.

646
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:42,734
Anything coming at Pezuela

647
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:45,023
is gonna be pointed
right at my dome, too.

648
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:47,922
If it's any consolation,
you won't be alone.

649
00:25:47,957 --> 00:25:49,769
You need to take him up
on his offer,

650
00:25:49,804 --> 00:25:51,442
accept his support
for mayor.

651
00:25:51,477 --> 00:25:54,217
I gave you that box to distance
myself from this guy.

652
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,051
I've washed my hands.

653
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,744
Are you sure those hands
are clean, councilman?

654
00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:58,691
'Cause I can start
pulling the threads on your

655
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:00,597
"the box showed up
on my doorstep" story.

656
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:02,311
I risked everything
I've worked for

657
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:04,206
bringing that box
to you, asshole.

658
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:05,526
Hey, we're all
on the same side here.

659
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:08,290
Let's talk about
what needs to get done.

660
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:12,040
Pezuela's spooked.

661
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:13,424
We need to keep him in I.a.

662
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:15,919
Securing you as his
mayor-in-pocket will do that.

663
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:18,451
So will getting the liquor
permits for his renewal project.

664
00:26:18,486 --> 00:26:20,537
Both of you have to
get in bed with him.

665
00:26:20,572 --> 00:26:22,610
Jesus Christ.

666
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,645
Pezuela's being evaluated.

667
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:28,580
Cartel.

668
00:26:28,615 --> 00:26:31,027
Someone's here.

669
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:33,026
That's why he's with
the entourage, isn't it?

670
00:26:33,061 --> 00:26:34,550
He's scared.

671
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:36,166
He's being watched.

672
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:37,199
He knows it...

673
00:26:37,234 --> 00:26:39,623
making some bold moves
to secure the confidence

674
00:26:39,658 --> 00:26:41,062
of his backers in Mexico.

675
00:26:41,097 --> 00:26:44,046
Our one and only goal is
to tie Pezuela to the cartel.

676
00:26:44,081 --> 00:26:45,398
And what happens
when this blows up

677
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,484
and my name gets tied
to Pezuela and the cartel?

678
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,507
"Former cop goes undercover

679
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:51,529
to catch a cartel player
trying to buy a mayor."

680
00:26:51,564 --> 00:26:53,247
Smells like victory.

681
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:54,860
If my opponent
gets ahold of this,

682
00:26:54,895 --> 00:26:56,188
it's gonna smell
like something else.

683
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:58,714
Olivia will be your
point person from now on.

684
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:00,593
She'll contactyou.

685
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:03,794
Be careful, gentlemen.

686
00:27:05,716 --> 00:27:06,872
Hey, don't worry.

687
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:08,560
If Pezuela
wants you taken out,

688
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:11,052
I'll be the one
he hires to do it.

689
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:22,851
Order to keep
Pezuela in play

690
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:25,347
came down from
the department of defense...

691
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:26,632
means the cartel evaluator

692
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,962
is most likely Mexican military.

693
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:30,737
D.c. Wants us
to track this new guy,

694
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:32,746
see who and what
he plugs into.

695
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:35,138
If you really want to make
yourself an asset to us,

696
00:27:35,173 --> 00:27:37,778
find a way to align yourself
with this military cat.

697
00:27:37,813 --> 00:27:39,589
I'll see what I can do.

698
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,238
Hey, uh...

699
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,285
you handled yourself
really well back there.

700
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,932
I'm glad you're the one
who's got my back.

701
00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:49,013
I made some calls,

702
00:27:49,048 --> 00:27:52,162
got keisha and Adam leeks
into the el segundo family shelter.

703
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:54,205
That's great.
I'll go let her know.

704
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:57,594
Iook, your cousin's
at the police station

705
00:27:57,629 --> 00:27:59,073
being grilled
for attempted murder.

706
00:27:59,108 --> 00:27:59,708
Evidence could be here.

707
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:00,739
We need to do a search.

708
00:28:00,774 --> 00:28:02,227
We got nothing
to do with this.

709
00:28:02,262 --> 00:28:04,015
Iook, you can either let us take
a look around right now,

710
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,457
or 20 cops show up in an hour
and they wreck this place.

711
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:07,797
It's up to you.

712
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,824
You take the front two rooms,
I'll take the back.

713
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,060
You got it.

714
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,237
Shane and Julien
came up empty at the cousin's.

715
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:48,973
How far does
an obscured witness

716
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:49,982
and a partial plate
get us?

717
00:28:50,017 --> 00:28:51,576
You willing to roll
to a jury with that

718
00:28:51,611 --> 00:28:53,483
if he'd been trying
to fill your ass with lead?

719
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:55,318
Anywhere
on known associates?

720
00:28:55,353 --> 00:28:56,734
Other than bombay, who's dead,

721
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:57,991
there's no one.

722
00:28:58,814 --> 00:29:00,454
Maybe it's time
to switch up teams here.

723
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,679
Hey, we're doing the
best we can

724
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:02,854
with what
we've got to work with.

725
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:04,718
And the final result's looking
to be this asshole walking

726
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:05,840
with nothing but
a few hunger pangs.

727
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:08,095
You want to help? Get out
there, drum up some evidence.

728
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,343
I searched my ass off
for the gun.

729
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:10,753
The guy's smart enough
to hide it

730
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:12,464
someplace where we're not
going to find it.

731
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:14,425
And we're not putting
this guy away

732
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,391
without that gun
or a confession.

733
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:18,928
So, if you've pushed
all the buttons you can,

734
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:20,562
then let's get a little
new blood up there.

735
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:22,178
Who? You?

736
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:23,730
Me and Julien.

737
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:25,983
Well, we're not through.

738
00:29:26,018 --> 00:29:27,983
He doesn't know
we don't have the gun.

739
00:29:28,553 --> 00:29:29,744
Risky lie.

740
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:32,373
Iook, man, he catches you
in that fib, he hardens,

741
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:35,085
you got no place
left to squeeze.

742
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,659
We started this.

743
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,110
Can we finish it?

744
00:29:39,598 --> 00:29:41,135
One last shot.

745
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,494
Let's go.

746
00:29:48,081 --> 00:29:49,601
Hey, guess what.

747
00:29:49,636 --> 00:29:53,183
We found the gun you used
to shoot at detective Gardocki.

748
00:29:53,218 --> 00:29:56,134
Yeah? Where?

749
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,331
That's funny.

750
00:29:57,366 --> 00:29:58,674
Innocent man says,

751
00:29:58,709 --> 00:29:59,865
"there is no gun to find."

752
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,386
Guilty man asks, "where?"

753
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:02,804
So, earlier today,
you gave us motive.

754
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,924
No verifiable alibi
equals opportunity.

755
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,029
Gun gives us means.

756
00:30:06,064 --> 00:30:07,567
Means, motive,
and opportunity...

757
00:30:07,602 --> 00:30:09,214
the holy trinity
of incarceration.

758
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:10,894
The only question is whether
this gets written up

759
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:12,878
as attempted first-degree
or second-degree murder.

760
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,092
Difference of doing 6 years,

761
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:15,136
reducible with good behavior,

762
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:17,338
or doing a mandatory 20.

763
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,996
There ain't no gun to find.

764
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:28,503
Now, if you found a gun,

765
00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:29,649
show it to me,

766
00:30:29,684 --> 00:30:31,028
and I'll tell you why
that gat

767
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:35,134
and any other shit
you found ain't mine.

768
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,968
How are we looking?

769
00:30:46,003 --> 00:30:47,815
If Wagenbach and Billings
do any more jerking off,

770
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,775
it's gonna be a goddamn
bukkake party in there.

771
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,325
Let me and Vic
have a run at this guy.

772
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,949
Where are we at with him?

773
00:30:54,984 --> 00:30:56,683
They told him
we found the gun.

774
00:30:56,718 --> 00:30:57,515
And we don't have it,

775
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,011
so he's feeling his oats.

776
00:30:59,046 --> 00:31:01,462
Iook, it's time to put
the first string in

777
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:03,316
before this game
is lost, coach.

778
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:06,134
- Okay.
- Okay, come on.

779
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:08,634
Wait a second.
I got a better idea.

780
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:11,649
This guy's shot
is knocking around hookers.

781
00:31:11,684 --> 00:31:13,409
He's already pissed off
a bunch of them, right?

782
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:16,787
Instead of producing
the real gun we don't have,

783
00:31:16,822 --> 00:31:20,410
why don't we produce
the fake witnesses we do?

784
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,609
Do the right thing.

785
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:25,243
Save the taxpayers a lot of
money on an unnecessary trial.

786
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:26,883
I didn't do it.

787
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:32,534
Just give us one person who
can establish your whereabouts

788
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:33,502
at the time of the shooting.

789
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:36,621
Why don't you give me one person
who says iwasthere?

790
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:38,497
Detective Wagenbach.

791
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:46,292
I hear we don't have shit
on this prick.

792
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:48,543
So, here's what
we're gonna do.

793
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:12,195
I, uh, can't really see
what's going on down there.

794
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:16,784
So, I want you
to smile at me

795
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:19,899
like we got this bastard
hung to the cross

796
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:22,433
and thank me like
you really mean it.

797
00:32:22,468 --> 00:32:24,237
I appreciate it.

798
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,599
Detective Mackey
turned up two witnesses

799
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:31,598
claim you told them yesterday
you were gonna kill the cop

800
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:32,414
who roughed you up.

801
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:34,152
That's some bullshit.

802
00:32:34,187 --> 00:32:35,216
Who said that?

803
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:37,730
Uh, couple of pros
you use as punching bags,

804
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:39,569
farrah and capuchina?

805
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:41,182
They're giving statements
right now.

806
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:43,902
I didn't say nothing
to them bitches!

807
00:32:43,937 --> 00:32:45,121
Y'all cops
getting them to snitch

808
00:32:45,156 --> 00:32:46,656
over the beat downs
they earn.

809
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:49,425
So, now we got you
on a couple assaults.

810
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,181
We got the gun...

811
00:32:51,216 --> 00:32:53,796
we got the two witnesses
who say he planned the shooting,

812
00:32:53,831 --> 00:32:56,035
we got the witness who saw the
motorcycle at the crime scene.

813
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,902
I think we're done here.

814
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:03,058
Now, there it is.
There's the worm.

815
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:04,865
Take it.

816
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,996
Come on, it's right
in front of you, shithead.

817
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:08,390
Take it!

818
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:12,886
What if you get forced
to do something...

819
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:14,975
that you didn't
really want to do?

820
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,870
I mean,
that's not a crime, right?

821
00:33:16,905 --> 00:33:18,190
Not necessarily.
It depends.

822
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:20,445
What are we talking
about, exactly?

823
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,853
Be right back.

824
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:25,799
That ho Amber that got herself
killed the other day.

825
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:26,559
What about her?

826
00:33:26,594 --> 00:33:29,135
He was gonna put my name on that
killing I don't do what he say.

827
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,785
He needed a cop murked.

828
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,872
Who wanted him dead?

829
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:36,039
I ain't gonna get in no trouble
over this, right?

830
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:37,567
I had no choice.

831
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:41,393
Who are we talking about?

832
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:42,660
Who made you do it?

833
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:44,779
That cop in there.

834
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,674
What cop?

835
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,804
Dixie boy.

836
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:52,886
He gave me the.357,

837
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:54,153
told me the address,

838
00:33:54,188 --> 00:33:56,073
told me his partner's shift
ended at 11:00,

839
00:33:56,108 --> 00:33:57,906
told me what kind of car
he was gonna be driving up in,

840
00:33:57,941 --> 00:33:59,993
told me where to hide
so I wouldn't be seen,

841
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:01,783
told me, "two shots
to bring him down,

842
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:04,401
two shots to the head
to be sure."

843
00:34:05,364 --> 00:34:06,637
Hey, Shane!

844
00:34:06,775 --> 00:34:08,584
I'm in charge
of softball sign-up.

845
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:09,614
You in this year?

846
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:10,288
Uh, sure.

847
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:11,314
You want to play
center field?

848
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,074
Yeah, okay.

849
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:13,821
'Cause we lost Asher
at shortstop.

850
00:34:13,856 --> 00:34:14,268
Wherever.

851
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:17,808
It's gonna be $75 this year
instead of the usual $50.

852
00:34:17,843 --> 00:34:19,367
Shane Vendrell...

853
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:21,502
hired you
to kill Gardocki?

854
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:23,497
I didn't get hired
to do shit.

855
00:34:23,532 --> 00:34:26,252
I got thrown on a slave ship
and given a gun for an oar.

856
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:27,795
Wasn't no money in it.

857
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,811
He was in here earlier.

858
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:30,109
Mackey!

859
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,299
Julien!

860
00:34:36,311 --> 00:34:37,386
Where's Vendrell?!

861
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:39,434
Get down!

862
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:41,525
What number do you want 'cause
I'm having them stitched on.

863
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,316
Uh, you pick.

864
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:45,342
You can have anything
but 23, 17, and 35.

865
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:48,253
Just pick the goddamn number
and shove it up your ass!

866
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,008
Okay.

867
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:55,441
Mackey!

868
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:57,843
What's going on?
We're looking for Shane!

869
00:34:57,878 --> 00:34:59,123
He just left.

870
00:34:59,158 --> 00:35:01,014
Who put a cactus
up his ass?

871
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:23,480
Corrine?

872
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,641
Hi.

873
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:32,548
You left Jackson
in the car.

874
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:34,566
I need you to listen
very carefully.

875
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:36,830
- Why?
- Just... listen.

876
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:38,738
Vic murdered Terry Crowley.

877
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,314
Shane was there.
He saw it.

878
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:43,163
And later,
Vic and the strike team

879
00:35:43,198 --> 00:35:46,043
robbed the Armenian mob
of over $2 million.

880
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:46,849
What?

881
00:35:46,884 --> 00:35:48,676
That's why there was an Armenian
hit man in your house,

882
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:50,092
hunting down
you and your kids.

883
00:35:50,127 --> 00:35:52,107
Shane shot him
and saved you.

884
00:35:52,142 --> 00:35:53,370
And two nights ago,

885
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:56,381
Vic and Ronnie tried to kill
Shane and the armenians

886
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:57,573
that were a threat to you.

887
00:35:57,608 --> 00:35:59,822
The armenians got killed,
but Shane didn't.

888
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,317
So, last night, he retaliated
out of self-defense.

889
00:36:02,352 --> 00:36:03,165
- You're crazy.
- No.

890
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,271
Someone is finally
telling you the truth.

891
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:06,278
Well, I'm not listening.

892
00:36:06,313 --> 00:36:09,038
No, just shut up
and pay attention!

893
00:36:09,073 --> 00:36:11,397
There is a lot of shit going
down at the Barn right now.

894
00:36:11,432 --> 00:36:13,261
Shane and I are
getting out of town.

895
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,227
You are gonna pass two messages
on to Vic and Ronnie.

896
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:18,525
The first is a reminder
that they started this

897
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,885
when they
tried to kill Shane.

898
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,999
The second is that
they are gonna do

899
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:24,416
everything in their power
to prevent any and all

900
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,672
authorities from finding us,

901
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:26,951
because if we get caught,

902
00:36:26,986 --> 00:36:29,632
Shane is gonna testify to
so much strike team shit

903
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:31,233
that the two of them
will be put away

904
00:36:31,268 --> 00:36:32,744
for 10 natural lifetimes.

905
00:36:32,779 --> 00:36:35,704
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

906
00:36:35,739 --> 00:36:36,401
Yes.

907
00:36:36,436 --> 00:36:38,412
You are gonna be
by your phone every day

908
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:41,188
at 1:00 in the afternoon
and 10:00 at night.

909
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:43,604
I am gonna call from wherever
we are and check in.

910
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,980
Vic needs to
give you information

911
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:47,600
on what the cops
know about us

912
00:36:47,635 --> 00:36:49,096
and where they think
we're going.

913
00:36:49,131 --> 00:36:51,427
You tell him
all of this...

914
00:36:51,462 --> 00:36:52,192
everything,

915
00:36:52,227 --> 00:36:54,588
exactly what I said.

916
00:36:57,742 --> 00:36:59,254
Must have
given you some reason

917
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,165
why he wanted you
to kill Gardocki.

918
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,103
Nah, the man was all about
the whens, wheres, and hows.

919
00:37:06,138 --> 00:37:07,958
"Why" never
crossed his lips.

920
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:09,621
Peters just checked in.

921
00:37:09,656 --> 00:37:10,526
Shane's house is empty.

922
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,886
It looked like a quick pack job.

923
00:37:11,921 --> 00:37:13,262
Whole family is on the move.

924
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,555
Why?

925
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,102
It's clear
Mara is an accomplice.

926
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:18,295
No, why did this man
try and kill you?

927
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,750
No clue.

928
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:21,024
Ask Shane.

929
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:23,335
I will when
I catch up with him.

930
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,513
And both of you
are not to leave this building!

931
00:37:25,548 --> 00:37:28,565
I've got questions!
I expect answers!

932
00:37:33,758 --> 00:37:35,342
I got love for all people,

933
00:37:35,377 --> 00:37:37,222
even hoes. I wouldn't hurt a fly.

934
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:39,301
You know, you did
shoot that spinner.

935
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:40,667
She all right?

936
00:37:40,702 --> 00:37:42,566
Gonna be left-handed
for the next six months.

937
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:44,309
Iook, I'm sorry
she got hit up.

938
00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:46,909
But that cop
gave me no choice,

939
00:37:46,944 --> 00:37:49,155
squeezed me over
a bullshit murder charge,

940
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,126
then tried to get me
to caphisdude.

941
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:53,846
You're all about bringing
force down on the street.

942
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:55,381
Why don't y'all take a look
at what you got going on

943
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:57,245
under your own roof?

944
00:38:01,316 --> 00:38:02,828
- Holy shit.
- That's right,

945
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,707
"holy shit."

946
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:05,129
Okay, okay,

947
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:06,042
we need your help.

948
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:07,112
My help?

949
00:38:07,147 --> 00:38:09,952
Well, do it for whatever
reason you need...

950
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,085
for the kids, for Ronnie,

951
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,094
the time we've spent...

952
00:38:14,129 --> 00:38:16,901
but help us now, please.

953
00:38:16,936 --> 00:38:19,018
If you tell me the truth
and I believe you,

954
00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:20,890
I will help you.

955
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,573
Did you really
do all those things?

956
00:38:24,714 --> 00:38:28,688
I did a lot of things
that I shouldn't have done,

957
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,009
for reasons that made sense
at the time,

958
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:34,015
but they're pretty hard
to defend right now.

959
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,574
What do you want me to say,
that I'm different?

960
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,229
I don't want to
go to prison.

961
00:38:39,264 --> 00:38:41,781
Do you want me
to go to prison?

962
00:38:41,816 --> 00:38:45,756
Do either of you
even feel any shame?

963
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,668
I don't think about it.

964
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,508
Well, that's honest.

965
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:50,869
Sad thing is,

966
00:38:50,904 --> 00:38:53,787
I've known...
maybe not the specifics,

967
00:38:53,822 --> 00:38:55,322
the details... but I've known,

968
00:38:55,357 --> 00:39:00,161
and I have let you infect
me and our children.

969
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:03,514
I'll help you
this one last time...

970
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:07,136
and then the kids
and I are out of your life!

971
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:08,850
That is my price.

972
00:39:08,885 --> 00:39:13,288
And you have to pay
some kind of price!

973
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:19,927
First call from Mara's
at 1:00 in the afternoon.

974
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:22,998
You let me know what
you want me to tell her.

975
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,560
Okay, we go in cold.

976
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:52,536
Watch for my signal.

977
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:03,085
Yeah,
what do you want?

978
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,261
Drop-off for damon.

979
00:40:10,528 --> 00:40:12,082
- Are you keisha?
- Mm-hmm.

980
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:13,361
Father morton sent me.

981
00:40:13,396 --> 00:40:16,084
We're gonna get you and
your kid out of here safe.

982
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,626
- For real?
- Promise.

983
00:40:17,661 --> 00:40:18,458
You know who's inside?

984
00:40:18,493 --> 00:40:20,298
My gramps and my boy
are watching TV.

985
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:23,372
Damon's in the back bedroom.
Got three of his boys with him.

986
00:40:23,407 --> 00:40:24,372
Good girl.

987
00:40:24,407 --> 00:40:25,339
Get her out of here.

988
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:27,301
It's all gonna
be all right.

989
00:40:46,874 --> 00:40:48,582
Hey! You!

990
00:40:54,574 --> 00:40:55,534
That's all right.

991
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:58,274
Where you're going,
all you're gonna need is lips.

992
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:06,281
Here's my kids' tuition.

993
00:41:06,661 --> 00:41:09,920
Pezuela gave me an extra
5 grand for the fast work.

994
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:11,866
The Mackey I read about
in your file

995
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:13,530
would have pocketed
that cash.

996
00:41:13,565 --> 00:41:15,912
I'm not the bastard my bosses
tried to make me out to be

997
00:41:15,947 --> 00:41:18,294
while I was logging
more high-profile collars

998
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:20,654
than anyone else
in this city.

999
00:41:21,988 --> 00:41:23,402
And I want the job.

1000
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:25,385
I think you got chaffee
half-convinced.

1001
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,424
Bring Pezuela home, and I think
we'll get all the way there...

1002
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:30,959
with a push from me.

1003
00:41:34,746 --> 00:41:35,829
Olivia...

1004
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,554
thanks for doing
the right thing by me.

1005
00:41:39,244 --> 00:41:42,044
Wouldn't want to
piss off Jesus.

1006
00:41:56,977 --> 00:41:59,874
If Shane was gonna retaliate
against both of us,

1007
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:02,274
why only come after me?

1008
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:04,674
And why trust it
to someone like two-man?

1009
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:07,453
He needed to give
himself an alibi.

1010
00:42:12,344 --> 00:42:14,714
Or he need
someone to kill you

1011
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:17,772
'cause he was
waiting to kill me.

1012
00:42:18,544 --> 00:42:22,731
When I got your call, I didn't
even get inside my door.

1013
00:42:26,771 --> 00:42:27,972
Even with our help,

1014
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:30,376
how long can they hide?

1015
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:31,218
A month?

1016
00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:33,429
If he got lucky, a year?

1017
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,820
