1
00:00:00,394 --> 00:00:02,227
Previously on "The Shield"...

2
00:00:02,262 --> 00:00:03,953
Teenage resident Lloyd Denton...

3
00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:04,724
he's our shooter.

4
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:08,099
There's speculation bundy's first murders
were committed in his early teens.

5
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:09,410
Are you saying
this kid's a serial killer?

6
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:10,805
This guy's all I've got.

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,517
I'm targeting Cruz Pezuela.

8
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:14,399
Aceveda's one-man
campaign bankroll?

9
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:16,687
He's buying up Farmington
with cartel money.

10
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:20,330
Blackmail... that's how Pezuela's getting
everyone on board the train to cartel town.

11
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:21,602
Where's our blackmail box?

12
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:22,997
I am in possession of the box

13
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:24,912
until the time to turn
it over to justice.

14
00:00:24,947 --> 00:00:25,775
What about the files?

15
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,334
The armenians are making a hard
play for your barrio sand box.

16
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,806
This piece of shit Rezian has taken
something that belongs to me.

17
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:34,698
You want to give me a clue
what all this is about?

18
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:38,365
The mexis are using to blackmail
their way up to the top.

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,558
And you made it look like this
prick sold out to the armos.

20
00:00:40,593 --> 00:00:43,491
Which lit the fuse for
the blood feud we're stirring up

21
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:45,046
between Rezian and the Mexicans.

22
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:46,936
We need a quick Armenian political win.

23
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:48,502
Give me the name,
I'll put it in play.

24
00:00:48,537 --> 00:00:50,151
The city controller...
Robert Martin.

25
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:52,037
He's in the blackmail box?

26
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:54,467
Robert, oh, my God!

27
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:55,397
I need a medic!

28
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:57,429
Their march turns
into a goddamn killing.

29
00:00:57,464 --> 00:00:58,549
That was never part
of the plan.

30
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:00,518
Martin was my colleague, Vic.

31
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:02,044
I did not sign up for this!

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,377
Detective Mackey,
amando rios.

33
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:05,949
Amando will speak for me.

34
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:07,607
Give me a name,
and I'll run with it.

35
00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:09,253
Rios isn't just some beaner.

36
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:11,262
He's got a face
only a cartel could love.

37
00:01:11,297 --> 00:01:13,910
If rios gets spooked, we lose
our best shot at Pezuela.

38
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:14,886
Never heard of him.

39
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:17,421
David Aceveda,
federal agent Olivia Murray.

40
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:18,484
That fed in the Clubhouse...

41
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,429
I thought I'd seen her name
somewhere before.

42
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:21,736
She's in the blackmail box?

43
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:23,075
Pezuela got her
in his pocket.

44
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,462
How much have
you told her?

45
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:26,602
Enough to get us
both killed.

46
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:35,822
www.1000fr.com presents...

47
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:56,409
You look like shit.

48
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,031
I'm supposed to get
a minute's sleep

49
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:01,447
knowing Olivia could have
ratted us out to Pezuela???

50
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:04,245
Just because Olivia has been
Pezuela's eyes and ears

51
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,300
doesn't mean she's been
passing along the intel

52
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,099
we've been feeding her.

53
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,293
Do you think
she's holding on to it,

54
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:12,552
maybe use it
against Pezuela herself?

55
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:14,554
She's up to her manhole
in shit lake.

56
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:16,382
That's what I'ddo.

57
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,001
Dangerous part for us, though,

58
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:20,792
is not knowing.

59
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:27,022
You two work closely.
Did he have enemies downtown?

60
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:30,166
A city this size with the money
and powerat stake?

61
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,143
But at the end of the day,
Robert was a glorified accountant...

62
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:34,206
not a very sexy target.

63
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:35,734
And your people
didn't see anything?

64
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:37,735
Heard shots, and then
it was complete chaos.

65
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,630
Why was your team deployed
there in the first place?

66
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:42,213
Detective Vendrell has been
working with an Armenian C.I.

67
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:44,005
Who's given us a couple
of wins recently.

68
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,987
We've been hearing
some chatter

69
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:46,835
that there's been some, uh,

70
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,324
Armenian-Mexican friction.

71
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:51,523
So your assessment... this is organized-
crime syndicates squaring off?

72
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,627
Martin was clearly the target,

73
00:02:53,662 --> 00:02:56,309
and there's not a banger out therewith
a merit badge for marksmanship.

74
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:59,011
Have to wonder if those shots
weren't meant for Mr. Aceveda...

75
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,841
you being a mayoral
candidate now.

76
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:10,614
Uh, Vic, do you...
do you have any change?

77
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,150
This kouf guy's becoming a real
rock Star in the department.

78
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:19,397
With him leading the investigation now
and our involvement,

79
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,990
this could all blow back on us.

80
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:22,733
Take a deep,
cleansing breath.

81
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:24,966
Neither one of us had anything
to do with that shooting,

82
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,430
by word or deed.

83
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:28,294
We damn sure know
who's responsible.

84
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:30,694
- When you've got a minute...
- sure.

85
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:33,342
And the slightest whisper
of impropriety

86
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:34,576
is a political career ender.

87
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:36,675
Do you know how much
she's told Pezuela?

88
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:38,488
I'll handle her...

89
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:41,314
but it's got to be gently.

90
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:44,221
Your problem is, you're trying
to have it both ways.

91
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:46,039
You want to take down Pezuela,

92
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:48,641
win a landslide as a reformer,

93
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:51,656
but not until he pays
all your bills.

94
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,269
Oh, sorry.

95
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:57,175
I only got 50 cents,

96
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,634
and you're about a dollar.

97
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,081
What's up, buttercup?

98
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:08,547
Got a situation I could use
a little help on.

99
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,914
Ask, and you shall.

100
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,818
I need to run it by your captain first,
make sure it's kosher.

101
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,972
Then I'll hit you
with the details.

102
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:17,264
Uh, anything come back
on the intel I gave you?

103
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,777
Nothing so far.

104
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:20,316
Hope it wasn't
a bum steer.

105
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,777
Not like you to be
off the money.

106
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:24,779
Okay, well,
give me a shout...

107
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:25,918
it gets you
to that bigger fish.

108
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:27,759
You'll be the first to know,

109
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,530
believe me.

110
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,518
I got to go.

111
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,371
Olivia needs us to backstop
her on something.

112
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,008
I'm waiting on the details.

113
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,522
Am I, uh...

114
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:47,841
am I missing something?

115
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:51,552
Olivia's carrying water
for Pezuela.

116
00:04:51,587 --> 00:04:53,363
She's in the box of sins.

117
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:54,543
What?

118
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:56,938
Her brother got jammed up
with some mob bookies.

119
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:58,807
Pezuela got wind somehow,
got proof.

120
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:01,765
Could explain why she's become a fact of life
around here all of a sudden.

121
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,972
This prick owns a federal agent
who's up our ass, collecting intel.

122
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:06,551
You boys gonna let me
in on this?

123
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:07,864
I just found out myself.

124
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,832
We're still not sure about
the size of Pezuela's hook.

125
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:12,570
Well, it's pretty goddamn clear
what we need to do.

126
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:16,138
We'll give the box to Rezian so that
the armenians can return it to Pezuela,

127
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:17,378
and he lays off.

128
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:18,920
Not yet.

129
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:23,042
Are you not understanding
that this master plan of yours is backfiring?

130
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:25,044
Rezian still has our families
in the crosshairs.

131
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,103
Now Pezuela has sicced
a fed on us.

132
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:28,632
I understand the situation.

133
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:32,209
Return the box and get credit
for brokering a peace deal.

134
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:34,519
Our money train debt
is paid in full.

135
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:38,787
Now, explain to me how that is not
in all of our best interests.

136
00:05:39,531 --> 00:05:41,038
Another time.

137
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:44,933
King rat's gaytan echevarria...

138
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:47,798
cuban, Miami-based.
He's visiting I.a.

139
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,604
Doing what?

140
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,927
He's meeting Martin blez,

141
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:53,621
number-two denim manufacturer
in the world.

142
00:05:53,656 --> 00:05:55,645
Echevarria's looking to clean
his drug benjamins

143
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,232
by plowing them into
a legit biz... blue jeans.

144
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:01,255
So, how does the
strike team fit in?

145
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,679
Echevarria's daughter, noelle...

146
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:05,150
freshman at s.c.

147
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:08,238
She got carjacked this morning
at 8th and hoover.

148
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:09,606
Three black males
ordered her boyfriend

149
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:11,892
out of the car at gunpoint,
drove off with the girl.

150
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:15,486
Our surveillance picked up the boyfriend
telling her old man what happened.

151
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:17,254
That neighborhood,
it's probably gang-related.

152
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,966
Hence the strike team.

153
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:20,237
With his daughter missing,

154
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:22,685
echevarria's not focused
on business.

155
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,821
Bad guys love
their kids, too.

156
00:06:24,856 --> 00:06:27,139
This meeting with blez
is our one opportunity

157
00:06:27,174 --> 00:06:28,595
to take down
the whole network.

158
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,667
It doesn't make,

159
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:32,760
a high-dollar 18-month investigation
goes out the window.

160
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:35,288
So you need the strike team
to find the missing girl

161
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:37,266
so daddy will get back
to the dirty business.

162
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:39,770
Without tipping echevarria
the police are involved.

163
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:41,969
He hasn't reported
the kidnapping.

164
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:44,768
Our surveillance intel has got him using
his own muscle to find her.

165
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:46,210
Taking matters
into his own hands...

166
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:47,682
could get a lot
of people hurt.

167
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:50,453
He knows law enforcement's involved
and he didn't drop the dime,

168
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:52,728
he'll figure out
he's being watched.

169
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:55,311
Description of
the echevarria girl's car.

170
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:56,761
Not like we can put out
an apb

171
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,034
if we need to keep this
on the down low.

172
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,696
My best recommend is start
with the local chop shops.

173
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:02,648
See if anyone's trying
to unload her nissan.

174
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:05,124
Let's pull all the files on car thefts
for the last six months...

175
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,849
suspects, arrest records,
similar m.o.s.

176
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,769
Got it.

177
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,807
Your surveillance come up
with any intel

178
00:07:09,842 --> 00:07:11,998
on the kind of muscle
echevarria's traveling with?

179
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,855
Four guys... cuban and jamaican,

180
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,578
armed, long list of crimes.

181
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:18,108
When's this meet with denim dude
supposed to go down?

182
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:20,530
Blez's jet gets
into Van nuys around 6:00,

183
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,075
assuming our cuban
doesn't cancel the meet.

184
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,018
That doesn't give us
a lot of time.

185
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:26,130
Let me say it again...

186
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:29,035
echevarria gets a whiff
of police anywhere near this,

187
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,884
he will get spooked
and bolt.

188
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,679
Understood.

189
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:39,895
You drop the bomb that Olivia
is in Pezuela's blackmail box.

190
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,714
Now she's walking us
into a sketchy case

191
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:42,993
with out-of-town players.

192
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:43,882
You think
she's setting us up?

193
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:46,319
We got to assume she's gonna
give Pezuela a heads-up.

194
00:07:46,354 --> 00:07:48,135
Maybe he decides
to strike first.

195
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,575
Or maybe you're just
being paranoid

196
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,797
and this is exactly
what she says it is...

197
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:55,948
a random street crime that could possibly
wreck a high-profile I.c.E. Collar.

198
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:57,077
Either way,

199
00:07:57,112 --> 00:07:58,359
we got to watch our backs.

200
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,590
I pulled the most
recent 10851s.

201
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:05,300
Chop shop on manzanita specializes
in stolen parts for Japanese street racers.

202
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:06,396
We'll start there.

203
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:08,075
Ride with me.

204
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:12,514
We didn't get a chance to finish
our earlier conversation.

205
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:14,593
You were about to explain
what's more important

206
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,053
than keeping
our families safe.

207
00:08:17,088 --> 00:08:18,010
Nothing.

208
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:20,417
Settle this beef between
the armos and the mexis.

209
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:22,976
Just let Pezuela have
whatever it is that he wants.

210
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:24,626
Just get us off
the hook already.

211
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:25,814
I can't do that.

212
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:28,986
If you think you're gonna
use this box

213
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:31,890
to squeeze your way into keeping
some detective career...

214
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:34,639
Iook, I-I don't have to remind
you of all the bad shit

215
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:36,226
we've been responsible for.

216
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:37,502
You're the one
who wrote it all down.

217
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:39,484
Well, that was
"bad shit volume I."

218
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,193
The next installment has Ronnie
doing Zadofian's murder.

219
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:45,339
Since we're being honest
about things,

220
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:48,377
it means we're all
blood brothers now.

221
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:52,108
Pezuela's a scorpion.

222
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:55,733
He can and will
unleash a level of violence

223
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:56,960
and corruption in Farmington

224
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,754
that'll turn this place
into little Mexico city.

225
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,328
I can't let that happen.

226
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,599
I don't trust anyone else
to stop him,

227
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:07,058
- including robbery-homicide.
- If it's not Pezuela shitting on the streets,

228
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:09,770
it's going to be
some other asshole!

229
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:12,364
Putting Pezuela away
is a down payment

230
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,240
on me being able to live
with myself.

231
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:18,359
Now, if you can't
understand that,

232
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,242
at least respect it.

233
00:09:22,787 --> 00:09:27,332
Sync: Vine

234
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:34,934
Dutch,

235
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:42,747
I got a call from beth insardi
wanting to know

236
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,623
if I was deliberately
ducking the subpoenas

237
00:09:44,658 --> 00:09:46,294
on the Kleavon Gardner trial,

238
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,616
subpoenas which you
have been intercepting.

239
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:49,755
I want to know why.

240
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,429
- Captain, you've been busy...
- it was my fault.

241
00:09:51,464 --> 00:09:54,136
Uh, Danny was just following
my instructions.

242
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:57,690
Give us a minute.

243
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:08,939
Apparently, Kleavon is defending
himself prose in his murder trial.

244
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:12,004
And I-I just didn't think
you need the stress

245
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,492
of being drawn
into that circus.

246
00:10:13,527 --> 00:10:14,940
Because of my illness?

247
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:16,360
Your last encounter with him

248
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:19,457
landed you facedown
on the stairs and in the hospital.

249
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:24,198
Does Danny know why you had her

250
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:25,428
running interference for me?

251
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:26,387
Of course not.

252
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:27,749
Cops duck subpoenas
all the time.

253
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:28,837
As far as she's concerned,

254
00:10:28,872 --> 00:10:31,519
we were sparing you some
unnecessary aggravation.

255
00:10:31,554 --> 00:10:33,206
I can handle my own affairs.

256
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,454
This guy's had it in for you
from the beginning.

257
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:38,022
He killed a woman
who looked like you

258
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:39,465
just to make his point.

259
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,036
I want this prick to get
the justice he deserves,

260
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:44,023
and if it means
giving a deposition...

261
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:45,354
Kleavon is a confessed serial killer

262
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:46,769
facing the death penalty.

263
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:48,961
What better way to spend
his final days

264
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:50,963
than lobbing shitballs
at you?

265
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:52,986
Let's not humor him.

266
00:10:53,864 --> 00:10:55,960
He's coming in this afternoon.

267
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:58,478
I'll get it over with.

268
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:01,067
Fine.

269
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,007
See if this guy's
part of the chop shop.

270
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:10,960
Yo!

271
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,015
We got a rabbit.
We got a rabbit.

272
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,517
Watch it!

273
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,672
Ronnie, get in front of him.

274
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,266
We're moving to intercept.

275
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,891
Get out of the car!
Let me see your hands!

276
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:27,111
- Get out!
- Get down!

277
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,781
Get down!

278
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,004
Don't move.

279
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,323
"Llewellyn wang"?

280
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:34,275
Farmington grand prix
means you know why we're here.

281
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,635
I had nothing to do
with it, man.

282
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,018
I ain't never even heard
of this missing chick.

283
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,192
Where's the girl?

284
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,200
I don't know.

285
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:43,738
And neither did
those dead homies,

286
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:46,170
but those gusanos
kacked them, anyway!

287
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:47,984
You lost me.

288
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:49,312
We was kicking it.

289
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:50,890
I went out back
to take a leak,

290
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:52,329
and that's when the shit
jumped off.

291
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:53,369
What kind of shit?

292
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:55,285
Four caribbean dudes
showed up,

293
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,060
started sweating everybody
about some cuban girl they're looking for.

294
00:12:58,095 --> 00:13:00,547
My friends were like, "what
the hell you talking about?!"

295
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:03,074
Dudes went at 'em
with knives and shit!

296
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:06,684
You're gonna take us to where
this gangster party went down.

297
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:10,024
They're back there.

298
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:22,731
Vic.

299
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:30,070
Zorro wannabe?

300
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:32,854
From this angle,
I'm reading an "n."

301
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:34,775
Missing girl's name
was noelle.

302
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,693
They weren't wishing him
an early merry Christmas.

303
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:44,955
We're on the record
in the matter of people

304
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,203
vs. Kleavon kwame Gardner.

305
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:48,167
The witness
has been sworn in.

306
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,839
All parties present
have been advised

307
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:52,209
that this deposition
is being videotaped.

308
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:54,033
Please state your name.

309
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,371
Claudette Wyms.

310
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:57,987
Would you describe your
relationship to the defendant?

311
00:13:58,022 --> 00:14:00,226
I investigated the murders
you committed

312
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:02,369
and arrested you for them.

313
00:14:02,404 --> 00:14:03,550
When you say I committed
these murders,

314
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:05,621
what you are expressing
is a personal,

315
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:06,710
very biased opinion.

316
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,534
Enjoy this charade
while you can,

317
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:11,022
because you are gonna be
sentenced to death

318
00:14:11,057 --> 00:14:13,237
for the murders
of pauline walker,

319
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:16,235
Mary simpson, lana gregory,

320
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,681
and all those women you killed
back in texas.

321
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:21,481
Did you interrogate
any other suspects besi...

322
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:23,459
I didn't have to.

323
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:25,947
So you made up your mind
from the jump,

324
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,561
which means that this so-called
investigation

325
00:14:27,596 --> 00:14:31,064
is really just an exercise
in closed-mindedness.

326
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:33,889
Mr. Gardner,
the purpose of a deposition

327
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:36,596
is to ask questions,
not put words in the witness's mouth.

328
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:38,954
I'm just trying to see
how she developed this theory,

329
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:41,411
accusing a black man,
when everybody knows

330
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:43,584
that serial murder
is a white man's crime.

331
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:45,902
Shade's got nothing to do
with it.

332
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:49,563
The evidence pointed overwhelmingly
to you and only you,

333
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:52,009
and let's not forget,
you confessed...

334
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:54,713
we've got it on videotape.

335
00:14:57,988 --> 00:15:00,179
Are you currently taking
any prescribed medication?

336
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:00,983
Don't answer.

337
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:03,843
That's completely irrelevant.

338
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:06,827
Have you ever seen
this before?

339
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:10,638
Let the record show I'm holding
a prescription bottle

340
00:15:10,673 --> 00:15:12,944
recovered from a trash barrel
at miss Wyms' home.

341
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,080
Label reads...

342
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:15,585
"corticosteroid,

343
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,303
"60 milligrams, 3 refills.

344
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:19,343
Patient's name...

345
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:21,567
Claudette Wyms."

346
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:25,360
You son of a bitch.

347
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,526
Echevarria's crew...

348
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:34,494
conducting a q&a about
his missing little girl.

349
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:36,482
What's the next move?

350
00:15:36,517 --> 00:15:37,393
Ronnie and Julien
are out

351
00:15:37,428 --> 00:15:39,755
talking to the local shot
callers on the d. I...

352
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,394
Los mags, One-Niners,
spook street.

353
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:43,796
There's a "get out
of jail free" card

354
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:45,526
for anyone who dimes
the missing car.

355
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:47,574
I just hollered at a buddy
in robbery-homicide...

356
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:51,354
third carjacking in a month
involving sexual assault.

357
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:54,349
So, m.o. Is,
they steal a fresh whip,

358
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:56,302
take it and mommy
for a joyride.

359
00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:58,149
Every boy's dream twofer.

360
00:15:58,184 --> 00:16:00,454
I.c.E. Surveillance capture
any of this on videotape?

361
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:01,942
They're focused
on echevarria.

362
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:04,621
All you should be thinking about
right now is finding this girl.

363
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:05,415
Hey, darling,

364
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,025
I don't need you or anybody else
managing my thought process.

365
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,261
Uh, think maybe we should have
a talk with Deena?

366
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:12,940
Doesn't feel like her stilo.

367
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:14,551
No, but grand theft auto...

368
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:15,735
she knows all the players,

369
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,797
and we need all the information
we can get.

370
00:16:19,456 --> 00:16:21,360
We'll be in touch.

371
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:33,148
Deena!

372
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:55,330
Put the gun down!

373
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:56,545
Drop the gun!

374
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,587
Drop the gun,
God damn it!

375
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,942
You stupid bitch!

376
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:03,687
God damn it, Deena!

377
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:04,560
Sorry.

378
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:07,824
Were you taking
this steroid medication

379
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,364
at the time
of my interrogation?

380
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:11,581
You are way over the line.

381
00:17:11,713 --> 00:17:13,956
Goes to her
state of mind.

382
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,850
My reading of the law books
says that this is relevant.

383
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,379
Were you on drugs
at the time

384
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:20,798
of this alleged confession
you mentioned?

385
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,643
Please keep in mind,
you are under oath.

386
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:25,365
I need a bathroom break.

387
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,631
Hmm, not surprising.

388
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:31,010
Frequent urination is one
of the less dangerous side effects.

389
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:32,311
Claudette?

390
00:17:33,206 --> 00:17:33,890
Okay, okay.

391
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:35,783
You need to shut this down
right now.

392
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:38,014
He's entitled
to conduct discovery.

393
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:39,629
What is she on meds for?

394
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:40,832
You need to talk toher
about that.

395
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:41,531
How serious?

396
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:42,994
She doesn't need
her medical history

397
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,634
to become an issue
for the department.

398
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:46,569
I could get the judge
to seal the transcripts.

399
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:48,421
They'll be unsealed
when this goes to trial,

400
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:51,859
used to attack her credibility
in all cases.

401
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:54,318
And that's our system,
isn't it?

402
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:58,209
Who is this guy?

403
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,424
Just a guy I've been
working with lately.

404
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:01,983
Accomplice,
in other words.

405
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:04,374
I came back from a run,
and I found him like that.

406
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:07,693
Busted out the shotgun
when I heard you rolling up.

407
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:09,103
I did say sorry, right?

408
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:12,223
The people responsible are
looking for a silver nissan 300.

409
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,157
You know anybody who traffics
in a load like that?

410
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:15,013
Could have been anyone.

411
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:16,541
There's a lot of
demand for Jap cars.

412
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:18,612
The jackers have been
targeting females.

413
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:19,821
They grab the car,

414
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:21,367
help themselves to the cooch.

415
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:22,999
You know anyone who rolls
like that?

416
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,281
Ghost town piru's been boosting
for initiation lately.

417
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:27,784
So has hollis lane.

418
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:31,442
I liked him.

419
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,800
He could have been
the one.

420
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:37,755
We were talking about getting
out of the game.

421
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:42,249
I'd think about sticking
to that plan, even without him.

422
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:44,635
You became quite ill during
my interrogation,

423
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,218
as I recall... disoriented,

424
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:48,431
unsteady on your feet.

425
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:49,741
It was not serious.

426
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:52,751
Well, you started bleeding
heavily from your nose.

427
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:53,836
Had to leave the room.

428
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:55,258
I saw you fall down
a flight of stairs,

429
00:18:55,293 --> 00:18:57,097
or don't you
remember that?

430
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:00,355
60 milligrams...

431
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,431
that's a high dosage
of a very powerful drug.

432
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:05,152
You're not
a medical expert.

433
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,352
Well, I'm not a lawyer,
either,

434
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:09,353
but the court says I'm competent
enough to argue my case.

435
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:12,455
Are you aware some
of the side effects

436
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,287
of long-term
steroid use include

437
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:20,493
confusion, hallucination,
paranoia, psychosis?

438
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:23,804
Do you suffer from any
of these side effects?

439
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,207
No.

440
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:27,790
Just before you had
taken ill,

441
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:31,628
before the blood started
pouring out of your nose,

442
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:34,468
you had told me
that my sister Fatima...

443
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:36,220
I'm reading
from the transcript here...

444
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:38,891
was found "strangled and dumped
in an alley."

445
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:40,401
But that wasn't the case,
was it?

446
00:19:40,436 --> 00:19:42,447
It's a standard
interview tactic

447
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,726
used to mislead a suspect
with disinformation

448
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:48,136
in order to get the truth.

449
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:49,784
Was that a tactic,

450
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:52,855
or were you
having a hallucination?

451
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,845
Because I saw Fatima downstairs
a little while later.

452
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,777
What you're doing is more
prejudicial than probative.

453
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:00,184
I don't know
what that means.

454
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:03,426
It means that you're gonna stop
this irresponsible line of questioning.

455
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:05,993
I was told by this woman

456
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:07,987
that my sister had been murdered.

457
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:09,263
I was overcome with grief.

458
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:10,824
I might have said some things
I didn't mean

459
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,376
because I wasn't
in my right mind.

460
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,727
Now, if my emotional distress
was caused

461
00:20:14,762 --> 00:20:18,391
by a mentally disturbed person
on drugs,

462
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,434
that's something the jury
needs to know.

463
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,532
You attack my credibility
all you want.

464
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,039
It still won't get you off,

465
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:26,444
not with all the other evidence
we got against you.

466
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:32,025
Evidence collected by a heavily
medicated police detective in a station...

467
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,062
now under the command
of that same paranoid,

468
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:37,044
delusional psychotic who's now

469
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,835
been promoted tocaptain.

470
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,378
You've got to ask yourself
how credible that evidence really is.

471
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:45,533
Can we go off the record?

472
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:50,526
You are putting on
quite a show.

473
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:51,982
Thank you.

474
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:54,042
You think you're gonna get
acquitted?

475
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:55,578
Think again.

476
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:58,824
You're gonna go down for
those murders, no matter what!

477
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,448
Might as well take some folks
down with me... or not.

478
00:21:02,483 --> 00:21:04,939
- It all depends.
- On what?

479
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,499
I want the death penalty
off the table.

480
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:12,714
You drag me through the mud
all you want.

481
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:15,277
I'm gonna live
to watch you die.

482
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:18,252
If word of your unstable
mental condition gets loose,

483
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:19,667
they'll have you
out the door faster

484
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:21,636
than you can say
"Mark fuhrman."

485
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,365
Job you're in...

486
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,342
it's all about credibility.

487
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:27,109
You deserve the same fate

488
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:30,435
as all those women
you put in the ground.

489
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,034
I'm a different man now,

490
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:33,534
fallen in love with a woman

491
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:36,946
that I've been in correspondence
with since my incarceration.

492
00:21:36,981 --> 00:21:39,606
I'm looking forward to spending the rest
of my natural life with her.

493
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:42,428
Even more reason to put you down
like a sick animal

494
00:21:42,463 --> 00:21:46,543
now that you got
something to lose.

495
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,617
Another potty break?

496
00:21:58,448 --> 00:21:59,925
You're not gonna cave in
to this stunt!

497
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,085
The slightest whiff
of doubt,

498
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,440
juries back off of capital
punishment in a heartbeat.

499
00:22:03,475 --> 00:22:04,746
- There is no doubt.
- He's got a story.

500
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,139
- That's all that matters.
- Don't do this, beth.

501
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:09,307
It's not your call to make.

502
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:12,194
I got to use your phone,
run this past the bosses.

503
00:22:14,474 --> 00:22:16,724
Lyor chotzen
left a message.

504
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,460
He'll meet you
at Los perditos.

505
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:19,765
Thanks.

506
00:22:20,268 --> 00:22:21,252
Chotzen...

507
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:24,266
the FBI profiler that worked the
Kleavon Gardner case for you?

508
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,442
Yeah.

509
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,502
With Kleavon
back in the house,

510
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:28,195
got me thinking
I should talk to chotzen

511
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,642
about the Lloyd denton
shooting.

512
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:31,321
We already went
at that brat once.

513
00:22:31,356 --> 00:22:32,908
You keep hauling him
in here,

514
00:22:32,943 --> 00:22:34,539
his mom's gonna figure out
you suspect him

515
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:35,835
as Jack the ripper Jr.

516
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,661
That's where you're wrong.

517
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:38,007
I'm not trying to arrest
the kid.

518
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:40,253
I'm just trying
to help him.

519
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:42,893
You want to beat a dead horse,
do your thing.

520
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:46,211
I got enough paperwork
to wipe my ass for a year.

521
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:48,151
Vic, did you sign
that document for me?

522
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,387
The, uh, quit claim
on paternity for Lee.

523
00:22:51,422 --> 00:22:53,402
Oh, I haven't had a chance
to read it.

524
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:54,148
Could you make the time?

525
00:22:54,183 --> 00:22:55,925
My lawyer wants to file it
by the end of the week.

526
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,662
What's the rush?

527
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,191
I just want to get
it done, okay?

528
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:02,236
What now?

529
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:04,444
Cassidy's been suspended
from school.

530
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,604
I give up.

531
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:06,850
Suspended? For what?

532
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,776
She and her friends were
at some "pimps 'n ho's" party.

533
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:11,568
All the girls had
to wear lingerie.

534
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:12,840
Pimps 'n ho's?

535
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,175
Yeah, some kid posted
their pictures on the internet.

536
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,209
These girls were dressed
in their underwear,

537
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:18,442
traipsing around
in front of the boys.

538
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:20,551
- It was revolting.
- Where's cass now?

539
00:23:20,586 --> 00:23:21,879
Home.

540
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:24,007
There were drugs involved.

541
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:26,065
Jesus Christ.

542
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,778
She wouldn't even
have admitted it to me

543
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:30,552
if I didn't threaten to drag
her here for a urine test.

544
00:23:30,587 --> 00:23:32,112
What kind of drugs?

545
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:33,114
Ecstasy.

546
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:35,481
She claims it was
her first time.

547
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:36,574
Who gave them to her?

548
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:37,870
She won't tell me.

549
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:39,236
I just don't know
what else to do.

550
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:40,419
I sure as hell do.

551
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:42,229
Who organized this party?

552
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:44,430
I'm not sure, but I spoke to one
of the other mothers,

553
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,686
and she said it was at this boy
mickey dightman's house.

554
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:49,374
There are pictures of him
on the same website,

555
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:51,384
and he's smoking a joint.

556
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,678
All right, listen,
I got this.

557
00:23:53,713 --> 00:23:55,350
I'll call you later, okay?

558
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:59,853
Intentional or not, that was live ammo
Deena directed our way.

559
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:01,933
There's no way Olivia
could have orchestrated that.

560
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:03,274
So if Deena would have blown
our brains out,

561
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,049
that would have just
been dumb luck?

562
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:06,809
This cuban's
one-day body count

563
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:08,503
is gonna cut our car-theft
numbers in half,

564
00:24:08,538 --> 00:24:11,661
but I want him in custody
or on a plane back to Miami.

565
00:24:11,696 --> 00:24:13,780
You need to decide
how much collateral damage

566
00:24:13,815 --> 00:24:16,458
you're willing to accept
to preserve this I.c.E. Investigation.

567
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:18,554
Well, the sooner we get
the missing girl,

568
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:20,172
the sooner the streets
settle down.

569
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:21,619
Ticktock.

570
00:24:21,654 --> 00:24:24,172
Hey, Vic, unis
just took a statement

571
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:25,885
from a domestic victim
up in observation.

572
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,749
We should follow up.

573
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:30,325
Uh, couples counseling isn't
on my to-do list right now.

574
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,363
Her boyfriend is a gangbanger...

575
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:32,740
priors for car theft.

576
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:36,697
And he was bragging to someone
about running a train on some latina.

577
00:24:36,732 --> 00:24:38,241
What set's
the b.f. Claiming?

578
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,640
Ghost town piru.

579
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,326
I can take a beat-down,
about as tough as any bitch.

580
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:47,629
But I'm done!

581
00:24:47,664 --> 00:24:50,276
This nigger came home
smelling like badussy.

582
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:51,825
I ask him,
"what's up with that?"

583
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,561
He talking about
imust be on crack.

584
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:55,543
Only then I hear him
loud talking to his boy

585
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,878
about how they was running
the old alabama anaconda

586
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,240
up in ol' girl
all day long.

587
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:01,119
Happen to mention
if "ol' girl" was cuban?

588
00:25:01,154 --> 00:25:03,671
Cuban, Mexican...
it's all reggaeton to me.

589
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:06,431
I told him, "you think a sister
gonna be 'bout it, 'bout it"

590
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:09,021
when he got taco stank up
on his black ass?

591
00:25:09,056 --> 00:25:10,510
Think again.

592
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:11,582
Gave me the fist.

593
00:25:11,617 --> 00:25:13,477
Girl's got to draw
the line somewhere.

594
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,116
Any idea where he is
right now?

595
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:16,725
He's probably at his job.

596
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,596
He work around the way,
you know, stealing cars.

597
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:23,100
I've been dreaming about tacos
for the last two weeks...

598
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:25,070
hard to come by
in beijing.

599
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:26,174
You over there on vacation?

600
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:29,876
Paid consultant
to the people's republic of.

601
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:33,591
37 dead females
autopsied premortem.

602
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,938
Chinese law enforcement
is strangely proud

603
00:25:36,973 --> 00:25:38,973
to finally have one of their own
up on the world stage,

604
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:41,978
alongside John wayne gacy
and andrei chikatilo.

605
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:42,819
What's the profile?

606
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:45,090
Organized killer,
male, 20s.

607
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,539
With a billion Chinese,

608
00:25:46,574 --> 00:25:49,011
you're looking for a needle dick
in a haystack.

609
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:50,818
What about you?

610
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:53,803
I got a suspect...
kid, shot an intruder.

611
00:25:54,404 --> 00:25:55,102
You wouldn't be talking
to me

612
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,215
if you thought it was
a one-time thing.

613
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,669
It's not something I want
to be wrong about.

614
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:01,916
He's 16, no obvious
killer symptoms.

615
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:03,231
What about the obvious
precursors?

616
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:04,881
No arson,
cruelty to animals,

617
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,600
or bed-wetting
that I know about.

618
00:26:06,635 --> 00:26:09,089
What's got your antennae
twitching?

619
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:12,856
I think he killed him
just to kill,

620
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:14,090
and if he can do that at 16,

621
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,754
what's he gonna be doing at 25?

622
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:17,349
Want me to talk to him?

623
00:26:17,384 --> 00:26:19,348
Prove me right,
prove me wrong...

624
00:26:19,383 --> 00:26:21,451
I just need to know
what I'm dealing with.

625
00:26:21,486 --> 00:26:22,710
Don't let him know
you're a cop.

626
00:26:22,745 --> 00:26:25,920
I need him to think that I've moved off
the criminal investigation.

627
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:27,360
You bet.

628
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:32,918
So, what, are you gonna show me
those ink-blotch things...

629
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:33,937
ask me what I see?

630
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:35,112
If you want.

631
00:26:35,147 --> 00:26:36,631
Mostly, I'm here to listen.

632
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:38,978
I sat in this room
for like 97 hours,

633
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:42,925
answering the same questions
over and over and over again.

634
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,743
I'm... I'm pretty
talked out.

635
00:26:43,778 --> 00:26:45,384
That was
a police investigation.

636
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,238
This is an opportunity
for you

637
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,197
to conduct one of your own...
into your feelings.

638
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:51,845
I'm gonna give you some room,

639
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,128
keep your mom company.

640
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:59,706
Can I, uh, get you anything
to drink... water, tea?

641
00:26:59,741 --> 00:27:01,256
Oh, no, thank you.

642
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:03,599
I wonder if I should be
up there with him.

643
00:27:03,634 --> 00:27:05,406
Uh, this kind of
therapy works best

644
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:06,535
when you're talking
to a stranger.

645
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:08,212
It's easier to vent
those feelings

646
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:10,041
to a blank screen
rather than to someone

647
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:11,337
who knows everything
about you.

648
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:15,678
Makes sense. I don't know the first
thing about psychiatrists.

649
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:21,506
How's, uh, how's Lloyd been
doing since all this happened?

650
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,803
Surprisingly well,

651
00:27:22,838 --> 00:27:24,666
under the circumstances.

652
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:27,297
Not acting out,
anger, depressed?

653
00:27:27,332 --> 00:27:27,993
Oh, no.

654
00:27:28,028 --> 00:27:30,962
Has he wet his bed...
anything like that?

655
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:32,811
No, my son is 16.

656
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:35,100
The only reason I ask is,
sometimes,

657
00:27:35,135 --> 00:27:37,603
the body wants to rid
negative feelings

658
00:27:37,638 --> 00:27:40,235
the same way it does
other waste products.

659
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,795
Well, no, Lloyd's never had
that problem.

660
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,690
How long is he going
to be up there?

661
00:27:45,725 --> 00:27:48,812
All these shrinks seem to think
an hour's 50 minutes long, so...

662
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,371
well, maybe I will
have that tea.

663
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,831
Silver nissan 300
parked inside.

664
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:03,335
Three guys downstairs,

665
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,088
one guy up in a loft,
poking on something.

666
00:28:06,123 --> 00:28:07,239
I'm guessing that's our girl.

667
00:28:07,274 --> 00:28:09,942
All right, Ronnie, nice work.
Come on down.

668
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:11,824
Kick down the door,
go in guns drawn, badges out,

669
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,519
noelle's gonna know it was
the police to the rescue.

670
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:14,645
And so will her big pa.

671
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,316
That's why we got to make it
look like a robbery

672
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:19,398
by a rival gang... choreograph
it so the girl escapes.

673
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:22,509
No disrespect, but the only set
you guys can claim is aryan nation.

674
00:28:22,544 --> 00:28:24,970
No, I got an idea...

675
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:27,401
only I'm gonna need you
to sell it to Claudette.

676
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:30,008
Coming from any of us,
it'll be a no-go.

677
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,076
Done.

678
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:35,366
It's questionable tactics,

679
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:38,093
high risk to my personnel
andcivilians.

680
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:39,587
The fresh hell
you're proposing

681
00:28:39,622 --> 00:28:41,288
must have come
from the mind of Mackey.

682
00:28:41,323 --> 00:28:43,703
This operation's got a high
degree of difficulty.

683
00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:44,817
We are running out of time,

684
00:28:44,852 --> 00:28:46,344
and I don't have a better idea.

685
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:47,739
I sign off on this insanity,

686
00:28:47,774 --> 00:28:49,116
- here are my terms.
- Bring the pain.

687
00:28:49,151 --> 00:28:53,648
Echevarria's hit squad gets charged here
in Farmington ahead of any federal case.

688
00:28:53,683 --> 00:28:57,192
I need a win after the shit rain
these bastards caused today.

689
00:28:57,227 --> 00:28:57,714
Okay.

690
00:28:57,749 --> 00:28:59,690
And any blowback
from Vic Mackey's

691
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:03,325
voodoo law enforcement is on you.

692
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:09,474
How I'm supposed to trust you after the
shit you pulled with my escalade?

693
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:13,968
You want to feel those fine leather
seats on your ass again or not?

694
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:14,931
No one's gonna see
your face.

695
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,126
You won't have to wear
your own colors.

696
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:17,749
No one except the people
in this room

697
00:29:17,784 --> 00:29:19,803
will know
you were involved.

698
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:22,155
It's bad enough we down
with one time,

699
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,967
but taking flight
on a band of brothers...

700
00:29:24,002 --> 00:29:25,593
spare me
the pan-Africa bullshit.

701
00:29:25,628 --> 00:29:29,351
You guys are out there killing
each other all day, every day.

702
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:31,135
You get a little taste
of black pussy...

703
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,514
now you're an expert
on Africa?

704
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:35,780
Streets is watching, homey.

705
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:39,704
We're supposed to be
strapped, right?

706
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:41,152
You can take your own heaters,

707
00:29:41,187 --> 00:29:42,747
but just for show... no ammo.

708
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:46,157
Officer Lowe will be embedded
with you, and he'll be armed.

709
00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:47,917
The rest of us will cover you
from the perimeter.

710
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,068
Our targets have been
on the bong all day.

711
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:51,699
You go in fast and hard,

712
00:29:51,734 --> 00:29:52,946
they won't know what hit 'em...

713
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:54,992
no one gets hurt.

714
00:29:56,224 --> 00:29:58,734
I mean, now that we're
undercover brothers now,

715
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:00,574
don't you think we need
to be deputized?

716
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:03,780
You know,
make this shit official.

717
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:05,979
All right.

718
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,793
Raise your right hands.

719
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:11,912
Now do this while you do this.

720
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:16,711
Sure, she's like supermom.

721
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:20,373
I mean, she's like a mom
and dad rolled all into one.

722
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:22,189
I feel like I let her down.

723
00:30:22,224 --> 00:30:24,243
See how he's shifting the focus
away from him to his mother?

724
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:27,235
- Consciousness of guilt?
- Possibly.

725
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:31,225
Maybe I should have, like,
dove headfirst

726
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,705
through the window
to get away.

727
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,992
I'd like you to close
your eyes.

728
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:36,719
I gave him a guided image
transference exercise here.

729
00:30:36,754 --> 00:30:38,555
Now, watch what he does.

730
00:30:39,123 --> 00:30:42,485
Tell him what you were feeling
when you pulled the trigger.

731
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,115
This is on you,
you stupid shit.

732
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,461
And this is all your fault,

733
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:49,543
only I'm the one messed up
over it,

734
00:30:49,578 --> 00:30:52,052
- and I don't even know you.
- Blaming the victim to generate sympathy.

735
00:30:52,087 --> 00:30:54,610
But he's also speaking
to his own shadow self...

736
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:57,242
could be interpreted
as an admission of guilt.

737
00:30:57,277 --> 00:30:59,281
Anything else
you'd like to say to him?

738
00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:02,576
Yeah, I'm sorry.

739
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:06,826
I'm just...
I'm really sorry.

740
00:31:10,688 --> 00:31:12,316
Affect and emotional responses

741
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:14,398
are consistent with
post-traumatic stress...

742
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:16,002
remorse, grief,
guilt, anger.

743
00:31:16,037 --> 00:31:16,964
What if it's all an act?

744
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:18,444
Then we're dealing
with a sociopath

745
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,061
with a well-constructed mask
of sanity,

746
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:22,189
but the stats
are against it.

747
00:31:22,224 --> 00:31:23,941
Most serial killers
don't come online

748
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:25,429
until they're in their 20s
or 30s.

749
00:31:25,464 --> 00:31:27,336
You think I'm pissing
in the wind here?

750
00:31:27,897 --> 00:31:29,620
There's something off
with this kid.

751
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:32,218
I just can't tell you
what it is.

752
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:37,218
Death penalty's
off the table,

753
00:31:37,253 --> 00:31:39,971
contingent on you
pleading guilty to all charges

754
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:42,287
and stipulating
to life without parole.

755
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:46,275
I can live with that.

756
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,821
If there's a God in heaven,

757
00:31:47,856 --> 00:31:49,756
you'll catch a shank
to the throat,

758
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,419
choke to death
on your own blood,

759
00:31:51,454 --> 00:31:52,826
miserable and alone.

760
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:55,241
When I get back
to my cell,

761
00:31:55,276 --> 00:31:57,536
I'm gonna call my girl...

762
00:31:57,571 --> 00:31:59,453
pop the question.

763
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:10,137
We all understand
what we're doing here?

764
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:11,088
Look, ain't no thing.

765
00:32:11,123 --> 00:32:13,048
This is how we ride 24-7, my nig.

766
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,566
Throw it out... now.

767
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,178
Just trying to cover up
the smell of bacon.

768
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:19,454
Hey, do what he says,
homey.

769
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:21,299
I need your mind right
on this one,

770
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:23,607
and I'm trying to hang on
to this car.

771
00:32:24,113 --> 00:32:26,425
Okay, Vic,
we're all in position.

772
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,219
All right,
let's get this done.

773
00:32:28,897 --> 00:32:30,388
Wes, wes, y'all.

774
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,981
Hey, hey, my man,
how you doing?

775
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,276
Look, how much I got to drop

776
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:46,126
if I want to floss the load
with some sprewells on dubs?

777
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:48,001
Burnout, Burnout.

778
00:32:54,879 --> 00:32:55,933
Don't move!

779
00:32:55,968 --> 00:32:56,711
Get down!

780
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:58,147
Get down!

781
00:32:58,905 --> 00:32:59,873
Hey, come on!

782
00:33:03,464 --> 00:33:05,365
Where the scrilla
and the cush at?

783
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,837
My man asked you
a question!

784
00:33:06,872 --> 00:33:08,093
Hey, load up them rims!

785
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:09,301
Load them up!

786
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,245
Get dressed, bitch.

787
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,405
Yo, look at what I found.

788
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,405
Oh, sugar walls
found us a new bbc!

789
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,139
Let me see what I'm working
with here.

790
00:33:46,503 --> 00:33:48,442
You dented the rims!

791
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:49,510
Let me hit that, dog!

792
00:33:49,545 --> 00:33:50,584
That's money, nigger!
That's money over there!

793
00:33:51,468 --> 00:33:53,774
Let me crank that bitch!
Come on, man!

794
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,830
- Help me, please!
- You okay?

795
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:02,097
Go, go, go!

796
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,148
Danny's got the girl.

797
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:06,775
All right, move in. Move in.

798
00:34:11,354 --> 00:34:13,473
Hands in the air!

799
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:15,868
Head down on the ground!

800
00:34:15,903 --> 00:34:18,388
Stay where you're at right now!

801
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,696
Stay where you're at!

802
00:34:25,406 --> 00:34:27,953
Counselor,
moment of your time.

803
00:34:29,555 --> 00:34:30,903
I understand
you're an attorney now.

804
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:34,058
Not sure if that's a step up or
a step down from doing murder.

805
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,868
You got jokes.

806
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:39,283
I was wondering if you'd be willing
to help me out on another matter.

807
00:34:39,318 --> 00:34:40,963
What's in it for me?

808
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:42,794
Spoken like a true lawyer.

809
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:45,770
It's a 16-year-old kid. He's
got himself into a situation.

810
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:47,259
I could use your expertise,

811
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,191
help me figure out
what I'm dealing with.

812
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:53,322
Or I could just ship you back
to county in time for dinner.

813
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:56,572
I'm just...
I'm really sorry.

814
00:34:57,778 --> 00:35:00,347
Anybody reached out to you
when you were his age,

815
00:35:00,382 --> 00:35:03,010
with an arsenal of help
and understanding,

816
00:35:03,045 --> 00:35:06,084
do you think you might have channeled
your energies in a different direction?

817
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,079
Don't get it twisted, man.

818
00:35:07,114 --> 00:35:10,809
Everybody is born into this world
with their own set of gifts.

819
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,929
You grow up, you find out
what you're good at,

820
00:35:12,964 --> 00:35:13,681
and you roll with it.

821
00:35:13,716 --> 00:35:15,770
That's why you're a cop,

822
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:17,731
and I took a different path.

823
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:21,398
We all got to ride or die with what
the good lord meant for us to do...

824
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,067
you, me, and him.

825
00:35:23,102 --> 00:35:25,379
So you're saying, if killing's
this kid's shot in life,

826
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,054
there's no stopping it.

827
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:27,544
There's stopping it.

828
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:28,839
Y'all stopped me, didn't you?

829
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:32,759
All it takes is a pair of cuffs
and a cage to throw him in.

830
00:35:32,794 --> 00:35:36,223
But, yeah, he's got the look.
I seen it before.

831
00:35:36,689 --> 00:35:37,734
Where?

832
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:41,741
In the mirror.

833
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:51,854
Which one of you fine young men
is mickey dightman?

834
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:52,822
What do you want?

835
00:35:52,857 --> 00:35:54,396
Hands behind your back,
mickey.

836
00:35:54,431 --> 00:35:55,525
Hey, what's going on?

837
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,914
I'm taking you in
for questioning.

838
00:35:57,949 --> 00:35:59,365
Stroll!

839
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:01,594
What did I do?

840
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:03,561
That's what you're gonna tell
me, big pimpin',

841
00:36:04,424 --> 00:36:06,496
and you better not
leave out a thing.

842
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:09,385
You can't arrest me
for smoking.

843
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,735
The picture doesn't prove
anything.

844
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,367
I can arrest you for scratching
your tiny little nuggets.

845
00:36:14,402 --> 00:36:15,846
By the time you're done
with booking,

846
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:18,655
fingerprints, mug shots,
transport to juvie,

847
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,822
it'll be 18 hours before they release you
to your mommy and daddy.

848
00:36:21,857 --> 00:36:24,536
And they're gonna love being in
and out of courtrooms

849
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:27,610
for the next year, trying
to clear their baby boy.

850
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:31,246
So, who supplied the drugs?

851
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:33,821
L- I brought one joint
with me.

852
00:36:33,856 --> 00:36:34,853
Where'd you get it?

853
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,459
There's a weed patch
behind the school.

854
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,560
It grows wild.

855
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,838
What about the ecstasy?

856
00:36:38,873 --> 00:36:40,190
I don't do "x."

857
00:36:40,225 --> 00:36:41,694
That's not what I asked you.

858
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:43,640
Who brought it to the party?

859
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,716
I need a name!

860
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:54,984
- What?
- Kid's father's here.

861
00:36:55,483 --> 00:36:56,695
Can you give me a second?

862
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,935
Vic, he's a juvenile.

863
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,066
He has to have a parent present.

864
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:03,085
Go ahead.

865
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,061
What's going on here?

866
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,429
Are you okay?

867
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:08,501
Your son is involved
in a drug investigation.

868
00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:10,965
I had to make sure he was
in a secure environment

869
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,591
for his own safety
before I could notify you.

870
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:16,432
You are involved
with drugs?!

871
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,149
Marijuana and ecstasy.

872
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:21,695
If you can get him
to cooperate,

873
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,043
it'll go a lot easier
on him.

874
00:37:26,385 --> 00:37:30,125
Mickey, you tell this man
what he wants to know...

875
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,597
now.

876
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:36,115
This girl in my grade...

877
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,290
okay, the "pimps 'n ho's" thing
was her idea.

878
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,713
She planned everything,
scored the "x."

879
00:37:41,748 --> 00:37:43,300
The only thing
Cassidy asked me to do

880
00:37:43,335 --> 00:37:45,685
was put together a mix tape
and a couple mash-ups.

881
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:56,858
You've always been
the logical one,

882
00:37:57,248 --> 00:37:58,730
see the whole picture.

883
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:00,521
With what you did to Lem
center foreground.

884
00:38:00,556 --> 00:38:02,448
I always know
where you're coming from.

885
00:38:03,212 --> 00:38:04,832
I'm appealing
to your good judgment,

886
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,616
even though I know
I will forever be

887
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,056
on the wrong end of it.

888
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:09,223
You got that right.

889
00:38:09,258 --> 00:38:12,838
Vic is gonna land
you, me, and him in jail

890
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,781
for the rest of our lives

891
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:16,174
if he keeps going
in this direction.

892
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:17,799
He's doing what it takes
to protect his family.

893
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:19,511
That's one part
of the equation.

894
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:21,813
The other math
goes like this...

895
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:22,919
Vic takes down someone

896
00:38:22,954 --> 00:38:24,902
who's done worse deeds than him,

897
00:38:24,937 --> 00:38:26,950
it balances accounts
for Terry

898
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:30,052
in that big, old box of sins
God keeps on all of us.

899
00:38:30,087 --> 00:38:31,700
I don't believe in God.

900
00:38:31,735 --> 00:38:33,856
Oh, you will, because praying's
the only thing

901
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:36,234
that gets you out of a jail cell
twice a week.

902
00:38:36,754 --> 00:38:37,858
Hey, look.

903
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:41,236
Vic still thinks the world's
worth fixing,

904
00:38:41,271 --> 00:38:42,287
and he's the only one
that can do it.

905
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:43,351
You and me...

906
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:44,871
we're not like that.

907
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,050
This joint is broke for good,

908
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:47,224
and we both know it.

909
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,059
And taking down Pezuela
will not make

910
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:51,726
one goddamn bit of difference
on the streets.

911
00:38:54,105 --> 00:38:55,472
Now, he'll listen to you.

912
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:58,387
Get him to settle this beef,

913
00:38:58,422 --> 00:38:59,435
hand over the box,

914
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:02,418
give everybody a moment's peace.

915
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:06,349
You may hate me,

916
00:39:06,884 --> 00:39:08,809
but you know what I'm saying...

917
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,891
you know it's right.

918
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,647
Short of a confession,

919
00:39:21,682 --> 00:39:23,272
I'm not gonna make this case.

920
00:39:23,307 --> 00:39:24,940
And I can't sweat one
out of him

921
00:39:24,975 --> 00:39:26,646
without alerting the mother
he's a suspect,

922
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:27,903
in which case,

923
00:39:27,938 --> 00:39:32,440
she circles the wagons around her
sweet teen killing machine.

924
00:39:32,475 --> 00:39:34,675
It sounds like you've done
everything you can.

925
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,247
What if everything I've learned
in my career,

926
00:39:37,282 --> 00:39:38,777
everything
I've been through,

927
00:39:39,112 --> 00:39:41,851
is meant to bring me
to this exact place in time,

928
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:44,454
this kid, this case?

929
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:46,385
What happened to the higher
power who put you here?

930
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,120
Why wasn't he there to stop
Lloyd from pulling the trigger?

931
00:39:49,155 --> 00:39:50,530
Who's the better
detective...

932
00:39:50,565 --> 00:39:52,627
someone who arrests the bad guy

933
00:39:52,662 --> 00:39:54,698
after he's killed 30 people,

934
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:56,884
or the one who prevents
30 murders

935
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,340
from happening
in the future?

936
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:01,294
None of us
can see the future.

937
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:04,076
I can give it a shove
in the right direction.

938
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,902
Hey, um, sorry your deposition
went sideways.

939
00:40:13,937 --> 00:40:19,029
In retrospect, burying those
subpoenas was, uh, prudent.

940
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:20,810
Kleavon would have tracked you
down sooner or later.

941
00:40:20,845 --> 00:40:22,154
What's the final word?

942
00:40:22,189 --> 00:40:23,452
Insardi cut the deal.

943
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,019
She gave me
the only deposition tape.

944
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:27,360
She protected me.

945
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:29,481
D.A.'s locking in
the best win they can.

946
00:40:29,516 --> 00:40:31,147
It's not just
about protecting you.

947
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:35,318
Yeah, well, this is the shape
of things to come for me...

948
00:40:35,806 --> 00:40:38,329
more a liability
every passing day.

949
00:40:38,364 --> 00:40:41,344
What were you just saying
about seeing the future?

950
00:40:41,379 --> 00:40:43,791
All I have to do
is look at the present.

951
00:40:43,826 --> 00:40:46,439
If Kleavon
can suss this out,

952
00:40:46,474 --> 00:40:47,774
what happens when a real lawyer

953
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:50,071
decides to tear me apart
in some other case?

954
00:40:50,106 --> 00:40:51,519
You're not a lead
detective anymore.

955
00:40:51,554 --> 00:40:54,661
All you have to do
is manage people here.

956
00:40:55,573 --> 00:40:57,288
Is that what I do now?

957
00:41:08,304 --> 00:41:09,856
Dodged a few bullets
today.

958
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:11,266
Literally.

959
00:41:13,616 --> 00:41:15,946
Just don't know which side
Olivia's on.

960
00:41:15,981 --> 00:41:18,698
Which makes sleeping tonight
as rough as it was last night.

961
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:20,664
I'm not putting my head
on the pillow

962
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:22,586
until I know for sure.

963
00:41:24,513 --> 00:41:26,729
Shane wants me to have
a "come to Jesus" conversation

964
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:28,168
with you about...

965
00:41:28,203 --> 00:41:29,248
about ending the war,

966
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:30,895
turning over the box.

967
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,616
I figured he'd piss
in your ear.

968
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:33,561
It makes sense.

969
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:34,672
He's got a point.

970
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:37,327
We could stop this all
now.

971
00:41:38,483 --> 00:41:41,037
I can't give back
something I don't have.

972
00:41:42,776 --> 00:41:45,439
Aceveda's in possession
of the box,

973
00:41:45,474 --> 00:41:46,993
and he ain't giving it back
to you and me

974
00:41:47,028 --> 00:41:49,309
so we can get cuddly
with the armenians.

975
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:53,877
Besides, if Olivia's been
ratting us out to Pezuela,

976
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:56,104
we've got
even bigger problems.

977
00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:00,255
This stays between us.

978
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,732
It was stand-up of Dutch
to take responsibility

979
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:14,671
for the subpoena-gate,

980
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:17,074
- but I want...
- old business.

981
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:25,792
I'm...

982
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:32,921
I'm not well.

983
00:42:34,476 --> 00:42:36,326
But I'm not done here yet,
either.

984
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:40,194
I, uh, I need someone
I can count on,

985
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:42,322
backstop me full-time,

986
00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:44,748
catch my mistakes.

987
00:42:44,968 --> 00:42:47,324
Anything you need...
just say the word.

988
00:42:48,979 --> 00:42:53,326
How would you like to be
reassigned to me on a permanent basis?

989
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,502
From tuna boat
to goddess duty?

990
00:42:59,122 --> 00:43:01,673
That would work for me.

991
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,968
How much do you know
about lupus?

992
00:43:09,043 --> 00:43:10,247
And we believe this boy?

993
00:43:10,282 --> 00:43:11,951
He was telling the truth.

994
00:43:11,986 --> 00:43:13,423
What are we supposed
to do...

995
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:16,336
handcuff Cassidy to the bedpost
till she's 21?

996
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:18,078
If we have to.

997
00:43:18,113 --> 00:43:20,817
Of course, she can start learning
about consequences the hard way,

998
00:43:20,852 --> 00:43:22,483
- like these people.
- Don't say that.

999
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:25,283
That's not the future I want
for our daughter, either.

1000
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:27,001
She's a good kid.

1001
00:43:27,036 --> 00:43:28,844
She just took a wrong turn.

1002
00:43:28,879 --> 00:43:31,162
She's got to start acting
like a good kid.

1003
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:32,673
I got to go.

1004
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:34,168
Hey, hey.

1005
00:43:34,203 --> 00:43:36,415
I know how to deal
with this, okay?

1006
00:43:39,976 --> 00:43:43,023
My lawyer wants to know where
we are with that quit claim.

1007
00:43:43,058 --> 00:43:44,441
Tell him
I'm not signing it.

1008
00:43:44,476 --> 00:43:45,769
Wait a minute.

1009
00:43:45,804 --> 00:43:47,060
We agreed.

1010
00:43:47,095 --> 00:43:48,171
Maybe in your head.

1011
00:43:48,206 --> 00:43:50,810
You have no idea what it takes
to raise a child.

1012
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:52,852
I knew what I was doing
when I decided to keep Lee.

1013
00:43:52,887 --> 00:43:54,563
You were never a part
of that plan.

1014
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,500
I might not have been a part
of the plan,

1015
00:43:56,535 --> 00:43:58,944
but I was 50%
of the execution.

1016
00:43:59,351 --> 00:44:01,275
You want to see Lee
have a good upbringing?

1017
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,810
Stay out of his life
and sign the damn document.

1018
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:06,497
Hey, just because you've decided

1019
00:44:06,532 --> 00:44:08,331
that me being the father
is a shitty idea

1020
00:44:08,366 --> 00:44:11,260
does not mean that I'm gonna get
behind the even shittier idea

1021
00:44:11,295 --> 00:44:13,590
of abandoning my son.

1022
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:24,435
My mom's in the shower.

1023
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:26,495
Good, 'cause you and I
need to talk.

1024
00:44:27,293 --> 00:44:30,336
We both know it was your plan
all along to kill luis alvarez.

1025
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:32,737
You convinced him to break
into your house.

1026
00:44:32,772 --> 00:44:35,788
You shot him, made sure
you had an airtight story,

1027
00:44:35,823 --> 00:44:37,325
so you could go out
and kill again,

1028
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,683
because that's
what gets you off.

1029
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,906
You might even think you're
gonna get away with it again,

1030
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:44,302
but I'm not gonna
let that happen.

1031
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:46,258
Dutch?

1032
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:49,752
Why do you keep
calling him that?

1033
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,893
Because he's been so helpful
to us.

1034
00:44:54,004 --> 00:44:55,638
Am interrupting
something?

1035
00:44:55,673 --> 00:44:56,949
No.

1036
00:44:56,984 --> 00:44:58,732
Actually,
Dutch just came by

1037
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:00,717
to let us know
that the investigation

1038
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:02,427
is officially closed.

1039
00:45:04,725 --> 00:45:06,311
It's all behind us.

1040
00:45:06,346 --> 00:45:07,980
What a relief!

1041
00:45:27,131 --> 00:45:28,678
Hands where I can see them.

1042
00:45:29,714 --> 00:45:30,961
Drop that.

1043
00:45:37,011 --> 00:45:38,397
You wanted some late-night
alone time,

1044
00:45:38,432 --> 00:45:40,705
you could have invited me
for a cocktail.

1045
00:45:42,633 --> 00:45:44,832
A fed with benefits
isn't on my get list.

1046
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,387
How about that drink?

1047
00:45:46,422 --> 00:45:48,714
I already checked
your well.

1048
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,084
You don't stock my pour.

1049
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:53,530
- Which is...
- surprising...

1050
00:45:53,565 --> 00:45:56,049
you already know
everything else about me.

1051
00:45:56,964 --> 00:45:59,277
I found that
by your bedside.

1052
00:45:59,878 --> 00:46:01,550
Well, girls need nighttime
reading, too.

1053
00:46:01,585 --> 00:46:03,882
How long has Pezuela
had his hooks in you?

1054
00:46:06,862 --> 00:46:08,966
You know all the twists
and turns.

1055
00:46:10,412 --> 00:46:11,637
Do I?

1056
00:46:14,116 --> 00:46:18,319
I got a federal warrant on a racketeering
investigation two years ago,

1057
00:46:18,354 --> 00:46:19,966
seized documents in a...

1058
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:21,646
in a bookmaking takedown.

1059
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:24,175
And you made
those documents disappear,

1060
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,680
because they showed
your brother was in hock

1061
00:46:26,715 --> 00:46:28,680
to a cartel-financed casino.

1062
00:46:28,715 --> 00:46:29,571
Without motive,

1063
00:46:29,606 --> 00:46:31,987
the grand jury dropped the
embezzlement charge against him.

1064
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,009
I kept my brother
out of jail.

1065
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:36,140
Pezuela followed
the treasure trail to you,

1066
00:46:36,175 --> 00:46:38,207
and now you're the one
serving time.

1067
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:40,762
And his doberman, rios,
is your warden.

1068
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:44,170
I thought it was a trade-off
that I could live with.

1069
00:46:44,705 --> 00:46:47,483
My brother's been putting
his life back together.

1070
00:46:47,518 --> 00:46:49,517
Any errands they had me running,
they were minimal...

1071
00:46:49,552 --> 00:46:51,781
record searches, financials.

1072
00:46:51,816 --> 00:46:55,297
They want you to get your fingers really
dirty to set the hook.

1073
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:02,036
Rios told me that I had
to arrange safe passage

1074
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:04,553
across the border
for some people.

1075
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:08,717
So I put in for special assignment
traing down in San ysidro,

1076
00:47:08,752 --> 00:47:11,251
picked up four illegals,

1077
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,964
played it off like I was taking
them to secondary search...

1078
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:16,711
dropped them
at a safe house instead.

1079
00:47:17,116 --> 00:47:20,011
He had you dance with coyotes
for a night. So what?

1080
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:22,610
The next day,

1081
00:47:22,645 --> 00:47:26,354
rios had me shadowing the Salvadoran
body draggings on kearney.

1082
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:29,512
You think it was done
by the guys you brought over.

1083
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:31,823
The timing's hard
to overlook.

1084
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:33,695
And then you gave me
that intel

1085
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:37,107
on the Robert Martin
shooting.

1086
00:47:37,142 --> 00:47:38,796
You couldn't have known.

1087
00:47:39,183 --> 00:47:41,613
They weren't coming here
to pick lettuce.

1088
00:47:41,648 --> 00:47:43,824
I knew enough.

1089
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,304
How much of this
have you fed to rios?

1090
00:47:49,804 --> 00:47:51,677
I've kept you
out of the mix.

1091
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:53,664
Because...

1092
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:56,063
because...

1093
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,630
because I didn't want
to hurt you.

1094
00:47:59,665 --> 00:48:03,218
And at some point, you're gonna
squeeze me for a favor?

1095
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:05,906
I'm in this so deep...

1096
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:11,051
...and I don't know how
to get myself out.

1097
00:48:15,034 --> 00:48:17,615
You're talking
to the right guy.

1098
00:48:17,617 --> 00:48:21,331
