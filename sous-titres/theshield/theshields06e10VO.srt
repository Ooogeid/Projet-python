1
00:00:00,438 --> 00:00:01,740
<i>Previously on "The Shield"...</i>

2
00:00:02,104 --> 00:00:04,427
- Knock it off!
- Got a goddamn lump.

3
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:05,760
I'm not going to go through all my life

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,575
- over this vending machine thing.
- Sure, you are.

5
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,425
- You are my hero.
- Why is that? Hammered?

6
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:11,777
Oh, I'm sorry. I just assumed
the way she talks about you.

7
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:13,508
- So, the dutchman has a shot, then?
- Dutch?

8
00:00:13,608 --> 00:00:16,415
Sure, he's been working that caring
mentor angle like there's no tomorrow.

9
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:17,646
You're loss, my friend.

10
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:33,887
- Did you talk to Shane?
- He killed Lem.

11
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:36,346
I did what I thought
had to be done at the time.

12
00:00:36,446 --> 00:00:38,683
I see you again, and I will kill you.

13
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:41,462
Just imagine every wrong thing
we have ever done.

14
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:44,885
If anything happens to me,
or my wife, or my son...

15
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:48,446
That lands on IAD's doorstep.

16
00:00:48,546 --> 00:00:51,160
- I'm Kesakian.
- I need to speak to the real Kesakian.

17
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:52,236
My father's out of town.

18
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,174
How long do you think
you can keep this a secret?

19
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:55,712
Long enough for a miracle.

20
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:57,548
In the meantime, you think
you're running the show?

21
00:00:57,648 --> 00:00:59,134
You'll be my partner in this country.

22
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:01,423
Matthews putting the most cash
in the peasants pockets.

23
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:02,926
Rezian, he runs the polls.

24
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:04,772
Well, he's the one who's going
to be looking to take over.

25
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:07,341
- You're under arrest. - My people
won't let you get away with this.

26
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:10,399
You don't have people.
Kesakian jr's in charge now.

27
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:11,720
So you're cooing at me.

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,693
Sounds like Shane made a big bust today.

29
00:01:13,793 --> 00:01:15,661
I don't know what kind of
arrangement you 2 have,

30
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:17,344
but just know, when the chips fall,

31
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,392
they always land on
Shane's side of the table.

32
00:01:19,492 --> 00:01:21,051
That cop knows what's going on.

33
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:23,044
He cannot be part of that.
You have to be careful.

34
00:01:23,144 --> 00:01:24,631
You just stay out of my way.

35
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:27,266
I'm going to make you
as miserable as I possibly can.

36
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:30,547
I'll stop by to see how you
start your security job at Northridge.

37
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:33,405
Vic stole from your father.
The armenian money train?

38
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:36,070
Got robbed a few years back?
That was Vic.

39
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,364
They asked me to be a part of it.
When I said no, I became a threat.

40
00:01:39,464 --> 00:01:40,977
I will have to deal with it, too.

41
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:42,635
Wait a second, I didn't tell you that.

42
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,866
But you have told me.
I must finish the job.

43
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,772
San Marcos is officially closed.

44
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:50,671
They got the guys who wielded the
machetes but not the guys who ordered it.

45
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:53,251
Remember the one-armed man
with a suitcase full of cash?

46
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:56,206
I'm a mexican official.
Diplomatic immunity.

47
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:58,810
He was present at the
San Marcos murders.

48
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,080
You want him to stick around and make
sure his $230,000 luggage gets lost.

49
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:06,308
Penzuela's shit is up with
his arm up Aceveda's ass.

50
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:08,627
- Thank you.
- Getting tips from prison,

51
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:11,328
representing a company with
the backing of mexican interests.

52
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:12,873
Now there's a conspiracy?

53
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,489
Why did you kill those
people at San Marcos?

54
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:15,957
Something big's coming up.

55
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,773
There's a dude by the name of Romero,

56
00:02:17,873 --> 00:02:21,323
- we were supposed to leave him alive.
- So, you just cut off his arm?

57
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:23,907
I understand you went to college
with Cruz Pezuela.

58
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:26,810
I'm going to use every second
to find out what's going on here.

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,164
Why those people died, and you didn't,
where that money was going.

60
00:02:30,504 --> 00:02:32,585
And what Pezuela's angle
was in all of this.

61
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,398
I solved this thing before the
quarterly stats were due.

62
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:38,342
You're going to tell me that saving
this place doesn't earn me a spot here?

63
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:41,462
Nothing that happened today is gonna
change what I have to say to the panel.

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,537
I have one more picture.

65
00:02:44,554 --> 00:02:47,557
- That's Aceveda.
- Gun to his head.

66
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:50,463
Rather than stand up
like a man to his attackers,

67
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:52,164
he takes a man's dick in his mouth.

68
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:54,222
Don't think that will play
too well with the voters.

69
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:55,332
Save your job.

70
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:57,478
Let's start digging,

71
00:02:57,975 --> 00:02:59,222
right now.

72
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,478
- Hello? - I'm in your
driveway, come outside.

73
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:14,786
What?

74
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:17,147
Come outside.

75
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:18,733
Vic?

76
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:22,574
You don't want to have this conversation
where your wife and kid could hear.

77
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:48,797
What?

78
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:51,921
My appeals hearing is tomorrow night.

79
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:54,040
Last chance to save my badge.

80
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:57,177
Look, if you're looking for a pep talk,
you came to the wrong man.

81
00:03:57,277 --> 00:03:58,620
No, I didn't.

82
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:04,361
This is you, isn't it?

83
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,926
What is this?

84
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:11,604
I think you know what it is.

85
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:14,631
You and your boyfriend.

86
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:17,440
It's a fake. Photoshop.

87
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:22,081
- This didn't happen.
- Explain that to your voters.

88
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,231
You think you can use some
shitty forgery against me?

89
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:27,953
Man, I'm surprised whoever
pasted this together on his computer

90
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:29,312
didn't give me tits.

91
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:31,477
I'm just looking for a
little help in exchange

92
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:33,483
for bringing this to your attention.

93
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,312
Help, with your review board?

94
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:39,716
Just a nudge, enough to
keep me at the Barn.

95
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:42,550
Well, if you're gonna blackmail
someone, do it right.

96
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:45,978
This picture is a fake.

97
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:48,981
And any other copies that
you're going to hold back

98
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:50,592
are fake.

99
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:18,694
Dr. Gettleman, 6144.

100
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:21,588
Dr. Gettleman, call 6144.

101
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:29,593
That's your guy down at the
end of the hallway, too?

102
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:31,411
I thought it be best.

103
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:33,688
Hospital doesn't mind the muscle?

104
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,988
They acknowledge my father's generosity.

105
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:37,951
They're being sensitive for privacy.

106
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:42,638
He's gotten worse.
They put him on life support.

107
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:46,550
- They say he is just a day or two.
- I'm sorry.

108
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,139
How are you?

109
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,857
The information about the man

110
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:06,620
who robbed our money-laundering
operation is appreciated.

111
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:09,588
But a lot of unanswered
questions to ask.

112
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:12,385
Look, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

113
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:17,690
Things have been pretty quiet for your
crew ever since the fleet shopping ended.

114
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,609
Now, you're off everybody's radar.

115
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:22,052
My father worked hard to
establish that peace.

116
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:25,406
Well, I think it best if we
lay low in any kind of retaliation.

117
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:27,404
You want me to do nothing?

118
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:31,606
Look, a couple of cops end up hurt,
it sets things on fire all over again,

119
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:34,865
and my colleagues,
the feds, they'll jump in.

120
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:36,647
They will hurt business.

121
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:39,117
Now, we will shut down your
pool revenue temporarily.

122
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:45,670
I have no say in what
retaliation will be or when.

123
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:49,035
I've passed information to
my father's associates back home...

124
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:50,416
Is entirely in their hands.

125
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:52,816
Maybe you need to pass
along a little more information.

126
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:55,054
You tell them that
they can just kill 2 cops

127
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:56,738
without it wrecking everything
that we're trying to do here.

128
00:06:56,838 --> 00:06:59,525
Those men stole millions from my father.
I understand that,

129
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:01,547
but we've got to play this game smart.

130
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:04,198
I'm not playing a game, Shane, are you?

131
00:07:11,905 --> 00:07:14,678
I'm just trying to protect
your family's long-term interest.

132
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,088
That's what a good partner does.

133
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,901
Detective Mackey,

134
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,868
Benjamin Web, counsel for Mr. Aceveda.

135
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:37,618
How can I help you?

136
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:41,737
Well, my client so wishes
you to exercise better judgment tonight,

137
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:45,480
but you left him no choice but
respond to your threats.

138
00:07:45,613 --> 00:07:48,943
- The truth is not a threat.
- The legal remedies are 2-pronged...

139
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:51,670
A laundry list of criminal
charges for extortion.

140
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:55,835
Our civil suit will be seeking damages
for defamation to be determined later.

141
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:59,288
Since you approached my client
as a private citizen,

142
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,417
The department will not
provide you with counsel.

143
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:03,744
You'll be forced to flip the
legal bills on your own.

144
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,161
You're ineligible for police pension,
and you'll be out of a job shortly

145
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:09,388
so you'll have to liquidate
your assets to fight this.

146
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,351
Look who's making threats now.

147
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:14,850
Just giving you a little preview of the

148
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,170
next 7 years of legal hell
you're in for, detective.

149
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:20,291
Have a nice night.

150
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,380
You know?

151
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,516
- I need a minute.
- I'll get us another drink.

152
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,123
You branching out to the orient?

153
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,920
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

154
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,838
I need every copy of the picture and I
need the story that goes along with it.

155
00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:52,150
- May be impossible.
- So's our arrangement.

156
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:56,541
I guess I got to go back turn over
those rocks in the San Marcos murders.

157
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:00,779
My connection is only tertiary,
certainly nothing criminal.

158
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,166
Then, why you afraid
of what I might find?

159
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:04,269
Afraid?

160
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:09,282
I have larger interests
I'd like to protect.

161
00:09:10,109 --> 00:09:12,324
Things too big for me to follow?

162
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:16,841
I understand you're a very
effective officer on a street level.

163
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:18,856
I've made some arrests.

164
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:20,318
And I hope many more,

165
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:25,937
but understand you are nothing more
than a fly on one of my many shits.

166
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,746
I'm offering you an opportunity,
not because I fear you,

167
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:33,770
but to save myself the
trouble of having to

168
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,318
take more drastic measures in the future.

169
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:47,606
I'm sorry if I offended you.

170
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:52,306
I may have future jobs for you,
ways you can help me.

171
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:53,468
Good.

172
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,757
Have you talked with our friend?

173
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,877
Have you saved your job?

174
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:01,717
Pictures can be copied, manufactured,

175
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:05,957
I need the original, all the copies
and the story that goes with it.

176
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:10,563
You understand I have to
sell him an end to this,

177
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:14,756
otherwise, I won't have a badge
to do those jobs for you.

178
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:21,047
You'll find I'm a very
good man to work under.

179
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:30,451
This unfortunate series of
events down at the docks,

180
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,876
aren't in your color.

181
00:10:33,723 --> 00:10:37,274
Now, what if I told you I was willing to
help steer you clear of these troubles?

182
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,587
Trusting you is what
landed me in this shithole.

183
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:42,234
Importing untaxed gas landed you here.

184
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:44,605
You...

185
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:48,516
recognize your business lenders?

186
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:55,261
They disappear from our evidence locker,
DIA will be forced to cut a deal.

187
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:57,952
That means months instead of years.

188
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:03,148
Look, I made a bad judgment call
pairing up with Kesakian's daughter.

189
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:05,663
Now, she's got some bad intel
on a couple of innocents

190
00:11:05,763 --> 00:11:08,108
she thinks robbed that
armenian money train.

191
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,488
And I got to stop the bloodshed.

192
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:14,274
So, I just need to know who the boss
in the homeland were sent to do the job.

193
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,856
- And when.
- You backed a woman in this fight.

194
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:18,827
You want these books lost or not?

195
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:23,662
Is it true, her father is near death?

196
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,667
If she is, she'll handle a
retaliation herself,

197
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:36,474
hire locally.
When it's done, she'll make the call.

198
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:39,462
To my friends back home and
she found the problem,

199
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:42,482
- solve it.
- Who will she use to do the whack?

200
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,961
Somebody that's been extremely
loyal to her father.

201
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:48,933
Zadofian will be her choice.

202
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:52,440
- Where can I find him?
- No idea.

203
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:54,474
Betrayal like this,

204
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:57,212
your friends won't be first.

205
00:11:57,502 --> 00:12:01,413
First she'll kill
their children, the wives

206
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,699
and when the pain of that suffering
begins to fade,

207
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,892
she'll kill the men involved.

208
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:16,010

210
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:26,613
I've got 3 DMV listings on
Zadofian in LA county.

211
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:29,842
And, it looks like father
and daughter in whittier

212
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:32,045
and a 45-year-old male in Glendale.

213
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,811
All right, give me Glendale's
license and registration.

214
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:39,169
Ok, R.E. Zadofian, 03 Lexus black

215
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:40,789
registered to a PO box.

216
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:43,136
All right, I stake a notify on the
Lexus. It's urgent,

217
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:45,671
so I want you to pass it along
to Wilshire and Pasadena.

218
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:47,348
Sure thing.

219
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,552
I was buying your denial
about the photo,

220
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:56,174
but that doberman you sent
give away your hand.

221
00:12:58,067 --> 00:12:59,334
What now, huh?

222
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,308
Pictures of me screwing the bush twins?
No,

223
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:07,455
the original memory stick that Wanda
downloaded the picture onto

224
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:09,348
and every existing copy.

225
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:12,768
Juan Lozano. Low level Byz Lats banger.

226
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:15,899
I had some run-ins with
him and so did you.

227
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:17,601
You shot his buddy during a holdup.

228
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:20,245
Later on, Lozano got
his skull crushed in county,

229
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:23,111
but you knew all that.

230
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,372
He had a gun to my head

231
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:34,346
- and my wife, my daughter.
- Stop, I don't need to hear this.

232
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:37,008
Do you know where I got these pictures?

233
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,466
Cruz Pezuela

234
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:45,371
in exchange for not looking into his
involvement in the San Marcos murders

235
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:47,311
and favors to be named later.

236
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:50,364
He spoke to me like I was
one of his errand boys.

237
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,199
- Cruz?
- You wonder how a photo

238
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,948
from a Byz Lats banger
winds up in his hands?

239
00:13:55,113 --> 00:13:58,284
Why the mexican and american
government officials tried to stop

240
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:00,635
- the San Marcos investigations?
- Wait, Cruz?

241
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:03,523
He's head deep in 11 San Marcos murders.

242
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:05,823
His buddy, he went to college with

243
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:09,030
was the sole survivor,
who lost an arm in the attacks.

244
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,351
So, that's your price for my help?
Cruz is into some dark shit,

245
00:14:15,393 --> 00:14:18,428
and I'm going to need my badge
more than 3 days to prove it.

246
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,258
The review board.

247
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:22,699
Well, I can't help with that.

248
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:25,376
It's too late and it goes
too far up the ladder.

249
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:30,884
You can do something to help me.

250
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,910
- Claudette.
- Yes?

251
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,416
You still have Eduardo Romero's
briefcase of cash?

252
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,025
- All $230,000 of it. - I would
like you to release it to Romero

253
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,871
as soon as possible.

254
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:48,207
- And why would I do that? - The money
is connected to the San Marcos murders.

255
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:51,445
Vic feels following it will expose
a bigger cover up.

256
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:54,578
You want me to put up a
quarter million dollars on the street

257
00:14:54,678 --> 00:14:56,632
for someone who's out of here in 3 days?

258
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:59,222
I understand the case
is officially closed.

259
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,005
Closing it it saved this place.
There's no desire to open it back up.

260
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:05,426
You know, this goes higher
than 3 churros with machetes.

261
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:13,720
Ok, off the books,
and if this blows up, it's on you.

262
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,208
I'll call Romero's attorney
and arrange it.

263
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,821
Just let Vic know the
when's and where's.

264
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,502
- You make a new friend?
- No.

265
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,738
They're going to be a surprise
at the review board tonight?

266
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:29,854
- Shouldn't be.
- Hope not.

267
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,349
All units, please be advised
detective Vendrell, Farmington division,

268
00:15:37,514 --> 00:15:41,496
has issued a stake and notify
for a black 2003 Lexus Sedan

269
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:45,885
plate number 2 William Queen Ida 332.

270
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:50,469
Driver is an Ari Zadofian,
45-year-old male wanted for questioning.

271
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:03,533
- Yeah? - You hear that
notify Shane just issued?

272
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:07,464
- More armenian mob play.
- Whatever it is, it doesn't concern us.

273
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:10,296
Look, I got to go.

274
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,668
- Hey.
- Hey.

275
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:18,064
- Thanks for bringing it.
- Sure, sorry. I forgot it last time.

276
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,824
Hey, you two kids have a good
time at grandma's this weekend, ok?

277
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:22,798
- Yes, daddy.
- Love you, Matty.

278
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:26,638
You, too, baby. Who's a big girl?

279
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:30,498
Listen, I shouldn't be home too late
if you want to give Cass a call.

280
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:32,657
Yeah? Thanks.

281
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:11,201
- Hello.
- Hey, I got a hit on your Lexus,

282
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:15,429
1 tango 16 just spotted in little Armenia.
Do you want me to have them intercepted?

283
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:18,443
No, no, no.
Just give me the address.

284
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:32,855
- Hello.
- We need to talk.

285
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:34,799
Yeah, look, I'm a little
tied up right now.

286
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:37,478
The man you're looking for
is no longer where you are.

287
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:40,616
I want to discuss a
solution to our problem.

288
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:54,444
$230,000.

289
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:59,472
I just need your signature.

290
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:03,071
With all your delays you
won't mind if we forget to say gracias.

291
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:56,091
The doctors think it's best to turn off
the machines. Let him go peacefully.

292
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,174
- I said no.
- What I've told you about those cops,

293
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:05,758
- Mackey, Gardocki, I was wrong.
- The facts were wrong

294
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:08,919
- or you were wrong to tell me?
- It's complicated.

295
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,521
The fight is between me and them,
their family shouldn't be hurt.

296
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:14,833
We can't separate the ones we love
from the choices we make.

297
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:16,867
It didn't have to be that way.

298
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:19,449
You're the one making the decisions now.

299
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,681
- You need to accept the fate of your
associates. - No, I can't.

300
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:24,589
I can't do that.

301
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:27,289
- You said you had a solution.
- This is the solution,

302
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,950
they get punished for their betrayal,
you get punished for yours.

303
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:35,395
You really thought that I wouldn't
find out who you went to?

304
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:39,041
You can't kill Vic's wife and kids.

305
00:19:40,536 --> 00:19:42,006
Sorry.

306
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:47,128
No, no, no!

307
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,182
One step forward and I swear to god
I'll snap his goddamn trachea.

308
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:51,424
Don't hurt him.

309
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,525
We can't distance the ones we love
from the choices we make, right? Huh?

310
00:19:55,463 --> 00:19:58,170
Give me my gun. Now,
or, I swear to god, I'll end his life.

311
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,041
Give it to me.

312
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:04,117
Yours, too, let's go, right now.

313
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:07,027
Hands on your head.

314
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,843
What's this?

315
00:20:09,437 --> 00:20:11,252
Thanks for the smokes.

316
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,348
No, no, no. No, no, no.

317
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:20,508
Zadofian will finish him, too.

318
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:23,317
Get a nurse. Get a nurse!

319
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:57,545
Vic, come on, man, pick up the phone!
This is Mackey. Leave a message.

320
00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:59,356
God damn it!

321
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:56,571
Hello.

322
00:21:57,197 --> 00:22:00,279
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. I, um,

323
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:04,387
work right down the street, and I got
this letter that was addressed to here.

324
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:07,610
- Thank you.
- Sure.

325
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:13,010
I didn't see a sign out front,
didn't know was in here.

326
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,802
- Oh, we're a very small company.
- Really? What do you sell?

327
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,791
- We're a marketing service provider.
- Really? What kind of service?

328
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:21,554
Oh, I just answer the phones.

329
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:23,870
- Please?
- Sure.

330
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:27,609
Mr. Angolas, he owns the place?

331
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:30,145
His name is on the letter.

332
00:22:31,428 --> 00:22:35,074
- Right.
- Do you have a copier here?

333
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:38,693
- What? - Copier. That's
what I do, I sell copiers.

334
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:40,730
How's yours treating you?
You mind if I take a look.

335
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,345
- It'll just take a second.
- No, sorry.

336
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,381
Listen, I'm so far behind
on my sales this month,

337
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,269
you'd be doing me such a big favor,
if I could just take a quick look.

338
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:50,917
- I'll list you as a service contact.
- Look,

339
00:22:51,097 --> 00:22:53,996
- I'm really not supposed to have anybody
here, please. - 10 seconds. 10 seconds.

340
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:55,956
You really need to leave, right now.

341
00:22:56,056 --> 00:22:58,926
I can give you a great deal
on a Pentair 5150

342
00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:01,660
staples sort,
autofold, all the bells and whistles.

343
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,005
Please.

344
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:07,567
I guess this isn't a copy room.

345
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:11,009
Sit up.
I'm a cop.

346
00:23:11,198 --> 00:23:12,869
- You see?
- What you want?

347
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:16,374
Everything there is to know about this
and what goes on around this place.

348
00:23:16,474 --> 00:23:18,165
- I just answer the phones.
- Who calls?

349
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:19,365
I don't know.

350
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:23,000
A few minutes ago, a
one-armed man was in here.

351
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,039
He dropped off of bag
with $200,000 in it.

352
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,452
- I don't know anything about that.
- Money laundering, conspiracy,

353
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:32,158
illegal transfer of currency
out of the country,

354
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:35,772
you'll do time for just picking up
the phone and saying hola.

355
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:37,730
Now, who is under all this

356
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,701
and what does he do?

357
00:23:39,936 --> 00:23:43,675
I've only been here a month.
We're from Mexico City.

358
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:46,961
He was in military
intelligence or something.

359
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:49,934
- He offered me a job.
- Answering phones?

360
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:53,423
Better than swallowing verga gringo
at the club I danced in back home.

361
00:23:55,873 --> 00:23:58,689
So, he keeps his oral
recreation in house.

362
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,671
What's all this for?
The electronics.

363
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:05,222
All I know is that he's
some kind of consultant.

364
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:08,286
- Security or something.
- Where was he just headed?

365
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:12,099
To the bank. He has an important
meeting with the client tonight.

366
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,480
- Who's the client?
- I don't know.

367
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:20,549
He doesn't say much to me usually.

368
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:24,228
No, I think listening is
what you do best.

369
00:24:25,526 --> 00:24:27,169
Here's how it goes,

370
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:29,234
you forget that you ever saw me

371
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:32,153
or I tell your boss
that you took me on a little tour of his

372
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:34,625
closet full of guns and goodies.

373
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,908
Entiendes?

374
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:57,917
Just in time.

375
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,359
Where is our guy
Aaron Boles, you see him?

376
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:04,450
He's 200K light.

377
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:06,137
What did you learn about him?

378
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:08,249
Aaron Boles was a
mexican intelligence officer

379
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:10,585
assigned to investigate the cartels.

380
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:12,728
But he was fired a year ago.

381
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:15,678
The speculation was he switched sides.

382
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,247
- What's Pezuela's connection to him?
- I don't know.

383
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,946
What's your relationship
with Pezuela like now?

384
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,503
Strained.

385
00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:28,212
When I heard your suspicions,
I started to distance myself.

386
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:31,177
I didn't cash a large check
he wrote to my political committee.

387
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:33,770
Pezuela never would've given me
that picture unless he had something

388
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,246
far more valuable to protect.

389
00:25:36,764 --> 00:25:38,782
You have to get close to him again.

390
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:41,556
I'm already playing russian roulette,
by not cutting all my ties with Cruz.

391
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:45,917
And you're going down the political toilet
with him unless we do the flush first.

392
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:49,720
Pezuela gave me the picture knowing
I would go straight to you.

393
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,741
Having the ammunition to screw you
only gave you one place to run for cover.

394
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:57,388
Right back to him. He needs
something. A favor.

395
00:25:58,202 --> 00:26:00,705
Something that ties into all this.

396
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:10,258
This is the memory stick
and every last copy of the picture.

397
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:12,997
It's all yours.

398
00:26:16,518 --> 00:26:18,692
I can't tackle Cruz alone.

399
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:21,931
So there's got to be trust, all right?

400
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,818
You mind if I kill the A/C?

401
00:26:34,513 --> 00:26:36,558
Freon gives me a headache
ever since I played

402
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:38,768
peacemaker between Mackey and Kavanaugh.

403
00:26:43,408 --> 00:26:45,192
So, how was your night last night?

404
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,399
Fine. Yours?

405
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:50,935
Entertaining.

406
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:01,004
Excuse me one moment,

407
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:03,829
the witness over here
saw a white male, 20's,

408
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:06,385
Just dumped the body
from his truck and take off.

409
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:08,560
- Get a plate number?
- No, pealed off too quickly.

410
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,372
- ID of the victim?
- Joe Barnes.

411
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:14,939
It's Miracle Joe.

412
00:27:15,245 --> 00:27:16,885
Oh, Jesus, no.

413
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:18,765
Yeah, it really sucks.

414
00:27:19,258 --> 00:27:20,885
Who's Miracle Joe?

415
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,936
He lived on the streets of
Farmington for 20 years,

416
00:27:24,054 --> 00:27:27,888
survived riots, earthquakes,
gunshots, stabbings, beatings.

417
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:31,421
Always had that crazy grin.
Jokes never made any sense.

418
00:27:31,521 --> 00:27:33,021
Uh, ma'am?

419
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:36,604
- You saw who did this?
- Teenager who works for Ray Stodds

420
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:39,066
drove up
and dumped his body from the truck

421
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:41,976
- like he was a bag of garbage.
- Who's Ray Stodds?

422
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:44,967
Charges us a fee to beg
the freeway off ramps.

423
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:49,200
You don't pay, his guy comes by,
smacks you up, empties your pockets.

424
00:27:50,805 --> 00:27:51,900
Thank you.

425
00:27:55,186 --> 00:27:56,187
Hey!

426
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:59,850
I've got nothing to say
to you or your wife, ok?

427
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,974
- Where's Matt and Meagan?
- None of your business.

428
00:28:02,074 --> 00:28:04,324
- Where are they, Corrine?
- Not here.

429
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,066
Look, I know this is going to
sound crazy, but

430
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,706
you both... You need to
come with me, ok?

431
00:28:07,806 --> 00:28:09,658
- Why? What's going on?
- Shane, what are you doing here?

432
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:12,243
- Does Vic even know you're here?
- I can't tell you anything more, ok?

433
00:28:12,352 --> 00:28:14,411
- Well, you better tell me more. - Just
get in the back of the van right now

434
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:16,573
- or someone's going to kill you and
your goddamn kid. - Call dad.

435
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:20,433
Call dad, fine, but I've been trying to
for the last hour. He's in the field.

436
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:22,117
Fine. I'll call the Barn.

437
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:24,561
You're in danger because of Vic.
You bring the Barn into this,

438
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,931
he will not just be losing his job, he
will be going to jail. Do you get that?

439
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,411
- This more of your shit, huh?
- Listen...

440
00:28:31,896 --> 00:28:35,269
- Jesus Christ.
- Get in, now, please. Look,

441
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:38,270
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- Then put that away.

442
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:41,449
- Corrine, get in the van.
- Ok. Get in. Get in, Cass, get in.

443
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:51,649
Hey, Dutch,

444
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:55,737
I got a composite of the guy the witness
saw dumping Miracle Joe's body.

445
00:28:56,957 --> 00:28:59,679
Uh, have some unis spread it around.

446
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,747
Hey, who's this?

447
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:06,873
That is the nephew Miracle Joe was
always talking about seeing some day.

448
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:08,363
Found it in his wallet.

449
00:29:08,607 --> 00:29:11,170
Going to run his name through
county register, see what matches up.

450
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,158
Great.

451
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:17,721
So I heard Gina and Kevin
hooked up last night.

452
00:29:18,112 --> 00:29:19,364
Really?

453
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:21,454
Dutch.

454
00:29:23,237 --> 00:29:25,412
A couple of unis said you were there...

455
00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:27,495
watching.

456
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,470
Ok. I was tricked into being there.

457
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:35,161
I'm sure Billings did that,
but I can't prove it.

458
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:37,861
I'm sorry.

459
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:42,389
I thought, maybe, you had
a thing for her.

460
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,028
It was a crush, nothing deep.

461
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:49,160
What about you? Maybe a
little bit into Hiatt?

462
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,625
No, not really.
I was just...

463
00:29:52,806 --> 00:29:56,592
I think I just wanted to prove to myself
that I could still get my girl on,

464
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,951
now that I'm a mom.

465
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:00,524
Serves us both right, for

466
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:02,967
succumbing to our shallower instincts.

467
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:14,775
I understand you're expanding
your business enterprises, Ray.

468
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:19,875
Charging the homeless a panhandle
tax, that's real upstanding.

469
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:23,076
Never underestimate how low
people stoop to make a buck.

470
00:30:25,854 --> 00:30:27,481
That can't be easy.

471
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:31,079
- Everybody talking.
- I just can't believe Dutch watched.

472
00:30:31,338 --> 00:30:32,809
He was tricked.

473
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:35,907
Someone used you and Kevin
to pull one over on him.

474
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:41,588
Oh, come on. You knew
what you were doing with Dutch.

475
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:44,385
Using him to get special favors,
even though he never had a chance.

476
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:45,890
He had a chance,

477
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:47,933
He just never took it.

478
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:52,463
Anyway, Kevin was an impulse thing
and judging by the way he's avoiding me,

479
00:30:52,563 --> 00:30:55,115
- it was a big mistake.
- Well,

480
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,182
we all make a few.

481
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:03,284
Know this guy?

482
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,462
Yeah, that's Bones.
He runs errands for me.

483
00:31:08,612 --> 00:31:11,053
Witness saw Bones dump his body.

484
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:13,634
You and Joe have a beef
over off ramp rent?

485
00:31:13,744 --> 00:31:15,950
No, I quit trying to get
payments out of Joe.

486
00:31:16,515 --> 00:31:20,379
A few months ago I saw the old man
get hit by a bus. I mean, bam.

487
00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:24,494
Just picks himself up, walks away.
That's freaky.

488
00:31:24,887 --> 00:31:29,111
I figured it was some sort of sign
and left him alone ever since.

489
00:31:35,582 --> 00:31:37,209
Corrine, get out of the car.

490
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,412
Corrine, get out of the car!

491
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,128
Come on, let's go. Come on

492
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,077
- Come on, let's go.
- Why are you doing this?

493
00:31:48,177 --> 00:31:50,877
Over there.
Come on, let's go. Get in.

494
00:31:50,986 --> 00:31:52,707
- No, Shane, please, no.
- Come on.

495
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:55,146
Shane. Shane.

496
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,714
Please, don't hurt us, ok, please,
not Cassidy, ok? Just let her go.

497
00:31:58,814 --> 00:32:01,799
You're going to be safe, just get in.
Come on, get in.

498
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,623
Just get in, ok?

499
00:32:03,723 --> 00:32:04,796
Get off.

500
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:13,553
Corrine, just stay here, ok?

501
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,626
Just stay here.

502
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:20,246
Corrine, I've got my family hiding, too.
It's not just you.

503
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:21,532
Shane!

504
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:24,332
Shane!

505
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:27,651
Hey, listen to me.

506
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:30,483
As soon as it's safe,
I'll come and get you, ok?

507
00:32:30,858 --> 00:32:33,408
Shane.
Shane.

508
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:36,797
Shane.
Shane. God damn it, Shane.

509
00:32:36,953 --> 00:32:37,907
Shane.

510
00:32:40,678 --> 00:32:44,667
I'm having trouble with a former
employee, he's trying to embarrass me.

511
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,196
How?

512
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:48,313
That's not important.
I'm taking care of it,

513
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:52,389
but I may not be able to
handle things exactly as he wishes.

514
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,705
I may require some money.

515
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:00,367
I was beginning to think you
were growing allergic to my donations.

516
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:03,609
I cashed your check,
and, again, thank you.

517
00:33:04,078 --> 00:33:05,361
But you need more?

518
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,819
How much?

519
00:33:09,931 --> 00:33:11,840
150,000.

520
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:16,433
It goes without saying that
I would be tremendously...

521
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:19,640
- indebted.
- It's done.

522
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:24,367
And, coincidently,
I have a favor to ask from you.

523
00:33:25,556 --> 00:33:27,449
I'm going to head another check.

524
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:30,728
It'll be made out to a small
private college in the area,

525
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:35,179
and I get to create a research
grant anonymously in that amount.

526
00:33:35,335 --> 00:33:36,963
Ok. What kind of research?

527
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:41,806
Mode of behavior, demographic pattern
shifts in Farmington and elsewhere.

528
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:44,325
I'll give you the specifics later,

529
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:47,815
but all the information
comes directly back to me.

530
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:49,333
Yeah.

531
00:33:53,676 --> 00:33:57,759
He wants us to fund a study. Demographics,
mode of behavior, things like that.

532
00:33:57,862 --> 00:33:59,708
Why? Redistricting.

533
00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:04,793
He can manipulate the votes to get me...
others, elected. Let me see your map.

534
00:34:10,223 --> 00:34:13,853
These were the areas highlighted
on the map in Aaron Boles office.

535
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,149
Cruz is the connection.
These are all his developments.

536
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,907
That's low-income housing goes up next
month. And that's 8th street medical center.

537
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:27,569
- That's...
- Uh, office park for small businesses.

538
00:34:28,531 --> 00:34:31,203
Hell, with me in his pocket
and my influence on the city council,

539
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:34,179
he's going to be able to get
contracts easier and expanded.

540
00:34:34,454 --> 00:34:38,350
Then, how does our Boles and his
mexican mob money play in to all this?

541
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:48,255
Think globally. All right,
the money is coming into the U.S.

542
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,699
From the mob in Mexico.

543
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:53,834
Anti-terrorism laws have made international
money laundering much more difficult.

544
00:34:54,414 --> 00:34:57,763
So, all the profit in mexico,
what do they do with it?

545
00:34:58,201 --> 00:35:01,517
They profit here.
Too hard to ship south.

546
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:04,859
So what?

547
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:07,608
The mexican mob
is buying up Farmington?

548
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:10,147
Along with 4 or
5 other districts in L.A.

549
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:14,733
Legitimate business is the
best front for organized crime.

550
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,851
They can run prostitution
out of low income housing,

551
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,405
sell illegal scripts
out of the medical center.

552
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:23,674
Jesus christ.

553
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,787
I got to take a run in at Boles.

554
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:30,669
His secretary said he had a
important meeting with a client tonight.

555
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,346
What, and risk to get
Pezuela that you've turned on him.

556
00:35:34,473 --> 00:35:37,759
Well, that'll start a war and we don't
even know what army he's fighting with.

557
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:40,356
You need patience.

558
00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:44,001
The review board doesn't go
my way, I'm out of here in 3 days.

559
00:35:44,332 --> 00:35:46,600
Vic, this thing can't
come down in 3 days.

560
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,261
- This'll take 3 years.
- Don't let them take my badge from me.

561
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:53,661
You forget about our
bullshit history already.

562
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:56,528
Help me so I can stay and finish this.

563
00:35:57,867 --> 00:36:01,090
Look, I was serious
when I said I couldn't help.

564
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:09,071
But, listen, the board has 3 members,
the senior member is Howard Gregson,

565
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:12,873
now he... he has an autistic grandson.

566
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:15,936
Dotes on him, even serves on
the board for cure autism now.

567
00:36:16,036 --> 00:36:18,443
Oh, you want me to
bring my kids into this?

568
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:22,495
2 autistic children.
You're the bread winner.

569
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,315
They're doctors, therapists,

570
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,938
you know, you say you're sorry for past
transgressions, that you want to change.

571
00:36:28,038 --> 00:36:31,594
You want me to put
my 2 sick kids on display?

572
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:35,429
- To use Meagan and Matthew?
- Maybe you sway Gregson

573
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:38,558
and maybe he sways a second vote.

574
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,376
I know, it's 20 to 1.

575
00:36:59,122 --> 00:37:01,766
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

576
00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:03,894
I think we should talk about last night.

577
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:07,007
I'm...

578
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,676
I'm sorry I saw anything.
I-I don't know

579
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:13,351
- who's been spreading rumors.
- I never meant for you to get hurt.

580
00:37:16,107 --> 00:37:17,699
I liked mentoring you,

581
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:21,458
but I redirected those feelings
into something that was unrealistic.

582
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:24,681
You have nothing to apologize for.

583
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:29,461
So, let's forget last
night and move past it. Ok?

584
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:31,927
Ok.

585
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,124
- Thanks.
- Come on.

586
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:36,034
I got to go.
My suspect is here.

587
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,381
Oh, right. Good luck.

588
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:44,262
So, I got a hit on
Jimmy Barnes living in Whittier.

589
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,988
Says he's miracle Joe's nephew.
He's driving down later.

590
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:51,111
Great, um, listen, Billings is a-wall,
my suspect is here,

591
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,420
you want to take a crack at him with me?

592
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,814
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Great. Let's go.

593
00:38:02,253 --> 00:38:04,506
Ray's innocent. You can let him go now.

594
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,385
You admit to killing Joe
yourself. Ray didn't order it?

595
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:09,909
- I didn't kill anybody.
- We have a witness who saw you

596
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:12,407
dumped his body at
the convenience store.

597
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,500
Guess I need a lawyer then, huh?

598
00:38:16,821 --> 00:38:18,961
Can't get a public defender
down here till morning.

599
00:38:19,061 --> 00:38:22,579
Yeah, but if these guys are innocent,
blood trail will be cold by then.

600
00:38:22,727 --> 00:38:25,496
Coroner's preliminary
report on Joe Barnes.

601
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,967
Systolic cardiac dysfunction resulting in
heart failure. He died of natural causes.

602
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,305
Guy survived about
every indignity and injury

603
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:37,844
a man can suffer, lived his life alone,

604
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,521
in the end, his heart just quit.

605
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:44,135
Maybe figured this place wasn't
worth sticking around for any longer.

606
00:38:48,384 --> 00:38:51,059
- Hey, where are you going, Ron?
- Just checking in with Vic.

607
00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:55,620
Stick around. I found something to keep us
busy. Gang initiation on Hawser Street.

608
00:38:55,745 --> 00:38:57,560
- Who's the dealer?
- Guy named Bernow.

609
00:38:57,662 --> 00:38:59,567
I know Bernow. Why's he giving you intel?

610
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,918
We figured he'd walk
on a possession charge.

611
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:04,352
You guys been too easy on these clowns.

612
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:07,136
So, you burn a source
for a gang initiation tip?

613
00:39:09,054 --> 00:39:11,901
We're going to stop 4 kids
getting jumped into a gang.

614
00:39:12,027 --> 00:39:14,436
Stop them while they're young,
less problems when they're older.

615
00:39:14,626 --> 00:39:16,832
Now, we might not see result tomorrow,

616
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,523
but things are going to
look a lot better over time.

617
00:39:24,844 --> 00:39:26,002
Yeah, that's it.

618
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,680
Hey! Cops are coming!

619
00:39:38,782 --> 00:39:39,986
What's you doing, man?

620
00:39:40,096 --> 00:39:42,724
- Hey, he ain't complaing. - He doesn't
need to. I saw it with my own eyes.

621
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,132
Can't hold him on anything.

622
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:48,362
Take the names, call the parents.

623
00:39:48,988 --> 00:39:51,694
Got a child at home,
take him to mission cross.

624
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:53,710
All right, take it easy.

625
00:40:01,593 --> 00:40:03,162
What the hell is Bernow doing here?

626
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:06,224
I squeezed him and he gave me a tip.
I popped him anyway.

627
00:40:06,342 --> 00:40:08,075
- What was the tip?
- It was no big deal.

628
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:09,815
It was gang initiation.

629
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:17,193
- Call your boy off.
- Keep it down.

630
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,593
- This guy's a CI of mine.
- Oh, yeah? Where's his paperwork?

631
00:40:22,693 --> 00:40:23,923
He's unofficial.

632
00:40:24,032 --> 00:40:26,770
We won't be needing him anymore.
3 more days, right?

633
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:30,796
Bernow gives decent intel. Now,
what good does burning that bridge do?

634
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,303
Listen, that door is always open.
So,

635
00:40:33,406 --> 00:40:36,003
when he's ready to deal again,
maybe he'll try a little harder.

636
00:40:36,105 --> 00:40:39,672
These assholes banging on
each other keeps the rage in house.

637
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:42,363
Look, once these kids are
in a gang, they're in for life.

638
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:45,556
I'd rather give them a chance
now instead of a set of cuffs later.

639
00:41:16,947 --> 00:41:18,872
I'm with HTZ security.

640
00:41:18,997 --> 00:41:21,923
Had a bunch of silent alarms
go off in your neighborhood.

641
00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:24,489
Need to talk to Mrs. Mackey.

642
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,775
We need her to sign off so
I can get her to reset your system.

643
00:41:28,776 --> 00:41:30,920
Sure, yeah.
Come on. Come on in.

644
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,698
I'll go get her.

645
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,086
Ah, you dumb shit.

646
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:18,498
All right, it's your lucky day.

647
00:42:18,624 --> 00:42:20,783
I don't have time to carry
your body, so you listen up.

648
00:42:20,892 --> 00:42:22,247
It's over for Diro.

649
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:25,650
Rezian pulled off a power play taking
control of the armenian operations.

650
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,271
You got a choice. Listen to me.

651
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,178
Now, you either join him, I let
you drive yourself to the hospital,

652
00:42:32,408 --> 00:42:34,366
or you bleed out here and die.

653
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:35,792
What is it?

654
00:42:46,102 --> 00:42:47,275
What happened?

655
00:42:47,408 --> 00:42:49,619
Woman was assaulted by
a kid with a lead pipe.

656
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:51,632
It's a simple assault. Why are you here?

657
00:42:51,732 --> 00:42:55,217
We got a heads up that the suspect
is a kid we had in custody earlier.

658
00:42:55,459 --> 00:42:57,530
We broke up a spookstreet
gang initiation this morning.

659
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,507
- This is round 2.
- We don't know that for sure.

660
00:42:59,607 --> 00:43:02,316
This kid's got to earn their way in.
You take that away and they turn outside.

661
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:04,255
Yeah, and anyone who
stoles a woman like that

662
00:43:04,355 --> 00:43:06,263
is going to do a lot worse
once they join a gang.

663
00:43:06,363 --> 00:43:08,840
Look, kids were getting assaulted,
we couldn't just let that happen.

664
00:43:09,034 --> 00:43:11,824
Ok. How many were being jumped in?
Besides him, 1 more.

665
00:43:11,924 --> 00:43:14,136
Well, let's find him, see
what he's doing to earn his stripes.

666
00:43:21,363 --> 00:43:24,868
Hey, any chance you can pick me up?
Come to clean up hiatt's mess.

667
00:43:26,513 --> 00:43:29,195
Heard your recruitment's been
taking a few hits lately, the streets.

668
00:43:29,354 --> 00:43:32,653
- I ain't heard of nothing. - First,
your gang initiation gets shut down,

669
00:43:32,822 --> 00:43:35,335
then, one of your baby bangers
bashes a woman's head in.

670
00:43:35,577 --> 00:43:37,208
Woman done got cracked?

671
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,748
I'd send flowers if I gave a shit.

672
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:44,425
Besides, I hear your ass ain't
going to be on the streets no more.

673
00:43:44,693 --> 00:43:47,038
Maybe. Maybe not.

674
00:43:47,473 --> 00:43:50,180
If so, my hand-picked
successor is Ronnie.

675
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:53,272
You, him, don't matter much
if I can't bring in new talent.

676
00:43:53,372 --> 00:43:55,521
Just to show I'm willing to be fair.
Schedule another jump in,

677
00:43:55,621 --> 00:43:57,165
I'll make sure it doesn't get broken up.

678
00:43:57,265 --> 00:43:59,100
Don't help us find this kid,

679
00:43:59,257 --> 00:44:01,360
we'll show you how we jump someone in.

680
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,755
Anything I can do for you
on that thing you've been working on?

681
00:44:09,118 --> 00:44:09,964
No.

682
00:44:10,677 --> 00:44:13,287
Guess I'm going to have to
cool my heels for a while.

683
00:44:13,836 --> 00:44:15,839
Hey, are you sure this kid is around here.

684
00:44:15,939 --> 00:44:17,739
Shop's on alvaredo.

685
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:21,560
- Nothing more specific?
- They got to think on they own, right?

686
00:44:22,068 --> 00:44:24,569
The cream rises to the top.

687
00:44:25,948 --> 00:44:28,788
Yo, I think that's him right there.

688
00:44:30,347 --> 00:44:33,344
You think?
He ain't even in the crew yet.

689
00:44:58,793 --> 00:45:01,282
- Hey!
- Don't move.

690
00:45:01,439 --> 00:45:03,868
Give me your hand.
Don't fight.

691
00:45:05,608 --> 00:45:09,124
Sorry, kid.
Gang life will just have to wait.

692
00:45:10,504 --> 00:45:13,161
Good news is, you've been
cleared of all murder charges.

693
00:45:13,261 --> 00:45:16,812
The bad news is, we can still
charge you with desecrating a corpse.

694
00:45:17,273 --> 00:45:18,539
When's my lawyer rolling up?

695
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,647
Can't get a public
defender down here today,

696
00:45:21,793 --> 00:45:24,069
which means you can spend
the night in county with ray

697
00:45:24,169 --> 00:45:27,171
or come clean about what you
were doing with Joe's body and go home.

698
00:45:27,715 --> 00:45:28,887
Look, man.

699
00:45:29,032 --> 00:45:32,488
I found him cold. Figured, since he
was just a bum, who would miss him?

700
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:34,869
Why would you dump his
body at the fast mart?

701
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:36,531
'cause the new owner's an asshole.

702
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:39,063
The old one used to let me
hang inside and beat the heat.

703
00:45:39,163 --> 00:45:40,925
This guy called the
cops, said I was loitering.

704
00:45:41,025 --> 00:45:43,017
So you dumped a corpse on his front door?

705
00:45:43,164 --> 00:45:45,908
Who wants to step over
a dead body to buy a slurpee?

706
00:45:46,016 --> 00:45:48,844
He ruined my day,
so I figured I'd ruin his.

707
00:45:49,328 --> 00:45:51,358
That clear enough for y'all?

708
00:45:53,946 --> 00:45:56,786
- What happened with the miracle Joe thing?
- It's done. Where have you been?

709
00:45:56,895 --> 00:46:00,943
Aw, it's nice to know I've closed my last
case. I'm getting out of this shit hole.

710
00:46:01,344 --> 00:46:05,155
Here's the official paperwork confirming
my disability. My doctor just signed it.

711
00:46:05,255 --> 00:46:07,572
I'm still in the department. My lawyer's
going to have you subpoenaed.

712
00:46:07,672 --> 00:46:10,457
- Suing for what?
- $3.4 million.

713
00:46:10,566 --> 00:46:13,652
Pain and suffering for making me work
after being seriously injured.

714
00:46:13,752 --> 00:46:15,026
What injury?

715
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:17,235
Don't you remember? I got knocked
down trying to break up the fight

716
00:46:17,335 --> 00:46:18,760
between Mackey and Kavanaugh?

717
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:21,309
I've had headaches, neck pain,
and nausea ever since.

718
00:46:21,409 --> 00:46:22,944
Don't act like I never mentioned it.

719
00:46:23,065 --> 00:46:26,182
Steve, you understand that
insurance fraud is a felony?

720
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:29,789
Dutch knows all about the headaches. I've
got everything documented by my physician.

721
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:32,964
Go ahead and read it.
It was nice knowing ya.

722
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:38,366
Who's doctor Nero Yamimoto?

723
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,642
- Is that the last one?
- Yeah.

724
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,343
He's about to shoot somebody
on a crowded sidewalk.

725
00:46:44,443 --> 00:46:46,115
Nice save.

726
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:51,119
- Uh, that Aceveda thing.
- Too big to solve in a day.

727
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:54,432
- Not out yet.
- If you are, what next?

728
00:46:54,553 --> 00:46:57,296
- Don't know.
- I always thought you were 3 steps ahead.

729
00:46:57,453 --> 00:47:00,504
There's still the review board.
I have a few last words.

730
00:47:00,604 --> 00:47:04,223
Are you going to use those words
to save yourself or burn this place down?

731
00:47:04,344 --> 00:47:07,050
You always wanted to do
what was better for other cops.

732
00:47:07,198 --> 00:47:08,757
What's next for you?

733
00:47:08,865 --> 00:47:12,539
The San Marcos case closed,
well, at least officially, thanks to me.

734
00:47:12,672 --> 00:47:14,144
There's no more threat of
this place closing down.

735
00:47:14,244 --> 00:47:15,935
You really going to put
all your chips in hyatt?

736
00:47:16,056 --> 00:47:17,409
He'll get there.

737
00:47:17,518 --> 00:47:20,406
This isn't a.y.s.o., everybody plays.

738
00:47:21,073 --> 00:47:22,908
You need someone who can read the streets.

739
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:25,399
You brought him in here
to move me out smoothly.

740
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,792
You really ready to ride
him all the way home?

741
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:31,901
Get his parents down here.
Call Juvi.

742
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:33,885
Since when have you
been working on this case?

743
00:47:34,431 --> 00:47:36,906
You took a shit out on the streets,
I'm just scooping it up.

744
00:47:37,006 --> 00:47:39,881
Vic, we just got a shots fired call.

745
00:47:40,063 --> 00:47:42,020
It's corrine's address.

746
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:47,652
- Asher, where's my family?
- I don't know. I don't know.

747
00:47:47,752 --> 00:47:50,256
The lady across the street made the call.
The place is empty.

748
00:47:50,356 --> 00:47:52,161
Oh, Jesus Christ.

749
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:59,189
- Did you look in every room?
- Yes, we did.

750
00:48:02,863 --> 00:48:05,628
There's a notebook full of family numbers
in the kitchen drawer over there.

751
00:48:05,728 --> 00:48:07,948
Start calling. See if anyone has
heard from Corrine or Cassidy.

752
00:48:08,048 --> 00:48:09,436
Ok. Ok.

753
00:48:16,814 --> 00:48:18,626
Oh, my God.

754
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,889
My lawyer tells me the d.a. Suddenly
seems open to a lesser plea.

755
00:48:27,834 --> 00:48:30,336
Well, I guess some evidence went missing.

756
00:48:31,012 --> 00:48:32,753
How's your problem?

757
00:48:32,946 --> 00:48:34,372
It's solved...

758
00:48:35,363 --> 00:48:36,837
Temporarily.

759
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,364
But you need a permanent fix.

760
00:48:39,775 --> 00:48:41,068
I do.

761
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:44,839
Here is my fix.
I offer it once.

762
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:47,583
No discussion, no negotiation.

763
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:52,091
I'll make sure that your cop friends
and their families don't get hurt,

764
00:48:53,084 --> 00:48:55,767
you tell me where Kesakian is.

765
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,232
The old man and the girl.

766
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:00,408
I'll handle transfer of power.

767
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:09,824
Your organization lost over $2 million
when that money train was robbed.

768
00:49:10,624 --> 00:49:12,461
I need to be reimbursed.

769
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:15,915
Your favors and your protection
will serve as ongoing payment.

770
00:49:16,015 --> 00:49:18,725
- You expect me to be your gratis snitch?
- Until we're even.

771
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:21,647
- Yeah, well, I can't do that.
- Sure you can.

772
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,056
Because the moment you
don't do something that I ask,

773
00:49:24,156 --> 00:49:27,549
get a shipment of mine into
the country, warn me about the bust,

774
00:49:27,649 --> 00:49:30,447
whatever, first I kill the children,

775
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:33,758
then the wives, then I kill your friends.

776
00:49:34,496 --> 00:49:36,382
That's our deal.

777
00:49:50,161 --> 00:49:51,816
Taxi's on the way.

778
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:54,101
That's it?
No explanation, nothing?

779
00:49:54,201 --> 00:49:55,780
Look, I'm sorry it had to happen this way.

780
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,733
You do not do this to me and my daughter.

781
00:49:57,833 --> 00:49:59,912
- Mom, it's ok, just...
- No, Cass, this is not ok.

782
00:50:00,012 --> 00:50:03,415
This is not ok.
Do not walk away from me.

783
00:50:03,515 --> 00:50:06,643
You know who you married.
It's the only explanation you need.

784
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:16,584
A brownie, you want something to eat?

785
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,640
Oh, here's mommy.

786
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:25,045
- Daddy.
- It's ok, sweetheart. Daddy's here.

787
00:50:29,289 --> 00:50:32,117
- What happened to you?
- Shane pulled a gun on us.

788
00:50:32,227 --> 00:50:35,790
He took us somewhere in east l.a.
He locked us in a truck.

789
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,544
I thought he was going to kill us.

790
00:50:37,655 --> 00:50:40,420
He said he was doing it to
protect us from something you did.

791
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,167
Look, Shane is in some business
with some very dangerous people.

792
00:50:44,267 --> 00:50:48,362
This is him trying to scare
you to get back at me, ok?

793
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:50,709
What are you going to do about it?

794
00:50:52,523 --> 00:50:54,566
- Hey, asher. Come here.
- Yeah.

795
00:50:55,315 --> 00:50:57,319
Take my family to my house.
Stay with them.

796
00:50:57,419 --> 00:50:58,397
Come on, kids.

797
00:51:00,028 --> 00:51:02,046
Let me finish up here, ok?

798
00:51:02,155 --> 00:51:03,702
- I'll handle Shane.
- Ok.

799
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:06,802
- You'll come home after?
- Yes, I will.

800
00:51:06,902 --> 00:51:09,758
I got a work thing
tonight, but I'll be there.

801
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,729
Found a shell casing.
Trail of blood leads to the street.

802
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:14,748
Whoever got shot walked away.

803
00:51:14,848 --> 00:51:17,821
Also found a cigarette butt inside.
Armenian.

804
00:51:18,474 --> 00:51:20,563
Shane's sent out a warning.

805
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:24,192
He and his armenian friends can
get to our families any time they want.

806
00:51:24,313 --> 00:51:25,751
What do you want me to do?

807
00:51:26,186 --> 00:51:30,343
Watch him. Figure out what
he's doing who he's doing it with,

808
00:51:30,646 --> 00:51:33,244
and then we're going to crush him.

809
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:43,971
You know, Vic should have
called me with the leads.

810
00:51:44,071 --> 00:51:47,350
You and Tina Hanlon,
something you want to tell me?

811
00:51:47,812 --> 00:51:50,567
Uh, not especially.

812
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:54,205
Well, I can't keep ignoring everything
I've been hearing about you two.

813
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:56,753
What about the rumor there's a witness?

814
00:51:56,853 --> 00:51:58,626
Ok, you can tell your old partner

815
00:51:58,726 --> 00:52:00,730
that I'm not pressing charges
for being a peeping tom.

816
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:03,255
You're obligated to disclose
a sexual relationship.

817
00:52:03,355 --> 00:52:05,510
- You outrank her.
- It's not ongoing.

818
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:07,972
It was a one time thing.

819
00:52:09,036 --> 00:52:11,535
Which is a wink and a look the
other way every other place I've been.

820
00:52:11,635 --> 00:52:12,806
Not here.

821
00:52:15,988 --> 00:52:17,780
This is about me and the strike team.

822
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,388
- The circumstances you walked into are
difficult. - I haven't even had a chance

823
00:52:21,488 --> 00:52:24,531
- without Vic Mackey looking over
my shoulder. - I don't want Vic.

824
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:28,256
Too much cost.
But, I need someone with a little Vic,

825
00:52:28,413 --> 00:52:31,072
the right kind, and that's not you.

826
00:52:31,192 --> 00:52:33,658
- I've got to look out for the...
- Hey.

827
00:52:34,287 --> 00:52:37,320
I had departments fighting over me.
I'm going to land on my feet.

828
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:41,551
I guess somebody else just got lucky.

829
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,103
Go on, kids. There's your dad.

830
00:53:03,576 --> 00:53:05,799
- Hey.
- Hey, dad.

831
00:53:06,102 --> 00:53:08,506
Kids wanted to be here with you.

832
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:25,690
Uh, I guess they're running a little late.

833
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:28,264
- You ready?
- I got a plan.

834
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:31,733
Well, we're all here for you.

835
00:53:33,433 --> 00:53:35,040
Yeah.

836
00:53:43,696 --> 00:53:45,388
Detective Mackey.

837
00:53:46,113 --> 00:53:48,856
The review board is ready to see you now.

838
00:53:53,232 --> 00:53:57,365
Well, whatever the plan
is, good luck with it.

839
00:53:59,627 --> 00:54:00,980
Detective?

840
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:11,858
- Detective Mackey!
- Vic.

841
00:54:17,474 --> 00:54:19,951
- Jimmy Barnes?
- They call me Jim now.

842
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,469
- Detective Wagenbach, this
is officer Sofer. - Hi.

843
00:54:22,569 --> 00:54:24,616
- Hi.
- We're very sorry about your uncle.

844
00:54:24,822 --> 00:54:26,489
- Thanks.
- Sit down.

845
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:29,293
I appreciate you finding me.

846
00:54:29,784 --> 00:54:32,044
He deserves a proper burial.

847
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:35,235
You should know.
Your uncle wasn't just a homeless guy.

848
00:54:35,394 --> 00:54:38,657
He was a legend around here.
Everybody really liked him,

849
00:54:38,778 --> 00:54:40,228
and, uh...

850
00:54:40,784 --> 00:54:43,128
I'm sorry that he was alone.

851
00:54:43,975 --> 00:54:46,175
He always had that way with people.

852
00:54:46,924 --> 00:54:49,171
Alone is how he liked it.

853
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,409
So, I guess this is you?

854
00:54:51,808 --> 00:54:53,633
We found it in his wallet.

855
00:54:55,156 --> 00:54:57,415
When was the last time you saw him?

856
00:54:58,022 --> 00:55:00,016
Almost 12 years ago.

857
00:55:00,402 --> 00:55:03,507
Joe was my dad's older brother.
They were really close.

858
00:55:03,607 --> 00:55:05,405
And, when my dad got sick,

859
00:55:05,505 --> 00:55:08,500
the doctors told him he
only had a year to live.

860
00:55:10,025 --> 00:55:12,685
So, Joe quit his job,

861
00:55:12,825 --> 00:55:15,610
dropped everything to take care of him.

862
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,679
Kept him alive for 5 years.

863
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:22,919
And, when my dad died,

864
00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:27,339
Joe just lost it.
Disappeared.

865
00:55:28,716 --> 00:55:30,985
We finally found him living on the street.

866
00:55:31,863 --> 00:55:35,852
And we tried a couple times to
bring him home, but he didn't want that.

867
00:55:38,606 --> 00:55:40,530
He just asked us to leave.

868
00:55:45,101 --> 00:55:47,401
I guess he's with my dad now.

869
00:56:11,554 --> 00:56:14,276
I'm ok.
I...

870
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:19,361
I sometimes just can't
get past the little things.

871
00:56:21,232 --> 00:56:24,033
Give me a serial killer and I'm fine.

872
00:56:38,985 --> 00:56:43,287
- Hey.
- Hey, I'm ok. I'm ok.

873
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:22,986
- Hello, officer.
- Hi.

874
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:25,740
- Is there a problem?
- I don't know yet.

875
00:58:31,251 --> 00:58:35,632
You keep a pretty clean car.
You want to pop the trunk for me?

876
00:58:35,757 --> 00:58:38,308
- Have I done something wrong?
- Yeah,

877
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,670
you didn't open the trunk like I asked.

878
00:58:42,377 --> 00:58:43,691
Ok.

879
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,257
Hey.
Stop the car!

880
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:49,525
I sent my men away so they would be safe.

881
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:52,563
Sent you to kill me.

882
00:59:52,663 --> 00:59:55,626
Look, you need to leave right now.
His people are on their way.

883
00:59:55,766 --> 01:00:00,006
Just go home. Back to school in
Germany. Just leave before they kill you.

884
01:00:01,213 --> 01:00:04,577
You didn't need to warn me.
Thank you.

885
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,003
Look, you can't stay here.

886
01:00:08,716 --> 01:00:10,895
They're on their way here right now.

887
01:00:10,995 --> 01:00:14,192
I'm not leaving his fate
up to those monsters.

888
01:00:14,795 --> 01:00:17,001
I will be with him for it.

889
01:00:17,361 --> 01:00:20,083
It needs to be fast.

890
01:01:01,236 --> 01:01:02,816
Look, I'm sorry.

891
01:01:05,284 --> 01:01:07,709
You sent the men who would destroy you.

892
01:01:35,864 --> 01:01:38,649
You want to tell me why
I had to come in a taxi?

893
01:01:40,511 --> 01:01:42,748
Jesus, that's some equipment!

894
01:01:43,374 --> 01:01:46,175
Aaron Bole's car. Pulled him over.

895
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,739
Is this Maria Chivettia?

896
01:01:50,052 --> 01:01:51,581
She's the mayor's financial advisor.

897
01:01:51,681 --> 01:01:54,965
I know. Someone's conducting
a tongue audit between her legs.

898
01:01:55,818 --> 01:01:58,478
This is a paternity suit for Rabi Korman.

899
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:04,961
- Drug rehab receipts for Judge Quayle.
- Well, this one's labeled, uh..

900
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:08,570
"Senator Bradwell and the campfire boys."

901
01:02:11,248 --> 01:02:13,078
holy shit.

902
01:02:14,048 --> 01:02:17,678
That's how Pezuela's gettin' everyone
on board the train to carteltown...

903
01:02:17,843 --> 01:02:20,675
Blackmail.
Just like he did you.

904
01:02:21,144 --> 01:02:24,445
You think this goes far enough
up the ladder to save my job?

905
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:30,314
Are you ready for this?

906
01:02:38,736 --> 01:02:41,896
Take my car. I have a ride.

907
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:45,423
Uh, don't let this guy see your face.

908
01:02:58,288 --> 01:03:00,509
All right, asshole, come on. Let's go.

909
01:03:02,121 --> 01:03:03,388
Get out!

910
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,009
Call Pezuela.
Have him give you a lift.

911
01:03:09,356 --> 01:03:11,042
On the ride home, you can explain to him

912
01:03:11,142 --> 01:03:13,925
how you just lost his
trunk full of leverage.

913
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,462
Buenas noches.

914
01:03:25,587 --> 01:03:29,526
