1
00:00:00,689 --> 00:00:02,110
<i>Previously on The Shield...</i>

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,689
We'll order some chinese food.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,244
Got a great bottle of wine
I've been waiting to open.

4
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:09,875
Is this a date?
Do you want it to be?

5
00:00:10,156 --> 00:00:12,258
Looks like Moses finally made it
to the land of milk

6
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:13,580
and underage honey.

7
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:22,351
Lem, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:24,268
But I had to, right?

9
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:29,471
We're gonna find out who did this.

10
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:30,696
And we're gonna kill him.

11
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:32,645
Maybe he didn't do it, man.

12
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:35,197
- If it wasn't Guardo, who else was it?
- Look at him, man.

13
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,720
If he had a name, don't you think
he would've told us by now?

14
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:40,031
Just means he was acting alone.

15
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:47,054
- Who's jacket?
- This is Captain Hyatt.

16
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:50,329
He used to be a rising star at INS.
He's ours starting next week.

17
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:53,068
You're not adding anybody to my team
that I don't have approval of.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,697
He's not your addition,
he's your replacement.

19
00:01:07,888 --> 00:01:09,260
Come on, boys. Let's go.

20
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,326
- Don't shoot.
- Hold your fire!

21
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,442
It wasn't me. They got guns in there.

22
00:01:21,753 --> 00:01:24,552
- All right, give me the cliff notes.
- No read on how many inside.

23
00:01:24,603 --> 00:01:26,456
Can't get a visual. No one's talking.

24
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:27,915
Any shots fired since you got here?

25
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:30,032
Couple. Sounded semi-automatic.

26
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:45,518
Vic, Kevin Hyatt, your replacement.

27
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:46,498
Hey.

28
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:48,172
Looks like I found the fun.

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,173
Gang shoot-out.
Couple of shots fired.

30
00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:51,340
Called 10 minutes ago.

31
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,791
Stay down.
Both of you.

32
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,307
Go, go, go.

33
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,960
Uh, did he just give me a timeout?

34
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:42,074
Hey!
Let me see your hands!

35
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:44,296
Now, asshole!

36
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:47,666
- Shit.
- Jesus christ.

37
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,325
One of them niners shot us up

38
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:52,919
then took off.

39
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:56,493
- Aah...
- Put some pressure on that, sweetheart, ok?

40
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:03,307
Hey! Get your hands on your head!

41
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,667
Right now.
Get your hands on your head!

42
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:06,086
I can't, man. I can't move.

43
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:06,822
Hey.

44
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:10,724
I was getting splinters in my ass
sitting on the bench.

45
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,668
Figured I'd chip in.

46
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:17,543
Ash!
This one's not colored up.

47
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:18,825
Keep him away from the one niners.

48
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,568
I got it.

49
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:22,471
C'mon, he had Lem's gun.

50
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:24,835
It was in my trunk.
Probably just pulled it out.

51
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:27,888
Tossing you out is bullshit
Doin'it for some cop in diapers.

52
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:29,487
Probably squash this.

53
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:31,878
How about some official introductions.

54
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:33,817
This is a little out of hands right now.

55
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,740
Shane Vendrell, Ronnie Gardocki,

56
00:03:35,803 --> 00:03:36,841
this is Kevin Hyatt.

57
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:39,250
- How's it going?
- I'll take that.

58
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,837
Listen, I heard about your boy.
Lemansky.

59
00:03:46,974 --> 00:03:50,803
I lost a partner on the border 3 years ago.
It's a bitch of a thing, and I'm sorry.

60
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,847
Lem was more than a partner.

61
00:03:54,977 --> 00:03:56,652
Well, of course he was.

62
00:03:57,527 --> 00:03:59,647
- Listen, ride with me.
- You got it.

63
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:02,358
I'll give you a rundown on the one niners
on the way to the Barn.

64
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,639
I reassigned units to enforce
the one niner injunction.

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,909
That should keep things to a low boil
until we know what we're dealing with.

66
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,714
Having Hyatt around here
might be a good thing for you.

67
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:25,244
Give you a chance to show
you can play well with others.

68
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:28,037
It's a little late in the game
for me to win miss congeniality.

69
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:28,691
What do you think?

70
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:30,325
**** of the biz lads heard that

71
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:33,048
the one niners were having a square dance.
Decided to crash.

72
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:37,166
Hot shot hero learned street gang names
on his ride in. Likes to show off.

73
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:38,573
I was about to tell Vic

74
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:41,465
that you're gonna bring in your own guys
eventually expanding the team.

75
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:42,848
What about Shane and Ronnie?

76
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:44,392
Let's keep them on.

77
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:47,266
I'd like two teams here under
Hyatt's supervision.

78
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:49,248
There's not a lot of people
who can do this job.

79
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:49,934
I know.

80
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:53,434
That's why I set up an appeals panel

81
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:56,695
to review your retirement.
They meet in two weeks.

82
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:59,355
If the panel's convinced
that we need you...

83
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:02,140
Acevedo will never support that.

84
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:04,260
He's got a lot riding on the barn.

85
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:06,961
And if you're not in charge,
he'll feel more comfortable.

86
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,882
But if you want me to make that case,

87
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:12,091
you have to show me
you can make it work.

88
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:15,446
Listen, I gotta deal with this.
And I'll make it work.

89
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:26,358
I gotta say, I'm a little confused.

90
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:31,007
I lied to Mackey.
In 3 weeks, he's gone. Period.

91
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:35,596
But if he knows that, he'll start working
some angle. Looking for loopholes.

92
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:38,159
I'm trying to keep him
on his best behavior.

93
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:40,195
Especially for your sake.

94
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,483
Well, it's kind of cold.

95
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:46,056
- What do you know about Vic?
- Rumours mostly.

96
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:47,971
I know he's made an assload of arrests.

97
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:50,876
And I know that two guys on his team
got dead in the last 3 years.

98
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:53,188
Another went head-first
through a windshield.

99
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:58,781
So if I'm banging down doors, I better
make sure Mackey's where I can see him.

100
00:05:58,871 --> 00:06:01,736
You'll be just fine as long as
he doesn't have a problem with you.

101
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:04,293
Now I've taken care of that.
Have a seat.

102
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:07,694
How about I start putting my
own team together now?

103
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:10,041
Swing the numbers my way a little.

104
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:13,675
We do have good cops around here.

105
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,162
I'll think on it.

106
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:20,132
- Everything ok?
- I'm fine.

107
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:23,630
No, no, no. Stay.
Maybe you should all hear this.

108
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:28,807
I feel really stupid for saying
this out loud, and

109
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:32,993
normally, I don't even believe in this stuff,
but I woke up this morning,

110
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:35,627
and i felt like I was given a message.

111
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:37,107
What are you talking about?

112
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,333
I had this dream last night.

113
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:41,991
And we were all there
in our old backyard

114
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:44,873
having a barbecue,
only it wasn't our old yard, you know,

115
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:48,160
it was this beautiful place
by this precipice.

116
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,011
And Lem was there.

117
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:54,613
And he was wearing his usual jeans,
but he had on this pinstripe shirt,

118
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,468
and his hair was shorter,

119
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,212
and he was younger
like when I first met him.

120
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,673
He was wrestling with one of you guys.
I don't remember which,

121
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,430
but then he wanted

122
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:06,969
burgers for you guys.
Really well done, no pink.

123
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:10,849
The thing is,
when I turned to give him the burgers,

124
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,727
he got really mad,
and he said I made them all wrong.

125
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:16,559
I'd never seen him like that.
He was shouting.

126
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:19,900
And then you came over to him,
and you said,

127
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,454
it's all right. You'd learned to eat

128
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:24,063
your burgers like that.

129
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:26,487
Then he got really calm.

130
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,408
And he said...

131
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,745
Ok.
It's all gonna be ok.

132
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:36,249
And then he stepped off the cliff,

133
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:39,223
and he didn't go up or down,

134
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:42,067
he just disappeared
into this, like, haze.

135
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:45,338
I know this sounds crazy,

136
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,430
but I think it was Lem.

137
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,412
I think he wanted me
to tell you this story.

138
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:57,416
Maybe it means that everything
is going to be ok.

139
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:58,712
Right?

140
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:05,258

143
00:08:13,613 --> 00:08:15,652
let it go, man. It's just a dream.

144
00:08:15,755 --> 00:08:18,733
Corrine knows we've all been hurting lately.
Thought it would give us some confidence.

145
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:19,519
Just go with it.

146
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:22,440
He didn't disappear up in the sky.
He disappeared sideways.

147
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,089
How is that comforting?

148
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,748
He lost friends today.

149
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:38,099
You lead with that. Don't show sympathy.

150
00:08:38,265 --> 00:08:40,123
Gang bangers see weakness,
they tighten up.

151
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:42,362
- I've done gang work before.
- Well, this isn't the valley

152
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,693
or the rio grande.
This is the majors.

153
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,195
Listen, you're not ready for this.

154
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:49,451
I know immigration isn't a cakewalk...

155
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:52,229
I saw shit on that border you can't imagine.
4 years worth.

156
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:53,409
I understand.

157
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:56,784
But all those mexis, too smart
to get picked up, we got them.

158
00:08:57,147 --> 00:08:59,301
Plus black gangs, russian mob,

159
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,270
salvadorans,
asians, armenians and more,

160
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:04,509
all in the same square mile.

161
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:08,852
What do you want me to say?

162
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:10,642
You're right.

163
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:13,417
So, you know, get me ready.

164
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:18,364
All your dead buddies
were in the same one niner rack as you.

165
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:22,182
Altered just like yours.
You starting up a new faction?

166
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:25,785
Either you found a new set,
or you're trying to jump out.

167
00:09:25,885 --> 00:09:27,471
Both are punishable by death.

168
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:29,852
My guess is you wanted to get out.

169
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:31,908
In which case, you're not a bad guy.

170
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:34,681
But I'm looking at you now, man,
with your locked jaw,

171
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:36,546
your pissed off stare.

172
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:39,664
- And I'm a black man, and you're a cop.
- So picture me with a puppy.

173
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:41,750
Give you that warm, fuzzy feeling.

174
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:43,627
Look, man.

175
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:45,882
Banging ain't my life no more.

176
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:47,520
I've been straight for 4 months.

177
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,434
Then explain the .22 you were carrying
when we popped you.

178
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:52,791
It's a little thing we call
self defense, man.

179
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:56,163
If you're so squeaky, why were you and
your boys meeting up with the one niners?

180
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:02,126
I need to know about Vontez, man.
If he got out.

181
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,950
Les autres victimes portaient

182
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:07,057
were wearing one niner colors.

183
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:10,132
Now start talking.

184
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:21,558
So Vontez is the leader of the revolution.

185
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,635
And Vontez say, oppressors are oppressors.

186
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:29,330
It don't matter if you black,
or you white. And you already know

187
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,619
how much one niner soldiers make.
Hustling all day, all night.

188
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:33,795
They all might as well be just

189
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:36,021
flipping burgers.
That's oppression.

190
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:40,021
Breaking ties with the one niners
over drug money ain't exactly noble.

191
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:43,431
We quit selling.
That's why we quit paying.

192
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,379
Banging doesn't come with an out clause.

193
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:47,668
So what was your escape plan
for getting out alive?

194
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:49,864
Just a bunch of boys from the block.

195
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:51,954
We all jumped out together.

196
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:53,394
Safety in numbers.

197
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:54,948
How many?

198
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,122
It was about 7.

199
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:00,588
I mean the meeting was supposed
to be us settling up

200
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:02,414
with them making sure
everything was solid.

201
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:03,546
Why the guns?

202
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:05,883
We ain't stupid, man.

203
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:08,612
Anyway...

204
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,631
Niners, they shot first.

205
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:15,010
And the revolution begins.

206
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:17,504
Stop it! Stop it!

207
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:19,082
You with me?

208
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:19,460
Yeah.

209
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:21,850
1-Baker-23, code 6.

210
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:24,638
Hands up!

211
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,358
Get your hands up!

212
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:32,779
What do you want? What do you want?

213
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,144
I do nothing! I do nothing!

214
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:36,769
Are you all right, hey.

215
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:38,962
1-Baker-23.

216
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:40,884
- I need a paramedic for an assault victim.
- Hey!

217
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,245
I was watching that.

218
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,367
- Hey, get a life, asshole.
- Got one, officer.

219
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:48,374
Vontez Carter.
He's a low level one niner.

220
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:51,721
I sent him to Corcoran about a year ago
for dealing and possession.

221
00:11:51,806 --> 00:11:54,368
This kid, he's more of a thinker
than a slider.

222
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,113
He spent his 8 months reading Malcolm X,
Huey Newton.

223
00:11:57,321 --> 00:11:58,462
As soon as he was released,

224
00:11:58,512 --> 00:12:01,598
he started pulling his buddies out.
They stayed under the radar

225
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:04,606
- till they stopped paying taxes.
- That meet this morning was a set up.

226
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,622
Get the rebels in one place.
Take them all out at once.

227
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:08,948
Look, these kids are trying to
get their lives straight.

228
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:10,557
Make up for their mistakes.

229
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:15,082
- How many of these revolutionaries are there?
- Minus the two that are dead

230
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:17,669
and the one in interrogation,
four. All in the wind.

231
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:19,719
With a hundred or so one niners
after their heads.

232
00:12:19,885 --> 00:12:20,909
Got a plan?

233
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:24,082
Find Vontez and his boys,
get them off the streets for starters.

234
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:26,418
Yeah? Thanks for weighing in.

235
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:29,746
First thing we gotta do
is have a sit down with Moses.

236
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,294
He's the head of the one niners.

237
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:33,463
See if we can't convince him to back off.

238
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:35,649
We can introduce him to the new guy

239
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:36,634
while we're at it.

240
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:39,316
Meantime, let's get the ball rolling
and find these kids.

241
00:12:39,471 --> 00:12:41,004
Keep me informed.

242
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:50,310
Shane's still a bit raw about Lem.
It's nothing personal.

243
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:52,232
- Hits everybody different.
- Yeah.

244
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,671
- How are you doing?
- I've been better lately.

245
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:59,448
50 bucks says Mackey and the new guy
get into it by the end of the day.

246
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:01,372
No, thanks.

247
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,067
Lowe and Sofer interrupted
a rape in progress.

248
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:05,579
The victim's Graciela Sanchez.

249
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:07,831
She's in the system.
She ran away from her fourth

250
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:11,415
foster home 2 months ago.
She's at mission cross.

251
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:14,818
I love the smell of underage
sexual assault in the morning.

252
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:18,881
I didn't mean that the way it came out.

253
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:21,730
Julien and Danny are riding together?

254
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:25,255
For the moment. The suspect's been
apprehended at the scene.

255
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:28,079
- What about Tina, she out sick?
- No. She transferred out.

256
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:30,413
Finally make your move?

257
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:33,193
Scare Hanlon and her
bikini briefs out the door.

258
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:46,087
He say cops would be coming.
Come on.

259
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:48,352
We're all out back.

260
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,347
all the shit we cleaned up for Moses,

261
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:53,557
we shouldn't be talking to this asshole
in front of Hyatt.

262
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,304
You think he's gonna admit to killing kern?
For christ sakes, hold it together.

263
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,392
And good. 'cause I got a shot
at keeping my job.

264
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:03,558
There's an appeals hearing forming.
I'll fill you in later,

265
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,343
but for now, help me be helpful.

266
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,684
Mackey's lackeys.

267
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:14,923
We're almost done, but I got a minute.
And who's this?

268
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:18,209
Detective Hyatt.
But you can call me detective Hyatt.

269
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,834
You're gonna be seeing a lot of him.

270
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,677
Let me save you time asking.

271
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:25,056
I gots none for you.
Low low shit ain't my concern.

272
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:28,242
You boys set up a shooting gallery
at a chicken shack.

273
00:14:28,815 --> 00:14:32,417
If one of my lieutenants is having problems
with his quadrant, he solves it.

274
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,086
I got zero knowledge.

275
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:37,682
Might be good for you to let Vontez
and his boys go their own way.

276
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:39,487
I mean, what's 7 soldiers

277
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:40,909
in an army full of assholes?

278
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,447
You fall for that Vontez
the revolutionary shit?

279
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,138
Just a scam to take
more cut for himself.

280
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:47,863
Hey, you got an eye cramp?

281
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,600
Thought we told you to stay away
from the tweener pussy.

282
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,354
You be having a good day now.

283
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,864
Graciela's tox report
came back with extremely high levels of

284
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:04,215
ghb. She was practically in a coma
when we got her.

285
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:07,136
Date rape drugs.
21st century chivalry in action.

286
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,630
Yeah, we've gotten lazy as a society.

287
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:11,757
I'd write a song if you slip a girl a mickey.

288
00:15:11,872 --> 00:15:16,066
Anyway, her rape kit reads from a to z.
In addition to fresh vaginal tearing,

289
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:18,879
she showed signs of significant anal trauma.

290
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:20,964
There's something else.

291
00:15:28,414 --> 00:15:29,491
Jesus.

292
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:32,309
Before he raped her?

293
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:36,208
Appears to be one or two days old.
What do you think it means?

294
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:41,931
There's no point in lying, mehud.
Two police officers

295
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:43,403
caught you raping her.

296
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:46,884
- I screw her, but I no rape her.
- What does "go home" mean?

297
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:48,139
So what happened?

298
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,208
You get a hard on,
you slip her a roofie at some club,

299
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:53,497
huh?
You give drugs, she go sleep?

300
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:55,513
I find her. She look like hooker.

301
00:15:55,631 --> 00:15:58,862
I say, give 20 bucks for quick bang.
She nodded ok.

302
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:01,419
Either way, at some point,
she became unconscious.

303
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:03,799
- What? I'm supposed to stop?
- Yeah!

304
00:16:04,946 --> 00:16:07,639
Why do you want her to go home?

305
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:10,931
I give her 20 bucks in her pocket.
Look and see.

306
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:16,770
- He didn't do it.
- What?

307
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,111
- He didn't cut her up.
- Great.

308
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:28,179
Vontez framed this himself.

309
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:31,473
Said it reminds him of where he's been
and don't want to go again.

310
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:33,578
Let us get your son somewhere safe.

311
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:34,830
He's better off on his own.

312
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,413
- Hey, hey. Vic.
- Shit.

313
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:37,883
Get inside. Keep your head down.

314
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,474
What's up?
What's up, man?

315
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,394
Get out of here, assholes.

316
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:55,368
Niners been driving by here
every 5 minutes all day acting tough.

317
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:57,908
My boy's gotta hide from them and you
just the same.

318
00:16:57,998 --> 00:17:00,727
Tell us where your son is.
Vontez can't do this on his own.

319
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,108
Oh, he won't have to.
See a lot of people think my boy

320
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,363
is a hero.

321
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:06,202
Look, please...

322
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:11,546
If you want your son to be a live hero,
not a dead martyr, have him call me.

323
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:12,451
I just want to talk.

324
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:26,730
If I'd have known
I was gonna see you today,

325
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,320
I would've worn that little top you like.

326
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:29,885
Thought you were gonna stop
seeing that asshole.

327
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,801
I know.
It's just hard to find the moment.

328
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:34,610
Well, then try harder.

329
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:37,160
I don't want him touching you.

330
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:39,139
Ok, baby.

331
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,513
What do you want?
You.

332
00:17:43,702 --> 00:17:47,733
But I need Moses' lieutenant
who's cracking down on Vontez.

333
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:52,945
Lieutenant's Angelo Owens.

334
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,573
But he's just doing this
'cause Moses came down on him.

335
00:17:56,764 --> 00:17:57,693
I mean, them boys,

336
00:17:57,762 --> 00:17:59,456
they been friends
they whole lives.

337
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,201
Where's Angelo?

338
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,406
Blue house on Warnol.
By the gas station.

339
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:08,673
Look, don't get me
in trouble with the niners.

340
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,654
Ain't nobody messing with you, tilly.
They're the ones in trouble, ok?

341
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:23,993
End it with Moses. Today.
I need you to do that.

342
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:25,440
For me.

343
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:26,714
Ok?

344
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,086
One niners are all clamped down.
I want to settle this in-house.

345
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:32,720
What about the families?
Somebody knows where these kids are.

346
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:35,814
The niners have got them too scared to talk,
or they don't know where they are.

347
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:38,823
I want to send a message.
Somebody wants out of a gang,

348
00:18:38,973 --> 00:18:42,012
we're here to protect them.
Find Vontez and his friends.

349
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:45,000
Anything you need to bring them in safe,
you got it.

350
00:18:47,247 --> 00:18:48,454
Hey, man, where's Shane?

351
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:51,185
Said he had some C.I.
Somebody from when he was in vice.

352
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:52,621
Shane was in Vice?

353
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:55,573
That explains a lot.
Vice guys are pretty intense.

354
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:59,009
Just picture Shane with a puppy.
It'll give you that warm, fuzzy feeling.

355
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:02,450
That's Hyatt's interrogation technique.
No shit.

356
00:19:03,553 --> 00:19:05,508
What, are you trying to get answers
or pussy?

357
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:08,176
Whatever it takes, right?

358
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:10,980
Glad to see everybody's having fun.

359
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:13,315
Of course, Lem's still dead.

360
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:16,485
Anyone else give a shit about that?

361
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,556
- Hey, we...
- Shut up, man. You don't belong here.

362
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:22,769
In this room.

363
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,114
2 minutes of breathing your air,

364
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,244
I could tell you're not
half the man or cop Lem was.

365
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:28,648
I got thick skin, man,
but you're starting to chafe.

366
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:31,034
You guys just act like
everything's fine, man.

367
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,249
Like shit just moves on, right?

368
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:34,754
It does.

369
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:35,439
Yeah?

370
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:38,485
Not for me.

371
00:19:40,706 --> 00:19:42,746
I actually give a shit that he's gone.

372
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:58,260
Uh, lieutenant's Angelo Owens.
He's got a location over on Warnol.

373
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:00,906
Good. Thanks.

374
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,897
My C.I. says Angelo set up the shootings,

375
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:07,580
but Moses didn't give him much choice.

376
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:15,854
I just, I didn't want him back.

377
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:20,080
And what's with that guy, man.
I mean, he's not Lem, you know.

378
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:22,218
This is what's real, all right.

379
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:26,472
You keep this up, I'm not the only one
around here that's not gonna have a job.

380
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:29,638
You.
Maybe Ronnie, too.

381
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,657
You know Lem wouldn't want that.

382
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:34,848
In a couple of weeks,
this appeals panel

383
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,024
is deciding
whether to send me packing or not.

384
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:39,607
I'm gonna need this Hyatt on my side.

385
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:41,612
If he says he needs me, I got a shot.

386
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:43,090
Yeah, I hear that.

387
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:48,082
What happened with Lem...
Slate's clean.

388
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,768
We made that right.
Right?

389
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,126
You think killing Guardo

390
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,433
- made any difference, man, Lem's dead.
- Oh, jesus.

391
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,751
Corinne said he's pissed.

392
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:58,086
- She said she's never seen him like that.
- Stop.

393
00:20:59,198 --> 00:21:01,465
I can't deal with a goddamn dream right now.

394
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,753
Look, just find this lieutenant.

395
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:08,835
Let's save who we can save today.

396
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:15,938
Mackey.

397
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:18,232
Hey. You wanted me to call.

398
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:21,246
- Vontez, where are you?
- Don't matter.

399
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,866
I gotta handle this.

400
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,189
Look, man, let me put you
into protective custody.

401
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:28,672
Moses even knows I talked to the cops.
Niners ain't going back to the table.

402
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,658
Moses wants you dead. Where are you?

403
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,321
Do you read Dubois?

404
00:21:33,662 --> 00:21:35,636
Do I... No.

405
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:37,710
He wrote about the path

406
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,296
of honor and humanity.
I die,

407
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,900
I still got that.
More than most people got.

408
00:21:44,398 --> 00:21:46,454
- Just wanted to tell you stop looking.
- Vontez.

409
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:48,732
- Don't feel like being found.
- Come on, man. Vontez.

410
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:50,106
Shit!

411
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:56,576
So the site's coming along.
You're making quick time.

412
00:21:56,803 --> 00:21:59,179
Thanks to the support from the
housing commission.

413
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:01,358
A few more, gracias,

414
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:03,903
construction hurdles.

415
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:07,663
It's an easy sell.
It's a worthwhile project.

416
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,160
Noticed something else
you've been selling.

417
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,653
A cleaner, kinder Farmington P.D.

418
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:18,042
There was a bad apple.

419
00:22:18,473 --> 00:22:20,544
He got deep, he got himself killed,

420
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:23,059
police committee wants
the community to know

421
00:22:23,114 --> 00:22:24,875
that the rest of the players
are still here to protect them.

422
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,432
It's tough to buy
when you've got 12 dead mexicans

423
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:31,402
slaughtered in that house in san marcos.
And no arrests.

424
00:22:31,512 --> 00:22:34,620
Those murders were handed off to
robbery/homicide. Farmington's out of it.

425
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,296
RHD doesn't give a shit about
a dozen illegals.

426
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:39,441
They did, this thing
would be solved already.

427
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:43,503
I'll make some calls.
See if I can light a fire.

428
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:47,113
Couple of the guys
from the crew came to me.

429
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:51,110
Said they've heard rumors that
a salvadoran gang called

430
00:22:51,177 --> 00:22:53,904
"Larasa Juanaca" was responsible.

431
00:22:54,112 --> 00:22:55,287
I'll pass it along.

432
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:58,698
If the Farmington p.d.
Were to crack this case,

433
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:01,999
it would go along toward
allaying your constituents

434
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:04,429
belief that police don't care.

435
00:23:06,357 --> 00:23:08,267
It would reflect well on you.

436
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,563
You should've been a politician, Cruz.

437
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:16,934
I leave that to the experts.

438
00:23:19,913 --> 00:23:23,432
You remember that runaway came in
6 months ago? Claimed she'd been kidnapped?

439
00:23:23,729 --> 00:23:26,228
- Rings a bell.
- I dug up her taped statement.

440
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,438
- Oops.
- Sorry.

441
00:23:31,102 --> 00:23:32,281
It's ok, I...

442
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,559
I thought I'd have some privacy in here.

443
00:23:34,754 --> 00:23:36,895
you can use my office anytime.

444
00:23:37,087 --> 00:23:39,139
Sure.

445
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:47,904
Princess Gaines. Ran away.

446
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:50,594
Came back a month later
mom found blood on her pants,

447
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,713
asked about it, princess said
she was abducted, anally assaulted,

448
00:23:54,048 --> 00:23:55,971
and held captive for two weeks.

449
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:59,073
he was white.

450
00:23:59,408 --> 00:24:00,591
Or latin.

451
00:24:01,115 --> 00:24:02,398
Yeah, he was a latin dude.

452
00:24:02,471 --> 00:24:04,565
Can you tell us anything else?

453
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:07,506
Not too much.
Had me drugged or something.

454
00:24:07,784 --> 00:24:08,819
Or something?

455
00:24:09,594 --> 00:24:12,354
So the last thing she remembered
was begging outside of a burger place.

456
00:24:12,402 --> 00:24:16,479
Next thing she knew, she woke up in a
strange room, man was holding her prisoner.

457
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,223
It would really help us.

458
00:24:19,282 --> 00:24:20,903
Any little detail.

459
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,168
He kept saying, "go home now. Go home."

460
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:28,842
And then this man just... let you go?

461
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:30,165
I'm here ain't i?

462
00:24:30,364 --> 00:24:32,508
One morning, i just wake up in the street.

463
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,874
- What'd you do then?
- Did what he said.

464
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:36,013
Went home.

465
00:24:39,494 --> 00:24:41,434
- We didn't believe her.
- Yeah.

466
00:24:42,386 --> 00:24:45,641
She didn't take a rape kit.
Toxic screen came back negative.

467
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:47,463
Case didn't add up.

468
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:51,052
So this guy targets runaways.
Uses GHB

469
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:53,719
to keep them out of it just long
enough to do what he pleases.

470
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:57,571
While telling them to go home.
Like good little girls.

471
00:24:57,653 --> 00:24:59,537
So graciela got double pumped.

472
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:02,667
This creep does her in the rear,
and left the vaginal cavity

473
00:25:02,748 --> 00:25:04,878
intact for mehud to spill
his load in the alley.

474
00:25:04,992 --> 00:25:07,292
The cutting's an escalation.

475
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:11,103
- He'll go further next time.
- I'll call the mom.

476
00:25:11,516 --> 00:25:13,175
Bring princess in.

477
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:23,339
So your lieutenant set up a slaughter house

478
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:25,765
this morning without any
encouragement from you.

479
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:29,322
The streets|are full of liars.
Ain't my fault somebody
says i got fingers in this.

480
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:30,612
You're a two striker.

481
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:32,432
All i need is one good bust.

482
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:37,580
You gonna plant some shit on me?
You wouldn't do that, right, Mackey?

483
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,340
Leave me out of options.

484
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:43,980
We stay on you, we'll get you
fair and square.

485
00:25:44,557 --> 00:25:46,178
Might take a couple of months.

486
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:47,817
But you can bank on it.

487
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:51,994
Shoot.

488
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,637
Hey, fellas.
What say we trade some names.

489
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:01,257
You two, come here.

490
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:05,041
Vontez is the one caused me problems.

491
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:06,460
He dies.

492
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:10,433
The other ones... I'll pull the order
as soon as vontez is cold.

493
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:11,922
That's what i'm offering.

494
00:26:12,078 --> 00:26:14,156
Now what do i get for my generosity?

495
00:26:14,396 --> 00:26:15,650
What do you want?

496
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:21,538
Back off my boys.
I don't want to see no popo for 6 months.

497
00:26:21,635 --> 00:26:23,996
2 months. Me and my guys stay away.

498
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,552
I don't control the black and whites.

499
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:29,085
You control them on me?

500
00:26:30,987 --> 00:26:33,975
But you pull the order on the other three
right now.

501
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:54,360
- Lover's quarrel?
- Moses had a proposal.

502
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,331
Sacrifice vontez, the other three stay safe.

503
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,831
So what's stopping us hauling his ass in
on conspiracy charges right now?

504
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:02,619
I took the deal.

505
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,596
At least, that's what he thinks.

506
00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:08,784
I teach you all my tricks

507
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,958
on the first day,
what are we gonna do tomorrow?

508
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:20,432
You're looking for princess gaines.
16.

509
00:27:20,561 --> 00:27:23,415
According to her mother,
she ran away for a second time

510
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:25,057
couple of months ago.

511
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:27,109
Start with runaway row.

512
00:27:27,268 --> 00:27:30,086
Shelters, fast food places, huh?
Thank you.

513
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,241
Um, i'm sorry about, um...
Busting in on you.

514
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:39,028
I know it's all perfectly natural.

515
00:27:39,145 --> 00:27:41,605
Don't worry, i'll keep them
locked down from now on.

516
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:43,993
Wow. They put hanlon on a poster.

517
00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:47,544
Oh, great.

518
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:53,212
She gets to be miss farmington, huh?
And i'm stuck with her p1 duties.

519
00:27:53,376 --> 00:27:54,640
Let's ride.

520
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:58,380
Take one home tonight. Do it in private.
Right now we got the

521
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:01,420
files of every latin sex offender
in a 10-mile radius to go through.

522
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:02,894
Where'd this come from?

523
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:04,386
Captain told me to put them up.

524
00:28:04,555 --> 00:28:06,437
Well, yeah, but where did it come from?

525
00:28:06,578 --> 00:28:08,434
Do i look omniscient?

526
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:17,665
Hey, what's the deal with the poster?

527
00:28:17,841 --> 00:28:20,371
The all new faceless cop fighting bogus O.T.

528
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:22,400
She's out, tina's in.

529
00:28:22,523 --> 00:28:25,831
Posters, public appearances,
the whole bit. She's citywide.

530
00:28:25,961 --> 00:28:27,963
But tina wanted to be a detective.

531
00:28:31,037 --> 00:28:33,315
This is straight from the chief's office. She was picked
from the P.R. Photos  they shot the other day.

532
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:35,309
Ok, thanks. We'll be right down there.

533
00:28:35,605 --> 00:28:38,761
Dutchman, graciela's awake. We got a sketch.

534
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:42,888
One baker, 23 roger.

535
00:28:42,976 --> 00:28:44,887
Do you have a description of the vehicle?

536
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,053
- Do you copy?
- Shit.

537
00:28:53,437 --> 00:28:55,981
Can't afford a babysitter that speaks english.

538
00:28:56,697 --> 00:28:58,391
- Shit.
- One baker 23.

539
00:28:58,508 --> 00:29:01,418
- We're approaching at 12th and effie.
- Roger that.

540
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:23,022
Vontez was your friend. Your soldier.

541
00:29:23,592 --> 00:29:27,609
Him, marlon, jayson, they're all still
out there trying to escape your hit.

542
00:29:27,943 --> 00:29:30,934
Fine way to treat your friends, lieutenant.
What do you do on birthdays?

543
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:32,623
I don't want to.

544
00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:35,056
Make the call, angelo.

545
00:29:35,783 --> 00:29:37,106
Put an end to this right now.

546
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:39,872
I didn't push the button.
I can't unpush it.

547
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:42,294
Moses is laying all of this on you, man.

548
00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:46,714
So why don't you tell me something different.
Give me moses. We can work out a deal.

549
00:29:47,323 --> 00:29:48,763
Cop says deal, you go to jail.

550
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:52,144
Call off the hit.
You can still make this right.

551
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:55,210
I do what you want,
i'm a dead man, and my family, too.

552
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:57,501
Life is just the way life is.

553
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:06,008
- Who is it? Is it vontez?
- Daniel billup.

554
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:07,899
- You're sure?
- Positive.

555
00:30:12,963 --> 00:30:13,964
Goddamn.

556
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:17,582
I guess moses wasn't planning
on keeping his end of the deal either, huh?

557
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:19,368
I guess not.

558
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:21,658
One down, three to go.

559
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:30,315
Hey, step back. Sir, step back.

560
00:30:30,438 --> 00:30:33,894
- Move it. Come on.
- I don't want to see this shit like this, man, damn.

561
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,005
Daniel was on a peace mission.

562
00:30:36,146 --> 00:30:38,368
- Vontez sent him back to the table.
- Yeah.

563
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:40,922
Someone sure shoved the peace pipe
right back up his ass.

564
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,541
- I don't want to go over there.
- No, man, that's my nigger!

565
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:44,420
Damn!

566
00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:46,316
Damn, man!

567
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:48,928
Give him to me. Hey, ray.

568
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,389
You see this?

569
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,461
That's what's gonna happen to the rest of your friends
if you don't help me find out where they're holed up.

570
00:30:55,546 --> 00:30:56,982
One niners took his cell phone.

571
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,508
Any call daniel made, they're gonna know
about it.

572
00:30:59,697 --> 00:31:01,410
Only a matter of time
before some one niner

573
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:02,858
finds that person.

574
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:05,153
My man vontez can defend himself, man.

575
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:07,495
He might be a revolutionary,
but he ain't bulletproof.

576
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:10,999
We find him, or the one niners leave
the rest of their bodies for us to find, ray.

577
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:12,874
How many funerals you want to go to?

578
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:16,973
Bag him.

579
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:19,352
Look at me. Ray.

580
00:31:19,455 --> 00:31:21,348
You've done a lot of bad things, ray.

581
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:25,252
Sold drugs, stole money. Murdered.

582
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,528
You do this one last
good thing for your friends.

583
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:35,014
Vontez would've called
his cousin akil, man.

584
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,473
He'll know where they at.

585
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:38,528
All right. Take him.

586
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:43,351
Let's find this akil.

587
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:51,027
Police! Open up!

588
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:56,149
Oh, the hell with it.

589
00:31:56,412 --> 00:31:58,010
Hands on your head! Don't move!

590
00:31:58,489 --> 00:31:59,678
Hands on your head!

591
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,484
Sending your cousin on a little trip?

592
00:32:04,152 --> 00:32:05,278
Where's vontez?

593
00:32:10,876 --> 00:32:12,128
The mask was red.

594
00:32:12,694 --> 00:32:16,387
Anything else you remember?
Maybe he took you somewhere?

595
00:32:16,953 --> 00:32:18,882
You remember something about his hands?

596
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:20,816
He have an accent?

597
00:32:22,535 --> 00:32:23,896
Detective wagenbach.

598
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,134
Nurses say she needs a gentle touch.

599
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:33,717
You're the gentle touch, i suppose?

600
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:37,076
- I happen to be a wonderful father.
- Two weekends a month.

601
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:43,928
I'll be outside.

602
00:32:48,582 --> 00:32:52,879
Sometimes i think humans need
a subspecies to categorize these bastards.

603
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:57,348
Hey, i saw vic this morning.
He's doing better.

604
00:32:58,274 --> 00:33:01,737
I, uh, i hear he's handling the situation
with his replacement well.

605
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,132
- What, they filled lem's spot?
- Vic's replacement.

606
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,901
Some guy named hiatt. He's taking
over the strike team when vic retires.

607
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,986
That's not for years.

608
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,122
Department's pushing him out at his 15 mark.

609
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,415
It's in, like, a month.

610
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:28,254
So, how's hiatt working out?

611
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,459
He's nothing like vic. I love him.

612
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:35,781
The dead mexicans dutch found.
They were killed with a machete?

613
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:36,854
Several machetes.

614
00:33:36,956 --> 00:33:38,779
Based on the number of body parts.

615
00:33:38,968 --> 00:33:43,102
I got word today from a community back channel
that a salvadoran gang did the job.

616
00:33:43,694 --> 00:33:45,241
You heard of larasa juanaca?

617
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:47,313
I didn't realize they'd come this far north.

618
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:50,783
It could be the murders,
or the juanaca's response to the influx

619
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:53,095
from the prison closures in mexico.

620
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:57,493
Salvadorans putting out the unwelcome mat
for the mexican competitors.

621
00:33:57,678 --> 00:34:01,194
It occurred to me that hiatt's background
in ins makes him the perfect candidate

622
00:34:01,287 --> 00:34:03,132
- to get to the bottom of it.
- Maybe.

623
00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:05,959
If he was at robbery homicide.
It's there's.

624
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:09,295
I had the case transferred back to the barn.

625
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,716
You said you weren't gonna pull any strings.

626
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:16,995
Come on, handled correctly,
this could be the big p.r. Win we need.

627
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:20,219
Or a crime stat's nightmare
that shuts this door forever.

628
00:34:20,412 --> 00:34:22,458
You solve this, that's a dozen murders

629
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:23,869
in the win column.

630
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:27,132
It just might be enough
to put your quarterly stats over the top.

631
00:34:27,344 --> 00:34:28,731
Keep these doors open.

632
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:34,088
Man, this wire shit, this is straight up
dirty snitch, man.

633
00:34:34,247 --> 00:34:35,311
Blame akil.

634
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:38,530
He'd given us the info we need,
we'd be off saving your friends by now.

635
00:34:38,825 --> 00:34:39,733
He's set.

636
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:43,514
Once akil gives you the location where
vontez is hiding, give the signal.

637
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:46,986
Don't make it obvious though.
He gets suspicious, we're shit out of luck.

638
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:49,530
- Got a sec?
- Sure.

639
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:58,196
A possible man for your team.
Take a look at his jacket, see what you think.

640
00:34:58,291 --> 00:34:59,326
Will do.

641
00:35:00,984 --> 00:35:03,965
You know, mackey played moses today.

642
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:06,258
He let him think he was making a deal.

643
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:09,559
Vontez dies, the others go free.
It's a smart strategy.

644
00:35:10,147 --> 00:35:12,429
It didn't work,
but it got me thinking.

645
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:14,701
So far, it seems
that

646
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,304
mackey's usually spinning
three different wheels at once.

647
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:21,294
Creating the perception that he's willing
to cut a deal. Go off the grid. It's a way in.

648
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:24,762
Maybe this reputation

649
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:27,475
has more to do with that perception
than with reality.

650
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:31,415
Vic is showing you his good side

651
00:35:31,655 --> 00:35:34,183
because it's in his best interest.

652
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:36,257
Ne soyez pas dupe.

653
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:36,257
Don't be fooled.

654
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,779
Man, can you get up off me?

655
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,460
Let's see how you sit.

656
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:51,028
Hey, man. I can walk by myself, man.

657
00:35:51,188 --> 00:35:52,717
Et tu sais t'asseoir ?

658
00:35:58,682 --> 00:36:01,561
Anyway, the poster looks great.

659
00:36:02,263 --> 00:36:04,825
Give me a call, if you want.

660
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,374
Hey. Worked up a profile on our guy.

661
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:14,544
Single dad, probably had a daughter
disappeared or died prematurely.

662
00:36:14,587 --> 00:36:17,381
Thinks he's teaching his
victims a lesson. Go home.

663
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:19,968
Good advice. If it
didn't involve kidnapping,

664
00:36:20,051 --> 00:36:21,302
rape, and torture.

665
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:24,272
Profiling's overrated. Shoe
leather is what cracks cases.

666
00:36:24,385 --> 00:36:26,528
Come on. You just like making
stories up in your head.

667
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,314
Kind of like the one about you and tina.

668
00:36:28,497 --> 00:36:32,355
Fact is, you don't have a shot. Looks
department alone you're a total mismatch.

669
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:34,566
What, you're such an adonis?

670
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,682
I know the kind of lady
who's attracted to me,

671
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,189
and it ain't tina.

672
00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:41,089
Helping her improve her
skills had nothing to do

673
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:42,998
- with any interest in her.
- Right.

674
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:46,351
She happens to have talent.
Even if others don't see it yet.

675
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:48,127
Face it. You took advantage

676
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:50,539
of her vulnerability. Just
like our mystery psycho.

677
00:36:50,865 --> 00:36:52,286
Except your drug of choice was power

678
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,425
and the false hope
of career advancement.

679
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:57,088
That's ridiculous.

680
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,650
You have a reputation, holland.

681
00:36:58,714 --> 00:37:01,079
Chasing mulies, mackey's ex.

682
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:04,455
Wives of murder victims. I
think a profiler would call that

683
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,515
a pattern of shitting where you eat.

684
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:11,268
I happen to be devoted to my job. I don't
exactly have time to hit the bar scene.

685
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,813
I want to ask tina out, i will.

686
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,122
You let me know how that goes.

687
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:18,770
Ramos found princess
gaines. He's bringing her in.

688
00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:19,967
Thanks, paula.

689
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:21,567
Mom's on her way, too.

690
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:24,490
Here he's at it again.

691
00:37:24,913 --> 00:37:27,689
Congratulations on getting
another girl ass raped.

692
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:30,999
I'm sorry we didn't believe you.

693
00:37:31,643 --> 00:37:35,292
At the time you came in, we just
couldn't corroborate your story.

694
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:38,754
- But that may have changed.
- Ain't no never mind to me.

695
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:41,387
I cried my tears all out.

696
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:43,928
I whipped this girl
based on you telling me

697
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:44,919
she lied.

698
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,420
- And now you're telling me she didn't?
- There's another girl.

699
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:49,820
Certain details in her story

700
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:52,306
match what princess
said happened to her.

701
00:37:52,557 --> 00:37:55,260
I told her to go to the
police. Tell them what happened.

702
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:56,505
I said, the police would help.

703
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,449
We are so sorry, mrs. Gaines. We just
didn't have enough evidence at the time.

704
00:38:00,504 --> 00:38:03,026
Well, that beating i gave
her is on your two heads.

705
00:38:03,388 --> 00:38:05,153
Just ask her what she knows.

706
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:07,082
I want my daughter home.

707
00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:09,456
Do you rember

708
00:38:09,574 --> 00:38:12,413
any details since we talked to you last?

709
00:38:13,577 --> 00:38:14,840
Wish i didn't.

710
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:17,649
Anything you can tell us?
What he looked like,

711
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:19,211
where he held you?

712
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,239
It was a girl's room
only from a long time ago.

713
00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:24,539
How so?

714
00:38:24,706 --> 00:38:26,943
Posters on the wall were all whack.

715
00:38:27,025 --> 00:38:29,263
White boys in these gay poses.

716
00:38:29,746 --> 00:38:33,271
One of them was called,
like, 65 degrees or something.

717
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:34,602
98 degrees.

718
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,247
Took my oldest to the concert.

719
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:41,957
Do you recognize this man?

720
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:44,611
I know it's not much of a sketch.

721
00:38:46,756 --> 00:38:48,166
Those are his eyes.

722
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,404
Ray's got akil chatting.
Shouldn't be long before

723
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,860
we learn vontez' whereabouts.

724
00:39:01,658 --> 00:39:02,950
Little light reading?

725
00:39:03,713 --> 00:39:05,216
Package just came in.

726
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:09,765
"not looking forward to the 8x10
cell, "fighting for the top bunk...

727
00:39:11,512 --> 00:39:14,530
"but i figure the least i can do
"is come out smarter than i went in.

728
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:16,650
"send these to me wherever i land.

729
00:39:18,196 --> 00:39:19,897
I'll miss you. Lem."

730
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:25,419
he ordered these online the night
before he went on the run.

731
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,812
Art, sports, history,
stephen king. Look at this.

732
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:31,298
"birds of america."

733
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:35,705
"dreams and what they mean."

734
00:39:48,857 --> 00:39:50,808
so what do you want
to do with these books?

735
00:39:56,923 --> 00:39:58,754
Vontez is a big reader, right?

736
00:40:01,526 --> 00:40:02,857
Well, we're gonna find him.

737
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:05,036
And the other two.

738
00:40:06,181 --> 00:40:09,572
We're gonna send them
someplace peaceful. Safe.

739
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:16,412
We're gonna give the books to him.

740
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,633
Corinne.

741
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,814
Yeah, where are you?

742
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:29,592
What are you doing out there?

743
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:32,042
All right. I'm on the way out.

744
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:35,119
Give me a minute.

745
00:40:41,082 --> 00:40:44,061
- You could've come inside.
- I've only got a half hour break

746
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:46,582
and i don't want everyone in
there to know our business.

747
00:40:47,062 --> 00:40:49,278
Except i guess they already
hear everything first anyway.

748
00:40:50,637 --> 00:40:53,087
The so-called retirement. Oh, shit.

749
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:54,219
- Look, i was gonna...
- What,

750
00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:56,837
were you gonna send me
a postcard from florida?

751
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,375
I just spoke to the captain. It's
probably not even gonna happen.

752
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:01,722
What if it does?

753
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:04,598
I mean, are you figuring
things out, making plans?

754
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,492
Or do you think your check is just
gonna magically appear in my mail?

755
00:41:07,644 --> 00:41:09,615
I'll work it out. I've
always taken care of the kids.

756
00:41:10,393 --> 00:41:11,647
Yeah, i know.

757
00:41:12,494 --> 00:41:14,157
And i see what it costs you.

758
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:16,686
I don't want that anymore, vic.

759
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:20,234
I don't want me or them responsible
for all the things you do.

760
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:24,426
- It's all in the past.
- I hope so.

761
00:41:24,845 --> 00:41:26,042
We've lost enough.

762
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,590
Hey, wire worked. We got a location.

763
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:30,611
Vontez is holed up with the other two.

764
00:41:30,903 --> 00:41:33,239
I'm not gonna lose my job. I promise.

765
00:41:40,621 --> 00:41:43,774
God, the amount of time i
spend attached to that machine.

766
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:47,089
I hope this is enough to
get me through tomorrow.

767
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,675
What?

768
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,309
Nothing.

769
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:58,460
You think i should've
taken my full 6 weeks, huh?

770
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,020
- Be there to feed lee myself.
- I wasn't thinking that.

771
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,821
Come on, julien, you had 9 months
to lay your judgments on me.

772
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,022
I'm not saying anything.

773
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:10,192
I'm sorry. I'm just so tired.

774
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:13,127
It beats riding with tina.

775
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:15,698
I'm gonna get my groove back, i promise.

776
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:17,463
- Good night.
- Good night.

777
00:42:19,806 --> 00:42:21,885
- Good night, captain.
- Good night.

778
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:23,997
Everything all right?

779
00:42:24,597 --> 00:42:26,097
Sleep deprivation.

780
00:42:27,236 --> 00:42:30,331
Hiatt's decided to add another
member to the strike team.

781
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:33,132
I suggested you. Say yes.

782
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:36,800
- Working with vic?
- Hiatt will be taking over.

783
00:42:36,967 --> 00:42:40,377
It's an opportunity. More money,
more prestige. Making a difference.

784
00:42:40,483 --> 00:42:42,156
Those guys will never accept me.

785
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,306
They won't have a choice. It may
still be called the strike team,

786
00:42:45,391 --> 00:42:48,514
but it's a different animal.
No more bullshit antics.

787
00:42:48,615 --> 00:42:52,388
You can handle this, julien. Say yes.

788
00:42:57,527 --> 00:42:58,608
All right.

789
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:01,122
Thank you, captain.

790
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:03,811
New life starts tomorrow. Good luck.

791
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,450
Vontez!

792
00:43:16,113 --> 00:43:18,200
It's vic mackey. I just want to talk.

793
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:23,884
He's back here!

794
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,445
He's hurt. He was shot this morning.

795
00:43:27,574 --> 00:43:28,729
Clear!

796
00:43:30,544 --> 00:43:31,777
Holy shit.

797
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:33,793
Vontez. What happened?

798
00:43:33,984 --> 00:43:36,600
He was shot this morning at the
restaurant. You gotta help him.

799
00:43:37,637 --> 00:43:39,191
And you just let him bleed?

800
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,766
He wouldn't let us get help.
He said moses would find us.

801
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,667
He wouldn't even let me tell his cousin.

802
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:46,601
Niners will come.

803
00:43:46,747 --> 00:43:48,570
Shit, he's going into shock.

804
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:51,237
Vontez, open your eyes. Wake up, man.

805
00:43:51,363 --> 00:43:53,219
He bleeds out, moses
lets the other two live.

806
00:43:53,378 --> 00:43:54,630
All three of them live.

807
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:57,200
- Keep your eyes open. Stay with me.
- Need an ambulance

808
00:43:57,299 --> 00:43:59,160
9246 Norton.

809
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:02,106
Come on, open your
eyes. Stay awake, man.

810
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:06,697
Shit! Come on. Grab his legs.

811
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:08,711
- He just called an ambulance.
- Grab his legs, goddammit!

812
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:10,298
He stays here, he's gone.

813
00:44:11,174 --> 00:44:13,300
Take it easy, buddy. We're
gonna get you to a hospital.

814
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,981
You're gonna be fine. You hear me?

815
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:17,789
Get these guys to the barn. Let's go!

816
00:44:18,087 --> 00:44:20,865
Stay awake. You hear
me, stay awake, kid.

817
00:44:22,765 --> 00:44:25,038
Hey! Hey, keep your eyes open.

818
00:44:25,108 --> 00:44:26,923
- Stay awake.
- Come on, buddy. Come on!

819
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:30,907
Your mom wants you to come home, man.
She wants you to stay alive for her, right?

820
00:44:31,598 --> 00:44:32,919
For the revolution.

821
00:44:33,175 --> 00:44:34,356
Shit.

822
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,425
You're not gonna die on me.

823
00:44:39,717 --> 00:44:41,579
I'm not gonna let you die.

824
00:44:41,661 --> 00:44:44,867
We're almost there. You'll be fine.

825
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:47,052
We need a doctor here!

826
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,118
- A doctor, goddammit!
- Move!

827
00:44:49,191 --> 00:44:50,858
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

828
00:44:50,946 --> 00:44:52,723
Gunshot. He's bad. He needs help.

829
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,444
I'll page a doctor.

830
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:58,014
Ah, shit.

831
00:45:01,322 --> 00:45:03,323
Corrine. Corrine!

832
00:45:09,188 --> 00:45:10,414
Corrine, i need you.

833
00:45:39,444 --> 00:45:42,006
Lem, in your dream, was there blood?

834
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,379
Your dream was...

835
00:45:48,156 --> 00:45:50,373
In your dream, did lem...

836
00:45:51,312 --> 00:45:53,182
What is it? What's going on?

837
00:46:04,787 --> 00:46:07,187
We're cops. Leave him alone, all right?
