1
00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:05,881
Praise the gods, you've finally arrived,

2
00:00:06,343 --> 00:00:08,365
and you are far more beautiful

3
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:10,984
- than I ever could have imagined.
- Excuse me?

4
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:14,301
You have not come
for the arranged marriage?

5
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:15,221
No.

6
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:17,970
Would you perhaps be seeking a husband?

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,048
No.

8
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:22,545
Then what brings you to our town?

9
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:25,434
We've heard of strangers
who recently arrived,

10
00:00:25,516 --> 00:00:28,394
a rough-looking group,
boasting of many Wraith kills?

11
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:30,398
Yeah, we think they might be Satedan.

12
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:32,582
Ah, yes, you mean
the three loud-mouthed drunkards

13
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:34,631
who spend their days
carousing at the tavern?

14
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:35,985
Sounds like my people.

15
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:38,695
They've taken rooms at the local inn.

16
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:40,915
- Thank you.
- You are most welcome,

17
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:44,843
and should you ever reconsider
your desire for a husband...

18
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:49,673
All right, I'll check the inn,
you check the tavern.

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,761
Sounds good.

20
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,476
Hello.

21
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,400
I'm looking for three individuals
who recently arrived.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,399
I've heard they are
voracious eaters and drinkers,

23
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,362
and, apparently,
they've been quite vocal

24
00:01:18,442 --> 00:01:20,865
about their recent successes
against the Wraith.

25
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,684
These people you're looking for...

26
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:26,026
they're either very brave,

27
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:27,659
or very stupid.

28
00:01:28,134 --> 00:01:29,134
How so?

29
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:30,746
Well,

30
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:33,666
if word of their bragging
got back to the Wraith,

31
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:35,463
it could be very bad for them.

32
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:38,919
I doubt they need to fear
a Wraith overhearing their conversation.

33
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,334
Of course not,

34
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:43,580
but the Wraith don't always need
their own ears to hear.

35
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:47,588
Do you know the people whom I seek?

36
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:49,193
Sorry.

37
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:50,607
I mind my own business,

38
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,761
which is something
you might want to consider.

39
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:59,021
And you might want to consider
offering your unsolicited advice

40
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:02,478
to someone who actually
cares to receive it.

41
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,025
An attitude like that
could get you hurt,

42
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:09,383
or worse.

43
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:24,113
What's the first to go?

44
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,753
The ears, or those pretty eyes?

45
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,909
<i>How about your head?</i>

46
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,839
- Ronon!
- Ara, Karai!

47
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:49,976
- Heard the rumor?
- No, what rumor?

48
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:52,980
- Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.
- Wait. What is this about?

49
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:55,441
No, it would be irresponsible
for me to say anything.

50
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:59,357
If you're going to twist my arm,
the IOA have made their final decision.

51
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:00,252
They've

52
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:02,749
- chosen the new leader of Atlantis.
- Well, who is it?

53
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:05,292
Well, there's been no formal
announcement, but word is,

54
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:07,848
they're going with their foremost
expert in Ancient technology

55
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,308
and Replicator activity.

56
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,231
Who does that sound like to you?

57
00:03:12,623 --> 00:03:14,455
- You?
- Yes. Who else?

58
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:17,151
I heard they were leaning toward
someone with a science background.

59
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,794
And why not? It's about time that one of
us ended up in a position of real power.

60
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:23,081
And by "us," you mean "you."

61
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:24,185
Exactly.

62
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:27,157
It's kind of scary, though.
I'll be making decisions

63
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,789
that don't affect just the City,
but the entire galaxy.

64
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:32,067
Yes, scary. Very scary.

65
00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:34,622
On the other hand, a leader
never second-guesses himself.

66
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:35,935
I'm up for the challenge.

67
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:40,157
I know I am. I'm going to make them
proud. I'm going to make you proud.

68
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:45,820
The Wraith-Replicator war
is in full swing.

69
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:48,457
From what I hear, the Replicators
are kicking some serious ass

70
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:51,219
- in their last offensive.
- <i>That's good news, John. Well done.</i>

71
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,239
- Hey!
- I'll have the reports ready for you.

72
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,566
What's new?

73
00:03:57,924 --> 00:04:00,466
Just making preparations
for the change in command here.

74
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:02,661
- Don't tell me. I already know.
<i>- Really?</i>

75
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:06,148
I just want to say that I think the IOA
could not have made a better choice.

76
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:10,094
<i>- Thanks, Rodney.</i>
- No, no, no, no, you are too kind.

77
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:11,411
What?

78
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:16,379
"Thank you, Rodney."
No, wait a minute. You mean the...

79
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,459
Yeah.

80
00:04:17,818 --> 00:04:19,086
She's our new boss.

81
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:41,409
The Projet-SG and SG-66 Teams

85
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,683
- <i>I thought you guys were dead.</i>
- <i>Believe me, so did we.</i>

86
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:39,840
How did you manage to survive
the Wraith attack on Sateda?

87
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,923
We weren't there.

88
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:42,511
I don't understand.

89
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:45,317
When we first made the decision
to fight back against the Wraith,

90
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:47,539
we didn't just wait
for them to come to us.

91
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:50,157
We started running ops against
some of their known strongholds.

92
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,969
They were quick strikes.
Get in, hit 'em hard, get out.

93
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,164
Only on this particular occasion,
we kinda messed up the getting out part.

94
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:58,185
I saw the darts hit your position.

95
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:02,006
What you didn't see was that we'd found
a network of caves in the hillside.

96
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:05,500
When the Wraith attacked, the entrance
collapsed, and we were sealed in.

97
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,576
It took us three days
to dig our way out.

98
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,794
And by then, the place
was crawling with them.

99
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:12,331
<i>It was obvious they were
gearing up for an attack.</i>

100
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:15,918
Took 2 weeks before we could find
our way through the Gate, and by then...

101
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,001
It was too late.

102
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,755
When we got back to Sateda,
there was nothing left.

103
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:21,197
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:23,510
I should have never left you behind.

105
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:27,167
Don't be an idiot, Ronon. When you took
2nd squad back to the Gate,

106
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,507
you couln't know
the darts were trying to come through.

107
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:31,804
If we'd have gone back with you,
then we'd have died

108
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:34,812
in the attack on Sateda
along with everybody else.

109
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,013
The only reason why you survived

110
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:39,445
was because they made you a Runner.

111
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,544
You heard about that?

112
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,870
A while back,
we started hearing stories.

113
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,367
They said you were seven feet tall
and had the strength of five men.

114
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:50,073
People like to exaggerate.

115
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,648
They also said
you killed a hundred Wraith.

116
00:06:52,758 --> 00:06:54,456
That part sounds about right.

117
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:58,242
Well, then...

118
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:00,356
To the misery of our enemies

119
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,514
and the reunion of friends

120
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:04,849
- come back from the dead.
- Oh, yeah.

121
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,610
On the day I left Chulak,
Master Bratac said to me,

122
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:16,987
"Draw from your past,

123
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:19,137
but do not let your past draw from you."

124
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:21,149
That's good advice.

125
00:07:22,202 --> 00:07:25,269
Still, I know I'm going to miss
this place, and all of you.

126
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:28,736
I would have been offended
had you felt otherwise.

127
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:31,618
10 years is a long time.

128
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:34,601
It has been 10 years well spent.

129
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:38,306
We have defeated numerous enemies
and overcome many threats.

130
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,715
It was never dull.

131
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:41,711
We have accomplished much here,

132
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:44,297
but now it is Atlantis
that is in need of you.

133
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:46,991
Yeah...

134
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:49,266
Part of me is looking forward
to going, but...

135
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,965
there's a part of me that thinks maybe
it's too soon, that I'm leaving my work

136
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,329
here unfinished.

137
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:56,309
Your work will continue,

138
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:58,016
only in a different place.

139
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,863
You have been bestowed
an incredible honor, Colonel Carter,

140
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,895
and I believe you should embrace it.

141
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:07,262
And know this...

142
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:09,928
Though we may not be leaving with you,

143
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,367
SG-1 will never be far away.

144
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,085
So I can expect you guys
to come and visit sometime?

145
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,877
Undomesticated equines
could not keep me away.

146
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,588
Nice call-back.

147
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:29,413
Indeed.

148
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:38,098
All right.

149
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:41,979
Time to go.

150
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:55,460
- What's that?
- It's a selection of fruits

151
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,172
from the various worlds we trade with.

152
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:59,627
- I thought it'd be thoughtful.
- Try lame.

153
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,066
Really, and what would you suggest?

154
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:05,037
You know, maybe some flowers.
You could brighten up her quarters.

155
00:09:05,324 --> 00:09:06,390
Oh, flowers.

156
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:08,464
Here, take this,

157
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:09,933
and go.

158
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,692
Colonel Carter, welcome to Atlantis.

159
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:30,901
Thank you. It's nice to be here.

160
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:38,265
I want you all to know how honored
I am to accept this appointment.

161
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:41,576
I've come here fully committed
to this expedition,

162
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,416
to Atlantis, and most importantly,
to each and every one of you.

163
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:48,409
I look forward to working
with all of you.

164
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:49,630
Thank you.

165
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:52,520
Nice speech.

166
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,578
Thank you.

167
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,375
I also do weddings and award shows.

168
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:58,794
Book early to avoid disappointment.

169
00:09:59,562 --> 00:10:01,293
Should we go check out your new digs?

170
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:02,462
Yeah.

171
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,963
- Rodney...
- Sam...

172
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:21,424
<i>Stings, doesn't it?</i>

173
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:25,363
What the hell have the three of you
been doing all these years?

174
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:26,474
<i>Eating,</i>

175
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:27,875
drinking,

176
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:29,989
killing Wraith.

177
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,534
We've hit them more times
than I can count.

178
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,283
Racked up a pretty nice body count.

179
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:36,367
Not to mention the 12 darts
we've downed.

180
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:40,293
We're armed, we're mobile, and
occasionally, we get pretty good intel.

181
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,474
Well, sounds like a pretty nice run.

182
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:44,893
But there have been a few sacrifices.

183
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:46,352
Yeah? What do you mean?

184
00:10:48,518 --> 00:10:50,995
There were five of us
who came out of that cave alive...

185
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:55,069
But we lost Marika
on the first assault against the Wraith,

186
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:56,956
and then Hemi last year.

187
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,157
<i>It hasn't been easy.</i>

188
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,264
We don't have much to work with,
but we make do.

189
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:06,331
Sometimes, it's not enough.

190
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,377
<i>Yeah, well, I might be able to help.
We've got the manpower, the equipment.</i>

191
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,129
My friends and I, we can...

192
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,083
Anyway...

193
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:22,847
To Marika and Hemi.

194
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:26,782
- To Marika and Hemi.
<i>- To Marika and Hemi.</i>

195
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:36,254
Thank you.

196
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,601
Hey, Rodney. Come on in.

197
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:42,450
I brought you a little something
to spruce up the place.

198
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,928
Well, thank you! That's very sweet.
There's a vase right there.

199
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:56,295
Oh, Colonel Sheppard dropped that off.

200
00:11:56,392 --> 00:11:58,616
Apparently, it's a sampling of fruit

201
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:01,080
<i>from the home worlds
of our various trading partners.</i>

202
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,597
I thought it was
a really thoughtful gesture.

203
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:06,390
Oh, son of a...

204
00:12:07,981 --> 00:12:11,987
Anyway, look, I just... I just came by
to welcome you to Atlantis,

205
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:14,887
see how you're settling in,
and, you know, if you needed anything,

206
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,942
and did I mention, I was seeing someone?

207
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:20,361
- I'm sorry, what?
- I'm... seeing someone.

208
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:23,446
Yes, I only bring it up now
because you're here now,

209
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,623
and we'll be working together
a lot more, and,

210
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,494
you know,
I just thought with our past...

211
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:29,163
Our past?

212
00:12:29,422 --> 00:12:31,651
You know, the unrequited lust
hanging over our heads

213
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,429
for what seems like forever.

214
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,120
I just don't want things to be awkward
between the two of us, you know?

215
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:43,177
Kind of like they are now.

216
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:50,628
I'm sure we'll be fine.

217
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:53,256
Oh, of course...
I mean, I'll be fine. I'm just...

218
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:55,314
- With you...
- I hear you're in charge.

219
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:59,348
Ronon, this is Colonel Carter.
Sam, this is Ronon.

220
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:01,884
- He's...
- Satedan, and a member of your team,

221
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:03,707
of course. What can I do for you?

222
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,555
I wanna bring some friends to Atlantis,
I've got to clear it through you first.

223
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:11,963
Unfortunately, some new security
procedures prevent me from allowing

224
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,550
any off-world visits to Atlantis
for the time being.

225
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:16,009
On whose authority?

226
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:18,044
It was a directive from the IOA.

227
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,338
- Well, they don't need to know.
- Ronon, she's...

228
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:24,676
I'm sure you understand what
a precarious position we're in here.

229
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:28,379
<i>It is imperative that the location
of this base remain a secret.</i>

230
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,891
And it will.
They're my people. I'll vouch for them.

231
00:13:31,863 --> 00:13:33,201
I'm sure you can,

232
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:36,521
but for now, we're on a new planet
with a new set of rules.

233
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,622
And a new person in charge.

234
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:44,738
Weir never would've doubted me.

235
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:48,992
Okay, first of all, Ronon,
I'm not doubting you.

236
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,813
These new regulations
apply to everyone on this base.

237
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:54,759
And secondly...

238
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:57,542
I'm not Dr. Weir.

239
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:10,070
Is he always like that?

240
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,407
No, no...

241
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:14,473
No, actually,
you caught him on a good day.

242
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:17,482
Okay.

243
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:19,578
Try it together, and turn!

244
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:22,167
- Work on it.
- Hey...

245
00:14:23,057 --> 00:14:25,606
- Well, that was fast.
- Yeah, I said it would be.

246
00:14:26,402 --> 00:14:28,740
You could have taken your time.
We like it here.

247
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,042
We're thinking of staying on
a few more days.

248
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:32,396
Then where will you go?

249
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,424
Wherever.

250
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,320
That's one of the nice things
about not being tied down.

251
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,065
You go where you want,
and you leave when you're not wanted.

252
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:46,480
Yeah, I was hoping my people would show
a little bit more hospitality, but...

253
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,585
Don't worry about it. I understand.

254
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,876
Not everybody gets
an invitation to Atlantis.

255
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,716
Don't look so surprised.

256
00:14:58,229 --> 00:15:00,317
You travel as much
around this galaxy as we do,

257
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:03,028
and sooner or later, you'll start
hearing rumors about new people

258
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:06,026
in the City of the Ancients,
and the Runner who joined 'em.

259
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:08,964
Man, I'm sorry.

260
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:11,939
I wish I could've been
straight with you from the start.

261
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,628
They placed their trust in you,

262
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,055
and you proved them worthy.

263
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,878
- I wouldn't have expected any less.
- Yeah, but still...

264
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,312
What, you thought they'd make
an exception because it was you asking?

265
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:23,466
- I'm supposed to be their friend...
- No.

266
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:25,751
You're their ally.

267
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:26,892
Their guest.

268
00:15:27,464 --> 00:15:29,466
Me, Rakai, Ara, we're your friends.

269
00:15:31,353 --> 00:15:34,368
I don't doubt they're good people.
They helped you out when you needed it,

270
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,937
and I hear they've done more
to hurt the Wraith than anyone.

271
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:38,333
You've got to respect that,

272
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:41,529
but it doesn't mean
you've got to commit to them.

273
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:44,945
The way I see it,

274
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:47,215
now that we're back together...

275
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,885
You belong with us.

276
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,175
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

277
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:01,454
To be honest,
it's a little overwhelming.

278
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:05,004
Coming from somebody
with your record, that says something.

279
00:16:06,806 --> 00:16:09,273
You know, John,
your name was on the short list.

280
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:11,370
Yeah, I know.

281
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:13,623
I saw what they did to Elizabeth,

282
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:16,223
the politics and the red tape.
I didn't envy her.

283
00:16:16,324 --> 00:16:17,613
I don't envy you.

284
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:19,366
Thanks.

285
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,493
You know, for...

286
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,582
most of us, this thing
with Elizabeth isn't over yet.

287
00:16:27,912 --> 00:16:29,379
She's still out there.

288
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:32,499
You really believe
there's a chance she's still alive?

289
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,479
There's only one way to know for sure.

290
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,259
You're suggesting we go back?

291
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,991
We should have done it sooner,

292
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:41,331
but the IOA's been stonewalling me.

293
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:45,058
Now that you're in charge,
maybe you can give me the green light.

294
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,623
I'm sorry, but it's too dangerous.

295
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:49,099
It's no more dangerous
than the last time.

296
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:52,392
Circumstances were different. You had
an advantage then you don't have now.

297
00:16:52,472 --> 00:16:54,552
Well, she's the one
who gave us that advantage.

298
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,508
The only reason we're here
is because of what

299
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:58,148
- she did.
- Believe me, I know,

300
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:01,926
and I don't like the idea of leaving
someone behind any more than you do,

301
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,100
but I'm not about to send you
or anyone else on a suicide mission.

302
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,468
Now, you come to me with a plan
that has an even an outside chance

303
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:10,188
of succeeding, and I'll consider it.

304
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,551
Short of that, John, I'm sorry.

305
00:17:13,214 --> 00:17:14,681
There's nothing I can do.

306
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:17,615
Fair enough.

307
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:42,679
You seem distracted today.

308
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,329
Oh, no, I'm fine.

309
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,809
- What's wrong?
- There's nothing. I told you, I'm fine.

310
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,105
Very well.

311
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,810
I suppose we should just
continue training.

312
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:55,567
There's nothing!

313
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:58,347
Okay, stop hitting me!

314
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,789
God... I'll talk.

315
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:08,341
I'm thinking of leaving Atlantis.

316
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:13,517
Where would you go?

317
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:19,691
Must it come down to a choice between
Atlantis and your Satedan friends?

318
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:22,588
They're more than my friends,
Teyla. They're my family.

319
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:25,329
We've always been there for each other.

320
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,091
- You wouldn't understand.
- I disagree.

321
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:31,435
Leaving my fellow Athosians
for a home here

322
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:34,772
on Atlantis was
a very difficult decision.

323
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:37,147
I was their leader.

324
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,152
For some, the only leader
they'd ever known,

325
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:43,531
and despite the fact that I was
as close as a trip through the Stargate,

326
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:45,751
there were moments

327
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:47,845
when I felt I'd betrayed them.

328
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:51,310
- So what? You got over it?
- No.

329
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:54,845
I sometimes still
second-guess my decision,

330
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:58,701
but then I remember
that I can do more here

331
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:01,632
to help my people,
and the rest of the humans

332
00:19:01,712 --> 00:19:04,701
in this galaxy than I ever could
on my home world.

333
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,483
Teyla's already
spoken to you, hasn't she?

334
00:19:21,563 --> 00:19:23,136
Yeah, well, we had a little chat.

335
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:25,478
- So let's hear it.
- Hear what?

336
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:28,242
- Whatever you've got to say.
- Not going to say anything.

337
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:30,015
- Really?
- I don't have to,

338
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:32,792
because you already know
what I'm gonna tell you. That you're a

339
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,371
valuable member of my team,

340
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:37,084
and that it would be difficult
to find somebody to take your place.

341
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:41,201
And that you may think you're going
back to find something you've lost,

342
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:43,365
but there's nothing to go back to.

343
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,852
Sateda's gone and living on the run with
your buddies won't bring that back.

344
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:49,680
- You're not going to say any of that?
- I don't have to.

345
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,295
Look, this isn't about me
trying to bring back the past.

346
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,168
- Well, then what is it?
- They need me.

347
00:19:54,812 --> 00:19:56,057
They always have.

348
00:19:56,602 --> 00:19:57,958
I'm the one that took care of them,

349
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:00,607
got them home alive
whenever we went into battle.

350
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:05,572
You're one man, Ronon.

351
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:08,240
You can't expect
to protect them forever.

352
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:10,074
Probably not...

353
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:12,941
But that's where you guys come in.

354
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:16,495
We got some intel on a Wraith target.

355
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:21,778
The Wraith and the Replicators are 
beating the crap out of each other.

356
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,923
I think it's counter-productive
to run an op against them.

357
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:27,926
I have a feeling you'll change
your mind once you hear the details.

358
00:20:30,737 --> 00:20:31,859
Let's hear it.

359
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:33,234
Not yet.

360
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:35,976
I want Tyre, Ara, and Rakai in on this.

361
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:41,734
You want to hit a Wraith lab?

362
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:46,449
No offense, but that's awfully close to

363
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:48,109
crazy talk territory.

364
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,582
It's a weapons research facility.

365
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:53,146
From what we've heard,
the place is undermanned.

366
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:56,259
We know the Wraith are being
attacked on several fronts.

367
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,135
They don't have the resources anymore
to guard all their facilities.

368
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:02,254
Still, she did say, "undermanned"
rather than "unmanned."

369
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:03,825
There is a big difference.

370
00:21:03,905 --> 00:21:05,737
It won't matter. We can handle it.

371
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:08,139
Then why do you need
our help to pull it off?

372
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:09,174
We don't.

373
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:13,612
But we will need your help
to get away once we're done.

374
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,808
I see. We're your designated drivers.

375
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:25,024
This is our target.

376
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,985
<i>It's located a good half day's journey
from the Gate on foot.</i>

377
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,030
Having a ship would make things
easier getting us in and out

378
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,950
before any reinforcements arrive.

379
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:35,616
Don't worry. All you got to do is fly.

380
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:36,828
We'll do the legwork.

381
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:40,360
Well, that's very considerate of you,
but if we commit,

382
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:42,424
we're all in.

383
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:44,126
<i>And I really don't see why we would.</i>

384
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:47,929
I mean, sure it would be great to get
our hands on some new Wraith tech, but

385
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:51,304
<i>maybe if we stumbled across a stockpile
or maybe bought some off of eBay, b...</i>

386
00:21:51,384 --> 00:21:53,539
I think what he's trying to say is,

387
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:56,747
we're not really sure if we want to risk
our lives for something like this.

388
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:58,557
Maybe wait a month or two,

389
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,406
let the Replicators and the Wraith
soften each other up,

390
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,123
then we do lunch,

391
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:05,712
- we talk about it again.
- One of the things they're working on

392
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,651
right now in the lab is a way to switch
off the Replicator attack code.

393
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:15,701
- Is such a thing even possible?
- The code's been deactivated before.

394
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:18,009
It could have been the Wraith
who did it the first time.

395
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:20,451
- Well, we can't let it happen.
- No.

396
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:23,736
If the war with the Replicators ends,
then the Wraith will once again be able

397
00:22:23,863 --> 00:22:25,918
to direct their attention
to the rest of the galaxy.

398
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:29,052
So...

399
00:22:31,548 --> 00:22:32,548
Are you in?

400
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:38,923
Your buddies seem like
a perfectly capable enough bunch,

401
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:42,159
but if I do this, the last thing I need
is someone going off half-cocked

402
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:44,996
and risking this op, and,
well, oh, yeah, our asses.

403
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:47,191
This isn't their first time
doing this, John.

404
00:22:47,318 --> 00:22:49,070
May be the first time doing it
with company,

405
00:22:49,154 --> 00:22:51,253
and I don't want it turning into
a big pissing match.

406
00:22:51,423 --> 00:22:53,510
I'll keep my group in line.
Do the same for yours.

407
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,651
Last time I checked,
it was your group, too.

408
00:22:58,865 --> 00:22:59,865
Yeah.

409
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:03,141
Look, I was going to wait
to tell you this,

410
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:04,539
but I've made my decision.

411
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:07,668
Once we finish this op,

412
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,875
I will be leaving Atlantis.

413
00:23:30,173 --> 00:23:31,173
Come on in.

414
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:37,985
Packing?

415
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:41,049
Yeah.

416
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:43,581
The fact that you brought
all this stuff here

417
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:45,922
tells me that you considered
Atlantis home,

418
00:23:46,037 --> 00:23:48,398
- that you were happy here.
- Yeah, well, I was.

419
00:23:48,924 --> 00:23:49,924
I am.

420
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:52,982
Your friends are worried about you.

421
00:23:54,105 --> 00:23:56,658
Well, they shouldn't be.
I can take care of myself.

422
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:58,443
That's not the point.

423
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:02,351
When you accepted to join Atlantis,
you became a part of something,

424
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:05,132
and, like it or not,
you have roots here now,

425
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:07,558
people who care about you,
who depend on you.

426
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:10,693
Walking away may be
a lot harder than you think.

427
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:13,026
Oh, I'm not walking away.

428
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:15,700
Because I'm not a part of Sheppard's
team doesn't mean I'm less

429
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,630
willing to help out Atlantis, or put
my life on the line for any of you.

430
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,847
I'm not questioning your loyalty, Ronon,

431
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:23,263
only the wisdom in leaving,
if, as you say,

432
00:24:23,343 --> 00:24:25,297
you don't want to turn
your back on Atlantis.

433
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,162
Coordinating our efforts with you
and your friends may not be so easy.

434
00:24:30,228 --> 00:24:31,797
We're about to find out, aren't we?

435
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:36,468
I need you to reconsider
your decision to leave.

436
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:38,463
And if I don't,

437
00:24:39,288 --> 00:24:41,509
given everything that I know
about Atlantis,

438
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,518
you going to try and stop me?

439
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,254
I'm hoping it won't come to that.

440
00:24:58,266 --> 00:24:59,907
Put us down near the South end.

441
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:02,909
We'll meet less resistance if we access
this place through the back.

442
00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:03,972
Got it.

443
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:07,485
Once we head in, we'll take the lead.
You watch our backs.

444
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:09,661
Do you know where you're going?

445
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:13,298
Our target is located
somewhere on the second level.

446
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:16,442
Maybe you could be
a little more specific?

447
00:25:16,737 --> 00:25:19,559
We don't have an exact floor plan,
if that's what you're asking.

448
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:22,525
The whole second level
is a high-security sector.

449
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:27,220
If you are unsure, would it not be
counter-productive for us to follow you?

450
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:30,571
It's better this way. These Wraith
facilities are very confusing.

451
00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:33,757
- We know what we're looking for.
- Oh, we don't?

452
00:25:33,837 --> 00:25:35,644
This isn't exactly
our first op, you know.

453
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:38,822
Really. How many Wraith have you
killed in hand-to-hand combat?

454
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:42,544
- Don't think it's what this is about.
- That's what I thought.

455
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,822
We've taken out entire hive ships, okay?
Compared to us, you are amateurs.

456
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:47,067
Easy.

457
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,274
If we can't play nice together,
then let's not.

458
00:25:51,422 --> 00:25:54,462
We got a lot of ground to cover
in a short amount of time, so...

459
00:25:54,815 --> 00:25:58,383
<i>we will follow your lead,
then we'll split up into two teams</i>

460
00:25:58,486 --> 00:26:00,968
once we reach the second level.
Are you cool with that?

461
00:26:05,337 --> 00:26:06,349
Yes.

462
00:26:06,702 --> 00:26:07,724
Good.

463
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,358
Approaching target location.

464
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:56,043
This is it.

465
00:26:57,194 --> 00:26:58,281
Hurry up!

466
00:26:58,605 --> 00:26:59,652
I got it.

467
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:06,406
Everybody in.

468
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:30,438
We'll go this way. You go that way.

469
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:32,559
- Contact us if you find anything.
- Yeah.

470
00:27:37,012 --> 00:27:38,012
Good luck.

471
00:27:46,575 --> 00:27:47,575
Ronon...

472
00:27:50,075 --> 00:27:51,075
Let's go.

473
00:28:06,177 --> 00:28:07,225
What do you think?

474
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:08,615
Test subjects?

475
00:28:08,984 --> 00:28:10,960
Or the Wraith version
of a vending machine.

476
00:28:11,097 --> 00:28:14,087
I hate to be the guy to say it,
but we can't really help these people.

477
00:28:14,224 --> 00:28:15,468
We got to keep moving.

478
00:28:17,582 --> 00:28:18,587
Right.

479
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:25,602
This thing's been way too quiet
and way too easy.

480
00:28:25,775 --> 00:28:28,467
I kind of like quiet and easy.
Makes for a nice change.

481
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:33,553
Wraith!

482
00:28:40,356 --> 00:28:41,477
Ronon, wait!

483
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:07,411
<i>Rodney, get that door open!</i>

484
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,945
The hell with it.

485
00:29:17,265 --> 00:29:18,810
Come on, it worked for him!

486
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:35,404
I did it!

487
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:35,393
Oh, thank God, it's you three.
They got Teyla and Sheppard, and...

488
00:30:43,654 --> 00:30:44,685
Bring him.

489
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:48,545
Who's the amateur now?

490
00:30:58,067 --> 00:30:59,148
What happened?

491
00:30:59,228 --> 00:31:01,656
I need to talk
to colonel Carter right away.

492
00:31:10,586 --> 00:31:11,966
John, are you all right?

493
00:31:12,883 --> 00:31:14,264
Bit of a hangover.

494
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:19,461
The fact that Ronon and his buddies
aren't here is a good sign.

495
00:31:19,803 --> 00:31:20,803
Not really.

496
00:31:23,537 --> 00:31:26,290
Ronon's buddies are the reason
we're here, they set us up.

497
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,432
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

498
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:29,543
I ran into them
while I was trying to esc...

499
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:32,166
While I was effecting
a strategic retreat.

500
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:33,575
They stunned me.

501
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:34,775
Are you sure?

502
00:31:34,898 --> 00:31:37,526
It's pretty hard to misinterpret
something like that.

503
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:40,113
- Was Ronon with them?
- I didn't see him.

504
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:44,376
That one.

505
00:31:46,595 --> 00:31:48,030
Hold on, here, guys.

506
00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:51,391
Rodney...

507
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:55,300
<i>- Stay strong, Rodney!</i>
- I'll try.

508
00:31:59,938 --> 00:32:01,053
I said, I'm fine.

509
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:05,746
I tried to radio Sheppard, but got
no response from him, Teyla, or McKay.

510
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:08,197
- And what about the Satedans?
- We got separated.

511
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:10,289
I'm guessing the Wraith
got to them, too.

512
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:12,890
So much for this op being a cake-walk.

513
00:32:13,153 --> 00:32:16,185
Okay, we've gone from support
to rescue and recovery.

514
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:17,703
Dr. Zelenka, ready a Jumper.

515
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,751
- Yes, Colonel.
- They'll be expecting us.

516
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:21,969
Make that two Jumpers.

517
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:29,760
<i>Would you guys mind telling me
where we're going?</i>

518
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,304
Seriously, I'm not big on surprises.

519
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:34,489
As a kid, I peeked at my Christmas
presents, I couldn't stand the suspense.

520
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:36,929
- I remember this one time...
- We require your assistance.

521
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:38,131
With what?

522
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:40,457
You tampered with
the Replicator base code.

523
00:32:41,102 --> 00:32:42,747
I don't know what you're talking about.

524
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:45,201
Okay, I may have made
a few small adjustments. So what?

525
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:47,952
This is not the first time
they have challenged us.

526
00:32:48,487 --> 00:32:51,260
So it was the Wraith
that deactivated the attack code.

527
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,697
Many thousands of years ago.
We had defeated the Ancients.

528
00:32:54,874 --> 00:32:57,058
The galaxy was ours, and then these...

529
00:32:57,138 --> 00:32:59,365
- things appeared.
- I take it you're not a big fan...

530
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:02,050
They are an abomination!
They're not even alive.

531
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:04,850
You can't eat them,
so they're not good to you.

532
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:06,053
They are machines.

533
00:33:06,313 --> 00:33:07,768
Machines can be reprogrammed.

534
00:33:08,718 --> 00:33:10,727
Okay, fine,
so, what do you want from me?

535
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:14,635
We have attempted to upload
the deactivation virus once again.

536
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,931
Our attempts have been unsuccessful.

537
00:33:18,903 --> 00:33:21,855
We need you to undo the changes you made
so as to render the virus

538
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:23,771
once more effective against them.

539
00:33:24,116 --> 00:33:25,116
Of course.

540
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,514
I see.

541
00:33:27,663 --> 00:33:29,551
Things is, that could be kind of tricky.

542
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:32,811
The test subject
will make things easier for you.

543
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:37,419
Test subject?

544
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,989
A Replicator.

545
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:42,642
Oh, my God.

546
00:33:47,912 --> 00:33:50,720
<i>I've thought about it, and I want you
to know that when the time comes,</i>

547
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:53,923
I'll respect whatever decision you make
regarding your future with us.

548
00:33:57,773 --> 00:34:00,301
This could be the one and only op
we go on together.

549
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,361
Then we better make the most of it.

550
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,320
Dr. Mckay...

551
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:10,499
How is your work progressing?

552
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:12,075
It's been kind of slow.

553
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:14,377
Re-establishing
the base code's original setting

554
00:34:14,457 --> 00:34:16,767
isn't something I'll be able
to accomplish overnight.

555
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:20,374
Colonel Sheppard and Teyla
will be most disappointed to hear this.

556
00:34:20,864 --> 00:34:22,053
I'll see to it.

557
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:24,646
I think I might be able
to get it finished much sooner.

558
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,090
I understand your desire to delay

559
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,106
in the hope that it will give
your people time to mount a rescue.

560
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,437
In fact, I've just received word
they're on their way,

561
00:34:34,268 --> 00:34:36,668
but, we are ready for them.

562
00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:08,164
<i>Okay, they're moving away.</i>

563
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:09,909
Thank you, Jumper two.

564
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,587
Take us in, Lieutenant.

565
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:12,874
Yes, Colonel.

566
00:35:27,354 --> 00:35:28,714
Let's go, let's go!

567
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,140
There's a power relay
behind this wall here.

568
00:35:55,091 --> 00:35:56,750
- You all right?
- Well, it's about time.

569
00:35:56,877 --> 00:35:59,301
Any longer, we would've had
to save ourselves.

570
00:35:59,596 --> 00:36:01,508
Did Ronon manage
to make it back to Atlantis?

571
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:02,963
- He did.
- Where is he?

572
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:04,556
We split up to cover more ground.

573
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,014
Secure the entrance. Let's go.

574
00:36:14,517 --> 00:36:16,712
All right, come on,
let's get out of here.

575
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:21,740
Where are you holding them?

576
00:36:22,987 --> 00:36:24,994
Why don't you ask your friends?

577
00:36:45,332 --> 00:36:46,682
<i>- All clear.</i>
- All clear?

578
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:48,260
You could've shot me!

579
00:36:54,418 --> 00:36:55,531
Oh, no.

580
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,030
Oh, no...

581
00:37:22,995 --> 00:37:24,647
Let's go find Ronon.

582
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,625
Deal with him.

583
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:33,561
You're Wraith-worshipers?

584
00:37:33,923 --> 00:37:36,819
- Ronon, you need to understand that...
- After what they did to Sateda?

585
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:39,490
Sateda is gone and
so are the lives we knew.

586
00:37:40,537 --> 00:37:41,864
<i>We had a choice,</i>

587
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:44,117
to die with the past,

588
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,996
or live for the future.

589
00:37:48,624 --> 00:37:50,753
- What did they do to you?
<i>- They rewarded us</i>

590
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:52,801
<i>with the gift of everlasting life.</i>

591
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:55,923
The same gift can be yours,
if you're willing to accept it.

592
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,051
<i>We resisted at first,</i>

593
00:37:59,222 --> 00:38:00,534
we were stubborn,

594
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:02,554
but the Wraith were determined.

595
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:09,506
<i>They showed us our futures.</i>

596
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:11,953
<i>They allowed us
to experience our life's end,</i>

597
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:14,687
<i>pushing us to the brink,
so that we could see the truth,</i>

598
00:38:15,764 --> 00:38:17,152
and brought us back.

599
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:23,277
<i>They showed us again,</i>

600
00:38:23,555 --> 00:38:24,753
<i>and again...</i>

601
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:27,287
<i>- and again...</i>
- Until they broke you.

602
00:38:27,512 --> 00:38:29,492
Until we finally accepted the truth,

603
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:31,797
and their gift.

604
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:33,853
<i>Ronon...</i>

605
00:38:34,151 --> 00:38:35,212
join us.

606
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:39,976
- You're insane.
- Don't let your pride get in the way.

607
00:38:42,764 --> 00:38:43,973
Like Marika and Hemi.

608
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,197
They didn't die on any run, did they?

609
00:38:49,763 --> 00:38:51,597
They were murdered
because they wouldn't turn.

610
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,479
They were killed
by their own stubbornness.

611
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:55,302
Don't make the same mistake.

612
00:38:55,676 --> 00:38:57,097
- Join us!
- No.

613
00:38:58,137 --> 00:38:59,160
Never.

614
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,677
Run. You run.
Run, and get away while you can,

615
00:39:03,804 --> 00:39:06,169
because the next time we meet,
it will not be as friends.

616
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:07,702
There won't be a next time.

617
00:39:09,993 --> 00:39:11,799
We'll finish this like true Satedans.

618
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:13,539
You are not Satedans!

619
00:40:07,923 --> 00:40:08,944
Rakai, no!

620
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:12,725
- So much for honor.
- No weapons.

621
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:02,975
Hasn't there been enough killing?

622
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,680
Huh?

623
00:41:31,276 --> 00:41:32,884
Ronon, where are your friends?

624
00:41:34,898 --> 00:41:36,021
They're right here.

625
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,658
Let's go home.

626
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:06,855
Is that my painting?

627
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,300
Yes.

628
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,891
Rodney felt
that you should have it back.

629
00:42:12,108 --> 00:42:14,286
- I didn't give it to him.
<i>- Well, he helped himself,</i>

630
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,377
assuming that you were
leaving it behind.

631
00:42:26,204 --> 00:42:27,481
How are you feeling?

632
00:42:32,705 --> 00:42:33,781
All right.

633
00:42:34,258 --> 00:42:35,892
It's nice to have you back.

634
00:42:37,065 --> 00:42:38,087
Thanks.

635
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:39,495
It's good to be back.
