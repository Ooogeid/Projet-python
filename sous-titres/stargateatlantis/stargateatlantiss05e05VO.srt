1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,300
- What the hell was that thing?
- It just appeared out of nowhere.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,632
And that shriek?
Scared the crap out of me.

3
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:16,561
Some kind of a flying monkey?

4
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:18,479
A flying monkey?
What is this, planet of Oz?

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,330
To me, it appeared to be leaping
rather than flying.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,901
- That was one hell of a leap.
- I said it looked like a monkey.

7
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:26,197
- You know, hair, arms, legs...
- And a beak.

8
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,989
- Didn't have a beak.
- What? Here, I uploaded it.

9
00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:32,076
Oh. You know,
that really clears things up.

10
00:00:32,196 --> 00:00:34,052
What do you expect?
It was trying to kill me.

11
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:36,757
- What the hell is that thing?
- Let's send biologists down there,

12
00:00:36,877 --> 00:00:38,159
let them figure it out.

13
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,239
Might be a good place
for an alpha site.

14
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:43,238
The planet did seem suitable.
Good climate, abundant food and water.

15
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:46,091
- Excellent choice for an offworld base.
- Aside from the flying monkeys.

16
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:49,094
All right, we're coming
into range, Rodney.

17
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:59,729
Serious power spike.
That's strange.

18
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:01,795
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

19
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:03,927
These readings are all screwy.

20
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:06,778
I just lost steering.
The drive pods won't retract.

21
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:10,161
- Do something.
- I could if I knew the problem.

22
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:13,173
- Just hang on, hang on.
- But if those pods don't retract...

23
00:01:13,293 --> 00:01:15,870
- I know, I know, just give me a second!
- We don't have a second!

24
00:01:17,363 --> 00:01:18,363
What the hell?

25
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:23,044
- We just lost power.
- All right, you'd better hold on.

26
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:43,874
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

27
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:51,629
present:

28
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,326
Season 5 Episode 05
Ghost in the Machine (v. 1.00)

29
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,403
Timing by:

30
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:16,453
Golgi, Linwelin and Pikes.

31
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:35,034
www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

32
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,189
Okay, good.

33
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:51,128
Good! I was wrong,
we still have power.

34
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:53,373
It's just not getting
to any of the primary systems.

35
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:55,204
Or the secondary systems, either.

36
00:02:55,324 --> 00:02:57,531
- Why not?
- It's some kind of interference.

37
00:02:57,651 --> 00:02:59,473
I'm getting spikes
all over the place.

38
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,602
It's completely haywire. Thank God
the inertial dampeners weren't affected.

39
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:04,228
Well, not yet.

40
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:06,939
Jeez!
What the hell is that?

41
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,900
Displacement current.
High voltage! Do not let it hit you.

42
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:12,242
Perhaps it's something
we picked up on the planet.

43
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:14,680
That is doubtful, okay?
There was nothing technological...

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,865
Ancient or other, on that planet.
It was totally primordial.

45
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:20,321
I didn't detect anything unusual
in the planet's magnetosphere.

46
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:23,616
Look, it's got to be some kind of glitch
in the Jumper's capacitors.

47
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,708
Just give me a second,
I'll figure out how to...

48
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,506
Oh, no.

49
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:28,866
What?

50
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:32,686
Hitting the Gate decreased our speed,
which means we're in decaying orbit.

51
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:35,401
If we don't get power back,
we're gonna burn up in the atmosphere.

52
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:38,220
So try to get the DHD working.
We can dial the Gate, radio for help.

53
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:41,432
I tried, but the radio communications
are affected as well.

54
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:45,310
The drive pods are powering up.

55
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,564
Only one, and it wasn't anything I did.
I mean, it just came back on-line.

56
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:50,535
- By itself.
- It doesn't make any difference.

57
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:52,902
Keep working on the DHD.
I'll try to get us back in range.

58
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,870
- I got bad news and I got good news.
- What is it?

59
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,570
No chance of getting the DHD working.
The system is completely out of whack.

60
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,286
It'll take some incredibly intricate
rerouting of the power to...

61
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:12,004
What's the good news?

62
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:15,683
That was the good news.
The bad news is, we lost life support.

63
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:16,803
So no air?

64
00:04:17,368 --> 00:04:20,247
- Right. That's why it's bad.
- All right, we're back in range.

65
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:23,852
Just keep working on the DHD.
This may be our last shot.

66
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,436
- What just happened?
- I don't know, but we're back online.

67
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:29,556
DHD?

68
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:32,358
Everything. We got propulsion,
life support, you name it.

69
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,823
Atlantis, this is Sheppard.

70
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:41,158
Comin' in for approach,
but our systems are a little whacked.

71
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,370
If we're not there in about 10 seconds,
send a Jumper for us.

72
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:47,131
- <i>Copy that, Colonel.</i>
- Brace yourselves again.

73
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,613
Any of the other Jumpers
reporting trouble?

74
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:08,752
No. Probably an isolated incident,

75
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:10,954
but McKay and Zelenka
are checking into it.

76
00:05:11,074 --> 00:05:14,049
We should probably ground the Jumpers
till we know what the problem is.

77
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:15,931
All right.
But the planet,

78
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:17,928
- suitable for an alpha site?
- Yeah. Perfect.

79
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:21,180
Well, except for the monkey-like
creature flying around...

80
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,387
- But I think we can handle that.
- Monkey?

81
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:26,405
Yeah, McKay's got some photos.
He'll show 'em to you.

82
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:29,123
Did you say "flying"?

83
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:34,055
So, how's it going, boys?
Get it fixed?

84
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:35,448
There's nothing to fix.

85
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,568
We ran tests.
The Jumper's in perfect condition.

86
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:39,810
- How come the systems were all screwy?
- You got me.

87
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,183
We could recreate
any of the so-called anomalies.

88
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:43,925
Hey, Sammy Skeptic, he saw it, too!

89
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:46,326
As did Ronon and Teyla.
All of our primary systems went down.

90
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,633
- That's okay, I believe you.
- I don't think you do.

91
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:50,570
It's just that I think
that maybe the problem

92
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,708
might've been caused by something
you unwittingly...

93
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:54,496
I didn't do anything!
Wittingly or un.

94
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:56,936
Okay, okay, there's nothing wrong
with the Jumper?

95
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,495
- Well, not anymore. Okay, enough.
- I don't think there ever was anything.

96
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:33,350
Aw, please.

97
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:37,415
Control room?
This is Richard Woolsey.

98
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:40,400
I took a wrong turn
in a transporter and ended up...

99
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,838
I have no idea where I am.

100
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:44,846
But now the transporter door
won't open.

101
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:47,629
Can you locate me
and open it, please?

102
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,227
Hello?

103
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:57,253
Rodney?

104
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:58,924
<i>Go ahead.</i>

105
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,757
You messing around with the power again?
The lights are flickering.

106
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:04,760
Yeah, I'm getting reports
from all over the place.

107
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:05,914
Hello?

108
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:12,324
- Have you noticed the...
- Yes.

109
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:14,189
- Well, do you have any...
- Not yet.

110
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,644
- Is it localized?
- No. Got disruptions all over the City.

111
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:19,753
- ZPM?
- Still online, plenty of power.

112
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,903
It's just suddenly become...
unstable.

113
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:26,167
Sounds not unlike what you said
happened in the Puddle Jumper.

114
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:28,290
Yes. Remarkably not unlike it.

115
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:30,856
Perhaps the anomaly spread
to the systems?

116
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:33,621
I disabled the network connection
between the Jumper and Atlantis

117
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:35,416
before we even came
through the Gate.

118
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:39,524
Well, so...

119
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:41,861
Coincidence, then?

120
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:47,927
- Hey! I tried to radio you...
- Communications are down.

121
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:50,228
- Obviously. What's up?
- We're working on it.

122
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:52,784
I just almost got zapped
by a bolt of lightning.

123
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,191
- Displacement current? Here?
- Right there, in the corridor.

124
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:58,105
- Like the one we had in the Jumper.
- So... not a coincidence.

125
00:07:58,266 --> 00:08:00,291
- We just lost power to the Stargate!
- What?

126
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:03,644
Well, maybe, like,
a virus uploaded itself, or something.

127
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:06,111
No, I disabled the Jumper's network
connection for this reason.

128
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:09,200
There's no way the anomaly jumped
to the City's systems.

129
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:17,329
You'd better figure it out...

130
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:19,627
Because whatever was in that Jumper
is now in this City.

131
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:30,205
- Where've you been?
- On the other side of the City.

132
00:08:30,325 --> 00:08:32,831
Transporter malfunctioned
and sent me to the east pier.

133
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:34,420
I had to walk all the way back.

134
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,560
We've got power disruptions
all over the City.

135
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,499
Nearly every system is affected.

136
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,065
We think whatever was wrong
with the Jumper has infected Atlantis.

137
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:43,317
It's one of several possibilities
we're looking into.

138
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:45,819
- Several?
- It's a possibility.

139
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:48,489
All right? The point is,
we have no idea what's going on here.

140
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,367
- I was hit by a bolt of lightning.
- Yeah. Join the club.

141
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:53,649
The energy builds up in one area
and then discharges,

142
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:56,054
in a high-voltage displacement current.

143
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:57,748
Very erratic, very lethal.

144
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:00,959
- I tried to radio you.
- Yeah, communications are also down.

145
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,211
So is the Stargate.

146
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:06,532
- We can't dial Earth?
- Don't worry. All right?

147
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:10,343
I will figure it out. I just got to run
a few diagnostics, narrow down...

148
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:18,130
Well, that can't be good.

149
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:25,192
Okay. Okay. We...

150
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:28,633
We need to organize some teams,
fan out through the City,

151
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:31,657
keep everyone calm
until we figure out exactly what the...

152
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:39,301
- The laptop just booted up.
- It's probably just the battery.

153
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:41,082
No, it's drawing power
from the system.

154
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:44,286
So everything's out
except your computer?

155
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:46,672
I am as confused as you are.

156
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,889
- What is that?
- Looks like some kind of a code.

157
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:57,331
Maybe.

158
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:59,314
Could be a message.

159
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,693
"Help?"

160
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:29,321
Dr. Weir?

161
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:32,490
But she's dead.

162
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,840
So we've been told.

163
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,974
Perhaps...

164
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:42,334
you should answer her.

165
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:45,428
Right.

166
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:57,076
In the computer?
How can she be in the computer?

167
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:50,354
All right. Rodney?

168
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:52,871
Rodney, come in.

169
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,213
Rodney? Can you hear me?

170
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,711
- <i>Go ahead.</i>
- I've completed the patch.

171
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:00,598
Go ahead and try it.
Whenever you're ready.

172
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,541
Okay... Fingers crossed.

173
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:05,645
- What are you doing?
- Well, whatever this entity is,

174
00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:08,023
it's completely overwhelming
the City's systems.

175
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:09,663
It's spread out,

176
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:12,990
like dozens of fragmented programs

177
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:16,095
that are fouling up power management,
communications, you name it.

178
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:17,903
Now, I've managed to merge them,

179
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:21,187
to patch them together
into one incredibly large program

180
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,715
that will a) hopefully render
our systems slightly more stable,

181
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:27,029
and b) allow us to better
communicate with whoever

182
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:29,960
or whatever it is
that's claiming to be Dr. Weir.

183
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:33,339
Isn't merging all these programs
potentially dangerous?

184
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,172
Yeah! But it's no more dangerous

185
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,538
than allowing it to continue
wreaking havoc on the systems.

186
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:39,493
Or getting zapped
by bolts of lightning.

187
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:44,809
Okay, so, let's see if I can synthesize
a voice to communicate with Elizabeth.

188
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:48,812
If I make the proper calibrations,
she should be able to hear us too.

189
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:51,607
Now...

190
00:12:57,153 --> 00:13:00,241
Is it just me, or does "Elizabeth"
sound a little different?

191
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,130
I'm on it, I'm on it.

192
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,751
Let's see if we can do that.

193
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:11,303
Are you Elizabeth Weir?

194
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,628
Yes, Rodney.

195
00:13:12,788 --> 00:13:14,421
- It's me.
- It's the best I can do.

196
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:17,732
I'm sorry to cause all this trouble.

197
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:20,534
Who's there with you?
Is John Sheppard there?

198
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:25,599
- Hi.
- It's so good to hear your voice again.

199
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:27,438
We...

200
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,351
thought you were...

201
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,772
dead.

202
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:33,831
I suppose I am. My...

203
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:35,704
my physical body, anyway,

204
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:38,185
but my consciousness is still intact.

205
00:13:38,305 --> 00:13:40,739
Right. So, what happened?

206
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:43,784
Do you remember the day
I ordered you to leave me behind?

207
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:46,537
Go!

208
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,530
Yeah... Yeah, I remember.

209
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,963
Well, after that,
the Replicators took me to a lab.

210
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:59,968
The nanites in my body were unleashed
and allowed to replicate.

211
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:03,070
I joined the population,
but even in my new form,

212
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,818
my original consciousness
was still there.

213
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:07,277
I was still me.

214
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:11,187
I tried to hide it,
but a few of the others could sense it.

215
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,648
They were remnants of Niam's old group.

216
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:18,119
I believe you encountered
some of their handiwork.

217
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:21,405
Replicator-built human versions
of me and your team.

218
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:25,180
You heard about that, did you?

219
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,189
Only after they were killed.

220
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:32,158
Now, the other you, the human... one,

221
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:34,448
she thought you'd been destroyed.

222
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:36,795
That's what the leaders of our group
wanted her to believe.

223
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:40,466
They kept us apart deliberately,
for security reasons.

224
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,367
This is all very interesting, I'm sure.

225
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:45,927
But none of it explains
how you've come to be

226
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:48,932
a disembodied voice
in our computer system.

227
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:51,518
Is that... Richard Woolsey?

228
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:53,672
Yes.

229
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:56,589
It is. I'm the...

230
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,276
- the new...
- The new you.

231
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,672
I see.

232
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:05,529
So what happened?
How did you...

233
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:08,161
end up...

234
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:09,971
in there?

235
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:12,674
We were on the run.

236
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,744
Oberoth and the others were hunting us
for our heretical beliefs.

237
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:20,967
It was only a matter of time
before we'd be captured and destroyed,

238
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:23,601
unless something
miraculous happened.

239
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:25,342
And something did.

240
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,106
Our intel was correct...
The planet has been destroyed.

241
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:35,646
Can you detect
any trace of Replicator cells?

242
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:38,853
Negative.
They've been completely wiped out.

243
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:40,736
Good...

244
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:45,560
We can finally get to work without
having to look over our shoulders.

245
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,790
It's time to begin...

246
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:54,533
That wasn't a miracle,
that was us.

247
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,633
We destroyed the Replicator homeworld.

248
00:15:57,341 --> 00:15:58,502
I know.

249
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:00,765
And we owe you a debt of gratitude,

250
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:03,215
because it allowed us
to pursue our goal in peace.

251
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:06,719
- You mean ascension?
- Exactly, Teyla.

252
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:10,684
We found a suitable planet
and began our work.

253
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,238
I did what I could to help them.

254
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:15,852
I tried to lead them in meditation,
to teach them how to

255
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:17,695
"release their burden,"

256
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,835
but it was difficult.

257
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:24,820
You ran into a small hiccup
with the fact that you're all machines?

258
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:26,345
Yes.

259
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:29,736
Well, as much as I'd like to say,
we didn't see that coming...

260
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,899
we, you know, did.

261
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:34,304
One of our group, Koracen,

262
00:16:34,424 --> 00:16:36,465
argued that it was a mistake
to try and run away

263
00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:38,383
from our technological origin,

264
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:41,628
that we should embrace it
and find a technological solution.

265
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:44,721
We know that a Replicator mind
can be digitized

266
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:47,461
and transferred
from one body to another.

267
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:51,864
But I've discovered a way
that will allow us to exist indefinitely

268
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:54,210
as fields of energy...

269
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:57,173
Effectively uploading ourselves
into subspace,

270
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:59,813
where we'll be free to move
about the galaxy

271
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:01,922
unencumbered by physical existence.

272
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,710
What would happen
to our bodies?

273
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:06,722
The nanite bonds holding them together
will be severed.

274
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:08,811
- You mean they'll be destroyed?
- Yes,

275
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:10,452
but we'll no longer need them.

276
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,621
- Koracen, if this doesn't work...
- It will work.

277
00:17:14,978 --> 00:17:16,862
You told us that ascension is achieved

278
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:20,299
when the physical body
is transformed into pure energy.

279
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:22,973
I can make that happen for us.

280
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:26,117
Once in subspace,
nothing can prevent us

281
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:29,323
from continuing on
to the next plane of existence.

282
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:31,901
Are you ready?

283
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:46,749
It's done.

284
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:51,481
Machine ascension?

285
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,142
Except it didn't work.

286
00:17:54,526 --> 00:17:56,245
There was no next step,

287
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,623
no "ascension"
in any meaningful sense of the word.

288
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:02,251
We've been stuck in subspace
ever since.

289
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:04,409
What is it like?

290
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:08,729
Constant motion.
And deafening noise.

291
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:12,102
It's like the worst migraine
you could possibly imagine.

292
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:14,572
I don't know,
I've had some pretty horrendous ones.

293
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,139
We started searching the galaxy,

294
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:19,685
looking for a way to regain
any kind of physical form.

295
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,771
We came across a few other
technologically advanced societies...

296
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:25,078
Really? In this galaxy?

297
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,865
You'd be surprised
how many more are out there,

298
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:30,333
keeping themselves hidden
from the Wraith.

299
00:18:30,453 --> 00:18:33,907
We occupied various computer systems,
even Wraith tech for a short while.

300
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:36,504
Wraith tech? Really?

301
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:38,787
It was extremely unpleasant.

302
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:40,988
In fact, no matter where we looked,

303
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:43,873
we couldn't find any technology
that would allow us to exist

304
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:47,432
as anything even remotely like
what we were before.

305
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:49,979
Which is why you came here.

306
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:52,183
You knew that Atlantis's computers
were big enough

307
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:54,450
and powerful enough
to house your entire program.

308
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,180
The others were growing
increasingly frustrated, and bitter.

309
00:18:57,622 --> 00:19:00,225
I broke away from them
and started looking for you on my own.

310
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:02,765
I searched the galaxy for months,

311
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,758
and then I detected your Puddle Jumper
and connected with it.

312
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,073
Nearly killing us in the process.

313
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:09,610
I'm sorry for that.

314
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:11,820
My current condition

315
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,281
is extremely volatile,
difficult to control.

316
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:18,512
Especially during the initial moments,
trying to interface with new tech.

317
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:20,988
But I didn't know where else to turn.

318
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,915
You're the only friends I have.

319
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:33,296
If you ask me, it's a trick.
Someone just pretending to be Dr. Weir.

320
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,032
But what if it is her?

321
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:37,306
We still have the machine
I used to build Fran.

322
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,683
- I could build another Replicator to...
- No.

323
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,714
I'd put in failsafes, a kill switch.

324
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:44,387
What I'm saying is that
with all the advancements I made...

325
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:47,846
With all due respect to them,
one thing remains constant...

326
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:50,692
Replicators are far too powerful
to even think about trusting them.

327
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,113
They were the scourge of two galaxies.
It was difficult to get rid of them.

328
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:57,608
- What should we do with her?
- She can't stay there.

329
00:19:57,728 --> 00:19:59,118
She's frying the computers.

330
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:02,838
Maybe we can upload her... or it...

331
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:06,792
or whatever this thing is,
into a virtual reality, like with Ava?

332
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,408
Could work, but it wouldn't be easy,
especially if she doesn't wanna go.

333
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:12,411
We'll... talk to her.

334
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:16,638
Rodney, we just detected anomalous
energy levels in the south pier lab.

335
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,471
- The Replicator machine.
- She's building herself a body.

336
00:20:19,904 --> 00:20:22,107
- She must've found it in the database.
- Shut down power.

337
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:25,310
I've also tried to radio down there,
but communications are still offline.

338
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:30,869
What's going on?

339
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:32,275
Door slammed shut.

340
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:34,097
- Can't get it open.
- Okay, move!

341
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:37,011
Go get some back-up, some heavy arms,
and cover every corridor outta here.

342
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:38,961
Get some C-4.
We'll have to blast this door.

343
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:40,741
No, this panel is toast.

344
00:20:42,414 --> 00:20:44,454
Is there another door we can access?

345
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,012
Hello.

346
00:20:57,031 --> 00:20:59,623
Listen to me... I'm Elizabeth Weir.

347
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:02,305
She was in a hurry,
she used the previous Replicator

348
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:05,089
that was already in the machine,
which was Fran.

349
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:07,345
John, I'm not a threat to you.

350
00:21:07,815 --> 00:21:11,690
I'd say building a Replicator body
is a pretty big threat.

351
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,817
Elizabeth Weir
would never do such a thing.

352
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:16,313
Okay... The machine

353
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:17,735
is deactivated.

354
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:20,695
Removed the control crystal,
no one will build more Replicators.

355
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:24,535
Believe me, I was just as concerned
about doing this as you.

356
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,749
But the adjustments Rodney's made
to this technology eliminate any danger.

357
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,550
I can't replicate.

358
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,739
And since my consciousness
is controlling this body,

359
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,379
- I truly...
- Your consciousness?

360
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:38,092
No offense, but I'm not completely sold
on your being who you say you are.

361
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,344
That makes two of us.

362
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,275
I understand your skepticism,
but I am Elizabeth Weir.

363
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,004
I wish I could prove it to you.

364
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:49,311
That'll be difficult.

365
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:52,981
Any personal information or memories
could have easily been mined

366
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:55,565
from Dr. Weir's consciousness
when the Replicators captured her.

367
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:56,811
I know.

368
00:21:57,278 --> 00:21:59,530
At least let me start
by offering something of value.

369
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:01,036
Let's hear it.

370
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:05,119
The technical specs of the systems
we've inhabited...

371
00:22:06,184 --> 00:22:07,830
Including Wraith tech...

372
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:12,061
I've already uploaded them
to your computer.

373
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,845
Really?
Well, that's... great.

374
00:22:15,078 --> 00:22:17,587
All I ask is that you give me a chance
to earn your trust.

375
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:22,924
I would never, ever,
do anything to harm any of you,

376
00:22:23,044 --> 00:22:24,113
or Atlantis.

377
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,877
The good news is that
now she's into the Replicator's body,

378
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:40,386
she's not screwing up
Atlantis' computers.

379
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:43,875
The power's stable, the Gate's working,
and communications are back online.

380
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,712
You're sure she can't replicate?

381
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:48,006
Positive.
I mean, she instituted every safeguard.

382
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:49,956
If we move her to a secure location,

383
00:22:50,076 --> 00:22:51,809
- then I think...
- Wait a minute!

384
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:54,751
You're not suggesting I entertain
the notion of keeping her here?

385
00:22:55,358 --> 00:22:58,521
If we keep her under constant guard,
it'll minimize any threat she poses,

386
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:00,316
if she even poses a threat.

387
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:03,049
And it'll give us
more time to study her.

388
00:23:04,753 --> 00:23:07,623
That thing in there is a Replicator.

389
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:09,773
There are far too many ways
this can go wrong,

390
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:11,696
even if she's kept under constant guard.

391
00:23:11,816 --> 00:23:15,138
Everyone doubted the first Fran I built,
and she turned out to be perfectly safe

392
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:17,724
- and perfectly reliable.
- That's right, you built Fran.

393
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:19,567
You created her consciousness.

394
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:22,850
Now, as much as you wanna believe
that this new Fran is indeed Dr. Weir,

395
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,965
we cannot be certain of that.

396
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:27,201
For all we know,
it could be Oberoth inside that body.

397
00:23:27,563 --> 00:23:28,803
That's creepy.

398
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:31,391
What if it is Dr. Weir?

399
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:35,250
Look, this is my fault. I'm the one who
reactivated the nanites in Elizabeth.

400
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:37,603
True, to save her, but...

401
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,574
I'm the one who created this mess.

402
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,009
I think I should be the one to,
you know, fix it.

403
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:48,305
I owe it to Elizabeth.

404
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:52,440
I'm sorry...

405
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,971
But it's too dangerous.

406
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,718
I say we stick with our original plan...

407
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:01,226
Upload her consciousnes
into a virtual reality.

408
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:03,111
Let her prove herself there,

409
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,764
where she can't do any damage.

410
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:16,565
A child?

411
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:23,237
I'm so happy for you.

412
00:24:26,913 --> 00:24:28,178
Is it a boy, or...

413
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:29,879
Boy.

414
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:31,848
What's his name?

415
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:36,019
Torren John Emmagan.

416
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:38,886
Torren, for your father.

417
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,317
And John... Colonel Sheppard?

418
00:24:42,753 --> 00:24:43,753
Yes.

419
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:48,130
Wait, you're not saying
John Sheppard is...

420
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,316
No...

421
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:53,118
The father is Athosian.

422
00:24:53,572 --> 00:24:55,247
Let me guess: Kanaan?

423
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:57,624
Yes. How did you...

424
00:24:59,057 --> 00:25:01,786
Every time you spoke of him,
this "friend",

425
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,844
there was always a sparkle
in your eyes.

426
00:25:07,326 --> 00:25:10,024
So, is the baby here
with you in Atlantis?

427
00:25:12,003 --> 00:25:12,963
No.

428
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,199
He is with his father.

429
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,518
Off-world.

430
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:23,632
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, it's all right.

431
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,669
We were just finishing.

432
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:37,713
- Sorry about all this.
- It's okay, I understand.

433
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:40,250
Amazing news about Teyla.

434
00:25:48,195 --> 00:25:52,138
We all wanna believe
you are who you say you are.

435
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:53,917
I understand you...

436
00:25:54,037 --> 00:25:55,765
You have to be cautious,

437
00:25:56,505 --> 00:25:58,274
but it really is me, John.

438
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:03,760
You just have to give me time.

439
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,828
You'll see that...

440
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:11,973
Oh no.

441
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:14,581
- What's wrong?
- They've found me.

442
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:17,383
Who?

443
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,539
The other Replicators.

444
00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:22,358
They're on their way to Atlantis.

445
00:26:24,622 --> 00:26:26,267
- How many are coming?
- Eight of them.

446
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:29,132
- We saw what damage one could do...
- Should we pull the ZPM?

447
00:26:29,532 --> 00:26:33,470
As a last resort. I'll need to effect
any counter-measures I can come up with.

448
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:36,449
- How soon will they get here?
- Well, minutes, if that.

449
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:39,450
Can we do anything to protect the City?
Can you put up some kind of firewall?

450
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,687
A firewall won't work.
They just pop in and out of subspace.

451
00:26:42,847 --> 00:26:45,872
They're here, they're there,
it's impossible to predict.

452
00:26:46,296 --> 00:26:49,162
I could write a program that quarantines
any anomalous behavior in the system,

453
00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:52,290
like an anti-virus software.
It's gonna take some time, though.

454
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,466
Do what you can.

455
00:26:53,586 --> 00:26:56,730
Keep Fran, Dr. Weir, whoever she is,
under guard.

456
00:26:56,963 --> 00:26:59,144
We won't upload her to the VR just yet.

457
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:01,623
We may need her help
dealing with them.

458
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:06,628
- You set us up.
- No!

459
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:09,714
I honestly believed I had broken away
without them being able to track me.

460
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:12,175
Tell them to stay away from Atlantis.

461
00:27:12,402 --> 00:27:15,351
I'll try, but it'll get easier
as they get closer.

462
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:17,305
They don't intend to hurt anyone.

463
00:27:17,614 --> 00:27:20,356
You tell them to keep moving,
go someplace else.

464
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:21,518
It might go a...

465
00:27:23,888 --> 00:27:26,106
- <i>Sheppard! </i>
- Go ahead, Rodney.

466
00:27:26,734 --> 00:27:30,248
<i>...it arrived...
Wasn't able... Program the system...</i>

467
00:27:31,062 --> 00:27:34,413
Their combined forces are completely
overwhelming the main power grid!

468
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:38,827
- They're here?
- All  8 of 'em, slamming the computers!

469
00:27:38,947 --> 00:27:42,247
- What about the anti-virus program?
- Didn't have time to finish it.

470
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:44,105
Radek, I need you to pull the ZPM,

471
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:47,122
power down
all essential naquadah generators.

472
00:27:48,673 --> 00:27:49,921
Communications are down!

473
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:55,625
Rodney, I'm trying to divert power,
but it's become far too unstable.

474
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:58,025
Perhaps now we should pull the ZPM?

475
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:03,307
Let's go. Pull the ZPM.

476
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:05,395
Shut down all the power
except for the main power.

477
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:15,952
Oh, God.

478
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:17,174
He's dead.

479
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,285
We've established contact
with the Replicator known as Koracen.

480
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:25,198
He claims to speak
on the others' behalf.

481
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:27,166
Koracen?
It's Elizabeth Weir.

482
00:28:28,552 --> 00:28:30,702
- We were worried about you.
- Listen to me.

483
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:32,567
You need to leave this place.

484
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:34,341
You're causing a lot of harm.

485
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:35,619
We will leave.

486
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:38,065
But first we wish to be given bodies,
as you have.

487
00:28:38,185 --> 00:28:40,568
We've already told you
that's out of the question.

488
00:28:40,688 --> 00:28:42,415
And yet
Elizabeth has been given one.

489
00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:45,950
It wasn't our choice, and we're not
planning on letting her keep it.

490
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,072
We do not wish to harm anyone.

491
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:50,405
One of our guys is already dead,

492
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:52,618
so you can save your:
"We come in peace" crap!

493
00:28:52,738 --> 00:28:54,157
Koracen, please.

494
00:28:54,277 --> 00:28:56,530
Just leave the City
and let me negotiate with them.

495
00:28:57,267 --> 00:28:59,950
I'm sure we can figure out
some way to help you.

496
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,429
The way to help us is by replacing
the control crystal

497
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:05,739
in the Ancient machine
so that we may build Replicator bodies.

498
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:07,735
That is what you will do.

499
00:29:07,951 --> 00:29:09,252
And if we don't?

500
00:29:13,873 --> 00:29:15,795
Not good. Not good!

501
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:18,657
- Gate's down again!
- We're losing control of the City.

502
00:29:18,777 --> 00:29:20,220
They shut the Jumper bay doors!

503
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:22,556
They're trying to keep us
from leaving.

504
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:26,530
- Can't you override it?
- I'm locked out!

505
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,352
Oh, no.

506
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:29,403
They just engaged the ZPM.

507
00:29:29,878 --> 00:29:32,691
- Energy levels are rising rapidly!
- Why, what are they doing?

508
00:29:33,593 --> 00:29:35,002
They're sinking the City.

509
00:29:35,122 --> 00:29:37,487
- Raise the shield.
- They've disabled it.

510
00:29:47,825 --> 00:29:50,125
- Any ideas?
- No, we're going down.

511
00:29:50,564 --> 00:29:53,515
Water's already cresting the lower decks
of the outer piers.

512
00:29:53,635 --> 00:29:55,462
It's going to breach
the City corridors.

513
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:18,138
I want you to send them
a message for me.

514
00:30:18,258 --> 00:30:21,030
I've been trying to communicate
with them, telling them to stop.

515
00:30:21,377 --> 00:30:23,741
- They won't listen to me.
- That's not what I want to tell.

516
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,451
It's not?

517
00:30:25,964 --> 00:30:27,966
Tell them... to go ahead.

518
00:30:28,604 --> 00:30:29,705
Sink the City.

519
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:32,766
Destroy their only chance
of ever regaining

520
00:30:32,886 --> 00:30:34,752
any kind of physical form.

521
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,264
You've searched the entire galaxy.

522
00:30:37,384 --> 00:30:39,549
You know the Replicator homeworld
was destroyed.

523
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:43,470
The only place with the technology
you need to achieve your goals

524
00:30:44,555 --> 00:30:45,763
is right here.

525
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:48,402
So go ahead, destroy it.

526
00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:51,490
Stay trapped in limbo forever.

527
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:57,764
Level one of the south pier
is completely under water.

528
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,542
They won't stop.

529
00:31:01,623 --> 00:31:02,524
Fine.

530
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:05,253
Then we'll all die together.

531
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:25,598
They're powering down the ZPM!

532
00:31:27,673 --> 00:31:29,014
The City's stabilizing.

533
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:37,940
All right.

534
00:31:38,604 --> 00:31:40,208
Now we can negotiate.

535
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:48,951
I have a proposal. I've already
communicated it to the others,

536
00:31:49,111 --> 00:31:51,298
and convinced them to agree to it.

537
00:31:51,418 --> 00:31:52,468
Let's hear it.

538
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:53,831
Human bodies,

539
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:57,370
nanite-manufactured,
but consisting of flesh and blood.

540
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,773
Like the other Elizabeth Weir
you once encountered.

541
00:31:59,893 --> 00:32:01,672
We don't have
that kind of technology here.

542
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:03,289
But we do.

543
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:05,384
If you give us
temporary Replicator bodies,

544
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:08,220
and a lab to work in,
we can assemble them ourselves.

545
00:32:08,438 --> 00:32:10,664
You'll transfer your consciousness
from the Replicator body

546
00:32:10,784 --> 00:32:12,355
- to the human body?
- Exactly.

547
00:32:12,571 --> 00:32:15,863
As human beings, we would be every bit
as vulnerable as anyone else.

548
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:18,856
We would eat, sleep,
get sick... and die.

549
00:32:19,478 --> 00:32:20,954
Preferably of old age.

550
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:24,612
What about ascension?
I'm assuming that's still on the agenda?

551
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:26,697
- It is.
- Wait a second.

552
00:32:26,935 --> 00:32:29,549
Building humans...
That's going to take time, isn't it?

553
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:31,752
First, you've got to create
the technology to do it...

554
00:32:31,872 --> 00:32:33,037
We're talking nanites.

555
00:32:33,197 --> 00:32:36,499
Organically assembling each body,
inside out, at the molecular level.

556
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:39,001
Then you have to create the machine.


557
00:32:39,161 --> 00:32:40,735
That's going to take how long?

558
00:32:40,855 --> 00:32:43,297
Replicators, as you know,
work very fast.

559
00:32:43,603 --> 00:32:45,573
No need for breaks,
or food, or sleep.

560
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:47,092
It's worth thinking about.

561
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,724
He may be right.

562
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,737
If only to regain control
of the City.

563
00:32:50,857 --> 00:32:53,224
While they're in our computer systems,
Atlantis is in trouble.

564
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:55,617
If we do this,

565
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,798
I want severe restrictions
placed on their capabilities...

566
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:00,397
No replicating, no shape-shifting.

567
00:33:00,557 --> 00:33:02,897
The basic model, you got it.
I mean, no bells, no whistles.

568
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:05,624
They'll be able to affect some
minor repairs, but that's about it.

569
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:08,180
Seal off the lab,
put a force field around it,

570
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,805
do whatever you need to do
to feel safe.

571
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:13,577
But I've already convinced the others
that this is their only option.

572
00:33:14,594 --> 00:33:16,121
They won't give you any trouble.

573
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,472
You have my word.

574
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:23,910
Do it.

575
00:33:29,762 --> 00:33:31,771
Okay, initializing force field.

576
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:39,812
Are your teams in place?

577
00:33:39,972 --> 00:33:42,136
- Around-the-clock watch.
- Good.

578
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:44,603
Once these human bodies are made,

579
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:47,831
and they're downloaded into them...
What happens then?

580
00:33:47,951 --> 00:33:50,001
They'll be just like
any other human beings,

581
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:51,731
I see no reason not to let them go.

582
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:55,494
- They could become valuable allies.
- What if one of 'em decides to stay?

583
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:59,848
Let's cross one bridge at a time,
all right?

584
00:34:03,402 --> 00:34:04,333
How's it going?

585
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:07,256
Almost done.
Just finishing up the last one.

586
00:34:17,217 --> 00:34:18,195
That was fast.

587
00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:20,680
Actually, creating Replicators
is fairly simple,

588
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,720
comparatively speaking.
Humans, not so much.

589
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,109
The sooner they get it done, the better.
And once the last transfer is complete,

590
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:29,872
I want those Replicator bodies
destroyed.

591
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,965
They certainly don't waste any time,
do they?

592
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:35,285
No they don't.

593
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:38,746
There's no breaks, no chit-chat,
no social interaction whatsoever.

594
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,517
The perfect working environment.

595
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:47,354
You don't have to stay there
the whole time, you know.

596
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:48,339
I'm good.

597
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:51,800
Talk, talk, that's all he does.
You can't shut him up.

598
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,692
Keep me apprised.

599
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:21,011
- Power's out!
- What the... Force field!

600
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:48,194
- What happened?
- One of the Replicators escaped.

601
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:50,654
Koracen, the leader,
must've written hidden program

602
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:54,019
that was timed to kill power,
as soon as they were downloaded.

603
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:57,245
Disable the force field they were able
to pry open the doors.

604
00:35:57,365 --> 00:35:58,239
Where is she?

605
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:00,116
She went after Koracen.

606
00:36:00,276 --> 00:36:02,589
Three teams are in pursuit.
We've lost all radio contact.

607
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:05,806
Go join them. Go up to the control room,
and try to get the power restored.

608
00:36:05,926 --> 00:36:07,957
- What do we do with them?
- Shoot 'em.

609
00:36:08,077 --> 00:36:09,282
Keep shooting.

610
00:36:09,826 --> 00:36:11,274
They'll go down eventually.

611
00:36:11,394 --> 00:36:12,128
Wait!

612
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:16,313
We knew nothing of Koracen's plan.

613
00:36:17,076 --> 00:36:19,510
If we were a part of it,
we would not be standing here right now.

614
00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:22,096
Please?

615
00:36:22,256 --> 00:36:24,181
We're complying with your wishes.

616
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:30,840
Nothing gets through that door.

617
00:36:31,136 --> 00:36:32,636
They move an inch...

618
00:36:33,142 --> 00:36:34,241
Shoot 'em.

619
00:36:54,499 --> 00:36:55,500
Hold on!

620
00:36:57,931 --> 00:37:00,092
You just couldn't wait
for those human bodies, could you?

621
00:37:01,757 --> 00:37:04,160
The human body is frail, weak...

622
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:07,184
Every second,
that much closer to dying.

623
00:37:07,304 --> 00:37:10,269
Yeah, and this whole ascension thing...
You're just giving up on that?

624
00:37:11,389 --> 00:37:14,192
Not at all.
I'm certain there's another way.

625
00:37:14,661 --> 00:37:15,959
With this body,

626
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,403
I'll have plenty of time
to discover it.

627
00:37:31,491 --> 00:37:33,855
- Any luck?
- They've shut about everything down.

628
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:35,770
Power's cut
to most of the critical systems.

629
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,335
Except for the DHD and the Gate.

630
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,215
They're obviously
going to try to dial out.

631
00:37:39,335 --> 00:37:41,529
Now, I've managed to gain remote access
to the mainframe.

632
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:44,679
I'm creating a workaround to allow
the resumption of naquadah power

633
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,455
to the central tower's
primary systems.

634
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:50,153
- Minimal, to be sure, but from there...
- Over-write the Replicator program

635
00:37:50,273 --> 00:37:51,747
and restart the remaining systems.

636
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:54,769
- Exactly.
- Just hurry. We need power back now.

637
00:37:55,082 --> 00:37:58,220
- Is there anything you want me to do?
- Yes, for starters, you could,

638
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,803
stay out of my way.

639
00:37:59,923 --> 00:38:01,424
Yes. Okay. Fine.

640
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:08,904
And be quiet.

641
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:10,718
Stop!

642
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:13,931
John, stay back.
Let me handle this.

643
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:17,962
- Haven't you done enough already?
- I'm trying to help you.

644
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,422
By what? Escaping?

645
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:22,591
I didn't know
that Koracen would do this.

646
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:23,980
Of course she knew!

647
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:26,699
Elizabeth
has been a willing participant

648
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,889
in our goals
from the very beginning.

649
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:32,054
It was her idea to come here
in the first place.

650
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:36,895
You said you broke off from them,
that they couldn't track you.

651
00:38:37,262 --> 00:38:38,190
Track her?

652
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:40,315
She was the one who alerted us

653
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:41,902
when the time was right to come.

654
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:44,446
We were only
following her commands.

655
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:45,781
John, listen to me.

656
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:48,013
I had to bring them here.

657
00:38:48,603 --> 00:38:49,869
It was our only chance...

658
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:52,192
Our only way out.

659
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,375
I didn't know that Koracen
would cause this kind of trouble.

660
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:58,252
I didn't want hurt you.

661
00:38:58,548 --> 00:39:00,461
What did you think
we were going to do?

662
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:02,923
Give you a bunch of Replicator bodies
and send you on your way?

663
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:05,843
I truly believed
that we were no threat to you.

664
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:09,889
You may still think you're Elizabeth,
but you're not.

665
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:39,558
If you'd like to resume your work,
I've decided to allow it.

666
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:42,755
We would re-engage the force field,
of course. Beef up security.

667
00:39:44,347 --> 00:39:45,341
It's too risky.

668
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:50,925
I thought that bringing the others here
would be safe.

669
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:52,146
I was wrong.

670
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:56,277
I can no longer guarantee there won't be
any more trouble from them.

671
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:57,394
Or even myself.

672
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,408
All right...

673
00:40:02,398 --> 00:40:04,100
What do you want to do?

674
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,487
I remember, after you reactivated
the nanite cells inside me,

675
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,443
I said this was a bad idea.

676
00:40:11,563 --> 00:40:13,577
So much has gone wrong since then.

677
00:40:16,434 --> 00:40:19,737
But I think I know
how I can finally set things right.

678
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,340
Go ahead.

679
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:48,685
If you need anything else for your work,
let us know.

680
00:40:48,805 --> 00:40:50,106
Thanks, Rodney.

681
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:51,948
You have to promise to stay put

682
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:54,631
until you're finished
constructing the human bodies.

683
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:56,291
No leaving your homeworld,

684
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:59,982
no communication with any other
civilization except Atlantis.

685
00:41:00,102 --> 00:41:03,002
You have my word.
Good luck with your command, Richard.

686
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:06,338
It's comforting to know Atlantis
is in capable hands.

687
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:08,722
Thank you.

688
00:41:09,363 --> 00:41:10,508
Shall we?

689
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:14,913
It's okay.

690
00:41:15,554 --> 00:41:16,755
I'll go first.

691
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:47,973
It's safe.

692
00:42:16,553 --> 00:42:19,255
You're sure the DHD reconfiguration
worked?

693
00:42:20,044 --> 00:42:20,844
Yes.

694
00:42:21,576 --> 00:42:23,679
They were sent to a space Gate.

695
00:42:24,941 --> 00:42:29,145
I guess that answers the question
as to whether it was really Elizabeth?
