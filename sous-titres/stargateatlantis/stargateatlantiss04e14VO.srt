1
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:07,365
<i>And to another fine year of trading.</i>

2
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:08,492
<i>Hear, hear!</i>

3
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:10,532
Truly, the medical supplies
you have given to us

4
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:14,080
over the past several years have made an
immeasurable difference to our people.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,937
Not to mention your warning last harvest
that the Wraith were nearby.

6
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:19,365
You saved many lives.

7
00:00:19,743 --> 00:00:21,285
Well, you know.

8
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:23,472
My favorite missions are
to do our trading.

9
00:00:23,592 --> 00:00:25,853
<i>And I've said that, I can prove it.
I'm not just saying...</i>

10
00:00:26,022 --> 00:00:27,751
You don't need to prove it.

11
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,074
You know, actually,

12
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:30,950
we got to get going.
So soon?

13
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:32,838
- Yeah, so soon?
- We were hoping that

14
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,405
you could stay...

15
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:37,329
Well, I...

16
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:39,619
I guess we could stay a little longer.

17
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:41,158
I hate to...

18
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:43,660
no, never mind.

19
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:46,511
- What is it?
- Well, I wouldn't dream of imposing...

20
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,802
you've been so generous
to our people already...

21
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:51,094
- What's the problem?
- Our sister.

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,931
She is in great need of your help.

23
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:55,558
- I didn't even know you had a sister.
- We do indeed.

24
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:58,037
And I imagine
she's as beautiful as you two.

25
00:00:58,222 --> 00:00:59,248
Even more so.

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,917
- And she's in great need of guidance.
- Guidance. That I can do.

27
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,152
You are most generous.

28
00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:08,100
Excuse us for one moment.

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,374
I'll get her.

30
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:14,994
- Dibs.
- What?

31
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:17,664
- I'm calling dibs on the third sister.
- You can't call dibs.

32
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:20,413
Look, we both know that Flora
and Mardola have been suckered in

33
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:22,898
by the whole cliche-heroic thing
you've got going,

34
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:26,226
but maybe this other sister, maybe
her taste in men will run more to the...

35
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:27,169
Geeky?

36
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:30,385
I was going to say "cerebral,"
but who knows. Maybe we'll hit it off.

37
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:32,929
I don't need your love life
screwing up our trade relations.

38
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:35,181
I'll try not to break her heart,
but no promises.

39
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,973
These are the men
I was telling you about.

40
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:43,093
Gentlemen,

41
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:44,725
this is our sister...

42
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:45,845
Harmony.

43
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,542
Super.

00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,061
<i>As you know, our mother and</i>

53
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:06,924
queen passed at the beginning
of this lunar cycle.

54
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:09,108
A secret, sacred ceremony was held

55
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:12,285
to determine which of her three
daughters would succeed her.

56
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:15,615
It was determined that Harmony
shall be the new queen.

57
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:16,545
Really?

58
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:17,770
Well, congrats.

59
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,159
<i>Before she is crowned,</i>

60
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:22,580
all future queens must perform
a time-honored rite of passage.

61
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:24,915
A rite of passage
normally performed alone.

62
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:27,332
It is not written one way or another.

63
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:30,552
And Harmony is so young.

64
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:32,799
- It concerns me greatly.
- I can do it.

65
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,800
You are very brave...

66
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,426
but the trail is difficult.

67
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:38,186
It would bring me great comfort to know

68
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:40,750
that you had someone
looking out for you.

69
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:44,798
What kind of rite of passage
are we talking about here?

70
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:48,555
Deep in the forest lies the ruins
of the great temple of Laros.

71
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:53,695
Every queen must take a pilgrimage
before the end of the first lunar cycle

72
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:55,321
<i>of their selection.</i>

73
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:59,301
Once there, she must meditate
on the journey that lies ahead of her

74
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:01,732
and pray to be endowed
with the knowledge and power

75
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:03,121
to govern her people.

76
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:05,331
How deep in the forest?

77
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:07,115
No more than a day's trek.

78
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:07,990
I see.

79
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,987
Yes. No.

80
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:10,424
We are very honored,

81
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:13,545
but why don't you just have
a couple of your own guards escort her?

82
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,609
Although it is not written so,
our people will expect their new queen

83
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,928
to have completed the journey
on her own.

84
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:23,224
So you don't want her to be alone,
but you don't want anyone to know

85
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:25,365
<i>- she's getting help.</i>
- Precisely.

86
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:27,812
Right. We'd love to lend a hand, but...

87
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:32,521
Our peoples have enjoyed
such a fruitful alliance.

88
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:33,987
Yeah...

89
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:36,738
One that has greatly benefited
both parties.

90
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:38,323
Right...

91
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:40,782
I'd hate to think that one of us
would put that in jeopardy

92
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:43,284
over a simple day's walk in the forest.

93
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,042
When do we leave?

94
00:04:57,742 --> 00:05:00,812
<i>I must confess...
I'm quite looking forward to this.</i>

95
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:03,499
<i>I rarely get to leave
the confines of the castle,</i>

96
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:06,545
<i>although I've had much training
in forest survival.</i>

97
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:08,437
Oh, you have, have you?

98
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:09,557
Oh, yes.

99
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:12,688
I have completed three sessions
with Nolar Lumsbred.

100
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:15,687
He is one of the greatest hunters
amongst my people.

101
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:17,097
Three whole sessions?

102
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,997
With the Nolar Lumsbred?

103
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,415
They were all I needed.

104
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:23,007
I am a quick learner.

105
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:24,559
I'll bet you are.

106
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,243
Tell me,

107
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:29,005
which one of you
is the superior officer?

108
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,458
You mean who outranks who?

109
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:32,085
Yes.

110
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:34,947
I'm a civilian, I don't have a rank,
but basically, we're equals.

111
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,870
Technically, I'm in charge.

112
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:38,742
I thought so.

113
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:42,250
You have all the makings
of an excellent leader, John.

114
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,119
Well, thank you.

115
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:52,248
- You going to eat your powerbar?
- Yes, Rodney.

116
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,066
I told you, you shouldn't have
eaten yours so early in the day.

117
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:56,439
I'm starving.

118
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:59,317
Usually Flora feeds us some sort
of food when we visit.

119
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:01,613
- Come on, you hardly ever eat yours.
- No, Rodney.

120
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:04,816
Well, will you give it to me later
when you decide not to eat it?

121
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:07,703
You allow him
to question you so incessantly?

122
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,252
I guess I'm just used to it by now.

123
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:12,316
Would it not be easier to beat him?

124
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:15,003
We don't beat people where we come from.

125
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:16,123
Why not?

126
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,128
Well, we find it's not very effective
in the long run...

127
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:20,434
unfortunately.

128
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:22,556
Really?

129
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:26,205
<i>You are a truly gentle leader, John.</i>

130
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:27,748
I admire that.

131
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:29,389
Thank you, Harmony.

132
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:35,064
There's supposed to be
a rope bridge here.

133
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:38,956
- Maybe you're reading the map wrong.
- No, I think it's straight forward.

134
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:41,691
How old is this map?

135
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:45,158
It has been passed down from
too many generations to know for sure.

136
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:48,659
Okay, guess that bridge doesn't exist.

137
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:52,540
<i>You two stay put.</i>

138
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:55,543
I'm going to try to find
a safe way across the river.

139
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:57,679
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

140
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,041
Where'd you find that?

141
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:20,199
John's bag.

142
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:22,292
It's not yours.

143
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,568
- I'm hungry.
- You can't just take it like that.

144
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:27,122
- When I'm hungry, I eat.
- What's gonna happen

145
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:30,281
- when Sheppard finds out?
- Well, he's not going to know, is he?

146
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:31,913
He is, I'm gonna tell him.


147
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:34,925
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Yeah, or what?

148
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:38,485
- I'm the queen.
- Not yet, you're not, little sister.

149
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:42,057
Trust me, you don't
want to be on my bad side.

150
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,259
Right? And what are you going to do?
Have me beaten?

151
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,016
All right, princess, just hand it over.

152
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:55,100
See, now, you're in trouble. You just
wait till Sheppard gets back here...

153
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,257
- He's gonna...
- I think I found a place for us to...

154
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:00,691
Is that my powerbar?

155
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:02,697
- She stole it.
- I did not!

156
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:04,646
What? You so did! Tell him!

157
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:06,134
I would never do such a thing!

158
00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:08,603
The second you were gone,
she went into your bag.

159
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,128
You are a liar!

160
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:13,204
- You are a lying liar!
- Please, who are you going to believe?

161
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, if she stole it, Rodney,
how come you've got the wrapper?

162
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,169
Well, b... I was trying to take it
back from her,

163
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:23,840
and then she wolfs it down
and hands me the wrapper.

164
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:25,091
Really?

165
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:27,259
Okay, you better come clean, brat.

166
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:37,724
It's okay, sweetie.

167
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:40,164
Sometimes... he makes me cry, too.

168
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:49,580
All right, we need to get going here.
All right? I found a path.

169
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,912
Can I navigate from the map?

170
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,828
Sure,
as soon as we get back on the path.

171
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:14,882
Now...

172
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,496
we go...

173
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:17,434
Right.

174
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:18,926
Correct.

175
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,278
- What was that?
- That's probably the beast.

176
00:09:27,438 --> 00:09:28,613
Sorry, the what now?

177
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:29,947
The beast.

178
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:32,033
<i>The protector of the ruins of Laros.</i>

179
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:36,120
- Did Flora not tell you of it?
- I guess she forgot to mention it.

180
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:37,908
Don't worry.

181
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:41,742
When you say "beast," I'm assuming
that's a figure of speech, right?

182
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:44,003
No, it's a beast, all right...

183
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:46,881
though no one is quite certain
what it looks like.

184
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:50,092
Those who have cast their eyes upon it
have quickly perished.

185
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:52,595
But your little knife will protect us.

186
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,412
I'm the queen.

187
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:55,696
It will not harm me.

188
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:58,466
We may not get a chance
to tell the beast that.

189
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,217
It will know.

190
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:01,888
<i>Listen,</i>

191
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:04,921
why don't we say
we made it as far as the ruins?

192
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:08,237
We don't actually have to make it there.
They never have to know the difference.

193
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,546
I would know.

194
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,136
Yeah, but you're going to be queen,
so who cares, right?

195
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:13,209
I care.

196
00:10:13,603 --> 00:10:14,700
My people care.

197
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:16,693
Listen...

198
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,483
Perhaps it would be best if you stopped
speaking. Your voice hurts my ears.

199
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:23,444
Well, that beast could hurt
my whole body, okay?

200
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:28,214
So I'm sorry, but this is not what we
signed up for. Back me up here.

201
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,252
John?

202
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:37,124
According to legend,
the beast attacks silently.

203
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:40,273
I thought you said the beast
would know you were the queen.

204
00:10:40,393 --> 00:10:42,395
Well, it didn't attack me.

205
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:43,793
John?

206
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:45,565
Are you there?

207
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,850
It is strange, though...

208
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:51,821
the beast is supposed to only attack
enemies of the throne.

209
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:55,760
If it was going to kill anyone,
it should have killed you.

210
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,012
I'm not an enemy to the throne.
I'm not! I'm here to protect you.

211
00:10:59,132 --> 00:11:00,706
<i>Don't move!</i>

212
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:06,437
So far, I'm not impressed.

213
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:13,671
Drop your weapon.

214
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,017
We have her.

215
00:11:21,726 --> 00:11:23,728
Map grid 11 in the small clearing.

216
00:11:23,888 --> 00:11:24,938
<i>On our way.</i>

217
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:28,943
- Hand her over.
- You're Genii.

218
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,694
Step aside, and hand her over.

219
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:34,676
This is obviously some sort
of huge misunderstanding. All right?

220
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:38,159
I'm Dr. Rodney McKay. I'm a close
personal friend of Ladon Radim.

221
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,406
You know, your leader?

222
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:45,791
<i>I'm your greatest ally!
You don't know who I am?</i>

223
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:49,711
I'm the genius scientist. The friend of
John Sheppard?I gave you the bomb?

224
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:51,624
No? Nothing?

225
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,592
- What do they teach in Genii school?
- Hand her over. Right now.

226
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:57,497
- Okay, let's just talk about this.
- I'm growing impatient.

227
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:00,563
Our quarrel is not with you.

228
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:03,768
Once you hand her over,
you're free to go.

229
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:05,811
- Really?
- Yes.

230
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:10,965
You wouldn't.

231
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:14,153
You took a sacred oath to protect me.

232
00:12:14,931 --> 00:12:17,406
- Nah, I don't remember doing that.
<i>- I'm going to count to three.</i>

233
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,347
One...

234
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,240
- Where have you been?
- Well, my spidey senses

235
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,754
felt an ambush coming on.

236
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:33,630
And you couldn't mention it?

237
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,634
- Not without tipping them off, no.
- What took you so long?


238
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,940
I had to take a position so
I could shoot all three at once.

239
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:41,668
You okay?

240
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:42,818
No.

241
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:45,643
No, I most certainly am not.

242
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:48,559
This one was going to
hand me over to those men.

243
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,834
- No, I wasn't.
- I saw it in your eyes.

244
00:12:50,954 --> 00:12:52,426
You were considering it.

245
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:55,276
To save your own worthless,
cowardly hide.

246
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:58,197
I was keeping them talking, you know,
I was buying us time.

247
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:01,575
A little thing called "strategy"? You're
too young to know anything about it.

248
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:03,433
Oh, I understand strategy.

249
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:06,144
In fact, I'm forming one right now...

250
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:08,666
the second we return to the castle,
I will instruct

251
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:10,292
- my guards to...
- All right.

252
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:13,629
Plenty of time to come up
with punishments along the way.

253
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:18,607
- But, John...
- Thumb screws, you like them?

254
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,268
Yes.

255
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:22,620
Thumb screws are good.

256
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:27,561
We better find some cover. That back-up
he called is gonna be here any minute.

257
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:36,724
All right, this'll work.

258
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:40,059
Those were Genii.

259
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,008
Yeah, I picked up on that,
Rodney. Thanks.

260
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:42,953
So...

261
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:45,320
what are the Genii doing here?

262
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:47,928
And why do they want to kill her?

263
00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:49,749
I mean, aside from the obvious reasons.

264
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,401
Harmony?

265
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:53,535
I don't know.

266
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:55,379
I don't like the Genii.

267
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:57,256
But you know who they are.

268
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,592
<i>- Are you trading partners?</i>
- Not anymore.

269
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:01,968
- But you were.
- <i>Yes.</i>

270
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:04,812
But they cheated my mother
on many trades.

271
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,849
She banished them from our land.

272
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:09,049
What about you?

273
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:11,512
When you're queen,
are you gonna start trade back up?

274
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:13,439
No! Absolutely not.

275
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:16,451
So maybe somebody in the royal court's
a little more willing to play ball.

276
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:18,908
You know, once the path is cleared.

277
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,475
If I were to die,
my sister would succeed me.

278
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:25,950
But if the Genii think that she would be
more willing to trade than me,

279
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:27,911
they are sadly mistaken.

280
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:31,036
You really believe Ladon would give the
marching orders to kill a little girl...

281
00:14:31,156 --> 00:14:32,249
even this one?

282
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,319
I don't know how these people work.

283
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:37,630
Maybe he told someone to fix that,
and this is what they came up with.

284
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,048
It's creative.

285
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:42,290
Knowing why they're here
really doesn't help us out.

286
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:45,971
I need to get a take on how many
are out there. You stay with her, okay?

287
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:47,890
Sure.

288
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:50,258
All right, stay here, and stay quiet.

289
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:51,393
<i>Of course, John.</i>

290
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:53,904
Thank you for taking care of this.

291
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:56,565
I'm not sure what I would do
if you weren't here.

292
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:09,785
Tell me something, Doctor.

293
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,374
The place where you sleep at night,
is it guarded?

294
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:16,063
I know what you're trying to do,
it's not going to work.

295
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,509
I'm not scared of you.
You're just a kid. A bratty little kid.

296
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:21,688
I don't care you're gonna be queen.
Nothing could impress me less, so

297
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:25,227
why don't just cool it with bad seed act
and just go back to ignoring me?

298
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:28,847
Surely they can't guard you
all the time?

299
00:15:38,226 --> 00:15:40,720
<i>Squad three,
take up position on the ridge.</i>

300
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:43,215
<i>Squad four, move to map grid nine.</i>

301
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:46,654
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

302
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,968
Wonderful.

303
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:53,598
Stop it. What are you doing?

304
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:56,621
I'm burning your face into my memory.

305
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:58,907
- You...
- This way I can give the bounty hunters

306
00:15:59,027 --> 00:16:01,310
an extremely accurate
description of you.

307
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,481
All right, Your Highness,
I have had just about enough out of...

308
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:07,600
I thought I said
keep talking to the minimum?

309
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,204
I was... she was...

310
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,498
How many Genii are out there, John?

311
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:15,151
If I had to guess, I'd say all of them.

312
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:16,939
What, so, a lot of them?

313
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:18,397
Yes, Rodney. A lot.

314
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:20,941
This will make the pilgrimage
most difficult.

315
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:23,027
That's funny,
I was thinking the same thing.

316
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:27,803
I find we have much in common, John.

317
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:31,357
Yeah.

318
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,914
Anyway, I figure we wait for nightfall
and then head back to the settlement.

319
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:38,250
Back to the settlement?

320
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,960
Yep, road trip's over.

321
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,046
But that would make
this journey a failure.

322
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:45,257
You win some, you lose some. You wanna
be queen, learn how to cut your losses.

323
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:47,867
But the lunar cycle is nearing its end.

324
00:16:48,202 --> 00:16:50,815
If I do not make it to the ruins
by tomorrow's sundown,

325
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:52,181
I will forfeit the throne.

326
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:53,945
I'm sure they'll make an exception.

327
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:55,976
No, they cannot. It is our way.

328
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,622
It's too dangerous to move forward.

329
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:02,287
For you, perhaps.

330
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:08,030
If it's too dangerous for me,
it's definitely too dangerous for you.

331
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,450
We're gonna wait for nightfall, and then
we're gonna head back to the village.

332
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,952
- End of discussion.
- Fat chance of that.

333
00:17:15,003 --> 00:17:17,539
It's not your decision to make.
I'm the queen.

334
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:18,775
No. Not yet.

335
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:22,127
And until you are, you're just
a regular kid. I call the shots.

336
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:26,256
Many would consider
disobeying the queen a treasonous act.

337
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,927
Well, I'm sure they wouldn't look too
fondly on letting the queen get killed.

338
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,194
We're heading back.

339
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,069
You should not be here.

340
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:48,378
I was careful.

341
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:50,697
No one saw me, don't worry.

342
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,282
We use this from now on
to stay in contact.

343
00:17:56,854 --> 00:17:58,621
Does that mean it's not over yet?

344
00:17:58,741 --> 00:17:59,451
No.

345
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:02,913
Her two guardians have
complicated things greatly.

346
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:04,336
They killed three of my men.

347
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:06,261
Yes, well,

348
00:18:06,381 --> 00:18:08,424
they were an unforeseen complication.

349
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:09,800
My apologies.

350
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:12,342
Your apologies do me little good.

351
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:14,012
We will increase your pay,

352
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:15,352
don't worry.

353
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,474
Threefold.

354
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:18,934
Threefold?

355
00:18:19,094 --> 00:18:20,811
Triple the work, triple the pay.

356
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,771
You want us to kill them all?

357
00:18:23,484 --> 00:18:25,733
If they survive,
they'll come back and tell my sister

358
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:27,492
that the Genii were involved.

359
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:29,528
Now, we can't have that, can we?

360
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,720
Listen...

361
00:18:48,234 --> 00:18:50,612
- I've been doing a little thinking.
- Oh, you have, have you?

362
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:53,721
I've a Wraith stunner in my backpack.
She can't weigh more than 90 pounds.

363
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,099
I say we stun her
and just carry her back.

364
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,225
Well, we can't stun a 13-year-old girl.

365
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:02,638
<i>It's kinda dangerous.</i>

366
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:05,856
The forest is crawling with Genii. Who
knows when she'd throw one of her fits?

367
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:08,275
She'll be fine.
She understands how dangerous this is.

368
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:10,688
<i>- I talked to her.</i>
- I'm sure you did, but she's 13,

369
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:13,637
she's unreasonable,
among many other awful attributes.

370
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:15,722
They say you dislike
the things in others

371
00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:17,944
that you, in fact,
dislike about yourself.

372
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:19,201
So, what?

373
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:20,633
I'm just saying.

374
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:22,623
- We're nothing alike.
- Okay.

375
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:25,590
She's a stuck-up, know-it-all brat.

376
00:19:29,623 --> 00:19:32,629
It's about as dark as it's gonna get.
Let's wake her up and get moving.

377
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:36,094
Oh, no.

378
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:40,304
Oh, that sneaky little...

379
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:43,366
I told you we should've stunned her!

380
00:19:47,393 --> 00:19:48,601
I'm gonna kill her.

381
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,900
You really need to
work on your child skills.

382
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,032
We have been searching for her
for over an hour.

383
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,697
We have had not one, but two

384
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:58,503
close encounters with the Genii.

385
00:19:58,623 --> 00:20:00,951
All so some useless, spoiled brat

386
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:02,636
can make her meditation appointment?

387
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:04,960
- More searching, less complaining.
- Sorry, I'm hungry,

388
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,950
- and when I'm hungry, I get cranky.
- And when you get cranky, you get hit.

389
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,262
Okay, okay.

390
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:11,248
I wish Ronon was here.

391
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:14,299
You know, you said that out loud, right?
I mean, I'm right here.

392
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:16,739
Well, it's nothing personal.
It's just he's a better tracker

393
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:18,632
than both of us combined.

394
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:20,639
That's true.

395
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:26,566
Okay, I'm starting to hallucinate.

396
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:28,864
- Why? What do you see?
- Not see. Smell.

397
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:31,570
I smell food.
Delicious, fresh-cooked food.

398
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,749
Roast beef, hamburgers,
hot dogs, pork on a spit.

399
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:35,728
Chicken.

400
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:38,688
- Yeah, sure, the more, the merrier.
- No, I smell chicken.

401
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:43,984
The nose that knows. Follow me.

402
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:49,877
Ah. Found it.

403
00:20:50,745 --> 00:20:52,550
It's coming from down there.

404
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:56,004
Told you.
You don't need Ronon while I'm here.

405
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:58,710
What do you think?

406
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:01,461
- Genii camp?
- Give me your stunner.

407
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,228
All right, stay behind me.

408
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:19,510
John!

409
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:21,177
How did you find me?

410
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,064
We could smell your fire a mile away.

411
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:25,275
<i>That's okay.</i>

412
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:28,063
I was finished cooking anyway.

413
00:21:28,774 --> 00:21:30,007
You ran away from us.

414
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:31,751
You didn't give me any choice.

415
00:21:34,623 --> 00:21:36,536
We've been out there searching
for over an hour.

416
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:38,065
We almost were caught twice.

417
00:21:38,185 --> 00:21:40,743
Yes, it's very dangerous
out there right now.

418
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:44,375
That's why I decided to seek refuge
in this cave and make camp.

419
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,849
You made all of this?

420
00:21:48,313 --> 00:21:49,025
Yes,

421
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:50,740
and caught a loden bird.

422
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,352
- <i>They're quite delicious.</i>
- How?

423
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:57,004
You made all this with that?

424
00:21:57,124 --> 00:22:00,504
I told you, I completed three sessions
with Nolar Lumsbred.

425
00:22:00,624 --> 00:22:03,379
- They covered all that in 3 sessions?
- I am a quick learner.

426
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:04,528
Do you not listen?

427
00:22:09,765 --> 00:22:10,777
You're mad at me.

428
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,386
Our first fight.

429
00:22:16,689 --> 00:22:18,737
I knew it would happen eventually.

430
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,386
We'll laugh about this one day.

431
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:25,131
I'm sure we will,
but we got to get moving.

432
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:27,557
Right after we've eaten the loden bird.

433
00:22:29,188 --> 00:22:30,096
Or not.

434
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:34,898
That sounded very, very close.

435
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:38,627
Are we sure this isn't the beast's cave?

436
00:22:38,747 --> 00:22:39,988
You're so ignorant.

437
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:42,349
<i>The beast doesn't live in caves.</i>

438
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:44,992
We should stay here
until the coast is clear.

439
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:46,313
All right.

440
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:48,020
Half-hour, tops.

441
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:51,193
Good. I'm hungry.

442
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:09,751
I brought you the bird's heart.

443
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:13,995
My people believe
it brings you great luck once consumed.

444
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:15,828
Thanks, but no thanks.

445
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:18,734
- You're sure?
- Pretty sure, yeah.

446
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:20,461
Very well.

447
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:26,635
Are you still mad at me?

448
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:28,335
No, I'm over it.

449
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:30,380
That's good.

450
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:34,344
- I don't like it when you're mad at me.
- Well, don't give me reason to be mad.

451
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:36,399
Very well.

452
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,541
So you're 13, huh?

453
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:41,923
I'll be 14 in five lunar cycles.

454
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:43,683
Right.

455
00:23:44,463 --> 00:23:45,802
Nervous about being queen?

456
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:46,877
No.

457
00:23:47,588 --> 00:23:49,910
- Why would I be?
- Well, it's a lot of responsibility.

458
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:51,895
I know that.

459
00:23:52,274 --> 00:23:56,340
You gotta put the needs of your people
before anything else including your own.

460
00:23:57,588 --> 00:24:00,213
- Some of the time, yes.
- No, pretty much all the time.

461
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,153
I'm sure I will strike a proper balance.

462
00:24:04,273 --> 00:24:07,217
Just remember... you're not queen
because of divine right,

463
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:09,529
you're queen because
they allow you to be queen.

464
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:13,791
If you're mean to the people, they may
change their minds. Just remember that.

465
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:17,015
You know much about leadership, John.

466
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,842
Hard-earned lessons along the way.

467
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,840
And I know much about my people.

468
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:26,085
I hope so.

469
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:30,588
I think we would make a good team.

470
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:33,485
As queen...

471
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:36,392
I will one day need

472
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:37,978
a king...

473
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:42,277
Listen, Harmony...

474
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,310
<i>There's no need to answer now.</i>

475
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:47,466
I know such an offer
must be overwhelming.

476
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:50,153
<i>You shouldn't make your decision rashly.</i>

477
00:24:50,273 --> 00:24:53,261
Well, I'm pretty sure I know
which way I'm leaning.

478
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:56,007
You're a great little lady.
It's just that...

479
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:06,299
- What the hell was that?
- The Genii just had a little run-in

480
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:07,885
with the beast.

481
00:25:08,171 --> 00:25:10,965
All right, be a brave girl
and stay here with McKay.

482
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:13,390
Hey, hey! How come I always
get stuck being the babysitter?

483
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,091
You want to check out the beast?

484
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:16,278
No, I'm good here.

485
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:18,272
Thought so. Stay here.

486
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:30,652
This is Mardola.

487
00:25:30,772 --> 00:25:31,772
I want an update.

488
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:33,452
What's taking so long?

489
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:36,955
I have men all along the path
to the ruins. They've gone another way.

490
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:40,709
Well, obviously. They're not idiots.
You should be looking everywhere but

491
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,112
<i>the path to the ruins.</i>

492
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:43,902
I am, but it's night,

493
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:47,265
and this forest is vast and dense.
My men are spread thin.

494
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,023
What if they make it back
to the village?

495
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:53,221
<i>There's no way that I could save
relations between our two peoples then.</i>

496
00:25:54,093 --> 00:25:56,344
We've just lost contact
with some of my men.

497
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:58,393
We're heading to
their last-known co-ordinates.

498
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:01,525
<i>Maybe we'll get lucky. Teran out.</i>

499
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,647
You're a doctor, right?

500
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:15,404
Yes. Yes. I mean,
I'm not a medical doctor...

501
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:16,810
So you're a liar?

502
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:18,713
No, I'm a...

503
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:21,869
What do you want?

504
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,647
- What does love feel like?
- Oh, boy...

505
00:26:26,436 --> 00:26:28,298
Because I think I'm in love with John.

506
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:31,009
It wouldn't be the first time,
and I'm sure it won't be the last.

507
00:26:31,602 --> 00:26:33,705
- What does that mean?
- It means that a lot of people,

508
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,417
particularly alien women, tend to fall

509
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:37,775
<i>for John Sheppard's
good looks and charm.</i>

510
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:39,498
Not like me they don't.

511
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:42,483
He's a bit old for you, don't you think?

512
00:26:43,206 --> 00:26:44,515
I hadn't considered it.

513
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:46,441
He will, so don't get your hopes up.


514
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,526
You're not going to try
and influence him, are you?

515
00:26:49,646 --> 00:26:51,112
I won't need to. Trust me.

516
00:26:53,664 --> 00:26:55,325
You don't like me very much, do you?

517
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:58,458
No, that's not true. I...

518
00:27:00,336 --> 00:27:01,964
I don't not like you.

519
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:05,126
What does that mean?

520
00:27:05,921 --> 00:27:08,750
You have an annoying attitude,
but I'm willing to cut you some slack,

521
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,716
- because you're still just a child.
- <i>Whereas if I were</i>

522
00:27:11,877 --> 00:27:12,943
grown up,

523
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:16,555
my annoying attitude
would be less excusable?

524
00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:18,833
That's right. An adult would...

525
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,480
- Hey, I don't have an attitude problem.
- And I don't not like you.

526
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:31,831
Well, that's sweet of you to say.

527
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:36,825
So you promise not to get between
John and me?

528
00:27:38,648 --> 00:27:39,648
I promise.

529
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:42,946
I'll give you this...

530
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:46,074
you're a lot more mature
than the women he usually falls for.

531
00:27:48,743 --> 00:27:50,073
Thank you, Doctor.

532
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,591
<i>What do you got?</i>

533
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,429
Two dead Genii.

534
00:28:07,758 --> 00:28:09,058
It's not pretty.

535
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:10,859
Multiple puncture wounds.

536
00:28:11,936 --> 00:28:13,278
You mean like teeth marks?

537
00:28:13,704 --> 00:28:14,970
I don't think so.

538
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:18,617
So... so, what? Claws?
Talons? A very sharp beak?

539
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:22,265
I don't know. It's not like anything
I've ever seen before.

540
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:27,163
Over here.

541
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:39,335
- What kind of creature could do this?
- It doesn't matter.

542
00:28:39,455 --> 00:28:42,367
We don't leave this forest
until all three of them are dead.

543
00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:58,647
What took you so long?
I thought for sure we'd lost you!

544
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:01,377
I ran into Genii. Had to lie low
until it was safe to move.

545
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:03,189
- So what happened?
- I don't know,

546
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:05,307
but whatever that beast thing is,
it's lethal.

547
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,784
I could have told you that.

548
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:08,666
Also...

549
00:29:08,826 --> 00:29:11,372
the Genii have shoot-to-kill
orders for all of us.

550
00:29:12,143 --> 00:29:12,940
Super.

551
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,960
All right, princess, let's move.

552
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:23,244
Wait!

553
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,902
What?

554
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:26,175
Where are you going?

555
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:28,894
Where does it look like?
We're going back to the settlement.

556
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:31,327
But we're so close to the ruins.

557
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,086
And it's almost daybreak.

558
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:36,039
The fact that it's almost daybreak is
a bad thing. We need the cover of night.

559
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:39,311
I can't come this far
and just turn back.

560
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:40,462
I refuse.

561
00:29:40,582 --> 00:29:42,805
You know, I still have the unner-stay.

562
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:46,650
The best thing
you could do is go that way.

563
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,729
That sounded a little weird.

564
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,279
Hating to agree with the child, but...

565
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:55,769
Give me that.

566
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:58,828
The beast will avoid the ruins.

567
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:01,386
- We'll be safe there.
- How far are they?

568
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:02,804
A half hour or so.

569
00:30:02,964 --> 00:30:04,186
So what do you say?

570
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:06,692
Well, it's better
than running into the beast.

571
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:27,917
I was afraid of this.

572
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,238
That's sacred ground. How dare he?

573
00:30:30,358 --> 00:30:31,258
Hey. Hey!

574
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:34,547
We'll handle this, all right?

575
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:38,946
- I'll do that.
- I got it. It's okay.

576
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:41,633
- Really, just... just...
- Steady...

577
00:30:42,652 --> 00:30:44,353
come to papa.

578
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:46,313
Let's go...

579
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:52,812
- Hey! Hey.
- What?

580
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:56,564
You have subdued him.

581
00:31:00,248 --> 00:31:01,570
Now we can go.

582
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:13,761
Oh! Fascinating.

583
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,975
Ancient?

584
00:31:16,763 --> 00:31:18,507
Yeah. Obviously.

585
00:31:19,525 --> 00:31:20,597
It's weird...

586
00:31:21,052 --> 00:31:23,121
this place seems strangely familiar.

587
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:29,112
It's even more beautiful
than I imagined.

588
00:31:37,318 --> 00:31:38,663
Something's wrong.

589
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:40,055
What?

590
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:41,890
It's not working.

591
00:31:42,688 --> 00:31:45,532
Shouldn't you be, like,
silently meditating or something?

592
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:48,785
My pendant... it's supposed to glow.

593
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,671
Well, I'll be damned.

594
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,333
- Let me guess.
- Oh, yeah, it's Ancient.

595
00:31:55,493 --> 00:31:56,960
<i>It's the Pendant of Laros.</i>

596
00:31:57,686 --> 00:32:01,435
The queen, and only the true queen,
must return it to the ruins.

597
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,801
Once here, it is to glow
and imbue me with great power.

598
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:06,970
Your sisters kind of failed
to mention that.

599
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:09,560
It is one of our greatest secrets.

600
00:32:11,142 --> 00:32:12,725
It's the testing ground.

601
00:32:12,885 --> 00:32:14,852
- What?
- I know what this place is!

602
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:18,176
I've been reading about it. We've been
looking for it for the last two years.

603
00:32:18,296 --> 00:32:21,155
- I've seen the schematics.
- Share with the class.

604
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:24,152
Well, believe it or not, this place
actually does control the beast...

605
00:32:24,272 --> 00:32:26,531
- if the beast is what I think it is.
- Which is?

606
00:32:26,691 --> 00:32:29,195
Mini-drones, if I'm right, and
you can usually take that to the bank.

607
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:32,161
This planet must have been where the
Ancients first developed drone tech.

608
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:34,433
It was their main testing ground!

609
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:37,236
That would explain why the Genii
look like swiss cheese.

610
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:40,120
- The mini-drones went right through'em!
- And that noise the beast was making

611
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,255
was more like an electric
swarm than a growl.

612
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:45,508
So the pendant is...

613
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:47,326
Probably some sort of pass-key.

614
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:50,539
Ancients weren't above protecting
their research, even from each other.

615
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:52,096
You need more than just the gene

616
00:32:52,216 --> 00:32:54,559
in order to activate or control
the drones, otherwise...

617
00:32:55,114 --> 00:32:56,352
Yes, yes, yes, of course!

618
00:32:56,512 --> 00:32:57,781
It's in auto-protect mode!

619
00:32:57,901 --> 00:33:00,301
They're trolling the forest,
taking out anybody without the gene.

620
00:33:00,421 --> 00:33:02,874
That's why they stayed clear of us
and went straight for the Genii.

621
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:05,194
The royal pain here must have it,
as well.

622
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:06,613
Why isn't it working?

623
00:33:07,228 --> 00:33:09,073
Well, maybe because genius over there

624
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:11,578
- was messing with the crystal tray?
- All right, so?

625
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:15,133
Well, so give me a second to figure out
how much damage he's done.

626
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:24,589
The machine is broken.

627
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:27,064
<i>That's why your pendant isn't glowing.</i>

628
00:33:27,184 --> 00:33:29,546
It's got nothing to do with machines.

629
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,124
If I am worthy of being queen,

630
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:36,295
the Gods will bestow the power of
pure light and make my pendant glow.

631
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:42,265
Well, who knows what kind of
wacky rules they've imposed on it.

632
00:33:42,385 --> 00:33:45,276
I mean, I suppose it's possible that
once a generation, the key needs to be

633
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:48,195
reactivated here. Maybe it's the thing
that allows them to use the Ancient

634
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:51,041
<i>- tech they have back at the castle.</i>
- It's complicated,

635
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:54,619
but it will light up.
We just need to make some repairs.

636
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,622
You don't understand.

637
00:33:57,937 --> 00:33:58,956
I've failed.

638
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,730
Maybe I'm not supposed to be queen.

639
00:34:04,846 --> 00:34:05,712
Maybe...

640
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:09,029
maybe we've come all
this way for nothing.

641
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:11,217
Trust me, it'll glow.

642
00:34:23,613 --> 00:34:24,588
Wake up.

643
00:34:26,702 --> 00:34:28,013
What'd you do to this thing?

644
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,291
I'm not sure.

645
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,114
I just rearranged the crystals.

646
00:34:31,274 --> 00:34:34,158
Don't tell them a thing. They're
going to kill us one way or the other.

647
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,053
Can you get it to work?

648
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:38,393
Not quickly. I can come back
with a Jumper and a small team

649
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:39,650
and get it working.

650
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:47,235
Listen.

651
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:51,113
- We're going to head back.
- No!

652
00:34:51,743 --> 00:34:54,420
If I return with a darkened pendant,
I won't be allowed to...

653
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,348
Yes, you will be queen,
I promise you! It's just busted.

654
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:02,478
This isn't the type of thing where
you got a second chance, John, please.

655
00:35:04,147 --> 00:35:06,232
I can do it. I just need to focus more.

656
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:13,322
Easy does it.

657
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,244
<i>Huron, come in.</i>

658
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:17,493
<i>Huron. Come in.</i>

659
00:35:19,643 --> 00:35:22,874
If we don't respond,
they're going to come and investigate.

660
00:35:24,985 --> 00:35:25,835
Huron here.

661
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:27,378
<i>What's your status?</i>

662
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:28,768
Good.

663
00:35:28,888 --> 00:35:30,053
<i>Elaborate.</i>

664
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:33,412
- Real good.
- Help us!

665
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,011
Kinda busy, got to go!

666
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:40,572
Well, it was worth a shot.
You got to get that thing workin', fast.

667
00:35:40,692 --> 00:35:42,179
Why can't we just run for it?

668
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:44,988
We're boxed in from all directions.
We've got to get

669
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:47,356
- those mini-drones working, or...
- Or we die.

670
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,835
You know, you're not exactly
inspiring confidence.

671
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:09,383
Yeah? How so?

672
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:12,604
You're hiding behind a foot of solid
rock. How am I supposed to feel out here

673
00:36:12,724 --> 00:36:14,955
with only a cool breeze
between me and the Genii?

674
00:36:15,075 --> 00:36:17,136
You're more than welcome
to come get cover

675
00:36:17,297 --> 00:36:19,527
for yourself, as soon as you're done
with those repairs.

676
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:22,850
Do you have any idea how many crystal
placement combinations there are?

677
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,578
- More than seven?
- Try 7,000.

678
00:36:26,305 --> 00:36:27,730
Well, that's less than infinite.

679
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:31,783
All right, look.

680
00:36:32,132 --> 00:36:35,785
It's going to get very,
very noisy when the Genii get here.

681
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:36,864
Screaming?

682
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:40,062
No, these guns,
they make a lot of noise.

683
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:41,742
It's very important

684
00:36:41,862 --> 00:36:44,835
<i>that you stay put and keep
your ears covered, okay?</i>

685
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:46,791
Shouldn't you give me a gun instead?

686
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:50,670
You're gonna stay put, cover your ears,
and you're not gonna move, okay?

687
00:36:54,814 --> 00:36:56,467
Son of bitch! I think I got it!

688
00:36:58,379 --> 00:37:00,304
Harmony! What did I just say?

689
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:15,570
Go, go, go, go!

690
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:25,413
You're surrounded!

691
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:29,213
<i>You have limited ammunition,
and I have unlimited men! </i>

692
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,710
We'll take our chances.

693
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,421
If you make this hard,
I will make your death as slow

694
00:37:33,581 --> 00:37:35,423
<i>and as painful as possible.</i>

695
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:39,385
Okay, what's option number two?

696
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:42,713
Give us the girl,
and we'll let you go free.

697
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:43,556
<i>Never!</i>

698
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,397
They would rather die than deal
with the likes of you savages.

699
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:50,271
<i>When my sisters hear of this,
the Genii will be finished!</i>

700
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:52,005
Finished, do you hear?

701
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,233
How do you think we knew
how to find you, little one?

702
00:37:54,393 --> 00:37:55,253
You lie!

703
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:59,447
Come at us with all you have!
I shall silence you once and for all!

704
00:38:00,624 --> 00:38:02,408
Let us handle this, okay?

705
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,115
You have one minute!

706
00:38:10,132 --> 00:38:11,208
It can't be true.

707
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:13,544
It doesn't matter right now,
to be honest.

708
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,338
How can you say that?

709
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:17,723
Did you get that thing working?

710
00:38:17,843 --> 00:38:19,862
Yeah, before
they started shooting at it.

711
00:38:19,982 --> 00:38:21,448
So it's broken again?

712
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:24,138
It was powered up.
50-50 chance it's still operational.

713
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:26,306
<i>Provide me with cover.</i>

714
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:29,289
I'll make it to the pedestal,
summon the beast, and smite them.

715
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:32,326
There'll be no smiting today,
little lady.

716
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:34,148
You've never even
used that thing before.

717
00:38:34,308 --> 00:38:37,028
But I am the queen,
and the beast is my protector.

718
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,489
It's a little more
complicated than that.

719
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:44,042
You say anyone with
the Ancient gene can activate it?

720
00:38:44,162 --> 00:38:46,686
Yeah, as long as
they're wearing the pendant.

721
00:38:47,044 --> 00:38:47,954
Exactly!

722
00:38:48,114 --> 00:38:48,955
50-50?

723
00:38:49,115 --> 00:38:51,958
100% chance they'll kill us if
we talk about it for much longer.

724
00:38:52,078 --> 00:38:54,585
- You got a full mag there?
- Locked and loaded.

725
00:38:54,745 --> 00:38:55,638
On three?

726
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,547
Okay.

727
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:58,218
Yes. Excellent.

728
00:38:58,499 --> 00:38:59,303
One...

729
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:00,990
two...

730
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:03,147
three!

731
00:39:24,925 --> 00:39:26,540
What are you waiting for?

732
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:28,286
Shoot him!

733
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:40,942
You all right?

734
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:42,724
Yeah, I'm good. You?

735
00:39:42,953 --> 00:39:43,981
Sure, sure.

736
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:48,580
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

737
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,545
You're young. I'm sure you'll meet

738
00:39:51,812 --> 00:39:54,189
even braver men
than me as you get older.

739
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:55,980
Not you, usurper!

740
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:59,317
<i>You're lucky I like you,
or you would be hung for treason!</i>

741
00:39:59,992 --> 00:40:00,818
But you...

742
00:40:01,793 --> 00:40:03,090
<i>you saved my life.</i>

743
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,716
- I did?
- When the Genii started firing at me,

744
00:40:07,106 --> 00:40:08,367
you threw yourself on me,

745
00:40:08,816 --> 00:40:10,911
<i>- using your own body as a shield.
- Oh, no.</i>

746
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:14,373
No, no, no. I just... I tripped and fell
on top of you. It was an accident.

747
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:15,986
And then...

748
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:17,668
you pulled me to safety.

749
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,173
You don't... don't not like me.

750
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:24,759
You like me!

751
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:26,218
No. No, no.

752
00:40:26,379 --> 00:40:27,428
No, I'm...

753
00:40:27,588 --> 00:40:28,288
<i>Yes!</i>

754
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:31,351
You saved my life
and restored the ruins.

755
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:35,011
You are a hero, Dr. McKay,
both to me and my people.

756
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,250
Well, I don't know about "hero." I mean,
exceptionally courageous, perhaps...

757
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,658
And modest, too.

758
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:42,026
It's time to go,
before the Genii come back.

759
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:44,031
I doubt it.

760
00:40:44,983 --> 00:40:46,280
They are a simple people,

761
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:49,607
<i>and I'm sure they were
most impressed by your actions.</i>

762
00:40:49,944 --> 00:40:51,577
I, however, was not.

763
00:41:01,048 --> 00:41:02,803
The pendant still glows.

764
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:05,752
The gods have deemed me worthy.

765
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:07,927
Now we can go.

766
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:21,440
You've returned!

767
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:25,889
What are you doing?
These are my private quarters.

768
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:29,068
It's all right, Mardola.
They've already searched my room.

769
00:41:29,188 --> 00:41:31,242
- You should allow it.
- Why?

770
00:41:31,512 --> 00:41:33,119
The Genii attacked us.

771
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:34,561
Oh, well,

772
00:41:34,767 --> 00:41:37,289
it was a good thing Colonel Sheppard
was there to protect you.

773
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:40,326
They knew the location
of the ruins, Mardola. How?

774
00:41:40,446 --> 00:41:42,670
You ask as if I would know.

775
00:41:50,037 --> 00:41:52,096
You're too young to be queen, Harmony!

776
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:53,204
Perhaps...

777
00:41:54,397 --> 00:41:56,518
but when you're released from prison,

778
00:41:56,695 --> 00:41:58,352
you'll be too old to remember.

779
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:10,656
<i>Dr. Rodney McKay</i>

780
00:42:10,816 --> 00:42:12,465
and Colonel John Sheppard,

781
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:16,412
your contribution to my people
may never be repaid.

782
00:42:17,045 --> 00:42:19,808
Well, we didn't do it for compensation,
Your Highness-ness.

783
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:20,827
Kiss-ass.

784
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:23,127
<i>I personally owe you a debt of gratitude</i>

785
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:26,161
for your help defeating
the regicidal Genii.

786
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:29,758
I've had one of the Court's
finest artisans feature you

787
00:42:29,918 --> 00:42:32,474
in a rendering of our glorious victory.

788
00:42:47,836 --> 00:42:50,117
Yeah, pretty much how I remember it.
