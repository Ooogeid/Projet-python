00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,472
<i>Previously on </i>Stargate: Atlantis...

2
00:00:02,597 --> 00:00:04,103
Lower your weapons.

3
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:06,672
We've come up with a gene therapy.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,966
We think we can make it so that you

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,304
will never need
to feed on humans again.

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,922
How did you do that?

7
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:18,100
Surely you don't think we did this?

8
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,604
What the hell's going on?
Where's Caldwell?

9
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,733
We need everyone we can.
We're taking the ship back.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,278
Todd let us take her back
without a fight,

11
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:34,283
but he's locked us out of the controls
and retreated to one of the 302 bays.

12
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,037
That's how he's going to destroy
the facility, by ramming us into it.

13
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:42,293
What'd you do?

14
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:45,503
Opened up a hyperspace window
big enough for the both of us.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,100
We just traveled through the planet.

16
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:53,969
- How long till they get here?
- Just a matter of minutes.

17
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,755
- Are we prepared to cloak the City?
- Yes, it's all set,

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,683
but for the record,
I still say the shield is a better idea.

19
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:02,645
Look, that cloak offers us
no protection whatsoever.

20
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,206
- If that hive opens up on us...
- How could they do that?

21
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,514
- They'd have to know our position.
- What, you're assuming they don't?

22
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:12,195
We've been tracking them for days!
They've got some inside information!

23
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,491
It's better not to confirm our location
until we know for sure.

24
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:18,744
No sense in giving them
an easy target to shoot at.

25
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:21,074
Colonel Sheppard,
what's your status?

26
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:24,502
- Standing by.
- <i>Be prepared to fire drones on my mark.</i>

27
00:01:24,723 --> 00:01:27,419
Copy that.
Just say the word.

28
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:30,787
Well,

29
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:34,093
I suppose we're as prepared
as we can be. Engage the cloak.

30
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:36,110
All right.

31
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,818
Okay. Cloak's engaged.

32
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,102
They should be here momentarily.

33
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:08,728
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

34
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:12,840
- They're just sitting there.
- Do they know we're here?

35
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:17,054
Hang on.
I'm receiving a transmission.

36
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,180
- It's a file of some kind.
- Pull it up on a firewalled computer.

37
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:35,038
- What's it say?
- It's nothing... a random bunch of...

38
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:37,420
- Wait a second.
- What is it?

39
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:38,591
It's encrypted.

40
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:41,462
Using the same kind of algorithm
we use on the Daedalus.

41
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,684
<i>Hold your fire...
Gene therapy developed...</i>

42

<i>by Dr. Keller...</i>

43
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:53,030
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

44
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:55,174
Looks like
the file's corrupted somehow.

45
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,636
<i>... initial results unable
to counteract the disease...</i>

46
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,000
<i>Help us.</i>

47
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:08,896
What on Earth does that mean?

48
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,127
I have no idea.

52
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:29,878
What do you mean,
you didn't understand him?

53
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:33,629
<i>The file was corrupted.
<i>We were only able to catch a few words.</i></i>

54
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:37,580
<i>Though, from what we could tell,
<i>it seemed like he was asking for help.</i></i>

55
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:38,591
With what?

56
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:40,885
Something to do
with Jennifer's gene therapy?

57
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,846
Well, we gave him a chance to test it.
He double-crossed us.

58
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:46,752
I say we blow him out of the sky.

59
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:48,978
I can't say I disagree with you.

60
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:52,564
Though I do find it odd
he would just show up here,

61
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,399
knowing that would be our reaction.

62
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,402
And why send a file?
Why not just radio us directly?

63
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,738
Whatever he wants,
it must be really important.

64
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,816
Perhaps we should answer back.

65
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,044
Tell him that we did not
receive the file properly?

66
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:05,940
We might as well
just drop the cloak.

67
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:08,950
They'll be able
to trace our radio signal.

68
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,500
No. We might be able
to do it from a Jumper.

69
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:14,293
Approach the hive cloaked,
and communicate with them from there.

70
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:16,907
But then they would be able
to pinpoint the Jumper's exact location.

71
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:20,001
Yes, but the Jumper's a lot more
maneuverable than the City.

72
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:24,192
This isn't the first time
we've flown up to Todd's doorstep.

73
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:28,237
Any chance
you could clean up that video?

74
00:04:28,362 --> 00:04:32,062
- Piece together what he's saying?
- No, there's too much data missing.

75
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:35,649
All right.
Colonel?

76
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:37,143
On my way.

77
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:50,129
Coming up on it now.

78
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:55,969
This is Colonel John Sheppard.

79
00:04:56,565 --> 00:04:57,880
Please come in.

80
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:03,941
We didn't receive
your video transmission correctly.

81
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,366
Please respond.

82
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:07,565
Are they getting this?

83
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,851
Yeah, they should be.
I mean, there's no reason why they...

84
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:14,354
- What is it?
- I'm not picking up any life-signs.

85
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:18,155
- What?
- I believe Rodney is correct.

86
00:05:18,427 --> 00:05:21,002
I have also not been able to detect
the presence of any Wraith.

87
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:23,863
I thought it was because we were
too far, but this makes more sense.

88
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:25,165
It does?

89
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,557
This better not be a ship
from another reality.

90
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:30,526
We've been tracking their approach
for a few days now, remember?

91
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:33,440
It didn't just pop into our space
like that other Daedalus did.

92
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:36,567
Look, we know that they don't show up
on our scans when they're hibernating.

93
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:38,877
I'd say that's probably
a more logical explanation.

94
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,252
Hibernating.
All of them?

95
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,269
They could've pre-programmed the ship
to fly here on its own, enter orbit,

96
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:45,223
even send a pre-recorded signal.

97
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:48,265
- Why?
- There's only one way to find out.

98
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:54,717
We're receiving a signal. It's Colonel
Sheppard on a secure channel.

99
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:56,004
Patch me in.

100
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,105
What's happening up there?

101
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,150
Well, the Wraith have thrown us
a little curve ball here.

102
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,489
<i>Got no life signs on board.
We think they're hibernating.</i>

103
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,695
Why do that?

104
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,532
That's what we'd like to find out,
but it means boarding the ship.

105
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,867
Are you sure that's wise?
What if it's a trap?

106
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,740
Well, if it is, it's a pretty lousy one.
If they ambush us,

107
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:14,997
you can still take 'em out
from down there.

108
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:17,000
Sacrificing your lives.

109
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:20,336
I'm flattered you think Todd
would go to so much trouble to kill me.

110
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:22,297
Look, taking out a hive ship

111
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,667
is always a good idea,
but we did come all this way,

112
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:28,522
and... got all dressed up.

113
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:30,395
All right.

114
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:39,405
No sign of 'em yet.

115
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:42,362
Why is it that I find empty Hives

116
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,551
even creepier than the ones
that are full of Wraith?

117
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:46,873
Trust me, we're better off this way.

118
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:48,800
Bridge should be up here.

119
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,385
All right, just...
give me a few seconds.

120
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:05,957
All right.

121
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,931
Well, I was right.
They're all in their hibernation pods.

122
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:15,923
- Where?
- There's chambers in the aft section.

123
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:19,270
The weird thing is, though,
if I'm reading this right,

124
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,355
they haven't given themselves
a wake-up call.

125
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:23,149
What?

126
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,738
The normal procedure
would be to leave crew members awake

127
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:29,197
so that they could monitor the pods
and bring the others out when it's time,

128
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,404
but since they all went in,
there'd be some kind of an automatic

129
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:34,786
or timed shut-down protocol,
but I can't find one.

130
00:07:35,117 --> 00:07:37,080
So if we do not wake them...

131
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:40,958
- Then they never will.
- Sounds good to me.

132
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:45,177
Do you do not find it odd
that Todd would leave himself

133
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:48,883
and his entire crew to our mercy?
Especially after our last encounter?

134
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:52,068
Maybe he's not as smart
as you think he is.

135
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:57,139
- What was that?
- Some kind of power fluctuation.

136
00:07:57,688 --> 00:08:00,936
I'm reading minor malfunctions
in several of the ship's systems.

137
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:03,942
Hang on...

138
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,553
I got Todd's video file.
Looks like it's intact.

139
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,254
- I thought it was corrupted.
- It must've happened in transmission,

140
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:11,030
some glitch in the comm system.

141
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,991
- The original, it's there. All right.
- Let's see it.

142
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,370
<i>Hold your fire.
We mean you no harm.</i>

143
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:22,286
<i>Allow me to explain our presence here
before you take any action.</i>

144
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:24,292
<i>If you are seeing this message,</i>

145
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:27,463
<i>my ship has arrived safely
at Atlantis.</i>

146
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:30,550
<i>I'm coming to you because my crew</i>

147
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:34,285
<i>and I have been stricken
with a disease...</i>

148
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,837
<i>A complication to the gene therapy
developed by Dr. Keller...</i>

149
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,150
- Wait a second. We didn't give 'em...
- <i>... I acquired some of the formulation</i>

150
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:45,268
<i>while my crew and I
were occupying the Daedalus.</i>

151
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:48,363
<i>I admit,</i>

152
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:51,621
<i>I wanted to see
if it would actually work.</i>

153
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:54,658
<i>And it did.</i>

154
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:57,577
<i>The initial results
were nothing short of astonishing.</i>

155
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,075
<i>See for yourself.</i>

156
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:06,998
<i>I was so impressed,
I decided to treat my entire crew.</i>

157
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:11,152
<i>It was only then that we began
to notice problems.</i>

158
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,428
<i>The first group grew sick and died.</i>

159
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:19,801
<i>Before long,
others began to get sick as well.</i>

160
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:23,477
<i>Our natural healing ability
was unable to counteract the disease.</i>

161
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:26,667
<i>I have come here</i>

162
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,317
<i>as a matter of last resort.</i>

163
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:32,820
<i>I realize</i>

164
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:35,491
<i>we have had our differences of late,</i>

165
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,618
<i>and you may be reluctant
to help us...</i>

166
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:44,825
<i>But remember this...</i>

167
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,278
<i>If we die, any hope you may have</i>

168
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:52,964
<i>of distributing this treatment
in the future dies with us.</i>

169
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,314
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

170
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:09,430
Now that we know what happened,

171
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:12,864
we can just fire drones at 'em,
and close the file and move on.

172
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:15,863
You said his feeding hand
was clean...

173
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,698
Which means the treatment worked,
at least for a while.

174
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,900
Then it started killing them,
so I don't know

175
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:22,869
if they're gonna line up
for this one.

176
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:25,706
Which is why we need to find out
exactly what went wrong.

177
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:30,377
We need to examine every scrap
of medical data on that Hive.

178
00:10:31,554 --> 00:10:34,340
We may even need to revive
a few of the Wraith

179
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,559
so Dr. Keller can perform
a complete physical evaluation.

180
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:40,304
I'm sorry, but the IOA
is strongly committed

181
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:42,347
to the development
of this gene therapy.

182
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:44,265
It's a thing they all agree on.

183
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,936
If it's simply not workable, so be it,
but they're going to want to see proof.

184
00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:51,865
I say it works fine. It kills Wraith.
What more do you want?

185
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,928
You're suggesting
we keep the formula as is,

186
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,112
and find a way of exposing them
involuntarily.

187
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,303
Why not?

188
00:10:58,428 --> 00:11:01,867
Get rid of the Wraith once and for all.
The IOA would approved that.

189
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,785
The problem is in
the delivery systems.

190
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,540
We just went down this road
with Beckett's retrovirus.

191
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,803
And even if we do succeed
in weaponizing the treatment,

192
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:11,584
it is unlikely that we would
wipe out the Wraith entirely.

193
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,859
At best, we would weaken them.

194
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:16,672
- I don't have a problem with that.
- On the other hand,

195
00:11:16,797 --> 00:11:19,365
if we do succeed in eliminating
their need to feed,

196
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,013
we might be able convince them
to take the treatment willingly.

197
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:27,226
Either way, whether it's perfecting
the formula as a treatment or a weapon,

198
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:30,228
we need to gather as much information
as we possibly can,

199
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:32,272
which brings me back
to the same conclusion...

200
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:33,898
We need to go back up there.

201
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,942
This time,
have Dr. Keller accompany you,

202
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:39,786
as well as Major Lorne's team
and another unit of Marines.

203
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:42,740
Are you still not sure
if it's a trap?

204
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:44,919
Let's just say
I've learned to exercise

205
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,830
an abundance of caution
when dealing with Todd.

206
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:49,955
All right.

207
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:05,886
My men have established a perimeter.
They'll be checking in every hour.

208
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,949
I know! I know!
Power fluctuations.

209
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:15,615
Look, it's like I said, some of the
ship's systems are acting up a little.

210
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,944
- Well, get it fixed.
- Yeah, give me a few minutes.

211
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,138
Major Lorne,
this is Lieutenant Williams.

212
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:48,108
Go ahead.

213
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,533
<i>Sir, you wanted us to report
anything unusual?</i>

214
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,925
That's right, Lieutenant.
What do you got?

215
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,652
<i>Well, Sir, I was standing watch,
and I heard a noise, and...</i>

216
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,192
The wall is melting.

217
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:02,293
Sorry? Come again?

218
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:04,447
<i>Wait a minute...
I think it stopped.</i>

219
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:05,675
Stand by.

220
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:16,275
Williams, come in.

221
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:19,013
Lieutenant, please respond.

222
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:32,827
How you doing?

223
00:13:34,886 --> 00:13:35,895
That good?

224
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:38,459
I don't know, I mean, I...

225
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:40,586
I guess I'm making progress.

226
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:43,842
- I found out what was killing them.
- You did?

227
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,162
The treatment worked exactly
like it was supposed to...

228
00:13:46,287 --> 00:13:49,662
It eliminated their feeding hands,
it activated their digestive systems,

229
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,703
just like it did in the simulation,

230
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:54,725
but, unfortunately, it also created

231
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,406
a virulent cancer-like disease
at the same time that it was weakening

232
00:13:58,531 --> 00:14:00,920
their immune systems.
That's what killed them.

233
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,336
Well, is there anything
you can do about it?

234
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:05,717
I don't know. Maybe.
It's possible.

235
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:07,345
What?

236
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:10,558
I just feel like
I'm in over my head.

237
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,401
What are you talking about?

238
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:16,228
I look at you, and Colonel Sheppard,
the rest of the team...

239
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:18,425
You guys are so used
to making decisions

240
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,773
that affect the lives of thousands,

241
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:22,212
and even millions of people.

242
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,737
I'm not so used to having the fate
of the galaxy hang in the balance.

243
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:29,074
Oh, that. You get used to it.
Helps to have a massive ego.

244
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:32,285
Look, I don't know much
about Wraith physiology,

245
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,398
but I know you.

246
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:36,029
And if anyone can make this work,
you can.

247
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:46,331
Well... This is
his last known position.

248
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,510
Colonel! We got something over here!

249
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,136
Hasn't been fired.

250
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:07,648
Should I call up for some more personnel
to help track him down?

251
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,240
No, I got a better idea. Rodney?

252
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:13,351
<i>Are the ship's schematics loaded
into the life-signs detector?</i>

253
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:16,587
- I did it when we first got here. Why?
- Well, we're gonna need 'em.

254
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:25,402
- Anything?
- No, it's just us.

255
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,423
Ronon, Teyla, anything on your end?

256
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:29,905
I'm afraid not, Colonel.

257
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:32,020
<i>All right.
Stay in touch.</i>

258
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,355
What the hell is this?

259
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:42,327
It's supposed to be
an open corridor.

260
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,151
- Let me see.
- Here.

261
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:50,402
Rodney?

262
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:53,887
This schematic you gave us
is a piece of crap.

263
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:57,277
- What are you talking about?
<i>- A dead end that's not on the map.</i>

264
00:15:57,402 --> 00:15:58,496
That's impossible!

265
00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:02,026
- Look, I'm staring at it right now.
- Look, I don't know what to tell you.

266
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:04,460
I pulled that schematic directly
from the ship's database.

267
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:06,691
Great.
We have to double back.

268
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:08,812
<i>Colonel Sheppard,
this is Teyla, please respond.</i>

269
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:11,445
- Go ahead.
- <i>We found Lieutenant Williams.</i>

270
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:14,406
I'm afraid he's dead.

271
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,776
- What happened?
- He was attacked.

272
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:21,978
<i>By who?</i>

273
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:24,401
I don't know,

274
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,392
but whatever it was,
it tried to eat him.

275
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:29,694
You mean feed on him?

276
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:33,531
No. I mean eat him.
With teeth, like an animal.

277
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,537
What?

278
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:40,250
All right... Radio back, try to get
somebody to pick up the body.

279
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,831
In the meantime, we're gonna have
to figure out who the hell...

280
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:50,340
Hang on. We got something.

281
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,328
Move back to our position.

282
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:21,168
Sir?

283
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:22,845
In here.

284
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:45,397
Another dead end.

285
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:50,145
Well, this doesn't make any sense.
The signal's right on top of us.

286
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:14,924
Is everybody okay?

287
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,465
- Yeah. I think so.
- What the hell is that?

288
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,226
A Wraith soldier without the mask.

289
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,123
I didn't think
they ever took those things off.

290
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:32,733
No feeding hand, remember?
How else is he gonna eat?

291
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,147
Oh, great. So now we have
to contend with starving Wraith

292
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:43,146
who are just learning
to use their teeth?

293
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:45,208
This is my fault.
I'm the one that took away

294
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,164
the only practical feeding mechanism
they ever knew.

295
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:51,459
All right, look, I admit
that it's a little disturbing,

296
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:54,331
but it's not like they were
man's best friend before.

297
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:56,222
Just a different version
of the same thing.

298
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:58,707
- The question is, how did it get out?
- The power fluctuations.

299
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:00,710
They must be more widespread
than I thought.

300
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:01,550
So?

301
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:04,709
So, there must be
a safety protocol of some kind.

302
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:07,208
When there's an interruption
of the power, the pods shut down

303
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,937
- and release their occupant.
- But you stabilized it.

304
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:12,648
Right? I mean...
All the other pods are fine?

305
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:14,085
They might be.

306
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,669
I'm... I never actually figured out
what was wrong, so...

307
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:19,530
Is there any way to determine if any
of the other pods have been compromised?

308
00:19:19,698 --> 00:19:22,908
Well, I don't know. Maybe.
I suppose we could go down and look.

309
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:25,202
I got a better idea.
Let's get the hell out of here.

310
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,830
Except I haven't finished
sorting through the relevant data.

311
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:30,255
- The IOA...
- The IOA can sue me. Let's go.

312
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:42,957
- What?
- I know this is the way,

313
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,834
because we came by here this morning,
but this looks different.

314
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:47,863
You're probably imagining it.

315
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:50,423
Or not.

316
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:56,391
Where did that wall come from?
It wasn't there.

317
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,272
- How's that possible?
- I don't know!

318
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,520
We need to figure out
another way out of here.

319
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:04,271
Okay... It looks like
if we go back the way we came a bit,

320
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:07,836
we should hook up with another corridor
that loops around the other side.

321
00:20:07,961 --> 00:20:10,138
- Lead the way.
- All right, well...

322
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:18,584
All right, this is it.

323
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:21,737
Through here, about a hundred meters,
and we are there.

324
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:35,750
Oh, my God.

325
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:39,085
- Oh, this... This is not good.
- You're telling me?

326
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,737
The dart bay's on the other side.
This is the only way out of here.

327
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:53,200
You wanna tell me how a giant hole

328
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:55,151
magically appears
in the middle of a ship?

329
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:57,711
- Actually, I have a theory about that.
- You do?

330
00:20:57,885 --> 00:20:59,759
Look, these glitches
we've been experiencing,

331
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,961
they ain't confined to power regulation.
They're in every major system.

332
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:05,438
I wouldn't call 'em "glitches."
This is a major renovation.

333
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:07,188
I know, but think about it.

334
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:09,186
The Wraith ships are basically
organic, right?

335
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,777
I mean, they're capable of
self-regeneration when they're damaged,

336
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,561
but not just the hull.

337
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:16,282
The same systems regulate
internal structure as well,

338
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:19,066
so if those systems are malfunctioning
along with the others...

339
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:22,310
You think the ship
is repairing itself incorrectly?

340
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:25,709
Not repairing
so much as reconfiguring.

341
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:30,061
Look, before he was killed,
Williams said he saw the wall melt.

342
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:33,562
We've experienced it, dead ends
when there's supposed to be corridors.

343
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:37,417
And this reconfiguration has completely
cut us off from the dart bay?

344
00:21:37,748 --> 00:21:40,040
- From what I can tell, yes.
- Get on the line to Atlantis.

345
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,781
Have some Jumpers and combat engineers.
We need to get outta here.

346
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:46,331
Actually, I can't do that,
because the communications systems

347
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:48,053
are now completely offline.

348
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:50,030
- Rodney...
- Look, what do you want me to do?

349
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:52,377
If I knew what causing this,
I could do something about it,

350
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:54,439
but these malfunctions
are showing up everywhere.

351
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:56,519
I mean, they seem to be
entirely random!

352
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:59,418
- So we're stuck here?
- For the time being, yes.

353
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:02,164
I do have an idea.

354
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:05,946
- We revive Todd.
- What?

355
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:09,324
He knows about this ship. Maybe he can
help me figure out what's wrong.

356
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:12,369
You do remember the last Wraith
that came out ate one of our marines?

357
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:14,296
He was just a warrior drone.

358
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:16,662
We've long suspected
they spend the majority of their life

359
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:19,432
under the controlling mental
influence of the other Wraith.

360
00:22:19,557 --> 00:22:21,511
It's not surprising
if you remove that influence

361
00:22:21,636 --> 00:22:23,153
they revert to an animal state.

362
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:26,624
- But that shouldn't happen with Todd.
- Yeah, but you're forgetting one thing.

363
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:29,061
I haven't found a cure for the disease
that was killing them.

364
00:22:29,186 --> 00:22:32,805
I mean, we take him out,
and he might not last long.

365
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:35,267
Well, that's the one thing
I like about the plan.

366
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:37,074
Oh, great!

367
00:22:38,181 --> 00:22:41,249
Navigation's acting up. Whatever
we decide, we gotta do it quickly,

368
00:22:41,374 --> 00:22:43,793
because I cannot stay ahead
of these malfunctions for much longer.

369
00:22:49,546 --> 00:22:51,056
You sure about this?

370
00:23:19,128 --> 00:23:20,520
How you feeling?

371
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:23,062
I did not think you would come.

372
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:24,566
What are friends for?

373
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:27,277
Your ship is malfunctioning.

374
00:23:27,624 --> 00:23:29,029
We need you to fix it.

375
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,249
- You woke me for this?
- That's right.

376
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,061
We've got work to do.

377
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,782
You know, I did...
I tried that already.

378
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,421
Okay, all right. You know what?
You just go ahead.

379
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:49,048
Somebody woke up on the wrong side
of the pod this morning.

380
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:50,624
This makes no sense.

381
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:53,928
- The systems are behaving erratically.
- I've been trying to tell you that!

382
00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:55,935
- What have you done to them?
- Nothing!

383
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,311
They've been acting screwy
since the moment we came on board!

384
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:01,748
Nothing's responding
the way it should.

385
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,301
It's almost as if...

386
00:24:04,631 --> 00:24:05,440
What?

387
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:08,318
No, it's not possible.

388
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:10,070
What's not possible?

389
00:24:10,238 --> 00:24:13,075
I believe I know
why the ship is malfunctioning.

390
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,703
The disease is in the ship?

391
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,438
It is the only explanation
that makes sense.

392
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:23,188
If you say so.

393
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:24,935
How is that even possible?

394
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,309
During the process of hibernation,

395
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:31,040
there is a continuous exchange of fluid
between Wraith and hive.

396
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,027
The disease must have been
transmitted in this manner.

397
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:37,560
Great. So we're flying around
in a giant tumor.

398
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:38,723
With no way off.

399
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:43,109
As time goes on
and the disease progresses,

400
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:46,123
more and more systems
will become affected...

401
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:49,186
Inertial dampeners,
life support, hull integrity...

402
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:50,360
Can we land it?

403
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:56,310
Landing a hive is a tricky proposition
in the best of circumstances.

404
00:24:56,435 --> 00:24:59,284
Under these conditions,
I would not recommend it.

405
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:00,537
So, what do we do?

406
00:25:01,276 --> 00:25:03,248
There is only one thing we can do.

407
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,310
- We must cure this disease.
- Wait a second.

408
00:25:06,545 --> 00:25:08,999
I've barely scratched the surface
on what went wrong here.

409
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:11,313
I mean, it could take months
to analyze the data.

410
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:13,780
At the current level
of the ship's degradation,

411
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:16,511
I estimate we have four days
before it becomes uninhabitable.

412
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:18,805
Well, you better get to work.

413
00:25:25,827 --> 00:25:27,247
How's it going, Rodney?

414
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,310
Aside from the fact
every time I fix something,

415
00:25:29,435 --> 00:25:31,150
something else breaks, fine.

416
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:33,373
So we can expect
more of these power fluctuations?

417
00:25:33,613 --> 00:25:36,905
- Likely. Probably gonna get worse.
- Then we've got a problem.

418
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,659
- The other Wraith.
- We can't afford to let them get out.

419
00:25:39,827 --> 00:25:41,499
Well, I have been able to identify

420
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,748
that safety protocol
I was talking about.

421
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:47,273
I won't be able to override it,
but I'll make a few key alterations.

422
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:49,755
- Yeah? Like what?
- Well, I mean, the simplest thing to do

423
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,341
would be to make it so the pods
don't release the Wraith

424
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:53,753
when they shut down, but...

425
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,341
That would kill them.
Basically suffocate them.

426
00:25:56,748 --> 00:25:58,334
Great. They're Wraith.

427
00:25:58,502 --> 00:26:00,971
Are they? They've taken the treatment,
they no longer feed.

428
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:03,748
- Tell that to Lieutenant Williams.
- What about Todd?

429
00:26:03,873 --> 00:26:06,750
If significant numbers of his crew
are killed, he will demand to know why.

430
00:26:06,938 --> 00:26:09,731
Just another malfunction.
Do it.

431
00:26:10,998 --> 00:26:12,064
All right.

432
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:20,233
You all right?

433
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:22,046
It will pass.

434
00:26:23,547 --> 00:26:24,815
I'm sorry.

435
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:27,206
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

436
00:26:27,493 --> 00:26:30,752
I honestly thought the treatment
would make things better for everyone.

437
00:26:35,356 --> 00:26:36,498
What's funny?

438
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:39,738
I find it amusing,

439
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,875
human apologizing to Wraith.

440
00:26:44,141 --> 00:26:45,686
You don't understand compassion.

441
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:48,197
You just view it
as a sign of weakness.

442
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:49,604
Isn't it?

443
00:26:50,837 --> 00:26:52,565
No, not by a long shot.

444
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,944
I'm not sure Colonel Sheppard
would agree with you.

445
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:00,448
Colonel Sheppard's a soldier.
I'm a Doctor.

446
00:27:00,616 --> 00:27:01,816
Ah, yes.

447
00:27:02,124 --> 00:27:05,237
His job is to take lives,
and yours is to save them.

448
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:07,983
No, his job is also to save lives.

449
00:27:09,432 --> 00:27:11,792
He just has
a different set of tools.

450
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:20,812
All right...

451
00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:24,623
I've created a program
to override the safety protocol.

452
00:27:24,748 --> 00:27:26,522
You sure you want me to do this?

453
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:29,062
- Go ahead.
- All right.

454
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:38,736
What is that?

455
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:42,186
It's one of the hibernation chambers.
It's not accepting the new commands.

456
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:46,035
No, it's no good.
I can't access it from here.

457
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:47,844
How many of them are in there?

458
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:51,582
It's one of the smaller chambers,
so a couple of dozen at the most.

459
00:27:53,498 --> 00:27:56,671
We're gonna have to figure out
another way to deal with these guys.

460
00:28:10,537 --> 00:28:11,561
Colonel...

461
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:23,898
Well, that's not a good sign.
Let's move.

462
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:28,729
Power fluctuations.

463
00:28:29,346 --> 00:28:31,127
More of them could be out.

464
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:38,530
This is what I was afraid of.

465
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,863
<i>We just figured out why you weren't able
to access the last chamber.</i>

466
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,900
What? What is it?

467
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:47,387
We're too late. The pods are opened.

468
00:28:47,838 --> 00:28:49,223
How many got out?

469
00:28:52,484 --> 00:28:53,543
All of them.

470
00:28:56,552 --> 00:28:59,950
Alright, we're gonna split into teams.
Divide each deck into four sections,

471
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:02,701
we're gonna sweep through,
starting from this position.

472
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,229
Don't take any chances.

473
00:29:04,354 --> 00:29:07,050
Shoot anything that moves.
Everyone clear?

474
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,436
All right, let's move out.

475
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:46,253
It says here

476
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:49,818
you attempted to use Iratus DNA

477
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:51,340
in your treatment.

478
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:55,545
I thought using the pure DNA
of an Iratus bug

479
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:59,329
would help prevent the deterioration
of your Wraith abilities.

480
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,269
Got the idea from Michael,
if you can believe that,

481
00:30:02,394 --> 00:30:05,013
but, unfortunately,
it didn't work, so...

482
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:07,952
What is it?

483
00:30:08,386 --> 00:30:10,230
I have an idea.

484
00:30:12,204 --> 00:30:14,891
- <i>Colonel Sheppard, come in, please?</i>
- This is Sheppard.

485
00:30:15,061 --> 00:30:17,953
We need you to come down to the lab.
Todd needs to speak to you.

486
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:20,741
<i>I'm a little busy right now.
Can it wait?</i>

487
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:22,708
Apparently not.

488
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:26,194
Meet up with Teyla and Ramirez
till I get back.

489
00:30:30,142 --> 00:30:33,034
- What's so damn important?
- He says there's a way to fix this.

490
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,224
Fix what?

491
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:36,318
- Cure the disease?
- Not cure it,

492
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:38,067
but undo it.

493
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:40,208
What are you talking about?

494
00:30:40,377 --> 00:30:42,990
As you know, healthy Wraith have
an inherent ability

495
00:30:43,115 --> 00:30:45,885
to heal themselves
of almost any ailment,

496
00:30:46,606 --> 00:30:50,176
but this has not always been the case.
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

497
00:30:50,345 --> 00:30:52,930
there was
a treatment of last resort.

498
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:55,047
All right, spare me
the history lessons.

499
00:30:55,172 --> 00:30:56,770
A terminally ill Wraith

500
00:30:56,895 --> 00:31:00,119
could occasionally restore
himself to perfect health

501
00:31:00,386 --> 00:31:04,206
if he allowed an Iratus "bug",
as you call them,

502
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:07,235
specifically a queen,
to feed on him.

503
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,446
And you're just
bringing this up now?

504
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:12,953
The process was abandoned long ago
because it is dangerous,

505
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:16,759
almost always resulting in the death
of the Wraith in question.

506
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,537
I only...

507
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,272
consider it now because...

508
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:24,430
it would appear that we are...

509
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:26,546
beyond hope.

510
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:31,222
Now, there is a planet

511
00:31:31,688 --> 00:31:34,679
less than three days' journey
where we will find what we need.

512
00:31:34,848 --> 00:31:38,100
We can barely keep this thing in orbit,
and you want to take it into hyperspace?

513
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,977
I can manage it.

514
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:43,104
Well, forget about it. We're gonna
come up with a solution right here.

515
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:46,729
- This is the only way to save my crew.
- Well, we're not leaving.

516
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,111
At least do me the courtesy
of being honest.

517
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:57,382
This is not about not you
not wanting

518
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,606
to risk a jump to hyperspace
on a damaged ship.

519
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:04,293
You do not want me to go
because I'll be restoring the lives

520
00:32:04,418 --> 00:32:07,112
of hundreds of unhealthy Wraith,
including myself.

521
00:32:07,237 --> 00:32:09,172
I got to admit,
that did cross my mind.

522
00:32:09,684 --> 00:32:11,956
This disease is your responsibility.

523
00:32:13,177 --> 00:32:16,489
If I had not agreed
to meet with you to discuss this...

524
00:32:16,614 --> 00:32:18,453
innovation of yours,

525
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,394
my crew and I would not be
in this predicament!

526
00:32:23,226 --> 00:32:25,929
Well, I might be feeling
a little more charitable

527
00:32:26,054 --> 00:32:28,233
if you hadn't tried to kill
half my people

528
00:32:28,358 --> 00:32:31,027
last time we decided
to trust each other!

529
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:49,442
You owe me this, Sheppard.

530
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,887
I don't owe you anything.

531
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:55,867
Get him out of here.

532
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:09,511
Well, I guess I can't
count on his help anymore.

533
00:33:11,928 --> 00:33:15,112
- What was that?
- <i>Sheppard, you're gonna wanna get up.</i>

534
00:33:15,338 --> 00:33:16,539
Keep working.

535
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,583
What the hell was that?

536
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:29,746
Looks like Todd's estimate of how long
the ship's gonna last is a little off.

537
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:32,528
- What are you talking about?
- Remember that hole? It's growing.

538
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:36,267
It begins to threat the hull integrity,
but that's not the biggest problem.

539
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:37,392
See that?

540
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:40,826
That is a line of structural weakness
right across the width of the hive.

541
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:44,387
If there's an explosive decompression,
this thing could be ripped in half.

542
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:47,436
This is Sheppard, all teams fall back.
Fall back immediately.

543
00:33:48,855 --> 00:33:50,522
We're not finished with the Wraith.

544
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:53,193
Just leave 'em. The hull's failing.
Get the hell out of there.

545
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:55,069
You heard the man. Let's move!

546
00:33:55,488 --> 00:33:56,488
Let's go!

547
00:33:57,908 --> 00:33:59,156
Come on! Hurry up!

548
00:34:14,281 --> 00:34:15,690
Are you all right?

549
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:24,189
Let's get the hell out of here.

550
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:33,204
What is it?

551
00:34:33,953 --> 00:34:35,903
The door's jammed. Won't open.

552
00:34:36,364 --> 00:34:38,891
Rodney, this is Teyla. We are stuck
behind a door that will not open.

553
00:34:39,016 --> 00:34:41,140
- Can you help us?
- The controls are malfunctioning.

554
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:44,481
I can't seem to override them.
Just give me a minute.

555
00:34:45,622 --> 00:34:47,872
We might not have a minute, Rodney.

556
00:35:03,053 --> 00:35:04,053
Crap.

557
00:35:12,595 --> 00:35:15,120
Uh, guys?
You need to get out of there now.

558
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:17,087
You hear me?
Get out of there now!

559
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,232
Sheppard! Come in! Please!

560
00:35:57,501 --> 00:35:59,704
- Yeah, we're here.
- Oh, thank God.

561
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:02,091
- I take it the bulkhead held?
- Yeah, for now.

562
00:36:02,216 --> 00:36:04,322
<i>I was able to seal off</i>
<i>so we won't depressurize,</i>

563
00:36:04,492 --> 00:36:06,511
but you need to get down here...

564
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:11,873
What now?

565
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:14,673
The ship tearing itself apart
shifted our trajectory.

566
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,215
We're headed
straight for the planet!

567
00:36:28,368 --> 00:36:29,628
What's our status?

568
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:32,184
I would say "screwed"
is an apt description.

569
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:34,680
- Are we going to burn up?
- No, we're gonna survive re-entry.

570
00:36:34,805 --> 00:36:37,583
In fact, it'll slow us down a little,
but nowhere near enough.

571
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:40,125
- Can you get us over the water?
- Land, water, at that speed

572
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,887
- we're going to be vaporized on impact.
- We've got to do something.

573
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:44,284
- Like what?
- Think!

574
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:46,368
I don't know... Okay, right.

575
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:49,304
Forward maneuvering thrusters.
But they're not getting any power

576
00:36:49,502 --> 00:36:52,087
because the propulsion conduits
have been ripped in half.

577
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:55,425
I may be able to reroute power to them
so they can slow our descent.

578
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:58,380
- All right, now you're talking.
- I haven't a clue how to do it!

579
00:36:58,505 --> 00:37:00,331
Even if the systems were functioning,

580
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:02,673
it would take me hours
to create that kind of work-around.

581
00:37:02,798 --> 00:37:04,482
All right, just keep working on it.

582
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:07,371
- Where the hell are you going?
- I'm gonna go get some help.

583
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:13,858
- Get up.
- You can't quite leave me be.

584
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,470
I don't have time to play games.

585
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:18,698
- You know what that shaking is?
- Oh, I can guess.

586
00:37:19,418 --> 00:37:21,876
We've lost orbit.
We're entering the atmosphere,

587
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:24,408
which means in a few minutes,
we're gonna slam into that planet.

588
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,971
A quick death
will be a welcome reprieve.

589
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,620
I didn't think
you were such a quitter.

590
00:37:30,476 --> 00:37:33,657
Look, you get this ship on the ground,
I'll take you to your bug planet.

591
00:37:33,782 --> 00:37:36,029
And you expect me to believe that?

592
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:37,810
My word.

593
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:43,172
And my crew?

594
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,354
They're dead.

595
00:37:48,303 --> 00:37:50,470
The ship sheared in two.
We lost the entire rear section.

596
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,104
If we'd gone to the planet,
none of this would have happened!

597
00:37:54,229 --> 00:37:56,286
We would have never made it there,
you know it.

598
00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:57,644
The hull was too damaged.

599
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,106
Now, I understand
you're pissed off about your crew,

600
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:05,479
but we're about to join 'em
unless somebody manages to slow us down,

601
00:38:05,604 --> 00:38:07,730
so are you gonna help us out?

602
00:38:11,244 --> 00:38:12,528
We're in the atmosphere.

603
00:38:12,653 --> 00:38:14,302
Altitude 100,000 feet.

604
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:16,996
It is no use.
I cannot control it.

605
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,166
Move aside!

606
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:25,088
- You sure about this?
- What can he do? We're in a free fall.

607
00:38:25,258 --> 00:38:28,710
I believe I can successfully create
a bypass that will deliver power

608
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:31,048
to the forward thrusters,
but it will take a few moments.

609
00:38:31,173 --> 00:38:33,429
- You just take your time.
- Impact in 15 seconds.

610
00:38:34,025 --> 00:38:36,099
Not if I can help it.
Firing thrusters!

611
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,237
40,000 feet.
Still descending too fast.

612
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:50,409
- It's not enough!
- Instead of criticizing,

613
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:52,979
perhaps you could work
at getting me some more power!

614
00:38:53,104 --> 00:38:54,104
I'm on it!

615
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:56,203
20,000 feet.

616
00:38:56,371 --> 00:38:58,288
Angle the thrusters.
Try to get the ship level.

617
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,039
We can fly her across the water.

618
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:01,874
Trust me.
I've done this before.

619
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,337
- 10,000 feet.
- That's it.

620
00:39:05,505 --> 00:39:07,606
That's all the power we've got.

621
00:39:20,563 --> 00:39:21,849
2,000 feet!

622
00:39:22,952 --> 00:39:25,890
This is it! We're about to lose
inertial dampeners!

623
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:57,776
They just hit the water.
I've got the coordinates.

624
00:39:58,098 --> 00:40:00,753
Relay them to the rescue
Jumpers immediately.

625
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:13,613
Colonel.
Good to see you back on your feet.

626
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:16,640
- How's the rest of your team?
- You know, recovering.

627
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,971
We took quite a jolt
when we hit the water.

628
00:40:19,096 --> 00:40:20,330
I can imagine.

629
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:21,954
You were lucky.

630
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:23,438
By the time Major Kersey

631
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:25,625
was able to blast his way
down to your position,

632
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:28,461
the hive, what remained of it,
was already half full of water.

633
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:30,671
It sank minutes
after they extracted you.

634
00:40:31,634 --> 00:40:33,625
Wish I was awake to see that.

635
00:40:36,721 --> 00:40:38,513
- How is he?
- Not well.

636
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:40,973
He hasn't responded
to any treatment.

637
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:45,741
I received your request.

638
00:40:47,254 --> 00:40:48,267
And?

639
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:50,420
Forgive me if I'm wrong,

640
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,412
but weren't you the one
who wanted to destroy his ship?

641
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,697
Sounds vaguely familiar.

642
00:40:56,973 --> 00:40:59,951
And now you want me
to go against protocol and let him go.

643
00:41:00,132 --> 00:41:02,996
- Well, he is the reason we're alive.
- I realize that, Colonel.

644
00:41:03,164 --> 00:41:05,248
He's also the reason
you were in danger,

645
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:08,157
not to mention
an incredible security risk.

646
00:41:08,282 --> 00:41:11,128
All right, look,
he's probably gonna die anyway.

647
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:14,632
- And if he survives?
- He's gonna remember what we did.

648
00:41:15,158 --> 00:41:18,344
Like it or not, he's our best ally
in the fight against the Wraith.

649
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:21,764
If we ever get around
to perfecting this gene therapy,

650
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:24,598
we're gonna need his help
to deploy it.

651
00:41:25,813 --> 00:41:28,938
You realize this is the kind of decision
that could cost me my job.

652
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,066
Well, aren't they all?

653
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:48,822
I appreciate
your decision to let me go.

654
00:41:50,447 --> 00:41:51,697
A deal's a deal.

655
00:41:52,812 --> 00:41:55,423
I will remember this, John Sheppard.
