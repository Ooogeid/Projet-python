1
00:00:00,697 --> 00:00:02,954
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,587
Who are you?

3
00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:06,426
Nabel Golan.

4
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:09,086
You're the one responsible
for the death of the Athosians.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,846
Unless I lied about that as well.

6
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:13,473
<i>I believe I had a vision last night.</i>

7
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:14,808
<i>I saw Kanaan,</i>

8
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,392
<i>the father of my son.</i>

9
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:18,639
- Where are you?
- Dart!

10
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:24,526
<i>Do not destroy the enemy ship.
Teyla may be on board.</i>

11
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:25,819
Bad news, Sheppard.

12
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:29,531
<i>The cruiser made the jump
to hyperspace. It's gone.</i>

13
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:33,063
Kanaan...

14
00:00:33,578 --> 00:00:35,936
I came for you, just like you asked.

15
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:37,158
Like I asked.

16
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:40,418
Michael.

17
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:44,130
- Any sign of her, Sir?
- She's not here.

18
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:49,169
Finally. It's about bloody time.
What took you so long?

19
00:01:02,885 --> 00:01:04,085
It's just weird.

20
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,804
I'm sorry about all this, Doctor.

21
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:25,440
All right. I realize there's
a protocol when dealing with someone

22
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:27,495
who's been a prisoner for a long time.

23
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:29,018
In fact, I wrote it.

24
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:33,135
Although, if you take much more blood,
I think I might faint.

25
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:34,765
That's the last batch.

26
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:37,862
You should also check
for trace narcotics.

27
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:40,679
Michael was giving me regular injections
of some sort of drug cocktail

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,440
- mostly sedatives, I think.
- All right.

29
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:50,778
You sure he's not a Replicator?

30
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:52,722
No, scans would have
picked it up right away.

31
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:54,584
- Then who the hell is he?
- I don't know.

32
00:01:54,704 --> 00:01:56,947
I'm as freaked out
about this as you are.

33
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:58,716
You don't really think it's him.

34
00:01:58,846 --> 00:02:00,663
No. Well, I mean... maybe.

35
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,941
We've ruled out advanced robotics.

36
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:06,520
That still leaves us half a dozen
possible other explanations.

37
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:07,626
Like?

38
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:10,340
Well, like alternate timeline,
parallel universe, cloning,

39
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,175
- you know, take your pick.
- Just another day in outer space.

40
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:14,139
Yeah.

41
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:19,612
Well...

42
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:22,492
we've completed the preliminary exam.

43
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:23,554
And?

44
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:26,633
Every test we've run confirms it.

45
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:31,070
That man down there
is Dr. Carson beckett.

54
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:45,224
- Rodney.
- Carson.

55
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,279
So sorry I haven't come by before now.
It's been pretty hectic here

56
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:50,723
- the last few days.
- That's all right. I understand.

57
00:03:50,873 --> 00:03:52,655
Any word on when I can get out of here?

58
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:55,363
That might take a little time.

59
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:57,295
Really?

60
00:03:58,432 --> 00:03:59,906
God, it's good to see you.

61
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:01,393
Think about how I feel.

62
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:04,462
I'm the one that's been a prisoner
for almost two years.

63
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:06,758
Two years?

64
00:04:07,258 --> 00:04:09,761
Aye. Since M8G-352.

65
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:13,098
The planet where we left Michael
and the other converted Wraith.

66
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:15,075
- Right.
- That's where you were captured.

67
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:16,727
Well, yes.

68
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:19,783
You do remember, Rodney?
- Yes. Yeah, I just...

69
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,723
Well, we need you to fill in
some of the details.

70
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:23,975
Well, all right.

71
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:27,160
Well, as you may have already guessed,

72
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:29,527
the treatment was less
than 100% effective.

73
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:33,772
<i>Despite the daily injections,
some of them began to revert,</i>

74
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,250
<i>including Michael.</i>

75
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:39,489
<i>They may have used
their telepathic abilities</i>

76
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:42,276
<i>to summon a hive ship,
but I can't be certain.</i>

77
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:45,049
<i>All I know is I was being
interrogated by Michael,</i>

78
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:47,418
<i>then he must have given me
an injection of some kind,</i>

79
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,324
because the next thing I remember,
I woke up on another planet.

80
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:51,858
Why did he take you prisoner?

81
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:54,508
He wanted me to help with his research,

82
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,215
combining Wraith and human DNA.

83
00:04:57,502 --> 00:04:59,308
Of course, I refused at first,

84
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:01,877
but then, one day,

85
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,555
he brought another
prisoner into my cell.

86
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,263
A young lady.

87
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,499
Couldn't have been
more than 20 years of age.

88
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:14,814
And he killed her in cold blood
right in front of my eyes.

89
00:05:15,518 --> 00:05:20,197
He said every day I refused to help,
he'd kill another just like her.

90
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:22,274
From that moment on, I cooperated.

91
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:27,061
Carson, I'm so sorry.

92
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,330
It wasn't easy.

93
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:32,041
I'll admit, at times,
I almost gave up hope.

94
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,850
But that's when I thought about you,
Colonel Sheppard, Teyla,

95
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,836
and the rest of the team.

96
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:40,565
I knew you'd be out there
somewhere looking for me.

97
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:43,497
Yeah.

98
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:46,348
See, the thing is, we weren't.

99
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:48,524
- Weren't what?
- We weren't looking for you.

100
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:50,520
- We didn't know you were missing.
- Excuse me?

101
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:55,274
We went back to M8G-352.
We rescued you from Michael.

102
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:58,580
He got away, but we got you back
to Atlantis safe and sound.

103
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,231
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Obviously, not you, but another you,

104
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:04,282
another Carson Beckett.

105
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:06,659
Is this a joke?

106
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:08,368
I wish it was.

107
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,478
You're telling me there's another
Carson Beckett walking around this base?

108
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,315
- Well, no.
- Rodney!

109
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:18,477
He came back from the planet.
He resumed his duties.

110
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:20,587
Everything went back to normal.

111
00:06:22,635 --> 00:06:24,366
And then about six months later,

112
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:27,511
he was killed in an explosion.

113
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:31,922
To us, you weren't missing, Carson,

114
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:33,839
you were dead.

115
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:41,940
Have you spoken to your Wraith contact?

116
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,596
He claims he's given us everything
he knows about Michael, but

117
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:45,789
I assume he's lying.

118
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,699
Until we can come up with something that
he can use, he's not much good to us.

119
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,664
So we need to find
our intel somewhere else.

120
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:54,200
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

121
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:56,395
You mean Beckett.

122
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:59,705
He has been inside Michael's operation
and he may know something.

123
00:06:59,825 --> 00:07:02,400
Or he could have been
planted there for us to find.

124
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,745
For all we know, this whole thing
could be a set-up.

125
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:06,667
Sure, anything's possible.

126
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:10,215
John, the Carson Beckett
you knew was killed.

127
00:07:10,784 --> 00:07:12,789
You were there.
You all were.

128
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,164
I'm sorry to say it,
but you need to remember that.

129
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:20,035
I know this is a lot
for you to take in...

130
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:21,785
Aye, you're damn right it is.

131
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:23,895
First, you tell me
I'm not the only Carson Beckett,

132
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:27,700
and then you tell me the other one
died in a horrible explosion.

133
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,960
Oh, my God.

134
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,037
My mother!
You didn't tell her, did you?

135
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:33,081
Well, yeah.

136
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:34,245
Good Lord.

137
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,583
You were dead.

138
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:37,355
I'm sorry, but we buried you.

139
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:39,212
There was a memorial service.


140
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:40,713
This can't be happening.

141
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:42,725
- I have to talk to her.
- You can't.

142
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:45,426
What kind of effect that could have?
What do you have to say to her?

143
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:47,595
I'll say the Air Force
made a bloody mistake!

144
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:49,514
- Carson...
- This is too much.

145
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:51,641
Get Dr. Weir in here.
I need to speak to her.

146
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:56,043
What?

147
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:59,148
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

148
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:01,776
She's dead, Carson.

149
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,869
She was killed by the Replicators.

150
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:09,131
Sacrificed herself
to save the rest of us.

151
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:13,564
I'm sorry, I...

152
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:17,164
I don't know what else to say.

153
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:20,711
<i>You know,
for the better part of two years</i>

154
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:25,525
I imagined what it would be like
the day I finally got back to Atlantis.

155
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:31,399
This isn't exactly
how I pictured it.

156
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:43,387
What is this place?

157
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,012
Just another dead world.

158
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:49,632
Destroyed by the Wraith,
abandoned by the survivors,

159
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:51,764
forgotten by both.

160
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:55,323
A perfect place to conduct my work.

161
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:00,478
Open it.

162
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,830
I'll leave you to get
re-acquainted.

163
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:28,562
<i>Halling?</i>

164
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:41,537
What have you got for me, Doctor?

165
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:43,988
I think I've solved the mystery.

166
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:46,515
You know what
a telomere is, Colonel?

167
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:48,385
It's part of
a human chromosome, right?

168
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,008
Yeah, that's right.

169
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:54,485
Each time a cell divides, the chromosome
is torn apart and rebuilt,

170
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:57,705
and in the process, a small amount
of the telomere gets used up.

171
00:09:57,825 --> 00:10:00,825
As a result,
telomeres become shorter over time.

172
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:03,151
The more we age,
the shorter they get.

173
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:05,146
And this is Dr. Beckett's?

174
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:06,518
Yeah.

175
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:08,829
<i>According to the scan,</i>

176
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:11,544
his telomeres are 30% shorter

177
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:14,396
than they should be
for a man of his age.

178
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:16,645
The only explanation
is that the original DNA

179
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:18,120
came from an adult cell.

180
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:21,645
One where the telomeres
had already started to degrade.

181
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:24,566
- So...
- You can forget parallel universes.

182
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:26,921
He's a clone.

183
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:33,185
I did not ever think
I would see you again.

184
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:34,403
Nor did we.

185
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:38,086
I just wish it were under
happier circumstances.

186
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:42,770
Where are the rest of our people?

187
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:44,777
They were taken.

188
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:48,036
- Taken?
- To be experimented upon,

189
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,279
converted into one of those...
Those things.

190
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:53,595
How long has this been going on?

191
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:55,616
For months.
Since the day of our arrival.

192
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:57,706
Kanaan was one of the first.

193
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:58,869
<i>I know.</i>

194
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,979
I saw him on Michael's ship,

195
00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:05,258
but I did not realize
it had happened to so many.

196
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:07,255
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

197
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:10,285
<i>I should have been at the village
the day you were captured.</i>

198
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:12,546
There was nothing
you could have done.

199
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,429
50 men armed with stunners infiltrated
our village under the cover of night.

200
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:19,045
We were taken
completely by surprise.

201
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:21,905
These four walls have been
our prison ever since.

202
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:24,221
<i>You must not abandon hope.</i>

203
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:27,576
The people of Atlantis
know of my disappearance

204
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:29,597
and they are looking for me.

205
00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:31,944
It will not be long
before they come to our rescue.

206
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,600
That is a very pleasant thought.

207
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:38,492
But until today, we held out
the same hope about you.

208
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:49,571
I knew you would want
to see the results for yourself.

209
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:53,714
And you're certain
it's from my sample?

210
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:55,938
<i>I ran the test myself, twice.</i>

211
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:58,795
<i>There's no mistake.</i>

212
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:02,042
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:05,406
It doesn't matter.

214
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,065
That's easy for you to say,

215
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,455
but you're not the one
who was made in a test-tube.

216
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,485
One of the best friends I ever had
just came back from the dead.

217
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:14,685
I'm not gonna quibble
over a couple of telomeres.

218
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:16,555
Thank you,
but it doesn't change the fact

219
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:18,933
that I'm not
the real Carson Beckett.

220
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:21,846
No you're not, because the real one
wouldn't feeling sorry for himself.

221
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:24,544
- He'd figure out how to help us.
- I'm willing to do whatever I can,

222
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:26,965
but I'm not so sure
that my help will be wanted.

223
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:28,334
Why wouldn't it be?

224
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:36,786
We're talking about someone who was,
for all intents and purposes,

225
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:39,315
manufactured by one of
the most dangerous individuals

226
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:40,715
we've ever come across.

227
00:12:40,835 --> 00:12:43,075
Fundamentally, he's not
that different from those hybrids,

228
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,795
and I doubt very much we'd be arguing
about whether we can trust them.

229
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:48,416
But there's no denying the fact
that he's no ordinary clone.

230
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:52,149
Michael has managed to reproduce
his memories, his thought processes,

231
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:54,193
<i>and even his personality.</i>

232
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:56,904
I've spent some time with him,
and I'm telling you, he's Carson.

233
00:12:57,064 --> 00:13:01,064
It doesn't mean it's safe to act
on any information he might give us.

234
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:04,225
Look, he may genuinely believe
that he's helping us

235
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:06,454
and still be playing
right into michael's hand.

236
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:07,915
<i>She's got a point, Rodney.</i>

237
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:09,583
What exactly is he offering?

238
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:13,016
He knows the layouts of at least
four facilities that Michael has.

239
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:14,714
He likes to move around a lot,

240
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:17,383
<i>- stay one step ahead of the Wraith.</i>
- What about Gate addresses?

241
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:20,285
They blindfolded him every time they
moved him, so he couldn't see the DHD.

242
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:23,389
Although, he did catch an address
dialed by one of Michael's mercenaries.

243
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:25,891
<i>That could be a place to start.</i>

244
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,148
Go ahead, Rodney.
I'll catch up.

245
00:13:43,845 --> 00:13:45,805
Is he ever going to say
a word to me?

246
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,515
You gotta give him a break. He's not
good dealing with this sort of thing.

247
00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:52,675
- What sort of thing?
- You know, clones, duplicates,

248
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:54,985
people coming back from the dead.

249
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:56,905
We went through this with Elizabeth.

250
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:59,055
Rodney told me.
It must have been difficult.

251
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:01,074
- He'll come around.
- Aye.

252
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:10,624
Thank you.
I must be a wee bit rusty.

253
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:13,328
You're not rusty, Doc.
You were just never very good at this.

254
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:14,547
Fair enough.

255
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:18,238
I just want to say,

256
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:20,649
thank you. For trusting me.

257
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:23,296
You'll have no regrets.

258
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:24,843
Doc?

259
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:25,818
<i>Aye?</i>

260
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,531
Forgot your radio.

261
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:28,700
No regrets.

262
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,098
Just in time for happy hour.

263
00:14:57,974 --> 00:15:01,862
I was hoping maybe you could help us.
We're looking for a friend of ours

264
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:04,354
who's been known
to stop in now and then.

265
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,915
You've come to the wrong place.

266
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:09,912
We haven't even told you
what he looks like.

267
00:15:10,072 --> 00:15:11,362
You misunderstand me.

268
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,434
No one here cares what he looks like.

269
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:18,379
You've come to the wrong place
if you're looking for information.

270
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:20,315
Look.

271
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,749
I know you're trying to keep up
appearances here for your friends, but

272
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:27,120
I think we can make it worth your while.

273
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,139
I think it would be best

274
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,827
<i>if you turn around and be on your way.</i>

275
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,485
That's P-90 fire!

276
00:16:03,077 --> 00:16:03,924
Is he dead?

277
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,803
No, but we need to get back
to Atlantis as soon as possible.

278
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:16,347
What is it?

279
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:19,690
Colonel Sheppard's team's coming back.
They've got injuries.

280
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:24,714
<i>What happened?</i>

281
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,614
This guy took a shot at us with a P-90.

282
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:29,429
We're okay, but,

283
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:31,925
you know, he took a little
header off the balcony.

284
00:16:32,045 --> 00:16:34,437
- A P-90? Where'd he get it?
- That's the question.

285
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:35,873
<i>On 3. 1, 2, 3, up.</i>

286
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:41,128
GSC 6, respiration 16, pulse 150,
blood pressure 70 over 50.

287
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,349
I applied pressure
bandages at the scene.

288
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:45,080
What is it?

289
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:47,092
I know this man.

290
00:16:48,511 --> 00:16:52,123
His name's Nabel. When Teyla and
I went to New Athos, he was there.

291
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:53,746
He tried to kill us.

292
00:16:53,954 --> 00:16:56,486
That's all right, love. He's unconscious
now, and, for the time being,

293
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:58,938
in desperate need of our attention.
You can confront him later.

294
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:01,834
Right now we need to save his life.
Let's go, lads.

295
00:17:08,816 --> 00:17:09,782
Blood pressure?

296
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:11,075
50 over 40.

297
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:14,286
It's dropping. We need to stop
this bleeding. I need suction.

298
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:15,871
Let's prep for a C-spine X-ray.

299
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,668
- What can I do?
- Grab some clamps and get busy.

300
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:21,621
Right.

301
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,350
I'm guessing some pretty
severe lacerations...

302
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:29,299
Get him to a bed, now!

303
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:40,062
It was Dr. Beckett's idea to go there.

304
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:42,946
If we hadn't have gone, we wouldn't have
captured one of Michael's operatives.

305
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:45,601
You also wouldn't have been
nearly killed in an ambush.

306
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:47,152
<i>It wasn't that bad.</i>

307
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,487
It was one guy.

308
00:17:48,686 --> 00:17:51,036
Firing at you with one
of our own weapons.

309
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:53,192
He was Michael's spy
in the Athosian village.

310
00:17:53,312 --> 00:17:55,367
He got the P-90 from
the weapons cache we left there.

311
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:58,330
It doesn't change the fact
that you were led into an ambush,

312
00:17:58,491 --> 00:17:59,794
<i>intentionally or not.</i>

313
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:02,012
<i>Colonel Carter, this is Dr. Keller.</i>

314
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:05,499
<i>You'd better come down to the infirmary.
There's a problem with Dr. Beckett.</i>

315
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:11,288
After he collapsed, I did a scan
and found evidence of necrosis

316
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:13,608
in several of his internal organs.

317
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:17,203
His cells aren't renewing fast enough
to sustain tissue function.

318
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:18,591
Any idea why?

319
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:21,937
I can only assume it's a complication
due to the fact he's a clone.

320
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,691
<i>I've given him a course of treatment
to try to stimulate cell growth,</i>

321
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:29,111
but it's a bit like trying
to find a cure for old age.

322
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:30,635
What are you saying?

323
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:35,993
On the outside, he looks fine,
but on the inside,

324
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:38,152
well, he's...

325
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:39,663
he's dying.

326
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:47,879
My Lord.

327
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:51,832
No wonder I've felt like
a dog's breakfast ever since I got here.

328
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,235
I'm sorry, Carson. I wish
there was something we could do.

329
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:57,434
Why is this happening now?

330
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,703
What do you mean?

331
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:01,343
You survived for almost
two years with Michael.

332
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:05,073
Shouldn't you have felt some kind of
effects from this condition before now?

333
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:06,694
That's a good point.

334
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:11,151
Don't take this the wrong way, but at
the rate your cells are deteriorating,

335
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:13,625
you should have died a long time ago.

336
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:19,119
The weekly injection he gave me.

337
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:22,873
He said it was a sedative meant
to keep me from trying to escape,

338
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:26,418
<i>but it must have been some kind of drug
to keep my cells from deteriorating.</i>

339
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:28,420
You obviously don't have
any of it with you.

340
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,730
No. Michael administered it himself,
one dose at a time,

341
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,935
but when Colonel Sheppard's team
rescued me,

342
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:36,449
it had only been four days
since my last injection.

343
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,764
Assuming it takes a full
seven days to break down...

344
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:40,532
We scanned you when you got here.

345
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:41,559
Exactly.

346
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:44,547
And if the scanner was able to pick it
up, we might be able to isolate it

347
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,692
and create more.
We need to get started right now.

348
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,947
- Where do you think you're doing?
- We have work to do.

349
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,532
No, I have work to do.

350
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:53,217
You need to stay in bed.
The less you exert yourself, the better.

351
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:55,473
You don't seriously expect me
to lie here and be useless

352
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:57,838
when my own life hangs
in the balance, do you?

353
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,555
Kanaan, look at me.

354
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,694
You know who I am.

355
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:26,598
I do not know
what Michael has done to you,

356
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:30,815
but I do know that, deep down,

357
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,610
a part of you is still
the man I remember.

358
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,837
I need your help.

359
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,832
We need your help.

360
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:45,164
If we do not find a way
out of here quickly,

361
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:47,889
Michael will force on us

362
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,345
what he has forced on you.

363
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:54,717
Our child will be born soon,

364
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:56,761
and when he is,

365
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:00,675
Michael will take him to use
for some terrible purpose.

366
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:04,619
You must not let that happen.

367
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:09,893
Kanaan, wait!

368
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:15,551
I'm going cross-eyed.

369
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:18,160
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
We must be missing something.

370
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,571
We've been over everything twice.
Maybe the drug breaks down

371
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:22,874
- faster than we thought.
- Wait a minute.

372
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:24,297
What?

373
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:26,333
Unidentified polypeptide chain.

374
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:29,037
The scan found it
in one of your kidney cells.

375
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,766
Try screening it
for traces of Wraith DNA.

376
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:38,926
My God.

377
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,468
Must be a Wraith enzyme of some sort.

378
00:21:45,356 --> 00:21:46,915
<i>But it's enormously complex.</i>

379
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:49,019
It's not gonna be easy to duplicate.

380
00:21:51,106 --> 00:21:52,213
Right, then.

381
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,156
Do not incite them!

382
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:05,181
- Her.
- No. You will take me instead.

383
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:08,287
<i>Halling!</i>

384
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:15,765
No!

385
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:17,471
No!

386
00:22:18,721 --> 00:22:19,423
No!

387
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:26,431
Just let me know when you have
test results on those. Thanks.

388
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,220
Damn it.

389
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:32,994
- What is it?
- See for yourself.

390
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,252
The primer's not annealing
to the DNA template.

391
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:46,672
There's too many contaminants.
We're back to square one.

392
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,482
I'm sorry, Carson, but...

393
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,842
we've only been at this
for a little while.

394
00:22:50,962 --> 00:22:53,077
You knew it wasn't gonna be easy.

395
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:56,128
I was hoping for
a breakthrough by now.

396
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,083
Carson?

397
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,484
It's all right. I'm okay.

398
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:03,039
No, you're not.
Your condition's getting worse.

399
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:06,039
I'll be fine.
It was just a wee bit of a dizzy spell.

400
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,390
Now, get me some
of those PCR tubes, will you?

401
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:09,785
Please.

402
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,664
You can't just ignore this.

403
00:23:11,845 --> 00:23:13,270
What else can I do?

404
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,940
We could halt the deterioration
of your cells in a stasis pod.

405
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,719
- Don't put me in one of those things.
- But it makes sense.

406
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,487
- When I figure out how to fix this...
- What if you can't?

407
00:23:22,782 --> 00:23:25,114
I'll be stuck in that bloody machine
for God knows how long.

408
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:27,869
Isn't that better
than trying in vain to solve this

409
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,183
while the clock's ticking away
on your own life?

410
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,720
No.

411
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:02,535
Michael?

412
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:04,935
Is that you?

413
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:14,182
Kanaan.

414
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:18,835
Quickly.

415
00:24:19,171 --> 00:24:20,698
You must release me.

416
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:25,111
Michael will be here soon.

417
00:24:26,357 --> 00:24:29,930
He will do to me
what he has done to you. Please.

418
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:34,577
I can help you escape.

419
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:37,187
All of you.

420
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:43,360
Teyla?

421
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:44,290
Yes.

422
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,829
It's me.

423
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:09,683
Yes,

424
00:25:09,957 --> 00:25:11,002
that's it.

425
00:25:16,021 --> 00:25:16,911
Kanaan,

426
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:18,285
what is it?

427
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,575
Leave us.

428
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:44,041
Now...

429
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:46,498
let's get started.

430
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:05,346
I see you've once again
opted to save my life.

431
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:08,049
It wasn't an easy decision,
let me tell you.

432
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:11,573
The only reason she did it
is because we need information.

433
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:13,052
About Michael.

434
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,258
Yes, I know.

435
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:18,872
Too bad you wasted your effort.

436
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,953
You should have just let me die.

437
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:23,579
Why's that?

438
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:26,545
Because once Michael finds out
I was captured,

439
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:28,505
I'm as good as dead anyway.

440
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:29,916
Yeah, well, maybe.

441
00:26:30,204 --> 00:26:32,469
Or maybe not,
if you help us find him.

442
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:34,424
He has spies everywhere.

443
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:38,391
There's nowhere in this galaxy
he can't find me.

444
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:40,936
Who said anything about this galaxy?

445
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:47,655
I had to modify this technology
for use with humans.

446
00:26:51,065 --> 00:26:52,183
It's crude,

447
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:55,304
but it works remarkably well.

448
00:26:57,189 --> 00:26:58,189
Michael...

449
00:26:59,063 --> 00:27:02,176
Whatever has happened between us
in the past,

450
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:04,852
I beg you,

451
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:09,047
do not harm my child.

452
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:12,759
I wouldn't dream of it.

453
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:16,485
Now, just relax.

454
00:27:17,614 --> 00:27:19,123
This won't hurt a bit.

455
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:22,519
Listen.

456
00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:31,285
<i>Your child is healthy.</i>

457
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:34,565
Look.

458
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:43,083
Why are you doing this?

459
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:50,277
<i>On the ship,</i>

460
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:53,025
<i>Kanaan said</i>

461
00:27:53,145 --> 00:27:56,851
our son would serve the cause.

462
00:27:58,064 --> 00:27:59,812
What did he mean by that?

463
00:28:00,536 --> 00:28:01,961
You have the gift.

464
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,024
<i>So does Kanaan.</i>

465
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:08,690
Have you stopped to think
what that might mean for your son?

466
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,721
He is genetically unique.

467
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:15,967
And while I've made a lot
of progress with my hybrids,

468
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:18,899
there are still some details
that need to be worked out.

469
00:28:20,477 --> 00:28:21,645
This child...

470
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:23,496
will help me do that.

471
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:32,496
You've taken good care of him.
You should be very proud.

472
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:36,200
Even so...

473
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:44,726
He could probably use a little help.

474
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,475
Michael, what are you doing?

475
00:28:49,013 --> 00:28:49,940
Please...

476
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:51,798
I need this child.

477
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,989
I can't afford to let anything...

478
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,488
happen to him.

479
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:10,638
How'd it go?

480
00:29:10,758 --> 00:29:13,517
Nabel gave up the address.
We know where she is.

481
00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:17,568
It's one of Michael's bigger facilities.

482
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:21,520
The lab is in the center of the main
building, but it's difficult to find,

483
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,875
not to mention the fact that, if he is
there, he'll be heavily guarded.

484
00:29:25,126 --> 00:29:27,560
- Great.
- You're sure this is the right place?

485
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:29,989
I definitely recognize
the description Nabel gave.

486
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:31,913
Trust me, this is the place.

487
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,216
You should bring me with you.

488
00:29:36,246 --> 00:29:38,389
This is just a small part
of the complex.

489
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:41,616
The place is like a maze, and once
 inside, it's easy to get turned around.

490
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:45,245
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

491
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:53,127
So, what do you think?

492
00:29:53,288 --> 00:29:55,115
Well, if he's leading us into a trap,

493
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:57,805
it's not gonna make much difference
whether he's there or not.

494
00:29:57,925 --> 00:30:00,447
But if he isn't,
he could be pretty useful.

495
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:01,970
<i>Wait a second.</i>

496
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,769
If he goes on this mission, it could
kill him. We can't ask him to do this.

497
00:30:04,889 --> 00:30:07,146
- We didn't ask him. He volunteered.
- Oh, gimme a break.

498
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:09,442
- Easy, Rodney.
- I'm sorry, i'm just a little concerned

499
00:30:09,562 --> 00:30:11,154
we're so cavalier with his life


500
00:30:11,274 --> 00:30:13,579
because we think of him
as some kind of a cheap copy.

501
00:30:13,699 --> 00:30:14,961
<i>He's doing it for Teyla.</i>

502
00:30:15,143 --> 00:30:16,152
Don't stand there

503
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:19,727
and pretend that you wouldn't do
the same thing if you were in his place.

504
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:31,993
It's okay. I'm all right.
Thank you. Okay.

505
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:33,273
Carson.

506
00:30:33,393 --> 00:30:35,587
Rodney, I was just heading down
to get geared up.

507
00:30:36,174 --> 00:30:38,084
You can barely stand.
You don't have to do this.

508
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:40,252
You said yourself
the real Carson wouldn't sit around

509
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,265
worrying about himself
when he could help.

510
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:44,455
The real Carson also
never listened to my advice.

511
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:46,952
Look, you don't have to prove anything,
certainly not to me.

512
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:48,016
I know that.

513
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:50,977
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
Let's go.

514
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,683
I'm reading a bunch
of life signs up ahead.

515
00:31:16,803 --> 00:31:18,021
Maybe it's the Athosians.

516
00:31:18,141 --> 00:31:20,876
Yeah. Or maybe it's a herd
of those Frankensteins.

517
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:23,368
Doctor?

518
00:31:25,172 --> 00:31:26,839
It's this way, I think.

519
00:31:28,307 --> 00:31:30,521
No, no, I'm certain. It's this way.

520
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:44,798
What is happening?

521
00:31:49,695 --> 00:31:52,336
There is a connection
between us, Michael,

522
00:31:52,456 --> 00:31:53,508
and right now,

523
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:55,586
I can sense your fear.

524
00:31:56,068 --> 00:31:57,677
I wouldn't go that far.

525
00:31:58,214 --> 00:31:59,444
Let's call it...

526
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:00,811
concern.

527
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:09,198
What did you do?

528
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:10,727
<i>I shut them down.</i>

529
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:14,077
You mean you killed them.

530
00:32:14,197 --> 00:32:16,714
I can't afford to leave
any loose ends behind.

531
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,764
Anyway, there's always more
where they came from.

532
00:32:21,585 --> 00:32:22,927
Take her to the ship.

533
00:32:23,047 --> 00:32:24,226
We're leaving.

534
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,725
I'm tired of getting shot at
with our own guns.

535
00:32:55,136 --> 00:32:58,071
I'm not generally fond of it
regardless of the weapon.

536
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,502
Hello?

537
00:33:11,136 --> 00:33:12,160
Is anyone there?

538
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:18,124
<i>You must help us!</i>

539
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:20,752
- You hear that?
- Was that Halling?

540
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:24,779
Halling?

541
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,537
Colonel, through here!

542
00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:30,553
- It's very good to see you.
- Likewise, my friend.

543
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:35,469
- Are you all right?
- We're fine, those of us that are left.

544
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:37,773
- Teyla said you would come.
- Where is she?

545
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:39,979
Michael has taken her.
You must go after her.

546
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:42,394
Take your people.
We'll meet you in a little while.

547
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:45,430
Everyone, it's the time.
Come. Gather your strength.

548
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:47,960
Come through.
Everyone.

549
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:55,397
My God.

550
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:07,507
They're dead.

551
00:34:16,457 --> 00:34:18,226
- You think Teyla.
- No, I don't think so,

552
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:19,775
and you don't think so.

553
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,495
I don't mean to rush things,
but I'm picking up an energy reading.

554
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:42,041
Someone's firing up the ship.

555
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,846
Carson! Carson!

556
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,833
I know. I'm the last person
you expected to see.

557
00:35:15,718 --> 00:35:18,677
- It's all right. I'm here to help you.
- It's not possible.

558
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:22,858
I'm sorry, I don't have time to explain.
The others are waiting back at the lab.

559
00:35:23,018 --> 00:35:24,951
- We have to go, now.
- I can't.

560
00:35:26,003 --> 00:35:29,568
Kanaan, the father of my son,
he is still here.

561
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:31,249
I am not leaving without him.

562
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:33,960
- There's no time.
- Quite correct.

563
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,322
You should've run
when you had the chance,

564
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,384
<i>but you let your feelings
get in the way.</i>

565
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:44,465
Stay back.
I'm warning you.

566
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:46,588
Shoot him, Carson.

567
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:48,602
Shoot him now!

568
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:53,563
He doesn't want to shoot me.

569
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:57,608
<i>Or to be more precise,
he'd like nothing more,</i>

570
00:35:57,868 --> 00:35:59,784
but, like all my creations,

571
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:02,321
he is open to my influence.

572
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:09,912
I'm sorry, Teyla.

573
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,665
Don't!

574
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,301
You don't look well.

575
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:25,757
<i>You should have stayed with me.</i>

576
00:36:25,931 --> 00:36:28,998
I'd give you an injection,
but I don't have any with me.

577
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:30,955
Anyway...

578
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:34,020
you've served your purpose.

579
00:36:44,237 --> 00:36:45,448
Time to go.

580
00:36:58,998 --> 00:37:00,505
Take a look, east wall.

581
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:02,911
<i>Those look like gas containers?</i>

582
00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:04,459
Yep.

583
00:37:07,563 --> 00:37:08,802
Worth a shot.

584
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:29,473
- Where's Beckett?
- This way.

585
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,339
It's Carson.

586
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,463
- What happened?
- You ran off, that's what happened.

587
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,967
- Did you see her?
- Oh, no.

588
00:37:47,837 --> 00:37:50,398
- What the hell is that?
- It's the ship.

589
00:37:51,389 --> 00:37:52,620
- Help him.
- Yeah.

590
00:37:52,907 --> 00:37:53,921
Come on.

591
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,825
We searched the place top to bottom.
No sign of her.

592
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:27,071
Well, for now, we'll have to assume
she's still alive, and Michael has her.

593
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:29,423
We've got prisoners.
They'll talk.

594
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:31,354
We'll find her.

595
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,726
How is he?

596
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:40,667
His body's shutting down.

597
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:43,516
There's nothing more
I can do for him.

598
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:45,826
We can't wait any longer.

599
00:38:45,986 --> 00:38:48,072
Zelenka's prepping
the stasis pod.

600
00:38:48,232 --> 00:38:49,890
<i>I had him in my sights.</i>

601
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:53,356
- All I need to do was pull the trigger.
- It's not your fault.

602
00:38:53,516 --> 00:38:56,691
He made you receptive to the mind link.
It's how he controls all of them...

603
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:58,043
The hybrids.

604
00:38:58,415 --> 00:39:00,168
Would have been nice
to make a difference.

605
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,269
You make it.
We've got Michael on the run.

606
00:39:02,429 --> 00:39:04,541
It's just a matter of time
before we catch up to him.

607
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:06,877
- Rodney...
- Look, don't say anything, okay?

608
00:39:07,288 --> 00:39:09,676
It's no big deal. You're gonna go
into the stasis pod until we

609
00:39:09,836 --> 00:39:11,218
figure out how to fix you.

610
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:13,048
I'm a doctor.

611
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:15,759
I know my own prognosis.

612
00:39:17,323 --> 00:39:19,033
Once I go into that pod,

613
00:39:20,718 --> 00:39:22,647
there's a good chance
I won't come out.

614
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:33,487
Right. All set.

615
00:39:51,323 --> 00:39:52,488
Listen,

616
00:39:53,028 --> 00:39:54,410
we're gonna keep working

617
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,588
until we find a cure
for this thing.

618
00:39:56,748 --> 00:39:59,433
I've got a whole team on it.
Best people we have.

619
00:40:00,575 --> 00:40:02,853
- Thank you.
- <i>Either way, we're gonna get the cure,</i>

620
00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:05,106
soon as we capture Michael.

621
00:40:12,324 --> 00:40:13,486
Samantha,

622
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:17,158
there's a letter in my quarters
addressed to my mother.

623
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:20,871
Don't worry, I was careful
not to give anything away.

624
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,768
Tell her you found it
after you shipped my things.

625
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:28,563
It's just some thoughts,

626
00:40:28,868 --> 00:40:30,965
things I should have said
a long time ago.

627
00:40:33,003 --> 00:40:34,885
I'll make sure she gets it.

628
00:40:35,145 --> 00:40:36,153
Thank you.

629
00:40:46,136 --> 00:40:49,025
Don't you worry, Doc.
We're gonna have you out of there.

630
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:50,702
Colonel,

631
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,446
you bring her home now,
you understand?

632
00:40:53,824 --> 00:40:54,968
Count on it.

633
00:41:01,885 --> 00:41:04,278
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

634
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:05,958
I know, big man.

635
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:07,991
I'm sorry.

636
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:18,738
Right, well,
you won't feel a thing,

637
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:21,932
aside from a cool burst
when the pod first activates.

638
00:41:23,134 --> 00:41:25,603
<i>Your life signs will be monitored on</i>

639
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:27,542
this machine here 24/7.

640
00:41:30,392 --> 00:41:31,525
Thank you, Rodney.

641
00:41:34,288 --> 00:41:35,878
I want you all to know

642
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:39,157
that seeing you again,

643
00:41:39,317 --> 00:41:40,951
<i>these last few days.</i>

644
00:41:41,522 --> 00:41:42,988
It was all worth it,

645
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:46,123
<i>no matter what happens.</i>

646
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:52,129
You know, I was toying with the idea
of programming dreams into these things.

647
00:41:52,696 --> 00:41:53,839
<i>Interested?</i>

648
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:56,056
I could have you
fishing in the highlands...

649
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:58,344
With a couple of tall,
blonde massage therapists.

650
00:41:59,135 --> 00:42:00,312
Rodney...

651
00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:02,515
I'll be fine.

652
00:42:02,775 --> 00:42:04,351
That's right. You will be.

653
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:06,958
Because this is not goodbye,
this is

654
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:08,104
<i>see you later.</i>

655
00:42:08,364 --> 00:42:09,855
That's what we agreed.

656
00:42:10,115 --> 00:42:11,148
Did we?

657
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:13,484
That's how I remember it.

658
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,595
All right, then.

659
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:19,115
See you all later.
