1
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:05,994
Neuraminidase inhibitor...

2
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:11,524
Neuraminidase inhibitor...

3
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:19,526
Heard you're going off-world?

4
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:23,233
I'm assisting with a medical follow-up
on M33-985, yes.

5
00:00:23,353 --> 00:00:25,227
- With Keller.
- Right again.

6
00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:27,864
- On your day off.
- I can't go off-world in my free time?

7
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:30,694
No, no, go ahead. I just think
it's odd that you're volunteering

8
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:33,316
for goodwill missions
on your day off.

9
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:37,415
I'm turning over a new leaf.
It's a whole new gentler Rodney McKay.

10
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:52,426
There you are.
You all set?

11
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,911
You coming too, are you?

12
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:59,812
Yeah, Ronon offered
to help out, too,

13
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:03,333
so I just thought, you know,
the more the merrier, right?

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,873
Is there a problem?

15
00:01:06,993 --> 00:01:09,614
No, no, just, I was...
No, it's nothing.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,913
Go ahead and dial, Chuck.

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,038
I got this.
I'm good, I got it.

18
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:20,084
I'm good.
You want it?

19
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:21,971
You take that,
I got...

20
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:24,086
my own stuff I'll bring.

21
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:31,233
So, the people we're seeing today,

22
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:34,051
as long as you avoid any physical
contact, you should be fine.

23
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:36,470
The contagion
doesn't seem to be airborne.

24
00:01:36,702 --> 00:01:38,082
What's wrong with them?

25
00:01:38,202 --> 00:01:40,937
It's a disease similar
to one on Earth called influenza.

26
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:44,338
It's been spreading throughout
the village. Not too severe a strain,

27
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,856
but enough to put a scare into them.

28
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,995
He's caught it, too.

29
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:56,727
- Will he be all right?
- His fever's mild,

30
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:59,860
so, plenty of rest, lots of fluids,
and he should be fine.

31
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,041
I'm also going to prescribe
some medicine...

32
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:03,918
A neuraminidase inhibitor?

33
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:05,867
Very good.

34
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:10,425
Can I have a look at you too, Erran,
just to be on the safe side?

35
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:16,248
Do you guys mind
giving us some privacy?

36
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:19,601
I think there's a tavern close by.
Why don't you go get some lunch?

37
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,411
You want to... Sure.

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,442
What's the matter,
you don't like it?

39
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:38,003
You don't have to be here.

40
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:40,264
I'm sure you got plenty of stuff to do
back on Atlantis.

41
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:43,656
Oddly enough, I don't, actually.
But if you need to get back, then...

42
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:44,976
No, I'm good.

43
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:46,737
Of course you are.

44
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,443
We've given them enough time?
I don't want to interrupt

45
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:54,756
in the middle of medical... stuff.

46
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,863
Hi.
Is Dr. Keller done?

47
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,681
She's not with you?

48
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:03,155
She finished with us, then left.

49
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:06,074
Said she was going
to join you at the tavern.

50
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,348
Right. Very good. Thanks.

51
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:13,593
Jennifer, it's Rodney,
do you read me?

52
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:16,749
Dr. Keller, please respond.

53
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:21,618
Either her radio isn't working,
or she's turned it off.

54
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:24,937
- She wouldn't do that.
- Then what happened to her?

55
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:30,878

www.seriestele.net

58
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:42,632
- Anything?
- Checked the street. No one's seen her.

59
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:44,483
It's like she just vanished.


60
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:47,018
She wouldn't take off without letting us
know where she's going.

61
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:49,607
Not unless someone
took her against her will.

62
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:53,292
- Go back to the Gate, radio Atlantis.
- Maybe you're right.

63
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:55,910
I'll stay here
and check the entire village.

64
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:28,399
Who are you?

65
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,900
If you'd stop struggling,
I wouldn't have to stun you.

66
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:37,405
- What do you want from me?
- And stop asking questions.

67
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:41,409
I just want to know
why you kidnapped me.

68
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:45,255
How did you take me from the village?
I don't even remember...

69
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,898
Good.

70
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:54,439
Let's go.

71
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:02,096
- <i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>
- I got footprints outside the village.

72
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:05,058
- Jennifer's?
<i>- Standard Atlantis tread.</i>

73
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:07,633
But there's someone with her.

74
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,161
Bigger prints. Like my size.

75
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,801
Looks like there was a struggle.

76
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:14,318
Dammit.

77
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:19,322
Weird thing is... It's like
they just appeared out of nowhere.

78
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:21,650
What do you mean, nowhere?

79
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,056
<i>I mean there's nothing at all
between here and the village.</i>

80
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:27,577
Then they just appear,
like they dropped out of the sky.

81
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,924
Wait a sec.

82
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:33,336
Got a single set of tracks
heading into the woods.

83
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:35,001
What, a single set?

84
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:37,042
<i>Not Keller's, the other guy's.</i>

85
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:38,800
So what happened to Keller's?

86
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:43,259
These prints are deeper.

87
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:45,899
My guess is he's carrying her.

88
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,393
Probably knocked her unconscious,
or...

89
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,457
God.

90
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:55,858
- I'm going to check it out.
<i>- Maybe you should wait.</i>

91
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:58,305
All right? I'm almost at the Gate.
I'll radio ahead,

92
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,751
get a team here,
do a proper search.

93
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:04,475
<i>That sounds good. You do that.
Meantime, I'm going after her.</i>

94
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:13,400
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

95
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:15,868
I got two sets of tracks again.

96
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,172
She's still alive.

97
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:22,103
Great! That's great!

98
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:26,088
All right, I'm at the Gate.

99
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:30,249
I'll get the search teams mobilized
and join you shortly.

100
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:04,796
Crap!

101
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:09,640
What?

102
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:12,259
- We got Wraith!
- How many?

103
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:16,658
Four of them just came through the Gate.
One of them's about to kill me!

104
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:15,124
Finally.

105
00:08:15,922 --> 00:08:17,208
What took you so long?

106
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,038
You're welcome.

107
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:23,488
- It's a hunter.
- What?

108
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,424
Wraith hunter. They chase Runners.

109
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:27,593
I thought Runners were extremely rare.


110
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:29,010
- Right.
- Few years ago,

111
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,471
we run into you, now another?

112
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:33,209
- I mean, what are the odds of that?
- Where'd the other Wraith go?

113
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:35,810
I don't know,
they spread out into the forest.

114
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:37,979
Where're you going?
Where are you going? Wait!

115
00:08:39,822 --> 00:08:42,221
This is as far as we go
on the trail.

116
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,342
Where are you taking me?

117
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,409
At least tell me your name.

118
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,145
There'll be time to talk
when we get there.

119
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,026
Where?

120
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:07,175
What are you doing?

121
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:20,840
Watch out!

122
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,891
We need to get your people
to a safe place as fast as possible.

123
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,267
- Why? What happened?
- We spotted Wraith in the area.

124
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,831
Wraith? Coming here?

125
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:52,136
It's just a few of them.
Maybe looking for someone else.

126
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:53,736
We don't want to take the risk.


127
00:09:53,856 --> 00:09:56,433
Have you seen anyone different
in the village recently?

128
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:58,749
Any newcomers, anyone that looks,

129
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:00,520
like that?

130
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:01,501
No.

131
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:04,213
We don't have time for this.
Is there a place your people can hide?

132
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,955
There are caverns near the village.
Our ancestors used them.

133
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,776
Good. Come on, let's go.

134
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,990
What is that thing?

135
00:10:13,577 --> 00:10:15,784
- Take too long to explain.
- Too long?

136
00:10:15,904 --> 00:10:18,102
We've been walking for hours now.

137
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:21,331
- Can I at least rest for a bit?
- No.

138
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,591
Just a few minutes?

139
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:26,069
A few minutes to allow your team
to gain ground on us?

140
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:27,262
What team?

141
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:31,887
You're from Atlantis. You're a doctor.
There were two men traveling with you.

142
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,667
Watch your step.

143
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,100
Just keep going.

144
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,488
It's just past that gully,
you're almost there.

145
00:10:52,897 --> 00:10:55,266
That's it, that's it.
Mind your step, sir.

146
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:56,616
- Sir?
- Ma... Ma'am.

147
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:58,852
Sorry. I... You have a...

148
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:00,496
That is clearly a mustache.

149
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:07,184
That's the last of them.

150
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:08,670
The village is empty now.


151
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:11,862
Go with them,
make sure they stay in the caverns.

152
00:11:11,982 --> 00:11:14,677
And keep 'em quiet, make sure no one
makes a sound unless you hear from me.

153
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:15,870
Or me.

154
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,888
All right. Thank you.

155
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:24,145
- Maybe we should go back to the Gate?
- No, go ahead. I'll track Keller.

156
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:27,987
It's not wise for us to split up.
We don't know where the Wraith are...

157
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:30,289
It takes too long to go back.
That Runner took her.

158
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:32,643
We let him get too far ahead,
we'll never find them.

159
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:35,313
Look, you want to go to the Gate,
go ahead. I'm leaving.

160
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:39,869
Dammit! Would you just... Ronon!

161
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:51,964
You done trying to escape?

162
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:57,511
More Wraith close by.
We need to keep moving.

163
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:04,302
You're not from the village,
are you?

164
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,256
I've never noticed you,
and I pretty much met everyone.

165
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:09,378
Are you even from this planet?

166
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:15,291
You're the one who brought
the Wraith here. They're after you. Why?

167
00:12:15,688 --> 00:12:16,896
I'm a Runner.

168
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:19,001
You know about Runners?

169
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:22,096
One of the men I'm traveling with,
he used to be one.

170
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:24,161
Used to be? That's impossible.

171
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:26,192
Runners don't stop being Runners.

172
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,876
- Yeah? Well, this one did.
- Yeah? Well, how?

173
00:12:30,857 --> 00:12:32,588
Take me to him, and we'll tell you.

174
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:35,500
I promise.

175
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:39,307
Look, we don't have to be enemies.

176
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:43,181
Nice try.

177
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:49,223
If you...

178
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:51,066
What?

179
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:53,764
This is where Keller's tracks
start up again.

180
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:57,405
Look...
Smaller, shallower, Atlantis tread.

181
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:00,785
These prints are bigger and deeper.

182
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:04,754
- The Runner.
- Keller's tracks are uneven.

183
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:06,455
She's either hurt or bound.

184
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:07,761
Probably both.

185
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,544
At least the tracks are clear.
Easier to follow, right?

186
00:13:11,944 --> 00:13:14,759
That's the problem.
No Runner is that stupid.

187
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:21,770
It's gonna be dark soon.

188
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,587
Actually, we have two hours,
43 minutes, and 17 seconds.

189
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,172
This planet's sun currently has
a very gradual angle of descent

190
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:30,558
and a very short night.

191
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:33,180
I always make it a point
to download the planetary data

192
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,885
on every address I dial,
even goodwill missions.

193
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:37,945
Yeah, things like
atmospheric conditions,

194
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,668
soil consistencies,
available water supplies...

195
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:41,691
What?

196
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:44,951
Just wondering how long you'd make it
out here without your little gadgets.

197
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:46,806
I think you'd be surprised.

198
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,457
I mean, I may not be exactly
what you'd call an outdoors person,

199
00:13:50,618 --> 00:13:53,891
but that doesn't mean I don't find
man vs. nature thing uninteresting.

200
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:57,429
Hell, I joined a scouting organization
when I was a child.

201
00:13:57,549 --> 00:13:59,834
Lodge 14
of the Fort McMurray eager beavers.

202
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:02,655
- Beavers?
- Yep. Large rodent. Big teeth.

203
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:06,421
They use 'em to chop down trees
and build dams... Very industrious.

204
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,537
I was with them for a few months
before they asked me to leave,

205
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:13,022
but I got the manual...
Still have it... <i>Scouting for beavers.</i>

206
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:14,301
Valuable resource.

207
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,256
So, I think you'll find, in a pinch,
I handle myself very well,

208
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:18,738
thank you very...

209
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,858
What is it?

210
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:21,119
Blood.

211
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,645
- Oh, my God.
- No, it's Wraith blood.

212
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:26,735
Here we go.

213
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,923
Someone was sitting here.

214
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,739
Look.

215
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:36,268
Single set of tracks...

216
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:40,253
But they left the trail
going that way.

217
00:14:40,373 --> 00:14:42,614
Are you sure? 'Cause the footprints
keep going this way.

218
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:43,594
Single set.

219
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,571
Yeah, I know,
but maybe he's carrying her again.

220
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:48,572
Or maybe they were attacked
by the Wraith,

221
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:50,450
Jennifer was stunned,

222
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,270
and then the Runner kills the Wraith
and disposes of the body,

223
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:56,544
and then carries Jennifer
on up the trail.

224
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,693
Look how deep these tracks are.

225
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:01,554
I say we follow these.

226
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,236
Easy.

227
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,986
Like I said,
no Runner is that stupid.

228
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,151
What now?

229
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:42,539
We go up.

230
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:46,118
Up? How?
Do you have a rope?

231
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:47,866
No need for ropes.

232
00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:54,918
Did we just...

233
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,289
How did we do that?

234
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:02,756
I was on a planet a while back.
Lots of technology.

235
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:05,334
Got this from one of the locals.

236
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:08,351
Barely put it on my arm
before it fused to my skin.

237
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:10,431
Since then,
if I hit this light when it's green,

238
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,767
I can disappear,
move around from place to place.

239
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:17,104
Teleportation. That's how you got me
out of the village so fast.

240
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:19,610
I can only go short distances.

241
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,419
It needs time to recharge
between jumps,

242
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,549
especially
when I take someone with me.

243
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:25,807
But it's helped me stay
ahead of the Wraith.

244
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:27,272
I imagine so.

245
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:31,628
McKay!

246
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:34,455
Dammit.

247
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:51,676
What the hell were you doing?

248
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:53,390
At the moment?
Killing Wraith!

249
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:55,225
What are you stopping for?

250
00:16:55,894 --> 00:16:58,987
- I had a stone in my boot, I told you.
- No, you didn't.

251
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:01,113
I did! I said
"Wait up, I got a stone in my boot."

252
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:04,197
Every second you lag behind makes it
much harder for me to track this guy.

253
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:06,858
- Especially at night.
- Not anymore.

254
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:12,034
We don't have to play mantracker now.
We'll know exactly where this guy is...

255
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,136
Thanks to this handy gadget.

256
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:20,501
Look at that signal.
They're farther away than I thought.

257
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:29,358
I'm sorry. I guaranty you,
at some point, you'll need my help.

258
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:33,013
You'll see. There'll be some problem
you can't solve, then you'll turn to me,

259
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:36,047
I'll figure it out in the nick of time.
You'll say, "Good job",

260
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,678
or just grunt or slap me on the back
harder than necessary,

261
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:41,338
anyways, the point is...
We both have our gifts.

262
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,626
So you need to stop
resenting my presence here,

263
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:45,526
and start realizing
we're on the same team,

264
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,855
both trying to achieve
the same goal. All right?

265
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:51,907
You listening? We got the tracker.
Can you hear what I'm saying here?

266
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:55,478
When are you gonna tell me
what you want from me?

267
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:57,313
I need you to help someone.

268
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,044
- Who?
- That's not important to you.

269
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:02,358
You just need to give her
medical attention.

270
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:03,230
Her?

271
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:05,451
Who is she, your wife?

272
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:09,249
When we get there,
I won't be able to stay with you.

273
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:11,724
The longer I'm in one place,
the greater the danger.

274
00:18:11,844 --> 00:18:14,430
Probably a dozen more Wraith
on the way.

275
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,455
Trail ends here.

276
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,145
Well, he's dead ahead.

277
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:21,520
So either he climbed this thing,
or he figured out how to get around it.

278
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:25,108
- No sign they went around.
- They must've had a rope or something.

279
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:28,052
Unlike us.
Look, how are we gonna get up there?

280
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:29,723
You said,
about solving a problem?

281
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,880
Yeah, technological problems,
not rock-climbing problems.

282
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,032
Thought so.

283
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:40,073
Have you ever thought about trying
to remove that tracking device?

284
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,553
You could say that.
Had a few doctors try.

285
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:44,899
No luck.

286
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:48,017
I have advanced medical
technology with me.

287
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:48,922
I know.

288
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,435
So I could probably remove it.
That Runner I was telling you about?

289
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:54,447
One of our doctors
removed his tracking device.

290
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,301
So he was able
to stop being a Runner.

291
00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:58,979
You have something in here
that can remove it?

292
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:00,684
I have a scanner.

293
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:04,862
With that, I can pinpoint
the location of your tracking device,

294
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:08,442
give you some anesthetic,
make a quick incision, you're free.

295
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,070
Look, you say there's someone
who needs medical attention?

296
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:15,864
It's gonna be a lot safer for all of us
if we throw the Wraith off your trail

297
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:17,495
before we get there.

298
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:36,684
Okay.

299
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,176
Turn around.

300
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:42,777
- If you try anything...
- Just turn around.

301
00:19:53,563 --> 00:19:54,943
Do you see it?

302
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:01,800
What did you see?

303
00:20:04,222 --> 00:20:05,806
Your tracking device...

304
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,956
It's different...

305
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,963
It's much more complicated.

306
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:14,537
It's branched out,
fused not only to your spine,

307
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:16,413
but also your brain stem.

308
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,590
Removing it would kill you.

309
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:28,246
I'm sorry.

310
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:31,608
We need to get moving.

311
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:46,866
Okay. Nightfall, 17 minutes,

312
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:48,882
but like I said, it's very brief.

313
00:20:49,002 --> 00:20:51,299
Like... Whitehorse in June.

314
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,424
Oh, not that you have any idea
what Whitehorse is,

315
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,357
or June, for that matter...

316
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:57,830
What the...?

317
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:04,638
Holy crap! Did you see that thing?

318
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:11,470
- This guy is good.
- This guy's a killer!

319
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:17,505
Good.

320
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,909
- No one found it.
- Found what?

321
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:34,788
Her name is Celise.

322
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:37,453
What happened to her?

323
00:21:37,956 --> 00:21:40,368
She fell, injured her leg.

324
00:21:42,786 --> 00:21:45,265
I did my best
to clean the wound, but...

325
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,574
It's infected.

326
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:50,511
- When did this happen?
- A few days ago.

327
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:53,926
When she got worse,
I went looking for a doctor.

328
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,567
We went to three different planets.

329
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:58,264
I heard people from Atlantis
were helping the village here

330
00:21:58,384 --> 00:21:59,780
with their sickness.

331
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:03,275
So I brought her here,
found this cave to hide her,

332
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:06,734
set a few traps to keep the Wraith
or anyone else away,

333
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,248
then waited for you to show up.

334
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:13,702
You know, you could've just asked
for my help instead of kidnapping me.

335
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:15,870
I couldn't take that chance.

336
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:19,370
Most people don't want anything
to do with Runners.

337
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:23,968
Is she your daughter?

338
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:25,742
No.

339
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:29,976
She lived in a village
that was destroyed by the Wraith.

340
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:33,749
Let me guess.
You brought the Wraith there?

341
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:35,757
I stayed there one night.

342
00:22:36,326 --> 00:22:38,276
I didn't think
they'd find me that fast.

343
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,821
The culled the whole village.

344
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,551
Celise was the only person
I could save.

345
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:49,621
How bad is she?

346
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:51,480
Very bad.

347
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:56,044
Her blood pressure's dangerously low.
She's septic, going into shock.

348
00:22:56,204 --> 00:22:58,957
- What does that mean?
- It means the wound is necrotic.

349
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,008
I'm gonna have
to surgically debride it,

350
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:03,719
cut away the dead tissue.

351
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:06,666
I'm gonna start her
on an IV antibiotic,

352
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:11,226
but she needs much stronger medications
than I have with me.

353
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:13,839
She's a very, very sick girl.

354
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:15,932
She can't die.

355
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:18,240
You cannot let her die.

356
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,906
I'll do what I can.

357
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:25,993
I'll be close by.

358
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh. It's okay.

359
00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:54,838
It's okay, I'm here to help you.

360
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,342
I gave you some medicine to numb
your leg. Do you feel any pain?

361
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:03,777
Good.

362
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,697
That's good.

363
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:08,245
Where's Kiryk?

364
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:10,357
Kiryk.

365
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,807
So that's his name.

366
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:17,346
He's just outside, keeping watch,
making sure you're safe. Okay?

367
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,134
That's a beautiful doll.

368
00:24:24,474 --> 00:24:25,971
Kiryk made it for me.

369
00:24:28,286 --> 00:24:29,855
Mean old Kiryk, huh?

370
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:31,604
Go figure.

371
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:34,957
He's not mean.
He just pretends to be.

372
00:24:40,387 --> 00:24:42,218
I know someone just like him.

373
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:46,110
The signal's circling.

374
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,737
Wherever he's taking her,
I think they've arrived.

375
00:24:48,857 --> 00:24:51,485
- How long before daybreak?
- Not long now. Maybe under an hour.

376
00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:52,890
It's pretty short.

377
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,075
What are you doing?
Shoot it!

378
00:25:03,956 --> 00:25:05,168
Don't move.

379
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:20,814
- One less trap to worry about.
- Is that supposed to be comforting?

380
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:33,824
You scared me.

381
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:36,418
How is she?

382
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,921
I debrided the wound,
cleaned it as best I could,

383
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:43,348
but she's not out of danger,
not by a long shot.

384
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:46,734
She needs a much stronger
antibiotic regimen,

385
00:25:46,854 --> 00:25:49,571
not to mention
the probability of a skin graft.

386
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:52,934
I'd like to take her to Atlantis.

387
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:56,567
Our infirmary can provide her
with the proper care she needs.

388
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:58,840
- I can't go to Atlantis.
- I know.

389
00:26:00,096 --> 00:26:02,780
You're gonna have to trust me
with her care.

390
00:26:06,552 --> 00:26:09,128
As long as you return her to me
when she's healed.

391
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:11,296
Kiryk, you have
to understand something.

392
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:14,859
There's no guarantee she'll survive.
She's still very sick.

393
00:26:15,812 --> 00:26:17,512
But if she survives...

394
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:21,958
being constantly hunted by the Wraith
is no life for a child.

395
00:26:22,118 --> 00:26:23,287
You know that.

396
00:26:23,728 --> 00:26:25,670
If you really want her to live,

397
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:27,834
you need to let her go.

398
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:31,965
If I knew that she would...

399
00:26:33,604 --> 00:26:34,604
What is it?

400
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,022
Kiryk?

401
00:28:02,462 --> 00:28:03,672
What happened?

402
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:06,646
The Wraith stunned you.

403
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:08,559
Almost killed Celise.

404
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,968
Couldn't revive you.
They must've hit you with a triple dose

405
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:14,176
of whatever is in those stunners.

406
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:16,268
I knew we had to get away
from the cave,

407
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:19,159
so I carried Celise here,
and then I went back,

408
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,936
and literally dragged you
the distance.

409
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,470
Not an easy task,
let me tell you.

410
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:27,148
How is she?

411
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:29,423
Stable, for the time being.

412
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:34,416
But her fever is still very high.
The longer she stays on this planet,

413
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,249
the greater the danger.

414
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,848
I'll carry her.
We'll head back for the Gate.

415
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,060
With the Wraith closing in on us?
How far do you think we're gonna get?

416
00:28:45,448 --> 00:28:47,812
A lot farther
than you trying to carry her yourself.

417
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,714
Okay, look.

418
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:54,986
I've been thinking. I may not be able
to remove the tracking device,

419
00:28:55,146 --> 00:28:57,641
but there might be a way
to disable it.

420
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:01,701
This machine...
It's called a defibrillator.

421
00:29:02,588 --> 00:29:05,515
It creates a powerful electric shock
to restore someone's heart

422
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:06,831
to the proper rhythm,

423
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:09,377
and I think,
if I can place the paddles

424
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,878
on the skin directly above
your tracking device,

425
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:14,714
I might be able
to overload the power source.

426
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,050
Fry the circuits.

427
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:19,761
All right. Do it.

428
00:29:20,243 --> 00:29:24,211
Okay, but you should know that there's
no guarantees this is gonna work,

429
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:26,898
and it also carries a lot of risk.

430
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:29,827
If it works,
the device will be disabled.

431
00:29:29,947 --> 00:29:31,394
If it kills me...

432
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:32,744
Same thing.

433
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:36,111
The Wraith won't be able
to track me anymore.

434
00:29:39,315 --> 00:29:41,110
It's time to stop running.

435
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,899
It's not too much further.

436
00:29:50,213 --> 00:29:52,252
Promise me you'll make sure
she's cared for.

437
00:29:53,777 --> 00:29:54,838
I promise.

438
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:13,411
The charge moves
from one paddle to the other.

439
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:16,401
And your tracking device
is gonna be directly between them. Okay?

440
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:24,431
All right.

441
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:34,092
Ready?

442
00:30:38,325 --> 00:30:39,703
Okay, here we go.

443
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:45,133
What the hell?

444
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:47,802
- What?
- I don't know, it just...

445
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:50,029
Suddenly stopped transmitting.

446
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:52,076
We lost them.

447
00:30:57,853 --> 00:30:58,869
Come on...

448
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,079
You okay?

449
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:14,876
What happened?

450
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,016
I lost you for a moment.

451
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,120
But you're back
in the land of the living.

452
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:21,623
Did it work?

453
00:31:25,894 --> 00:31:27,020
I think so.

454
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:29,711
The device isn't transmitting
any signals.

455
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,183
I think we successfully fried
the sucker.

456
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,148
What?

457
00:31:37,308 --> 00:31:39,567
- I guess we fried that, too.
- Doesn't matter.

458
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:41,525
Don't need it anymore.

459
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:42,744
Actually...

460
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:46,562
I know someone who would love
to inspect a gadget like that.

461
00:31:51,657 --> 00:31:52,673
Anything?

462
00:31:53,982 --> 00:31:54,984
What?

463
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,033
A body was dragged through here.

464
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:12,329
- You got something?
- Yeah.

465
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:14,305
Two bodies laid here.

466
00:32:14,706 --> 00:32:16,588
Ground cover's trampled in two spots.

467
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,634
So the Wraith got to them
before we did?

468
00:32:18,754 --> 00:32:21,818
I don't think so.
I don't see any Wraith footprints.

469
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:24,961
So what happened?
What, they killed each other?

470
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:28,499
No one's dead. At least they weren't
when they were here.

471
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:30,726
Look.
One body was dragged through here...

472
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:32,954
- By Keller... Her footprints.
- So she killed him.

473
00:32:33,114 --> 00:32:35,039
Probably by disabling
his tracking device.

474
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,883
Nah. She didn't kill him.

475
00:32:37,003 --> 00:32:38,209
He was unconscious.

476
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:42,171
His footprints, side-by-side with hers,
leaving the clearing that way.

477
00:32:42,331 --> 00:32:45,231
So she brought him here unconscious,
revived him, and they left together?

478
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:47,402
- Looks like it.
- Wait. Said there were two bodies.

479
00:32:47,522 --> 00:32:49,846
- So, what, she took a nap?
- No. Too small for Keller.

480
00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:52,419
My guess is
someone else is with them.

481
00:32:52,994 --> 00:32:54,350
Probably a child.

482
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:56,363
But no footprints?

483
00:32:57,589 --> 00:32:58,289
No.

484
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:00,648
- She was carried here.
- She?

485
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:03,274
How could you possibly
know the kid was a girl...

486
00:33:13,128 --> 00:33:13,977
Darts.

487
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:16,932
Looks like we're not the only ones
who noticed his signal died.

488
00:33:21,693 --> 00:33:24,505
Could sure use
that teleportation device now.

489
00:33:24,895 --> 00:33:27,485
There's a path down
not too far from here.

490
00:33:28,024 --> 00:33:29,030
Stay here.

491
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:31,334
I'll check to make sure
it's still safe.

492
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:46,930
Ronon, wait!

493
00:33:47,473 --> 00:33:48,946
- Make him stop!
- What? Why?

494
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:56,037
Ronon, please! Stop!

495
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,356
Help me.

496
00:33:57,476 --> 00:33:58,493
Grab her!

497
00:34:01,911 --> 00:34:02,835
Stop!

498
00:34:04,771 --> 00:34:06,673
He just wanted me
to help the little girl.

499
00:34:07,318 --> 00:34:08,466
She's sick!

500
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:12,358
She's dying.
We need to get her back to Atlantis.

501
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:15,017
Please?

502
00:34:22,557 --> 00:34:23,879
Jennifer, the...

503
00:34:24,477 --> 00:34:25,702
Her sutures have torn.

504
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:28,487
I need to restitch her
before we can move her.

505
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:36,609
You got Wraith looking for you.

506
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,079
I know.

507
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:40,957
You stand a better chance fighting them
than fighting each other.

508
00:34:41,189 --> 00:34:44,528
Obviously the odds of actually winning
are still ridiculously low, but...

509
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:45,783
Not helping.

510
00:34:45,964 --> 00:34:47,286
I'm gonna go...

511
00:34:49,925 --> 00:34:50,883
He's right.

512
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:53,642
This place is gonna be swarming
with Wraith.

513
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:56,231
It's better off if we work together.

514
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,346
- All right, she's ready.
- Let's go.

515
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:20,684
Wraiths!

516
00:35:23,424 --> 00:35:24,677
Oh, crap.

517
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,064
- Shoot him!
- I will!

518
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:08,796
Where'd you learn
to fight like that?

519
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:12,624
Been taking a few sparring lessons.

520
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,390
We need to move.

521
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:24,088
I tried to stabilize her,
but she needs stronger medication.

522
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:27,164
You could've asked for her assistance
as opposed to kidnapping her.

523
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:29,887
He knows, Rodney.
Here, I got you something.

524
00:36:30,007 --> 00:36:32,935
- It's a kinda teleportation device.
- Teleportation? Really?

525
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:35,775
Well, it was, anyway.
I kinda broke it.

526
00:36:39,419 --> 00:36:40,616
Is she family?

527
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:45,057
I brought the Wraith to her village.
She's the sole survivor.

528
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:49,220
It's not easy... living with that.

529
00:36:52,773 --> 00:36:55,058
Don't worry.
We're gonna get you outta this.

530
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:56,278
Both of you.

531
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:18,281
I count six Wraith.

532
00:37:18,441 --> 00:37:21,200
Six that we can see.
Probably more in the surrounding woods.

533
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,955
Want to make a run for it?
Shoot our way through?

534
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:27,092
The ships will be alerted
as soon as the shooting starts.

535
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:30,678
- We'll be culled before we can dial.
- Just gonna have to take our chances.

536
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,446
You fixed it!

537
00:37:33,566 --> 00:37:36,299
I don't know about "fixed".
It's incredibly complicated technology.

538
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:39,302
I'm not sure if it'll actually...
What're you doing?

539
00:37:40,596 --> 00:37:42,680
I'm gonna improve our chances.

540
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,811
Don't go down there by yourself.

541
00:37:49,756 --> 00:37:51,939
I'll be fine.
Get ready to attack that clearing.

542
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,511
Look, just wait a second, all right?
I'm not sure if I actually fixed it.

543
00:37:55,631 --> 00:37:57,320
You'll need to test it before you...

544
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,917
I guess I did fix it.

545
00:38:15,444 --> 00:38:16,605
He's at the Gate!

546
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:18,034
Stay with them.

547
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:40,646
He's dialing the Gate.

548
00:39:20,928 --> 00:39:22,279
We've gotta get a move on.

549
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:25,074
All right, we'll take her to the Gate,
then I'll go back,

550
00:39:25,341 --> 00:39:27,284
tell people it's safe
to return to the village.

551
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,805
No, as they fly up,

552
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,848
you wanna use that button there
to shoot them.

553
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,533
Shoot the ducks?

554
00:39:48,034 --> 00:39:51,285
They're not real ducks, obviously.
They're just, you know, for pretend...

555
00:39:51,405 --> 00:39:53,838
Maybe you should show her
a different game.

556
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,141
Yeah, sure. Here.

557
00:39:55,261 --> 00:39:57,040
Well, how's our little patient?

558
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,482
Oh, much better.

559
00:39:58,665 --> 00:40:00,420
She's a heck of a fighter.

560
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,088
Is he bothering you?
Because I can have him removed.

561
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,197
- Forcibly.
- Really?

562
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:07,116
Yeah. He's kidding.

563
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:09,035
I talked to one
of the families on 985...

564
00:40:09,354 --> 00:40:11,204
The woman's home we visited?

565
00:40:11,324 --> 00:40:13,172
She'd love to have Celise
come live with them.

566
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:14,498
That's great.

567
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:16,292
Will I see Kiryk again?

568
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,757
- I don't know, sweetheart.
- We're still looking for him.

569
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:24,717
Keeping our eyes and ears open.

570
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:26,536
Hey, I brought you something.

571
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:29,009
I think you dropped this
in the woods...

572
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,044
My doll.

573
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:50,750
- What?
- Okay...

574
00:40:51,981 --> 00:40:54,349
Here's the thing.
I've been thinking.

575
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:56,582
And, I need to know your intentions.

576
00:40:57,482 --> 00:40:59,612
- Intentions?
- With Jennifer?

577
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:02,694
I don't have any intentions.

578
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:08,827
- Good.
- Wait.

579
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:14,190
What do you mean by "intentions"?

580
00:41:14,399 --> 00:41:16,534
I mean, are you interested
in her in a...

581
00:41:16,654 --> 00:41:18,784
romantic... fashion?

582
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,233
Good.

583
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:24,855
Wait.

584
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:26,859
What?

585
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:32,010
Maybe I do.
Have... Intentions.

586
00:41:34,234 --> 00:41:35,406
Do you have intentions?

587
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,499
Of course I do.
That's why I was asking you.

588
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,448
So what are we gonna do about it?

589
00:41:39,568 --> 00:41:40,780
I don't know.

590
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,003
I'm not gonna fight you for her.

591
00:41:43,383 --> 00:41:45,131
- Great!
- Not gonna step aside, either.

592
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,302
So...

593
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:49,093
We're just gonna have
to let her decide.

594
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,352
So...

595
00:41:58,565 --> 00:42:00,134
May the best man win.
