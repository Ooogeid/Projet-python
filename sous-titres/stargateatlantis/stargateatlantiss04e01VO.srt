1
00:00:01,204 --> 00:00:03,346
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:03,426 --> 00:00:06,389
Colonel Ellis, you made excellent time
on your first voyage here.

3
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:08,878
The Replicators
know the location of Earth,

4
00:00:09,053 --> 00:00:11,637
and with these new ships,
have the means to get there.

5
00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:14,477
<i>So, you're going to blow up their ships.</i>

6
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:17,196
Oberoth... We had no
choice but to attack you.

7
00:00:17,276 --> 00:00:19,855
You were building warships,
they needed to be neutralized.

8
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:21,313
<i>And now so do you.</i>

9
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:23,442
No matter where we try
to hide on this planet,

10
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:26,884
<i>the replicator satellite
will be able to track us.</i>

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,087
<i>We submerge the City,</i>

12
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:30,410
the water attenuates,
the satellite's beam intensity

13
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:32,827
- <i>buys us some more shield time.</i>
- The water has no effect?

14
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,953
It's having an affect, but
not what we want it to.

15
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:38,165
<i>You want to bring an asteroid
towards us? Is that wise?</i>

16
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:40,574
Atlantis is leaving this planet.

17
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:44,379
- We're not flying high enough.
- We don't have enough power.

18
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,631
Lower the shield.

19
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:52,119
<i>The hyperdrive just shut down.</i>

20
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:53,158
We are lost.

21
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,984
We dropped outta
hyperspace way too soon.

22
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:57,093
<i>I have no idea where we are.</i>

23
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:07,232
She's unresponsive and her pupils
are sluggish. I need you to prep the OR

24
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:09,153
and have the scanner ready
when we get there.

25
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:11,359
We're on it. The scanner
is moving into position.

26
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:13,632
She's crashing.

27
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:17,146
Let's go, guys. I don't
want to do this in the hall.

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,427
Here we go, here we go.

29
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:26,127
You got City-wide sensors back on-line?

30
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:28,780
Hopefully, yeah.
Slowly booting up right now.

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,218
- Can we contact the Apollo?
- Not yet, no.

32
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:33,360
- Why not?
- The sub-space communications are down.

33
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,211
Don't worry,
I've got Chuck working on it.

34
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:39,434
Well, maybe you should be working on it.

35
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,186
I've got bigger fish to fry.

36
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:43,691
What could be more important
than contacting the Apollo?

37
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:45,842
This can't be right.

38
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:46,972
What's wrong?

39
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:50,570
Power.
We're losing massive amounts of power.

40
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,943
Just pull it out.

41
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:53,900
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,301
We have to wait to get you under the
scanner, make sure pulling it out's not

43
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,248
- gonna cause even more damage.
- Pull... it... out.

44
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:03,558
Yeah, yeah, I get it,
you're a tough guy.

45
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:06,664
If you want to pull it out, go ahead,
but I'm not gonna... are you crazy?

46
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:22,140
On three, ready? One, two, three.

47
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:31,228
Clear.

48
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:35,076
Charging.

49
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:37,303
I don't think the problem
is on this end.

50
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:40,245
I don't care where the problem is,
I want to know what the problem is.

51
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:42,484
It's in the conduits.

52
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:44,752
It looks like...

53
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,239
Several main conduits
were affected by the beam.

54
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,487
- All right, that means we'll need to--
<i>- Yes-yes-yes. You should get the--</i>

55
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:53,401
I will, as soon as
I've shut down all the--

56
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:55,135
<i>Yes, yes, yes, I will do the same thing.</i>

57
00:02:55,332 --> 00:02:57,012
Wait, wait, wait, what's going on here?

58
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:59,285
Every second I waste,
we're draining more power.

59
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:01,316
Just trust me,
we're doing the right thing.

60
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:02,497
No change.

61
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,037
Let's start her on Manitol, 200 cc's IV.

62
00:03:06,774 --> 00:03:08,293
Tell me what's going on.

63
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:11,582
Long story short, there are a bunch of
systems on right now don't need to be

64
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:14,567
and given our current situation they're
draining the life out of the City.

65
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:17,663
- Can you not just shut them off?
- Yeah, just wait...

66
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:19,571
Maybe, yeah.

67
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:24,539
Come on...

68
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:26,205
Come on...

69
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,180
- Time?
- She's been flat for almost 2 minutes.

70
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,257
Come on, we need you here, Elizabeth.

71
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:38,199
She's going back into v-fib.
Let's hit her again.

72
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:42,432
Clear.

73
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:48,946
There we go.

74
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,024
There we go. Let's start the scan.

75
00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:58,460
Dr. Keller?

76
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:01,542
That's not good.

77
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:03,543
Her brain is swelling quite seriously.

78
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:06,742
- Would explain the sluggish pupils.
- Yeah, among other things.

79
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:09,073
Give her Nimodipine,
30 milligrams q 4 h,

80
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:11,495
and keep an eye on her blood pressure.

81
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:15,757
Nothing. The control grid's
all out of whack.

82
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:18,262
I can't shut the systems down from here.
We're bleeding out.

83
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,291
- We shut down the systems manually.
- I don't think we have the time.

84
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:22,863
You would rather not try?

85
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,517
Okay, you're right, you're right.

86
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:27,602
Zelenka, we need to deploy some teams.

87
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:31,513
She's not responding.

88
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:35,301
We're losing her.

89
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:42,328
I'm sending some of my men
with your guys in case they need help.

90
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,880
Their ETA is under 5 minutes.
Does that give us enough time?

91
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,126
I don't know, what little power
we had left is almost gone.

92
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:50,579
We'll be lucky if we make it
through the night.

101
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:09,948
- Listen.
- What?

102
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:13,137
You've been making a lot of decisions
without consulting me.

103
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,794
I'm sorry, we're a little under
the gun here. Things move fast.

104
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:18,248
I understand that, but with Elizabeth...

105
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:21,546
incapacitated. I hate to say it, but...

106
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,303
- You're in charge. I know, I'm sorry.
- Just keep me in the loop.

107
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:26,915
Okay.

108
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,553
- Okay, I'll give you the <i>Coles notes</i>.
- The what?

109
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:31,073
The <i>Cliff notes</i>?

110
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:33,814
- Why didn't you just say that?
- Look, never mind. Look.

111
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,440
as we were leaving Lantia we got grazed
by the replicator's satellite beam.

112
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,185
It impacted the side of the tower,
and from what we can tell,

113
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,181
it wreaked havoc
on a number of power conduits.

114
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:43,661
So? Re-route the power then.

115
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,146
Yeah, it's not so easy.

116
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:47,644
Look, the ZPM room
is at the base of the tower,

117
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:51,155
which means the conduits in and around
where the beam hit are primary conduits,

118
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,357
they can't be routed around.

119
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:57,908
- So parts of the City don't have power?
- No, no. The conduits weren't severed,

120
00:06:58,074 --> 00:07:01,631
they were damaged. Look,
it's complicated, but imagine them as...

121
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,743
- Leaky pipes, okay?
- Okay.

122
00:07:03,827 --> 00:07:05,661
You pump water through them, they leak.

123
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,869
You dumb this down any more,
you're going to get hit.

124
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:08,818
Sorry.

125
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:11,287
Look, the City realizes
that, for whatever reason,

126
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,121
power's not making it
to the outer piers,

127
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:14,786
so, instead of repairing the leaks,

128
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:17,488
which it can't do,
it increases the ZPM's output

129
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,478
so that even though the pipes
are leaky and we lose power,

130
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:22,568
enough energy makes it
to the end of the line.

131
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:25,030
- And that's bad?
- No, that's good.

132
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,825
Well, otherwise, we'd lose the shields.
We'd lose atmosphere. we'd all be dead.

133
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,851
There are a number
of systems on right now

134
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:33,103
that don't need to be,
and they're screaming for power.

135
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,770
We're gonna lose juice, potentially
fatal, no matter what we do,

136
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:38,672
but if we can get those
nonessential systems shut down,

137
00:07:38,753 --> 00:07:41,563
then the ZPM will need to pump
less power through the leaky pipes,

138
00:07:41,643 --> 00:07:45,086
and we'll be able to put off
imminent death for another hour or so.

139
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,094
So, then where are we at?

140
00:07:48,174 --> 00:07:50,050
Well, the teams are making good time.

141
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:54,414
We've got about 60% of the nonessential
systems shut down, so--

142
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:56,338
What? What's happening?

143
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,998
The City's outer buildings
are decompressing

144
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,059
and shutting down
their artificial gravity.

145
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,724
Why would the City do such a thing?

146
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,772
It'll collapse the shield.
It's trying to save power.

147
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:10,259
We've got guys out there.

148
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,758
<i>Matthews, fall back
to the tower immediately.</i>

149
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:14,107
I don't think we're done, Sir.

150
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:16,039
The City's shield's collapsing. Move.

151
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:17,888
You heard the man. Go, go!

152
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,367
They're not going to make it.

153
00:08:24,814 --> 00:08:27,852
- Stop it. Stop it from doing this.
- The City doesn't think it can maintain

154
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:29,511
the shield unless we make it smaller.

155
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:31,643
If we delay its collapse,
it could fail completely.

156
00:08:31,757 --> 00:08:33,011
I don't care. Override it.

157
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,783
It's not letting me.

158
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,563
We're almost there.

159
00:08:57,869 --> 00:08:59,207
We're losing those guys!

160
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:01,292
You think I don't realize that?

161
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,164
The gravity just shut down!

162
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:25,538
Tell the other teams to hurry.

163
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,741
I don't want them out there
any longer than they need to be.

164
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:27,111
Hey, are you getting the same
data rate inconsistencies

165
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,535
off these flash drives?

166
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:31,154
Bill?

167
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:37,363
Oh, sorry.

168
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,432
Oh, boy.

169
00:10:39,674 --> 00:10:42,823
- It's this damn weightlessness.
- Maybe you should gate back to Earth.

170
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:45,297
I can get somebody else
to help me bring the station on-line.

171
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:47,273
No. I'll be fine, as soon as I can...

172
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:49,901
figure out
how to get the gravity back on.

173
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:52,797
What were you saying
about the flash drives?

174
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:56,218
Yeah, it's just that every time
I update the software, the drives--

175
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:59,819
the Pegasus Gate just activated.

176
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:02,993
This is colonel Abe Ellis,
commander of the Apollo.

177
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:04,791
Midway Station, please respond.

178
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:07,576
Colonel Ellis, this is
colonel Samantha Carter.

179
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:09,481
I am on the Midway Station.

180
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:11,151
<i>How did the mission go?</i>

181
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:12,792
As far as we can tell,

182
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,477
Atlantis successfully evaded
the replicator's beam

183
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:17,387
and was able to enter hyperspace.

184
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:18,846
<i>From what you can tell?</i>

185
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,558
<i>Well, they're not at
the predetermined rendezvous point.</i>

186
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:22,804
<i>Really?</i>

187
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,878
<i>They should have beaten you there.</i>

188
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,371
<i>Actually, hey, how are you dialing us?</i>

189
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:30,011
<i>M12-578 doesn't have a Gate.
It's off the grid.</i>

190
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:33,069
I jumped to the nearest Gate
to see if they've checked in with you.

191
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:35,639
Well, I'm sorry to say
that they haven't.

192
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:37,161
<i>That's probably not good.</i>

193
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:38,636
No, probably not.

194
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:43,601
I'll head back, dial you again
in an hour, sooner if I hear from them.

195
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:45,387
<i>- Sounds good.</i>
- Apollo out.

196
00:11:55,478 --> 00:11:57,385
Hey, you should be in bed.

197
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:06,519
- How's she doing?
- Her brain... is... swelling,

198
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:08,762
drastically,

199
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:11,537
more than her head can handle.

200
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:15,737
If it doesn't stop, they're gonna have
to perform a decompressive craniectomy.

201
00:12:16,205 --> 00:12:19,627
Basically, they cut out
a piece of her skull,

202
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:21,598
and the brain is allowed to...

203
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:24,162
expand outside of her head.

204
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:33,926
Any word on how she's doing?

205
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:36,302
She's still in the OR. No real news yet.

206
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:39,361
Listen, I think we should collapse
the shield right to the tower.

207
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,577
That will leave us
completely exposed to space.

208
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:44,600
Yes, it will, but our power is spread
so thin right now,

209
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,387
I don't have any extra juice
to come up with the solutions

210
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:50,351
to the 100 or so problems that could
lead to our premature demise today.

211
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:53,259
Check with Zelenka. Make sure all
the science teams are accounted for.

212
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,713
Already done, we're ready.

213
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:55,852
All right.

214
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,394
- Do what you need to do.
- Okay, here we go.

215
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,893
The calcium channel blockers
aren't having much effect.

216
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:17,296
- What's her intracranial pressure?
- 35.

217
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,166
I can't let her get to 40.

218
00:13:24,048 --> 00:13:25,050
Okay...

219
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:28,959
Let's prep for a decompressive
craniectomy.

220
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:13,354
Pressure down to 29.

221
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,255
Hopefully, we'll get it under 25.

222
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:21,613
Yeah...

223
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:24,612
All right, two bits of good news.

224
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:27,419
One, I've been able
to calculate our exact location.

225
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,954
- Does that mean we can use the Gate?
- Sadly, no.

226
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:31,953
To activate the Gate,
we require that we stay

227
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,840
within a fairly small area of space.

228
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,517
We're moving too fast to use it.

229
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:37,271
Can we use the sub-lights to slow down?

230
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:40,444
It would be great if they were working,
but sub-light and navigation are out.

231
00:14:40,855 --> 00:14:42,874
You decided to put this
in the good news category?

232
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,892
Well, at least we're not
lost anymore, right?

233
00:14:44,982 --> 00:14:48,165
Number two, there is nothing wrong
with our hyperdrives.

234
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:50,664
Then why did we fall out of hyperspace
prematurely?

235
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:52,027
The damaged power conduits.

236
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:54,022
We had plenty of gas in the tank,
so to speak,

237
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:55,785
can't get it to the engine. Stalled out.

238
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,281
So if we repair the conduits,
can we jump back into hyperspace?

239
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:01,412
That's the idea. We wouldn't be able
to repair them completely, not without

240
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:04,759
landing and shutting down and such,
but we can definitely patch them up.

241
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,564
Look, Zelenka and his team are working
as fast as they possibly can,

242
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:09,722
but we're still leaking a lot of power.

243
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,213
- Even with all our reductions?
- I'm afraid so, yes.

244
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,119
Look,

245
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:16,206
this is the minimum amount of power

246
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:18,855
the City requires to execute
a jump into hyperspace.

247
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:21,090
If we don't fix the power conduits
inside of an hour,

248
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,610
we'll drop below that level.

249
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:23,973
After that, we're stuck.

250
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,335
We'll have maybe 30 hours
before the shields fail,

251
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:28,371
and we all die in the vacuum of space.

252
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,151
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

253
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,624
They got all the glass out.

254
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,186
- Good.
- You need me somewhere?

255
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,528
Right here getting better.

256
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,249
All right, well, I'm good to go.

257
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:50,579
Colonel...

258
00:15:58,151 --> 00:15:59,151
She okay?

259
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:00,760
She's alive, but...

260
00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:02,522
she's in bad shape.

261
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:05,325
She's got six broken ribs,

262
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:07,151
one of which punctured a lung.

263
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:11,649
Amazingly, she doesn't have
any spinal damage, but...

264
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,498
her head got knocked around pretty good.

265
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:18,090
She's suffering from cerebral oedema,

266
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:20,898
which may have caused
substantial brain damage.

267
00:16:22,963 --> 00:16:24,235
What does all that mean?

268
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,273
Well, it's too early
to know for sure, but...

269
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,596
If she survives,

270
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:32,994
and I got to stress the "if"...

271
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:37,514
She'll never be
the same Elizabeth again.

272
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,401
I'm sorry.

273
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,588
I've got to get some things
and get back in there.

274
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,716
We're understaffed.
Most of our team's on the Apollo.

275
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:04,777
- How's it going on this end?
- Actually, you know, remarkably well.

276
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,231
- Really?
- Yes, yes, yes.

277
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,132
Cannibalizing parts and crystals
from secondary conduits

278
00:17:09,246 --> 00:17:11,449
and interfacing them
with the primary ones is...

279
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:14,410
Is going very smoothly.
Yes, if we keep our current pace,

280
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:16,817
we should be done
well before we drop below

281
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,666
the necessary power requirements to jump
into hyperspace and meet the Apollo.

282
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,501
Well, that's fantastic.

283
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:24,398
Yes. Yeah, I thought you'd be happy.

284
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,365
Happy? There's actually a chance we
might make it through this thing. I'm

285
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:30,259
- ecstatic. I'm gonna do a little--
<i>- Colonel Sheppard, Dr. Mckay,</i>

286
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:32,638
<i>please report
to the control room immediately!</i>

287
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:35,932
That lasted what, like, a second?

288
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,376
You're going to want to look at this.

289
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,883
- What is that?
- An asteroid belt?

290
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:48,351
Are the sub-lights still off-line?

291
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,479
Yup.

292
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:51,216
We're gonna need to expand the shields.

293
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:52,610
We don't have enough power.

294
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,111
How long till we get there,
how long till we get through it?

295
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:56,808
About 10 minutes until we get there.

296
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:58,688
After that,
maybe 2 minutes to get through.

297
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,541
2 minutes to get through
an asteroid field?

298
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:04,046
We're not passing all the way through.
We're just going to skim the edge.

299
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:06,807
- You can't gimme 2 minutes of shields?
- Don't take it personaly.

300
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,636
I'd like them up as much as you would,
but we can't afford the power.

301
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:13,017
Zelenka needs 45 minutes to complete
the repairs to the power conduits.

302
00:18:13,106 --> 00:18:15,023
If we raise the shields
even for one minute,

303
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,891
it'll eat up all his time.
We can't do it.

304
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:20,150
How big are they?

305
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:22,568
We're in the middle
of a pretty big solar system right now,

306
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,798
and the asteroid belt's probably made up
of remnants of early failed planets, so,

307
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:28,331
you know...

308
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:29,892
Building-size and larger.

309
00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:33,990
I can get in the Chair, fire drones,
and clear a path to travel through.

310
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:36,705
Good idea, but the Chair room's
outside of the shield right now,

311
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:39,228
and we'd never get to it.
Look we could...

312
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:42,046
No, that's not going to work.
We could...

313
00:18:43,268 --> 00:18:45,423
How many people on the base
have the ancient gene?

314
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:49,046
20 or so. Look, no, no.
No, no, no, that is a bad idea--

315
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:50,864
- You have a better idea?
- Yes.

316
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,713
I can. I just-- I need some time.
If you...

317
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:56,940
Contact everyone on the base
who has the ancient gene,

318
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,213
tell them to meet me
up at the jumper bay.

319
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,552
Well, do it.

320
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:07,773
Which means we can't raise the shields
because we don't have enough power.

321
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,100
If we don't clear a path for the City,

322
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,361
it'll get ripped apart. So,

323
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:15,269
we're going to take
every last jumper we have,

324
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,810
and we're going to clear a path
through the belt

325
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,660
by firing our drones.

326
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:24,742
Excuse me. I've really only flown
a jumper twice,

327
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:26,876
and I've never actually fired
a live drone,

328
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:28,919
- so--
- You've done it in simulations, right?

329
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:32,112
- Well, yeah, but--
- It's basically the same thing.

330
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:34,603
If McKay can do it, you can do it.

331
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:36,912
- Yes, about that, actually, I--
- Look,

332
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:39,301
I know it's dangerous.

333
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:42,968
I know a lot of you haven't logged a lot
of hours in these things, but right now,

334
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:46,187
it's the only viable option
we have, or...

335
00:19:47,408 --> 00:19:48,272
Or die.

336
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,451
Let's get moving.

337
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:15,216
<i>All right, I've loaded
a flight formation for all of you.</i>

338
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:18,809
Stay in your designated positions,
take out anything that's in your path.

339
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,889
<i>You've got a full load of drones,
so ammo shouldn't be a problem.</i>

340
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:25,428
Looks like the old video game,
Asteroids.

341
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:26,778
Whatever works for you.

342
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:28,377
I was terrible at Asteroids.

343
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,106
I think I actually scored zero once.

344
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,978
Then there's only
one way to go, and that's up.

345
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,832
All right, everyone.

346
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,306
<i>Let's go.</i>

347
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:38,114
<i>Open the jumper bay doors.</i>

348
00:20:56,514 --> 00:20:58,406
Come on, guys, stay in formation.

349
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:00,855
We can't afford any gaps.

350
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:05,502
Yeah, there you go. See?

351
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:06,647
<i>Not so hard.</i>

352
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,680
Jumpers, you should be in range

353
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:13,881
in three...

354
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,070
Two...

355
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:18,821
- One.
- Fire at will.

356
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:31,709
Nice shooting, people.

357
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:34,879
Too many of them coming in too fast.
We're not going to get them all.

358
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:36,714
Double up, fire four a-piece.

359
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:39,049
I can't control four drones
at the same time.

360
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:40,593
Just concentrate.

361
00:21:49,951 --> 00:21:51,630
- <i>Dammit!</i>
- Don't worry about it.

362
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:54,241
You were right. We can't get everything
on the first pass.

363
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:08,120
Have they destroyed enough asteroids
to clear a path?

364
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,580
We're about to find out.

365
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,433
- Well, now what?
- Well, on my mark,

366
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:19,508
you, Bolton, and Levine are gonna break
formation and head back to the City.

367
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,089
Take out anything that we missed.

368
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,340
Oh, that sounds important.
maybe someone else should--

369
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:24,510
Break!

370
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,606
<i>- You've a big one on your left.</i>
- I see it.

371
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:37,316
Impact in 10 seconds.

372
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:54,875
What was that?

373
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:56,748
Smaller pieces getting through.

374
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,091
Some of them evidently not so small.

375
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:05,344
Right now damage is confined
to the outer edge of the City.

376
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,141
Let's hope it stays that way.

377
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:15,741
All right, we're through.

378
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,940
Now we're gonna double back,
pick up any stragglers.

379
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:39,706
That's it.

380
00:23:40,748 --> 00:23:41,826
We made it.

381
00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:00,087
I can't believe that actually worked.
That was amazing.

382
00:24:00,195 --> 00:24:01,091
You did good.

383
00:24:01,202 --> 00:24:03,805
Zelenka and his team should
have the conduits repaired now, so...

384
00:24:03,938 --> 00:24:06,905
- Think we're finally out of the woods.
<i>- Colonel Sheppard, Dr. Mckay,</i>

385
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:09,660
<i>please report
to the control room immediately.</i>

386
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:11,261
Come on!

387
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:16,979
What the hell happened?

388
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:19,377
- The hyperdrive is offline.
- I thought it was good to go.

389
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,962
It was, but a few large pieces
of rock impacted the City,

390
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:23,672
and one control array was damaged.

391
00:24:24,388 --> 00:24:27,852
- We can't jump until we fix it.
- I told you I was no good at Asteroids.

392
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:40,105
The damaged conduits
are on the outer edge of the City,

393
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,131
which, sadly, is outside
of the protection of the shield.

394
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:45,176
We can use the transporters
to get us very close,

395
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:47,318
but it will still require a space walk.

396
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,316
- That shouldn't be too bad.
- It'll be a breeze,

397
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,408
with the exception
of the micro-asteroids.

398
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:53,675
- The what?
- We just came through an asteroid belt.

399
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:55,884
The big stuff's behind us,
but there's a bunch of

400
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:57,721
little bullet-sized rocks out there.

401
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,986
Tiny rock bullets. Great.

402
00:25:00,097 --> 00:25:02,255
- I'm sure you'll be fine.
- Then why aren't you going?

403
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,140
You've worked out
the details of the repair.

404
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,224
It will be a waste of time
getting me up to speed.

405
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:07,894
Speaking of time, how much do we have?

406
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,959
Well, once you're suited up...
15 minutes?

407
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:10,861
That's it?

408
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:12,804
Hey, if the patch-job
we did on the conduits

409
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:14,434
hadn't slowed down the power loss,

410
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,257
we'd have hit the deadline already.

411
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,774
You can do this.

412
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,623
Right.

413
00:25:33,817 --> 00:25:35,702
Mckay! I've been trying to reach you.

414
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:38,455
Well, trying to save the City
and whatnot. Look, how's Elizabeth?

415
00:25:38,535 --> 00:25:41,274
I want to talk to you. She's really bad.
In fact, she's so far gone,

416
00:25:41,385 --> 00:25:43,533
I don't think there's anything
we can do to heal her.

417
00:25:43,855 --> 00:25:46,088
Oh, my God. Are you sure?

418
00:25:46,168 --> 00:25:49,258
I've exhausted every medical
possibility, and none of it's worked.

419
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:52,344
- She... She's going to die?
- Well, I do

420
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:54,513
have one more idea,
but I need your help.

421
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,265
Me? What do you need me for?

422
00:25:58,085 --> 00:25:59,085
See those?

423
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:00,340
What are they?

424
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:03,083
Remember when Dr. Weir
was attacked by that Replicator,

425
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,964
- and he infected her--
- Nanites.

426
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:08,819
Carson was able to render them inert
using an electro-magnetic pulse.

427
00:26:09,122 --> 00:26:10,588
But they're still in her system.

428
00:26:11,207 --> 00:26:12,496
You're a genius.

429
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:16,076
Well, you know,
trying to save a life and whatnot.

430
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:20,748
<i>You wanna what?</i>

431
00:26:20,918 --> 00:26:22,646
Reactivate Weir's nanites.

432
00:26:22,758 --> 00:26:23,869
<i>That is a terrible,</i>

433
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:25,680
<i>terrible idea.</i>

434
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:28,005
What? I'd reprogram them.

435
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:30,304
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>John, we are losing her here.</i>

436
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:31,892
Keller's team has done everything.

437
00:26:32,003 --> 00:26:34,393
If I can reprogram the nanites
to help repair her body

438
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:37,347
- without triying to take over her br--
- <i>That's a big "if", isn't it?</i>

439
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:41,852
I'm fairly confident I can reprogram
them to do only what we want.

440
00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:43,780
<i>"Fairly confident"?</i>

441
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:45,457
<i>What if they come back online</i>

442
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,612
<i>and start communicating
with the other Replicators?</i>

443
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:51,594
<i>The last thing we need right now
is a bunch of robot warships showing up.</i>

444
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:54,323
Are you listening?
Look, I said I can reprogram them

445
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:56,000
<i>to be completely harmless.</i>

446
00:26:56,111 --> 00:26:59,244
<i>I am not having this conversation
until you're sure.</i>

447
00:27:01,072 --> 00:27:04,140
<i>I want to save Elizabeth
as much as anyone,</i>

448
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,087
<i>but she wouldn't want us
risking the City, not even for her.</i>

449
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:22,099
<i>That was the right call, by the way.</i>

450
00:27:22,983 --> 00:27:24,516
<i>Yeah, let's hope so.</i>

451
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:34,745
Any word from the Apollo?

452
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,001
No, not yet.

453
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,513
What you working on?

454
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:45,082
I'm actually trying to figure out a way
to find or contact Atlantis.

455
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,152
Well... They've obviously
veered off course, right?

456
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:50,857
Like, when was the last time
Atlantis' hyperdrives were used?

457
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:52,203
Like, a million years ago?

458
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:54,784
Who knows what that kind
of inactivity could have done to them.

459
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:58,391
I think it's more likely that they
jumped out of hyperspace too soon.

460
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,189
They were only flying with one ZPM.

461
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,724
Maybe McKay under-estimated
the power requirements.

462
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:03,989
Mckay?

463
00:28:05,001 --> 00:28:06,562
Either way, I know how to find them.

464
00:28:06,914 --> 00:28:08,063
- Really?
- Yeah,

465
00:28:08,143 --> 00:28:10,658
we do an AGB, an all gates bulletin.

466
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:12,886
It's like an all points bulletin,
only with Stargates.

467
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:14,568
- Oh, come on.
- No, no, really.

468
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:17,821
We'll create a program, we'll dial all
the Gates in the Pegasus Galaxy at once,

469
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:20,418
and try to establish
radio contact with Atlantis.

470
00:28:20,513 --> 00:28:22,244
But the Atlantis Gate is off the grid.

471
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:24,872
Right, but if they're close
to another Gate--

472
00:28:24,952 --> 00:28:26,915
Then they would have
contacted us by now.

473
00:28:29,045 --> 00:28:30,056
Yeah.

474
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:33,938
So... what have you come up with then?

475
00:28:34,074 --> 00:28:36,876
- Well, nothing yet, but--
- Well, at least I am trying.

476
00:28:36,986 --> 00:28:39,428
I'm generating ideas here. I just...

477
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:41,096
Sorry.

478
00:28:44,596 --> 00:28:46,291
<i>I'm actually surprised.</i>

479
00:28:46,701 --> 00:28:49,790
<i>The damage in this area
seems to be quite minimal.</i>

480
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:53,863
<i>I beg to differ.</i>

481
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:57,198
<i>Oh, my...</i>

482
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:16,840
<i>Let me guess...</i>

483
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,547
<i>The array is over there.</i>

484
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,433
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

485
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:27,312
<i>Great.</i>

486
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,806
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

487
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:40,665
<i>Micro-asteroid.</i>

488
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,551
<i>Right...</i>

489
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:45,485
<i>All right.</i>

490
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:48,013
<i>Looks like we're going to have to jump.</i>

491
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:51,512
- <i>But I can't jump 100 feet.</i>
- <i>We're in space, remember?</i>

492
00:29:51,621 --> 00:29:53,458
<i>It's not that far a distance.</i>

493
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:57,722
<i>Look, I'm gonna hook you up
with this tether.</i>

494
00:29:58,036 --> 00:29:59,103
<i>Okay?</i>

495
00:30:01,556 --> 00:30:04,471
<i>Then I'm gonna demagnetize your boots.</i>

496
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:09,581
- <i>Then I'm gonna throw you.</i>
- <i>Wait, what?</i>

497
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:11,987
<i>Then I'm gonna demag my boots</i>

498
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:13,968
<i>before the tether catches.</i>

499
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:17,693
<i>Your inertia should pull both of us
over the hole and onto the hallway.</i>

500
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:21,238
- <i>It'll be a cinch.</i>
- <i>But what if you miss?</i>

501
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:23,426
<i>You're just gonna have to trust me, Doc.</i>

502
00:30:23,548 --> 00:30:26,091
<i>Trust me as far
as I can throw you, actually.</i>

503
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:29,153
- <i>Very funny.</i>
- <i>All right, let's do this.</i>

504
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:13,486
<i>That was... was unbelievable.</i>

505
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,044
<i>Let's get to work.</i>

506
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:16,424
<i>All right.</i>

507
00:31:24,775 --> 00:31:26,046
How's it going?

508
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:28,267
Slowly.

509
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:31,035
Have you found a way
to reactivate the nanites safely?

510
00:31:31,144 --> 00:31:33,454
Short story, yes. Long story, no.

511
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,036
- What?
- I'm 100% certain

512
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:38,360
that I can reactivate the nanites
and have them help

513
00:31:38,456 --> 00:31:40,150
put Elizabeth back together.

514
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:43,611
- Okay...
- The problem is, that they would do it

515
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:46,741
by replacing her damaged cells
with replicated nanites,

516
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:49,106
which mean the moment
I tell them to turn inert again--

517
00:31:49,215 --> 00:31:51,328
those cells would stop functioning,
and she'd die.

518
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:52,454
Yeah.

519
00:31:52,851 --> 00:31:55,598
Good news, I've been able to
program in a way they wouldn't harm her,

520
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:56,883
I'm sure of that.

521
00:31:56,965 --> 00:32:00,272
Plus, I've shut down their ability
to contact the Replicators via subspace,

522
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:02,691
so both she and we would be safe,

523
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:03,840
but...

524
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:06,722
she'd be part Replicator
for the rest of her life.

525
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:08,991
Yeah, Sheppard's not gonna go for that.

526
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:11,895
There's a slight possibility
I might be able

527
00:32:11,991 --> 00:32:14,082
to make them help repair
her organic cells,

528
00:32:14,178 --> 00:32:16,260
and then shut down
when they're done, but...

529
00:32:16,345 --> 00:32:17,562
I'm gonna need more time.

530
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:22,149
Okay, well, I'll leave you to it then.
Good luck.

531
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:23,570
Thanks.

532
00:32:26,974 --> 00:32:29,406
<i>I'm sorry.
It's taking longer than I expected.</i>

533
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:32,044
<i>These gloves are making the work
so much slower.</i>

534
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:38,785
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

535
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,529
<i>We've still got four minutes
before the energy dips too low</i>

536
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:45,507
- <i>and we can't make the jump.</i>
- <i>So, no pressure then.</i>

537
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,384
Listen, they...

538
00:33:21,846 --> 00:33:23,732
They say you can't hear me,

539
00:33:25,057 --> 00:33:27,271
but I just... I just wanted to...

540
00:33:33,354 --> 00:33:35,417
I just wanted to thank you.

541
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:39,736
Thanks for letting me...

542
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:42,047
stay here a couple of years ago.

543
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,689
Because I don't know
if I would still be...

544
00:33:56,807 --> 00:33:58,297
Thank you, Dr. Weir.

545
00:34:03,587 --> 00:34:05,472
- What did I do?
- Nothing, it wasn't you,

546
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:07,140
but you need to leave.

547
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,300
Hang another bag of Manitol.

548
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:17,432
<i>You've been hit by a micro-asteroid.
Does it hurt?</i>

549
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,644
- <i>It doesn't.</i>
- <i>You're in shock.</i>

550
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:23,856
- <i>There's a hole in my suit.</i>
- <i>It's okay.</i>

551
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:27,025
<i>I've dialed up controls to create
positive pressure. I'm calling a Jumper.</i>

552
00:34:27,105 --> 00:34:29,282
- <i>I've got to get you to the OR.</i>
- <i>We can't leave yet.</i>

553
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:31,613
- <i>I have to finish the repairs.</i>
- <i>Tell me what to do.</i>

554
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:33,860
<i>It's too complicated.</i>

555
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:36,368
<i>I'm almost finished.</i>

556
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:40,531
<i>Please, help me turn around.</i>

557
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:47,212
- <i>Dr. Mckay?</i>
- What is it, Keller?

558
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:50,298
Elizabeth is crashing. If we're gonna do
this thing, we need to do it now.

559
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,850
- I need more time.
- <i>We don't have more time.</i>

560
00:34:52,946 --> 00:34:54,463
I can't keep her blood pressure up,

561
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,098
and if her ICP continues to climb,
there's no bringing her back.

562
00:35:00,816 --> 00:35:03,112
Okay, I'm transferring
the program to you now.

563
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,605
I'm on my way.

564
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:13,737
You know, the easiest thing to do if
they did fall out of hyperspace early

565
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,195
is to fly back over the path
between M12-578 and Atlantis.

566
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:20,370
Well, that'd take over a million years.
That's why we have hyperspace.

567
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,414
We could use the Apollo's
long-range sensors.

568
00:35:22,702 --> 00:35:25,375
Those long-range sensors,
they don't work in hyperspace.

569
00:35:25,455 --> 00:35:27,425
But we could
make a little jump, look around,

570
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:29,982
make another little jump,
look around... until we find them.

571
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:31,198
Yeah, that's good.

572
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:33,370
So using those sensors,

573
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:35,052
and conservatively,

574
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:36,881
we'd have to make...

575
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:39,834
180,000 little jumps.

576
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:41,891
It'd take a few years.

577
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:45,270
Unless they seriously augment
the long-range sensors.

578
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,791
Oh, who's going to do that?

579
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,024
It's not like they have
an Asgard on board.

580
00:35:49,783 --> 00:35:52,569
Feel like taking a little trip
to the Pegasus Galaxy?

581
00:35:54,818 --> 00:35:56,493
<i>Just some final adjustments.</i>

582
00:35:56,643 --> 00:35:59,322
<i>You're doing a great job, Radek.
I've called a Jumper.</i>

583
00:36:03,702 --> 00:36:04,768
<i>There.</i>

584
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,545
<i>I'm done.</i>

585
00:36:09,114 --> 00:36:11,219
Control room, this is Sheppard.

586
00:36:11,315 --> 00:36:14,883
<i>As soon as we get inside the shield,
activate the hyperspace jump.</i>

587
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:17,664
- I'm sorry, John, but we can't.
- <i>Why not?</i>

588
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,657
- <i>Zelenka just finished repairs.</i>
- Yes, I know,

589
00:36:20,753 --> 00:36:22,831
but we've just dropped below the line.

590
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,365
We don't have enough power.

591
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:42,644
- Is he going to be okay?
- I think so.

592
00:36:42,753 --> 00:36:44,996
- It didn't hit any major arteries.
- Lucky.

593
00:36:45,492 --> 00:36:48,249
I wouldn't say that. He's still
stuck here just like the rest of us.

594
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,918
So it's true.

595
00:36:50,312 --> 00:36:51,643
Finally fixed the hyperdrive,

596
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,090
now we don't have enough juice
to go anywhere.

597
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:56,132
We've only got 28 hours
before the shields fail.

598
00:36:56,212 --> 00:36:58,843
- So, what's the plan?
- I don't know, I got to find McKay.

599
00:36:59,103 --> 00:37:00,887
- He's in there.
- What?

600
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:03,613
Hey!

601
00:37:05,677 --> 00:37:07,850
I heard we didn't get the array
fixed in time.

602
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:10,543
- What were you doing in there?
- Look,

603
00:37:10,693 --> 00:37:11,940
she was dying, okay?

604
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:15,360
Look, her heart was weak,
her nervous system was fried.

605
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,611
What did you do?

606
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:22,652
- I reactivated the nanites.
- Damn it, McKay!

607
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:25,120
Look, you were busy!
It was life or death. If I didn't act--

608
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,704
Yes, she would have died, I know!

609
00:37:26,784 --> 00:37:29,833
I know what you're thinking, but helping
Elizabeth is not putting us at risk.

610
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:32,794
You just reactivated
the replicator nanites.

611
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:34,069
They're harmless.

612
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:37,294
I am 100% certain they're not gonna try
to take her over, or contact the others!

613
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:39,342
No, no, you can't know that for sure.

614
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:41,264
Yes. Yes, I can.

615
00:37:42,864 --> 00:37:43,847
Shut it down.

616
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,724
But... That would kill her.

617
00:37:46,926 --> 00:37:48,893
What would she want?
Do you think she'd want this?

618
00:37:48,973 --> 00:37:51,104
Yes. She'd sure as hell
do the same for you.

619
00:37:51,184 --> 00:37:52,831
Then you obviously didn't know her well.

620
00:37:53,075 --> 00:37:55,900
Maybe not, but you know what,
give it time, you can ask her herself--

621
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,888
No!

622
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:59,404
It's too dangerous.
Shut it down right now.

623
00:38:00,804 --> 00:38:02,073
No. No, I'm not going to.

624
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,770
Meyers...

625
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:12,463
Bring an EMP generator to the OR.

626
00:38:12,613 --> 00:38:14,210
Would you please just listen to me?

627
00:38:14,472 --> 00:38:15,879
Dr. Keller!

628
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,939
What's going on?

629
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:50,556
The quarantine is unnecessary.

630
00:38:50,652 --> 00:38:54,724
Well, you'll excuse me if I wait
for a second opinion.

631
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:56,228
Okay, this is stupid.

632
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,688
- What is?
- Us fighting.

633
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,841
Look, I know you're not happy with me,
and you may have some cause.

634
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:04,636
Anyway, it's not gonna matter
if we don't figure a way outta this.

635
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,685
Look, we have to work together, so...

636
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:12,031
So, so I'm... I'm sorry.

637
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,316
Apology accepted.

638
00:39:19,712 --> 00:39:20,833
All right.

639
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,438
- Well, someone should talk to her.
- Well, Teyla's in there.

640
00:39:26,709 --> 00:39:27,802
All right.

641
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:37,085
They shouldn't have done this.

642
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:40,171
<i>None of us wanted to lose you,
Elizabeth.</i>

643
00:39:41,388 --> 00:39:44,509
And what happens if the nanites are
able to contact the other Replicators?

644
00:39:44,709 --> 00:39:46,511
<i>Rodney does not believe
that is possible.</i>

645
00:39:48,214 --> 00:39:49,472
No, it's reckless.

646
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:51,863
<i>In my opinion...</i>

647
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:54,352
<i>It is well worth the risk.</i>

648
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:03,330
You have no idea
what I went through the last time.

649
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:05,612
Believe me...

650
00:40:06,944 --> 00:40:09,028
This is a very bad idea.

651
00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:26,276
What the hell are you doing up here?

652
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:29,898
Well, there's not much point sitting in
the infirmary waiting to die, is there?

653
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:32,890
All right, where do we stand?

654
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,967
We can forget about
subspace communications.

655
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:37,771
The main control array was
almost completely damaged by the beam.

656
00:40:38,685 --> 00:40:40,927
I do, however, have another idea.

657
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,074
Let's hear it.

658
00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:44,199
The reason why we cannot use
the power we have left

659
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:47,322
to execute a short jump into hyperspace
is that the City will not let us.

660
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:51,743
It's a safety protocol,
but I might be able to bypass it.

661
00:40:51,823 --> 00:40:53,036
What does that give us?

662
00:40:53,116 --> 00:40:54,218
Not much.

663
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,431
We wouldn't be able
to get to the Apollo,

664
00:40:56,527 --> 00:40:58,458
or be able to get
to the nearest Stargate, but

665
00:40:58,538 --> 00:41:01,830
we might be able to find
a habitable planet within range.

666
00:41:02,331 --> 00:41:04,088
I have my team running
sensor sweeps now.

667
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:06,076
He's conveniently leaving out
the reason why

668
00:41:06,171 --> 00:41:08,754
those safety protocols
are in place in the first place.

669
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:12,847
Yes, with insufficient power, there is
a chance that the City could be ripped

670
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:15,068
apart as we try
to enter the hyperspace window.

671
00:41:15,177 --> 00:41:16,351
What kind of chance?

672
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:18,561
50-50.

673
00:41:19,673 --> 00:41:22,653
Well, I got to tell you, Radek,
I'm not loving that idea.

674
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,150
Experimental Jumper.

675
00:41:28,905 --> 00:41:31,352
Remember I was zapped
by a machine a few months ago, I got...

676
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,525
Well, even smarter than I normally am?

677
00:41:33,642 --> 00:41:35,269
The one that almost killed you? Yeah.

678
00:41:35,364 --> 00:41:37,100
Before I was reset, I was very close

679
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,956
to giving one of our Jumpers
a hyperdrive.

680
00:41:39,036 --> 00:41:40,721
- Can you finish it?
- Yeah.

681
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:42,710
Yes, I probably can.

682
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,754
All right, great. We'll make a jump
to the Apollo, tell them where we are.

683
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:47,202
- No.
- Why no?

684
00:41:47,558 --> 00:41:50,343
Jumper's hyperdrive'd be limited.
We wouldn't be able to jump that far.

685
00:41:50,423 --> 00:41:51,768
How far then?

686
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,014
What do you think, like, two?

687
00:41:55,485 --> 00:41:57,768
Yeah. Two and change maybe?

688
00:41:57,863 --> 00:42:00,665
Conservatively, maybe 2000 light years.

689
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,508
This is a list of addresses
that are within range.

690
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:08,986
Right, we'll make trips and
ferry the crew to one of the planets.

691
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:10,113
Again, no.

692
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:12,407
- Why not?
- Well, the drive's never been tested.

693
00:42:12,487 --> 00:42:14,457
Yeah, we'd be lucky if we get two jumps.

694
00:42:14,552 --> 00:42:16,671
We'll make a return trip somewhere.

695
00:42:19,994 --> 00:42:22,452
Yeah, ideally, somewhere
with a few ZPMs to spare.

696
00:42:22,548 --> 00:42:24,721
We come back,
we get Atlantis fully powered.

697
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:26,379
Yeah, that'd be great.

698
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,464
M7R-227.

699
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:31,487
What's that?

700
00:42:32,307 --> 00:42:33,428
Well...

701
00:42:33,837 --> 00:42:35,596
There's a planet out there with ZPMs?

702
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,765
Yeah...

703
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:38,683
Yeah, we know they have a few ZPMs.

704
00:42:38,853 --> 00:42:40,101
And who would that be?

705
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,089
That?

706
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:45,385
That would be the Replicator homeworld.

707
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:48,776
You feel up to a heist?
