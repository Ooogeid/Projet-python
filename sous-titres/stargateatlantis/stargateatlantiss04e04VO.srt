1
00:00:04,489 --> 00:00:06,908
- What are we doin'?
- Exploring the Pegasus galaxy,

2
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:08,850
- it's what we do.
- <i>You know what I meant.</i>

3
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:11,231
There certainly doesn't
appear to be anything here

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,698
that would help in our fight against
the Wraith or the Replicators.

5
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:17,054
<i>Come on! You guys kill me!</i>

6
00:00:17,155 --> 00:00:18,766
<i>Planets are huge, you know!</i>

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,119
<i>Yeah, and usually
you're the one complaining.</i>

8
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:24,964
Yes, this enthusiasm
is most unlike you, Rodney.

9
00:00:25,054 --> 00:00:26,643
I'm turning over a new leaf.

10
00:00:26,732 --> 00:00:28,829
We did the standard
fly-over in the Jumper,

11
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:30,803
scanning for life signs... nothing.

12
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:34,251
You can't fly around for ten minutes
and decide there's nothing here!

13
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:35,333
Yes, I can.

14
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:37,200
<i>I'm getting strange energy readings.</i>

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,523
Yeah? From where?

16
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:41,218
I can't pinpoint the source.

17
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:44,318
The jungle's pretty thick, though
it could be hiding just about anything.

18
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:45,440
<i>I don't know.</i>

19
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:47,319
It's almost as if somebody in a warm,

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,266
cosy room typing onto their computer
sent us here for their own amusement.

21
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:53,519
You don't really think
Zelenka would do that?

22
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:55,234
If he did, he's gonna be sorry.

23
00:00:55,318 --> 00:00:58,440
Look, do you have any idea how many Gate
addresses there are in the Ancient

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,406
database that have
no accompanying description?

25
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:01,542
Forty-two.

26
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,454
No, I think
it's a little more than that.

27
00:01:03,534 --> 00:01:05,860
I don't really remember.
That's not the point. Nothing...

28
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,940
no information at all.
I say that has to mean something.

29
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:12,134
Maybe it means there's nothing worth
writing about on those planets.

30
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:15,070
Or there is, but the Ancients
are trying to hide it.

31
00:01:15,164 --> 00:01:16,168
From themselves?

32
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:18,797
A lot of time has passed
since the Ancients were around.

33
00:01:18,877 --> 00:01:21,628
Things change... maybe there's something
here they didn't know about.

34
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:23,588
You have a bet riding
on this, don't you?

35
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:24,891
What makes you say that?

36
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:30,446
Alright.

37
00:01:30,912 --> 00:01:31,913
That's it!

38
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:35,677
I'm calling this one.
Everyone back to the Jumper.

39
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:38,496
- Come on!
- Face it, McKay. You lost this one.

40
00:01:41,646 --> 00:01:43,079
Hello? What's that, then?

41
00:01:48,798 --> 00:01:51,842
<i>Looks like some kind of
natural crystalline growth.</i>

42
00:01:52,097 --> 00:01:54,339
<i>I think that's what might be
causing the energy readings.</i>

43
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:55,419
Pretty!

44
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,474
<i>Looks like one of those toys
you play with when you're a kid.</i>

45
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:00,142
What, Commodore 64?

46
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:01,919
Triple-barrelled shotgun?

47
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:05,362
- A kaleidoscope.
- You realise what this means?

48
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:07,932
We discovered
an alien fungus that glows.

49
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:10,694
How ‘bout a power source
that literally grows on trees?

50
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:16,503
Admittedly these energy readings
are pretty low level, but

51
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:19,745
if these crystals could be cultivated,
then... Wait. What are you doing?

52
00:02:25,988 --> 00:02:29,130
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine, just a little shock.

53
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,805
It could have been dangerous!
I told you it was giving off energy.

54
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:33,023
Honestly, I...

55
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:35,251
don't know why I did that.

56
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,949
- Well, you killed it!
- Oh, really?

57
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:42,851
- It's not giving off energy any more.
- Maybe he just scared it.

58
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:46,090
- You don't even know if it was alive.
- Seriously, why would you touch it?

59
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,916
I don't know!
I said that, OK? I just did.

60
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:52,027
Can we leave it at that?

61
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:54,613
OK, well there's gotta be
more of them around here.

62
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:58,366
I'm gonna recommend sending a science
team back here to check it out.

63
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:00,035
I am a science team!

64
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:06,223
OK, fine.

65
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:09,159
Let's desert a potentially
significant discovery

66
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:11,753
just because you guys don't want me
to win a bet with Zelenka.

67
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:17,492
All your scans are clear.

68
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:19,383
Blood tests are normal.

69
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:21,593
As far as I can tell,
you're in perfect health.

70
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:22,999
See? I told you.

71
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:26,102
- Thanks, Doc.
- No more touching strange things.

72
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:28,198
That's good advice.

73
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:31,465
I don't know about you,
but I'm exhausted.

74
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:34,077
- It's been a long day.
- Well, thanks for hangin' out.

75
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:35,406
Just wanted to be sure.

76
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,072
I'm fine.

77
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:38,810
Get some sleep.

78
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:42,441
Good night, John.

79
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,705

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,163
This is pretty good!

84
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:16,911
What is it?

85
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,657
I knew you two were
gonna eventually hook up.

86
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:22,763
We are not hooking up!

87
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:24,350
- It's just dinner.
<i>- I'm telling you,</i>

88
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:27,006
there's something in here
giving off a strange energy reading.

89
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:30,163
John, what are you doing?

90
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:32,362
Colonel Carter doesn't trust you.

91
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:34,754
No-one does but me.

92
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:37,006
What are you talking about?

93
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,609
What's wrong with you?

94
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,458
What do you mean? Nothing.

95
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:45,320
You've never been the same since you
got into the mind of that Wraith Queen.

96
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:47,224
What?

97
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:50,662
<i>Teyla!</i>

98
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:52,832
Father!

99
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,088
<i>I cannot even begin to tell you
how bizarre it was.</i>

100
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:20,652
- You want bizarre? Let me tell you...
- You know what? Don't.

101
00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:22,946
Morning.

102
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:28,184
What?

103
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:30,259
Teyla had a dream about you last night.

104
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:31,782
<i>Really?!</i>

105
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,431
What was it about?

106
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:36,529
Actually, it was more of a nightmare
and I'd rather not talk about it.

107
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:39,818
Was I the dashing hero saving you
from a big bad monster?

108
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:41,862
Actually, you were the big bad monster.

109
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,337
- Really?
- Like I said,

110
00:06:43,426 --> 00:06:44,865
I'd rather not talk about it.

111
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:47,254
Where are you going?

112
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:49,399
I'm sorry. I have a headache.

113
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:51,747
I did not sleep well last night.

114
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:56,162
Is she really mad at me?

115
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:00,547
I can't control what's in her dreams!

116
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:03,550
Really? You think you can't control
a person's dreams?

117
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,378
My father read me “Moby Dick"
when I was seven years old.

118
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:08,426
<i>Seriously, what was the man thinking?</i>

119
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:11,839
Do you have any idea how long I had
nightmares about being eaten by a whale?

120
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:14,547
- They haven't stopped, have they?
- No.

121
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,316
It's coming from outside.

122
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:22,227
I go to the opening, I hear darts.

123
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:25,582
I pull open the tent
and he comes inside.

124
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:28,056
I know it's not really Colonel Sheppard,

125
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,666
but I can't help but feel...
different towards him.

126
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:35,936
Do you think it's my subconscious
trying to tell me something?

127
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:38,942
If there's something real going on
between you and Col. Sheppard

128
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:42,359
that you feel you need to address,
you definitely should.

129
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:44,468
Otherwise don't let it bother you.

130
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:49,722
I've had horrible nightmares before

131
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:53,987
of my father being taken when
I was a little girl, the cullings since

132
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,254
but none of them have felt like this.

133
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,427
When I woke up,

134
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:00,482
I could barely catch my breath.

135
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:02,895
I know it sounds silly but

136
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:06,244
I think I am actually afraid
of falling asleep.

137
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:10,546
Well,

138
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,050
physically there's
nothing wrong with you,

139
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:14,847
other than the symptoms
you've described,

140
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:17,242
which can all be
attributed to lack of sleep.

141
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:20,093
These should help for the short term...

142
00:08:20,388 --> 00:08:21,388
but...

143
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:25,069
if the problem persists,
you definitely need to come back.

144
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:27,169
You have no idea how good the thought of

145
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:29,744
a solid night's sleep
makes me feel at this point.

146
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:33,309
I think I do. I'm not sure
I've had one since I got here.

147
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,795
Thank you.

148
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,826
Don't mention it. Have a good night.

149
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:37,945
<i>You too.</i>

150
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,697
<i>Doctor Keller,
we have a medical emergency.</i>

151
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:48,795
<i>Doctor Keller, please report
immediately to the infirmary.</i>

152
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:03,895
- What's wrong?
- It's Teyla.

153
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:06,872
She's in severe abdominal distress.
Says you gave her some medication.

154
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:09,598
I prescribed some Ambien
to help her sleep.

155
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:12,291
Went to the Mess for a late-night snack.

156
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:15,914
She started complaining about her
stomach and then she just doubled over.

157
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,582
I thought you were going to bed. Did you
take one of those pills I gave you?

158
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:21,851
OK, just try to relax.
Let me have a look.

159
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:26,171
Hold her for me.

160
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:33,754
Oh, my God.

161
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:39,191
Doctor, do something.

162
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:43,006
OK... we need to... sedate her

163
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,229
and...

164
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,977
Oh God!

165
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:57,279
Can you believe this?

166
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,153
Sorry, Doc. Didn't mean to scare you.

167
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:39,205
We were sparring and
I got in a lucky shot.

168
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:41,035
It's the middle of the night!

169
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,599
Maybe for you.

170
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:45,202
Sit down. Let me have a look.

171
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:51,313
You're gonna need stitches.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,715
Guess I taught him too much, huh?

173
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:54,980
<i>Yeah, I guess so.</i>

174
00:10:56,225 --> 00:10:58,063
You don't need
to stick around. I'm fine.

175
00:10:58,182 --> 00:10:59,412
- You sure?
- Yeah.

176
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,285
I want a re-match tomorrow, though.

177
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,828
That's what I was afraid of.

178
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:04,824
G'night!

179
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,279
See you tomorrow.

180
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:10,627
Something wrong?

181
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,571
No, no, nothing.

182
00:11:15,348 --> 00:11:17,367
I don't think he's seeing anyone,
you know.

183
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:18,570
Oh, oh, no!

184
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:20,576
No, that's quite alright.

185
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:24,257
You know, this would be
easier if you lay down.

186
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:26,171
OK.

187
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:57,222
Hello?

188
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:08,668
Is anyone here?

189
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:24,967
Anyone?

190
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:07,933
Hey, buddy.

191
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:10,106
What are you runnin' from?

192
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:11,977
I don't know.

193
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,662
Come on.

194
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:44,378
I'm really sorry.
Did I... did I hurt you?

195
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:49,681
No, no. I'm... I'm sorry.

196
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:51,796
I didn't mean to...

197
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:53,368
You fell asleep.

198
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:56,170
I was having the strangest dream.

199
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:58,089
You sure you're OK?

200
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:01,442
Yeah.

201
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:03,233
Go ahead.

202
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:05,778
I'm almost done.

203
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:12,776
<i>It was terrifying.</i>

204
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,242
There you were
with this disgusting alien bug

205
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:17,983
crawling out of your stomach,
and colonel Sheppard was acting like

206
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,966
it was the coolest thing he'd ever seen.

207
00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:22,828
- That sounds like that movie.
- Yeah, Alien. Have you seen it?

208
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:24,624
Colonel Sheppard speaks of it often.

209
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:26,440
I still remember
the first time I saw it.

210
00:14:26,522 --> 00:14:28,401
I certainly did not think it was cool.

211
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:29,782
One time, in med school,

212
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:32,080
I made the mistake
of confiding to my partner

213
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,592
in biology class that it had caused
my all-time worst nightmares.

214
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:37,888
He actually planted a live snake

215
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:39,788
inside a cadaver I was working on.

216
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:41,501
Well, I never saw it as a kid.

217
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,467
I knew from the poster it was going
to be too scary. No, I was 16

218
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:47,955
when a neighborhood theater had a

219
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:49,299
horror revival festival.

220
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,929
I thought, great, you know, date movie.

221
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,808
So, Jocelyn Rutger,
third period science.

222
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:57,379
Bit of geek, but she had a great...

223
00:14:58,016 --> 00:15:01,491
Anyway, you know how girls get
all scared and curl up on your shoulder?

224
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:03,870
Your planet has some
truly strange rituals.

225
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:05,523
Anyway, I eat when I get nervous.

226
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:07,236
Really? I hadn't noticed.

227
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,417
So...

228
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:11,427
very tense, working like a charm.
Jocelyn's all freaked out beside me,

229
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:13,654
I'm packing away the goobers
and the popcorn,

230
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:16,525
and then the alien
bursts out of John Hurt.

231
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:19,412
- You didn't.
- Puked all over her.

232
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,661
I have got to see this movie.

233
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:26,727
Don't you think it's strange each of us
has had incredibly vivid nightmares

234
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:29,562
with colonel Sheppard
being somehow an integral part?

235
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:31,604
Acting most unlike colonel Sheppard.

236
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:32,899
Not me.

237
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:34,923
Have you had any nightmares recently?

238
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:37,870
Not a night goes by.
Last night, I dreamt that colonel Carter

239
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,590
invited me to her quarters for dinner.

240
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,655
Maybe you shouldn't be
telling us this, Rodney.

241
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:44,420
Yeah, I said nightmare,
not delusional male fantasy.

242
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,844
Wait and listen.

243
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,525
Turns out she was serving lemon chicken.

244
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,280
I mean, lemon, and the only reason
she invited me was to tell me

245
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,057
that she was promoting Zelenka over me.

246
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:54,848
That's it?

247
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:58,233
Then I was eaten by a whale.
Don't ask how that happened.

248
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:00,625
Okay, do you guys really think
I'm crazy?

249
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,858
I realize they're just dreams, but...

250
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:06,035
First it was Teyla, then right after
you came to see me, I had one.

251
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,196
And that's when mine stopped. Those
pills you gave me knocked me out cold.

252
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:11,269
And then Ronon had one
while I was working on him.

253
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:15,231
What's the big deal? It's like you said,
it's just a few bad dreams, right?

254
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:24,952
I shouldn't have bothered you with this.

255
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:27,003
I know I don't really
have any hard evidence.

256
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,122
Believe me, I've seen
a good hunch go a long way

257
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:30,967
in some pretty crazy circumstances.

258
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,000
I'd always rather you were on your toes,
especially with anything suspicious.

259
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:38,036
I know a few bad dreams
isn't that significant.

260
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,083
It's only natural, given what we face
on a daily basis, but...

261
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:44,185
this was different.
It really rattled me.

262
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:48,950
Coupled with the sequential pattern.
First Teyla, then me, then Ronon, all

263
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,537
with col. Sheppard being a significant
negative presence in our dreams.

264
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:56,027
- Do you have any idea what's behind it?
- No, I don't know.

265
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:59,147
Thing is, it started right after colonel
Sheppard touched that crystal

266
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,685
on M3X-387.

267
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:02,368
I thought you cleared him medically.

268
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:03,583
- I did...
- Excuse me.

269
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:05,977
There's an emergency situation
in the crew quarters atrium.

270
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:07,953
Security was called for
and has been dispatched.

271
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,589
Thank you. Excuse me.

272
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,904
Put down the gun, Major.

273
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,046
- Let's talk this out.
- Someone, get an ARG.

274
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:21,769
Now. Shoot him with it.

275
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,297
Major, talk to me.
Tell me what's going on.

276
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:25,402
Just do it!

277
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:29,637
Okay, what's the harm? I mean,
if he's human, it won't hurt him, right?

278
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:32,300
- John, what is he talking about?
- Don't talk to him.

279
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,102
Colonel Sheppard is a Replicator.

280
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,180
Look, Lorne, I don't know
what's gotten into you...

281
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:49,746
Me? No, no, no, no, it's not me.

282
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:52,644
Major, how about you lower your weapon?

283
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:53,903
He's a Replicator!

284
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:58,199
You don't believe me?
I'll shoot him, you'll see.

285
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:03,482
That won't be necessary. I've got my
hands up in a very non-threatening way.

286
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:05,134
<i>I've called for an ARG.</i>

287
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:07,885
You believe him?

288
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:11,241
Of course not, but it won't hurt you,
and it might help him to lower his gun.

289
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:12,910
You're one of them, too.

290
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:17,450
But don't just stand there!
Shoot them. Shoot both of them!

291
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:32,632
I take it I don't have to shoot
either of you with this?

292
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:38,944
<i>I'm so glad no one was hurt.</i>

293
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:41,170
- And you don't remember anything?
<i>- No.</i>

294
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:44,547
<i>Honestly, I haven't had a sleepwalking
incident since I was, like, 10.</i>

295
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:48,111
It's quite common for someone
suffering from somnambulism

296
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,499
to perform complex activities
in their sleep

297
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:52,527
and remember nothing upon waking.

298
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:56,642
So you think this has something to do
with the crystal I touched?

299
00:18:57,256 --> 00:19:00,326
That's when it seemed to start.
Major Lorne's not the only one.

300
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,795
In each case,
the person being affected reports you

301
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:06,170
being a significant negative presence
in the nightmare.

302
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:08,070
Well, I can't control that.

303
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,394
No, but maybe something is.

304
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:15,454
What? You think someone's
impersonating me in their dreams?

305
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,301
Look, I've seen more than my share of
alien entities that are capable of this.

306
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:21,908
Colonel O'Neill was once
knocked unconscious

307
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:24,075
by an energy being that lived
in crystal form.

308
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:26,150
<i>It took on his appearance for a while.</i>

309
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:28,883
I read at one point, you were taken over
by an alien entity.

310
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:31,092
Yeah.

311
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:32,937
Not a personal highlight.

312
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,490
The question is, what's the point?

313
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:37,349
Maybe it's feeding on our fear.

314
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:43,795
- I'll shut up.
- No, no, it's not that big a leap.

315
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:44,921
It's just...

316
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:46,655
We don't have any proof.

317
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:47,950
<i>First, it was Teyla.</i>

318
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:52,197
I was next, and then Ronon
after I treated him...

319
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:56,207
Well, I'm the one who touched the
crystal, and I've never had a bad dream.

320
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:59,049
Maybe that's why you're appearing
in everyone's dreams.

321
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,087
Whatever's doing this imprinted
your image onto itself.

322
00:20:04,276 --> 00:20:06,856
Now that I think about it,
it's possible whatever this is,

323
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:09,131
its spread may be limited by touch.

324
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:12,271
Okay, anyone who's had contact
with major Lorne,

325
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:14,136
since the incident needs to be isolated.

326
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:18,899
<i>If this is some sort of alien influence,
we have to find a way to detect it.</i>

327
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,272
Sit down, Rodney.

328
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:26,950
I'm good right here, thank you.

329
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:29,034
<i>All off-world teams have been contacted</i>

330
00:20:29,114 --> 00:20:31,341
and instructed not to return
for the time being.

331
00:20:31,568 --> 00:20:35,528
Gate travel will be restricted to an as-
needed basis, and until further notice,

332
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:38,910
all non-essential expedition members
will be restricted to quarters.

333
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:40,851
Come on, is this really necessary?

334
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:43,418
- It's just a few bad dreams, right?
<i>- The fact is,</i>

335
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:45,960
we don't really know
what we're dealing with.

336
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:48,051
We may have an alien entity on our hands

337
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,637
capable of moving
from person to person at will.

338
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:54,829
<i>And so far, the only behavior we have
to evaluate, suggests a certain malice.</i>

339
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:56,635
Based on what's been described to me,

340
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:59,527
the personification of colonel Sheppard
in everyone's dreams

341
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:01,893
is behaving much like a sociopath.

342
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:03,584
Did I have a goatee?

343
00:21:03,668 --> 00:21:05,900
<i>Right now, all it's doing
is causing some nightmares,</i>

344
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,929
but we don't know if that's
the limit of its capability.

345
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,981
You're saying
this is only the beginning.

346
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:13,949
I've never profiled
anything like this before.

347
00:21:14,335 --> 00:21:15,610
<i>It will likely progress,</i>

348
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,036
try to drive up the stakes,
seek bigger thrills.

349
00:21:18,438 --> 00:21:22,097
<i>Now, even if it's limited to
manipulating the host's subconscious,</i>

350
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:25,255
it may be able to put someone
in serious jeopardy.

351
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:27,409
So, what are we talking,
Freddy Krueger here?

352
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:31,108
Oh, come on! We don't have a single
shred of hard evidence here.

353
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:33,211
I mean, until we do,
this thing is just a bogeyman.

354
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,989
Exactly why you're
going back to the planet

355
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,831
where colonel Sheppard
touched the crystal.

356
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:39,369
- What? Why would we do that?
- <i>Well, just as you said,</i>

357
00:21:39,571 --> 00:21:40,972
to gather some hard evidence,

358
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:43,747
see if there are any more
of these things.

359
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:45,950
<i>We need to find out
exactly what they are,</i>

360
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:48,191
<i>and how they work,</i> <i>and if possible,</i>

361
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:51,623
how to detect if there really is
something inside Lorne right now.

362
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:54,259
<i>Thank you.</i>

363
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:01,018
But-but you said no more Gate travel.

364
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,658
I thought that was a wise decision.

365
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,830
I said on an as-needed basis, McKay.
I think this qualifies.

366
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,858
Yeah, but don't you think
a science team would be

367
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,457
- better suited for...
- You are a science team, remember?

368
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,779
Okay, fine,
but it's a big planet, you know.

369
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,534
We could really use some more manpower.

370
00:22:17,121 --> 00:22:19,484
<i>I still can't believe
you're making me do this.</i>

371
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:21,020
<i>Ah, you lost the bet.</i>

372
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:23,628
<i>There's definitely
something on this planet.</i>

373
00:22:23,712 --> 00:22:25,612
<i>Yes, but I distinctly said "of value."</i>

374
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:28,846
<i>I hardly call this
particular discovery valuable.</i>

375
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:31,334
<i>Over here.</i>

376
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:35,621
<i>There you go.</i>

377
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,908
<i>Better get started.</i>

378
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:39,480


379
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,354
<i>"Better get started." Yeah, sure!</i>

380
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:43,081
<i>Rodney...</i>

381
00:22:44,707 --> 00:22:45,707
<i>Don't look in it,</i>

382
00:22:45,894 --> 00:22:47,694
<i>and whatever you do, don't touch it.</i>

383
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:49,473
<i>I wasn't even thinking about it.</i>

384
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:51,581
<i>Radek, we got a live one here.</i>

385
00:22:52,732 --> 00:22:54,605
<i>It could be useful to compare the two.</i>

386
00:22:54,688 --> 00:22:57,719
<i>- That's just what I was thinking.
- But be careful. It could be dangerous</i>

387
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:59,807
<i>to try to harvest one
with an active entity in it.</i>

388
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:01,930
<i>Once again, you've read my mind.
However,</i>

389
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:04,155
<i>when you're finished there,
I say you give it a shot.</i>

390
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:10,577
<i>Yeah, give it a shot.</i>

391
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:17,405
You really think it was safe
to bring a live one back?

392
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:19,684
<i>Those containment tanks
are non-conductive.</i>

393
00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:22,953
We believe it needs conductive
material in order to travel.

394
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,907
And having an active crystal

395
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:28,375
allows us to calibrate
these hand-held sensors

396
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,174
to detect the energy signatures
associated with it.

397
00:23:31,255 --> 00:23:32,858
<i>Hopefully, we'll determine if someone</i>

398
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,930
is carrying one of these creatures
inside of them.

399
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:36,771
As long as it doesn't know
what we're up to.

400
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:39,436
Otherwise, it would just transfer
before we could scan them.

401
00:23:39,516 --> 00:23:42,680
<i>You're assuming they're not only
capable, but conscious and aware.</i>

402
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,623
It's demonstrated some pretty
sophisticated intelligence so far.</i>

403
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:48,109
<i>You think it would have
basic avoidance skills.</i>

404
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:51,454
We're gonna have to modify our scanners
to operate at a range large enough to...

405
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:52,828
Wait a minute.

406
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:55,124
We could calibrate
the City-wide life-signs detector...

407
00:23:55,204 --> 00:23:57,971
<i>Oh, yes, Mr. Wizard, we're just
going to snap our fingers and...</i>

408
00:23:58,706 --> 00:23:59,804
<i>What are you doing?</i>

409
00:24:00,517 --> 00:24:01,722
I don't know, it's...

410
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:03,419
It's mesmerizing.

411
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:05,388
You said it was safe.

412
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:07,495
We said we think. Still...

413
00:24:07,757 --> 00:24:10,207
I don't know what I was doing.
I can't believe it...

414
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,063
I was suddenly overcome by
the compulsion to want to touch it.

415
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:15,065
Yeah, we think that's how it...

416
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:16,451
ropes in its victims.

417
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:36,394
It's not in him.

418
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:39,827
You said the entity needed
conductive material to travel, right?

419
00:24:39,907 --> 00:24:41,128
Well, based on the...

420
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:43,466
It's the power conduits.

421
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:45,440
They run through the entire City.

422
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,683
It could be in anyone.

423
00:24:49,808 --> 00:24:51,554
Kate, what are you doing?

424
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:53,650
I don't want to die.

425
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:55,452
Good.

426
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:57,001
Come down from there.

427
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:03,036
I can't.

428
00:25:03,964 --> 00:25:04,964
Why not?

429
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,285
Help me, please!

430
00:25:10,202 --> 00:25:11,264
John, stop it.

431
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:12,934
Stop it. I have to help her!

432
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:15,177
What are you doing?
John, get out of the way!

433
00:25:17,245 --> 00:25:19,287
<i>- Teyla!</i>
- Kate!

434
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:38,111
She did not report for duty
and I can't wake her up.

435
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,096
She's dead.

436
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:12,002
<i>This is colonel Carter.</i>

437
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:14,302
<i>If I could have your attention, please.</i>

438
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,640
<i>I'm very sorry to have to tell you
that we have lost</i>

439
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:19,870
<i>a valuable member
of the expedition today.</i>

440
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:24,257
<i>Dr. Kate Heightmeyer meant
a great deal to all of us.</i>

441
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:27,399
<i>Her death is nothing short of tragic.</i>

442
00:26:29,352 --> 00:26:30,797
<i>I'm also sorry to have to report</i>

443
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:33,098
<i>that the threat we face
is still in our midst,</i>

444
00:26:33,322 --> 00:26:34,559
<i>and until further notice,</i>

445
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:37,514
<i>the full lockdown protocol
will remain in effect.</i>

446
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:40,509
<i>Try to remain calm.</i>

447
00:26:41,026 --> 00:26:44,379
<i>We are doing everything we can
to ensure everyone's safety</i>

448
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:47,001
<i>and to resolve this situation quickly.</i>

449
00:26:49,078 --> 00:26:50,162
<i>Thank you.</i>

450
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:58,659
That was good.

451
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,286
I mean,

452
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,196
horrible, obviously.

453
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:05,340
Terrifying and horrible, but I just...

454
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:08,077
I meant you sounded strong.

455
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:12,876
I'm sure they were at least
a little reassured hearing your voice,

456
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:16,112
but you don't need me to tell you that.

457
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,624
A day like this, it doesn't hurt.

458
00:27:22,762 --> 00:27:23,849
Thanks.

459
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:41,572
I was just about to come to see you,

460
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,235
but I wasn't sure
if you wanted to see me.

461
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,747
Colonel Carter? Excuse me.

462
00:28:03,828 --> 00:28:06,055
I think I've managed to calibrate
the city-wide sensors.

463
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:12,296
I mean, if it is working properly.

464
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,646
We had some trouble with the...

465
00:28:14,851 --> 00:28:15,876
Well...

466
00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:19,368
We have a positive reading.

467
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,283
Do we know who that is?

468
00:28:30,218 --> 00:28:31,529
What do you need me for?

469
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:33,334
What's with the rubber walls?

470
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:34,788
I'm sorry, Rodney.

471
00:28:35,002 --> 00:28:36,082
I have to go.

472
00:28:37,337 --> 00:28:39,309
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

473
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,027
It's in Rodney?

474
00:28:57,577 --> 00:28:59,944
The isolation room has been lined
with insulating material

475
00:29:00,065 --> 00:29:02,995
to prevent the entity from transferring
out of him and into someone else.

476
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:06,105
If we're right, we've got it trapped.

477
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:08,883
Yeah, well, that doesn't help
McKay much, does it?

478
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:10,823
If this thing kills people
in their sleep...

479
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:13,562
No. We've got to find a way
to get it out of him.

480
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,804
<i>Someone want to get me some coffee?
I'm already feeling a little tired here.</i>

481
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:20,137
I could give him something to keep him
awake for a while, but it'll only work

482
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:23,256
for so long before we start putting him
at risk of pulmonary failure.

483
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:26,258
Believe it or not,
I've been there before, too.

484
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,941
Do what you can.
We'll try to come up with something.

485
00:29:29,948 --> 00:29:31,152
Hang in there, McKay!

486
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:34,247
<i>Oh, thanks. Like I have much choice.</i>

487
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:48,403
Do you think it knows it's trapped?

488
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:49,520
I don't know, why?

489
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:54,838
Maybe there's a way to...

490
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:58,208
I don't know, reason with it.

491
00:29:59,227 --> 00:30:01,810
Being in Dr. Weir's old office
made you think of that, didn't it?

492
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,956
Normally I just shoot the bad guys.

493
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,414
- We just heard.
- There must to be something we can do.

494
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:09,182
That's what we're talking about.

495
00:30:09,962 --> 00:30:13,292
Okay, let's say for a second that
you could somehow communicate with it.

496
00:30:13,554 --> 00:30:16,561
- What were you planning on saying?
- I don't know, I hadn't gone that far.

497
00:30:16,752 --> 00:30:19,880
It strikes me that if it feeds
on fear, or worse,

498
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:22,368
likes the thrill of killing
its host, then...

499
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:26,058
Well, it would take
the last chance it had.

500
00:30:26,263 --> 00:30:27,268
To kill McKay.

501
00:30:31,277 --> 00:30:32,421
<i>What about survival?</i>

502
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:33,956
It's trapped.

503
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:36,967
Will it die without
a living host to transfer to?

504
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:38,842
I was hoping not to find out.

505
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:41,513
We could give it a chance to leave.
Go home.

506
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:43,848
- Back into the crystal.
<i>- Yeah, sure, why not?</i>

507
00:30:44,314 --> 00:30:46,570
Send it through the Gate
back to its planet.

508
00:30:46,893 --> 00:30:49,679
I've heard of people being talked
through waking dreams before.

509
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:51,455
Maybe...

510
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,692
Maybe McKay can be hypnotized

511
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:56,445
<i>into a state where he could somehow
communicate with it.</i>

512
00:30:56,713 --> 00:30:59,665
He has successfully meditated
into an altered state before.

513
00:30:59,802 --> 00:31:01,736
Yeah, that was after
he was genetically altered.

514
00:31:01,845 --> 00:31:03,472
I'm sorry, what?

515
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,012
You want McKay
to ask this thing to leave?

516
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:10,250
We are talking about McKay.

517
00:31:10,345 --> 00:31:12,294
Scary things are not exactly
his strength.

518
00:31:12,468 --> 00:31:13,862
And he is up against a creature

519
00:31:13,944 --> 00:31:16,089
apparently capable of
manipulating his subconscious.

520
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:19,205
I wish there was a way
for one of us to get in there.

521
00:31:20,568 --> 00:31:21,892
Into McKay's dreams?

522
00:31:22,074 --> 00:31:23,424
Yeah, you know,

523
00:31:23,504 --> 00:31:25,529
help him out,
give him a little moral support.

524
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:27,204
<i>Come on,</i>

525
00:31:27,706 --> 00:31:29,930
<i>All the things you've seen,
you've never come across</i>

526
00:31:30,051 --> 00:31:33,148
a way for one person to get
into another person's dreams?

527
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,830
Where's she going? What's going on?

528
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:40,595
I don't know, but I think

529
00:31:41,577 --> 00:31:44,492
I'm about to see a side of McKay
I never wanted to see.

530
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,703
It does not have to be you.

531
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:48,830
Yeah, well, it's my bad idea.

532
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:51,626
What was?

533
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,212
What...

534
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:56,440
<i>We first encountered
the technology 10 years ago</i>

535
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,372
<i>on a planet where
the survivors of a holocaust</i>

536
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:01,516
were living entirely in a virtual world
created in their minds.

537
00:32:02,016 --> 00:32:03,612
Since then, we've managed to modify it

538
00:32:03,694 --> 00:32:05,847
for use in the VR training
of SG team members.

539
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:09,718
It only took some minor calibrations
to tune it in to subconscious activity.

540
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:13,185
So Sheppard is actually going to see
McKay's dreams?

541
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,038
Well,

542
00:32:15,312 --> 00:32:18,359
to be honest, the technology is
untested for use in this manner.

543
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,618
Dreams are much more random
than conscious thought.

544
00:32:22,151 --> 00:32:24,043
It may be difficult
for the system to translate

545
00:32:24,164 --> 00:32:27,384
what's going on in McKay's brain so that
colonel Sheppard can understand it.

546
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,917
I'm just hoping that the two of them
will be able to interact somehow.

547
00:32:38,895 --> 00:32:40,078
You sure about this?

548
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,300
Not really.

549
00:32:43,723 --> 00:32:44,858
I'm pretty screwed up.

550
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:46,238
You're telling me.

551
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:48,213
<i>We're ready if you are.</i>

552
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:51,858
Thanks.

553
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:54,228
I haven't done anything yet.

554
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:56,967
For trying,
and don't say I didn't warn you.

555
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,906
<i>Administering sedative.</i>

556
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,832
Nothing's happening here.

557
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,433
<i>He's not dreaming yet.</i>

558
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:44,015
Oh, boy.

559
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:45,510
Nice whale.

560
00:33:45,715 --> 00:33:48,143
Nice whale, you're my friend.
You don't want to eat me.

561
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:49,954
<i>Give up.</i>

562
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:51,781
You'll never make it.

563
00:33:53,312 --> 00:33:54,930
- You're too weak.
- Oh, thank you.

564
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:56,874
Thanks for the encouragement.
Way to help out.

565
00:33:56,964 --> 00:33:58,467
Why would I want to help you?

566
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:01,806
- Because I thought you...
- That's not me, Rodney.

567
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:03,208
Don't listen to him.

568
00:34:05,031 --> 00:34:07,874
You're pathetic.
You might as well jump in.

569
00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:11,411
Don't be afraid.

570
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:15,089
Oh, God, I have to get back.

571
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,975
I have to get back. It's my only chance.

572
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,857
You're going to die out here.

573
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:22,014
Shut up! Don't listen to him, Rodney.

574
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,441
That's easy for you to say!
Why don't you help me row?

575
00:34:29,754 --> 00:34:30,772
You know,

576
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,611
this really isn't as strange
as you lead me to believe.

577
00:34:33,794 --> 00:34:35,831
Oh, yeah? What about that?

578
00:34:39,365 --> 00:34:40,836
I hate clowns.

579
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:47,674
You can paddle all you want.
You're not going anywhere.

580
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:50,318
He's right! I'm going to die out here!

581
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:52,825
He wants you to be afraid.
Don't give him what he wants!

582
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:54,516
He can't really hurt you.

583
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:56,817
That's where you're wrong.

584
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:06,952
- What happened?
<i>- Clear.</i>

585
00:35:11,046 --> 00:35:12,291
<i>He's in cardiac arrest.</i>

586
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:25,358
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

587
00:35:25,777 --> 00:35:27,076
<i>I've done all I can.</i>

588
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:29,890
<i>He's dead.</i>

589
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:05,528
This is all your fault, John.

590
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,200
If you hadn't touched that stupid rock,
McKay would still be alive right now.

591
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:12,663
I thought you were going to help him.

592
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:14,336
I tried.

593
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:16,678
Some friend you are.

594
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:19,960
Colonel, you've been compromised.
I'm relieving you of duty.

595
00:36:25,757 --> 00:36:27,025
Son of a bitch.

596
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,019
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

597
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:44,267
<i>- Just try to relax.</i>
- What's going on?

598
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:45,897
<i>You were in cardiac arrest.</i>

599
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:48,383
The entity...

600
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:50,152
<i>It's in colonel Sheppard.</i>

601
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:05,261
You can quit now.

602
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:06,793
I'm not afraid of you.

603
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:08,301
Oh, yes, you are.

604
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:11,140
I'm the one thing you are afraid of.

605
00:37:12,214 --> 00:37:13,613
You failed your friends.

606
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:18,053
You brought this on them
and there is nothing you can do

607
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:19,944
to stop it!

608
00:38:33,836 --> 00:38:35,713
<i>His heart rate is dangerously high.</i>

609
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,573
Can you wake him up?

610
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:41,766
<i>I could try, but in his physical state,
that could make things worse.</i>

611
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:43,873
<i>Yes, and the entity
would still be in him.</i>

612
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:47,506
Hook me up to him again.

613
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:25,343
Get up.

614
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:28,568
Come on, John.

615
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:30,165
Fight!

616
00:39:30,649 --> 00:39:31,649
No.

617
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,550
That's what you want.

618
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:36,136
It's your fault Heightmeyer's dead.

619
00:39:36,638 --> 00:39:38,586
Your fault McKay is dead!

620
00:39:39,523 --> 00:39:40,620
<i>I'm not dead.</i>

621
00:39:53,551 --> 00:39:54,764
You can't win.

622
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:57,505
Yes, we can.
You're vulnerable to electric shock.

623
00:39:57,652 --> 00:40:00,971
That's why I'm still alive. You left
before you could finish the job!

624
00:40:05,023 --> 00:40:06,250
What the hell was that?

625
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:43,275
Which one are you?

626
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:45,339
Me.

627
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:47,212
Good you or bad you?

628
00:40:47,604 --> 00:40:48,596
Me, me.

629
00:40:50,277 --> 00:40:51,277
Is that...

630
00:40:51,558 --> 00:40:52,605
You, you?

631
00:40:53,274 --> 00:40:54,274
I think so.

632
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:57,664
Thanks.

633
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:00,752
Okay, this is really weird.

634
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:02,942
You're telling me.

635
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,825
I thought there'd be more... hot girls.

636
00:41:07,904 --> 00:41:08,904
Yeah.

637
00:42:00,904 --> 00:42:01,860
<i>Hey!</i>

638
00:42:02,088 --> 00:42:03,335
<i>I have an idea.</i>

639
00:42:03,415 --> 00:42:04,873
<i>How about we get out of here?</i>

640
00:42:06,002 --> 00:42:07,472
<i>Sounds like a plan.</i>

641
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:22,963
Couldn't sleep.

642
00:42:23,055 --> 00:42:24,323
Yeah, me too.

643
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,222
Thought I'd have
a little snack before I...

644
00:42:31,554 --> 00:42:33,079
Yeah, we couldn't sleep either.
