<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:06,985
<i>I could easily bring
another 12 ships to the battle.</i>

3
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:10,040
<i>12 ships,
willing to fight shoulder to shoulder?</i>

4
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:13,962
<i>For a chance to destroy the Replicators
once and for all? Of course.</i>

5
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,576
- What did you do?
- What are you referring to?

6
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:20,689
- There's a ship on the way.
- Ah, they picked up my signal.

7
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:22,358
Subspace tracking device.

8
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,778
- Hello? Is anybody here?
- What happened?

9
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:26,946
My people,

10
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:28,239
they are gone.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,586
Searched the entire planet,
no life-signs.

12
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:31,785
I will find them.

13
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:34,453
And we're gonna help you, but you
gotta rest, get your strength back.

14
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:36,348
Whoever did this will pay.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,635
I will make certain of it.

16
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:51,302
I'm so sorry, Teyla.

17
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:55,775
Kanaan was a good man.
He would have made a wonderful father.

18
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:00,390
I really thought I could save him.

19
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,106
<i>You did everything you could.</i>

20
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,938
That's all anybody can ask for.

21
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,943
He's at peace now.

22
00:01:19,256 --> 00:01:20,073
All right.

23
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:22,224
I'm ready.

24
00:02:11,654 --> 00:02:12,666
Teyla...

25
00:02:14,447 --> 00:02:16,092
- Teyla!
- He's still alive!

26
00:02:16,258 --> 00:02:18,682
Help me, Teyla, please!
Please help me!

27
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:20,476
He's still alive!
Let me go!

28
00:02:20,638 --> 00:02:23,394
- Teyla, it's too late.
- Help me, Teyla!

37
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:54,946
As you know, for some time now,
we've been tracking what appears to be

38
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:57,407
a new sickness in the Pegasus galaxy.

39
00:03:58,098 --> 00:04:00,121
We don't know exactly
when or where it started,

40
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:03,000
but so far we've encountered it
on seven different planets.

41
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,449
<i>Make that eight.</i>

42
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:06,745
We just came back from 447.
They got it too.

43
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:08,883
Really? The same symptoms?

44
00:04:09,003 --> 00:04:10,612
Starts with respiratory difficulty,

45
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:13,491
proceeds rapidly
to fatal organ shut down.

46
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:15,758
Oh, it's... disinfectant.

47
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,168
<i>We just came back
from the bio-screen, Rodney.</i>

48
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,764
We were wearing a hasmat
the whole time, too.

49
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:23,286
Yes, well, it's better safe than sorry.

50
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:25,130
Do we have any idea how it's spread?

51
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:27,129
Well, that's the strange part.

52
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:29,561
Most of these planets
have no regular contact with each other,

53
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:31,564
but a few of them do have
regular contact

54
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:34,773
with other, neighboring planets
that have been completely unaffected.

55
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,111
So far.

56
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:38,783
How bad is this going to get?

57
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:43,679
If I had to make a projection, I'd base
it on the evidence from M1R-992.

58
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:45,769
There have been no new cases
there for some time,

59
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,497
which would seem to indicate
the sickness has run its course.

60
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:50,750
And?

61
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:53,787
It killed 30% of the population.

62
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,040
<i>If those numbers bear out
on the rest of these planets,</i>

63
00:04:57,176 --> 00:05:00,213
we're looking at a death-toll
of about 200,000.

64
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:04,013
That's assuming
it doesn't spread any further.

65
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:21,888
Rodney, has Dr. Keller made any progress
with her investigation?

66
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:24,073
Unfortunately not, no,
but she's still working on it.

67
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:26,621
What are you hiding?

68
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,416
I...

69
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,112
Well...

70
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:32,517
I've been waiting for the right time
to give this to you,

71
00:05:32,637 --> 00:05:35,410
and what with everything
that's been going on and all, I...

72
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,297
Anyway...

73
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:41,341
- Here you go.
- You didn't have to do this, Rodney.

74
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:44,629
Well, think of it as a...
a kind of a pre-baby present.

75
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,892
Back on Earth, there's this company
that produces recordings specifically

76
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,018
for the fetus.

77
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,558
The thinking is

78
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:54,106
that by listening to the works
of, say, a great composer

79
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:55,983
while still in the womb, the baby

80
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:58,580
will be born with a natural
predisposition toward musical ability,

81
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:00,734
or in this case, science.

82
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,985
Yeah, I recorded some of my reflections
on some of my more

83
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:08,620
ground-breaking accomplishments and
theories. Just a couple of hours' worth.

84
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,801
You should not have gone
to so much trouble.

85
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:13,915
Oh, it was no trouble at all.

86
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:17,687
Something wrong?

87
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,796
I was debating
whether or not to tell anyone.

88
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:27,807
Tell anyone what?

89
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:31,765
I believe I had a vision last night.

90
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,312
A vision?

91
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:34,771
<i>I saw Kanaan,</i>

92
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,254
the father of my son.

93
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:40,815
I believe that he was trying
to send me a message,

94
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,154
<i>that he's alive,</i>

95
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:46,782
and that I must not abandon the search
for him and the rest of my people.

96
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:49,365
And-and this was
while you were sleeping?

97
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:53,830
- You think it was a dream.
- Well, I...

98
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:55,951
I believe it was more than that.

99
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:58,541
It did not feel like a dream.

100
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,828
I knew you'd doubt me.
I should not have said anything.

101
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:07,161
Hey, I've been cocooned
inside an alien space craft,

102
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:09,775
I've had another person living
inside me, I've encountered not one,

103
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:12,152
but two different versions of myself,
so who am I to judge?

104
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:14,602
If you say it was a vision,
then I believe it was a vision.

105
00:07:14,762 --> 00:07:17,123
- I seriously doubt it was a vision.
- She had them before.

106
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:20,046
She's had remote contact
with the Wraith, never another human.

107
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,222
Besides, those Athosians
have been missing for, like,

108
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,331
6 months now?
You really think they're still alive?

109
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:26,477
What do you want me to do?
Tell her to give up hope?

110
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:29,174
At some point,
she may not have a choice.

111
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:24,397
Kanaan...

112
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:29,452
Teyla?

113
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:35,935
You must help us.

114
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:39,319
- How?
- Save us.

115
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:42,451
Where are you?
Where are our people?

116
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,117
- You bought me this.
- Yes.

117
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,307
- Do you remember where?
- The village of Croya.

118
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:54,507
Is that where you are?

119
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:55,913
Come find me.

120
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:14,902
She says the pendant in her vision

121
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,477
is the same one she gave to Kanaan
before he disappeared.

122
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:19,152
So what's the significance?

123
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:20,641
Well...

124
00:09:21,953 --> 00:09:22,899
I'm not sure.

125
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:25,401
Well, what does she want, exactly?

126
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:28,440
Well, she bought it from
some guy in a village on M2S-181.

127
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,188
She wants to go back and check it out.

128
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:32,571
That's a peaceful trading settlement.
I'd be very surprised

129
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:35,177
if they had anything to do with
the disappearance of the Athosians.

130
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:37,183
That's what I said,
but she still wants to go.

131
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:41,083
She thinks that Kanaan
is sending her a message, a clue.

132
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,898
- And what do you think?
- Doesn't matter.

133
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:46,005
It's Teyla, and we owe her one.

134
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:50,927
Okay, but we're stretched pretty
thin dealing with this plague.

135
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:53,127
We'll try to make it quick.

136
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:08,391
I purchased the pendant
from an artisan in Croya,

137
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,498
the village we are about to visit.

138
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,931
Among the Athosians,
it's quite common to present such gifts

139
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:17,372
as expressions
of admiration and respect.

140
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:20,674
Hey, maybe I'll pick you
something up while we're there.

141
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:21,641
Really?

142
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:22,505
No.

143
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,586
All right, so we'll ask around see
if we can get some useful intel,

144
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:28,460
but if you even begin
to sense any danger

145
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,787
I'll make straight for the Gate,
leaving you to deal with it.

146
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,881
All right, then.

147
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:51,849
Excuse me, I'm wondering
if you can tell me

148
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:55,087
what happened to the artisan
who used to occupy this space.

149
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:58,504
He specialized in handcrafted jewelry,

150
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,082
bracelets, pendants, chains...

151
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:02,291
He's gone.

152
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:04,163
Gone?

153
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:06,854
During the sickness
that took the village

154
00:11:06,974 --> 00:11:08,047
several weeks back.

155
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:10,424
He and some 40 others.

156
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:13,424
I'm sorry, child, he's dead.

157
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:19,681
Hey, I hear you have something.

158
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:21,687
Yeah.

159
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,554
I found out
what's making these people sick,

160
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:27,420
and it's something
we've encountered before.

161
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,763
It's a unique protein originally created

162
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:34,183
by the inhabitants
of a planet called Hoff.

163
00:11:34,303 --> 00:11:36,739
It was designed to interfere
with the Wraith's feeding mechanism,

164
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,374
making them immune to the process.

165
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:40,990
It also killed the feeding Wraith,
and half the people who took it.

166
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,133
That's right.

167
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,542
So this isn't some contagion
that spreads naturally.

168
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:47,128
No. This is mass murder.

169
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:58,902
- I think we're done here.
- Not yet.

170
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:01,601
I've given this place the twice over.
Nobody knows anything.

171
00:12:01,802 --> 00:12:04,353
Perhaps someone does, and has
not yet seen fit to come forward yet.

172
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:08,592
I was guided here.

173
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:11,775
By showing me the pendant, Kanaan
was telling me to come to this village.

174
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:14,764
Look, you're going through a tough time.

175
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:17,078
You want answers,
that's understandable, but

176
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:20,578
you might want to consider it's clouding
your judgment. Just a little.

177
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:22,620
What are you questioning, John?

178
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,077
My interpretation of the vision,
or the vision itself?

179
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:26,544
We've been here long enough.

180
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:29,688
If there was something for us to find,
we would've found it by now.

181
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:34,518
Rodney, Ronon, we're heading out.

182
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:38,346
<i>You sure it's the same protein?</i>

183
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:42,165
I ran a side-by-side comparison.
It was almost an exact match.

184
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:43,085
Almost?

185
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:45,559
We're dealing with
the new and improved version.

186
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,785
The Hoffan drug killed roughly
50% of the test subjects,

187
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:50,481
and this one only kills 30%.

188
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,127
Yeah, it's still 30% too many.

189
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:55,672
How do the populations of eight
different planets get inoculated

190
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,411
with a drug and not even know about it?

191
00:12:57,531 --> 00:13:00,871
It's possible it was administered
through their food and water supply.

192
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:03,327
<i>- We're running some tests.</i>
- So who's behind this?

193
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:06,705
Well, maybe the Hoffans have resumed
distribution of the drug, but

194
00:13:07,157 --> 00:13:08,321
<i>on a much larger scale.</i>

195
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:11,186
They haven't been doing much of anything
lately. When the Wraith discovered

196
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:13,535
what they were up to,
the whole civilization was wiped out.

197
00:13:13,655 --> 00:13:16,382
Maybe a few of them survived,
and they're planning a little payback.

198
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:21,791
The random nature of this drug's
distribution is clear and calculated.

199
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:25,057
It's obviously intended to throw
the Wraith completely off balance.

200
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:27,870
They have no way of knowing which of
their food sources has been infected.

201
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,272
So it's just a matter of time before
they become hungry and cranky.

202
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:34,662
Well, I mean, I know I would.

203
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:36,938
We need to go back to Hoff,

204
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:40,034
search what's still standing, see if
we can shed some light on the situation

205
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,615
before another planet's targeted.

206
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:43,950
Let's go, Rodney.

207
00:13:59,478 --> 00:14:00,335
Teyla...

208
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:04,079
Kanaan...

209
00:14:04,923 --> 00:14:06,279
Where are you?

210
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,693
I don't know.

211
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:09,643
Who took you?

212
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,479
I don't know.

213
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:13,893
How can I find you?

214
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,650
You already know where to go
to uncover the answers.

215
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
The village.

216
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,613
You stopped looking.

217
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:22,907
I went.
I found nothing.

218
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,057
You were close.

219
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:26,528
Please, Teyla.

220
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:28,714
Our time is running short.

221
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:34,371
We need you.

222
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:36,643
Kanaan...

223
00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:55,061
And you weren't sleeping?

224
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:58,522
I was in a meditative state,
but I was most definitely awake.

225
00:14:58,642 --> 00:15:01,024
There can be no doubt.
This is real.

226
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:02,928
But you've already been to the planet.

227
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:05,257
We missed something.
I'm certain of it.

228
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:07,910
I want to believe you, Teyla,
but I'm a scientist.

229
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,130
- I'm trained to think critically.
- There is a possible explanation.

230
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,158
Kanaan has the gift.

231
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:17,043
- The same ability that I do.
- The Wraith DNA.

232
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:17,893
Yes.

233
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:22,424
Among my people, the gift is considered
useful, but it also sets one apart.

234
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:24,383
It can be difficult.

235
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:27,221
Kanaan was the only one who could
truly understand what it felt like.

236
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:28,806
It brought you together.

237
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,725
It is something we have
shared since childhood.

238
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:34,311
But have you ever
communicated this way before?

239
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:36,230
No.

240
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:39,358
I know what this looks like, Colonel,

241
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:41,536
and I know what everyone is thinking.

242
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:45,454
She sees what she wants to see,
she believes what she wants to believe,

243
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:48,576
but I assure you, that is not the case.

244
00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:56,011
All right. When Colonel Sheppard
gets back from Hoff,

245
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:57,593
- we can...
- I cannot wait.

246
00:15:57,713 --> 00:16:00,333
Kanaan said their time is running short.
I must leave immediately.

247
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:01,680
I see.

248
00:16:07,548 --> 00:16:10,176
I do not need your permission, Colonel.

249
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,517
Unless you intend to restrain me.

250
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:18,772
Major Lorne, come in.

251
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,728
<i>Go ahead, Colonel.</i>

252
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:25,398
Assemble your team. You'll be
escorting Teyla back to M2S-181.

253
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:26,661
<i>Understood.</i>

254
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:29,689
I'm not letting you
go back there alone.

255
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:30,743
Thank you.

256
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:32,411
Call me Sam.

257
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,732
Thank you, Sam.

258
00:16:51,347 --> 00:16:52,733
<i>Rodney, come in.</i>

259
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:54,619
Go ahead.

260
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:57,436
- <i>Did you find anything?</i>
- Just a bunch of junk. You?

261
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,706
Nothing.

262
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:01,920
The Wraith did a pretty good
number on this place.

263
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,043
<i>Yeah, this is more
than just random destruction.</i>

264
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:06,528
<i>This place used to be the repository
of all Hoffan knowledge.</i>

265
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:08,934
I'd say a lot of it's just missing.

266
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:11,386
Who's there?

267
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:12,618
What's going on?

268
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:14,703
I thought I heard something.

269
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:16,948
Relax.

270
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:18,290
Probably just rats.

271
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:20,306
Rats?

272
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,534
Okay, if there's someone in here,
you better come out.

273
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,073
I'm not kidding.

274
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:56,370
Hang on.
I'm not going to hurt you.

275
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,293
I want to ask you
a couple of questions.

276
00:17:58,413 --> 00:18:00,742
Now, who are you?
What are you doing here?

277
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,157
Okay, maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for some medical stuff.

278
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:05,620
Books, files, equipment.

279
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,214
I don't know anything about that.

280
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,510
By the time we got here, most of
the good stuff was already gone.

281
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:13,262
We're picking through what's left.

282
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:20,728
Looks like we're not the only ones here.

283
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:22,546
What do you got?

284
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,422
<i>A bunch of kids going through
what's left of this place.</i>

285
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,943
Scavengers. You think they got
a hold of what we're looking for?

286
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:30,739
Hoffan research wouldn't have meant
anything to them.

287
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,729
<i>All right, if it's not them,
then who was it?</i>

288
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:33,858
I don't know.

289
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:36,264
One thing's for sure, whoever it was,

290
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:39,143
they knew exactly
what they were looking for.

291
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:51,422
Kind of reminds me of the flea markets
they used to have back home.

292
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,655
Every sunday, stroll down
to the bay area,

293
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:56,472
find pretty much anything you wanted,

294
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:59,444
and a lot of things you didn't.

295
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,358
What is it?

296
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:12,338
Teyla?

297
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,033
Leave.

298
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:23,753
I will ask you once, and
you will answer me truthfully.

299
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:26,859
- Where did you get this pendant?
- From a trader.

300
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:29,338
If you like it that much,
it's yours with my blessings.

301
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:33,418
<i>You recognize it?</i>

302
00:19:34,415 --> 00:19:36,136
<i>It belonged to Kanaan.</i>

303
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,598
What else did you
acquire from this trader?

304
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:51,859
You know, I don't want to be
difficult here, but I did acquire

305
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,322
merchandise for a price, and while I
don't mind gifting you with an item,

306
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:58,783
from a purely business standpoint, it
really doesn't make sense for me to part

307
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:01,936
- with my stock...
- This necklace belonged to Bellara.

308
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:05,101
It was a gift from her parents
to mark her coming of age,

309
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:07,501
and this ring

310
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,547
belonged to Halling.

311
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:13,263
This trader you say you got
these things from.

312
00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:15,533
- When's the last time you saw him?
- Several days ago

313
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:17,393
but he comes
through here quite regularly.

314
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:20,588
In fact, it's more than likely
he may pay me a visit today.

315
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,809
It would be my pleasure to make
the proper introductions.

316
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:35,502
- Anything?
- No, the place was cleared out.

317
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:37,138
Is that what I think it is?

318
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:39,616
- It's getting to be a familiar sight.
- What is it?

319
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:42,494
Wraith subspace tracking device.
It's our old friend.

320
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:44,746
- Todd.
- Maybe he wants

321
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:47,127
to talk, and maybe he just wants
to lead us into an ambush.

322
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,584
There is that possibility.

323
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:51,336
Well, there's only one way to find out.

324
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:54,631
- Aw, come on, we just got back.
- Sorry, Rodney.

325
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,830
I haven't even had lunch yet.

326
00:20:58,659 --> 00:20:59,673
Dial it.

327
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:24,099
Got some real nice merchandise
for you today, my friend.

328
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:25,037
Real nice.

329
00:21:27,524 --> 00:21:28,467
<i>Hey there,</i>

330
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:29,904
how you doing?

331
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:32,701
You mind telling me
where you got this stuff?

332
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,033
Wake up.

333
00:22:08,088 --> 00:22:08,884
Look,

334
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:10,711
we need to know

335
00:22:11,103 --> 00:22:12,501
where you got this merchandise.

336
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,256
I do trade so much, it's often hard
to keep track of it all.

337
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:18,468
Oh, yeah?

338
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:21,268
Well, according to the merchant you do
business with here, the stuff you've

339
00:22:21,388 --> 00:22:24,554
been bringing in lately has been a hell
of a lot nicer than your usual crap.

340
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:27,599
- He said that?
- Yeah, he said that.

341
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,068
Well,
there's no accounting for taste.

342
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,719
I can't give up my sources.
They're trade secrets.

343
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:37,339
I don't give a damn
about your trade secrets.

344
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:39,811
We want to know
where you got this stuff.

345
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:42,969
And if I don't tell you?
What are you going to do?

346
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:45,653
I recognize those uniforms,
I've heard the stories.

347
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:47,389
People from Atlantis,

348
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:49,209
do-gooders of the galaxy.

349
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:51,771
You wouldn't hurt me.

350
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:53,737
<i>I'm wearing no uniform.</i>

351
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:00,138
A pregnant woman.

352
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:01,836
Very intimidating.

353
00:23:07,227 --> 00:23:09,594
<i>I will inform the villagers
that you are a Wraith worshiper,</i>

354
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:11,518
<i>and let them mete out
their own justice.</i>

355
00:23:11,678 --> 00:23:12,719
Let's go.

356
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,894
Wait, wait!

357
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,944
I got it
at an off-world dumping ground.

358
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,404
Dumping ground? For what?

359
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,116
Corpses, mostly.

360
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,094
<i>Loose ends that need
to be disappeared.</i>

361
00:23:29,446 --> 00:23:31,579
<i>Occasionally they may still have
some valuables on them,</i>

362
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,874
valuables they obviously
have no use for.

363
00:23:34,553 --> 00:23:36,959
This merchandise,
you removed it from the dead?

364
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,824
No,

365
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,338
not <i>that </i>merchandise.

366
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:46,712
The last time
I was back at the planet,

367
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:49,337
I spotted what I thought
was a fresh grave,

368
00:23:49,457 --> 00:23:50,766
a potential new opportunity,

369
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,022
<i>but when I dug it up,
instead of finding a body,</i>

370
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,563
<i>I found a box
containing those items.</i>

371
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:59,198
I suppose somebody was just
trying to get rid of them.

372
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:01,380
It was odd to me at first,
but I wasn't just about...

373
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,531
You will take us to this world.

374
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,489
You will show us
where you found them.

375
00:24:06,276 --> 00:24:07,253
Of course.

376
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,785
Whatever you say.

377
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:12,440
Get him up.

378
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:40,635
<i>Sheppard.</i>

379
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:42,049
<i>We got something.</i>

380
00:24:56,776 --> 00:24:57,982
Well, they're dead,

381
00:24:58,102 --> 00:24:59,588
but there's no marks on them.

382
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,863
<i>That's because they were poisoned...</i>

383
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:08,291
and I suspect you already know how.

384
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:18,767
First thing we do when we get
to the Gate is radio back to Atlantis,

385
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:21,106
<i>let them know
where we're going, okay?</i>

386
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:24,046
<i>Listen, Teyla,</i>

387
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:27,529
<i>I know you're looking for answers
to what happened to your people, but</i>

388
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:31,467
I'm thinking maybe it's better
if you let us check it out, okay?

389
00:25:31,587 --> 00:25:32,825
- Major...
<i>- Look,</i>

390
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:34,619
just let us scout ahead, all right?

391
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:38,652
- What is that?
- Dart!

392
00:25:49,712 --> 00:25:51,159
Well, let me guess...

393
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,721
Something they ate?

394
00:25:53,338 --> 00:25:55,217
Many of my fellow Wraith
have fallen victim

395
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:56,975
to this attack on our food supply.

396
00:25:57,337 --> 00:25:59,478
Yeah, it's a shame,
but it's not really our problem.

397
00:26:00,286 --> 00:26:02,086
From what we've been able
to surmise,

398
00:26:02,206 --> 00:26:05,233
this blow against us has been delivered
at a great cost to human lives.

399
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:08,760
<i>Something you would have
made your problem in the past...</i>

400
00:26:09,212 --> 00:26:12,951
Unless, of course, you're responsible
for the dispersal of this plague,

401
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,606
in which case, you may well consider
the human lives sacrificed

402
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:17,954
acceptable losses?

403
00:26:18,524 --> 00:26:22,017
Actually, when we were putting a list
together of the most likely suspects,

404
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:23,469
you were at the top.

405
00:26:24,461 --> 00:26:26,306
What better way to stick it
to your competion?

406
00:26:27,607 --> 00:26:28,568
Effective,

407
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:29,405
yes,

408
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:31,090
and admittedly creative,

409
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,465
but the truth is,

410
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:35,764
all of the existing Wraith factions
have been adversely affected by this.

411
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:39,476
Our food supply
has been so randomly tainted

412
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:42,687
we have no way of knowing
if our next meal will be our last.

413
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:44,290
All right,

414
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,938
times are tough.

415
00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:47,984
Doesn't explain
why you called us here.

416
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,333
I brought you here because...

417
00:26:52,413 --> 00:26:53,531
I need your help.

418
00:26:55,773 --> 00:26:59,037
I am aware you had a hand
in helping the Hoffans refine this drug.

419
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:03,083
I require whatever research you possess
in order that I may synthesize a cure,

420
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,187
for my hive

421
00:27:05,307 --> 00:27:06,461
and my hive alone.

422
00:27:07,395 --> 00:27:09,091
That's not going to happen.

423
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,676
You always say that,

424
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:12,300
but you always come around.

425
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:14,371
Yeah, well, this is different.

426
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:17,639
We're still a little upset
over the whole Earth conquest thing.

427
00:27:18,718 --> 00:27:22,018
- I had no part in that.
<i>- Actually, in an indirect way, you did.</i>

428
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:24,629
The Wraith who led the attack
was able to access the Midway station

429
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:26,940
with information you stole
on your last visit to Atlantis.

430
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:29,027
Information
he stole from me in turn,

431
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,477
so, in a way, we were both victims,

432
00:27:31,597 --> 00:27:34,040
but let's save our commiserations
for another time.

433
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,445
I have a proposal.

434
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,076
Let's hear it.

435
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:41,146
In exchange for this information,

436
00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:43,300
I will give you
the identity of the individual

437
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,668
responsible for dispersing this poison
and killing both Wraith

438
00:27:46,996 --> 00:27:48,375
and human alike.

439
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,590
A couple of minutes ago,
you thought we did it.

440
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,306
There are only two parties
who possess the resources

441
00:27:54,426 --> 00:27:56,386
and capabilities
to launch such an attack.

442
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,903
<i>If you are not responsible, then,</i>

443
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:00,875
<i>by process of elimination,</i>

444
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,875
there can be only one.

445
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,448
Michael.

446
00:28:30,348 --> 00:28:32,586
According to Todd,
every Wraith faction has been hit,

447
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:35,259
which makes it very unlikely
that any of them are responsible.

448
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:38,470
When we told him we weren't behind it,
he said there can only be one other.

449
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:40,690
And you think you know
who he's talking about?

450
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:43,091
Michael.

451
00:28:43,964 --> 00:28:45,958
The Wraith that Dr. Beckett
converted into a human?

452
00:28:46,078 --> 00:28:47,905
Well, temporarily converted.

453
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:51,315
Eventually, he became a kind
of a human-Wraith hybrid.

454
00:28:51,435 --> 00:28:54,314
The other Wraith didn't want anything to
do with him so he's been kind of holding

455
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:57,197
- a little bit of a grudge ever since.
- <i>He's not a big fan of Humans, either.</i>

456
00:28:57,358 --> 00:28:59,616
No, for him, the Hoffan drug
is the perfect weapon.

457
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:01,774
Still, this is just speculation.

458
00:29:02,008 --> 00:29:03,370
I mean, do we have any proof?

459
00:29:04,204 --> 00:29:06,771
Well, not really, but even if we did,
we'd have no way of finding him.

460
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:09,542
We can go back to Todd, see
if he's got something more than a name.

461
00:29:09,703 --> 00:29:11,430
Wait, you're not seriously
thinking of...

462
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,640
giving him our research
on the Hoffan protein?

463
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,773
Why not?

464
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:17,182
Because we'd effectively
be giving the Wraith

465
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:18,843
the means to reproduce the drug and,

466
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:21,048
<i>potentially infect and kill millions...</i>

467
00:29:21,168 --> 00:29:23,554
Theoretically, yes, but practically,
it really wouldn't be

468
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:26,213
in their best interest to poison
their own food supply, regardless of

469
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,747
<i>whether our research helped them
come up with an antidote or not.</i>

470
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,974
No, I think the more likely scenario
is that they find an antidote

471
00:29:32,094 --> 00:29:34,489
that works as a short-term
solution to the existing threat,

472
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,739
then they work
on weaponizing the protein.

473
00:29:36,981 --> 00:29:39,059
Coming up with a more
effective delivery system,

474
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,522
one that cuts out the middle man,
in this case, the human victims.

475
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:46,413
No, what we're doing is giving them
the means to kill each other off.

476
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:48,242
<i>So, when you, uh...</i>

477
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:49,707
put it that way,

478
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:51,751
giving them our research
could be a good thing.

479
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:54,581
<i>Incoming wormhole.</i>

480
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:09,005
Major, where's Teyla?

481
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:13,273
Why am I here?

482
00:30:14,098 --> 00:30:15,533
What do you want?

483
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:18,069
Answer me!

484
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,893
I'm disappointed.

485
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,966
I was expecting a little more gratitude,

486
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:25,493
after everything I went through
to arrange this...

487
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,453
family reunion.

488
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:28,461
Reunion?

489
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:33,286
My people...

490
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,254
You took them?

491
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,926
Where are they?

492
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:41,958
- What have you done with them?
- They're alive and well,

493
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:45,566
and working with me
toward the common goal we all share.

494
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:47,056
What are you talking about?

495
00:30:52,697 --> 00:30:54,564
The extermination of the Wraith.

496
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,123
I'm building an army
that will soon replace them

497
00:30:59,243 --> 00:31:01,613
as the dominant race in this galaxy.

498
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:03,907
An army of monsters.

499
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:05,996
I'll admit,

500
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,953
my early attempts were a little...

501
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:09,943
crude,

502
00:31:10,407 --> 00:31:11,979
<i>but that's all changed now.</i>

503
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:15,627
<i>I've refined the retrovirus
to create the perfect balance,</i>

504
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:18,640
ability well beyond any normal human,
but without

505
00:31:19,072 --> 00:31:22,342
the one weakness
that will be the downfall of the Wraith.

506
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:29,599
The need to feed.

507
00:31:31,392 --> 00:31:32,458
It was you.

508
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:35,772
You're the one responsible
for spreading the Hoffan drug.

509
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:39,901
Consider it the opening salvo
in a much broader assault.

510
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,278
How were you able to discover the drug?

511
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:46,160
How were you able to refine it?

512
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:49,659
I had help.

513
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:57,252
Wait! Where are my people?

514
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,414
Michael!

515
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:19,503
Oh, don't mind them.

516
00:32:20,254 --> 00:32:22,072
They're just here to help
with the clean-up.

517
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,826
I assume you've agreed to my terms?

518
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,314
Not exactly.

519
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:37,230
You do not wish to know
who's responsible for these

520
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,626
unfortunate events?

521
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,228
We already know.

522
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,452
At least, we have a pretty good guess.

523
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:44,131
<i>We call him Michael.</i>

524
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:45,603
Don't ask why.

525
00:32:45,723 --> 00:32:47,655
He used to be a Wraith. Now he's a...

526
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:50,333
I'm not sure what the hell he is.

527
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:53,558
I know the one of whom you speak,
and I believe you are correct.

528
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:56,945
Confirmation,
without us giving you anything.

529
00:32:57,065 --> 00:32:58,188
That's very generous.

530
00:32:59,134 --> 00:33:02,061
Obviously there's more you want from me,
or you would not have come.

531
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,610
Maybe we just came to kill you.

532
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:05,028
Did you?

533
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:06,596
Unfortunately, no.

534
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,116
Well, there's always next time.

535
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:11,091
Rodney...

536
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,295
One of our people,

537
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:16,623
Teyla, was taken by a dart today.

538
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:20,543
I suppose she's already made
some lucky Wraith a very tasty meal.

539
00:33:20,704 --> 00:33:21,941
This was no culling.

540
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:23,963
She was targeted. Someone set a trap.

541
00:33:24,124 --> 00:33:25,490
And you suspect this...

542
00:33:26,021 --> 00:33:27,382
What do you call him? Michael?

543
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:29,844
Well, if not, the timing's
a hell of a coincidence.

544
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,972
<i>We need you to tap your intel sources,</i>

545
00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:35,395
find something useful.

546
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:42,482
This tablet has the address
of an off-world relay station.

547
00:33:42,602 --> 00:33:45,039
If you leave a message for us,
we'll get it.

548
00:33:45,345 --> 00:33:47,810
It also has our research
on the Hoffan drug.

549
00:33:49,148 --> 00:33:50,927
Just enough to whet your appetite.

550
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:54,577
You find something we can use,
we'll give you the rest.

551
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:57,580
Well, I'll see what I can do.

552
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:25,900
I understand
you're refusing to take food.

553
00:34:28,712 --> 00:34:31,020
It's not poisoned,
if that's what you're worried about.

554
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,439
Take it.

555
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:44,842
You need to keep up your strength.

556
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:53,052
What do you care about my well-being?

557
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,726
I care a great deal.

558
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:01,984
I may not be foolish enough
to consider us friends,

559
00:35:02,158 --> 00:35:03,846
but we do have a history...

560
00:35:05,163 --> 00:35:07,195
<i>And even though you've
betrayed me repeatedly,</i>

561
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,019
<i>you're still the only one,
human or Wraith,</i>

562
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:12,855
who's ever come close to understanding
what I've been through.

563
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,565
Really?

564
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:16,818
We're not that different, Teyla.

565
00:35:18,151 --> 00:35:20,275
<i>You're a human with Wraith DNA.</i>

566
00:35:20,513 --> 00:35:22,740
A hybrid, just like me.

567
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:24,867
I'm no murderer.

568
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,502
You kill to protect yourself
and your own, so do I.

569
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:33,659
Of course, circumstances require me
to do it on a slightly larger scale,

570
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:36,303
but the principle is still the same.

571
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:38,047
You're insane.

572
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:45,568
Spite me all you want,

573
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:50,246
but don't do it
at the expense of the child.

574
00:35:52,673 --> 00:35:53,796
My child...

575
00:35:54,356 --> 00:35:56,232
is of no concern to you.

576
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,974
On the contrary,

577
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,609
I have great plans for him.

578
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:22,548
- How can you eat right now?
- You kidding?

579
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,772
This is the first decent meal
I've had all day.

580
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,227
Besides, it's not gonna help Teyla
starving ourselves.

581
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:30,891
I'm just trying to keep my strength up.
I suggest you two do the same.

582
00:36:31,246 --> 00:36:34,234
- We'll find her.
- I've just gotta do something.

583
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:35,461
Colonel...

584
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:38,274
- Looks like Todd came through for you.
- He did?

585
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:40,209
Got a message from the relay station.

586
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:43,014
Apparently there's a rumor going around
amongst certain Wraith worshipers

587
00:36:43,174 --> 00:36:45,114
about one of our people
being held captive.

588
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,117
- You've got the coordinates.
- I'm gonna need Lorne's team.

589
00:36:48,377 --> 00:36:50,852
He's already volunteered.
You'll gate to the nearest planet,

590
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:53,247
- the Daedalus is enroute to pick you.
- Let's go.

591
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:03,884
I told you, I'm not hungry.

592
00:37:09,888 --> 00:37:10,895
Kanaan...

593
00:37:13,854 --> 00:37:15,645
What has he done to you?

594
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:17,281
Kanaan,

595
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:18,991
it's me. Teyla.

596
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:21,609
I came for you, just like you asked.

597
00:37:22,182 --> 00:37:23,374
Like I asked.

598
00:37:27,032 --> 00:37:29,100
I was the one in your visions.

599
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,664
Appropriately disguised, of course.

600
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:32,745
You're lying.

601
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:36,332
I reached across 10,000 light years
of space and touched your mind.

602
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:39,602
There is more of a bond
between us than you know.

603
00:37:39,762 --> 00:37:41,254
Once the child is born,

604
00:37:41,514 --> 00:37:43,339
the bond will grow even stronger.

605
00:37:46,336 --> 00:37:47,468
Enjoy your reunion.

606
00:37:53,888 --> 00:37:56,102
Kanaan, you must help me.

607
00:37:57,171 --> 00:37:58,521
You must help our child.

608
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:00,857
Please, Kanaan.

609
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,734
The child will serve the cause,

610
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:08,052
then one day soon,
the galaxy will be ours.

611
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,764
- Colonel...
- Sheppard.

612
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:30,404
- Approaching target destination.
- Drop us out.

613
00:38:30,695 --> 00:38:31,695
Yes, Sir.

614
00:38:46,996 --> 00:38:49,405
We're unable to get a lock
on Teyla's subcutaneous transmitter.

615
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:51,574
No surprise.
Sure Michael got rid of that.

616
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:53,709
Guess we'll have to
do things the hard way.

617
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:54,952
Good, let's do it.

618
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:08,959
- All right, stay in touch.
- Yes, Sir.

619
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:10,520
Let's move out.

620
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,752
Sir, I'm picking up another ship.
It's a Wraith cruiser.

621
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,343
Shields up.

622
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:37,433
Return fire!

623
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:41,725
Sheppard, this is Daedalus.
We've been engaged by a Wraith cruiser.

624
00:40:41,885 --> 00:40:43,098
<i>How's it going?</i>

625
00:40:43,258 --> 00:40:46,322
More than holding our own,
but you could pick up the pace.

626
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:47,857
Where's your boss?

627
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,867
- You're too early.
- What the hell does that mean?

628
00:40:59,982 --> 00:41:01,817
We're expecting him back.

629
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:05,624
He's on his way
with an important prisoner.

630
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,132
This is Sheppard, come in.

631
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:17,053
- <i>Daedalus, do you read?</i>
- Sheppard, this is Daedalus.

632
00:41:17,446 --> 00:41:19,388
Do not destroy the enemy ship.
I repeat,

633
00:41:19,648 --> 00:41:22,058
<i>do not destroy the enemy ship.
Teyla may be on board.</i>

634
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,227
Did you hear me?
Teyla may be on board!

635
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:29,642
- We heard you. Can you cripple it?
- It's possible, Sir.

636
00:41:29,802 --> 00:41:31,660
It's already sustained
some heavy damage.

637
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,278
- The enemy is attempting a retreat.
- Target the engines!

638
00:41:44,427 --> 00:41:45,851
I'm sorry, Sir.

639
00:41:46,988 --> 00:41:47,958
Bad news.

640
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:51,152
<i>The cruiser made
the jump to hyperspace.</i>

641
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:52,399
<i>It's gone.</i>

642
00:42:15,597 --> 00:42:17,528
- Any sign of her, Sir?
- She's not here.

643
00:42:17,688 --> 00:42:19,939
Are you sure?
That guard was protecting something.

644
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,796
Finally!
It's about bloody time.

645
00:42:45,956 --> 00:42:47,601
What took you so long?
