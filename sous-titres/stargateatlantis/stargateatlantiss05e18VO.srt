1
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,869
I just didn't know anybody
was in here.

2
00:00:42,432 --> 00:00:45,301
You looking for Rodney?
'Cause I saw him in the mess hall.

3
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:49,181
- You're all right?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:51,406
You just seem a little confused.

5
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:57,598
Are you ill?

6
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:00,818
No, I just...

7
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:02,689
I... don't...

8
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:05,064
Where am I?

9
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,359
You're in one of our auxiliary labs.

10
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:10,242
East pier, level four?

11
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:14,883
Here, why don't you sit down?

12
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,417
- It's okay...
- No, really. I'll radio Rodney...

13
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:19,745
No, no, you don't need to do that.

14
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:24,332
Better yet, let...
Why don't you lie down?

15
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:28,462
Walk with me to the infirmary,
and they'll examine you,

16
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,635
They'll just see
if there's anything...

17
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:14,084
Saison 5 Épisode 18
Identity (v. 1.00)

18
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:17,101
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

19
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:19,799
www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

20
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:19,141
I've been looking for you.

21
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,116
Is your radio not working?
I called, like, 1,000 times!

22
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,367
Come on. Here.

23
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,059
I just want to check your earwig.

24
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:27,268
Here we go.

25
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:30,203
It was probably just a dead battery.

26
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:33,921
Come on, it's schnitzel day.
We've got to hurry, it's going fast.

27
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,329
- So what happened?
- What do you mean?

28
00:03:36,454 --> 00:03:39,079
Our lunch date?
You were supposed to meet me.

29
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:40,804
I must have forgotten.

30
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:45,707
What's wrong? You seem distracted.
Is something bothering you?

31
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:48,853
Did I do something?
I did, didn't I? What'd I do?

32
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,000
- Nothing. I'm just... I'm not...
- <i>Dr. Keller?</i>

33
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,845
<i>Dr. Keller! Please respond.</i>

34
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,403
Just a second. It's for you.

35
00:03:57,726 --> 00:03:59,528
Working fine, apparently.

36
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:03,519
<i>Dr. Keller, we have an emergency.</i>

37
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,915
<i>Dr. Zelenka
has been seriously injured!</i>

38
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:09,206
What's wrong with Zelenka?

39
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:11,207
It's about his so-called migraines?

40
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:14,729
- If it is, you can just send him...
- <i>He's been stabbed!</i>

41
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,463
What? Stabbed?

42
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,629
Like, with a knife, stabbed?
By whom?

43
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:21,552
<i>I don't know,
they found him on the floor of his lab.</i>

44
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,869
<i>He's unconscious, losing a lot of blood.
They're rushing him to the infirmary.</i>

45
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:26,890
All right, we're on our way.

46
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:37,331
His pressure's dropping. 60 over 40.
Pulse rapid, skin diaphoretic.

47
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:39,891
The scan shows internal bleeding,
laceration of the liver.

48
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:41,363
Is he going to die?

49
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,199
He needs immediate surgery.
He's in hypovolemic shock.

50
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:49,107
- Doctor?
- Yes, he needs surgery.

51
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:52,205
We're prepping the OR.
Dr. Mcbride will assist you.

52
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,033
We'll be set to go
as soon as you're ready.

53
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:01,582
- You're acting weird. What's wrong?
- Nothing.

54
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:03,608
Nothing. I need to get ready.

55
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:43,622
Doctor?

56
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,516
I'm not feeling very well.

57
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:54,545
Take over for me.
I'm going to go lie down.

58
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,770
- How'd it go?
- He's lost a lot of blood.

59
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:07,772
- Is he awake yet?
- No. He's in a coma.

60
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:10,329
It's a light coma.
They figure he should recover,

61
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,079
barring any complications.

62
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,372
I hear Dr. Keller
didn't perform the surgery?

63
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,918
No. No, she... excused herself.
She said she wasn't feeling well.

64
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,651
- What's wrong with her?
- She's been acting strange.

65
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:22,131
Aloof, distracted.

66
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,174
I found her wandering, looking lost.

67
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,434
I got her to the infirmary,
but she stood there

68
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,929
- like she'd never held a scalpel.
- Where is she now?

69
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:30,806
In her quarters, resting.

70
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:34,330
Dr. Beckett is due back soon.

71
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:36,893
I'll have him examine her
for any possible contagion,

72
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:39,648
or, God forbid, another one
of those parasitic organisms.

73
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:42,343
Better safe than sorry.

74
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,487
Any leads yet
as to who might have done this?

75
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:48,949
- No witnesses, no sign of struggle.
- I want a full investigation.

76
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:51,840
Use every resource,
no stone unturned.

77
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:55,891
- One of our people is lying in a coma.
- Light coma.

78
00:06:58,295 --> 00:07:00,699
And I want to know
who's responsible.

79
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,700
What the hell's going on here?

80
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:39,345
- Heard you weren't feeling well.
- No.

81
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,622
- Can I come in?
- All right.

82
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:49,457
So. What's wrong with you?

83
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:53,227
I don't know.
I'm just... tired.

84
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,977
Been pushing yourself
real hard lately.

85
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,450
Well, you know me.
I'm always pushing myself real hard.

86
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:08,127
What?

87
00:08:10,484 --> 00:08:11,489
Nothing.

88
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,494
Anyway, I'll be fine.

89
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:17,269
- I just need some...
- Hi.

90
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:21,687
- Am I... interrupting?
- No.

91
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:23,795
Good. I mean...

92
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,307
I just dropped by
to let you know that

93
00:08:27,635 --> 00:08:29,492
Beckett is on his way back.

94
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:32,596
He'll be able to fill in for you
while you're...

95
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:34,849
- ill.
- Great.

96
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:38,517
Yeah, we've sent
a Puddle Jumper for him.

97
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:39,924
A Puddle Jumper?

98
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,020
Well, he's in some
remote desert village,

99
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,816
and it'll take too long to walk back,
so, it's easier to hitch a ride.

100
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:48,687
A ride on a Puddle Jumper.

101
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,058
Maybe we should leave,

102
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:02,158
you know, let her get some rest.

103
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:14,970
Call me...
if you need anything.

104
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:16,493
I will.

105
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:36,411
Nothing out of the usual,

106
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:38,659
no sign of trauma
or any kind of organism.

107
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:40,697
What about her blood work?

108
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:41,829
The same.

109
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:47,160
How long have you been
feeling like this?

110
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:49,531
A day or so?

111
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:52,257
- Have you been sleeping all right?
- No.

112
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,676
I've been pushing myself real hard.

113
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,346
Aye. Well, I'd like to keep you
overnight for observation.

114
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,308
I'll give you something for sleeping,
and we'll monitor your condition.

115
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,310
Hopefully, you'll wake up refreshed,

116
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,311
back to your old self. Okay?

117
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:10,389
You're certain
you saw nothing at all?

118
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:11,728
She's fine...

119
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:14,184
Physically speaking.

120
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,448
If there's something wrong,

121
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:20,773
I'm afraid it's most likely
psychological in nature.

122
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,279
Hello...

123
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:58,562
All these corridors,
I keep getting turned around.

124
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,532
The puddle Jumper is... where?

125
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:03,515
The Jumper bay?
Top of the central tower.

126
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,224
Right. Yeah, I know that.
I just need to... How do I...?

127
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,154
The transporter's in the corridor.
It'll take you there.

128
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,575
Transporter.
Of course. Thank you.

129
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,996
You're welcome.

130
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:35,198
Perfect.

131
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,185
Come on, come on.

132
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:55,195
What are you doing?

133
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:57,734
I... couldn't sleep.

134
00:11:57,988 --> 00:12:00,497
What, so you came up
to the Jumper bay?

135
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:02,922
Yeah... I thought I'd go for a ride.

136
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:06,516
- In a puddle Jumper?
- Is there a problem with that?

137
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,291
A few. You don't have the Ancient gene,
so you can't fly one.

138
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,438
- But you already know that.
- Can you fly it?

139
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:14,449
Of course, but you should be back
in the infirmary.

140
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:16,684
But you could take me for a ride.

141
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:17,826
What, now?

142
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:19,789
It would really help me relax.

143
00:12:19,914 --> 00:12:21,888
I thought Beckett
gave you pills for that?

144
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:23,408
They didn't work.

145
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:27,062
Come on. Please?

146
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:29,015
Just you and me.

147
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:31,519
Alone...

148
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,334
You could take me
somewhere secluded.

149
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:36,785
We can... We could make love...

150
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,981
underneath the stars.

151
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:40,108
Really?

152
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,243
- Would you like that?
- Well... Yeah!

153
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:46,327
I'd have to get a blanket, though,
because the mainland's groundcover

154
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:48,829
- is loaded with allergens.
- No. Let's just go now.

155
00:12:48,954 --> 00:12:50,422
Wait. No, no.

156
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:52,455
You should go back to the infirmary.

157
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,442
Forget about the infirmary.

158
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,001
- I need to be with you.
- Jennifer, please.

159
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:59,051
Come on.
Just a quick ride.

160
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:01,966
- Don't you want to be with me?
- No. I just...

161
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:03,865
Yes! I just... Will you stop?

162
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:06,451
Look, you are clearly not yourself.

163
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:09,496
I'm taking you back
to the infirmary...

164
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:11,455
I'm not letting you...

165
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,792
You're not taking me anywhere.

166
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,752
I need you to listen to me.

167
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:21,516
As soon as you are cured
of whatever it is that is affecting you,

168
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:24,094
you're going to thank me for this,
so... Let's go.

169
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,429
No! Don't you...

170
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,604
- What're you doing?
- You should've taken me on that ride.

171
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:52,287
I don't care what the scans say...

172
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:55,919
Either she's suffered
a serious mind-altering brain trauma,

173
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:59,568
or some kind of entity
has taken control of her.

174
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:01,219
Has she been injured recently?

175
00:14:01,344 --> 00:14:04,009
Not that I know of. I mean, she was
perfectly fine up until yesterday.

176
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,781
her brain scan would have revealed
any kind of physical trauma,

177
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:08,779
as well as any foreign organism.

178
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:12,158
- Unless the organism's good at hiding.
- Yeah. Wouldn't be the first time.

179
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:14,602
It took days to figure out
rodney was infected.

180
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:19,120
I don't think we should rule out the
possibility of a psychological event.

181
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:22,138
We sometimes forget that working in this
environment, in a whole other galaxy,

182
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:23,694
can be emotionally overwhelming.

183
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,322
Such acute stress
has often been linked

184
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:28,026
to various dissociative disorders.

185
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:29,740
Disorder? She tried to kill me.

186
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:31,781
I don't think
she would have pulled the trigger.

187
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:34,032
Hey, I saw the look in her eyes.

188
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,553
Wait a second.

189
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:38,834
If she had something to do with Zelenka?
What if she's the one who stabbed him?

190
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:42,193
That woman down there
is not Jennifer Keller.

191
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:43,765
I think Woolsey's right.

192
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,604
Something has taken control of her.

193
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:49,261
- How can we be sure of this?
- Well, we can start by asking her.

194
00:15:07,926 --> 00:15:09,523
Let's make this simple.

195
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,411
Who the hell are you?

196
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,871
- What?
- If you are, in fact, Jennifer Keller,

197
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,823
you would know
what town you're from,

198
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:19,250
what your father's name is.

199
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,295
So go ahead, tell us.

200
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:25,393
All right, look...
I know I've been acting strange...

201
00:15:25,518 --> 00:15:28,582
Strange?
Dr. Keller wouldn't point a gun at me.

202
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:31,595
And she certainly
wouldn't stab Zelenka.

203
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:33,856
Well?

204
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:38,477
You did it, didn't you?

205
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,123
You stabbed him.

206
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,861
It was self-defense.

207
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:50,199
I didn't want to hurt anybody,
but he attacked me.

208
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,658
- Zelenka attacked you?
- He couldn't harm a fly.

209
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:56,003
He tried to grab me.
I thought he was gonna turn me in.

210
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:59,184
- I was afraid of being caught.
- The fact is, you have been caught.

211
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:02,598
So I would advise you
to tell us exactly who...

212
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,628
or what you are.

213
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:13,225
My name is Neeva Casol.

214
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,434
I have no idea what I'm doing here,

215
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,033
or how I came to be
in this person's body.

216
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:22,688
In her body?

217
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:24,871
One moment I was myself,

218
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:26,859
searching through some artifacts
in a village,

219
00:16:27,246 --> 00:16:30,245
the next moment, I'm stuck
in some strange woman's body,

220
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,682
standing in the middle of this city.

221
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:35,409
Every time I look
at my reflection, I see her...

222
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:37,555
staring back at me.

223
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:40,205
How is that even possible?

224
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,082
I wish I knew.

225
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:43,667
What artifacts?

226
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:48,124
Me and my associates,
we travel around, planet to planet,

227
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,382
searching for valuables to acquire.

228
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:51,982
Oh, you mean "steal".

229
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,869
We heard about a planet

230
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:56,805
that supposedly held a trove
of ancestral artifacts...

231
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:00,999
So we made our way there
and broke into the vault...

232
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:09,406
Yeah... Yeah, yeah.

233
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,066
You see? I told you.

234
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:21,520
There is all kinds
of treasure in here.

235
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:24,646
Okay, well, move fast.
Take only what we can carry.

236
00:17:34,076 --> 00:17:35,854
What... is that?

237
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,373
I don't know.

238
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:42,680
But it's too big
to haul out of here.

239
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,016
I have no idea
how this happened, or why.

240
00:18:23,975 --> 00:18:26,980
Oh, believe me, I'm just as
confused by it as you are...

241
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,189
But I am telling you the truth.

242
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:33,026
Look, I'm sorry for
hurting one of your people,

243
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:34,742
but I felt threatened,

244
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:37,654
and I only know of one way
to deal with a threat.

245
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,917
I don't want to hurt anybody else.

246
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:42,610
I just want to get
back into my own body.

247
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:48,428
- What have you got?
- I've figured out what happened.

248
00:18:48,553 --> 00:18:50,304
The artifact that woman described

249
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,337
it rang a bell,
so I did a little research.

250
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,507
Turns out, a few years ago,
SG-1 encountered a similar device

251
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,407
in the Glastonbury cavern.

252
00:18:57,532 --> 00:18:59,740
- The Ancient communication terminal?
- Exactly.

253
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:02,014
Of course. The stones,
the psychic link...

254
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:04,685
What terminal? What stones?

255
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,802
Okay, look,
SG-1 discovered an Ancient device.

256
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:11,266
These stones... if you place them in one
of several recesses around the device,

257
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:12,554
it activates it,

258
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,360
and allows you to connect
to someone far... far away,

259
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,302
across the galaxy,
intergalactically, even,

260
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:18,947
as with Daniel Jackson
and Vala.

261
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:21,484
So this woman activated
one of these devices?

262
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:22,672
I think so, yes.

263
00:19:22,797 --> 00:19:25,776
- Why'd she connect with Keller?
- Ah, my first question as well.

264
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:27,498
Then I remembered Janus's lab...

265
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:31,492
We have recovered tons
of Ancient technology from there.

266
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:33,122
We're still
cataloguing it all.

267
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,801
Anyways, a few weeks ago,

268
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:37,135
Jennifer visited me
while I was working there.

269
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,896
Rodney, if we don't leave soon,
we're not going to get a good seat.

270
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:42,392
- Yeah. Almost... Almost there.
- Come on, it's <i>Dr. No</i>!

271
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:43,929
The first Bond movie.

272
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:47,234
You don't want to get stuck sitting
behind Ronon again, like last week.

273
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,550
I know, I know, I know.

274
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,776
Not to mention,
all the popcorn's gonna be gone.

275
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:52,013
God! This is amazing!

276
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:54,890
These are the initial design
concepts for a personal cloaking device.

277
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:58,557
Janus never got around to making it but,
given enough time, I might be able...

278
00:19:59,552 --> 00:20:01,455
We haven't cataloged those yet!

279
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,284
- Sorry.
- What did we say about that?

280
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,104
These stones must
somehow be connected

281
00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:09,600
to the Ancient terminal
that Neeva found.

282
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:12,052
But how could Jennifer
activate one of these stones?

283
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,426
He's right, it's Ancient technology.
Don't you need to have the ATA gene?

284
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:18,382
It must've been initialized already.
Maybe Janus did it,

285
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,468
or maybe a tech initialized it
after we discovered the lab.

286
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:24,671
Look, the point is that Jennifer was
obviously the last person to touch this,

287
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:26,345
which is why it connected to her.

288
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,742
If I remember
the case report correctly,

289
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:31,103
disconnecting the device
proved difficult.

290
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:34,036
Yes. I've been going over
the SGC files on that,

291
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:36,608
and there's still a lot of unanswered
questions about how it works.

292
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:39,735
Hold on. If this woman's
mind is in Keller's body,

293
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,256
does that mean Keller's mind
is in her body?

294
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:45,049
I don't know.

295
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:47,571
Maybe. I mean... probably.

296
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,718
Then the question is...

297
00:20:50,426 --> 00:20:51,841
where is Dr. Keller?

298
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:05,360
What happened?
Did you contact Atlantis?

299
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:06,310
No.

300
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,911
Why not?

301
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:12,119
I chose to first contact a few of
my trading partners on other planets.

302
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:15,334
It appears you and your accomplices
have made quite the name for yourselves.

303
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:17,937
I already told you,
I am not who you think I am...

304
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:20,023
I suppose I should feel fortunate.

305
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:22,056
I mean, your crimes elsewhere
far exceed

306
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,406
the mere robbery charges
you've been accused of here.

307
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,556
I've counted no less
than five murders

308
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:30,049
committed on other planets
by your hand alone.

309
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:33,057
Sseveral more with the aid
of your two accomplices.

310
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:36,620
They may have eluded capture so far,
but mark my words, we will find them.

311
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:40,047
Listen to me.
My name is Dr. Jennifer Keller.

312
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:42,633
I am the chief medical officer
from Atlantis.

313
00:21:42,947 --> 00:21:44,483
I don't know what's going on,

314
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:47,237
or how my mind ended up
in this woman's body,

315
00:21:47,362 --> 00:21:49,519
but if you contact them,
ask for Dr. Rodney McKay...

316
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:52,893
You are also said to be
a highly effective liar,

317
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:56,611
willing to fabricate any story,
broker any kind of deal,

318
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:58,224
to get yourself free.

319
00:21:58,796 --> 00:22:01,485
Rest assured,
I will not fall for your tricks.

320
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:03,360
As magistrate of this village,

321
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:05,030
I hereby pronounce sentence upon you

322
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:08,286
for the crimes you've committed,
not only on this planet,

323
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:11,087
but on all the other
planets in the coalition.

324
00:22:12,048 --> 00:22:14,485
Tomorrow,
you shall be taken from this cell

325
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,610
and executed.

326
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,675
- What are the options?
- There's only one option.

327
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:27,719
We have to go to the planet,
find the terminal, and shut it off.

328
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,114
It was activated on that end.
It's the initial transmitter.

329
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,350
To sever the connection,
we shut it down at the source.

330
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,544
And have you figured out
how to safely do that?

331
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:36,269
No, not yet.

332
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,910
We're not going to know
until we get a look at this thing.

333
00:22:39,035 --> 00:22:40,399
Well, the sooner, the better.

334
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:42,733
I've been studying the SG-1 report.

335
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:45,237
This device connects beyond
merely the psychological.

336
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:48,171
There's also a physiological
connection as well.

337
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:49,491
What does that mean?

338
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:52,058
It means, should Neeva's body
be killed,

339
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,864
Jennifer's mind would perish
along with her.

340
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:56,676
And we'll be stuck with...

341
00:22:57,104 --> 00:22:58,667
this other woman in Keller's body?

342
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:00,360
We need to get moving.

343
00:23:00,485 --> 00:23:02,796
Agreed. Do we know which planet
this device is on?

344
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:06,383
- We will.
- I can take you to the planet.

345
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:09,105
I'll lead you straight
to the device... on one condition.

346
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,006
- You're in no position to make...
- What is it?

347
00:23:12,313 --> 00:23:14,708
When you sever that connection,
you have to agree not to pursue

348
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,505
me or my accomplices.

349
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:17,911
Fine.

350
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:19,730
And you give me
a Puddle Jumper.

351
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,356
What? Forget it!

352
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,734
I know how many you have.
You have more than enough.

353
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,445
- You're not getting anything.
- Weapons, then.

354
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:30,490
You take us there, we don't pursue you.
That's it. Take it or leave it.

355
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,369
All right, all right. Let's go.

356
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,453
Which way?

357
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:58,810
This way.
It's not far. A few hours' walk.

358
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:01,855
A few hours?
You could have told us that before!

359
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:06,237
Wouldn't have made any difference.
Couldn't get a Jumper into this forest.

360
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,466
And the Daedalus is back on Earth.

361
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:12,085
Yeah, but I could've packed
some extra power bars, some water,

362
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,950
not to mention proper insoles.

363
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,994
- He complains a lot.
- Only when he's awake.

364
00:24:17,475 --> 00:24:19,490
Is it true that
Dr. Keller and he are...

365
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:21,157
Hard to believe, huh?

366
00:24:22,646 --> 00:24:24,199
Yeah, keep walkin'.

367
00:24:31,912 --> 00:24:32,855
It's time.

368
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:50,362
That's it.

369
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:54,157
The vault is near the center
of the village, we'll have to be quiet.

370
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,708
Maybe only a few of us should go in.

371
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:58,792
I'll need a weapon,
in case we run into...

372
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:00,664
No. We're not
breaking into the room.

373
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:01,860
What?

374
00:25:01,985 --> 00:25:04,666
We're going to go talk to
these people And ask them for help.

375
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,165
Oh, they're not going to help us.
I tried to rob them.

376
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,168
They won't know you. You're
in Jennifer Keller's body, remember?

377
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:12,790
If you do not say anything,
it should not be a problem.

378
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,220
Okay, but what if they've
captured her... me?

379
00:25:15,345 --> 00:25:18,726
Once we sever the connection, what's
to stop them from keeping me locked up?

380
00:25:19,663 --> 00:25:21,143
- Nothing.
- Ahh. Nothing.

381
00:25:21,268 --> 00:25:23,669
You said we couldn't pursue you.
Didn't say anything about them.

382
00:25:23,794 --> 00:25:25,667
- So you tricked me.
- Hey, just take it easy.

383
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:27,736
I won't let you disarm this device

384
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,651
without first knowing
where my body is.

385
00:25:29,776 --> 00:25:30,976
You don't have a choice.

386
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:32,854
We're wasting valuable
time here, people.

387
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:34,860
Maybe she should stay here.

388
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:36,673
No. I'll go.

389
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,540
- Ronon?
- Yeah, I got her.

390
00:25:40,531 --> 00:25:41,667
Let's go.

391
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:51,976
Hi. It's okay, we're friends.

392
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:53,976
We're... we're from Atlantis.

393
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:55,879
I'm Colonel John Sheppard.

394
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:58,230
What is it you want?

395
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,914
Well, we have a problem,
and we need some help.

396
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,355
We hear that this village holds
a number of Ancient artifacts,

397
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,422
most notably a communication terminal...
about yea-big, round-ish,

398
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:08,477
grooves along the outside...

399
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:09,602
yes?

400
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,236
Why do you ask about this device?

401
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:16,823
- So you have it? Where is it?
- It's hidden, and well-protected,

402
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:19,332
so if you have any designs
on removing it...

403
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:21,687
No, no, no. Look.
We just want to take a look at it.

404
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:24,372
We think it may have become
inadvertently activated,

405
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:27,167
and it's... Well, it's causing
some problems for us on Atlantis.

406
00:26:27,507 --> 00:26:31,166
Long story short, we're just gonna shut
it off, and, well, we'll be on our way.

407
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:34,976
We're not here to cause any trouble.
We'd just like some assistance.

408
00:26:35,101 --> 00:26:37,510
I do not have the authority
to grant such assistance.

409
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:40,513
For that, you will need to speak
to the village magistrate.

410
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,724
All right.
Let's talk to him.

411
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:45,026
- He's not here.
- Oh, for God's sake.

412
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:46,599
How long?
This is urgent.

413
00:26:46,724 --> 00:26:49,487
He will return
when the execution is completed.

414
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:05,538
Oh, my God!

415
00:27:13,873 --> 00:27:15,040
Neeva Casol...

416
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:18,969
You have been found guilty
of the crime of murder,

417
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:20,887
and so you shall be put to death.

418
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:23,042
I am not Neeva Casol!

419
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:34,848
Don't worry.

420
00:27:34,973 --> 00:27:37,904
The executioner is strong,
his blade sharp.

421
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,534
Your death will be far less painful
than those of your victims.

422
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,437
Please... Please! Don't do this!

423
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,230
Ambush!

424
00:28:46,165 --> 00:28:47,165
What?

425
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:50,721
No thank-you for the rescue?

426
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:53,416
Let's go.

427
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:58,986
She went that way!
Find her!

428
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:03,155
Go back to the village,
gather more men.

429
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,701
I want that ancestral ring guarded!

430
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:08,529
No one leaves this planet!

431
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:11,520
We're too late.

432
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:20,007
I don't believe this.
How did she escape?

433
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:22,159
My accomplices no doubt intervened.

434
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:24,103
This is not the first time{\
we've been in this situation}.

435
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:25,905
How many accomplices do you have?

436
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,154
- Two.
- That's all?

437
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,558
More than enough. Trust me.
You don't want to challenge them.

438
00:29:29,758 --> 00:29:31,226
Yeah? We'll see about that.

439
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:32,811
Where would they have gone?

440
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,814
I have no idea.

441
00:29:35,052 --> 00:29:36,905
All right, Chewie. Start trackin'.

442
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,303
Yeah. I'm on it.

443
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:50,883
You looked frightened out there.

444
00:29:51,008 --> 00:29:52,831
What, you didn't think
we'd save you?

445
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:54,490
I just...

446
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:56,419
After how many times
you saved our hides?

447
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,462
We weren't gonna let you down.

448
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:02,674
You all right?

449
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:04,524
You look confused.

450
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,432
No, I'm just...
You know, happy to be out of there.

451
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:11,439
So, what's the plan?

452
00:30:12,954 --> 00:30:13,955
Plan?

453
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:16,397
What do we do now?

454
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,356
I don't know.

455
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,279
Yet. Yet... I don't know yet.

456
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:24,779
I just need...

457
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,658
more time to think.

458
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:29,376
Well, think faster.

459
00:30:30,065 --> 00:30:33,801
Because, sooner or later,
those villagers will find this cave.

460
00:30:34,112 --> 00:30:36,291
And I don't want to be here
when they do.

461
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:37,677
Right.

462
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:39,739
Good point.

463
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:46,733
This way.

464
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,897
That's the third patrol
in the last 10 minutes.

465
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,233
It seems as if the entire village
is out looking for her.

466
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:04,064
Let's hope we find her
before they do.

467
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:32,511
What the hell happened?

468
00:31:33,756 --> 00:31:34,863
I lost her.

469
00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:37,597
- Are there no tracks?
- There's nothing.

470
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,051
She's good.

471
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:46,614
Listen, I think the best plan of action
is to leave this planet.

472
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:49,175
Now, I know of another planet.
We'll be safe there.

473
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,250
They'll be guarding the ring.

474
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:52,429
I know.

475
00:31:52,862 --> 00:31:55,612
Maybe we could create
some kind of diversion?

476
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,541
Well, how do we do that?

477
00:32:00,138 --> 00:32:01,465
I don't know...

478
00:32:03,196 --> 00:32:06,627
Maybe...
Maybe we can set an explosion.

479
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,821
And why would they run
toward an explosion?

480
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:11,447
Or something else.

481
00:32:13,987 --> 00:32:15,682
I say we wait till nightfall...

482
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:20,196
then we'll launch
an attack on the ring.

483
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:22,229
- Catch them by surprise.
- An attack?

484
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:26,055
We kill the guards, activate the ring,
and we make our escape.

485
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,778
I agree.

486
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:33,992
But if I think of something else
before then, maybe we could...

487
00:32:41,898 --> 00:32:43,084
All right, don't shoot.

488
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:46,230
Who are you?

489
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:50,339
I'm... Neeva Casol.

490
00:32:52,411 --> 00:32:54,192
All right, let me explain.

491
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,491
Back at the artifact vault,

492
00:32:56,616 --> 00:32:58,290
I accidentally activated

493
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,953
some kind of
ancestral communications device

494
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:04,411
that caused my mind
to transfer into this woman's body,

495
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:05,922
and hers into mine.

496
00:33:07,818 --> 00:33:09,484
You expect us to believe that?

497
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:10,737
Yeah, Jannik, I do.

498
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:14,174
I expect you to believe that,
just as you did on Vara Sol,

499
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:17,536
when I brokered that deal
with the merchant to save your life.

500
00:33:18,421 --> 00:33:19,761
And you, Bordal.

501
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,208
If you didn't trust me back
when you got caught at that brothel,

502
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:27,335
those women would've made sure
you won't thought of provreating again.

503
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,923
- How do you know about that?
- Because I'm Neeva.

504
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:31,609
There's a link between us.

505
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:34,135
Her mind is in my body,
and mine is in hers.

506
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:39,474
Look, whatever's happening here,
I had nothing to do with it.

507
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,770
No, she didn't. But if we're gonna
fix this, we need to move fast.

508
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:45,275
We need to go back to the village,
break into the vault,

509
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,042
and turn off that device.

510
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:49,954
We need to be really careful,
cause the villagers are looking for us,

511
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,612
but so are the people from Atlantis.

512
00:33:52,236 --> 00:33:54,607
Wait a second. They're here?
Who, Colonel Sheppard?

513
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,258
Among others,

514
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:59,370
but they'll turn us in to the villagers,
so we need no problems from you.

515
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,184
Do you understand me?

516
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:04,917
All right, we need
to find this device...

517
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,085
Stop!

518
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,174
I don't know what's going on here.

519
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,175
I just told you, all right?
I am Neeva.

520
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,736
- I've never seen you before!
- Jannik, listen to me.

521
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:17,512
This is not the time to be stupid.

522
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,681
I wouldn't make him angry...

523
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:22,725
You're gonna put down the gun,
and you're gonna listen to what I say.

524
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:24,285
I'm not.

525
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:26,729
I'm gonna take the both of you
with me.

526
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:29,608
We're going to attack the ring now.

527
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:33,574
And we'll sort out who's really who
on another planet.

528
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,660
And if you're lying to me,
you're as good as dead.

529
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,965
- This Dr. McKay...
- What about him?

530
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,332
- You can do better.
- Be quiet.

531
00:34:52,236 --> 00:34:53,985
I know this is difficult
to understand...

532
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,860
I was equally confused by it
at the beginning, but you have to...

533
00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:06,881
- How many?
- I don't know!

534
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:08,906
I count four.

535
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:14,178
We'd be a lot better off
if you'd given us weapons.

536
00:35:20,738 --> 00:35:21,743
He's dead.

537
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:38,342
Hey! Come back here!

538
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:41,999
- Stop!
- Jannik, don't! Don't!

539
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,735
- Is she going to be all right?
- Aye, for now,

540
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,752
but I need to stop the bleeding.
Here, hold her steady, Rodney.

541
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,705
You two,
give us a hand here, please.

542
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:34,609
On the table, Rodney.

543
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,105
These are the people from Atlantis
I was telling you about.

544
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,421
- What happened?
- She was shot by one of your men.

545
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:41,949
I warned you it was dangerous
to venture out there.

546
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:43,432
Is she dead?

547
00:36:43,557 --> 00:36:45,607
She's badly wounded.
Teyla, gonna need a hand.

548
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:47,245
I need to remove the bullet{\i:
and stop the bleeding:i}.

549
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,997
And we need access to that terminal.
We need to shut it down right now!

550
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,876
- Why? What's it doing?
- It creates a psychic link.

551
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,034
So Dr. Keller and this Neeva Casol
have switched places.

552
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,798
- They're in each other's bodies.
- You know about Atlantis, right?

553
00:36:59,897 --> 00:37:02,260
Then you know you're better off
being our friend than our enemy.

554
00:37:02,632 --> 00:37:06,514
So why don't you be our friend
and show us where that terminal is?

555
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:10,934
This way.

556
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,733
It's still on!

557
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:28,220
Obviously. So turn it off.

558
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:29,982
Well, there's no switches.

559
00:37:30,107 --> 00:37:32,540
But it looks almost identical
to the one SG-1 found.

560
00:37:41,184 --> 00:37:42,743
There's the bullet...

561
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:46,918
Now to stem the bleeding.

562
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:55,646
I don't know who you are...

563
00:37:56,734 --> 00:38:00,703
But you are definitely not Neeva.

564
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:02,220
No, I'm not.

565
00:38:03,295 --> 00:38:06,092
But I'm not your enemy, either,
and if you'd just let me,

566
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,791
I think I can help...

567
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,433
You're not helping anyone.

568
00:38:12,482 --> 00:38:14,486
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Believe me, I'm trying!

569
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:18,003
There's no way to access crystal.
There is no way to shut this thing off!

570
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,671
All right. What if...
What if we blow it up?

571
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,359
I don't know. I mean, maybe.

572
00:38:22,484 --> 00:38:26,149
I'm just not sure if the explosion
could cause a sudden power surge...

573
00:38:26,274 --> 00:38:27,570
What the other guys did?

574
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:30,546
SG-1 dialed the Gate
and tossed the device into the vortex...

575
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:32,361
Disintegrated instantly.

576
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:34,895
But it's too far to carry back
to the Gate.

577
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:36,845
You got Bordal killed.

578
00:38:38,204 --> 00:38:40,345
And you've almost got me killed.

579
00:38:42,255 --> 00:38:44,148
I'm gonna return the favor.

580
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:48,050
We may not have much of a choice,
so give me a hand with this.

581
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,190
- I'm not sure we've got the time...
- Hold up.

582
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:51,327
Move!

583
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:08,234
- You're back?
- I'm back.

584
00:39:12,057 --> 00:39:15,627
You've been shot, love.
Don't worry, we removed the bullet.

585
00:39:15,872 --> 00:39:17,338
You'll be just fine.

586
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:23,067
Wait, Jannik.

587
00:39:23,357 --> 00:39:24,607
It's me, Neeva.

588
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:27,029
They must've turned off the device.

589
00:39:28,693 --> 00:39:29,787
Nice try.

590
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:41,635
I appreciate that, Dana.
Say hello for me.

591
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:44,029
What's the occasion?

592
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:46,173
Just visiting a friend
in the infirmary.

593
00:39:46,298 --> 00:39:48,674
- That's very thoughtful of you, Rodney.
- I know.

594
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:52,300
Major Lorne and his team just returned.
They did a full sweep of the planet.

595
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:55,853
No sign of Neeva Casol.
She must've managed to escape.

596
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,852
I don't know about that.
According to Jennifer,

597
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,047
her accomplice was about to kill her
when we shut down the terminal.

598
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:04,104
Either he did kill her and disposed
of the body before escaping himself,

599
00:40:04,229 --> 00:40:05,925
or she got away from him somehow.

600
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,610
- Well, I guess we'll never know.
- Well, we may.

601
00:40:08,735 --> 00:40:10,858
Word has gone out
to several planets in the coalition.

602
00:40:10,983 --> 00:40:14,433
If Neeva is alive and roaming free,
she won't be for long.

603
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,359
- You'll promise you'll take it easy?
- Yes, Doctor.

604
00:40:21,484 --> 00:40:23,350
Don't worry.
I'll make sure of it.

605
00:40:23,475 --> 00:40:24,989
- Hey you.
- Hey you.

606
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:27,939
Oh, thank you, Rodney.
Flowers and chocolates? I'm impressed.

607
00:40:28,064 --> 00:40:29,108
Right. Enough.

608
00:40:29,233 --> 00:40:31,138
She's alone in the infirmary.
I thought I would,

609
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,611
brighten the room up a bit.

610
00:40:36,547 --> 00:40:37,697
How you doing?

611
00:40:38,361 --> 00:40:39,611
Better. Thanks.

612
00:40:40,048 --> 00:40:43,370
Again, Radek, I am so sorry
for what happened.

613
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:46,265
It's not your fault.
I told you, don't worry.

614
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:47,611
I'm fine.

615
00:40:47,985 --> 00:40:51,198
Yeah, yeah, of course he's fine.
He's perky, ready to go back to work.

616
00:40:52,405 --> 00:40:55,660
- I don't know about that...
- He needs to get rest, too, Rodney.

617
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,913
I agree. His wound was
much more serious than mine.

618
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:00,733
Really?
I mean, you were shot.

619
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,797
He was just... stabbed.

620
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:06,300
Perhaps I should wheel you
to another room?

621
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,422
Just until he's gone, please.
Thank you.

622
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:09,931
Aye. Right.

623
00:41:18,272 --> 00:41:19,785
I completely agree.

624
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:26,108
- Chocolates?
- Thank you.

625
00:41:28,298 --> 00:41:30,814
So... I was thinking that...

626
00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:33,858
when you're feeling better,
we could maybe...

627
00:41:33,983 --> 00:41:35,633
you know, go for a ride.

628
00:41:36,357 --> 00:41:39,021
- A ride?
- Yeah, take the puddle Jumper,

629
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:42,833
go to the mainland, maybe have a picnic,
maybe lie out under the stars?

630
00:41:45,918 --> 00:41:46,919
What?

631
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:50,171
You did turn off
that communication terminal, right?

632
00:41:50,296 --> 00:41:52,045
There's no one else in there?

633
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,384
No, it's really me.

634
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:55,404
'Cause a puddle Jumper ride

635
00:41:55,545 --> 00:41:57,298
and the picnic under the stars...

636
00:41:57,423 --> 00:41:59,982
- I mean, that's just so...
- So not me. Right, okay.

637
00:42:00,107 --> 00:42:01,292
No, bad idea.

638
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,356
I think it's a great idea.
