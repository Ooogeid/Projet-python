1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,446
Atlantis, this is Sheppard.
I'm on approach to the Gate.

2
00:00:06,526 --> 00:00:07,498
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:11,096
You know, since I've been in Pegasus,
I have set up, like, what,

4
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:14,654
half a dozen research stations on
various planets and I don't remember you

5
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:18,153
ever volunteering to run
a re-supply mission to any of them.

6
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:22,218
I'm a busy man, Rodney. Just
happened to have a little free time.

7
00:00:22,298 --> 00:00:23,567
<i>And Doctor Mackenzie just</i>

8
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:27,340
happens to be studying a primitive
tribe that lives in a tropical paradise

9
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:30,750
and has, how did he put it,
"little or no social inhibitions."

10
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:32,768
Well, they were very friendly.

11
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:36,322
What the hell?

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,121
What is it?

13
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:43,205
I think somebody just took a shot at me.

14
00:00:43,774 --> 00:00:45,734
<i>I've got a contact.
They're closin' fast.</i>

15
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:47,041
What is it, Wraith?

16
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:48,633
I don't think so, but...

17
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:53,698
Whatever they're shooting me
with just shorted my systems.

18
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:55,438
I can't get weapons online.

19
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,998
Can you make it back to the Gate?
Sheppard?

20
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,517
Sheppard?

21
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:09,231
Rodney?

22
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:10,843
McKay?

23
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:40,816

29
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:37,637
Nice ship.

30
00:02:38,149 --> 00:02:39,404
Little bit of a...

31
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:42,887
Little bit of a fixer-upper
but I can see the potential.

32
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:52,546
I'm not talking about
anything drastic, you know.

33
00:02:52,648 --> 00:02:56,015
Maybe just a paint job,
some throw pillows...

34
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:02,517
Look,

35
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,115
I don't suppose you mind
telling me what's going on here?

36
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:08,829
Here's how we're gonna do this:
I'm gonna ask you questions

37
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,262
and you're gonna give me answers.

38
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:12,346
- Is that simple enough for you?
- Sure.

39
00:03:13,254 --> 00:03:16,234
Who are you, where are you from,
and where'd you get your ship?

40
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:18,464
See, that's a funny coincidence,

41
00:03:18,544 --> 00:03:21,241
`cause I was gonna ask you
the same exact questions.

42
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:29,682
The difference is, I'm not the one
whose hands are tied behind his back.

43
00:03:30,723 --> 00:03:31,660
<i>So again,</i>

44
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:35,134
who are you, where are you
from, and where did you get your ship?

45
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,208
<i>- What happened?
- I'm not entirely sure.</i>

46
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,919
Looks like his Jumper was
attacked before he reached the Gate.

47
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,460
- By who?
- The people on the planet

48
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,785
aren't much past mud huts and blow darts
so we can assume

49
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:50,780
they had nothing to do with it.
What we do know

50
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:53,203
is that just after we lost contact
there was a short burst

51
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:55,016
of radiation in the vicinity of the Gate

52
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,242
consistent with the opening
of a hyperspace window.

53
00:03:57,412 --> 00:03:59,243
- Wraith?
- Sheppard didn't seem to think so,

54
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:02,516
and what little sensor data we've been
able to pick up seems to confirm it.

55
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,133
The energy signature's all wrong.
It's inconsistent with Ancient

56
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,584
technology as well,
which rules out the Replicators.

57
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,679
We know no other peoples in this galaxy
that possess hyperspace technology

58
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,767
Of course not. No-one reaches that level
of advancement without being culled.

59
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:15,966
So, then, who was it?

60
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:20,543
<i>I could do this all day.</i>

61
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,924
Your knuckles will get sore eventually.

62
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:32,857
Has he said anything?

63
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:35,520
Only his name: Reed Richards.

64
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:38,197
His name is Sheppard.

65
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:41,193
We intercepted
part of his last radio transmission.

66
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:43,084
I didn't get your name.

67
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:47,320
You can call me Larrin.

68
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,630
You really should co-operate.

69
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,012
Be a shame to have
to do too much damage.

70
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:55,494
I agree.

71
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,437
Maybe if you guys tell me
who you are and

72
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:01,114
what you want,

73
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:03,479
we could work out some kind of a deal.

74
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,868
Well, don't get my hopes
up and then disappoint me.

75
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:09,089
Tell him what happened
to the last man that disappointed me.

76
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:11,482
We don't know. We never found his body.

77
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,295
We assumed you blew him out into space.

78
00:05:16,177 --> 00:05:17,177
I get it.

79
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:18,948
Good.

80
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:21,305
Bring him.

81
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:24,657
Get up.

82
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:38,014
Another form of torture?

83
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:40,113
When you spend as much
time in space as we do,

84
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:41,684
you don't get a lot of fresh food.

85
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:44,429
How much

86
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:46,825
time are we talking about?

87
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:52,734
This is a conversation, right?

88
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:54,572
A two-way street?

89
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:57,167
This is our home.

90
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:01,493
- This ship?
- And others like it.

91
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:03,250
We're travellers.

92
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:07,167
You live in space all the time?

93
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:10,731
We land on planets
when we need to for supplies, trade.

94
00:06:11,124 --> 00:06:12,920
The rest of the time we keep moving.

95
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:14,386
From the Wraith?

96
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:16,603
<i>That may have been how it started,</i>

97
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:19,181
but now it's just who we are.

98
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:22,493
Well, no offence, Larrin.

99
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:24,779
Doesn't sound like much of a life.

100
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:27,662
Being a herd animal
isn't much of a life.

101
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:29,849
Besides,

102
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:33,348
the food has all the nutrients required.

103
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:36,678
Well, as tempting as that sounds,

104
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,101
my jaw's a little sore right now.

105
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:42,416
Things like that are
necessary from time to time.

106
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:45,368
Although it's not the most efficient way
of getting information,

107
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,124
it does help people to understand

108
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:50,265
their situation.

109
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:52,352
My situation being

110
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:54,137
completely at your mercy.

111
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:55,447
Exactly.

112
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:58,244
<i>Anyway, I know more
about you than you think.</i>

113
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:00,053
Really?

114
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:04,593
For instance, I know you carry the gene
required to operate Lantian technology.

115
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:07,137
I've got the what?

116
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:11,160
Look, Sheppard,
I know you have your secrets,

117
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,370
and if you stay on my good side,
I may even let you keep a few of them.

118
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,085
However, if you continue
to play ignorant with me,

119
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:20,193
I really will jettison you out
into space.

120
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:24,596
For some time now, we've been hearing
rumours about a new group of humans in

121
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:27,993
the galaxy using the technology of the
Ancestors to do battle with the Wraith,

122
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:32,082
so we set up a network of spy satellites
around dozens of worlds

123
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:34,843
with space Gates,
hoping for an encounter.

124
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,438
Eventually we got lucky.

125
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:41,046
In the first meeting between our people,
you attack me and disarm my ship.

126
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,415
Well, you were going through the Gate
and I couldn't let that happen.

127
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:47,550
You see, anyone capable
of operating Lantian technology

128
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,804
is of particular interest to us.

129
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:52,356
That's why you took
a sample of my blood.

130
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:56,098
We're working on a control interface
adaptor that requires a small amount

131
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:58,021
of necessary genetic material.

132
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:00,420
We needed your blood to test it.

133
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:03,109
I'm gonna guess it didn't go so well.

134
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:04,890
Why would you say that?

135
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,900
Then you wouldn't have
any use for me any more.

136
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,518
Don't underestimate yourself.

137
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,623
There's all kinds of useful
things you could do for me.

138
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:15,123
<i>Commander,
we're approaching the coordinates.</i>

139
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:18,228
Understood. Take us out of hyperspace.

140
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:22,045
Of course, you're right. The interface
isn't fully operational yet.

141
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:23,991
<i>Come with me.</i>

142
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:30,389
Nevik, my chief science officer, insists

143
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,373
that we have a much better chance
of perfecting the interface

144
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:36,324
if we reverse-engineer it
using Lantian technology

145
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:38,255
that's already been initialised.

146
00:08:38,337 --> 00:08:40,999
I don't even know
what reverse engineering is.

147
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,237
You wanna use my ship.

148
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:45,719
Not exactly.

149
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:56,946
Activate the force shield.

150
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,735
<i>Sheppard, can you hear me?</i>

151
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:05,922
D'you mind telling me what you're doing?

152
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:07,785
Offering you a deal.

153
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:10,009
Open the Hangar Bay doors.

154
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,938
This is just not right!

155
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,706
Don't worry. You're safe as long as
the force shield doesn't malfunction,

156
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:27,650
and that almost never happens.

157
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:29,757
Why are you doing this?

158
00:09:30,351 --> 00:09:33,136
<i>You wanted to know what
this is all about. Look beneath you.</i>

159
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:39,655
<i>I'm assuming
you recognise the technology?</i>

160
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,547
<i>It's a Lantian battleship.</i>

161
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,507
It's been dormant
for thousands of years,

162
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:46,004
and you're gonna help me
get it operational again.

163
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:03,315
<i>Has it occurred to you
they might have abandoned the ship</i>

164
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:05,037
for a good reason in the first place?

165
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:08,193
We know the reason.
We were able to access the ship's logs.

166
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:09,744
They were attacked by the Wraith.

167
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:12,066
They lost communication
and the shields were failing.

168
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,619
The engines were damaged as well but
they managed to escape into hyperspace,

169
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,283
then they realised that their main
drive was giving off deadly radiation.

170
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:21,042
They were forced to abandon ship.

171
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:24,158
They intended to return and effect
repairs but never got the chance.

172
00:10:24,472 --> 00:10:27,431
The ship's been drifting
in a two hundred year elliptical orbit

173
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:29,533
around a nearby dwarf star ever since.

174
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:31,624
So it's never been fixed?

175
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:35,096
- No.
<i>- I hate to point out the obvious,</i>

176
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,456
but one of the reasons I agreed to help
you was so that you wouldn't kill me.

177
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,387
<i>If I'm gonna die of radiation anyway...</i>

178
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:42,395
Don't worry.
We've set up shield emitters

179
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,112
to protect key areas of the ship,

180
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,259
and we've all got radiation detectors.

181
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,830
Take him to the Bridge.
Start with sub-light propulsion.

182
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,243
I'll go check the emitters.

183
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:55,920
Don't think I can get one of those too,
do you?

184
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:02,006
Here.

185
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:07,831
You know this ship is
ten thousand years old?

186
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:12,624
I'm just saying for the record.
If it doesn't work, it's not my fault.

187
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:13,791
Just get on with it.

188
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:25,212
It's amazing. I've been trying
for 2 months to activate these systems.

189
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:28,168
I need to calibrate the interface
from your neural input.

190
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:30,468
Why don't you start
by moving the ship forward?

191
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:32,217
You sure about that?

192
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:33,520
That's why we're here.

193
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:37,021
You fly the ship and I record
the inputs so I can replicate them.

194
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:39,053
- OK, but...
- Enough.

195
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,236
Fly the damn ship.

196
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:44,131
Right....

197
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:46,845
I just was gonna say,

198
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:49,552
you said,
"Start by moving the ship forward,

199
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:53,700
when you should have said, "Start
by initialising the inertial dampeners."

200
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,740
Wait!

201
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,012
My friend's got a gun just like this.

202
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:11,941
- Always wondered where he'd got it.
- I'm gonna kill you.

203
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:19,064
Silas, what happened?

204
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:23,683
<i>Nevik, what's going on up there?</i>

205
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:26,295
Sorry, your people are unavailable
right now.

206
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:28,783
Sheppard, what are you doing?

207
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,187
<i>You said, "Fly the ship."</i>

208
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:31,591
I'm flying the ship.

209
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:46,102
We had a deal. I was prepared
to let you go in exchange for your help.

210
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:48,812
Sorry. I've never been able
to trust anyone who kidnaps me,

211
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:51,091
tortures me and threatens
to blow me into space.

212
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:00,449
We've got nothing.

213
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,300
There's no wreckage,
no transponder signal.

214
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,125
If he was down there,
we'd have found him.

215
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:05,805
- Then where is he?
- He's not in orbit

216
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,465
and he's not on the planet. The only
logical assumption is whoever

217
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:11,478
attacked him must have brought him on
board before jumping into hyperspace.

218
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:14,082
- So what's the next step?
- There is no next step.

219
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,770
Look, we have no way of tracing him. He
could be anywhere in the galaxy by now.

220
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,265
I'm sorry, but sometimes
there is just nothing we can do.

221
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:25,295
<i>Sheppard? I want you
to drop this ship out of hyperspace.</i>

222
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:26,890
I don't think so.

223
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:28,273
<i>Listen to me.</i>

224
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:31,058
I've shut off the shield emitters
protecting your area of the ship.

225
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:33,768
Right now, the Bridge
is being flooded with radiation.

226
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:38,710
You're bluffing.

227
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:41,221
You'd never sacrifice your own people.

228
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:52,362
<i>I don't wanna kill you, but if you don't
turn over the controls of this ship,</i>

229
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:53,590
<i>I'll have no choice.</i>

230
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:09,486
You surprised me, Sheppard.

231
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:12,259
Well, as long as
I didn't disappoint you.

232
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:16,140
Oh no, I knew you'd make
some sort of a move. I just...

233
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:19,168
wasn't expecting anything quite so...

234
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:21,367
Clever? Creative?

235
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:24,881
Reckless. You could have killed
all of us, including yourself.

236
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:29,019
I once pulled eleven gees
in an F-16 without passing out.

237
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:31,633
- I figured I had a shot.
- Why, I underestimated you.

238
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:33,005
Yeah, I feel the same way.

239
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:36,158
I mean, you've got the whole
tough-as-nails routine down pat,

240
00:14:36,238 --> 00:14:39,016
but exposing your own people
to killer radiation?

241
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:42,640
Takes a special kind of lady
to do that, doesn't it?

242
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:44,851
Larrin?

243
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:51,706
It's not good. He shut down
propulsion and navigation systems

244
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:53,564
before he turned over the Bridge.

245
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:54,850
Of course he did!

246
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:58,543
<i>Did you collect enough data
to finish the control interface?</i>

247
00:14:58,623 --> 00:14:59,739
<i>I don't know. Maybe.</i>

248
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,135
Nevik, if you can't do this,
we're stranded.

249
00:15:04,622 --> 00:15:05,639
What about him?

250
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:08,380
He's not going anywhere near
that bridge again. He can't be trusted.

251
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,677
If we can't bring that system back
online, he'll die like the rest of us.

252
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:15,101
That's the problem! Does he look like
a man who thinks he's going to die?

253
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:20,245
Check the sub-space
communications array.

254
00:15:20,423 --> 00:15:23,009
Ancients lost the communications
in the battle with the Wraith.

255
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,559
The system was never repaired.

256
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:26,338
Check it.

257
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:43,978
What've you got?

258
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:46,746
Ah. Remember how I said
sometimes there's nothing we can do?

259
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,432
I was right about that... only it turns
out this is not one of those times.

260
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:52,193
You found him.

261
00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:54,174
More like he found us. Listen to this.

262
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:58,173
That is the sound of sub-space.

263
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:01,667
It's mostly just random noise
generated by various forms of radiation,

264
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:04,973
but the Ancients in their infinite
wisdom created a programme

265
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:06,750
that can sniff out artificial patterns.

266
00:16:06,977 --> 00:16:10,116
Now, t's no doubt a long-range means
of detecting advanced life forms...

267
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:12,554
kind of like our SETI programme,
only much more powerful

268
00:16:12,644 --> 00:16:15,775
`cause it operates through sub-space.
Anyway, it's... it picked up this.

269
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:20,637
What is it?

270
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:23,373
That's Sheppard. I don't know why
he didn't send a regular message

271
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:26,449
but maybe he was dealing with a damaged
transmitter, or maybe to communicate

272
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:28,507
without being detected, but
it's definitely him.

273
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,831
How d'you know it's him?

274
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:32,333
It's Morse code. SOS.

275
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:40,837
What's happening?

276
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,024
What was that for?

277
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,798
D'you realise what you've done?

278
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:48,268
I didn't do anything.

279
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,762
- Stop that!
- I'll stop when you stop lying.

280
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:59,965
You adapted the damaged communications
array to send out a signal, didn't you?

281
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:03,599
Yes.

282
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:09,713
You said you'd stop that!

283
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,044
You were right.
Maybe I'll just shoot you.

284
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:17,264
All right, don't you think
you're over-reacting a little?

285
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:19,172
You were trying
to broadcast our location.

286
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:20,584
Guess what? It worked.

287
00:17:20,703 --> 00:17:23,940
There's a ship approaching, only I don't
think it's the one you were hoping for.

288
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:25,581
What do you mean?

289
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:27,101
It's the Wraith!

290
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:47,649
- The Wraith ship is firing on us.
- Do we have shields?

291
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:51,720
Affirmative... but they're only at 20%.
We can't take this for very long.

292
00:17:57,748 --> 00:18:00,426
If you're gonna get out of this alive,
you're gonna need my help.

293
00:18:01,216 --> 00:18:02,471
Now I realise

294
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:06,223
you and I don't exactly
trust each other...

295
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:08,107
but...

296
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:10,780
it's not gonna make much difference

297
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,261
if the Wraith blow the ship up, is it?

298
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,908
What've you got in mind?

299
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,583
Well, you could start by shooting back.

300
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:23,293
Right.

301
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:30,576
The weapons control platform is down the
corridor. I'm headed back to the bridge.

302
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:32,335
Keep the shields up as long as you can.

303
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:47,647
Great!

304
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:54,603
Piece of cake.

305
00:18:57,365 --> 00:18:58,664
Shields are down.

306
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,853
Can't you re-route any more power?

307
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:04,270
There's nothing I can do.

308
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:28,935
Silas, Nevik, what happened?

309
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:31,990
Do you read me?

310
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,883
<i>- It's Sheppard.</i>
- I didn't give you a communicator.

311
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:04,099
I activated the ship's intercom.
What happened?

312
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:06,953
I don't know.
The forward section has been sealed off.

313
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,426
<i>What about your people?</i>

314
00:20:09,384 --> 00:20:10,884
They're not responding.

315
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,589
The good news is
the Wraith ship's been destroyed.

316
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,188
Stay where you are. I'm coming to you.

317
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,336
<i>Sheppard, where are you?</i>

318
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,832
Auxiliary control room.

319
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,606
I'm sorry about this.

320
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,545
<i>What are you doing?</i>

321
00:20:49,222 --> 00:20:50,794
For the moment, not much.

322
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,743
Hyperdrive seems to be offline.

323
00:20:53,925 --> 00:20:54,800
<i>What?</i>

324
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:56,966
How bad is it?

325
00:20:57,142 --> 00:21:00,170
<i>Well, it's not exactly
my area of expertise</i>

326
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:02,901
but if I'm reading this thing right,

327
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:06,550
the drive itself is undamaged. Probably
just a short in the control system.

328
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,896
Then we can take care of it
through a simple bypass.

329
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,916
Just let me out
and I should be able to fix it.

330
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:14,826
- I don't think so.
- We're a floating target out here!

331
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,728
All right, take it easy.

332
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:20,563
I've got the transmitter off. My people
should have gotten the message by now.

333
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:24,427
<i>There is no reason to assume that Wraith
ship didn't broadcast our position.</i>

334
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:26,520
Well, there's no reason
to assume they did.

335
00:21:26,674 --> 00:21:27,863
Listen to me, Sheppard.

336
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:30,374
I've spent my entire life
around hyperdrive systems.

337
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:33,383
- I know what I'm doing.
- I never said I didn't believe you.

338
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:35,210
Don't worry...

339
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:37,623
my people will be here.

340
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:55,919
Sheppard was broadcasting from somewhere
in the vicinity of this system.

341
00:21:57,618 --> 00:21:59,544
Well,
sensors aren't picking up anything.

342
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,806
Let me see if I can expand
the range a little.

343
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:05,929
There.

344
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:07,293
What is it?

345
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,141
It could be a ship.

346
00:22:09,816 --> 00:22:12,283
It's still too far to get any details
but that's gotta be them.

347
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:14,239
How long to get there
at maximum sub-light?

348
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,821
It's five hours.

349
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,400
This is Lorne to all Jumpers.
I'm sending you some coordinates.

350
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,317
Proceed to target at maximum sub-light.

351
00:22:21,397 --> 00:22:22,397
Go ahead.

352
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,319
Larrin,

353
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:37,619
what are you doing?

354
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:39,517
<i>Look,</i>

355
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,795
<i>once my people get here
and get the hyperdrive back online,</i>

356
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,250
<i>we'll drop you off at the nearest Gate.
You have my word.</i>

357
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:47,190
Not good enough.

358
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:49,388
What, my word or my deal?

359
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:51,022
Yeah, well, both.

360
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:54,295
You're the one
who kidnapped me, remember?

361
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:55,700
Because I need the ship.

362
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,383
<i>There.</i>

363
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:02,670
<i>I did you a favour.</i>

364
00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:06,715
Sheppard,

365
00:23:08,294 --> 00:23:09,304
listen to me.

366
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:11,815
Our fleet is old.

367
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:14,482
<i>There was a time when we had
the resources to build new ships,</i>

368
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:15,580
<i>but now we don't.</i>

369
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:18,235
<i>When we lose one, it's gone for good,</i>

370
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:21,411
<i>and despite strict population controls</i>

371
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:24,319
there just isn't enough room
for all of us any more.

372
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,932
We've been forced to abandon
some of our own people on the ground.

373
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:33,967
Well, they're no worse off than the rest
of the people in this galaxy.

374
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:36,577
Fine.

375
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:40,950
We'll do this the hard way.

376
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:47,599
Larrin, what are you doing?

377
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:04,616
Sheppard, you are really
starting to annoy me!

378
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:07,372
Just sit tight.
It'll be over soon enough.

379
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:10,554
Silas, Nevik, come in?

380
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,344
Silas, do you read me?

381
00:24:13,572 --> 00:24:15,943
<i>- Give it up. They're gone.</i>
- You don't know that.

382
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:17,727
No, but I can find out.

383
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:31,985
Looks like there's no-one alive
in the forward section.

384
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,267
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

385
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:40,979
Larrin, where are you going?

386
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:46,513
I can track you anywhere on the ship.
You can't hide from me.

387
00:24:56,316 --> 00:24:58,810
I'm picking up another life sign
directly in front of you.

388
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:00,155
Silas!

389
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:03,982
That's impossible. There's no way
he got out of that section alive.

390
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:43,789
You all right?

391
00:25:44,347 --> 00:25:45,347
I'm fine.

392
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:47,070
It just caught me off guard.

393
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:50,409
They must have escaped in the Darts
before their ship was destroyed.

394
00:25:51,355 --> 00:25:54,284
We left the hangar bay pressurised,
they flew right in.

395
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:56,297
- They?
- Yeah, there's three more.

396
00:25:56,947 --> 00:25:58,317
We can track `em with this.

397
00:25:58,514 --> 00:25:59,774
Where'd you get that?

398
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:01,240
Auxiliary control room.

399
00:26:01,372 --> 00:26:03,061
Gotta know where to look. Come on.

400
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,125
Get his weapon.

401
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,441
Tenacious little bastards, aren't they?

402
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:18,182
Don't suppose you have
any more of these?

403
00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:19,721
I'm afraid not.

404
00:26:20,297 --> 00:26:22,430
And I don't think
this is gonna be much good either.

405
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:33,899
Hold on!

406
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:35,994
Got one coming this way.

407
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:44,459
What now?

408
00:26:58,352 --> 00:27:00,989
Wait, no, Sheppard...
What? What are you doing?

409
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:05,121
What? Oh, I can't believe
you're playing this...

410
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,540
There's the other two.

411
00:27:35,568 --> 00:27:37,336
What, are they having a board meeting?

412
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:49,373
No use. I've done everything to boost
the sensors. It's still too far out.

413
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:51,186
So we have no idea
what we're dealing with?

414
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:53,455
Why so far out
on the edge of the solar system?

415
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:55,574
Don't think it's a coincidence
there's a space Gate.

416
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:57,066
They were probably headed for it

417
00:27:57,146 --> 00:27:59,358
- when they dropped out of hyperspace.
- Why would they?

418
00:27:59,438 --> 00:28:01,389
How should I know?
We don't know who they are.

419
00:28:01,692 --> 00:28:03,222
Does it make a difference?

420
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,583
Even if it was a fleet of hive ships,

421
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:09,003
would it stop us
from trying to get him back?

422
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:13,345
No.

423
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:17,240
You know, none of this'd have happened
if you would have just cooperated.

424
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,927
You'd be home by now,
and I'd be headed back to my people

425
00:28:20,063 --> 00:28:22,608
with a ship that could house
a thousand men, women, and children.

426
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,036
If you had asked for my help in the
first place instead of attacking me...

427
00:28:26,116 --> 00:28:28,236
- We couldn't risk it.
- Risk what?

428
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:31,207
You might have said no.

429
00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:39,197
They're leaving.

430
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:52,448
Hold up.

431
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:54,259
We got a problem.

432
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,684
They're between us and the control room.

433
00:28:57,766 --> 00:28:59,300
Should be able to find a way around.

434
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,768
There isn't enough time.
We can't risk them finding it first.

435
00:29:01,854 --> 00:29:04,384
What does it matter?
It's not like they can fly the ship.

436
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:06,833
Sheppard...

437
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,146
you did shut down the controls, right?

438
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:12,961
- Sheppard...
- There wasn't enough time.

439
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,137
If they find that control room
before we do,

440
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:17,096
they'll not only be able
to fly the ship,

441
00:29:17,182 --> 00:29:19,889
but they're going to be able to track us
using the internal sensors.

442
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:22,583
Believe me, I know, and by the way,

443
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:25,202
I was busy saving your life at the time.

444
00:29:25,445 --> 00:29:28,740
The only reason my life
was in danger in the first place

445
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,079
is because you decided to broadcast
our position to half the galaxy.

446
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:37,657
Do you want to argue about this,
or do you want to do something about it?

447
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,765
Fine.

448
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:40,586
What are the options?

449
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,025
Well, we're cut off
from the control room,

450
00:29:44,192 --> 00:29:45,584
and we have no weapons.

451
00:29:45,674 --> 00:29:47,406
That's not true. We have the chair.

452
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:50,547
I don't think drones are going to do
any good with a bunch of Wraith

453
00:29:50,628 --> 00:29:51,942
in the middle of the ship.

454
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,533
What if they weren't in the middle?

455
00:29:56,324 --> 00:29:57,453
Get serious.

456
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:58,987
You got a better idea?

457
00:30:06,815 --> 00:30:07,897
All right.

458
00:30:08,526 --> 00:30:09,631
I'm in position.

459
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:12,695
Wait for my signal.

460
00:30:12,775 --> 00:30:14,576
<i>You sure you want to go
through with this?</i>

461
00:30:14,758 --> 00:30:16,283
I mean, if you don't make it,

462
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:18,964
I'm going to feel responsible, and,

463
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:21,037
well, I really don't need the guilt.

464
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:23,629
I'll be fine as long as
you don't shoot too early.

465
00:30:23,877 --> 00:30:26,446
I'm sure it's not the first time
you've heard that from a woman.

466
00:30:26,526 --> 00:30:29,067
On the other hand,
I might be able to live with it.

467
00:30:34,025 --> 00:30:35,025
I got 'em.

468
00:30:36,528 --> 00:30:37,534
Here we go.

469
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:06,810
Sheppard, now!

470
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:43,430
Larrin, come in.

471
00:31:47,556 --> 00:31:48,735
Larrin?

472
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,109
And now,

473
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,789
before I take the rest of your life,

474
00:32:04,015 --> 00:32:05,814
you will answer my questions.

475
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:09,455
How many more of your people
are on this ship?

476
00:32:10,677 --> 00:32:12,225
<i>I do not have to kill you,</i>

477
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:14,373
<i>nor do I have to leave you like this.</i>

478
00:32:14,576 --> 00:32:17,092
<i>It would be better if you cooperated.</i>

479
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:19,268
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

480
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:21,103
Tell me,

481
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:24,245
how many more of you

482
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:25,809
<i>are onboard?</i>

483
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:32,061
It only takes one.

484
00:32:35,057 --> 00:32:36,581
I see that you've just fed,

485
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:40,304
which means that your regeneration
powers are at their highest,

486
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:42,123
but...

487
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:44,762
I seriously doubt
you can grow a new head.

488
00:32:46,593 --> 00:32:47,642
What do you want?

489
00:32:47,808 --> 00:32:48,808
First,

490
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:50,697
you're going to hand me the stunner.

491
00:32:51,107 --> 00:32:52,108
Slowly.

492
00:32:59,831 --> 00:33:00,831
<i>Next,</i>

493
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,457
you're going to get back what you took.

494
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:05,377
Then, you're going to leave.

495
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,442
- Leave?
- You came in a dart, right?

496
00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:09,853
The bay was unguarded.

497
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:12,832
We landed our darts
and entered unchallenged.

498
00:33:12,932 --> 00:33:15,188
Well, then, you're going to leave
the same way you came.

499
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:18,075
There's a space Gate orbiting
the second planet in this system.

500
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,220
It may take you a while,
but you'll get there.

501
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:22,852
If I restore her,

502
00:33:23,143 --> 00:33:25,673
<i>there's nothing to stop you
from going back on your word</i>

503
00:33:25,784 --> 00:33:27,181
and killing me anyway.

504
00:33:28,454 --> 00:33:29,454
That's true.

505
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:32,868
I'd say there's a 50-50 chance
i'll do it out of pure spite,

506
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,077
but...

507
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:35,684
if you don't,

508
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,869
I will kill you.

509
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:10,627
Get up.

510
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,081
Turn around.

511
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,612
You all right?

512
00:34:29,707 --> 00:34:30,707
I don't know.

513
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:33,821
That was so strange.

514
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:35,910
To have your...

515
00:34:36,926 --> 00:34:38,901
whole life fading away, and then to...

516
00:34:39,426 --> 00:34:40,819
suddenly have it back again.

517
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:45,064
It actually felt kind of good.

518
00:34:45,722 --> 00:34:46,724
I know.

519
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:48,214
Happened to me once, too.

520
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:49,866
Long story.

521
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:51,558
Think you can get up?

522
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:53,084
Yeah.

523
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,911
Easy...

524
00:35:00,518 --> 00:35:02,064
I'm okay. I'm all right.

525
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,239
You saved my life.

526
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:07,712
Again.

527
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:12,560
If you hadn't come up with the plan,
we'd both be dead.

528
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:14,719
So are you saying we make a good team?

529
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,280
Well, don't go crazy.

530
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:18,990
Right,

531
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:22,697
but in the interest of...

532
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:25,605
interstellar relations,

533
00:35:26,782 --> 00:35:28,812
I think we should at least just...

534
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:30,683
try to get along,

535
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:32,880
right?

536
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:45,808
You've got to be kidding me.

537
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:47,335
Sorry.

538
00:36:22,544 --> 00:36:23,544
Larrin...

539
00:36:24,108 --> 00:36:25,679
Sorry about this, Sheppard,

540
00:36:26,376 --> 00:36:28,585
and I really am grateful
you saved my life.

541
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,505
Well, you've got
a funny way of showing it.

542
00:36:31,585 --> 00:36:33,111
<i>Don't play hurt with me.</i>

543
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:36,005
<i>It's easy to be generous when
you think you have the upper hand.</i>

544
00:36:36,085 --> 00:36:37,477
What are you talking about?

545
00:36:37,557 --> 00:36:40,148
We both know the only reason
you didn't stun me and lock me up

546
00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:42,385
the first opportunity you got
was because you thought

547
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:44,790
your ships were going to get here first.

548
00:36:46,147 --> 00:36:48,271
You were wrong about that, by the way.

549
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,879
<i>It's good to see you again.</i>

550
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,317
Believe me,

551
00:37:04,581 --> 00:37:06,726
I feel the same way.
How did you find us?

552
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:10,839
<i>Well, we were monitoring communications
before you jumped into hyperspace.</i>

553
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,264
You knew he took the ship?

554
00:37:13,776 --> 00:37:15,762
<i>It seemed fairly obvious.</i>

555
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:18,479
<i>We guessed his priority would be
to contact his people,</i>

556
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:20,676
<i>so we sent probes to all the space Gates</i>

557
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:22,639
<i>in the vicinity
of our previous position.</i>

558
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:25,350
<i>Eventually,
we detected your energy signature.</i>

559
00:37:26,405 --> 00:37:27,411
Well done.

560
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:29,890
Now, I want you to send over
a couple of technicians

561
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,887
to help me get
the hyperdrive back online.

562
00:37:33,915 --> 00:37:36,152
And a security team as well.

563
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:37,650
<i>Right away.</i>

564
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:50,058
Oh, come on.

565
00:37:58,566 --> 00:38:01,186
All right, close enough to do
a full sensor sweep.

566
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,044
Looks like we got four ships,

567
00:38:05,603 --> 00:38:07,746
one of them Lantian design.
Aurora class.

568
00:38:08,016 --> 00:38:10,584
- What about the other 3?
- I don't recognize the configurations.

569
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:13,030
- What about Sheppard?
- The logical assumption is that

570
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,208
he's onboard the ship
that transmitted the signal.

571
00:38:15,288 --> 00:38:17,902
- And which one is that?
- Well, I have no idea.

572
00:38:17,993 --> 00:38:21,028
We're about to enter weapons range, Doc.
Which ships do I target?

573
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,825
Perhaps we should attempt
to communicate before we attack.

574
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:26,294
- We know nothing about these people.
- <i>That's true,</i>

575
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:28,722
but right now, about the only thing
we got working for us

576
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,716
is the fact that we're cloaked. We send
a signal, we give up our position.

577
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:33,928
He's right. They could target us,
or for that matter,

578
00:38:34,008 --> 00:38:36,783
they could jump back into hyperspace.
We'd be right back at square one.

579
00:38:36,863 --> 00:38:38,847
We didn't come all
this way for nothing, right?

580
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:44,304
All right, well, I'll see if
I can figure out a way to disable them.

581
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:54,647
I thought you'd be glad to know the
hyperdrive repairs are almost complete.

582
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:56,384
Well, congratulations.

583
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,109
You got what you want.

584
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:01,637
Yes, it's true I can fly
the ship and navigate,

585
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:04,960
but there are still dozens of systems
I don't have access to,

586
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,036
and if any of the controls went down,
it would be a problem.

587
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:09,525
So finish the adapter.

588
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:13,374
You've said you can reverse-engineer the
systems that were already initialized.

589
00:39:13,465 --> 00:39:15,263
Well, yes, we can, eventually,

590
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:18,296
but it would go a lot faster
if I keep you onboard.

591
00:39:18,627 --> 00:39:20,863
You are a piece of work, you know that?

592
00:39:20,945 --> 00:39:22,686
I know you don't agree with my tactics,

593
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:25,090
but I wasn't lying about
why I need this ship.

594
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,144
I'm doing this for my people.

595
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:31,080
Look...

596
00:39:31,277 --> 00:39:34,312
I know you think you're helping
your people, but you're wrong.

597
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:37,369
Excuse me?

598
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,680
You've been running
and hiding for thousands of years.

599
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:41,152
You've survived, good for you,

600
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:42,937
but now

601
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:45,179
you're starting to see
diminishing returns.

602
00:39:45,454 --> 00:39:48,121
One more ship, that will buy you
a little more time, but ultimately,

603
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:49,708
it's not going to change anything.

604
00:39:50,169 --> 00:39:53,164
Your people are headed for a slow death.

605
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,168
What other choice do we have?

606
00:39:57,592 --> 00:39:59,154
In case you haven't heard,

607
00:39:59,603 --> 00:40:01,820
you will soon enough,
but the Wraith are under attack.

608
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:02,906
From who?

609
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,077
It's a long story, but the point is,
they're taking heavy damage,

610
00:40:06,158 --> 00:40:08,789
and if they don't get wiped out,
they're going to be vulnerable.

611
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,751
You people have hyperdrives
and advanced weapons,

612
00:40:12,384 --> 00:40:13,603
and God knows what else.

613
00:40:13,816 --> 00:40:15,158
When the time is right,

614
00:40:15,644 --> 00:40:18,229
that kind of technology
can tip the balance.

615
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:23,152
Are you suggesting an alliance?

616
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:26,883
Well, I'm not asking you to dinner,
but yeah, something like that.

617
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:29,257
After all I put you through?

618
00:40:29,632 --> 00:40:31,903
Well, like you said,
you did it for your people.

619
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:35,772
I may have misjudged you after all.

620
00:40:39,448 --> 00:40:41,942
All right, Doc, we're in weapons range.
What do you got for me?

621
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,076
We can target
the Lantian ship's engines.

622
00:40:44,282 --> 00:40:45,469
What about the others?

623
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:48,027
I've been going over the data,
but there's too many unknowns.

624
00:40:48,107 --> 00:40:50,882
If we hit them in the wrong spot,
we could blow them out of the sky, or

625
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:53,583
the drones could bounce harmlessly
off the shields. No way to know.

626
00:40:53,663 --> 00:40:56,920
All right, well, it's still our best
option. We can't risk them getting away.

627
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:10,698
They're gone.

628
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:22,496
I'm getting a contact.

629
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,372
It's a Jumper.

630
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:26,672
One life sign.

631
00:41:27,232 --> 00:41:29,753
Colonel Sheppard, this is
major Lorne. Is that you?

632
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:31,638
<i>That's affirmative, Major.</i>

633
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,175
It's good to hear from you.

634
00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:35,710
<i>Likewise, Sir.</i>

635
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:38,294
<i>Seemed like we came pretty close
to losing you there.</i>

636
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:42,502
You don't know the half of it.

637
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:55,996
- That's good!
- Really.

638
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,198
Spend enough time
with a bunch of space nomads,

639
00:41:59,278 --> 00:42:01,557
you really begin
to appreciate what you have.

640
00:42:01,762 --> 00:42:05,295
It's difficult to imagine spending
one's entire life on board a ship.

641
00:42:05,722 --> 00:42:07,068
If that was me, I'd go crazy.

642
00:42:07,148 --> 00:42:09,039
<i>They're not 
the most even-keeled people.</i>

643
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,985
<i>I'm still not exactly sure
why they let me go.</i>

644
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:13,864
Well, you did offer them an alliance.
That has to be worth something.

645
00:42:13,982 --> 00:42:16,349
Or they figured out you'd be
more trouble than you're worth.

646
00:42:17,514 --> 00:42:19,238
That is a possibility.

647
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:21,405
No, there's something
you're not telling us.

648
00:42:22,689 --> 00:42:24,041
She was hot, wasn't she?

649
00:42:24,396 --> 00:42:26,052
I don't know what you're talking about.

650
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:27,925
I knew it! That is so typical!

651
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:29,886
She had me beat, Rodney.

652
00:42:30,697 --> 00:42:32,615
<i>She threatened to kill me several times.</i>

653
00:42:32,754 --> 00:42:34,914
It wasn't like we were hanging out
in the spa together.

654
00:42:35,017 --> 00:42:38,076
Whatever! All I know is that every time
I get taken captive, it's the Wraith.

655
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:41,977
Just once, I would like
to be taken prisoner by the sexy alien.

656
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,188
- Well, you may still get a chance.
- Yeah? What do you mean?

657
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:47,132
She's still out there.
