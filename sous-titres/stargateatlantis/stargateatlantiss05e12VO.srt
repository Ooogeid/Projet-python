00:00:00,441 --> 00:00:02,422
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:03,314 --> 00:00:05,467
- What is it?
- Something that will one day make us

3
00:00:05,627 --> 00:00:07,344
completely immune to the Wraith.

4
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:09,929
We want to test the serum's
effectiveness against your prisoner.

5
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:13,308
We're talking about putting a human
in the same room as a starving Wraith.

6
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,020
The test subject is a terminally ill
patient who has volunteered himself.

7
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:21,399
What have you done to me?

8
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:24,402
We've been tracking what appears to be
a new sickness in the Pegasus galaxy.

9
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:26,112
It's a unique protein created

10
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:28,798
by the inhabitants
of a planet called Hoff.

11
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:31,355
It was designed to interfere
with the Wraith's feeding mechanism,

12
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:32,959
making them immune to the process.

13
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,580
It also killed the feeding Wraith,
and half the people who took it.

14
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:39,634
Let's not forget that Michael spread
the modified Hoffan drug

15
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:42,629
to dozens of worlds, possibly more.
No one knows for sure, right?

16
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:45,799
Which means that every time you feed,
you're taking a risk.

17
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:10,637
Once more.

18
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:19,922
Bad news, I'm afraid.

19
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:23,082
You'll have to go back
to school tomorrow.

20
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:27,798
Maintain the amoxicillin for 3 days.
That should do the trick.

21
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:30,200
Now, what do we have over here?

22
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:32,678
All these dressings
need to be changed.

23
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:34,995
Can you go to the storeroom
and get more bandages, please?

24
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:36,217
- Yes.
- Thank you.

25
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:37,874
You're looking good, my friend.

26
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:39,644
- Mail call.
- Colonel!

27
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:42,745
- What are you all doing here?
- We heard you needed supplies,

28
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:45,372
so we thought we'd come by
and see how you were doing.

29
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:48,181
A "Hop, skip, and a jump from the Gate"?
That's what you call that?

30
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:49,869
Nice to see you too, Rodney.

31
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:51,808
- How are you, Doctor?
- Well, thanks.

32
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:54,496
I take it these are
the antibiotics I ordered?

33
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:57,655
Dr. Keller gave you a whole whack,
so they should last for a while.

34
00:01:57,815 --> 00:01:59,515
God, I wish that were true.

35
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:00,871
What does that mean?

36
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,643
I've been dealing with infections

37
00:02:02,763 --> 00:02:05,497
from the Hoffan plague survivors.
I can barely keep on top of it.

38
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:07,213
Survivors of the Hoffan plague here?

39
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:09,942
This is not one of the planets
that Michael targeted.

40
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:12,551
No, but many of these people
come from another planet, Balar.

41
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:14,596
They managed to survive the plague,

42
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:17,147
and just when they're starting
to get their pieces back together,

43
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,804
the Wraith showed up,
tried to wipe them out.

44
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:21,436
We heard rumors about that.

45
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:24,981
They aren't pleased to have populations
that are immune to their feeding.

46
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,713
Just a handful
of the Balarans survived.

47
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,473
The locals were kind enough
to take them in.

48
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:32,292
- Doctor?
- Novo!

49
00:02:32,706 --> 00:02:36,332
These are my friends from Atlantis.
Colonel Sheppard, Teyla, Ronon,

50
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:38,055
and Dr. Rodney McKay.

51
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:40,997
This is Novo. She's been helping me
here in the clinic.

52
00:02:41,837 --> 00:02:42,749
Pleasure.

53
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:45,752
You as well.
I've heard a lot about you.

54
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:47,578
Is he the one?

55
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:49,964
The one what?

56
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:52,306
From all the funny stories.

57
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:54,218
Right!
Yeah, well, I hope you all

58
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,887
can stay here for dinner?
I mean, the canteen's not fancy,

59
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:59,203
but they do serve up
one heck of a stew,

60
00:02:59,323 --> 00:03:00,767
made from a goat-like creature.

61
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:02,769
- Delicious!
- Goat-like?

62
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:04,868
Great idea.
Gives us a chance to catch up

63
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:07,398
and relive all those...
"funny stories."

64
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:13,304
How's life in the wilds of Pegasus?

65
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:15,357
You got to be missing
Atlantis by now.

66
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:17,338
- Surprisingly, no.
- Come on.

67
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,824
The hot baths, playstation,

68
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:21,970
deodorant?

69
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:25,233
I know it seems a wee bit rough,
but it's not, really.

70
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,033
Wherever I go, people are kind to me.
I never want for a meal

71
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:31,368
or a place to sleep.
And to be honest with you,

72
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:34,519
I'm really starting to feel like
I'm making a difference.

73
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,080
What is it?

74
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:45,854
Wraith.

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,790
Season 5 Episode 12
Outsiders (v. 1.00)

76
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,807
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

77
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:01,452
www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

78
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:13,255
I count nine of 'em.

79
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,375
- We can take 'em.
- No. There's too many civilians.

80
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:18,710
It does not appear
to be an ordinary culling.

81
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,514
- How do you figure that?
- For one thing, there are no darts,

82
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:24,392
and they do not seem
to be attacking the villagers.

83
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:36,536
Who among you speaks for the rest?

84
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:41,177
I'm Elson...

85
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:44,219
leader of this village.

86
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:48,876
What do you want with us?

87
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,459
You've recently taken in

88
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,837
a group of refugees
from another planet.

89
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,924
They are survivors of a plague.

90
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:59,854
It's important that you turn them over
to me immediately.

91
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:01,923
Why?

92
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:04,015
The reasons why do not concern you.

93
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:06,016
Provided you cooperate,

94
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:09,861
you have my word
we will leave peacefully.

95
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,859
And if we don't?

96
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:23,316
That would be
a very unwise decision.

97
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:26,954
Our hive will be here
before the night is through.

98
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:29,499
If you have not complied by then,

99
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,407
I will give the word,

100
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:34,420
and your entire village
will be destroyed.

101
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:38,279
Turn over these outsiders,

102
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:40,884
and your lives will be spared.

103
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:42,577
Resist,

104
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:45,264
and you will all die together.

105
00:05:48,951 --> 00:05:50,770
The choice is yours.

106
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:04,701
I don't understand.

107
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:06,605
They've already destroyed
our homeworld.

108
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:09,370
Why would they hunt
the rest of us down as well?

109
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,148
You didn't tell them?

110
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:12,749
Not the whole story.

111
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,310
What are you talking about?

112
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,584
Novo, remember when I told you that,
as a plague survivor,

113
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:22,099
you'd be immune
to the Wraith feeding?

114
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:24,643
Well, there's a bit
more to it than that.

115
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:27,829
Any Wraith who tries to feed on you,
or anyone like you,

116
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:30,676
will, as a result, die instantly.

117
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:34,187
You're poison to them.

118
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,980
- Then we're as good as dead.
- Not necessarily.

119
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,079
They won't tolerate
our presence anywhere.

120
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,599
Not if what you say is true.

121
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,197
They found you on this world,

122
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,364
it does not mean
that there is nowhere you can hide.

123
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,331
- Did you hear?
- Yes.

124
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,541
This is Sefaris.
He's also from Balar.

125
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:58,046
The councilors are meeting to discuss
whether to heed the Wraith's request.

126
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:01,032
- What? Where?
- The mine office.

127
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:03,216
I tried to get in,
but they turned me away.

128
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,054
Ronon and Teyla, scope out the Gate.

129
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:08,687
You two stay here.
Watch these people.

130
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,712
Can you show me
where this mine office is?

131
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:11,576
Yes.

132
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,342
Colonel, what are you
gonna say to them?

133
00:07:14,462 --> 00:07:16,118
I'm gonna give them another way out.

134
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:21,317
You're telling us that,
as a result of this plague,

135
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:24,026
the Balarans are now deadly
to the Wraith?

136
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:25,730
Pretty much.

137
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:29,646
So the Wraith would never risk
culling this village?

138
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:33,055
That's true, but that's also
why they're willing

139
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:35,186
to wipe you guys out completely.

140
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:37,744
A village that can't be culled
is no good to them.

141
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:38,878
Did they know?

142
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:39,899
What?

143
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,142
Did the Balarans know they were bringing
this curse upon us when they came here?

144
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:46,027
- No. They had no idea.
- It's not their fault, Jervis.

145
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:48,598
Maybe not,
but that doesn't matter.

146
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:53,518
The Wraith won't rest until every last
plague survivor in this galaxy is dead.

147
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:55,644
Except the Wraith
have no idea who they are

148
00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:57,438
unless people like you
point them out.

149
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,025
I'm not happy
about this either, Colonel,

150
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:03,693
but what other choice do we have?

151
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:04,835
Well...

152
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:09,181
we may be able
to move all your people

153
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:12,347
to a different planet,
where they'll be safe.

154
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:15,090
- You mean leave our homes?
- Look, I know it's not ideal,

155
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,855
but the only other choice is
to turn in a bunch of innocent people,

156
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:20,965
and I know you guys
aren't gonna do that, right?

157
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:24,153
Well, as the Wraith said,
they're outsiders.

158
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:27,278
Jervis,
we agreed to let them come here.

159
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:28,719
I didn't agree.

160
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,004
Besides, they weren't a threat
at the time.

161
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:34,100
Now that's changed.

162
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,686
But they've become like family.

163
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:39,105
Novo lives under my roof.

164
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:42,073
She eats at my table.
My daughter adores her.

165
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,820
- What am I supposed to tell her?
- You'd prefer that we all be killed?

166
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:50,217
- <i>Colonel Sheppard, come in.</i>
- Excuse me.

167
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:52,577
Go ahead.

168
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,539
Ronon and I are at the Gate. It does
not appear to be heavily guarded.

169
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:58,874
It's the same guys from the village.

170
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,626
I recognize the commander.

171
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:03,464
What are the odds
of you two getting by 'em?

172
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,624
Pretty good.

173
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,133
Slim, actually,

174
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:08,509
but much better if you
and Rodney join us.

175
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:10,402
Yeah, all right.

176
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:12,975
Hold your position
till we can get there.

177
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:14,904
What is it?

178
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:19,103
- How many people are in this village?
- 600, 700.

179
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,898
Well, we'll be tight for time,
but we can manage.

180
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:24,316
- What are you suggesting?
- We take the Wraith out,

181
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:27,646
get everybody through the Gate
before the hive ship comes.

182
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,240
You should be safe in Atlantis
till we can relocate you.

183
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,119
Unacceptable.

184
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:37,663
The Balarans don't deserve this.

185
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:40,166
They did nothing
but survive a sickness.

186
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:42,929
It could just as easily
have happened to us.

187
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:46,505
If we turn these people over, we are
no better than the Wraith ourselves.

188
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:50,064
Look,
even if you cooperate with the Wraith,

189
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:52,294
there's no guarantee
they're gonna keep their word.

190
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:54,931
They may just kill all of you
for being an inconvenience.

191
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,459
All right.

192
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:01,963
What do you want us to do?

193
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,735
Be ready to move.
Take only what you can carry.

194
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,518
Let's go, Rodney.
We're gonna hit the Wraith.

195
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:16,070
- We are?
- I'll come with you.

196
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,765
Not a chance, Doc.
I don't have time to argue.

197
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,831
Get these people
ready for transport.

198
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:24,372
Once the Gate's secure,
we're gonna have to move fast.

199
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,990
Okay, but be careful.

200
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,784
If we're gonna attack,
we gotta do it from over there.

201
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:33,826
Agreed.

202
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:08,157
As soon as we take the Gate,
we should call in some Jumpers.

203
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:10,179
It'll make evacuating
the village a lot faster.

204
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:12,121
Not to mention
we can use the extra firepower

205
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,084
in case the hive gets here
before we're done.

206
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:15,965
Oh, let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

207
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:18,215
- <i>Colonel Sheppard, come in.</i>
- Go ahead.

208
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:19,362
We have a problem.

209
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,433
More of the Wraith have
begun arriving back.

210
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:23,613
They must have been out on patrol.

211
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,583
How many?
Can we still get out?

212
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:26,490
<i>No.</i>

213
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,150
For the time being,
we're stuck here.

214
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,790
You said you could get us out.

215
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,784
Well, there are more
Wraith than we thought.

216
00:11:39,122 --> 00:11:40,514
The Gate's too heavily guarded.

217
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,871
- So we're trapped?
- For the moment.

218
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:45,782
I haven't given up hope. I just
need time to develop a new strategy.

219
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:49,378
What strategy do you propose
we use to defeat an army of Wraith?

220
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,488
Well, I don't know.
I haven't thought of it yet.

221
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:54,717
Look,

222
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,338
worst-case scenario...
My team and I don't show up,

223
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,389
the people back on Atlantis
will dial the Gate

224
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:02,308
and contact us by radio.
I can order back-up.

225
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:04,643
Will that happen
before the hive ship arrives?

226
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:08,940
- Probably not.
- We can't wait that long.

227
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,359
For all we know, the Wraith
could be lying about the ship.

228
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:13,284
And why would they do that?

229
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:16,447
I'm just saying,
we need to stall as long as possible.

230
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,240
This is madness.

231
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,657
Elson, we have to think
of the safety of our people.

232
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:22,913
Oh, I'm thinking about
the safety of your people.

233
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,780
- All your people!
- We can't rely on their help.

234
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:27,972
We have to make our own decisions.

235
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,228
I need time to think about this.

236
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:32,434
The time for that has passed, Elson.

237
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,615
We have to act.

238
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:38,382
And if you're not prepared to do so,
then I will.

239
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:40,904
Jervis!

240
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,006
What's he gonna do?

241
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:47,709
I don't know.

242
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:54,485
- Where's Novo and the others?
- We sent them home. Why?

243
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:57,210
Can these people walk?

244
00:12:57,798 --> 00:13:00,664
Well, if need be, but I thought
we couldn't get them through the Gate.

245
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:04,745
No, we can't for the time being, but
I don't think they're safe here either.

246
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:11,967
Grab your weapons.

247
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,466
Come with me.

248
00:13:40,397 --> 00:13:41,657
Get out of my way.

249
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:43,367
She's not here, Jervis.

250
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,564
Where is she?

251
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,120
What are we gonna do, Novo?

252
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:08,035
We have to get out of the village.

253
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:23,574
What the hell's going on out there?

254
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,994
Some of the villagers decided
to take matters into their own hands.

255
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,649
- Let's go stop 'em.
- First things first.

256
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,441
We got to move these people.
Grab some gear.

257
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:40,174
We don't want any trouble.
Just hand over the Balarans.

258
00:14:41,418 --> 00:14:42,660
I don't think so.

259
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,553
Don't make things
difficult, Colonel.

260
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:46,759
You had your chance
to save the village.

261
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,141
Now it's my turn.

262
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:50,767
Saving the village?
That's what you call this?

263
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,103
This isn't your affair.

264
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,583
It's up to us to decide
how to deal with the situation.

265
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:57,983
Yes, it is,

266
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:01,529
but Jervis, this is not our way.

267
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:02,896
Our way?

268
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:07,125
Our way is what got us
into this situation in the first place!

269
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,913
We've already given them more
than they could have ever asked for.

270
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:14,457
All right, why not just shoot
them right now and get it over with?

271
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:17,761
It's a death sentence anyway.
Shoot them yourself,

272
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:20,315
and spare them the torment
of being tortured by the Wraith.

273
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,470
- You'd be doing them a favor.
- Carson.

274
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,719
Go on! Kill them all, then, if you're
that desperate to be done with them!

275
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:39,984
- You're making a big mistake.
- Maybe,

276
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:43,670
but at least we do so
with a clear conscience.

277
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,617
- Doesn't matter anyway.
- What are you talking about?

278
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:52,204
My men are already on the way to the
Gate with the first group we captured.

279
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,196
It's too late.

280
00:16:08,964 --> 00:16:10,625
What are they gonna do to us?

281
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:12,821
Be calm, Sefaris.
You're scaring the others.

282
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:14,759
Maybe they should be scared.

283
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,111
- We both know there's no escape.
- We cannot give up hope.

284
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,748
Face it, Novo...

285
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:22,476
we've been betrayed.

286
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:25,445
They don't want us here.
They never did.

287
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:28,466
We were doomed the moment
we had to leave our homes.

288
00:16:29,728 --> 00:16:30,971
And, to think...

289
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:35,001
as a survivor, I used to consider myself
one of the lucky ones.

290
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,230
- Is Jervis taken care of?
- He and his men are locked up.

291
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,181
They will not be giving us
any more trouble,

292
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:46,503
though I do not think
it was necessary to stun them.

293
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:47,718
Felt good, though.

294
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:49,195
So what now?

295
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:51,458
I gotta get the rest
of the Balarans out of the village.

296
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,002
There's no telling if anybody else
might feel the way Jervis does.

297
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:56,144
- Where should we take them?
- The forest?

298
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:57,768
It's kind of a long haul at night.

299
00:16:57,888 --> 00:17:00,627
Wait a minute. What about the mine?
These tracks lead right down to it.

300
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:02,258
I mean, we just follow them.

301
00:17:02,378 --> 00:17:04,379
- No one gets lost.
- Exactly.

302
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:05,450
All right.

303
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:07,401
Go get Beckett and his patients.

304
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:10,080
Bring them here.
We'll round up everyone else.

305
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:26,866
- What is it?
- Something's happening.

306
00:17:31,278 --> 00:17:32,262
What's going on?

307
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:36,631
You'll be moving shortly.

308
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:37,702
Where?

309
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:39,205
Your new home.

310
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:42,711
The hive ship has just arrived.

311
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:45,556
Wait.

312
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:50,940
- I have a proposition for you.
- What are you doing, Sefaris?

313
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,445
Something we should have done
a long time ago.

314
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:55,884
There is nothing
you have to offer me.

315
00:17:56,182 --> 00:17:57,192
Don't be so sure.

316
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,657
There's someone
hiding in the village.

317
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:02,189
He's of far greater value
than all of us put together.

318
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:06,246
- Sefaris, no...
- Spare our lives, I'll take you to him.

319
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:10,245
A fair attempt...

320
00:18:10,874 --> 00:18:12,428
But the answer's no.

321
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:13,998
My life, then.

322
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:16,513
How could you do this?

323
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:18,851
I promise,
it'll be worth your while.

324
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:26,506
I believe that is everybody.

325
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:28,275
Where's McKay and Beckett?

326
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:30,649
Rodney, what's your status?

327
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:32,725
Still at the clinic.

328
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,392
Carson decided to pick up
a few more supplies.

329
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,883
<i>Tell him to get a move on.
We can't stay here forever.</i>

330
00:18:38,003 --> 00:18:39,663
Go ahead, Colonel.
We'll catch up.

331
00:18:39,783 --> 00:18:42,762
- <i>You sure?</i>
- Absolutely. We'll be right behind you.

332
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:47,208
Let's get going.
Stay together. Follow the tracks.

333
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:58,091
There. That should do it.
Rodney, can you give me a hand here?

334
00:18:58,642 --> 00:19:01,337
Remind me to bring a sherpa
next time I visit.

335
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:08,392
Him.

336
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,462
He's the one.

337
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:17,075
You see?

338
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,478
I kept up my end of the bargain.

339
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:21,904
So you did.

340
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:25,840
Unfortunately, in light of your...

341
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:27,825
"condition"...

342
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:32,177
keeping you alive is far too risky.

343
00:19:58,468 --> 00:19:59,237
Darts.

344
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,483
- Rodney and Carson are still not here.
- Rodney, come in.

345
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:05,879
McKay?

346
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:09,321
You guys keep moving.
I'm gonna go get him.

347
00:20:30,872 --> 00:20:33,203
- <i>Ronon? Teyla?</i>
- Go ahead.

348
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:35,562
The Wraith just got
Beckett and McKay.

349
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:38,098
- What? How?
- Took 'em up in a dart.

350
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:41,059
I think they're on their way to a hive.

351
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:43,787
How did the Wraith know
that they were in the village?

352
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:47,165
I think I got an idea.

353
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,053
Rodney.
Rodney, wake up.

354
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:06,091
Oh... God, is it me,
or have they juiced up the stun weapons?

355
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:10,312
Oh, and they brought us to the hive.
That's great.

356
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:11,745
What are we gonna do?

357
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:14,685
Just don't... Don't panic.
Don't panic.

358
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:19,808
I have... got lots of experience
escaping from these things.

359
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:21,233
- You do?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

360
00:21:21,353 --> 00:21:23,891
I've been in this situation dozens
of times, always figured a way out.

361
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:25,996
- How, exactly?
- Let's see.

362
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,150
Last time, Teyla was posing
as a queen, so...

363
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:32,711
You know, she had us released.

364
00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:35,871
- Not much chance of that happening.
- No, I guess not.

365
00:21:35,991 --> 00:21:38,568
- How about the time before that?
- Ronon's friend Tyre was pretending

366
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,920
to be in league with the Wraith,
but really he was on our side, so...

367
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,222
- he let us out.
- I'm starting to sense a pattern here.

368
00:21:44,618 --> 00:21:48,191
You've actually never really escaped
from one of these cells on your own?

369
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:50,312
- First time for everything, right?
- God, Rodney.

370
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:53,191
Well, just... give me a minute.
I'll think of something.

371
00:21:54,686 --> 00:21:58,198
I hate to pressure you, Rodney,
but I don't think we have a minute.

372
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:05,802
Bring them.

373
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,054
What is this place?

374
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:17,632
A lab belonging to my top scientist.

375
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,254
For the last six months he has been
studying the deadly toxin

376
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,948
that has infiltrated
our food supply.

377
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:27,627
Where is he now?

378
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:30,195
Dead.

379
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:36,102
He was convinced he had arrived
at a foolproof way to detect the poison.

380
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:40,737
To prove it, he decided
to feed on one of his test subjects.

381
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,320
Guess that didn't work out so well?

382
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:46,096
He died in excruciating pain.

383
00:22:47,806 --> 00:22:51,957
Needless to say, his research
has been stalled ever since.

384
00:22:53,578 --> 00:22:56,086
And that's where you come in,
Doctor.

385
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,735
Me?

386
00:22:59,368 --> 00:23:02,120
- What do you expect me to do?
- The one who identified you said

387
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,345
you had considerable expertise
in dealing with the toxin.

388
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,220
He even said you had
a hand in developing it.

389
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,759
If anyone can find
a way to detect it, you can.

390
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,981
If you think I'm gonna help you,
you're sorely mistaken.

391
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,693
I anticipated you might say that,

392
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:23,238
which is why I'm prepared
to offer you an incentive.

393
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:25,108
Thus far,

394
00:23:25,498 --> 00:23:28,758
I have spared the lives of the people
on the planet below.

395
00:23:29,255 --> 00:23:31,977
If you cooperate,
I will continue to do so.

396
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:35,558
But if either of you
try to cross me in any way...

397
00:23:35,827 --> 00:23:37,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
we get the picture.

398
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,172
I knew you'd come to see it my way.

399
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:48,117
Get to work.

400
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,059
Give me one reason
not to blow your head off.

401
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:05,179
What for?

402
00:24:05,741 --> 00:24:08,058
How did the Wraith know
to grab Beckett?

403
00:24:08,178 --> 00:24:09,910
What do you mean?
Doctor's been captured?

404
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:14,093
I swear, I had nothing
to do with that.

405
00:24:16,182 --> 00:24:18,740
- What about your men?
- No. No, there's no way.

406
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,669
The Doctor has been
nothing but good to us.

407
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:22,553
They didn't just
stumble across the clinic.

408
00:24:22,673 --> 00:24:25,111
Somebody brought them there.

409
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:30,212
Well, why don't you
ask the Balarans?

410
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:33,197
They're the ones
with the most to gain.

411
00:24:34,036 --> 00:24:37,354
One of them probably thought he could
save himself by turning in the Doctor.

412
00:24:42,987 --> 00:24:45,458
I told you they were
no good, Colonel.

413
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:55,719
Damn it.

414
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:58,433
None of these consoles
are hooked into anything.

415
00:24:58,553 --> 00:25:00,603
I can't access
any of the ship's systems.

416
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,913
What about you?

417
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:03,839
You making any progress?

418
00:25:04,242 --> 00:25:05,178
Carson?

419
00:25:07,682 --> 00:25:08,682
You okay?

420
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,158
I can't do this, Rodney.

421
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:15,007
- What? You don't understand it?
- No. I mean, I can't do it.

422
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:18,645
Do you realize what'll happen if
the Wraith can detect the Hoffan drug?

423
00:25:19,306 --> 00:25:21,731
They'll hunt down every last person
in this galaxy that has it.

424
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:24,868
That's hundreds of thousands
of people, Rodney.

425
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:27,077
Not to mention the fact
that, when they're finished,

426
00:25:27,197 --> 00:25:29,621
they can start feeding again,
indiscriminately.

427
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:31,116
What's the alternative, huh?

428
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:33,259
We know the Wraith aren't
gonna let the matter drop.

429
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:34,707
We've seen what they can do.

430
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:37,998
They'll wipe out entire villages
just to get a few like the Balarans.

431
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:40,687
- So what am I supposed to do?
- You just stall.

432
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:43,204
You know, you make it look
like you're working, and...

433
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:45,088
Till we figure out
how to get out of here.

434
00:25:45,248 --> 00:25:47,465
Then? Go about our business?
Pretend this never happened?

435
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:49,104
I never said
it was gonna be easy.

436
00:25:49,224 --> 00:25:51,678
But you can't solve all
the galaxy's problems in one day.

437
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:55,713
Look, I understand. You feel guilty.
But this is not your fault.

438
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:58,638
You had no idea
that any of this was gonna happen.

439
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:02,405
One of the first things
they taught us in medical school

440
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:03,899
was "Do no harm."

441
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:08,987
I'm at a loss right now to figure out
how that's possible in this situation.

442
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,105
How are they doing?

443
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:22,808
They are frightened.

444
00:26:22,928 --> 00:26:26,097
I've been trying to reassure them,
but it is of little use.

445
00:26:27,348 --> 00:26:30,055
- How's it going in here?
- We are getting by.

446
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:33,598
- What is happening in the village?
- Not much. Everybody's hiding indoors.

447
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,565
Why hasn't the hive ship
attacked yet?

448
00:26:35,685 --> 00:26:38,391
Do you think it could have something
to do with Rodney and Carson's capture?

449
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:41,561
I don't know, but we should use
this time to come up with a plan.

450
00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:43,396
- You got anything?
- Maybe,

451
00:26:44,614 --> 00:26:46,641
but it's gonna take some work.

452
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:55,464
What is it?
You got something?

453
00:26:55,992 --> 00:26:56,992
No.

454
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,579
You sure?
You got one of those "Beckett" faces.

455
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,372
Aye, I'm sure, Rodney.
Just go back to work.

456
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:04,374
- Where you going?
- Talk to the commander.

457
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:06,753
- What? Why?
- There's something I need to tell him.

458
00:27:06,913 --> 00:27:08,810
Oh, I knew it.
You found something. What is it?

459
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,618
- Open up!
- Seriously, tell me.

460
00:27:10,738 --> 00:27:12,548
You know I'm gonna go
through your stuff.

461
00:27:12,668 --> 00:27:14,687
Just leave me be, Rodney.
Open the door!

462
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:17,186
Will you just tell me
what's going on?

463
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:19,223
I need to talk
to the commander right away.

464
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:21,492
Listen to me, Rodney.
I need you to stay here.

465
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:23,558
Don't worry.
Everything will be just fine.

466
00:27:23,678 --> 00:27:24,553
Right.

467
00:27:42,117 --> 00:27:43,117
Doctor.

468
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,667
I didn't expect
to hear from you so soon.

469
00:27:46,992 --> 00:27:49,837
- This must be good news.
- For some people, maybe.

470
00:27:50,617 --> 00:27:53,207
I'm here to tell you
that I'm off the case.

471
00:27:54,836 --> 00:27:56,120
What are you talking about?

472
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,113
I'm not gonna do
your dirty work for you.

473
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:00,348
- Find someone else.
- There is no one else!

474
00:28:00,508 --> 00:28:02,358
Then that's too bad for you,
isn't it?

475
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:04,769
You're trying my patience, Doctor.

476
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:08,365
You forget,
I control the fate of the people below.

477
00:28:08,535 --> 00:28:10,275
People will die no matter what I do,

478
00:28:10,995 --> 00:28:12,444
so I'm not gonna do anything.

479
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:18,700
If you refuse
to complete the research,

480
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:23,121
then there is only one other way
that you could be of use to me.

481
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:25,665
And, trust me,

482
00:28:26,536 --> 00:28:27,948
you won't like it.

483
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:30,086
You don't scare me anymore.

484
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,021
Do you understand?

485
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:34,549
I don't give a damn
what you do to me.

486
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:36,640
Suit yourself.

487
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:39,715
I'm going to enjoy this...

488
00:28:40,098 --> 00:28:41,150
Very much.

489
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:58,948
What is this?

490
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:04,577
What have you done to me?

491
00:29:04,697 --> 00:29:08,553
Turns out you were closer to detecting
the Hoffan drug than you thought.

492
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,081
It didn't take me long
to perfect your blood test.

493
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,281
And once I confirmed it
using samples that you provided,

494
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:17,967
I decided to do one more test,
just to be certain...

495
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:20,845
On me.

496
00:29:22,116 --> 00:29:23,646
You have the toxin?

497
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,155
Indeed.

498
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,337
And now... so do you.

499
00:29:50,077 --> 00:29:51,952
Hello, Rodney.
Can you delete this data?

500
00:29:52,072 --> 00:29:54,731
- Of course, but how did you...
- I talked the commander to feed on me.

501
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:58,049
- What? What? Why would you do that?
- I have the Hoffan drug, Rodney.

502
00:29:58,524 --> 00:30:00,602
Michael must have given it to me
as a defense.

503
00:30:00,722 --> 00:30:03,002
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You would have stopped me.

504
00:30:03,122 --> 00:30:04,848
It's stupid!
What if you were wrong?

505
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:07,609
I had to do something.
It's the only chance we had to get away.

506
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:10,968
Will you help me destroy this research
before they find out what I've done?

507
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:13,022
- Right.
- Okay, great.

508
00:30:18,113 --> 00:30:19,616
The coast is clear.

509
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:24,005
- What are we doing, exactly?
- What do you think?

510
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,891
We're looking
for a way off this ship.

511
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:28,467
By wandering aimlessly
through the hallways?

512
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:30,993
I'm not wandering aimlessly.
I'm exploring.

513
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:32,931
There's a big difference.

514
00:30:37,277 --> 00:30:38,277
Bingo!

515
00:30:47,837 --> 00:30:50,628
- What are you doing, Rodney?
- Hacking the ship's communications.

516
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,458
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- Look, if we don't get Sheppard,

517
00:30:53,578 --> 00:30:56,436
we don't stand any chance
of getting off this ship.

518
00:30:57,078 --> 00:31:00,403
- You're gonna have to cover me.
- All right. From which direction?

519
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,951
What was that?

520
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,618
- <i>Sheppard, do you read me?</i>
- McKay, is that you?

521
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:10,538
Thank God! We are on the hive ship.
I've got Beckett with me.

522
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:14,000
- What the hell is going on up there?
- <i>We managed to escape.</i>

523
00:31:15,903 --> 00:31:17,545
- Beckett helped.
- <i>That's great,</i>

524
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:19,839
- 'cause we could really use the help.
- <i>You?</i>

525
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:22,015
Look,
we're the ones stuck on the ship!

526
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:24,839
That's exactly where you need to be,
because we need someone

527
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:27,747
- to take out the hive's main weapons.
- What?

528
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:31,392
We got a plan, but it's only gonna work
if we take the hive out of the picture.

529
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:33,801
It is bad enough
I hacked into communications!

530
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:37,190
If I start messing around,
they'll track us down!

531
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:40,193
Rodney, it's the only way
to get these people to safety.

532
00:31:40,591 --> 00:31:43,196
Once that's done, we'll figure out a way
to get you guys out of there.

533
00:31:47,704 --> 00:31:48,783
All right.

534
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:51,746
I'll see what I can do.
Give me a few minutes. Should be enough.

535
00:31:52,474 --> 00:31:54,165
You're a good man, Rodney.

536
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:57,506
- Just don't forget about us, okay?
- We won't. Good luck.

537
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:00,426
- Think he'll be able to pull it off?
- Well, he'd better.

538
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:03,252
Otherwise this thing's gonna go
very badly.

539
00:32:30,012 --> 00:32:31,154
Jervis.

540
00:32:33,715 --> 00:32:36,179
- What do you want?
- We need to talk.

541
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,084
I have nothing to say to you.

542
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:40,712
You were right all along.

543
00:32:41,095 --> 00:32:43,077
I should have listened to you.

544
00:32:44,283 --> 00:32:47,137
The Atlantians have no idea
what they're doing.

545
00:32:47,469 --> 00:32:49,619
They claim to have a plan,
but, in reality,

546
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:52,467
they're just putting
all our lives at risk.

547
00:32:53,155 --> 00:32:54,155
Well...

548
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,940
It's a little late now, isn't it?

549
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:04,031
Is it?

550
00:33:04,534 --> 00:33:06,738
If you went to the Wraith
at the Gate right now,

551
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:10,946
do you think you could get them
to honor the original deal?

552
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:12,490
It's possible.

553
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:14,471
But...

554
00:33:15,018 --> 00:33:18,041
I'd have to deliver
all of the remaining outsiders at once.

555
00:33:21,024 --> 00:33:22,211
They're in the mine,

556
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:25,002
hiding in the main chamber.

557
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,717
Are the other councilors
on board with this?

558
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:30,332
The less they know about it,
the better.

559
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,164
And you?

560
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,476
Can you reconcile this
with your conscience?

561
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:40,939
Leave that to me.

562
00:33:42,183 --> 00:33:43,608
You just make that deal.

563
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,346
What is it?

564
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:16,349
Search the ship.

565
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:22,379
- How long is this gonna take?
- Do I rush you while you're on surgery?

566
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:24,620
Aye, it's been known to happen.

567
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:26,571
All right, I'm in.

568
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:29,320
Now, I just need a few minutes
to disable the...

569
00:34:30,022 --> 00:34:30,822
Geez!

570
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:34,464
- I think they found us!
- You figure?

571
00:34:34,902 --> 00:34:36,872
Okay, you're gonna have
to hold them off.

572
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,805
- Am I, now?
- Come on. You can do this, all right?

573
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:41,541
All right. On three?

574
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:44,066
- How about on one?
- All right. Right.

575
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:45,689
And, one!

576
00:34:49,843 --> 00:34:51,300
How's it coming?

577
00:34:51,975 --> 00:34:53,219
Almost there.

578
00:34:58,904 --> 00:35:01,323
I can't hold them off forever,
Rodney!

579
00:35:02,656 --> 00:35:04,269
We have to go!
Now!

580
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:06,607
All right, that's it!
I got it! Let's go!

581
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,244
- Where we going?
- Dart bay.

582
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:15,615
- You know how to fly a dart?
- I've flown Jumpers before.

583
00:35:15,735 --> 00:35:17,904
I've been to Tokyo.
Doesn't mean I can speak Japanese.

584
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:19,746
Well, how hard can it be?

585
00:35:22,098 --> 00:35:25,204
- Do you even know where you're going?
- I pulled up a schematic of the ship.

586
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,253
What?
While we were being fired upon?

587
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,883
That's sealed.

588
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:38,712
- How long do you think it'll hold them?
- Not very.

589
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,722
Well, come on.

590
00:35:53,382 --> 00:35:55,091
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting in.

591
00:35:55,211 --> 00:35:56,611
We can't both fit in here.

592
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,978
You're damn right I can.
Now shove over!

593
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:01,842
You comfy?

594
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:03,414
Peachy.

595
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:06,588
What are you waiting for?

596
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,364
- It should just start up.
- It didn't.

597
00:36:08,484 --> 00:36:11,088
I know, but it doesn't make sense.
A canopy should form over our head.

598
00:36:11,515 --> 00:36:14,359
- Might be some kind of a weight limit.
- What's that supposed to mean?

599
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:16,613
I mean because there's two of us!

600
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:19,956
- Maybe you need a key, or something?
- It's not a Volkswagen, Carson!

601
00:36:20,174 --> 00:36:21,076
Okay, look,

602
00:36:21,196 --> 00:36:23,851
these are obviously the flight controls.
That makes that propulsion, so...

603
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:27,430
- Where'd you come up with that?
- It's just common sense!

604
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,042
- Come on!
- Right, common sense.

605
00:36:30,162 --> 00:36:32,929
What do you want from me?
It's not like there's labels!

606
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:36,162
- Oh, not good!
- You're telling me.

607
00:36:36,282 --> 00:36:38,102
- We need a new plan.
- I know! I'm thinking!

608
00:36:38,222 --> 00:36:40,871
Whatever you do, think fast,
because if they come through that door,

609
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,531
we're both dead.

610
00:36:48,347 --> 00:36:50,846
- Rodney, we need to go.
- Where? I mean, we're trapped in here!

611
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:53,554
Then we need to find a place to hide.
Come on.

612
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,810
- What?
- I have another idea.

613
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,173
It's a long shot,
but it might work.

614
00:36:58,293 --> 00:37:00,566
But you're gonna have
to get off me!

615
00:37:16,038 --> 00:37:18,784
Once you've taken these people,
you're gonna leave the village, right?

616
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:19,904
For good?

617
00:37:20,152 --> 00:37:22,412
This place is of
no concern to us.

618
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,310
All we want is the Balarans.

619
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:27,391
There's a large chamber up ahead.
That's where they're hiding.

620
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:35,065
Where are they?

621
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:37,320
I don't understand.

622
00:37:38,003 --> 00:37:39,684
He said they were here!

623
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,763
They should be right here!

624
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:02,532
What is this?

625
00:38:12,528 --> 00:38:14,400
Think we killed enough
to make a difference?

626
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,136
Guess we'll find out.

627
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:22,784
Nice work.

628
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:38,757
We've received word of an explosion
that's killed several of our warriors.

629
00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:41,208
The humans continue
to attack our troops.

630
00:38:41,663 --> 00:38:43,644
They're trying to escape.

631
00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:46,295
Target the area around the portal
and open fire.

632
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:49,370
Weapons aren't responding!

633
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,849
What?

634
00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:06,441
Dial the Gate.

635
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:11,477
This is the first group.
There are more are coming.

636
00:39:11,597 --> 00:39:14,088
We've got to move fast.
They won't take this lying down. Go.

637
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:17,483
All right. Come on, let's go.
Stay level, stay low.

638
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:29,151
We've lost contact
with the troops at the Gate.

639
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:31,554
What about the two human prisoners?

640
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:33,877
They're nowhere to be seen.

641
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:36,624
They couldn't have just disappeared.

642
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:38,716
It doesn't matter.

643
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:41,381
We can't let the villagers escape.

644
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:43,663
Launch the darts.

645
00:39:52,752 --> 00:39:54,394
Go, go, go, move!

646
00:40:03,477 --> 00:40:04,530
Crap!

647
00:40:12,383 --> 00:40:13,622
We've got more coming!

648
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,323
Go, go, go!
You're almost there.

649
00:40:28,766 --> 00:40:30,681
- My God, it worked!
- Rodney, you're a genius!

650
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:34,608
- What'd you do?
- I reprogrammed the culling beam.

651
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:38,272
Once the Wraith lost their main weapons,
they were gonna launch the darts.

652
00:40:44,686 --> 00:40:45,856
Let's go!

653
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,889
There you are!
I've been calling you.

654
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,150
I'm sorry. What's up?

655
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,345
Lorne found a suitable planet
for the villagers.

656
00:41:02,465 --> 00:41:05,049
- They're gonna move them out.
- Aye, I heard. I'm going with them.

657
00:41:06,387 --> 00:41:07,733
Right. Of course.

658
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:10,721
Well, you want to... grab some lunch?
We didn't get any chance to socialize,

659
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:14,100
unless you count, you know,
running through the halls of the hive

660
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,923
- as social time.
- Aye, you're right.

661
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:18,966
Look, Rodney, I'd love to,
but I really need to get through this.

662
00:41:19,086 --> 00:41:20,059
What is it?

663
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:23,458
Dr. Keller's research on the serum
that keeps my cells from deteriorating.

664
00:41:23,578 --> 00:41:26,341
I think there might be something in here
to help the plague survivors,

665
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:28,515
since I'm not getting
the infections that they are.

666
00:41:28,635 --> 00:41:31,045
You don't have to do this now.
I'll download the data to a drive.

667
00:41:31,165 --> 00:41:33,038
You can just, you know,
take it with you.

668
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,487
Actually, you can't.

669
00:41:34,607 --> 00:41:37,426
Mr. Woolsey doesn't want
it leaving the base.

670
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:40,270
- I'm sorry, Rodney.
- Well, I don't care.

671
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,113
I was just trying to stop you
from whining about never seeing me.

672
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:44,233
All right.

673
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,336
Rodney, wait.

674
00:41:47,787 --> 00:41:50,010
Now that I think of it,
I am a wee bit peckish.

675
00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:53,848
Besides, I can't solve all
the galaxy's problems in one day, can I?

676
00:41:55,017 --> 00:41:56,670
- Well, I...
- Shut it.

677
00:41:56,957 --> 00:41:58,256
Right, let's go.

678
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:01,263
So?

679
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,326
Interested in anyone these days?

680
00:42:03,446 --> 00:42:06,115
Me?
No, I don't have time for that.

681
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:09,299
You're a terrible liar, Dr. McKay.
Tell me, tell me, tell me.
