1
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,043
Detective Sheppard?

2
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:44,351
Come on, John.
I'm breaking this with or without you.

3
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:47,630
- What's she doing here?
- Is this victim related to the others?

4
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,008
If we have a serial killer on our hands,
people have the right to know.

5
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,735
Victim was most likely a white male.

6
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,495
"Most likely?"

7
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:02,709
No clothes, no ID.
Wasn't killed here.

8
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:07,983
Got tire tracks
leading from the road.

9
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,570
Based on size, and spread,
it's probably an older-model pick-up.

10
00:01:16,113 --> 00:01:18,994
We've got radiator fluid down here.
Looks like the vehicle has a leak.

11
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:34,843
Pretty much as the other.

12
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:37,137
- Same chest wound?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,978
I thought I'd seen everything.

14
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:53,423
Yeah. Me too.

15
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:56,470
One day, we'll learn.

Thomas Crane.

20
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,338
Reported missing three days ago.
39 years old.

21
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:43,687
- You think this guy was 39?
- Check the dental records.

22
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:45,956
- It wasn't natural causes.
- Nope.

23
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,876
It looks like some sort
of rapid cellular breakdown.

24
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:51,398
The other victims...

25
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:53,087
had the same chest wound,

26
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:55,090
the same bizarre aging.

27
00:02:58,317 --> 00:02:59,825
I read the other autopsies.

28
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,221
The cause was undetermined.
All I know is

29
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:04,643
we're not dealing with a contagion.

30
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,351
No chemical residue?

31
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:10,108
Detective,
you'll get a copy of my report.

32
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:14,057
The previous victims all had
radioactive residue

33
00:03:14,182 --> 00:03:15,709
around their wounds.

34
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:17,821
When I'm done.

35
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:22,077
What'd you say your name was again?

36
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:28,874
I've got eight bodies
in three months,

37
00:03:29,553 --> 00:03:32,379
and I don't like it
when the lead coroner on my case

38
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,756
gets replaced by somebody who doesn't
look old enough to be in medical school.

39
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:39,384
Maybe someone feels a need
for some fresh eyes on the case.

40
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,887
They should have just replaced me.

41
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:44,995
Do you have any leads?

42
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,368
Got a bunch of bodies being dumped
in the desert and it looks like...

43
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:52,460
- the life's been sucked out of them.
- You really think that's possible?

44
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,142
I don't know where you're from,
but out here, anything's possible.

45
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:05,494
Anyone treated with symptoms related

46
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,246
to radiation poisoning,
go back a month.

47
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:12,640
No, it's not gonna come back to you,
I promise.

48
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:39,311
I don't know.

49
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:42,924
I told you,
they said it was a virus or something.

50
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,866
Probably food poisoning.

51
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:47,911
You should see the place
they've got me at.

52
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:50,036
Not exactly Bellagio.

53
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:54,057
Whole trip's been
a useless waste of time, too.

54
00:04:57,217 --> 00:05:00,799
My nose is bleeding again!
I better go.

55
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:03,723
Yeah, I will.
Love you too.

56
00:05:18,754 --> 00:05:20,480
Turn it down, will you?

57
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,101
Son of a bitch.

58
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:11,619
- Sheppard, this is Agent Woolsey, FBI.
- Nice to meet you.

59
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:15,707
- What the hell happened to your eye?
- This case move jurisdiction?

60
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:17,828
Not yet.

61
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,860
I'm not at liberty to discuss
our interest at this time,

62
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:22,672
but I'd appreciate your cooperation.

63
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:28,052
- Well... I got nothing.
- I'm surprised at that, detective.

64
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,890
The victims are turning up faster.
This is obviously a progression.

65
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:36,102
The first few bodies were buried.
We only found them because coyotes

66
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,140
dragged one onto the 564.

67
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:40,818
Now they're just being dumped out
in the open for the vultures.

68
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,109
So is that more careless,
or more bold?

69
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:46,624
Tell me why the coroner's report
on the latest victim

70
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:49,992
shows no signs of radioactive...
what do you call it?

71
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:51,201
Isotopes.

72
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:54,287
I assume because
there weren't any found.

73
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,301
Well...

74
00:06:58,188 --> 00:07:00,209
There were on the first seven.

75
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:04,537
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go see a nurse.

76
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:10,401
This guy was seen yesterday.

77
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,026
- Where is he?
- He's an out-of-towner at a motel.

78
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:17,251
- The chart should say.
- And you just let him go?

79
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:18,729
He was seen by a doctor.

80
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:20,891
We get people
with flu-like symptoms all the time.

81
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:23,463
All right, well,
what made it stand out?

82
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:25,631
He was also having nosebleeds.

83
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:28,293
It could have been unrelated.
Also common because of the dry air,

84
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:30,734
but then you mentioned
radiation poisoning...

85
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:32,784
- Thanks.
- Hey, look.

86
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,869
If he really was exposed,
it could be serious.

87
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:36,851
I'll track him down.

88
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:40,291
You want me to take a look
at that eye, John?

89
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:42,643
No, I'm... I'm fine.

90
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:49,023
- Are you gonna call me?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

91
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:02,230
Do you know that guy?

92
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:08,152
He checked out yesterday.
That a medical report?

93
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:13,950
If he had something, I gotta know.
Have that room cleaned up properly.

94
00:08:14,386 --> 00:08:16,074
Wash the sheets, you know?

95
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,414
Wash those sheets. In the meantime,
let me look at your register.

96
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:47,879
They were fighting.
She tried to break it up.

97
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:50,008
You know, it was an accident.

98
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:54,235
- You couldn't find the finger?
- We were up all night looking for it.

99
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:57,173
Yeah, but you found it?

100
00:10:57,505 --> 00:10:59,995
Out on the lawn,
when the sun came up.

101
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:01,575
I got it in the fridge.

102
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:05,495
- And where's the housekeeper?
- At the hospital.

103
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,623
- She lost a ton of blood.
- Really?

104
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:11,673
- Don't they need the finger?
- No, it's too late to reattach it.

105
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:13,293
She'll be all right.

106
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,970
- Which finger was it?
- Pinky.

107
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:29,284
- And you still got it?
- What are you supposed to do with it?

108
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:31,563
Besides, I thought maybe
she'd still want it. You know?

109
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,389
- And what about the dogs?
- Well, what about 'em?

110
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:42,114
- You're gonna get rid of them, no?
- What do you mean? I love those dogs.

111
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:44,733
I know.
I'll see 'em.

112
00:11:53,832 --> 00:11:56,004
Nice hand.
Got me again.

113
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:58,465
Almost like you can read minds.

114
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:00,392
Only yours.

115
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:02,261
Look at this guy.

116
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:04,459
He won't even look at me!

117
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:07,839
You've been taking my money all night,
you won't even look at me?

118
00:12:07,964 --> 00:12:10,085
Leave it alone.
He's a freakin' wacko.

119
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,362
Aren't you a little out
of your league here?

120
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,862
What are you, my mother?

121
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,658
Go ahead. I'll ante.

122
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,757
22,000 to call.

123
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:16,311
He doesn't have it.

124
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:18,486
Shut up.

125
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:29,574
He didn't have it!
No way.

126
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,461
Wait, where are you going?

127
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:35,372
You can't leave now!
Look at this guy.

128
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:10,825
Aw, geez.

129
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,199
You don't think
that's contagious, do you?

130
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:21,574
You said the guy next door
checked out yesterday?

131
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:22,922
I never saw him.

132
00:17:23,355 --> 00:17:24,680
He used the tv.

133
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:27,874
Don't touch anything.

134
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:30,003
Sure.

135
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:52,542
What is it?

136
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:55,112
It's a crime scene.
Get lost.

137
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,556
Detective.

138
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:29,957
We got another body here.
I was just about to call it in.

139
00:18:30,082 --> 00:18:31,899
I heard about
what happened at the casino.

140
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:33,681
You following me?

141
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:35,653
There's a satellite locator
on your car.

142
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:39,576
If you don't mind, we'd like you
to come for a little drive.

143
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,242
Do I have a choice?

144
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:44,871
Right.

145
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:15,484
- He won't sign it.
- Well, we should tell him anyway.

146
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:17,081
We can't trust him.

147
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,779
He might be able to help us.

148
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:22,074
Let me at least try.

149
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:32,208
Detective.

150
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:34,534
I'm Dr. Rodney McKay.

151
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:39,216
I realize you have
no way of grasping what's going on here.

152
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:42,219
There's really only one thing
you need to understand...

153
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:45,097
If you fail to co-operate,

154
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:47,940
I have the power to ruin your life.

155
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:50,311
Well, then you don't realize
how little I have to lose.

156
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:53,606
I know everything about you.

157
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,630
You've never been married.

158
00:19:56,755 --> 00:19:58,444
The only thing you own is a car.

159
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:02,828
You have $2,363 in the bank
and are $13,000 in debt,

160
00:20:03,197 --> 00:20:05,355
not counting
off-the-books gambling losses

161
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,286
to a guy named Mikey.

162
00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:09,997
What else?

163
00:20:10,348 --> 00:20:12,074
You finally passed
your detective exam

164
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:15,210
after four years
and two failed attempts,

165
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:18,756
and now barely scrape by
on quarterly performance reviews.

166
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:20,561
Am I getting this right?

167
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:23,078
I also like spearmint gum.

168
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:26,639
Have some.

169
00:20:27,052 --> 00:20:29,429
- I was joking.
- No, you weren't.

170
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:33,456
Let's go back further, shall we?

171
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:36,649
You were a helicopter
pilot in Afghanistan,

172
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:39,255
but were dishonorably discharged
for disobeying orders

173
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,321
and trying to rescue a field medic
trapped behind enemy lines.

174
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,400
You were shot down,
obviously survived,

175
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:46,075
but, unfortunately, the crash killed

176
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,828
four american soldiers
along with eight civilians.

177
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,108
You avoided jail time.

178
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:55,042
The record was sealed
for various political reasons.

179
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:56,919
These things happen, right?

180
00:20:57,642 --> 00:21:00,972
Somehow you've managed
to live with yourself since then...

181
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,055
But I'm not sure other people would
if they knew the truth.

182
00:21:08,242 --> 00:21:09,758
I don't really care.

183
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:12,437
Yeah.

184
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:15,075
That's too bad.

185
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:25,818
You know...

186
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:28,408
I once met another version of you.

187
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,287
He was very different.

188
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:35,499
- What?
- Nothing...

189
00:21:36,313 --> 00:21:37,627
is what you think it is.

190
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:40,092
That really doesn't come
as a surprise to me.

191
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:42,129
Look...

192
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,543
We're not bad guys.

193
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:50,055
We just wanna keep the planet safe.

194
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:52,893
I doubt that very much.

195
00:21:55,143 --> 00:21:57,104
I don't expect
you'll believe me at first.

196
00:21:57,933 --> 00:22:00,107
I'm about to tell you
some incredible things.

197
00:22:00,412 --> 00:22:03,026
Wormhole travel
through a device called a Stargate,

198
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:06,195
ancient races of humans
on other planets,

199
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,309
other dimensions in space and time,

200
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:13,516
even infinite variations
of our known reality,

201
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:17,374
where alternate versions of you and I
play out events in ways you can't...

202
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,196
possibly imagine.

203
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,360
Space aliens?

204
00:23:15,912 --> 00:23:18,397
It was found under a mile
of ice in Antarctica

205
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,132
five years ago
and later moved here.

206
00:23:21,874 --> 00:23:23,216
It runs on a power source

207
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:26,108
that extracts energy
from vacuum space.

208
00:23:26,277 --> 00:23:27,798
We call it a Zed-PM.

209
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:29,624
Well, a Zee-PM.

210
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:31,274
Sorry. I'm Canadian.

211
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:33,413
With the right genetic code,
you can control

212
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:37,050
some pretty cool weaponry,
remotely, with your mind.

213
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:39,247
It's how we were able to defeat
the Wraith hive ship

214
00:23:39,415 --> 00:23:41,458
that attacked Earth
three months ago.

215
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:43,293
Are there more?

216
00:23:43,826 --> 00:23:45,921
- What, chairs?
- No, aliens.

217
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:47,989
Oh, yeah. Lots more.

218
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:51,197
Fortunately,
they're in another galaxy...

219
00:23:51,322 --> 00:23:52,427
And, for now,

220
00:23:53,078 --> 00:23:54,696
they don't know where Earth is.

221
00:23:58,853 --> 00:23:59,662
Detective?

222
00:24:03,932 --> 00:24:05,315
They're called "Darts".

223
00:24:05,682 --> 00:24:08,317
Small, fast,
single-pilot attack ships.

224
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:10,698
Luckily we took out the Hive
quickly.

225
00:24:10,823 --> 00:24:13,031
Each one can carry
hundreds of these things.

226
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:16,166
And the guy dumping bodies
in the desert...

227
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,494
He's an alien.

228
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:19,073
A Wraith.

229
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:21,029
A genetic hybrid
between human beings

230
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:22,999
and something called an Iratus bug.

231
00:24:23,935 --> 00:24:25,585
Feeds on human energy,

232
00:24:25,895 --> 00:24:27,775
literally saps the life
out of people

233
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,548
using their sucker on their hands.

234
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:35,487
I suppose it all sounds
like science fiction to you.

235
00:24:36,632 --> 00:24:38,239
I'm not really a fan.

236
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:42,694
My team and I usually operate
out of Atlantis, in the Pegasus galaxy,

237
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:45,169
but we were called back to Earth
to deal with this situation

238
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:47,350
because of our expertise
with the Wraith.

239
00:24:47,475 --> 00:24:49,768
Now, the one that you've encountered
has obviously been doing

240
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:51,634
a fairly good job of blending in.

241
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,548
- What, disguising himself as human?
- Based on your description

242
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:57,029
and the video surveillance
from the casino.

243
00:24:58,361 --> 00:25:00,540
What do they normally look like?

244
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,621
Normally...
they look like that.

245
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:24,930
- Why do they do it?
- Feed on humans?

246
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:26,612
Well, that's just what they are.

247
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:28,427
We're just cattle to them.

248
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:29,571
Fish in a pond!

249
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,051
Busy, busy, lots to do,
here and there...

250
00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:34,696
This one fancies himself
a bit of a poet.

251
00:25:35,777 --> 00:25:36,781
Not good.

252
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:38,616
Dry as a desert outside.

253
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:40,010
No place to go.

254
00:25:40,135 --> 00:25:42,116
He's also delirious from starvation.

255
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,316
Eat up!

256
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:46,566
Get stronger.
Think and hope.

257
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:48,876
Think... and hope...

258
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:50,234
Don't look now!

259
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:53,353
Ohh...
Keep dreaming.

260
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:57,458
There must be some other reason
for your existence.

261
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,632
Did you get anything from him?

262
00:26:00,757 --> 00:26:03,141
Nothing.
Believe me, we've tried...

263
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:04,819
everything.

264
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,062
Defiance tastes like life itself.

265
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,967
No river.

266
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:13,054
No water.

267
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:15,111
Dry as a desert!

268
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:17,871
Darkness all around.

269
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:21,154
The harvest moon is rising.

270
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:24,739
Wraith are never-ending.

271
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,222
I know the future.

272
00:26:32,105 --> 00:26:33,430
Come inside.

273
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,621
I'll show you...

274
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:39,260
your destiny...

275
00:26:40,985 --> 00:26:44,057
John Sheppard.

276
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:50,027
They can get in your head.

277
00:27:00,846 --> 00:27:01,803
You okay?

278
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:05,453
People ever gonna know the truth?

279
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:06,937
Not my decision.

280
00:27:07,062 --> 00:27:09,707
I think people choose to live
in their own happy little delusions.

281
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,650
They don't really
want to know the truth.

282
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:22,373
The other victims
had radioactive residue on 'em.

283
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:25,407
They all did. Once we got wind of it
and our suspicions were confirmed,

284
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:28,032
the whole thing was ultimately
going to be covered up,

285
00:27:28,157 --> 00:27:30,813
but you tracked down the target
before that could happen.

286
00:27:30,938 --> 00:27:32,874
Well, with serial cases,
you're supposed to look

287
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,720
for any victims who got away.

288
00:27:34,845 --> 00:27:36,365
Which is how you found the motel

289
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,923
and the man who reported
radiation sickness.

290
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:41,813
He was most likely exposed because he
was in the room next door to the Wraith.

291
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:43,908
See, we didn't think
to look for bystanders

292
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:47,003
that could have been accidentally
exposed due to proximity.

293
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:48,298
To the alien?

294
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:49,865
No. No.

295
00:27:50,213 --> 00:27:51,688
However, we do believe

296
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:53,568
that the radioactive
material in this case

297
00:27:53,693 --> 00:27:56,850
is being transferred from the target
to the victims.

298
00:27:57,078 --> 00:28:00,356
But the source is being shielded
from our scanning capabilities.

299
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:01,481
What is it?

300
00:28:03,903 --> 00:28:07,594
Look, we know that the Wraith don't need
to feed as often as the target does.

301
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:11,601
I mean, they feed for pleasure,
but not if it means leaving a trail.

302
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:13,312
Some other reason?

303
00:28:13,437 --> 00:28:15,768
If they're sick or injured,
they can regenerate,

304
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:17,523
but it requires energy.

305
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,451
The target must expose himself
to high doses of radiation

306
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:24,198
and has to eat
to counteract the effects.

307
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:25,866
What's the source?

308
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,403
He's building a device.

309
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:32,540
We're not sure of its
intended function,

310
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:36,433
but we know that he was able to salvage
certain parts from his crashed Dart

311
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,212
before we could get to it.

312
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:41,371
- Well, what about the rest?
- The Wraith are smart.

313
00:28:41,496 --> 00:28:44,773
It wouldn't take them long to learn
the ins and outs of the way things work.

314
00:28:44,898 --> 00:28:48,404
He's already acquired
some of the necessary materials

315
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:50,002
but he needs more.

316
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:53,358
He also needs untraceable currency,
or we would have found him by now.

317
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:56,581
So he makes money by playing poker?
There's got to be a better way.

318
00:28:56,706 --> 00:28:58,164
I guess he could rob a bank,

319
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:01,301
but that's risky
and it draws a lot of attention.

320
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:03,237
No, the Wraith love games,

321
00:29:03,823 --> 00:29:06,852
and with their mental abilities,
they are very good at them.

322
00:29:06,977 --> 00:29:09,550
The following
is a worst-case scenario

323
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:11,704
should the device be detonated.

324
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:13,082
Excuse me.

325
00:29:13,606 --> 00:29:14,735
Wait here.

326
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:19,110
- There's a very strong likelihood...
- It's not a bomb.

327
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:22,665
We need to be prepared
for every possibility.

328
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,342
What would be the point
of overcooking half the United States?

329
00:29:26,051 --> 00:29:27,969
- Revenge?
- Not his first choice.

330
00:29:28,094 --> 00:29:30,591
He wants to send up a flare
signaling the location of Earth

331
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:32,057
to the rest of the Wraith.

332
00:29:32,226 --> 00:29:33,303
Excuse me.

333
00:29:33,428 --> 00:29:37,226
He would not need that kind of power
to activate a Wraith communicator.

334
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:40,668
He does if he wants to send a message to
Pegasus and be rescued in his lifetime.

335
00:29:40,793 --> 00:29:42,347
That would require a massive boost.

336
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:44,291
It would require
more energy than he has now.

337
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,153
- Not even a ZPM...
- I know!

338
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:48,954
- That kind of burst is uncontrollable.
- I never said it wasn't dangerous.

339
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,997
It could open up
any number of anomalies.

340
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,871
- Like the inter-dimensional rift?
- Would you stop bringing that up?

341
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,789
Why do you have to constantly
remind me?

342
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:59,005
- You are such a child.
- And yet I am still smarter than you.

343
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:03,279
Don't worry.
Everything's under control.

344
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:13,515
Thank you for your co-operation,
Detective.

345
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:16,603
If you think of anything else,
call me at this number.

346
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:21,505
If he's not finished yet,
why did he stop hiding bodies?

347
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,400
I don't know. Over-confidence
that he can't be caught?

348
00:30:28,753 --> 00:30:30,177
He left money behind.

349
00:30:30,493 --> 00:30:31,492
How much?

350
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:34,088
A few thousand.

351
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:37,289
Not enough to worry about, I guess.

352
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:40,502
That's it?
You're just going to let me go?

353
00:30:42,354 --> 00:30:43,648
That field medic.

354
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:47,273
The one you defied orders
to go back and try and rescue?

355
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,869
You knew her personally.

356
00:30:49,994 --> 00:30:51,029
You were...

357
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:53,180
involved.

358
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:55,516
Yeah, you know everything.

359
00:30:56,665 --> 00:30:58,193
It was a hard choice.

360
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:02,038
Certainly you didn't intend things
to go as badly as they did.

361
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,273
Things just...

362
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:07,371
don't always go the way we plan.

363
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:13,404
We know where to find you.

364
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:20,727
Detective.

365
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,964
Remember when I told you
I once met another version of you?

366
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:28,601
Yeah.

367
00:31:28,726 --> 00:31:31,635
I know you'll probably think
this sounds ridiculous,

368
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:35,430
but a little while ago, we accidentally
opened a rift in space/time...

369
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:38,475
Went through to an alternate
version of reality.

370
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,686
Very similar to ours in many ways.

371
00:31:41,352 --> 00:31:43,353
I met a team,
much like the one I work with,

372
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:45,225
only you were the leader.

373
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:47,217
You were a hero...

374
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:51,669
- Saved the world several times over.
- Doesn't sound much like me.

375
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:53,739
I don't think there's much
difference between you

376
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:55,826
and the other John Sheppard I met.

377
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:58,506
It's amazing how one incident

378
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,578
can entirely alter
the course of your life.

379
00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:03,601
Still...

380
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:06,911
I'd like to believe you have
the same strength of character.

381
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:08,839
That's why I told you the truth.

382
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:13,259
What do you want me to say?

383
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,873
For now?

384
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:16,664
Nothing.

385
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:38,042
What's going on?

386
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:50,760
<i>They feed on human energy.
Literally sap the life out of people</i>

387
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:52,984
<i>using the sucker on their hand.</i>

388
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:56,613
<i>Dry as a desert outside.</i>

389
00:33:58,222 --> 00:33:59,324
<i>No place to go.</i>

390
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:04,747
<i>He wants to send up a flare</i>

391
00:34:04,872 --> 00:34:07,248
<i>signaling the location of Earth
to the rest of the Wraith.</i>

392
00:34:09,736 --> 00:34:11,711
<i>Wraith are never-ending.</i>

393
00:34:12,294 --> 00:34:14,672
<i>I know the future.</i>

394
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:17,508
<i>That would require a massive boost.</i>

395
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,636
<i>He needs more power than he has!</i>

396
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:24,599
<i>I'll show you your destiny...</i>

397
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:27,936
<i>John Sheppard.</i>

398
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:59,068
Recalibrating the scanners to look for
similar isotopes at maximum sensitivity

399
00:34:59,193 --> 00:35:01,948
just shows us huge patches
of radioactive desert.

400
00:35:02,073 --> 00:35:03,633
From 40-year-old nuclear testing.

401
00:35:03,758 --> 00:35:05,521
We're talking
hundreds of square miles.

402
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:07,141
It's like a needle in a haystack.

403
00:35:07,513 --> 00:35:10,694
Or, he could've abandoned the resources
he had and just gone into hiding.

404
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:14,254
Yes, he probably got a job as a Klingon
at <i>Star Trek: The Experience</i>.

405
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:17,235
- That shut down.
- Really? Damn. I wanted to see that.

406
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:19,904
Dr. McKay, there's a call for you.
John Sheppard.

407
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:25,194
- Hello?
<i>- I found him.</i>

408
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,530
He thinks he's found him!
How?

409
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:29,968
I remembered the trailer
from the motel.

410
00:35:30,198 --> 00:35:32,083
One of those old silver bullets.

411
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:35,656
Just a hunch. You said he needed
more power, so I drove along

412
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:38,381
some of the more remote
power lines into the city.

413
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:41,694
Harriman!
He's going to tap into the grid.

414
00:35:42,914 --> 00:35:45,221
We should have
John Sheppard's coordinates.

415
00:35:56,693 --> 00:35:57,907
Listen to me.

416
00:35:58,225 --> 00:35:59,360
I know what I said,

417
00:35:59,528 --> 00:36:01,580
but do not engage.
Do you hear me?

418
00:36:07,828 --> 00:36:08,621
Crap.

419
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:24,732
ETA to target...
Three minutes.

420
00:39:25,942 --> 00:39:29,125
We have widespread power outages
being reported across the state.

421
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,002
Daedalus is transmitting
new sensor data.

422
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:32,819
Got it! A massive subspace event.

423
00:39:32,944 --> 00:39:35,483
Ten times the power of an active
Stargate, and getting stronger.

424
00:39:35,608 --> 00:39:37,500
Its scope increases
the longer it stays active.

425
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,093
- What is it?
- It's a transmission.

426
00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:42,040
Coded in Wraith.

427
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,500
I'm working on it.

428
00:39:43,668 --> 00:39:45,042
Target has been acquired, sir.

429
00:39:46,331 --> 00:39:47,528
Take it out.

430
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:16,533
We have a direct hit!
Target has been neutralized.

431
00:40:17,033 --> 00:40:18,660
The transmission has ceased.

432
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:25,042
It contained the location of Earth.

433
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:28,337
Is there a chance
it reached Pegasus?

434
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:29,772
No.

435
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:32,947
I've seen
this energy signature before.

436
00:40:33,072 --> 00:40:33,994
I know.

437
00:40:35,086 --> 00:40:38,149
It looks like the device tore a small
hole in the space-time continuum.

438
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,057
- Do you think that was intended?
- No.

439
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:43,226
Most of the energy meant to carry the
Wraith transmission went thru the rift.

440
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:45,888
- To where?
- Well, there's no way to know for sure.

441
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:47,314
Other realities.

442
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:51,193
I'm sorry,
but I only care about us right now.

443
00:40:51,757 --> 00:40:54,696
If John Sheppard hadn't found
that Wraith when he did,

444
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:57,740
that transmission definitely would
have made it through to Pegasus.

445
00:40:58,683 --> 00:41:00,074
He saved our asses.

446
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:02,817
But that transmission
would have been stronger

447
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:05,749
in any other reality
exposed to the rift.

448
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:10,962
They could be
in a lot of trouble right now.
