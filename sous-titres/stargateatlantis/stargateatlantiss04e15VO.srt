00:00:00,247 --> 00:00:02,041
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis.

2
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:04,132
So someone was monitoring
my sister's computer.

3
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:06,740
<i>I think I've cracked their trojan,
and I've got an address.</i>

4
00:00:06,863 --> 00:00:09,179
- <i>Barrett and I are on our way there.</i>
- <i>You're coming with us.</i>

5
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:13,433
- You okay?
- Two men, they must have followed us.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,489
He's not here, they took him.

7
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:17,256
- Dr. McKay.
- Who are you?

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,146
My name is Henry Wallace.

9
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:21,775
<i>She's suffering from
acute lymphocyctic leukemia.</i>

10
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:25,235
Sharon was injected with
the first batch of nanites one week ago.

11
00:00:25,355 --> 00:00:28,615
Get the nanites fully operational,
then I'll let you go.

12
00:00:33,304 --> 00:00:35,455
Daedalus, this is Sheppard.
We need a lift.

13
00:00:39,627 --> 00:00:41,945
I watched it last night.
There was hardly any fighting.

14
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:44,918
- That's 'cause it's not about fighting.
- Then why's it called Blades of Glory?

15
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:47,038
Because it's about skate blades.

16
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,241
And this is a real sport?

17
00:00:49,419 --> 00:00:51,240
Men and women dancing around on ice?

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,700
Unfortunately.

19
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,642
- Your planet's weird.
- You can say that again.

20
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,335
<i>Colonel.</i>

21
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:00,575
I was just coming to see you.
Do you have a minute?

22
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:01,800
Yeah, sure.

23
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:05,777
I received a message from the SGC.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

24
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:08,389
Okay...

25
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:12,367
Your father suffered
a heart attack last night.

26
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:15,910
I'm sorry, John, but he passed away.

00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:27,382
I...

36
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:30,368
heard what happened.
I'm very sorry.

37
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,218
Thanks.

38
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:38,376
You okay?

39
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:40,951
Yeah. I'm fine.

40
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:46,521
You know, I requested
to go back with you, but the

41
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:49,107
ancient device on M7G-677
is malfunctioning.

42
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:52,514
Isn't that the planet with all the kids?

43
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:53,403
Yeah.

44
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,613
Should be fun for you.

45
00:03:56,338 --> 00:03:59,117
Believe me, I'd get out of it
if I could, but without the EM field,

46
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:01,516
they're an easy target for the Wraith...

47
00:04:02,153 --> 00:04:04,706
- I guess it's just bad timing.
- Don't worry about it.

48
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:13,438
- If you wanna, you know, talk or...
- Rodney.

49
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,476
I'm fine.

50
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:20,031
Right.

51
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:49,659
Where are you going?

52
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,948
With you.

53
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:20,263
A lot of people.

54
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:23,117
Yeah, my old man
was pretty well connected.

55
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,451
John.

56
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:33,566
Dave.

57
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,923
I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.
It's good to see you.

58
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:41,302
I contacted your unit Commander
at Peterson, but...

59
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:44,359
sometimes those messages
don't seem to reach you.

60
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:46,797
Well, I came as soon as I heard.

61
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:50,689
This is Ronon.

62
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:53,783
Ronon, this is Dave, my brother.

63
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:56,677
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

64
00:05:58,731 --> 00:05:59,992
You two...

65
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,156
work together, in the Air Force?

66
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:03,992
<i>He's a civilian contractor.</i>

67
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:06,828
Right.

68
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:12,792
Anyway...
John, I think we should probably talk.

69
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:15,405
Yeah.

70
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,172
I'll catch up with you later.

71
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:12,924
This is free, right?

72
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:14,469
Yes, it's free.

73
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:15,897
Thanks.

74
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:27,414
Lots of food over there.

75
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:29,281
I'm good.

76
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,569
This the house you were raised in?

77
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:32,964
One of 'em.

78
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:34,166
That's nice.

79
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:35,917
I couldn't wait to get out of here.


80
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,541
Yeah? Why?

81
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:40,173
Well, my dad's idea of...

82
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,530
teenage rebellion was going
to Stanford instead of Harvard.

83
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,648
Never mind. He just...

84
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:50,320
He had everything planned out
for me since I was about 14.

85
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:52,919
So what do we do now?

86
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:55,928
Well, mostly, people
sit around, drink...

87
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:57,171
eat...

88
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,777
Some more than others.
Mostly they talk.

89
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,848
They don't know what to say,
but they talk.

90
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:07,719
Your brother seems
to be handling it well.

91
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,034
That's what he does, he handles things.

92
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:12,739
How come you never mentioned him before?

93
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,163
It's complicated.

94
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:26,003
I told you I had an ex-wife, right?

95
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:28,483
- Yeah, why?
- Here she comes.

96
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:31,634
Hi, John.

97
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:33,381
Nancy.

98
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:37,228
I didn't expect to see you here.

99
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,274
I'm very sorry.

100
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:46,170
Nancy, Ronon.

101
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:47,603
Ronon, Nancy.

102
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:49,266
Pleased to meet you.

103
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,075
How long you are you here?

104
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:52,359
Just for today.

105
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,829
I have to be in Washington
tomorrow, so...

106
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:57,006
- Still with Homeland Security?
- Yeah.

107
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:59,459
I just got promoted.
I'm a director now.

108
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:01,335
Congratulations.

109
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,549
How's... how's Greg?

110
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,117
- Grant.
- Grant.

111
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:12,763
He would've come, but he's...

112
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:14,825
he's trying a case in Phoenix.

113
00:09:15,546 --> 00:09:17,180
Well, sounds like he's doing well.

114
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,311
Yeah. He is.

115
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:19,376
He's...

116
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:21,278
Yeah, he's doing well.

117
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:26,750
You know, your dad was always
very good to me.

118
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:29,040
Well...

119
00:09:29,358 --> 00:09:30,400
In his mind,

120
00:09:31,276 --> 00:09:33,993
marrying you was probably
the best thing I ever did.

121
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,662
Okay.

122
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:40,374
Well, it's good to see you again, John.

123
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:43,487
Take care of yourself.

124
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:46,422
It's nice to meet you.

125
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:48,886
Nice to meet you.

126
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:01,696
Lieutenant-Colonel John Sheppard?

127
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:02,567
Yes.

128
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:04,343
My name is Ava Dixon.

129
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:05,691
You must be Ronon.

130
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:08,365
Do I know you?

131
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:09,819
No, we've never met, but,

132
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,323
you knew the man I used to work for,
Henry Wallace?

133
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:15,159
Doesn't ring a bell.

134
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,323
Look, I realize you have to keep up
appearances in public,

135
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:20,400
but I don't have time to play games.

136
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,785
Henry Wallace was the man who kidnapped
your colleague, Dr. Rodney McKay,

137
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:26,879
and forced him to work on a highly
illegal research project involving

138
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,793
- alien techno...
- Who the hell are you?

139
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:30,967
We need to talk.
But not here.

140
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:39,821
Take her to the car.

141
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:43,944
John, I was thinking
that we should prob...

142
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:45,828
Something came up, I've got to go.

143
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:48,859
It's dad's wake.

144
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:51,070
I know, but this is work-related.

145
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:55,262
What is it, top secret?

146
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:57,395
National security, that sort of thing?

147
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:59,203
Well, something like that.

148
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:01,955
You know, this is so typical.

149
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:03,769
You got something to say, just say it.

150
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:07,169
There's just one thing I want to know.
What's your level of expectation here?

151
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,610
What are you talking about?

152
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,507
Are you gonna challenge the will?

153
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:16,704
I have no idea what it says, of course,
but I think I can guess.

154
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,017
That's what's you want to talk about?
You want to talk about money?

155
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:22,977
That's why you're here, isn't it?

156
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:27,023
You've been gone a long time, John.
It's not such a stretch.

157
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:32,418
You got nothing to worry about.

158
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:34,230
Hey!

159
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:39,030
If I've got the wrong impression
of you, it's not my fault.

160
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:41,358
You're the one who left, remember?

161
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:42,278
<i>I stayed.</i>

162
00:11:42,398 --> 00:11:44,790
<i>I looked after dad, I ran the business,</i>

163
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,043
while you were off doing God knows what.

164
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:48,427
I'm assuming...

165
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,372
that's what dad wanted.

166
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:51,966
No.

167
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:54,487
No, it's not, John.

168
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:57,845
Dad regretted
what happened between you two.

169
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:01,538
Right up until the end.

170
00:12:16,774 --> 00:12:19,867
<i>I would've come to you sooner,
but you're a hard man to find.</i>

171
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,728
All right, you've got our attention.
What's this all about?

172
00:12:24,848 --> 00:12:26,677
For the past three years,
I've been working

173
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,584
for a company called Stanton Research,

174
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:31,580
a division
of Devlin Medical Technologies.

175
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,220
I was recruited out of college

176
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,445
by a brilliant scientist
named Dr. Richard Poole,

177
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:38,719
and together we worked on a secret
project, codename archetype.

178
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,173
What kind of project?

179
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,600
We were experimenting
with nanite programming,

180
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,892
trying to increase the complexity
of their interactions.

181
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:48,104
Listen, I wasn't aware
of what happened to

182
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:50,672
Dr. McKay and his sister
until much later.

183
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:53,699
At the time, all I knew was that we'd
been given a key piece of programming,

184
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:55,977
something that allowed
us to make a major breakthrough.

185
00:12:56,097 --> 00:12:57,392
What are you talking about?

186
00:12:57,512 --> 00:13:01,283
Well, it's one thing to inject nanites
into a mechanical or a biological system

187
00:13:01,444 --> 00:13:04,078
for the purpose of affecting changes
at a molecular level,

188
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:06,661
but it's quite another
to use them as building blocks

189
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:09,417
to create an entirely
self-sustaining entity.

190
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:13,551
<i>To be honest, I never thought
I'd see it in my lifetime.</i>

191
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:17,464
<i>But, then, all of a sudden, we began
making incredible advancements,</i>

192
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:19,120
<i>and the next thing I knew...</i>

193
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,382
<i>there it was.</i>

194
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:28,861
You built a Replicator?

195
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:30,688
Technically, that term isn't accurate,

196
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:33,610
because self-replicating isn't one
of its primary directives, but...

197
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:34,730
yes.

198
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:37,111
There's no way you had
authorization to do this.

199
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:39,777
Richard told me the project
was being funded at the highest levels.

200
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:42,950
- And you believed him.
- Maybe it sounds a little naive, but...

201
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,366
Well, Richard was like a father to me.

202
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:48,539
My own parents died when I was
very young, and I trusted him.

203
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:52,580
<i>But then one day, he came back
to the lab in a panic.</i>

204
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:57,489
- What's happening?
- There's been a security breach.

205
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,356
We have to shut everything down.

206
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:01,603
- I don't understand.
- Look, I don't have

207
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:03,637
time to explain it to you right now.
Just do it!

208
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:09,478
<i>I later found out
what was really going on.</i>

209
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:12,938
<i>The IOA's investigation
of Devlin Medical was closing in,</i>

210
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:16,135
<i>and Richard wanted
to get rid of the evidence.</i>

211
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,855
I'm sorry about this.

212
00:14:42,726 --> 00:14:44,153
<i>He killed to escape.</i>

213
00:14:44,273 --> 00:14:46,344
<i>If he's threatened, he could kill again.</i>

214
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:48,064
<i>I had to do something.</i>

215
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,183
<i>You're telling me there's a Replicator</i>

216
00:14:51,303 --> 00:14:52,722
loose on Earth?

217
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:54,042
That's right.

218
00:14:54,162 --> 00:14:55,021
How long?

219
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,044
Well, he escaped three weeks ago.

220
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,867
We've been working
on a way to track him,

221
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:01,695
but so far have had no success.
He could be anywhere by now.

222
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,458
Show your hands!
Get 'em up!

223
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:22,040
Sir, the facility is secure.

224
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:25,036
- Looks like he was the only one here.
- Colonel Sheppard,

225
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:26,761
and Ronon, of course.

226
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:29,932
- How did you find me?
- Well, we had a little help.

227
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,215
I'm sorry, Richard.

228
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,545
Ava. My God.
Do you realize what you've done?

229
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:40,025
I didn't have a choice.
I couldn't let this continue any longer.

230
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:43,554
- I had the situation under control!
- Your little science project

231
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:46,395
got two of your own men killed, and
he's still on the loose. I don't think

232
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:48,886
- you have control of anything.
- He killed in self-defense!

233
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:51,033
If he's not threatened again,
he won't harm anyone!

234
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:52,965
That's because we're going to find him,


235
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,885
and we're going to neutralize him,
and you...

236
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:57,403
are going to help.

237
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:00,504
Apollo, we're ready.

238
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:12,953
All right.

239
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:17,073
Let's start with giving me the access
code to the data files we recovered.

240
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:18,692
I don't think so.

241
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:25,288
You do know we will crack it eventually.

242
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:29,935
The entire directory is encrypted
with an 448 bit key symmetric algorithm.

243
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:31,342
Good luck.

244
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:36,498
- What about you?
- I never gave her the code.

245
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:38,663
It was for her own protection.

246
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:42,668
Look...

247
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:45,745
I'll cooperate,

248
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:48,886
as long as you guarantee
that I get to bring him in.

249
00:16:49,186 --> 00:16:50,310
Forget it.

250
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:52,626
We're talking about
an incredibly advanced

251
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,350
and valuable piece of technology here.

252
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,315
You've had your chance.
Now it's my turn.

253
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:59,355
Are you going to help us
track this thing or not?

254
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:00,806
I'll help you, Colonel.

255
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:04,048
Be realistic, Richard.
He's out there alone.

256
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:07,154
You know he's not programmed
for ordinary social interaction.

257
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:11,241
<i>What happens if someone accidentally
frightens him or corners him?</i>

258
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:13,911
We can't afford to wait any longer.

259
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:24,254
Colonel Sheppard.

260
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:25,979
Bates!

261
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:28,194
You two know each other?

262
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,727
Yeah, Bates served on Atlantis
when we first got there.

263
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:34,348
Then he got into it with a Wraith
and took a pretty good beating.

264
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:36,897
He got the drop on me, but I still
managed to get in a few shots.

265
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:38,352
- How're you doing?
- Ronon.

266
00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:40,285
- You're with NID?
- IOA.

267
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:42,938
After the Air Force gave me an honorable
discharge due to my injuries,

268
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:44,935
the IOA contacted me.
They were starting up

269
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:46,944
a new field division,
dealing specifically with

270
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:49,847
operational threats on Earth,
and it seemed like a good fit.

271
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,408
- It's good to see you back in action.
- You too, Sir.

272
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:54,956
- You don't have to call me that.
- I guess not.

273
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:56,526
Old habits die hard.

274
00:17:56,646 --> 00:17:57,894
So how are our prisoners?

275
00:17:58,014 --> 00:18:00,003
- The girl's cooperating.
- What about Dr. Poole?

276
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:01,243
Ah, not so much.

277
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:03,045
Can we track the Replicator without him?

278
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,865
Got a guy working on it.

279
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:08,494
Stupid emergency contact numbers.

280
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:10,526
Never should have answered
that damn phone.

281
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:12,596
Come on, Doc. It's not so bad.

282
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,320
It was my first vacation in three years!

283
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:17,933
Two weeks, all-inclusive nothing but

284
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:20,275
surf, sun, and skimpy bikinis

285
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:22,338
as far as the eye could see.

286
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:25,914
And then they beamed me
right out of the damned hotel room!

287
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:29,934
Looks like they did you a favor.
Next time, use a little sunblock.

288
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,321
Give it another shot.

289
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:36,285
It's working.

290
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:41,452
This sensor technology is incredible.
Is it alien?

291
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:46,879
Sorry, I forgot.
I'm not supposed to know any of this.

292
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:50,427
I'm picking up a signal.

293
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,426
Let me see if I can
narrow in on this a bit.

294
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:55,835
There, he should be in there.

295
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:57,973
- How big of an area is that?
- That's about

296
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,224
five city blocks.

297
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:01,015
Seal it off, get everyone out.

298
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:03,463
<i>We'll call it a chemical spill.
I'll get my people on it.</i>

299
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,515
I need to know what I'm up against.
What abilities does this thing have?

300
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:09,818
Speed, strength, agility,
all well beyond normal human levels.

301
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:12,863
What about tactics, escape, evasion...
Does it have any military training?

302
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:16,325
I wasn't responsible
for that aspect of his programming.

303
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:21,663
See, I've had this
really crappy few days,

304
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:24,581
so I'm beginning to lose my patience...

305
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:27,543
So whatever you can do
to make this easier

306
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:29,213
may work in your favor.

307
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:30,875
Where, at my trial?

308
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:33,763
In front of a judge
and jury of my peers?

309
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:35,826
We both know that's not going to happen.

310
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:38,936
They're going to put me
in some deep, dark hole at Area 51,

311
00:19:39,056 --> 00:19:41,056
never to be heard from again,

312
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:44,686
and nothing I say or do now
is going to make any difference.

313
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:46,548
Well, maybe not for you.

314
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:48,736
What about the girl?

315
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:52,455
She didn't know that this technology

316
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:54,613
was obtained illegally.
She's completely innocent.

317
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:57,407
Well, like you said...
there isn't going to be a trial.

318
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,700
But she's helping you!

319
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,161
Not good enough.

320
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:03,491
What's it going to be, Doc?

321
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:11,253
All right.
So where do we start?

322
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,482
Well, Doc?

323
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:17,517
He's in defensive mode.
Basically, he's hiding.

324
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:21,103
He'll be where he's least likely
to encounter people.

325
00:20:21,223 --> 00:20:22,817
That would be this warehouse here.

326
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:25,195
It's been abandoned for months.
The company went bankrupt.

327
00:20:25,315 --> 00:20:27,062
And you won't need these.

328
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:30,206
<i>He's specifically designed
to be resistant</i>

329
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:33,443
- to current anti-Replicator technology.
- So what do we hit him with?

330
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:36,375
Well, without access to base materials,

331
00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:39,201
he has a limited ability
to self-repair...

332
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:43,443
But if you insist on damaging him,
conventional weapons

333
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:45,789
ought to do the trick,
although you'll need firepower.

334
00:20:45,949 --> 00:20:47,696
Firepower we can do.
What's he going to do

335
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:49,684
- when he sees us?
- He'll continue to evade

336
00:20:49,804 --> 00:20:50,955
as long as possible.

337
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:53,772
He'll counterattack
only as a last resort.

338
00:20:54,604 --> 00:20:56,210
All right, listen up.

339
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:58,627
Let's try to get this right
the first time.

340
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:01,513
We're going to operate in teams of two.
Your objective is to find the target.

341
00:21:01,818 --> 00:21:04,133
Once you do that,
you will not engage him.

342
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:06,134
You will radio in his position.

343
00:21:06,254 --> 00:21:08,979
We'll coordinate, see if we can't
corral him into a corner.

344
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,050
<i>At which point, we will bring
as much force to bear as we can,</i>

345
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,001
and take him out, all right?
Let's do this.

346
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:15,996
Dr. Poole, you're with me.

347
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:20,755
I'm good.

348
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:23,920
How're you doing?

349
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:27,363
- One hell of a week.
- Yeah.

350
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:48,481
What is it?

351
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:49,609
It's him.

352
00:21:50,638 --> 00:21:52,407
Colonel Sheppard, come in.

353
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,441
<i>Go ahead.</i>

354
00:21:56,324 --> 00:21:57,903
<i>We got a visual on the target.</i>

355
00:21:58,422 --> 00:22:00,698
He's hiding out in a building
about a hundred yards due east

356
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:01,926
of my start position.

357
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:04,910
<i>- Looks like he's alone.</i>
- Stay put! We'll be there in a minute.

358
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,761
Understood. Bates out.

359
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:17,740
<i>Hello?</i>

360
00:22:22,192 --> 00:22:23,295
It's okay.

361
00:22:26,853 --> 00:22:28,293
You can come out now.

362
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:34,353
I'm here to help you.

363
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:39,219
Good.

364
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:41,636
Okay,

365
00:22:42,014 --> 00:22:43,141
listen to me.

366
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:46,660
There are men out there
who are looking for you.

367
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:49,744
It's all right.
They won't hurt you,

368
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:53,083
as long as I can convince them
that you're not a threat.

369
00:22:54,213 --> 00:22:55,671
How did you find me?

370
00:22:56,749 --> 00:23:00,007
Your nanites give off an energy
signature. We were able to track it.

371
00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:02,259
That's why you can't run anymore.

372
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:05,351
You have to do as I say.

373
00:23:07,507 --> 00:23:09,349
You have to self-deactivate.

374
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:11,435
<i>You've done it before, in the lab,</i>

375
00:23:11,595 --> 00:23:13,315
many times.
I was always right there

376
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,030
to help you get back online.

377
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,649
This isn't any different.

378
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,487
Now, you have to trust me.

379
00:23:25,046 --> 00:23:27,218
Everything is going to be all right.

380
00:23:32,857 --> 00:23:33,857
I'm sorry.

381
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:48,889
Apollo, this is Sheppard. I need you
to beam up Agent Bates immediately.

382
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,307
Where's Dr. Poole?

383
00:23:59,091 --> 00:23:59,826
Hey!

384
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,178
Over here.

385
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:09,731
<i>He's dead.</i>

386
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:17,459
<i>Dr. Lee, come in.</i>

387
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,144
Yeah, go ahead.

388
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:22,005
<i>We've got a problem.
Poole's dead.</i>

389
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:26,270
<i>Are you still tracking the Replicator?</i>

390
00:24:27,314 --> 00:24:28,791
Yeah.
Just hang on.

391
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:32,682
Okay, I've got him. He's on the move,
he's heading south...

392
00:24:32,842 --> 00:24:34,208
he's right by...

393
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:36,237
What?

394
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,226
<i>I just lost the signal.</i>

395
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:39,070
Crap.

396
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:41,099
<i>It wasn't me.
I mean, he just disappeared.</i>

397
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:44,458
Well, get him back online.
Ronon and I are going after him.

398
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:01,029
Sorry, sir.

399
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:03,726
I know we weren't supposed to engage,
but he came from out of nowhere.

400
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:05,636
<i>He hit us before we knew
what was happening.</i>

401
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:07,926
All right, it'll be okay, Sarge,
sit tight.

402
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:16,960
Take care of him.

403
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,320
All right, so much for evasion.

404
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,020
He's desperate.
He knows we have him trapped.

405
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,471
This is Sheppard.

406
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,406
Change of plans.

407
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,288
Fall back, create a defensive perimeter.

408
00:25:27,408 --> 00:25:29,787
Ronon and I are going
to flush him out. Let's go.

409
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:01,855
Heading southeast, toward the water.

410
00:26:02,015 --> 00:26:03,028
Copy that.

411
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:18,765
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

412
00:27:55,578 --> 00:27:58,287
<i>We've checked the whole area
twice. No sign of him.</i>

413
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,509
- Which means he could be anywhere.
- What about the tracking system?

414
00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:04,517
Dr. Lee's working on it, but the sensors
haven't picked up anything yet.

415
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:06,425
He must have found a way
to mask the signal.

416
00:28:06,545 --> 00:28:08,599
Great, back to square one, then.

417
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:15,363
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>

418
00:28:15,523 --> 00:28:17,657
I've managed to boost
the sensitivity 200%,

419
00:28:17,777 --> 00:28:19,550
but I still can't pick anything up.

420
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,847
How's it going with
those files from the lab?

421
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:25,212
Well, I'm running a decryption program,
but it's slow going.

422
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:26,975
I may have to make a few tweaks.

423
00:28:27,095 --> 00:28:28,376
Focus on that for now.

424
00:28:28,716 --> 00:28:31,379
We don't know there's anything in there
that's gonna help us track him.

425
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,173
I know, but something's not right.

426
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:34,758
What do you mean?

427
00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:38,303
Well, why'd Poole go in there?
Why'd he risk his life?

428
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:40,316
Thought he could talk the Replicator in.

429
00:28:40,436 --> 00:28:43,436
Even if that worked, even if we decided
not to destroy that thing,

430
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,971
that doesn't change the fact
that Poole was going away forever.

431
00:28:46,094 --> 00:28:48,146
Maybe he didn't wanna see
his life's work destroyed.

432
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:50,449
That's what he wanted us to think,
I'm not buying it.

433
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:52,817
He's been spoon-fed half
this technology. He stole the rest.

434
00:28:53,254 --> 00:28:55,219
<i>No, he wanted to save the Replicator</i>

435
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:57,651
because he thought
it would do him some good.

436
00:28:57,898 --> 00:28:59,832
I'm thinking he's got a buyer,

437
00:28:59,952 --> 00:29:02,494
somebody who can get him out of this
if he delivers the goods.

438
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,119
I know the type.

439
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:05,121
Military,

440
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:07,140
or ex-military, probably a colonel.

441
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,875
Not a general, too high profile.

442
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:11,204
<i>Regular IOA Channels won't help.</i>

443
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:14,267
<i>These guys operate in the shadows
with no official authorization.</i>

444
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:16,510
That way, everyone's ass is covered.

445
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:19,010
So, where does this leave us?

446
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:32,814
Well, this is a surprise.

447
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,544
Why's that?

448
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,554
Two John Sheppard
encounters in two days?

449
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:40,581
I hardly saw you that much
when we were married.

450
00:29:41,371 --> 00:29:42,721
What can I do for you?

451
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:47,892
I need a favor.

452
00:29:49,385 --> 00:29:52,605
I need as much information
as possible about

453
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,463
a project possibly codename "Archetype."

454
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:59,092
You want me to use my security clearance
to get you classified information?

455
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:00,874
I didn't say it was a small favor.

456
00:30:00,994 --> 00:30:03,513
Do you know how hard I've worked
to get to where I am?

457
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:06,863
If I get caught doing something like
this, I could lose everything.

458
00:30:06,983 --> 00:30:09,352
Well, I know. I wouldn't ask you
if it wasn't important.

459
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:13,022
All right, what's it about?

460
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:16,484
I can't tell you.

461
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,554
- That's typical.
- What the hell's that supposed to mean?

462
00:30:20,856 --> 00:30:22,449
I haven't seen you in over four years,

463
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,869
you want me to put my job on the line,
you won't even tell me why?

464
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:30,040
All right. When you put it that way,
it sounds a little crappy.

465
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,732
Well, I'm glad you noticed.

466
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:33,710
It's too bad
you didn't a little earlier...

467
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,753
say, like, when we were still together.

468
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:38,418
When I think back to all those times

469
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:40,354
that you would just take that call

470
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:42,297
and leave, no apologies,

471
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:43,925
no explanations...

472
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:46,976
For all I knew,
you were halfway around the world

473
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,683
flying secret missions into Somalia--

474
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:50,725
That's ridiculous.
I've never been to Somalia.

475
00:30:50,845 --> 00:30:51,936
North Korea, then.

476
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:53,396
There's a big difference.

477
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:01,079
I put up with your secrets then, John.

478
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:03,823
I don't have to do it now.

479
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,167
Right.

480
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,050
Hey.

481
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:16,037
Colonel.

482
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:20,325
They said I could come,
take some of his personal things.

483
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:23,118
I'm sorry about what happened.

484
00:31:23,872 --> 00:31:24,872
Me too.

485
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,722
He died thinking I betrayed him.

486
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:29,307
You don't know that.

487
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:32,205
That's nice of you to say, but...

488
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:34,320
<i>this project meant everything to him.</i>

489
00:31:34,556 --> 00:31:37,169
Well, maybe you meant
something to him too.

490
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:39,826
You never know what people are thinking.

491
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,445
Even those you're closest to?

492
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:44,268
Especially those.

493
00:31:48,597 --> 00:31:49,667
Colonel?

494
00:31:52,831 --> 00:31:55,750
Look, I know this is not a good time,
but I gotta ask you something.

495
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,732
What is it?

496
00:31:56,852 --> 00:31:58,978
Did anyone else know about this project?

497
00:31:59,372 --> 00:32:01,089
No one came to check on your progress?

498
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:04,133
Richard and I were the only ones
who had access to the lab.

499
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:05,760
Was he in contact with anyone?

500
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,804
Maybe from in the military...
phone, emails?

501
00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:10,098
Not that I know of.

502
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:12,445
All right.

503
00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:16,544
Colonel, how's it coming
with the sensors?

504
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:20,483
It's not, but Dr. Lee says he's pretty
close to breaking the encryption code.

505
00:32:21,246 --> 00:32:23,999
- I thought that was impossible.
- Guess not.

506
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,233
Well, how's it going?

507
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:34,791
I was just about to call you.

508
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,199
I managed to open
those files from the lab.

509
00:32:37,478 --> 00:32:39,158
Nice work. Anything interesting?

510
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:40,612
You could say that.

511
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:42,589
Stanton research personnel records.

512
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,675
<i>That is Ava Dixon's file.</i>

513
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:49,012
She was in a car accident last december.
Head-on collision.

514
00:32:50,116 --> 00:32:52,308
<i>She's been dead for almost a year.</i>

515
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:10,896
Is he dead?

516
00:33:11,016 --> 00:33:13,329
No... but he's going to
have a hell of a headache.

517
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:20,653
Sheppard.

518
00:33:24,443 --> 00:33:26,685
"Colonel Sheppard,
I never meant for any of this to happen.

519
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,594
I'm very sorry. Ava."

520
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:37,947
So, she's a Replicator?

521
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:39,292
Yeah, it looks that way.

522
00:33:39,412 --> 00:33:42,002
I've got two sets of blueprints...
one male, one female.

523
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:43,583
What about the sensors?

524
00:33:43,703 --> 00:33:45,860
We've got nothing.
She's masking her energy signature,

525
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:47,922
<i>- same way the other did.</i>
- Doesn't make sense.

526
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:50,239
She came to us.
Why didn't she just keep her mouth shut?

527
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,326
Why didn't she kill the guard?

528
00:33:53,673 --> 00:33:55,328
Come on, a Replicator with a conscience?

529
00:33:55,488 --> 00:33:57,705
Well, her programming
is distinct from the other one.

530
00:33:57,825 --> 00:33:59,040
He's a military model,

531
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,953
she's designed for social interaction,

532
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,836
simulation of emotions,
maybe even empathy.

533
00:34:03,996 --> 00:34:05,695
He built her to replace

534
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:07,340
a dead woman from his past.

535
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,967
Does that mean she can't kill?

536
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:11,427
I'd say it's less likely,
but not impossible.

537
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:13,636
We need 'em both.
Anything useful left in those files?

538
00:34:13,756 --> 00:34:15,363
Well, not much so far.

539
00:34:15,483 --> 00:34:17,092
<i>Colonel Sheppard, come in.</i>

540
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:19,113
This is Sheppard. Go ahead.

541
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:22,573
<i>You've got an urgent message, Sir,
relayed through Peterson.</i>

542
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:33,655
Well, you really got
the cloak-and-dagger thing down.

543
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:35,417
I learned from the best.

544
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,976
It's everything
I could find on Archetype.

545
00:34:39,504 --> 00:34:41,127
It's not much, but... whatever it is,

546
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,007
no one will touch it
with a ten-foot pole.

547
00:34:43,127 --> 00:34:45,022
Yeah, right. I owe you one.

548
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:47,066
Damn right you do.

549
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,551
You know, it's funny.
When you and I were together,

550
00:34:52,154 --> 00:34:55,077
I couldn't stand it when you wouldn't be
able to tell me where you were going

551
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:56,723
or what you were doing...

552
00:34:57,693 --> 00:35:00,125
and, now, every once in a while,

553
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:03,043
I catch Grant looking at me
the same way.

554
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,884
When I was doing my snooping around,
I took the liberty

555
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,068
of asking a few questions
about you, John.

556
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,381
That's really not such a good idea.

557
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:13,114
Yeah, I got that impression.

558
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:17,323
I've seen walls go up quickly before,
but never like this,

559
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:19,926
and whatever you're into,
it's obviously big,

560
00:35:20,046 --> 00:35:22,749
and my guess is, very dangerous.

561
00:35:24,114 --> 00:35:25,960
I just want you to be careful.

562
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:28,017
Well, you know me.

563
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:30,963
Yeah.

564
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:33,134
That's the problem.

565
00:35:38,497 --> 00:35:39,901
Goodbye, John.

566
00:35:47,555 --> 00:35:50,038
<i>Well, she wasn't kidding.
So far, it's a whole lot of nothing.</i>

567
00:35:50,158 --> 00:35:53,160
Lab requisitions,
non-disclosure agreements...

568
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:54,971
Here's an exciting one...

569
00:35:55,091 --> 00:35:56,856
an internal memo reminding employees

570
00:35:56,976 --> 00:36:00,620
not to use the south parking lot
due to ongoing repaving.

571
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,122
Hold on.

572
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:06,134
- What is it?
- It's a shipping waybill

573
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:08,116
with instructions to deliver a

574
00:36:08,236 --> 00:36:11,051
load of preassembled masonry panels
to a warehouse in Reading.

575
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:12,007
So?

576
00:36:12,465 --> 00:36:13,281
So?

577
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:16,490
"Preassembled masonry panels"...
that was a code word we used

578
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:19,928
a few months back to identify
shipments of neutronium.

579
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:25,187
Neutronium... it's the base element
from which nanites are made.

580
00:36:25,307 --> 00:36:26,979
You guys damaged him, right?

581
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,273
<i>If he wants to fully repair,
he's gonna need this.</i>

582
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:30,942
He's gonna go for the warehouse?


583
00:36:31,102 --> 00:36:32,652
Assuming he knows where it is.

584
00:36:33,846 --> 00:36:36,102
To be perfectly honest,
we don't have anything else.

585
00:36:36,222 --> 00:36:38,574
- That's a good point.
<i>- All right, I'll set up a stake-out,</i>

586
00:36:38,734 --> 00:36:40,451
and if he shows up, we'll know about it.

587
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,768
This could be our last shot at this guy.

588
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:45,692
We gotta make sure
he goes down for good.

589
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:47,426
That's not gonna be easy.

590
00:36:47,546 --> 00:36:49,509
I mean, if this was the movies,
we'd drop him into

591
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:51,659
a vat of molten steel or...

592
00:36:52,536 --> 00:36:53,796
a volcano.

593
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,706
You know, the fires from whence he came?

594
00:36:57,826 --> 00:36:59,370
What the hell's he talking about?

595
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,266
That's a really good idea.

596
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,865
- Really?
- Really?

597
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:12,373
<i>Sheppard, this is Apollo. We're all set.</i>

598
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:13,620
<i>Understood.</i>

599
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,838
Are you sure he's gonna show up?

600
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:22,243
- The IOA said they spotted him nearby.
- And what if he spotted them?

601
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:27,039
Bates, see anything?

602
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:29,041
<i>Negative. All quiet over here.</i>

603
00:37:29,502 --> 00:37:30,751
Be patient. He'll show up.

604
00:38:33,874 --> 00:38:35,399
You should not have interfered.

605
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:56,247
Now!

606
00:39:02,177 --> 00:39:03,807
What happened?
Where did you send him?

607
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:05,012
<i>Low Earth orbit.</i>

608
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,266
I know by experience,
re-entry's a bitch.

609
00:39:32,936 --> 00:39:35,278
<i>The IOA isn't just gonna let her go.</i>

610
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,753
<i>If she stayed away,
we never would've found her.</i>

611
00:39:38,368 --> 00:39:40,603
The only reason she's here
is because she chose to help us.

612
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:43,019
- Yeah, I know.
- She's a machine.

613
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:45,252
Well, we're all machines,

614
00:39:45,372 --> 00:39:47,287
just different kinds.

615
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,765
<i>What if we took her to another planet?</i>

616
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:52,207
Somewhere with no people,
where she can't do any harm.

617
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:54,103
I don't think that's much of a reward.

618
00:39:54,263 --> 00:39:56,605
The IOA would never agree
to let her leave Earth anyway.

619
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,317
She could work at Stargate Command.

620
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:01,151
She would be a valuable asset.

621
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:03,354
She'd be a constant security threat.

622
00:40:03,474 --> 00:40:05,281
- We don't know that.
- No, he's right.

623
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:07,491
There's no escaping the fact
she's a Replicator.

624
00:40:10,312 --> 00:40:11,723
So what, then?

625
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,335
How are you settling
in to your new life?

626
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:26,270
It's a bit of an adjustment.

627
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:28,452
One of the stipulations of my release

628
00:40:28,572 --> 00:40:31,432
is that I don't look
for a job in any scientific field.

629
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:33,902
To be honest, I'm not sure
what I'm gonna do.

630
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:36,268
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

631
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:38,743
I wanted to thank you, Colonel.

632
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,054
I know they never would've let me go
if you hadn't put in a word for me.

633
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:45,150
Well, you saved my life. Putting
a word in is the least I could do.

634
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:48,185
I have to admit, I'm a little scared.

635
00:40:48,952 --> 00:40:52,444
I mean, I know these emotions
are supposed to be artificial, but

636
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:53,871
they seem pretty real to me.

637
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:56,313
Well, what do you got
to be scared about?

638
00:40:56,728 --> 00:40:58,769
Well, I've never really
been alone before.

639
00:41:00,152 --> 00:41:02,919
Richard was the closest thing
I ever had to family.

640
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,454
Anyway,

641
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:08,645
it was nice for you to check up on me.

642
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:11,977
I guess we'll never
see each other again.

643
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:15,133
Well, one thing I've learned
about my business is...

644
00:41:15,253 --> 00:41:16,576
never say never.

645
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,214
Goodbye, Colonel.

646
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:32,890
So? How was it in there?

647
00:41:33,018 --> 00:41:34,972
Well, it was very nice work.

648
00:41:35,975 --> 00:41:37,205
Very convincing.

649
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:41,333
I'm just glad we were able
to download her consciousness intact.

650
00:41:41,453 --> 00:41:43,216
Anyway... Now she has a whole

651
00:41:43,336 --> 00:41:45,507
virtual world to explore.

652
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:48,444
Should keep her pretty busy for a while.

653
00:41:48,804 --> 00:41:49,592
So,

654
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:51,450
what happened to the rest of her?

655
00:41:52,158 --> 00:41:54,415
They deactivated the bond
between her nanites,

656
00:41:54,535 --> 00:41:56,392
effectively breaking her
into base elements.

657
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:00,208
They scrapped her.

658
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:03,858
Yeah? So, we heading back?

659
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:08,149
Yeah. You go ahead.
I got a few things to take care of.

660
00:42:45,871 --> 00:42:46,789
Come in.
