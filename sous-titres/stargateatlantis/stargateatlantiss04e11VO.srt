1
00:00:00,574 --> 00:00:02,210
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,011
I believe you refer to our enemy
as the Replicators.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,140
They have begun to annihilate
human worlds.

4
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,470
We need to know if you can shut down
the Replicator attack code on your own.

5
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:19,397
I've been looking into that,
and it's not very promising.

6
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:21,774
<i>But with this Wraith's help,
you think you could do it?</i>

7
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:25,236
- Take this.
- What's this?

8
00:00:25,396 --> 00:00:27,906
It's the core drive
of a ship's tracking system.

9
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:29,243
If this works,

10
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:32,379
we should be able to track
every Aurora-class Replicator ship

11
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:34,180
in the galaxy in real-time.

12
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:37,873
<i>My duplicate did say
they were building more.</i>

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,479
A lot more!

14
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:47,622
- Don't worry, we're ahead of schedule.
- I know.

15
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,027
All the settlements we've been assigned
have been evacuated.

16
00:00:50,164 --> 00:00:51,955
I know, I know. It's just that...

17
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,443
most of the planets that are
in the Replicators' path are people

18
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,351
that we've had almost no contact with,

19
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,769
so I need you and Teyla out there
as much as possible.

20
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:02,644
I think it might be the `flu. She's
been looking a little green lately.

21
00:01:03,626 --> 00:01:04,606
I am fine.

22
00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:07,022
Where are we going to now?

23
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:09,255
M9R-373.

24
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:12,622
The Sions. It should be interesting.

25
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,716
Look, I'm sorry
we're having to go out so much.

26
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:16,490
I know you don't feel so hot, but

27
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,139
you're the one
with all the contacts out there, so...

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,398
It's all right.
I'm feeling much better now.

29
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,970
<i>Offworld activation.</i>

30
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:29,392
Must be Lieutenant Kemp's team.

31
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:34,162
<i>Receiving video transmission.
Coming in now, Colonel.</i>

32
00:01:40,744 --> 00:01:42,564
Lieutenant.
Looks like things are going well.

33
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,323
<i>Most of the settlement's
on their way through,</i>

34
00:01:45,443 --> 00:01:47,815
<i>but a good number of them
have decided to stay behind.</i>

35
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:49,893
<i>I'm not sure they believe us, Sir.</i>

36
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:52,777
<i>I'm requesting Teyla come back and try
to talk some sense into the stragglers.</i>

37
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,376
<i>I'm not gettin' anywhere with `em.</i>

38
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:56,665
Hell. I don't think we can do that.

39
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:59,342
The Replicator ship's gonna be there
within a half hour.

40
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,454
<i>I don't know what to do. They...</i>

41
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:02,930
<i>Incoming!</i>

42
00:02:05,103 --> 00:02:06,670
<i>Too late! They're already here!</i>

43
00:02:06,832 --> 00:02:08,297
Get your men through the Gate!

44
00:02:08,718 --> 00:02:10,544
<i>I can't! There's no way through...</i>

45
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:12,926
<i>We lost transmission.</i>

46
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:14,617
Dial `em back.

47
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:20,357
- Can't get a lock.
- They must have taken out the Gate.

48
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,462
How many people
were left on that settlement?

49
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:24,307
Just under two thousand.

50
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:37,759
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

58
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,905
- Both ships at the same time.
- This is a first.

59
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:45,977
This is the first time we've need them.

60
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,709
Well, since I've been here.

61
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,160
- Colonel.
- Colonel.

62
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,591
- Colonel.
- Colonels.

63
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:58,742
Colonel.

64
00:03:58,865 --> 00:03:59,673
Colonels.

65
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:01,286
Seriously?

66
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:04,445
- Good flight?
- Long flight.

67
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:06,790
- We'll make it worth your while.
- <i>That's what I hear.</i>

68
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:09,079
You have a way of tracking
the Replicator ships?

69
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,930
<i>We do.</i>

70
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:12,146
That'll make finding and
destroying them a lot easier.

71
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:14,540
Why don't you come into my office?
We'll get you briefed.

72
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:20,913
It is this recent discovery
of the essential duality

73
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:22,877
of this particular stem
of the nano sub-code

74
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:25,294
that has opened up
a whole world of possibilities

75
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:26,778
when it comes to the expedient

76
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,354
and permanent deactivation
of the internanite bonds...

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,515
Rodney...

78
00:04:30,674 --> 00:04:32,774
I'll let you know when
I'll take questions, thank you.

79
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,861
Have you created
an anti-Replicator weapon or not?

80
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:37,325
If you just let me continue,

81
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,842
I think you'd have a better
understanding of the complexity...

82
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:41,198
Yes or no, Doctor.

83
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,120
Well, no.

84
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:47,205
- All right, we move on to plan B.
- Just like that?

85
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:50,249
The Replicators are destroying
every human colony they can find

86
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,361
in an attempt to wipe out
the Wraith's food supply.

87
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:53,512
We can't wait.

88
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:54,907
We have to act now.

89
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:56,879
But plan B, it's not a good plan.

90
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:58,090
Oh, no?

91
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:00,403
Sure, the Apollo and the Daedalus
have been retrofitted

92
00:05:00,523 --> 00:05:02,346
with the new Asgard plasma beam weapons,

93
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:05,545
which, given, are very powerful, they
still can't destroy the Replicators.

94
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:08,102
We don't have to destroy them,
we just destroy their ships.

95
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:09,388
From what I understand,

96
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,982
once they're exposed
to the harsh environment of space,

97
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,608
they'll essentially be neutralized.

98
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:16,613
"Essentially neutralized" and
"neutralized" are very different things.

99
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:19,457
Back when we blasted Niam
into space, he froze solid.

100
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:21,580
We didn't have a problem till we

101
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,492
- warmed him up.
- <i>That's what I'm saying.</i>

102
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:27,035
Your way leaves
Replicator cells inactive,

103
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:29,415
just waiting around
for someone to reactivate them.

104
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:30,952
My way shuts them down for good.

105
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:33,042
But our way is actually operational.

106
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:34,917
Come to think of it,

107
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,005
what exactly is your way?

108
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:38,428
From what I understand,

109
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,547
you haven't even gotten
your programming done yet,

110
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,133
let alone a delivery method.

111
00:05:42,297 --> 00:05:44,078
You didn't let me finish
my presentation.

112
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,806
I think I got the gist of it.

113
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:47,566
Really?

114
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:51,851
No, I'm just wondering when the Colonel
here became a math and physics expert.

115
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:55,175
Doctor, you came into this meeting
knowing that you had nothing,

116
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:57,190
but instead of just
saying that like a man,

117
00:05:57,353 --> 00:05:58,927
you thought that you'd dazzle us

118
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:01,738
with a lot of fancy talk and think
that we were too dumb to notice.

119
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,949
- Now you're questioning my manhood?
- Enough.

120
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:05,895
- No, he just told...
- Rodney.

121
00:06:06,456 --> 00:06:07,242
Move on.

122
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:10,218
Look,

123
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:12,409
I think we've got
this tracking system down.

124
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:15,002
We can peg where they're going to be
with a 30-minute window,

125
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,381
and given current data,
we've got at least 12 hours

126
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:20,470
before any of their ships are even
close to an inhabited planet.

127
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,800
Give me and the Wraith, like, 10 hours

128
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:24,544
to get the shut-down program working.

129
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:27,172
If I don't,
then you can just feel free to go ahead

130
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:29,142
and open up on them
with your beam weapons.

131
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,612
<i>All right.</i>

132
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,270
You have 10 hours. Go.

133
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,540
I don't understand
how you guys put up with...

134
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,227
If you ever talk like that to someone
under my command again,

135
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:46,241
you will not be welcome on this base,
Colonel. Is that clear?

136
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:49,331
Yes,

137
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:50,735
it is.

138
00:06:51,497 --> 00:06:52,329
Good.

139
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,184
We're done here.

140
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:55,733
Thank you.

141
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:59,855
- Why would you lie to them?
- I didn't lie to them.

142
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:03,553
It is most improbable that
we complete our task within 10 hours.

143
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,630
That is quitter talk.
Look, you don't know me.

144
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,740
This is when I'm at my best, this is
when I shine... Impossible deadlines.

145
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,940
I ever tell you about the time I got a
damaged Ancient hyperdrive system online

146
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,536
moments before me and my crew
were incinerated by a super volcano?

147
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,239
Yes, you have.

148
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,489
Well, there you go.
See, I work best under pressure.

149
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:21,490
Then perhaps
I should threaten to feed on you

150
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,363
if we do not complete
the coding in time.

151
00:07:23,483 --> 00:07:25,772
Easy, easy.
He's just kidding.

152
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:28,116
Just tell them you were joking.

153
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:31,062
Right.

154
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,063
I'll work in this area.

155
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:43,913
Time's up.

156
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:45,421
So soon?

157
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:48,316
- I guess that means you're not ready.
- No, I'm not.

158
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:50,590
We're going with plan B.
You want to go for a ride?

159
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,396
No, I'll stay here.
This still needs to get done.

160
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,542
Good luck.

161
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:08,618
Daedalus, this is the Apollo,
our scans are clear.

162
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,043
We don't have any other contacts.
Can you confirm?

163
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:12,741
<i>Copy that. We have the same reading.</i>

164
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:14,824
Colonel, how long
before our guest arrives?

165
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:16,487
Should be any second now.

166
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:17,898
Won't they be surprised.

167
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:19,563
We're going weapons hot, Apollo.

168
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:21,496
<i>Copy that.
We have done the same.</i>

169
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:24,265
I'm detecting
a hyperspace window opening.

170
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:27,286
Stand by
to fire forward beam weapons.

171
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:33,418
Fire.

172
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:49,427
Contact has been neutralized.

173
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,499
I wish I'd had these
a few years ago.

174
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:57,234
Well, the first attack is easy.
They didn't know we were coming.

175
00:08:57,354 --> 00:09:00,275
The Replicators have proven
very effective in changing strategies

176
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:01,734
<i>when faced with failure.</i>

177
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:04,298
Still, we took that ship down
without breaking a sweat.

178
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,211
Right.
One down...

179
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:08,208
37 to go.

180
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:17,650
- Welcome back.
- Were in the neighborhood.

181
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:20,248
- Thought I'd stop by, resupply.
- How's it going out there?

182
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:23,181
Splitting us up was a good call.
The Daedalus has downed another 3 ships.

183
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,377
Ellis got another two.
That brings us to seven.

184
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:26,710
That's not bad at all.

185
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,550
I'll need about an hour to get what
we need, then we'll get back out there.

186
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,174
Well, there's been
a little change of plans.

187
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:33,654
- Really?
- Yeah.

188
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:36,864
<i>- They're falling back?</i>
- Safety in numbers.

189
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,413
Evidently, they haven't figured out
how we're tracking them and...

190
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:41,620
Or they haven't figured out
how to stop us.

191
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,558
Either way,
they wanna stop losing ships.

192
00:09:43,678 --> 00:09:45,364
They're headed back
to their homeworld.

193
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,157
- That's right.
<i>- Well, that's good.</i>

194
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:50,327
<i>They're finally all in one place.
We can wipe them out all at once.</i>

195
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,827
Ideally, yes,

196
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:54,680
but our two ships
versus an entire Replicator fleet...

197
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,615
Not to mention the drones
they'll be firing from the surface.

198
00:09:57,741 --> 00:09:59,605
The new weapons we have
are very effective,

199
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,889
but they are no match
for that kind of fire power.

200
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:03,932
<i>Well, sounds like the perfect time</i>

201
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:07,317
<i>to finally use that killer program
you've been working on, Doctor.</i>

202
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:09,432
Yeah.

203
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:13,156
<i>Remember when you said all you needed
was 10 hours to finish it?</i>

204
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:15,729
- Vaguely.
<i>- Well, it's been 10 hours...</i>

205
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,027
<i>And a week.
Are you finished?</i>

206
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:20,993
Well, I'm just...
dotting some "i"s, crossing some "t"s.

207
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:23,363
Whatever our plan is,
we need to act quickly.

208
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:27,087
Our intel suggests they're putting all
their resources into building new ships.

209
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:30,173
I figure we have less than a week before
they head back out into the galaxy,

210
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:31,640
and in much greater numbers.

211
00:10:31,783 --> 00:10:34,495
If they start traveling in packs, our
kill rate is gonna drop drastically.

212
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:35,865
We can't let that happen.

213
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,423
We need to take them out
while they're all in one place,

214
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:39,993
and we need to do it quickly.

215
00:10:44,635 --> 00:10:46,865
Hey, I should
just get back to my lab.

216
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:58,426
I have to tell them. I have
to tell them we don't have anything.

217
00:10:58,546 --> 00:10:59,990
This is most troubling.

218
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,694
Ellis is gonna love this.

219
00:11:02,322 --> 00:11:03,377
I don't get it.

220
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,546
We tried reconfiguring your stand-down
code, we tried programming the nanites

221
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,750
to turn themselves off.
Something should have worked.

222
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:11,679
They are a very complex
and ingenious design.

223
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,740
Yeah, well, I thought I was ingeniouser.

224
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,831
Yes, I know that's not
a word, Mr. Helpful.

225
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:19,116
All right, look,

226
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:22,991
maybe we could figure out some way
to use the anti-Replicator guns somehow.

227
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:26,707
From what you have told me, they have
almost certainly become immune to it.

228
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:29,797
Even if they haven't, we'd still have
to get them all in one place.

229
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,041
What is it?

230
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:37,912
I think I've got my first
good idea in three weeks.

231
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,122
<i>Our old anti-Replicator technology</i>

232
00:11:44,284 --> 00:11:47,553
relied on disrupting the bonds
between each individual nanite cell.

233
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,114
They just collapsed
in a pile of dust, right?

234
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:52,776
We're familiar
with the technology, yes...

235
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:54,113
Right, well,

236
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:56,302
the thinking is always
to continue down that line...

237
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:58,529
To break the bonds,
to turn them off,

238
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:02,083
sever their connections to one another,
because dust we can deal with, right?

239
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:03,184
Rodney.

240
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:05,229
We do the opposite.

241
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:07,758
Instead of severing their connections,
we significantly

242
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:09,614
dial up their attraction to one another.

243
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:12,974
We turn each cell into an incredibly
powerful nanite magnet.

244
00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:15,802
You know, one cell attracts
another cell, those 2 attract 2 more,

245
00:12:15,922 --> 00:12:18,844
and as more and more nanite cells
bond to the core group,

246
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:21,408
they become stronger and stronger
and stronger, to the point where

247
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:23,863
every Replicator cell on the planet,
in orbit, all of them,

248
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:26,934
are amassed
in this giant, super-dense blob.

249
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:31,817
A super dense-blob?
That's your great idea?

250
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:34,429
It is, yes, actually.

251
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:36,765
What do we do with the blob, then?

252
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:40,956
Aren't we in danger of creating
some Godzilla-sized super-Replicator?

253
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:42,797
No. At least not at first.

254
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:44,791
<i>This is not
their normal form of bonding.</i>

255
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,450
It will take them some time to adapt,
to figure out how to function

256
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,698
- within the new parameters.
<i>- How much time?</i>

257
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:52,008
- Well, I mean, I'd hate to speculate.
- Since when?

258
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:54,917
It doesn't matter anyways,
because, long before that happens,

259
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:58,191
they're gonna fuse together so tightly,
they will be rendered essentially inert.

260
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,810
Remember, this bond is occurring
on a subspace level...

261
00:13:00,986 --> 00:13:04,092
Which helps get them past the normal
repulsive force between nuclei...

262
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:05,703
To the point where their electrons

263
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:08,644
are fusing with their protons, and once
that starts happening, they're toast.

264
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:11,075
Yeah, but you're talking about
neutron star levels of density.

265
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,373
Precisely.

266
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:16,843
It sounds crazy, but...

267
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:18,315
this could work.

268
00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:20,185
Well, how do we make it work, then?

269
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:23,003
Just upload a new command
into their base code?

270
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:25,397
I have a better idea.

271
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:32,471
- What's this?
- This...

272
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:34,753
this has been in storage
since we found it a while ago.

273
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:36,979
The Ancients used it
as part of their research

274
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:39,620
into the creation
of human form Replicators.

275
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:41,319
What are you suggesting?

276
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:44,831
We have the technology,
the understanding of nanite coding.

277
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:47,310
We have the Ancients' blueprints,
for crying out loud.

278
00:13:47,497 --> 00:13:49,064
You want to make your own Replicator?

279
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:50,266
Not a whole one.

280
00:13:50,386 --> 00:13:53,138
Just a block of nanite cells,
say, yay big...

281
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:56,062
- Just enough to get the ball rolling.
- I don't know, Rodney...

282
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,809
I'm not talking about creating anything
with normal Replicator abilities.

283
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:01,251
Just a group of nanite cells
that can serve as a platform

284
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:03,199
for us to upload
the new bonding program.

285
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:05,951
We take it to the Replicator homeworld,
we switch it on,

286
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:09,476
we beam it into a populated area, and we
sit back and watch. Couldn't be easier.

287
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:14,647
- There is one problem.
- Only one?

288
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:17,555
The Replicators on the planet will be
affected quickly, but there'll be

289
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:19,455
a definite delay
until there's enough mass

290
00:14:19,577 --> 00:14:21,397
to attract the nanite cells in orbit.

291
00:14:21,517 --> 00:14:23,519
So those ships will have
plenty of time to escape.

292
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,200
Unless we disable or destroy them.

293
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:27,452
They have 30 ships, we have two.

294
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,486
If we don't disable them, they're gonna

295
00:14:29,606 --> 00:14:31,513
fly away, lay low
and replicate a new army.

296
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:33,166
<i>30 ships versus two.</i>

297
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:34,459
Can't be done.

298
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,714
We might be able to get more ships.

299
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,262
Depending on what has happened
since I have been in captivity here,

300
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:50,210
I can easily bring
another 12 ships to the battle.

301
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:51,476
<i>12 ships!</i>

302
00:14:51,638 --> 00:14:53,588
Willing to fight shoulder to shoulder?

303
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:57,271
For a chance to destroy the Replicators
once and for all...

304
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:58,784
of course.

305
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:02,028
It at least brings
the odds down to two to one.

306
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:05,281
An alliance like this
must be negotiated.

307
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,571
I will need to personally convince them

308
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:12,163
that this is
the proper course of action.

309
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:37,469
Sit down.

310
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:44,287
First sign you cross us...

311
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:45,283
I die.

312
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:46,712
I know.

313
00:16:06,784 --> 00:16:08,923
Well, this is different.

314
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,395
Receiving transmission...

315
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:16,060
<i>Docking instructions.</i>

316
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:18,771
All right, let's get this over with.

317
00:16:43,658 --> 00:16:44,742
Now what?

318
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:49,302
You open the door.

319
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:57,002
Perhaps we should remove these.

320
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:00,647
<i>I think it sends the wrong message,</i>

321
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,204
don't you?

322
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:03,983
This is a mistake.

323
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:06,428
We need his help.

324
00:17:09,776 --> 00:17:11,754
I've got a bad feeling about this.

325
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:14,903
Well, we're here, let's see it through.

326
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,033
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy, guys...

327
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:46,180
All right, the basic nanite material
has been formed.

328
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,018
Let's see if we can get
them to interact.

329
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:50,475
I must say, Rodney,
this is quite an ingenious idea.

330
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,043
- Would you expect anything less?
- Well...

331
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:54,187
What?

332
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:56,819
You've been in a bit of a rut lately.

333
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:58,981
- I have not.
- Okay, like a dry spell.

334
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,248
That is not true.

335
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,789
- It's not.
- Okay!

336
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:02,877
Okay.

337
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:06,349
Now, are we certain that these nanites
will not go beyond simple cohesion?

338
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:08,555
Of course. I've disabled
most of the normal protocols.

339
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:11,361
They won't be able to do anything
beyond form a simple block.

340
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,492
All right, here we go.

341
00:18:20,237 --> 00:18:22,611
- It worked. You did it, Rodney.
- Naturally.

342
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:25,732
- McKay is back!
- Stop that. I was never gone.

343
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:29,905
Whoa, wait a minute,
we've got a problem.

344
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:32,961
The cells aren't communicating properly.

345
00:18:38,057 --> 00:18:39,495
Could be tougher than I thought.

346
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:42,430
And I don't want
to hear you say anything.

347
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,210
Be calm.

348
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:06,272
Here.

349
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:09,233
What the hell's going on?

350
00:19:09,954 --> 00:19:12,294
Apparently, my fellow Wraith
wanted to speak to me

351
00:19:12,414 --> 00:19:14,342
without you being around.

352
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:19,852
They might have just politely asked us
to stay in the Jumper.

353
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:22,997
Come, now, you would never have
let me leave your sight.

354
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,833
Well, we'll never know now, will we?

355
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,547
We have a deal...

356
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,218
Seven hives will join us in the fight.

357
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,094
Seven? You said 12.

358
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:40,373
Not all of them were convinced
that the mission was achievable.

359
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:43,643
Plus, many of our ships
are without queens.

360
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:46,813
<i>We'd be unable to create new soldiers
should they fall.</i>

361
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:50,957
- If you'd prefer none...
- All right, seven.

362
00:19:55,914 --> 00:19:57,365
How did I wake up before Ronon?

363
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,918
We had to stun him several times.

364
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:04,664
I thought it would be best
that you were awake before he was.

365
00:20:05,306 --> 00:20:07,110
Probably a good idea.

366
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:13,923
- Are we in space?
- The hives have already left.

367
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:17,009
They jettisoned your ship
before they jumped into hyperspace.

368
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:19,940
Anything else happened
while we were unconscious

369
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,347
that I should know about?

370
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:25,765
I must return to Atlantis
to help Dr. McKay complete our plan.

371
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:33,542
Help me wake them up
and we'll get out of here.

372
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:39,365
<i>All right,</i>

373
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:41,643
<i>looking good.</i>

374
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,169
Rodney, it's being held together
by a force field.

375
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:45,814
I know. I wanted to give the cells

376
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:47,779
time to establish
their own internal cohesion.

377
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:50,322
Now, we drop the field

378
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:52,586
and they should hold together.

379
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:55,421
Not bad, not bad.

380
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:57,271
Structure is intact.

381
00:20:57,635 --> 00:20:58,997
Bonds are holding.

382
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:07,531
Dammit.

383
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,992
It's no use, Rodney.

384
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:11,535
You've disabled too many
of the cells' basic protocols.

385
00:21:11,655 --> 00:21:13,320
It was never designed to work this way.

386
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,614
In that case,
there's only one thing we can do.

387
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:16,825
<i>Dr. Zelenka?</i>

388
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:18,123
Yes?

389
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:20,183
<i>They need to see you
right away in section seven.</i>

390
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:22,318
<i>We're having some power problems
in the infirmary.</i>

391
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:26,164
I should go. This won't take too long.
Is it all right if I just...

392
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:27,289
Go, go...

393
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,701
You're probably holding me back anyway.

394
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:42,095
Ronon, let it go.

395
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,168
Take it as a compliment...
They were afraid of you.

396
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:49,769
Dial the Gate.

397
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,774
I'm detecting
a hyperspace window forming.

398
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:57,819
Your guys forget something?

399
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:09,952
It's an ancestral warship.

400
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:11,790
Replicators. Dial the Gate.

401
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:14,583
- How did they find us?
- I have an idea.

402
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:16,629
You are mistaken.

403
00:22:17,308 --> 00:22:18,589
Receiving transmission.

404
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:19,474
What?

405
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:21,765
<i>Sheppard, that better not be you.</i>

406
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:24,024
Larrin?

407
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:27,597
<i>What the hell are you doing here?</i>

408
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:29,396
What the hell are you doing here?

409
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,810
<i>We picked up on seven hives
orbiting a single planet.</i>

410
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:34,186
<i>Seemed like something big
was going down, so</i>

411
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,387
<i>I thought we'd stop
and do a little intel.</i>

412
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:39,152
Yeah, well, you just missed them.
- <i> I see that.</i>

413
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:41,908
<i>Now, tell me, what are you doing here?
And better yet...</i>

414
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:44,444
<i>why didn't those hives
destroy your puny little ship?</i>

415
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:47,998
I take great offense to that,

416
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:50,484
but those are all good questions, so

417
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:53,396
- we should talk.
<i>- Yes, we should.</i>

418
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:55,192
<i>Use bay three.</i>

419
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,835
Better her than the Replicators, right?

420
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:00,731
Let's see what kind of mood she's in.

421
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:10,182
Larrin...

422
00:23:12,035 --> 00:23:13,688
That Wraith better be a prisoner.

423
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:15,229
Now, I know how it looks.

424
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,313
Kill it.

425
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:19,419
Hey, hey, hey! No killing, okay?

426
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:20,401
<i>Just...</i>

427
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:22,456
hear me out.

428
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:23,936
<i>So,</i>

429
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:27,554
the idea is to keep the Replicator ships
from leaving orbit until this...

430
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,347
McKay guy can suck them back
down to the planet?

431
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,907
Couldn't have put it better myself.

432
00:23:33,027 --> 00:23:36,457
- And since you only have two ships...
- We need the Wraith to help.

433
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:39,208
We figure the Replicators have

434
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,147
close to 30 ships
guarding the surface.

435
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:43,202
The Wraith bring
another seven to the fight.

436
00:23:43,332 --> 00:23:45,461
- Still not very good odds.
- No, no...

437
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:47,503
But unless we... I don't know,

438
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:50,631
meet someone with access to ships,
it will have to do.

439
00:23:52,895 --> 00:23:56,429
One of the planets we trade with was
completely wiped out a few weeks ago.

440
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:59,060
<i>We thought it was the Wraith,
but it didn't fit...</i>

441
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:01,307
They weren't culled,

442
00:24:01,534 --> 00:24:02,563
they were leveled.

443
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:04,108
Replicators.

444
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,417
The last time we worked together,

445
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:09,814
I said I'd let you keep a few secrets,

446
00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:12,736
but not anymore.

447
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:14,497
If we do this,

448
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:16,288
we go all the way.

449
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:17,990
No holding back.

450
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:21,896
All right.

451
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:23,924
Look...

452
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,506
<i>Your ship is still a mess.</i>

453
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:29,252
We have scientists
that have the ancient gene.

454
00:24:29,393 --> 00:24:31,180
Maybe they can help you supe it up.

455
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:34,970
Well, I'll have to talk
to our governing council,

456
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:37,681
<i>but even if they agree to move forward,</i>

457
00:24:38,006 --> 00:24:41,568
it'll be up to the individual ship
captains if they want to join us or not.

458
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:44,982
And fighting alongside the Wraith
isn't going to be popular.

459
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,400
Well, we know how persuasive you can be.

460
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:50,943
- I'll start making the calls.
<i>- Oh, great.</i>

461
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:54,306
This is all working out for the best...
It's...

462
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:56,809
Except for the part
where I'm still tied up, Larrin.

463
00:24:59,097 --> 00:24:59,986
Larrin?

464
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:08,197
You and I have
2 very different definitions

465
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:10,589
- of "this won't take too long."
- I know. I'm really sorry.

466
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:14,265
The naquadah generator in section 7 is
giving us trouble, but it's fixed now,

467
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:16,516
I'm all yours.
What would you like to try?

468
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,471
Actually, unencumbered by the continual
need to explain things to you...

469
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:21,844
- I've made remarkable progress.
- Oh, really?

470
00:25:21,964 --> 00:25:24,316
The systems the Ancients had in place
were designed to create

471
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:26,570
- fully-functional humanoid replicants.
- Yes.

472
00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:29,876
Well, turns out that trying to create
something much simpler is ironically,

473
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:33,431
much more difficult.
In the end, I was forced to compromise.

474
00:25:33,694 --> 00:25:34,890
You're not suggesting...

475
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,557
I know it wasn't part of the plan,
but it was either this or nothing.

476
00:25:45,097 --> 00:25:45,900
Hello.

477
00:25:52,172 --> 00:25:53,130
Oh, my...

478
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,700
We should go check on McKay,
see if he made any progress.

479
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:08,259
I must go see Dr. Keller.

480
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:10,542
- Why's that?
- I was stunned.

481
00:26:10,756 --> 00:26:12,642
We get stunned all the time.
Shake it off.

482
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:14,962
<i>The circumstances are different.</i>

483
00:26:15,154 --> 00:26:16,034
How so?

484
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:21,073
I am carrying a child.

485
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:23,787
You're what?

486
00:26:26,675 --> 00:26:28,562
I am pregnant, John.

487
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,297
Is this a joke?

488
00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:33,907
Don't look at me.

489
00:26:34,137 --> 00:26:35,448
It just happened.

490
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:38,183
I didn't even know
you were seeing anybody.

491
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,223
It is no one from Atlantis.

492
00:26:42,593 --> 00:26:43,385
How...

493
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,523
far along are you?

494
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,559
About three months...

495
00:26:48,677 --> 00:26:49,568
Three...

496
00:26:50,795 --> 00:26:52,471
How long have you known?

497
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:54,067
Just under two.

498
00:26:54,235 --> 00:26:58,094
We've been...
You let me put you out in the field

499
00:26:58,215 --> 00:27:00,705
when you've known
you were three months pregnant?

500
00:27:00,865 --> 00:27:02,164
I tried to tell you.

501
00:27:02,326 --> 00:27:03,643
You didn't try hard enough.

502
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:05,472
I am more than capable of...

503
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:07,044
You got stunned today.

504
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:09,213
Do you have any idea what kind
of effect that has?

505
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:13,375
Athosian woman remain
very active in the community...

506
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:14,876
This is different.

507
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:18,098
We get shot at, beat up, stunned...

508
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:20,754
We take a chance
every time we walk through the Gate.

509
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:22,477
- John...
- As of this second,

510
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:25,171
you are relieved from active duty.

511
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:30,182
Hey...

512
00:27:31,807 --> 00:27:32,932
Congratulations.

513
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,392
<i>- Kanan is the father?</i>
- You knew that we were...

514
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:39,075
I could tell.
The way you talked about him.

515
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,072
Yes,

516
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:44,117
he is the father.

517
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:45,832
I'm sorry.

518
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:47,962
I will find him.

519
00:27:49,296 --> 00:27:51,133
He is still alive... I feel it.

520
00:27:51,257 --> 00:27:52,896
We'll find him. Together.

521
00:27:53,732 --> 00:27:54,632
I promise.

522
00:27:56,522 --> 00:27:57,254
Come on.

523
00:27:57,424 --> 00:27:59,242
Let's go get you checked out.

524
00:28:01,774 --> 00:28:03,406
You know, "Ronon",

525
00:28:03,805 --> 00:28:05,655
it's a good name. Boy or girl.

526
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:10,231
So that brings the grand total to...

527
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:11,200
14.

528
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:13,460
Larrin said she can get
three or four more ships.

529
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,466
- That's great.
- Yeah.

530
00:28:16,123 --> 00:28:18,093
- You okay?
- Yeah.

531
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:20,568
I'm taking Teyla off active duty.

532
00:28:20,753 --> 00:28:22,482
- Why?
- She's pregnant.

533
00:28:25,063 --> 00:28:26,139
Okay.

534
00:28:26,514 --> 00:28:27,796
Who's the father?

535
00:28:29,347 --> 00:28:30,565
I never asked.

536
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:33,912
Wow. It has been one hell of a day.

537
00:28:34,818 --> 00:28:37,982
There's one more thing you need to see.
McKay's kind of thrown us a curve ball.

538
00:28:38,102 --> 00:28:41,233
Great. I was just thinking
we need more of those today.

539
00:28:47,084 --> 00:28:49,881
This is not
what we talked about, Rodney.

540
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:53,261
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the block
idea didn't fly. This was the only way.

541
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,496
Do you have any idea
what kind of a security threat this is?

542
00:28:56,616 --> 00:28:59,361
It's not as bad as you think. I've
stripped down its programming as much as

543
00:28:59,481 --> 00:29:02,036
I possibly could
without sacrificing basic viability.

544
00:29:02,238 --> 00:29:03,669
It can walk, it can talk, but...

545
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:05,940
it can't replicate,
or change its form, or anything.

546
00:29:06,466 --> 00:29:09,073
- Does she know why she was created?
- Of course.

547
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:12,349
Well, then she has a certain
amount of self-awareness.

548
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:13,541
Yeah, so?

549
00:29:13,661 --> 00:29:14,535
So?

550
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:18,781
Honestly, I'm not sure how comfortable
I am sending her to her death.

551
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:19,818
Death?

552
00:29:20,503 --> 00:29:23,597
It can't die. It's not alive.
It's a program.

553
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:26,359
<i>I mean, its "consciousness" is just
a bunch of ones and zeros.</i>

554
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:29,158
I mean, you can call it she all
you want, but it's still just a thing.

555
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,849
It's a prop. It's a really advanced
radio-controlled weapon.

556
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:35,486
I mean, you don't feel sorry
for your bullets, do you? Your bombs?

557
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:36,777
All right, still.

558
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:39,470
It's weird.

559
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,725
Well, at the end of the day,
it doesn't matter anyway,

560
00:29:41,845 --> 00:29:43,926
because we don't have any other choice.

561
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:47,684
We are teaming up with the Wraith.

562
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:49,873
I guess it's that kind of a mission.

563
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,609
- We have a problem.
- What is it?

564
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,028
I've been going over your calculations.

565
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:02,738
I thought it would be prudent,
for the good of the mission.

566
00:30:02,858 --> 00:30:05,310
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, no, it's fine.

567
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,479
I think you've underestimated
how quickly the nanite cells will adapt

568
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,102
to their changing circumstances.

569
00:30:10,605 --> 00:30:12,813
The mass will be able
to manipulate its own form

570
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,869
before it reaches critical density.

571
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:17,105
- Are you sure?
- I'm quite positive.

572
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:21,252
Once the nanites regain control, they
will be able to halt their own collapse.

573
00:30:21,442 --> 00:30:24,080
At that point,
they will be extremely dangerous.

574
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,535
In other words,
we're back to Godzilla.

575
00:30:28,157 --> 00:30:29,496
I may have a solution.

576
00:30:34,428 --> 00:30:37,237
We overload their ZPMs,
about half a dozen of them,

577
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:39,952
in a symmetrical pattern
around the Replicator mass.

578
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:43,012
The force of the explosion causes
the mass to compress even further,

579
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,035
essentially creating our own Replicator

580
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:47,734
fusion bomb. The whole planet
will be destroyed in the process.

581
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:49,695
You don't mess around, do you?

582
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:53,264
All this is based on information
provided by a Replicator?

583
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:54,918
We have no reason to trust it.

584
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,154
We're not trusting it,
we're trusting Rodney.

585
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:00,861
<i>This causes a slightly
new wrinkle to the plan.</i>

586
00:31:01,023 --> 00:31:02,702
I'll need to beam down to the core room.

587
00:31:02,822 --> 00:31:04,573
Along with Ronon and a squad of marines.

588
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:06,983
From there, I should be
able to hack into their system

589
00:31:07,103 --> 00:31:09,036
and set the ZPMs to overload.

590
00:31:09,198 --> 00:31:11,658
In the meantime,
we'll be keeping their ships occupied.

591
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:14,291
The seven hives will space themselves
around the planet equally

592
00:31:14,484 --> 00:31:16,621
and our smaller ships
will fill in the holes.

593
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:18,683
We could use you in my chair, Sheppard.

594
00:31:18,856 --> 00:31:20,787
We have an arsenal of drones,
but none of my guys

595
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:22,466
can fire them quite like you can.

596
00:31:25,364 --> 00:31:26,918
No place I'd rather be.

597
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,431
The hives will be dispatching
sizable waves

598
00:31:30,594 --> 00:31:33,918
of darts to target the Replicators'
hyperdrive engines.

599
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:35,367
My 302s will join you.

600
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:36,647
Very well.

601
00:31:36,944 --> 00:31:39,790
Now, while I'm working in the core room,
we'll beam Fran down to the city.

602
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,838
Wait a minute, Fran?

603
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:43,987
Friendly Replicator android.

604
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:47,515
I didn't realize
we were naming things.

605
00:31:48,027 --> 00:31:51,512
It noticed that Zelenka
and I both had names, and...

606
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:54,331
and she asked for one, so...

607
00:31:56,605 --> 00:31:58,409
All right, let's move out.

608
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:17,759
That's quite a sight.

609
00:32:18,524 --> 00:32:21,062
I remember when the Cold War ended
and we started doing joint missions

610
00:32:21,182 --> 00:32:22,800
with the Russians.

611
00:32:23,156 --> 00:32:25,616
I thought that was strange.

612
00:32:26,522 --> 00:32:29,283
I've got confirmation from the fleet.
We're ready to go.

613
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:31,735
Set coordinates
for the Replicator home world.

614
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:56,274
This is quite exciting, isn't it?

615
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,763
It's a bit nerve-wracking. Yeah.

616
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,646
I quite look forward to it.

617
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:03,492
You do?

618
00:33:03,612 --> 00:33:06,464
One always wishes
to fulfill one's purpose.

619
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,972
Right...

620
00:33:08,677 --> 00:33:10,454
And you're fine with all this?

621
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,673
Why would I not be?

622
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:13,851
It's my reason for being.

623
00:33:14,062 --> 00:33:15,546
Well, I know, I just that you...

624
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:18,281
- You're going to... cease to be.
- Yes?

625
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:21,728
I just imagine
you'd rather keep being than...

626
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:23,778
than not.

627
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:26,063
Certainly, you're not worried for me,

628
00:33:26,432 --> 00:33:29,134
- are you, Doctor?
- No, no. That would be silly.

629
00:33:29,835 --> 00:33:31,401
Yes, it would.

630
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:37,216
- We should never have given it speech.
- Yeah.

631
00:33:37,336 --> 00:33:39,334
Dr. McKay, we're approaching the target.

632
00:33:39,454 --> 00:33:41,521
You need to get
with Ronon and the marines.

633
00:33:42,284 --> 00:33:43,309
On my way.

634
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:45,450
Dr. McKay...

635
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,676
Yeah?

636
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,522
Good luck.

637
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:53,355
You too, Fran...

638
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:55,528
Good luck.

639
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:18,638
Target their hyperdrives with the beam
weapons and launch all 302s.

640
00:34:18,761 --> 00:34:22,479
Beam the Replicator and McKay's team
down to their separate coordinates.

641
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:35,708
Fan out. Fan out.

642
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:40,765
All right, we're clear.

643
00:34:41,966 --> 00:34:43,985
This won't take more than a minute.

644
00:34:58,592 --> 00:35:00,471
Power down in interior section.

645
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:03,395
Transferring power from non-critical
systems to hull regeneration.

646
00:35:09,163 --> 00:35:10,352
How's it coming, McKay?

647
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:12,348
<i>I don't want to be doing this all day.</i>

648
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,441
I'm done.

649
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:15,418
I've got total control
over the power grid

650
00:35:15,538 --> 00:35:17,268
and the ZPMs,

651
00:35:17,418 --> 00:35:19,059
and Fran is...

652
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:20,972
Fran is just about to activate.

653
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:26,584
Hello.

654
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:49,846
It's working... Just hold
those ships off a little longer...

655
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,746
I don't know how much longer
we can keep this up.

656
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:12,111
We just have to keep them busy. I don't
think they realize what's happening yet.

657
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:23,155
One of the Replicator ships is heading
towards us at maximum sublight.

658
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:24,895
They're powering their hyperdrives.

659
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:26,888
Sheppard... Do you see that?

660
00:36:27,038 --> 00:36:28,446
Yeah. I got it.

661
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,681
It's working much faster
than I ever imagined...

662
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:48,496
When's it gonna be big enough
to pull them down from orbit?

663
00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:50,232
Soon. Really soon.

664
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:54,179
Our shields can't take
much more of this, Sir.

665
00:36:54,376 --> 00:36:55,837
Hopefully, they won't have to.

666
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,744
Get ready to transfer power
from the beam weapons to the...

667
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:12,297
What the hell...

668
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,155
Son of a bitch...

669
00:37:15,386 --> 00:37:16,739
He actually did it.

670
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:30,410
- What's happening?
<i>- The Replicator mass...</i>

671
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:33,332
It's so heavy,
it's sinking into the planet surface.

672
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:35,655
McKay, according to our readings,

673
00:37:35,778 --> 00:37:38,402
every Replicator nanite
is now part of the mass.

674
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:40,726
- Can you confirm?
- <i>Copy that, Sam.</i>

675
00:37:40,944 --> 00:37:42,854
I'll set the countdown and...

676
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,151
Did you do that?

677
00:37:45,342 --> 00:37:46,277
No...

678
00:37:48,171 --> 00:37:49,559
It's the mass.

679
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:52,400
It's collapsed the subterranean
power grid... It's a black out.

680
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:55,750
We won't be able to overload the ZPMs.

681
00:38:05,726 --> 00:38:07,400
Not good. Not good. Not good.

682
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,198
<i>Do you want me to beam and help you?</i>

683
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:12,197
The power grid has been destroyed,
there's nothing either of us can do.

684
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:14,596
What's the big deal?
You can't overload ZPMs.

685
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:17,221
Why don't we just send some nukes
down there and get this over with?

686
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:18,547
<i>Not that simple as that!</i>

687
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:20,852
Look, in order to implode
a mass this large,

688
00:38:20,975 --> 00:38:23,034
the explosion has to be timed
down to the nano second

689
00:38:23,154 --> 00:38:25,984
The force needs to be exactly right...
You can't fire a few nukes down here

690
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:27,541
and get the job done.

691
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:30,226
<i>Well, it's gotta be better than nothing.</i>

692
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,805
I have to agree.

693
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:34,275
McKay, my sensors indicate
that the ground around the mass

694
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:36,683
- is rich with neutronium.
- Neutronium?

695
00:38:36,803 --> 00:38:38,689
<i>It's the base raw material
of Replicator cells.</i>

696
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:42,642
It makes sense why the Ancients would
set up on a planet where it's abundant.

697
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:45,806
This could be very useful.
Neutronium is incredibly dense.

698
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,514
And that helps us how?

699
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:49,530
<i>Sam, we are geniuses!</i>

700
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:52,263
The mass is so super heavy that
it's sinking into the planet's surface,

701
00:38:52,386 --> 00:38:54,313
but if I dial it up, just a little bit,

702
00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:57,595
<i>it'll attract the neutronium
and sink all the way to the core.</i>

703
00:38:57,746 --> 00:39:00,411
And the planet will exert enough
pressure on it to cause an implosion.

704
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:05,451
Just give me one more...

705
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:07,758
Got it!

706
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:21,308
- We need to get out of here.
- All right, let's go, come on!

707
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:34,572
As much as I'd love to, we shouldn't
stick around to watch this go down.

708
00:39:34,736 --> 00:39:37,268
We should tell the fleet to jump
to the rendez-vous point immediately.

709
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:39,328
The planet's become unstable.

710
00:40:02,863 --> 00:40:04,503
<i>I'm sorry you lost a ship.</i>

711
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:07,578
- They knew what they were getting into.
- Yeah, but still.

712
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,806
You gonna stick around and
let my guys check this place out?

713
00:40:10,943 --> 00:40:13,936
They already gave us a head start
when they got us battle ready.

714
00:40:14,087 --> 00:40:15,316
Besides,

715
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:17,448
I have some things
that need to get taken care of.

716
00:40:17,571 --> 00:40:18,774
Yeah? Like?

717
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:22,219
Nothing for you to concern
your pretty little head with.

718
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:23,385
Look,

719
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:27,110
now that we're allies and stuff...

720
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:29,543
I should probably have some way

721
00:40:29,716 --> 00:40:31,415
of contacting you... you know,

722
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:33,137
for professional reasons...

723
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:35,543
in case we need help again.

724
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,594
I know where Atlantis is now...
Don't worry.

725
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,589
I'll stay in touch.

726
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:43,610
<i>Colonel Sheppard, are you ready to beam?</i>

727
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:45,797
Good seeing you again.

728
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:47,328
I bet it was.

729
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:52,892
Ready to beam.

730
00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:03,929
Welcome back.

731
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:05,310
Good to be back.

732
00:41:05,488 --> 00:41:07,442
How are our good friends, the Wraith?

733
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,588
They never showed up
at the rendezvous point.

734
00:41:10,419 --> 00:41:12,904
- They got caught in the explosion?
- I doubt it.

735
00:41:13,043 --> 00:41:15,612
I guess they just figured
there was nothing left to talk about,

736
00:41:15,749 --> 00:41:18,872
so, as soon as the planet blew up,
we were back to being enemies.

737
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,990
Wraith back to being enemies.

738
00:41:21,154 --> 00:41:23,543
Replicators don't exist anymore,
you out of your dry spell...

739
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,730
Hey...

740
00:41:24,906 --> 00:41:26,758
All is right with the world.

741
00:41:27,493 --> 00:41:29,994
- What are you working on anyway?
- You'll be surprised to hear that

742
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:32,423
removing a planet from the database
is actually a lot of work.

743
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:34,782
I thought you'd be
pretty good at that by now.

744
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,726
You can't resist
bringing up the fact that

745
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:38,909
I once accidentally destroyed
a couple of planets?

746
00:41:39,086 --> 00:41:40,542
It was an entire solar system.

747
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:44,093
- You want to do the honors?
- No, you go ahead.

748
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:47,239
All right, M7R-227,

749
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,978
you were a constant pain in the ass.

750
00:41:49,189 --> 00:41:50,788
It's good to see you go.

751
00:41:53,827 --> 00:41:56,718
- If only it was that easy in real life.
- Area 51 is working on it.

752
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,186
- You wanna get late dinner?
- Absolutely.

753
00:41:59,322 --> 00:42:00,211
All right.

754
00:42:00,348 --> 00:42:02,972
I would have loved to have seen
Ellis' face when my plan worked.

755
00:42:03,095 --> 00:42:04,489
Such a tool.

756
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:06,223
- I like him.
- You do?

757
00:42:06,346 --> 00:42:08,369
Yeah. Good guy,
excellent judge of character.

758
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:09,681
Oh, I see...

759
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:13,686
<i>I see where you're going with that.</i>

760
00:42:30,269 --> 00:42:31,417
Our intel was correct.

761
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:33,677
The planet has been
completely destroyed.

762
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:36,265
<i>Can you detect
any trace Replicator cells?</i>

763
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:39,382
Negative...
They've been completely wiped out.

764
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:41,623
Good.

765
00:42:42,442 --> 00:42:45,790
We can finally get to work without
having to look over our shoulders.

766
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,726
It's time to begin.
