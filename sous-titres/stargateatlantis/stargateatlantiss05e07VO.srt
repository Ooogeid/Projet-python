1
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:06,901
I told you

2
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:08,467
We should have started back sooner.

3
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,767
If we'd left when you had said,

4
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:12,967
We'd be returning home empty handed.

5
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:14,867
Why are we stopping?

6
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:17,667
I saw someone.

7
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,500
Hello?

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,400
There's nobody there.

9
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:27,034
Hello?

10
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:37,001
Are you all right, friend?

11
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:47,533
Are you lost?

12
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:38,068
ONE YEAR LATER

13
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,268
Signal's getting stronger.

14
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:49,467
Hey. what's this?

15
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:57,301
It's freakin' creepy, is what that is.

16
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:59,567
We found something!

17
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:13,567
I think we'd better contact atlantis.

18
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:19,767
I can't believe you're leaving.

19
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:21,533
I mean, you're sick, we cure you,

20
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,234
You go away for six months to recover.

21
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:24,400
You finally come back,

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,467
And now, what, you're here a week,

23
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:26,901
You're leaving again?

24
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:28,167
I'm sorry, rodney, but, for the time being,

25
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,700
I've realized that my place isn't here.

26
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,101
What? of course it is. what are you, kidding me?

27
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:33,500
As a doctor, I can't just sit by and do nothing

28
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,101
While people in this galaxy are suffering,

29
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:36,368
Especially when I know

30
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:37,600
I've had a hand in what's happened to them.

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,967
You cannot blame yourself, all right?

32
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:41,634
Look, michael forced you to help him.

33
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:43,567
He was the one disseminating the drug.

34
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:46,967
Aye, and I'm the one who helped the hoffans perfect it.

35
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:47,967
Colonel.

36
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,700
Just in time to give us a hand.

37
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,667
Actually, doc,

38
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,967
You'll have to delay your travel plans.

39
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:54,334
We just got word from major teldy.

40
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:56,934
They found another one of michael's labs.

41
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,100
I wish you'd told me We'd be doing so much walking.

42
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,301
Did I forget to mention that?

43
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,334
Aye, you did.

44
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:09,467
You also forgot to mention

45
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,401
The fact that we'd be rappelling down the side of a mountain.

46
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:12,334
My legs are seizing up.

47
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:13,800
Oh, that's what happens

48
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,167
When you do nothing for six months of r & r.

49
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,534
Not to mention two months in a stasis pod, thank you.

50
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:18,401
Two months?

51
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,601
Try 800 years.

52
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:21,234
That'll give you rubber legs.

53
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:22,301
Colonel.

54
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:33,267
Major teldy,

55
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,434
Dr. beckett.

56
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:36,000
Dr. beckett,

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,234
Major.

58
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:39,967
This is sergeant mehra, dr. porter,

59
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,768
And of course, you've already met captain vega.

60
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:44,100
I didn't realize you, uh--

61
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,668
That my team was a bunch of girls, sir?

62
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:51,267
That's not what I was going to say.

63
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,401
But, you know, now that you mention it...

64
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:57,601
Well, I was told to pick the best and the brightest.

65
00:04:57,601 --> 00:05:00,200
Funny how that worked out.

66
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,601
Funny.

67
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,967
Shall we?

68
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,467
Aye. yes.

69
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:29,668
We were passing through the area

70
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:33,067
When we picked up a low-level energy signature.

71
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:37,100
We were able to triangulate and get a lock on the signal,

72
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,867
And then follow it down into these catacombs.

73
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,734
It's a bit of a walk.

74
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:47,100
The signal finally led us to this.

75
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:53,334
Stasis pods.

76
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:56,534
I spent some time in a number of michael's labs

77
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:58,200
When I was his prisoner,

78
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,734
But this is one I'm not familiar with.

79
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:02,833
Well, looks like the cleaning crew

80
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,167
Hasn't been around in a while.

81
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,100
Hey, sarge.

82
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,900
Sorry, colonel.

83
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,501
And can we hold off touching stuff here?

84
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:15,967
Last thing I need

85
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,734
Is another three tons of rubble falling on my head, all right?

86
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:20,134
It's all right.

87
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:22,334
I've disabled the security protocols.

88
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:24,301
You can do that?

89
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,200
Oh yeah.

90
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,900
Why the hell didn't mckay think of that?

91
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,401
There was no way for him to have known.

92
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:31,067
But thanks to the information that he gathered

93
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,234
From that experience,

94
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:35,067
I'm able to bypass the security protocols this time.

95
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,467
What have you got?

96
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:38,867
Well, data related

97
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:39,867
To michael's experiments in this lab--

98
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:43,668
This could prove to be very valuable.

99
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:44,768
Going through all of this information

100
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:46,434
May take a while, though.

101
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:47,701
Oh, aye.

102
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:49,200
Maybe we should go check out the village.

103
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,534
What village?

104
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:52,200
We spotted it this morning.

105
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,100
It's just a few clicks south of here.

106
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,301
The locals might have some information.

107
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:57,467
Well, I guess that beats

108
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,067
Sitting around here watching these guys read.

109
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:02,534
Sergeant, you're with them.

110
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:05,067
Make sure they don't geek out too much, All right?

111
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,567
Nice work, doctor.

112
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,367
Thank you.

113
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:13,900
Very nice.

114
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:19,234
You know what I'd love right about now?

115
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:22,034
Let me guess. a beer?

116
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,601
A puddle jumper.

117
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:24,867
That could've been arranged

118
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:27,167
Had I'd known we'd be walking for so long.

119
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:29,668
Yeah, well, the area's too heavily forested.

120
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:30,967
There's nowhere to land.

121
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,668
Besides, this is good exercise.

122
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:34,467
It firms up your glutes and calves.

123
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,534
Great. couple of more hours of this,

124
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:40,100
I can skip my cardio-funk workout.

125
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:51,933
Are they alive?

126
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:54,768
They're in stasis...

127
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,401
Their physical and chemical processes

128
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,534
Have been suspended,

129
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:01,467
But yes, they're alive.

130
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,768
So can you wake 'em up?

131
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:05,701
Well, without the proper understanding

132
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:07,334
Of their respective conditions,

133
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:09,668
I'm afraid that might kill them.

134
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:11,401
Hmm. so you're just going to keep them on ice

135
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:13,134
Until you figure something out, huh?

136
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:17,167
I guess it doesn't matter to them or their families

137
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,501
Who've probably written them off.

138
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:22,900
But boy, would that make for one hell of a reunion, huh?

139
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:28,668
I think I'm going to check the perimeter.

140
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:29,900
Holler if you need me.

141
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,334
You have no need to apologize,

143
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:42,933
And, frankly, neither does she.

144
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,234
She's right.

145
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:47,501
Resurrections make for very interesting reunions,

146
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:50,034
Especially when the dead man had no idea he was dead

147
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:52,034
To begin with.

148
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,167
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,334
How about you, dr. porter?

150
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,134
Oh. alison.

151
00:08:58,134 --> 00:09:01,267
Alison.

152
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:04,334
Any interesting experiences you'd like to share?

153
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:08,134
Encountered any dangerous predators

154
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:09,634
Been cloned lately?

155
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:13,434
No, but in all fairness, I am new to the pegasus galaxy.

156
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:16,301
And I hear that cloning is more of a second-year thing.

157
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:17,134
Third, actually.

158
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:20,467
Oh, hang on.

159
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:22,701
What is it?

160
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,591
It appears to be michael's earliest version

161
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:26,427
of a human-iratus hybrid.

162
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:31,734
Hello?

163
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:35,668
Anyone here?

164
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:41,401
All right, let's split up,

165
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:42,267
Take a look around.

166
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:43,967
Maintain radio contact.

167
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:45,567
Yes, sir.

168
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,634
Vega, you got anything?

169
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:20,081
Nothing on this end.

170
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:22,525
It looks like the locals cleared out a while ago.

171
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:24,501
Yeah. the question's why.

172
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,000
Incredible.

173
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:34,007
According to this, These earliest test subjects

174
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:36,640
weren't technically human-iratus hybrids.

175
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:39,434
They were a combination of several other lifeforms.

176
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:45,830
Maybe that's why he discontinued this line of research.

177
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:48,434
It proved overly ambitious.

178
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:49,800
Well, no.

179
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,534
According to this, the experiment was a success.

180
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:55,534
So... what does that mean?

181
00:10:55,534 --> 00:11:00,734
Well, it means there's nothing we can do for them,

182
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:06,681
Because these things in here aren't people anymore.

183
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:15,100
Sorry.

184
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,267
I didn't mean to startle you.

185
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:17,601
I just wanted to let you know

186
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:19,234
It's going to get dark soon.

187
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:21,567
So are we going to make this thing an all-nighter,

188
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:23,200
Or...?

189
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,900
No, sergeant.

190
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,634
Easy.

191
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:44,800
Who are you?

192
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,067
Where do you come from?

193
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:48,567
Well, we came through that big round thing.

194
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:49,734
We're explorers.

195
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:50,668
Who are you?

196
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,967
My name is mirellus.

197
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:54,234
Well, mirellus,

198
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:55,601
Why don't you tell us what happened here?

199
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:56,768
Where is everyone?

200
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:57,768
Gone.

201
00:11:57,768 --> 00:11:59,167
Why?

202
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:02,467
It began about a year and a half ago.

203
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,867
Locals started disappearing--

204
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:06,134
From the surrounding forest at first,

205
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:08,601
And then from within the village itself.

206
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:09,501
Day,

207
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:10,501
Night,

208
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:13,434
They vanished without a trace.

209
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,134
There was no reason for what was happening,

210
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,301
No explanation except one--

211
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:21,933
This village was cursed, and so we abandoned it.

212
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:22,933
Then why are you still here?

213
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:26,100
I now live in the next village.

214
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,701
I spotted you exiting the caves.

215
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:29,933
I followed you to find out what you were doing here

216
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:30,768
And, if necessary,

217
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:33,301
To warn you.

218
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:35,467
What can you tell us about those caves?

219
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:38,601
They're also rumored to be a dangerous place,

220
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:40,505
Although the fact That you survived the visit

221
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:41,555
would suggest otherwise.

222
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:43,800
What did you find there?

223
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,567
Colonel sheppard, do you copy?

224
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,200
Don't tell me you're already done, beckett.

225
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,534
Oh, no. far from it.

226
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,933
We've downloaded some information to our tablets.

227
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:51,768
We'd like to go over it this evening.

228
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:53,134
Ideally, we'd like to stick around,

229
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:55,034
Possibly bed down in the village if there's room for us.

230
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:56,768
Yeah, well, I think there's a little room here,

231
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:57,867
Yeah.

232
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:58,867
Great. we're headed your way, then.

233
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:00,234
Sorry about that.

234
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,289
I wish you luck,If you're planning to stay.

235
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:02,670
Whoa, whoa.

236
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:04,603
We're not finished with this conversation.

237
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,401
Night is falling and this isn't a safe place.

238
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,167
I must go.

239
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:12,167
All right, suit yourself.

240
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,467
So, sergeant,

241
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:23,095
I hear you served with stargate command before transferring over.

242
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:24,401
Yeah,

243
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,467
But pegasus had more of what I was looking for.

244
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:27,301
And what was that?

245
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:29,067
Bad guys who need killin'.

246
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:31,626
The milky way just hasn't been the same,

247
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:33,280
since the ori got their butts kicked.

248
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:34,734
Well, some would argue

249
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:36,900
That the situation has actually improved--

250
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:41,267
What is it?

251
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,334
I thought I heard something.

252
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:45,367
What?

253
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:55,067
It's probably nothing.

254
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,867
Jeez.

255
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:17,467
All right, we're going over to the next village

256
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:18,800
To talk to some locals.

257
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,634
You guys need anything?

258
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:20,668
Want anything?

259
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:21,900
Yeah, if you happen to pass a starbucks,

260
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,900
I'll take a grande triple sugar-free vanilla latte.

261
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,301
No problem. sarge?

262
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,067
I'm babysitting. yes, sir.

263
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:30,867
Be back in a couple of hours.

264
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,034
I feel like I'm back in college

265
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,234
Studying for my mid-terms.

266
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:05,667
I know what you mean.

267
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,234
Where was that, then?

268
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:08,767
Cal tech.

269
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:09,967
Go beavers.

270
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:11,567
Aye.

271
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:13,600
What year did you graduate?

273
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:19,101
Oh, thank you.

274
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:25,967
I just read something funny.

275
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:29,001
And really obvious.

276
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:33,801
Anyway...

277
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:37,467
What brings you here to the pegasus galaxy?

278
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:40,134
Well, you can just chalk that up to my sense of adventure.

279
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:44,101
A desire to visit strange, unexplored worlds,

280
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:45,967
Meet new and interesting people.

281
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,067
Okay, I'm going to go check the perimeter.

282
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,168
Be back in 20.

283
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:59,101
Unless there's a sock on the doorknob.

284
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:06,333
She's a character, that one.

285
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,034
Yeah.

286
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:14,867
This fog sure rolled in quickly.

287
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:18,168
Vega, are you sure we're heading in the right direction?

288
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:19,934
More or less.

289
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:22,300
Oh, dammit!

290
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,667
Oh, great. mine too.

291
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,400
So, the fog's messing with the lights.

292
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,067
Makes you wonder what we're walking through.

293
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,867
Or breathing.

294
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,234
What's the matter?

295
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:37,234
I think I saw something.

296
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:41,433
What?

297
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,433
Okay. I definitely saw something that time.

298
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:43,101
Damn.

299
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:04,268
Creepy.

300
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,934
It's probably just some animal.

301
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,600
Just some animal that seems to be stalking us?

302
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,634
What a relief.

303
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,734
Quiet. I heard something--

304
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:27,101
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! easy, mirellus.

305
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,034
What's going on?

306
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:28,934
Demons!

307
00:18:28,934 --> 00:18:30,067
What are you talking about?

308
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,534
They're out there, in the mist.

309
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:32,867
Demons? right.

310
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:34,433
They're after me.

311
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:35,534
All of us are in danger.

312
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:36,700
Take it easy.

313
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,934
With all due respect,

314
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:39,867
We're not buying any of this, are we?

315
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:40,867
Stay sharp, vega.

316
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:45,201
Well, let's get back to atlantis before the--

317
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:49,034
Vega!

318
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:51,034
Vega?

319
00:18:58,134 --> 00:19:00,801
Crap.

320
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:26,600
Fall back!

321
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,821
I'm really glad That we got this opportunity

322
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:41,315
to work together, carson.

323
00:19:42,234 --> 00:19:45,333
So am i, alison.

324
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:49,201
What was that?

325
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:50,101
I don't know.

326
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:54,134
Colonel, is everything all right?

327
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:55,467
Colonel, do you read? colonel!

328
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:56,901
I'm getting nothing on the radio.

329
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:57,901
Get back inside. I'll check it out.

330
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:58,901
I'm coming with you.

331
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:00,500
Like hell you are.

332
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,734
I'm not going to let you go out there by yourself!

333
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,101
The colonel told me to take care of you,

334
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,367
That is exactly what I'm doing.

335
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:05,667
You two are staying here,

336
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,467
As far away from that gunfire as possible.

337
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,234
Now you get inside and lock the door.

338
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:09,867
You can't tell me to--

339
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:10,934
That is an order.

340
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,433
Carson?

341
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:13,600
Come on.

342
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Come on.

343
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:29,101
I'm sorry.

344
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:30,168
I didn't know.

345
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:32,500
What are you talking about?

346
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,934
Oh, my god.

347
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:45,234
The pods have been opened.

348
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:50,833
It was me.

349
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,401
I released them.

350
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,000
Why?

351
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,434
When you asked about the caves,

352
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,267
I knew you had found something.

353
00:20:57,267 --> 00:20:59,100
I came to see for myself.

354
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,334
Why?

355
00:21:00,334 --> 00:21:03,234
Because my wife was among the missing.

356
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:05,301
When I saw the bodies sealed

357
00:21:05,301 --> 00:21:06,601
In those things,

358
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:08,768
I thought that maybe...

359
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,200
I didn't know.

360
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,267
I thought that I could save her.

361
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:14,833
12 pods...

362
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,933
That means 12 of those things running around out there.

363
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:20,401
Minus the one you took out, that leaves us with 11.

364
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:23,833
Beckett? dr. porter?

365
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,601
It must be the mist.

366
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:27,867
It's messing with our flashlights,

367
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:29,067
Probably radios, too.

368
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:30,933
How're your wraith language skills?

369
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:32,234
I'm guessing about as good as yours.

370
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:34,701
We need beckett and dr. porter here.

371
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:36,768
Let's go get 'em.

372
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:38,167
But the demons are still out there.

373
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:40,434
We'll be back for you.

374
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:47,768
Wait!

375
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:50,768
It's getting pretty foggy out there.

376
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:58,434
I shouldn't have let her go out there by herself.

377
00:21:58,434 --> 00:21:59,833
You were under orders.

378
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,367
I should have insisted.

379
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:03,134
And she probably would've decked you.

380
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:04,434
You don't know dusty.

381
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:08,000
What the hell was that?

382
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,434
Maybe she's back.

383
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:14,867
Sergeant?

384
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:18,200
Sergeant, is that you?

385
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,967
Dammit.

386
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,367
What are you doing?

387
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:25,701
I'm going out there.

388
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:28,134
Dusty told us to stay inside.

389
00:22:28,134 --> 00:22:30,200
Look, it's probably nothing,

390
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,668
But just in case it's someone...

391
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:33,668
I'd like to surprise them

392
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:35,833
Instead of the other way around.

393
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:39,334
Look, alison.

394
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:41,833
I'll be fine. you just stay put.

395
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,100
Okay?

396
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,334
All right.

397
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,900
Sergeant?

398
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:27,301
Sergeant mehra?

399
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:42,067
Dear lord...

400
00:24:57,734 --> 00:24:59,234
Come on!

401
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:00,401
Thank you, sergeant.

402
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:02,034
Move it, move it, go!

403
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,467
What the hell was that?

404
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,067
Where's alison?

405
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:09,833
What were those things?

406
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:11,833
Lower your voice.

407
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:14,501
I think those creatures hunt by sound.

408
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:26,833
Oh, god.

409
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,967
Judging from that,

410
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:30,334
I'm guessing you already know what's going on?

411
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:31,434
Where's the captain?

412
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:33,668
She's gone.

413
00:25:33,668 --> 00:25:35,200
Where's porter?

414
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,534
We don't know.

415
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,567
Oh, that's great.

416
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:38,933
All we need now

417
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:40,501
Is for the prom queen and the kid in the wheelchair

418
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:42,134
To wander off and we're all set.

419
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:43,200
We have to find her.

420
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,401
She has no idea what's out there.

421
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:46,000
What the hell is out there?

422
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,334
Michael's experiments.

423
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:49,334
Yeah, I think we figured that one out.

424
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:51,701
It's an early version of the hybrid

425
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:53,701
That's been genetically altered to incorporate

426
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:57,000
The predatory characteristics of several other creatures.

427
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,100
What other creatures?

428
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,634
I'm not sure.

429
00:25:59,634 --> 00:26:00,967
All I know for certain

430
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:02,900
Is that they're blind and they hunt by sound.

431
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,034
And that fog out there,

432
00:26:04,034 --> 00:26:06,567
It's not a natural weather phenomenon.

433
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:10,534
I saw one of them exude the mist from the gills in its neck.

434
00:26:10,534 --> 00:26:12,867
What, like a squid releasing its ink?

435
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:14,867
Except that's a defensive mechanism.

436
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:16,800
These creatures clearly use the fog

437
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,467
As a predatory device.

438
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,467
which i think can explain the gas mask back in the lab

439
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:22,800
God knows

440
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,900
What prolonged exposure to this mist could do to us.

441
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
I got a great idea.

442
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,734
Let's not find out.

443
00:26:27,734 --> 00:26:29,800
We should wait here until dawn. then it will be safe.

444
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,234
Those things out there are not nocturnal.

445
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:34,567
Day or night, doesn't matter.

446
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:36,200
Besides, we can't sit around. we got to find porter.

447
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,668
You can't be serious?

448
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:38,933
You're going out there?

449
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:40,234
Get back to work on that data.

450
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:42,200
Try to figure out a way to deal with those things.

451
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,100
That might be a problem, colonel.

452
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,867
There's a reason michael abandoned that research...

453
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:50,833
Even he couldn't control those creatures.

454
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,867
Great.

455
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,768
All right, you sure you'll be okay here?

456
00:27:08,768 --> 00:27:10,301
As long as we're quiet,

457
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:13,134
We'll be safer in here than you are out there.

458
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:17,567
All right, we'll split up to cover more ground.

459
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:22,100
Back in 20.

460
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
Good luck.

461
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,000
Whatever you do, be quiet.

462
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:26,534
This was a mistake.

463
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:28,067
Keep your voice down.

464
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,351
I told them it was too dangerous!

465
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,453
Shh! quiet.

466
00:29:30,453 --> 00:29:31,225
Instead of coming back here,

467
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:32,384
We should have gone to the next village.

468
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:33,768
We'd be safe there!

469
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:34,668
Shut it!

470
00:29:34,668 --> 00:29:36,501
Now we've put all of our--

471
00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:43,200
Ali, you okay?

472
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,467
Yeah.

473
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,000
Let's head out.

474
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:05,434
Colonel.

475
00:31:05,434 --> 00:31:07,234
It's major teldy.

476
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:09,668
She doesn't see us.

477
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,367
Take the six.

478
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:36,367
All right.

479
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:54,867
I thought you were dead.

480
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:56,467
Yeah, for a while there, so did i.

481
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:57,501
What about the others?

482
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:59,567
Think they made it out?

483
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:02,000
Well, I'm guessing at least one of them didn't.

484
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,668
We got blood.

485
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:05,967
Carson?

486
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:10,701
No way to know.

487
00:32:19,668 --> 00:32:22,534
One of those things came crawling right up out of the well.

488
00:32:22,534 --> 00:32:24,367
It got me thinking.

489
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:26,200
Those catacombs,

490
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,800
They run for miles in every direction.

491
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,467
I'm guessing that one of them runs right to that well

492
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,100
And into the center of town.

493
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,501
That would explain how michael could

494
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:37,100
Snag his test subjects without being seen.

495
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,501
All right, well,

496
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:41,000
We saw 12 of those pods in the lab.

497
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,301
I killed one back in the forest, so--

498
00:32:42,301 --> 00:32:44,467
I tagged two--

499
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:47,000
Which, incidentally, puts me in the lead.

500
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,634
All right, well,

501
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,234
That brings us down to nine.

502
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:53,301
Okay, so, now what?

503
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:56,134
Any ideas?

504
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,067
Well, those creatures

505
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:01,701
Possess a heightened auditory system

506
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:03,634
That allows them to hunt blind.

507
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:05,467
We could try exploiting it.

508
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:06,467
How?

509
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:07,634
I don't know,

510
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:09,567
Maybe luring them into an ambush?

511
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:12,668
What the hell do you plan on using as bait?

512
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,634
This.

513
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,867
All right, here's how it's going to work.

514
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:27,467
While you three are taking up high-ground positions--

515
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:32,100
Teldy and porter here, mehra over here--

516
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm going to be on the ground, setting charges.

517
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,534
You're going to blow the well?

518
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:36,900
Yeah, that's the plan.

519
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,634
Okay, well, you better use a timer.

520
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:40,768
If the fog is messing with our radios and flashlights,

521
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,833
Chances are the remote detonator won't work either.

522
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:45,301
All right, once I get to the well,

523
00:33:45,301 --> 00:33:46,867
I'll turn on the computer.

524
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:50,601
Well, I've programmed it to emit an ultrasonic burst

525
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:51,933
So that'll draw them right to you.

526
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:53,433
But remember, if it gets near the fog--

527
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:54,367
I'll put it halfway down.

528
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:55,700
That should keep it out of reach

529
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,601
And working long enough to attract all nine.

530
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:59,500
You three, take a position,

531
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,700
Sit tight until you hear a signal,

532
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,867
Then open up on anything that moves.

533
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:06,100
And what's the signal?

534
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,701
That would be the well blowing sky high.

535
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:09,800
And where will you be?

536
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,100
Well, hopefully as far away as possible.

537
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,267
What if this goes sideways?

538
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:17,167
Don't be so negative, teldy.

539
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:18,367
I'm serious, colonel.

540
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:20,134
You take up positions, you sit tight,

541
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:21,867
And wait for the signal-- you don't move,

542
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:24,067
You don't make a noise until the well blows.

543
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:25,334
Colonel, what--

544
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:27,334
I think I've made myself clear, sergeant.

545
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:28,633
Yes, sir.

546
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,401
Do we all know what we're doing?

547
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:33,567
Yes, sir.

548
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:34,668
Sir.

549
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:36,134
Let's go.

550
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:22,167
What the hell's going on down there?

551
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:29,101
Not yet.

552
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:30,767
Dammit.

553
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:33,434
Just wait for it.

554
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:34,767
You all right?

555
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,733
Yeah.

556
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:38,034
Alison?

557
00:36:38,034 --> 00:36:40,700
She's, uh, she's safe.

558
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,401
Thank god.

559
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,967
What, did you lose something?

560
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:46,600
Yeah. my c4.

561
00:36:50,934 --> 00:36:54,934
Colonel, I think it's best that we get moving.

562
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,101
Yeah, I do too.

563
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:57,667
All right.

564
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:17,267
Come on, come on.

565
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:24,301
I see them!

566
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:26,333
You shoot now, you risk hitting the colonel.

567
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,234
Just wait for the signal.

568
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,568
Colonel?

569
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,600
Is that all of them?

570
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,834
Eight... nine...

571
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:13,434
Plus the other three, that makes 12.

572
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,967
Sorry, that's nine.

573
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,500
Plus the three, makes 12.

574
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,767
Right.

575
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:28,068
Major?

576
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:29,567
Colonel, where are you?

577
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:30,834
Down the well, in the catacombs.

578
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,501
I've got beckett.

579
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:35,100
I need you three to rappel down here and join us.

580
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,701
On our way.

581
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:44,934
I just want to get back to atlantis

582
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:46,234
And sleep for a week.

583
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:46,734
Aye, I know what you mean.

584
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:48,067
I promise this won't take long.

585
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,500
Alison, are you okay?

586
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,034
Um, yeah.

587
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:59,367
Hey, guys, do you mind if I just hang back here?

588
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,500
I've had enough mad science for one day.

589
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,200
Yeah, sure.

590
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,500
I'll keep her company.

591
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,834
We'll be quick.

592
00:39:22,701 --> 00:39:25,701
I want to make sure I get all the data on these creatures,

593
00:39:25,701 --> 00:39:27,834
Save a return trip.

594
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,068
What was that?

595
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:33,333
What?

596
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:36,233
I thought I heard something.

597
00:39:36,233 --> 00:39:38,367
Relax, okay?

598
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:39,734
There were 12 pods.

599
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:41,233
We counted 12 kills.

600
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:42,634
We got 'em all.

601
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:16,233
What is it?

602
00:40:31,634 --> 00:40:33,701
Oh, crap.

603
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:36,834
We didn't get them all.

604
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:51,934
It's nothing.

605
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,967
Porter? mehra?

606
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,001
If they overtake our position,

607
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:17,600
I want you two to fall back.

608
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,200
Take the second tunnel up, go to the surface,

609
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,300
Dial the gate.

610
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,801
Now who's being negative?

611
00:41:57,701 --> 00:41:59,200
All clear?

612
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,701
All clear.

613
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:17,000
I can't believe you're leaving already.

614
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,734
You've been here, like, less than two weeks.

615
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:20,200
Well, I've completed my research

616
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,501
Into michael's test subjects

617
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:23,801
And passed my findings on to dr. lynch and his team.

618
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:26,734
And now it's time to move on to the more important work of saving lives.

619
00:42:28,734 --> 00:42:29,801
Hey, doc.

620
00:42:29,801 --> 00:42:31,933
Maybe I spoke too soon.

621
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:34,867
Another off-world situation require my expertise?

622
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:37,634
Actually, just came to see if you needed some help.

623
00:42:37,634 --> 00:42:38,501
Oh, much appreciated.

624
00:42:38,701 --> 00:42:39,801
Oh, by the way, how's porter?

625
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:40,933
Who?

626
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,267
She's fine-- planning a couple weeks of r & r,

627
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:45,100
Then she'll be back in the pegasus galaxy.

628
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,367
You know, colonel, someone like her

629
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,434
Could be of real benefit to the type of work I'll be doing.

630
00:42:48,434 --> 00:42:49,434
I'll bet.

631
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:50,234
Who's porter?

632
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,734
Something you might want to mention to mr. woolsey.

633
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:54,000
Consider it done.

634
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,301
Fine, you know what?

635
00:42:55,301 --> 00:42:57,334
I don't even want to know. don't tell me.

636
00:42:57,334 --> 00:42:58,567
Okay, come on, tell me!
