1
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:20,541
Hey!

2
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:22,801
Is anyone there?

3
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,880
Look, I need some help in here!

4
00:00:37,183 --> 00:00:38,197
<i>All right...</i>

5
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:41,738
<i>look. I know you're probably panicking
right now, but there's no time for that.</i>

6
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:44,269
<i>You need to focus.
I'm sure you're wondering</i>

7
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:46,701
<i>who tied you to the desk.</i>

8
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,337
<i>Well, the truth is, it was you.</i>

9
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,337
<i>I mean, me.</i>

10
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:54,902
<i>I did it because
I needed you to get this message.</i>

11
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:58,214
<i>It would take too long to give you
the explanation, and you wouldn't</i>

12
00:00:58,294 --> 00:01:01,719
<i>remember it anyway so you're just going
to have to trust me on this. Now,</i>

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,519
<i>You'll find a knife taped
to the underside of your chair.</i>

14
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:08,366
<i>Find it, and cut yourself loose.</i>

15
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:13,975
<i>Now, I need you to listen.</i>

16
00:01:14,614 --> 00:01:18,100
<i>It is vitally important
that you find this woman.</i>

17
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:28,032
<i>I don't know where she is,
but you have to find her. She can help.</i>

18
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:32,095
<i>Check the mess hall, maybe they took her
to the brig, I don't know. Keep looking.</i>

19
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,950
<i>Don't worry about anything else.</i>

20
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:35,895
<i>And for God's sake, don't trust anyone.</i>

21
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:39,326
<i>Just find her and do it fast, because
if you don't, hundreds of people</i>

22
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:41,847
<i>are going to die. Including you.</i>

29
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,874
Katie!

30
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:03,545
Rodney!

31
00:03:03,738 --> 00:03:06,109
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- I heard you were back, and

32
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,594
- I hadn't seen you for a while, so...
- Yeah, I know.

33
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:10,553
We have this whole new mainland
to explore,

34
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,627
and I've been bringing
back samples all week.

35
00:03:12,707 --> 00:03:14,483
So I see. Anything interesting?

36
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:17,850
Well, it's all pretty similar
to what we found back on Lantia.

37
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,473
We found a few new species.

38
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,545
Oh, which reminds me,
I've got a surprise for you.

39
00:03:29,524 --> 00:03:31,874
I found this guy
hiding in some shrubbery.

40
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:34,080
What is that?

41
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:37,376
Well, it doesn't have a name yet
but I'm thinking of calling it...

42
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:40,479
Rodneyana Villosa.

43
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:42,089
After you.

44
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,242
Really?

45
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:46,464
- What... you can do that?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,280
Be careful.

47
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:51,491
The bristles will pierce skin.

48
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,024
Anyway, look, I wondered if I could...

49
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:58,170
you know, tear you away from all of this
long enough to have some lunch?

50
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:01,409
Oh, I would love to, but...

51
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:04,391
I think I'm coming down with something.

52
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:07,082
I have a headache,
and I've had a few dizzy spells,

53
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:09,098
so I was thinking of going down
to the infirmary.

54
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,631
Well, I'll come with you.

55
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:15,955
No, you don't have to do that.

56
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:18,218
I know how much you hate
being around sick people.

57
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:20,820
No, really, it's fine.

58
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:23,650
Oh, that is so sweet.

59
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,654
- Thanks.
- After you.

60
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,537
Dr. Brown...

61
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:37,462
I see you've brought
my number one patient.

62
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:40,509
What? Oh, no, we're not here
for me this time. I'm-I'm here for her.

63
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,474
Okay, well, what can I do for you?

64
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:45,781
Well, I've got this really bad headache
that won't go away, and

65
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:47,678
I feel kind of dizzy.

66
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:51,373
- When did you first notice it?
- Some time this morning. Why?

67
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:54,758
Well because you're the fourth person to
come in here with those exact symptoms

68
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:57,450
and the second person
from the botany department.

69
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:00,954
Gerald? Hey...

70
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:03,937
- Who's that?
- Gerald Baxter. He's on my team.

71
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,727
You've met him before.

72
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,132
He's got the bug collection?

73
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,577
Oh, sure, right, yeah. I remember now.

74
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:14,585
Well, I'm gonna need to take some blood.

75
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:16,350
- You, too, Doctor.
- What?

76
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:19,938
If there is something going around, you
might have been exposed to it as well.

77
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:21,666
Sorry.

78
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:26,872
Major Dorsey and his team
just returned from M6R-214.

79
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,659
They examined the debris field above
the planet and found the parts from one,

80
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:33,518
- possibly two, Replicator ships.
- It was just a matter of time before

81
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,806
the Wraith got organized
and started hitting back.

82
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:38,874
I suppose. They did
defeat the Ancients, after all.

83
00:05:39,057 --> 00:05:40,803
The Replicators may
look like the Ancients

84
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:44,133
and they may use the same technology but
they're gonna be tougher to put down.

85
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:45,644
<i>Colonel Carter, come in, please.</i>

86
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:48,170
Go ahead, Doctor.

87
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:49,946
<i>I've got a situation developing.</i>

88
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:53,026
<i>Be advised I've imposed a quarantine
on the entire infirmary level.</i>

89
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:55,805
<i>- What's going on?
- 11 patients</i>

90
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,600
<i>have shown up here in the last hour,</i>

91
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,065
complaining of headache and dizziness.
Eight of them are from the survey teams

92
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:04,106
- <i>that just got back from the mainland.</i>
- Any idea what's wrong with them?

93
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,981
I ran some blood tests and found
a bacteria I've never seen before. I'm

94
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:09,892
<i>checking it against
the Ancient database.</i>

95
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:11,288
What do you want us to do?

96
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:14,595
The first thing we need to do is isolate
everyone that went to the mainland

97
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,862
and have them report to Dr Neves
in the auxiliary med lab for testing.

98
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,332
<i>Will do. Keep us posted.</i>

99
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:23,150
More test results. You and I are
both infected. So's Dr. Mckay.

100
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:25,728
The good news is the most advanced case
is still only showing

101
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:27,310
mild, flu-like symptoms.

102
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,465
- Maybe it won't get worse than that.
- Yeah, let's hope so.

103
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:39,016
Hello?

104
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:56,371
Hey... hey, wake up.

105
00:06:58,107 --> 00:06:59,514
What are you doing here?

106
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,558
- I don't know.
- What are you doing?

107
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,594
You're not a soldier.

108
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:05,966
If you say so.

109
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:11,811
- You should come with me. It's safer.
- No, slow down. What's going on here?

110
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:14,866
It's the soldiers. They're after us.
If they catch us, they'll take us away.

111
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:17,080
Take us where? What soldiers?
What is this place?

112
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:19,758
- Shut up. The soldiers will hear us!
- What the hell's going on?

113
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:21,415
- Why can't I remember?
- <b>I don't know.</b>

114
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:23,125
- No one can.
- No one can?

115
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:26,219
- You've seen others?
- Yes, one or two others,

116
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:27,833
apart from the soldiers.

117
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:29,914
- What about her? Was she there?
- No.

118
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:32,057
I have to find her.

119
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,227
- Why?
- I don't know. It's important.

120
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,479
The soldiers probably
have her by now, okay?

121
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:38,511
- Well, can we ask them?
- Are you crazy?

122
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:40,781
If the soldiers see you,
they shoot you, take you away.

123
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,169
Again with the taking away.

124
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:44,859
- You should hide with me.
- I can't, I've to keep looking.

125
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:47,977
Fine, suit yourself. If you get
yourself killed, I don't care.

126
00:07:57,318 --> 00:07:59,587
It started suddenly, and then it just...

127
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:00,736
just stopped.

128
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:03,122
Okay, well, I appreciate you telling me.

129
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:04,643
Aren't you going to do anything?

130
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:06,917
To be honest,
I don't see how it's relevant.

131
00:08:06,998 --> 00:08:09,062
It's a new symptom.
I thought it might be important.

132
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:12,882
I don't see how a "tingling sensation in
your knees" relates to this condition,

133
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:15,339
especially since
you're the only one experiencing it.

134
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:16,676
Yeah, but, so far.

135
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,772
I'm just saying, we don't know
anything about this disease.

136
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:23,053
The best thing for you to do
right now is try to relax, okay,

137
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:24,605
and let me do my work.

138
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,698
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

139
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,115
What did Dr. Keller say?

140
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:46,532
She's going to...
take it into consideration.

141
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:49,636
Thanked me for my input and...
how you doing?

142
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:52,222
I'm okay.

143
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:55,911
Dr. Keller's got her team working pretty
hard. I'm sure they're trying a bunch

144
00:08:55,991 --> 00:08:59,084
of stuff. I'm sure they'll come up with
a way to beat this thing in no time.

145
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:03,947
Seriously, are you okay?

146
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:06,369
It's... my headache.

147
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:07,904
It's getting worse.

148
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:09,989
Is there anything I can do?

149
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,244
Could you...

150
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,160
ask the nurse to bring me some tea?

151
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,326
What's wrong with this one?

152
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:22,174
Right.

153
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:29,393
Marie? What's... what's going on?

154
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,725
I don't know. I just got really dizzy.

155
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:41,730
Are you telling us that the infection
has breached hazmat protocol?

156
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:43,398
<i>I'm not entirely sure.</i>

157
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:46,146
It's possible she could
have been previously exposed,

158
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:47,843
but that would mean it's already spread

159
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:50,930
much farther among
the general population than we thought.

160
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:53,513
I've got off-duty medical
personnel conducting random

161
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,525
<i>blood tests around the City
just to get a sense of where we're at.</i>

162
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:58,872
Have we confirmed it came
from the mainland?

163
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,920
The plant and soil samples brought back
by the botany department were negative,

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,420
but it still seems like
the most likely point of origin.

165
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:06,772
What about the database?

166
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:08,965
<i>I haven't found a match yet,
but I'm still looking.</i>

167
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:11,187
<i>There is one more thing.</i>

168
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:14,263
Since we have no idea
what this disease does,

169
00:10:14,343 --> 00:10:15,676
or how it's spread,

170
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:19,300
or even if our containment measures
are having any effect, I...

171
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,896
recommend we suspend
all Gate travel immediately.

172
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,063
Thank you, Doctor.

173
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:40,762
How you feeling?

174
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:43,958
I-I don't know.

175
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:47,779
They brought dinner. This salisbury
steak's actually quite good.

176
00:10:47,893 --> 00:10:51,382
And by the way, I asked Dr. Keller
about your friend, Dr. Baxter.

177
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:54,469
She says he's asleep,
but apparently the fever's down.

178
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:57,214
Who?

179
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:59,375
Dr. Baxter. That's his name, right,

180
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,800
the guy on your team?

181
00:11:05,862 --> 00:11:06,689
Where am I?

182
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:11,341
What do you mean? You're in the
infirmary. I brought you here, remember?

183
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:12,779
Who are you?

184
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,163
<i>Hold it right there.</i>

185
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:29,431
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I just...

186
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:37,482
Yeah, put him with the others.

187
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,341
- Go and get him out of here.
- Yes, Sir.

188
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:57,668
<i>What's the word?</i>

189
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:00,474
<i>Well, the random test results came back.</i>

190
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,869
<i>Six different people working
in six different areas of the City,</i>

191
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,046
<i>all positive.</i>

192
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:06,875
<i>That doesn't sound very promising.</i>

193
00:12:07,048 --> 00:12:10,211
It's either a statistical miracle,
or the entire base has been exposed.

194
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:13,177
<i>We're running more tests to confirm it,
but it doesn't look good.</i>

195
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:14,978
I don't know about you, but I feel fine.

196
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:16,778
Me too, and that's the problem.

197
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:19,188
If there is a delay
before the first symptoms appear,

198
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:22,391
it could've spread anywhere
before we even knew what was happening.

199
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:25,413
I've informed Stargate Command
that we're suspending Gate operations.

200
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:27,979
<i>- Colonel Carter, this is Dr. Keller.</i>
- Go ahead.

201
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:29,861
I'm sending you scans on Katie Brown,

202
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,700
as well as three other patients who are
beginning to show signs of amnesia.

203
00:12:33,924 --> 00:12:36,700
<i>All of them show
large concentrations of affected cells</i>

204
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,376
<i>in the medial temporal lobe.</i>

205
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:41,650
It looks like the bacteria is causing
these cells to produce a hormone

206
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:44,790
that interferes with the brain's ability
to access episodic memory.

207
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:47,040
How bad are we talking?

208
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:50,404
Rate of deterioration seems
to vary from patient to patient,

209
00:12:50,485 --> 00:12:53,504
but, in all cases,
it looks like it's progressive, meaning,

210
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:56,299
the longer they go without treatment,
the worse it gets.

211
00:12:57,435 --> 00:13:00,125
<i>Pretty soon, they won't be able
to remember their own names.</i>

212
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:03,381
You said the first symptoms
were headaches and dizziness.

213
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:04,610
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

214
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:07,685
How long after they appeared
before the first signs of memory loss?

215
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:09,668
Again, it seems to vary,

216
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:13,024
but you're looking at
an average of about six hours.

217
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:14,943
What about you, Doc, showing any signs?

218
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:17,862
Yeah, the headaches
started half an hour ago.

219
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:20,933
All right, keep searching the database.

220
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:23,057
It still think it's our best bet
to find a solution.

221
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:26,955
I'd love to, but if we're right about
these numbers, I'm about to get overrun

222
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:30,442
<i>with a lot of new patients.
It's already pretty crowded in here.</i>

223
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:32,043
Mess hall.

224
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:34,226
We can clear it out
and make a temporary ward.

225
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:35,904
That's a good idea. At the very least,

226
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:38,675
it'll consolidate everyone
in one place for treatment.

227
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:39,706
Do it.

228
00:13:57,473 --> 00:13:59,222
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

229
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,798
Where am I?

230
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:04,909
We were hoping you could tell us.

231
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:08,611
Who are all you people?

232
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:10,856
We don't know.

233
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:13,167
None of us can remember anything.

234
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,080
What's happening out there?
What did you see?

235
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,879
Nothing.

236
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:18,496
It was just...

237
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,375
empty hallways.

238
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,355
How did I get here?

239
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:24,369
<i>The soldiers brought you.</i>

240
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:25,929
Why?

241
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:28,077
They bring everyone here.

242
00:14:28,364 --> 00:14:30,250
<i>They say it's for our own protection.</i>

243
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:33,945
Don't waste your time. It won't open.

244
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:36,154
Why are they doing this to us?

245
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:37,949
Why can't anyone remember?

246
00:14:40,683 --> 00:14:41,486
My...

247
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,243
the computer.

248
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,096
- Where's my computer?
- It...

249
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,619
wasn't with you when
they brought you here. Why?

250
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,879
I have to find someone. It's a...

251
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:53,381
a woman.

252
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,558
Do you know who that is?

253
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:03,176
Does anyone here know Teyla?

254
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:06,819
<i>Anyone?</i>

255
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:12,343
I thought this City had some sort of

256
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:14,451
<i>automatic lockdown
to prevent stuff like this.</i>

257
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:15,535
It does.

258
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:16,968
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

259
00:15:17,485 --> 00:15:18,510
What happened?

260
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,996
You're asking me?

261
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:22,736
You got a headache?

262
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,877
I guess it was just a matter of time.

263
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:30,138
I'm fine.

264
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:34,204
How you feeling?

265
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,375
I am fine.

266
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:39,125
- Any symptoms?
- No, none yet.

267
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:40,835
Me neither.

268
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:44,204
What is it?

269
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,233
How do they know we're all infected?

270
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:49,545
My blood wasn't part
of the sample that was tested.

271
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,350
Nor was mine. Even so,
it is likely we were exposed.

272
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:55,069
So? Being exposed
doesn't mean you've got it.

273
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:57,801
Maybe it doesn't affect
everybody the same way,

274
00:15:57,881 --> 00:15:59,273
and all I know is I feel great.

275
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:01,662
So do I.

276
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,768
Perhaps you should make
Dr. Keller aware of this.

277
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:14,643
Excuse me.

278
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,297
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm a little busy right now.

279
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:24,929
I'm not sick.

280
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:28,124
If you're lucky enough
not to be exposed,

281
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:29,709
you just blew it by coming in here.

282
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,268
No, I know I've been exposed.

283
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:33,741
People I've been working with
all day have been getting sick,

284
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:36,155
but I'm not feeling anything.
Neither is teyla.

285
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,254
You think you might have
some kind of immunity?

286
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:39,360
You're the doctor.

287
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,242
I'm going to need
a sample of your blood.

288
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:43,756
Take as much as you need.

289
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:55,423
What are you doing?

290
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:57,179
I have to remember somehow.

291
00:16:57,385 --> 00:16:59,559
I already feel certain
things slipping away.

292
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:07,151
- All right, now what are you doing?
- Getting out of here.

293
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,463
All right, everyone!

294
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:09,634
<i>Listen up!</i>

295
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:12,595
I need to escape as quickly as possible.

296
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:15,600
- Does anyone know how I can do that?
- You can't just leave.

297
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:18,665
- Why not?
- What about the soldiers?

298
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,523
We're just going to have
to deal with them.

299
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:22,854
I'm sorry, call me crazy,
but I don't exactly trust them.

300
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:26,021
That doesn't mean we should be running
loose. We have no idea what's out there.

301
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:27,731
Look, something caused this to happen,

302
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:32,762
We're not gonna figure it out from in
here. Somewhere out there, there's a...

303
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:34,398
a woman that...

304
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:36,489
a woman named...

305
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:40,012
Right, thank you.

306
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:42,417
I think she knows something.

307
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:43,644
What?

308
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,326
I don't know.
We got to get out there and find out.

309
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:49,235
- I think we should listen to him.
- Why?

310
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,219
It makes sense.

311
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:54,555
<i>Why haven't the soldiers
told us what's happened?</i>

312
00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:57,583
Why haven't there been any
announcements, or any help on the way?

313
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:01,921
Maybe they don't know
any more than we do.

314
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:07,752
We need a plan.

315
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:11,879
They let you out?

316
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:15,435
The second set of random blood tests
just came back, all positive.

317
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:18,111
Didn't see much point in quarantining
the infirmary anymore.

318
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:19,660
You showing any signs?

319
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:21,801
- Headache?
- Yeah, same here.

320
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:24,840
Five bucks says you start
losing your memories first.

321
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:29,116
We've got food, water, and blankets.

322
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,733
We don't have enough beds,
but we're just gonna have to make do.

323
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:34,512
We may need to think about
ordering all non-essential personnel

324
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:38,118
to report to the mess hall. 
They're gonna wind up there anyways,

325
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:41,348
- we won't have people with no memories.
- That's what I'm worried about.

326
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:44,595
I'll send Lorne and a team out,
make sure those orders are followed.

327
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,221
These are from Dr. Neves.

328
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:48,995
They're stimulants.

329
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:51,450
He thinks they may slow
the effects of the memory loss.

330
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:52,850
It's just a stopgap, but

331
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,549
- at least it may buy us a few hours.
- Do we know what's in these?

332
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:57,668
- Because I'm allergic to a lot of...
- Take it.

333
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:00,360
Hand these out to Lorne and his men.

334
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:02,191
One more thing.

335
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:06,118
I've ordered Dr. Zelenka to remove
the Gate's main control crystal.

336
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:08,392
No matter what happens,
we cannot risk spreading

337
00:19:08,472 --> 00:19:10,902
this disease elsewhere
in the galaxy, or to Earth.

338
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,502
And what happens
when we all start losing our memory?

339
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:17,794
Dr. Keller will come up with
something before that happens.

340
00:19:24,472 --> 00:19:26,584
I thought we were moving
everyone to the mess hall.

341
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:30,778
He's our most advanced case. His vitals
are too unstable. What can I do for you?

342
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:32,768
I was just wondering
if you found anything.

343
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,913
What do you mean?

344
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,773
I'm not showing
any sign of the disease, remember?

345
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:41,819
Oh, well, it's possible you could have
some sort of natural immunity.

346
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,994
- Doc...
- Stay here.

347
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,722
I'm gonna take a sample of your blood...

348
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:47,800
Doc... you've already done that.

349
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:51,913
It's happening to me, isn't it?

350
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:54,647
Doctor, he's convulsing!

351
00:19:58,904 --> 00:19:59,913
Okay...

352
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:03,339
OK, give him... meda...
medazelam, four milligrams.

353
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,139
<i>He's in V-fib. I need a crash cart.</i>

354
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:11,357
Charge it to two hundred.

355
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:13,466
Clear.

356
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,430
Charge it to three hundred...

357
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:21,412
Clear.

358
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:35,542
<i>Go! Go!</i>

359
00:20:43,348 --> 00:20:44,348
This way!

360
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:57,278
All right, I think we're clear.

361
00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:00,060
Oh, thank God!
My lungs were about to give out!

362
00:21:00,974 --> 00:21:02,116
So, what next?

363
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,435
I don't know. How do we find her?

364
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:05,827
Who?

365
00:21:05,996 --> 00:21:08,413
Teyla. The one
we just risked our lives for.

366
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:10,144
Right, right.

367
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:11,802
I don't know.

368
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,291
All right, we'll just have to search
room by room. I mean,

369
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:17,778
how big could this place possibly be?

370
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:40,107
- Where are you taking us?
- I already told you. The mess hall.

371
00:21:40,204 --> 00:21:41,702
I don't want to go there.

372
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:44,282
Just relax. I know you're scared,

373
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:46,748
you just to have to trust me.
It's for your own good.

374
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:50,205
So much for coming quietly.

375
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,140
Hey...

376
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,709
mess hall's this way.

377
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:57,984
Right.

378
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:01,583
Don't look at me that way.

379
00:22:01,663 --> 00:22:03,620
It's easy to get turned
around in this place.

380
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:12,039
Major Lorne's picking up
some more stragglers.

381
00:22:12,237 --> 00:22:13,976
We're starting to get
a little resistance.

382
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:15,905
Yeah, they're starting
to lose their memories.

383
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:18,797
They can't understand why
there's a bunch of soldiers after them.

384
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:22,228
That's why I told him to take his men to
the armory and equip them with stunners.

385
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,748
I'm not sure I like the idea
of us shooting at our own people.

386
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:26,606
Well, we may not have a choice.

387
00:22:26,688 --> 00:22:28,034
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

388
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:31,682
Pretty soon, there's going to be
some panicked confused people out there.

389
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:33,579
Okay, carry on.

390
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:35,801
What?

391
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,693
Come with me.

392
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:50,250
You might want to go
easy on that stuff, Major.

393
00:22:50,332 --> 00:22:52,599
Sir, we need to delay this thing
as much as possible.

394
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,281
If we all go, there's no coming back.

395
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:55,492
Yeah, I know.

396
00:22:56,061 --> 00:22:58,726
That's what I want to talk
to you about. I got an idea.

397
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:02,723
- Didn't we come this way before?
- No.

398
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:04,058
Are you sure?

399
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:06,325
No.

400
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:08,600
I have an idea.

401
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,568
What are you doing?

402
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:16,087
If we come back here, we'll know
we've been this way before.

403
00:23:16,184 --> 00:23:17,758
Presuming of course that we remember

404
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,245
that we're the ones
who put it there in the first place.

405
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,496
I know you're out there.

406
00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:28,434
<i>Drop your weapons and come out slowly.</i>

407
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:41,019
Little guy with glasses.

408
00:23:43,498 --> 00:23:45,780
- What are you doing?
- Hey, I know him.

409
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,475
Don't shoot.

410
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,848
I don't have any weapons.

411
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:52,611
Who are you?

412
00:23:52,693 --> 00:23:54,683
We were captured
by the soldiers. We escaped.

413
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:56,721
Really?

414
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,044
Wait a second.

415
00:23:59,374 --> 00:24:00,503
What is that?

416
00:24:01,378 --> 00:24:02,977
- I found it.
- Let me see.

417
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:05,493
- What is it?
- I don't know, but...

418
00:24:05,573 --> 00:24:07,049
something tells me it's important.

419
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:08,198
Why?

420
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:09,491
I don't know.

421
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:20,581
Hey, how did you know to do that?

422
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:23,411
- I don't know. I just did.
- Well, that's her, Teyla.

423
00:24:23,618 --> 00:24:24,706
You know her?

424
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:27,893
Well, not exactly.

425
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,064
We're looking for her.
We think she can help us.

426
00:24:33,746 --> 00:24:35,190
It says, "find her."

427
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:38,055
How are we going to do that?

428
00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:46,254
This is what I wanted to show you.

429
00:24:46,656 --> 00:24:49,148
<i>This is the bacteria
that is causing our disease?</i>

430
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:51,809
Not exactly, but it's very similar.

431
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:53,824
And you found this in the database?

432
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:56,345
I stopped looking in the database.

433
00:24:57,026 --> 00:24:59,593
<i>I knew there was a reason why
Teyla and Ronon are the only people</i>

434
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,477
who've tested negative so far,

435
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:04,272
and we don't have a lot of information
on the Satedans, so I started

436
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:06,835
<i>looking through Dr. Beckett's records
on the Athosians.</i>

437
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:09,908
This is a blood sample
taken from a 10-year-old boy.

438
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:12,278
He was suffering
from something called...

439
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:16,884
I wrote it down.

440
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:18,592
Kirsan fever?

441
00:25:19,182 --> 00:25:20,329
Yeah, that's it.

442
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:24,273
It is a common childhood ailment
throughout the galaxy.

443
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:25,880
I had it when I was 8.

444
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:27,582
I had it when I was 10.

445
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:30,126
But this cannot be the same disease.

446
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:32,830
Kirsan fever does not affect adults,
nor does it cause memory loss.

447
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:35,426
Well, that may be true but...

448
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:38,282
the structure of the bacteria
is too similar to ignore.

449
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:40,188
They have to be related somehow.

450
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:42,074
Wait a minute.

451
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:43,856
Maybe they are the same.

452
00:25:43,995 --> 00:25:46,694
That would explain why the sensors
didn't identify it as a threat.

453
00:25:46,926 --> 00:25:48,941
- How is that possible?
- Well, think about it.

454
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,572
I mean, this planet didn't have
a Stargate until we came here.

455
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,018
<i>Maybe when the Ancients
were first scouting this place,</i>

456
00:25:56,127 --> 00:25:58,273
they accidentally brought this...

457
00:25:58,355 --> 00:26:01,624
Kirsan fever with them. It got trapped
here and over the course of 10,000 years

458
00:26:01,704 --> 00:26:03,903
it mutated to cause the symptoms
we're now experiencing.

459
00:26:03,983 --> 00:26:06,263
That would also explain
why you and Ronon aren't affected.

460
00:26:06,343 --> 00:26:08,460
<i>You have antibodies built
up from when you were young.</i>

461
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,459
Well, if they have
the antibodies, then...

462
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:13,679
It would take months
to reverse-engineer a cure.

463
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,617
I mean, I'm not even sure it's possible.

464
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,076
The sap of the enchuri plant.

465
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:20,336
<i>My people have used it for
generations to combat Kirsan fever.</i>

466
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:23,093
It is highly effective
and not much is needed.

467
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:26,795
- Let's go get some.
- Take a Jumper.

468
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:27,931
Wait a minute.

469
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:30,203
You've disabled the Gate, remember?

470
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:33,896
You ordered Doctor Zelenka
to take the control crystal.

471
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:36,254
Where did he put it?

472
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:41,777
Zelenka, this is Sheppard. Come in.

473
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:45,419
Check out the rooms
down there and there.

474
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,811
I want this section
cleared out in ten minutes.

475
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:49,120
<i>Lorne, come in.</i>

476
00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:51,571
- Yes, Sir, go ahead.
- <i>You seen Zelenka?</i>

477
00:26:51,848 --> 00:26:53,201
As a matter of fact, I have.

478
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:55,628
Did you bring him to the mess hall?

479
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:58,836
Sorry, Sir, but he gave us the slip.
Must have heard us coming.

480
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:01,552
<i>Cracked one of my people
over the head with a metal rod and</i>

481
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:04,538
disappeared down a service hatch before
I could get a shot off. There's...

482
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,950
no telling where he is now.

483
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:13,581
<i>Zelenka, respond?</i>

484
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,032
Zelenka, come in.

485
00:27:17,674 --> 00:27:21,020
Radek? We are not trying to hurt you.
We need your help.

486
00:27:21,532 --> 00:27:25,010
OK, this is pointless. Look, we don't
even know if he still has a radio, and

487
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,966
even if we find him, he's not gonna
remember where's the control crystal.

488
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:31,598
- Let's face it: we're screwed.
- There's gotta be some way out of this.

489
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,001
What about the Jumpers?
They've got DHDs.

490
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:37,245
It doesn't matter. Without the crystal,
the Gate can't establish a wormhole.

491
00:27:37,332 --> 00:27:38,584
We're not going anywhere.

492
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:39,935
I'm missing something.

493
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:42,155
I can't concentrate.

494
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:44,079
What about the mainland?

495
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:45,362
Ronon is right.

496
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:48,258
The enchuri plant is abundant
on many worlds. It may be here as well.

497
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:49,523
All right.

498
00:27:49,613 --> 00:27:52,058
Assuming we can find the stuff,
how're we gonna distribute it?

499
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:55,647
I'll figure something out.

500
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,460
I'll stay with Rodney.
Do you know what to look for?

501
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,982
It grows like a weed on Sateda.

502
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,571
It's... right there.

503
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:23,313
You can fly this thing.

504
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:24,476
It's in your blood.

505
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:26,595
Literally.

506
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:46,276
Wait a second...

507
00:28:46,372 --> 00:28:47,557
what am I doing?

508
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:51,548
You said, the quickest way
to spread the cure

509
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:54,931
was to aerosolize it and distribute it
through the ventilation system.

510
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:57,667
You are currently attempting
to override base protocol

511
00:28:57,749 --> 00:29:00,496
for temperature, humidity,
and air pressure.

512
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:02,372
Right... right, okay, it's easy.

513
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:05,531
Just a simple matter of accessing
the root directory, and...

514
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:07,915
- Come on!
- Rodney...

515
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:10,547
No, no, no, no.
I should be able to do this in my sleep.

516
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:14,364
Oh, God...
it's happening to me too, isn't it?

517
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:15,704
You have to remain calm.

518
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:17,842
No, no. You don't understand.
My memory was lousy.

519
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,423
I mean, people's names, birthdays.

520
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:21,506
I once forgot mother's day
five years in a row.

521
00:29:22,046 --> 00:29:24,576
What is the ratio of circle's
circumference to its diameter?

522
00:29:25,423 --> 00:29:27,585
Well, that's pi. It's 3.14159265,
et cetera, et cetera.

523
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:30,470
- That doesn't count. That's easy.
- You are a scientist, Rodney.

524
00:29:30,552 --> 00:29:33,451
That is what you care about. That is
what you will hang on to the longest.

525
00:29:34,817 --> 00:29:35,829
Right.

526
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,305
Right, so...

527
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:39,558
wait a minute.

528
00:29:40,456 --> 00:29:42,225
Doesn't that make me
a really bad person?

529
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:45,702
It makes you the type of person
who is going to save all our lives.

530
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:47,138
Oh, okay.

531
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,757
What is this place?

532
00:29:58,411 --> 00:29:59,477
I don't know.

533
00:30:00,615 --> 00:30:02,064
Looks like they left in a hurry.

534
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:05,057
- She's not here. Let's...
- <i>Down here! This way!</i>

535
00:30:05,562 --> 00:30:07,790
Quiet! Go, go.

536
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:19,566
All right, everybody, spread out.
They got to be in here somewhere.

537
00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:40,027
<i>Sir!</i>

538
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,678
Found 'em.

539
00:30:43,195 --> 00:30:45,550
Good. Let's go. Let's move out, come on.

540
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,967
Can we get out of here, please?

541
00:31:00,577 --> 00:31:02,441
- What is it?
- I have an idea.

542
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,830
Come on.

543
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:10,059
<i>Let's go.</i>

544
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,981
Wait a minute.

545
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:18,229
- What is this place?
- The mainland.

546
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:21,270
- What are we doing here?
- I told you already.

547
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,680
We need to get that plant.

548
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,638
Something seems fishy.

549
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:31,894
Never gets old.

550
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:40,336
Sorry, buddy.
You're just going to slow me down.

551
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:54,894
How's it coming, Rodney?

552
00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:56,835
I'm just about finished... I think.

553
00:31:58,792 --> 00:31:59,913
What was that?

554
00:32:00,072 --> 00:32:02,258
I will go see. Keep working.

555
00:32:23,503 --> 00:32:24,513
Don't move!

556
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,571
Major Lorne.

557
00:32:27,132 --> 00:32:29,277
<i>- It's me, Teyla.</i>
- You shouldn't be out here.

558
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:31,076
Major, it's me.

559
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:33,161
Everyone's been ordered
back to the mess hall.

560
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:34,452
But Dr. Mckay and I...

561
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:37,187
Put your hands on your head. Slowly.

562
00:32:51,061 --> 00:32:52,086
Teyla?

563
00:33:02,486 --> 00:33:03,511
Oh, God...

564
00:33:36,438 --> 00:33:38,174
<i>All right, let's get her up.</i>

565
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:50,951
Come on...

566
00:33:53,568 --> 00:33:54,624
All right.

567
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:57,108
Look, I know you're probably
panicking right now,

568
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,440
but there is no time for that.
You need to focus.

569
00:33:59,822 --> 00:34:02,601
I'm sure you're wondering,
who tied you to the desk...

570
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:14,105
- You're awake.
- Major Lorne, you must set me free...

571
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:17,307
Save it. You're not going anywhere
till I get some answers.

572
00:34:18,463 --> 00:34:20,952
I need to know
what you've done to my people.

573
00:34:21,032 --> 00:34:23,274
What I've done?
You believe I'm behind this?

574
00:34:23,356 --> 00:34:26,330
Is it a drug? Some kind of bio-weapon?

575
00:34:26,426 --> 00:34:29,310
Major, they're sick. You as well.

576
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:31,935
<i>The entire base is infected
with a disease.</i>

577
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,366
Everyone except you.

578
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:37,535
Yes. I'm immune to its effects.

579
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:38,912
Isn't that convenient?

580
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:40,744
How many of those have you taken?

581
00:34:40,826 --> 00:34:42,903
Why don't you just let me
worry about that, okay?

582
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:43,991
It's the pills.

583
00:34:44,611 --> 00:34:46,670
<i>They're what's making you act like this.</i>

584
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:49,546
They're confusing you.
They're making you unstable.

585
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:50,975
Making me unstable?

586
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:54,795
I'm not the one who unleashed a disease
on my people, okay? Quit stalling.

587
00:34:54,877 --> 00:34:56,831
I want to know what you were doing
in the hall...

588
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:01,923
Rodney!

589
00:35:02,214 --> 00:35:03,719
- Teyla?
- Yes.

590
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,403
It's good to see you. Colonel Carter,
Dr. Zelenka, you as well.

591
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,052
How did you find me?

592
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,009
Well, we were having trouble finding you
by ourselves, so we followed him.

593
00:35:14,294 --> 00:35:15,540
Did you finish your work?

594
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,429
What do you mean?

595
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,745
Can you disarm the force shield?

596
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:25,763
I don't know.

597
00:35:46,236 --> 00:35:47,261
Quickly!

598
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:07,525
Don't move!

599
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:10,361
Drop it.

600
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:13,138
Now back away.

601
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:20,627
Now...

602
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,356
Tell me...

603
00:36:23,404 --> 00:36:24,838
Who the hell are you?

604
00:36:28,964 --> 00:36:30,848
I know you don't remember everything.

605
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:32,595
You have no idea what's going on.

606
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,373
You're confused,
maybe even a little scared.

607
00:36:35,537 --> 00:36:36,571
I know I would be.

608
00:36:37,669 --> 00:36:38,919
But you have to trust me.

609
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,259
We're friends.

610
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,367
The things we've been through together,
I don't care what anyone says,

611
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:46,870
no disease can wipe that away.

612
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:48,543
Not completely.

613
00:36:48,955 --> 00:36:51,498
Okay, deep down,
you know I'm telling the truth.

614
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:55,938
- Now, give me the gun.
- Oh, nice try.

615
00:36:58,514 --> 00:37:00,383
For all I know,
you're the one who tied me up.

616
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:01,476
Fine.

617
00:37:01,846 --> 00:37:05,103
Then shoot me, and you'll be all alone,
in the middle of a dark forest,

618
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:08,739
with no idea who you are, where you're
going, or what you're going to do next.

619
00:37:09,172 --> 00:37:10,939
How could I possibly make it any worse?

620
00:37:12,465 --> 00:37:13,654
That's a good point.

621
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:26,383
Here. Sit.

622
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:28,469
Are you sure you wouldn't rather do it?

623
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:30,417
- I do not know how.
- And I do?

624
00:37:30,497 --> 00:37:33,114
Yes. You created the override program.

625
00:37:33,204 --> 00:37:36,809
- You said you were almost finished.
- Oh, then it should be easy.

626
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:40,933
Rodney, listen to me.
You must do this, It is our only chance.

627
00:37:44,386 --> 00:37:46,044
The knowledge is inside you.

628
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:47,706
You just have to find it.

629
00:38:09,808 --> 00:38:10,930
He did it.

630
00:38:11,024 --> 00:38:13,898
When I said I was almost finished,
I guess I wasn't kidding.

631
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:16,226
Now what?

632
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:20,182
Well, now we just have to hope
that colonel Sheppard and Ronon

633
00:38:20,427 --> 00:38:22,065
completed their side of the mission.

634
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,811
Right. Right...

635
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:27,110
- Who?
- Who?

636
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:30,864
What is it?

637
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,632
A ship.
Headed for the bay doors on the roof.

638
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,568
Have they identified themselves?

639
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,815
No, Sir. It could be help.

640
00:38:37,997 --> 00:38:39,912
It could also be some kind of an attack.

641
00:38:39,992 --> 00:38:43,093
Get in touch with the others.
Tell them to meet me at the Jumper bay.

642
00:38:43,206 --> 00:38:44,737
<i>And find major Lorne!</i>

643
00:38:51,153 --> 00:38:53,299
- Nice flying.
- Thanks.

644
00:38:53,614 --> 00:38:55,560
Come on, help me with this stuff.

645
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:59,209
We got to get this to Teyla right away.

646
00:38:59,331 --> 00:39:00,337
Who?

647
00:39:00,723 --> 00:39:01,742
Come on.

648
00:39:04,499 --> 00:39:05,982
Hands in the air. Now.

649
00:39:06,697 --> 00:39:08,501
Listen, Lieutenant, this is medicine.

650
00:39:08,582 --> 00:39:10,855
- We need to deliver it.
- I said, hands in the air.

651
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:16,964
Let's take them to the brig.

652
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:19,000
You're making a mistake.

653
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,054
There are sick people who need that.

654
00:39:21,765 --> 00:39:23,375
You sure you know what you're doing?

655
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,317
What the hell is going on here?

656
00:39:25,453 --> 00:39:28,258
Sir, we caught these men
trying to infiltrate the base.

657
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:29,879
Lorne, you have got to listen to me.

658
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:32,043
Everybody on this base
is going to die if you don't.

659
00:39:32,123 --> 00:39:34,092
- And who are you?
- Look in your pocket.

660
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:36,653
- What?
- Just look in your vest pocket.

661
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:43,618
<i>You took a picture of him
just in case it came to this.</i>

662
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:44,842
<i>I was there.</i>

663
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,409
He's telling the truth.

664
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:51,211
This is our commanding officer.

665
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,080
That's right.

666
00:39:53,735 --> 00:39:55,496
I am your commanding officer.

667
00:39:55,665 --> 00:39:58,189
So... you should do what I say.

668
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,842
Yes, Sir. What are your orders?

669
00:40:04,214 --> 00:40:05,966
- Do what he says.
- Gun.

670
00:40:07,327 --> 00:40:08,434
Follow me.

671
00:40:29,575 --> 00:40:30,906
Colonel, you're awake.

672
00:40:34,405 --> 00:40:35,527
What happened?

673
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:38,139
Teyla distributed the plant
through the ventilation system.

674
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:39,647
<i>Knocked you out for a bit.</i>

675
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:41,482
How long have I been asleep?

676
00:40:41,734 --> 00:40:42,609
About a day.

677
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:44,485
A day?

678
00:40:44,686 --> 00:40:46,679
Hit some people harder than others.

679
00:40:47,857 --> 00:40:49,699
How are you feeling, John?
How's your memory?

680
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,677
Oh, pretty good, I think. I mean...

681
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:55,946
things are a little fuzzy.

682
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:58,214
If I forget your birthday next year...

683
00:40:59,038 --> 00:41:00,370
I will forgive you.

684
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:03,899
When you are feeling well enough,

685
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:07,136
major Lorne wishes to speak with you.
He feels badly about what happened.

686
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:09,165
It wasn't his fault.

687
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,804
Just glad he still had
the photo I gave him.

688
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:14,007
- That was good thinking, by the way.
<i>- Yes.</i>

689
00:41:14,087 --> 00:41:16,440
If the distribution of the cure
had been delayed any longer,

690
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,176
many more people would have died.

691
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,030
What do you mean?

692
00:41:23,344 --> 00:41:24,470
Where's McKay?

693
00:41:44,654 --> 00:41:46,037
You should get some sleep.

694
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:49,712
It's okay. I'm fine.

695
00:41:51,597 --> 00:41:53,569
I can let you know when she wakes up.

696
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:54,922
I wanna stay.

697
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:57,060
Okay.

698
00:41:58,675 --> 00:42:00,484
She's not giving up, you know.

699
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,763
She's a fighter.

700
00:42:14,463 --> 00:42:15,365
Katie?

701
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:19,408
Doctor!

702
00:42:20,106 --> 00:42:21,539
She's moving her fingers.

703
00:42:23,442 --> 00:42:24,585
Katie? Katie!

704
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:29,338
Hello.

705
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,265
Where am I?

706
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,103
You're in the infirmary.

707
00:42:33,436 --> 00:42:34,472
You're safe.

708
00:42:35,517 --> 00:42:37,004
Do you remember anything?

709
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:51,070
It's good to see you.

710
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,765
Yeah, it's good to see you too.
