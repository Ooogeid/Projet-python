1
00:00:00,452 --> 00:00:02,222
<i>Previously on</i>
Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:02,342 --> 00:00:03,965
<i>The weekly injection you gave me,</i>

3
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:07,046
<i>that must have been some kind of drug
to keep my cells from deteriorating.</i>

4
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:10,821
Listen, we're going to keep working
till we find a cure for this thing.

5
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:13,891
Jackpot.

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:16,601
It's a booby trap.
We got to get out of here now!

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,030
Have the combat engineers gear up,
and have Dr. Keller ready her away team.

8
00:00:22,387 --> 00:00:24,319
- Listen...
<i>- It's Michael's database.</i>

9
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:26,582
There's a large chunk of it,
maybe the whole thing.

10
00:00:26,702 --> 00:00:28,730
<i>We'd have him on the run.
He'd be finished.</i>

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,576
Effective immediately,
you are being removed from command.

12
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,006
Who... who's replacing me?

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,475
I am.

14
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:41,753
Good afternoon, Dr. Keller.

15
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:44,586
How's my newest patient?

16
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,435
Today, he's decided
that he will only sleep

17
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:50,142
as long as I hold him and keep moving.

18
00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:52,449
I've already walked
half the City and back again.

19
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:54,180
My parents used to put me in the car.

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,768
My dad would have to drive around and
around the block at 3:00 in the morning.

21
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:01,019
That would be lovely.
At least I'd be sitting down.

22
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:03,030
I wanted to thank you.

23
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,281
- For what?
- I saw Kanaan today.

24
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:07,834
- How's he doing?
- Much better.

25
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:10,427
He is himself once again, in every way.

26
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:12,795
In fact, I'm going to request
that he and many of the others

27
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:14,553
be allowed to return to the City,

28
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:17,497
as soon as Mr. Woolsey arrives
in the Daedalus.

29
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:20,441
I still can't believe
Sam's not coming back.

30
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:21,840
It is difficult.

31
00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:24,555
Well, anyway,

32
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:27,199
it wasn't me that cured Kanaan
and the other hybrids.

33
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,840
It was Dr. Beckett's retrovirus,

34
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:32,074
and you could thank him in person

35
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:36,096
if I could just get my head around
all this Wraith medical data.

36
00:01:36,578 --> 00:01:38,369
You believe the answer's
in there somewhere?

37
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:40,132
We know he was giving Carson a serum

38
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:42,818
to keep his internal organs
from deteriorating, and

39
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,769
I think I might have found the formula,

40
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:48,153
I just need to be sure.

41
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:51,518
Well, at least we know
he's safe for the moment.

42
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:53,134
Technically, yeah.

43
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:57,477
I just hate the thought of him
being stuck in that box.

44
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:02,178
You know Rodney goes to visit him?

45
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:05,707
He stands in front of the stasis pod
and tells him all the latest news.

46
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:06,780
Really?

47
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,026
I walked in on him once by accident, and

48
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:13,215
he pretended like he was checking
the system or something.

49
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,847
He surprises me sometimes.

50
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:19,626
Well,

51
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:23,643
this is me once again
being recalled to duty.

52
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:25,143
Have a nice walk.

53
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:29,824
Don't worry, Jennifer. I'm sure
you'll find what you're looking for.

54
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,954
Sir, Daedalus just dropped out
of hyperspace.

55
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:48,783
We're receiving a signal.

56
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,632
He's coming down.

57
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,076
Mr. Woolsey, welcome back.

58
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,992
Thank you, Colonel.

59
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:11,835
Well, then...

60
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,388
I think I'll start by going over copies
of all your latest reports.

61
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:21,825
- Yours as well, Doctor.
- What, right now?

62
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,137
I've been out of touch
on the Daedalus for 3 weeks.

63
00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:26,307
I'd like to be up to speed
as quickly as possible.

64
00:03:26,427 --> 00:03:28,186
We can have a full briefing
in the morning.

65
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,639
Please have the rest of my things
sent directly to my quarters.

66
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,548
Yes, sir.

67
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:34,173
Nice speech.

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,522
Very inspiring.

69
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,524
Let's do one more series, see if we can
get the results to normalize a little.

70
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,014
Doctor, you're still here.

71
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:37,113
Oh, yeah, I fell asleep at my desk.

72
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:39,787
Well, if you don't mind me saying,

73
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:41,759
I think you're pushing yourself
a little hard.

74
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,516
You should take it easy.

75
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:45,872
I know, I'm... going to turn in now.

76
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:48,827
Are you all right?

77
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:50,240
Yeah, I'm fine.

78
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:52,378
Okay, 'night.

79
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:56,270
'Night.

80
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,865
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

81
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,620
present:

82
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:15,317
Season 5 Episode 02
The Seed (v. 1.0)

83
00:05:24,549 --> 00:05:27,394
Timing by:

84
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:35,444
Golgi, Linwelin, Pikes, Ricana.

www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

86
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:08,977
Did you get any sleep last night?

87
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,238
- Do I really look that bad?
- No, no, of course not.

88
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:14,301
That's not what I meant.

89
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,362
It's really... It's a lovely...

90
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:17,369
Thanks.

91
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,912
- New table, huh?
- Woolsey brought it with him.

92
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:25,300
He said he wanted
a little piece of home.

93
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,016
A 12-foot-long mahogany
conference table...

94
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:31,359
I don't get it. I thought Colonel Carter
was doing a good job.

95
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,569
I agree.
We defeated the Replicators,

96
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:36,734
we thwarted Michael's plans, and
the Wraith are in a state of disarray.

97
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,978
All of this happened
while she was leader of Atlantis.

98
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,461
That's the problem.

99
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,042
I don't understand.

100
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:44,310
She's a victim of her own success.

101
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:46,803
Now that the threat level is down,

102
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:48,617
the IOA is gonna jump at the chance

103
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:50,413
to put a civilian back in command.

104
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:53,732
Well, it's not just that. I mean,
Sam didn't exactly stick to protocol.

105
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:55,416
- Neither did Weir.
- Right,

106
00:06:55,536 --> 00:06:59,471
so for 4 years, they've waited to get
someone who'll do things their way.

107
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:00,692
I still don't get it.

108
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:03,098
When you were in the future,
and you learned all those things

109
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:06,026
that were going to happen, wasn't
this one of them, Woolsey taking over?

110
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:08,464
Well, the circumstances were different.

111
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:11,309
Still, it is a little unsettling.

112
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,622
I mean, maybe it's harder to change
the course of events than we thought.

113
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,199
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.

114
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,512
I mean, the fact that Sheppard's
here makes all the difference, right?

115
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,945
Woolsey wasn't the weirdest thing
about that timeline.

116
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,807
What do you mean?

117
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:26,858
Never mind.

118
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:31,107
Well,

119
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:33,387
I see everyone's here.

120
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:36,528
Let's get started.

121
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:43,539
First of all, I'd like to congratulate
all of you on the success

122
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:46,260
you've had dismantling
what's left of Michael's organization.

123
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:49,764
Except one thing.
We haven't found him yet.

124
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:52,319
Well, he was on the cruiser
you destroyed in orbit

125
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,727
around M2S-445.

126
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:57,438
There's a chance he may have made it
off the ship.

127
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,393
You're referring to this statement given
by one of Michael's ex-mercenaries,

128
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:04,099
- claiming to have seen him alive.
- That's what he said.

129
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,335
This is one unsubstantiated report

130
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:08,407
from a highly unreliable source.

131
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,910
Well, someone stole
our Jumper off that ship.

132
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:14,372
I thought you needed ancient DNA
to pilot one of those.

133
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:17,871
Not necessarily. We developed a gene
therapy that works... some of the time.

134
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:21,576
He is responsible for the deaths
of hundreds of thousands of people.

135
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:23,460
If there is a chance he is still alive,


136
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,550
- we must continue the search.
- I'm sorry,

137
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,735
but I can't devote the resources
of this base to the never-ending pursuit

138
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:31,544
of a single individual
across an entire galaxy.

139
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:34,433
Even if I knew for a fact he were still
alive, I still wouldn't authorize it,

140
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:38,694
unless you have some new,
credible evidence as to his whereabouts.

141
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,456
Do you?

142
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,391
No.

143
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:44,235
For the time being,

144
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:47,238
I shall consider the matter closed.

145
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:49,290
As to these prisoner hybrids.

146
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,566
I understand they're being held
in a camp on the mainland?

147
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:53,569
That's right.

148
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:55,913
And how is
their rehabilitation progressing?

149
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:04,872
Right, uh...

150
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:10,219
Well, we've had some success
using a slightly modified version

151
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,336
of the original retrovirus
that created Michael in the first place.

152
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,540
It weeds out the Wraith DNA,

153
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,139
and allows them to resume
their original human form, over time.

154
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,106
Without any lasting ill effects?

155
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:24,025
None that we've detected so far.

156
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:26,257
Many have already
completed the treatment.

157
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,278
They're wondering
when they might be released.

158
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:29,864
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

159
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:32,352
These people are victims, Mr. Woolsey.

160
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:35,786
Maybe so, but until very recently,
they were also enemy combatants.

161
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:38,197
Fine. We'll just keep
them there forever.

162
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:39,257
No.

163
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:43,424
We'll keep them there until
I'm satisfied that they can be trusted.

164
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:46,846
Now,

165
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:50,009
regarding the situation
with our friend in the stasis pod.

166
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:52,822
You seem to have been giving
a significant amount of attention

167
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:53,930
to this lately.

168
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,949
Well, once we got our hands
on Michael's medical research,

169
00:09:57,109 --> 00:09:59,681
I thought I should make it
a priority to look for a solution.

170
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:02,230
- And have you found one?
- Maybe.

171
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,107
We found a serum that,
in lab tests at least,

172
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:08,487
seems to be capable
of stabilizing the clone cells.

173
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:11,364
So, what's the problem?

174
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:13,859
Carson was near death
when we put him in that chamber.

175
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,797
I don't want to take him out
until I know for sure,

176
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,846
but lab tests can only do so much.

177
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:21,903
But that problem's never
going to go away, is it?

178
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:24,879
If you've reached the limit
of what your research can tell you,

179
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,773
then you need to make a decision.

180
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,139
Either proceed,

181
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,716
or put the matter aside
and get back to your regular duty.

182
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:32,490
Right?

183
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,457
You sure about this?

184
00:10:37,577 --> 00:10:38,382
No,

185
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:41,852
but we're never going to be sure
unless we give it a shot.

186
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:44,161
If we don't take a chance now,

187
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:46,400
he could be in there forever.

188
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,810
All right, then.

189
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,879
Get him on the gurney.

190
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:00,312
Careful...

191
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,183
Okay.

192
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:16,063
Now what?

193
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:18,283
Now we take him to the infirmary
and watch for signs

194
00:11:18,403 --> 00:11:20,725
for more cellular degradation.
We should know soon enough.

195
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:32,982
Hey there.

196
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:34,704
How you doing?

197
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:37,149
Fine.

198
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:39,272
What happened?

199
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:40,925
Well, what do you think?

200
00:11:41,557 --> 00:11:42,916
We thawed you out.

201
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,579
It's nice to see you again, Carson.

202
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,755
Yeah, what's up, Doc?
It's been a while.

203
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,719
Aye.

204
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:49,714
How long was I in there?

205
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:51,760
Two months, give or take.

206
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:56,202
- Did I miss anything?
- You know, just the usual.

207
00:11:57,268 --> 00:11:58,703
Well, I've got good news.

208
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:02,058
At the moment, you're showing
no signs of cellular degradation.

209
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:04,810
You were able to recreate the treatment.

210
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:06,312
That's right.

211
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:10,191
I'll let them tell you all about it.

212
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:12,190
Hey, Doc...

213
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:14,344
Um, nice work.

214
00:12:14,464 --> 00:12:16,286
Well, it's not a permanent solution.

215
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:17,885
It's good enough for now.

216
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,480
Go get some rest.

217
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,079
Yeah, I think that might be a good idea.

218
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:06,729
There you are.

219
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:10,081
Gorgeous, isn't it?

220
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:12,411
I suppose so.

221
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:14,839
You know, I really did miss this place.

222
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:17,878
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.

223
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:21,615
What's that supposed to mean?

224
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,928
I just found out
they're sending you back to Earth.

225
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:26,258
There's a scheduled dial-out
this afternoon.

226
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,873
Oh, well, I suppose it's to be expected.

227
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:32,650
I mean, even with these injections,

228
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,402
I imagine it'd still be months
before I'm in decent physical condition.

229
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:39,458
<i>- This is Teyla, come in, please.</i>
- Go ahead.

230
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,966
<i>I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need your help.</i>

231
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,209
What is it?

232
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:47,276
It's Dr. Keller.
She was supposed to join me

233
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:49,318
for breakfast this morning
but did not show up.

234
00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:50,728
So maybe she's sleeping in.

235
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:53,210
I assumed as much as well,
and decided not to disturb her.

236
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,089
However, it was 4 hours ago. She's late
for her shift, not responding to radio.

237
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:59,409
- What do you want me to do?
- Override the door controls.

238
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,049
I'm not breaking into her room.

239
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:03,659
Rodney, there might be something wrong.

240
00:14:04,663 --> 00:14:07,694
Fine, but if she's in there sleeping,
or naked or something,

241
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,814
you guys are taking the blame.

242
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:12,198
All right...

243
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:18,541
For God's sake, Rodney, hurry up.

244
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:26,431
Jennifer, are you all right?

245
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,829
She must be unconscious.

246
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:36,378
- Pupils dilated.
- Carson, step away from the bed.

247
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:38,731
- What?
- Step away now!

248
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,606
What is it?

249
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,387
Dear Lord.

250
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,981
- Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla.
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

251
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:52,151
John, we have a problem.

252
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,067
- What the hell's going on?
- Not sure. This is how we found her.

253
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:08,401
- It must've happened last night.
- I've seen something like this before.

254
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:10,600
- Where?
- One of Michael's labs.

255
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,331
He was conducting some experiment.


256
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:14,770
Well, we've got to get it off of her.

257
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,028
I'm not so certain
that's such a good idea.

258
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:20,071
From what I can tell, the tendrils
are attached to her and the bedframe.

259
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:23,259
If we just start ripping them off,
we could cause her serious injury.

260
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,928
Well, we can't just leave her like this.

261
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:28,722
Need to get her to an isolation chamber,
and take the whole bed as well.

262
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,870
That way we can run a full examination
and see what we're dealing with here.

263
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,990
These things are actually
growing out of her body?

264
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,706
- That's what it looks like.
- Is she conscious?

265
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:44,348
Beckett says her brain activity
is consistent with somebody in a coma.

266
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:46,590
Dr. Beckett is not on active duty.

267
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,092
He was the first one there.
He says he's seen something like this.

268
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:51,922
While he was a prisoner.

269
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:54,076
He was forced to work
for Michael for two years.

270
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:57,004
Nobody knows this stuff
better than he does.

271
00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:02,339
<i>I'm gonna try to cut
some of the thinner strands.</i>

272
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:03,963
<i>Scalpel.</i>

273
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:06,462
<i>Thank you.</i>

274
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,306
There we go. Nurse?

275
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,818
- No change.
- Get that analyzed right away.

276
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:26,855
Doctor, blood pressure's dropping.
Pulse as well.

277
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:30,034
I was afraid of that. She's crashing.
Administer five milligrams of atropine.

278
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:32,036
<i>My God...</i>

279
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:34,043
<i>Come on...</i>

280
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:42,379
<i>There she is.</i>

281
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:49,359
<i>I'm sorry, I don't dare make
another incision.</i>

282
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,386
So much for cutting her loose.

283
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:57,400
Dr. Beckett, I'd like a word.

284
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,159
I'll get her out. Once I...


285
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,053
I appreciate what you're trying to do,


286
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:06,904
but our Earth dial-out is in one hour.

287
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:11,468
I'll take a pass on this one,
if you don't mind.

288
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:13,252
If it wasn't for Dr. Keller,

289
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:15,954
I'd be locked in that stasis chamber,
possibly forever.

290
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:19,030
Dr. Keller's own report
is abundantly clear.

291
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,217
While your condition has stabilized,
you've suffered

292
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:23,126
severe damage to your internal organs.

293
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:26,044
You need to be in a hospital bed,
not running a medical investigation.

294
00:17:26,164 --> 00:17:27,373
I'll be fine.

295
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:30,609
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll step aside, I promise.

296
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:32,787
You're convinced it has something
to do with Michael?

297
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:34,939
It's not a case of the hives, is it?

298
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:42,310
How's she doing?

299
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,168
Vitals have stabilized,
still showing minimal brain function.

300
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:47,410
We did manage to get
blood and tissue samples.

301
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,364
All right,
then we've got some work to do.

302
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:55,401
You're not sending him back, huh?

303
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:57,958
He is the closest thing
to an expert we have.

304
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,065
It's not exactly by the book.

305
00:18:00,185 --> 00:18:01,767
Don't get used to it.

306
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:11,124
How's it coming?

307
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:12,281
Slowly,

308
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:14,963
but I did find something
in Jennifer's blood.

309
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,265
- What?
- Easy.

310
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:20,101
It's some kind of alien pathogen,
so far unidentified.

311
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:21,812
I'm checking it against the database.

312
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:23,981
Is it possible
she's turning into a hybrid?

313
00:18:24,141 --> 00:18:25,372
No, I don't think so.

314
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:28,235
I saw several variations of the process,
but never anything like this.

315
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:30,359
Well, it's got to be something
to do with Michael.

316
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:33,099
She hasn't been offworld since
she helped rescue us from that lab.

317
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:34,889
That's what I was thinking.
Of course,

318
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:37,371
if that's where she came
in contact with the pathogen...

319
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,079
You think we may have been exposed.


320
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:40,683
Aye, it's a possibility.

321
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:44,413
I'll need blood samples from everyone
who was on that planet, including you.

322
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:45,533
Great.

323
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:48,102
- Doctor...
- Yes?

324
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:49,965
- Yes.
- She's awake.

325
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:52,217
Thank you. Right.

326
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:00,868
Oh, my God...

327
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:11,862
Rodney, what's happening to me?

328
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,622
We're not entirely sure.

329
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,784
It looks like some kind of a cocoon.

330
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:18,880
Does it hurt?

331
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:21,580
I can't feel anything.
I can't move.

332
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:23,154
Okay, look...

333
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:27,540
Don't you worry, okay?
We're going to get you out.

334
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,047
Who else is here?

335
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,965
What do you mean?
There's no one.

336
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,427
I don't want to go to sleep.
I'm afraid I won't wake up.

337
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:39,091
- Jennifer?
- It's not my fault.

338
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,951
Of course it's not.
It's an alien organism.

339
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:45,114
- What?
- Carson found it in your blood sample.

340
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:47,593
He's gonna figure out what it is,
and then

341
00:19:47,713 --> 00:19:49,858
we're gonna figure out how to kill it.

342
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:51,652
My hand.

343
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:55,414
- What about it?
- That's where it started.

344
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:57,074
I saw it a few nights ago.

345
00:19:57,474 --> 00:19:59,117
So why didn't you say anything?

346
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:01,723
I was going to run a scan.
I don't...

347
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:04,039
I don't know.

348
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:06,708
It doesn't matter, okay?
We're going to fix this.

349
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:07,849
I promise.

350
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:19,690
It appears to be affecting her mind.

351
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,176
Aye, she claims to be hearing voices,
like there's someone else in the room.

352
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:24,806
How fast is it growing?

353
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:28,163
Currently, it's doubling its mass
every couple of hours.

354
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,600
Thank you.

355
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:33,104
This isn't just about
Dr. Keller anymore.

356
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:36,353
I need to know if this thing
is going to be a threat to the base.

357
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:38,282
I'd say that's a definite yes.

358
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:42,077
- What do you mean?
- Colonel Sheppard, Ronon, Rodney,

359
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:45,023
everyone who was on M2S-445,

360
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:47,406
they all tested positive.

361
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,209
Whatever this is,

362
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:52,118
they've all got it.

363
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:00,304
We're working under the assumption

364
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:03,576
that this alien pathogen was present
somewhere in that lab,

365
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,037
possibly as part of one
of Michael's experiments.

366
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:08,948
When the building was destroyed,
it was released.

367
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,793
We've been back for a month now.

368
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:13,196
If it was going to spread
to the general population,

369
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:16,403
- it would've already happened.
- I know. Dr. Beckett is now confident

370
00:21:16,563 --> 00:21:18,157
that it's not contagious.

371
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,741
Why confine us to our quarters?

372
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,492
You've seen Dr. Keller.

373
00:21:22,652 --> 00:21:24,909
- But it's not happening to me.
- Not yet.

374
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:27,407
There could be any number
of random physiological reasons

375
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,876
why it's starting with Dr. Keller,
but that's no guarantee

376
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:31,833
that it's not going to happen to you.

377
00:21:31,953 --> 00:21:34,617
It could be a matter of days,
it could be a matter of hours.

378
00:21:34,737 --> 00:21:37,841
Even Colonel Carter's been quarantined
back at Stargate Command.

379
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:42,411
Look, I know it's hard for you
to stay on the sidelines, Colonel,

380
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:44,895
but it's the right call.

381
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:49,535
In the meantime,
what are we going to do about Keller?

382
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:54,310
We're still assessing the situation.

383
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:05,365
We still don't know how the pathogen
causes the physiological changes,

384
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:09,485
but we've managed to complete
our analysis of the sample I extracted.

385
00:22:10,142 --> 00:22:12,143
Essentially it's a biopolymer,

386
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:14,002
similar to a polysaccharide,

387
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:16,096
but with organo-metallic
compounds mixed in.

388
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:17,714
For the uninitiated, please.

389
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,094
It's like the material an insect
or a crustacean uses to form its shell.

390
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:24,418
At first, it's soft and pliable,

391
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:26,708
and then it becomes tough and leathery,

392
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:29,192
and eventually it hardens
into an incredible density,

393
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:31,619
resistant to heat, pressure,
and even radiation.

394
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:33,897
- Yes, it's like the hull of a ship.
- Aye.

395
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:36,313
- What are you saying?
- We always knew

396
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:38,546
that the Wraith ships
were organic in design,

397
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,566
that they were essentially grown
instead of constructed.

398
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:43,776
W- We've just never witnessed it.
- Are you telling me

399
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,535
that a hive ship
is growing inside that isolation room?

400
00:22:47,054 --> 00:22:49,913
Actually, it's no longer
just inside the isolation room.

401
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:52,649
It doesn't register
on our life-signs detector,

402
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:54,292
but once we knew it,

403
00:22:54,452 --> 00:22:57,629
we calibrated our internal
sensors in order to pick it up.

404
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:01,967
It has penetrated the walls
and the floors,

405
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:05,039
consuming and converting
the material as it goes.

406
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,792
How far has it spread?

407
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,254
It's gone down...

408
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,045
Three levels already,

409
00:23:11,165 --> 00:23:13,770
and it has attached itself
to the electrical system.

410
00:23:14,337 --> 00:23:15,907
It's siphoning off power.

411
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,692
This seems to have accelerated
its growth significantly.

412
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:21,278
How do we stop it?

413
00:23:21,438 --> 00:23:24,364
- We're still trying to figure out.
- We could cut off the power.

414
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:27,101
That should slow it down quite a bit.

415
00:23:31,848 --> 00:23:34,657
What's happening?
Marie, what's going on?

416
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:37,980
Doctor, we've been ordered
to evacuate the building.

417
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:39,352
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:52,267
They just left her?

419
00:23:52,574 --> 00:23:54,409
I don't think they had much of a choice.

420
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:57,430
Carson is searching Michael's database
to see if anything can help us.

421
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,740
I suppose it was Zelenka's idea
to shut off the power?

422
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,991
I don't know. Why?

423
00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:02,427
This is ridiculous.

424
00:24:02,547 --> 00:24:03,782
They got us stuck

425
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,156
while the new guy
takes advice from the B team?

426
00:24:06,316 --> 00:24:07,613
What is it, Rodney?

427
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:10,635
They are assuming
that it tapped into the electric grid

428
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:13,001
by randomly spreading out
through the walls and floors.

429
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:15,495
What if it actually grows
towards electromagnetic fields,

430
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:18,275
like a plant growing toward the sun?
It's going to head directly

431
00:24:18,395 --> 00:24:20,798
for the next available power source.

432
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,028
There.

433
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:26,642
One of the City's main power conduits
runs beneath the building.

434
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:28,781
So shut the power down
in that section as well.

435
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,079
No, we already did,

436
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:32,799
this conduit runs directly into the ZPM.

437
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:35,258
It's like an express lane.

438
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:38,522
We've already shut off the traffic,
but this one keeps moving along.

439
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:40,799
The only way to stop it
would be to pull the ZPM

440
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,302
and shut off power to the entire City.

441
00:24:43,422 --> 00:24:47,394
I had no idea you were so familiar
with the power distribution grid.

442
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:48,778
I'm not.

443
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:50,299
I spoke to Rodney.

444
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,545
- Is there a problem?
- The pathogen seems

445
00:24:55,665 --> 00:24:57,810
to have a psychological effect
on the host.

446
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,405
At the very least,
we know it can affect their judgment,

447
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:02,972
possibly well before
any physical symptoms appear.

448
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:05,277
Yes, but he's not wrong about this.

449
00:25:05,397 --> 00:25:08,385
If it reaches the conduit, it will have
access to virtually unlimited power.

450
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,186
And what would happen?

451
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:12,211
The growth would increase exponentially.

452
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:15,455
And since we've shut this section down,
we have no sensors in the area,

453
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:17,909
so the only way to know
how far it's penetrated

454
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:20,007
is to do a visual inspection.

455
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:22,027
All right, assemble a team.

456
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,950
I need some answers, Doctor.

457
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,847
How do we kill this thing?

458
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:34,165
We're working on
a genetically engineered virus

459
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:38,285
that might be capable of destroying
the pathogen that's infecting Dr. Keller

460
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:41,168
but that wouldn't eliminate
the biopolymer itself.

461
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,991
What would?

462
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:45,066
At this time,

463
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:48,259
I have no idea.

464
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,823
So the main conduit
runs behind this wall here.

465
00:25:57,582 --> 00:26:00,284
Here, we can access it
through this panel.

466
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:09,067
Sergeant, take your men, split up,
and search the surrounding corridors.

467
00:26:09,187 --> 00:26:11,586
Look for anything that seems unusual.

468
00:26:14,396 --> 00:26:15,345
All right?

469
00:26:15,465 --> 00:26:16,366
Okay.

470
00:26:29,103 --> 00:26:30,385
Right, I'll go this way.

471
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,704
- Stay in radio contact.
- Right.

472
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:00,609
I think I have something.

473
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,102
Looks like Rodney was right.

474
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,065
Oh my...

475
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,352
What is it?

476
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:19,182
Looks like it's attached itself
to the power conduit.

477
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:21,255
I'm coming to you.

478
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:29,550
I'm going to see if I can determine
how much power it's draining.

479
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,473
Let's go, let's go.

480
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:02,036
Come on.

481
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:10,816
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

482
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:16,227
- I had no idea it could move like that.
- Nor did I.

483
00:28:16,347 --> 00:28:18,645
This is much worse than we thought.

484
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:26,995
Looks like it's just a minor concussion.
He should be fine.

485
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:29,546
It wasn't bad enough that this thing
was taking over the base.

486
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,219
Now it's attacking people?

487
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:32,756
We need to stop this, now.

488
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,129
It won't be easy.

489
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:36,471
It's already siphoned off
a massive amount of power.

490
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:39,771
- We should pull the ZPM.
- That might not be enough.

491
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:42,515
We could sit here in the dark for weeks
while it just keeps on growing.

492
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:44,015
We need to get Jennifer out.

493
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:47,520
I want to save Dr. Keller too,
but we have additional concerns now.

494
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:49,377
Why did it attack Radek?

495
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:51,900
Because it perceived him as a threat
and took action.

496
00:28:52,218 --> 00:28:54,477
That indicates intelligence,
but as far as we know,

497
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:57,530
- it has no brain of its own.
- So you're saying it's using her.

498
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,023
I'm saying it needs her,
to plan, to coordinate,

499
00:29:00,143 --> 00:29:01,790
to identify threats and deal with them.

500
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,533
That could explain
why she was hearing voices.

501
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:07,332
The organism takes over
a portion of the brain, and sets up

502
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:10,794
a separate consciousness.
Like multiple personalities.

503
00:29:10,954 --> 00:29:13,400
Otherwise, why have a human host at all?

504
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,632
So if we separate her
from the main body...

505
00:29:16,336 --> 00:29:19,278
I'd wager the rest of it becomes
as lifeless as a dead tree trunk.

506
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:21,805
Now, this is the virus
I was telling you about.

507
00:29:22,288 --> 00:29:23,706
It's called a phage,

508
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:25,998
and it should, at least theoretically,

509
00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:27,523
be able to attack and eliminate

510
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:29,476
the pathogen
inside Jennifer's bloodstream,

511
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:31,981
and if I'm right about this,

512
00:29:32,315 --> 00:29:34,414
it should sever the connection.

513
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:37,062
What's the catch?

514
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:38,822
It's never been tested.

515
00:29:44,612 --> 00:29:48,231
We turned the power back on briefly
to get a look inside the building.

516
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,294
This is the ground floor,
five floors below the isolation room.

517
00:29:52,414 --> 00:29:54,726
As you can see,
access is almost completely choked off,

518
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:58,174
but for this to work, I need someone
to step right up to Dr. Keller's bed

519
00:29:58,334 --> 00:30:00,718
- and inject her.
- We can use the transporter, but...

520
00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:03,671
But you'd still have to run
a gauntlet of over 50 meters.

521
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:06,391
And after what happened
to Dr. Zelenka...

522
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:11,174
- You understand my dilemma.
- Yeah.

523
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:13,022
What?

524
00:30:16,111 --> 00:30:19,214
If Dr. Keller really is the key
to this thing,

525
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:21,009
there is an easier way.

526
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:26,202
We'd only need a couple of well-aimed
shots at the isolation room.

527
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,496
You're talking about drones?

528
00:30:28,738 --> 00:30:30,290
Fire drones on our own people?

529
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,403
I didn't come to Atlantis for killing
one of my senior staff inside of a week,

530
00:30:34,523 --> 00:30:37,822
but my only other option
is to risk someone else's life

531
00:30:38,085 --> 00:30:39,387
on a solution...

532
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:42,714
that hasn't even been tested yet.

533
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,611
Not exactly by the book.

534
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:49,011
So test it.
I've got the same bug.

535
00:30:49,886 --> 00:30:52,289
- I'll take a shot right now.
- No...

536
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,371
I'll do it.

537
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:01,233
Restraints?

538
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:06,888
I'm sorry, but I'm anticipating
a severe reaction.

539
00:31:07,363 --> 00:31:08,264
Great.

540
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:10,646
Now, you're absolutely sure about this?

541
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:12,286
The formula comes from Michael,

542
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:15,359
- so as far all we know, it could...
- Turn me into a bug?

543
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:18,590
- Been there, done that.
- No, actually, I was going to say

544
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,111
it could kill you.

545
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:24,237
Just... give me the shot.

546
00:31:24,931 --> 00:31:25,803
Okay.

547
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,606
Now, it should take
a few minutes to kick in, so just...

548
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:38,691
- try to relax.
- Okay, I'll just... I'll relax.

549
00:31:40,338 --> 00:31:43,149
Is it true that Lorne
and the others show symptoms?

550
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,771
Aye, I'm afraid so.

551
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:46,131
Oh, God...

552
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:48,500
Why? Have you noticed
something yourself?

553
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,497
My palms are very sweaty,
and my mouth is very dry,

554
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:55,618
- I'm having heart palpitations.
- Nothing out of the ordinary, then?

555
00:31:57,295 --> 00:31:59,754
- How do you feel?
- I don't feel anything.

556
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:02,926
I don't even think that...

557
00:32:04,836 --> 00:32:05,936
Hey, Doc...

558
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:10,107
I think these restraints
were a good idea.

559
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:12,043
It's working.

560
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:21,359
- What's our status?
- The infirmary,

561
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,237
and other essential systems have been
switched to emergency generators.

562
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:26,558
We're ready.

563
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,676
All right, pull the plug.

564
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:46,963
How long's this going to go on for?


565
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:48,469
I'm sorry, I have no idea.

566
00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:52,728
Doc...

567
00:32:54,612 --> 00:32:57,173
His heart stopped. Bag him.
Get a crash cart in here!

568
00:32:57,293 --> 00:32:59,515
Prepare to intubate.
One, two, three.

569
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:00,940
One, two, three.

570
00:33:02,332 --> 00:33:03,901
Come on.
One, two, three.

571
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:10,437
He's back.

572
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:17,764
How'd I do?

573
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,983
Are you sure it worked?

574
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:26,116
The blood screen came up negative.


575
00:33:26,236 --> 00:33:28,169
The alien pathogen has been eliminated.

576
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:29,290
Well done.

577
00:33:29,492 --> 00:33:31,524
We need someone
to go into the isolation room.

578
00:33:31,644 --> 00:33:33,598
- I'll do it...
- I'll do it.

579
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:38,104
I assume no special medical skill
is required to administer the drug.

580
00:33:38,347 --> 00:33:40,480
No, not really.
It's just a simple injection.

581
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,045
Then, given your condition,

582
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:44,901
- I wouldn't make you my first choice.
- I said I'd do it.

583
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:47,862
He doesn't trust us,
because we're still infected.

584
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:50,566
Actually, that might not be a bad thing.

585
00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:53,300
When colonel Sheppard
was infected with Iratus bug DNA,

586
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,329
he was able to walk right into that nest
without being attacked.

587
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,414
Someone infected with the pathogen

588
00:33:58,574 --> 00:34:00,846
would be more likely to get through?

589
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:02,268
It's possible.

590
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,551
All right, I'm in.

591
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:13,054
Cut power to the transporter.

592
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:19,549
<i>- How does it look?</i>
- Not so good.

593
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:26,328
The stuff's everywhere.

594
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:29,737
Is it reacting to your presence
in any way?

595
00:34:30,063 --> 00:34:31,164
Not really.

596
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,541
All right, just...

597
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:35,535
Be careful.

598
00:34:47,843 --> 00:34:49,044
What happened?

599
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:51,806
It worked. They just sent Ronon
to give her the shot.

600
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:52,766
When?

601
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:55,885
He just got there.
I'm tapped into the intercom.

602
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:01,018
<i>Ronon, what's your status?</i>

603
00:35:01,484 --> 00:35:04,480
Well, it's getting harder to move.
There's too much of it.

604
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,831
Just... Try not to make
any sudden moves, or...

605
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:10,279
threatening gestures.

606
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,362
<i>Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.</i>

607
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:21,198
All right, that's it.

608
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,503
I don't think I can go any further.

609
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:25,918
The corridor is completely blocked.

610
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,098
<i>All right, so what do you want me to do?</i>

611
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:36,358
- Screw it, i'm going to make a hole.
- <i>Ronon, wait!</i>

612
00:35:36,478 --> 00:35:38,032
<i>The only reason you made it this far</i>

613
00:35:38,152 --> 00:35:40,592
is because it senses the pathogen
in your bloodstream.

614
00:35:40,712 --> 00:35:42,728
It thinks you're a friend.
If you start shooting...

615
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:45,012
Does anyone have any better ideas?

616
00:35:50,828 --> 00:35:52,342
What are you doing?

617
00:35:52,462 --> 00:35:55,157
If I'm right,
this is about to go very, very wrong.

618
00:35:55,277 --> 00:35:58,687
- You can't. We're quarantined...
- I'm cured, remember?

619
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:01,594
There's no other way through.

620
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:03,998
Once you start shooting,
you'll have to move quickly.

621
00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:05,833
Thanks for the advice.

622
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:26,438
Ronon?

623
00:36:27,506 --> 00:36:29,287
Ronon, what's your status?

624
00:36:29,963 --> 00:36:31,095
Ronon, come in!

625
00:36:31,215 --> 00:36:32,652
Oh, my God...

626
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:46,139
- What's happening?
- We've lost contact.

627
00:36:47,178 --> 00:36:49,752
Turn the power back on.
Open up a channel to the isolation room.

628
00:36:49,912 --> 00:36:50,918
What? Why?

629
00:36:51,452 --> 00:36:52,603
Just do it.

630
00:36:55,795 --> 00:36:57,547
All right, you have a channel.

631
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:00,754
Dr. Keller, this is Colonel Sheppard,
do you read?

632
00:37:00,874 --> 00:37:04,039
<i>I hear you, Colonel,
but I'm not Dr. Keller anymore.</i>

633
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:07,436
Well, who are you?

634
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,175
<i>I have no designation yet.</i>

635
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:11,732
<i>I'll be given one when I'm complete.</i>

636
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:14,866
- What about Ronon?
- <i>You mean the intruder?</i>

637
00:37:14,986 --> 00:37:16,320
<i>He's alive, for the moment.</i>

638
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,828
He's been neutralized.

639
00:37:18,948 --> 00:37:20,591
I can feel his pulse.

640
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:22,088
It's weak.

641
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:24,871
It would only take
the slightest squeeze.

642
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:28,005
Yeah, but you don't wanna
do that because

643
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,974
he's one of you, remember?

644
00:37:30,786 --> 00:37:32,155
Keep her talking.

645
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:35,256
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go finish this.

646
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:40,442
Jennifer, this is Carson.

647
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:44,562
<i>Dr. Beckett, I already told you,
I'm not Jennifer Keller anymore.</i>

648
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:46,423
You're the voice she was hearing,

649
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:48,297
the part of her mind
that was taking over.

650
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:51,689
<i>You can't stop me.
I will become as I was meant to be.</i>

651
00:37:59,273 --> 00:38:01,414
Colonel Sheppard
is powering up a Jumper.

652
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:03,177
Get me a secure channel.

653
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:06,385
- Sheppard, what are you doing?
- I'm taking a little short-cut.

654
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:08,664
Sorry I didn't have time
to fill out the paperwork.

655
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,422
Okay, I see it now.

656
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:20,551
That stuff is growing
all over the place.

657
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:22,989
<i>This may hurt.</i>

658
00:38:36,863 --> 00:38:38,671
Colonel Sheppard, report.

659
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:42,411
Colonel Sheppard?

660
00:40:11,031 --> 00:40:13,428
Colonel Sheppard, what's your status?

661
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,085
<i>Colonel Sheppard...</i>

662
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:19,550
I've been better.

663
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:21,745
<i>What happened?</i>

664
00:40:24,729 --> 00:40:26,551
You'd better come get us.

665
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:34,702
How's Ronon?

666
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,870
He has a bruised larynx.

667
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,314
Apparently he won't
be able to speak for several days.

668
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:43,807
I wonder if anyone
will notice the difference.

669
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:47,749
Colonel Sheppard?
Look who's finally out of isolation.

670
00:40:47,968 --> 00:40:50,064
Oh, it's good to see you, Doc.

671
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:51,584
How you feeling?

672
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,187
It only hurts when I breathe.

673
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:56,074
I feel really bad. It looks like

674
00:40:56,194 --> 00:40:58,292
my recovery's gonna be
a lot easier than yours.

675
00:40:58,749 --> 00:40:59,900
That's all right.

676
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,379
I've got two doctors
looking after me now.

677
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,353
Well, no, I'm afraid not.

678
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,918
I'm scheduled to leave this afternoon.

679
00:41:08,038 --> 00:41:11,222
That is, unless of course there's
a major crisis in the next hour or so.

680
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,422
It wouldn't surprise me.

681
00:41:14,684 --> 00:41:16,874
Well, listen,
you keep yourself out of trouble,

682
00:41:16,994 --> 00:41:18,861
and I'll see you real soon.

683
00:41:19,368 --> 00:41:21,800
- Good luck, Carson.
- Thanks, John.

684
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,293
Welcome back, Dr. Keller,

685
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:25,964
and Dr. Beckett...

686
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:28,759
Thank you.

687
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:30,810
My pleasure, Mr. Woolsey.

688
00:41:35,475 --> 00:41:36,574
Before I came here,

689
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,623
I was on a call with my superiors
back on Earth.

690
00:41:40,477 --> 00:41:42,795
They were going over
my preliminary report.

691
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:46,132
- What did you tell them?
- The truth.

692
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:49,366
That in my first three days
as commander,

693
00:41:49,684 --> 00:41:52,847
I violated at least half a dozen
basic security protocols.

694
00:41:53,248 --> 00:41:54,503
That many, huh?

695
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,342
I let Beckett run the investigation,

696
00:41:58,462 --> 00:42:00,794
in spite of his condition
and the fact that he's technically

697
00:42:00,914 --> 00:42:02,996
no longer a member of this expedition.

698
00:42:04,078 --> 00:42:06,245
I sent Ronon to deliver the antidote

699
00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:08,269
even though he was infected.

700
00:42:09,434 --> 00:42:12,255
I compromised the safety of this base

701
00:42:12,877 --> 00:42:15,411
to rescue someone who may
well have been beyond our help anyway.

702
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,103
But she wasn't, and we got her out.

703
00:42:18,223 --> 00:42:21,417
And if you had played by the rules,
she'd be dead right now.

704
00:42:24,674 --> 00:42:26,345
The IOA would seem to agree with you.

705
00:42:26,465 --> 00:42:29,341
Apparently, they're willing
to let the matter drop.

706
00:42:31,742 --> 00:42:33,053
So, what's the problem?

707
00:42:37,372 --> 00:42:40,085
The rules are there for a reason,
Colonel.

708
00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:41,854
If I can't trust them,

709
00:42:42,386 --> 00:42:43,438
then...

710
00:42:45,058 --> 00:42:47,109
I'm not sure I can do this job.

711
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:56,990
Welcome to the Pegasus galaxy.
