1
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:03,770
So, how did it go, Sir?

2
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:05,759
The Genii contact didn't show up.

3
00:00:06,412 --> 00:00:08,157
I can't say I'm surprised.

4
00:00:08,277 --> 00:00:10,860
What are you saying, Major,
the Genii can't be trusted?

5
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:13,988
Well, they did try and kill you and
Dr. McKay, along with that little girl.

6
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:17,059
True, true, and normally, that's
the kind of thing I'd take personally,

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,757
but Ladon claims
he didn't order the hit.

8
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:21,732
He's trying to get on our good side.

9
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:24,193
Do you think they know anything
about where Michael took Teyla?

10
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,618
They've got solid intel,
and we're following up every lead,

11
00:00:26,738 --> 00:00:29,150
- no matter how thin.
- Okay, so, what do you want to do?

12
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:30,641
Well, I'm gonna go ahead.

13
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:33,218
You stay behind for a few hours,
tell me if he shows up.

14
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:34,373
Will do.

15
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:37,494
We're gonna find her, Major.

16
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:39,850
Yes, Sir.

17
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:55,144
Somebody turned up the heat.

18
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:57,230
Hello?

19
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:08,560
If this is a surprise party,
it's not my birthday.

20
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,426
This is Sheppard, anyone read?

21
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:38,428
I repeat,

22
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,982
this is Sheppard,
anyone on this channel?

31
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:41,896
All right, this is either the most
elaborate practical joke of all time,

32
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,978
or I'm in serious trouble here.

33
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:49,939
This is Sheppard,
anyone on this frequency?

34
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:52,376
<i>- Sheppard, is that really you?</i>
- McKay?

35
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,323
<i>- Can't believe it. It actually worked!</i>
- What are you talking about?

36
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,489
- What the hell is going on here?
<i>- I imagine</i>

37
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:59,284
<i>you're a little confused right now.</i>

38
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,046
<i>God, for you, like, what,
five minutes has passed?</i>

39
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,665
<i>Look, I need you to describe exactly
what you're seeing.</i>

40
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,798
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- In the control room. It's deserted.

41
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,846
<i>- Is there any power?</i>
- No, everything's dead.

42
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:12,700
<i>Yeah, and did I tell you
the ocean's gone?</i>

43
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:13,995
<i>Sorry, what?</i>

44
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,749
The big blue thing
out the window, it's gone.

45
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,867
It's a desert, and it's about
120 degrees in here.

46
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:23,416
<i>Jeez, the planet must've undergone
some serious climate changes.</i>

47
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:25,812
If you don't start giving me
some answers pretty soon here...

48
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,658
<i>Okay, look, I understand this is hard
for you. Just do me a favor</i>

49
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,386
<i>and go to the hologram room.</i>

50
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:31,983
- Why?
<i>- Just do it, please.</i>

51
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,473
All right, I'm here.

52
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:59,324
<i>- Well, activate the hologram projector.</i>
- There's no power

53
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:03,191
<i>It's connected to an independent
power source. Don't worry, it will work.</i>

54
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,228
Hey there.

55
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:12,771
- Rodney?
- God, it's good to see you again.

56
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,816
- You're a hologram?
- No...

57
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:18,107
Of course.

58
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:20,944
I'm tapped into
the City's internal sensors

59
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:24,181
so I've got eyes and ears, so to speak.
You look good.

60
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:26,403
You look...

61
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:29,102
Different.

62
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,129
That's 'cause you remember me
the way I was.

63
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:35,444
- What, you mean earlier today?
- Ah, it's funny, you know?

64
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:37,929
I've spent the last 25 years of my life
trying to make this work

65
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:40,218
and I never once thought
what I was gonna say to you.

66
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:43,713
You can start by telling me
what the hell's going on here.

67
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:45,834
Right, right. Okay...

68
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:48,402
Remember that mission report,

69
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:50,273
SG-1 stepped through the Gate,

70
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:54,215
their wormhole accidentally intersected
with a solar flare

71
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:56,289
and they were sent back to 1969?

72
00:05:57,972 --> 00:05:59,186
Well, vaguely.

73
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,193
Well, something similar
has just happened to you.

74
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:03,533
I was sent back in time?

75
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:07,781
No, in fact, you were sent forward
into the future.

76
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,608
How far into the future?

77
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:12,197
Interesting question,
and one that was not easy to figure out.

78
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,116
I had to determine
the exact characteristics

79
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,999
of the solar flare in question...

80
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:18,256
48,000 years, give or take?

81
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:24,179
- This is a practical joke.
- I'm afraid not. Freak accident. Sorry.

82
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:29,374
You're telling me I just traveled 48,000
years into the future, in 10 seconds?

83
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:31,143
It's kinda cool when you think about it.

84
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:33,651
Surfing a 30-foot wave in Waimea
is cool.

85
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:35,882
Dating a supermodel is cool.
This is not cool!

86
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:37,484
All right, calm down.

87
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,447
If I'm in the future,

88
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:44,073
- that means you're...
- Dead.

89
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,812
Dead and buried, and turned to dust
a long, long time ago,

90
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:49,870
along with everyone you ever knew.

91
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:53,376
There's no way of knowing what the state
of human civilization is,

92
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,783
whether it even still exits. I mean,

93
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:58,161
we've obviously abandoned this City.

94
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:59,392
Yeah, obviously.

95
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:01,838
There's not enough power
for you to gate back to Earth,

96
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,252
and without a MALP, going anywhere else
would be far too risky.

97
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,224
It is entirely possible that you are
the last human being alive.

98
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:11,979
You're not doing a very good job
of cheering me up here.

99
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,323
Oh, consider yourself lucky, young man.

100
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:16,911
While I was figuring out this plan,

101
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:19,688
I had no way of knowing whether
the City would even survive this long.

102
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:20,670
What plan?

103
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,093
I took advantage of some progress
in hologram technology

104
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:26,494
to create this simulation.

105
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:30,155
I'm able to move anywhere
inside the City.

106
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:33,924
I'm fully interactive, and I'm designed
to mimic the exact response

107
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:36,126
and appearance
of the great Dr. Rodney McKay.

108
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,509
Couldn't use anyone else, huh?

109
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:40,888
Funny.

110
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,344
I'm linked to the City's main systems,

111
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,381
but I have an independent core drive,

112
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,909
which is sealed in the foundation
of one of the outer buildings,

113
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:51,579
along with a Mark-12 naquadah generator

114
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,527
and a couple of other,
well, key components.

115
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:55,900
It's kind of like a...

116
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,302
well, what would you say...
like a time capsule, so to speak.

117
00:07:58,422 --> 00:08:00,128
It's really nice to have company,

118
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:02,569
but if what you're saying is true,
what good does it do me?

119
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:05,324
Oh, trust me,
I wouldn't go to all this trouble

120
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,571
just so we could have a chat.

121
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:10,243
No, I'm... I'm here to bring you back.

122
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,364
Come along.

123
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:16,839
<i>- Where are we going?
- Stasis chamber.</i>

124
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,957
<i>- Why?
- Buy some time.</i>

125
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:21,505
Oh, that really explains everything.

126
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,819
Theoretically, we can send you back
exactly the way you got here,

127
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:28,210
using the Gate, the right address,
and a solar flare.

128
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:31,076
Only problem is, we're waiting
for something very specific,

129
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:33,964
a prominence with exactly
the right shape, size,

130
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:36,818
characteristics, and relative
position in space

131
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:39,154
so that it will interact
with the wormhole

132
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:40,920
in exactly the right manner,

133
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,882
and send you back exactly the right
amount of time.

134
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:46,014
- And that doesn't happen every day.
- Exactly.

135
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:49,872
- How long are we talking about?
- 700, 800 years, 1000 tops.

136
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,370
That's your plan?

137
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:55,453
I'm 48,000 years into the future,
and you want to put me on ice

138
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:57,290
- for another thousand?
- Tops.

139
00:08:58,123 --> 00:08:59,349
We need to be precise.

140
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:02,255
If I don't get you back within
two months of the moment you left, then

141
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,696
it'll be too late.

142
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,258
Too late?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

143
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:12,889
Things didn't exactly go well for us
after your disappearance.

144
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:15,750
Once I figured out what happened to you,

145
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,239
I realized there was
nothing we could do.

146
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,438
The air force pronounced you KIA,

147
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:24,025
and they gave you a very nice
military funeral back on Earth.

148
00:09:24,145 --> 00:09:25,691
Obviously, the casket was empty,

149
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:28,279
but, you know, it's the thought
that counts.

150
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:29,906
From there...

151
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:35,090
From there,
things went from bad to worse.

152
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:39,581
<i>We kept searching for Teyla, but</i>

153
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:42,780
<i>we just didn't have the resources
to cover enough ground.</i>

154
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,940
<i>It took us two months
before we finally found her</i>

155
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,098
<i>in one of Michael's hideouts,</i>

156
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,249
<i>but by then it was too late.</i>

157
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,199
She'd had the baby.

158
00:10:01,787 --> 00:10:02,743
I guess,

159
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,450
after that...

160
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,319
he didn't have any use for her anymore,

161
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:10,030
so he killed her.

162
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,063
It's not your fault.

163
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,831
I should have been there.

164
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,047
And you will be,

165
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,996
and knowing the address
where we eventually found Teyla,

166
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:25,182
you will be able
to get there much quicker.

167
00:10:25,302 --> 00:10:28,999
You know, save Teyla, save the baby,
change the fate of the galaxy.

168
00:10:29,197 --> 00:10:30,220
What do you mean?

169
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,641
It was the turning point, the key to
everything. Once Michael had that baby,

170
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:36,710
he was able to complete his research
and perfect the hybrids.

171
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,726
After that, well, he really
kicked things into gear.

172
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:46,392
<i>He stepped up his campaign of exposing
human populations to the Hoffan drug.</i>

173
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,144
<i>Jennifer did her best to find a way
to combat the effects,</i>

174
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:52,113
<i>trying to lower the mortality rate,
but ultimately,</i>

175
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,402
<i>it was a losing battle.</i>

176
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:01,964
<i>With their food supplies tainted,</i>

177
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:04,626
<i>the infighting between
the Wraith factions got worse.</i>

178
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:06,920
<i>Michael waited until they were
at each other's throats,</i>

179
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,584
<i>and then he made his move.</i>

180
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:12,058
Status.

181
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,393
Both hives are heavily damaged.

182
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:17,994
They've lost hyperdrive
and they're venting atmosphere.

183
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,365
Well then, let's finish it.

184
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:34,524
<i>He took advantage of their weakened
state and their internal divisions,</i>

185
00:11:34,976 --> 00:11:38,820
<i>and in less than a year,
he had the Wraith on their knees.</i>

186
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,852
<i>Literally.</i>

187
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:50,507
You know, the irony is,

188
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,100
I never asked for any of this.

189
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:00,670
I was taken prisoner by the humans,

190
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:02,601
tortured,

191
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:04,752
experimented on,

192
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:08,316
and when I finally escaped
and returned to my Wraith brothers,

193
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,548
<i>instead of being welcomed back,</i>

194
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,777
I was met with scorn.

195
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:14,529
You will pay for this.

196
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,699
You still have your pride.

197
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:21,763
Good for you.

198
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,577
With the Wraith in disarray,

199
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:11,493
Michael returned to the humans
he'd infected with the Hoffan drug.

200
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:14,407
He selected the strongest
and the healthiest of the survivors

201
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:16,556
and converted them to hybrids.

202
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:18,455
The rest he exterminated.

203
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:21,292
You think by saving Teyla,
we can change all this.

204
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:24,785
I know it. All I have to do is
get you safely to a stasis chamber,

205
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:27,145
I will reprogram the sensors...

206
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:32,660
- That could be a problem.
- No, no, that's not a problem.

207
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,035
We'll just find another way around.

208
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:40,282
There is no other way around.

209
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:48,218
The sand has penetrated
the lower levels.

210
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,884
48,000 years into the future,

211
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:53,510
you've still got a knack
for stating the obvious.

212
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:56,134
All right, what do we do?

213
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,460
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

214
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,397
Well, I wasn't programmed
for this variable.

215
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:03,697
You said you had 25 years
to work on this plan.

216
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:07,284
Well, McKay did, and he brilliantly
anticipated a lot of potential problems.

217
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:08,910
It's just that, well,

218
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,942
this wasn't one of them.

219
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:12,289
All right,

220
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:15,143
go up two levels turn right,
there's an outer door.

221
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:17,150
It's only a quarter of a mile
across the plaza.

222
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,070
<i>- You can't do that.</i>
- Why not?

223
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:21,473
Not only is it extremely hot out there,

224
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:24,218
but for the last half an hour, the
barometric pressure has been dropping,

225
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:26,278
<i>and the wind speeds
have increased significantly.</i>

226
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,342
- Storm's coming.
- A sandstorm.

227
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,864
- You ever been in one of those?
- As a matter of fact, I have.

228
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:34,722
Oh! Then you know what that means.

229
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:37,348
It's not like we have
a lot of options here.

230
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:52,909
That sounds pretty nasty out there.

231
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:56,284
The winds are gusting
over 50 miles an hour and increasing.

232
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:59,307
The visibility's basically zero.
You can't go out there.

233
00:14:59,427 --> 00:15:01,724
- You're just gonna have to wait it out.
- For how long?

234
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:04,350
Well, I don't know,
maybe a couple of hours.

235
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,052
Are you hungry? Do you have any food?

236
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:17,447
I suppose it doesn't really matter.
We'll wait for the storm to blow over

237
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:19,986
and have you out of here
in no time at all.

238
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,188
Well, you'll actually be here
for 700 years, but...

239
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:24,845
<i>you know what I mean.</i>

240
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:26,887
What about everyone else?

241
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:30,725
<i>I mean, you told me about Teyla,
but what about the rest of them?</i>

242
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:34,354
No way we would've rolled over and
let Michael take over the whole galaxy.

243
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:36,492
No.

244
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:40,021
Well, what happened?

245
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,653
The IOA and the military were reluctant
to commit a lot of resources

246
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:47,778
to protecting the human populations
of another galaxy,

247
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:49,773
but Sam...

248
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:53,194
Sam wouldn't take no for an answer.

249
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:57,337
<i>Finally, they decided
to give her a new ship,</i>

250
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,504
<i>the Phoenix.</i>

251
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:04,029
<i>It was barely off the assembly line.</i>

252
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:06,289
<i>Half the Asgard systems
weren't finished, the other half</i>

253
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:07,672
<i>weren't working.</i>

254
00:16:12,432 --> 00:16:15,103
<i>We spent the better part of a month
getting her ready for combat.</i>

255
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:17,936
<i>We worked day and night, side by side.</i>

256
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,538
<i>Zelenka might have been there as well,
I don't really remember.</i>

257
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,920
<i>I do remember never feeling so drained</i>

258
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,396
<i>in my entire life.</i>

259
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,344
<i>Eventually, though,</i>

260
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:38,913
<i>we managed to get her in working order.</i>

261
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:45,725
All right, everything checks out.

262
00:16:45,845 --> 00:16:47,910
Weapons, shields, long-range sensors,

263
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,638
all in the green. She's good to go.

264
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,231
Great work, Rodney.

265
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:52,969
Now I want you, Radek, and your team

266
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:55,292
to head back to Atlantis
and take a couple of days off.

267
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:57,769
When you're good and rested,
get to work on the City's shields.

268
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:00,266
Do anything you can
to maximize efficiency.

269
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,661
You're gonna need them.

270
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:04,004
- Well, what about you?
- I'm gonna take her out.

271
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,315
For the time being,
Major Lorne is in command of Atlantis.

272
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:08,469
Take some time.
You're as exhausted as we are.

273
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,796
Intel suggests that Michael's about
to move against several human worlds.

274
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,412
- We have to get out there now.
- So let someone else go.

275
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:17,374
Right.

276
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:19,592
Hey...

277
00:17:23,004 --> 00:17:23,964
Good luck?

278
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:27,595
Thanks, Rodney.

279
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:32,724
For everything.

280
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:49,114
<i>They started a series of hit and run
ops, real guerrilla style.</i>

281
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:00,968
- One of the hives has been neutralized.
- What about the other one?

282
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:02,793
Minimal damage.
They're powering weapons.

283
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:04,906
Should we swing around for another pass?


284
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:06,881
Forget it. Get us out of here.

285
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:16,599
For a while, it really worked. They were
able to inflict considerable damage

286
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,495
despite terrible odds,

287
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:21,187
but, eventually, their luck ran out.

288
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:25,842
<i>Michael deliberately leaked some intel</i>

289
00:18:25,962 --> 00:18:29,197
<i>that he was about to attack
a heavily-populated human world.</i>

290
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:32,399
<i>Sam thought she could get there first,</i>

291
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:35,117
<i>but she was wrong.</i>

292
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:43,405
- We've got a hive ship, 6:00.
- It's an ambush.

293
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:46,504
- Here comes another one, dead ahead.
- Evasive maneuvers!

294
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,976
- We're boxed in.
- Return fire!

295
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,078
We've lost Asgard weapons!

296
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:09,160
Switch to missiles, fire all batteries!

297
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,499
Help him. Go.

298
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:20,956
We've got an overload,
it's the hyperdrive!

299
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:22,973
Reroute the power!

300
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:25,363
No response. System is going critical.

301
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:29,723
I'm beaming you to the planet.
Head to the Gate as soon as you can.

302
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:32,133
- What about you?
- I'll be right behind you.

303
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:49,651
<i>After she got the crew off,
she must have lost the transport system.</i>

304
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,963
<i>With her engines about to go critical,
I guess she figured</i>

305
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,197
<i>she didn't have anything to lose.</i>

306
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:15,260
<i>With her last breath, she took out
three of Michael's hive ships,</i>

307
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:18,553
and we buried another empty casket.

308
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:41,498
- Where the hell have you been?
- I was inputting our...

309
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:43,747
new solar flare
requirements to the long-range sensors,

310
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,125
and I found out
what happened to the ocean.

311
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:49,711
You gonna tell me, or keep it a secret? 

312
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:52,167
The sun in this system is dying.

313
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,442
- It's running out of fuel.
- Wouldn't that make it colder?

314
00:20:55,562 --> 00:20:59,142
No. As it consumes the heavier elements,
it begins to expand.

315
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:01,264
It's basically turning into a red giant.

316
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,372
Okay, so mystery solved. Let's move on.

317
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:05,242
No, no, you don't get it.

318
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:07,935
This isn't some kind of
cyclical climate change,

319
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:09,930
this is a one-way ticket.

320
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,059
This planet is going to get
hotter and hotter.

321
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:15,828
Eventually, the atmosphere
is gonna burn off.

322
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:18,497
- How long before that happens?
- It is impossible to say,

323
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:21,504
but my best estimate is under 500 years.

324
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:23,619
You said I'd be in stasis
for at least 700.

325
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,637
Right.

326
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:28,416
So the moment you step out of
the stasis chamber, you'll be killed.

327
00:21:31,621 --> 00:21:35,017
- You gotta think of something.
- I am trying. It's like I said...

328
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:37,787
You didn't anticipate the variable.
I get it.

329
00:21:39,661 --> 00:21:42,478
All right, can the Mark-12
power the shields?

330
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:45,808
Theoretically, but there would never be
enough power left over to maintain

331
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,076
my systems, the long-range sensors,
the stasis chamber...

332
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,978
The City has solar
power generators, right?

333
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:53,959
Yes, which would come in very handy

334
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,569
if we were trying to power
a couple of electric golf carts.

335
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:59,531
- You're thinking like the old McKay.
<i>- I can't really help that.</i>

336
00:21:59,907 --> 00:22:02,888
- Look, what are you saying?
- The sun's going red giant, right?

337
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,541
Increased solar energy.

338
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:07,284
The worse it gets,
the more power we'll have.

339
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:09,604
Oh, my God, that could work.

340
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:12,354
We use the shields
to protect the atmosphere.

341
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:13,381
Exactly.

342
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:16,131
We couldn't do it indefinitely,
but it would buy us 100 years or so.

343
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:18,758
It's gonna have to do for now.
Open up the door.

344
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,759
- What about the storm?
- It's been going on for seven hours.

345
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:24,139
- It could go on for days.
- It'll be dark soon.

346
00:22:24,554 --> 00:22:27,316
All the more reason to get going. All
I got to do is walk in a straight line.

347
00:22:27,436 --> 00:22:31,479
- It might not be as easy as you think.
- Never said I thought it would be easy.

348
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,657
Look, I haven't eaten.

349
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:37,291
I was hungry on my way back to Atlantis.
The longer we wait, the weaker I get.

350
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:39,696
All right. Look, I can't go outside,

351
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,819
but I can stay in contact with you
over the radio.

352
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:49,472
Like you said!

353
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:52,104
Just keep walking in a straight line!

354
00:22:52,535 --> 00:22:55,046
You'll hit the building
on the other side!

355
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,835
Then feel your way to the door!

356
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,007
I'll be waiting for you there!

357
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:13,240
- Sheppard, can you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you!

358
00:23:16,135 --> 00:23:18,225
- How you doing?
- Never better!

359
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,105
Yeah, I'm still here.

360
00:23:31,225 --> 00:23:32,833
<i>Tell me about Ronon.</i>

361
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:34,826
What, now?

362
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:36,241
<i>Yes, now!</i>

363
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:37,918
<i>Talk to me, Rodney.</i>

364
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:38,947
Right...

365
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:41,013
Well...

366
00:23:41,645 --> 00:23:43,952
after what happened to you and...

367
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:45,283
and then Teyla,

368
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,115
I guess he didn't feel comfortable
on the base anymore.

369
00:23:49,913 --> 00:23:53,506
<i>He persuaded Sam to let him go off-world
and recruit a strike force.</i>

370
00:23:54,162 --> 00:23:56,416
<i>By this time, the galaxy was in a panic.</i>

371
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:59,985
<i>Word was spreading that Michael's agenda
was to wipe out Wraith and human alike.</i>

372
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:03,866
<i>Ronon didn't have much trouble
finding volunteers.</i>

373
00:24:09,204 --> 00:24:09,937
One!

374
00:24:11,632 --> 00:24:12,372
Two!

375
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:15,655
<i>They were just simple villagers,
with no military experience,</i>

376
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:18,370
<i>but he trained them
in all forms of combat.</i>

377
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,224
<i>He even convinced Sam to let them
have some of our equipment.</i>

378
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:23,473
<i>Radios, explosives, P-90s.</i>

379
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:27,028
<i>It wasn't long before he had himself
a pretty effective combat force.</i>

380
00:24:30,412 --> 00:24:33,184
<i>They ran a few successful ops against
some of Michael's ground facilities,</i>

381
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:34,854
<i>and then one day,</i>

382
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:38,147
<i>they got a key piece of intel.</i>

383
00:24:41,258 --> 00:24:43,277
<i>Michael had taken over a Wraith lab
and was using it</i>

384
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:45,280
<i>to create more of his hybrids.</i>

385
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,519
<i>They decided to take it out.</i>

386
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,576
<i>That's when they ran into someone...</i>

387
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:56,863
<i>unexpected...</i>

388
00:24:57,478 --> 00:25:00,587
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I suspect the same as you.

389
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:03,219
Michael is using this facility
to create more of his soldiers.

390
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:04,883
I intend to destroy it.

391
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,100
By yourself?

392
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,226
There is something to be said
for stealth over brute force.

393
00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:10,346
<i>Ronon, come in.</i>

394
00:25:11,598 --> 00:25:12,598
Go ahead.

395
00:25:12,723 --> 00:25:15,971
<i>One of the guards must have got a signal
off, because a cruiser just landed.</i>

396
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:18,603
<i>- We're about to be overrun.</i>
- As I was saying...

397
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:20,058
We have to abort.

398
00:25:21,722 --> 00:25:23,006
Give me the C-4.

399
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:26,790
Take the men back, meet up with second
squad, and then head for the Gate.

400
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,323
<i>Signal me when you get there.</i>

401
00:25:29,348 --> 00:25:30,070
Go!

402
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,036
You intend to complete your mission?

403
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:34,533
You're damn right.

404
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:35,872
As do I.

405
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:38,583
I was going to write
an elaborate program

406
00:25:38,743 --> 00:25:41,002
designed to slowly create a fatal error

407
00:25:41,162 --> 00:25:42,830
in the primary capacitor,

408
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:45,924
but I doubt there will be time
for that now.

409
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:47,987
I was just gonna blow it up.

410
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:49,598
Naturally.

411
00:26:14,321 --> 00:26:15,370
Force of habit.

412
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:17,004
Indeed.

413
00:26:23,803 --> 00:26:26,045
This is it. If we detonate in here,

414
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:29,725
the secondary explosions will certainly
take out the entire facility.

415
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:30,845
All right.

416
00:26:31,345 --> 00:26:34,058
- You know another way out of here?
- Follow me.

417
00:26:37,302 --> 00:26:38,344
Fall back!

418
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,852
They're in here!

419
00:26:40,972 --> 00:26:43,898
I suggest you detonate now
while we still have a chance.

420
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:45,918
We wait for my people to clear, period.

421
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:46,842
Very well.

422
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:55,118
- We can't hold them off forever.
- Just keep firing.

423
00:26:58,315 --> 00:27:00,036
<i>Ronon, we've reached the Gate.</i>

424
00:27:00,156 --> 00:27:02,057
All right, I want you to head back now,

425
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:03,834
<i>no questions asked, is that understood?</i>

426
00:27:03,995 --> 00:27:05,042
<i>Understood.</i>

427
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:09,758
Are we done?

428
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:14,750
Yeah.

429
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:24,106
I'm sorry. I...

430
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,477
I wish some of these stories
had happier endings.

431
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,467
Sheppard, are you still with me?

432
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,962
You're bio-signature's
barely registering!

433
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:53,502
Oh, God...

434
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:08,798
<i>There you go, you can do it.</i>

435
00:28:15,783 --> 00:28:18,848
I'm still here.
Look, I'd help you up, but, I'm...

436
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:21,703
- How long was I out?
- All night.

437
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:24,157
You don't look good.
We should get you to the chamber

438
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,368
<i>- as soon as possible.</i>
- Agreed.

439
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:30,155
I've already prepped the solar panels.
You're good to go.

440
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:34,663
Here.

441
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,984
Take the first crystal.

442
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:42,640
I've loaded all the intel we got
on Michael after your disappearance,

443
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,095
including the address
where we found Teyla.

444
00:28:49,948 --> 00:28:52,951
You know, you never told me
what happened to you.

445
00:28:53,227 --> 00:28:54,312
I mean, in the past.

446
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,982
Oh, you don't want to hear about that.

447
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,354
Why not? Obviously, you survived.

448
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:01,444
- Only because I quit.
- Quit what?

449
00:29:01,704 --> 00:29:03,738
Atlantis, Stargate Command,
the whole thing.

450
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,596
- Well, that doesn't sound like you.
- Yeah.

451
00:29:07,885 --> 00:29:08,896
Well,

452
00:29:09,056 --> 00:29:10,954
we were under new management.

453
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:15,169
<i>I was down in the infirmary,
having suffered a...</i>

454
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:16,920
<i>well, a pretty serious injury.</i>

455
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,418
It's a splinter.

456
00:29:18,777 --> 00:29:20,953
That doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

457
00:29:21,507 --> 00:29:23,786
All right. It's just,

458
00:29:24,116 --> 00:29:26,845
you've kinda come at a bad time.
It's a little busy in here right now.

459
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:28,691
Yeah, I can see that.

460
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,766
<i>Dr. Keller, Dr. Mckay...</i>

461
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:33,246
Mr. Woolsey.

462
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:37,772
I understand you managed to get yourself
appointed our new commander.

463
00:29:38,264 --> 00:29:39,432
That's right.

464
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,125
I only wish it were
under better circumstances.

465
00:29:43,997 --> 00:29:45,989
May I ask what's going on here?

466
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:49,159
We're organizing some medical supplies
for one of our off-world refugee camps.

467
00:29:49,702 --> 00:29:51,870
I see.
I'm going to have to ask you to stop.

468
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:56,061
- I'm sorry?
- The IOA is initiating a new policy.

469
00:29:56,364 --> 00:29:59,056
Immediate recall of all base personnel.

470
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:02,505
From now on, we'll be focusing entirely
on the defense of this City.

471
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:05,550
Furthermore, Doctor,
your department is gonna be scaled back.

472
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:07,719
<i>Without the Gate bridge and</i>

473
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:11,331
with the need to keep at least one ship
in orbit for defensive purposes,

474
00:30:11,491 --> 00:30:14,684
resupply is going to be difficult.
We need to prioritize.

475
00:30:15,102 --> 00:30:17,771
I don't understand this.
I'm already understaffed as it is.

476
00:30:18,031 --> 00:30:20,941
Because you've overextended yourself
with all these humanitarian efforts,

477
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:24,486
<i>and your continued attempts
to find an antidote for the Hoffan drug.</i>

478
00:30:24,746 --> 00:30:26,850
Once you have refocused
your attention back

479
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,223
to the medical needs of this base
and its personnel,

480
00:30:30,543 --> 00:30:32,285
I don't think you'll have a problem.

481
00:30:32,545 --> 00:30:35,544
Wait a second,
people are dying out there.

482
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:38,704
I know,

483
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:40,874
and believe me, if I thought

484
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:44,047
there was anything I could do about it,
I would.

485
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,258
What about Michael?

486
00:30:46,518 --> 00:30:49,981
Michael knows the defensive capabilities
of this base and our ships.

487
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:54,095
The IOA thinks it's highly unlikely
he will launch an unprovoked attack.

488
00:30:54,255 --> 00:30:55,183
<i>So that's it?</i>

489
00:30:55,443 --> 00:30:57,894
We're supposed to just stand back
and let him take over the Galaxy?

490
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:01,930
How many more of our own people
have to die, Doctor?

491
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:07,487
Colonel Sheppard, Colonel Carter,
Ronon, Teyla, they were your friends.

492
00:31:07,828 --> 00:31:09,364
Sheppard is not dead.

493
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:10,717
Right.

494
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:14,832
He's just been transported 48,000 years
into the future.

495
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:19,312
I guess that makes him
one of the lucky ones.

496
00:31:27,056 --> 00:31:29,028
<i>The idea of standing by
and doing nothing</i>

497
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:31,290
<i>while the rest of the galaxy
was suffering</i>

498
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,531
<i>was too much for Jennifer to take.</i>

499
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:37,559
<i>The more I thought about it,</i>

500
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:40,163
<i>the more I realized she was right.</i>

501
00:31:41,224 --> 00:31:43,236
If you've come here to try
and convince me to stay,

502
00:31:43,396 --> 00:31:45,025
you're wasting your time.

503
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,599
- I already made up my mind.
- No.

504
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,405
I've come here to tell you
I'm leaving, too.

505
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,919
<i>We had three weeks on the Daedalus
with nothing else to think about</i>

506
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,123
<i>but everything that had happened.</i>

507
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,532
<i>We went over it a thousand times,
trying to imagine</i>

508
00:32:01,692 --> 00:32:04,820
<i>what we might have done differently.
It was awful.</i>

509
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,633
<i>At least we had each other.</i>

510
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,609
<i>By the time
we got back to Earth, well...</i>

511
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:17,205
<i>We weren't just colleagues anymore.</i>

512
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:27,359
Wait a minute, you and Keller?

513
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:29,152
Why do you find that so surprising?

514
00:32:29,412 --> 00:32:32,581
I'm just saying, if we start monkeying
with this timeline here,

515
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:34,991
there's no guarantee
it's gonna turn out the same.

516
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:36,576
That's what I'm counting on.

517
00:32:36,836 --> 00:32:38,995
You survived, you got the girl,
doesn't sound bad.

518
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:40,341
No...

519
00:32:40,842 --> 00:32:42,624
No, at first, it was great.

520
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:46,025
<i>I got a high-paying job
with an aerospace engineering firm.</i>

521
00:32:46,185 --> 00:32:48,296
<i>Jennifer started her own practice.</i>

522
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:51,284
<i>Things were just starting
to come together.</i>

523
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:04,276
<i>We should've known
we wouldn't get off so easy.</i>

524
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:10,370
I'm sorry to say,
but all her internal organs are failing.

525
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:14,558
<i>Of course, no regular doctor
could diagnose what was wrong with her.</i>

526
00:33:14,718 --> 00:33:18,671
<i>We wound up back at Stargate Command,
less than a year after we'd left.</i>

527
00:33:19,842 --> 00:33:23,313
<i>Complications due to repeated exposure
to the Hoffan drug.</i>

528
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:24,953
<i>No cure.</i>

529
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:38,493
<i>I thought I was gonna lose my mind.</i>

530
00:33:38,653 --> 00:33:40,433
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

531
00:33:40,593 --> 00:33:44,613
<i>After everything we'd been through,
to have this happen, it was too much.</i>

532
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:51,185
<i>And that's when I had my idea.</i>

533
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:02,182
- Where have you been?
- I've been working.

534
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:05,271
- Working? On what?
- The solution, to everything.

535
00:34:05,431 --> 00:34:06,708
You, this, all of this.

536
00:34:06,968 --> 00:34:09,811
I mean, Atlantis, Pegasus,
Michael, everything.

537
00:34:10,654 --> 00:34:13,493
- What are you talking about?
- I'm gonna change the timeline.

538
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:16,241
I'm gonna make it so none ever happened.
I mean, you won't get sick,

539
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:19,054
Teyla won't die, Michael won't complete
his research, none of it.

540
00:34:19,314 --> 00:34:21,890
- Oh, Rodney...
- I already worked out the basic plan.

541
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:25,518
Details will be a bit more complicated.
I'll have to create a new form of math

542
00:34:25,778 --> 00:34:27,664
to do the calculations,
but I know I can do it.

543
00:34:27,824 --> 00:34:29,413
What's done is done.

544
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:32,817
You can't change the past.

545
00:34:33,077 --> 00:34:36,112
You can. I can, and I'm going to,
even if it takes the rest of my life.

546
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:42,683
You think that's what I want?

547
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:44,653
Well, why not?

548
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:50,384
The year I spent in Atlantis, I...

549
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:56,395
I saw more things
than people even dream about

550
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:58,098
in their lifetime.

551
00:35:02,327 --> 00:35:04,904
- I don't have any regrets.
- Well, I do.

552
00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:07,602
I've got a whole boat-load of them,

553
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:10,249
- and I want to do something about it.
- No.

554
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:12,107
<i>Just promise me</i>

555
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:15,623
that you're not gonna waste
the rest of your life chasing

556
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:17,696
after something that's already gone.

557
00:35:19,488 --> 00:35:21,307
<i>But I couldn't let it go.</i>

558
00:35:23,938 --> 00:35:26,143
<i>She died three days later.</i>

559
00:35:30,404 --> 00:35:31,824
<i>I quit the research firm,</i>

560
00:35:31,984 --> 00:35:35,306
<i><i>took a job teaching physics
at a local community college.</i></i>

561
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,729
<i>Not much money,</i>

562
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:39,107
<i>but it gave me the free time I needed.</i>

563
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:46,880
<i>I'll admit it wasn't much of a life.</i>

564
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,636
<i>Jeanie came by every once in a while
to check up on me.</i>

565
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:55,640
<i>When she realized she wasn't
gonna be able to convince me to stop,</i>

566
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,236
<i>she decided to pitch in
and help me with the calculations.</i>

567
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,012
<i>But eventually, even she got fed up.</i>

568
00:36:07,453 --> 00:36:08,496
<i>I never wavered.</i>

569
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:16,269
<i>Years went by. 25 years to be exact...</i>

570
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:23,103
<i>And suddenly, I had it.</i>

571
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:27,254
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

572
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:29,481
<i>I needed to get back to Atlantis.</i>

573
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:33,642
<i>I didn't have a lot of friends
at Stargate Command,</i>

574
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:36,067
<i>but I only needed one.</i>

575
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:38,526
Dr. McKay, good to see you.

576
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:41,487
- General Lorne.
- Come on in, have a seat.

577
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:45,839
I...

578
00:36:46,776 --> 00:36:48,180
I read your proposal.

579
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,618
You didn't tell anyone else, did you?

580
00:36:50,778 --> 00:36:52,874
I'm not quite as stupid
as you might think, Doc,

581
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:55,418
but I'm sorry,

582
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:58,370
there's just no way I'd ever be able
to get this authorized.

583
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,466
Well, then don't.
You don't have to tell them what it is.

584
00:37:01,726 --> 00:37:04,459
<i>Tell them it's a research project.
Tell them whatever the hell you want.</i>

585
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:05,625
Rodney...

586
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:08,848
You're talking about
altering the timeline here.

587
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,415
<i>Changing history. Changing everything.</i>

588
00:37:13,154 --> 00:37:15,772
Do you really think that either of us
has the right to make that call?

589
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:17,688
Let's cut to the chase.

590
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:20,306
You saw what happened in Pegasus.

591
00:37:20,466 --> 00:37:22,430
You know what's happening here.

592
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,762
You really think this is the way
it's supposed to be?

593
00:37:28,964 --> 00:37:30,871
<i>Maybe he felt sorry for me. Maybe...</i>

594
00:37:31,131 --> 00:37:34,165
he figured it wasn't gonna work,
but he let me through.

595
00:37:34,802 --> 00:37:36,248
The rest you know.

596
00:37:37,529 --> 00:37:38,535
Well,

597
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:42,215
I guess I've had a tough day,
but you've had a tough 25 years.

598
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:45,675
Okay,

599
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,411
we're ready.

600
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:54,477
Now, if this works,

601
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,213
I'll be waiting right here
when you come out.

602
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:00,400
We don't have much time to get you to
the Gate, but I think we can manage it.

603
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:04,445
- And if it doesn't work?
- Well, you won't feel a thing.

604
00:38:04,605 --> 00:38:06,948
Basically, you just won't wake up.

605
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:09,544
Right.

606
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:16,249
In the past 25 years, you happen
to notice who won the Superbowl?

607
00:38:17,149 --> 00:38:18,335
I'm afraid not.

608
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:22,839
Stanley cup? World series?

609
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,510
- I was never really a sports fan.
- Right. I had to ask.

610
00:38:31,024 --> 00:38:32,368
Good luck, John.

611
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:50,995
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation!</i>

612
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,999
What have you got?

613
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:57,016
Receiving IDC.

614
00:38:57,847 --> 00:38:59,194
It's Colonel Sheppard.

615
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:00,916
Lower the shield.

616
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:05,820
Security!

617
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:20,720
- John...
- Colonel.

618
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:25,777
It worked. It worked.
Rodney, you're a genius.

619
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:28,873
- Okay.
- John, what happened?

620
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,283
- How much time has gone by?
- 12 days.

621
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,852
12 days... okay.
She wouldn't have had her baby yet.

622
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:36,329
Look, I know this sounds kinda weird,
but we're on the clock.

623
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:40,292
- John, what are you talking about?
- I know where Teyla is.

624
00:39:49,477 --> 00:39:51,178
We don't have time for this.

625
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:53,700
There are procedures
we have to follow, you know that.

626
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,931
I am not a clone.

627
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:57,517
No, your medical came back clean,
telemeres and all,

628
00:39:57,777 --> 00:40:00,019
but there are other things
we need to discuss.

629
00:40:00,282 --> 00:40:03,068
You have to admit, this is a
pretty wild story, even for this place.

630
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:05,454
But that's my whole point.
How could I make this up?

631
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:08,194
<i>Sam, believe it or not, I found it.</i>

632
00:40:08,454 --> 00:40:11,199
It was in the sensor logs. It's a solar
flare capable of interfering

633
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:12,866
with the wormhole from M4S-587,

634
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,784
<i>at exactly the moment that he dialed.</i>

635
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:17,412
Why didn't the Gate's failsafe
prevent the wormhole from locking?

636
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:22,083
Well, we've had a number of glitches
since we last updated

637
00:40:22,343 --> 00:40:24,169
- <i>the operating system.</i>
- A glitch?

638
00:40:24,813 --> 00:40:27,293
Yes, well, you should know

639
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:29,378
that I'll be giving Zelenka
a stern talking-to.

640
00:40:29,538 --> 00:40:30,778
Can we go now?

641
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,821
Look,

642
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,710
I know you've already been debriefed
about the future events,

643
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:49,290
all the things we're hoping to avoid,
but there's just

644
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,780
- one more thing I need to know.
- What?

645
00:40:52,137 --> 00:40:53,901
Do I still have hair?

646
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:57,139
No. Let's go.

647
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,095
- <i>Rodney, you got anything?</i>
- Hold on.

648
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,218
Yeah...

649
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,986
Yeah, I've got
some kind of a data terminal.

650
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:33,739
I'll see if I can power it up
and hack in.

651
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:40,410
This is it.
This is where they found her.

652
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,326
- How do you know?
- Because he described it to me.

653
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,476
Look at this.

654
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:58,430
- <i>McKay, we got something.</i>
- What is it?

655
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:01,182
<i>Some twisted version
of a maternity ward.</i>

656
00:42:01,817 --> 00:42:04,394
I think we're too early, though,
but he's gonna bring her here.

657
00:42:04,654 --> 00:42:06,146
Hold on, I'm in.

658
00:42:08,591 --> 00:42:09,357
Jackpot.

659
00:42:09,617 --> 00:42:11,610
- What have you got?
- I've got Gate addresses,

660
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,233
I've communication codes,

661
00:42:13,393 --> 00:42:16,156
I've even got his research
into the hybrids. He's history.

662
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:19,409
No, no, no, what happened?

663
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:21,720
What's that?

664
00:42:22,157 --> 00:42:24,218
- Oh, no...
- Doc?

665
00:42:24,682 --> 00:42:25,749
It's a countdown.

666
00:42:28,052 --> 00:42:31,226
Colonel, it's a boobytrap.
We've got to get out of here, now!
