1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,726
Come on, dude, one more round.

2
00:00:05,846 --> 00:00:06,896
Nope, I can't.

3
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:10,263
We don't have to do 18.
We can do nine, easy course, par three.

4
00:00:10,383 --> 00:00:12,046
Nope, Katie's expecting me.

5
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,479
Well, be late.
Women like it when guys are late.

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,888
No, they don't, and I can't be late.
Not for this lunch.

7
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:18,778
- Why's that?
- Can you keep a secret?

8
00:00:18,898 --> 00:00:20,142
- No.
- Right.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,367
I got this...

10
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:25,080
on my last trip to Earth.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,251
I feel it's time that Katie and I move
the relationship to the next level, so.

12
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:30,132
- Second base?
- No. Marriage.

13
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,460
- Really? You?
- Yes. Yes.

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,577
Married?

15
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:35,838
You don't think I'm ready?
You think I'm rushing things?

16
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,760
- I didn't say that.
- Well, I'm not...

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,167
- ready to set a date or anything, but--
- Is this a diamond?

18
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:41,419
<i>Eighth of a carat.</i>

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,463
Conflict free,
and I got a good deal, actually.

20
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,256
I'm sure you did.

21
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,660
All right, so...

22
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:48,399
here I go.

23
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:52,010
Well, I'll buy you a beer later,
we can celebrate.

24
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,015
Yeah, or drown my sorrows,
should she say no.

25
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:55,558
No, no. None of that.

26
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:00,563
Well, go get the girl.

27
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,173
- Rodney...
- Can't talk.

28
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,610
John.

29
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,867
Do you have a moment to talk?

30
00:01:13,788 --> 00:01:15,303
Another sparring accident?

31
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:17,427
Actually, I slipped in the shower.

32
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:19,956
- Oh, really?
- Nah. Sparring accident.

33
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:24,171
This is the third time this week
I've had to patch you up.

34
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,847
You know,

35
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:28,915
there are a lot of other ways
you can spend your free time.

36
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:31,105
Not as much fun, though.

37
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:36,397
- Hi, Colonel.
- Doctor, where are you headed?

38
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:38,805
- Control room.
- Ooh, me too. We can share.

39
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:39,955
Splendid.

40
00:01:41,796 --> 00:01:43,485
- Katie?
- I'm in here!

41
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,202
Great. Awesome.

42
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:47,677
<i>- Hope you're hungry.</i>
- Oh, I am.

43
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:49,112
<i>Yeah, me too, very hungry.</i>

44
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:51,296
Hungry, hungry, hungry.

45
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:53,199
Are you all right?

46
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:54,889
I'm fine.

47
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:56,218
Yeah.

48
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:57,579
Wow, this is much more...

49
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:01,124
- You're sweating.
- Oh, am I?

50
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:03,738
I suppose I am. Okay...

51
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,629
I guess I should...
jump right into this.

52
00:02:07,184 --> 00:02:08,992
You know, rip the band-aid off,
as they say.

53
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:11,968
Not that this is painful in any way.
It's quite the opposite, actually.

54
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:13,511
Rodney, what's wrong?

55
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:15,997
It's nothing.
In fact, everything's right...

56
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,515
with us, I mean.

57
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:21,644
So I was thinking... and I don't know
about you, but the way I see it,

58
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:23,724
I thought that maybe...

59
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,106
it's time that we...

60
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:27,066
you know, start

61
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:28,964
entertaining the notion...

62
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,778
What happened?

63
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,977
Why'd the doors close?

64
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:49,552
Rodney,

65
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,127
what's going on?

66
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:52,799
It's locked.

67
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:55,087
We're trapped.

68
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:01,286
The Teams Projet-SG & SG-66

69
00:03:05,611 --> 00:03:09,041
present:

70
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:13,738
Season 4 Episode 13
Quarantine (v. 1.0)

76
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,312
We're locked in.

77
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:11,457
Rodney, come in.

78
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,265
This one's locked, too.

79
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:16,682
What the hell's going on here?

80
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:20,263
Dr. McKay, this is Dr. Keller.
Are you there?

81
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:22,526
Rodney, this is Sam, do you read?

82
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:26,519
The control mechanism
is not responding.

83
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,897
Perhaps I can physically
open the door.

84
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,650
Transporter doors are lighter, not
as heavy as other doors in the City...

85
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:41,726
Rodney, this is Sam, please respond.

86
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,424
Colonel Sheppard, do you read?

87
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:46,422
- Are you getting anything?
- No.

88
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:47,992
Communications must be down.

89
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:48,949
Oh, great.

90
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:51,894
All right, I'm going to need a radio.
I left mine in my lab.

91
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:53,068
Radio?

92
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:55,602
- In there.
- What do you mean?

93
00:04:55,722 --> 00:04:58,324
- What, you don't have a radio in here?
- It's a plant cultivation room.

94
00:04:58,444 --> 00:05:00,419
- We haven't needed one.
- Well, we need one now.

95
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,668
- That alarm was a quarantine lockdown.
- Quarantine?

96
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:04,843
Atlantis' self-protection
against another outbreak.

97
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:07,650
It's sealing off sections of the City
to prevent the spread of a disease.

98
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,218
I... tweaked the...

99
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:11,272
system after the recent
Kirsan Fever outbreak.

100
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:13,287
But there was no lockdown

101
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:15,275
- during that outbreak.
<i>- Well, hence the need</i>

102
00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:17,826
to tweak the system, you know,
institute more vigorous protocols.

103
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:20,341
I need to get to a computer,
assess the degree of the situation.

104
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:22,554
Is this just a few sections
that have been sealed off,

105
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:24,720
or maybe the whole tower...

106
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,770
Computer's in the other room,
isn't it?

107
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,874
With the radio.

108
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:35,179
There must be another
disease outbreak.

109
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,441
McKay said he was going to
modify the quarantine system

110
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,360
to make it more efficient.

111
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,795
How does cutting off the radios
make it more efficient?

112
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:45,598
Obviously there's
a glitch in the program.

113
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,874
Problem is, without communications, he
can't tell me how bad the outbreak is,

114
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:51,577
or give me the passcodes to

115
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:53,825
open whichever doors are deemed safe.

116
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:54,945
Ah. Great.

117
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:59,604
Well, in any case, I should be
ready to treat the sick

118
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:01,498
when they bring them in.
Will you help me?

119
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:02,907
Tell me what to do.

120
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:06,455
I could really use Ronon's gun
right about now.

121
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,178
<i>John, look.</i>

122
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:09,315
What?

123
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:12,558
It appears there's been
another outbreak.

124
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,175
What is a category five?

125
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:21,175
I'm guessing it's a lot worse
than categories one through four.

126
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:24,093
We could be here a while.

127
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:29,632
What?

128
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:32,594
It's just that every time one of these
things happens in the movies,

129
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:34,495
the pregnant woman goes into labor.

130
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:36,242
I am still a long way from my due date.

131
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,645
Yeah, it's the same thing in the movies,
and then... wham!

132
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,095
Relax, John. I will be fine.

133
00:06:40,215 --> 00:06:41,974
- Why don't you sit down?
- I am all right.

134
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:45,199
You know, just to be on the safe side...
Let's sit down.

135
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:47,956
<i>Let's see what else we can find out.</i>

136
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:52,676
Quarantine lockdown.

137
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:54,744
Yes.

138
00:06:55,654 --> 00:06:59,054
Well, I don't know why communications
would be affected.

139
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,291
Rodney did say he was going to
modify some of the Ancient protocols.

140
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:04,427
<i>He made a mistake,</i>

141
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:07,597
made the security measures
a little too aggressive?

142
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,981
We need to try to access the mainframe.

143
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:13,606
Yes, but unfortunately,
that's all you'll be able to do.

144
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:15,264
This tablet has limited RAM.

145
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:17,556
It's configured mainly for read-only
field diagnostics.

146
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:20,296
Well, we should at least be able
to determine the extent of the lockdown.

147
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,693
Yes. Oh, sorry.

148
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:25,068
That's one of my pigeons.

149
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:27,328
I raise them, as... as a hobby.

150
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,488
Back home.

151
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:31,512
Let's see what we have here.

152
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:39,525
You comfortable? You want anything?
You want to lie down, eat?

153
00:07:40,615 --> 00:07:42,885
This is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

154
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:43,805
What?

155
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:47,595
Your decision to remove me
from the team's missions.

156
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:49,365
We're not gonna go through this again.

157
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:51,557
No, no, no, it's all right.
I understand.

158
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,412
It's not permanent.
You're just going to have to ease off,

159
00:07:54,532 --> 00:07:58,117
then you have your baby, and,
in a few months, you're back in action.

160
00:07:58,894 --> 00:07:59,894
Will I be?

161
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:04,956
If it is wrong to place myself
and my unborn child in danger now,

162
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:06,989
will it be any less
to do so when he is born?

163
00:08:08,465 --> 00:08:11,645
John, it's bad enough that my son
may grow up without a father,

164
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:14,065
but if I were to be hurt or killed,

165
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:17,241
he would be left without
a mother as well.

166
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:20,744
It's tough. I know.

167
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,665
A friend from college,

168
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:24,485
she's a cop. Three kids.

169
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:28,114
She goes through this every day
when she goes to work.

170
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:30,634
How does she make peace with herself?

171
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:33,917
Well, she figures
she's fighting bad guys,

172
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:35,673
keeping them off the streets, so

173
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:39,458
not only is she protecting her kids,
she's protecting other kids too.

174
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:43,806
Look...

175
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:46,097
you have to understand...

176
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,297
your child has a family here,

177
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:51,701
in case anything ever happens.

178
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,660
Category five?

179
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,874
The entire City?

180
00:09:01,994 --> 00:09:03,574
This disease spreads more rapidly

181
00:09:03,694 --> 00:09:06,415
- than anything I've ever encountered.
- Something's wrong.

182
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:07,658
Look at the levels.

183
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:09,884
Primary and secondary systems...

184
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:12,054
look, wild fluctuations in every sector.

185
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:14,363
Other systems are down, too,
not just communications.

186
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:17,661
Long-range scanners are out,
ventilation in several areas,

187
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:19,386
including this tower.

188
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:22,532
Oh, oh, and plumbing, too... oh, dear.

189
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:26,252
It's like the City's entire
operating system is on the fritz.

190
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:29,599
Oh, this may not even be an outbreak
at all. This entire lockdown

191
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,532
could be the result of a malfunction.

192
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:34,328
<i>Don't worry, I'm sure McKay is
sitting at a workstation,</i>

193
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,548
<i>fixing this problem as we speak.</i>

194
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:43,696
I'm sure others are working
on the problem.

195
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,817
Dr. Keller,

196
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:45,968
Dr. Zelenka,

197
00:09:46,663 --> 00:09:47,734
Colonel Carter...

198
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,258
Oh, they'd better be.

199
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,683
You tore your stitches.

200
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:06,943
Honestly, I don't think I've ever met
anyone with such reckless aggression.

201
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,876
That's not a compliment.

202
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:12,196
If you say so.

203
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:13,616
Lay down.

204
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,427
Okay, look, I don't think
we're going to have any luck

205
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:23,643
opening those doors on our own.

206
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:26,849
We're probably just better off waiting
for McKay and the others to

207
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:29,234
figure out what needs to be done and

208
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:31,550
which doors are even safe to open.

209
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:34,679
- We're supposed to sit here and wait?
- Yes.

210
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:37,106
And be ready at a moment's notice to

211
00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:38,349
treat the sick.

212
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:41,717
I'm not very good
at sitting and waiting.

213
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:42,937
No kidding.

214
00:10:44,364 --> 00:10:46,232
Well, maybe we could pass the time by

215
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:48,150
getting to know each other better.

216
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:52,697
What do you have in mind?

217
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,204
Oh! I... I mean, I didn't...

218
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:58,622
You know, I meant just, like, talk.

219
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:00,246
I didn't mean...

220
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:04,359
Yeah, so, anyway...

221
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:07,721
Let's talk.

222
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:22,310
Can't you fiddle with this thing
and get the door open?

223
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,982
I could fiddle with it, sure.

224
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:26,139
As to actually getting
the door open, not a chance.

225
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:29,423
The quarantine protocol completely
disables the doors' control mechanisms.

226
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:31,986
The whole point of it is
to keep people from getting out.

227
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:33,726
Oh, it's going to be okay.

228
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:36,188
- Dr. Keller and Zelenka...
- We don't know that.

229
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:38,034
We have no idea
if it's going to be okay.

230
00:11:38,154 --> 00:11:40,748
For all we know, Zelenka and Keller
could already be infected.

231
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,295
We don't even know how much
of the City is in quarantine.

232
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:45,546
This is serious, we have
no reason to believe otherwise,

233
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,135
- we look at a City-wide lockdown.
- You're thinking in the worst-case.

234
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:51,716
Hello! This is what I do.
Someone needs to think ahead

235
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,967
to the worst possible situation
in order to properly defend against it.

236
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:56,927
Any situation?
Even the good ones?

237
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:58,523
Hey, it doesn't take much for a

238
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:00,139
good situation to turn ugly.

239
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,046
One minute, you're happily riding
your bicycle back from

240
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,375
acing your Lagrangian mechanics
mid-term, you know, the

241
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:08,388
warm breeze in your face, and next,
you're flying 'cause you hit a pothole.

242
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:10,569
Oh, Rodney, did that happen to you?

243
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,546
The point is, one must
always be on guard,

244
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,695
always looking out for the potholes.
Now, you can

245
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,446
call me a catastrophist, but it's a...

246
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:19,263
it's a necessary burden I bear.

247
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:21,554
A mindset like that,

248
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,369
<i>and a person would live in a
constant state of worry and fear.</i>

249
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,364
You forgot despair.

250
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:34,735
Well, it's definitely a malfunction,

251
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,225
and surprisingly,
it's nothing Rodney did.

252
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:39,939
Look at that. I'm reading
a sudden spike in power caused by

253
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,811
an intense ionospheric
storm earlier today.

254
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,851
This new planet continues
to surprise us.

255
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:48,462
It is going to require
some drastic recalibration to

256
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:50,481
account for any future
ionospheric activity.

257
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:53,097
Well, first things first.
We need to get to a workstation

258
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:56,221
- and fix this malfunction.
- Yes. I agree.

259
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:02,216
I'm a little bit puzzled as to why
Rodney hasn't solved this problem yet.

260
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:04,135
He's been a little off his game lately.

261
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:06,445
Maybe he doesn't have
access to a computer.

262
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:08,571
Rodney? Without his computer?

263
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:11,754
- This I have yet to witness.
- Well, whatever the cause,

264
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,921
since there's no outbreak,
there's no reason

265
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:15,589
to be stuck in here.

266
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:18,571
Well, yes, other than the doors
being sealed shut.

267
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:21,554
And heavier than we had
previously thought.

268
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:24,917
Can you use this tablet
to access this control panel?

269
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:27,745
Maybe we can at least figure out
a way to get the doors open.

270
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:31,372
Doubtful. The transporter panel has
no wireless interface, and

271
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:34,066
even if we could hook it up directly,
with the limitations of the RAM

272
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:36,126
- on this tablet...
- May I?

273
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:38,571
- Thanks.
- Yes. Of course.

274
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:40,876
Well, lifesigns all over the City.

275
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:42,783
Everyone is trapped as we are.

276
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:46,443
Ventilation is down, which means
we're running out of air.

277
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:52,209
He's in the botany lab.

278
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:53,469
- Who?
- Rodney.

279
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:56,139
He went to pick up
Katie Brown for a lunch date.

280
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:57,784
Have you been in that plant room?

281
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,384
- There's no computers, no radio...
- If he's locked in there...

282
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:02,344
He's going to be freaking.

283
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:10,853
Are you all right?

284
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,819
I don't know. I feel...

285
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:14,138
a little dizzy,

286
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:15,551
a little feverish.

287
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:16,484
Here.

288
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:20,909
Rodney, come on, sit down.

289
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:28,913
You don't feel warm.

290
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,588
Are you sure?
'Cause...

291
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:35,692
my joints ache.
It's usually the first sign of a fever.

292
00:14:37,368 --> 00:14:38,356
Pulse...

293
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,548
120?

294
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:41,148
That's normal.

295
00:14:41,695 --> 00:14:43,245
I've always had a rapid heartbeat.

296
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:46,455
Ever since I was a kid. I mean,
even when I was in a deep sleep.

297
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:49,218
Our family doctor once
wrote a paper about it.

298
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:52,450
How are you feeling?

299
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,208
I'm fine.

300
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,817
Okay, well, you let me know
when you start feeling sick, all right?

301
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:01,735
It seems as though
there was some kind of disturbance

302
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:04,117
in the planet's ionosphere
a few hours ago.

303
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,062
After that is
when the system became unstable.

304
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:08,997
New planet, new problems.

305
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,330
Well, there may not even
be a disease outbreak.

306
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,171
Yeah, and the City's still on lockdown.

307
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,459
If Rodney can't get ahold of a computer,
he's not gonna be able to shut it down.

308
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:19,197
Perhaps Dr. Zelenka
or Colonel Carter can do it.

309
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,165
If they could've,
they'd have done it already.

310
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:23,077
They probably can't
get ahold of one either.

311
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:24,344
Can anyone do it?

312
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:26,599
They'd have to know Rodney's password.

313
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:29,245
<i>Fortunately...</i>

314
00:15:29,852 --> 00:15:30,662
<i>I do.</i>

315
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:34,807
- He told you his password?
- Well, he didn't think I'd remember it.

316
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:37,893
1... 6... 4... 3...

317
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:39,428
1... 8... 7... 9...

318
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:40,926
1... 9... 6... 8...

319
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:41,858
4... 2.

320
00:15:42,768 --> 00:15:44,071
See? Doesn't take a genius.

321
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:45,684
It doesn't?

322
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:48,357
1643 is the year Isaac Newton was born.

323
00:15:48,477 --> 00:15:51,220
1879, Einstein, and 1968...

324
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,901
The year Rodney was born.

325
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:55,541
Never underestimate
the size of that man's ego.

326
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,334
Wait. Weren't there other numbers?

327
00:15:57,638 --> 00:15:58,345
42.

328
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:00,853
- What is that?
- It's the ultimate answer

329
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:03,807
to the great question
of life, the universe, and everything.

330
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:05,514
Okay.

331
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,639
We're in.

332
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:13,815
Oh, that's a good idea.

333
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:20,323
Okay, much better.

334
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:22,336
Yes. Much better.

335
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:26,513
The control panel
won't recognize authentication.

336
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,574
Because it's not configured,
as I said earlier...

337
00:16:28,694 --> 00:16:30,866
I know, which is why
I've written a workaround to free up

338
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:32,809
memory to allow for local device input.

339
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:33,662
So fast?

340
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:36,262
Well, there's obviously not enough RAM
to handle the City's entire

341
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:39,267
operating system, but we should at least
be able to open these doors.

342
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:42,421
All I need to do is get it to recognize
the authentication command.

343
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:45,215
Perhaps if you bypassed the secondary
crystals and go directly...

344
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,272
No... God, Radek!

345
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,185
They didn't open.

346
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:53,142
No.

347
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,667
And the tablet's fried.

348
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,605
Oh, crap.

349
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,627
What is it?

350
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:08,851
Part of the lockdown program
includes broadcasting an alert beacon

351
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:12,224
to approaching ships
to warn them about a disease outbreak.

352
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:13,820
The City is doing this right now?

353
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,631
Five by five, clear enough
for the entire neighborhood to pick up.

354
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:18,582
- Can you shut it off?
- Not from here.

355
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:20,896
It can only be turned off
from the subspace transmitter,

356
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:23,028
which is up in the control room,
which means

357
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:25,713
the guys upstairs either
haven't noticed it, or, more likely,

358
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,716
don't have
Rodney's password to turn it off.

359
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:31,760
As long as that signal is broadcast,
Atlantis is vulnerable to discovery.

360
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,755
If it hasn't already happened.

361
00:17:40,044 --> 00:17:41,184
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

362
00:17:41,304 --> 00:17:42,363
<i>The same.</i>

363
00:17:44,452 --> 00:17:45,164
Hey.

364
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,642
You look like
you could use some cheering up.

365
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:50,489
As a matter of fact, I could.

366
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:00,290
What is it?

367
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:02,902
It's nothing.

368
00:18:04,235 --> 00:18:05,671
Oh, hey, isn't that the...

369
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:09,177
The Rodneyana Villosa?

370
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,686
The plant I named for you.

371
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:11,600
Right.

372
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:14,180
It's grown.

373
00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:16,999
Yes, it's really flourished here.

374
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:20,893
I've... I've been kind of doting on it,
giving it a little extra TLC,

375
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:22,148
and it just...

376
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,691
just gets bigger and...

377
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:25,583
bigger...

378
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:33,824
- We need to get you to the infirmary.
- I already told you, it's impossible.

379
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:36,866
Look, the whole point of the lockdown
is to prevent the spread of the disease,

380
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:39,746
- which means no one's going anywhere.
- But how are the doctors supposed to

381
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:41,999
treat anyone if they can't reach them?

382
00:18:42,564 --> 00:18:43,857
I'm sorry, Katie.

383
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:47,671
Look, I've...
no doubt infected you by now.

384
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:49,463
But I feel fine.

385
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,426
- I'd have at least a few symptoms.
- Every disease is different.

386
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:54,901
We have no idea what the incubation
period for this strain is.

387
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:58,182
It could be hours, it could be days.
I mean, who knows when I caught it?

388
00:18:58,302 --> 00:19:01,685
No, it's just a matter of time
before you succumb too.

389
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:05,588
Anyway...

390
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,469
what were we talking about?

391
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:10,360
You were going to cheer me up.

392
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:11,698
Oh. Right.

393
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:25,866
Are you okay?

394
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:27,340
Yeah.

395
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:30,267
I just...

396
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:33,258
I don't like sitting around either.

397
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:38,933
Especially
when there's people out there who...

398
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:39,993
need me.

399
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:45,813
You're not letting them down.

400
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:49,513
There's a disease outbreak.

401
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:51,672
And I'm a doctor,

402
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,695
- stuck in this room...
- That's right.

403
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:54,904
Stuck.

404
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:58,418
It's not your fault
you can't get to them.

405
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:00,661
So don't put the blame on yourself.

406
00:20:07,446 --> 00:20:09,918
You remind me of someone I used to know.

407
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:14,007
She put way too much
pressure on herself.

408
00:20:18,189 --> 00:20:19,461
Someone from...

409
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:21,258
Sateda?

410
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,887
Yeah.

411
00:20:27,946 --> 00:20:29,230
Who was she?

412
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,760
She... she was someone I cared about.

413
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:37,295
She was killed during the siege.

414
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:43,328
I'm sorry.

415
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,717
I wanted her to leave,

416
00:20:47,305 --> 00:20:49,585
but she chose to stay behind
and help the others.

417
00:20:57,733 --> 00:20:59,440
Should've forced her to go.

418
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:03,736
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

419
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:06,043
She chose to stay.

420
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,231
Don't put that blame on yourself.

421
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,339
No.

422
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:19,914
Come on.

423
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:21,469
<i>Nothing's working.</i>

424
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:24,027
Okay, on to plan "B".

425
00:21:24,364 --> 00:21:25,164
<i>Which is?</i>

426
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,497
Which is blast our way outta here

427
00:21:27,658 --> 00:21:29,207
<i>and get to the control room.</i>

428
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,187
Start searching for any explosives
Rodney might've left.

429
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:34,588
Well, I doubt that he would...

430
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:42,387
- Don't tell me that you're...
- The baby just kicked.

431
00:21:42,795 --> 00:21:43,646
Really?

432
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:46,015
There it is again. Here.

433
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:54,521
Little guy wants to get
out of here as much as we do.

434
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:00,447
Teyla? You okay?

435
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,603
Just hang in there. I'm going to get
everybody out of here.

436
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,458
- You stand back.
- What are you...

437
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:24,004
John, what are you doing?

438
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:26,222
The control room is only
4 floors above us.

439
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:28,058
All I have to do is climb up,
and I'm in.

440
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:29,536
Climb the tower?

441
00:22:29,656 --> 00:22:31,214
Is that even possible?

442
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:33,833
Sure! Batman did it all the time.

443
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:38,276
Piece of cake.

444
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:41,135
Don't worry.
I'll be fine.

445
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:43,532
I'll turn off that beacon.

446
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:27,405
I'm sorry, I honestly thought that
if we bypassed the secondary crystal...

447
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:30,952
Radek, I know, we've been through this.
I'm not angry with you.

448
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:39,546
We could really use
one of your pigeons around now.

449
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:43,131
- Well, they're not for eating.
- No, no, I meant, you know,

450
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:44,259
to get help.

451
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:47,484
Like homing pigeons.

452
00:23:47,604 --> 00:23:50,992
You attach a little SOS note
to their feet, and "boop!"

453
00:23:51,112 --> 00:23:53,625
- Yeah, but there's no window in here.
- I know, I was just...

454
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:24,048
Okay, I got ventilation
restored to most of the tower.

455
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:28,029
Still working on getting air up here,
but so far nothing's responding.

456
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:33,118
- Colonel! How did you get out there?
- Long story.

457
00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:35,767
We've got to turn off the beacon
that's broadcasting our location

458
00:25:35,887 --> 00:25:38,165
- to every ship in the neighborhood.
- We already tried that.

459
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:41,001
<i>- It's password protected.
- What happened?</i>

460
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:44,355
<i>Colonel, where the hell
did you come from?</i>

461
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:45,656
<i>Beacon's deactivated.</i>

462
00:25:55,165 --> 00:25:57,452
The computers just shut down.
All of them.

463
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:59,728
- Is that the...
- Self-destruct.

464
00:26:05,978 --> 00:26:09,204
- That's the self-destruct sequence!
- Why would anybody arm it?

465
00:26:09,324 --> 00:26:11,092
More importantly,
how much time do we have?

466
00:26:11,212 --> 00:26:13,820
I don't know,
whoever arms it designates the duration,

467
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,009
you know,
depending on how quick he wants to...

468
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:17,371
blow up the City.

469
00:26:19,532 --> 00:26:20,896
The hell with this.

470
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:22,287
<i>Ronon...</i>

471
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:27,750
<i>Ronon! We've already tried.
It's not going to open.</i>

472
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,623
We'll just have to blast a hole in it.

473
00:26:29,743 --> 00:26:32,469
<i>- With what? You don't have your gun.</i>
- You got any C-4 in here?

474
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:34,179
In the infirmary?

475
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:37,349
Anything we could use
to act as an explosive?

476
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:39,121
I don't know...

477
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:42,742
the oxygen tanks, maybe?

478
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:44,461
Right!

479
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:48,052
Shoot 'em like Sheriff Brody did...
in the movie Jaws.

480
00:26:50,673 --> 00:26:53,278
Yeah, I know, I've seen it.
How do you...

481
00:26:53,957 --> 00:26:56,464
Sheppard showed it to me.
It's a good movie.

482
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,352
Flammable.

483
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:01,402
All right.
All we need is a gun to shoot it with.

484
00:27:01,522 --> 00:27:02,730
You got one in here?

485
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,937
Again, infirmary, not armory.

486
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,695
I don't get it.
Why would you arm the self-destruct?

487
00:27:08,815 --> 00:27:09,903
I didn't.

488
00:27:12,027 --> 00:27:13,809
Finally.
You shut it down?

489
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:15,694
No, just the alarm.

490
00:27:16,118 --> 00:27:18,431
The City actually armed
the self-destruct by itself, Major.

491
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:19,646
Why?

492
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:22,435
Last thing I saw on the screen
was a "breach of quarantine" alert.

493
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:27,765
My coming into the room caused the City
to think the disease has spread.

494
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:30,162
But you said earlier
that there was no outbreak.

495
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,091
No, there isn't.
The City doesn't know that.

496
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:34,030
<i>It's all part of
the system-wide malfunction.</i>

497
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,674
The City must think there's a disease,
and now it's out of control...

498
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:40,078
So blowing up Atlantis
is its final countermeasure.

499
00:27:40,646 --> 00:27:42,891
Did you see how much time was left
on the self-destruct?

500
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:45,499
No, computers shut down
before I could see.

501
00:27:50,357 --> 00:27:51,324
All right.

502
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,648
If we can't shut it down from here,

503
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:56,502
- we have to turn it off at the source.
- That's in the main power room.

504
00:27:56,622 --> 00:27:58,262
- 6 levels down.
<i>- We can't get there.</i>

505
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:01,224
The Jumper room's sealed off, as every
other corridor out of the Gate room.

506
00:28:01,494 --> 00:28:02,973
I'll just have to climb back down.

507
00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:05,708
It's in the center of the tower.
Even if you climbed back down,

508
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:09,058
you'd still have to get through several
sealed doors before reaching it.

509
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:10,612
You got any C-4?

510
00:28:11,285 --> 00:28:12,781
Yeah, a little bit.

511
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:13,971
That's it?

512
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:15,244
That's it.

513
00:28:16,242 --> 00:28:17,615
You two, with us.

514
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:20,772
The alarm turned off.

515
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:23,158
That's a good sign, right?

516
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:24,596
I don't know.

517
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:27,603
Maybe someone found
a cure for the disease,

518
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:29,918
or at least figured out
how to turn off the self-destruct.

519
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:32,797
Or maybe someone just
figured out how to turn off the alarm.

520
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:35,480
I have to lie down.

521
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:37,755
Rodney,

522
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,275
you can't give up.

523
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,556
You have to keep fighting.

524
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:43,850
<i>I know it looks bleak, but...</i>

525
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,604
What's this?

526
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:53,000
That's...

527
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,069
when I...

528
00:28:54,229 --> 00:28:55,621
<i>came here today... I was...</i>

529
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:57,072
<i>I was gonna propose...</i>

530
00:28:58,579 --> 00:29:00,466
ask your hand in marriage...

531
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:12,462
- This is not gonna work.
- What are you talking about?

532
00:29:12,622 --> 00:29:13,762
This was your idea.

533
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,548
Yeah, after which I immediately said

534
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:17,592
there was a one-in-a-million
chance it'd work.

535
00:29:18,304 --> 00:29:20,178
Yeah, well... this is that one.

536
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:22,346
If I cut more
than a millimeter too far...

537
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:23,723
The tank'll blow. I know.

538
00:29:24,204 --> 00:29:26,174
So just make sure you don't cut too far.

539
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:28,570
Just score it, like you said.

540
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:31,564
Okay, look. If you don't do it,
I'm gonna do it.

541
00:29:33,142 --> 00:29:34,601
Come on. Grab this.

542
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:30,173
Okay. That's it.

543
00:30:30,293 --> 00:30:31,526
I mean, that's...

544
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:33,502
that's as far as I should go.

545
00:30:33,622 --> 00:30:34,793
All right.

546
00:30:35,691 --> 00:30:36,862
Let's do it.

547
00:31:01,032 --> 00:31:02,482
All right. You ready?

548
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,222
No.

549
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:16,724
You okay?

550
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:18,426
Yeah.

551
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:19,928
All right.

552
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,469
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

553
00:31:29,384 --> 00:31:31,364
It's a lot stronger than a shark.

554
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,884
Fire in the hole.

555
00:31:46,526 --> 00:31:47,762
That was close.

556
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,940
- Hello? Hey!
- Hey!

557
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,414
- We're in here!
- In here!

558
00:31:53,926 --> 00:31:55,100
Do you hear that?

559
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:57,609
The transporter. Somebody's in there.

560
00:31:59,198 --> 00:32:00,321
Grab a side.

561
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:11,474
- Colonel. You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

562
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:13,101
I'm fine too.

563
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:16,811
There's no outbreak.
It's just a malfunction.

564
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:17,981
We know.

565
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:19,649
Rodney disabled the self-destruct?

566
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:22,611
No, it's still armed,
and I haven't heard from Rodney.

567
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:24,985
<i>- I need to get to a workstation.</i>
- Computers are down.

568
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:28,074
We're trying to get to the power room
so we can physically cut the power.

569
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:31,494
But all the doors are sealed shut.
We just used our last C-4 getting here.

570
00:32:31,654 --> 00:32:34,372
- Does that mean we're still stuck here?
- That's what it looks like it.

571
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,625
How much time is left
on the self-destruct?

572
00:32:37,785 --> 00:32:40,503
- Computers shut down before we see.
- So it could happen any time.

573
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:45,720
Great.

574
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:52,898
You were gonna propose to me?

575
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,501
Today?

576
00:32:57,611 --> 00:32:58,405
Well...

577
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:00,361
I mean, before the...

578
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:01,816
the lockdown.

579
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:07,104
So?

580
00:33:10,377 --> 00:33:11,665
Why don't you?

581
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:15,063
Now?

582
00:33:16,592 --> 00:33:17,874
You want me to propose now?

583
00:33:18,948 --> 00:33:20,877
Don't you want to hear my answer?

584
00:33:21,037 --> 00:33:23,545
Well, it doesn't really matter
anymore, does it?

585
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:25,715
How can you say that?

586
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:27,467
We're moments away from our deaths.

587
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:29,463
Don't talk like that!

588
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:32,048
There's still a chance someone
could come through this door...

589
00:33:32,168 --> 00:33:34,195
<i>Katie, please, enough already.</i>

590
00:33:34,315 --> 00:33:36,933
As much as I'd love to believe someone's
gonna swoop in and save the day,

591
00:33:37,053 --> 00:33:38,248
the fact that no one has

592
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:40,629
tells me it's probably not gonna happen.
I'm sorry if that's

593
00:33:40,749 --> 00:33:43,729
bleak and horrible and fatalistic,
but there it is.

594
00:33:55,484 --> 00:33:58,110
- What are we going to do now?
- Well, what can we do?

595
00:33:58,478 --> 00:34:00,540
<i>Does this vent go to the power room?</i>

596
00:34:01,699 --> 00:34:04,814
Yes! Yes, I believe it leads
to the tower's main ventilation flue.

597
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:07,196
But that system's shut down.
Those vents will be closed off.

598
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:09,309
Not anymore.
We were able to get it back online

599
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:12,137
in most of the tower just before
the computers went down.

600
00:34:25,425 --> 00:34:27,031
All right, looks clear...

601
00:34:27,957 --> 00:34:30,577
It's gonna be a tight squeeze, though.
There's no way I can move in here.

602
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:32,683
- I'll do it.
- No. I'll do it.

603
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,952
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm small enough.

604
00:34:36,112 --> 00:34:39,191
I can crawl through there.
I'll have the power off in no time.

605
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:41,698
Attaboy.

606
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,310
Ready?

607
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,474
Yeah.

608
00:35:02,752 --> 00:35:04,108
I had you wrong.

609
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:09,683
When you first came here,

610
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,067
I thought you were weak.

611
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:15,999
That you didn't belong.

612
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:22,669
It's the story of my life.

613
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:29,248
Growing up, I

614
00:35:29,368 --> 00:35:30,715
skipped three grades.

615
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:33,094
I graduated at 15.

616
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:38,556
Got my bachelor's degree before
I was even old enough to vote.

617
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:41,341
I missed out on a lot of things.

618
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,956
Any kind of

619
00:35:46,422 --> 00:35:48,121
social event...

620
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:51,532
any parties...

621
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,079
and dances...

622
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:00,616
I don't ever remember a time in my life

623
00:36:00,736 --> 00:36:02,106
where I belonged.

624
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:08,630
Yeah, well...

625
00:36:09,054 --> 00:36:10,763
blowing up that tank...

626
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:13,966
you really showed yourself.

627
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,945
But it didn't work.

628
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:23,726
That's not the point.

629
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,714
<i>"I'll have the power off in no time."</i>

630
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:36,013
<i>Idiot!</i>

631
00:37:40,947 --> 00:37:42,416
Come on, Radek.

632
00:37:42,536 --> 00:37:43,742
He'll make it.

633
00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:31,256
He did it.

634
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,316
Oh, my God!

635
00:38:52,673 --> 00:38:55,090
They found a cure or figured out
how to override the program.

636
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,969
I don't believe it!
We're going to make it!

637
00:38:57,089 --> 00:38:58,569
We're not going to die!

638
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:09,141
<i>You crawled the entire way there,</i>

639
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:11,552
- in those tiny vents?
- I'm surprised he even fit in there.

640
00:39:11,672 --> 00:39:13,834
- Oh, he fit. There's plenty of room.
- Well, not plenty.

641
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:16,709
He looked like one of those
little hamsters in one of those...

642
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:20,560
Yes, yes, listen, the important thing is
I was able to shut the power in time.

643
00:39:20,966 --> 00:39:22,989
Did you hear?
McKay thought it was a real outbreak.

644
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:24,677
He even started getting sick,

645
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:26,043
thought he was...

646
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:29,149
Hi.

647
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,539
- You mind if I join you?
- Sure. Go ahead.

648
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:40,840
What?

649
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:42,673
Nothing.

650
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,674
Well, it's been several hours now,
and there is no indication

651
00:39:48,794 --> 00:39:51,129
that anyone out there
has picked up our alert beacon.

652
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:54,088
- I think we're in the clear.
- Should keep an eye out, just in case.

653
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:55,467
Great work, Radek.

654
00:39:55,587 --> 00:39:57,982
Everyone on this base
owes you a debt of gratitude.

655
00:39:58,283 --> 00:39:59,577
Well, thank you.

656
00:40:01,147 --> 00:40:02,778
McKay would love this.

657
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:08,550
Katie?

658
00:40:10,988 --> 00:40:12,692
Hello, Rodney.

659
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:16,244
I see you're feeling better.

660
00:40:16,364 --> 00:40:17,460
Uh. Yes, I...

661
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:21,230
well, I mean, it was probably
just, you know, an allergic thing.

662
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,271
I'm fine.

663
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:23,799
And the...

664
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:26,351
quarantine?
Is it true, there was no outbreak?

665
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:29,305
No. It was a malfunction.
A planetary anomaly.

666
00:40:29,465 --> 00:40:31,909
Ionospheric disturbance. I've actually

667
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,806
recalibrated the system so
it'll take into effect future activity,

668
00:40:34,926 --> 00:40:36,158
so we should be fine.

669
00:40:36,278 --> 00:40:39,323
Someone said it was Dr. Zelenka that
finally turned off the self-destruct?

670
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:41,723
Technically, yes, but it was
actually more of a group effort.

671
00:40:41,843 --> 00:40:44,361
But that's not why I came here. I...

672
00:40:45,334 --> 00:40:46,334
Here's the thing.

673
00:40:47,506 --> 00:40:49,520
Over the last year and a half,

674
00:40:50,205 --> 00:40:52,562
I have become aware
that I have certain...

675
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:55,534
I don't want to use the word "flaws..."

676
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:57,726
shortcomings, perhaps?

677
00:40:58,466 --> 00:40:59,655
For example...

678
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:03,047
on occasion, I can be negative...

679
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:06,589
and... and demanding
and a tad arrogant... but...

680
00:41:07,356 --> 00:41:09,002
I'm also finding that

681
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:11,477
just being aware of your...

682
00:41:12,163 --> 00:41:13,467
shortcomings

683
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:15,313
is just the first,

684
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:18,145
minute step on the road to betterment,

685
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:20,528
and the real trick seems to be to

686
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:22,262
actually do something about it.

687
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:24,276
I know. It's difficult.

688
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:26,022
The point is,

689
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,115
I came here earlier today
to propose marriage to you,

690
00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:31,904
but after what happened,

691
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:35,621
I realize that I may
have been rushing things.

692
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:40,543
I just don't think I'm ready for this.

693
00:41:42,874 --> 00:41:43,836
I know.

694
00:41:44,987 --> 00:41:45,756
You do?

695
00:41:47,521 --> 00:41:49,655
I don't think I'm ready, either.

696
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,330
Okay. Good.

697
00:41:56,234 --> 00:41:57,425
That's good.

698
00:41:58,525 --> 00:42:00,736
It's not that my feelings
have changed or diminished...

699
00:42:00,856 --> 00:42:02,857
- No, of course not.
- Just... I mean,

700
00:42:04,252 --> 00:42:07,726
if we got married now,
I would make your life miserable, and...

701
00:42:07,846 --> 00:42:09,864
you are far too good a person for that.

702
00:42:10,773 --> 00:42:12,408
Don't be so hard on yourself.

703
00:42:13,649 --> 00:42:15,608
Easier said than done, right?

704
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:25,296
Okay. So, raincheck on lunch?

705
00:42:25,785 --> 00:42:27,087
Absolutely.

706
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,785
Rodney?

707
00:42:35,758 --> 00:42:37,763
- Bye.
- Right. Bye.
