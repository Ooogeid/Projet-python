1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,778
You sure you don't want going back
to Earth like McKay and the others?

2
00:00:05,903 --> 00:00:08,011
SGC doesn't have a ZPM,
so two weeks on Earth

3
00:00:08,136 --> 00:00:11,862
means three weeks in the Daedalus.
That's five weeks of missing work.

4
00:00:11,987 --> 00:00:15,509
This happen only year-and-a-half,
so I save mine for something special.

5
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:17,556
So we're going camping instead?

6
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:19,831
On a beach
that's never been surfed or touched.

7
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:22,313
You gotta get more excited
about this.

8
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:24,440
Check that out.

9
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:27,276
- What?
- Think he's ever gonna make a move?

10
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:30,994
Who cares?

11
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:35,834
Say...

12
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:38,499
I know we only get 14 days
on Earth a year,

13
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:40,289
and you miss your dad and all...

14
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:42,219
But...

15
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:44,332
See, one of my old...

16
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:46,929
A guy who was doing his doctorate
at the same time as me,

17
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:50,338
he's giving a big secret presentation
about some new thing he's working on,

18
00:00:50,463 --> 00:00:53,219
and everyone in the physics community
is going to be there.

19
00:00:53,524 --> 00:00:54,963
And... Well...

20
00:00:55,894 --> 00:00:59,517
See, the thing is there's
this perception out there that I'm...

21
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,895
Like, a washout, recluse...

22
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,022
- Why?
- 'Cause I do this for a living.

23
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,960
I mean, tip-top secret stuff.

24
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:09,466
I mean, I haven't published a paper
in nearly a decade...

25
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:12,203
Not one for the general public...
And I'm hard to get ahold of,

26
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:13,989
what with living in another galaxy.

27
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:17,031
- I know what that's like.
- Exactly. They think I'm a shut-in.

28
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:18,156
So...

29
00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:21,059
I was thinking...
That if I was to, say,

30
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:23,332
show up... with a woman...

31
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,545
A beautiful woman...

32
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:31,414
That they wouldn't maybe...
not think that I was...

33
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:34,510
like, a complete loser.

34
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:36,887
It would be one day,
the first night,

35
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,060
and then you could be off
to Chippewa Falls.

36
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:40,599
I mean, it could be fun.

37
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,517
Well, let's see...
A room full of physicists,

38
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,982
a long-winded presentation
I probably won't understand...

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,485
Yeah, doesn't really sound like fun.

40
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,117
There'll be drinks, probably,
and maybe sandwiches...

41
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:55,737
And... me.

42
00:01:56,832 --> 00:01:58,209
I'll be there.

43
00:01:58,428 --> 00:02:01,874
You don't have to fabricate reasons
on why you need me to be with you.

44
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:04,915
You could just ask me out on a date.

45
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:07,668
I didn't want to...
I mean, I know you...

46
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,253
I'll probably say yes.

47
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:12,965
You... want to go with me?

48
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:14,926
Sure.

49
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:17,237
I'd love to.

50
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:20,514
Well, I'd love... I mean, that's...
Good. Great. That's...

51
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,766
It's a date.

52
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,089
It's a date.

53
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:24,763
So what's the presentation?

54
00:02:24,888 --> 00:02:26,152
I don't know.

55
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:28,614
He doesn't want to tell anyone
until we all get there,

56
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,421
but if I know this guy,
it'll be first-class presentation...

57
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:34,595
With, like, second-rate science.

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,569
Probably some minor adjustment
to someone else's work,

59
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:40,495
- but the food'll be good.
- And the company.

60
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:55,147
- Malcolm, have you read this?
- Yes.

61
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,096
Your staff thinks it's reckless
to turn this thing on tomorrow.

62
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,722
Some of my staff...

63
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:04,373
They're just getting cold feet,
that's all.

64
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:08,103
Do you remember all that stuff
before CERN turned on the LHC?

65
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,189
You know, miniature black holes,

66
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:12,691
exotic particles, strangelets,

67
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:14,972
the instantaneous destruction
of the planet?

68
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:17,722
All unfounded histrionics.

69
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:19,713
We are going to be just fine.

70
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:22,700
So you're saying none of these
potential catastrophes will happen?

71
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:26,431
Well, there is always
the slight possibility

72
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:28,582
that something might go wrong.

73
00:03:29,038 --> 00:03:31,543
- The cause has a lot riding on this.
- Don't worry about it.

74
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,465
Your precious "cause" will come out
of this squeaky clean tomorrow.

75
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,924
Some of these worst-case scenarios
are terrifying...

76
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,530
Of course they're terrifying...
They're worst-case scenarios!

77
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:44,347
They are the worst possible thing
that could ever happen, ever.

78
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:50,304
Tomorrow will come off without a hitch.
We've done hundreds of tests.

79
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,565
There is zero possibility
for failure.

80
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:56,180
Trust me.

81
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,866
Season 5 Episode 16
Brain Storm (v. 1.00)

82
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:05,883
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

83
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:08,581
www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

84
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,301
This is exciting.

85
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:22,803
- It's just a plane.
- But I've never

86
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,810
even flown first class.
This is amazing.

87
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:27,432
Have you tried these strawberries?

88
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,060
When I was 10, I ate a bowl full
of strawberries and threw up.

89
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:32,252
I haven't been able
to stomach them since.

90
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:35,634
How does this guy afford all this?
I thought he was just a physicist.

91
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,433
Well, he was always able
to dupe guys with deep pockets in

92
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:40,217
to backing his research.

93
00:04:40,342 --> 00:04:43,282
It's amazing what a nice smile
and a power point will get you.

94
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:46,201
- Well, I am impressed.
- Yes,

95
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,494
I can see that.

96
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,040
Come on. You should be happy
for your friend's success.

97
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,299
It's more of an acquaintance
than a friend.

98
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:56,002
Acquaintances don't pick you up
in private planes.

99
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:59,590
He didn't send the jet to be nice.
He sent the jet to rub it in my face.

100
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:03,927
I was always one step ahead at school,
and now that we're in the "real world,"

101
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,749
he wants to show me that,
as far as the planet is concerned,

102
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,973
he's a lot more successful
than I am.

103
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:10,768
And what is with the evening attire?

104
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:14,020
We're going to a science talk.
Who the hell does he think he is?

105
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,066
Is this what the whole day will be like?
In a bad mood?

106
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,500
'Cause we're back on Earth
on a private jet,

107
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,155
drinking expensive champagne,

108
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,741
and your date's wearing
a fancy dress.

109
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,744
Most people would be having
a good time, Rodney.

110
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,829
You're right...

111
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:59,274
Yes. Welcome.
I'll just need you both

112
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,403
to sign this non-disclosure
and confidentiality agreement.

113
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,156
- You're not serious.
- Is there a problem, Sir?

114
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:08,659
This whole thing
is a confidentiality agreement?

115
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:09,955
Yes, sir.

116
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,705
What could they be doing
to be kept 200 pages secret?

117
00:06:12,977 --> 00:06:16,417
If you want to go inside, sir,
you need to sign the agreement.

118
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:19,317
Dinosaurs?

119
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,199
- Excuse me?
- Do they have living dinosaurs?

120
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:25,705
Because I'll sign this
if he's brought dinosaurs back to life.

121
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,554
But short of that, he is out of his mind
if he thinks that his discovery

122
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,180
is so important and so secret

123
00:06:31,513 --> 00:06:34,454
that I have to sign the unabridged works
of William Shakespeare here.

124
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:35,787
Just sign it.

125
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:38,493
Here you go.

126
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:43,502
You're just lucky the lady's here,
aren't you?

127
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:03,757
- Where do you think we are?
- I don't know. Arizona? Nevada?

128
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,876
I didn't think people even built secret
facilities anymore. It seems so 1950s.

129
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,280
I had it on good authority
that you were dead.

130
00:07:15,472 --> 00:07:17,203
And this would be your... sister?

131
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,551
No, no, Neil.
You know, she's not my sister.

132
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:21,378
This is Jennifer Keller.

133
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:24,026
That's Bill Nye
and Neil Degrasse Tyson.

134
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,695
You know, from television.

135
00:07:27,722 --> 00:07:29,402
Yeah, of course.

136
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:32,009
- Very nice to meet you.
- No, the pleasure's mine.

137
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:34,912
- And she's taken, Neil.
- No, I didn't mean it that way...

138
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,248
Neil likes to steal things from me,
things like women and physics ideas.

139
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,215
Yeah, but who hasn't stolen an idea
from the great Rodney McKay?

140
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,421
- So we admit it now.
- Back in the day,

141
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,235
whenever any one of these people
came up with a new idea

142
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,951
or published a new paper,

143
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:52,513
Dr. McKay here would swear
that he was already working on it,

144
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,598
just hadn't gotten around
to publishing it yet.

145
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:57,625
He'd say things like,
"I was about to say the same thing,"

146
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,949
or, "I was just about
to have that same idea."

147
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,515
At least I didn't declassify
Pluto from planet status.

148
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,585
Way to make all the little kids cry.
That make you feel like a big man?

149
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,236
See, thanks to Dr. Tyson,

150
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,774
Pluto is now the first
of the Plutoids,

151
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:13,117
a new class of celestial object.
It's cool. Come on, Rodney.

152
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:16,035
- It's the 21st century.
- Actually, come to think of it,

153
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,789
when was the last time
you even published a paper? The '80s?

154
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,165
- It hasn't been that long.
- I think I was listening

155
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,919
to that band A Flock Of Seagulls
while I was reading it.

156
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:27,820
- It might have been pre-Reagan.
- It has been great running into you.

157
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:29,947
We should maybe get our seats.

158
00:08:30,398 --> 00:08:31,399
Bye.

159
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,200
They can't possibly be dating.

160
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:39,173
I know.
Well, you're married, so...

161
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:40,596
Dibs.

162
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:42,223
She's all yours.

163
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,708
- I think maybe this was a bad idea.
- Why?

164
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:53,236
Well, I just remembered
I don't really like these people.

165
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:57,690
Is it that you don't like them,
or maybe they don't like you?

166
00:08:58,241 --> 00:09:00,942
Possibly.
I mean, I used to be a little...

167
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:04,317
- abrasive?
- Used to be. Yeah.

168
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:07,440
It's hard to explain.
My field is very competitive.

169
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,819
Yeah, I went to med school
for six years.

170
00:09:10,944 --> 00:09:12,968
I wouldn't know anything about that.

171
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:14,390
Right.

172
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:16,559
Not everything
has to be a competition, Rodney.

173
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:18,630
- They know how smart you are.
- I'm not sure.

174
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:21,886
Of course they do.
You don't have to keep reminding them.

175
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:23,813
It's called being humble.

176
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,788
Have you heard that word before?

177
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:31,014
Look, we're on our first date
and I've come to a physics talk, okay?

178
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,341
You have to bend a little bit too.

179
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,102
Humble?

180
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:37,659
I'll guess I can try anything once.

181
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:47,480
Earth...

182
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,492
Our home, our planet,

183
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,507
the very vessel of life.

184
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:56,483
Our world... Unique, irreplaceable.

185
00:09:57,637 --> 00:09:59,590
And yet, at times,

186
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:02,545
it seems like we are unrelenting
in our quest

187
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,146
to drive our ecosystem
into catastrophic failure.

188
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:08,272
Gone unchecked,

189
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,440
global warming will transform
this lush world we know today

190
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:15,478
into a lifeless and arid rock.

191
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:18,640
Friends,
the stakes couldn't be higher,

192
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,512
the situation no more dire.

193
00:10:22,016 --> 00:10:23,220
It's time...

194
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:24,778
to act.

195
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:29,695
Hello. I'm Malcolm Tunney.

196
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:34,791
If he's so worried about global warming,
why did he fly us here on a private jet

197
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,305
that spews out more CO2 than Sweden.

198
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,429
Thank you very much.

199
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,637
Very kind.

200
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:44,890
As many of you know,
I am not an environmental scientist,

201
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:46,918
nor do I pretend to be one.

202
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:49,815
For instance, I shower regularly.

203
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:53,859
No offense, Larry.

204
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:57,327
I'm just a concerned citizen,

205
00:10:57,452 --> 00:11:00,640
one who realizes that the Earth
has carried us for so long,

206
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:03,063
maybe it's time that we carried her.

207
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:06,532
That ratio would be accurate
if his body was the size of his ego.

208
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:08,458
Yeah, it's a little much.

209
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:13,143
Solving a problem like global warming
may seem impossibly complex.

210
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,217
So many nations, so many corporations,
and John Q. Public

211
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,490
will have to agree
on a dizzying number of issues.

212
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:21,999
So, then,

213
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:24,308
what can one person really do
to make a difference?

214
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,671
What can I,

215
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:28,605
with my particular
and unique skill set,

216
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,556
do to help?

217
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:32,983
They think you're the arrogant one?

218
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:36,152
I've been working on a number
of projects over the last decade,

219
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:39,359
and I realized that,
if I were to combine them,

220
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,743
I just may be able to achieve
something unexpected...

221
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:44,853
So, ladies and gentlemen,

222
00:11:44,978 --> 00:11:48,380
with major funding from my friends
at Kramer Innovations,

223
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:50,792
I have been able to devise a means

224
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:52,828
to cool our planet

225
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:55,756
in a safe and controlled way.

226
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:58,847
This guy wouldn't know cool...

227
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:03,180
Now, the science behind this
is immensely complex,

228
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:06,238
but there will be detailed briefs
as you leave the lecture hall,

229
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:09,061
but for right now,
let me just give you the cliffs notes.

230
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:12,646
It begins with a massive heat-sink,
one of my own design,

231
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,484
which steadily draws heat
from the surrounding environment.

232
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:18,737
- But where does the heat go?
- Where does that heat go, you may ask.

233
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:20,590
Well, my friends,

234
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:22,848
that is the hard part.

235
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:27,619
I give you
the Tunney Space-Time Matter Bridge.

236
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:30,853
Wait. What?

237
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,981
Now, this isn't just some
theoretical math proof.

238
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:35,846
This is a functioning

239
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:37,923
piece of technology,

240
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:41,239
one that literally moves heat
from our space time

241
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:44,068
and vents it out
into another space time.

242
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,677
That's my bridge...
My sister and I came up with that.

243
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,231
- Sorry.
- And it works.

244
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,065
We've been testing the system,

245
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,440
and it has proved to be
remarkably stable.

246
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:57,050
That's my idea!

247
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,943
Rodney, now is not the time.

248
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:01,029
For the purposes
of the demonstration today,

249
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,243
I've surrounded this facility
with an electrified plasma grid

250
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,575
that will contain
the reach of the heat-sink.

251
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,287
It will draw heat
only from this facility.

252
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,165
He's going to turn it on with us here.
That's... this is a bad idea.

253
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,669
- Rodney, please.
- And to prove the effectiveness,

254
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:20,090
I will lower the temperature
within this facility by 10 degrees.

255
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,342
I've turned off
the air conditioning,

256
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,261
so there'll be no cheating,
I promise.

257
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,972
I'm sorry, I can't let him do this...
Excuse me!

258
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:32,044
Thank you for coming.

259
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:33,310
This is a bad idea.

260
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:36,931
Well, we're not quite ready
for the Q&A session yet,

261
00:13:37,056 --> 00:13:39,411
- so if you could just wait till then...
- Let's just

262
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:43,100
take a look at the data you've come up
with and talk about this, because

263
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:46,116
turning the device on with all these
people here could be very dangerous.

264
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:48,165
Respectfully, I disagree.

265
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:51,756
You can't do something like this
without our consent.

266
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:52,801
Sit down!

267
00:13:52,926 --> 00:13:55,708
You did sign the document
when you entered, didn't you?

268
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:58,962
- I thought that was just...
- Then I have your consent.

269
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:03,663
Look, I've been doing work
that is very, very similar to this...

270
00:14:03,788 --> 00:14:06,932
Really?
I don't think that's possible.

271
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:09,708
Look, these bridges
to other space times

272
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:11,285
can be very unpredictable.

273
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,292
Do you have any research
to put forward?

274
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,941
A paper, perhaps?
Anything to back up your claim?

275
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,573
Rodney, please.
Tell me this isn't just petty jealously.

276
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,784
- Okay.
- Well, no, no, I... I just...

277
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,478
No, I didn't think so.

278
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,272
Don't worry, everyone.
This is completely safe.

279
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,397
And...

280
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,345
We're up and running.

281
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:47,723
I'll be happy to answer your questions
once you've read the brief,

282
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:50,375
but for now, why don't we all go
back out to the lobby

283
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,353
where hot cocoa is waiting,

284
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,064
'cause it's about to get
very cold in here.

285
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,689
Thank you.

286
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,527
- I...
- Come on.

287
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:01,013
Let's go get
some hot chocolate, okay?

288
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:10,138
This is...

289
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:12,308
How did he even get a hold
of my work?

290
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:14,288
- You're sure this is your work?
- Absolutely.

291
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,377
- Look, you believe me, don't you?
- Of course I do.

292
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:19,522
There is no way
he came up with this on his own.

293
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:21,512
We've got to... We've got to...

294
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:23,258
Come on.

295
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:38,580
- We shouldn't be in here.
- Okay, just stand guard there.

296
00:15:38,998 --> 00:15:41,270
It'll take me a couple of seconds
to hack into his computer.

297
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:42,695
What are you doing?!

298
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:53,332
Thank you.
Thank you.

299
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:57,301
Thank you, but I don't think
an achievement of this magnitude

300
00:15:57,426 --> 00:15:59,456
can truly be credited to one man.

301
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:02,066
- Dr. Tunney, sir.
- Oh, excuse me.

302
00:16:02,736 --> 00:16:03,948
Yes? What is it?

303
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:06,916
Well, you told us to shut
the device down once we reached 64.

304
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,804
Yes, that's right.
We can shut it down now.

305
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:10,708
Well, that's the problem, sir.
We've tried.

306
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,726
We've tried everything, in fact.
The device won't shut off.

307
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:25,738
I'm sorry, could you just give me
a moment here? Let me in here.

308
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:29,158
All right, now, who's been in here?

309
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:30,500
Just us, sir.

310
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,877
- What is it?
- Well, the bridge won't deactivate.

311
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:34,684
I don't understand why it shouldn't.

312
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:38,167
- Shut down the power to the facility.
- That won't do anything.

313
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:41,004
The system self-generates
its own power once it's up and running.

314
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:44,393
Then shut down the containment field.
We need to get these guests out of here.

315
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:45,999
That won't work either.

316
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:47,336
- Why not?
- Why not?

317
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:48,976
Well, it's impossibly complicated,

318
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:52,348
but the containment field is tied
into the basic operations of the device.

319
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,643
It literally can't shut down
until we collapse the matter bridge.

320
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:59,874
It's a safety protocol I can't reprogram
until we power down the device.

321
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:02,353
So we're trapped in here
until you can get this thing fixed?

322
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:03,315
Yes.

323
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,004
What happens until then?

324
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:08,254
The bridge will continue
to draw heat from the heat-sink.

325
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,398
We just dropped 10 degrees
in 10 minutes.

326
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,578
In an hour, we'll be below zero.
We're gonna freeze to death.

327
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:17,790
I've activated the heating system.
That should buy us a little bit of time.

328
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:20,446
You said "without a hitch,"
you'd run hundreds of tests.

329
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,251
Someone has messed with the system.

330
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,347
- That was out of line, man.
- He stole the work.

331
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,813
Hey, come on. It was in the middle
of his presentation.

332
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:34,382
He was about to start the thing up!
It couldn't wait.

333
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:36,247
He brought you here
as an olive branch.

334
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:38,924
- He wanted to bury the hatchet.
- Yeah, in my back.

335
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,440
Dr. McKay? Dr. Keller?

336
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:42,565
Yes?

337
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:44,692
Mr. Tunney would like a word.

338
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:49,971
Well, I'm guessing
that that word is "I apologize."

339
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:53,351
That's two words, genius.

340
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,499
That's one odd duck, that guy.

341
00:18:06,303 --> 00:18:09,441
Well, it takes a big man
to admit that he's wrong,

342
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,625
and much as I appreciate it,
I really would prefer

343
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,251
that this whole apology thing
took place a little more publicly.

344
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:15,631
Are you kidding?

345
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:18,100
You are the one
who should be apologizing to me.

346
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:22,440
- What the hell for?
- I invited you here as a courtesy.

347
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:23,981
Out of kindness.

348
00:18:24,654 --> 00:18:28,564
Most people think you've lost your mind,
that you've gone... Howard Hughes.

349
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,626
Because I don't call anymore doesn't
mean I'm keeping my urine in jars.

350
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:33,574
- I don't need you to...
- Shut up.

351
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:35,629
What have you two done?

352
00:18:35,754 --> 00:18:37,077
What have we done?

353
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:39,586
We can't shut the device down.

354
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,507
I told you not to turn it on.
I practically begged you.

355
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:44,341
But would you listen? No!

356
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:46,119
Tell us what you did
and how to undo it

357
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:48,189
and I'll consider
not pressing charges.

358
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:50,175
We didn't do anything.

359
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:53,064
Oh, really?
Explain this, then.

360
00:19:01,136 --> 00:19:03,439
<i>- We shouldn't be in here.
- Stand guard there.</i>

361
00:19:03,564 --> 00:19:06,192
<i>It'll take me a couple seconds
to hack into his computer.</i>

362
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:07,439
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

363
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:11,361
<i>If he thinks he can humiliate me and get
away with it, another thing's coming.</i>

364
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:14,317
<i>- I will destroy him.
- Now is not the time, Rodney.</i>

365
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:17,159
Got to be something in here I can
use to discredit the pretentious tool.

366
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:21,408
<i>Hurry up, hurry up, somebody's coming.
Come on, come on, come on.</i>

367
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,814
Now, look, I can see how,
out of context,

368
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:28,376
that could seem incriminating...

369
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,215
- Out of context?
- What were you doing in there?

370
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:36,566
I was looking for a paper I published
a little over two years ago,

371
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:38,691
one that dealt with a matter bridge.

372
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:43,142
You have not published a paper
in a very long time.

373
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:46,897
- You didn't even know it was my work.
- You publish under a <i>nom de plume</i> now?

374
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:50,016
Okay, here's how I think
it went down...

375
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:52,090
You were working with the government.

376
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:55,498
Someone trusted you and let you see
something you weren't supposed to see.

377
00:19:55,623 --> 00:19:58,364
Or maybe you were sent something
by accident, who knows.

378
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:02,578
You saw a paper about a matter bridge,
a project that was shut down

379
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:05,553
due to the adverse effects
of exotic particles.

380
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:08,425
You read it,
you realized that if the bridge was used

381
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,130
merely as a transfer of energy,
say heat,

382
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:14,628
there would be no exotic particle
creation and thus no adverse effects.

383
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:17,135
So... You co-opted
the science as your own,

384
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:19,414
made a few changes
to make yourself feel better,

385
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:22,574
and got to work, dismissing
the original authors' warnings

386
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:25,853
about the inherent instability
of time-space bridges.

387
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:28,021
- How am I doing?
- That's preposterous.

388
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,315
Dr. Tunney's
been working on this for years.

389
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:33,016
That was my work, Malcolm.

390
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:35,195
I wrote that paper.

391
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:43,014
Terrence,
these people may be able to help us.

392
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:49,690
This is bad.

393
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,585
- The sabotage?
- Sabotage. Please.

394
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,632
- But you said there was...
- I may have rushed to judgment.

395
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:57,749
- Can you shut it down?
- These bridges

396
00:20:57,874 --> 00:21:00,385
are the very definition
of unpredictable.

397
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,681
You know, I think I remember
you saying something about that before.

398
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:06,175
- Yes or no, Doctor?
- I don't know yet.

399
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:08,251
- Have you turned up the heat?
- Yes.

400
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:10,316
- Have you noticed this?
- Yes.

401
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,602
What is it?

402
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:16,206
The bridge isn't drawing a consistent
load from the heat-sink, it's wavering.

403
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,928
- Why is that bad?
- I wouldn't necessarily call it bad.

404
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:22,816
It's definitely not good,
but I don't know that I'd call it bad.

405
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:24,670
- You're kidding me?
- A regular bridge

406
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:27,383
should draw the same amount of energy
from the heat sink at all times.

407
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:29,401
This one is fluctuating greatly.

408
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:31,729
Maybe we can use that...

409
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:34,087
Wait for it to peak,
then overload it and crash.

410
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:36,011
Good idea.

411
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:39,003
Yeah, I thought you'd like it...
What with it being my idea and all.

412
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,177
- It's freezing in here.
- We get it. It works.

413
00:21:46,302 --> 00:21:49,394
Shut it down.
I'm starting to freeze to my chair.

414
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,402
What the hell was that?

415
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:05,118
A sudden and dramatic cooling beam.

416
00:22:05,486 --> 00:22:08,812
- The irregular pull from the bridge...
- So when the bridge makes a demand...

417
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:12,459
The heat-sink reacts and draws power
from a localized place inside the field.

418
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,776
And that beam would freeze
anything in its path.

419
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:16,376
Oh, did not see this coming.

420
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,277
- It's freeze lightning.
- Freeze lightning... I like that.

421
00:22:19,402 --> 00:22:21,426
You can't have it.
It's mine. It's copywritten.

422
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,878
How's he doing?

423
00:22:25,003 --> 00:22:26,515
He's in very bad shape.

424
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:30,000
It's like his whole left side
has been flash-frozen.

425
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,314
I have never seen
anything like this before.

426
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:33,980
Oh, man.

427
00:22:35,256 --> 00:22:36,984
Look, this isn't entirely
your fault.

428
00:22:37,293 --> 00:22:39,735
I... I really hope
he signed his waiver.

429
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:46,054
Do you think this is the first time
this has happened?

430
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:48,314
or maybe just the first time
anyone's noticed it.

431
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:50,690
So this thing could be wreaking
havoc all over the facility.

432
00:22:50,815 --> 00:22:52,626
So this is gonna keep happening?

433
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:54,564
Yes, and probably
with greater frequency.

434
00:22:54,744 --> 00:22:57,204
Okay, this little side effect
is going to really hamper

435
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:58,899
our attempts to shut this thing down.

436
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:01,631
And by "hamper",
you mean "get us all killed."

437
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,440
Yeah, something like that.

438
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,028
- We need to call in the military.
- I'd prefer not to do that just yet.

439
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:14,404
You're lucky that guy
out there isn't dead.

440
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:17,607
I'm sure these two can get the device
back into its proper operating mode.

441
00:23:17,843 --> 00:23:19,560
It's a little late for that.

442
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:22,028
Things have gotten out of hand.
We need to make that call.

443
00:23:22,153 --> 00:23:24,071
We make that call,
the government shuts us down.

444
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:26,098
- Yeah, that's the idea.
- I don't understand.

445
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,840
When the device started to malfunction,
the first thing you wanted to do

446
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:30,619
was get everyone out of here safely.

447
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,332
To avoid the project being branded
as too dangerous to move forward.

448
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,543
Well, the cat's out of the bag now.

449
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:38,986
You worried about the money
you sunk? 'Cause that's gone.

450
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:40,566
I'm not worried about the money.

451
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:43,893
We're close to coming up
with a solution for global warming.

452
00:23:44,018 --> 00:23:45,552
We could save the planet.

453
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:48,722
It's bigger than me,
and it's bigger than you.

454
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:51,611
If we can get the device under
control without calling the military,

455
00:23:51,736 --> 00:23:53,559
they're gonna let us
continue our research.

456
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:56,000
I've got news for you.
You can't control it,

457
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,059
and you shouldn't continue
with your research.

458
00:23:58,184 --> 00:23:59,274
We'll figure it out.

459
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,361
I have the utmost faith
in both of you.

460
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,988
This is ridiculous.
Give me your cell.

461
00:24:05,113 --> 00:24:07,148
It won't work,
not with the containment field up.

462
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:10,911
- There's too much interference.
- You have a land line in your office.

463
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:17,131
- It's dead.
- Give me that.

464
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:19,528
It's dead.

465
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:23,719
- Kramer must have killed the phones.
- You have access to the communications?

466
00:24:23,844 --> 00:24:26,217
It's a Kramer facility.
I just work here.

467
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:28,524
- Great.
- Looks like it's up to you and me.

468
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:30,573
We'd better get back,
figure this out ourselves.

469
00:24:30,698 --> 00:24:31,848
Wait.
Wait, wait.

470
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,810
Isn't there, like,
a room full of geniuses out there?

471
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:36,685
That's debatable.

472
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,941
If that freeze lightning thing
happens again, people could die.

473
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:42,609
They'll slow me down.

474
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:45,403
What happened to that "humble" thing
we were gonna try today?

475
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,529
The result is what I am calling
"freeze lightning."

476
00:24:53,654 --> 00:24:54,529
Unbelievable.

477
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:57,654
It is the sudden and immediate
transfer of heat from a localized area,

478
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,841
and it is potentially very lethal.

479
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,462
We need to figure out
how to collapse the matter bridge,

480
00:25:02,857 --> 00:25:04,756
stop it from drawing energy
from the heat-sink,

481
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,236
otherwise it's going to get
"unlivably" cold in here.

482
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:11,304
Why don't we just turn this containment
field off and get out of here?

483
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:14,508
Well, for one thing, it's tied into
the basic function of the matter bridge,

484
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:15,907
so we can't shut it off.

485
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,101
Even if we could,
it houses so much cool air now

486
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:21,111
that it would create a sudden,
massive cold front as soon as it drops.

487
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:23,482
We're talking high-speed winds,
tornadoes...

488
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,443
An instant mega-storm.

489
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:30,905
Not to mention that the heat-sink'd draw
heat not just from this facility,

490
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,450
but from the entire planet.

491
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,154
We cannot allow that to happen.

492
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,455
Why don't we just destroy it,
just bash it apart?

493
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,000
Because that could create
a tear in our space time.

494
00:25:41,185 --> 00:25:42,384
Never mind, then.

495
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:43,848
Yeah.

496
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:48,165
Look, you guys
are the best of the best.

497
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,810
I'm sure if you work together,
you'll come up with something.

498
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,717
That will never work. Look.

499
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:01,621
Just give me two seconds...

500
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:05,038
You're going about this all wrong.

501
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,216
Watch who you're correcting,
"science guy."

502
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:10,826
- My PhD Is not honorary.
- Hey, look, I'm an engineer.

503
00:26:10,951 --> 00:26:13,158
I can do math!
Just listen to my idea...

504
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:16,578
I have been listening, and that is what
led me to believe that you are a moron!

505
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:19,530
If it's any consolation,
you're both wrong.

506
00:26:19,655 --> 00:26:22,023
- What, and you're right?
- We're supposed to listen to you?

507
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:23,908
You're the jerk
that got us into this mess.

508
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:26,350
- I have a workable theory.
- Yeah, a "theory".

509
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:28,530
Take into account
that I have experience with this,

510
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:30,417
I've been doing work
that is years ahead

511
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:33,530
of anything you guys have
even been dreaming about?

512
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:36,070
I think that's kind of
what I'm getting at!

513
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,062
This is embarrassing.

514
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:44,650
Look at you...

515
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:47,183
The greatest minds
this world has to offer,

516
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:49,011
and if I didn't know any better,

517
00:26:49,136 --> 00:26:51,613
I'd think there was a bunch
of sixth graders in here.

518
00:26:52,468 --> 00:26:55,114
You guys need to suck it up
and get along.

519
00:26:55,335 --> 00:26:58,579
It's like I've always said, people are
more alike than they are different...

520
00:26:58,704 --> 00:26:59,579
Not now, Nye.

521
00:27:00,348 --> 00:27:01,172
Okay.

522
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:04,010
Our lives are at stake here.

523
00:27:05,286 --> 00:27:07,937
We need a solution,
and we need this fast.

524
00:27:08,884 --> 00:27:09,873
Please...

525
00:27:10,594 --> 00:27:13,260
Come on, the rest of us
are counting on you.

526
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:17,763
Yes, Rodney.

527
00:27:18,592 --> 00:27:21,393
I think I'm onto something.
It just needs some ironing out.

528
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,971
Okay. Great.

529
00:27:23,678 --> 00:27:24,479
Guys...

530
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:27,616
Yeah, well,
let's have a look at it and just...

531
00:27:27,741 --> 00:27:28,759
Fresh eyes.

532
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:31,069
We'll start with Bill's theory...

533
00:27:39,441 --> 00:27:41,079
They'll figure something out.

534
00:27:41,846 --> 00:27:43,331
I'm sure they will.

535
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,800
Let's just hope
it's before someone dies.

536
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:51,796
You know,

537
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:54,154
my uncle George,

538
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,861
he always hated the phrase
"save the planet".

539
00:27:58,657 --> 00:27:59,361
What?

540
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:02,817
He just thought it was backwards
'cause the planet's gonna be here

541
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,431
no matter what happens.

542
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:07,184
It might be a giant unlivable rock,

543
00:28:08,368 --> 00:28:10,126
but it's gonna survive.

544
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:12,897
So you're turning this
into a discussion on semantics?

545
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:16,819
What I mean is, Mr. Kramer,
the work you're doing

546
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:21,407
isn't about saving the planet.
It's about saving lives.

547
00:28:22,093 --> 00:28:23,978
And that's a noble pursuit,

548
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,328
trying to save billions of people...

549
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:30,081
But it's no less noble
to save a hundred.

550
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:33,501
These guys,
no matter how smart they are,

551
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:36,376
they could use some help.

552
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:39,739
One phone call
could get that help here.

553
00:28:40,565 --> 00:28:41,718
Now, please...

554
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:46,390
Please let me make that call.

555
00:28:58,756 --> 00:29:00,226
Oh, don't tell me.

556
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:06,188
Oh, God.

557
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:10,787
Oh, I'm so sorry.

558
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:13,000
Can you fix this?

559
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:15,502
No. We're completely cut off.

560
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,409
That's terrible news.

561
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:25,412
- It's my fault. I should have...
- Yes.

562
00:29:25,537 --> 00:29:27,087
You need to see this.

563
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,895
The cold temperatures are affecting
the containment field emitters.

564
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,021
When they're weak,
they're on the verge of failing.

565
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:38,691
That's great.
We can get the people out of here, no?

566
00:29:38,816 --> 00:29:40,152
Make a call to the military?

567
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:44,411
We're surrounded by desert air.
The temperatures has gotten very cold.

568
00:29:44,536 --> 00:29:48,493
Introducing a sudden blast of icy air
will create one hell of a vortex storm.

569
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:52,372
A transmission couldn't make it through,
let alone get people out of here safely.

570
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:53,874
We can ride out the storm.

571
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:55,811
If we can't shut down the device,

572
00:29:55,936 --> 00:29:58,622
the heat-sink's gonna keep feeding
cold air into that weather system.

573
00:29:58,747 --> 00:30:00,631
- It'll never stop.
- That's not good.

574
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,310
No, I'd rather that didn't happen.

575
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:05,093
This might be a good thing.

576
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,094
What is it?

577
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,598
The containment field is dying
a slow but consistent death.

578
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,934
It might be weak enough
to punch a cell phone signal through.

579
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:14,769
Oh, you know, you might be right.

580
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,533
Okay, this is probably our best bet.
These two emitters are the weakest.

581
00:30:17,658 --> 00:30:19,842
It's a bit of a run from here,
so I'd better get going.

582
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:22,046
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

583
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,447
Give me your cell.

584
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,613
We need you here
to help dismantle the bridge.

585
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:26,998
I'll make the call.

586
00:30:28,131 --> 00:30:29,325
- Come on.
- All right.

587
00:30:29,572 --> 00:30:31,536
- Fine.
- Thanks.

588
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:36,415
I'm gonna radio once I get through.

589
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:37,784
Good luck.

590
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:39,408
You too.

591
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:45,971
She seems like a very capable woman.

592
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:47,973
- She sure is.
- She's your sister, right?

593
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,271
Is she single?

594
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,514
All right, where were we?

595
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,930
Your idea of overwhelming the bridge
to the point of collapse,

596
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,438
- it's a good one. It's right on track.
- But...

597
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,347
Everybody here thinks it means
we've got to dial up the heat-sink.

598
00:31:01,472 --> 00:31:02,815
It's gonna get even colder.

599
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,987
That could result
in an amount of freeze lightning...

600
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:07,738
- Which could kill us all.
- Right.

601
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:11,032
- The facility's furnace just went down.
- Well, how did that happen?

602
00:31:11,157 --> 00:31:13,525
We've been running at 120%
for the last hour

603
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,874
to compensate for falling temperatures.
We're in the middle of the desert.

604
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,224
The facility's not meant to be heated
like this.

605
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:21,907
We'll get below freezing
pretty darn quick now.

606
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:25,286
All right, well, we can't power it down
'cause it generates its own power.

607
00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:27,372
And we can't wait
for the field to collapse

608
00:31:27,497 --> 00:31:30,345
- because the storm will kill us.
- Guys, we don't have a choice, okay.

609
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,907
We've gotta wait for the bridge to peak,
dial up the heat-sink to overwhelm it.

610
00:31:34,032 --> 00:31:36,227
I know it's dangerous,
but that's all we've got.

611
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:41,085
Okay, look.

612
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,717
There's too many people in here.
I have important work to do.

613
00:31:43,842 --> 00:31:46,821
I do not need you in the way,
so, everybody, out!

614
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:56,288
Oh, come on.

615
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:05,991
Oh, thank God.

616
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:10,386
General Landry's office.

617
00:32:11,094 --> 00:32:13,906
Yes, this is Dr. Jennifer Keller.
I need to speak to the General.

618
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:15,057
It's an emergency.

619
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:18,143
Hello?

620
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:21,188
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello? This is Dr....

621
00:32:27,891 --> 00:32:28,904
Hello?

622
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,090
Son of a bitch!

623
00:32:33,715 --> 00:32:36,093
Should we warn everyone
we're about to do this?

624
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:37,705
No that would just cause a panic.

625
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,487
It's probably better
they don't know.

626
00:32:39,612 --> 00:32:40,966
We have no safe area,

627
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:43,627
plus we have no idea where the next
freeze lightning strike could hit.

628
00:32:45,415 --> 00:32:46,842
"Freeze lightning... "

629
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,464
you know, that's a bad name.

630
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:50,933
Don't look at me. It's his idea.

631
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,636
Here we go.

632
00:33:00,497 --> 00:33:04,022
- All right, shut it off.
- It hasn't collapsed the bridge yet.

633
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,233
I had a signal before.
Come on!

634
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,494
It's not working!

635
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,246
We just need a little more time,
a little more time.

636
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:24,123
The lightning are freezing off
whole sections of the facility.

637
00:33:24,248 --> 00:33:25,960
- Everyone is isolated.
- Doesn't matter.

638
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,464
They'll melt eventually
if we can shut this thing down.

639
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:32,333
- You are gonna kill us all!
- Look, I just need to keep doing...

640
00:33:36,552 --> 00:33:37,840
What did you do?

641
00:33:38,212 --> 00:33:40,400
- I turned it down.
- What? Why?

642
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,728
- It was too dangerous.
- We were almost there.

643
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,588
It was peaking out!
It was gonna work.

644
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:46,527
Yeah, and we'd all be dead.

645
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:47,899
We need something else.

646
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,778
Yeah, something fast! 'Cause
the containment field is about to fail.

647
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:55,713
Great.

648
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:01,801
Oh, not good.

649
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:08,029
Rodney, can you hear me?

650
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:11,412
Please tell me
you got through to the SGC?

651
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,651
<i>You've got to keep trying.</i>

652
00:34:13,776 --> 00:34:16,561
I'd love to, but my phone
got a little soaked.

653
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:18,388
It's not even... turning on.

654
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:21,016
- What?
- <i>My hallway got hit</i>

655
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,852
by that freeze lightning thing.

656
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,176
<i>Are you okay?</i>

657
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:26,188
I am now, but I won't be for long.

658
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,049
What happened?

659
00:34:28,473 --> 00:34:29,483
<i>I'm frozen in.</i>

660
00:34:29,963 --> 00:34:31,713
And the pipes busted open.

661
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:35,649
My body temperature is dropping
really fast.

662
00:34:37,023 --> 00:34:40,343
Okay, I'll radio security.
I'll get someone out to her right away.

663
00:34:40,468 --> 00:34:43,287
Look, security's on the way.
I need you just to sit tight

664
00:34:43,463 --> 00:34:44,961
<i>and try to stay warm, okay?</i>

665
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:50,212
- Sorry I didn't get the call through.
- You did your best.

666
00:34:51,303 --> 00:34:54,507
- Did you shut down that thing down?
- Not yet. We're working on it.

667
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:56,711
Hurry.

668
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,076
Okay, look, I've got to go.
Someone's on the way, all right.

669
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,083
- What is it?
- Containment field failure

670
00:35:07,246 --> 00:35:10,149
in 3... 2... 1...

671
00:35:21,296 --> 00:35:23,803
Winds aloft.
Reaching dangerous levels.

672
00:35:24,148 --> 00:35:26,582
If it continues like this,
we'll have a mess of tornadoes.

673
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,212
Great. Even less time before we die.

674
00:35:41,437 --> 00:35:43,807
Look, this device is capable
of generating its own power, right?

675
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,597
Yeah, a small percentage of the energy
is siphoned off to power the device.

676
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:49,313
So it's self-sustaining.

677
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:52,372
- Which is why we can't  pull the plug.
- Exactly.

678
00:35:52,497 --> 00:35:55,903
It's only capable to a certain extent?
It has a finite amount of power?

679
00:35:56,357 --> 00:35:57,404
Yes, of course.

680
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:59,448
Maybe we were wrong.

681
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:03,203
We've been trying to force so much power
through the bridge that it overloads it.

682
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,105
Maybe we should starve it...

683
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,921
Suck so much power from its generator
that it stalls it out.

684
00:36:08,046 --> 00:36:10,606
We could do that, but you'd have
to draw an insane amount of power.

685
00:36:10,731 --> 00:36:13,043
- The heat-sink could never do it.
- No...

686
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,630
But another bridge could.

687
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,890
You want to open another bridge?

688
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:19,802
It was rigged to power a single bridge.
We open another one...

689
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:22,679
And it overwhelms the system
and it fails.

690
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,972
It'll work.

691
00:36:24,668 --> 00:36:26,605
Yeah, but do you have any idea

692
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,794
how difficult it will be
to configure the system

693
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,792
to open two concurrent
space-time bridges?

694
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:33,139
- I never said it was gonna be easy.
- It'll be impossible.

695
00:36:33,264 --> 00:36:35,805
I'm Dr. Rodney McKay, all right?
"Difficult" takes a few seconds,

696
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,863
"impossible," a few minutes.

697
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:52,793
Rodney, can you hear me?

698
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,354
Have they got you out of there yet?

699
00:36:57,853 --> 00:37:00,096
Tunney, what's the deal?
I thought you sent security.

700
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:02,102
- They can't get to her.
- What? Why not?

701
00:37:03,403 --> 00:37:06,167
That last round of freeze lightning,
it sealed off a lot of the corridors.

702
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,884
See, they're making their way to her,
but it'll take some time.

703
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,262
It's getting harder...
harder to stay awake.

704
00:37:11,387 --> 00:37:13,521
I'm going into... hypothermic shock.

705
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:16,120
Jennifer, just hang in there,
all right?

706
00:37:16,245 --> 00:37:18,777
All right, we're here, right?
We can get to her. It's a straight shot.

707
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,555
- They should have come this way.
- They're cut off from us too.

708
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,614
- I've got to go get her.
- We're busy right now.

709
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,797
- She'll die.
- If the storm keeps up like this,

710
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:27,729
it'll rip the building apart,
we'll all die!

711
00:37:27,854 --> 00:37:30,705
Last I checked, you were a genius.
I already gave you the plan.

712
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,624
- A plan full of holes.
- So fill them!

713
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,043
- What if I run into a problem?
- Work around it!

714
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,504
You're smarter than me.

715
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:40,979
I know.

716
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:47,054
Oh, this is outrageous!

717
00:37:47,354 --> 00:37:50,598
When we need him the most,
he puts it on me, and I'm supposed to...

718
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:52,810
Man up.

719
00:38:19,726 --> 00:38:21,840
I think that's it.
Before I run it, just check my math.

720
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:24,551
I have been!
Why do you think I'm standing here?

721
00:38:38,946 --> 00:38:39,992
Do it!

722
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:48,992
You're not breathing.
Oh, my God, you're not breathing.

723
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:53,288
Please don't be dead.
Please don't be dead.

724
00:38:56,613 --> 00:38:58,376
Come back to me, please.

725
00:39:00,156 --> 00:39:01,841
Please come back to me.

726
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:07,100
It worked!

727
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,601
The second space-time bridge
blew the power supply.

728
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:11,376
Both bridges collapsed.

729
00:39:13,354 --> 00:39:14,412
I did it!

730
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:25,916
Please...

731
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:32,001
Oh, thank God.

732
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:34,002
You're okay. You're okay...

733
00:39:34,342 --> 00:39:35,372
I'm really cold.

734
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:37,101
Me too...

735
00:39:39,051 --> 00:39:40,084
You saved me.

736
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,670
I guess that makes us even.

737
00:39:44,288 --> 00:39:46,054
- I used an ax.
- A big ax.

738
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:49,865
I really wish you were conscious,
'cause I think it's the coolest thing...

739
00:39:55,081 --> 00:39:57,519
I don't know what I would have done
if I'd lost you...

740
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:00,413
I love you.

741
00:40:03,845 --> 00:40:05,664
I have for some time now.

742
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:08,946
I just wanted you to know.

743
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:29,925
At least your friends don't think
you're a washout anymore.

744
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,068
Stupid Bill Nye is telling everyone
that Tunney's turned the device off.

745
00:40:34,193 --> 00:40:36,099
Because he was the one
that shut off the device.

746
00:40:36,224 --> 00:40:38,160
With my coding.
It was my idea.

747
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:40,186
Rodney, does it really matter?

748
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:45,243
Yes, it does.

749
00:40:46,034 --> 00:40:48,269
I'm sorry, I'm supposed to be humble,
not supposed to care,

750
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:50,232
but I do, I really do.

751
00:40:50,612 --> 00:40:52,348
That's something
you should know about me.

752
00:40:52,473 --> 00:40:54,849
Well, quit, then.
Join the private sector.

753
00:40:54,974 --> 00:40:57,524
Start doing work
the whole world can see.

754
00:40:57,786 --> 00:40:59,979
- I've been thinking about it.
- What? No, you haven't.

755
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:01,708
My contract
with SGC is up this year.

756
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,066
Maybe it's time to move on,
time to do other things.

757
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:08,090
Please... I don't know anyone
who loves their job more than you.

758
00:41:10,658 --> 00:41:13,906
So you think the military
is gonna let them keep experimenting?

759
00:41:14,031 --> 00:41:15,430
I think it's highly unlikely.

760
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,159
Besides, geoengineering
is a dumb pursuit anyway.

761
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:20,053
No one person's gonna solve
global warming.

762
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,008
We all have to do our part.

763
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,105
Like not take private jets.

764
00:41:25,409 --> 00:41:27,191
Well, they were going our way
anyway.

765
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:33,625
You know, it's kind of nice,

766
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,408
just me and you back here.

767
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:37,118
Right.

768
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:41,913
Right!

769
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:45,953
You were legally dead
a few hours ago.

770
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:47,991
You were practically frozen.
You really wanna...

771
00:41:48,188 --> 00:41:52,185
It's either that or you keep telling me
how you, and only you, saved the day.

772
00:41:56,459 --> 00:41:59,038
I'm trying out this whole
"humble" thing out.

773
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:01,813
Seems to be quite a hit
with the ladies...
