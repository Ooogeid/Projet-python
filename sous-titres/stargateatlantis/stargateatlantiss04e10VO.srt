1
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:07,483
Initiating secondary diagnostics... now.

2
00:00:09,846 --> 00:00:11,899
- No variances.
- Are you sure?

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,287
- Yeah, positive.
- Well, check again.

4
00:00:14,947 --> 00:00:17,540
- Rodney, there's nothing here.
- Okay, just get over here, and...

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,175
monitor power readings.

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,532
No variances.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,829
You catching any discrepancies
on your end?

8
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:31,471
- Nothing.
<i>- You sure?</i>

9
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:34,466
- Rodney!
- Okay, just go back, go back...

10
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:37,565
All right, do we know
what the problem is?

11
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:40,571
- Yeah. The Gate's not working.
- I think we figured that much

12
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:43,092
- last week when you broke it?
- I did not break the Gate.

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,090
It just stopped working around the same
time you were screwing around with it.

14
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,550
I wasn't screwing around with it!
I was running a program

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,168
to boost its operating efficiency.

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,512
Yeah, well, good job.

17
00:00:51,632 --> 00:00:54,628
It had nothing to do with
why the Gate malfunctioned!

18
00:00:54,748 --> 00:00:58,127
We've been able to eliminate a number of
possible reasons, including my program,

19
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:00,040
I feel confident
we're making some progress,

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,157
and that things will be up
and running in... What was that?

21
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:05,183
An unidentified object
just struck the City.

22
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:08,780
- Why didn't the sensors pick it up?
- I don't know, it came in so fast.

23
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:11,090
We're getting
a low-level energy signature.

24
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,343
- What could it be?
- Let's find out.

25
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:32,317
- Any injuries?
- No, Sir.

26
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:36,522
Thank God it hit the reading library or
somebody really could have gotten hurt.

27
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:37,844
What is it?

28
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:41,259
It's obviously some kind
of mobile self-contained unit

29
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,274
a drone, possibly a probe.
It's definitely not wraith design.

30
00:01:44,528 --> 00:01:45,741
Perhaps it's Lantean,

31
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:49,126
you know? A de-orbited satellite
or a device on a recall directive.

32
00:01:49,258 --> 00:01:51,826
Maybe. It's still emanating
a trace energy field.

33
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:54,955
- Is it dangerous?
- No, it's just interesting.

34
00:01:58,544 --> 00:01:59,547
Check that out.

35
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,597
<i>It was damaged on re-entry. So what?</i>

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,750
Re-entry wouldn't have caused that.

37
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:06,545
Looks like weapons fire.
Maybe it took a hit before it came down.

38
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,473
And yet it came out in one piece.

39
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:12,202
Tough little bastard!

40
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,210
Colonel.
Do we know what it is yet?

41
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:16,968
Looks like a probe of some kind.

42
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:19,487
- Any idea who sent it?
- McKay and Zelenka'll figure it out.

43
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,443
In the meantime,
who's working on the Gate?

44
00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:23,379
The Gate can wait.
This is more important.

45
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:25,936
With all due respect, sir,
I think they're equally important.

46
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:29,026
Wouldn't it make more sense to keep
Zelenka working on this mystery object

47
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,234
and move McKay back
to his Gate diagnostics?

48
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:33,550
It's already been over a week now.

49
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:36,501
Not being able to use the Gate
is an inconvenience.

50
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:40,237
The possibility that someone may have
pinpointed our location is a threat.

51
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:42,391
The threat gets the priority.

52
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,862
Yes, Sir.

53
00:02:57,672 --> 00:02:59,198
<i>This is pointless.</i>

54
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:02,567
Even though the object survived re-entry
physically intact,

55
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:04,076
its internal systems are shot.

56
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:06,081
<i>These are just
incomprehensible readings.</i>

57
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:07,011
By design.

58
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:10,055
There's no design here,
Rodney, just meaningless data.

59
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:12,919
But my instincts tell me that's because
they're running an advanced masking

60
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,431
program, to fool us.

61
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:17,209
- They're good, I'm better.
- Who's "they", Rodney?

62
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,259
Just...

63
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,387
do me a favour.
Re-launch your decryp sweep.

64
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:23,163
Humour me.

65
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:25,630
Fine.

66
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,229
We don't have to stand waiting
for the results. Could take hours.

67
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,628
- Why don't we go back to the Gate?
- Hang on.

68
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,259
It's working. I'm getting something.

69
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,313
Hey, don't touch anything!

70
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:50,816
- What happened? What did you do?
- Nothing!

71
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:52,797
- Told you not to touch anything!
- I didn't!

72
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:55,831
- The program must have crashed.
- You lost all the data!

73
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:58,979
- What did you see, Rodney?
- Nanite code.

74
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:01,062
<i>It's the Replicators.</i>

86
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,128
It's the Replicators. They've found us.

87
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:11,142
Are you sure?

88
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:13,006
The drone we recovered
contained nanites.

89
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:15,949
You cannot be certain of that. The
program went down before we had a chance

90
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:18,440
- to retrieve any significant data.
- I know what I saw.

91
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,833
It was nanite code a
split second before the system crashed.

92
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,640
- I saw nothing.
- You weren't looking.

93
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,715
Our laptops were retrieving
the same data stream.

94
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:26,668
If there had been anything,
I'd have seen it.

95
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:31,025
Obviously you didn't, otherwise we would
not be having this dis... Another one!

96
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,447
- <i>Colonel Sheppard. Major Lorne here.</i>
- Go ahead, Major.

97
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,672
<i>There's been an explosion in Dr. McKay's
lab. I suggest you get down here.</i>

98
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:45,258
What the...

99
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:47,892
What happened?

100
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:49,758
Well,

101
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,193
either your sandwich exploded

102
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:55,843
or that mystery drone
had a built-in self-destruct protocol.

103
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,155
We must have inadvertently initiated it
when we ran our analysis.

104
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:00,361
Sorry, Doc.

105
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:02,847
At least you weren't around
when it went off.

106
00:06:05,383 --> 00:06:06,326
Lucky us!

107
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:12,336
Something's not right.

108
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:15,117
That diagnostic program
should never have crashed.

109
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:18,098
It's perfectly capable of handling
any of the data coming from the probe.

110
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:20,854
then before we get a chance to get it
up and running again, what happens?

111
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:22,290
The probe gets destroyed.

112
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,324
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know. I just

113
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:29,047
it feels like someone or something
is working very hard to get in my way.

114
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:31,690
And yes, I know
what that sounds like. Just

115
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,186
do me a favour: keep an eye out, OK?

116
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:46,048
Think he's imagining it?

117
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,594
Maybe he needs a vacation.

118
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,641
I guess you disagree, huh?

119
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,879
I don't know. Just seems like people
are acting different lately.

120
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,578
- Different?
- I don't know how to explain it.

121
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:05,123
They just haven't been themselves.

122
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,819
Teyla's noticed it too.

123
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,901
Well,

124
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:18,318
maybe everyone's getting a little

125
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,230
stir crazy not being able
to get offworld. You know,

126
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,555
acting a little

127
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:25,155
- weird, getting a little paranoid.
- I'm not paranoid.

128
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:29,243
People have been acting weird lately.

129
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:41,588
You make a compelling argument!

130
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:44,131
I think you're gonna need stitches.

131
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:48,809
Here.

132
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:53,599
Sorry.

133
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:00,574
What happened?

134
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:03,397
Well, Ronon decided to knock
some sense into me.

135
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,758
Well, let me take a look.

136
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:13,718
You're fine.

137
00:08:14,948 --> 00:08:16,019
No stitches?

138
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:17,960
No. Not even a Band-Aid.

139
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:20,417
There's nothing there.

140
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,054
Well, I'm bleeding.

141
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:27,713
Well, not from any head wound.
It was probably Ronon's blood.

142
00:08:28,683 --> 00:08:29,413
No.

143
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:32,655
He hit me. I was bleeding.

144
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,352
Run a scan on me.

145
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,053
- A scan?
- If McKay's right

146
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:43,348
and there are nanites in that probe,
there's a good chance I got infected.

147
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:46,730
OK.

148
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,376
Hold still.

149
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,523
No nanites.

150
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,528
You're clean.

151
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:18,596
- Run a blood test.
- John,

152
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:20,979
- if you were infected with nanites...
- Forget the nanites.

153
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:25,051
Something like this happened to me
before. I got infected with a retrovirus

154
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:28,570
- and I was able to heal right away.
- I'm sure that's not the case now,

155
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:32,153
- since you haven't been exposed...
- Maybe it's a relapse. I don't know.

156
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:35,118
- I seriously doubt...
- Just run a blood test.

157
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:40,759
Okay.

158
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:54,610
<i>I thought the problem was dealt with.
I destroyed the drone.</i>

159
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:57,550
<i>You made them suspicious in the process.</i>

160
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:00,034
So what do you suggest we do?

161
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,312
They're still a long way
from knowing the truth.

162
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:06,183
For now, we just

163
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:07,842
need to be careful.

164
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,295
Colonel. I got your test results back.

165
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:19,030
I'm pleased to tell you
you're one hundred percent bug-free.

166
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,551
No sign of the retrovirus
in your system.

167
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:25,974
What's the matter?
I thought you'd be happy.

168
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:30,076
All that says is my blood's clean.
Doesn't explain the magical head wound.

169
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:33,244
Maybe it doesn't make sense because
you're refusing to consider the only

170
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:36,978
possible explanation for what happened.
You made a mistake.

171
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:41,689
Ronon wasn't bleeding.
I checked.

172
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:44,461
Well, maybe the blood
was already on the towel

173
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:47,020
and you mistakenly
transferred it to your forehead.

174
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,384
Ronon saw the cut.

175
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:51,048
He was the one
who said I needed stitches.

176
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:53,162
Unless he was wrong too.

177
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:57,876
All right. Well,
I'll run your blood work again and

178
00:10:57,996 --> 00:11:00,820
if I still can't find anything,
we'll do a complete physical.

179
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,475
- Hey.
- Hey.

180
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:19,206
What are you all doing here?
What's going on?

181
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,940
I'll be right back. I just remembered I
forgot to unplug something, or plug...

182
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:29,232
- Wait, wait. What are you doing?
- This may hurt a little.

183
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:31,554
What?! No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait!

184
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:37,875
- What is the matter with you?
- Here.

185
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:40,380
I'm gonna need more than that,
disinfectant and some stitches...

186
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:41,986
Shut up and hold on a second.

187
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:45,046
All right.

188
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,808
Let's take a look.

189
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:54,629
It's gone!
That's impossible! How could it...

190
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:56,758
That's the reaction we were hoping for.

191
00:11:56,994 --> 00:12:00,872
If it's any consolation, I can assure
you we all underwent the same test.

192
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:03,441
Test? What test?
What the hell's going on here?

193
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:05,077
That's what we'd like to find out.

194
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:07,659
Rodney, you're not the only one
who's noticed the strange behaviour

195
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:09,576
of many of the people on this base.

196
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,994
<i>They've been acting
unusually withdrawn, even secretive.</i>

197
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:13,977
Yeah.

198
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,535
I wasn't sure what to make of it.

199
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,622
At first, I was ready to dismiss
Zelenka's screw-up as just gross

200
00:12:19,742 --> 00:12:23,757
incompetence, but I thought
it didn't make sense, even for him.

201
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:26,002
No, no, that was no accident.

202
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:28,635
I mean, he crashed
that diagnostic system on purpose.

203
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:31,282
I'm assuming what happened
with that drone was no accident either.

204
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:33,824
What does this have to do
with my super-healing abilities?

205
00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:36,110
Last night Ronon clubbed me in the head.

206
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:37,412
By accident...

207
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:39,431
- sort of.
<i>- I was cut.</i>

208
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,562
I went to the Infirmary to have
Keller check it out

209
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:43,852
by the time I got there
it was completely healed.

210
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,595
But the last time that happened,
it was the, it was the retrovirus.

211
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,816
That's what I thought,
so I had her run a blood test.

212
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,708
- And?
- She says she didn't find anything.

213
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,913
- What, you think she's lying?
- I don't know, but we gotta find out.

214
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:56,506
Well, I can access the Infirmary's
database from here. Just...

215
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:05,953
OK, I'm in.

216
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,534
Now...

217
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:09,303
And...

218
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:13,168
What?

219
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,256
There's no record of any blood test. If
she did, she didn't enter the results.

220
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:17,988
She did a full body scan too.

221
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,778
- Well, there's nothing here.
<i>- That's impossible.</i>

222
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:23,072
The scanner is wired directly
into the computer.

223
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:25,969
- Results are recorded automatically.
- It doesn't mean they can't be erased.

224
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:29,633
All right. We need to run our own tests.
Until we figure out what's going on,

225
00:13:29,753 --> 00:13:31,777
we can't risk trusting anyone
outside this room.

226
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:34,842
We have to get to the infirmary
without anyone knowing.

227
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:38,474
I have an idea.

228
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:43,018
How's it goin', Rodney?

229
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:46,086
<i>I've patched into the life signs
detector, but there's a problem.</i>

230
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:47,417
What problem?

231
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,259
Just... I'm not sure.
Just hold on a minute.

232
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:54,169
- Looks like it's working fine to me.
- Right! Thank you for your input.

233
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:56,599
Is the infirmary clear?

234
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:57,938
Hold on.

235
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:00,184
Rodney!

236
00:14:00,446 --> 00:14:03,266
This is bizarre. I can't get it
to give me a live feed. It's like

237
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:04,554
it's stuck in a loop.

238
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:05,910
Well, fix it!

239
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:13,266
All right, I got it.

240
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:21,806
What the hell?!

241
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:23,114
Oh, now you broke it.

242
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:25,440
I didn't break it!
It's working fine!

243
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,230
Is the infirmary clear or not?

244
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,815
Yeah, the infirmary,
the corridors, the surrounding towers.

245
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:32,035
According to this,
we're the only people on the base!

246
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:34,666
- How's that possible?
- <i>Off-hand, I would say it's not,</i>

247
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:37,097
<i>but right now
I am reading four life signs.</i>

248
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:41,639
Let's keep moving.

249
00:14:49,752 --> 00:14:51,024
We have a problem.

250
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,865
All right. Let's make this quick.

251
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:08,301
I've got something.

252
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,092
It's another life sign.
It's the outer edge of the City.

253
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,306
Let's check it out. Come on.

254
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:18,488
Maybe we should...

255
00:15:18,608 --> 00:15:19,608
<i>Come on!</i>

256
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,401
What the hell?

257
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:34,185
Nanites!

258
00:15:57,444 --> 00:15:59,505
There's supposed to be a room here.

259
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:07,798
There is a room here.

260
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:09,871
Wait.

261
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:29,780
Easy, easy.

262
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:33,012
How did you get here?

263
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:37,394
- I don't know.
<i>- I can answer that.</i>

264
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:40,737
This is where we made her.

265
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,461
This is where we made you all.

266
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,309
This explains why
we can heal so rapidly.

267
00:16:51,873 --> 00:16:54,714
We get injured
and the nanites effect repairs.

268
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,231
- We'd better tell the others.
- Yes.

269
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,788
That won't be necessary.

270
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:02,360
What the hell's going on?

271
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,771
I'm sorry, Colonel.

272
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:05,692
You're gonna have to come with us.

273
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:07,648
I don't think so.

274
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:12,212
That won't do you any good.

275
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,827
I'm warning you, Major. Stand down.

276
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:18,275
Go ahead. Shoot.

277
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,793
You see?

278
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:29,798
You're Replicators.

279
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:30,999
That's right.

280
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,351
Until you began making
changes to our base code,

281
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:37,717
we were forbidden from assuming
the form of any living human,

282
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:40,127
but now we can take any form we like.

283
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:54,300
You couldn't have replaced
everyone on the base. It's impossible!

284
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,315
Only because you believe
this is the real Atlantis,

285
00:17:57,435 --> 00:17:59,418
and that you're the real Doctor McKay.

286
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,678
So you're saying that
we're also Replicators?

287
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:08,699
No.

288
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:11,296
You are flesh and blood

289
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,927
<i>ordinary humans in every way</i>

290
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:16,139
<i>except that you were manufactured
from the inside out by nanites,</i>

291
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:19,376
some of which remain in your system,
effecting repairs as necessary.

292
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:20,586
I'm not buying it.

293
00:18:20,814 --> 00:18:22,019
<i>All that you are</i>

294
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:24,179
your thoughts, your memories

295
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:26,393
everything was taken
from the real John Sheppard

296
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:29,485
and his team when their minds
were probed over a year ago.

297
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,566
See, now I know you're lying,
because

298
00:18:33,686 --> 00:18:36,700
a year ago Carson Beckett was
our Chief of Medicine, not Dr. Keller.

299
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,171
she hadn't even arrived yet.

300
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:40,228
This scenario was
updated with information

301
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:42,260
obtained from the last member
of your expedition

302
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,875
to be captured by the Replicators.

303
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:48,532
Elizabeth Weir.

304
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:02,130
You sure about this?

305
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,597
I need to see for myself.

306
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:28,575
Oh my God.

307
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,667
All right.
We're all infected by nanites.

308
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:32,548
Not infected with, constructed by.

309
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,807
- I don't believe it.
- I know it's tough to swallow.

310
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:37,348
I'm having a hard time wrapping
my head around it myself, but

311
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,456
- it would explain a couple of things.
- Such as?

312
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:41,424
Such as why the Gate's not working,
for one.

313
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:44,213
If none of this is real, if this is all
just a lab rat experiment,

314
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,402
then it stands to reason
the Gate's not real either.

315
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:48,092
If this is not the real Atlantis,

316
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:50,528
you of all people would have noticed.
The stars alone...

317
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,358
The whole time the Gate's been down,
it has been solid overcast.

318
00:19:53,478 --> 00:19:55,205
That's over a week now.
Think about it:

319
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:57,572
when was the last time
any of you saw stars?

320
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,362
That's what you named me.

321
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:21,064
<i>There's no point in
calling you anything else.</i>

322
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,599
You're exactly like her in every way.

323
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:25,503
Except that I'm not her.

324
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:28,626
No.

325
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:33,276
The real Elizabeth Weir
was killed several months ago.

326
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:38,033
<i>Part of her brain
had been replaced by nanites.</i>

327
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:40,875
It was done to save her life but

328
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:43,163
it made her dangerous.

329
00:20:44,315 --> 00:20:46,641
<i>Whenever she linked
with other Replicators,</i>

330
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:50,084
<i>the human part of her exerted
an unhealthy influence</i>

331
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:53,004
at least, that's the way Oberoth saw it.

332
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:54,505
But you don't agree?

333
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,980
Why do you think we did all this?

334
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,747
Your humanity is what
we're interested in.

335
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:06,990
Because the Ancients created us
with one fatal flaw.

336
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:08,491
You can't ascend.

337
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:11,572
That's what you're after, isn't it?

338
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:15,318
All right, I know this is a lot
for everyone to deal with,

339
00:21:15,438 --> 00:21:17,197
but we're just gonna have to...

340
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:18,580
suck it up and

341
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:21,545
- re-focus.
- Re-focus on what?

342
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:23,873
- Getting the hell out of here.
- So we can go where?

343
00:21:23,993 --> 00:21:27,010
Back to Atlantis to resume our lives?
Yeah, I forgot, they're not ours.

344
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:29,287
- Says them.
- There's no point in denying the facts.

345
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:31,730
They were telling the truth.
We're not who we thought we were.

346
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:33,600
Well, I may not be the original, but

347
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,055
you're gonna have a hard time convincing
me that I'm not pretty damned close.

348
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:39,412
Our origins do not make us
any less human,

349
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,269
not physically
and certainly not mentally.

350
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:42,966
Not while we can think for ourselves.

351
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:46,342
And in my heart there is no doubt,
we must return to Atlantis.

352
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:47,253
OK.

353
00:21:47,837 --> 00:21:50,019
We'll go back,
take things from there.

354
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:54,008
Great! We're all in agreement,
we're gettin' out of here.

355
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:56,639
Now, all we have to do
is figure out how!

356
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:01,044
You're part of Niam's group.

357
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:02,898
Most were reprogrammed, but

358
00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:05,612
some of us managed to stay hidden
within the collective.

359
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:09,856
You think by studying us,
you'll discover the secret ingredient?

360
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:11,597
You're all fully human.

361
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:16,035
You have the same minds as your
original selves, the same thoughts,

362
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:17,693
the same emotions.

363
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:21,956
More importantly, you have
something that's always eluded us,

364
00:22:23,148 --> 00:22:26,026
something that kept your kind
apart from the very beginning and

365
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,710
made you special
in the eyes of our creators.

366
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:31,131
You would call it a soul.

367
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:35,008
It is that "secret ingredient"
you referred to,

368
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:38,674
the key to ascension.

369
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:43,700
That is not something you can learn
to acquire simply by studying us.

370
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,247
Why not?

371
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:48,953
The human brain is just
an electro-chemical machine,

372
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,796
biologically created, but

373
00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:53,735
a machine nonetheless.

374
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:56,198
Everything is quantifiable.

375
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,831
Now you sound like Oberoth.

376
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,298
The others have given up on ascension.

377
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:06,006
They're destroying
human populations throughout

378
00:23:06,174 --> 00:23:09,050
the galaxy as a tactic
in their war with the Wraith.

379
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:12,321
They're consumed
with hatred and revenge.

380
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:16,938
We believe there is another path.

381
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:18,882
Why are you telling me all this?

382
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:21,619
You're open-minded,

383
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:24,989
and it's important that we gauge your
reactions.

384
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:25,990
Why?

385
00:23:26,793 --> 00:23:29,460
So we can avoid
the same mistakes next time.

386
00:23:35,337 --> 00:23:38,863
They're gonna wipe our memories
and then start again on another planet.

387
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:42,832
That probe was sent by Oberoth
and the other Replicators.

388
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:44,490
Our friends  tried to destroy it,

389
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,480
- but they only managed to disable it.
- If it hadn't crashed into the City,

390
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,056
- who knows how long it'd have gone on?
- Yeah, but the point is,

391
00:23:50,176 --> 00:23:51,626
this position's been compromised.

392
00:23:51,748 --> 00:23:54,485
Once the other Replicators find
this city, they'll destroy it.

393
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:56,467
Oh, yeah, and us too.

394
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,047
Is that any worse
than having our memories erased

395
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:01,046
and starting this whole process again?

396
00:24:02,104 --> 00:24:03,736
We've gotta find a way out of here.

397
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:11,027
I'm sorry it's come to this.

398
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,931
Listen to me.

399
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:14,371
You have probed our minds.

400
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:16,760
You know everything
there is to know about us.

401
00:24:16,894 --> 00:24:19,002
You should know,
we will never accept this.

402
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:22,297
No matter how many times you wipe our
memories, we'll always figure it out.

403
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:25,663
She's right. We're genetically
pre-disposed to being...

404
00:24:25,817 --> 00:24:27,677
stubborn, really pesky.

405
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:31,379
You want to understand
what it means to be human, right?

406
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:35,893
You wanna know what qualities
might eventually lead to ascension?

407
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:39,105
You can start with compassion.

408
00:24:40,683 --> 00:24:42,818
I understand what you're saying,

409
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:47,337
and under different circumstances
I might even agree with you.

410
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:50,933
Unfortunately, it's too late.

411
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:52,493
What are you talking about?

412
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:55,622
The other Replicators have found us.

413
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:08,725
They failed to break down
our mental defences

414
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:12,430
and bring us back into the collective,
so now they want to destroy us.

415
00:25:12,592 --> 00:25:14,552
Well, you have to raise the shield!

416
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:15,859
We can't.

417
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:19,089
Your creation required too much power

418
00:25:19,608 --> 00:25:21,471
and we couldn't get
our hands on multiple ZPMs

419
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:23,570
without drawing too much attention.

420
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:26,166
Let us out.

421
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:30,239
Your fellow Replicators
are targeting human worlds.

422
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:33,763
<i>They are murdering thousands
of innocent people.</i>

423
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:36,120
<i>If you are serious about
following the footsteps</i>

424
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:39,415
of your creators, you will
let us go so we can stop this.

425
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:42,263
Oberoth is too powerful.

426
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:44,170
<i>If this city falls</i>

427
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:46,664
and we're destroyed with it,
this will be nothing more

428
00:25:46,784 --> 00:25:49,186
than a wasted opportunity

429
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:51,594
a failed experiment.

430
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:55,878
<i>You know what that feels like.</i>

431
00:25:56,782 --> 00:25:59,301
That's what the Ancients considered us

432
00:26:00,397 --> 00:26:01,688
failed experiments.

433
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:04,148
Well, now's your chance
to prove 'em wrong.

434
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:08,609
All we are asking is that you give us
a chance to make a difference.

435
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,057
Take this.

436
00:26:38,219 --> 00:26:39,088
What's this?

437
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:41,394
It's the core drive
of a ship's tracking system.

438
00:26:41,853 --> 00:26:44,556
With this, you should be able
to pinpoint the locations and movements

439
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:47,358
of every one of Oberoth's
Aurora-class vessels in this galaxy.

440
00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:51,320
Take this to Atlantis... it will be
their best chance of stopping Oberoth.

441
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:53,614
Go up to the Bay... take a Jumper.

442
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:56,996
Come with us.

443
00:26:57,464 --> 00:27:00,214
I can't.
Oberoth might be able to track me.

444
00:27:00,522 --> 00:27:02,749
I'll only be a liability.

445
00:27:03,002 --> 00:27:03,724
Go.

446
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,445
That's it.

447
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:33,292
The city's gone.

448
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:37,733
So now what?

449
00:27:38,927 --> 00:27:39,735
<i>Well,</i>

450
00:27:40,716 --> 00:27:42,100
we're already cloaked.

451
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:45,467
All we need to do is follow
the ship out of the atmosphere

452
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,082
and catch a ride before
it jumps into hyperspace.

453
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:49,775
"Catch a ride"?

454
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:50,866
Yeah.

455
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:52,590
Watch.

456
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:07,375
Re-appoint drive pods.

457
00:28:11,414 --> 00:28:13,260
Nice and snug.

458
00:28:41,663 --> 00:28:44,547
- You doing OK?
- Sure, all things considered.

459
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,811
Not bad for a dead woman.

460
00:28:47,931 --> 00:28:49,566
Everything'll be fine.

461
00:28:49,824 --> 00:28:52,023
My guess is we're headed back
to the replicator homeworld.

462
00:28:52,143 --> 00:28:54,277
Once we get there,
we can find a ship with a hyperdrive.

463
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:56,798
And go where?

464
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,365
Well, obviously
we can't fly straight back to Atlantis.

465
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,119
They'd probably take us out before
we had a chance to explain but

466
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,293
maybe New Athos.

467
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:07,331
We can contact them once we get there.

468
00:29:07,493 --> 00:29:08,916
And then what?

469
00:29:09,986 --> 00:29:12,712
<i>How do you think the real Sheppard's
gonna react when he sees you?</i>

470
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:15,256
How would you react?

471
00:29:19,323 --> 00:29:20,801
In a way, I'm lucky.

472
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:23,431
At least I know I'm the only
Elizabeth Weir out there.

473
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,192
<i>You were right.</i>

474
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:39,068
It's the replicator homeworld.
Looks like they've been busy.

475
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,257
What do you mean?

476
00:29:41,925 --> 00:29:44,535
Remember those shipyards we destroyed?
That's one of them.

477
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,309
They rebuilt it.

478
00:29:46,573 --> 00:29:48,247
- And then some!
<i>- Good.</i>

479
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,876
Then we should be able to find
a ship they won't miss.

480
00:29:56,175 --> 00:29:59,180
It's a streamlining programme designed
to boost its operating efficiency.

481
00:29:59,304 --> 00:30:02,494
Look, the Gate will be offline for,
what, one hour, two hours tops.

482
00:30:06,803 --> 00:30:09,380
- We expecting someone?
- No, Sir,

483
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:13,542
but it's Major Jordan
reporting in from M34-227.

484
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:15,900
- You got video?
- Yes, Sir.

485
00:30:18,654 --> 00:30:21,072
- What's the situation, Major?
- <i>Well, Sir,</i>

486
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:24,450
<i>there's someone here
who would like to have a word with you.</i>

487
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,352
<i>Hello, John.</i>

488
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:43,260
Elizabeth! What happened to you?
How did you get away?

489
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:47,264
<i>I'm not Elizabeth.
Well, not the Elizabeth you knew.</i>

490
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:52,636
<i>I have all of her memories
and all of her thoughts...</i>

491
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,445
<i>everything that makes her me.</i>

492
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,233
<i>But I'm a duplicate.</i>

493
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:01,388
<i>I was created
by a faction of the Replicators</i>

494
00:31:01,508 --> 00:31:03,739
<i>as a means to attaining ascension.</i>

495
00:31:04,793 --> 00:31:07,743
But you... look and sound just like her.

496
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,787
<i>I'm sorry, Rodney, but it's true.</i>

497
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:12,837
<i>This group managed to isolate themselves</i>

498
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,433
<i>from the others in order
to pursue their study in secrecy,</i>

499
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,170
<i>but they were eventually
discovered and destroyed.</i>

500
00:31:19,735 --> 00:31:21,543
I... don't know what to say.

501
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,467
This is all very,

502
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:24,885
<i>Strange?</i>

503
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:29,119
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

504
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:31,183
<i>But we need to meet.</i>

505
00:31:31,658 --> 00:31:35,215
<i>We have some information that
you can use against the Replicators.</i>

506
00:31:35,446 --> 00:31:36,331
"We"?

507
00:31:51,228 --> 00:31:53,728
Well, I suppose introductions
aren't really necessary.

508
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:56,418
Great... Last time I came
face to face with myself,

509
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:58,516
I ended up kicking my own ass.

510
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:01,516
<i>Nice jacket!</i>

511
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:04,478
Yeah, it's new.

512
00:32:04,921 --> 00:32:05,959
We got...

513
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:08,993
new versions of those uniforms.
The old ones used to...

514
00:32:09,113 --> 00:32:10,824
bunch up under the arms.

515
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:11,843
Yeah.

516
00:32:14,228 --> 00:32:16,729
- You said you've got something for us.
- <i>Yeah!</i>

517
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:21,025
No, my McKay.

518
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:23,194
Oh, yeah, right.

519
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,291
What is that?

520
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:33,687
This is the core drive
of a replicator ship tracking system.

521
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:35,810
Once it is up and running,
we'll be able to track

522
00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:38,417
every Aurora-class replicator ship
in the Pegasus galaxy.

523
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,294
It's not much, but it's a start.

524
00:32:40,456 --> 00:32:41,932
Are you kidding?! This is huge!

525
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:44,006
We can get working
on a modification program...

526
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:46,586
- reconfigure the sequencing...
- run it through an Ancient relays

527
00:32:46,706 --> 00:32:48,991
so the information's automatically
adapted and outputted.

528
00:32:49,127 --> 00:32:50,971
"Outputted"? Is that even a word?

529
00:32:51,514 --> 00:32:53,516
- Of course it is!
- We can't both be wrong.

530
00:32:54,078 --> 00:32:55,801
Look, we need
to get started on this now.

531
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,324
Not so fast.

532
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:59,232
Where do you plan on doing this?

533
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:01,732
We're too big of a security risk
to be allowed back on Atlantis.

534
00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:03,262
He's got a...

535
00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:04,862
I've got a point.

536
00:33:04,986 --> 00:33:07,181
You two are gonna have
to find another way to do that.

537
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:09,643
Not a problem. I'll just go back
to Atlantis, get what we need.

538
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:11,748
- We can do the work here.
- Oh, this is great!

539
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:13,917
Finally, someone in whom
I can have 100% confidence!

540
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,763
I'm looking forward to working with you!

541
00:33:15,883 --> 00:33:16,943
<i>Just the beginning!</i>

542
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:20,153
Humanity's about to benefit from one
of the greatest living scientific minds

543
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:21,201
times two!

544
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:23,420
- Can you imagine?!
- I'm trying not to.

545
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:30,242
We appreciate all this,
but the truth is,

546
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:32,680
we came here for another reason.

547
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:34,823
You were with the Replicators.

548
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,977
What do you know about our Elizabeth,
are you willing to help us get her back?

549
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,900
You think this other Keller
was telling the truth?

550
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:48,881
I don't know why she'd lie.

551
00:33:50,304 --> 00:33:51,947
It's kinda weird, that's all.

552
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,169
I mean,

553
00:33:53,496 --> 00:33:57,111
I don't see you for all this time,
then five minutes later I find out...

554
00:33:57,889 --> 00:33:59,216
That I'm dead.

555
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:01,409
Yeah.

556
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:05,235
Don't worry...
the moment I learned the truth,

557
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:08,533
I knew there'd be no going back
the way things were... not for me,

558
00:34:08,794 --> 00:34:10,121
not for any of us.

559
00:34:11,797 --> 00:34:14,343
- I don't like him.
- I know, it's odd.

560
00:34:14,497 --> 00:34:16,420
I know I'm me,
so who the hell's this other guy?

561
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,727
He's you as well.

562
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:19,304
No, there's only one me.

563
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,919
Apparently not!

564
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,804
He's nothing but a copy, then.

565
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,148
From what I understand,

566
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:28,378
even though he's not the original,
he's as much Ronon Dex as you are.

567
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:29,955
I don't like him.

568
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:35,983
I didn't really believe it...
not until we got out here.

569
00:34:36,137 --> 00:34:37,406
I know.

570
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,618
I was holding out hope as well.

571
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,252
I thought that
the Replicators had captured us

572
00:34:42,387 --> 00:34:44,617
and implanted the nanites
and that they were...

573
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,214
lying to us to keep us
from wanting to return.

574
00:34:47,348 --> 00:34:49,521
Yeah, well, it worked.
I'm not going back with them.

575
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:51,444
What?

576
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:52,964
I've been on my own before.

577
00:34:53,117 --> 00:34:55,014
At least, that's how I remember it.

578
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:57,418
Now I've got these nanites
that'll heal me if I get injured.

579
00:34:57,593 --> 00:35:00,771
You are not invincible.
The nanites can only do so much.

580
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,707
Yeah, well, I'll take my chances.

581
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:07,130
I understand your anger
and your disappointment,

582
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,944
but it makes no difference
who came first.

583
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:12,169
You're as much Ronon as he is.

584
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:13,186
Oh yeah?

585
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:16,322
Why's he leading my life on Atlantis
while I'm treated like an outsider?

586
00:35:17,438 --> 00:35:19,611
Their circumstances are different.

587
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,977
You mean we make them
feel uncomfortable,

588
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:24,439
so they'd rather not have us around.

589
00:35:25,304 --> 00:35:28,684
Given our origins,
they see us as a potential threat.

590
00:35:28,804 --> 00:35:30,323
Can you blame them?

591
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:33,246
I guess not.

592
00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:34,969
I'd probably do the same.

593
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:37,763
Still, it doesn't change the...

594
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:47,916
- We'll go back to the camp.
- We'll go find Sheppard and Weir.

595
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:55,762
It's not like
this hasn't happened before.

596
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,818
The other Elizabeth got infected
by those little nanite things

597
00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:02,839
and we figured out how to
stop them somehow.

598
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:05,582
Maybe we can do the same for you.

599
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,397
So we wouldn't be a security threat?

600
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:11,916
You can contribute.

601
00:36:12,396 --> 00:36:13,858
Things'll just be...

602
00:36:14,242 --> 00:36:15,281
different.

603
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,639
That's not really the issue, John.

604
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:23,377
I guess what really bothers me

605
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:25,762
is just knowing that you and the others

606
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:28,272
will always consider me less
than what I really am.

607
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:33,235
- That's not true.
- Of course it is...

608
00:36:33,973 --> 00:36:35,279
and I don't blame you.

609
00:36:37,798 --> 00:36:39,700
D'you hear something?

610
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:49,510
<i>Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla.
Please respond.</i>

611
00:36:49,664 --> 00:36:51,128
Go ahead, Teyla. What's wrong?

612
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,512
The Replicators are here.

613
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,331
They managed to track the ship.

614
00:36:57,847 --> 00:37:00,647
- <i>John, do you hear me?</i>
- Oh, yeah, I heard you.

615
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:10,814
<i>Our ship must have had
a hidden sub-space transponder.</i>

616
00:37:11,134 --> 00:37:13,083
All right, run.

617
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,817
What was that?

618
00:37:28,244 --> 00:37:30,687
- That way. Come on.
- Ronon, wait!

619
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:40,676
- Where's McKay?
- He's still at the compound.

620
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:43,972
Rodney, this is Sheppard. We need you
to fall back to the Gate immediately.

621
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:47,267
<i>Colonel, this is Major Jordan.
The Gate is a no-go.</i>

622
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:48,977
<i>I repeat, the Gate is a no-go.</i>

623
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:50,813
<i>There's a replicator ship in position</i>

624
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:53,148
<i>ready to take us out the second
we show ourselves.</i>

625
00:37:53,444 --> 00:37:55,276
All right, everybody
fall back to the Jumper.

626
00:37:55,412 --> 00:37:56,944
- Rodney, did you hear me?
- <i>Yeah,</i>

627
00:37:57,106 --> 00:37:58,654
<i>I heard you. We're on our way.</i>

628
00:37:59,683 --> 00:38:01,740
Regarding the Gate:
they have us trapped.

629
00:38:01,902 --> 00:38:04,535
Even cloaked, if the Jumper
so much as rustles a bush,

630
00:38:04,697 --> 00:38:07,454
they will pinpoint our position
and blast us out of the sky.

631
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:09,456
We need a diversion.

632
00:38:17,368 --> 00:38:20,092
- What happened?
- <i>It's the Replicators. Let's go.</i>

633
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:22,761
We'll all have a better chance this way.

634
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:25,764
I don't want you doing this
because you feel any less,

635
00:38:26,245 --> 00:38:27,265
human?

636
00:38:28,637 --> 00:38:30,842
From the beginning we've been
trying to convince ourselves

637
00:38:30,996 --> 00:38:32,650
that we're just like you.

638
00:38:33,534 --> 00:38:35,630
Now we've got a chance to prove it.

639
00:38:35,996 --> 00:38:36,996
All right.

640
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:38,444
Let's go.

641
00:39:45,363 --> 00:39:46,267
Yeah.

642
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:48,036
We tricked you,

643
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,975
but don't feel so bad. After all,
we almost had ourselves convinced.

644
00:39:58,652 --> 00:39:59,863
Shut it down!

645
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:03,748
No-one else is coming.

646
00:40:09,553 --> 00:40:11,264
Shall we take a break?

647
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:12,918
You go ahead.

648
00:40:13,303 --> 00:40:15,918
Oh, Rodney, we've been working
for five hours straight.

649
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:19,053
- We should take a break.
- Yeah, I will... when I'm finished.

650
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:25,167
- I know what you're trying to do.
- Yeah, what's that?

651
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:29,648
Lose yourself in your work
to avoid thinking about Elizabeth.

652
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:33,687
You must realise
it's only a temporary distraction.

653
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,709
That's one of the perks of the job.
Something terrible happens,

654
00:40:36,832 --> 00:40:39,574
you don't have time to dwell on it...
you're too busy trying to stop the next

655
00:40:39,694 --> 00:40:41,191
terrible thing from happening.

656
00:40:42,217 --> 00:40:45,563
Seriously, if it wasn't
for the Replicators and their

657
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:47,890
plan to wipe out
every human in the galaxy,

658
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:50,159
I'd be in pretty bad shape right now.

659
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:53,704
Now, this is Carson all over again
and I'm just not ready to deal.

660
00:40:54,776 --> 00:40:55,719
Not yet.

661
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:00,680
You're not the only one who misses him,
Rodney.

662
00:41:03,392 --> 00:41:06,216
- Don't suppose you wanna talk about it.
- Eventually, but not now.

663
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,583
- Shall I get you anything?
- No.

664
00:41:18,814 --> 00:41:19,930
Thank you.

665
00:41:21,776 --> 00:41:23,468
You're welcome, Rodney.

666
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:47,424
- How's it going?
- It's all right.

667
00:41:49,526 --> 00:41:53,006
- Why don't you call it a night?
- No, I wanna finish this.

668
00:41:53,506 --> 00:41:55,353
What about you...
isn't it past your bedtime?

669
00:41:55,487 --> 00:41:58,276
I'll approve the removal
of her personal items tomorrow...

670
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:01,730
have everything shipped back to Earth.

671
00:42:03,108 --> 00:42:06,031
I would have done it sooner,
but I actually thought we were gonna

672
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:07,277
bring her back.

673
00:42:08,032 --> 00:42:08,935
Yeah.

674
00:42:10,185 --> 00:42:11,166
Me too.

675
00:42:13,012 --> 00:42:15,165
Let me know when
you get this thing working.

676
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:16,377
Will do.

677
00:42:17,299 --> 00:42:18,434
Oh! Wait!

678
00:42:22,127 --> 00:42:23,394
If this works,

679
00:42:23,514 --> 00:42:26,180
we should be able to track
every Aurora-class replicator ship

680
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,550
in the galaxy in real-time.

681
00:42:34,165 --> 00:42:37,589
That's not so bad. I guess
the Wraith have really taken a toll.

682
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:43,068
On the other hand, my duplicate
did say they were building more.

683
