1
00:00:00,528 --> 00:00:02,337
<i>You can go ahead, Rodney.</i>

2
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:05,237
<i>- I don't remember how it's start.
- Sure you do.</i>

3
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:06,112
<i>No.</i>

4
00:00:06,232 --> 00:00:08,599
<i>Start with your name,
like we've been doing, okay?</i>

5
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:10,115
<i>I just go for now.</i>

6
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,017
<i>My name.
My name, is...</i>

7
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:16,823
<i>Mister Rodney McKay.</i>

8
00:00:16,943 --> 00:00:18,584
<i>- No.
- Yes.</i>

9
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:21,353
<i>Come on, you Doctor McKay,
you remember?</i>

10
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:24,624
<i>No, I'm...
I'm not anymore, I'm not...</i>

11
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:27,178
<i>smart anymore.</i>

12
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:31,974
<i>- Doctors are smart, so I'm mister now.
- Okay.</i>

13
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:37,692
<i>I used to be
the smartest person ever...</i>

14
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:40,871
<i>And... And now...
Now I'm not.</i>

15
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:43,494
<i>That's what we're trying to fix,
right?</i>

16
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:45,300
<i>No, you can't fix me.</i>

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,279
<i>You know we're trying
our very best...</i>

18
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:49,872
<i>No, you can't.
You can't. Can't...</i>

19
00:00:49,992 --> 00:00:52,728
<i>It's okay, Rodney, what's the next thing
you're supposed to say?</i>

20
00:00:52,848 --> 00:00:54,787
<i>Where...
Where did John go?</i>

21
00:00:54,907 --> 00:00:57,138
<i>He had to go away for a few minutes.
He'll be back...</i>

22
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:01,910
<i>- I'm your friend, I'm right here.
- Where are you, John?</i>

23
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:11,449
Why the hell didn't you tell me
my brother was this far gone?

24
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:14,315
- It's happened pretty fast, Jeannie.
- No, I...

25
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:18,638
I got a message from him
just a couple of weeks ago.

26
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:21,864
He seemed perfectly fine.
He'd never been so nice.

27
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:25,380
That would have been
shortly after he became infected.

28
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:29,759
- I didn't recognize the symptoms.
- It's not your fault, Doc.

29
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:31,953
Frankly, Mrs. Miller,

30
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:34,465
we contacted you
as soon as we became aware

31
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:36,826
of the seriousness
of his condition.

32
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:39,767
In fact, Daedalus dropped you off
at the first available Gate in Pegasus

33
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:43,106
because we were concerned that you
wouldn't make it here in time.

34
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:47,254
We thought you deserved a chance

35
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:48,992
to say goodbye.

36
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:56,469
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

37
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:04,141
present:

38
00:02:06,956 --> 00:02:08,923
Season 5 Episode 06
The Shrine (v. 1.00)

39
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,915
Timing by:

40
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:28,965
Golgi, Linwelin and Pikes.

41
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,629
www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

42
00:03:05,206 --> 00:03:08,956
Dr. Keller wanted to take a moment
to prepare him for your visit.

43
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:12,563
Yeah, I...
I think I need a moment myself.

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,361
How did...
How did this happen to him?

45
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:21,663
There was a little snafu
on the last mission.

46
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:25,782
Colonel Sheppard,
when you reach the research camp,

47
00:03:25,902 --> 00:03:28,606
please remind Dr. Nichols
that he is now...

48
00:03:28,888 --> 00:03:32,076
one hour and 15 minutes overdue
for his scheduled check-in.

49
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:34,425
Right, want me to smack him around
or anything?

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,669
Just the reminder, please.

51
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:45,280
Shouldn't we be concerned
for Dr. Nichols' team?

52
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,607
No, the settlement's a half hour away
from the Gate.

53
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,618
He's got them checking
in every six.

54
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:51,726
I'm sure Nichols is tired
of taking the round trip.

55
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:53,586
Still, it wouldn't hurt
to bust his chops.

56
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:56,004
That Nichols is so arrogant.

57
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,890
Amelia, I think I'm going to risk
heading down to breakfast

58
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,613
before they check in.

59
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:12,068
I just mean that...

60
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:15,592
It will probably take them some time
to get to the camp,

61
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:20,380
and then more time for Nichols
to get back to the Gate and report.

62
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:23,128
There's really no point in my...

63
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:25,574
telling you this.

64
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:27,916
- Not really, sir.
- Right.

65
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:31,468
Be back in 20 minutes.

66
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,637
Unscheduled offworld activation!

67
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:37,603
Activate the shield.

68
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:43,806
I'm not receiving an IDC.

69
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:47,132
<i>This is Sheppard.
Do not lower the shield.</i>

70
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:48,880
<i>The entire Tower will be flooded.</i>

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,141
I have no intention of doing that,
Colonel. What's your status?

72
00:04:52,487 --> 00:04:55,018
<i>It's cold and wet.
The Stargate's underwater.</i>

73
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:58,027
<i>- The entire valley's flooded.
- And it's freezing!</i>

74
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:00,508
<i>We need you to send a Jumper through
so we can stay warm and dry</i>

75
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:02,327
<i>until the water recedes.</i>

76
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,338
- Will do, Colonel, hold on.
<i>- Holding on. Sheppard out.</i>

77
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:18,029
<i>Rescue one is standing by.</i>

78
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:23,206
What's taking so long?
Why isn't the Gate disengaging?

79
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:27,451
It's the water.

80
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:29,951
The constant pressure's
forcing the wormhole to stay active,

81
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:32,720
which means we're going to have to wait
the time a Stargate can stay open.

82
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,937
38 minutes.

83
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,446
We're down to 32,

84
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:37,989
and before you say I told you so,
we had no choice.

85
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,544
- I can't stop shivering.
- You're letting the hot air

86
00:05:40,664 --> 00:05:42,062
out of your mouth.

87
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:45,473
All right, everybody,
you'll be warm soon enough.

88
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,249
I don't know,
I think I got wetter than you did.

89
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:51,479
I don't know,
I got a little damp dialing the DHD.

90
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:53,564
The research camp was farther up.

91
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,178
I'm a little concerned
for Dr. Nichols' team.

92
00:05:56,298 --> 00:05:57,095
Right.

93
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,329
Anyone at the research camp,
this is Col. Sheppard, please respond.

94
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,291
I repeat, this is Colonel Sheppard.
Please respond.

95
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,833
- I'm pretty sure they're all dead.
- We can't know that, Rodney.

96
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:14,684
The research team was studying
the effects of global warming.

97
00:06:14,804 --> 00:06:17,396
They set up camp at the foot
of a massive glacier up the valley.

98
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:20,111
- You think an ice dam broke?
- It fits.

99
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,256
The Ancients don't put Stargates
on a flood plain,

100
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,345
and I certainly don't think
the tide just came in.

101
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,781
It explains why the water's
so freezing.

102
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:35,707
Okay, so now I'm hot,
and I'm still shivering.

103
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:38,366
Were you running a fever
before we left?

104
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:40,820
I don't know, maybe.
I'm always running something.

105
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:47,428
All right,
I think the water's receded a little.

106
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:50,162
So we're going to be stuck here
all night.

107
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:53,179
In the back of a warm,
cozy Jumper, all right?

108
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:57,982
All you need to do is hold on for,
I don't know, 30 minutes or so...

109
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:14,109
- How long has he been unresponsive?
- Since he fell asleep in the Jumper.

110
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:15,229
About nine hours.

111
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,024
Let's get him to the infirmary.
I want to have a look at you guys, too.

112
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:20,278
We're good.

113
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:22,361
By that I mean now.

114
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:25,644
I think you've just made a case
for my proposal

115
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:28,054
to send a MALP ahead
of every single transit.

116
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:30,200
Stuff happens, Woolsey,
and by "stuff," I mean...

117
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,746
I know what you mean, thank you.

118
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:34,127
Why didn't you return in the Jumper
I sent you?

119
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:37,413
I ordered the rescue party to continue
the search for Nichols' team.

120
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:40,163
- There's a chance they're still alive.
- Of course.

121
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:44,279
I got to go get checked out, and then,
I'm gonna check on Rodney.

122
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,946
Well, how's our boy?

123
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:57,232
No fever, no hypothermia,
nothing on the scan at all.

124
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,221
- How about you guys?
- Like I said, we're good.

125
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:02,375
But we're not the ones
who became unconscious.

126
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:05,613
I didn't really get much sleep the night
before, and I did skimp on breakfast.

127
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:08,627
Woolsey wants to send out a MALP
before every transit now.

128
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:11,150
- That's going to get old fast.
- That's what I said.

129
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:13,788
Can I go now?
I feel a little silly lying here.

130
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:17,583
I'm keeping you for a little longer.
Besides, I ordered you dinner.

131
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:20,065
Then you can observe me eat,
because I'm famished.

132
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:22,630
- It's official. He's better.
- See you guys.

133
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,170
- Do you want me to send them in?
- Okay.

134
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:35,893
<i>Rodney's all ready for you.</i>

135
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:40,414
What am I supposed to say?

136
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:44,755
Doesn't matter.

137
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:07,633
- It's me. It's jeannie, Mer. I'm...
- You're my sister.

138
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,159
Yes.

139
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:12,376
Meredith's my...

140
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,599
real name.

141
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,180
It's your first name, that's right,

142
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:19,314
but you never liked it.

143
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:21,647
No. No, it's...

144
00:09:23,337 --> 00:09:24,540
a girl's name.

145
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:28,078
Sometimes, yes,

146
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:31,785
but you go by Rodney.

147
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:46,506
You're crying because of me.

148
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:51,260
No, I'm crying
because I've missed you very much.

149
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,346
'Cause you're my sister.

150
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,238
That's right.

151
00:09:57,657 --> 00:10:00,645
I'm... sick.

152
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:02,069
I know.

153
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:04,417
I know.

154
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:06,776
I'm here now.

155
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,192
Sweetie, I just need to go outside
for one second, okay?

156
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,719
I will be right back, I promise.

157
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:23,177
I know.

158
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:29,122
I just need a second.
I just don't want him to see.

159
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:30,541
I know how you feel.

160
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:33,367
- I felt the same way.
- I'll go back in, I will.

161
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:36,404
He needs me, and I want to be able
to say goodbye, but it's like...

162
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:39,124
- It's like he's already gone.
- I know.

163
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:42,529
There's a way.

164
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,591
What? How?

165
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:47,984
It's a place.
I've been there before.

166
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:50,127
He'll be himself again,
and you can say goodbye.

167
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,864
Then why haven't you
already taken him?

168
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:55,731
Because it's dangerous,

169
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,740
but I'm willing to risk it
if you are.

170
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:05,377
<i>All set?</i>

171
00:11:06,352 --> 00:11:09,584
<i>Remind me to register a complaint
with whose ever idea this was.</i>

172
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:11,506
<i>It was yours, actually.</i>

173
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:15,175
<i>Complaint duly registered.</i>

174
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:18,563
<i>It was a good idea to keep a record
of what's happening to you and how fast,</i>

175
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:20,511
<i>- but if you'd rather not...
- No, it's fine.</i>

176
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:22,354
<i>- Start by my name, right?
- Right.</i>

177
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,083
<i>I remembered something.</i>

178
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,084
<i>My name is Dr. Rodney McKay.
I'm head of the department</i>

179
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:31,407
<i>of science something in Atlantis
in the...</i>

180
00:11:34,947 --> 00:11:36,555
<i>Oh, for God's sake...</i>

181
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:40,217
<i>- In the Pegasus galaxy.
- Okay, not bad, keep going.</i>

182
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:42,613
<i>Jennifer, there's...</i>

183
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:45,390
<i>There's something I wanted to...</i>

184
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:50,086
<i>While I remember, while I still can,
something I wanted to say...</i>

185
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:52,558
<i>Go ahead.</i>

186
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:00,336
I wasn't expecting anyone
this late.

187
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,708
I'm one of those people who needs
all the information they can get.

188
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:09,190
This is his most recent scan.

189
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,553
This dark area
that looks like a tumor

190
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:15,882
is actually a parasitic organism.

191
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:19,718
Its tendrils spread far beyond
any hope of surgical extraction,

192
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:21,816
and it's not responding
to treatment.

193
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:24,246
Even stasis
barely slowed its progression.

194
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:26,779
There are still
a number of drug combinations that...

195
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:29,085
He was infected somehow
on his last mission?

196
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,108
Maybe, but not necessarily.

197
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:35,334
It was too small
to show up on a scan at the time,

198
00:12:36,062 --> 00:12:39,887
but in the Pegasus galaxy,
the condition is fairly common

199
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:42,755
- among the very old.
- Right, so why him?

200
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:47,061
It's possible we're all exposed to it
and fight it off.

201
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:49,837
Rodney was already suffering
from a viral infection

202
00:12:49,957 --> 00:12:52,835
when he went on the mission
at M44-5Y9, and then

203
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:56,237
- all that time in freezing water...
- So his resistance was low.

204
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:02,941
The parasite doesn't so much
as kill cells as render them dormant

205
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:06,361
for reasons
I still don't completely understand,

206
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:10,501
but the net result
is ever-diminishing brain function.

207
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:14,768
As it spreads, he'll lose motor control,
regulation of organ function...

208
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:17,987
Ronon's people call the disease
"Second Childhood."

209
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,377
- You talked to Ronon.
- Yes.

210
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:24,586
- Okay, I know what he's told you.
- That he's dying,

211
00:13:24,706 --> 00:13:26,527
- and there's nothing you can do.
- No,

212
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:29,645
I'm doing everything I can.

213
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,546
I have to ask you...

214
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:35,025
Why did you tell me you didn't recognize
the symptoms in time?

215
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:38,395
Because
he was already showing the symptoms

216
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:40,906
when he came back
from the mission, and...

217
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:42,601
I didn't see it.

218
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,457
So?

219
00:13:45,895 --> 00:13:47,935
Just what the doctor ordered.

220
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:48,954
Funny.

221
00:13:49,074 --> 00:13:50,590
You want my fruit cup?

222
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,816
- No, no, no.
- I think you do.

223
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,907
Eating from the patient's tray
is kind of frowned upon.

224
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:57,591
Jennifer, we practically dated.

225
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,258
You bought me one drink.

226
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,191
So now I'm asking you
to have dinner with me.

227
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:03,137
I mean, such as it is.

228
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:07,634
I do love the fruit cup.

229
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:10,252
Not that this is exactly
the dinner I had in mind, but...

230
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:13,314
- Is that an invitation?
- Only if you promise to accept.

231
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:19,695
If I wasn't so taken
by the new Rodney McKay,

232
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:22,106
the parasite might've been
small enough to operate

233
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:24,632
without causing
significant brain trauma.

234
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:28,846
By the time he started
to forget, it was too late.

235
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:34,304
I haven't given up
on trying to find a treatment...

236
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:37,617
Ronon told me about this place
that could give Mer one more day

237
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:40,732
- as himself again before he dies.
- Jeannie, you can't possibly believe...

238
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:43,371
And that you're the one
who won't let him go.

239
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,678
It's on a planet called Talus, one
of the original worlds of the Ancestors.

240
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:51,242
It took us about five or six hours
to get there from the Gate,

241
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:54,764
but I was just a kid, and my grandfather
had to be carried most of the way.

242
00:14:54,884 --> 00:14:57,316
We could do it in about half that time.

243
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:59,749
There's a small problem
with that plan.

244
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,031
The Wraith established a Major outpost
there during the Replicator war.

245
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:05,956
It's still there.

246
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:08,827
That's never stopped us from going
anywhere we needed to go before.

247
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:11,497
Well, it's not just that.

248
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:14,166
- You don't believe it's real.
- I'm not saying...

249
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:15,334
I am, actually.

250
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:18,441
- I was there.
- Yes, but you were six years old.

251
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:21,777
Ronon, listen to what you've told us...

252
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:25,111
A magical Shrine,
inside a cave, behind a waterfall...

253
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:27,613
- Did I say it was magic?
- No, but you did say

254
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:30,349
that people afflicted
with McKay's condition

255
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:33,453
suddenly revert
to their former selves for...

256
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:36,430
The Shrine of Talus
is also known among my people,

257
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,817
for victims of the second childhood.

258
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:42,695
It offers the gift of one last day,
and a quick death.

259
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:46,296
- That doesn't necessarily make it real.
- I'm telling you in a matter of seconds

260
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:50,036
I saw my grandfather go from someone
who couldn't speak his own name,

261
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:52,517
to the man that taught me
how to track and hunt.

262
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:55,328
You learned to hunt
when you were six years old?

263
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:03,832
For one day,
he got to hold his wife in his arms,

264
00:16:03,952 --> 00:16:06,013
and share a meal
with the people that he loved,

265
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,951
and then he died with honor.

266
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:09,972
You can say
I was too young to remember,

267
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:12,975
but I know what I saw, and we can do
the same thing for McKay.

268
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:19,117
If you think that's not worth it,

269
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:21,195
you're wrong.

270
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,688
I've never told anyone this,
outside of...

271
00:16:32,714 --> 00:16:35,268
My father had a disease
called Alzheimer's.

272
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:37,411
It's similar in many respects

273
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,710
to the condition
that Dr. McKay is suffering from.

274
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:41,264
My point is,

275
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:44,805
I had a similar moment with him
to the one you've just described.

276
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:49,001
He hadn't recognized me,
literally, for months,

277
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:52,057
and then one day,
out of the blue,

278
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:55,392
he had a moment of absolute clarity.

279
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:59,104
He said
"Richard, what are you doing here?"

280
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,905
And I said, "Dad, I...

281
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,298
I'm here to see you," and he said...

282
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,617
He said, "Isn't that wonderful",

283
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:15,371
and then he was gone again.

284
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:20,084
- Couldn't you be remembering a simil...
- It's not the same.

285
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:22,503
- Ronon, look...
- I owe him this!

286
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:26,182
- I'll take him.
- I'll go with him.

287
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:27,531
Hold on, hold on.

288
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:31,658
We know for a fact
there are two hive ships

289
00:17:31,778 --> 00:17:33,276
and 10,000 Wraith on the ground.

290
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:35,690
If we're even going to consider this,

291
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,976
all right, we have to make a plan.

292
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,769
- Fine, make your plan.
- I'm sorry,

293
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:43,315
but he's not going anywhere
without my permission,

294
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:47,542
and you won't get that
until we talk to Rodney.

295
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:02,088
You got some visitors.
John's here.

296
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:05,126
So are Teyla and Ronon.
The whole team.

297
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,502
Ronon Dex.

298
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,352
That's right, buddy.

299
00:18:09,892 --> 00:18:12,810
I want to take you to a place,
a place that's going to give you

300
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,055
a chance to be yourself again
for a little while.

301
00:18:20,627 --> 00:18:22,312
As you were before you became ill.

302
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:26,028
Before...

303
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:32,107
Hey, pal.

304
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:33,781
Hey, John.

305
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,716
Truth is, we don't...

306
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:40,850
know exactly
what's gonna happen to you,

307
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,292
but we're willing to try,
if you are.

308
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:44,869
Okay.

309
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,489
Okay, okay, well,

310
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:50,543
- that settles it, then.
- No, it doesn't.

311
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,277
- They haven't told you everything.
- He doesn't need to know.

312
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:57,669
The planet they want to take you to
is a Wraith outpost.

313
00:18:57,789 --> 00:18:59,266
You remember who the Wraith are?

314
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,145
It means going will be very,
very dangerous,

315
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:06,148
not just for you,
but for your friends.

316
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:09,308
- We're willing to take that risk.
- A risk for which,

317
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:13,742
and I'm sorry, even if it works,
which I very much doubt...

318
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:18,869
you might revert to your former self
for one day.

319
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:22,623
Now, forgive me if that sounds
more like torture than a blessing.

320
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:26,583
We're still coming up with new ideas
on how to treat this thing,

321
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,630
but if you do this,
if you leave Atlantis...

322
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:31,791
Atlantis...

323
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:33,913
It's over.

324
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,008
I can't help you.

325
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:44,647
Doctor...

326
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,481
He doesn't understand.

327
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:52,833
No, he doesn't,

328
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:57,830
which means the decision
on whether or not to let him go is mine,

329
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,945
and I haven't given up
on trying to cure my patient.

330
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,589
And you still haven't given up.

331
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,610
No, because I don't think the damage
to the cells is permanent, which means

332
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,890
- if I can safely remove the parasite...
- How long have you been at it?

333
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,233
Weeks?

334
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:26,602
And how many days does he have left?
Two at most?

335
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,280
Look, I know you've done
everything you can.

336
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,913
I know you feel responsible,
and you want to keep trying, but...

337
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:37,781
I'm his next of kin.
That makes the decision mine.

338
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:41,486
And we're taking him.

339
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:47,143
<i>It's recording.</i>

340
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:49,660
<i>Aren't you supposed to say "Action"?</i>

341
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,644
<i>Sorry.</i>

342
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:52,281
<i>I'm kidding.</i>

343
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:54,165
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

344
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:57,422
<i>My name is Dr. Rodney McKay.</i>

345
00:20:57,775 --> 00:21:01,100
<i>I am head of the science
and research departments</i>

346
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,516
<i>here in Atlantis,
in the Pegasus galaxy,</i>

347
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:07,064
<i>in the local cluster,
in the universe as we know it.</i>

348
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,727
<i>The purpose of this log
is to provide a baseline</i>

349
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:14,088
<i>for myself, and for Dr. Keller,</i>

350
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,710
<i>to monitor the progress of my...</i>

351
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:22,036
<i>memory loss.</i>

352
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,858
<i>Ironic, isn't it?</i>

353
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,701
<i>By reciting the aforementioned,</i>

354
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,654
<i>as well as a list of things
I know like the back of my hand,</i>

355
00:21:30,774 --> 00:21:34,352
<i>starting with pi,
to, say, 12 decimals.</i>

356
00:21:34,786 --> 00:21:37,883
<i>3.1415926535...</i>

357
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,501
- Rodney on board?
- Yes.

358
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,334
Are we clear on the rules?

359
00:21:43,454 --> 00:21:46,375
We'll get in and get out
before the Wraith even know it.

360
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:50,492
If in fact
Dr. McKay does regain his...

361
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:54,078
Say goodbye for me.

362
00:22:01,912 --> 00:22:04,868
- I thought you didn't believe.
- Is that a prerequisite?

363
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:10,818
He'll be glad you're here.

364
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:15,771
We're either going to get away
with this, or we're not.

365
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:17,756
If we don't,
the ride's gonna be wild,

366
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:20,826
and it's is gonna be fast,
so I need everyone prepared.

367
00:22:20,946 --> 00:22:22,803
Jumper three, standing by.

368
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,388
Send the MALP through.

369
00:22:37,078 --> 00:22:39,332
The malp is clear of the Gate,
and they're firing on it

370
00:22:39,452 --> 00:22:42,406
from both sides
of what appears to be a deep valley.

371
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,468
It's deploying smoke.

372
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,704
You should have complete coverage
of the area in five seconds.

373
00:22:49,078 --> 00:22:50,539
Okay, see you tomorrow.

374
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:51,983
I hope so.

375
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:13,258
That's one hell of a valley.

376
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:15,455
Do you think they detected us
before we cloaked?

377
00:23:15,575 --> 00:23:17,550
No, I think the smokescreen worked.

378
00:23:17,827 --> 00:23:20,958
Hopefully they think we just sent
a MALP through ahead of us

379
00:23:21,078 --> 00:23:23,519
and changed our mind
when they blew it up.

380
00:23:27,452 --> 00:23:31,630
I'll do a sweep of the landing area.
Shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

381
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:53,018
- You were there, and then he...
- I'm right here. What's wrong?

382
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,160
I woke up, everyone had left!

383
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:57,312
Buddy, I...

384
00:23:57,432 --> 00:23:58,555
I'm sorry,

385
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:01,644
I thought you'd fallen asleep.

386
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:02,764
I was...

387
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:05,344
I got so scared, I was sure that...

388
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:08,269
by the morning what was left
of my mind was gonna be gone!

389
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:10,555
I'm gonna take you
back to your quarters, okay?

390
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:12,512
I've never been so scared.
I'm slipping away.

391
00:24:12,632 --> 00:24:14,736
I'm slipping away,
and I don't know how to stop myself!

392
00:24:14,856 --> 00:24:16,291
Look, you're still here.

393
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:19,002
All right?
You're still here.

394
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:23,144
Yeah. I am.

395
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,096
And I'm not going anywhere.

396
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:31,262
You know, you want to hang out,
you just...

397
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:32,638
hang out.

398
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:35,036
I don't know what to do.

399
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,227
I don't know what to do with myself.
I'm...

400
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:41,072
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
woken you up.

401
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:43,516
All right, look,
it's a nice night out.

402
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:46,671
Let's go have some beer
on the pier, okay?

403
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,885
- I drink beer?
- A lot.

404
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,273
Take this.

405
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:56,569
Come on, buddy, let's go.

406
00:25:05,553 --> 00:25:08,676
- I don't know, should I have another?
- What could happen?

407
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,558
I shouldn't have banged on your door
like that, I feel ridiculous.

408
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:15,926
Don't.

409
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,490
I've been trying to remember the name
of my sister's kid.

410
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:25,363
Betty.

411
00:25:26,113 --> 00:25:26,988
Betty...

412
00:25:29,546 --> 00:25:31,265
Pretty sure that's not it.

413
00:25:32,852 --> 00:25:34,437
It's Madison.
See?

414
00:25:34,557 --> 00:25:37,164
- At least you remember what it wasn't.
- There's an underrated skill.

415
00:25:37,324 --> 00:25:39,249
You may not be
as far gone as you think.

416
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:40,615
I'm hiding it.

417
00:25:41,348 --> 00:25:43,746
I've already forgotten more
than most people will ever know,

418
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:45,326
and I know that sounds...

419
00:25:47,058 --> 00:25:49,274
- Arrogant, is that right?
- Yeah.

420
00:25:50,254 --> 00:25:51,348
That works.

421
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:56,429
I was trying to help Zelenka finish
a device that was apparently my idea.

422
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:57,498
I was...

423
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:58,883
useless.

424
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:05,107
Jennifer says it's going to get worse
now almost by the hour.

425
00:26:06,128 --> 00:26:07,534
In a week or so,

426
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,112
I won't even remember my name.

427
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:14,773
How's about...

428
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:21,367
How about we say goodbye now?

429
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:22,425
No.

430
00:26:23,878 --> 00:26:24,701
What, no?

431
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:27,255
- I mean, I'm not saying goodbye.
- I'm saying it anyway.

432
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,594
- I'm not listening.
- But soon I won't know who you are.

433
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:32,288
- Then I'll remind you.
- I don't want you to see me like that.

434
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:34,928
Remember me as I am,
as your genius friend, not as some...

435
00:26:35,048 --> 00:26:36,117
Not happening.

436
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,365
- Please.
- You're stuck with me. Just accept it.

437
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:41,099
- Yeah, but...
- No!

438
00:26:42,596 --> 00:26:43,784
That's final.

439
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,588
You're a good friend, Arthur.

440
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:27,300
All right, landing area's clear.
I'm taking us in.

441
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:44,830
Where are we going?

442
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,306
Up there, do you see?

443
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:48,572
Behind the waterfall,
there is a cave,

444
00:27:48,692 --> 00:27:51,742
and when we get there, you will spend
a wonderful day with your friends.

445
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:52,955
I'm tired.

446
00:27:53,362 --> 00:27:55,176
I know.
We'll be there soon.

447
00:28:30,581 --> 00:28:32,196
So... What do we do?

448
00:28:33,017 --> 00:28:34,046
We wait.

449
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:38,386
Look at the waterfall.
It's cool, huh?

450
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:42,595
I'm getting
very faint energy readings.

451
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,978
- What kind of energy readings?
- I'm not sure.

452
00:28:47,162 --> 00:28:48,999
Look at this. Radiation?

453
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,366
Not that I've ever seen.

454
00:28:51,673 --> 00:28:53,928
Maybe we can ask
Rodney in a minute.

455
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:56,863
- Just hang in there, buddy.
- I wanna go home now!

456
00:28:57,023 --> 00:28:59,113
Perhaps he should stand
closer to this tablet.

457
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:01,034
I don't know.
I think that's the source

458
00:29:01,194 --> 00:29:03,398
- of these energy readings.
- I want to go now!

459
00:29:03,638 --> 00:29:05,937
- A little bit longer.
- Go now!

460
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,209
I'm here, Mer.

461
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:24,550
Yeah, obviously.

462
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:27,493
He's back.

463
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:32,680
Somebody please tell me
what the hell we're all doing here?

464
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,796
<i>I'm head of science and...</i>

465
00:29:44,543 --> 00:29:45,585
<i>research.</i>

466
00:29:46,812 --> 00:29:47,831
<i>Dammit!</i>

467
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:49,899
- <i>It's okay.</i>
- <i>No, it is not.</i>

468
00:29:53,268 --> 00:29:54,409
<i>Atlantis...</i>

469
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:57,588
<i>Pegasus...</i>

470
00:29:58,704 --> 00:30:01,238
<i>It's 3.1... 4...</i>

471
00:30:04,722 --> 00:30:05,891
<i>I don't know.</i>

472
00:30:08,946 --> 00:30:10,658
<i>How can I not know that?</i>

473
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,516
<i>Do you wanna stop?</i>

474
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,333
<i>I keep seeing a face.</i>

475
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:20,925
<i>Every time I close my eyes.</i>

476
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:25,909
<i>I think it's my mother.</i>

477
00:30:28,498 --> 00:30:30,058
<i>I don't... I don't...</i>

478
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:32,954
<i>recognize her...</i>

479
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:35,223
<i>It's so long ago.</i>

480
00:30:38,982 --> 00:30:41,084
<i>She's saying words to me...</i>

481
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,583
<i>I don't know them.</i>

482
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:54,689
Well, you can start with,
what is this place?

483
00:30:55,216 --> 00:30:57,966
- It's the Shrine of Talus.
- That means nothing to me.

484
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:00,109
It's a planet of the Ancestors.
We brought you.

485
00:31:00,229 --> 00:31:01,615
Thank you, Mr. Information.

486
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,824
Since when is he Ronon the explainer,
and why am I not in the infirmary?

487
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:06,495
What am I, better?

488
00:31:07,191 --> 00:31:08,411
I am better!

489
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:09,829
No, you're not.

490
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:11,944
I am. I can feel it.
This is amazing!

491
00:31:12,064 --> 00:31:15,585
Mer, we brought you here
so we could say goodbye to each other,

492
00:31:16,853 --> 00:31:18,462
but you'll feel like this for a day.


493
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:20,757
- That's just how it works.
- What?

494
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:24,719
What do you remember?

495
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:28,515
You didn't want me to say goodbye then.
Why now all of a sudden?

496
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:30,629
And why one day?
What's with that?

497
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:32,223
It is a gift of the Shrine,

498
00:31:32,343 --> 00:31:35,261
and from all of us who risked
great danger to bring you here,

499
00:31:35,381 --> 00:31:37,273
one last chance
to be with those you love.

500
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:39,094
And then what?

501
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:43,571
I die?

502
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,691
With honor.

503
00:31:44,811 --> 00:31:47,158
- And dignity.
- Screw that, I'll just stay here.

504
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:49,437
- Doesn't work that way.
- Why not?

505
00:31:49,557 --> 00:31:51,829
One, this is a Wraith-controlled planet.

506
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,744
And we're detecting ionizing radiation.

507
00:31:54,961 --> 00:31:57,627
- We shouldn't be standing close to...
- You've gotta be kidding me.

508
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:01,913
- How could you let them do this?
- Don't blame her. She didn't wanna.

509
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:04,133
Then whose brilliant idea was it?

510
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:06,719
- Mine.
- We all thought it was a good thing...

511
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,930
How could this possibly be a good thing?

512
00:32:09,736 --> 00:32:12,433
Look, I'd got past the humiliation,
I've said my goodbyes.

513
00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:15,812
Merdith, I'm sorry this happened to you,
but I'm not that I got this chance.

514
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,940
Please, just...
try to see this as an opportunity

515
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,972
- and not...
- Not torture?

516
00:32:26,907 --> 00:32:28,722
Look, I'm sorry, I just...

517
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:33,442
I thought I was going to be okay,
and then now you tell me...

518
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:39,546
Did you have
some kind of itinerary planned?

519
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,255
Well, actually,
we're going to have a big feast first.

520
00:32:42,706 --> 00:32:44,126
Last supper, huh?

521
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:47,010
Suits your messiah complex.

522
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:49,346
True.

523
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:52,918
Please don't be mad at me.

524
00:32:54,702 --> 00:32:59,101
I guess if I had to choose the people
I would spend my last day with, then...

525
00:33:03,012 --> 00:33:04,094
What is it?

526
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:07,383
Honestly,

527
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:09,125
I didn't expect it to work.

528
00:33:09,245 --> 00:33:12,689
I expected nothing would happen,
and that would be that.

529
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:14,454
So why did it?

530
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,943
You don't believe in magic shrines
any more than I do.

531
00:33:20,347 --> 00:33:21,990
Show him the readings.

532
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:31,179
- That's what I said.
- You said "hmm"?

533
00:33:31,805 --> 00:33:34,121
I just meant that
I thought it was weird, too.

534
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:36,543
- What do you think, antimatter?
- Or a superheavy element

535
00:33:36,663 --> 00:33:38,604
the Ancients used to use
as an energy source.

536
00:33:38,724 --> 00:33:41,720
- I've never seen it before...
- Or created to power this place.

537
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,509
Who could tell what that is?
Must be thousands of years...

538
00:33:45,678 --> 00:33:47,164
- See that spike?
- Come on.

539
00:33:47,284 --> 00:33:49,113
- Let's have some fun.
- For me, this is fun.

540
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:50,676
Just... Save me some ham.

541
00:33:51,222 --> 00:33:54,054
There it goes again.
It's some kind of gamma that's...

542
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:56,123
- Come with me.
- What? Why?

543
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,517
- I need to find out something.
- Where are we going?

544
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,793
Hopefully all the way back to Atlantis.

545
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:07,814
Sorry...

546
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:09,693
Why did you do that?

547
00:34:10,278 --> 00:34:13,860
To determine whether the parasite
would expand rapidly back into his brain

548
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,705
when we took him from
the radiation source, I think it did.

549
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:20,603
The reason why his symptoms disappeared
when we came here was because

550
00:34:20,763 --> 00:34:22,669
it contracted to protect itself.

551
00:34:23,756 --> 00:34:25,287
What does that mean for us?

552
00:34:25,593 --> 00:34:27,985
That leaving this chamber
will probably kill him.

553
00:34:28,712 --> 00:34:30,780
We can't take him back to Atlantis.

554
00:34:31,427 --> 00:34:32,360
So...

555
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:37,014
We're gonna have to find a way
for me to operate on him right here.

556
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,992
I thought you already tried radiation.

557
00:34:54,112 --> 00:34:57,114
I did, but we'd never come across
this kind before.

558
00:34:57,234 --> 00:35:00,691
The parasite is radiosensitive to it.
That's why the Shrine works.

559
00:35:00,925 --> 00:35:02,667
You feel fine for one day

560
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:05,644
until the radiation makes you feel sick,
then you leave.

561
00:35:05,764 --> 00:35:08,727
Farther away you get, more rapidly
the parasite expands into the brain.

562
00:35:08,847 --> 00:35:10,837
And your day is over. I get it.

563
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:13,741
So, if we're here,
it's small enough to operate?

564
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:17,851
I guess, but it's the only thing
that would explain his sudden remission,

565
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,246
but I'm not gonna know
for certain until I get in there.

566
00:35:20,522 --> 00:35:22,931
- How are you gonna do with a field kit?
- I don't.

567
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:25,858
- We would need equipment from Atlantis.
- That's a problem.

568
00:35:26,944 --> 00:35:30,151
What if we radio Atlantis,
ask a Jumper with what I need?

569
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:33,187
- No, we can't.
- I need that equipment, John.

570
00:35:33,535 --> 00:35:35,989
The Wraith are never gonna fall
for the same trick twice.

571
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:38,477
Even if somehow they don't
pick up on our radio signal,

572
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,850
and even if the second Jumper
makes it through the gauntlet,

573
00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:43,316
they'll know we're here.
We'll never make it to Atlantis.

574
00:35:43,436 --> 00:35:44,898
If we don't try, he's dead.

575
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:51,552
- What do you need?
- To operate? I already told you.

576
00:35:52,749 --> 00:35:54,573
Bare minimum, what do you need?

577
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,830
More than I have
in my medical kit.

578
00:35:58,206 --> 00:36:00,782
I mean, I need a scanner to find out
the location of the parasite,

579
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:03,928
I need the proper tools
to cut his skull open...

580
00:36:04,048 --> 00:36:05,009
All right.

581
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,866
I've got an idea.

582
00:36:07,986 --> 00:36:10,463
Keep him as far away
from this thing as he can stand.

583
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,621
We'll be back in 20 minutes.

584
00:36:44,107 --> 00:36:46,333
You can't expect me
to operate with those.

585
00:36:46,453 --> 00:36:49,989
Well, I've seen surgical drills.
They're not that much different.

586
00:36:50,184 --> 00:36:51,659
Fine, assuming we can open him up,

587
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:55,529
I still have no way of knowing
where the parasite has contracted to.

588
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:02,129
We can use this.

589
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:04,484
- A lifesigns detector?
- Yeah. Why not?

590
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:08,229
Well, it's just not designed to do what
I need it to do on the correct scale.

591
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:10,583
We'll have Jeannie modify it.

592
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:12,837
No. You don't understand.

593
00:37:13,185 --> 00:37:16,095
The radiation is compromising
his immune system as we speak,

594
00:37:16,215 --> 00:37:17,807
which means if I don't kill him,

595
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:20,768
the infection he's bound to get
by being operated on in a damp cave

596
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:24,088
- almost certainly will!
- Look, if we don't do something,

597
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:25,865
he's dead.

598
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:27,487
You said it.

599
00:37:27,804 --> 00:37:28,791
Absolutely not!

600
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:30,742
We're talking about saving your life.

601
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:34,333
Look, my brain is not some new deck
off the back of your house.

602
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:37,985
- I'm not the one doing the surgery.
- Yes, and as my parting advice,

603
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:40,678
you need to stop letting these guys
talk you into doing stupid things.

604
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:42,047
I can do it.

605
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:43,729
Really?

606
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:46,207
And I'm fairly sure
I can modify the lifesigns detector.

607
00:37:46,327 --> 00:37:48,392
- Yeah, with my help...
- So help.

608
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:50,515
This isn't one of those brain surgeries

609
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,749
where my skull is open,
and we have a conversation...

610
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:55,327
I have anesthetic to put you out.
You're not going to feel a thing.

611
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:57,355
Yeah, it's probably a hammer.

612
00:37:58,134 --> 00:38:00,838
Time is of the essence, Rodney.
You need to make a decision.

613
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:02,932
Please, Mer. Let us try.

614
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:04,811
Obviously I'd get around to consenting.

615
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:07,540
It's just... You've thrown
an awful lot at me all at once.

616
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,740
That's life.

617
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,453
All right, let me have a little ham.

618
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,443
No food before surgery.

619
00:38:22,262 --> 00:38:24,030
<i>Sorry I'm mean sometimes.</i>

620
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:03,903
I'm gonna have to cut here...

621
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:06,988
Here...

622
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:09,235
And here,

623
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,087
and drill those points
to resect the area.

624
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,293
I don't wanna penetrate the dura layers
until we get there,

625
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:18,551
so hold him as still as you can.

626
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:21,863
Go.

627
00:39:58,423 --> 00:40:01,435
I took too long reconfiguring
the lifesigns detector.

628
00:40:01,555 --> 00:40:03,857
I haven't given her enough time
to perform the surgery

629
00:40:03,977 --> 00:40:06,343
before his immune system
is compromised.

630
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:12,428
- Dammit, I went too far. Hold him.
- I'm trying.

631
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,523
It's the parasite... It's moving.

632
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:20,335
Maybe it knows we're going after it.

633
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:23,663
I don't think so.
I think it instinctually wants

634
00:40:23,783 --> 00:40:25,760
to get away from the radiation source,

635
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,762
and we've just shown it the way out.

636
00:40:35,195 --> 00:40:37,855
Ronon, we're going to need
that gun of yours in about 10 seconds.

637
00:41:00,744 --> 00:41:02,652
You could have stepped on it.

638
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,423
She told me to shoot it.

639
00:41:05,604 --> 00:41:06,683
It's clear.

640
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:11,241
You did a good job.

641
00:41:11,975 --> 00:41:12,973
You too.

642
00:41:17,697 --> 00:41:19,200
Let's get him home.

643
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:35,916
Why don't you go get some sleep?
I'm gonna be here all night.

644
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,444
It's okay.
I'd like to be here when he wakes up.

645
00:41:38,862 --> 00:41:40,630
Well, it could be a while.

646
00:41:41,117 --> 00:41:43,087
He does love to sleep, our Rodney.

647
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,683
You should've seen him
when he was a teenager.

648
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,092
Who can sleep
with all the talking?

649
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:54,557
You still all there?

650
00:41:57,814 --> 00:41:59,520
There was so much to spare.

651
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:05,943
Thank you.

652
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:08,529
You're welcome.

653
00:42:09,296 --> 00:42:10,447
That was scary.

654
00:42:11,606 --> 00:42:12,719
For me too.

655
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:17,621
Are you hungry?

656
00:42:19,944 --> 00:42:21,167
Peckish.

657
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:24,148
I'll go order you something.

658
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:34,283
<i>There's something I wanted to...</i>

659
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:38,534
<i>While I remember, while I still can,</i>

660
00:42:38,654 --> 00:42:40,798
<i>there's something
I wanted to say before...</i>

661
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:42,312
<i>Go ahead.</i>

662
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,189
<i>I love you.</i>

663
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:52,228
<i>Loved you
for some time now.</i>

664
00:42:59,134 --> 00:43:00,331
<i>Where was I...</i>
