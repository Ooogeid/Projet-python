1
00:00:00,087 --> 00:00:01,811
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:01,897 --> 00:00:04,069
<i>No matter were we try to hide
on this planet,</i>

3
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:06,696
the Replicator satellite
will be able to track us.

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:08,531
<i>Atlantis is leaving.</i>

5
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:11,726
- We're not flying high enough.
- We don't have enough power.

6
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:16,572
<i>We are lost.</i>

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,832
We dropped out of hyperspace way
too soon. I have no idea where we are.

8
00:00:19,912 --> 00:00:22,009
She's unresponsive
and her pupils are sluggish.

9
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:24,480
Prep the OR and have the scanner
ready when we get there.

10
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:27,083
Several conduits were affected
by the brush with the beam.

11
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:29,232
She's suffering from cerebral oedema,

12
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:31,741
which may have caused
substantial brain damage.

13
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:33,598
- What is that?
- An asteroid belt?

14
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:36,996
<i>We're gonna clear a path through
the belt by firing our drones.</i>

15
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:39,982
Elizabeth's crashing. If we
do this thing, we need to do it now.

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,105
What did you do?

17
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:42,899
- I reactivated the nanites.
- Dammit!

18
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,007
<i>But I'm certain they're not gonna try</i>
<i>to take her over or contact the others!</i>

19
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,653
This is a very bad idea.

20
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:49,598
There's a planet out there with ZPMs?

21
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,583
<i>That would be the Replicator homeworld.</i>

22
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:53,860
You feel up to a heist?

23
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:11,199
OK, when I say,
go ahead and try the left one.

24
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,502
Geez!
I said, "when I say!"

25
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:15,841
I thought you did say!

26
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:17,288
How's it going, boys?

27
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:19,191
We'd be making a lot more progress

28
00:01:19,273 --> 00:01:21,901
if Timmy Torture over here wasn't
trying to kill me every 2 sec.

29
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,814
I'm not trying to kill him.

30
00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:27,581
So, can you make it
jump into hyperspace or not?

31
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:28,804
Yes, I think so.

32
00:01:28,884 --> 00:01:30,488
<i>- You think so?</i>
- Yes, think.

33
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,198
You said you could do it.

34
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,575
Correction I said "probably" do it.

35
00:01:34,935 --> 00:01:38,362
Yes, he has trouble with an algorithm
he created during his near-ascension.

36
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:41,666
This is unbelievably complex
physics here, alright?

37
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:44,908
I mean, it makes string theory look
like non-linear dynamics.

38
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:47,427
Even if I do get it working,

39
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,292
there's still a thousand things
that could go terribly, terribly wrong.

40
00:01:50,373 --> 00:01:53,649
I get it, it's difficult.
Million-to-one odds...

41
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:57,262
Was there something else you needed,
or were you here to prod and belittle?

42
00:01:57,342 --> 00:01:58,345
No, not.

43
00:01:58,923 --> 00:02:00,051
Not merely.

44
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:02,600
There's another problem
we need to be thinking about.

45
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:05,147
Such as, what do we do
when we get there?

46
00:02:06,054 --> 00:02:08,312
<i>Getting this thing to jump
into hyperspace may be easy.</i>

47
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,691
Infiltrating the city, stealing the ZPM,

48
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:12,856
and getting out,
I think that's a little dicey.

49
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:13,944
<i>To say the least.</i>

50
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:15,679
<i>- I've been thinking about that.</i>
- And?

51
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,643
And I think that if we stand
any chance of succeeding,

52
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:20,214
we're gonna need some help.

53
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,560
From who?

54
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,841
Feel like taking a trip?

59
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,314
The nanites inside you,

60
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,148
I think, if we got them
in close proximity

61
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,768
to the human-form Replicator's city,

62
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:49,940
I'd be able to manipulate them
to remotely hack

63
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:51,553
into the Replicator mainframe.

64
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:55,080
We'd be able to find out the closest ZPM
and the quickest way to get in and out.

65
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:57,642
Not only that, we'd be able to track
their movement as well.

66
00:03:57,724 --> 00:03:59,635
We'll know they're coming
before they spot us.

67
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:01,596
Which does not eliminate the danger.

68
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,910
<i>Far from it.</i>

69
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,733
<i>But it does give us a significant edge.</i>

70
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:08,060
What happens if the Replicators take
control of the nanites inside me?

71
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,350
- They won't. I'd block any attempt...
<i>- But if they do?</i>

72
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,919
I ordered Rodney to write a kill switch
into the nanites' code.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,869
If we trigger the program,
it'll neutralize them.

74
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:20,448
Neutralize them,
you mean shut them off?

75
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,964
Yes.

76
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:24,844
And you said the nanites are
all that are keeping me alive.

77
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:26,664
<i>They are.</i>

78
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,246
If we shut them off, it will...

79
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:31,125
kill you.

80
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:35,712
But that's not gonna happen.

81
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:36,853
Alright?

82
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,621
I've ordered Rodney to keep an eye
on the bastards, make sure they behave.

83
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:43,359
<i>We would not ask this
of you if it was not</i>

84
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,639
the only chance of
this mission succeeding.

85
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:49,932
She's right, if we don't get hold
of a ZPM, the City and everyone in...

86
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:51,318
When do we leave?

87
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:54,638
Right now.

88
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:55,783
<i>What? Wait,</i>

89
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:58,978
No... not right now. Look, I haven't
finished finalizing the power distrib...

90
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,922
Finalize it. We need to move.

91
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:12,776
You're gonna be OK, Elizabeth.

92
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:14,431
Still,

93
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:17,644
I would like all of you
to keep a very close eye on me,

94
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:19,832
and the first sign
of any suspicious behavior,

95
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:22,009
do not hesitate
with that kill switch.

96
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,765
- OK, but that's not gonna happen...
<i>- John, I mean it.</i>

97
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:34,451
<i>Hey, Teyla!</i>

98
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:36,084
Wait up.

99
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:41,224
I'm gonna need you
to sit this one out.

100
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:43,222
John, if this mission is not successful

101
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,036
Zelenka thinks he found a planet

102
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:46,735
that can sustain human life.

103
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,963
He's fairly confident that he can get
the City there in one jump.

104
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:52,086
Without the shields,
we will be unable to land.

105
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:55,845
I know. We won't even have enough
power to establish orbit.

106
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,023
You're gonna have to do a fly-by,
and get everybody else in the Jumper.

107
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:02,578
- You mean abandon the City.
- Well, if it comes to that.

108
00:06:03,753 --> 00:06:05,622
Alright, these people
are gonna need a leader.

109
00:06:05,716 --> 00:06:08,763
Somebody who can keep them alive, keep
them together, more importantly, not

110
00:06:08,857 --> 00:06:10,193
let them give up hope.

111
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,550
That's you, Teyla.

112
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:14,853
Look, if I'm not back twelve hours,

113
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:16,692
give the order.

114
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:27,397
Alright.

115
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:29,027
Now.

116
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:31,436
- Are you certain?
- Yes.

117
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,249
I only ask 'cause the last time you were
less than definitive in your answer...

118
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:37,838
Alright.

119
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,449
- OK.
- Yes?

120
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:48,030
- I think we got it.
- Good, good, now...

121
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:50,430
now, as long as we don't
burn up all of the power

122
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,933
on the initial jump, then...

123
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:54,210
Yes, yes, right, OK.

124
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:55,842
I'll leave now.

125
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:03,738
- You ready?
- Yes. I'm not sure if it's gonna work,

126
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,479
I've done everything
I can to make it.

127
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,025
Sheppard, we're ready.

128
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,881
<i>Alright Teyla, we're ready to launch.</i>

129
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,009
Understood.

130
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:31,053
Open the Jumper bay doors.

131
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:34,623
Remember, no wild parties
while we're gone.

132
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:36,958
<i>We will try to restrain ourselves.</i>

133
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:39,365
Good luck.

134
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:41,641
<i>Alright, here we go.</i>

135
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,054
Rodney, you ready?

136
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,783
Did I mention that this might not work?
And that we could either drop out of

137
00:07:55,863 --> 00:07:58,899
hyperspace prematurely and end up
stranded in the middle of deep space,

138
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:01,321
<i>or quite possibly, be vaporized
the moment I touch that.</i>

139
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:02,947
Just answer the damn question.

140
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,467
Yeah, I'm ready.

141
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:06,765
Good, sit down.

142
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:12,928
Here goes.

143
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:17,299
OK, opening
hyperspace window in three,

144
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:18,884
two,

145
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:20,259
one...

146
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,029
Oh my! that's... beautiful.

147
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:34,355
Yeah, it is.

148
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,542
It's like Elwynn Forest.

149
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:38,933
Oh, nothing, it's

150
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:40,846
one of the lands in Warcraft.

151
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:42,978
That's a game I play.

152
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:46,067
Well, occasionally.

153
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:49,573


154
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:52,170
You gonna be OK?

155
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:55,177
Yeah, I just... you know,
I don't get to get offworld much,

156
00:08:55,257 --> 00:08:56,721
or ever, hardly.

157
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:59,109
You'd better take a picture
we're not gonna be here long.

158
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:00,571
Right, good idea.

159
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:02,877
This is Colonel Carter
calling the Apollo.

160
00:09:02,957 --> 00:09:04,469
Colonel Ellis, do you read?

161
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:05,999
<i>Five by five, Colonel.</i>

162
00:09:06,382 --> 00:09:09,142
We've stepped through the Gate
and are ready for transport.

163
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:11,381
- No, wait...
<i>- Stand-by.</i>

164
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:21,722
Welcome to the Pegasus galaxy, Colonel.

165
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:25,167
Thank you.
Still no word from Atlantis?

166
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:26,701
Nothing.

167
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:28,856
<i>I've been going over the specs</i>

168
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,858
for these modifications you're proposing
for the sensor array.

169
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:35,722
You're asking for a five-fold increase
in power consumption?

170
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:39,227
Plus, you want to cannibalize parts
from half a dozen other key

171
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:41,816
<i>systems, including
subspace communications.</i>

172
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,242
That's correct.

173
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,033
What if they try and contact us?

174
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:47,955
If they could, they would have done it.

175
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,793
All of this is based on the assumption

176
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:51,878
that they dropped out
of hyperspace early.

177
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:55,068
Yeah, we believe
that's the most likely scenario.

178
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:58,017
Alright, let's do it.

179
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,725
<i>Congratulations, Rodney.</i>

180
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:15,248
Your hyperdrive worked.

181
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:17,271
Unfortunately, believe it or not,

182
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:19,117
Zelenka was actually right.

183
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:21,236
We burned up way more power on the jump

184
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:22,534
<i>than we expected.</i>

185
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:24,646
What are you saying?
We can't get back?

186
00:10:24,726 --> 00:10:27,012
No, what I am saying is that the...

187
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:30,229
Actually,
that's exactly what I'm saying.

188
00:10:30,524 --> 00:10:32,882
I suppose, once we steal the ZPM,
I could utilise its power.

189
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,493
- Need to make sure I don't overload...
- Let's take this one step at a time!

190
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:37,795
First things first.

191
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,783
Let's worry about getting the ZPM.

192
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:41,288
Right.

193
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:46,139
- I'm gonna try to initialize the link.
- What do you want me to do?

194
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:48,421
Nothing. Just sit there.
It's completely wireless.

195
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:50,719
Let me know if anything
pops into your mind.

196
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:52,254
What do you mean?

197
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:54,201
Will I just sort of sense something,

198
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:55,591
or is it more of a...

199
00:10:57,645 --> 00:10:58,645
Oh, my God.

200
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,059
<i>I did it.</i>

201
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:04,897
I mean, she did it.

202
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:09,945
<i>But we have to move fast. Even though
her nanites are in lurking mode,</i>

203
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:13,199
won't take long for them to figure out
another player has joined the game.

204
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,928
How you feeling, Elizabeth?

205
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,193
Very strange.

206
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:19,970
<i>I can suddenly see the entire city
directly in front of me.</i>

207
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,669
Every corridor, every single room...

208
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:28,913
That way.

209
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:30,267
The ZPM.

210
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:35,619
Fourth quadrant, top level, easy access.
There's hardly anyone around.

211
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:38,229
Alright, works for me.

212
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:55,071
Alright, we're down.
Rodney, stay here with Elizabeth,

213
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:58,169
keep sifting through the intel.
You guys can guide us through by radio.

214
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,291
<i>Twenty meters to the left
behind the jumper,</i>

215
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:03,698
<i>there's an access door.</i>

216
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:05,075
Down one flight of stairs,

217
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:06,903
you'll enter auxiliary corridor seven.

218
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:10,211
Go now, it's clear.

219
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:28,690
We're at the corridor.

220
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:29,941
<i>Go right.</i>

221
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:31,194
<i>At 6.5 meters,</i>

222
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:33,754
<i>- there should be another corridor.</i>
- OK, we see it.

223
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,398
<i>Turn left. Wait! Go back!</i>

224
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,700
It's alright, he didn't see you.

225
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,463
Really? You know that?

226
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:46,566
Yeah. Like I said, it's very strange.

227
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:49,519
Can we go now?

228
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,124
<i>Yes, go.</i>

229
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,355
<i>Turn left, then right.</i>

230
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:08,502
It should be directly in front of you.

231
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:09,931
<i>Yeah, I see it.</i>

232
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,579
Hold up, Chewie.

233
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:19,047
Aren't they gonna notice
when we pull the plug on this thing?

234
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:20,878
<i>Probably,
but they've got dozens of ZPMs.</i>

235
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,743
Let's just hope that they don't notice
until we're long gone.

236
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,431
<i>That's wishful thinking.</i>

237
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,822
<i>We still in the clear?</i>

238
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:30,140
There's a small group of Replicators
two corridors over, heading your way,

239
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,829
<i>so you need to move quickly.</i>

240
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:40,098
Got it.

241
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:42,076
We're on our way.

242
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,696
Hook up the ZPM, we're leaving.

243
00:13:56,776 --> 00:13:59,191
- Wait a minute. We can't go.
- What are you talking about?

244
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,323
You said you could get
the hyperdrive back online.

245
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:04,224
I mean, we can, but not yet. Look,
while Elizabeth's been connected,

246
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:07,642
I've been going over the Replicator's
base code, and I found this.

247
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:10,577
What is that?

248
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:13,389
The Holy Grail.

249
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:15,341
It's their whole reason for being.

250
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:18,248
It's a command code
that directs them to attack the Wraith.

251
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:19,957
But they don't attack the Wraith.

252
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:23,003
They've been sitting on their nanite
asses for 10,000 years.

253
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,671
That's because it's been deactivated.

254
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:26,642
- And how did that happen?
- I've no idea.

255
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:29,495
Maybe the Ancients did it when
they realised they'd lost control.

256
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:31,452
You're just noticing this now, huh?

257
00:14:31,873 --> 00:14:35,265
<i>This is just one in millions
of commands in the base code.</i>

258
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:38,112
Look, I always had a hunch that
something like this might be in there,

259
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:40,014
but believe me, it was not easy to find.

260
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:41,418
Can you reactivate it?

261
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,964
Yes, but there's a problem.

262
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:45,986
Look, I can reprogram
the nanites in your brain

263
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:47,921
and use that link
to upload the changes, but

264
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:51,299
we'll need to wait for the next merge to
affect all the Replicators at once, and

265
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,595
we have no idea when that could be.
Not only that, but

266
00:14:53,715 --> 00:14:55,697
the instant it happens,
they'll know you're there.

267
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:57,662
<i>They'll take immediate
steps to assimilate you.</i>

268
00:14:57,742 --> 00:14:59,313
Then we're not doing it.

269
00:14:59,757 --> 00:15:02,109
John...
You know what this could mean.

270
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,503
If the Replicators go to war
with the Wraith?

271
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,213
Forget about it. It's not happening.

272
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:08,617
- That's not your call.
- The hell it isn't!

273
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:11,547
Hang on. There may be another way.

274
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:13,376
There's a central data core.

275
00:15:14,552 --> 00:15:18,591
It's kind of like a back-up
hard-drive for all the Replicators.

276
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:21,721
<i>If I can upload the reactivated
attack command directly into that,</i>

277
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:24,701
we wouldn't need to use Elizabeth.
We could be half way back to Atlantis

278
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:26,942
when the attack command
takes effect at the next merge.

279
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:28,860
That sounds a little more like it.

280
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:31,578
There's one small problem,

281
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:34,263
which is not actually a small problem.

282
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:37,550
The core is at the center of the city,
several levels down.

283
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,890
It would be impossible
to get there undetected.

284
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:41,145
Great.

285
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:44,341
We're gonna have to come back
after we take the ZPM back to Atlantis

286
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,832
and after we land the City.

287
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:47,644
<i>I don't think we'll have another chance.</i>

288
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,762
<i>He's right.</i>

289
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,809
Once they notice the ZPM is missing,

290
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:53,588
they'll be able to trace
the source of the infiltration.

291
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:56,429
I will never get this kind
of undetected access again.

292
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:59,098
If we're gonna do this,
it's now or never.

293
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:05,790
You're gonna turn the cloak
in an anti-Replicator field?

294
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,875
Yes, by interfacing
the A.R.G's control crystal

295
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:09,702
with the Jumper's cloaking generator.

296
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:12,468
The only question is how far
I can widen the field.

297
00:16:12,658 --> 00:16:16,329
Look, go ahead and fly us as close
to the center of the city as possible.

298
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,378
There.

299
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,094
<i>- But won't we be visible?</i>
- Yes, we will.

300
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:22,228
The anti-Replicator field
will protect us.

301
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:24,764
That is, assuming that I can
extend the field wide enough

302
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:27,603
to encompass not only the Jumper,
but also the core room, and

303
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:30,593
also assuming we can run fast enough
to get there, input the command, and

304
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:34,618
get back before the Replicators figure
out how to override the field, and...

305
00:16:34,698 --> 00:16:36,177
You know, slaughter us.

306
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:38,804
Don't worry about it.
You're not coming with us.

307
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,806
<i>- Neither is Elizabeth.</i>
- I'm sorry, what?

308
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:44,000
You guys can guide us through
by radio like you did last time.

309
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:48,029
Wait a minute. If I'm not there, how are
we supposed to input the command?

310
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:51,372
Put it on a tablet. I'll plug it
into the core and upload it myself.

311
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:53,725
Oh, plug and play, huh?
What, you think it's that simple?

312
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:56,322
Well, it will be, because
you're gonna make it that simple.

313
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:58,157
- Yeah...
<i>- I need you</i>

314
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:00,117
to stay here, Rodney.

315
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:01,494
- Why?
- Rodney!

316
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:03,037
To keep an eye on me.

317
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:05,921
You may need to activate
the kill switch on the nanites.

318
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:09,414
You'll be able to keep a closer eye on
me if we both stay here in the Jumper.

319
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:14,992
Alright.

320
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:17,217
Get out of that.

321
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,093
- The core is beneath that platform.
- How far beneath?

322
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,266
Nine levels.

323
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:28,187
Piece of cake.

324
00:17:45,158 --> 00:17:47,331
- Anything?
- No.

325
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:50,692
<i>Eleven jumps.</i>

326
00:17:51,643 --> 00:17:54,308
I'm sorry. Even with the scanners' range
significantly increased,

327
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,173
we've only covered a small area so far.

328
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:00,658
<i>We still have 39 more jumps before
we reach the original Lantian planet.</i>

329
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:01,636
Thirty nine?

330
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:05,523
Space is quite vast.

331
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:08,639
You don't say.

332
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:13,101
Engage hyperdrive.

333
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:15,881
<i>Stop number twelve.</i>

334
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:33,526
- We're visible.
- Engaging anti-Replicator field now.

335
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,641
It's working.

336
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,301
OK, let's jack it up,
see how far we can penetrate.

337
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:51,139
Penetrate?

338
00:18:51,643 --> 00:18:52,643
What?

339
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,303
Alright, here we go.

340
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:10,409
- It's working.
- Damn right, it's working.

341
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,019
It's encompassed the core room.
You're good to go.

342
00:19:18,145 --> 00:19:20,367
What, you don't believe me,
but you believe her?

343
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:21,593
No offense.

344
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:23,578
Offense taken.

345
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:26,058
Straight down, nine levels.

346
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:29,207
Then a short run down a corridor
to the core room.

347
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,144
OK, I've written a basic
block-storage transport protocol

348
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:38,958
to upload the attack command
directly from this tablet into the core.

349
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:42,109
All you need to do is plug
this cable into the main circuit,

350
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:44,904
it'll automatically configure
and upload the command.

351
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,072
Plug it in.

352
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,396
- You wanted simple.
- I like simple.

353
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:51,704
Well, we created that adapter
to interface with Ancient tech,

354
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:55,592
which the Replicators love to imitate,
so you shouldn't have a problem there.

355
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:58,056
Now, you need to move fast,
because as soon as they find out

356
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,671
what we're up to, they're going
to figure out a way around it.

357
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,600
Just do what you did last time.

358
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,717
We'll be back before you know it.

359
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:06,395
<i>Let's go.</i>

360
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,460
What is it?

361
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:30,681
An anomalous energy reading in the 2nd
quadrant of the communications tower.

362
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:32,726
- Source?
- Undetermined as of yet.

363
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:36,104
It's creating a disruptive field,
emanating downwards from the top level,

364
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:38,793
<i>encompassing nine levels
directly below it.</i>

365
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:40,208
The core.

366
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:43,544
<i>OK, we're here. Left or right?</i>

367
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:44,923
Left.

368
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,478
Shield's working, Rodney.

369
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:01,764
- Good, make sure to stay behind it.
<i>- Thanks for the tip.</i>

370
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:03,692
Now turn right.

371
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,721
Alright, we're here.

372
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:27,382
I'm assuming the big
glowy thing is the core.

373
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:30,318
Indeed, it is. OK,
there should be an open slot

374
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:32,596
in the control panel
that you can plug the cable into.

375
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:35,267
Alright.

376
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:39,887
Here goes.

377
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:44,507
It's plugged in.

378
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:45,616
It is?

379
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:49,279
Why am I not reading anything? Are you
sure you plugged it into the right slot?

380
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,449
There's only one slot, Rodney.

381
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:56,466
Hurry, John, they're coming,
and there's hundreds of them.

382
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,748
- Won't the field protect us?
<i>- As long as you hurry.</i>

383
00:22:01,424 --> 00:22:03,835
OK, look, try plugging it in again.

384
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,214
Alright, it's plugged in again.

385
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:11,906
Still nothing. What did you do?

386
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:13,269
I didn't do anything.

387
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:22,353
They keep attacking the field.

388
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:25,273
<i>They're deliberately
sacrificing themselves.</i>

389
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,691
Why would they do that?

390
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:29,027
The more they attack the field,

391
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:31,696
the quicker they can figure out
how to override it.

392
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:33,727
Then we need to get the hell ot of here.

393
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:35,368
Rodney, why is this not working?

394
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:38,457
<i>It's not working because
the core is not recognizing the tablet.</i>

395
00:22:38,577 --> 00:22:39,684
Why not?

396
00:22:39,804 --> 00:22:41,085
I don't know!

397
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,902
<i>- We're almost through the field.</i>
- Good.

398
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,232
I'm on my way.

399
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,318
You need to implement
adjustments in the negotiation protocol

400
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:58,764
to exploit parallelism
at the device interface.

401
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,178
- What?
<i>- Just do what I say.</i>

402
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:04,841
<i>Start by unplugging the cable. 
Access the tablet's root directory.</i>

403
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:07,147
This is not simple.

404
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:19,218
- You have to get them out of there now.
- We're not done...

405
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:22,344
There's no more time!
The Replicators have breached the field!

406
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:30,423
What do you mean
they breached the field?

407
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:33,586
<i>They figured how to override it.
Look, we need to move much faster.</i>

408
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:35,864
<i>You need to make changes
to the negotiation protocol</i>

409
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:38,033
<i>to allow for direct data placement.</i>

410
00:23:38,153 --> 00:23:40,661
We need to allow for resynchronization
of the packet boundaries

411
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:42,266
within the data stream.

412
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,466
Oberoth is heading to the core room.

413
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,605
- He knows it's us.
- How far is he?

414
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:48,235
- Can they make a run for it?
- No.

415
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:51,000
Replicators are apoaching
from every direction. They're trapped.

416
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,901
Which means they're as good as dead.

417
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:54,758
We can hear you, you know.

418
00:23:54,878 --> 00:23:56,050
What? No.

419
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,817
When I say, "as good as dead,"
I mean it as more of a...

420
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,897
- Elizabeth, what are you doing?
- Stay here!

421
00:24:01,017 --> 00:24:02,766
Elizabeth, you can't go out there!

422
00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:04,350
<i>- Elizabeth!</i>
- What's going on?

423
00:24:04,446 --> 00:24:06,581
<i>- Elizabeth just left the jumper.</i>
- Why?

424
00:24:06,773 --> 00:24:08,632
I don't know. She just ran out.

425
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:11,147
<i>Elizabeth, this is Sheppard,
do you copy?</i>

426
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:15,674
Respond.

427
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,572
- If they capture her...
- I know, I know.

428
00:24:18,815 --> 00:24:20,285
<i>So, what do we do now?</i>

429
00:24:21,571 --> 00:24:24,809
She said to hit the kill switch on the
nanites if she did anything suspicious.

430
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,759
I know, but...

431
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,670
Sheppard.

432
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:35,443
Make the call.

433
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:38,958
Do it.

434
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:52,524
- It's not working.
- What?

435
00:24:52,644 --> 00:24:55,288
- Why not?
<i>- Just... give me a second.</i>

436
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,027
I'm not getting confirmation, and don't
ask why, because I don't know, OK?

437
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,034
The last time she had
active nanites inside her,

438
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:07,417
she was able to exert a certain control.
Maybe she's doing it here now, or...

439
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:09,793
maybe there's interference
that's affecting the frequency.

440
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:12,533
<i>I don't know.
I need to run a diagnostic.</i>

441
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:15,316
Better yet, why don't you figure out
a way how to get us out here?

442
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:18,797
If we're screwed, we might
as well complete the mission.

443
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:35,626
Dr. Weir?

444
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,414
Hello, Oberoth.

445
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:39,918
You're surprised.

446
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:41,198
Indeed, I am.

447
00:25:42,568 --> 00:25:44,460
Niam infected me with nanites.

448
00:25:45,391 --> 00:25:47,189
Yes, I can detect them now.

449
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:48,997
We were able to neutralize them,

450
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:51,254
and then reprogram

451
00:25:52,296 --> 00:25:54,772
and manipulate them to suit our needs.

452
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:57,191
Industrious of you.

453
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,551
Which is why, now that I've been able to
establish a physical link through you,

454
00:26:03,326 --> 00:26:06,487
I have direct access
to the Replicator collective.

455
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:10,656
I'm in control now.

456
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:17,419
OK, I'm plugged in. Anything?

457
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,717
Yes! Yes, it's working!

458
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,152
What the hell just happened?

459
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,095
The Replicators have all frozen.

460
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:48,742
Well, I can see that, but who did it?

461
00:26:48,963 --> 00:26:50,209
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

462
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:52,138
It might have been Elizabeth.

463
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:54,095
<i>- Can she do that?</i>
- I don't know. I mean,

464
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:57,040
<i>she'd have to link directly
with the collective, which means the</i>

465
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,532
<i>chances they'll be able to take over her
nanites have increased exponentially.</i>

466
00:27:00,612 --> 00:27:02,461
How long before they come back to life?

467
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:05,340
<i>Your guess is as good as mine,
but I would err on the side of less time</i>

468
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,344
<i>- rather than more.</i>
- So we go?

469
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:10,097
Yeah, first things first. How are we
doing with the upload?

470
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,079
Almost there. Just a few more seconds.

471
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,900
<i>- How many seconds?</i>
Don't start with that again!

472
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:20,796
I'm impressed with your strength,

473
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,617
Dr. Weir, but I must remind you,
that it's only a matter of time

474
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,742
before I make the necessary corrections

475
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:30,362
to overcome the hold you have on me.

476
00:27:30,872 --> 00:27:33,036
I am prepared to fight
for as long as I need.

477
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:34,803
Good for you.

478
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,857
Your desire to protect
your people is admirable,

479
00:27:40,317 --> 00:27:41,930
but you will, ultimately,

480
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:43,652
fail.

481
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:44,978
Keep thinking that.

482
00:27:46,015 --> 00:27:48,551
Keep allowing your arrogance
to undermine you.

483
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,995
You know it's true, Dr. Weir.

484
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,631
I can feel you weakening already.

485
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,256
Despite your desire

486
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,542
this is a fight for which you are...

487
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:05,018
clearly

488
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:06,694
ill-equipped.

489
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:08,363
<i>That's it, you're done! Unplug and go!</i>

490
00:28:28,246 --> 00:28:29,568
Once again,

491
00:28:30,104 --> 00:28:31,840
you have underestimated me.

492
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:40,812
<i>They're moving again!</i>

493
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:45,943
Yeah. I know.

494
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:19,470
Well,

495
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:21,102
this is familiar.

496
00:29:21,452 --> 00:29:23,830
I'm trying to decide
if this incursion of yours

497
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,398
reflects considerable bravery or

498
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:28,400
- stupidity.
- Where's Dr. Weir?

499
00:29:29,238 --> 00:29:31,124
Her attempts to seize
control of the collective

500
00:29:31,234 --> 00:29:33,239
proved too taxing for her,

501
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:36,510
<i>rendering her mind and body
virtually moribund.</i>

502
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:38,683
She has been taken to be...

503
00:29:38,998 --> 00:29:40,228
repaired.

504
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,439
- You're gonna take control of her.
- That has already occurred.

505
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:46,752
Unfortunately, I was not able to

506
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:49,558
glean all the information
I need from her,

507
00:29:49,695 --> 00:29:51,965
so I will have to extract it from you.

508
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:53,603
Information?

509
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:55,761
About the precise location of Atlantis.

510
00:29:56,164 --> 00:29:58,764
You left your planet before
we were able to destroy it.

511
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,002
Sorry to spoil your plans.

512
00:30:01,112 --> 00:30:02,575
Nothing is spoiled,

513
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:04,922
merely prolonged,

514
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,739
and now, with your help,

515
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,649
we will complete the destruction.

516
00:30:09,627 --> 00:30:12,653
Seeing how none of us
will volunteer the information...

517
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:15,245
You know quite well

518
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,716
that we have a simple method
for extracting what we need.

519
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:48,985
Problems?

520
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:10,085
What?

521
00:31:10,222 --> 00:31:12,545
I figured, you'd messed with our minds,

522
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:15,173
so I'd mess with yours.

523
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:17,794
You didn't overpower me, Oberoth.

524
00:31:18,163 --> 00:31:20,992
The Replicator guards
didn't capture my team.

525
00:31:23,177 --> 00:31:26,348
It was all a fictional scenario
played out in your mind.

526
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:29,533
In reality,
your guards are still frozen,

527
00:31:29,643 --> 00:31:32,964
and my team is escaping as we speak.

528
00:31:34,188 --> 00:31:35,848
You were wrong, Oberoth.

529
00:31:36,586 --> 00:31:38,787
I have never underestimated you,

530
00:31:40,263 --> 00:31:42,742
but you have clearly underestimated me.

531
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,320
You will not leave this city alive!

532
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:46,537
<i>Maybe not,</i>

533
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,540
but my team will.

534
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:52,151
- Still nothing from Elizabeth?
- <i>No.</i>

535
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:55,492
<i>Can't communicate with her or track her.
It's like she just... disappeared.</i>

536
00:31:55,574 --> 00:31:57,337
If she's the one
who froze the Replicators,

537
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,230
that means she's probably still alive.

538
00:31:59,312 --> 00:32:00,836
<i>For the moment, maybe.</i>

539
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:02,670
- She can't be that far.
- We'll find her.

540
00:32:02,913 --> 00:32:05,879
You better make it fast. The Replicators
could unfreeze at any moment.

541
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:07,437
<i>Thanks, Rodney!</i>

542
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,824
I admire your tenacity,

543
00:32:13,177 --> 00:32:14,732
but I won't be fooled again.

544
00:32:22,005 --> 00:32:24,219
You're struggling, Dr. Weir.

545
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,263
Get to the jumper!

546
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,223
You're coming with us.

547
00:32:48,887 --> 00:32:51,477
I can't keep them frozen much longer!

548
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,771
We're not leaving you behind!

549
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:55,465
If you don't leave right now,

550
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,405
none of us will get out of here, so go!

551
00:32:57,515 --> 00:32:59,026
That's an order!

552
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:01,653
Come on!

553
00:33:02,262 --> 00:33:03,197
Go!

554
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:08,577
Oh, thank God.

555
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:15,315
<i>Can we cloak?</i>

556
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,391
Rodney, can we cloak?

557
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:20,522
No, Not yet.

558
00:33:20,604 --> 00:33:23,675
We drained too much power trying
to convert the cloak into an AR field.

559
00:33:23,755 --> 00:33:26,427
I'll try to interface the ZPM,
but we're going to need some time.

560
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:29,941
Alright, we'll just have
to make a run for it then.

561
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:40,025
How's hyperspace looking?

562
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:42,961
Not good. Harnessing power
from the ZPM is tricky.

563
00:33:43,043 --> 00:33:44,747
If I'm off even
 a slightest amount, then

564
00:33:44,843 --> 00:33:46,698
- we could all...
- Two ships heading our way.

565
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:52,294
<i>- Rodney!</i>
- I need more time!

566
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:56,082
We just lost weapons!

567
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:57,464
- Dammit!
- Come on, McKay!

568
00:33:57,551 --> 00:33:58,977
This is not simple, you know?

569
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:02,107
If I don't properly calibrate the power
output, we could incinerate the moment

570
00:34:02,202 --> 00:34:03,692
the hyperspace window opens!

571
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:08,094
I'm picking something up dead ahead.

572
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:19,887
Oh, crap.

573
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:23,098
They're powering up weapons!

574
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:32,410
What the hell was that?

575
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:39,732
<i>Colonel Sheppard, this is the Apollo,
do you read?</i>

576
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,419
Colonel Ellis, is that you?

577
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:43,409
Affirmative. The 302 bay is open,

578
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:46,416
and you have permission to come aboard.
I suggest you hurry.

579
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:48,676
<i>Copy that, Apollo. We're on our way.</i>

580
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:51,651
Can I just add that your timing
is pretty damn perfect?

581
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:55,109
<i>We would've got here earlier, but we had
a little trouble finding Atlantis.</i>

582
00:34:57,078 --> 00:34:58,227
Wait, is that you?

583
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,105
It's me, Rodney.
I'll explain when you get onboard.

584
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:02,386
Colonel...

585
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,776
We lost Dr. Weir
on the Replicator planet. Can you...

586
00:35:06,198 --> 00:35:08,631
<i>lock on her locator beacon
and beam her up?</i>

587
00:35:11,337 --> 00:35:13,117
I'm not picking up any signal.

588
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,021
Copy that.

589
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,206
Here's a good one, M35-117.

590
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:40,370
- Does Dr. Weir know about it?
- Not on our primary or back-up list.

591
00:35:40,465 --> 00:35:43,048
I purposefully searched for a planet
we'd never considered before.

592
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,385
The Replicators can probe her mind
all they want, they won't find it.

593
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:47,628
Good...

594
00:35:48,006 --> 00:35:50,638
- For us.
- Well, look, it's a...

595
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:53,262
stable atmosphere, a big ocean.

596
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:55,367
Besides the large, particularly

597
00:35:55,449 --> 00:35:57,879
venomous snake-like creature
that inhabits the main land,

598
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,040
it looks to be a welcoming environment.

599
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:04,208
Alright. Radek, how we doing?

600
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:06,846
<i>All set here. The ZPM is online.</i>

601
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,212
OK,

602
00:36:08,622 --> 00:36:09,907
here we go.

603
00:36:29,275 --> 00:36:30,551
We did it.

604
00:36:31,776 --> 00:36:34,281
Well, there's still the small matter
of landing this thing.

605
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:37,189
I'll just jump in the chair,
ease us down.

606
00:36:37,366 --> 00:36:38,827
Well, that could be tricky.

607
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:41,248
We drained a lot of power
from the ZPM just getting here.

608
00:36:41,357 --> 00:36:43,716
We got enough energy to keep
the shield up for re-entry.

609
00:36:43,804 --> 00:36:46,490
There better be. A City this size
will create considerable friction.

610
00:36:46,586 --> 00:36:48,687
We come in too fast
or too steep, and the shield

611
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:51,789
could attenuate under the stress,
the whole place will be torn to shreds

612
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:53,425
or burn up, or both...

613
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:55,552
It never ends with you, you know?

614
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:56,845
What?

615
00:36:56,954 --> 00:36:59,222
Tell everyone to buckle up.
We're going in.

616
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:20,079
Shield's holding. So far so good.

617
00:37:20,724 --> 00:37:23,028
- What's wrong?
- Angle's too steep.

618
00:37:23,137 --> 00:37:25,386
Like this, we're gonna put
too much strain on the shield,

619
00:37:25,468 --> 00:37:27,654
which means more power draining
from the ZPM.

620
00:37:27,764 --> 00:37:29,445
Sheppard, we're coming in too steep.

621
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:31,504
We need to ease up
on the angle of re-entry.

622
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:35,035
In fact, you mean entry.
You see, we never actually left this...

623
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,676
Right, right.

624
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:44,428
<i>Ease up on the angle!</i>

625
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,020
I heard you the first time, Rodney.

626
00:37:47,393 --> 00:37:49,272
And yet we're still coming in too steep!

627
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:55,552
Hang on!

628
00:38:02,512 --> 00:38:04,036
We're over the ocean!

629
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:07,165
Sheppard you need to slow us down.
We're coming in over the water.

630
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:08,594
Copy that.

631
00:38:15,874 --> 00:38:17,869
<i>Still too fast! Slow down!</i>

632
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,844
<i>We want to touch down gently, like</i>

633
00:38:20,452 --> 00:38:22,762
like a leaf kissing
the surface of a pond.

634
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,660
Nice kissing.

635
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:52,418
How we doing?

636
00:38:54,512 --> 00:38:55,921
Systems are looking good...

637
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,112
<i>So far,</i>

638
00:38:57,246 --> 00:38:58,941
and plenty of power in the ZPM.

639
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:01,537
Drop the shield.

640
00:39:06,403 --> 00:39:08,166
<i>Colonel Sheppard, we made it.</i>

641
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:10,599
<i>The City's floating safely on the ocean.</i>

642
00:39:11,077 --> 00:39:12,416
<i>Excellent landing.</i>

643
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,051
Thank you.

644
00:39:51,068 --> 00:39:52,769
Who d'you think's gonna replace her?

645
00:39:56,385 --> 00:39:57,642
I don't know.

646
00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:02,385
Whoever it is...

647
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:05,282
That's tough shoes to fill.

648
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:11,204
Yes.

649
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:27,266
- OK, let's give it a go.
- Right.

650
00:40:41,515 --> 00:40:44,057
This is Atlantis,
calling Stargate Command.

651
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:45,396
Do you read?

652
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:52,488
<i>We read you, Atlantis.
Good to hear from you.</i>

653
00:40:52,611 --> 00:40:53,909
Great to be heard.

654
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:56,397
Tell General Landry
we're back on the grid.

655
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,203
<i>Rodney...</i>

656
00:40:58,392 --> 00:40:59,576
What?

657
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:01,337
Long-range scanners detect a massive

658
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,187
<i>fleet of ships being launched
from the Replicator planet,</i>

659
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:07,577
but they're not heading for us.

660
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,008
That's a Wraith planet.

661
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,850
The attack command
must have been activated.

662
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,641
What do you know? It worked!

663
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:21,139
There you are.

664
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:24,288
Two moons.

665
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:26,092
Actually, there are five.

666
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:28,894
It's just these these are only two
visible to the naked eye.

667
00:41:29,837 --> 00:41:31,341
- Really?
- Yeah.

668
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:38,202
Heard you and Rodney got us reconnected
to the intergalactic bridge.

669
00:41:38,325 --> 00:41:39,214
Yeah.

670
00:41:39,326 --> 00:41:42,329
General Landry was understandably
relieved to hear from us.

671
00:41:42,685 --> 00:41:46,361
You know, in all the excitement I never
got a chance to congratulate you.

672
00:41:48,315 --> 00:41:50,939
Your promotion.
You're a full bird Colonel now.

673
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:52,325
Thank you.

674
00:41:54,176 --> 00:41:56,144
- So you sticking around?
- No.

675
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:58,712
General Landry wants
Dr. Lee and I to gate back,

676
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,313
give him a full briefing
on the situation here.

677
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:03,243
The Apollo's gonna remain
in orbit for a while

678
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:04,984
in case you need any assistance.

679
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:09,387
Thanks for saving our asses
back there from the bad guys.

680
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:12,078
That was a risky move.

681
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:14,744
It was nothing compared to the risk
that you and your team took.

682
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,996
Frankly, I'm amazed that
you were able to pull it off.

683
00:42:20,265 --> 00:42:21,523
We had a lot of help.

684
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:24,400
Yeah.

685
00:42:25,745 --> 00:42:27,673
General Landry sends his condolences.

686
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:31,593
<i>He was deeply saddened
to hear about Dr. Weir.</i>

687
00:42:32,237 --> 00:42:33,379
We all were.

688
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,568
I haven't given up hope.

689
00:42:39,904 --> 00:42:42,105
If there's a chance she's still alive,

690
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:44,256
I'll find her.

691
00:42:45,508 --> 00:42:46,629
I know.
