1
00:00:02,308 --> 00:00:04,205
I find it sad.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,231
What? What're you talking about?

3
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:09,576
- He seems lonely.
- He does?

4
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:12,015
He never takes part
in any of the City social activities.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,969
Please...

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,203
He always eats alone.

7
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:16,952
Either in is office
or in is quarters.

8
00:00:17,077 --> 00:00:19,726
Maybe he has work to do.
Some of us are busy people.

9
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:24,906
Sometimes, when I walk by his quarters
at night, I heard him crying.

10
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:27,108
What? Really?

11
00:00:32,428 --> 00:00:34,627
Would you care to join us?

12
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:38,091
Thank you.

13
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:40,155
But I'll be taking breakfast
in my quarters.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,000
I still have some final preparations
for my impending performance evaluation.

15
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:47,401
- I'm a little apprehensive.
- You shouldn't be.

16
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:50,325
You've done a wonderful job
as our new commander.

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,062
Well, let's hope the IOA agrees.

18
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:55,340
There you go.

19
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,625
He prefers to be on his own.

20
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,599
Speaking of which, where's Sheppard?

21
00:01:00,872 --> 00:01:04,342
He flew some astrobiologists
to the mainland this morning.

22
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:06,731
And volunteered
to stay with them overnight.

23
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:09,150
He did?
Why would he do that?

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,982
This planet's sun is a class G star.

25
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:19,555
That fact, coupled with its Earth-like
atmospheric composition,

26
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:23,546
results in the predominance
of green photosynthetic organisms.

27
00:01:25,423 --> 00:01:28,169
Chlorophyll mostly absorbs
the sun's blue and red wavelengths,

28
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:30,046
reflecting green ones.

29
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:32,924
"But, hang on a minute,"
you're probably thinking.

30
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:35,593
Why doesn't chlorophyll
absorb green light?"

31
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:38,945
Yeah. Weird.
Well, why doesn't it?

32
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,941
- The answer lies not so much in the...
- Oh, my God!

33
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:43,394
Wait here.

34
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:47,177
What happened?

35
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:48,701
Look at this.

36
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:52,480
It's a plant not unlike
the <i>Begonia eiromischa</i>.

37
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,572
- God. Lorne warned me about this.
- You don't understand.

38
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:59,659
The woolly-stalked begonia
went officially extinct

39
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,887
back on Earth in 2007.

40
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:03,779
And yet here we are,

41
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:06,624
standing over a species
that's shockingly similar...

42
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:10,265
I'm gonna go back to the Jumper
and set up for the night.

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,710
Want to join me?

44
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:14,716
It's a very unusual find.

45
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:16,491
Right.

46
00:02:16,922 --> 00:02:19,822
Well, knock yourself out.
That's what we're here for.

47
00:02:20,926 --> 00:02:23,329
Take your time.
We're here all night.

48
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,044
Season 5 Episode 15
Remnants (v. 1.00)

49
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:54,061
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

50
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:56,759
www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

51
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,580
- Can I give you a hand with that?
- Actually, if you wouldn't mind...

52
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:39,842
- Where are you headed?
- Back to my quarters.

53
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:42,887
The southeast pier. Level 19.

54
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,387
Penthouse suite. Nice.

55
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:48,017
- Have we met?
- Not yet. I'm Vanessa Conrad.

56
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:55,471
I just recently arrived
on the Apollo.

57
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:57,380
- Welcome to Atlantis.
- Thank you.

58
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,123
It's beautiful. And huge.

59
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:02,136
It's probably gonna be weeks
before I know my way around.

60
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:03,507
Well, I'm sure

61
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,418
the gang at orientation
will help you settle in.

62
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,019
I'm sorry. I'm keeping you.

63
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:13,402
- Southeast pier, level 19.
- No. I have all the time in the...

64
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:21,455
- This is you, I believe.
- Right.

65
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:25,916
- Nice to meet you, Doctor.
- Vanessa.

66
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:29,182
- You can call me Vanessa.
- Very well.

67
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:30,726
Nice to meet you, Vanessa.

68
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:33,729
- Thank you, Mr. Woolsey.
- Actually, you can call me...

69
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,697
Dick.

70
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:01,312
Crap.

71
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:08,569
What happened
to your off-world foofaraw?

72
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:11,893
I thought you were the guest of honor
at some big diplomatic dinner on M2J?

73
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:14,040
Yeah, I was,
but the festivities ended early

74
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:16,068
when three members
of Lieutenant Donovan's team

75
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:17,966
suffered a severe allergic reaction

76
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:20,581
to something that we were served
at the grand banquet.

77
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:23,152
I think it might have been
those little green berries

78
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:24,716
with the purple specks on them,

79
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:27,000
because my tongue
did feel a little bit numb...

80
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,573
Yeah, FYI, this conversation
ended six seconds ago.

81
00:05:29,698 --> 00:05:32,479
Yeah, anyway,
on the way back, I had an idea.

82
00:05:32,604 --> 00:05:34,903
Have a little lie-down. It'll pass.

83
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:37,659
You should hear me out.

84
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,007
We should run a scan
of the ocean floor.

85
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,196
I've been noticing
anomalous temperature

86
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:46,468
in the waters surrounding the City.
I think it bears

87
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,842
- further investigation.
- Not really.

88
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:51,858
We head through the Gate every day
exploring distant worlds,

89
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:54,756
and yet, with the exception
of a few marine biology tests,

90
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:57,443
we have barely scratched the surface
of the very planet that we occupy.

91
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:58,938
'Cause there's nothing there.

92
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:00,860
My point is
it wouldn't hurt to be thorough.

93
00:06:01,224 --> 00:06:04,279
My point is your point is pointless.
And a giant waste of time.

94
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:13,730
Dammit.

95
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,208
Xiao, welcome.

96
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:31,564
Atlantis welcomes you.

97
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:36,204
It is with great pride that I...

98
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:42,233
Hello, Richard.

99
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,038
Welcome to Atlantis...

100
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:50,158
With... great pride.

101
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:53,993
I'm looking forward
to the grand tour.

102
00:06:54,302 --> 00:06:55,355
Well, then...

103
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,983
- Shall we?
- Yes.

104
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:08,559
This is the control room...

105
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:12,482
for all intents and purposes,
the City's nerve center.

106
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,359
These technicians are the very best
at what they do.

107
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,334
How's the kickboxing going, Amelia?

108
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,561
Great, Sir.
Thanks for asking.

109
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:25,165
Hello there, Chet.

110
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,390
It's Chuck.

111
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:27,477
Excuse me?

112
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:29,417
It's Chuck, sir.
My name is Chuck.

113
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,092
Of course. Chuck.

114
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,815
Chet's on the late shift.

115
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,665
There is no Chet.

116
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:42,340
I think it would be a simple matter

117
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:45,021
of reconfiguring the City's short-range
sensors in order to achieve...

118
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:48,164
You know, I can see your lips moving
but I'm not hearing any sound.

119
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:50,353
It would take less than an hour

120
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:52,230
to make the necessary adjustments.

121
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:55,715
All right, you know what?
If it is so simple and important to you,

122
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,148
why don't you just go ahead
and do it yourself?

123
00:07:58,273 --> 00:08:00,951
- Because I require your authorization.
- You got it.

124
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,365
Thank you, Rodney.

125
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,067
You realize it's highly unlikely
you'll actually find anything.

126
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:08,982
No? Then I would have wasted
an hour of my time

127
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:11,323
and you'll be able to tell me
"I told you so."

128
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:14,044
If, on the other hand,
I do find something,

129
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,369
perhaps they'll name something after me
for a change.

130
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:24,074
The prospect of commanding
the Atlantis expedition

131
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,529
was a daunting one.

132
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:28,783
Dr. Weir and Colonel Carter
were incredibly tough acts to follow.

133
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,856
Yet you availed yourself nicely,
Richard.

134
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:32,852
And you survived
your nine months here.

135
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:35,909
Well, I like to think I've accomplished
a little more than mere survival,

136
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:38,266
and I'm certain
that once you've had review my report...

137
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,927
That won't be necessary.

138
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:44,438
- I'm receiving my graduation papers?
- Of course.

139
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:48,358
In recognition
of the great job you've done here,

140
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:50,530
the IOA is appointing you as chair

141
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,257
of Earth's
new environmental initiative.

142
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:55,200
Congratulations, Richard.

143
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:56,826
You're coming home.

144
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:02,247
All right,
short-range sensors are good to go.

145
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:03,943
Start the sweep.

146
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,001
Sweep initiated.

147
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:07,531
Great.

148
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:10,447
So it should take about 30 minutes
to scan the entire planet,

149
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:12,815
which means I've time
to get down to the cafeteria,

150
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,481
get myself some of that fine
almond biscotti and a Yoo-hoo,

151
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:18,730
and be back in time for you to tell me
you have found nothing.

152
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:20,458
We've found something.

153
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:25,935
Yes, of course we did.

154
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:30,977
Whatever it is,
it's sitting approximately

155
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:33,096
1,500 feet below sea level.

156
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:04,364
Hello, John.

157
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,310
I don't understand your reaction.

158
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:19,035
Nine months ago,
you were dreading coming over here.

159
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,183
A lot has changed in nine months.

160
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:22,609
I like it here.

161
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:26,666
And, quite frankly, I don't like
the idea of leaving a job unfinished.

162
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,589
I've done good work.

163
00:10:31,312 --> 00:10:33,130
My record speaks for itself.

164
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:35,424
What's really going on?

165
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:40,513
The IOA is concerned
about some of the decisions you've made,

166
00:10:41,163 --> 00:10:43,310
decisions that have run
counter to protocol

167
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,434
and, quite frankly, common sense.

168
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:47,163
They... We...

169
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:51,415
feel that the demands of this position
have compromised your judgment,

170
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,983
and it's time for a change.

171
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,155
Right here.

172
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:02,827
That'll do.

173
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:06,193
I wonder how long
it's been down there.

174
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:09,756
To think, it would have remained
undiscovered if we hadn't have...

175
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,438
Nice job on reconfiguring
the short-range sensors.

176
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:13,563
Thank you.

177
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:16,000
Nice job on the... wild guess.

178
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:17,407
Thank you.

179
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:19,290
- Shall we?
- Yes.

180
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:22,186
Keep looking.

181
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:24,920
There's nowhere for them to go.
They're scientists.

182
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:27,348
Trust me.
They don't run very fast.

183
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:30,958
You're awake.

184
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:35,528
Save your energy.
You're not getting away this time.

185
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:37,840
I killed you.

186
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,519
You shot me. There's a difference.

187
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:42,491
No. I killed you.

188
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:46,412
- Beckett confirmed it. You were dead.
- I'm sure that's what he thought.

189
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:49,039
Let's just say your friend...
Lucius?

190
00:11:49,532 --> 00:11:52,635
He wasn't the only one
using Ancient technology that day.

191
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,507
How did you get here?

192
00:11:57,557 --> 00:11:58,756
How did you find us?

193
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:01,593
Turns out
some of your off-world contacts

194
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:04,170
aren't as trustworthy as you think.

195
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:06,196
Your secret's out, Sheppard.

196
00:12:09,872 --> 00:12:13,657
A half day's walk in that direction will
bring us to the edge of the mainland.

197
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:17,985
I figure it'll take us maybe two days
to reach Atlantis by boat.

198
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:22,855
You won't get to the edge of the City.
They'll blow you out of the water.

199
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,081
No. They won't even see us coming.
They'll be too busy counting their dead.

200
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:31,063
What are you gonna do?

201
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:36,037
Send an explosive through your Gate,

202
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:38,249
cripple the City's defenses.

203
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:41,365
But for that,
I'm gonna need something from you.

204
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,176
I think you call it

205
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:44,903
an IDC.

206
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:46,763
Go to hell.

207
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,850
I thought you would need
some convincing.

208
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,549
Dr. Conrad. Vanessa.
Come in.

209
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:09,186
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- Not at all. What brings you by?

210
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:11,793
This may be wholly inappropriate,
but I was wondering

211
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:14,429
- whether you'd like to catch a movie.
- A movie?

212
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:16,244
They're screening two
of my favorites...

213
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:19,666
Planes, trains, and automobiles
and dirty rotten scoundrels.

214
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:21,846
Truth be told,

215
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,718
I'm having a horrible day
and I'm not of a laughing mood.

216
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:26,871
We can wait until tomorrow

217
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:29,181
when they'll be screening
Mad Money and Kangaroo Jack.

218
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:36,934
Is it something
you'd like to talk about?

219
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:39,834
It seems the time for talk
has passed.

220
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:43,090
I've just been informed
that I'm being relieved of my command

221
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:44,859
here on Atlantis.

222
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:47,407
I'm sorry. Why?

223
00:13:47,998 --> 00:13:51,396
Apparently, I'm not very good
at toeing the company line.

224
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:55,748
I assumed I got this position
on the strength of my record.

225
00:13:55,873 --> 00:13:58,250
But now it's clear that the only reason
they appointed me

226
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,258
Is because they expected
I would just roll over for them.

227
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,326
Then don't.

228
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:06,295
- What?
- Don't roll over for them.

229
00:14:07,021 --> 00:14:08,754
- Fight this.
- I can't.

230
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,801
The decision's been made.

231
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:14,693
If that was true, then why didn't they
just forward you a communique

232
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:18,317
instead of sending a mouthpiece on
a 3-week journey to the Pegasus galaxy?

233
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,982
Did you really expect me
to just give up without a fight?

234
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,627
Honestly? Yes.

235
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,925
I assumed you'd let common sense
guide you on this one.

236
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,005
You weren't sent here to fire me.

237
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,056
You were sent here
to evaluate my performance

238
00:14:44,181 --> 00:14:46,720
and make a recommendation
based on your findings.

239
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,755
The IOA may be
leaning a certain way,

240
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,934
but they have yet to make a decision
on my fate.

241
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:55,225
Yet you, their representative,

242
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:57,683
clearly have...

243
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:03,737
Which leads me to assume
something else is going on here.

244
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:08,811
Someone in the IOA wants me gone

245
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:11,662
and is using you
to make sure that happens.

246
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,014
Tell me, Xiao.

247
00:15:17,254 --> 00:15:18,804
What are you getting in return?

248
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:29,096
It's my job, isn't it?

249
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:33,362
They've promised you
the Atlantis command

250
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:35,144
if you help them get rid of me?

251
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:38,394
This will all go a lot easier

252
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:41,505
- if you accept where this is going.
- The hell I will.

253
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,729
Richard, I hold all the cards.

254
00:15:43,854 --> 00:15:46,655
The decision is in my hands.
This is a fight you cannot win.

255
00:16:00,504 --> 00:16:03,357
You can tolerate more
than any man I've ever known.

256
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,156
Now, why is that?

257
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:08,802
Well, I was married once.

258
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:17,550
You're here in the Pegasus galaxy
to protect your people,

259
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:20,646
but half the time,
you can't even do that.

260
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:23,602
That's what drives you, isn't it?

261
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:25,964
Your past failures.

262
00:16:31,503 --> 00:16:33,327
Do you think
by not giving me the IDC

263
00:16:33,698 --> 00:16:35,717
you're keeping your people safe?

264
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,344
You're just putting off
the inevitable.

265
00:16:38,753 --> 00:16:41,029
It's over.
You can't protect them.

266
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:43,420
You, those scientists,

267
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:47,382
your friends back at Atlantis...
They're as good as dead.

268
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:55,627
Well, I see that asking nice
isn't working.

269
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,008
I'm gonna have to make
other plans.

270
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,899
Two men report to my position.

271
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:06,096
<i>On our way.</i>

272
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:09,906
In a couple of minutes,

273
00:17:10,623 --> 00:17:13,155
you're gonna wish
you'd given me that IDC.

274
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:17,765
What are you working on?

275
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,925
According to this,
the device is emitting

276
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,813
a low-level energy signature
in an oscillating pattern.

277
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:25,285
- Is it dangerous?
- No. Radiation's minimal, but...

278
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,876
Unimportant.
We should be focusing on the data.

279
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:28,855
I was.

280
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,876
Like, I've run every kind of decrypt
sweep I can think of at this thing.

281
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,248
Still nothing.
I don't know what to do.

282
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:36,627
- Oh, you'll think of something.
- Really.

283
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:39,975
- What makes you so sure?
- Oh, because you're brilliant.

284
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:42,876
That's true. Doesn't mean I'm gonna...
Wait a minute. What did you say?

285
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:45,315
Why did you say that?
What are you, sick? Am I sick?

286
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,388
- What've you heard?
- No, nobody's sick, Rodney.

287
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:51,488
I said you were brilliant
because... Because you are.

288
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:55,501
I rarely say it because you're
a difficult man to compliment.

289
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,836
You're egotistical,
you're arrogant, you're stubborn...

290
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:58,995
And brilliant.

291
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:02,251
Yes, Rodney.
And brilliant.

292
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:03,744
Right. Well...

293
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:06,788
pull up a chair, Radek.
We've got some work to do.

294
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,663
All right...

295
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,382
Tell me what plan B is,

296
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:14,011
or are you just gonna surprise me?

297
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:18,181
I'm gonna have my men repair the damage
they did to your Puddle Jumper,

298
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,689
then use it to attack the City.

299
00:18:20,814 --> 00:18:22,656
Well, I hate to be Mr. Negative,

300
00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:25,480
but I can think of at least one problem
you're gonna run into.

301
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:29,682
Yes, I know all about the Ancient gene
needed to operate the Jumper.

302
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:31,820
But that's not gonna be a problem

303
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:34,448
because you're gonna give us a hand.

304
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:35,805
Hold him.

305
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,828
Last chance, Johnny Boy.

306
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:49,137
You gonna give me that IDC?

307
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:54,596
Didn't think so.

308
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:18,575
You're an interesting man, Sheppard.

309
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,870
You travel to another galaxy,

310
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:24,247
risk your life defending a bunch
of people you don't even know.

311
00:19:25,194 --> 00:19:28,000
If you ask me, you're either someone
with a death wish

312
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:31,151
or someone
running away from something.

313
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:33,933
So tell me,

314
00:19:34,697 --> 00:19:36,259
what are you running away from?

315
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,481
- Where have you been?
- All over.

316
00:19:42,606 --> 00:19:44,431
The EM radiation
this device is giving off

317
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,558
covers the entire City
and well beyond.

318
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:48,014
You said it wasn't dangerous.

319
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:51,569
It's not. At least, according to this...
It has a relatively low frequency.

320
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:55,059
At worst, some people may experience
headaches or trouble sleeping.

321
00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:57,197
Well, then, we'll shut it off
before bedtime.

322
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,431
In the meantime,
you should be focusing on the data.

323
00:20:00,556 --> 00:20:02,367
I'm not getting anywhere with that.

324
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,996
I mean, despite the fact
that I am a genius.

325
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,089
I said you were brilliant.
Not you were a genius.

326
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:10,182
Same diff.
I don't get it.

327
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:12,694
You know, this script appears to be
a lot less complicated

328
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,980
than many we've encountered.
It's only 12 symbols

329
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:17,175
in an endlessly repeating
yet varying sequences.

330
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,568
I agree.
It's very curious.

331
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:23,975
It's like being asked to figure out
the password for an alien laptop

332
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,240
or something.

333
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:27,744
I think that if we...

334
00:20:28,373 --> 00:20:31,970
- What? What are you doing?
- I'm figuring out the alien's password.

335
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:34,012
- Rodney, I was kidding.
- No, it makes sense...

336
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,946
Every kid with a computer
password-protects.

337
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,528
Why wouldn't an alien?

338
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:43,471
There.
Why didn't I see that before?

339
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:45,757
- What?
- The pattern isn't in the text.

340
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:48,831
It's in the spaces in between the text,
each exactly 12 symbols in length.

341
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:53,308
Each section of text
is a multiple of 12... 24, 48, 96...

342
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:55,706
Separated by a 12-symbol space.

343
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:58,727
Look, it's... it's a puzzle.
It's a prompt.

344
00:20:58,852 --> 00:20:59,909
What are you doing?

345
00:21:00,034 --> 00:21:02,374
Running pattern recognition software
on the 12-symbol sequence.

346
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:04,523
Hopefully I can come up
with a 12-symbol permutation

347
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:07,118
that I can feed directly
back into the device.

348
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:09,688
And if I'm right...
If we're right...

349
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,939
we unlock the alien laptop.

350
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,492
You poached my private spot.

351
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:26,119
What?

352
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:28,814
What I meant to say is

353
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,631
you discovered
my little personal area.

354
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:36,838
This is where I come
to be alone with my thoughts.

355
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:40,533
- Do you mind sharing it?
- Not at all.

356
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:45,555
It's beautiful.

357
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:52,007
I wish I could stay here forever.

358
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,482
By the way, I wanted to thank you
for earlier today.

359
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:01,529
- I took your advice.
- Are they backing down?

360
00:22:02,491 --> 00:22:03,491
Unlikely.

361
00:22:04,334 --> 00:22:05,520
But at the very least,

362
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:08,119
I have the satisfaction
of knowing I went out swinging.

363
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:12,503
You're a good man, Richard.

364
00:22:14,237 --> 00:22:16,256
I really wish they could see that.

365
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:20,868
Vanessa, would you like
to have dinner with me tonight?

366
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,384
It would be my pleasure.

367
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:26,743
Wonderful.

368
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,120
What time should I swing by
to pick you up?

369
00:22:30,245 --> 00:22:32,584
It might be easier
if we just met up.

370
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,948
Mr. Woolsey, you're off radio.

371
00:22:36,073 --> 00:22:38,329
Dr. McKay needs to see you
right away.

372
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:52,816
That is the historical, scientific,
and technological records

373
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:54,572
of an extinct civilization,

374
00:22:54,697 --> 00:22:56,320
and if this device
is any indication,

375
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:58,240
a highly advanced one at that.

376
00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:01,196
I mean, medical breakthroughs,
specifications for advanced weaponry...

377
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:03,073
- This is incredible.
- It is.

378
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:07,632
- I sense a "but".
- No, no, no. No, no, no. No "buts".

379
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:10,760
- A "By the way", maybe.
- I'm listening.

380
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:12,827
Like I said, the device contains
the records

381
00:23:12,952 --> 00:23:14,431
for a long-dead civilization.

382
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:17,071
But it also contains
the chemical building blocks

383
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,009
for a silicon-based lifeform.

384
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:21,609
- What does that mean?
- This device was designed

385
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:23,400
to seed planets with organisms

386
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:26,448
that would, in time,
evolve into a sentient race.

387
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:29,617
Once that sentient race reached
a certain level of maturity,

388
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:32,491
they could then benefit from
the information left for them by their

389
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:33,954
extinct ancestors.

390
00:23:34,945 --> 00:23:37,060
- So what happened?
- I'm not sure.

391
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:39,943
Obviously, they didn't complete
their journey.

392
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:42,619
They ended up here instead.
Still, with the help of the Daedalus,

393
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:46,550
we could ensure that it finally reached
its target destination.

394
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:50,634
Okay, let's copy the data
and then send it on its way.

395
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:53,259
Which is where
the "Oh, by the way" comes in.

396
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:56,977
Look, this device is set up
in such a way that accessing the data

397
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,005
would do irreparable damage
to the biological samples.

398
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,036
In other words, it's either/or?

399
00:24:02,385 --> 00:24:05,657
Either we take the data
or we send it on its way.

400
00:24:05,782 --> 00:24:07,368
We can't do both.

401
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:13,911
You disappoint me, John.

402
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:16,828
I didn't think
you'd be this easy to break.

403
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:19,667
Even those two scientists you came with
put up more of a fight...

404
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:22,059
before we killed them.

405
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:26,016
Just another two you couldn't save.

406
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,010
We're done.

407
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:31,320
It's operational?

408
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:33,820
We used the genetic material
to initiate it.

409
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:36,736
You hear that, Sheppard?
We've got the Jumper...

410
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:40,687
Sir, we can come back and deal with him
once we're done with Atlantis.

411
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:44,221
We deal with him now.
Find him and kill him.

412
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,468
Hello, Ellen.

413
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:53,386
Hello... you.

414
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:56,514
Amelia, could you please
do me a favor

415
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:59,133
and pass on a message
to Dr. Vanessa Conrad?

416
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:01,132
She's in one
of the science departments.

417
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:04,145
Please tell her that,
given Dr. McKay's recent findings,

418
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,422
we may have to
reschedule our dinner tonight.

419
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,746
Dr. Conrad?
Are you sure, sir?

420
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,126
Better yet, why don't you just tell me
where her quarters are?

421
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:18,085
I suppose it's only proper
that I tell her personally.

422
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,195
There's nothing here, sir.

423
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,010
She hasn't been assigned
quarters yet?

424
00:25:22,135 --> 00:25:25,107
No sir, according to this,
there's no Dr. Conrad on Atlantis.

425
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:52,349
Amelia, the woman I was talking to

426
00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:54,771
when you approached me
earlier today...

427
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,288
- Sir?
- On the balcony.

428
00:25:58,412 --> 00:26:02,407
The woman I was speaking with when you
delivered the message from Dr. McKay.

429
00:26:02,974 --> 00:26:05,225
She probably left
before I got there, sir.

430
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,253
When I approached you
on the balcony, you were alone.

431
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,256
There's nothing wrong with you.

432
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:34,787
- What's going on?
- I'll let you know in a second.

433
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:38,287
- I'm just looking over your results.
- She won't find anything.

434
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:42,350
According to this, you're fine.
Perfectly normal.

435
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,477
- See?
- Then what is going on?

436
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,570
Why isn't your name in the database?

437
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:49,076
Why couldn't Amelia
see you earlier today?

438
00:26:50,201 --> 00:26:52,360
I'm pretty sure my name
is in the database.

439
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:54,974
And as for Amelia,
if she has a medical concern,

440
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:57,036
there's no reason
why she shouldn't see me.

441
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:59,409
- When did she come by?
- She can't see me, Richard.

442
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:02,746
Only you can see me.

443
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,910
Why?

444
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:07,340
I'd like to clarify
the misunderstanding.

445
00:27:07,577 --> 00:27:09,472
I don't want her thinking
I turned her away.

446
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:12,672
Amelia's fine.
I'll talk to her.

447
00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:16,039
Great.

448
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:18,572
As for you,

449
00:27:19,422 --> 00:27:21,615
you said you've been feeling unwell?

450
00:27:22,944 --> 00:27:23,934
That's right.

451
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:25,230
Tired?

452
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:26,597
Somewhat.

453
00:27:27,288 --> 00:27:30,910
Any visual symptoms? Shadows or flashes
in your field of vision?

454
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:36,821
Sort of. Yes.

455
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:38,661
What about auditory symptoms?

456
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:41,137
Occasional ringing
or buzzing or whistling?

457
00:27:41,262 --> 00:27:42,592
We need to talk.

458
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,845
- Yes. The occasional buzzing.
- Somewhere private.

459
00:27:46,986 --> 00:27:48,208
There it goes again.

460
00:27:50,722 --> 00:27:53,091
I bet you haven't
been sleeping very well,

461
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,422
what with this whole
probationary review...

462
00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:58,291
Of course.
That's it exactly.

463
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:01,463
You're obviously under a lot of stress,
and sometimes anxiety

464
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:03,846
can manifest itself
in a variety of ways,

465
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:06,347
but these are gonna help you relax

466
00:28:06,472 --> 00:28:08,092
and sleep through the night.

467
00:28:08,217 --> 00:28:10,814
And hopefully, once you're well rested,
you'll be feeling much better,

468
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:13,692
and your symptoms will disappear.
But if they don't,

469
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:16,027
come back and see me.
Okay?

470
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,349
Thank you, Doctor.

471
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,612
I wouldn't advise taking those.

472
00:28:29,954 --> 00:28:34,156
- How long have you been standing there?
- Sorry. I didn't wanna disturb you.

473
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:36,528
- You seemed deep in thought.
- I'm always deep in thought.

474
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:37,897
Keeps me sharp.

475
00:28:38,437 --> 00:28:39,670
And sleepless.

476
00:28:41,003 --> 00:28:42,430
So, what are you working on?

477
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,377
I'm just analyzing the readings
from the radiation of the device.

478
00:28:45,502 --> 00:28:46,653
Jeez, the radiation.

479
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:49,016
I'm just killing time
till Woolsey gives us the green light

480
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,189
to start data retrieval
on that thing.

481
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,750
- You think he will?
- Of course. This is huge...

482
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:58,169
The achievements of an alien race,
are you kidding me?

483
00:29:01,313 --> 00:29:02,540
Wait a minute.

484
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:04,052
What?

485
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:07,549
The modulated, ultra-low frequency
emanating from the device...

486
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,122
I've seen something like this
before.

487
00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:43,393
I'm sorry I made you doubt
your sanity.

488
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:45,699
Who are you?
What are you?

489
00:29:46,348 --> 00:29:47,585
A physical manifestation

490
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,608
of your subconscious
romantic and sexual ideals.

491
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:54,222
Oh, God.

492
00:29:55,683 --> 00:29:58,463
You're not crazy.
You're really seeing me.

493
00:29:59,803 --> 00:30:01,883
- Why?
- I'm sorry I had to deceive you,

494
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,511
but the survival
of an entire civilization is at stake.

495
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,220
This has something to do

496
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:11,309
with that device
Dr. McKay recovered, doesn't it?

497
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:15,687
She can't see me.

498
00:30:26,487 --> 00:30:29,140
I thought I heard you talking
with someone.

499
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:33,400
I was running through the pep talk

500
00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:36,287
I'm going to be giving
the gang in microbiology.

501
00:30:36,412 --> 00:30:37,412
Really?

502
00:30:38,158 --> 00:30:41,312
You know, I saw you on the balcony
this afternoon talking with...

503
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:42,632
yourself.

504
00:30:44,706 --> 00:30:45,517
I...

505
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:49,095
occasionally do verbalize my thoughts.
It helps me put things in perspective.

506
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:52,694
A casual observer might find that
sort of behavior a little disconcerting,

507
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:55,086
especially coming
from someone in your position...

508
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:57,617
faced with
a very important decision.

509
00:30:58,854 --> 00:31:00,536
Another nail in my coffin?

510
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:02,652
Dr. McKay briefed me
on the device he recovered.

511
00:31:02,812 --> 00:31:04,403
Yes, it is an impressive find.

512
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,857
- That doesn't belong to you.
- Please...

513
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,101
sit down.

514
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,602
He tells me you've delayed
giving the go-ahead

515
00:31:13,727 --> 00:31:15,226
on the data retrieval.

516
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:19,278
I'm not sure if Dr. McKay explained
the dilemma we're facing...

517
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,421
I can't even believe you're considering
letting this slip away.

518
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,090
There are other issues to consider.

519
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,925
- Such as?
- The fate of another race.

520
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:28,009
Will you stay out of this!

521
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,526
I will do no such thing.

522
00:31:32,414 --> 00:31:35,754
Their civilization is dead.
Ours, on the other hand, is alive,

523
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:37,352
and we could use that information.

524
00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:40,815
We'd be robbing a civilization
of the opportunity to rebuild itself.

525
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,425
There's no guarante
that a civilization will evolve

526
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,000
from the seeding process.

527
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,989
The entire race could die out
before it even reached sentient status.

528
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:51,747
And we would be throwing away
an incredible opportunity.

529
00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:52,889
Or...

530
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:56,133
consigning billions
of potential lives

531
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,790
to oblivion.

532
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:04,003
I can't believe
your good fortune, Richard.

533
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:08,134
This is your opportunity to show
the team back home you can play ball.

534
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,546
Follow procedure and save your job,

535
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:15,107
or you can hand it to me
on a silver platter.

536
00:32:15,272 --> 00:32:16,406
Your choice.

537
00:32:55,126 --> 00:32:56,876
How dare you threaten me?

538
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,808
It's not a threat, Richard.

539
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:01,812
I'm simply telling you
how things are going to play out

540
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:03,731
if we lose that device.

541
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:06,358
Richard, please.
They were a kind and peaceful race,

542
00:33:06,871 --> 00:33:08,777
one well worth saving.

543
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:10,939
We need to get rid of it!

544
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:12,990
The energy signature that device
is giving off

545
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,314
is very similar to one
we encountered on M1B-129.

546
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,993
It can induce mass hallucinations.

547
00:33:17,154 --> 00:33:20,636
Or function as a means of communication
between two very different species.

548
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:25,040
Let's act quickly.

549
00:33:25,324 --> 00:33:27,772
Salvage the data
and destroy the device.

550
00:33:27,897 --> 00:33:29,243
Thank you all...

551
00:33:29,765 --> 00:33:31,180
both for enlightening me.

552
00:33:31,305 --> 00:33:33,330
I'll make my decision shortly.

553
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:34,878
Please.

554
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:43,062
Now...

555
00:33:44,077 --> 00:33:46,357
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

556
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:50,016
This has gone on long enough.
Use your other hand.

557
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:52,510
Go on.

558
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:57,939
I have no intention
of letting you die.

559
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:01,142
Now, climb back up, John.

560
00:34:06,585 --> 00:34:07,589
That's it.

561
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,372
What the hell's going on here?

562
00:34:25,582 --> 00:34:27,232
Tens of thousands of years ago,

563
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,760
a civilization foresaw its end.

564
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,727
After millions of years
of evolution,

565
00:34:32,852 --> 00:34:35,196
the race known as the Sekkari
faced extinction.

566
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:37,617
Knowing they couldn't
save themselves,

567
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,535
they spent their final days
creating the means to start over.

568
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,623
They built seed carriers,

569
00:34:42,774 --> 00:34:46,083
each with a different target world
programmed into its navigation system,

570
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:49,419
worlds that would provide them
with the chemical compounds necessary

571
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:52,268
to produce, sustain,
and develop life.

572
00:34:53,853 --> 00:34:55,805
Each seed carrier
also held a repository

573
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,928
containing the history
of the Sekkari people...

574
00:34:58,742 --> 00:35:00,294
Their struggles, their achievements,

575
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:02,975
and the mistakes that ultimately led
to their own destruction.

576
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:06,269
The seed carriers were outfitted
with subspace communicators

577
00:35:06,631 --> 00:35:09,783
designed to alert the group
once a seeding was successful.

578
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,651
Over 50 were launched.
None achieved their goal.

579
00:35:13,183 --> 00:35:16,405
This unit malfunctioned.
I guided it to the nearest planet...

580
00:35:16,565 --> 00:35:17,634
This world,

581
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:20,534
in the hope that it would prove suitable
to the life-forming process.

582
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:22,509
It wasn't.

583
00:35:22,765 --> 00:35:25,748
This device survived re-entry
relatively unscathed,

584
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,458
then spent the next 2,000 years
at the ocean's bottom,

585
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:32,629
until recently, when its dormant
systems were awakened by its sensors

586
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:35,716
picking up trace readings
from one of your submerged Jumpers.

587
00:35:36,149 --> 00:35:39,490
The one Dr. McKay flew up
out of the underwater bay weeks ago.

588
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:42,597
I scanned your city,
and then I linked with you.

589
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,388
What are you?

590
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:47,936
I'm the seed carrier's
artificial intelligence.

591
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:51,022
My aim was to study you,
to get to know you,

592
00:35:51,495 --> 00:35:54,234
and, eventually, direct you
to help complete this unit's assignment.

593
00:35:54,592 --> 00:35:55,997
- By manipulating me.
- No.

594
00:35:56,122 --> 00:35:57,883
By finding out
what kind of person you were

595
00:35:58,008 --> 00:36:00,958
in the hope that
we could place our trust in you.

596
00:36:01,365 --> 00:36:03,894
Couldn't you have simply communicated
your situation to us

597
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:05,359
from the beginning?

598
00:36:05,716 --> 00:36:07,160
Please understand...

599
00:36:07,285 --> 00:36:09,748
I am the last hope
for the Sekkari people.

600
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:11,709
I couldn't risk it.

601
00:36:12,886 --> 00:36:13,886
I'm sorry.

602
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:17,922
As a soldier, you were a threat.

603
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:20,093
If anyone was to use force
to secure the repository,

604
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:22,809
it would have been you,
the military man.

605
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:26,049
So I connected with your mind
to distract you.

606
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:27,757
Distract me?

607
00:36:28,692 --> 00:36:32,363
Making me think the Jumper was sabotaged
would've been enough of a distraction.

608
00:36:32,488 --> 00:36:34,589
You would have discovered
the subterfuge.

609
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:37,324
I'm unable to maintain
a static illusion over time.

610
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:39,987
It was necessary
to keep your mind occupied.

611
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:42,408
- And that's what you chose?
- What you chose.

612
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,701
I didn't have full control
over your hallucination

613
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:46,616
or the direction it took.

614
00:36:46,822 --> 00:36:49,200
It was your mind
driving the diversion.

615
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:50,936
I merely played along.

616
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:52,876
Are you saying I tortured myself?

617
00:36:53,187 --> 00:36:54,920
You torture yourself
every day, John.

618
00:36:55,524 --> 00:36:58,672
But in this case, it was your mind
manifesting your darkest fears.

619
00:36:59,057 --> 00:37:02,092
You were the architect
of your own self-deception.

620
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:06,982
Now you know the truth

621
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:10,176
and have a decision to make.

622
00:37:15,112 --> 00:37:17,263
Colonel, where were you?
We're sitting here for...

623
00:37:17,388 --> 00:37:19,339
Shut up. Get in the Jumper.

624
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,827
<i>Sorry to disturb you, Ms. Shen,</i>

625
00:37:26,952 --> 00:37:29,581
<i>but you've just received
a secure transmission from Earth.</i>

626
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,790
- <i>Can I patch it through?</i>
- Go ahead.

627
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:37,507
Luthor.
How are things?

628
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:38,634
<i>Well,</i>

629
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:42,596
<i>but I felt it only fair to inform you
of recent developments here.</i>

630
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,387
<i>As much as I believe you'd be
a worthy candidate to replace Richard,</i>

631
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:49,969
<i>I'm afraid the rest of the council
feels otherwise.</i>

632
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:53,016
<i>It looks like we'll be going
with James Coolidge instead.</i>

633
00:37:53,141 --> 00:37:54,771
- Coolidge?
- <i>Don't worry.</i>

634
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,941
<i>You'll still be rewarded
for facilitating the transition.</i>

635
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:00,328
<i>Congratulations.</i>

636
00:38:00,556 --> 00:38:03,779
<i>You'll be chairing the IOA's
new environmental initiative.</i>

637
00:38:15,441 --> 00:38:16,472
I'm off.

638
00:38:17,269 --> 00:38:19,371
I suppose I'll be joining you shortly.

639
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:22,215
Don't make any holiday plans.
You're not going anywhere.

640
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:24,946
I gave you a glowing review.

641
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:28,345
And since your future rests
entirely on my report,

642
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:31,219
I'd like to be the first
to congratulate you as the new

643
00:38:31,344 --> 00:38:34,435
Permanent Commander
of the Atlantis expedition.

644
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:37,657
I don't understand.

645
00:38:39,477 --> 00:38:41,985
Like you, Richard,
I'm nobody's puppet.

646
00:38:42,635 --> 00:38:46,126
They should've thought of that
before delivering yesterday's update.

647
00:38:47,226 --> 00:38:48,255
Good luck.

648
00:38:55,403 --> 00:38:56,928
Yesterday's update?

649
00:38:57,355 --> 00:38:59,485
I don't know
what she's talking about, sir.

650
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,456
We haven't had
a scheduled dial-out in days.

651
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,145
Could I have a moment alone, Amelia?

652
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,270
Yes, sir.

653
00:39:18,444 --> 00:39:20,023
I assume that you're responsible?

654
00:39:20,602 --> 00:39:22,816
Consider it a going-away present.

655
00:39:24,024 --> 00:39:25,028
Thank you.

656
00:39:27,857 --> 00:39:28,903
Alrighty.

657
00:39:29,357 --> 00:39:32,862
Here we are,
all fixed up and ready to roll.

658
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:35,496
What happens
when you reach your destination?

659
00:39:35,656 --> 00:39:36,803
Destination?

660
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:39,511
You're talking to the AI,
aren't you?

661
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:43,420
I'll start the process
that will give life to the Sekkari,

662
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:46,716
and then I'll go to sleep
until a time when I'm needed again.

663
00:39:51,796 --> 00:39:54,348
I realize it may have been
an unpleasant experience...

664
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,309
Yeah, well, just a little bit.

665
00:39:57,029 --> 00:39:59,604
- What... you can see her too?
- And I want you to know

666
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,731
I'm sorry for what
you had to go through.

667
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,754
The Apollo is ready to beam.

668
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:10,656
The ship will take you
to your target planet.

669
00:40:11,304 --> 00:40:13,044
I don't mean to complain
or anything,

670
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:16,030
it's just I spent the day
making sure this was in working order.

671
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:19,048
It would be kind of nice
to just get a little face time with...

672
00:40:19,173 --> 00:40:20,457
Here you are, Dr. McKay...

673
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,239
The true form of the Sekkari.

674
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:29,589
Neat.

675
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:33,970
Good luck.

676
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:41,713
"Neat"?

677
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:44,449
What? I... She caught me off guard.
What did you want me to say?

678
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:47,093
- What would you have said?
- "Weird."

679
00:40:54,546 --> 00:40:56,347
Would you care to join us?

680
00:40:56,718 --> 00:40:59,276
Well, actually,
I have some reports to file...

681
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,011
Thank you.
I'd love to join you.

682
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,372
So, you really had no idea

683
00:41:09,497 --> 00:41:11,282
that what you were seeing
wasn't real?

684
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:12,407
Trust me,

685
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:15,722
the manifestations
were very convincing, Doctor.

686
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:17,180
You wouldn't have known.

687
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:19,754
With all due respect,
I think they knew they couldn't fool me,

688
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:21,940
so they, you know, didn't bother.

689
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,428
- They just concentrated on you two.
- You know what I don't get,

690
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:27,911
is the AI thing
revealed itself that morning,

691
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:30,183
you discover the device
that afternoon.

692
00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:32,153
I mean, that's perfect timing.

693
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:34,511
The Colonel's right.
That was very coincidental.

694
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:36,761
And I know what you're implying,
but my mind was clear.

695
00:41:36,886 --> 00:41:40,079
That device was found
because of my brilliant thinking

696
00:41:40,204 --> 00:41:43,087
and, as much as I hate to admit it,
a little help from Zelenka.

697
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:44,995
What?
Zelenka's off-world.

698
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,377
No, he's not.
He came back yesterday.

699
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:52,574
Lieutenant Donovan had a nasty reaction
to something he ate,

700
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:54,292
they came back early.

701
00:41:55,488 --> 00:41:56,615
Didn't they?

702
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:01,347
Son of a...

703
00:42:01,472 --> 00:42:04,027
Guess it wasn't that much
of coincidence after all.
