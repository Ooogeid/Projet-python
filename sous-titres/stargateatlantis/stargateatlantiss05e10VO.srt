1
00:00:01,064 --> 00:00:03,506
<i>Previously on </i>Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:05,842
So,
I understand you have a proposal.

3
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:09,429
We've come up with a gene therapy
that alters Wraith DNA.

4
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:11,848
We think we can make it so that you

5
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:14,100
will never need to feed
on humans again.

6
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:16,407
Here. Try this.

7
00:00:17,386 --> 00:00:18,894
His name was Janus.

8
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:22,025
Causality
is not to be treated so lightly.

9
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:24,338
- No one's treating it lightly.
- You are,

10
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,509
with your insistence
on continuing these experiments.

11
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:29,431
We ordered you
to cease these activities

12
00:00:33,848 --> 00:00:35,235
I don't know why all the fuss.

13
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:38,354
If we do this every time someone comes,
we'll never get any work done.

14
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:41,127
- We're just meeting him at the Gate.
- We're not just meeting him.

15
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:45,285
I've been pulled from my regular duties
to help him with his database research.

16
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:48,665
I've got stuff on the go, you know.
Important, vital projects

17
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:50,834
for the betterment of the human race.

18
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:54,079
Apparently there are other people
doing equally important work, Rodney,

19
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:55,725
as hard as that is to believe.

20
00:00:57,681 --> 00:00:59,885
- An exciting day.
- Absolutely.

21
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:04,095
- He's ready to beam.
- Very well.

22
00:01:06,908 --> 00:01:09,181
Dr. Jackson, welcome to Atlantis.

23
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:11,187
Thank you, Mr. Woolsey.
It's great to be back.

24

Season 5 Episode 10
First Contact (v. 1.00)

25
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:26,530
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

26
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,175
www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

27
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,227
I'll have Rodney here
show you to your quarters...

28
00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:41,822
I'd like to get started right away,
if that's okay with you, Rodney?

29
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:45,605
Sure, sure. What have you got planned?
An exploration of insignificant events?

30
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:48,759
- Not quite. You're familiar with Janus?
- The inventor?

31
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,205
Yes, he was the lead scientist
and apparently a renegade.

32
00:01:51,325 --> 00:01:54,724
And I've been over all his logs.
Look, this is work we've done already.

33
00:01:54,844 --> 00:01:57,597
I'm sure I have information
that could lead us to his secret lab.

34
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:58,805
Secret lab?

35
00:01:59,574 --> 00:02:03,334
A place where he conducted and hid
a portion of his unauthorized research.

36
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:06,045
And if I'm correct,
it's right here...

37
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:07,529
On Atlantis.

38
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:15,034
I've been over Janus' database entries
with a fine-tooth comb.

39
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:17,665
- I never saw any mention of a lab.
- Janus was doing a lot of work

40
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:19,974
that wasn't exactly approved
by the Ancient council,

41
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:23,999
so he wouldn't include a full accounting
in this very public database.

42
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:26,649
Do you include your research
in your reports?

43
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:28,419
Just get to the point.

44
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:32,070
He never talked about it in his entries,
but Janus' peers suspected he had

45
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:34,866
a "bastion of unfettered thought
and experimentation,"

46
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:37,034
- or as one of his lovers put it...
- He had lovers?

47
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:39,287
"An isle of solitude
within the City walls."

48
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:42,163
He was hard to talk to.
People say things like that about me.

49
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:46,169
They had no idea where the lab could be,
but one assistant recalls a day where

50
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:49,595
- he turned a corner down a hallway.
- "Today I saw Janus in the hallway... "

51
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:52,662
- there's a real page-turner.
- But when he rounded the corner,

52
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,851
Janus was gone.
The hallway was a dead end.

53
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:57,680
He had seemingly disappeared,
I think, into his secret lab.

54
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:01,601
- Did he happen to mention...
- Which hallway? Yes. He does.

55
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:11,285
As soon as the Daedalus
unloads its supplies,

56
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:13,764
we'll be heading off to meet
up with Todd and one of his hives.

57
00:03:13,884 --> 00:03:15,534
You really think
he's going to show up?

58
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,291
And let you guys try out Dr. Keller's
gene therapy on a few of his guys?

59
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:20,828
Well, we held up
our end of the deal.

60
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,415
We let him use Teyla to take control
of an alliance of Wraith hives.

61
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:25,977
He's got what he wants.

62
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:28,286
I should go with you,
I have a relationship with Todd...

63
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:31,208
That is precisely
why I don't want you there.

64
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:36,056
This mission is basically going to be
a negotiation, and Todd has...

65
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:39,410
less baggage with me
than he does with you.

66
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,779
I'm not saying you shouldn't take
the lead on this.

67
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:44,403
You're second in command here,
Colonel.

68
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:49,722
My predecessors played fast and loose
with the rules set forth by the IOA,

69
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:52,220
but protocol plainly states
that in the rare instance

70
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,235
where I am required to leave Atlantis,
you stay put.

71
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:58,156
You're in command here until I get back.
Understood?

72
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,746
- Try not to blow her up while I'm gone.
- No promises.

73
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:08,161
Yeah, I think this should be
the last of it.

74
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,673
I was just leaving.

75
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:14,153
Yeah, I know.

76
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:16,299
- Here, let me get that.
- Thanks.

77
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,260
So you're going
on this Daedalus thing?

78
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,093
Thank you.

79
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:24,970
I kind of have to. I'm the one
that'll be administering the treatment.

80
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,225
If, you know,
we ever get to that point.

81
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:28,152
Right.

82
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,584
I think I should
come with you on this.

83
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:32,781
Really? Why?

84
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:35,562
I don't really trust these guys.

85
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:39,349
You don't trust Todd and his Wraith
or the entire crew

86
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:42,661
of the Daedalus to protect me
if something goes wrong?

87
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:43,976
I don't know.

88
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:45,374
Both, I guess.

89
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:48,399
- What?
- Nothing.

90
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,897
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

91
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:52,219
It'd be great to have the company.

92
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:55,037
- Bye, Rodney. Wish us luck.
- Good luck.

93
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,221
What do you mean, "us"?

94
00:05:09,878 --> 00:05:11,267
Is that a water line up there?

95
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:13,482
This section of the City flooded
the first year.

96
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:15,724
Anything salvageable
got moved to the main tower.

97
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:17,319
It's remote.
That's promising.

98
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:20,222
He wouldn't want anyone around
when he came in and out of his lab.

99
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:21,741
Like the bat cave.

100
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,973
Yes... Just like the bat cave.

101
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:26,593
I'm not picking up
anything unusual...

102
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:31,208
Something used to be attached here.

103
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:33,721
And here...

104
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:35,455
And another one.

105
00:05:36,015 --> 00:05:37,297
Any idea what they are?

106
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:40,092
- Run-of-the-mill sconce interface.
- Right. Well,

107
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,510
- where are the sconces?
- I don't know.

108
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:44,346
Maybe the decorator
changed his mind.

109
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:49,345
You said anything worth salvaging
was moved to the main tower.

110
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:52,437
Now, tell me you kept detailed records
of what was found and where.

111
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:55,024
Did we keep detailed records?
Who are you talking to here?

112
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:08,037
There. That's the hallway.
Can you zoom in there?

113
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,658
There.
There are your light fixtures.

114
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:17,735
- Must have been knocked loose.
- Possibly.

115
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,507
- But you salvaged them, right?
- They're lights that fell...

116
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:23,768
Just humor me, okay?
I think we're onto something.

117
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:25,677
All right.

118
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:39,289
Here they are.

119
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:41,313
I've got'em.

120
00:06:58,312 --> 00:06:59,432
That's odd.

121
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,139
Each of these lights
made a different tone.

122
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,617
Does that usually happen
around here?

123
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:06,063
Not usually, no.

124
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:16,438
They've been underwater a few days.
Maybe they're just broken.

125
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,440
No, it's a puzzle.

126
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,651
I think we need to activate these
in a specific order.

127
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:23,079
A 3-digit code?
You know how easy that'd be to break?

128
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,487
There's only 6 variations.

129
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:26,911
Maybe activate them a number
of times in a specific order.

130
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:29,076
I don't suppose you recognize
these three notes?

131
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:31,652
Does it remind me of Janus' favorite
Brian Eno track?

132
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:33,184
No. No such luck.

133
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:35,814
Janus' assistant said 
he disappeared pretty quickly,

134
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:37,713
so it can't be a long code.

135
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,170
Maybe it's as simple
as 3 tones in a row.

136
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:41,904
Go for it.

137
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:08,865
- Hold on for a second.
- What is it?

138
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,036
- Come here and push against this wall.
- Why?

139
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:15,261
Please. Just humor me.
I think I'm on to something.

140
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:17,566
Okay, on the count of three,

141
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:20,116
push against the wall
as hard as you can, okay?

142
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:23,630
Okay. One...
Two...

143
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:25,150
Three...

144
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,209
Son of a bitch.

145
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:44,446
Controlled magnetic
harmonic resonance.

146
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,932
What?

147
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:49,861
Tesla was close to something like this
before Edison trashed his lab.

148
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:52,409
- What are you talking about?
- That wall was specially designed

149
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:55,377
to de-stabliize when bombarded
with a very specific harmonic resonance.

150
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:56,774
That's what the tones were.

151
00:08:56,894 --> 00:08:59,077
And the strong magnetic property
of the particles

152
00:08:59,197 --> 00:09:00,991
keeps the door
from crumbling into dust.

153
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:04,921
It's a great way to hide a door,
if you're looking for a door to open,

154
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:06,541
it's never going to be found.

155
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:08,842
It's like a hologram, only better,

156
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:11,094
because it's solid mass
until the tones are playing.

157
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:13,408
So you could have just told me
to walk through the door.

158
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:15,735
- I could have, yes.
- Yes, yes.

159
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,825
Where the hell are we?

160
00:09:39,138 --> 00:09:40,545
Janus' secret lab.

161
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:19,623
Alert the others.
The device has been activated.

162
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,022
Where is your burly protector?

163
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,344
It's odd to see you
without him nowadays.

164
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:51,361
He's in the lab.
What are you working on?

165
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,522
- A speech.
- What for?

166
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:57,533
Well, this is a fairly
momentous occasion.

167
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:00,641
The Wraith will take a step forward,
not only for their own benefit,

168
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,622
but for that of the entire galaxy.

169
00:11:03,118 --> 00:11:04,623
It's a historic day.

170
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,002
I just think
it deserves some recognition.

171
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:10,670
What have you got so far?

172
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:14,533
"Today is an historic day."

173
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:18,653
It's a good place to start.

174
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:21,484
Well, it's a work in progress.

175
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:34,325
That's pretty cool.

176
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,590
- Harmonic resonance.
- Yeah, I was told.

177
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,797
But what happens
if the sound goes off

178
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:41,868
- and you're in the middle of the wall?
- The wall would break apart your body.

179
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:43,021
Maybe we should...

180
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:45,241
I've set up a sub-sonic
tone generator outside.

181
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:47,846
The wall is now permanently open.
Don't worry.

182
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,234
Good.
So, what have we got?

183
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:52,426
The good news is
it's definitely his secret lab.

184
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,534
The bad news is
getting in was the easy part.

185
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,862
There are levels of encryption
on all data here

186
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,532
that even the most paranoid
NSA agent wouldn't use.

187
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,771
I mean, it is deep.

188
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:04,095
Some are straight-up math ciphers,
while others are Ancient puzzles.

189
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:07,937
And until we start deciphering,
no way to tell what of this stuff does.

190
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:10,698
Sounds like you guys
make a good team, though.

191
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:16,964
Well, I guess I'll go back
to being the boss.

192
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:19,365
- How's that going?
- Pretty boring, actually.

193
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:22,201
You're more than welcome
to help us crack this first cipher.

194
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:24,821
You know,
he could have been in Mensa.

195
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:31,424
Why don't you contact me when
you two geniuses have a breakthrough.

196
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:32,551
Will do.

197
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:54,080
Sir, we're being hailed.

198
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,501
Open a channel.

199
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:57,547
This is Colonel Caldwell
of the Daedalus.

200
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,617
We're ready
to receive your delegation.

201
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:02,111
<i>The delegation is on their way.</i>

202
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,924
Marks, you have the bridge.

203
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,132
I'm going to meet our guests.

204
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,961
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having us.

205
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:44,992
Today is an historic day.

206
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,868
Robert Grosseteste once said...

207
00:13:47,988 --> 00:13:50,372
I would like to get started
as soon as possible.

208
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,960
Yes, of course.
But I wanted to recognize...

209
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,254
I have my doubts
that your plan will be effective.

210
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,760
So shall we drop these unfounded
pleasantries and get to work?

211
00:14:06,216 --> 00:14:07,278
Very well.

212
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:10,575
Dr. Keller, lead the way.

213
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:12,770
Please, come with me.

214
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:25,282
- Robert who?
- Never mind.

215
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:48,055
You know, it's almost dawn.
If you want to call it a night...

216
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:50,219
What? No, no, no, I'm fine, fine.

217
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,191
But if you need to rest,
I'll completely understand.

218
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:57,564
Seriously, is everything
a competition with you?

219
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:00,344
I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

220
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:03,067
I just found you a secret lab
full of really cool Ancient stuff.

221
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:05,028
That should score me
some points here.

222
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:07,908
Okay, I will admit that I may
have been a little brusque with you.

223
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:09,535
- Just a little.
- The truth is,

224
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:12,458
I really didn't think
you would have found anything.

225
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,748
Well, that much
I actually understand.

226
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:17,669
- You do?
- Yeah.

227
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:21,157
I've spent the majority
of my professional life

228
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:24,585
being ridiculed for my theories,
most of which turned out to be correct,

229
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:27,327
by the way.
I'm kind of used to it, Rodney.

230
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:31,533
Doesn't that bother you?

231
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:35,117
I mean, no vindication,
no recognition, no credit...

232
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:37,604
I could say the same thing
about you.

233
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:39,783
The discoveries you've made,

234
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:42,317
you probably could've won
the Nobel Prize five times over by now.

235
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:44,712
Too true.

236
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,000
So, I guess none of us signed up
to get famous, huh?

237
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,533
No, we did it for the money.

238
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:52,345
Good one.

239
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:57,377
Wait a minute... You don't get paid
more than I do, do you?

240
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,432
Do you?

241
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,486
Hyperspace window just opened.

242
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:16,847
Daedalus isn't due back yet.

243
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:24,367
Get Sheppard.

244
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:28,220
<i>Colonel Sheppard, sir?</i>

245
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,370
Yeah, just resting my eyes.

246
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:32,963
Who said that?

247
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:34,870
<i>I patched into the PA
in your room, sir.</i>

248
00:16:35,504 --> 00:16:37,891
You're gonna want to get up here.

249
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,305
What's going on?

250
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:57,636
We're tracking a small ship,
in atmosphere. It's coming right for us.

251
00:16:57,756 --> 00:17:00,097
- Get the Jumpers in the air.
- It's closing fast, sir.

252
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:01,835
It'll be here
in less than 10 seconds.

253
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:05,537
Shields up.
I still want the Jumpers ready.

254
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,162
Here it comes...

255
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:22,958
That's impossible.

256
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:25,594
- What did it just do?
- It passed through the shield.

257
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:27,494
Yeah, but how did it do that?

258
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,038
I'm not sure, sir.

259
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:31,635
Ancient ships can do it.

260
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:37,801
All right, tell Teyla and a team
of marines to meet me at that pier.

261
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:13,385
They should be
right in front of you.

262
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:25,546
Don't move!

263
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,666
- What's at the bottom of this tower?
- Rodney.

264
00:18:53,961 --> 00:18:56,078
Rodney, this is Sheppard.
Come in.

265
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:57,637
- <i>Rodney!</i>
- What's up?

266
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,806
Get out of there right now.

267
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:01,392
Why?

268
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:12,295
Control room, what's the status
of that ship?

269
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:14,380
I'm sorry, Colonel.

270
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:16,793
They're gone.

271
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,979
- Is it alive?
- You tell me.

272
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,551
I'm not getting
any coherent readings.

273
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:42,606
Perhaps we should put it
under a medical scanner.

274
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:44,725
- Okay, do it.
- Go get a gurney.

275
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:49,540
So is it true
they took Rodney and Dr. Jackson?

276
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:52,306
Yeah.

277
00:20:57,326 --> 00:21:00,091
- What the hell happened?
- We were attacked.

278
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:02,401
That much I got, thanks.

279
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:05,292
- By who?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

280
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:07,729
Okay, there is no way
this is a coincidence.

281
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,046
We discover Janus' super-secret lab,

282
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,291
and less than 24 hours later, a bunch
of aliens show up, all guns blazing?

283
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:15,307
Don't think that's a little odd?

284
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:17,309
Now that you mention it...

285
00:21:22,902 --> 00:21:25,130
They knew exactly
what they were looking for.

286
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,547
Didn't waste any time,
went straight for the lab.

287
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:30,638
When they came out,
one of them was carrying a device.

288
00:21:35,318 --> 00:21:37,224
Unfortunately,
we haven't had nearly enough time

289
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:39,248
to go through everything
we found in here,

290
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:41,843
so there's no way of knowing
exactly what they took.

291
00:21:42,912 --> 00:21:45,680
All this stuff came on when
Rodney and Dr. Jackson came in here.

292
00:21:46,078 --> 00:21:47,099
Pretty much.

293
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:50,309
It activated probably in response
to Rodney's ATA gene. Why?

294
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,396
What if something in here
has been broadcasting?

295
00:21:54,352 --> 00:21:56,315
A subspace signal...
The only possible answer.

296
00:21:56,475 --> 00:21:58,483
- What?
- We've come across them before.

297
00:21:58,644 --> 00:22:01,237
They're a real-time, instantaneous link
between two Ancient devices.

298
00:22:01,357 --> 00:22:03,312
They can be separated
by half a galaxy.

299
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:04,978
There's a bunch of aliens out there.

300
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:08,416
They stumble upon an Ancient lab,
probably built by Janus himself.

301
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,078
It's dormant.
It's not working.

302
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,414
Then one day, out of the blue,
it activates.

303
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:14,229
So they're standing around.

304
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:16,669
No idea what's going on.
They discover the subspace link.

305
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,005
They decide to follow it,
they trace it back to us.

306
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:21,485
And then attack us
and take two of our people hostage?

307
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:23,526
Rodney and Dr. Jackson
were not the targets.

308
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:25,166
The wrong place,
the wrong time.

309
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:28,264
Whatever that device was,
that's what they were after.

310
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:31,229
All right, good theory.
So what do we do?

311
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,908
We've gotta get out of here.

312
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:35,017
We're traveling through hyperspace.
Where do we go?

313
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:36,696
- I'll think of something.
- Really?

314
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:37,892
Always do.

315
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:40,948
I tried that.
They zap you when you touch them.

316
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,048
You could told me that
before I touched it.

317
00:22:43,168 --> 00:22:44,488
I could have, yes.

318
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:49,168
They stripped us of everything but
the clothing, surrounded us with lasers.

319
00:22:49,288 --> 00:22:52,479
- I'm not sure how much play we have.
- We've got one thing going for us.

320
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,706
- What's that?
- We're not dead yet.

321
00:22:56,344 --> 00:22:57,375
Good point.

322
00:23:04,168 --> 00:23:05,285
It's no good.

323
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:09,856
I'm still not getting
any useful readings.

324
00:23:10,215 --> 00:23:12,668
The suit is emitting
some sort of EM field

325
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:14,770
that's disrupting the scanner.

326
00:23:15,016 --> 00:23:16,605
I have no idea how to shut it off.

327
00:23:16,725 --> 00:23:18,859
No way to penetrate the shield
and see what's under?

328
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:20,171
I'm afraid not.

329
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,567
Do you think there's a human
underneath all that armor?

330
00:23:22,728 --> 00:23:24,361
Impossible to say.
Could be a robot.

331
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:27,345
One thing's for sure... It's not
like anything we've ever seen before.

332
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:30,658
Dr. Weir did say that there were
other technologically advanced societies

333
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:34,169
- that we have yet to encounter.
- We've just made first contact.

334
00:23:36,163 --> 00:23:37,817
What do you want me to do?

335
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:41,969
Cut it open.

336
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:58,228
Ah, it's no good.
I just dulled the blade.

337
00:23:58,974 --> 00:23:59,855
The neck.

338
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:01,671
- What?
- Looks like the softest part.

339
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,085
Try the neck.

340
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,611
- It's already dead, Radek.
- We think.

341
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:06,946
Just do it.

342
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:19,028
It's working!

343
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:30,246
Get out. Everyone, get out!

344
00:24:40,843 --> 00:24:41,855
Everyone okay?

345
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,120
Yes.

346
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:47,994
Somebody really wants to keep secret
whatever's inside that suit.

347
00:24:53,068 --> 00:24:56,646
We've run close to a hundred
simulations based on full medical scans

348
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:59,393
of the Wraith
we've had in captivity.

349
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,283
- They've all been successful.
- We both know very well

350
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:07,631
that computer simulations
and live trials are very different.

351
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,471
I don't think
we're doing this cavalierly.

352
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:13,722
I stand by the data.
It will work.

353
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,685
Perhaps it will.

354
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,373
The question is, do you want it to?

355
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,780
I do see the benefits.

356
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:36,609
Even if we only used the therapy
on some of my troops...

357
00:25:36,729 --> 00:25:40,626
Say, those whose lives, thanks
to this war, are expected to be short.

358
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:44,167
Why waste perfectly
good resources on them, yes?

359
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,573
But it will be very difficult for me
to ask those around me

360
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:53,205
to give themselves over
for the good of the human race.

361
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,178
But it's for your benefit too.

362
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:58,628
If you don't have to rely
on human feeding,

363
00:25:58,748 --> 00:26:00,309
the war would be over.

364
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:01,973
Perhaps...

365
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,222
But then what would we do?

366
00:26:08,406 --> 00:26:09,698
Who would we be?

367
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:50,978
Can we talk to somebody in charge?
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

368
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:53,478
There's no need
to treat us this way...

369
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:06,475
- Get the device operational.
- I don't even know what it is!

370
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,005
Oh, great.

371
00:27:12,236 --> 00:27:14,889
It's sealed shut, and they've removed
the door controls from this side.

372
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,682
Where they hell are we?

373
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:19,804
Judging by the lantian architecture,
I'd guess, you know,

374
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:21,393
secret Janus facility.

375
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:24,434
Which is probably bad for us, because
it probably means it's hard to find.

376
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,705
So I guess that means
no rescue any time soon.

377
00:27:32,426 --> 00:27:34,015
Does that look familiar to you?

378
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah, it's the device
from the Atlantis lab.

379
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,733
At least we know
why they brought us.

380
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:39,985
They need us to get the device
operational. Caught that.

381
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,536
Right, and I don't think we'll get info
from talky McSays-a-lot out there,

382
00:27:44,024 --> 00:27:46,147
so fire up these consoles,
see what we're dealing with.

383
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:47,453
Not like that.

384
00:27:47,785 --> 00:27:49,757
Let's see.
Yeah, like that.

385
00:27:51,062 --> 00:27:52,972
And then I need to be
right there, yep.

386
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:54,172
Thanks. There.

387
00:27:56,729 --> 00:27:59,904
We've got five Jumpers in the air flying
a defensive formation around the City

388
00:28:00,024 --> 00:28:02,563
and have the Chair fired up
and ready for you at a moment's notice.

389
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:04,932
I want marine details every five levels,
locked and loaded,

390
00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:07,528
- ready for my go-ahead, just in case.
- Absolutely.

391
00:28:07,648 --> 00:28:09,688
Colonel, I think
I may have something.

392
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,954
I've been working
under the assumption

393
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:15,275
that the device they took broadcasted
some subspace communication.

394
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:16,584
You can trace it?

395
00:28:16,772 --> 00:28:18,863
Yeah, if it was broadcasting
from Atlantis, yes.

396
00:28:18,983 --> 00:28:21,026
But obviously
it's not doing that anymore.

397
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:22,450
- So...
- So...

398
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:25,286
I'm using the work of Laszlo Babai
as a stepping stone.

399
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:28,189
You know, combinatorics and...

400
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:31,102
No offense, but the math I'm using
is so complicated

401
00:28:31,222 --> 00:28:33,497
I don't know if I can
dumb it enough for it to make sense.

402
00:28:33,617 --> 00:28:34,462
Try.

403
00:28:35,354 --> 00:28:37,778
I've been going over
our recorded subspace logs

404
00:28:37,898 --> 00:28:39,882
and I'm trying to extrapolate
the single thread

405
00:28:40,002 --> 00:28:42,429
that will lead us to the area of space
associated with the device.

406
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:45,886
- Well, I understand that.
- Doesn't accurately represent what...

407
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:48,289
I get it.
What you're doing is difficult.

408
00:28:48,706 --> 00:28:50,599
Just tell me when you get a hit.

409
00:29:02,394 --> 00:29:05,218
This facility is tapped into
some pretty serious power generation.

410
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:08,434
- Never seen anything like it before.
- You'd need a lot of power...

411
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,032
What?

412
00:29:10,227 --> 00:29:12,414
I think I know what this thing does.

413
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,711
- What?
- It's an endgame machine.

414
00:29:15,595 --> 00:29:17,547
- How so?
- If it works the way I think it does,

415
00:29:17,707 --> 00:29:20,300
it would mean the end of the Wraith
once and for all.

416
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:26,722
So how do you destroy the Wraith
once and for all?

417
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:29,344
I never said "destroy."
It would lead to that, I suppose,

418
00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:31,896
but this device
would stop them dead in their tracks.

419
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:32,812
How?

420
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:34,897
It creates a very specific
subspace static...

421
00:29:35,494 --> 00:29:37,290
Turbulence is a better way
of looking at it.

422
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,258
- Which...
- Okay, look.

423
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:42,394
Although they're all based on
a fairly similar technological premise,

424
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:45,183
each race has
a slightly different type of hyperdrive.

425
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:47,334
Ours are based on the Asgard drives.

426
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:51,019
The Ancients had their own,
the Wraith have their own technology.

427
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:52,878
- All right.
- So at its base level,

428
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:56,272
a hyperdrive allows you to travel
by entering and exiting subspace.

429
00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:59,718
- Okay, this much I already know, yes.
- Okay, so, if this machine

430
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:02,592
is capable of actually
functioning safely,

431
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:06,137
it disrupts the very specific
subspace frequencies the Wraith use.

432
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,838
So they couldn't use hyperdrives.

433
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:09,881
That's the genius...
They would be able to.

434
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:12,738
It's just that their particular channel
of subspace would be destabilized

435
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:14,462
and the ship would be ripped.

436
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:17,762
Every time a Wraith ship
enters hyperspace, it self-destructs?

437
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,274
- Yeah.
- Pretty effective.

438
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:23,825
Because even if word got back
that they should stop using hyperdrives,

439
00:30:23,945 --> 00:30:26,711
they'd be stuck where they were.
They could only travel using sublight.

440
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:29,396
Because Ancient ships' hyperdrives
operated on a different frequency,

441
00:30:29,516 --> 00:30:31,496
the Ancients could
pick them off one by one.

442
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:34,749
Yeah, or just leave them to die
in the vastness of space.

443
00:30:34,964 --> 00:30:36,147
So, what's the catch?

444
00:30:36,564 --> 00:30:38,863
The catch is that Janus ran

445
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:41,422
a three-day test about 10,000 years ago

446
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:45,440
and then shut the whole project down
because of "unforeseen side effects".

447
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,906
Right, which were?

448
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:48,599
Well, it's not clear.

449
00:30:49,377 --> 00:30:51,192
But that's the key to the whole shebang.

450
00:30:51,312 --> 00:30:55,127
Janus brought that back to Atlantis
but kept it connected here.

451
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:58,067
- One won't work without the other.
- They think we can make it operational.

452
00:30:58,187 --> 00:31:01,234
Cause we can. We've everything we need.
The question is whether we should.

453
00:31:01,935 --> 00:31:05,002
The last time I went down this road,
I kinda destroyed a solar system.

454
00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:08,241
And I'm not too keen about experiencing
those "unforeseen side effects".

455
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:10,910
- So what do we do?
- It's simple.

456
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:13,663
We reason with them?

457
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,886
Obviously you're excited about ending
the Wraith's reign once and for all.

458
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,050
But the reality is
this device and this facility

459
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,331
were abandoned by their creator
for a very good reason.

460
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:31,074
See... it doesn't work...

461
00:31:31,443 --> 00:31:32,760
At least not safely.

462
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,322
That's from what my friend can tell.

463
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:39,522
Look, we share the same goal.

464
00:31:40,002 --> 00:31:42,400
Perhaps we have many things in common.

465
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:49,631
Look, given the right amount of time,
we could get the device to function,

466
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:53,634
but we'd have to contact our people
and bring in a much larger science team.

467
00:31:53,754 --> 00:31:56,747
See, I'm not that kinda scientist,
and my friend here...

468
00:31:57,126 --> 00:32:00,082
Get the device operational
within one hour

469
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:01,794
or I will kill him.

470
00:32:02,443 --> 00:32:03,835
Do you understand?

471
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,213
I understand. Yes.

472
00:32:09,988 --> 00:32:12,200
Great plan, Danny.
Great plan.

473
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,550
Why the suits?

474
00:32:15,362 --> 00:32:17,687
Well, they're not in battle anymore.

475
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:22,188
I thought it was their SWAT gear,
but they still have it on.

476
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:25,601
Maybe they're more than just armor.
Some sort of protective suit.

477
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:28,782
Maybe they can't function
in our livable atmosphere.

478
00:32:28,902 --> 00:32:32,297
We should add it to the list of things
that have nothing to do with the task.

479
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,369
Those suits might be the key to
figuring out who these guys really are.

480
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:39,247
Well, you work on understanding them.
I work on trying not to get us killed.

481
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:49,837
- You got something for me?
- Yes. There.

482
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:52,343
M6H-987.
That's my best guess.

483
00:32:52,984 --> 00:32:55,057
- Are you sure?
- Well, about 80% sure.

484
00:32:55,177 --> 00:32:57,559
All right, it's our only lead.
I'll have to do.

485
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,873
- Doesn't have a Gate on it, does it?
- No.

486
00:32:59,993 --> 00:33:01,069
Of course not.

487
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:03,945
- Daedalus still out of range?
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.

488
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,753
Their rendezvous point with Todd
isn't even near a Stargate.

489
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:10,850
Get to the Jumper bay, boost its
communications range as much as you can.

490
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,764
- What are you planning?
- We've got to get to that planet.

491
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:16,575
We'll gate as near as we can
to the Daedalus with a Jumper,

492
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,998
have them pick us up en route
to the planet.

493
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:21,979
- Give me half an hour.
- I'm gonna get the team ready.

494
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:26,875
That main chamber
houses the subspace antenna.

495
00:33:26,995 --> 00:33:30,270
- It harnesses the static into subspace.
- It will once I light it up.

496
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:33,302
- What? You're already ready?
- Well, it wasn't broken.

497
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:35,818
He just shut it down.
All you need is that,

498
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:38,079
a basic understanding
of Janus' coding style,

499
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:41,935
and here's where I come in again,
the Ancient gene. We're ready to roll.

500
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:43,771
Rodney, you don't have to do this.

501
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:45,006
What?

502
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:48,888
If turning this on means a solar system
is gonna explode, then let's not.

503
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:51,320
- They'll kill you. We have no choice.
- Yes, we do.

504
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:54,686
I do nothing, they come, they kill you.
Who gets killed next ? Me.

505
00:33:54,806 --> 00:33:58,270
To tell you the truth, I'm fond of me,
so might as well do it, you know, now

506
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,761
while you're still alive
as opposed to, you know, then.

507
00:34:04,572 --> 00:34:05,500
All right.

508
00:34:06,372 --> 00:34:07,542
All right.

509
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:27,791
You still alive?

510
00:34:28,195 --> 00:34:29,282
I think so.

511
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:31,592
I'd hate to think
Heaven looks like this.

512
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,084
Who says we went to Heaven?

513
00:34:40,332 --> 00:34:41,752
It's operational.

514
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:45,301
Anything out of the ordinary?

515
00:34:45,971 --> 00:34:48,539
No. Everything is in the green.
I mean, it's working great.

516
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,664
What about those
"unforeseen side effects"?

517
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:53,923
They're still unforeseen.
It's working, and we're still alive.

518
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:55,550
Okay, so, what now?

519
00:34:56,265 --> 00:34:59,721
Maybe... a nice pat on the back and an
all-expense-paid trip back to Atlantis?

520
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:15,416
You have an urgent message
from your hive.

521
00:35:15,536 --> 00:35:17,957
I assumed you'd want
to take it privately.

522
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:24,917
Go ahead.

523
00:35:30,402 --> 00:35:31,462
Very well.

524
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:33,755
Permission granted.

525
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,403
I shall remain here.

526
00:35:37,246 --> 00:35:38,719
Is everything okay?

527
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:42,344
One of our facilities is under attack
by a rival hive.

528
00:35:43,113 --> 00:35:45,957
Our two support ships
must depart for battle.

529
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,092
My hive will remain here,

530
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:51,733
continue the work with Dr. Keller.

531
00:35:52,209 --> 00:35:53,820
I'm glad to hear that.

532
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,893
Oh, not the under attack part,
that's unfortunate, of course.

533
00:35:59,013 --> 00:36:00,031
I just meant...

534
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:03,492
Never mind.

535
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:23,722
- Marks, what the hell just happened?
- How did you do that?

536
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:27,099
How did we... Surely you don't think
we had anything to do with that.

537
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,394
- You've tricked me.
- What?

538
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,689
This was your plan all along.

539
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:36,818
Somehow, you've found
the attero device.

540
00:36:37,813 --> 00:36:39,946
The what? We have no idea
what you...

541
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:51,708
Commander,
we've been trying to contact you.

542
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:54,482
- <i>The other cruisers were destroyed.</i>
- I know.

543
00:36:54,602 --> 00:36:56,004
We've been betrayed.

544
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:57,881
What should we do?

545
00:36:58,678 --> 00:37:01,170
<i>I have control
of the humans' transport system.</i>

546
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,178
<i>I'll begin beaming in our troops
immediately.</i>

547
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:09,808
We're taking this ship.

548
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:30,493
Come on.

549
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:31,983
- What?
- We're under attack.

550
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:35,044
We got to get to the armory
and get you a gun. Come on.

551
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:00,804
Locked.

552
00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:03,346
Ronon!

553
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:10,801
We're locked in.

554
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:18,823
That should limit their movements.
Continue beaming in our troops.

555
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:28,881
10 minutes and counting.
Still no problem.

556
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:30,723
- Oh, boy...
- What? What is it?

557
00:38:31,104 --> 00:38:33,810
I think I just found a log entry
that tells what the side effect is.

558
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,000
It's not harmful radiation, is it?

559
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,112
We're safe. It's the rest of the galaxy
that's gonna have problems,

560
00:38:40,232 --> 00:38:42,360
including Atlantis.
I've got to shut this thing down.

561
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:47,056
Step away from the device.

562
00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:50,588
Okay, wait.
There's a very dangerous,

563
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:53,871
very serious problem with the device,
and we need to talk to your boss...

564
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:00,624
Okay, all set.

565
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,878
I'll have Chuck dial M5R-179.

566
00:39:02,998 --> 00:39:05,484
You should be able to contact
the Daedalus once you get there.

567
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:07,528
- Nice work.
- Thanks. Good luck.

568
00:39:07,648 --> 00:39:09,611
Thanks, we're gonna need it.

569
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:17,313
All right, dial up.

570
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:28,130
What's that?

571
00:39:29,507 --> 00:39:31,956
We've got a power spike
at the event horizon.

572
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:35,756
What? Power is building within the Gate?
No, no, no. That can't happen.

573
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:38,799
Colonel, do not lower the Jumper
into the Gate room.

574
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,293
- <i>Why not?</i>
- For some reason,

575
00:39:40,413 --> 00:39:43,026
there's an unprecedented
power build-up within the Gate.

576
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:45,128
Power build-up from where?

577
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:47,216
It's coming from within
the event horizon. Oh, no.

578
00:39:47,447 --> 00:39:49,677
- This is very, very bad for us.
- <i>Just shut it down.</i>

579
00:39:49,797 --> 00:39:51,627
It's probably a faulty Gate
at the other end.

580
00:39:51,938 --> 00:39:54,140
I'm... I'm trying.
It won't let me.

581
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,570
All right, I'm coming down.

582
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:02,817
What do we do,
wait 38 minutes and ride the puddle out?

583
00:40:02,937 --> 00:40:05,182
I wish. If the power continues
to build like this,

584
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,606
the Gate will reach critical overload
and explode.

585
00:40:07,726 --> 00:40:10,006
- Explode?!
- I told you it was very bad for us.

586
00:40:10,192 --> 00:40:12,534
- How does something like this happen?
- I don't know.

587
00:40:12,654 --> 00:40:15,411
- How long do we have?
- Not long at all. About 90 seconds.

588
00:40:15,572 --> 00:40:17,485
- 90 seconds?!
- I would say closer to 60.

589
00:40:17,605 --> 00:40:19,504
We've got to evacuate
everyone in the tower.

590
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:21,927
The Gate exploding is equivalent
to 12 nuclear explosions.

591
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:24,795
There's nowhere we could evacuate
quickly enough to a safe distance.

592
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,335
- The shield.
- What?

593
00:40:26,455 --> 00:40:29,044
Collapse the City's shield
around the Gate, contain the explosion.

594
00:40:29,164 --> 00:40:31,125
Yes, yes, that might just work.

595
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:35,380
The Gate will reach
a critical limit in five...

596
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Four...

597
00:40:36,627 --> 00:40:37,506
Three...

598
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:38,516
Two...

599
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,190
one.

600
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:44,576
- Don't look at the blast!
- Might have mentioned that before!

601
00:40:44,696 --> 00:40:46,974
I'll see if I can divert
more power to the shield,

602
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:49,319
see if I can block more
of the radiation...

603
00:40:58,092 --> 00:40:59,316
And now what?

604
00:41:02,691 --> 00:41:05,433
The shield continues to diffuse
the energy of the blast.

605
00:41:05,553 --> 00:41:08,631
Every second it's contained within
the shield, the explosion gets weaker.

606
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:10,658
How long does it take?

607
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:13,583
- Oh, no.
- What?

608
00:41:13,703 --> 00:41:16,304
The shield needs another minute
to contain the full brunt of the blast,

609
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:19,266
but we're frying out the emitters. Don't
know how much longer I can hold this.

610
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:22,311
- Shut down, transfer all the power.
- Yes, I'm trying.

611
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,148
Everyone that doesn't need to be here,
get to the edge of the City.

612
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:28,131
Move! Everybody!

613
00:41:29,102 --> 00:41:32,068
You're gonna want to get out of here.
Teyla, please.

614
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:44,320
Come on, you can do it, Radek.

615
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,009
It's going down.
We're gonna make it.

616
00:41:54,129 --> 00:41:54,917
No...

617
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:56,605
It's not enough.
