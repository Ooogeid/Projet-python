1
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:08,574
- Which planet is this again?
- M5V-801.

2
00:00:08,694 --> 00:00:10,395
The one with the frequent tremors.

3
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:12,675
Not to mention an abnormally high
amount of people with

4
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:15,465
- debilitating respiratory problems.
- It's a mining planet.

5
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:17,946
- It's not that surprising.
- Not everyone worked in the mines.

6
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:19,955
- Get to the point.
- They're experiencing

7
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:21,666
upwards of four tremors a day.

8
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:24,134
My seismic team has concluded
the area of their settlement

9
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:26,594
- is dangerously unstable.
- Not to mention my environmental

10
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:28,884
and air quality tests
came back way into the red.

11
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:31,076
My analysis was enough. Thank you.

12
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:33,245
Well, obviously,
it wasn't enough for them.

13
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:35,426
These people have said
they've experienced tremors

14
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:38,526
- for as long as they can remember.
- They've been breathing even longer,

15
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:40,595
so again, my problem trumps yours.

16
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,216
This not a contest.

17
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:45,205
They're living in a settlement
that's not safe for habitation.

18
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:48,335
You need to convince them to move
to another part of the continent.

19
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:50,476
Well, we tried. It's not working.

20
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:51,500
Why not?

21
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:54,767
20 years ago, the Genii
kind of took over the planet,

22
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:56,624
employed them all as miners.

23
00:00:56,744 --> 00:00:58,395
- Mining what?
- Haven't a clue.

24
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:00,772
Whatever it was,
they cleaned out the deposits and left.

25
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:01,965
So?

26
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:04,484
So, they think we're like the Genii,
and they want their cut.

27
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:08,225
They're willing to move,
but they have a list of demands

28
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:09,654
a mile and a half long.

29
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:11,415
And negotiating with alien settlements

30
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:13,307
is not exactly why
I joined the Air Force.

31
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:15,412
<i>We were hoping if you had some time...</i>

32
00:01:15,572 --> 00:01:18,065
You'd save us a lot of time
in the back and forth.

33
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:20,250
I'll free up my afternoon.

34
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:22,168
Appreciate that, Colonel.

35
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:24,580
Jennifer, Rodney.

36
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:27,576
<i>I'll meet you
at the Gate in one hour.</i>

37
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:29,765
I was rather hoping
you'd go by yourself,

38
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:31,302
- and I wouldn't...
- One hour.

39
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,715
Man...

40
00:01:48,214 --> 00:01:50,415
I got to start doing more cardio.

41
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,038
All this...

42
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:54,617
back and forth is getting me winded.

43
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:59,015
- We couldn't have taken the Jumper?
- Oh, suck it up. It's not that bad.

44
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:00,895
I have to hike this much
almost every day.

45
00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:03,276
- You do?
- Yeah, I'm a very active person.

46
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:04,198
You are?

47
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:06,576
Your last physical
would kind of contradict you.

48
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:08,476
That is private medical information

49
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,304
that should not be so cavalierly shared

50
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:12,336
in casual conversation, Doctor.

51
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:14,585
I don't think it comes
as a great surprise

52
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:17,174
- to the Colonel.
- That's not the point! I'm no Ronon.

53
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:19,723
I'm not going to be on the cover of
Shape Magazine anytime soon,

54
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:22,875
but I can handle myself in combat...
stay on my ground when I need to...

55
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,142
- Rodney!
- Don't move.

56
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:30,304
Get down on your stomach,
spread out your weight.

57
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:32,758
Rodney?

58
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:34,657
Are you all right?

59
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,537
- Oh, thank God.
- Don't move, okay?

60
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:41,226
Not a problem.

61
00:02:42,126 --> 00:02:44,584
We're going to head back to the Gate,
try to get some help.

62
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:46,609
Just try to stay as still...

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,234
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

71
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:04,562
Don't move...

72
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:06,896
 if you feel any shooting pains.

73
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:09,624
I would never move
if that was the case.

74
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,925
Well, it doesn't look like
any of us are bleeding.

75
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:17,583
At least externally.

76
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,527
That's a Godsend.

77
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:29,852
This whole place is a tetanus shot
waiting to happen.

78
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:35,524
In fact, where the hell are we?

79
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:38,066
I'd guess the Genii mining facility.

80
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,950
Just don't build 'em
like they used to, huh?

81
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,008
I am particularly not fond
of the ceiling work.

82
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,291
If this is part of a larger facility...

83
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:52,050
Then there should be a way
for us walk out of here. Right.

84
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:04,009
A little help here?

85
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:09,062
- What about this one?
- Well, red means bad.

86
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,816
Can't argue with that logic.

87
00:05:16,854 --> 00:05:18,143
Did you see this?

88
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:21,374
That's not going to budge
unless we enter the right code.

89
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:23,826
Look, these symbols
are Genii numerals.

90
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:26,485
Yeah, but...
You can crack the code, though, right?

91
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:28,897
- Would be a lot easier...
- ... if it was electronic.

92
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:30,906
- Like he say's.
- Like she say's.

93
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:33,252
<i>- It's not impossible, though, right?
- No, no...</i>

94
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,815
It's just...
highly, highly unlikely.

95
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,550
Okay, so...
door number two?

96
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,225
After you, Monty.

97
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:52,846
On three.

98
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,035
One... two... three.

99
00:05:58,556 --> 00:06:00,153
There goes that plan.

100
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:02,567
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

101
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:13,188
Okay, three?
One, two, three... go!

102
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:21,003
<i>Wait.</i>

103
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:23,826
What if...

104
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:27,000
What if that door
was sealed for a reason.

105
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:28,308
<i>What?</i>

106
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:30,518
You think maybe there's
a scary monster back there?

107
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:33,534
No, but this is a mining facility,

108
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:36,399
and who knows what kind
of toxins are in there.

109
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:40,278
Like you said, "red means bad."

110
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:47,076
I'm willing to take the chance.

111
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:10,850
I guess in Genii red means "screwed."

112
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:16,768
Okay.

113
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:26,316
Okay, look, it's...

114
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:28,601
We've been in the field
for, what, half an hour?

115
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:31,214
We've got another five
before we need to check in,

116
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:34,323
So the safest thing for us to do
is just...

117
00:07:34,697 --> 00:07:36,337
<i>sit tight and wait.</i>

118
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:39,378
<i>When we don't check in,
they'll send a team.</i>

119
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,506
Our radios should work down here?

120
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,240
Yeah, they should.

121
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:45,899
Okay, so, we...

122
00:07:47,388 --> 00:07:48,846
... we sit and wait.

123
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,368
Okay.

124
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,129
Anyone...

125
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:03,424
bring any cards?

126
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:06,023
No.

127
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,034
Tremor!

128
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:30,826
That sounded very, very bad.

129
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:35,228
What do you suppose the probability is

130
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,414
that this room is on
the same kind of metal stilts

131
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:39,490
as those other rooms we saw over there?

132
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:41,321
Very high.

133
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:44,725
But this one's more stable, right?

134
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:46,584
I mean, we're still standing.

135
00:08:46,704 --> 00:08:49,089
Yeah, but,
with the three of us and this dirt,

136
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,801
we've just added, what, 300, 400 pounds?

137
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:54,745
I'd say like 500.

138
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,016
Right.

139
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:59,250
And this region experiences
how many tremors a day?

140
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,043
Four times a day, at least.

141
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:06,841
What is it? What's wrong?

142
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:10,900
The supports that are stopping this room
from dropping into the chasm

143
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,764
are gonna rapidly destabilize now
that we've added all this extra weight.

144
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:19,351
Don't think we'll be able to wait for
Atlantis to figure out we're missing.

145
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:20,480
You're right.

146
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:23,022
We're going to have
to find a way out of here.

147
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:28,489
Well...

148
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:30,566
There are a lot of...

149
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:32,207
A lot of crates in here.

150
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:33,576
<i>Yeah, rickety, old ones.</i>

151
00:09:33,737 --> 00:09:35,884
I killed, like, three
of them on the way down.

152
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:37,811
But maybe we could
make, like, a pyramid,

153
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:39,498
stack them up, climb out.

154
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:42,328
- I don't think there's enough to...
- There are, actually.

155
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,551
Just barely enough to get us high enough
but we should be able to make it work.

156
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:47,488
You think it'll support our weight?

157
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:49,928
There's only one way to find out.

158
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:13,817
All right, look.

159
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:16,075
If we're actually going to do this,

160
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:18,410
I figure we need to stack these things,
like...

161
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,432
20 feet high in order to climb out,

162
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:22,100
so no matter how we build it,

163
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,626
it's going to be unstable.

164
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:26,789
Well, only one person has to climb it.

165
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,419
Oh, no, I'm kind of awful

166
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:38,742
with heights, so.

167
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:40,425
<i>So, Sam goes.</i>

168
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:42,436
What, you're not even gonna
consider yourself?

169
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:44,730
It's heights,
I'm probably worse than she is.

170
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,547
- Let's get started.
- All right, fine.

171
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:19,593
Maybe...

172
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:23,212
Maybe you should come down from there.
It sounds like it's...

173
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:40,814
Sam!

174
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,690
Easy, easy!

175
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,991
You okay?

176
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:48,862
Is she all right?

177
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:50,551
That was fun.

178
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:53,557
The bottom level won't hold. The crates
aren't strong enough to stack.

179
00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:55,051
Yeah, I got that, thanks.

180
00:11:55,806 --> 00:11:56,549
So?

181
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:07,563
We need another plan.

182
00:12:08,164 --> 00:12:09,244
And quick.

183
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:22,900
Hey, I got some files here.

184
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:26,179
Can anyone... Read Genii?

185
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,034
Hello, hello!

186
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,721
<i>- What have you got?</i>
- Grappling hook.

187
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:33,779
At least, something we can use
as a grappling hook.

188
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:34,756
<i>Great.</i>

189
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,412
Now all we need is some rope.

190
00:12:36,532 --> 00:12:38,052
Okay, just a sec... The ceiling is,

191
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:40,474
- like, what, 20 feet?
- 25?

192
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:44,578
All right, 25, so our jackets,
end-to-end are five or six feet,

193
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,447
tie those to our shirts...
Maybe even our pants together.

194
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,702
That should be able to get us up there
and support our weight.

195
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:52,712
Great.

196
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:01,030
Found rope!

197
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,583
<i>Rope and lanterns.</i>

198
00:13:05,473 --> 00:13:07,754
- Oh, good.
- More than enough for what we need.

199
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:08,666
Nice work.

200
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,239
Thank you.

201
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,402
What are you doing?

202
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:20,302
I'm going to tie the rope on
and toss it up there so you climb up.

203
00:13:20,463 --> 00:13:21,620
I can't do it.

204
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,880
- Quitter talk.
- No, I can't climb this.

205
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,142
This rope, it's too thin.
We need to tie knots in it.

206
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:29,353
- I need something to grip onto.
- Right. That's a lot of knots.

207
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,279
Well, we only need about 30 feet or so.

208
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:34,691
Okay, well,
you gals get started on the knotting,

209
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:37,291
and I'll read those files.

210
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:42,041
What? Look, they could contain
the code to the door there.

211
00:13:42,383 --> 00:13:44,918
Besides, three people can't knot
the same rope.

212
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:47,104
Unless either of you speak Genii?

213
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:49,220
Fine, we'll get started.

214
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:53,085
Well, want to play 20 questions?

215
00:13:54,218 --> 00:13:55,901
I'll let you go first.

216
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:57,566
Animal, vegetable or mineral?

217
00:13:57,686 --> 00:13:59,133
I'm good, thanks.

218
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:03,482
Well, here's a better one we can play.

219
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:06,090
Brad Pitt or George Clooney?

220
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:09,176
If you had to choose?

221
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:12,354
Clooney, I guess.

222
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,209
Pitt all the way.
Okay, you go.

223
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:17,868
Come on, it's easy.
Any two guys I would know.

224
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,153
Okay, okay.

225
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:23,532
Brian Greene or Neil Degrasse Tyson.

226
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:28,496
They're physicists.

227
00:14:29,882 --> 00:14:32,082
They're on tv.
I picked ones you should know.

228
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,003
Brian Greene, I guess.

229
00:14:36,955 --> 00:14:38,255
Tyson, all the way.

230
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,272
Are you talking about
Neil Degrasse Tyson?

231
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:42,647
He once stole an idea from me.
Did I tell you that story?

232
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:44,982
Only about a dozen times, McKay.

233
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,934
We're playing "who would you rather"?

234
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:49,392
Want to join us?

235
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:51,906
"Would you... "
sorry, I don't get it.

236
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:52,895
<i>Well, if...</i>

237
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:56,106
you had to choose who
to fool around with, would it be...

238
00:14:57,725 --> 00:14:59,318
Robert Redford or Paul Newman?

239
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:01,946
Uh, neither?

240
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,281
Yeah, I know, but if you had to.

241
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,692
If I had to?
So I'm...

242
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:09,081
to choose which of those guys
I would want to force

243
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,747
- themselves on me because...
<i>- It's just a dumb game, McKay.</i>

244
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:15,036
You're not secure enough in
your masculinity to play a dumb game?

245
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:16,685
Yes, well, I think I am, I just...

246
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:18,553
I should get back to my reading.
You know,

247
00:15:18,673 --> 00:15:20,651
the one thing
that could get us out of here.

248
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,347
- Newman.
- Absolutely. Not even a question.

249
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,680
- Shut up a sec.
- No, we're allowed to talk.

250
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,651
No, no, no.
I hear something...

251
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:33,497
There's someone up there.
Help!

252
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,813
We're stuck down here!
Hello?

253
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:39,483
What if the ceiling caves in on them?

254
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:41,380
We came thru' that section.
Eaten by rust.

255
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,392
- Rest of the ceiling looks fine.
- He's right.

256
00:15:43,512 --> 00:15:46,889
As long as they don't fall in the hole,
they should be able to get help. Hello!

257
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:48,775
Help!
We're stuck down here!

258
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:50,037
Can you hear us?

259
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:52,413
Hello?

260
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,646
Oh, thank God.

261
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,585
- Who are you?
<i>- We're visitors.</i>

262
00:15:57,745 --> 00:16:00,629
We were on our way to speak
to the people of your settlement.

263
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,923
You shouldn't be down there.

264
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,925
Yeah, we know, we fell down
here by accident.

265
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,922
You all okay?

266
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:09,215
We're fine. We're
just stuck. We need some help.

267
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,848
You shouldn't be down there.

268
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:12,808
Yeah, thanks, kid. Like I said...

269
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,594
Go tell your parents.

270
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:17,104
Tell them where we are,
that we're stuck and we need help.

271
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,941
I don't think we can do that.

272
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:22,818
What? Why not?

273
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:25,779
We're not really supposed
to play out here.

274
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,481
<i>If our parents find out...</i>

275
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:30,053
It's okay, I promise
you won't get into trouble.

276
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:31,466
You don't know my father.

277
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:32,853
He'll be very upset.

278
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:34,787
I'll explain the situation to him.

279
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:36,027
It'll be okay.

280
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:37,186
Please?

281
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:39,257
We're hurt.

282
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:40,377
We need help.

283
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,843
Wait a minute,
he said you were all okay.

284
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:43,963
I asked him.

285
00:16:44,124 --> 00:16:46,193
All right,
listen to me, you little brats!

286
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:48,135
<i>I am older than you and I am in charge.</i>

287
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:50,226
- Rodney...
- You will go back to your parents,

288
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:52,583
you will tell them we need help,
or so help me...

289
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:54,001
Do you need something?

290
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:56,035
<i>Anything. We can get it for you.</i>

291
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:58,700
<i>If you help us,
we'll get you whatever you want.</i>

292
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:01,947
- Oh, yes, good, great idea, yes.
- Thanks.

293
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,549
Maybe you should show them your...

294
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,655
- Excuse me?
- I was once a 10-year-old boy, too.

295
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,726
- I know what gets their attention.
- McKay...

296
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:09,913
What? Do want to get out
of here or not?

297
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:13,198
I think we can reason with them
without resorting to that, thank you.

298
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:14,717
If you say so.

299
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:21,599
We gotta go now. Bye!

300
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:22,419
<i>No!</i>

301
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,795
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

302
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,423
Good luck.

303
00:17:28,443 --> 00:17:30,774
- Would it have killed you to show...
- Drop it! McKay.

304
00:17:30,894 --> 00:17:32,446
It's not going to happen.

305
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:35,078
Four hours and 50 minutes.

306
00:17:36,777 --> 00:17:39,447
I'm warning you...
I mean, I could go crazy down here.

307
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,759
Ever since the whole Jumper
thing a couple of years ago,

308
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:43,445
I've been very bad with tight spaces.

309
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,114
Please. That's nothing. I was stuck

310
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:47,600
in a transporter with Zelenka
for 3 hours. Now, that's hard.

311
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,571
What are you saying,
you don't like Zelenka?

312
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:51,533
No, I just...

313
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:55,035
It was more claustrophobic than this.

314
00:17:55,195 --> 00:17:57,476
Yeah, but that's not what you said.
You emphasized "Zelenka."

315
00:17:57,596 --> 00:17:59,541
You said, "being stuck
with Zelenka for 3 hours,"

316
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,164
like that was the hard part.

317
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:02,918
It did kind of sound that way.

318
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:03,789
Look...

319
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:06,470
You can say you don't like him.
It's fine. I don't like him.

320
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,948
Well, he's certainly a unique guy.

321
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:12,965
He's always telling me
how nice my hair smells.

322
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:14,179
It's a little weird.

323
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:15,822
He's a very good person.

324
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:18,225
Well, sure, sure, he's the best.
You just don't like him.

325
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:20,164
- I did not say that.
- You didn't have to.

326
00:18:20,284 --> 00:18:22,604
- I know which one's your favorite now.
- It's not a contest.

327
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:24,322
Everything is a contest.

328
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,410
- Don't you have some reading to do?
- There's nothing in there.

329
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,743
Certainly nothing about the door code.

330
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:31,077
So?

331
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:32,888
So?

332
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:35,372
Back to knotting.

333
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:43,414
Steve Carell

334
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,932
or Stephen Colbert?

335
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,586
Colbert, I think.

336
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:52,713
Carell, but I would pick
John Stewart over both of them.

337
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:55,233
If I was forced to.

338
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:00,005
Are you and Katie still...

339
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:03,854
Well, it's kind of messed up now.

340
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,913
Why?
What happened?

341
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,926
Well, I was going to propose.

342
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,664
You were?

343
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:12,664
Yeah, I bought her
a ring and everything.

344
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:16,772
You know, was going to ask her,
and then the quarantine error happened.

345
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,361
What does that have
to do with anything?

346
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:22,756
Well, I don't particularly want
to go into the details but,

347
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:25,238
you know, I just... I told her
that I needed some time for me.

348
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:27,154
It had nothing
to do with her. I just...

349
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:29,951
needed to figure some stuff out,
and now she doesn't want to speak to me.

350
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:32,371
She's filed for
a transfer back to Earth.

351
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:34,988
You broke up with her.
That's a break-up.

352
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,616
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

353
00:19:36,736 --> 00:19:38,305
No, I said I needed some time for me.

354
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:41,183
Yeah, code for "I'm not that
into you anymore."

355
00:19:41,343 --> 00:19:43,060
- But I meant it!
<i>- It doesn't matter.</i>

356
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,271
You can't "almost" propose to someone
and then take it back.

357
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,406
<i>That's a relationship killer.</i>

358
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:53,486
Oh, I suppose it was for the best.
I mean...

359
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:55,974
she deserves to be with someone
who would've known that.

360
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:59,576
What she deserves is to
be with a nice guy like you.

361
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,343
- What?
- We're finished.

362
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:05,665
Oh! Finally.

363
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:06,783
Right.

364
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:20,305
- You guys hear that?
- It's the kids!

365
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:22,959
- They've come back for us.
- I knew they were good kids. I knew it.

366
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:24,243
Down here!

367
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:26,129
I knew you'd come back!

368
00:20:26,663 --> 00:20:27,437
Guys?

369
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:34,319
See? I told you they were down there.

370
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,866
Are your parents up there?
Did you bring help?

371
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:41,451
No. Our friends didn't believe us.

372
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:44,619
We bet them a week's supply of taffle
that we were telling the truth.

373
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:46,456
See? I told you not to.

374
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:49,251
Where are the adults?

375
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:51,378
We can't tell them.
We'll get in trouble.

376
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:53,380
Trouble? Now, you wait till

377
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,242
<i>I get out of here, you little brats!
I'll show you what trouble is!</i>

378
00:20:56,362 --> 00:20:57,358
Tremor!

379
00:20:57,717 --> 00:20:58,932
We're moving!

380
00:21:04,551 --> 00:21:06,134
Tilting over!

381
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:12,296
It stopped.

382
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:16,904
The superstructure under this room
must have buckled.

383
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:20,234
One more tremor,

384
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:23,132
this whole chamber's
going to fall into the chasm.

385
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,556
- Do you want me to do that?
- No. I can do it.

386
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:38,687
Well, it's just...

387
00:21:39,388 --> 00:21:41,222
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

388
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,346
What, you have?

389
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:44,556
Yes, actually,
I have a bunch of times.

390
00:21:44,716 --> 00:21:46,846
Yeah? Well, I mean, so have I.

391
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:49,045
You know, missions and such.

392
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:52,158
- Okay.
- You should probably...

393
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,800
Oh, right.

394
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,655
All right.

395
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,293
Sorry. Sorry.

396
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:10,247
You just about took my head off.

397
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,417
Yeah, but I didn't mean to.
It slipped.

398
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:13,794
Let me do it.

399
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:15,545
I can do it.

400
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:17,439
- Apparently, you can't.
- I can do it,

401
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,466
just don't stand in front of me.

402
00:22:21,152 --> 00:22:22,344
Or behind me.

403
00:22:25,217 --> 00:22:26,217
Okay.

404
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:39,945
See? Almost there.

405
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:45,200
- All right.
- You'll get it.

406
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:48,499
<i>You can do this.</i>

407
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:51,873
This is the one.

408
00:22:52,242 --> 00:22:54,147
<i>I can feel it, this is the one.</i>

409
00:23:05,965 --> 00:23:08,240
- What are you doing?
- Stay there!

410
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:27,841
Anything hurt?

411
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,489
No, just my pride.

412
00:23:31,153 --> 00:23:32,409
That'll heal.

413
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:40,527
You did it.

414
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:42,353
Great.

415
00:23:47,877 --> 00:23:49,833
All right, here goes nothing.

416
00:23:58,214 --> 00:23:59,025
Nuts.

417
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:22,700
<i>There's no way the hook
can grab onto that soil.</i>

418
00:24:23,591 --> 00:24:25,024
All those knots...

419
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,123
Well, we had to try.

420
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:29,924
Any other ideas?

421
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:33,841
See those beams up there?

422
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:36,394
We use the rope to get up there.
That buys us at least 10 feet.

423
00:24:36,514 --> 00:24:40,387
Then we build a bridge,
a bridge using... Using these.

424
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:46,630
Stack a couple of crates, we're golden.
We got that high before.

425
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,195
Yeah, but I don't think these are
long enough to span the distance

426
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:52,323
- between those two beams.
- So we find a hammer and nails.

427
00:24:52,443 --> 00:24:54,955
Sure, why not just add a jetpack
and a trampoline to that list.

428
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:57,082
It is possible to find
a hammer and nails.

429
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:59,252
We've been over the room
pretty thoroughly.

430
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,086
But there's got to be
a hammer and nails.

431
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:04,506
- Well, even if we found them...
- Look, we just have to build a bridge.

432
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:08,343
Wait a second, wait a second.

433
00:25:09,903 --> 00:25:11,263
That bar bet.

434
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:12,651
Sorry?

435
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:15,100
That dumb trick you do
to get free beer.

436
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,786
We don't know
what you're talking about.

437
00:25:19,906 --> 00:25:21,025
<i>Bet goes like this...</i>

438
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:23,476
Using these three knives,

439
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:25,570
and without moving these three cups,

440
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,175
you need to build a bridge
that can support another cup's weight.

441
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,201
- We don't have another cup.
- Whatever. We'll use these.

442
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,589
Now...

443
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,216
See?

444
00:25:38,491 --> 00:25:40,007
Just like our boards...

445
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:43,295
just a little too short
to span the space

446
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:45,206
between the two beams there.

447
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:50,635
You know what? We're geniuses, we could
probably figure it out, but, a little

448
00:25:50,795 --> 00:25:53,236
<i>- under the gun, so.</i>
- Okay.

449
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:21,541
You owe me a beer, by the way.

450
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:23,310
Hey, this works,

451
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,544
I'll buy you a keg.

452
00:28:09,098 --> 00:28:11,620
I knew this wasn't such a good idea.

453
00:28:12,636 --> 00:28:13,467
<i>Listen,</i>

454
00:28:13,646 --> 00:28:15,383
I have a reputation
for being pessimistic,

455
00:28:15,503 --> 00:28:17,907
but I think you should come down
before it all collapses.

456
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:21,328
<i>Sam.</i>

457
00:28:21,488 --> 00:28:22,912
Sam, just head back.

458
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:24,985
I'm almost there.

459
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:28,251
<i>Oh, no!</i>

460
00:28:31,331 --> 00:28:32,082
Sam!

461
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:34,802
Don't move. Don't move!

462
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:41,144
Let me see.

463
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,314
Your leg is broken.

464
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:52,942
We're in trouble now, aren't we?

465
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:55,026
No, we'll be fine. We just...

466
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:56,948
We'll be fine.

467
00:29:09,202 --> 00:29:10,498
Can you help me?

468
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,546
One hand here, on her knee.

469
00:29:15,274 --> 00:29:17,008
One hand down here, on her ankle.

470
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:18,612
Keep it nice and straight.

471
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:21,346
You're not going to like this,
but I got to take your boot off.

472
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:22,806
I thought you might.

473
00:29:32,121 --> 00:29:33,282
Here it comes.

474
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:45,245
Tell me when you can feel
my finger on the bottom of your foot.

475
00:29:45,873 --> 00:29:46,871
Okay.

476
00:29:50,118 --> 00:29:51,061
Yep.

477
00:29:51,594 --> 00:29:52,544
Yeah.

478
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:55,213
- Here?
- Yeah.

479
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:03,648
We need to find another one of these,
make a splint.

480
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:04,764
Okay.

481
00:30:10,616 --> 00:30:11,545
Look.

482
00:30:12,926 --> 00:30:14,265
How bad is she?

483
00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:15,775
Well...

484
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:17,259
It's not so bad.

485
00:30:17,602 --> 00:30:19,367
She still has feeling in her foot,

486
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:21,703
so there doesn't seem
to be any nerve damage, but...

487
00:30:21,823 --> 00:30:23,378
the break's pretty severe,

488
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,327
which means there may very well
be internal bleeding.

489
00:30:26,487 --> 00:30:29,247
Yeah, but that's...
I mean, that's... bad, isn't it?

490
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:31,420
Well, it's not really good, no.

491
00:30:31,986 --> 00:30:34,501
- I'd need to get her under a scanner.
- Okay, worst-case scenario,

492
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:37,302
she's bleeding internally.
How long has she got before she...

493
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:39,424
Before it becomes very serious?

494
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:41,426
An hour.

495
00:30:41,946 --> 00:30:43,178
- Oh, boy.
- Come on.

496
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:49,920
So, what?

497
00:30:50,803 --> 00:30:53,173
<i>Hour before internal bleeding
becomes a problem?</i>

498
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:56,245
- How did you...
- <i>It's not my first rodeo, Rodney.</i>

499
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:59,505
- Here's some Ibuprofen.
- Ibuprofen?

500
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,795
- That's the strongest thing you've got?
- It's all I found in this basic kit.

501
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:06,791
Although, from this point on,
I think I'm making morphine mandatory.

502
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:09,729
As well as maybe a grappling gun.

503
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:12,954
<i>I wouldn't take the morphine.</i>

504
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:15,043
<i>Gotta keep a clear head.</i>

505
00:31:15,203 --> 00:31:17,390
We still have to figure out
a way out of here.

506
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,297
At least, one of us does.

507
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:21,824
Chances are pretty slim
that I'm gonna climb out.

508
00:31:22,275 --> 00:31:23,936
Yeah, well, the crates are out.

509
00:31:24,106 --> 00:31:25,009
Yep.

510
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,942
- If you got an idea, feel free.
- I came up with the bar trick thing,

511
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:32,015
and that didn't work out so well,
so I think I'll just...

512
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:33,561
leave it to the pros.

513
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:35,137
Yeah.

514
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,881
Sorry.

515
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:40,151
All my energy's focused on
not screaming in agony.

516
00:31:41,052 --> 00:31:41,903
Wonderful.

517
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,921
The grappling hook didn't work because

518
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,069
the hook wouldn't hold
our weight in the soil.

519
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:51,120
The crates didn't work
because Sam was too heavy.

520
00:31:53,472 --> 00:31:56,238
We all would have been.
I mean, our weight in general.

521
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,921
It had nothing to do with you.
I mean, you're in very good shape.

522
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:02,549
Seriously.
You have, like, the perfect body.

523
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,478
Oh, not that you don't.

524
00:32:06,698 --> 00:32:09,389
No, no. I realize
that your bodies are different,

525
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:12,167
and maybe that would mean

526
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:14,602
that I think your body is imperfect,
but that's not the case.

527
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:18,022
No. No, no.
Far, far, far from it. That...

528
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:20,071
That is a sweet...

529
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:24,377
Which is to say, it would be impossible
for me to choose which of you...

530
00:32:24,497 --> 00:32:26,795
Rest assured,
you're never gonna have to.

531
00:32:27,082 --> 00:32:30,076
If we'd kept quiet, I bet he would have
gone on like that forever.

532
00:32:30,236 --> 00:32:31,096
I'm sorry.

533
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,997
- What I mean is that you have...
- Rodney.

534
00:32:34,614 --> 00:32:35,915
Stay on topic.

535
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:37,676
Right. Okay...

536
00:32:38,264 --> 00:32:39,603
Right, where was I?

537
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:40,915
All right,

538
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:42,036
look...

539
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,465
If we can get...

540
00:32:44,716 --> 00:32:45,955
this rod up there,

541
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,043
attach the rope to it, it'll lay
across the hole, support our weight.

542
00:32:49,213 --> 00:32:51,180
We won't have to worry about the soil.

543
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,975
You were barely able to get
the grappling hook up there.

544
00:32:54,442 --> 00:32:56,728
Barely?
Were you not watching?

545
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,932
It's just that
it's a lot heavier than that.

546
00:32:59,164 --> 00:33:00,149
So...

547
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:05,219
A detonator...

548
00:33:06,272 --> 00:33:07,666
I need a detonator.

549
00:33:09,675 --> 00:33:12,545
Just place the detonator
inside of the tube...

550
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:20,908
Now.

551
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,604
We have to seal the bottom of the tube

552
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,476
around the gas leak,

553
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:31,984
like so.

554
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:36,835
All right.

555
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:38,926
So...

556
00:33:39,257 --> 00:33:40,552
put the wadding...

557
00:33:41,507 --> 00:33:44,051
and the rod into the barrel...

558
00:33:45,282 --> 00:33:47,277
and then, gently, create a seal.

559
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,519
We don't want to pack it too tight,
or we've got ourselves a pipe bomb,

560
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:52,116
but, if we play it right,

561
00:33:52,873 --> 00:33:55,387
- our very own cannon.
- You really think this is gonna work?

562
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:56,507
It should.

563
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:02,085
You can build a cannon just like that?

564
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:04,841
Please, we got access
to pressurized gas, it's a cinch.

565
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:07,877
- You should have seen my grade six...
- Rodney.

566
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:09,944
Right. Okay, yeah.

567
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:12,158
All right, so.

568
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:18,510
Ready?

569
00:34:35,064 --> 00:34:36,703
All right. Okay.

570
00:34:37,537 --> 00:34:39,424
<i>And... are we ready?</i>

571
00:34:41,135 --> 00:34:42,041
Ready.

572
00:34:43,852 --> 00:34:45,342
Fire in the hole.

573
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:53,636
Nice aim!

574
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:55,563
Nice cannon.

575
00:35:00,729 --> 00:35:02,301
That went really far.

576
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:23,127
<i>McKay!</i>

577
00:35:23,952 --> 00:35:26,575
You should stop.
There's too much dirt coming in.

578
00:35:26,695 --> 00:35:29,326
- The room's gonna get too heavy.
<i>- I've almost got it!</i>

579
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:50,013
<i>Jennifer!</i>

580
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,571
Down here!

581
00:35:53,105 --> 00:35:54,573
<i>Rodney, don't let go!</i>

582
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,533
Rodney, don't let go!

583
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,078
- Rodney?
- Sam, I can't hold it.

584
00:36:11,198 --> 00:36:12,277
<i>Yes, you can!</i>

585
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,874
No, I've never been good
at holding heavy things.

586
00:36:14,994 --> 00:36:17,146
I had an old lady's grocery cart
in college...

587
00:36:17,266 --> 00:36:18,865
One reason I didn't date....

588
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:21,318
Stay focused!
You need to pull her up.

589
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:24,794
Really? I was just getting used
to the idea of not letting go.

590
00:36:24,914 --> 00:36:26,813
She can't just hang there
forever, Rodney.

591
00:36:26,973 --> 00:36:28,813
- Help me!
- Rodney, I can't help you.

592
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:32,307
I can't even stand up. You're gonna have
to pull her up on your own.

593
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:42,745
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

594
00:36:42,905 --> 00:36:44,470
- Don't pull me up!
- <i>What?</i>

595
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:45,873
Why?

596
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,788
<i>I see light!</i>

597
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:52,117
No, no! Don't go towards the light.
You wanna stay with the living.

598
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:55,659
No, daylight.
There's a mineshaft down here.

599
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:57,176
I see daylight!

600
00:36:57,296 --> 00:36:59,343
Like on the other side.
Should have thought of that!

601
00:36:59,463 --> 00:37:01,871
Okay, guys, what do you
want me to do? What do I do?

602
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:02,872
<i>Lower me.</i>

603
00:37:03,435 --> 00:37:04,600
What? Lower you?

604
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,228
It's about 10 feet away.
I just need to swing over.

605
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:10,983
What if the mineshaft is harder
to get out of than this chamber?

606
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,526
We already lost our exit, Rodney.

607
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:16,898
<i>I'll take my chances!
Just lower me, I can't hold on forever.</i>

608
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:18,489
You and me both.

609
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:28,165
Okay, good, stop.

610
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:29,536
Gladly.

611
00:37:40,687 --> 00:37:43,079
You're doing great, Rodney!
You're doing just great.

612
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,849
No, "great" is the beach
with a fiber-optic hook-up.

613
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:47,954
This, this is complete agony!

614
00:38:00,397 --> 00:38:01,372
<i>I made it!</i>

615
00:38:03,372 --> 00:38:05,190
You could have warned me.

616
00:38:08,675 --> 00:38:10,291
This thing leads straight out.

617
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,351
<i>It's a nice, steady slope!</i>

618
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:15,129
- <i>Come on, you guys gotta get down here!</i>
- You go.

619
00:38:16,535 --> 00:38:18,134
What? No way.

620
00:38:19,686 --> 00:38:21,711
There's no way I'm going to be able
to lower myself.

621
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:23,512
You won't have to. I'll lower you.

622
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:26,015
Rodney, your hands...

623
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:33,163
Look, I'm not leaving you behind.

624
00:38:33,283 --> 00:38:35,142
Come on... Make you a seat.

625
00:38:56,396 --> 00:38:57,831
Okay, that's good.
Stop!

626
00:38:58,938 --> 00:39:00,004
Stopping!

627
00:39:09,176 --> 00:39:10,475
Almost there!

628
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,686
Just give me a few more feet of slack!

629
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,366
I got her!

630
00:39:31,565 --> 00:39:33,509
- You're up, McKay!
- Oh! Great.

631
00:39:33,714 --> 00:39:35,738
Great, because, I was just thinking

632
00:39:35,858 --> 00:39:37,383
what would be awesome?

633
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:39,548
Would be more physical exertion.

634
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:44,441
Come on now, start swinging.

635
00:39:46,755 --> 00:39:48,572
Rodney, you have to use your body

636
00:39:48,692 --> 00:39:51,256
and start swinging.
Come on, you're so close.

637
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:52,451
No.

638
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:54,812
Used everything I got to get this far.

639
00:39:55,878 --> 00:39:59,178
So that's it then, you're quitting?
You're just gonna die there on the rope?

640
00:39:59,754 --> 00:40:00,553
No.

641
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,103
No, I'm just taking a little rest.

642
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,957
<i>You know, I'm like...</i>

643
00:40:07,257 --> 00:40:09,535
<i>Like a real-life action star, kinda.</i>

644
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,576
- What?
- <i>You know,</i>

645
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:14,569
shooting guns, running around,

646
00:40:15,198 --> 00:40:16,605
saving people...

647
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:20,653
You'd think this
would be easy for me now.

648
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:23,178
You think I'd be,
like, super-buff by now.

649
00:40:23,424 --> 00:40:25,974
Okay, come on, Schwarzenegger,
start swinging.

650
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,956
Just a second more.

651
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:32,768
Okay, break's over.

652
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:03,001
That was close.

653
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:15,588
Correction...

654
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,502
That was close.

655
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:21,257
Okay, come on.
You need to help me.

656
00:41:29,134 --> 00:41:31,073
Looks good.
Okay, thank you.

657
00:41:31,845 --> 00:41:32,883
How's Sam?

658
00:41:33,003 --> 00:41:34,439
She's gonna be okay.

659
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,575
It's a clean break, they're resetting it
and putting her into a cast,

660
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:41,020
which means she's gonna be on crutches
for a few weeks or so, but...

661
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,069
Thank you...

662
00:41:42,445 --> 00:41:43,728
She's gonna be fine.

663
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,449
How are you doing?

664
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:50,071
I'd like to take a bath in this
ointment they just put on my hands,

665
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:52,778
'cause they are the only thing
that doesn't hurt.

666
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:54,823
It's not gonna scar, is it?

667
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:56,358
Chicks dig scars.

668
00:41:56,549 --> 00:41:59,228
- Not the chicks I dig.
- You're gonna be fine.

669
00:42:02,635 --> 00:42:04,059
Thanks, by the way.

670
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,276
For what?

671
00:42:05,698 --> 00:42:07,148
You saved my life.

672
00:42:07,636 --> 00:42:09,239
If you had let go...

673
00:42:09,457 --> 00:42:10,572
You're welcome.

674
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,885
Right, I'm going back to my room,

675
00:42:14,005 --> 00:42:16,301
curling up in the fetal position,
sleeping for three days.

676
00:42:16,421 --> 00:42:17,663
Well, not quite yet.

677
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,748
You owe me a beer

678
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,960
from the bar trick thing earlier.

679
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,693
You couldn't figure it out, so...

680
00:42:24,813 --> 00:42:26,839
There was no time!
I would've figured it out.

681
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:29,081
Yeah, Chimps would have
been able to figure it out,

682
00:42:29,201 --> 00:42:30,801
but the thing is, you didn't,

683
00:42:30,961 --> 00:42:33,564
so I win, and you owe me a beer.

684
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,628
I don't remember
ever agreeing to the beer.

685
00:42:35,748 --> 00:42:36,950
- McKay.
- What?

686
00:42:37,565 --> 00:42:39,477
Do you wanna have
a drink with me, or not?

687
00:42:42,075 --> 00:42:43,715
You wanna have a drink?

688
00:42:45,914 --> 00:42:47,860
God, you're not very good
at this, are you?

689
00:42:48,374 --> 00:42:49,904
No. No, I'm not.

690
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,447
Come on.
