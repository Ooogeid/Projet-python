00:00:00,477 --> 00:00:02,125
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis.</i>

2
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:03,895
<i>I give you the</i>

3
00:00:04,015 --> 00:00:07,052
<i>McKay-Carter
Intergalactic Gate Bridge.</i>

4
00:00:07,726 --> 00:00:11,115
34 Gates from both the Milky Way
and Pegasus Gate systems

5
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:14,726
have been strategically placed in the
massive void between our two galaxies.

6
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:18,188
<i>A macro that I have written
specially for the occasion</i>

7
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:20,696
will command each Gate in the chain

8
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:23,360
to store you in its buffer
and forward you along to the next...

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,005
<i>and the next and the next...</i>

10
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,031
<i>until you arrive here.</i>

11
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,325
<i>Once at the Midway Space Station,</i>

12
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:31,917
<i>you simply exit
the Pegasus Gate system</i>

13
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,076
<i>and enter the Milky Way
Gate system, where</i>

14
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:36,576
<i>a similar macro
designed by yours truly</i>

15
00:00:36,696 --> 00:00:38,615
<i>will forward you along to the SGC.</i>

16
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:40,356
<i>The program is completely secure.</i>

17
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:42,379
<i>No need for a shield or an iris.</i>

18
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:45,605
Total travel time...
a little over 30 minutes.

19
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:47,102
You applause.

20
00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:51,638
<i>Welcome back, Teyla.</i>

21
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:54,094
<i>Thank you.
Believe me, it's good to be back.</i>

22
00:00:54,214 --> 00:00:56,425
<i>So, what's new on Earth?</i>

23
00:00:56,545 --> 00:00:57,847
<i>I wouldn't know.</i>

24
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:01,272
<i>I saw nothing beyond the walls
of Stargate Command for two days.</i>

25
00:01:01,432 --> 00:01:04,866
- How'd the interview go?
- Exactly as you said it would.

26
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:07,626
The new member of the IOA,
Mr. Coolidge,

27
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:11,745
was somewhat brusque and arrogant.

28
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:14,994
He insisted on doing
most of the questioning himself.

29
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:17,956
I thought he would. These interviews
were the first item on his agenda.

30
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:20,875
Don't worry, just a new guy
marking his territory.

31
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:24,135
Yes, well, he is clearly
distrustful of aliens

32
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,964
participating in any aspect

33
00:01:26,124 --> 00:01:27,486
of the Sargate Program,

34
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:29,235
let alone being active team members.

35
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,256
You changed his mind, right?

36
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:32,220
I hope so.

37
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:35,120
Although he did seem distracted

38
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,142
<i>- by my current condition.
- Really?</i>

39
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:40,666
<i>- I informed the IOA of your pregnancy.
- Yes, they knew,</i>

40
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:44,786
and most of the members were actually
quite supportive. But Mr. Coolidge...

41
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:47,216
His demeanor toward women differs

42
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:49,054
from his demeanor toward men.

43
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:51,406
He kept calling me "Honey".

44
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:55,243
I admit, the urge to inflict harm

45
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:58,016
on this man was quite strong, but

46
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:01,067
- I managed to refrain from doing so.
- Good call.

47
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:04,753
Bad idea to run around beating the crap
out of people with a baby on the way.

48
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:08,006
In the end, I don't think
he will have a problem with me,

49
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:10,717
mainly because I think
he believes I will not be

50
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:13,086
returning to active duty
after my child is born.

51
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:14,554
Won't he be surprised?

52
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:19,434
Well, we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

53
00:02:19,594 --> 00:02:22,103
<i>In the meantime, it's important
that we get through these interviews</i>

54
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:24,350
as smoothly as possible
and not create any waves.

55
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,275
I'll inform you
when the report comes in.

56
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:27,493
Thank you.

57
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:35,916
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

58
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:39,325
- Ronon's up next.
- Big waves. We're talking tsunamis.

59
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:40,756
I've thought about that.

60
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:42,436
His interview's not for three days,

61
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:45,174
so I've asked somebody
to come to Atlantis and...

62
00:02:45,294 --> 00:02:46,294
"coach" him.

63
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:48,292
Who?

64
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:57,441
Teal'c.

65
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:00,130
Colonel Carter.

66
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:02,340
Welcome to Atlantis.

00:04:09,156 --> 00:04:11,648
<i>So, Teal'c, the... hair...</i>

76
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:15,296
- You do not like it?
- No, I love it.

77
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,125
It's very... Earth.

78
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:22,055
This city is much larger
than I had expected.

79
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:23,915
It's a remarkable feat of engineering.

80
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:26,044
The Ancients really knew
what they were doing.

81
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:27,265
Indeed.

82
00:04:29,476 --> 00:04:31,274
You look well, Colonel Carter.

83
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:33,926
- Command has been good to you.
- Thanks, Teal'c.

84
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:35,595
It takes some getting used to.

85
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:39,217
The military protocol's
pretty relaxed, but I like it here.

86
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:52,776
Is that him?

87
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:55,735
Yep. That's him.

88
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:58,118
Come on.

89
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:03,636
Ronon Dex, I'd like you
to meet Teal'c of the Jaffa.

90
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:05,995
He's the one I was telling you about.

91
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:08,738
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Ronon Dex.

92
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:11,730
Colonel Carter has
spoken highly of you.

93
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,267
Anyway...

94
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:20,456
Like I said, you two are similar
in many ways,

95
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:22,875
so you should have a lot in common.

96
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:26,025
Teal'c was a member
of SG-1 for over 10 years.

97
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:28,122
He knows all about
dealing with the IOA.

98
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,375
<i>Which is why I thought</i>

99
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:33,878
he could pass along a few pointers,
help you prep for the big interview.

100
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:39,175
Colonel Carter?

101
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:41,386
Yeah?

102
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:44,347
Perhaps you could leave us
to become better acquainted.

103
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:45,896
Sure.

104
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:49,745
Have fun.

105
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:59,247
Do you not speak, Ronon Dex?

106
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:03,530
Not when I've got nothing to say.

107
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:23,076
This is it.

108
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:24,262
Get to work.

109
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,924
May I join you?

110
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:53,726
Salisbury steak.

111
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,217
We are often served this
in the SGC mess hall.

112
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:01,699
I must confess, however,
that I am partial to the tater tots...

113
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:05,595
I don't need a coach teaching me
how to act during the interview.

114
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:07,939
I've dealt with the IOA before.

115
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,496
The IOA is comprised
of more than just Mr. Woolsey.

116
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:16,481
Their new member, Mr. Coolidge,
is far less pleasant.

117
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,827
Oh, well, I can handle him.

118
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:20,526
I'll stay calm,

119
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:22,769
answer all his questions.

120
00:07:24,163 --> 00:07:25,858
I know how to play the game.

121
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:28,567
<i>I am pleased to hear that.</i>

122
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:31,233
Very well.

123
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:33,682
Let us speak of other things.

124
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,561
Such as?

125
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:37,663
Tell me of Sateda.

126
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,799
What do you want to know?

127
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:45,343
When did the Wraith destroy it?

128
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:49,180
Years ago.

129
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:51,641
Your army was unable to fight?

130
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:53,357
Oh, we fought back.

131
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:55,144
The battle lasted days.

132
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:57,605
And when you finally surrendered,

133
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,260
<i>- What did the Wraith do...
- We didn't surrender.</i>

134
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,611
We fought until every last one of us
was either dead or captured.

135
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:05,393
So tell me, then...

136
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:07,648
Is it true that negligence on your part

137
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:10,409
is what first alerted the Wraith
to your presence?

138
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,813
That your reckless actions
brought about the deaths

139
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:15,790
of thousands of innocent people...

140
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:17,625
That's a lie!

141
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,628
Indeed it is.

142
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:24,966
<i>Yet should such a question arise
during your interview,</i>

143
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:28,658
I trust you will not respond
in a similar manner.

144
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:32,098
You do, after all,
know how to play the game.

145
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,247
<i>Ronon!</i>

146
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:35,270
Put...

147
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,390
the gun...

148
00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:37,575
away.

149
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:43,905
What's the problem here?

150
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,985
There is no problem, Colonel Sheppard.

151
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:48,296
Well, that's good to hear. Ronon?

152
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,393
All right...

153
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:57,646
Why don't you take Teal'c
down to the gym,

154
00:08:57,766 --> 00:08:59,333
show him your fighting techniques?

155
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,336
<i>I'm sure you guys
could give each other a few tips.</i>

156
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,975
Colonel, come to place a bet?

157
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:17,643
- What's going on here?
- Friendly sparring match.

158
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:22,553
It looks anything but friendly.

159
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:25,234
No, it's good for 'em.
They're just blowing off some steam.

160
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:30,990
Go! Go! Go!

161
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,117
- How long have they been at it?
- About an hour.

162
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:34,169
An hour?

163
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,809
<i>They're not even taking any breaks.</i>

164
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:37,344
They are now!

165
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:39,763
I don't think that's a good idea...

166
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,537
Okay, that's enough!

167
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:04,015
Ronon! Teal'c! Stop!

168
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:08,110
Let's call it a draw.

169
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:31,095
Why does he have to go with me?

170
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,448
He's not actually going with you.
He's returning home.

171
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:35,665
He just happens to be traveling
at the same time.

172
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:38,289
One less dial-in
on the intergalactic bridge.

173
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:41,294
That's the other thing. Why don't we
just dial Earth directly from here?

174
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:44,104
We need a ZPM for that, and
we don't want to waste the extra power.

175
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:46,704
That was the whole point
of the Gate bridge in the first place.

176
00:10:46,824 --> 00:10:49,344
But there's a 24-hour quarantine
on the Midway station.

177
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:51,517
Well, you're just going
to have to sit around a bit,

178
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:53,141
all right? Look.

179
00:10:53,805 --> 00:10:57,610
The guy's got years of experience.
He's, like, 100 years old or something.

180
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,578
It won't kill you to listen to him.

181
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:01,539
Be a good boy.

182
00:11:02,868 --> 00:11:03,874
I hate you.

183
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:06,593
I'm sorry about breaking up
the sparring match earlier,

184
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:09,065
but if I didn't, you two would probably
still be fighting.

185
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,017
Listen, I know
that Ronon's been resistant,

186
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:15,993
but I really appreciate
you coming here and helping us out.

187
00:11:16,113 --> 00:11:17,920
I too wish him to succeed.

188
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,331
- There is great potential in him.
- I agree.

189
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:22,668
All set?

190
00:11:22,955 --> 00:11:24,353
Let's get this over with.

191
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,675
<i>- Dial the bridge, Chuck.
- Yes, Ma'am.</i>

192
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,669
It gives me great pride
to see how the people of this expedition

193
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:37,692
have embraced you as their leader.

194
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:39,256
As I knew they would.

195
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,109
Thanks, Teal'c.

196
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,546
The Portal's activating!

197
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,423
<i>The patterns are stored in the buffer.</i>

198
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:01,265
<i>The Portal should re-dial momentarily.</i>

199
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:09,575
<i>Incoming Pegasus activation.</i>

200
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:32,004
<i>Right on schedule.</i>

201
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:33,948
I'm going to go get them settled in.

202
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:37,671
You can get started on the attitude
stabilization diagnostics.

203
00:12:38,053 --> 00:12:39,553
I thought Dempster was doing that.

204
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:41,722
- Why do I have to do that?
- You don't.

205
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:44,091
- I want you to do it.
- I just finished five hours

206
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:46,857
- of power-distribution upgrades.
- You chose to be here.

207
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:48,508
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

208
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:51,515
Regardless, I want you to learn
everything about this station,

209
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:54,766
and the sooner you do that, the sooner
I get to hand you the reins and go home.

210
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,144
You're not the only one
who wants to go home.

211
00:12:58,264 --> 00:12:59,827
I heard that.

212
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:02,580
Gentlemen!

213
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,349
Welcome to the Midway station,
half-way point between

214
00:13:05,469 --> 00:13:07,071
the Pegasus and Milky Way galaxies.

215
00:13:07,191 --> 00:13:08,916
Yeah, we know. We've been here before.

216
00:13:09,036 --> 00:13:12,388
Of course. So then you also know
about the 24-hour quarantine

217
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:14,900
before we can let you carry on to Earth?

218
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,891
Don't want to pass on
any of those pesky Pegasus germs

219
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:19,543
to the folks back home.

220
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:22,566
Why don't I just
show you to your quarters?

221
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:24,896
Unfortunately,
you're going to have to share.

222
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:27,101
As you know, there's not
much room on the station.

223
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:29,599
There's a DVD player and a few movies.

224
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:32,726
Oh! We sawn Orbit the other day.
It's actually... It's kind of funny.

225
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,599
There's some sudoku books...

226
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:37,368
Although I think...
No, they're all solved.

227
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:41,309
Like I said, it's a bit small, but...

228
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:46,120
You're only here for a day,
so kick back, relax, have an earl grey,

229
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,250
and get to know each other better,
or... not.

230
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,035
I have deciphered the program.

231
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,879
Prepare the first wave!

232
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:20,185
How's it going?

233
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:22,012
Peachy.

234
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,064
You're bored. I get it.

235
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:26,961
Welcome to Midway.

236
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:31,021
- Are we expecting another dial-in?
- No.

237
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:36,778
Unscheduled Pegasus activation.

238
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,763
- What the heck?
- Oh, God! Wraith!

239
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,796
That's impossible!

240
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:14,021
What are the Wraith doing here?

241
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:16,289
I was about to ask the same question.

242
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,147
Stop!

243
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,851
Dial Earth.

244
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:48,818
What's going on?

245
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,707
The intergalactic bridge is down.

246
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:52,404
- How'd that happen?
- I don't know.

247
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:54,849
We were sending the daily status
report to the SGC,

248
00:15:54,969 --> 00:15:56,503
and we can't connect to Midway.

249
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,764
<i>Some kind of malfunction
either in one of the Gates</i>

250
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:00,245
<i>or the call-forwarding macro.</i>

251
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:02,315
Probably just a glitch.
Simple software hiccup.

252
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:03,733
- Hiccup?
- We hope.

253
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:06,828
Ronon and Teal'c?

254
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:09,382
The malfunction occurred several
minutes after they went through.

255
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:10,946
I'm sure they made it to Midway.

256
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:13,475
<i>- But we can't be absolutely certain.
- Those Gates are in space.</i>

257
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:15,227
<i>- If they walked through...
- No, no.</i>

258
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:18,606
Look, the glitch occurred
at M4F-788, that is a planetary

259
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:20,649
<i>Gate at the edge of the Pegasus galaxy,</i>

260
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:23,112
which means worst-case scenario,
they step through the puddle

261
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,759
and they found themselves stranded
on an uninhabited planet.

262
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:28,999
Stranded. More time together.
Just what they need.

263
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:38,881
All right, we need to secure
the Gate room.

264
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:41,076
No. We must get to the control room.

265
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:43,864
More Wraith can get
through the Gate.

266
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:46,145
They cannot use the Stargate
without the control room.

267
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:47,697
It is best if we just keep...

268
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,318
This way.

269
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:02,952
What's wrong?

270
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,603
I cannot activate the Portal.

271
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:08,770
A lockout command
has been initiated.

272
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,512
It's preventing me from accessing
the controls.

273
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:12,831
Override it.

274
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,079
I'm trying...

275
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:17,539
It requires a code.

276
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,787
What is the code?

277
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:23,680
We don't know.

278
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:26,001
Honestly.

279
00:17:26,698 --> 00:17:29,083
We don't know.
There's only a handful of people

280
00:17:29,203 --> 00:17:32,806
who know that specific code,
for obvious security reasons, and...

281
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:34,848
None are on the base right now.

282
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,684
You initiated the lockout?

283
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:39,399
Well, it's not really a matter
of who initiated it.

284
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,230
- It's standard protocol...
- Did you?

285
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,919
But, I mean, yeah it was me, but...

286
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,901
like I said, initiating it and

287
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:48,070
overriding it are
two entirely separate...

288
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,168
Silence!

289
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,615
Keep working.
Find a way around it.

290
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:57,560
It will take time.

291
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,915
- The interface has several...
- The more you speak

292
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:01,938
the less time you have.

293
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,826
In the meantime,

294
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:08,464
perhaps I can find a way
to persuade you

295
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,609
to give me that code.

296
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:16,598
<i>We've got a lock.</i>

297
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,144
Finally.

298
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,412
Yeah, seems someone
dialing out from 788,

299
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,643
which was preventing us
from dialing in, until now.

300
00:18:22,763 --> 00:18:24,399
- Ronon and Teal'c?
- Oh, I doubt it.

301
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,862
Look, even if the malfunction
spat them out on the planet,

302
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,389
the only logical address
they would dial is back to Atlantis,

303
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,870
which as we know, they didn't.

304
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,781
Maybe it's them and
they can't get a lock.

305
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:36,099
Ronon, Teal'c.
Are you there?

306
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:41,768
Ronon, Teal'c, this is Colonel Carter.
Please respond.

307
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:44,421
I'm telling you, they made it
to the Midway station

308
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,211
before the malfunction.
I'm sure of it.

309
00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:47,713
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

310
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:51,154
- Didn't you say 788 is uninhabited?
- It is.

311
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:54,094
All right, if it's not Ronon and Teal'c,
then who dialed out?

312
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:02,740
The malp is through.

313
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:04,513
Receiving telemetry.

314
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,854
Visual coming in now.

315
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:13,775
See? No Ronon, no Teal'c.

316
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:15,032
Pan left.

317
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,371
<i>That's Wraith tech.</i>

318
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,456
It's hooked up to the DHD.

319
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:24,637
Pan right.

320
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:32,674
Oh, crap.

321
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:38,716
We lost the feed.

322
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:41,141
Not to mention the malp.
Shut down the Gate.

323
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:43,727
Is it possible for them to have
hijacked the intergalactic bridge?

324
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:45,579
That's a hell of a lot more
than a hiccup.

325
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:47,746
No impossible. They'd have
to know about the bridge,

326
00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:50,016
And if they did, there're too many
security barriers.

327
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:52,896
The encryption I used in the call
forwarding macros would take years to...

328
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:54,738
- What if they knew the passwords?
- How?

329
00:19:54,898 --> 00:19:56,544
We just had a Wraith
on base, Rodney,

330
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:58,645
working with you, side by side,
on your computers.

331
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:00,565
You mean Todd?
He was our ally.

332
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:03,522
Look, and even if he wanted to, there's
no way he could hack into my system...

333
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:05,582
<i>- Could he?
- You saw the tech hooked up</i>

334
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:07,584
to the DHD.
What else could they be up to?

335
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:10,465
We have to get to Midway.

336
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:13,006
The daedalus's back on Earth.
Is there another way to get there?

337
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,384
Connect to the bridge
via another Gate in Pegasus?

338
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:17,177
We have to find one
close to the edge.

339
00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:23,706
M6R-125. We could connect
to the bridge through that but,

340
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:25,936
<i>- I'd need to reconfigure the macros.
- OK, get on it.</i>

341
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:28,306
Colonel, prepare a strike force.

342
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,953
Honestly, if I knew the code,
I would have given it to you by now.

343
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:45,247
That depends on the strength
of your allegiance.

344
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,714
No, no, trust me!
My allegiance is not that strong.

345
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:48,834
It really isn't.

346
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:50,836
<i>Please. Please!
I'm begging you!</i>

347
00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:57,759
I think he fainted.

348
00:20:58,641 --> 00:20:59,970
Then you shall be next.

349
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,389
- Wait...
- I've got it.

350
00:21:05,188 --> 00:21:08,061
I've successfully gained access
to override the lockout.

351
00:21:08,221 --> 00:21:08,985
Good.

352
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:10,147
Dial the Portal.

353
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:22,129
In here.

354
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,995
They're heading to the Gate room.

355
00:21:32,115 --> 00:21:32,996
Indeed.

356
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,925
If you want to go to the control room,
go ahead...

357
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:39,447
I'm going after them.

358
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:40,462
Ronon!

359
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,198
Send the device.

360
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:46,415
Device?

361
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:48,429
What device?

362
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:51,025
<i>Offworld activation!</i>

363
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:55,025
Midway's IDC.

364
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,851
Opening the iris.

365
00:22:39,078 --> 00:22:40,570
<i>All right, we're redirected.</i>

366
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,227
We gate from Atlantis to M6R-125.

367
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:45,668
We insert this crystal
with the bridge macros

368
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:48,230
into the DHD,
dial the first Gate in the void,

369
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,238
and we're back on track,
all the way to Midway.

370
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:52,627
- Is your strike force ready?
- As soon as McKay gears up,

371
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,723
- we're ready to go.
- Well, I'm...

372
00:22:54,843 --> 00:22:56,594
All right, I'm gearing up.

373
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:04,590
Prepare the next wave.

374
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:16,613
They have dialed the Milky Way Gate.

375
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:18,675
They're heading
for Stargate Command.

376
00:23:18,795 --> 00:23:19,988
We must pursue them.

377
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,494
Now you're talking.

378
00:23:27,982 --> 00:23:30,203
Let's go before the Gate shuts down!

379
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,374
Shut it down! Now!

380
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,783
Two were able to pass through.

381
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:47,447
But they will be dispensed of
soon enough.

382
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:50,807
<i>- Make ready the next...
- The Pegasus Portal is activating!</i>

383
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:54,188
The next inbound wave was
supposed to wait for my command.

384
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:13,093
Teams 3 and 4, take the lower level.
Teams 1 and 2 with me, this way.

385
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:29,270
Yeah, they're alive,
they're just stunned.

386
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:31,323
By this device, perhaps.

387
00:24:31,885 --> 00:24:32,900
I don't know.

388
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,947
Never seen one of these before.

389
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,975
It appears other personnel
have been disabled as well.

390
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,646
The question is how much of this base
has been compromised?

391
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:44,729
And where the hell are the Wraith?

392
00:25:00,754 --> 00:25:02,087
Ronon, Teal'c, come in!

393
00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:07,128
Ronon, do you copy?

394
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:11,879
Shut the door.

395
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:24,890
Clear.

396
00:25:31,817 --> 00:25:32,867
<i>Colonel Sheppard.</i>

397
00:25:33,942 --> 00:25:34,905
Sheppard!

398
00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:39,541
<i>You have no chance
of retaking this station.</i>

399
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:42,080
<i>Therefore, it is
in your best interests</i>

400
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,758
<i>to surrender immediately.</i>

401
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:44,963
Do I know you?

402
00:25:45,123 --> 00:25:46,550
<i>Not personally, no.</i>

403
00:25:47,094 --> 00:25:49,009
<i>But I know a great deal about you.</i>

404
00:25:49,444 --> 00:25:51,928
<i>- You as well, Dr. McKay.
- Who are you?</i>

405
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:54,264
An acquaintance of someone
you recently worked with

406
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,183
to bring about the demise
of those you referred to as

407
00:25:57,576 --> 00:25:58,760
"Replicators."

408
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:02,817
It was from him that I was able
to procure the necessary data

409
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,149
to commandeer this base.

410
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:06,610
It was Todd.
That bastard hacked my system.

411
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:08,346
<i>So much for buddies.</i>

412
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:09,660
<i>So...</i>

413
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,072
<i>what's the plan?</i>

414
00:26:11,232 --> 00:26:12,880
Take over Midway,
and then what? Earth?

415
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,200
My warriors are securing

416
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:17,162
a beachhead in your command center
as we speak.

417
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,080
Hate to break this to you,
but the SGC is heavily fortified.

418
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,750
You're walking into a world of hurt.

419
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:23,843
<i>Not to worry.</i>

420
00:26:24,194 --> 00:26:26,313
<i>We have ways of evening the odds.</i>

421
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,314
Look,

422
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,059
they're working their way
to the surface, tryin' to get out.

423
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:42,145
They will be unable to do so.

424
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:45,664
A pulse of energy, no doubt
from that Wraith device...

425
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:48,121
has triggered the SGC
automatic lockdown.

426
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,625
So no one gets in,
and no one gets out?

427
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:51,571
Indeed.

428
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:53,638
Just the way I like it.

429
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:00,345
We have activation.

430
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:02,791
That will be our reinforcements.

431
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:05,298
Soon,

432
00:27:05,418 --> 00:27:08,088
it is you who will be in
for a world of hurt.

433
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,420
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

434
00:27:10,443 --> 00:27:13,385
<i>Listen, love to sit around and chat,
but... gotta go.</i>

435
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:18,378
Take positions.
Anything comes through the Gate,

436
00:27:18,498 --> 00:27:19,716
- kill it.
- Yes, Sir.

437
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:22,022
- You two, with me.
- Where're we going?

438
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,738
To the control room,
to shut down the Gate.

439
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:48,878
Oh, thank God.

440
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:51,386
<i>- Where's the head guy?
- He left.</i>

441
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:53,500
Well, I can see that. Where'd he go?

442
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,343
I don't know. He just ran out.

443
00:27:55,594 --> 00:27:57,387
McKay, we're in the clear!
Get to work!

444
00:27:59,695 --> 00:28:00,948
Where's Ronon and Teal'c?

445
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:03,314
They went through the Milky Way Gate
on the way to the SGC,

446
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:05,698
- chasing after the Wraith.
- All right. Here.

447
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,385
- What am I...
- Get them inside.

448
00:28:07,505 --> 00:28:09,652
Seal the door, shoot anything
that tries to get through.

449
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,453
- Where are you going?
- To go help those marines.

450
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,840
- Is he dead?
- Fainted.

451
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,989
<i>- Figures.
- You better wake him up.</i>

452
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:18,575
<i>- We got a problem.
- What?</i>

453
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:20,368
Can't shut the Stargate.

454
00:28:20,818 --> 00:28:24,122
I saw them inputting a lockout protocol
just before you guys came in.

455
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:25,613
<i>Damn it!</i>

456
00:28:27,526 --> 00:28:30,628
More Wraith coming through the Gate.
We're about to get overrun.

457
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:47,194
Hester, come in, what's your 20?

458
00:28:47,314 --> 00:28:49,935
<i>We're still outside the Gate room.
We got a ton of Wraith coming through.</i>

459
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:52,483
<i>- Where are the other teams?
- I lost contact with them.</i>

460
00:28:52,603 --> 00:28:55,046
<i>I don't know how much longer
we can hold 'em off here, Sir.</i>

461
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,565
Just hang on, McKay's trying
to shut down the Gate.

462
00:28:59,093 --> 00:29:00,091
Hester?

463
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:01,225
Hester!

464
00:29:01,882 --> 00:29:02,974
Come in!

465
00:29:24,316 --> 00:29:25,902
Fed on by the Wraith.

466
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:27,979
That's not a good way to go.

467
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:30,420
Indeed.

468
00:29:31,883 --> 00:29:33,345
You say that a lot.

469
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,078
- What?
- "Indeed."

470
00:29:38,534 --> 00:29:39,534
Do I?

471
00:29:41,522 --> 00:29:43,148
I had not noticed.

472
00:30:10,753 --> 00:30:13,065
I would very much like
to have a weapon such as this.

473
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:14,115
Yeah?

474
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:15,276
Get in line.

475
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:22,742
Rodney, talk to me.

476
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:24,503
Still working.

477
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,038
<i>I lost contact
with Hester and the Marines.</i>

478
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,781
<i>I think they were killed.</i>

479
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:31,850
How long before you can
get the Gate shut down?

480
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,912
I don't know,
this is extremely complicated...

481
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,452
Try the critical systems bypass.

482
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:37,506
I have to figure out how
to avoid any commands

483
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,077
<i>that may have been compromised.</i>

484
00:30:39,197 --> 00:30:41,029
Hurry up!
We got more Wraith on the way.

485
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,036
I'm working as fast as I can!

486
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:46,265
- You can bypass the critical systems.
- Not now. Just watch the door.

487
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:48,251
Besides,
even if I could shut down the Gate,

488
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:50,094
there's Wraith in all the base!

489
00:30:50,546 --> 00:30:52,688
<i>We're completely outnumbered.
It's just a matter of time</i>

490
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:54,331
<i>before they wipe us all out...</i>

491
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:57,162
The Gate just shut off.

492
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:00,237
What'd you do?

493
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:04,158
I shut it off,
using the critical systems bypass.

494
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:05,784
Are you out of your mind?

495
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:07,386
What? It worked.

496
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,583
Oh, my God.
The self-destruct.

497
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,253
<i>Did you not just hear me say I needed
to figure out a safe work-around</i>

498
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:19,256
to avoid any commands that may have
been compromised? As in booby-trapped?

499
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:22,218
Look, I didn't use the bypass to
shut down the Gate for this very reason!

500
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:24,768
<i>- Rodney?
- We've made a terrible mistake!</i>

501
00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:26,664
<i>We never should've revived Kavanagh!</i>

502
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,224
He triggered the self-destruct?

503
00:31:28,384 --> 00:31:30,395
- Not on purpose!
- That doesn't really matter now.

504
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:32,285
All right, we've got
just under 10 minutes

505
00:31:32,405 --> 00:31:33,971
before this whole station blows up.

506
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:36,841
<i>- Can you turn it off?
- No, we're completely locked out!</i>

507
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:39,546
<i>They made sure if they couldn't
have the station, then no one could.</i>

508
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:41,748
This couldn't get any worse.

509
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:47,797
They're shooting at the door.

510
00:31:58,792 --> 00:31:59,735
Wait.

511
00:32:06,162 --> 00:32:07,542
Are you all right?

512
00:32:09,483 --> 00:32:10,741
Ronon Dex,

513
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:13,310
this is Mr. Coolidge of the IOA.

514
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:16,688
What happened?

515
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:19,681
You were rendered unconscious
by a Wraith stun device.

516
00:32:19,911 --> 00:32:20,849
What?

517
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,467
There are Wraith... Here?

518
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:25,941
They have infiltrated the base.

519
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:28,447
It is best if you remain in this room

520
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,702
until Ronon Dex and I
have neutralized the situation.

521
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:32,930
No, we need to get to the control room,
radio for help.

522
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,447
We don't need help.

523
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,035
How many Wraith are here?

524
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,280
We do not know exact numbers,
but there are many.

525
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,285
And who else besides you
are going after them?

526
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:41,808
We are the only two.

527
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:43,841
- Get me to a radio. Now!
- It's better if we...

528
00:32:53,247 --> 00:32:54,475
I've got an idea, Rodney.

529
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:56,812
Great, we've got Wraith
about to blast through the door.

530
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,315
This place has got
a Jumper docked here, right?

531
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:01,600
Yeah, to be used
as an emergency escape pod.

532
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:05,404
Well, I'd say this pretty much
qualifies as an emergency.

533
00:33:05,564 --> 00:33:08,292
No... We'll be stuck out here
in the middle of the galactic void.

534
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:11,798
They'll mount a rescue. The Jumper
is stocked with food and water.

535
00:33:11,918 --> 00:33:13,329
Unless you want to stay here,

536
00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:15,886
get blown to smithereens
with the rest of the station. Your call!

537
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:17,625
<i>We got one other problem.</i>

538
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:20,278
How are we gonna get there?

539
00:33:34,843 --> 00:33:36,756
<i>Rodney.
We're out of time.</i>

540
00:33:37,156 --> 00:33:38,847
<i>- Vent the atmosphere.
- What?</i>

541
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,006
<i>Every room but the control room.
Vent the air.</i>

542
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:42,149
How close are you?

543
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:43,608
Just do it.

544
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:45,861
<i>- Can you make it to the Jumper?
- Don't know. I'll try!</i>

545
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:49,907
<i>- John, I'm not sure there's time to...
- We don't have time to argue! Do it!</i>

546
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,670
Venting the atmosphere.

547
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:21,001
All right,

548
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,420
I'll go this way.
You go that way.

549
00:35:23,912 --> 00:35:25,511
Where is Mr. Coolidge?

550
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:27,889
I don't know.

551
00:35:38,184 --> 00:35:40,056
It's pretty quiet out there.

552
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:42,325
Looks like they're all dead.

553
00:35:42,911 --> 00:35:44,935
Sheppard, can you hear me?

554
00:35:46,786 --> 00:35:48,208
John, are you there?

555
00:35:50,764 --> 00:35:52,390
It should be enough time.

556
00:35:52,992 --> 00:35:55,069
I think it's safe to repressurize.

557
00:35:56,764 --> 00:35:57,939
Dr. McKay?

558
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:02,203
Repressurizing the station.

559
00:36:12,195 --> 00:36:14,100
- What you doing?
- I've contacted the military.

560
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,857
They're fully aware of the situation,
which means, unfortunately,

561
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:19,253
- they're preparing to nuke the base.
- What?

562
00:36:19,373 --> 00:36:21,371
Stargate Command has been compromised.

563
00:36:21,491 --> 00:36:23,394
Only way to prevent the Wraith
from infiltrating

564
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:25,104
the population is to destroy it.

565
00:36:25,264 --> 00:36:27,189
- Tell them to call it off.
- I can't do that.

566
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:30,067
Not as long as a single Wraith
is still alive on this base.

567
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:33,362
- Wraith? What, here?
- Listen, we'll deal with the Wraith.

568
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,535
You've got people alive here.
Buy us some more time.

569
00:36:35,655 --> 00:36:38,080
We don't have time.
There's an escape to the surface.

570
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,870
We need to get to it immediately.
Where's Teal'c?

571
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:43,547
I need to get back to him.

572
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:46,542
- No time! We have to leave.
- Not without Teal'c.

573
00:36:46,702 --> 00:36:48,586
We can't go back for him.

574
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,874
We could get bogged down or killed!

575
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:54,414
There's a clear path to the escape,
and we need to get out of here now!

576
00:36:54,534 --> 00:36:57,053
You wanna run away and save yourself?
Fine! I'm stayin' here.

577
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:03,259
- The Jumper bay is...
- Through the EVA prep room.

578
00:37:03,379 --> 00:37:05,676
It's not a real bay, though.
It's more like an airlock

579
00:37:05,796 --> 00:37:08,156
- that leads to a hatch that's...
- I don't need the blueprints!

580
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:10,161
- Where is it?
- It's over there.

581
00:37:18,492 --> 00:37:19,681
Through here.

582
00:37:38,163 --> 00:37:39,068
Sheppard!

583
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:41,497
- How the hell did you...
- Get me outta here.

584
00:38:46,447 --> 00:38:47,663
Excellent timing.

585
00:38:48,688 --> 00:38:49,713
Indeed.

586
00:38:58,146 --> 00:39:00,086
Well, I think that's all of them.

587
00:39:03,626 --> 00:39:05,772
I certainly hope you are correct.

588
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,055
We gotta call the military.
They're gonna blow this place up.

589
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:11,969
What's taking him so long?

590
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:13,981
Self-destruct's about to blow.
20 seconds!

591
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:22,109
- Colonel Sheppard! How did you...
- Later.

592
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:24,142
We're leaving. Sit down!

593
00:39:48,306 --> 00:39:49,550
Ronon Dex...

594
00:39:51,006 --> 00:39:53,765
Do you feel that you can fulfill
the duties of an SG team member with

595
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:55,061
diligence,

596
00:39:55,345 --> 00:39:56,534
integrity...

597
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:00,415
and respect for those
in authority over you?

598
00:40:06,305 --> 00:40:07,316
Yes.

599
00:40:17,936 --> 00:40:19,338
Good enough for me.

600
00:40:29,391 --> 00:40:30,279
Well?

601
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,199
I'm exactly the kind of team member
they want out there fighting the Wraith.

602
00:40:35,729 --> 00:40:37,329
Their words, not mine.

603
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:39,740
And you did not hold a weapon
to their heads?

604
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,898
I did not.

605
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:43,168
I am pleased.

606
00:40:43,728 --> 00:40:45,477
Yeah, well, I had a good coach.

607
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:46,776
Indeed.

608
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,947
The Daedalus is preparing to leave.

609
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:53,198
Colonel Caldwell will beam you aboard
when you are ready.

610
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:54,991
Still nothing from Midway?

611
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:56,208
No.

612
00:40:56,426 --> 00:40:58,395
We have lost all contact with them.

613
00:40:59,105 --> 00:41:02,463
The Daedalus will stop on its way back
to Atlantis to assess the situation.

614
00:41:13,302 --> 00:41:15,174
No way.
You actually liked it?

615
00:41:15,379 --> 00:41:16,691
It's his finest film.

616
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:18,221
Pearl Harbor?

617
00:41:18,507 --> 00:41:21,562
Go ahead and mock it... Everybody does.
But that film will endure, got weight.

618
00:41:21,682 --> 00:41:23,929
Yeah, which is why it plummeted
at the box office!

619
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,447
$200 million domestic.

620
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,009
- That's not plummeting...
- Enough, already!

621
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:30,619
We've been stuck here
for God knows how long,

622
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:32,541
and you haven't shut up,
either of you!

623
00:41:32,661 --> 00:41:34,446
You just keep talking and talking...

624
00:41:37,084 --> 00:41:38,167
What was that?

625
00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:39,790
Something just hit us.

626
00:41:44,011 --> 00:41:45,966
- Ronon!
- Where are we?

627
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:47,321
Daedalus, 302 bay.

628
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:48,962
We saw you, scooped you up,

629
00:41:49,129 --> 00:41:51,096
- heading back to Atlantis.
- Thank God!

630
00:41:52,618 --> 00:41:54,764
- Midway was destroyed.
- Yeah, we saw.

631
00:41:54,942 --> 00:41:56,322
Where's Sheppard?

632
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:00,873
He lasted about a day,
sealed himself in there.

633
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:04,066
No wonder he didn't hear the radio call.

634
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:17,655
Thank God!

635
00:42:19,487 --> 00:42:21,210
I almost shot 'em myself with a stunner.

636
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,045
Yeah. I understand.

637
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:26,860
<i>- Where are we?
- Daedalus, 302 bay.</i>

638
00:42:27,406 --> 00:42:28,884
What's the status of SGC?

639
00:42:29,044 --> 00:42:31,387
Secure. Teal'c and I
took care of the Wraith.

640
00:42:31,547 --> 00:42:33,013
I figured you would.

641
00:42:33,173 --> 00:42:35,268
Come on, let's get the hell outta here.

642
00:42:35,388 --> 00:42:36,413
Yeah.

643
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:40,946
And I passed my interview with the IOA.

644
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,555
- Really?
- Yeah, they said they liked me.

645
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:45,520
Well, what's not to like?
