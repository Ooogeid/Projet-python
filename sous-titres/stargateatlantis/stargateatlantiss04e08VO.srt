1
00:00:00,081 --> 00:00:01,900
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,381
<i>What about us?</i>

3
00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:05,591
You know enough about this place

4
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:07,408
<i>to get us out.</i>

5
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:09,281
<i>We make it to the Stargate,</i>

6
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:11,071
<i>we both go our separate ways.</i>

7
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:14,225
<i>Until then,
we're going to need each other.</i>

8
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:16,144
Next time we meet...

9
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:17,687
All bets are off.

10
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:20,565
<i>It's a command code
that directs them to attack the Wraith.</i>

11
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:23,734
I've written a basic block
storage transport protocol to upload

12
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:26,722
<i>the attack command directly
from this tablet into the core.</i>

13
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:29,033
<i>Long-range scanners have detected
a fleet of ships</i>

14
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:30,908
<i>being launched
from the replicator planet.</i>

15
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:32,816
The attack command
must have been activated.

16
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:35,705
- But they're not heading for us.
- That's a wraith planet.

17
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:37,248
We really should be going.

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,875
You're gonna love the Athosians.

19
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:40,752
Where is everyone?

20
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:42,628
I do not know.

21
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,630
What happened to my people?

22
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,800
Teyla, I've looked over
your test results.

23
00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:50,033
There's something we need to talk about.

24
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:53,639
<i>They are called the Vadeenans.</i>

25
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:56,866
I've known about them my entire life,
but I've never met them.

26
00:00:57,045 --> 00:00:59,561
They do occasionally
trade with others in the galaxy, but

27
00:00:59,723 --> 00:01:01,490
for the most part,
they keep to themselves.

28
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:03,149
And you wanna visit them because...

29
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,085
It is said that their leader,

30
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,445
a man named Davos, is a great seer.

31
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:09,822
You mean, like a psychic?

32
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:12,618
I do not know
the full extent of his powers,

33
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:14,465
but it is rumored that he can

34
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:15,953
even glimpse the future.

35
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:17,830
Oh, give me a break.

36
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:20,291
You do not believe
such a thing is possible.

37
00:01:20,844 --> 00:01:22,135
Well, gee, let me think,

38
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:23,461
no.

39
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:27,173
<i>Look, in a mechanical,
newtonian universe,</i>

40
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:30,077
not a problem. You know enough
variables, you can predict the outcome,

41
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:32,428
but quantum physics blows
that out of the water.

42
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,232
I understand your skepticism.

43
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:37,717
Even among my own people
the stories were not widely believed,

44
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:40,561
but I need to know for myself.

45
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:43,981
You think he might be able to help you
find out what happened to your people?

46
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:48,566
I realize that
it may seem desperate, but

47
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:49,987
<i>it has been several weeks,</i>

48
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:53,032
and our usual means of investigation
have turned up nothing.

49
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:57,245
Rodney, what's the latest
from the forensics team on New Athos?

50
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:00,302
Well, they're...
they're still searching,

51
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,333
but so far,
they haven't found anything useful.

52
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:04,543
<i>Intel hasn't turned up anything either.</i>

53
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:06,089
As far as we know, they...

54
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:07,689
vanished into thin air.

55
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,445
Allow me to make a prediction...

56
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:19,551
this will be a complete waste of time.

57
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:21,847
Well, I knew you were going to say that.

58
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:26,017
All right, from what Teyla says,
these people sound a little skittish...

59
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,689
You can bet that four heavily armed
strangers showing up out of nowhere

60
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:31,730
is gonna set them off a little, so...

61
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:35,384
let's be on our best behavior, children.

62
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:48,364
Welcome.

63
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:50,172
You must be the people of Atlantis.

64
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:53,410
These people don't look very surprised.

65
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:55,123
You didn't tell them we were coming?

66
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:57,556
I've had no previous contact
with these people.

67
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,936
My name is Linara.

68
00:02:59,073 --> 00:03:00,891
Lieutenant colonel John Sheppard.

69
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:03,144
We know. We know all of you.

70
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:06,397
You've been expected for some time now.

00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:13,858
<i>Mr. Woolsey...</i>

80
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:15,389
how was your trip?

81
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:18,053
Well, spending a day in quarantine
on the Midway station

82
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:20,312
wasn't exactly my idea of a good time,

83
00:04:20,448 --> 00:04:23,045
but I suppose it beats a three-week
journey on the Daedalus.

84
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:26,328
Well, that quarantine was only set up
at the insistence of the IOA.

85
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:30,351
In response to some recent contagions
that have taken hold on this base.

86
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,860
Let's face it, Midway is the only buffer
between Pegasus and the Milky Way.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,074
It can't hurt to err
on the side of caution.

88
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:40,014
Anyway, it gave me a chance to prepare
for your three-month evaluation.

89
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:41,238
Right.

90
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:44,172
So, how am I doing so far?

91
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:46,661
That's exactly
what needs to be determined,

92
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,541
but I'm here as an observer only.

93
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:52,109
I have no intention of getting involved
in the day-day operations of the base.

94
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:53,360
Really?

95
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:55,432
That's refreshing.

96
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:59,382
Well, the IOA has come to realize that
bureaucratic interference on Atlantis

97
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:02,244
isn't always as beneficial
as we might like to hope,

98
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:03,859
and,

99
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,636
on a personal note,

100
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,904
it's been brought to my attention
in my own performance evaluations

101
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:12,773
that I can, on occasion,
be a bit of a busybody.

102
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:16,796
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

103
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:18,172
Excuse me.

104
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,422
<i>We're receiving a signal.</i>

105
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:27,576
It's Captain Robbins, on M2R-441.

106
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:31,423
They're delivering medical supplies
to a planet that was recently culled.

107
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:32,715
Patch him in.

108
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:38,591
Captain, this is Colonel Carter.
Please report.

109
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,913
<i>We had a bit
of a development here, Colonel.</i>

110
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:43,829
<i>According to the locals,
a few days after the culling,</i>

111
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,514
<i>another hive showed up.</i>

112
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:46,900
<i>They didn't kill anybody.</i>

113
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,310
<i>They wanted the surviving villagers
to deliver a message.</i>

114
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:51,651
- A message?
- <i>That's right.</i>

115
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,773
<i>Apparently, this particular Wraith
wants to meet with Colonel Sheppard.</i>

116
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:03,349
<i>So, you're telling me
Davos knew we were coming?</i>

117
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,117
<i>He had a vision of your arrival.</i>

118
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:08,649
Before I take you to see him,
there is something you should know.

119
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:10,549
He's very ill.

120
00:06:10,924 --> 00:06:13,926
Our healers have done all that they can,
but it's not enough.

121
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:16,025
Some of us were hoping well,

122
00:06:16,164 --> 00:06:18,073
if you do come from
the city of the Ancestors...

123
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:19,920
We may be able to help.

124
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,842
We would be forever in your debt.

125
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,933
He must be very important to you.

126
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:26,764
We owe him our lives.

127
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:29,781
Two years ago, he had a vision
that the Wraith were coming.

128
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,484
We had time to gather our provisions

129
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:33,840
and escape to the caves
in the northern mountains.

130
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:37,507
Even from deep underground, we could
hear their ships searching for us.

131
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,951
Eventually, they went away
and never returned.

132
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:43,672
Not a single Vadeenan was taken.

133
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:45,666
Impressive.

134
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:48,833
Of course for me,
it's much more than that.

135
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:51,402
He's my father.

136
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:57,456
Father?

137
00:06:57,606 --> 00:06:59,790
The people of Atlantis
are here to see you.

138
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:00,943
Yes.

139
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,144
Yes, come in.

140
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:04,885
I've been expecting you,

141
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:07,221
and I know why you're here.

142
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:14,103
You have doubt in your heart.

143
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:19,108
Anyone with a basic understanding
of body language could've told that.

144
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,027
<i>Among my gifts</i>

145
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,997
is the ability to show others

146
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:25,698
what I can see.

147
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:31,004
Well, you're the skeptic.

148
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:33,691
Fine.

149
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:57,927
What happened?

150
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:00,454
I... I think I saw a vision.

151
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,293
- Of what?
- Of us.

152
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,019
Being captured by the Wraith.

153
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,140
You said it was a forested planet,
misty, with ancient ruins.

154
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:15,872
That's what I saw, yes.

155
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,387
<i>What?</i>

156
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:20,702
While you were gone,
we received a report

157
00:08:20,822 --> 00:08:24,119
that the people of M2R-441
were recently visited by a Wraith.

158
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,258
From the description
of his facial markings,

159
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:29,467
it sounds like the Wraith who helped
you escape from the Genii last year.

160
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:31,571
My old buddy?

161
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,215
Apparently, he has
a matter of great importance

162
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:35,809
that he wants to discuss with you.

163
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,324
<i>We already sent an advance team
to the address</i>

164
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:40,174
<i>that he proposed for the rendezvous.</i>

165
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:42,813
The interesting thing is,
it sounds an awful lot like

166
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,704
the planet in McKay's vision.

167
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:46,999
So we're believing this now?

168
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:50,278
- Davos did know we were coming.
- Did you ask him about the Athosians?

169
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:51,650
<i>I did not have a chance.</i>

170
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:53,976
After he showed Rodney
the vision, he fell ill.

171
00:08:54,488 --> 00:08:56,173
They were hoping we could help him out.

172
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:58,814
- I'll send Dr. Keller.
- In the meantime, there's only one way

173
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:01,820
to know for sure if he's right.
Go to the rendezvous, check it out.

174
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:08,341
Do you have something
to add, Mr. Woolsey?

175
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:11,761
Well, as I said before,
I'm here strictly as an observer.

176
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:15,474
But since you ask, I have to wonder
how wise it would be.

177
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:18,218
<i>I may share some of
Dr. McKay's skepticism, but</i>

178
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:20,622
we don't need
any mystical visions to tell us

179
00:09:20,742 --> 00:09:23,274
that this Wraith
probably can't be trusted.

180
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:26,190
You're talking about walking
deliberately into a trap.

181
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,487
Exactly.

182
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:39,424
This is a bad idea.

183
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:41,912
You're the one who said
it's impossible to see the future.

184
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:44,805
<i>Yeah, I was thinking about that.
I've realized that quantum uncertainty</i>

185
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:48,340
<i>doesn't necessarily preclude the
possibility of seeing probable futures.</i>

186
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:50,483
It's like blackjack.

187
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:52,763
You never know exactly
what's going to happen next, but

188
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,889
a card counter can certainly
increase the odds in his favor,

189
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,933
and frankly,
this feels like hitting on an 18.

190
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,709
It's more like
doubling down against a 10.

191
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:11,029
Hold on, this is the place.
This is where it happened.

192
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:23,881
You were supposed to come unarmed.

193
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:26,002
Yeah.

194
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:28,157
Sorry about that.

195
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:40,250
How's the patient, Doctor?

196
00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:42,580
Well, from what I can tell, he...

197
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,524
he seems to be suffering from...

198
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:48,358
a kind of lymphatic cancer.

199
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:51,412
<i>There's not a lot I can do for him here.</i>

200
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:55,630
Have you detected any physical anomalies
that might be related to his visions?

201
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:58,796
Sorry. Force of habit.

202
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:01,580
<i>Well, I don't really have the equipment</i>

203
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:04,124
with me that's necessary
to make that kind of analysis.

204
00:11:04,382 --> 00:11:06,895
- Why don't you bring him back?
- <i>Understood.</i>

205
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:09,462
<i>Just so we're clear,</i>

206
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:11,515
are we doing this to

207
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:13,443
try and save his life or

208
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:15,299
to study him?

209
00:11:19,397 --> 00:11:22,351
I'll have the infirmary prepped
and ready for your arrival.

210
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:24,076
Carter out.

211
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,279
- So much for trust.
- You tried to ambush us.

212
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,540
<i>I had no intention of causing you harm,</i>

213
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:48,668
but I could not guarantee your
cooperation simply by

214
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,275
<i>throwing myself at your mercy.</i>

215
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:54,799
My intent was to have
this discussion on neutral ground.

216
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:56,355
What discussion?

217
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:58,970
The reason for my contacting you.

218
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,932
I require your help.

219
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:06,593
We worked together once before.

220
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:09,276
- Doesn't mean I want to do it again.
- <i>You will.</i>

221
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Oh, more predictions, just what I need.

222
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:13,890
As you know, Wraith are at war.

223
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:17,739
I believe you refer to our enemy
as the Replicators.

224
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:21,348
- Sounds vaguely familiar.
- Well, we have a weapon,

225
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:25,696
a virus that was designed
to reset their attack directive,

226
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:29,003
causing them to stand down
and return to their planet.

227
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:31,100
At present, it is not working.

228
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,010
<i>Get to the part where we care.</i>

229
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,703
It is well known among the Wraith

230
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:38,093
that Dr. McKay made certain changes
to the replicator base code,

231
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:41,179
opening the door for them
to alter their own programming.

232
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:43,418
Well, knowingly or not,

233
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:46,894
they have since repaired
the weakness our virus exploited,

234
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:49,342
<i>which means
in order to get it working again,</i>

235
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,514
I need to know the changes
Dr. McKay made.

236
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:54,567
Now, here's the part you're not getting.

237
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,377
We're glad they're kicking your ass.

238
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:01,402
Only because you are as yet
unaware of their new tactic.

239
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,162
What are you talking about?

240
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:06,854
They realized we have
a significant vulnerability...

241
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:09,707
our food supply.

242
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:16,381
They have begun to annihilate
human worlds.

243
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:23,881
- You think he's telling the truth?
- He gave us an address.

244
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:26,683
Claims it was a human planet
the Replicators destroyed.

245
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:29,186
- Is it in the database?
- M5S-768.

246
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:30,755
We visited it last year.

247
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,814
It was a thriving,
pre-industrial society.

248
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:35,066
- Send a malp.
- Okay.

249
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,597
Receiving malp telemetry.

250
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:49,414
Here we go.

251
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:53,456
No life signs.

252
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:56,796
How do we know
the Wraith didn't do that?

253
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:59,077
The malp's detecting residual radiation.

254
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:01,910
The energy signature's consistent
with replicator weapons fire.

255
00:14:02,793 --> 00:14:04,137
He was telling the truth.

256
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,890
How many people lived on that planet?

257
00:14:07,632 --> 00:14:09,184
<i>We estimated somewhere between...</i>

258
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,019
50,000 and 75,000.

259
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:21,590
What does the machine do?

260
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:25,867
It scans the cells in his body
and reports any abnormalities.

261
00:14:27,376 --> 00:14:30,274
Hopefully, it'll help us figure out
exactly what's wrong with him.

262
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,208
And then you'll be able to cure him?

263
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:36,218
I'll do my best.

264
00:14:37,248 --> 00:14:38,824
You'll have to forgive her, Doctor.

265
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:41,765
She's not used to dealing
with uncertainty.

266
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:44,467
I may have spoiled her in that regard.

267
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:47,216
Yeah, I heard about your gift.

268
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,516
It's remarkable.

269
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,569
I can see many things,

270
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:56,272
but unfortunately, my own fate
remains hidden from me.

271
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,406
If we hadn't reactivated the attack-code
this never would have happened.

272
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:04,800
It was my call, Rodney.

273
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,218
<i>But it was my idea.</i>

274
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,146
Now, we had a ZPM, we had Elizabeth,

275
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,458
all we had to do was leave,
but I opened my big mouth.

276
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,781
You never could have known
it was going to go this way.

277
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:14,448
No, we don't know that for sure.

278
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:18,220
Remember the nanovirus
that caused the fatal aneurysms?

279
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,328
I always suspected
the Replicators were behind it.

280
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:21,638
But you never proved it.

281
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:24,851
But we know how they feel about the
humans. They think we were a mistake.

282
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:26,982
We should have seen
something like this coming.

283
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:31,280
I know this news
is hard for us to accept,

284
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,232
but right now we need to focus,
figure out what our next step is.

285
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:36,642
I suppose the most obvious solution
would be to shut down

286
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:38,829
- the attack code again.
- Can we do that?

287
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:40,692
It's been done before, just not by us.

288
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,443
- By the Wraith.
- Yes.

289
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:45,176
And what about our prisoner?
What exactly is he proposing?

290
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:48,818
He claims to have the original virus
that de-activated the code the 1st time.

291
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,376
It's not working this time round

292
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:53,079
because of the changes we made
to the replicator base code.

293
00:15:53,398 --> 00:15:56,250
Theoretically, knowing what we know,
and knowing what they know, we...

294
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:58,710
should be able to work together
to shut them down again.

295
00:15:58,963 --> 00:16:00,990
Obviously, that's out of the question.

296
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,776
Do I have to remind everyone
what happened

297
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,696
the last time
we cooperated with the Wraith?

298
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,922
The circumstances have changed,
and what happened to non-interference?

299
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:12,497
As you said,
the circumstances have changed.

300
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:16,191
Col. Sheppard, you've had the most
experience dealing with the Wraith.

301
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:18,628
Do you seriously think
this is a good idea?

302
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,065
I think it's not your call.

303
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:24,360
I need to contact my superiors.

304
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,142
It's just been confirmed.
Two more worlds have been destroyed.

305
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:41,511
That makes three.

306
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:43,984
How many dead?

307
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,914
Well, it's just an estimate...

308
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,125
How many?

309
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,964
150,000.

310
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:52,563
And this is just the beginning,
isn't it?

311
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:54,691
<i>There's no reason
to assume they're going to stop.</i>

312
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:55,628
No.

313
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:58,084
What about Woolsey?

314
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,877
He's contacted the IOA. They're taking
the matter under advisement.

315
00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:04,236
Oh, well, they're good at that.

316
00:17:04,572 --> 00:17:06,710
They'll bicker and argue,
but in the end of the day,

317
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,323
they're going to leave you holding the
bag, just like they did with Elizabeth.

318
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,633
Now, I know why you didn't want the job.

319
00:17:12,753 --> 00:17:14,943
Look, John,
Woolsey was right about one thing.

320
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,401
You have had more experience
with the Wraith than just about anyone,

321
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,570
and in particular, with this Wraith.
You have a history.

322
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:23,294
Well, it's not like we're dating.

323
00:17:24,562 --> 00:17:26,958
I know we can't trust him,
not completely,

324
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:29,641
but what I don't know is
whether or not it's worth the risk

325
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:32,328
to play along with him,
at least for a little while.

326
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,671
You're the only one who can answer that.

327
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:38,501
<i>Colonel Carter, this is Doctor Keller.</i>

328
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:39,936
Go ahead.

329
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:42,247
<i>I've got something you need to see.</i>

330
00:17:42,873 --> 00:17:44,178
I'm on my way.

331
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,578
How's he doing?

332
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:52,452
Not good.

333
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:56,070
He went into convulsions a while ago.

334
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:57,648
I gave him a sedative.

335
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:00,532
Truth is, we got him here too late.

336
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:03,013
All I can do right now
is alleviate his symptoms,

337
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,162
but whether or not he survives...

338
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:07,615
that's out of my hands.

339
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:10,349
This is what I wanted you to see.

340
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:13,704
This is the result of his brain scan.

341
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:17,250
He's showing abnormally high
synaptic activity.

342
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,173
It's similar to
what happened to Dr. McKay

343
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:21,697
when he encountered
that ascension device, only

344
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,192
not as extreme,

345
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:26,212
<i>and in his case, it's not advancing.</i>

346
00:18:27,418 --> 00:18:29,691
Presumably he's been like that
his whole life.

347
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:32,559
You're saying he was born this way?

348
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:35,470
He's a genetic accident.

349
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:37,869
One in a million, if not more.

350
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:42,917
And by the way,
Mr. Woolsey's already asked

351
00:18:43,037 --> 00:18:45,081
for a copy of these test results.

352
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:48,900
I'm sorry, Doctor, but like it or not,
this is important information.

353
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:51,741
He may be a window into
our own evolutionary future.

354
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:54,262
<i>Doctor?</i>

355
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:55,793
He's awake.

356
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:04,685
How're you feeling?

357
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,665
Much better, thank you.

358
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:09,386
Hi, I'm colonel Carter.

359
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:12,363
You are the leader of these people.

360
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:14,547
Well, the ones on this base, yes.

361
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,996
Not an easy task, I imagine.

362
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:20,344
Some days are worse than others.

363
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:21,568
I understand.

364
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:26,887
I myself was on a position of authority
back on my homeworld.

365
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:29,680
From what I understand,
you had a little bit of an advantage.

366
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,683
Believe me, catching glimpses
of the future is not always as

367
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:34,524
helpful as you might think.

368
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,216
But there is something you should see.

369
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,276
You're not feeling well. I think...
it's okay. You should rest.

370
00:19:43,396 --> 00:19:45,466
Everything has a purpose, Colonel,

371
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,065
including the circumstances
that brought me here. Please.

372
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,860
Oh, my God.

373
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:22,725
What is it? What did you see?

374
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,045
I'm sorry.

375
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,358
<i>We should stop trusting that Wraith,</i>

376
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:34,573
- now.
- I'm not buying it.

377
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,454
Dr. McKay's vision came true
exactly as he saw it.

378
00:20:37,574 --> 00:20:40,481
Well, I don't care. The Replicators
are not destroying this City,

379
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:42,325
not if I have anything to say about it.

380
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,923
Maybe Rodney's right.

381
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:46,985
Maybe what Davos can see
is only a probable future.

382
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:50,457
Well, his track record's pretty good,
so I'd have to say it's highly probable.

383
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:52,865
<i>Which means
it's going to be hard to avoid.</i>

384
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:56,799
For all we know, 9 out of 10 courses of
action are gonna lead to the same fate.

385
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,344
<i>Now, unfortunately,
the vision I saw had no context to it.</i>

386
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:03,324
We have no way of knowing
why the Replicators were attacking.

387
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:04,474
Isn't it obvious?

388
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:07,852
We're contemplating joining forces
with the Wraith against them.

389
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:09,546
We don't know that's what causes it.

390
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,824
It's a pretty safe assumption.
Now we're not a target.

391
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:12,934
<i>No, no,</i>

392
00:21:13,057 --> 00:21:16,820
but the rest of the humans
in this galaxy are, and it's our fault.

393
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:18,198
Nevertheless,

394
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:20,948
our priority remains
the safety of this expedition,

395
00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:22,534
<i>and you know as well as I do</i>

396
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,536
the Wraith can't be trusted.

397
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:26,371
This one may be different.

398
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:28,838
Yes, I read the file.

399
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:30,938
He helped you escape
from a Genii prison,

400
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:32,980
and as a reward, you let him live.

401
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:36,923
Let's hope we don't all come to regret

402
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:38,133
your decision.

403
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:40,301
Colonel Carter,

404
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:41,775
<i>we've got a problem.</i>

405
00:21:45,232 --> 00:21:48,054
We routinely track a number of hives
with the long-range sensors.

406
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:50,268
They don't usually do
anything out of the ordinary.

407
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:52,482
Most of the time,
they're just passing through,

408
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,524
but a few minutes ago, this one

409
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,913
suddenly changed course.

410
00:21:57,757 --> 00:21:59,237
It's headed straight for us.

411
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:02,694
- But they don't know we're here.
- They're not supposed to.

412
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,455
What did you do?

413
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:10,855
- What are you referring to?
- <i>There's a ship on the way.</i>

414
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:12,625
Ah, they picked up my signal.

415
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:15,128
- What signal?
- Ask your Satedan friend.

416
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,130
He's familiar with the technology.

417
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,895
A subspace tracking device.

418
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:20,467
I had it implanted.

419
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,830
We would've detected it.

420
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,746
I only activated it
after you brought me here.

421
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:27,138
The ship is necessary
to complete my plan.

422
00:22:27,317 --> 00:22:29,650
The replicator virus is contained
within its databanks.

423
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,520
- When it gets here, we may begin.
<i>- Or when it gets here,</i>

424
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:34,829
I'm gonna blow it out of the sky.

425
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:37,484
Now, that would be unwise.

426
00:22:38,055 --> 00:22:39,654
That hive is loyal to me.

427
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:43,152
For the moment, they are the only ones
who know the location of Atlantis,

428
00:22:44,314 --> 00:22:46,159
<i>but if you attack them,</i>

429
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:48,273
they will broadcast these coordinates

430
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:51,414
to every hive ship in the galaxy.

431
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:58,630
There is no reason for us
to be at odds, John Sheppard.

432
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:02,217
We need each other.

433
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:10,633
We need to know if you can shut down
the replicator attack code on your own.

434
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:13,354
I've been looking into that,
and it's not very promising.

435
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,497
You're the one who activated it
in the first place.

436
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,699
That was easy. Actually, spectacularly
difficult, but everything's relative.

437
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:21,249
The Replicators were originally
designed and programmed

438
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:22,816
to do exactly what they're doing.

439
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:24,152
They were built for this.

440
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:27,283
It was harder for the Wraith to stop
them than for me to start them again.

441
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:29,494
But with this Wraith's help,
you could do it?

442
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:32,705
If he really has the original
shut-down virus, yeah, I think we can.

443
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:35,867
He claims he ordered the hive ship

444
00:23:35,987 --> 00:23:38,378
not to give away our position
unless they're attacked.

445
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:39,629
Do you believe him?

446
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,877
Well, are there
any other ships headed this way?

447
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:45,260
Then I'd say for the moment,
he's telling the truth.

448
00:23:52,175 --> 00:23:54,957
Dr. Keller told me
I might find you here.

449
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:59,107
She was kind enough
to let me go for a little walk.

450
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:03,148
It's quite something, isn't it?

451
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:04,296
Yes.

452
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:08,045
I know I was brought here for a reason,

453
00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:11,978
to play a role on a much bigger stage

454
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,206
before I die.

455
00:24:14,823 --> 00:24:17,500
Surely it is not time
to start speaking that way.

456
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:22,716
Dr. Keller is a dedicated
and skilled physician,

457
00:24:22,866 --> 00:24:27,078
but it doesn't take a great seer to know
what she is thinking and not saying.

458
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:30,013
My time is coming to an end.

459
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:36,183
You wish to ask me something.

460
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:39,439
You know why I came to your planet?

461
00:24:39,726 --> 00:24:41,190
To learn the fate of your people.

462
00:24:42,135 --> 00:24:42,859
Yes.

463
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:44,664
I can tell you only this...

464
00:24:44,855 --> 00:24:46,362
they are still alive.

465
00:24:48,465 --> 00:24:50,158
But they are shrouded in darkness.

466
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,786
I know you will continue
to search for them,

467
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:56,570
but I'm not sure
this burden should be borne

468
00:24:56,693 --> 00:24:58,499
by someone in your condition.

469
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:00,710
My condition?

470
00:25:01,887 --> 00:25:03,921
You carry a life inside you, do you not?

471
00:25:06,627 --> 00:25:07,759
Yes.

472
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:11,638
You conceal it from the others.

473
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:13,692
It is complicated.

474
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,016
I see.

475
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:17,602
I'm sorry I cannot offer you more.

476
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:19,610
That is all right.

477
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:21,272
Thank you.

478
00:25:21,523 --> 00:25:23,149
Now you must take me to colonel Carter.

479
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:24,776
Yes, of course.

480
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:26,101
This way.

481
00:25:36,216 --> 00:25:39,245
This is Teyla to the infirmary.
I need a medical team now!

482
00:25:42,234 --> 00:25:44,137
- We got a problem.
- Firing drones.

483
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:00,113
Teyla's vision only confirms
what I've been saying all along.

484
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:03,612
If we destroy the hive ship, we lose our
best chance of stopping the Replicators.

485
00:26:03,735 --> 00:26:04,978
We may not have a choice.

486
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:08,736
One way or another, events are going to
result in the destruction of that ship.

487
00:26:08,898 --> 00:26:11,621
If you believe that, then you believe
Atlantis is gonna be destroyed.

488
00:26:11,757 --> 00:26:14,117
We might as well
pack up our bags and go home.

489
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:17,328
<i>How about this.</i>

490
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,608
We play along.
We wait for them to transmit

491
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:21,355
the program to Rodney's computer,

492
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,567
then we blow 'em out of the sky.

493
00:26:23,704 --> 00:26:25,712
Betray them before they have
a chance to betray us.

494
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,007
They're Wraith.
Anyone gonna lose any sleep over this?

495
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,845
Can you guarantee you could finish
the job without the Wraith's help?

496
00:26:34,257 --> 00:26:36,055
If I have the original virus,
not a problem.

497
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:39,013
- Can you guarantee it?
- Well, I mean...

498
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,352
no.

499
00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:43,438
<i>That is not the only problem.</i>

500
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,430
If we do not destroy
the hive quickly enough,

501
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,233
it may have time to send a message.

502
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:51,058
All right. I think I need
to meet this Wraith myself.

503
00:26:51,742 --> 00:26:52,959
Mr. Woolsey...

504
00:26:54,888 --> 00:26:56,366
You want me to come with you?

505
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:59,328
I'm sure you want your report to
the IOA to be as thorough as possible.

506
00:27:01,877 --> 00:27:03,148
Of course.

507
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,225
I've never met a Wraith
face-to-face before.

508
00:27:12,362 --> 00:27:13,865
Well, you're in for a treat.

509
00:27:20,075 --> 00:27:21,456
Ladies first.

510
00:27:23,629 --> 00:27:25,181
- Open it.
- Colonel...

511
00:27:25,331 --> 00:27:26,875
It's all right.

512
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,850
I'm colonel Samantha Carter.

513
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:33,461
A pleasure to make your acquaintance.

514
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:36,358
Richard Woolsey.

515
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,660
I understand you're proposing that
we work together on a joint venture.

516
00:27:39,937 --> 00:27:42,538
- That is correct.
- Last time we went down this road,

517
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,777
things didn't exactly work out
the way we'd hoped.

518
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,960
You were betrayed. Believe me,
I understand your reluctance.

519
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:51,052
If we do this, we do it our way.

520
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:52,604
Your ship remains in orbit.

521
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:55,367
They make the slightest false move,
and they'll be destroyed.

522
00:27:55,565 --> 00:27:57,924
- Fair enough.
- The program will be downloaded

523
00:27:58,061 --> 00:28:00,306
into a non-networked computer
in one of our labs.

524
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:02,266
All work will be conducted on this base.

525
00:28:02,428 --> 00:28:06,479
You will remain under constant guard,
and when you're done, we keep the virus.

526
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:09,401
It won't be easy to upload it
into the replicator network.

527
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,067
Are you sure you're up to the task?

528
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:13,361
We did it before, we'll do it again.

529
00:28:19,027 --> 00:28:20,449
I agree to your terms.

530
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:22,870
You see, I want this as much as you do.

531
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:26,374
Now, let's say that this works.
What happens then?

532
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:29,190
In my time
as a prisoner among the Genii,

533
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,122
I lost my position among Wraith.

534
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:32,798
I still have a few loyal followers,

535
00:28:32,918 --> 00:28:35,045
but nothing like
the standing I once had.

536
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:38,803
So you're going to use this
to leverage your way back in?

537
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,513
In a manner of speaking.

538
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:43,343
Sooner or later, we're going
to end up on opposite sides.

539
00:28:43,466 --> 00:28:44,183
Yes,

540
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,250
but not today.

541
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:48,020
Do we have an agreement?

542
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,742
We do.

543
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:55,444
I believe among your people,
it is customary to shake hands.

544
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:03,369
Just a little wraith humor.

545
00:29:04,722 --> 00:29:06,431
I hope you know what you're doing.

546
00:29:20,806 --> 00:29:22,680
<i>The wraith ship
just dropped out of hyperspace.</i>

547
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:24,946
Are they powering weapons?

548
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,149
Negative.
They're sending a transmission.

549
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:30,803
Rodney, you're on.

550
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,936
<i>That's it? That's their super-weapon?</i>

551
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,816
Well, what were you expecting?

552
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:37,360
A big gun?

553
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:39,299
Something that goes boom?

554
00:29:41,772 --> 00:29:42,783
Sam, that's it.

555
00:29:43,686 --> 00:29:44,834
<i>We got it.</i>

556
00:29:45,094 --> 00:29:47,869
I can go down to the chair room,
finish this off right now.

557
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:49,484
I can't risk it, John.

558
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,627
Security, have the Wraith
escorted to Dr. Mckay's lab.

559
00:29:56,245 --> 00:29:58,165
No, this is all wrong.

560
00:29:58,888 --> 00:30:00,841
- What do you mean?
- You must iterate all values

561
00:30:00,964 --> 00:30:03,150
of the expression before
you can aggregate the results.

562
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:06,105
You kidding? We're better off using
known data points and extrapolating.

563
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:08,047
You risk compounding errors.

564
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:09,227
What?

565
00:30:10,122 --> 00:30:13,500
If my hands were free, I could help you.

566
00:30:13,623 --> 00:30:15,936
No, it's fine.
I'll do it myself, thanks.

567
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,695
As you wish.

568
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:26,702
<i>He's holding out on us.</i>

569
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:28,985
Part of the virus is missing.

570
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:31,294
Sure, they're minor sub-routines,
not greatly affected

571
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,417
by the changes I made
to the base code, but still,

572
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,810
necessary to make it work.

573
00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:36,977
I probably wouldn't have
even noticed it, except...

574
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:38,923
well, you know, I'm really good.

575
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:41,717
- Look, he's definitely up to something.
- We know.

576
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:45,012
You know? What do you mean you know?

577
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:47,988
A few minutes ago,
we started tracking another hive ship

578
00:30:48,108 --> 00:30:49,684
on course for Atlantis.

579
00:30:53,474 --> 00:30:55,726
I swear I know nothing of this.

580
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,817
You gave our position away
to another hive ship.

581
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:00,542
Why would I betray you now,

582
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:02,937
just as we were beginning
to trust each other?

583
00:31:03,086 --> 00:31:04,448
<i>We're not, really, are we?</i>

584
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:06,784
You held back some of the virus.

585
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,623
Just a small portion.

586
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:15,376
Nothing that prevents us
from completing our work,

587
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:18,374
and once that is done,
I will gladly transmit the remainder.

588
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:20,589
- I say we kill him right now.
- I agree.

589
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:25,128
I had no way of knowing
you would not simply...

590
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,986
take the virus and then turn against me.

591
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:29,807
I'm offended you could even think that.

592
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,776
The point is, you lied. How do we know
you're not lying about the ship?

593
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:36,807
Wraith are divided into many camps.

594
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:39,984
There is much suspicion and mistrust.

595
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:43,599
The last thing I need
is for another hive to appear

596
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:45,740
before I can complete this work.

597
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,123
That's it.

598
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,619
That's why they're coming. They're
tracking his ship. Think about it,

599
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:53,135
a single hive, off by itself,
out in the middle of nowhere,

600
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:55,485
orbiting a supposedly
uninhabited planet.

601
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:57,412
That's bound to raise a few eyebrows.

602
00:31:57,755 --> 00:31:59,503
I mean, if you had eyebrows.

603
00:32:01,225 --> 00:32:03,316
There is only one solution.

604
00:32:05,803 --> 00:32:07,935
You must cloak the City.

605
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,236
We cloak the City, we lose shields.

606
00:32:16,356 --> 00:32:18,010
We'd be completely vulnerable to attack.

607
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:19,650
And what if he's telling the truth?

608
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,864
If we don't cloak, we'll
be giving up our position.

609
00:32:22,028 --> 00:32:25,092
He's been playing us from the start.
This is what he wanted all along.

610
00:32:25,215 --> 00:32:26,432
All right, wait a minute.

611
00:32:26,568 --> 00:32:29,042
You thought the Replicators
were going to destroy the City.

612
00:32:29,165 --> 00:32:31,693
Now you think the Wraith
are gonna do it? Which one is it?

613
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,039
How long until
the second hive gets here?

614
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,469
Two hours.

615
00:32:40,945 --> 00:32:41,962
<i>Hello again.</i>

616
00:32:42,442 --> 00:32:43,442
Colonel.

617
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,000
It's nice to see you,
but I'm afraid I can't offer you

618
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,219
any more insight into future events.

619
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:51,013
These medicines dull my mind.

620
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:53,636
That's all right. That's not why I came,

621
00:32:54,142 --> 00:32:56,518
I did want to ask you
a few questions about your visions,

622
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,313
- if you feel up to it.
- Of course.

623
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,233
Have you ever been wrong?

624
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:03,584
No.

625
00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:05,403
Knowing how events play out,

626
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,073
you haven't been able to change
the future, or... or avoid it?

627
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:11,826
I'm afraid not.

628
00:33:12,255 --> 00:33:14,087
What about the culling on your planet?

629
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:15,663
I did not see a culling,

630
00:33:16,189 --> 00:33:18,182
merely the wraith ships arriving,

631
00:33:18,302 --> 00:33:20,378
and that is exactly what happened.

632
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,527
Dr. McKay's vision
happened as he saw it,

633
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:27,591
but his interpretation was incorrect.

634
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:30,970
Pretty hard to misinterpret what I saw.

635
00:33:31,424 --> 00:33:33,013
<i>I make no judgments,</i>

636
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:35,766
but I do know it will come to pass.

637
00:33:36,945 --> 00:33:38,936
It's hard for me to accept that.

638
00:33:39,098 --> 00:33:41,144
You're telling me that
the future is predetermined,

639
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:44,462
but I have always believed that
the future is what you make it.

640
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:47,153
Perhaps both are true.

641
00:33:47,715 --> 00:33:49,475
Perhaps the future is predetermined

642
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,866
by the character of those who shape it.

643
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:54,811
One thing

644
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:58,004
has been clear to me
from the moment I set foot in this City.

645
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:02,174
The galaxy is at a crossroads.

646
00:34:03,197 --> 00:34:04,628
Never before

647
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:07,298
have I sensed that the future

648
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:10,050
of so many worlds can turn

649
00:34:10,212 --> 00:34:12,330
on the actions of so few.

650
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,183
The other hive ship will be here soon.

651
00:34:29,364 --> 00:34:30,385
I know.

652
00:34:30,774 --> 00:34:34,637
- You should get down to the chair room.
- So we've decided to take 'em out?

653
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:37,617
Right now, I'm having
a hard time deciding anything.

654
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:40,675
You know what the problem is?

655
00:34:40,921 --> 00:34:43,034
- Too much information.
- Really.

656
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:45,271
Only so much information
to make a decision.

657
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:47,287
Anything after that complicates it.

658
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,174
Like these visions,
are they making things better or worse?

659
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,611
They helped you avoid being captured.

660
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:56,096
No, you and I both know we would never
walk into a trap unprepared,

661
00:34:56,435 --> 00:34:58,572
<i>even if McKay didn't have that vision.</i>

662
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:02,728
The future is predetermined by
the character of those who shape it.

663
00:35:03,015 --> 00:35:04,177
What's that?

664
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:06,992
Nothing.

665
00:35:07,717 --> 00:35:08,609
Look,

666
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:11,445
technically Woolsey is correct.

667
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:15,449
The safety of this City is
our first priority, and based on that,

668
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,042
there is only one decision,

669
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:20,329
take out both the hive ships
as soon as possible.

670
00:35:20,675 --> 00:35:21,741
But...

671
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:22,873
But...

672
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:26,697
what the hell's the point of being
out here if we're not gonna help people?

673
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:30,130
We're going to be safe and sound while
the rest of the galaxy gets slaughtered?

674
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,109
So, play it safe or
take a chance with the Wraith

675
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:35,261
and maybe save millions of lives.

676
00:35:37,964 --> 00:35:40,105
This kind of decision used to be easy,

677
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:42,475
but then I was just making it
for myself.

678
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,753
Now I'm asking a lot of people
to take a chance with me.

679
00:35:45,917 --> 00:35:48,487
Everybody on this base chose to be here,

680
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:53,153
and they did so because they believe
in the same things you do.

681
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:56,949
If anything goes wrong...

682
00:35:57,544 --> 00:35:58,733
I'll be ready.

683
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:17,239
Rodney, prepare to cloak the City.

684
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:20,088
All right, people, you heard her.
Let's do this.

685
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,290
My understanding...

686
00:36:26,591 --> 00:36:29,556
is it takes some doing to switch back
from the cloak to the shields.

687
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:31,608
It's not something
that can be done right away.

688
00:36:31,745 --> 00:36:32,824
That's right.

689
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:35,808
So if we commit to this course
of action, there's no going back.

690
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:37,656
I'm afraid not.

691
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,529
There's still some time before
the second hive gets here.

692
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:43,889
You could return to Midway if you like.

693
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:47,558
But then my report wouldn't be
as thorough as possible,

694
00:36:47,695 --> 00:36:48,709
would it?

695
00:36:53,206 --> 00:36:54,465
I'm in position, Colonel.

696
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:56,705
Understood.

697
00:36:57,546 --> 00:36:58,783
How we doing?

698
00:36:59,111 --> 00:37:00,573
Engaging cloak...

699
00:37:01,749 --> 00:37:02,723
<i>now.</i>

700
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:11,330
Father?

701
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:14,433
Father?

702
00:37:14,788 --> 00:37:17,046
Doctor! Doctor, help him!

703
00:37:21,488 --> 00:37:22,368
Father?

704
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:28,143
No...

705
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:30,918
I'm sorry.

706
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:47,893
Second hive
just dropped out of hyperspace.

707
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:51,230
This is it.

708
00:37:58,202 --> 00:37:59,905
The first hive
is sending a transmission.

709
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:02,699
Probably trying to explain
what they're doing here.

710
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:05,033
- What's happening?
- <i>Stand by.</i>

711
00:38:06,673 --> 00:38:08,372
They're still just talking.

712
00:38:10,048 --> 00:38:12,209
Wait a minute. We got a problem.

713
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,283
What is it? What's going on?

714
00:38:15,116 --> 00:38:16,672
Both ships just powered weapons.

715
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:19,258
- Oh, my God.
- <i>That's it.</i>

716
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:21,552
- Firing drones.
- <i>John, wait.</i>

717
00:38:23,332 --> 00:38:24,540
Just give it a second.

718
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,681
<i>Are you insane?</i>

719
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:27,975
- They're going to wipe us out!
- Shut up, Woolsey.

720
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:30,185
Colonel Sheppard,

721
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:31,854
<i>as ranking representant of the IOA,</i>

722
00:38:32,016 --> 00:38:34,106
I'm assuming command of this base.

723
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:36,570
I'm ordering you
to launch the drones now!

724
00:38:36,693 --> 00:38:37,693
<i>Belay that order!</i>

725
00:38:37,855 --> 00:38:40,758
One more word out of you,
and I will have you removed.

726
00:38:43,684 --> 00:38:45,534
Hold on, something's happening.

727
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,956
- The hives are firing on each other.
- Are you sure?

728
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,330
Definitely. They're not
pulling any punches, either.

729
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:07,556
They just destroyed each other.

730
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:12,519
I guess the other Wraith
didn't buy their story.

731
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:15,522
Was either ship able to
get off a subspace message?

732
00:39:16,584 --> 00:39:17,848
Right.

733
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:21,094
Negative.

734
00:39:21,347 --> 00:39:22,654
We're good.

735
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:29,328
John, you can stand down.

736
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:33,367
Gladly.

737
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,912
I'm taking him back to Vadeena,

738
00:39:57,049 --> 00:39:58,927
to be buried according to our custom.

739
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,817
It is good that he is going home.

740
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:03,403
I don't know what my people
will do without him.

741
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:07,421
He's always been there, warning us
of danger, protecting us from harm.

742
00:40:07,848 --> 00:40:09,493
Now for the first time in my life,

743
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:12,079
I fear the future.

744
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:15,006
Just because something is unknown

745
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:17,960
does not necessarily mean
it needs to be feared.

746
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,546
Trust yourself,

747
00:40:21,142 --> 00:40:23,849
and the rest will unfold
as it is meant to.

748
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:37,558
He was an interesting man.

749
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:39,280
Yes.

750
00:40:40,948 --> 00:40:42,807
He knew that I was pregnant.

751
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:44,529
Really?

752
00:40:45,554 --> 00:40:46,613
You know,

753
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:49,900
pretty soon,
other people are gonna find out too.

754
00:40:50,938 --> 00:40:52,327
You're gonna have to tell them.

755
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,985
I know.

756
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,409
So all it took was the destruction
of my ship for you to finally trust me.

757
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:08,555
No, not true. I still don't trust you.

758
00:41:08,678 --> 00:41:10,715
Take him to the lab.
He's got work to do.

759
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,316
Well...

760
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:24,318
this is awkward.

761
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,131
Yes.

762
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:30,696
For the record,

763
00:41:31,461 --> 00:41:33,118
I thought I was making the right call.

764
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:36,121
It was a difficult situation
for everyone.

765
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:39,776
I just have one last question.

766
00:41:40,277 --> 00:41:43,378
How did you know the two wraith ships
would fire on each other?

767
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,797
I didn't.

768
00:41:49,668 --> 00:41:51,551
You going to put that in your report?

769
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,764
It probably would be better if I didn't.

770
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:57,420
There may be such a thing as being...

771
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,591
too thorough.

772
00:42:00,614 --> 00:42:01,750
Right.

773
00:42:17,306 --> 00:42:19,460
- Where's Woolsey?
- Oh, you just missed him.

774
00:42:19,614 --> 00:42:22,306
That hurts my feelings.
I didn't even say goodbye yet.

775
00:42:22,883 --> 00:42:24,120
How's McKay doing?

776
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,960
He and the Wraith are back at it, but

777
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:29,018
I guess they're having a problem
getting this virus to work.

778
00:42:29,157 --> 00:42:30,921
I'd hate to think
this was all for nothing.

779
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:33,714
Well, we got out alive
and we kept our location secret.

780
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:35,844
That still counts for something.

781
00:42:36,863 --> 00:42:38,886
You're still thinking
about those visions, huh?

782
00:42:39,022 --> 00:42:40,493
I can't get them out of my head.

783
00:42:40,613 --> 00:42:42,849
Everything Davos saw came true.

784
00:42:43,082 --> 00:42:45,993
For all we know, it won't come true
for another thousand years.

785
00:42:46,116 --> 00:42:47,852
- Or it could come true tomorrow.
- Right!

786
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:49,517
So what else is new?
