1
00:00:01,696 --> 00:00:03,097
Incoming wormhole.

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:06,113
Signal's coming in, now.

3
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:16,015
<i>No doubt you're surprised
to see me, John Sheppard.</i>

4
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:19,560
Well, you weren't looking so good
last time I saw you.

5
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:23,128
<i>Yes, well, you'll be pleased to know
the treatment was successful,</i>

6
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:25,441
<i>although excruciatingly painful.</i>

7
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:28,110
You're just saying that
to make me feel good.

8
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:33,079
<i>I was able to return to my position
as leader of the alliance,</i>

9
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:36,687
<i>although I have had
a recent setback.</i>

10
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:40,494
<i>Perhaps you can see
what is remaining of my shuttle,</i>

11
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:41,624
<i>behind me.</i>

12
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:43,459
Yeah, nice landing.

13
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:46,769
<i>Don't be so critical, Sheppard.</i>

14
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:50,993
<i>It wasn't long ago my flying skills
saved the lives of both you</i>

15
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:53,286
<i>and your companions.</i>

16
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,056
<i>It wasn't pilot error.
I was attacked</i>

17
00:00:57,402 --> 00:00:59,395
<i>by one of my underlings.</i>

18
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:02,238
You'll excuse me for being blunt,

19
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,271
but why should we care?

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,608
<i>It isn't the fact that he attacked,
and at least temporarily defeated me</i>

21
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,433
<i>that should concern you.</i>

22
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:11,733
<i>It's rather</i>

23
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:13,890
<i>how he managed to do it.</i>

24
00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:15,825
And how was that?

25
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:19,953
<i>He acquired a very rare
and powerful piece of technology.</i>

26
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,071
<i>One with which I believe
you are quite familiar.</i>

27
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:26,693
- A ZPM? Are you kidding me?
- That's what he said.

28
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:28,482
- I don't buy it.
- Why not?

29
00:01:28,607 --> 00:01:30,670
They don't exactly grow on trees.

30
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:32,469
He got betrayed.

31
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:34,923
Now he wants us
to help him clean up the mess.

32
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:36,232
End of story.

33
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:40,046
It is possible that he mentioned the ZPM
simply to get our attention.

34
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:43,670
Except he would also have to know
that we would discover the truth,

35
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:47,164
and, in the meantime, he's volunteered
to place himself in our custody.

36
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:50,356
- It's not a good plan.
- There's something he's not telling us.

37
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:53,320
Granted, but that doesn't
necessarily mean that he's lying

38
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,782
- about the ZPM.
- If this is true,

39
00:01:56,358 --> 00:01:58,491
it could be very, very bad.

40
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,078
Inefficient power generation
is the Achilles heel

41
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,497
of Wraith technology.
It's basically the reason

42
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,666
for every technological advantage
we have.

43
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:09,292
If this underling,
or whatever it is that Todd calls him,

44
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:13,415
- is flying in a ZPM-powered ship...
- It's a threat we can't tolerate,

45
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:16,540
and we won't.

The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

48
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:29,231
www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

49
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:37,807
Well, here we are again.

50
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,151
Indeed.

51
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:42,911
This City has become
quite familiar to me,

52
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:46,165
almost a respite from daily life.

53
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:49,771
It would be a shame
to see it destroyed.

54
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,255
If we don't help you,
that would be a likely outcome?

55
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:00,596
All right,
let's start at the beginning.

56
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:02,931
Where did the ZPM come from?

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,833
You'll recall I managed to acquire
a few of the devices

58
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,463
from the Replicator City,
before it was destroyed?

59
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,140
Yes, and they were lost

60
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:12,411
when Col. Sheppard took out
the cloning facility.

61
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:13,841
Not all of them.

62
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:17,254
I may have acquired a few more
than I let on.

63
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:18,488
How many more?

64
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,283
Let's not get caught up
in unnecessary details.

65
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,526
I like details.

66
00:03:23,898 --> 00:03:26,914
Even if I gave you a number,
you'd have no way of verifying it,

67
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,332
so what's the point?

68
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,041
Then tell me this.

69
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,794
Why now?
You've had those ZPMs for over a year.

70
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:36,334
The organic nature of a Hive
creates certain incompatibilities

71
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:37,799
with Ancient technology.

72
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:41,094
I put my best scientists to work

73
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,567
on this project,

74
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:45,098
and, recently,
one of them succeeded.

75
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:47,793
Only he didn't want
to turn it over to you.

76
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:49,923
He decided to keep it for himself,

77
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:53,814
and now you want us
to help you kick him to the curb.

78
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:56,520
What you really need to know

79
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:59,439
is that this Hive
is a work in progress.

80
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:03,224
It has yet to reach
its full potential,

81
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:05,202
which means if you attack it now,

82
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,705
you may be able to destroy it, but
if you hesitate, it will be too late,

83
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:12,233
and this Hive will be unstoppable.

84
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:35,573
Lookin' good.

85
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:40,147
Was it really necessary
to remove my subspace transmitter

86
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:44,167
and force me to wear
this ridiculous outfit?

87
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:46,952
Well, after what happened
last time on this ship,

88
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:48,880
you can't blame us.

89
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:52,149
I take it then
my request to be on the bridge

90
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:54,292
- when we make contact...
- Denied.

91
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,003
- Understandable.
- Here's the problem...

92
00:04:57,592 --> 00:04:59,725
Every time we get involved with you,

93
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,467
I feel like I'm walking around
with a live grenade in my pocket,

94
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:06,560
just waiting for it to all go wrong,
for that one thing

95
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:08,265
you forgot to mention.

96
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,892
- I assure you, in this case...
- Save it.

97
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,063
I've been down this road before.

98
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,843
If you really feel that way,

99
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,528
why would you let me go
after our last encounter?

100
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,998
We had a deal,
and you kept up your end of the bargain,

101
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,494
and to be honest,
I didn't think you'd live.

102
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:34,659
If I find out you're playing us,

103
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:38,492
I'm not going to wait
for authorization.

104
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,329
There isn't going to be
any paperwork.

105
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:43,628
I'm just going to kill you.

106
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,853
- What's the status, Colonel?
- We're approaching coordinates.

107
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:56,233
You going somewhere?

108
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:59,376
Drop us before we get into sensor range.
We'll check it out in a Jumper.

109
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:01,525
- That's not the plan.
- We can go in cloaked,

110
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,736
stay in touch on a secure channel.

111
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,780
If it's what Todd says it is,
you can come in guns blazing.

112
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:10,221
All right.
Just be careful.

113
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,451
Almost in range.

114
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:24,920
Engaging cloak.

115
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:28,879
All right,
we're getting readings now.

116
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:30,944
It's a Hive, all right.

117
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,532
- What?
- I'm reading

118
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:36,352
higher than normal energy output.

119
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:39,271
- I mean, significantly higher.
- Consistent with a ZPM?

120
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,773
It's hard to say from this far out.

121
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:45,910
- Sheppard, what's your status?
- <i>We getting some interesting readings,</i>

122
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:48,410
<i>so we're going to go in
for a closer look.</i>

123
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:57,165
- I'm detecting massive energy output.
- What's happening?

124
00:06:57,975 --> 00:06:59,201
It's growing.

125
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:02,476
What are you talking about?

126
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:05,039
They're using the surplus energy
to grow a larger,

127
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:08,847
and if I'm reading this correctly,
significantly denser outer hull.

128
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:12,159
Look, it makes sense.
Normal Hives have a limit of growth.

129
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:14,914
Any bigger or heavier,
and they become impossible to maneuver,

130
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,601
let alone get into hyperspace.

131
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,020
You make a left turn,
and you're torn apart by inertia,

132
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,563
- but with a ZPM...
- What does that mean for us?

133
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,203
When they're done,

134
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:26,110
my guess is that hull will be all
but impenetrable.

135
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:31,032
All right, well, better take 'em out
of the picture before they get that far.

136
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:35,495
Hold on,
they're... powering weapons.

137
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:40,416
- They can't see us, right?
- No, of course not.

138
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,491
They must be just running a test.

139
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,787
Holy crap.

140
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:50,641
What are the odds of them randomly
firing a test shot directly at us?

141
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:53,721
I would say, given the enormity
of the empty space, non-existent?

142
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:56,751
They can see us.

143
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,519
They're probably increasing
the sensitivity of their scanners.

144
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:07,150
Let me guess,
something to do with the ZPM.

145
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,422
Probably.

146
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:11,414
<i>Daedalus, we've got a problem.</i>

147
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:13,100
<i>Our cloak's ineffective.</i>

148
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,560
We're on our way.
Take us in, maximum sublight.

149
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:17,536
- Shields up.
- Yes, Sir.

150
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:27,505
- I'm dropping the cloak.
- Not to mention you could fire back.

151
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,465
One thing at a time, Rodney.

152
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,477
We're hit!

153
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:42,728
- I've lost controls.
- I'll work out a bypass.

154
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:45,272
They get a bead on us, Rodney,
we're dead.

155
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:58,376
It worked, sir.

156
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:00,451
We blocked the shot.
Shield is holding.

157
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:03,187
All right, now return fire,
main battery, full power.

158
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:04,405
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,299
Direct hit.

160
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:13,384
- Damage?
- Minimal.

161
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:16,012
Ready missiles.
Throw everything we have.

162
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,222
Sir, I'm reading
a massive energy buildup.

163
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:27,523
Brace for impact!

164
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,034
Shields are down!

165
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:41,344
Heavy damage on all decks.
We've lost hyperdrive and main weapons.

166
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:43,580
Evasive maneuvers!
We can't take another hit.

167
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,373
You should have flight controls.

168
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:47,375
- What about weapons?
- Not a chance.

169
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,155
Something's happening.

170
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,932
It doesn't make any sense.
Our main systems were down,

171
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:10,124
these guys had us dead-to-rights.
Why would they just fly away?

172
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:12,808
Perhaps because they knew
we were no longer a threat.

173
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:15,111
It's not like the Wraith
to be so charitable.

174
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:17,691
Todd said the ship
isn't finished, right?

175
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:20,132
They haven't adapted
the full potential of the ZPM.

176
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:22,439
- Maybe they maxed them out.
- If that's the case,

177
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:24,937
I'd hate to meet up with them
when they do finish it.

178
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:28,039
We need to get back to Atlantis.
What's the prognosis on the hyperdrive?

179
00:10:28,164 --> 00:10:30,938
Control systems are completely shot.
My guys are working on a patch,

180
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,498
but it could be days, even weeks
before we're back online.

181
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:35,872
For the moment,
we're not going anywhere.

182
00:10:35,997 --> 00:10:37,493
- Sir...
- What is it, Marks?

183
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:39,573
I think we may have something.

184
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:48,437
Kavanaugh?
What the hell are you doing here?

185
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:51,749
Reassignment. More fun and adventure
in the Pegasus galaxy.

186
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:54,525
- Show us what you've got, please.
- It's a subspace signal.

187
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:57,622
We detected it just before
the Hive jumped into hyperspace.

188
00:10:57,747 --> 00:11:00,881
It was weak. Luckily,
I happened to be monitoring the sensor,

189
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:02,866
or we might not have
picked it up at all.

190
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:05,578
- It's a Wraith code.
- Obviously.

191
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:08,326
We're having trouble
because the message is interlaced

192
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:11,125
with a residual radiation,
and I've never seen it before.

193
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,822
I have.
Once, when we met another me,

194
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:16,712
and once when we encountered
another Daedalus.

195
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:18,883
This signal was sent
from another reality.

196
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:20,843
I'm sorry,
what are you talking about?

197
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:24,263
Look, some Wraith, somewhere
in another reality, sent a coded signal,

198
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:27,226
only whatever means they used
to access subspace created a rift,

199
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:31,146
allowing the signal to cross into
multiple realities, including our own.

200
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:32,605
So, what does it say?

201
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,775
Just give me a second.
Move.

202
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:42,385
Great.

203
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:44,121
What is it?

204
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:46,120
It's a set of coordinates.

205
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:47,745
Coordinates to what?

206
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:49,691
Earth.

207
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:57,943
You think the Hive
picked up the signal?

208
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:00,935
Why else would they leave like that?
It can't be a coincidence.

209
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,373
The Wraith know that Earth
is a richer feeding ground.

210
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:06,124
They've been looking it for years.

211
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:08,683
As soon as com are back up,
we'll contact Atlantis,

212
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:11,624
- have them relay a message to SGC.
- Wait a minute, I've got an idea.

213
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:15,439
- How many ships do we have available?
- There's the Apollo and the Sun Tzu.

214
00:12:15,564 --> 00:12:17,370
- And the Odyssey?
- On secret mission

215
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:19,986
- I'm not supposed to know about.
- Two will have to be enough.

216
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:22,815
- What are you suggesting?
- That Hive may be super-powerful,

217
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,874
but it has to drop out of hyperspace
at some point for hull regeneration.

218
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:30,454
I can use the sensor data
to extrapolate where that will be.

219
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,870
- It's risky. If you're wrong...
- I won't be.

220
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:35,311
We can't afford to wait
till they get to Earth.

221
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:39,237
My guess is that, by that point,
they'll be fully adapted to the ZPM.

222
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:41,421
Do it.

223
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:50,314
Sir, the Daedalus
just dropped out of hyperspace.

224
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:51,743
It's about time.

225
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:54,599
Colonel Sheppard and his team
are beaming down.

226
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:00,501
Colonel, it's good to finally
have you all back.

227
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,032
What did we miss?

228
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,249
There's no indication of any other
Wraith ships heading for the milky way.

229
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:08,878
It's as I figured. That signal
was too short and too weak.

230
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:12,122
That ship only detected it because of
its obvious improvements to the sensors.

231
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:13,540
What's the bad news?

232
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:15,483
Show them.

233
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:20,811
This is a subspace message sent by
Colonel Ellis, from onboard the Apollo.

234
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:24,782
<i>We've engaged the Hive,
unfortunately without much success.</i>

235
00:13:25,185 --> 00:13:26,678
<i>The Sun Tzu is crippled,</i>

236
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:29,598
<i>and she's venting atmosphere.</i>

237
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,437
<i>We're in the process
of taking on her crew now,</i>

238
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,186
<i>but unfortunately,
with my engines down,</i>

239
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,539
<i>I won't be able to get to the nearest
Stargate for at least a month.</i>

240
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,025
<i>As for the enemy,</i>

241
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:43,686
<i>all indications are that they received
very little damage,</i>

242
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:47,048
<i>and are continuing
on their previous course.</i>

243
00:13:47,946 --> 00:13:50,549
With those two ships
out of the picture,

244
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:53,058
nothing stands between that Hive

245
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,060
and Earth.

-1
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,452
- There you are. I've been thinking...
- So have I.

0
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:09,936
- Another ship can help defend Earth.
- We're standing on it.

1
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,501
- The City, exactly! The only problem...
- ZPMs.

2
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:15,055
But if we want to get there in time,
we need a full complement.

3
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,228
Where do you think
I'm headed, Rodney?

4
00:14:20,055 --> 00:14:20,955
Right...

5
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:25,054
Well...

6
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,011
Things didn't go exactly
according to plan.

7
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:29,302
So I heard.

8
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:31,319
You intend to hold me responsible?

9
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,975
All I know is everything went sideways,
as always when you're involved.

10
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,624
You're going to tell me
that's a coincidence?

11
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:40,455
Then you've come to make good
on your threat.

12
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:49,177
The other ZPMs you talked
to Woolsey about...

13
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:52,639
tell us where to get them,
and maybe it'll improve your situation.

14
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,477
Am I supposed to be enticed
by this offer?

15
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,062
No, I'll probably kill you anyway,
but don't forget

16
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:04,609
this Wraith betrayed you
and got away with it.

17
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:07,946
For no other reason, you might
want to do it out of pure spite.

18
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:12,779
You know how to talk to me,

19
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:14,034
John Sheppard.

20
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:20,993
We got 'em.

21
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,676
He actually came through for us.

22
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,467
Maybe he's turning over a new leaf.

23
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,619
Get these down
to Zelenka immediately.

24
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:38,370
Or maybe they're going to blow up
when you plug them in.

25
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:41,993
- Have Dr. McKay check them first.
- Right.

26
00:15:42,978 --> 00:15:44,681
All right, I'm heading
to the chair room.

27
00:15:44,806 --> 00:15:46,193
Actually, Colonel,

28
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:48,742
you won't be flying the City for us.

29
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:51,211
In fact, you won't be coming
with us at all.

30
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,029
What are you talking about?

31
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:56,784
You have a half an hour to pack,
and then you'll be gating back to Earth.

32
00:15:57,493 --> 00:16:00,678
Even with the ZPMs, there's still a good
chance we won't get there in time,

33
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:04,151
and Earth's only other line of defense
is the Ancient weapons platform.

34
00:16:04,743 --> 00:16:06,954
General O'Neill
wants you in the chair.

35
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:09,766
Good luck.

36
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,422
Yeah, you too.

37
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,690
- Colonel Sheppard.
- Colonel Carter.

38
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:33,076
It's good to see you again, John.

39
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,249
All right, I've finished
recalibration on the chair.

40
00:16:37,374 --> 00:16:38,992
Radek, how are things at your end?

41
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:41,235
<i>ZPMs are online
and functioning, 100%.</i>

42
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,432
<i>We're good to go.</i>

43
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:45,501
- Okay, who's flying this puppy?
- That would be me.

44
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:49,492
They called you in for this?

45
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,456
You must have
a higher CIA than I thought.

46
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:54,385
- Excuse me?
- Chair interface aptitude.

47
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:56,387
Well, apparently,
I'm number two.

48
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:58,765
Really?
I'll have a look into that.

49
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,592
Thanks
for the vote of confidence.

50
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:02,434
Oh, I'm sure you'll do fine.

51
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,430
Great.

52
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,054
I suppose I'm ready.

53
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:14,431
Raise the shield.

54
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:18,159
Take us out.

55
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,306
So you're in command here, huh?

56
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:59,055
Only until General Landry gets back.

57
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,674
He's heading up
a task force in Washington.

58
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,537
My next position is to take command
of our new Daedalus-class ship.

59
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,166
The Phoenix?

60
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:09,804
Actually, we're renaming it.

61
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:11,003
The General Hammond.

62
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,306
Oh, yeah.

63
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:15,841
I heard about that.
Sorry it was kind of sudden.

64
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:18,928
Heart attack.
I was off-world at the time.

65
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:22,806
- He was a good man.
- He really was.

66
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,053
So, what's next?

67
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:28,082
C-130 to McMurdo?

68
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,840
Not exactly.

69
00:18:40,182 --> 00:18:42,806
Colonel Sheppard, this is Major Davis,
Homeworld security.

70
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:45,878
- What are we looking at?
- The Hive ship.

71
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:48,874
It dropped out of hyperspace
and established orbit around the Moon.

72
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:51,743
You've got to be kidding me.
It's not supposed to be here for weeks.

73
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:53,837
Evidently,
this is no ordinary Hive ship.

74
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:55,533
Yeah, that much I know.

75
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,467
- What's it doing?
- For the moment,

76
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:01,012
- nothing.
- The best we can guess is

77
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,931
it's completing its ZPM upgrades
prior to launching an attack.

78
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,680
Then we got to make a move first.
You got any F-302s?

79
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:09,067
We have a squadron on permanent
stand-by with Earth defense,

80
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:11,802
but they aren't outfitted for anything
more than fighter interception.

81
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:14,479
- There's no way they could take...
- How long to fit 'em with nukes?

82
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:18,166
Well, that could take some doing.

83
00:19:19,403 --> 00:19:20,755
I'll get right on it.

84
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:24,951
These pilots have any experience
fighting the Wraith?

85
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:26,661
That's not why I brought you here.

86
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:28,681
I could sit in the chair
and wait,

87
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:30,875
or take the fight to them.
What do you want to do?

88
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,937
- You wanted to see us.
- Yes, come in, please.

89
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:56,708
I wanted the opportunity
to offer you both

90
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,736
one last chance to reconsider.

91
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,154
Reconsider what?

92
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:02,573
Your involvement in this mission.

93
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:06,555
I'm told we're about to pass
the outer edge of the Pegasus galaxy.

94
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:09,872
If you wish to be dropped off,
now would be the time.

95
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:14,087
We've all grown so accustomed
to having you here,

96
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:15,580
as part of the team,

97
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,294
it's easy to lose sight of the fact

98
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:21,234
that your priorities
are not necessarily

99
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,135
always the same as ours.

100
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,262
You're being asked to fly
to another galaxy,

101
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:29,266
to take what might turn out to be
the losing part

102
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:31,644
in a battle that isn't yours.

103
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:35,817
Do you mean like everyone on this base
has been doing for the last five years?

104
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:38,437
Thank you for your consideration,
Mr. Woolsey,

105
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:40,653
but I assure you
it is not necessary.

106
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,988
We're not going anywhere.

107
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,574
Very well.

108
00:21:05,437 --> 00:21:07,930
All right, looks like
we're ready to go.

109
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:11,241
There's been a change of plans.
I'm afraid the re-fit took too long.

110
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:13,190
The Hive's still in lunar orbit,

111
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,115
but we've detected
an inbound wave of darts.

112
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,552
Guess they got tired of waiting.
Any idea where the target is?

113
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,398
The Wraith message we intercepted

114
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:21,870
contained a warning about
Earth's defensive capabilities,

115
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:23,555
specifically the drone chair.

116
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,072
Only in the alternate reality
where the message came from,

117
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:28,408
it looks like the chair
had been moved to Area 51.

118
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:31,489
- That's where they're headed?
- We believe so.

119
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,433
Well, evacuate the base,
let 'em hit it,

120
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,879
when they bring the Hive down,
we'll take 'em out from Antarctica.

121
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:39,805
Right?

122
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,298
- Sorry, I was gonna tell you this...
- Tell me what?

123
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:46,842
The chair was in violation of
the Antarctic non-proliferation treaty.

124
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:48,877
After lengthy
international negotiations,

125
00:21:49,002 --> 00:21:51,947
they finally moved it
just less than a month ago.

126
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:54,851
Where?

127
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,635
Area 51.

128
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:11,841
They're entering the atmosphere now.

129
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:13,870
Should be showing up
on the screens momentarily.

130
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:15,914
<i>All right, we got 'em, 12:00 high,</i>

131
00:22:16,082 --> 00:22:18,000
<i>range eight kilometers
and closing fast.</i>

132
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,752
You are cleared to engage.
Good hunting, Colonel.

133
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,802
They're outnumbered.

134
00:22:34,927 --> 00:22:37,936
They'll never be able to keep
them all from getting through.

135
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:45,944
Sheppard, two darts have disengaged.
They're headed for the deck.

136
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,780
<i>I'm on it.
Riggs, you're with me.</i>

137
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,719
<i>Two more on our 6:00!</i>

138
00:23:08,613 --> 00:23:09,613
<i>Dammit.</i>

139
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:28,270
- The darts are coming in too fast.
- It's a kamikaze run.

140
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:44,071
<i>Come on, baby...</i>

141
00:24:06,684 --> 00:24:09,477
<i>Stargate Command, this is Sheppard.</i>

142
00:24:11,707 --> 00:24:13,656
<i>Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?</i>

143
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:15,909
It was a nice try.
There was just too many of them.

144
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:18,651
The chair's been destroyed.

145
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:34,636
- Sheppard, what are you doing?
<i>- I've got an idea.</i>

146
00:24:34,804 --> 00:24:36,915
He's climbing,
he's heading into the upper atmosphere.

147
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,264
Sheppard, your orders
are to return to the base.

148
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:42,476
<i>I've still got a nuke.
I'm going to finish this mission.</i>

149
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:44,917
You don't have enough fuel.
You'll never make it to the hive.

150
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:46,980
<i>He got what he wanted.
He's going to come to us.</i>

151
00:24:47,105 --> 00:24:49,651
He's right. The Hive ship has
changed course. They're on their way.

152
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:51,679
<i>I've got enough fuel
to establish orbit,</i>

153
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:54,038
<i>then I'll shut everything down
except basic life support.</i>

154
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:56,366
<i>That way, he won't detect me
till it's too late.</i>

155
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:59,328
Even if that does work,
given what we know about this ship,

156
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:02,729
- one nuke is not going to be enough.
- <i>No, not from the outside.</i>

157
00:25:03,178 --> 00:25:05,703
<i>I'll wait for him to enter orbit,
I'll fire up my systems,</i>

158
00:25:05,828 --> 00:25:07,443
<i>shoot my way through
a dart bay door,</i>

159
00:25:07,568 --> 00:25:09,481
<i>and fly the damn bomb
right down his throat.</i>

160
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:11,923
<i>Then I'll detonate from the inside.</i>

161
00:25:13,918 --> 00:25:17,167
- John, I can't ask you to do that.
<i>- You're not asking, I'm volunteering.</i>

162
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:19,443
<i>Look, without that chair,</i>

163
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:22,225
<i>Earth is basically
defenseless, right?</i>

164
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:26,856
<i>Right.</i>

165
00:25:27,212 --> 00:25:29,482
<i>Commencing radio silence,
Sheppard out.</i>

166
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,747
- What happened?
- We dropped out of hyperspace.

167
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,967
- Don't tell me we're there already.
- Not even close.

168
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:43,457
- We're on the edge of the Milky Way.
- So why did we drop out?

169
00:25:43,582 --> 00:25:45,294
Well, obviously, we...

170
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,472
We're not sure.

171
00:25:46,597 --> 00:25:49,337
The hyperdrive hasn't been operated
at full power in over 10,000 years.

172
00:25:49,462 --> 00:25:51,665
- Not surprising there are glitches.
- But you can fix it?

173
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,756
I have to figure out
what's wrong first, don't I?

174
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,980
Zelenka, in the meantime, recalibrate
our Gate position so we can dial Earth.

175
00:25:58,105 --> 00:25:59,043
Right away.

176
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:01,524
We have to apprise them
of our situation.

177
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:17,661
What's our status?

178
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:20,103
The Hive ship has almost
reached Earth orbit.

179
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:21,854
They've begun scanning us.

180
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:24,040
- Any word from Sheppard?
- Not yet.

181
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,729
According to my best estimates
of his trajectory,

182
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:29,791
his orbit won't intersect with
the Hive's for another 20 minutes.

183
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,533
If he fires up too early...

184
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:34,172
They'll detect his presence
and send out darts to intercept.

185
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:35,892
He wouldn't stand a chance.

186
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:38,339
- Excuse me, Colonel...
- What is it, Walter?

187
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,642
We've tried to dial up the Alpha site,
to send through those IOA dignitaries?

188
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:42,805
Good old IOA,

189
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,515
courageous to the end.

190
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,816
- What's the problem?
- We can't establish a lock,

191
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,648
and it's not just the Alpha site, I've
already tried a couple of alternates,

192
00:26:50,773 --> 00:26:54,025
but for some reason,
the Gate's offline.

193
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:08,501
Open a channel.

194
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,865
Stargate Command, this is Atlantis.

195
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:16,681
Stargate Command,
this is Atlantis, do you read?

196
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:19,729
Comm system is operating, sir.
They're just not responding.

197
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:21,344
Okay, this is weird.

198
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,764
I'm picking up an energy signature
feeding back through the wormhole.

199
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:25,890
It's Wraith.

200
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,640
- The Wraith are at Stargate Command?
- No, these readings are more like

201
00:27:29,765 --> 00:27:31,853
something you'd pick up
in the middle of a Hive.

202
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:33,562
But we dialed Earth.

203
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:36,642
- You don't think that...
- Standard Wraith procedure.

204
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:38,853
Keep your victims from dialing out.

205
00:27:38,978 --> 00:27:41,405
- What are you talking about?
- There's a Gate on the Hive.

206
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,674
The Wraith always
try to block the Gate

207
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,852
of a planet they're attacking,
usually by dialing in.

208
00:27:46,977 --> 00:27:49,063
They couldn't do that,
so they found another solution.

209
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:52,165
You see, when two Gates are in
proximity, one supersedes the other.

210
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,104
Usually, it's the default Gate, unless
it happens to be a Milky Way model,

211
00:27:55,229 --> 00:27:58,164
- and the other one's from Pegasus.
- It was the same on the midway station.

212
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:01,842
We had to create a workaround to prevent
the Pegasus Gate from taking precedence.

-1
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:05,596
You're telling me that wormhole...

0
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:07,802
Leads directly onto the Hive.

1
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:25,585
Think that cleared the way?

2
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,610
There's one way to find out.

3
00:28:34,252 --> 00:28:36,270
<i>The guards at the Gate
have been neutralized.</i>

4
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:37,695
<i>We're moving on.</i>

5
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,740
I should have sent
more marines with them.

6
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:45,668
A full-scale assault
wouldn't have accomplished anything.

7
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:49,084
To sabotage key systems on that Hive,
they're going to need speed and stealth.

8
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:50,147
Maybe.

9
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:53,212
I just hate being stuck out here
not able to do anything.

10
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:55,688
That's something I've been wanting
to talk to you about.

11
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,516
This is something that Rodney
has been working on for quite some time.

12
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:03,647
An adaptation of an Ancient technology
abandoned because of instability

13
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:06,898
- and enormous power requirements.
- What is it?

14
00:29:07,544 --> 00:29:10,270
Wormhole drive.
It's nearly instantaneous travel

15
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:11,996
across enormous distances.

16
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:14,235
It's not unlike Gate travel itself.

17
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,760
If it works,

18
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:18,216
it could have us at Earth
in a matter of seconds.

19
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:21,146
Now, the calculations
are incredibly complex.

20
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:24,917
If we're off even by a fraction...
It could be very bad.

21
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:35,911
<i>All right, I'd say
it's time to get moving.</i>

22
00:30:02,089 --> 00:30:04,631
- Is there another way around?
- I think so!

23
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:05,966
Go, go, go!

24
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:07,926
This way!

25
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,991
They hit his lung.
He's bleeding out.

26
00:30:58,876 --> 00:30:59,961
Just go.

27
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:03,782
We are not leaving without you.

28
00:31:21,794 --> 00:31:24,670
Come on, we've gotta get outta here now!
Let's go, let's go!

29
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,803
<i>SGC, this is Sheppard, come in.</i>

30
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:36,060
- Sheppard, where are you?
- I made it inside.

31
00:31:37,037 --> 00:31:40,227
Look, I don't have much time before
this place is swarming with Wraith,

32
00:31:41,396 --> 00:31:42,960
<i>so I'm arming the nuke.</i>

33
00:31:43,085 --> 00:31:45,023
<i>Just do me a favor.
When Atlantis shows up,</i>

34
00:31:46,586 --> 00:31:48,318
tell 'em I said goodbye.

35
00:32:00,588 --> 00:32:02,729
<i>SGC, this is Sheppard, come in.</i>

36
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:06,699
<i>Look, I don't have much time before
this place is swarming with Wraith,</i>

37
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,123
<i>so I'm arming the nuke.</i>

38
00:32:08,248 --> 00:32:11,340
- Did he say "nuke?"
- <i>When Atlantis shows up,</i>

39
00:32:12,546 --> 00:32:15,409
- tell 'em I said goodbye.
- Sheppard, this is McKay.

40
00:32:15,624 --> 00:32:18,223
Look, stop what you're doing now!

41
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:20,684
Yes, it's me, Lorne and Teyla,
we're onboard the hive.

42
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:21,859
What?

43
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:23,103
How?

44
00:32:23,272 --> 00:32:24,771
Look, it's a long story.

45
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:28,233
Just, if you're about to do
what I think you're gonna do, don't.

46
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:31,778
This Hive is about to attack Earth.
I don't have much of a choice.

47
00:32:31,947 --> 00:32:35,282
Look, just wait. We'll come to you,
I can rig up a remote detonator.

48
00:32:35,451 --> 00:32:38,743
What good's that going to do for us?
We can't get off this ship, Rodney.

49
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:41,558
That's where you're wrong.
This way.

50
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,505
We're about to fire up
the wormhole drive.

51
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,742
If it works, we could find ourselves
in the middle of a combat situation

52
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:57,220
rather suddenly.
You and your staff need to be ready.

53
00:32:57,389 --> 00:32:58,680
And if it doesn't?

54
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:01,804
From what I'm told...

55
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:05,028
The City would be
instantly vaporized.

56
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:24,631
You guys are the last people
I expected to see on this ship.

57
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:26,653
Same here. Give me a minute.

58
00:33:30,797 --> 00:33:32,124
Where's Ronon?

59
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:35,267
Teyla, where's Ronon?

60
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:37,455
I'm sorry, John.

61
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,774
I restored your life, human,

62
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,551
and bound your wound.

63
00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:57,447
That was real nice of you.

64
00:33:58,206 --> 00:34:00,662
Now you will answer my questions.

65
00:34:05,414 --> 00:34:06,998
Hive has completed surface scan.

66
00:34:07,563 --> 00:34:10,125
They'll target military installations,
then the power grid,

67
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,298
send the population into a panic.

68
00:34:12,423 --> 00:34:14,214
Then they'll launch the Darts.

69
00:34:14,448 --> 00:34:16,508
How many humans are on my ship?

70
00:34:23,391 --> 00:34:24,796
Where are they?

71
00:34:30,748 --> 00:34:32,374
How you doing, Chewie?

72
00:34:33,248 --> 00:34:34,448
You were dead!

73
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,921
We're all going to be dead
unless we get outta here.

74
00:34:41,354 --> 00:34:42,434
That's it.

75
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:44,623
They're powering weapons.

76
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:46,412
Sheppard, what's your status?

77
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,498
We got Ronon,
we're headed for the Gate.

78
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,333
- How much time?
- <i>Five minutes,</i>

79
00:34:50,501 --> 00:34:53,558
five minutes to recalibrate the DHD
for local coordinates.

80
00:34:53,683 --> 00:34:54,683
10 minutes.

81
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:59,300
I'm sorry, the Hive is powering weapons.
We're out of time.

82
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:04,687
Understood.

83
00:35:08,436 --> 00:35:11,308
- Give me the detonator.
- Yeah, but we're almost there.

84
00:35:11,433 --> 00:35:13,372
Did I say five minutes
to recalibrate the DHD?

85
00:35:13,497 --> 00:35:15,197
I- I meant two minutes.

86
00:35:28,803 --> 00:35:29,831
<i>John, wait!</i>

87
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,011
<i>We're detecting another ship.</i>

88
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:44,345
Now would be the time, Doctor.

89
00:35:46,414 --> 00:35:47,531
Understood.

90
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,079
<i>It's Atlantis!
They're engaging the Hive!</i>

91
00:36:01,277 --> 00:36:04,359
That might give us enough time
to get to the Gate.

92
00:36:09,098 --> 00:36:10,371
The Hive is returning fire.

93
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:21,507
Shields are down to 70%.

94
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:24,802
Keep firing, Dr. Beckett!

95
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,260
- Get to work, Rodney.
- I'm on it.

96
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,270
We got company!

97
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:50,185
The force of enemy weapons fire
has pushed us into a lower orbit.

98
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,955
- We're skimming the atmosphere.
- It's draining the shield, Sir.

99
00:36:53,524 --> 00:36:55,333
Dr. Beckett,
can you adjust our course?

100
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:57,836
I don't have enough power.
I can keep firing or pull us up,

101
00:36:57,961 --> 00:36:59,086
which is it gonna be?

102
00:37:01,558 --> 00:37:02,882
Keep firing, Dr. Beckett.

103
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,683
- How's it coming, Rodney?
- I got it!

104
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:20,441
I'm dialing the alpha site now!

105
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:30,201
Shields are about to collapse.
We can't take another hit.

106
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:36,848
All right, let's move!

107
00:38:08,623 --> 00:38:09,723
They did it.

108
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:11,995
The Hive has been destroyed.

109
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,453
Atlantis, this is SGC, well done.

110
00:38:14,623 --> 00:38:17,289
Thanks for the kind words, Colonel,
but I wouldn't pop the champagne.

111
00:38:18,114 --> 00:38:20,543
We've lost orbit, and Dr. Beckett
is unable to compensate.

112
00:38:20,668 --> 00:38:21,599
We're going in.

113
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:23,569
Do you have enough shield
to survive re-entry?

114
00:38:25,685 --> 00:38:27,341
We're about to find out.

115
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,694
Atlantis, this is SGC, do you read?

116
00:38:53,061 --> 00:38:53,951
Colonel...

117
00:38:54,437 --> 00:38:56,311
We've been monitoring radio chatter.

118
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:58,177
Several vessels in the North Pacific

119
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:01,473
have reported a giant fireball
streaking across the sky.

120
00:39:02,562 --> 00:39:05,004
Atlantis, this is SGC, do you read?

121
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,766
Atlantis, this is SGC,
please respond.

122
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:16,186
<i>SGC, this is Atlantis.</i>

123
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,624
<i>Nice to hear from you again,
Colonel.</i>

124
00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:20,873
Mr. Woolsey,
you gave us quite a scare.

125
00:39:20,998 --> 00:39:22,146
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

126
00:39:28,819 --> 00:39:32,072
We've completed our re-entry,
and we're still in one piece.

127
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,248
Dr. Beckett thinks
he can bring us in over water,

128
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,652
but you might wanna alert the Navy.

129
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,620
It's gonna be close.

130
00:39:38,874 --> 00:39:39,980
Understood.

131
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:42,669
We are tracking them again.

132
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:44,918
We should be able to project

133
00:39:45,276 --> 00:39:47,406
coordinates for splashdown.

134
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:51,311
Walter, you'd better get me
the president.

135
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:53,886
It looks like
Atlantis is coming home.

136
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,675
- Well, how you feeling?
- I'm ready to get outta here.

137
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,688
Take your time.
The City's pretty banged up.

138
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:04,998
Even with the ZPMs,
we're not going anywhere for a while.

139
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:06,304
And when they fix it,

140
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:09,260
you really think they're gonna let us
take it back to Pegasus?

141
00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:11,399
I'll make sure you get home.

142
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:13,773
This is my home.

143
00:40:16,182 --> 00:40:17,534
Am I interrupting?

144
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:23,809
No, I was just leaving.

145
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:33,926
I heard you died
and came back to life.

146
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:36,349
Pretty much.

147
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:37,999
There's...

148
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,891
there's a few things
I still need to do.

149
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,061
You up for taking a walk?

150
00:40:45,499 --> 00:40:47,770
- I don't see why not.
- Good.

151
00:40:48,957 --> 00:40:50,692
There's something you should see.

152
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:56,823
So, all is well.
Your homeworld was saved,

153
00:40:57,185 --> 00:40:59,226
you and your friends survived,

154
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:02,663
and all thanks
to my zero-point modules.

155
00:41:02,832 --> 00:41:03,982
That's right.

156
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,250
Question is,
what would happen next time?

157
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:11,293
Is there going to be a next time?

158
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:21,498
You have room for two more?

159
00:41:21,623 --> 00:41:22,623
Of course.

160
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:26,349
Welcome to Earth.

161
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:31,625
No one can see us, right?

162
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:35,487
We managed to activate the cloak
before we came in too close.

163
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:37,948
This entire area
is under naval quarantine.

164
00:41:38,988 --> 00:41:40,826
So this is where everyone went, huh?

165
00:41:45,872 --> 00:41:46,872
You okay?

166
00:41:47,373 --> 00:41:48,373
I'm alive,

167
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:51,974
and I've got you.

168
00:41:52,435 --> 00:41:53,713
What else do I need?

169
00:41:57,386 --> 00:41:58,374
Nice view.

170
00:42:01,499 --> 00:42:02,499
Yes, it is.
