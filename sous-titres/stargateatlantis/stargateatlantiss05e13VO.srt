1
00:00:01,645 --> 00:00:04,883
As you may've already heard,
we've received an invitation.

2
00:00:05,587 --> 00:00:08,905
Or, more precisely,
your team has received an invitation,

3
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:11,439
to represent Atlantis
at a meeting of leaders

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,197
from various human populations
throughout the Pegasus galaxy.

5
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:18,547
What's this, a Pegasus version
of the United Nations?

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,755
Nothing quite so formal.

7
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,853
At the moment,
it's more of a loose coalition.

8
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:26,014
Is there any advanced technology
in this coalition?

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,256
No.

10
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:29,982
But the IOA believes
it could be an important first step

11
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:32,156
toward interplanetary government.

12
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:34,912
A federation, if you will.

13
00:00:35,073 --> 00:00:36,781
The Federation had ships.

14
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:40,146
What do we hope to gain from this?
They only know about each other

15
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:42,986
because they happened to inherit
the Gate system from the Ancients.

16
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:44,760
Just because they lack advancement

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,081
does not mean
they cannot benefit from cooperation.

18
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:48,218
She's right.

19
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:51,388
It's about time people got together
and stood up for themselves.

20
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:52,931
Against the Wraith.

21
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:54,036
Why not?

22
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:56,137
The Wraith are at war
with each other,

23
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:59,849
which is why the people trying to form
this coalition feel the time is right.

24
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,241
And they want us to be part of it.

25
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:29,158
The Council liaison
will be with you in a moment.

26
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:34,156
They're really
rolling the red carpet out for us.

27
00:01:34,276 --> 00:01:36,975
I'm sure they're just trying to keep
the details of this meeting a secret.

28
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:39,477
Guys?

29
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:40,999
Not good.

30
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:02,574
Season 5 Episode 13
Inquisition (v. 1.00)

31
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,592
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

32
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:08,465
www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

33
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:31,272
Where are we?

34
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:36,075
We're not in the same room.
We've been moved.

35
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,330
What's up? What happened?

36
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:42,185
That's a good question.

37
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,798
- What is the meaning of this?
- It will all be explained shortly.

38
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,073
The Council wishes to speak
to Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.

39
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,485
I am Kelore of Latira.

40
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:13,446
This is Shiana
of the tribes of Santhal,

41
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:16,066
and Dimas
of the free peoples of Riva.

42
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:17,867
We speak on behalf of the coalition.

43
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,069
If you wanted
to keep this location secret,

44
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:24,177
you could have just blindfolded me.
I wouldn't have peeked, I swear.

45
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:27,377
Lt. Colonel John Sheppard,
you stand before this council

46
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:29,754
as a representative
of the Atlantis expedition.

47
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,509
And as such, it falls to you
to answer the charges.

48
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:36,844
Excuse me?

49
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:39,764
You will be given ample opportunity
to present your defense,

50
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,100
and when all evidence is heard,

51
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,161
we will decide the outcome.

52
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:47,564
What the hell are you talking about?
What is this?

53
00:03:48,123 --> 00:03:50,838
The Atlantis expedition
has been accused of crimes

54
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,944
against the peoples of this galaxy.

55
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:55,442
This is your trial.

56
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,040
- Major, what happened?
- We're trying to figure that out, sir.

57
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:09,462
One thing's for sure,
they're not in the village anymore.

58
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,128
They wouldn't have gone anywhere else
without notifying us first.

59
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:13,749
Not voluntarily, no.

60
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:17,552
Take as many men as you need.
Search the entire area.

61
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:20,010
And keep questioning the villagers.

62
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,229
Somebody there knows something.

63
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,692
This was supposed
to be a meet-and-greet.

64
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:29,606
Just cocktails, <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>,
maybe a little dancing?

65
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:31,886
Subterfuge was necessary.

66
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:34,315
You possess technology
and military power

67
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:37,113
beyond the scope of most of
the indigenous peoples of this galaxy.

68
00:04:37,864 --> 00:04:39,866
Which is why you are
in a secure location.

69
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:43,440
Only the members of this council
and key personnel know the Gate address.

70
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,440
So don't waste your time
entertaining any hopes of rescue.

71
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,811
What is it exactly
that you think we did?

72
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:50,418
According to our calculations,

73
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:54,201
the Atlantis expedition is responsible,
directly or indirectly,

74
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:57,363
for the deaths of over
two million people in this galaxy.

75
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:59,086
You've gotta be kidding me.

76
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:01,930
Tell us about your first encounter
with the Wraith.

77
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:08,891
- I see where this is going.
- When you arrived here,

78
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:11,397
the Wraith were in hibernation,
were they not?

79
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,192
- Not all of them.
- What do you mean?

80
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,944
I mean they attacked us.

81
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,467
What is it?

82
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,167
The Wraith!

83
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:49,686
Take that thing down!

84
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:54,375
That's one.

85
00:05:58,467 --> 00:05:59,486
Get down!

86
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:07,996
That was a scouting party,
not a culling.

87
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:11,165
Well, I didn't know that.
All I know is they took our people.

88
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:13,137
- And you went after them.
- That's right.

89
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:14,460
You should left them.

90
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,588
I'm sure that's what you would've done,
but that's not how we operate.

91
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,173
What happened?

92
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,624
We went in,

93
00:06:20,744 --> 00:06:24,415
we rescued as many people
as we could, then we got out.

94
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,348
But not before encountering a queen.

95
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,736
How did this come to you?

96
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:42,388
I don't remember.

97
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:51,414
Light it up!

98
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:02,157
That has to kill you.

99
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:06,340
Sir, let's go.

100
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,330
You don't know what you have done.

101
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:13,049
We are merely the caretakers

102
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:15,014
for those that sleep.

103
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,310
When I die,

104
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:20,188
the others will awaken...

105
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:25,750
all of them.

106
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,328
What's she talking about?

107
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:38,005
How many are left?

108
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,894
So you admit it.
You woke the Wraith.

109
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:58,324
Look, sooner or later, they were gonna
wake up on their own anyway.

110
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,143
But not for generations.

111
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:01,651
You see, Colonel,

112
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:04,343
most of the human populations
of this galaxy

113
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:07,073
have not yet fully recovered
from the last round of cullings.

114
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,368
As a result of this early awakening,
several worlds have been driven

115
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:13,363
to the point of extinction...
Their survivors scattered,

116
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:15,081
their civilizations lost forever.

117
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:17,914
We're out there fighting the Wraith,
day after day,

118
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:20,851
- putting our asses on the line.
- But the fact remains,

119
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:23,297
many who have been killed
would be alive today

120
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:25,508
if you had never come here.
Isn't that true?

121
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:27,769
That's it, I'm not playing
in this game anymore.

122
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:30,346
This is just the first
of many charges.

123
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,682
If you refuse to participate,

124
00:08:32,842 --> 00:08:35,309
it'll be taken as an admission
of guilt on all counts,

125
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:37,395
and we will proceed to sentencing.

126
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:40,189
What are you going to do?
Put everybody in Atlantis in jail?

127
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:43,499
Obviously that's not possible.

128
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,779
However, we can refuse cooperation.

129
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:50,116
That means no more trade,
no more relations of any kind.

130
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:52,660
Atlantis
will be completely isolated.

131
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,633
No relations with the likes of you?

132
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,000
- I think we can handle that.
- The coalition grows in strength

133
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,293
and influence every day.
Soon enough,

134
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:04,957
all of your current trading partners
will have no choice but to join

135
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,384
and therefore to abide
by the ruling of this council.

136
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:12,096
As for you and your team,
an example must be made.

137
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:14,223
Justice demands it.

138
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:16,339
Justice...
is that what you're calling this?

139
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,408
A suitable, uninhabited planet
has been chosen.

140
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:21,907
If you're found guilty,
you'll be sent there,

141
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:23,618
without any hope of return,

142
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:25,902
for the rest of your natural lives.

143
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:33,426
Apparently,
the planet they picked for us

144
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:36,128
has just enough food for us to survive,
so, technically,

145
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:37,848
it's not an execution.

146
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,475
- Great.
- And they took the DHD,

147
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:43,461
so whoever comes through the Gate...
they're not coming back.

148
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:46,879
- The Daedalus can find us.
- If they had the address.

149
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:50,085
They'd need to search
every solar system, which would take,

150
00:09:50,245 --> 00:09:51,882
what, a million years?

151
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,549
Right. Let's not panic.

152
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:55,712
I've been to the chamber
a couple of times now.

153
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:58,208
I'm beginning to get a sense
of the layout.

154
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,762
The architecture is different
from that of the village.

155
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:02,420
No, we're on another planet.

156
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,639
Judging by the fact
there's no natural light or windows,

157
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,591
I'm guessing an underground bunker.

158
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:09,987
- Guards?
- Yeah. Half a dozen or so.

159
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:12,636
We're going to have to see
if they change in shifts.

160
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:15,076
Any chance you could just convince them
that we're not guilty?

161
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:16,898
'Cause we're not, right?

162
00:10:18,697 --> 00:10:21,371
Come on, there is no way
the Pegasus galaxy would be better off

163
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:23,042
- if we'd never come here.
- No.

164
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:26,087
But since your arrival, there have been
setbacks. Lives have been lost.

165
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:29,581
But there is hope now
where once there was none.

166
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:34,053
As much as I'd like to tell these guys
where to put their little trial,

167
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:37,348
we'll have to play along for a while
until we get out of here.

168
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:47,733
Mr. Woolsey, this is Myrus.

169
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:52,576
He claims to be a representative
for the new coalition of planets.

170
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:53,730
Does he?

171
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,908
Are you the leader of Atlantis?

172
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:57,493
That's right.

173
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:00,080
Then we need to speak.

174
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:02,596
Well, what's next on the agenda?

175
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:06,509
Did we step on the rose bushes
on our last trip to Vedeena?

176
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:10,423
Perhaps you've heard of a plague
that's swept through several worlds,

177
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,885
a sickness that arrives suddenly,
runs its course in a matter of days,

178
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:18,223
and kills one out of every three
men, women, and children

179
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:19,515
wherever it strikes.

180
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:22,935
There are those who believe
it is not a sickness at all

181
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:24,954
but a deliberate poisoning,

182
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:27,023
the work of one individual.

183
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:30,016
I know who you're talking about.
His name is Michael.

184
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:32,727
It is said that he is neither human
nor Wraith,

185
00:11:32,847 --> 00:11:34,746
but some kind of half-breed.

186
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:37,366
Can you explain to us
how such a thing is possible?

187
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:42,303
One of our people
was conducting research.

188
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:44,039
They were trying to solve

189
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,875
the Wraith problem once and for all.

190
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:10,232
You found a way
to convert Wraith into humans?

191
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:12,943
Don't ask me the medical questions.
I'm not a Doctor.

192
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:15,738
And this Michael
was one of your test subjects?

193
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:17,907
As a matter of fact,
he was the first.

194
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:26,047
Blood pressure's fine, pulse normal.
You're bouncing back quite nicely.

195
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,969
- Bouncing back from what?
- Hello, Michael.

196
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:30,294
Do you remember me?

197
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:35,857
I'm Dr. Elizabeth Weir.

198
00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:37,635
This is Lt. Colonel John Sheppard.

199
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:39,512
You served under my command.

200
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:43,599
Your name
is Lieutenant Michael Kenmore.

201
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:48,655
You're in a private room
off the infirmary here in Atlantis.

202
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:51,357
Is that familiar to you?

203
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:54,699
Atlantis...

204
00:12:58,418 --> 00:12:59,419
I think.

205
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:01,992
We tried to convince him
he was one of us.

206
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:05,596
But he knew something was wrong,
and then

207
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:07,017
he found proof.

208
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,383
<i>Five milligrams!</i>

209
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:24,901
<i>Release me!</i>

210
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:37,048
<i>You will die for this!</i>

211
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,947
<i>Others will come for me!</i>

212
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,508
After that, he escaped.

213
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:03,625
He went back and forth between
Wraith and human a couple more times

214
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,140
until he finally settled
somewhere in between.

215
00:14:06,622 --> 00:14:08,434
So once again you admit your guilt.

216
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,313
You unleashed this...
thing on the galaxy.

217
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:14,881
We didn't let him
out the door and forget about him.

218
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:17,072
We've been chasing him ever since.

219
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:20,679
A couple of months ago,
we managed to catch up with him.

220
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:30,011
Fire in the hole.

221
00:14:36,955 --> 00:14:39,562
- What happened?
- The hyperdrive just exploded.

222
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:41,545
No, that's impossible.

223
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:43,492
Main power is out
across much of the ship.

224
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:46,244
- An accidental overload?
- It doesn't appear that way.

225
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,917
How did they do that?

226
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:49,593
I will look into it.

227
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,579
- <i>Daedalus, please come in.</i>
- What the hell happened to your Jumper?

228
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,890
Hell, I got all turned around
in the parking garage.

229
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,988
I was in a rush, I borrowed this dart.
I've got the team into a storage device.

230
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:05,855
<i>Feel free to do whatever you want
to that cruiser.</i>

231
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:08,738
Major Marks,
please make that ship go away.

232
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:11,137
Yes, sir.

233
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,453
Are you sure he was killed?

234
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:27,028
The ship was vaporized.
There was no body to recover.

235
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:29,614
Well, then, you cannot testify
before this council,

236
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:31,409
and under the eyes of the Ancestors,

237
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:34,728
that you know for certain
that he is dead.

238
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:39,168
No.

239
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:41,652
This is outrageous.

240
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:44,779
You're telling me that one of the first
official acts of your new government

241
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:46,827
was to assault and kidnap my people?

242
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,270
They weren't assaulted.
They were arrested.

243
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,910
You've got to be kidding me.

244
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,091
Believe me, not all of us
agreed with this decision,

245
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,123
but it wasn't taken
entirely without reason.

246
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:56,889
We've been trying
to help you people.

247
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:59,755
What you've been doing
is making unilateral decisions

248
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,156
that affect the lives of millions,
without consultation

249
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:06,389
and without accountability.
This is no longer acceptable.

250
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,586
I'm not going to get drawn
into a debate here.

251
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,602
I only need to know one thing...

252
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,224
Where are my people being held?

253
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:15,394
Of course I can't tell you that.

254
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:18,062
Fair trials don't take place
in secret locations.

255
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:19,259
Nevertheless...

256
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,234
I think Mr. Myrus needs a little time
to reconsider his position here.

257
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,411
Escort him to a cell.

258
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:25,886
My pleasure.

259
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:29,010
- You're making a mistake.
- Am I?

260
00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:34,563
When I was chosen
to deliver this message,

261
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:36,707
I knew there was a chance
I wouldn't be coming back.

262
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:40,794
But if you detain me, you will only be
confirming what many already suspect...

263
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:43,543
That you're a rogue element
in this galaxy,

264
00:16:43,663 --> 00:16:46,550
operating without restraint
or due process.

265
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,351
Lock him up.

266
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:53,825
Let's go.

267
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:04,127
All right.

268
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:06,195
I'm not saying
we haven't made some mistakes,

269
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:08,739
but that's 'cause we're the only ones
out there fighting.

270
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,752
Nobody else is out there
taking on the Wraith.

271
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:12,951
But isn't that
your own fault as well?

272
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:15,251
What are you talking about?

273
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:17,941
The Genii had a plan
to combat the Wraith,

274
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:20,459
but they were thwarted
when you betrayed them.

275
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:24,129
Oh, is that what they told you?
Because that's not what I remember.

276
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:30,322
Where's my father?

277
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:35,188
He did not survive.

278
00:17:36,396 --> 00:17:37,274
How?

279
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:41,020
- What happened?
- I think we should find out.

280
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:44,542
Take aim!

281
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:55,285
Cowen, I thought we were
just learning how to get along.

282
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,448
She killed Tyrus.

283
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,807
No.

284
00:17:59,783 --> 00:18:02,709
By leaving him to die, you may
just as well have killed him yourself.

285
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,481
We will keep
this intelligence information

286
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:09,888
and your ship,

287
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:12,814
and whatever quantities of C-4
you have in your possession.

288
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:15,013
That is all you ever intended...
to use us.

289
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,765
Your weapons.

290
00:18:17,244 --> 00:18:19,518
No. I don't think so.

291
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:21,478
This is what your father died for?

292
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:23,891
In the name of people
who would lie and steal

293
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:25,940
from those they would call friends?

294
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,192
Well, I lied too.

295
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:29,678
Jumpers two and three, execute.

296
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,452
You really thought
we had one ship, did you?

297
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:40,038
So you betrayed each other.

298
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:43,876
We came prepared.
They made the first move.

299
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:48,338
Look, the Genii plan
was never gonna work anyways.

300
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,558
They had bombs they couldn't finish
without our help,

301
00:18:51,678 --> 00:18:53,627
they had no methods of delivery.

302
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:57,937
If you want a military victory
against the Wraith,

303
00:18:58,057 --> 00:18:59,602
we're your only chance.

304
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,078
You've been in touch
with our off-world contacts?

305
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:04,136
Yes, sir.

306
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,937
- And?
- Nobody knows anything.

307
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:08,871
At least,
that's what they're saying.

308
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:10,235
You don't believe them?

309
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:12,682
Well, frankly, right now,
I don't know what to believe, sir.

310
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:15,371
These people are supposed to be
our friends, but if we can't just walk

311
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:18,506
into a village without worrying
about an ambush, what's the point?

312
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:19,815
We're not there yet.

313
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,636
I refuse to believe that the whole
galaxy has turned against us.

314
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:25,867
Well, it might as well,
because right now we have nothing.

315
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,761
Maybe not...

316
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:30,255
Come with me.

317
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,549
Open it.

318
00:19:37,622 --> 00:19:40,660
Mr. Myrus,
I have a proposal for you.

319
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:45,229
So you claim to have had
military success against the Wraith?

320
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:49,120
We've done our share of damage.
Even managed to take a few hive ships.

321
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,193
Really?

322
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:53,070
And how did you manage to accomplish
this remarkable feat?

323
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:55,745
Well, I can tell you one thing...
It's never easy,

324
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:58,700
but one good trick is to get them
to shoot at each other.

325
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:13,434
Look. See that?

326
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:15,532
It's a dart firing
at one of the hive ships.

327
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:16,405
Why?

328
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,012
Sheppard.

329
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:35,070
Sheppard's actually getting them
to fire at each other.

330
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:50,118
Now, if two hive ships are going at it
and you're onboard one of them,

331
00:20:50,238 --> 00:20:53,005
that can be a bit of a problem.
That's when you have to improvise.

332
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,670
- Teyla, Lorne, come in.
- <i>Colonel, where are you?</i>

333
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,226
- We're on our way.
- Hurry.

334
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:58,688
The other hive has found us.

335
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:01,245
- <i>Can you hold 'em off?</i>
- Not for long.

336
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:06,268
Approaching dart bay.

337
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,620
Acknowledged.

338
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,370
They're inside.

339
00:21:09,622 --> 00:21:12,312
Colonel, request permission
to jump to hyperspace immediately.

340
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:13,984
<i>Negative.
I have another idea.</i>

341
00:21:14,245 --> 00:21:16,028
Teyla, I want you
to set a new course.

342
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:24,819
- Commander.
- What is it?

343
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:27,941
We just received an urgent
communication from the hive.

344
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,014
The enemy...
They're headed straight for us.

345
00:21:44,746 --> 00:21:46,456
Did I also mention
we have a fair amount

346
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:49,518
of Ancient technology at our disposal,
because that can be pretty handy too.

347
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,690
There's a hive
bearing down on your position.

348
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,503
Yes, sir, I see that.
Stand by.

349
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:55,860
- Doc, they're killing us here.
- I have it, I have it.

350
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:56,944
Firing drones.

351
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,252
Let's see,
what else did I leave out?

352
00:22:22,372 --> 00:22:24,693
There's been so many over the years,
it's hard to keep track.

353
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:25,745
Enough.

354
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:30,477
You spin a colorful tale, Colonel.
That much is obvious.

355
00:22:30,878 --> 00:22:34,815
Yet for all these fantastic claims,
we have no evidence but your word.

356
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,057
This trial is evidence.
None of this would be happening...

357
00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:41,477
Your precious little coalition
wouldn't even exist

358
00:22:41,597 --> 00:22:43,857
if we hadn't have pushed
the Wraith so far back

359
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:47,195
that you got an opportunity
you haven't had in 10,000 years.

360
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:50,163
Your responsibility in this
has already been determined.

361
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:53,448
You woke the Wraith early,
before the population of this galaxy

362
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:56,282
had sufficient time to recover,
which eventually led to the Wraith

363
00:22:56,402 --> 00:22:58,912
going to war with each other
over feeding grounds.

364
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:01,653
That war is what has given us
this opportunity,

365
00:23:01,773 --> 00:23:03,802
not some imagined victory
on your part.

366
00:23:24,962 --> 00:23:26,733
We will take a recess.

367
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:28,910
Please take the prisoner
back to his cell.

368
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,015
Woolsey, what the hell
are you doing here?

369
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,502
I've made an arrangement
with your captors.

370
00:23:49,622 --> 00:23:51,516
I'm taking over your defense.

371
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,158
I don't suppose you managed to bring
a subspace locator beacon, did you?

372
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:02,861
That's Wraith technology.

373
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:05,961
It's not like we have one
just lying around.

374
00:24:08,224 --> 00:24:11,546
I even tried to contact Todd
to see if we could borrow one,

375
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,222
but he never responded.

376
00:24:13,342 --> 00:24:14,970
What about the DHD
on the planet?

377
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,310
You could pull the most
recent addresses that were dialed.

378
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,841
Already done. There were
over 50 addresses in the buffer.

379
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:22,786
I almost cleaned out the entire City
sending people to investigate them,

380
00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:24,549
but they turned up nothing.

381
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:26,593
They took us
through more than one Gate.

382
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:28,160
So it would seem.

383
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:30,639
This was obviously
very well thought out.

384
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:33,303
They had a very clever plan,

385
00:24:33,423 --> 00:24:36,030
but we're smarter and better armed.
There's gotta be a way around this.

386
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,904
They took advantage
of one significant weakness...

387
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:41,566
We trusted them.

388
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,615
Look, I came here

389
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:52,570
because I have a plan
to get you out of here.

390
00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:55,653
Well, what is it?

391
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:57,499
Win the trial.

392
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,068
Look, we were just playing along

393
00:25:03,188 --> 00:25:05,423
to buy us enough time
to figure out a way out of here.

394
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:07,391
And how's that coming along?

395
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:10,019
Well, we're...
We're working on it.

396
00:25:10,956 --> 00:25:12,869
I was Harvard law review.

397
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:16,036
I was Chief Counsel
of the US Army corps of engineers.

398
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:20,033
Prior to that, I was an appellate
advocate for Hartshorne & Slaughter,

399
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:24,109
one of the most prestigious litigation
boutiques in all New York City.

400
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,314
Believe me, I can handle

401
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:34,301
three tribal elders
with a stack of papyrus.

402
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:37,046
Some time ago,

403
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,876
a number of human worlds were attacked
and destroyed from space,

404
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:44,096
not by the Wraith,
but by someone else.

405
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,401
Little is known
of this mysterious race

406
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:49,342
except that they possess
incredibly advanced technology,

407
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:52,159
and are rumored to be
allies of Atlantis.

408
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:55,244
I think I know who you're referring to,
and believe me,

409
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:57,786
they are not our allies.

410
00:25:58,078 --> 00:25:59,352
They're called Replicators.

411
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:01,717
They were created by the Ancients.

412
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,484
If you wish to know the truth
of who we are,

413
00:26:09,604 --> 00:26:10,921
I will show you.

414
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,740
The Ancients, as you call them,
were desperate in their search

415
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,037
for a better way
to fight the Wraith.

416
00:26:20,157 --> 00:26:23,346
Though greatly outnumbered, they relied
on their technological superiority

417
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:25,128
to give them a needed advantage.

418
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,708
Instead of building bigger,
more powerful weapons,

419
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:30,528
- they chose to build smaller ones.
- Nanites.

420
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:37,909
In these tiny killing machines,
the Ancients imbued an aggression

421
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,634
that surpassed even that
of their enemy.

422
00:26:40,754 --> 00:26:42,965
The technology allowed
for organic assimilation

423
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:46,191
and self-replication
to increase their effectiveness.

424
00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:48,209
And replicate they did.

425
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,201
They grew in numbers,
evolving at a rate

426
00:26:56,361 --> 00:26:58,394
that took the Ancients by surprise.

427
00:26:58,514 --> 00:27:00,717
The molecular machines
began interlocking,

428
00:27:00,837 --> 00:27:04,524
assembling themselves
to form even more complex organisms,

429
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:06,493
eventually evolving
into the most effective

430
00:27:06,613 --> 00:27:08,605
and efficient form they knew of.

431
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,622
This is how we were born.

432
00:27:13,975 --> 00:27:16,051
When the Ancients concluded
that we would never become

433
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:18,223
the weapon they desired to create,

434
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:19,950
they decided to end it.

435
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,190
So they chose to destroy us,

436
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:31,651
to leave no trace of us behind.

437
00:27:35,692 --> 00:27:37,993
- Some of them managed to survive.
- That's right.

438
00:27:38,451 --> 00:27:41,332
And as the name suggests,
they replicated

439
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:44,040
and rebuilt themselves
into a powerful force.

440
00:27:48,957 --> 00:27:50,515
Oh... My...

441
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,340
No kidding.

442
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,981
But why would they
attack human worlds?

443
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:12,355
It was a strategy they developed
in their campaign against the Wraith...

444
00:28:12,806 --> 00:28:15,989
Eliminate the enemy's food supply.

445
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,204
There's one thing
I don't understand.

446
00:28:23,592 --> 00:28:27,343
If, as you suggest, they were originally
designed to fight the Wraith,

447
00:28:27,726 --> 00:28:29,461
why did they wait until now?

448
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,069
- I got the ZPM. We're leaving.
- Wait a minute. We can't go.

449
00:28:35,353 --> 00:28:38,222
What are you talking about?
Can't get the hyperdrive back online?

450
00:28:38,386 --> 00:28:41,201
I mean, we can, but not yet.
Look, while Elizabeth's been connected,

451
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:43,536
I've been going over
the Replicators' base code,

452
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:45,070
and I found this.

453
00:28:46,544 --> 00:28:47,952
What is that?

454
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:52,380
The Holy Grail.
It's their whole reason for being.

455
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:55,028
It's a command code
that directs them to attack the Wraith.

456
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:56,895
But they don't attack the Wraith.

457
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:59,783
They've been sitting
on their nanite asses for 10,000 years.

458
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:01,652
That's because
it's been deactivated.

459
00:29:02,404 --> 00:29:03,705
Are you telling us

460
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,081
that you are the ones
that activated the attack code?

461
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:09,167
We didn't know
they were going to target human worlds.

462
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:11,711
Because you acted rashly,
without considering the consequences.

463
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:13,625
We had an opportunity,

464
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:16,257
one that wasn't going
to present itself again.

465
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,511
Believe me, Councilors,
this decision was not taken lightly.

466
00:29:20,815 --> 00:29:21,854
In fact,

467
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,308
it cost us one of our best people.

468
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,358
Get to the Jumper.

469
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:35,318
You're coming with us.

470
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,530
I can't keep them frozen
much longer.

471
00:29:39,073 --> 00:29:40,824
We're not leaving you behind.

472
00:29:41,068 --> 00:29:42,840
If you don't leave right now,

473
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,950
none of us will get out of here, so go!
That's an order!

474
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,706
Come on!

475
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:50,794
Go!

476
00:29:54,741 --> 00:29:57,056
One of your people died,
and you consider this

477
00:29:57,176 --> 00:29:58,810
a grave sacrifice?

478
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:02,595
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Then imagine how we feel...

479
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,473
Those of us who have witnessed
the deaths of thousands.

480
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:08,726
We cannot be held responsible
for the actions of the Replicators.

481
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:11,735
Colonel Sheppard made the same argument
in respect to the Wraith,

482
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:14,566
and in that case
I might be inclined to agree with him.

483
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:18,342
By your own admission,
these Replicators are machines.

484
00:30:18,518 --> 00:30:22,508
So if I were to set a detonator,
can I then later deny responsibility

485
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,742
for the actions of the bomb?

486
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:27,533
By that logic,
you might as well blame the Ancients.

487
00:30:27,653 --> 00:30:28,753
They created them.

488
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:32,357
The Ancients, as you call them,
aren't here to answer for their actions.

489
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:33,710
You are.

490
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,599
We know for certain of six human worlds
that were destroyed by the Replicators.

491
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,107
But we also know

492
00:30:39,227 --> 00:30:42,051
of at least a dozen hive ships
that were destroyed,

493
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,676
hive ships that would almost certainly
have culled within a year.

494
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:49,759
One could make the argument that,
on balance, more lives were saved

495
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:52,612
- than were lost.
- On balance?

496
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:54,816
Is that what we are to you?

497
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,232
Figures on a ledger?

498
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:59,736
Pieces that can be moved about
in a game of strategy,

499
00:30:59,896 --> 00:31:02,363
some to be saved
while others are sacrificed?

500
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:06,899
- I certainly didn't mean to diminish...
- Real people are being killed,

501
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,037
real villages destroyed...

502
00:31:09,305 --> 00:31:11,136
My village, my people.

503
00:31:11,797 --> 00:31:15,537
My husband and children...
murdered before my eyes.

504
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,621
You're from one of the planets destroyed
by the Replicators.

505
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:23,096
I barely escaped with my life,

506
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:25,214
but not before I saw

507
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:27,319
everything I hold dear

508
00:31:27,593 --> 00:31:29,382
get wiped out

509
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:32,936
by a beam of light from the sky.

510
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:36,435
And I will not rest

511
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,029
until someone
is made to pay for it.

512
00:31:48,065 --> 00:31:49,819
I guess we can rule out
getting her vote.

513
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,535
It's clearly inappropriate for someone
that biased to be on the council.

514
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:56,794
So they stacked
the deck against us.

515
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:58,434
I'm not sure.

516
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,990
Dimas seems to be
a reasonable man.

517
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,894
I think he might even be persuaded
to vote our way.

518
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:06,098
Kelore is a little harder to read.

519
00:32:06,378 --> 00:32:08,196
He seemed pretty hostile to me.

520
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:12,418
- Didn't you say he was from Latira?
- Yeah, that's right.

521
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:15,801
One of our last intelligence reports
suggests a growing relationship

522
00:32:15,921 --> 00:32:18,314
between Latira and the Genii.

523
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,285
Yeah, he did try to convince me

524
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:23,711
that they should be leading the fight
against the Wraith.

525
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:27,176
- You think the Genii are behind this?
- It makes sense.

526
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:30,440
Apart from Atlantis, they're clearly

527
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,674
the biggest military power
in the coalition.

528
00:32:32,794 --> 00:32:34,872
If they played right,
they could run the whole thing.

529
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,874
But only with us out of the picture.

530
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:39,252
So we were right all along.
This whole thing's fixed.

531
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:41,152
I say we go to plan B...

532
00:32:41,272 --> 00:32:43,756
Wait for the guards come in,
I beat 'em up, take their guns,

533
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:46,843
- we shoot our way out of here.
- Do we even know the way out?

534
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:50,325
We're at least two levels underground
and there's no more than a dozen guards

535
00:32:50,445 --> 00:32:51,472
at any one time.

536
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,236
What about on the surface?
How many guards are up there?

537
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:56,806
And which way is the Gate?
And how far?

538
00:32:57,402 --> 00:33:00,031
There's a few things
we'll have to figure out along the way.

539
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:01,151
It's too risky.

540
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,693
We could wind up being shot
before we got out of the building.

541
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,988
What other choice do we have?
We know we can't win this thing.

542
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:09,407
Not fairly, no.

543
00:33:12,862 --> 00:33:14,162
What are you talking about?

544
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:18,031
I'm saying now that I know
what the game is,

545
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:20,071
I can play it.

546
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:29,385
Kelore, thank you
for agreeing to meet me.

547
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,991
Wait outside.

548
00:33:38,246 --> 00:33:41,821
It cost me rather a fine pocketwatch
that used to belong to my father

549
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:43,274
to get him to bring me here.

550
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:46,569
You shouldn't have bothered.
There's nothing I can do for you.

551
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:49,113
Maybe I'm just feeling generous
tonight.

552
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:50,698
Speak plainly.

553
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:53,265
You're backing the wrong horse.

554
00:33:54,236 --> 00:33:56,764
We know you're connected
with the Genii.

555
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:03,127
What are you talking about?

556
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:07,131
We also know they're looking to become
the muscle behind the coalition.

557
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,998
We think we'd make a better choice.

558
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:14,347
You? Atlantis?

559
00:34:14,507 --> 00:34:15,717
That's right.

560
00:34:17,404 --> 00:34:19,894
Well, I didn't realize
you had those kinds of ambitions.

561
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,679
We've been content
to keep to ourselves up until now,

562
00:34:25,718 --> 00:34:28,644
but if it's a choice
between getting pushed out of the game

563
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:30,760
and taking a more active part,

564
00:34:30,966 --> 00:34:33,074
well, that's no choice at all,
is it?

565
00:34:33,766 --> 00:34:36,911
Of course, for appearance's sake,
we can't be too aggressive,

566
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:40,205
so we'll need
someone on the inside

567
00:34:41,094 --> 00:34:42,924
to help push our agenda...

568
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,921
Someone to whom we'll be very,
very grateful.

569
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,912
And how do I know you haven't made
this offer to the others?

570
00:34:54,032 --> 00:34:57,790
I think we both know
Dimas will only be swayed by reason,

571
00:34:58,637 --> 00:35:01,919
and Shiana's going to vote against us,
no matter what.

572
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:08,599
That leaves you.

573
00:35:21,644 --> 00:35:24,570
Mr. Woolsey, are you ready
to face the final charge?

574
00:35:26,154 --> 00:35:27,221
I am.

575
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:31,215
The people of Atlantis stand accused
of conspiring with the Wraith.

576
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:32,598
Conspiring?

577
00:35:32,718 --> 00:35:35,303
We have reports that Atlantis
has negotiated with the Wraith

578
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,205
and performed military
operations with them.

579
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:41,517
It is said you have formed an alliance
with one Wraith in particular.

580
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:43,436
Todd.

581
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,958
That's what we call him.

582
00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:52,361
This Wraith was imprisoned
with Colonel Sheppard by the Genii.

583
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,448
The Wraith was allowed
to feed on him but, despite this,

584
00:35:55,608 --> 00:35:58,560
Colonel Sheppard realized
that their best chance of escape

585
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,766
was together.

586
00:36:46,714 --> 00:36:47,913
Which way?

587
00:36:48,928 --> 00:36:50,227
This way.

588
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:55,424
And you continue
to have dealings with this Wraith?

589
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:58,469
We have... occasional contact.

590
00:36:58,974 --> 00:37:00,888
- You trust him?
- Of course not.

591
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:03,850
But he has proven to be useful
at times.

592
00:37:04,741 --> 00:37:06,642
He helped us hold off
the Replicator fleet

593
00:37:06,762 --> 00:37:10,753
long enough for Dr. McKay
to enact a plan to destroy them.

594
00:37:17,463 --> 00:37:19,407
Power down in interior section.

595
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:22,243
Transferring power from non-critical
systems to hull regeneration.

596
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:31,919
- Our shields can't take much more, sir.
- Hopefully, they won't have to.

597
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:36,355
And get ready to transfer power
from the beam weapons to the...

598
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:50,642
- What the hell?
- Son of a bitch.

599
00:37:51,912 --> 00:37:53,416
He actually did it.

600
00:38:03,622 --> 00:38:06,295
- We need to get out of here.
- Right. Let's go. Come on!

601
00:38:16,935 --> 00:38:19,804
We shouldn't stick around
and watch this go down.

602
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:22,355
We should tell the fleet to jump
to the <i>rendezvous</i> point.

603
00:38:22,475 --> 00:38:24,096
The planet's become unstable.

604
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:45,992
The fact is

605
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:49,330
we would never have defeated
the Replicators without his help.

606
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:53,203
I think it's safe to say
they would have continued their policy

607
00:38:53,323 --> 00:38:54,877
of attacking human worlds

608
00:38:55,087 --> 00:38:58,107
and, by now, everyone in this galaxy

609
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:00,758
would be dead.

610
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,358
Very well.

611
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:08,736
As that was the final charge,

612
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:11,159
we will recess to deliberate.

613
00:39:11,337 --> 00:39:14,021
I'd like to make one final statement,
if I may.

614
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,054
Very well.

615
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,174
The Wraith are in disarray,

616
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,535
but that won't last forever.

617
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:26,598
Sooner or later, one faction
will win out over the others.

618
00:39:27,336 --> 00:39:28,842
And when that happens,

619
00:39:28,962 --> 00:39:31,335
they will turn their attention
to this coalition

620
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:34,706
with a ruthless vengeance,
the likes of which you've never seen.

621
00:39:38,611 --> 00:39:40,361
If you don't want us there

622
00:39:40,757 --> 00:39:43,480
when that day comes,
fighting by your side,

623
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:46,446
then, by all means,

624
00:39:47,983 --> 00:39:49,248
vote us guilty.

625
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:52,296
I need no deliberation.

626
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:55,358
I say we get this over with now.

627
00:39:58,077 --> 00:39:59,234
Very well.

628
00:40:02,082 --> 00:40:03,154
I vote guilty,

629
00:40:03,585 --> 00:40:04,925
on all charges.

630
00:40:07,735 --> 00:40:09,410
I vote not guilty on all charges.

631
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:12,496
It falls to you, Kelore.

632
00:40:13,055 --> 00:40:14,749
Yours is the deciding vote.

633
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:38,814
Well?
What's the word?

634
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:41,692
- Not guilty.
- Oh, thank God.

635
00:40:41,955 --> 00:40:43,486
We're free to go.

636
00:40:44,594 --> 00:40:46,572
I never doubted you for a second.

637
00:40:58,548 --> 00:40:59,628
Nice suit.

638
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:04,279
Being back in the courtroom
made me miss my old uniform.

639
00:41:04,488 --> 00:41:07,600
- You're kidding.
- Not the job, just the uniform.

640
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:11,551
Oh, that's nice.

641
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,350
Well, it seemed appropriate.

642
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,803
So, you going to tell me
how you managed to pull this one off?

643
00:41:20,923 --> 00:41:23,415
Well, I'd say
it was a combination of things...

644
00:41:23,535 --> 00:41:25,874
My legal skills, my eloquence,

645
00:41:26,324 --> 00:41:29,225
the indisputable logic
of my arguments,

646
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:31,436
and the bribe I offered Kelore.

647
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:37,067
On top of that,

648
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:39,500
I had to commit Atlantis

649
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,865
to a much larger
day-to-day participation

650
00:41:42,985 --> 00:41:45,555
in the politics
of the Pegasus galaxy.

651
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:48,598
A way to explain that
in my report...

652
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:52,359
What's the point of being out here
if we don't try to make a difference?

653
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:54,802
Let's hope the IOA agrees with you.

654
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,741
Let's worry about that later.
For now,

655
00:41:58,656 --> 00:41:59,996
congratulations.

656
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:01,865
Thanks.
