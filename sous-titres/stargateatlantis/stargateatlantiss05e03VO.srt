<i>Stargate Atlantis...</i>

2
00:00:01,831 --> 00:00:03,141
Ara, Rakai.

3
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:08,011
Me, Rakai, Ara, we're your friends.

4
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:10,815
- You belong with us.
- You want to hit a Wraith lab?

5
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:13,461
Having a ship would make things
getting us in and out

6
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:15,310
before any reinforcements arrive.

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,893
We'll go this way. You, that way.

8
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:19,128
Contact us if you find anything.

9
00:00:19,248 --> 00:00:21,048
Thank God it's you three.

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,485
The Wraith worshipers...
They did you.

11
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:26,696
They rewarded us
with the gift of everlasting life.

12
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:28,323
- Rakai, no!
- No weapons.

13
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:32,735
Rodney, get away while you can,
because the next time we meet,

14
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:34,653
it will not be as friends.

15
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:43,486
- You getting any sleep these days?
- Not much, I'm afraid.

16
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:45,014
Things are a little easier

17
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:48,885
now that Kanaan's has been allowed
to return from the mainland.

18
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:50,959
How's he liking life
in the big city?

19
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,106
He's happy to be reunited
with Torren and I,

20
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:56,627
but he's having difficulty
adjusting to life on Atlantis.

21
00:00:57,597 --> 00:00:59,195
I hear the shower scared him.

22
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:02,561
And you once stunned Dr. Gero
at your own surprise birthday party.

23
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:03,883
He spooked me.

24
00:01:05,723 --> 00:01:07,521
It's difficult for Kanaan.

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,615
He has Torren and me, of course, but

26
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:12,990
I still think he feels isolated.

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,579
He just needs
to make some new friends.

28
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:17,405
You should get him to come by the gym.

29
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:19,290
- We could spar.
- Thank you.

30
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,750
That's very kind, but I need him
in one piece for the foreseeable future.

31
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,272
You're no fun.

00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:50,046
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

33
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:57,801
present:

34
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:02,498
Season 5 Episode 03
Broken Ties (v. 1.0)

35
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,575
Timing by:

36
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:22,625
Golgi, Linwelin and Pikes.

37
00:02:38,863 --> 00:02:41,206
www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

38
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:52,367
The Daedalus confirms the results
of your preliminary search.

39
00:02:52,487 --> 00:02:55,276
There's no sign
of Ronon's subcutaneous transmitter

40
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:56,972
anywhere on that planet.

41
00:02:57,092 --> 00:02:58,992
That means he's still alive.

42
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:02,181
If Tyre wanted him dead,
we would have found the body.

43
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:05,803
Unless he just took him somewhere
to exact a slow revenge.

44
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:09,191
I don't mean to sound negative,
but from what I've heard,

45
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:12,529
- his mind is seriously warped.
- And yet he didn't kill me.

46
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:15,384
It would have been safer for him
to leave no witnesses.

47
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:17,969
So perhaps,
despite what the Wraith did to him,

48
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:20,701
Tyre still possesses
his Satedan sense of honor.

49
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:22,412
It didn't stop him from ambushing you.

50
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:25,355
Maybe we can use
that Satedan sense of honor

51
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:26,704
to help us find Ronon.

52
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:29,629
- How do you propose we do that?
- We get a Satedan to help us.

53
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:32,251
You happen to have one handy,
do you?

54
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:34,342
Teyla knows where one is.

55
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:36,322
- Solen Sincha.
- Who?

56
00:03:36,678 --> 00:03:38,763
He is a survivor
of the Wraith attack on Sateda.

57
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:42,250
We encountered him on a trade mission
to Belkan two years ago.

58
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,543
He isn't exactly
the settle-down kind of guy.

59
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:46,836
He's still there?

60
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:48,690
There's only one way to find out.

61
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:59,218
Mr. Woolsey,
permission to go off-world?

62
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:06,696
- You have a go.
- Great.

63
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,796
Will you be accompanying
Col. Sheppard and Dr. McKay?

64
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:15,025
I only ask because I've yet to receive
your formal request

65
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:16,551
to return to active duty.

66
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:18,344
Of course she'll be returning.
Right?

67
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:21,472
I have yet to make a decision
about my future with the team.

68
00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:25,537
Okay.

69
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:29,856
However, I would still like
to accompany them to Belkan.

70
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:31,436
Of course.

71
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:08,346
Where's Teyla?

72
00:05:08,787 --> 00:05:10,607
I left her back on the planet.

73
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,430
Don't worry. She's fine.

74
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:14,683
You know I wouldn't hurt her.

75
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:16,517
Do I?

76
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,945
I accept the fact
that you no longer trust me,

77
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:22,665
but I'm hoping
that will change in time.

78
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:24,799
Sateda is gone.

79
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:28,105
We're the last of our kind, Ronon.

80
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,008
We're brothers, not enemies.

81
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:32,428
We're brothers?

82
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:37,161
So I should just forgive you
for setting me up last year?

83
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:42,235
If you had just listened to reason,
things could have been different.

84
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:45,431
Ara and Rakai would still be alive,

85
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:47,466
and we'd be together again.

86
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:50,820
As Wraith worshipers and traitors
to the memory of Sateda?

87
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,816
Hell, no.

88
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:54,203
Of course not.

89
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:55,994
I see that now.

90
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:58,227
You're blinded by the past,

91
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:01,002
lied to by your so-called friends
on Atlantis.

92
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:04,742
But I still have faith in you,
old friend.

93
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:08,744
You just need to open your eyes
to the truth.

94
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,661
All right.

95
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:15,732
Just untie me and I'll listen
to what you have to say.

96
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:20,487
Would that be before

97
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:23,276
or after you try to beat me
unconscious?

98
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:24,609
I don't know.

99
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:25,830
You choose.

100
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:28,683
Or I could just surprise you.

101
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,281
I don't doubt it.

102
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,438
What's wrong with you?

103
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:39,930
I'm not well.

104
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:43,052
But I've been worse.

105
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,226
You know where we are?

106
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,580
You remember Sarif Sur, don't you?

107
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:52,975
You almost died on that run.

108
00:06:53,095 --> 00:06:56,597
We both nearly died because you refused
to leave me behind.

109
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:02,843
You risked your life to save me.

110
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:10,104
Today...

111
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:14,223
I return the favor.

112
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:27,035
Solen Sincha?

113
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,200
Go away.

114
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:31,625
Can't you see I'm trying to sleep?

115
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,050
- We need your help.
- Ronon Dex is in trouble.

116
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,585
- Ronon Dex is always in trouble.
- His life is in danger.

117
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,756
Again. What else is new?

118
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:52,302
What kind of trouble
has he gotten himself into this time?

119
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:55,000
He was abducted by a fellow Satedan,

120
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,623
a Wraith worshiper by the name of Tyre.

121
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:02,568
You mean former Wraith worshiper.

122
00:08:03,546 --> 00:08:07,218
The dog disappointed his masters,
so they turned him loose.

123
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:09,412
That's uncharacteristically
kind of them.

124
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:10,634
Not exactly.

125
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:14,397
So long as he's on the run,
he's a living, breathing example

126
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:16,958
of what happens
to humans who disappoint them.

127
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:18,929
Tyre's a marked man now.

128
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:22,171
Anyone I know would kill him on sight.
It's just a matter of time.

129
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:25,424
He was once a proud Satedan,
not unlike yourself.

130
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:27,621
He was subjected to torture.

131
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,476
- Perhaps he had no choice.
- There's always a choice.

132
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:32,890
He could have chosen death
like a true Satedan.

133
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,213
Any idea where we can find him?

134
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,187
If I knew that,
he'd already be dead.

135
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:41,835
All right.

136
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,651
Tyre's not thinking straight, right?

137
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:46,237
- Sure.
- It's probably a matter of time

138
00:08:46,397 --> 00:08:48,263
before he slips up.
And when he does,

139
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,408
I'm assuming your leads
will hear about it.

140
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,368
Probably.


141
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:54,662
So you contact us
when you hear something.

142
00:08:55,178 --> 00:08:57,881
We'll deal with Tyre
and save you the trip.

143
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,680
All right.

144
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:05,962
To Ronon.

145
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:12,043
Look at you.

146
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:14,023
You can barely walk.

147
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,982
Let me get you some help.

148
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,125
I'm beyond your help.

149
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,852
It's the Wraith, isn't it?

150
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:26,589
What did they do to you?

151
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,686
At this point,

152
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:32,535
it's not so much what they did to me
as what they aren't doing to me.

153
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:34,613
Giving you life?

154
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:36,579
Reverse-feeding or whatever?

155
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:38,337
It's hard to describe.

156
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:41,120
The sense of euphoria
it offers is...

157
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,055
- You became addicted.
- You can't understand

158
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:49,300
unless you've
experienced it yourself.

159
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:51,078
It was a gift,

160
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,001
one that was denied me
after I allowed you

161
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:56,123
and your friends to escape us.

162
00:09:57,261 --> 00:09:59,670
Free me, and I'll get you some help.

163
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:01,145
I promise.

164
00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:03,737
Help is already on the way.

165
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,441
For both of us.

166
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:07,438
What does that mean?

167
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,578
What the hell did you do?

168
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:22,106
I've saved us.

169
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:41,064
I looked forward to the day
when you would finally serve me.

170
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:43,722
I'm going to feel real bad
disappointing you.

171
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:45,444
I'm sure you'll try.

172
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,699
But, in the end,

173
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:49,971
you'll come around.

174
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,412
Any news?

175
00:11:00,165 --> 00:11:02,066
- Not yet.
- I'm sorry.

176
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:04,981
We can draw comfort

177
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:07,804
from the fact
that he is a proven survivor.

178
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:11,257
He defied the odds
for many years as a runner.

179
00:11:12,215 --> 00:11:13,416
Yes, he did.

180
00:11:15,953 --> 00:11:17,615
How can I help you?

181
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:21,049
I wanted to apologize
for not having come to you sooner

182
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:23,686
with a decision regarding my position
on the Colonel's team.

183
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,363
Take whatever time you need.

184
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:27,684
If necessary,

185
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,276
I can assign someone
to fill in for you.

186
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:37,229
Do you have children?

187
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,409
No.

188
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:40,953
But I did have a Yorkie
for many years.

189
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:44,628
It's a small dog.

190
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:49,780
But my wife got him in the divorce.

191
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,319
I loved that dog.

192
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:58,461
I never really had the chance
to say goodbye.

193
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:02,228
So, no. No children.

194
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,102
Then, with all due respect,

195
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:07,605
you may not understand
how difficult this is for me.

196
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:12,664
For most of my life,

197
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,486
I never imagined the possibility
of leaving my people,

198
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,199
not even for a moment...

199
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:21,994
And then circumstances changed.

200
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,518
And after realizing a important role
on Colonel Sheppard's team,

201
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:31,539
I never imagined the day would come
when I would have to let it go.

202
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:34,507
And now here that day is.

203
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:39,717
Five years ago,
if anyone had asked me if I

204
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:42,876
ever planned on taking a job
outside of the Milky Way,

205
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,339
my answer would have been
a definite no.

206
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:46,463
And now...

207
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:48,850
Look at me.

208
00:12:49,697 --> 00:12:50,498
So...

209
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,628
While I can't empathize,

210
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,906
I certainly do sympathize.

211
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:02,128
Believe me, I know...

212
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:04,305
Priorities change.

213
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:09,443
And sometimes they don't.

214
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,009
Teyla, I'm sure
Kanaan will support you

215
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:19,427
whatever decision you make.

216
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:21,620
Yes.

217
00:13:21,795 --> 00:13:23,196
Of course he will.

218
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,501
Thank you, Mr. Woolsey.

219
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:46,432
How does it feel
to have your life stolen?

220
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:48,629
To be pushed so close
to the darkness,

221
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:50,583
only to be pulled back
from the brink?

222
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:53,210
From what I understand,

223
00:13:54,753 --> 00:13:56,839
it's a magnificent sensation.

224
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,385
To be honest,

225
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:01,107
I've felt better.

226
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:03,742
Defy me all you want.

227
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:06,325
Your fellow Satedans were no different.

228
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:07,744
Like them,

229
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:10,130
you'll eventually submit.

230
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:14,431
I'll die before I submit.

231
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:15,354
No.

232
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:17,734
You won't.

233
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:29,230
Hey.

234
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:32,219
- You're up early.
- It's 10:00 AM.

235
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:34,074
It is?

236
00:14:34,194 --> 00:14:35,961
Oh, God.
I didn't sleep at all.

237
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:39,757
I was up all night
thinking about this Ronon situation.

238
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:42,092
- Got anything?
- Nothing. I tried everything...

239
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:44,595
Pacing, snacking, bathing...

240
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:47,306
- Bathing.
- Yeah.

241
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:48,682
Like Archimedes.

242
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:51,020
You mean that greek scientist
who had a crush on Teyla?

243
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,819
No, like the greek mathematician who
came up with the Archimedes principle,

244
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:56,588
the physical laws of buoyancy.
According to legend,

245
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,623
the idea came to him
when he was sitting in the bath, so...

246
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,404
Look, the point is
that the revelation occurred

247
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:06,453
while he was, you know, relaxing.
He was not thinking about the problem.

248
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,138
And the solution, as it turns out,
was right in front of him all along.

249
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:12,139
- You think we've overlooked something?
- I don't know. Maybe.

250
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:15,313
Look, all I know is I was up all night
going over it and I'm drawing a blank,

251
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:18,003
so I could use a fresh perspective.

252
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:20,191
I'm not taking a bath with you.

253
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:22,698
Let's just go over what we know.

254
00:15:22,818 --> 00:15:25,344
According to Solen, Tyre's on the run.

255
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,402
And we can assume he's operating alone

256
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:30,641
because if he had backup,
they would have been in on the ambush.

257
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,477
Right. He's alone, with Ronon,
on the run.

258
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:35,639
So where would someone like that go?

259
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,450
I can think of 200 uninhabited planets
that would be perfect.

260
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,160
- Where do you want to start?
- How about Sarif Sur?

261
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,658
- What?
- We got a message from Solen.

262
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,432
He hears that Tyre and Ronon are
holed up on a planet called Sarif Sur.

263
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,702
Thank you, Archimedes.

264
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:53,539
- Major, get your team and gear up.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:57,323
There's just no point in holding on.

266
00:15:57,443 --> 00:15:59,946
You're just putting off the inevitable.

267
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:02,034
It's better

268
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:04,267
if you just accept it.

269
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,486
You mean better for you, don't you?

270
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:13,811
The Wraith cut you off

271
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:16,113
and this is your way back in,

272
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:19,965
by offering me up as a sacrifice.

273
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:24,821
No.

274
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,612
You're not the man I risked my life for.

275
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:34,972
You're a traitor
to the memory of our people.

276
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:39,418
You have no honor.

277
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:46,074
Things are progressing too slowly.
I have other matters to attend to.

278
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:49,136
We can continue this process
back at the lab.

279
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:53,084
And when will I receive my reward?

280
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:55,806
Your reward?

281
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:00,698
I brought him here as we agreed.
In exchange,

282
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:03,378
you promised to restore
our previous arrangement.

283
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:04,902
Did I?

284
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,487
You promised!

285
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,592
I'm afraid
I'm going to have to disappoint,

286
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:18,106
since your usefulness
has come to an end.

287
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,006
We'll get him.

288
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,716
See that you do, Colonel.

289
00:17:59,298 --> 00:18:00,290
Nothing.

290
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:02,744
So we were wrong.

291
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:05,136
It has been known to happen.

292
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:07,511
Hey, I always said this was a longshot.

293
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:10,086
<i>Colonel, this is Lorne.
We've got something.</i>

294
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:11,245
I knew it.

295
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,288
Over here.

296
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:28,444
We checked his pulse. It's barely there.
We've got to move him or we lose him.

297
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:30,780
- Where's Ronon?
- Good question.

298
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,249
His injuries are minor,

299
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:40,408
but both his heartrate
and blood pressure are elevated.

300
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,316
He woke up about an hour
after you brought him in.

301
00:18:43,436 --> 00:18:46,587
He was delirious, he was sweating,
nauseous,

302
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,004
trembling.

303
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:48,974
So

304
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,413
I sedated him

305
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:52,221
and ran some tests.

306
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:56,067
After giving him a drug
that blocks opioid receptors,

307
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:59,099
I noticed a drop
in dopamine levels here...

308
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,387
A central link
in the brain's reward circuit.

309
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,310
Right.
Meaning?

310
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:07,003
Meaning this type
of neurochemical activity

311
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:10,679
is identical to that
of reforming substance-users.

312
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,651
He's going through withdrawal.

313
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:18,691
I need you to save him, Doc.
Right now, he's our only lead.

314
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:21,378
If he dies, our chances
of finding Ronon go with him.

315
00:19:21,498 --> 00:19:24,169
Of course. But it could be days
before he's coherent enough

316
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,677
to tell us anything.

317
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:26,908
John!

318
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,088
Why wasn't informed
about the mission to rescue Ronon?

319
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,385
We were playing on a hunch.
We had to act fast.

320
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,739
I'm going go...
see if they're still serving lunch.

321
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:41,410
- It's taquito tuesday.
- I think I'll join you.

322
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,521
I'm surprised that you would be so quick
to move forward without me.

323
00:19:47,124 --> 00:19:48,315
Don't put this on me.

324
00:19:49,216 --> 00:19:51,640
You're the one having second thoughts
about returning to the team.

325
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:54,128
I cannot give you the option

326
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:55,948
every time we're going off-world.

327
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,447
This is not an easy decision for me.

328
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,550
You think you're the only one
feeling pressure?

329
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,972
I've got Woolsey pushing me hard
to find a replacement for you.

330
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:06,802
- What did you tell him?
- I told him I wasn't gonna do anything

331
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:09,721
until I talked to you.
Now, if you want to join the team,

332
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,878
great. I'll call Woolsey.
I'll make it happen.

333
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:14,873
But if you want to spend time
with your son, I understand. I do.

334
00:20:14,993 --> 00:20:16,240
I really do.

335
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:18,772
You've got to make a decision.

336
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:29,106
<i>You are finally awake.</i>

337
00:20:29,988 --> 00:20:32,225
The procedure can be very taxing.

338
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:35,586
You've been unconscious
for the better part of a day.

339
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:38,662
You're wasting your time.

340
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:41,618
I'll die before I turn.

341
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:43,495
Just like Marika and Hemi.

342
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:48,093
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

343
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,627
Your friends didn't die
because they were strong.

344
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:55,784
They died because they were too weak
to withstand the process.

345
00:20:56,186 --> 00:20:59,678
Their minds and bodies
eventually shut down under the strain.

346
00:21:01,342 --> 00:21:02,342
But you...

347
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,842
You're stronger.

348
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:10,280
And it is your strength

349
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,941
that will prove your undoing.

350
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:23,346
He broke through his restraints
this morning and injured two guards,

351
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:26,622
so I thought it would be best
to put him in isolation.

352
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:28,901
At least this way,
if he breaks free again,

353
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,293
he won't be an immediate danger
to anyone.

354
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,879
How long is it going
to take him to go through this?

355
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,757
To be honest, I'm not even sure he will.

356
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:37,838
<i>Please!</i>

357
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,596
<i>You're killing me!</i>

358
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:40,847
<i>Please!</i>

359
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,908
Can't you give him
something for the pain?

360
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:45,249
Sedatives will make him
more comfortable,

361
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:47,267
but they'll also slow down his recovery.

362
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,849
I want this to go as quick as possible.
No sedatives.

363
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,516
He's already sleeping?

364
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,635
Why does it take so much longer
when I try to put him down?

365
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:05,540
You worry too much.

366
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:07,889
Perhaps he senses your anxiety.

367
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:13,311
Maybe he prefers the comfort
of his mother's presence.

368
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:21,637
There may be times when he will have
to learn to do without.

369
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:27,783
Does that mean you've decided?

370
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:30,183
I thought so...

371
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:33,977
How can I return to the team
with the knowledge

372
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:37,981
that every time I step through the Gate,
there is a chance I might not come back?

373
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,728
That, given the dangers,

374
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:44,575
there's a possibility that our son
will grow up without a mother?

375
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,755
You have a responsibility to him.

376
00:23:54,238 --> 00:23:57,684
But you also have a responsibility
to the people of this galaxy.

377
00:24:00,824 --> 00:24:03,774
Follow your heart without remorse.

378
00:24:04,756 --> 00:24:06,788
And take comfort in knowing
that you'll be doing so

379
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:09,180
to safeguard the future of many,

380
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:13,356
including your son.

381
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:17,894
Just promise me
you'll be careful out there.

382
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,194
He's been awake and lucid
for about 10 minutes now.

383
00:24:22,314 --> 00:24:23,540
What did he say?

384
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,760
Only that he wanted to talk to you.

385
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:34,958
I know where they've taken Ronon.

386
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,591
- You can give us a Gate address?
- Better.

387
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:39,729
I'll lead you right
into the heart of the facility.

388
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:41,420
Well, you're still recovering.

389
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,605
Dr. Keller told me
there were no longer any traces

390
00:24:43,725 --> 00:24:45,236
of the Wraith enzyme in my system.

391
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:47,322
- That's not the point.
- Colonel, please.

392
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,440
Let me help you get Ronon back.

393
00:24:56,191 --> 00:24:58,255
No retreat in the face of battle.

394
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,355
No sympathy for the fallen.

395
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,104
No mercy for our enemies.

396
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:09,316
No retreat in the face of battle.

397
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:11,808
No sympathy for the fallen.

398
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:14,188
And no mercy to your enemies.

399
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:17,144
Our enemies.

400
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,649
Atlantis.

401
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:27,915
Atlantis.

402
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:30,974
No mercy.

403
00:25:39,897 --> 00:25:42,084
<i>He seems rational,
says he wants to help us.</i>

404
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:44,768
I say we trust him
only as much as we have to.

405
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:47,462
Use his intel,
but he stays here, under guard.

406
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:50,586
If you want to hit that Wraith facility,
we'll need all the help we can get,

407
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:52,427
and he knows that place inside and out.


408
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:55,330
Yes, and is thus in the perfect position
to lead you right into a trap.

409
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,329
All right, look, I think,
as much as he'd like us to believe it,

410
00:25:58,449 --> 00:26:01,099
this is not about regaining
some lost honor,

411
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:02,830
or some Satedan revenge thing.

412
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,455
It's about a desperate guy who's willing
to do anything to help his buddy.

413
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:08,278
And how can you be so certain of that?

414
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,134
Because I've been there.

415
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:13,523
Now, we have a chance to get Ronon,
and I'm going to take it,

416
00:26:13,643 --> 00:26:16,158
and you're going to need
to trust me on this.

417
00:26:16,582 --> 00:26:17,582
All right.

418
00:26:18,397 --> 00:26:20,338
Major Lorne's team
will be accompanying you.

419
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:23,362
- What is it? What's happening?
- We know where Ronon is.

420
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:25,336
- I'm coming with you.
- Gear up.

421
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:27,648
Teyla, this is exactly
the kind of decision we were...

422
00:26:27,768 --> 00:26:29,758
I was about to meet Kanaan
in the cafeteria.

423
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:32,842
Would you please explain to him
the situation?

424
00:26:32,962 --> 00:26:34,160
It's all right.

425
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,242
Please.

426
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:36,644
All right.

427
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:42,805
Well, well, well,

428
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:44,339
who have we here?

429
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,557
Cafeteria.

430
00:26:47,014 --> 00:26:48,147
Cafeteria.

431
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:03,625
This way.

432
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:18,036
What is this place?

433
00:27:18,573 --> 00:27:20,558
You were looking for a target area
that'd maximize

434
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:22,085
the effects of your explosives.

435
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:25,154
Well, this is it,
the facility's power relay chamber.

436
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,833
Hide your charges to avoid discovery.

437
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,581
Let's go.

438
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:44,922
I assume you have a means
to remote-detonate from a safe distance?

439
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:45,852
Well,

440
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,615
just flip...

441
00:27:48,257 --> 00:27:48,984
Click.

442
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:55,341
This way.

443
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:32,387
It's about time.

444
00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:34,989
What's going on, buddy?

445
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,094
We were beginning to wonder
if you'd ever show up.

446
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:42,181
You're at a disadvantage.

447
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:43,822
You could attempt an escape,

448
00:28:43,942 --> 00:28:46,478
but you'll have to sacrifice
your friend's life to do so.

449
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:50,619
Ronon, get out of the way.

450
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:51,900
I can't do that.

451
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,618
Ronon, step aside.

452
00:29:01,683 --> 00:29:04,108
His life wouldn't be
the only one forfeit.

453
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:05,272
Tyre...

454
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,724
Lower your weapons.

455
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:13,317
Take them away.

456
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,382
Ronon, what's happening here?

457
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:34,567
I assume this is a prize
worthy of reward?

458
00:29:35,696 --> 00:29:36,874
Welcome back.

459
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:48,358
On the bright side,
we'll never have to go back to Atlantis

460
00:29:48,478 --> 00:29:50,224
and hear Woolsey say
"I told you so."

461
00:29:50,344 --> 00:29:52,079
- We're gonna get outta here.
- Sure.

462
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:54,331
All we have to do
is escape from this cell, right?

463
00:29:54,451 --> 00:29:56,997
I mean, get past
all of the armed Wraith

464
00:29:57,117 --> 00:29:59,795
that are guarding the facility
and free Lorne and his team

465
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:01,353

to get back to the Jumper,

466
00:30:01,473 --> 00:30:03,435
which is probably
being disassembled as we speak,

467
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:05,556
and of course,
we've got to rescue Ronon who,

468
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:08,065
I don't know if you happened to notice,
isn't quite himself.

469
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:11,187
We're gonna get Ronon
and we're gonna go back to Atlantis.

470
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:13,889
And even if we do, then what, huh?

471
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:18,690
Tyre's recovery hasn't exactly been
the rousing success we were hoping for.

472
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,461
We're going to get

473
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:22,375
Ronon back.

474
00:30:25,055 --> 00:30:26,507
Yeah. Of course.

475
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:35,888
We're gonna get him back.

476
00:30:38,943 --> 00:30:41,505
You waste a huge opportunity
by killing them.

477
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:45,039
They have no use to me beyond
the information they can provide.

478
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,010
You underestimate their value.

479
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,142
Is it their value I underestimate,

480
00:30:49,302 --> 00:30:52,020
- or your loyalty I overestimate?
- Ronon's right.

481
00:30:52,305 --> 00:30:55,593
They're much more useful to you alive
and cooperative.

482
00:30:56,346 --> 00:30:57,734
They just need some convincing.

483
00:31:01,935 --> 00:31:03,469
All right, I've got it.

484
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:06,444
We tell them we have vital information
that we're willing to give up,

485
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:09,745
but we will only share it with Ronon.
So they send Ronon,

486
00:31:09,923 --> 00:31:12,006
he shows up, we appeal to him...

487
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:14,596
I mean, the part of him
that's still him.

488
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:17,473
Well, I can only think of
three things wrong with that plan,

489
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:18,696
but go on.

490
00:31:18,816 --> 00:31:20,630
He hasn't been brainwashed
as long as Tyre,

491
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,598
he might be
more susceptible to our influence.

492
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:24,795
We convince him to let us out
or lead us outta here,

493
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:27,251
and then, worst-case scenario,
he's not entirely convinced...

494
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:28,922
That's your worst-case scenario?

495
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:30,996
Hey, I'm just spinning here, but

496
00:31:31,116 --> 00:31:34,229
you know, we could take advantage
of that moment of uncertainty and...

497
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:40,831
You've been summoned.

498
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:43,892
Do you want to,
go over the plan one more time?

499
00:31:44,012 --> 00:31:46,146
No. No, I think I'm good.

500
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:48,955
I guess it's my turn
for the sales pitch, huh?

501
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:05,013
Wait.

502
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:07,287
We need to get something.

503
00:32:26,714 --> 00:32:27,574
Kneel.

504
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:31,327
You know what would be really creepy
and unexpected, is if you knelt instead.

505
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:35,943
God...

506
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:37,696
I guess not.

507
00:32:40,052 --> 00:32:42,244
All right,
I'll try and make it work.

508
00:32:43,312 --> 00:32:45,175
I appreciate your defiance.

509
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:49,147
Ronon, I really need you
to snap out of it about now.

510
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,306
It will make turning you

511
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,256
all the more enjoyable.

512
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:42,949
- How'd you get out?
- Tyre freed us. Let's go.

513
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:44,562
Okay, come on, guys.

514
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:18,153
Go, go, go!

515
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:22,375
- How's it going?
- Not so good!

516
00:34:29,872 --> 00:34:31,968
My guys are holding them off,
but not for much longer.

517
00:34:32,088 --> 00:34:33,269
Give me that.

518
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:37,299
Tell them to back off.

519
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:40,139
My life will be a small price to pay

520
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:42,345
for the lives of you

521
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:43,852
and your team.

522
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:50,386
Then how about the destruction
of this facility?

523
00:34:50,893 --> 00:34:53,276
Is that a small enough price
as well?

524
00:34:53,578 --> 00:34:54,598
You lie.

525
00:34:54,995 --> 00:34:57,306
I told them where to hide the charges
for maximum effect,

526
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:00,393
enough explosives to destroy this place
and all of its research.

527
00:35:00,643 --> 00:35:03,062
Any advantage your hive may hold
over its rivals

528
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:05,064
will be gone
with the push of a button.

529
00:35:09,464 --> 00:35:10,464
Wait!

530
00:35:23,828 --> 00:35:25,685
Tell them to let us through.

531
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,093
What's to stop you
from triggering the explosives

532
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:31,507
- from a safe distance?
- My presence here.

533
00:35:37,062 --> 00:35:39,110
You let them go. I'll remain behind.

534
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:41,688
Once they've reached the Gate,

535
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:44,604
I'll trade you this device
for my freedom.

536
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:48,608
Or we all die together.

537
00:35:54,124 --> 00:35:55,124
Let them go.

538
00:36:10,248 --> 00:36:12,056
I'll be right behind you.

539
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:19,206
Let's go.

540
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:47,837
You turn your back
on an incredible gift.

541
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:51,495
Actually, you turned your back
on me first.

542
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,381
And I thank you for it.

543
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:54,930
<i>We're clear.</i>

544
00:36:55,961 --> 00:36:58,111
You're not beyond forgiveness.

545
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,514
It's not too late for you.

546
00:37:02,194 --> 00:37:03,372
Yes, it is...

547
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:05,838
For both of us.

548
00:37:26,564 --> 00:37:29,431
What kind of a timeframe for recovery
are we looking at?

549
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:31,294
It's impossible to predict.

550
00:37:31,454 --> 00:37:33,198
He has so much of the enzyme


551
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,798
that his body can hardly process it.

552
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:38,401
When it eventually does,

553
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:40,565
that's when he'll come down,

554
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,812
and he'll come down hard.

555
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:44,620
I'm gonna talk to him.

556
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:50,867
Open it.

557
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:56,416
There he is.

558
00:37:58,827 --> 00:37:59,932
Hey, buddy.

559
00:38:00,557 --> 00:38:01,574
Buddy.

560
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:05,668
So, how long are you planning
on keeping me prisoner?

561
00:38:05,788 --> 00:38:07,747
As long as it takes
to clear your head.

562
00:38:07,907 --> 00:38:09,332
My head is clear.

563
00:38:09,492 --> 00:38:11,500
Well, you may be feeling fine
right now,

564
00:38:11,814 --> 00:38:14,086
but things are going
to get pretty rough for you.

565
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,814
We're gonna get you through this.

566
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:19,675
Whatever you've got planned,
it's not gonna work.

567
00:38:20,182 --> 00:38:21,612
You've got a choice...

568
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,472
You'd better kill me or you let me go.

569
00:38:24,745 --> 00:38:26,140
And if you let me go,

570
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,101
I promise I won't
come after you or Atlantis.

571
00:38:30,156 --> 00:38:32,997
- And after Tyre neither.
- Tyre's dead.

572
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:37,777
He sacrificed himself
taking out the Wraith lab.

573
00:38:39,373 --> 00:38:42,549
- Yeah, well, he was a traitor.
- No, he was a good friend.

574
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:44,399
We all are.

575
00:38:46,747 --> 00:38:48,955
You're going to realize that
pretty soon.

576
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,455
Hey, will you just kill me
or set me free.

577
00:38:52,975 --> 00:38:54,879
You kill me or set me free!

578
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:09,041
Kill me please!

579
00:39:10,085 --> 00:39:11,852
Please kill me!

580
00:39:12,822 --> 00:39:13,891
No!

581
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:49,761
I had what they called piano fingers...
Slim, nimble.

582
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:52,093
It's no surprise
 my parents signed me up for lessons.

583
00:39:52,213 --> 00:39:54,922
My first teacher, of course,
hailed me as a natural.

584
00:39:55,222 --> 00:39:58,130
Big russian woman,
Polanskii or Baranski or...

585
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:00,198
Oh, no, definitely a "ski".

586
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:07,658
How do you feel?

587
00:40:10,754 --> 00:40:12,038
Like hitting someone.

588
00:40:14,385 --> 00:40:15,499
Anyone in particular?

589
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,755
You, if you don't loosen these straps
and get me something to eat.

590
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:22,953
That is a good sign.

591
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:24,591
That's a good sign!

592
00:40:25,283 --> 00:40:27,214
He's back! He's back!

593
00:40:28,947 --> 00:40:30,556
So he's fully recovered?

594
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,115
Well, physically he's still weak,

595
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:36,797
but his bloodwork shows
no traces of the enzyme in his system,

596
00:40:37,386 --> 00:40:40,372
so he should be back
to his old self in no time.

597
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,289
Good to hear.

598
00:40:42,686 --> 00:40:45,070
Well, it's late.
I think I'll head back to my quarters

599
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,306
and change into
something a little more relaxed.

600
00:40:47,426 --> 00:40:48,522
Good night.

601
00:40:53,288 --> 00:40:55,398
John, may I have a word?

602
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:57,001
Yeah. Sure.

603
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:05,633
Teyla. Come in.

604
00:41:09,755 --> 00:41:13,542
I thought you said you were changing
into something more relaxed.

605
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,967
For me, this is more relaxed.

606
00:41:17,528 --> 00:41:19,396
- Can I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you.

607
00:41:20,065 --> 00:41:21,254
I just spoke with John,

608
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:23,829
and now I would like
to make it official.

609
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:25,986
I'm requesting a return
to active duty.

610
00:41:26,213 --> 00:41:29,802
I would like to resume my position
on Colonel Sheppard's team.

611
00:41:30,078 --> 00:41:32,143
You're sure this is what you want?

612
00:41:32,263 --> 00:41:33,369
Very much so.

613
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:35,621
Well, then, welcome back.

614
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,091
Thank you, Mr. Woolsey.

615
00:41:38,447 --> 00:41:40,328
- Good night.
- Good night.
