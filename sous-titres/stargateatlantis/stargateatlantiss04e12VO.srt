<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis.

2
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:05,891
<i>You have some Wraith DNA.</i>

3
00:00:06,011 --> 00:00:08,053
<i>My father told people
that it was a gift.</i>

4
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:09,679
I could help my people by warning

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:11,199
<i>them of the Wraiths' approach.</i>

6
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:13,490
<i>If I can reach out with my mind
and establish a link...</i>

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,380
<i>No! That's a little reckless,
don't you think?</i>

8
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:19,154
- Teyla.
- You are all about to die!

9
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:22,747
You refer to our enemy
as the Replicators.

10
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:26,404
They have begun
to annihilate human worlds.

11
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:28,029
<i>Our old anti-Replicator technology</i>

12
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:31,284
<i>relied on disrupting the bonds
between each individual nanite's cells.</i>

13
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:32,810
We do the opposite.

14
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,704
<i>Instead of severing their connections,</i>

15
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:37,045
<i>we significantly dial up
their attraction to one another,</i>

16
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:40,043
<i>We turn each cell into an incredibly
powerful nanite magnet.</i>

17
00:00:44,334 --> 00:00:46,091
Our shields can't take
much more of this.

18
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:47,731
Hopefully, they won't have to.

19
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:52,502
Son of a bitch.

20
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:55,300
He actually did it.

21
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:04,454
The Replicator ships have ceased firing.

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,151
The humans' plan worked.

23
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:08,763
Give me status on the darts.

24
00:01:08,883 --> 00:01:10,448
<i>Approaching the Replicator city.</i>

25
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:23,304
The Replicator's mass
is sinking into the planet.

26
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:24,838
We do not have much time.

27
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:27,173
We're not leaving without those darts.

28
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:37,094
The mass is approaching
critical density.

29
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:39,262
An explosion is imminent.

30
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:43,097
Commander. We must jump into hyperspace.

31
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:45,713
Not until I get what I came for.

32
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:54,701
The darts are on approach.

33
00:01:57,335 --> 00:01:58,518
<i>We have them.</i>

34
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:18,302
<i>I have the rematerialized cargo
from the darts.</i>

35
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:30,110
Now we have what we need
to complete our mission.

36
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:37,019
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

44
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:38,439
Rodney, what have you got?

45
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,955
It's only been a week since the battle
but a pretty clear pattern is emerging.

46
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:43,868
You can see it
on the long-range scanners.

47
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:46,333
The Wraith have split up
into distinct groups.

48
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:49,367
Now they're done with the Replicators,
they're sizing each other up.

49
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:51,710
Too many Wraith,
not enough humans to feed on.

50
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,905
Intel's claiming
there are several different factions.

51
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,732
With any luck they'll find themselves
in the middle of a nice long civil war

52
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:59,576
but what I find
particularly interesting is this.

53
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:03,620
- What is it?
- That's our old friend,

54
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,666
the Wraith that helped me save Jeanie
and got us all those hive ships.

55
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:07,886
How do you know?

56
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:10,843
Well, the sub-space tracking device
he used. It's the same signal.

57
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:12,549
Why would he reactivate it?

58
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,617
I have no idea.

59
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:16,540
I think it's safe to assume that he'd
know we were monitoring that frequency.

60
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,088
- You think he's sending us a message.
- Maybe. It's like I said.

61
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,840
The hive ships that we've been tracking
have formed into distinct groups,

62
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,468
but this one's out there by itself.

63
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:26,429
It's floating in the middle of space,
nowhere near a habitable planet

64
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:28,646
and almost an hour's sub-light
from the nearest Gate.

65
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:30,565
So what does he want?

66
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:34,360
Well, that's the question.

67
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,113
Hey.

68
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:48,832
Ronon.

69
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:52,186
Do you wish to use this machine?

70
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,755
No. I just didn't expect
to find you here.

71
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:56,925
Why not?

72
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,458
Shouldn't you be taking it easy?

73
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:02,044
I'm pregnant, Ronon, not ill.

74
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:06,524
In any case, Doctor Keller said
it wouldn't hurt to continue exercising.

75
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:09,799
- In fact, it's beneficial.
- You're hitting it pretty hard.

76
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:12,281
Well, I have to remain
in top physical condition

77
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:14,484
if I'm to keep up
with you and the rest of the team.

78
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,533
Who says you have to keep up?

79
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:27,348
Any change?

80
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:30,566
No, he's still sitting out there.

81
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:32,562
It's been almost 24 hours.

82
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:34,671
His ship could be disabled.

83
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,465
- You think it's a distress call?
- Ah, maybe.

84
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:39,415
Any other hive ships
picking up the signal?

85
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:42,469
If they are, they're ignoring it.
We're showing no other activity.

86
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:44,555
How far did you say
the nearest Gate was?

87
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:46,437
Well, it's about an hour by Jumper.

88
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:48,984
Oh, look, I know
we worked with this guy before,

89
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:51,725
and he has helped us out in the past,
but he's still a Wraith.

90
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,095
We don't seriously feel like
we owe him anything, do we?

91
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:56,221
No, no, of course not, but,

92
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:58,387
that doesn't mean
it's not worth checking out.

93
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:06,384
Teyla.

94
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:08,566
Colonel.

95
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:09,938
<i>I just heard.</i>

96
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:13,376
I would like to accompany you
on this mission.

97
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:15,420
Well, we've got it covered.

98
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:19,410
John, I understand what
you're trying to do, but I assure you,

99
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:21,453
<i>it is not necessary.</i>

100
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:24,466
<i>My skills have not diminished.</i>

101
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,389
I still have much to offer the team.

102
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:31,064
All right, guys, let's head out.

103
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,014
We'll wait for you
at the Jumper bay, Sir.

104
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:40,041
I'm not even...

105
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:46,325
I'm not having this conversation again.

106
00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:48,578
We have not had it yet.

107
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:52,196
In fact, we've barely spoken
since I told you I was pregnant.

108
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:54,000
It's been a little busy around here.

109
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:58,536
I understand why you did not want me to
join the attack on the Replicator world,

110
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:01,253
but that was a special circumstance.

111
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:03,791
Look, even the simplest op
can become dangerous.

112
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:05,970
- And I accept that.
- You think it's that simple?

113
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,514
Is this about you trying to protect me,
or are you still angry

114
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:11,292
- because I did not tell you sooner?
- This is about your people missing.

115
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:14,020
This is about the father
of your child missing.

116
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,179
<i>You want to go out,
you want to tear it up,</i>

117
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:18,066
<i>you want to kick ass, but you can't!</i>

118
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:20,902
And the sooner you realize that,
the better.

119
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,296
Pull up the hud.
We're in range.

120
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:45,948
I've got it, dead ahead.

121
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,415
Looks like it's been
shot up pretty bad.

122
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:49,976
From the Replicator battle?

123
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:52,934
No, I'm picking up residual radiation
from Wraith weapons fire.

124
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:54,811
Were they attacked by another hive?

125
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:56,479
Well, it looks that way.

126
00:07:57,565 --> 00:07:58,948
Any life signs?

127
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:03,444
- I'm not picking up anything.
- Maybe they're hibernating.

128
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:06,397
Seems an odd thing to do
after being attacked.

129
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:08,991
Plus, they usually land the ship.

130
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:13,875
All right. Well, we didn't come
all this way to turn back, so...

131
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:15,540
I'm going in.

132
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:23,756
Lorne, you got anything?

133
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:26,085
Nothing so far.

134
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:31,707
Oh, we've got bodies.

135
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:33,935
<i>Acknowledged.
We'll keep looking.</i>

136
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,704
Looks like they were fed on.

137
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:52,034
Still picking up the Wraith's
tracking device. It's that way.

138
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:06,909
Reading's stronger in here.

139
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:16,123
I don't see our guy.

140
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:17,314
You?

141
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:19,490
No.

142
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:23,145
We're not going to find him.

143
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:26,069
- I thought we were tracking the device.
- We are...

144
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:32,623
Someone cut it out of him.

145
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:45,566
No sign of the rest. Whoever attacked
the ship must've taken 'em prisoner.

146
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,016
Including our friend.

147
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:49,372
Stop calling him that.
It's weird.

148
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,221
- What do you want him to call him?
- I don't know, let's go with...

149
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:54,768
Todd.

150
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:58,503
It's a guy I knew in college.
He was very pale.

151
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:01,045
- Todd's a terrible name.
- You got a better one?

152
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:03,530
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- You know what? Forget I asked.

153
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,440
<i>Colonel?</i>

154
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,858
What do we do now?

155
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:08,455
Well, that all depends.

156
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:10,271
Is this thing going to fly?

157
00:10:10,391 --> 00:10:11,749
Hull's severely damaged.

158
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:14,687
Let's see, about 30% of the ship
is sealed off and exposed to space,

159
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:18,370
but with a little work, I think
we can get main systems back online.

160
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:19,819
That settles it.

161
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,964
We've got ourselves a new ship.

162
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,925
Colonel. I didn't expect
to see you back so soon.

163
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:34,318
No engagement.
The only Wraith onboard were dead.

164
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:37,183
- Was the ship badly damaged?
- She's definitely taken a few hits.

165
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,192
McKay's working on repairs,
but that is the easy part.

166
00:10:40,312 --> 00:10:41,787
What's the hard part?

167
00:10:45,642 --> 00:10:46,867
The ship's been secured,

168
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:50,220
there's no immediate danger,
and you're the only one who can fly it.

169
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,904
Even in my condition?

170
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:56,849
All right, I might have been
a little tough on you before.

171
00:10:57,932 --> 00:10:59,161
No, you were right.

172
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,039
I'm just trying to understand
my position.

173
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:04,250
You're still a member of my team.

174
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:05,529
Am I?

175
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,003
You always were.

176
00:11:08,122 --> 00:11:10,214
Look, it's my call

177
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:13,342
whether or not you go on a mission.
Take it or leave it.

178
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,807
When do we go?

179
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:26,386
Hey.

180
00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:28,657
I found these in the Jumper.

181
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,347
Thank you. I'm starving.

182
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:34,363
"Apricot jubilee?"

183
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:37,296
- Well, you don't want it...
- No, no. That's fine.

184
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:40,310
<i>- So, how are we doing in here anyways?
- It's coming along.</i>

185
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,894
I got the hyperdrive operational.

186
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:45,609
That's not going to help much if I can't
get the neural interface to work.

187
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,223
What'd you do?

188
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:50,755
- Nothing.
- You touched something, didn't you?

189
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:51,761
No.

190
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:53,916
Maybe just a little.

191
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:56,121
What is it?

192
00:11:58,062 --> 00:11:59,062
Looks like a map.

193
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:01,948
Thank you, Captain Obvious.
Of course, it's a map.

194
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:04,500
The question is, a map to what?

195
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:12,311
I wanted to tell you sooner...

196
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,650
but I found out
shortly after Dr. Keller and I

197
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,449
returned from New Athos.
It was a difficult time.

198
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:20,054
It's okay. I get it.

199
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:23,688
Now, along with everything else,

200
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,866
I'm burdened with the thought that...

201
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:29,585
this child may be the last of my people.

202
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,149
We don't know that yet.

203
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:33,941
But you understand
why I cannot just stay in Atlantis

204
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:35,591
and do nothing.

205
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:41,132
My best hope in learning their fate
Is to be out here with you.

206
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,253
<i>- How's it coming?</i>
- Ah, you're back.

207
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:50,190
Well, I've managed to get the neural
interface talking to the main systems,

208
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,775
but I've got no way to test it,
so it's gonna need some tweaking.

209
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:55,039
Biggest problem so far
has been with the weapons array,

210
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,262
- but I think I've managed to...
- Wait. Weapons array?

211
00:12:57,382 --> 00:12:59,600
I thought they'd come in handy
when we go after the Wraith.

212
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,995
- What are you talking about?
- I figured out where this ship

213
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,286
- was headed before it was attacked.
- <i>We figured it out.</i>

214
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:08,642
Yeah, right. All you did was activate a
screen. I'm the one who searched through

215
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:11,585
the ship's log and found the mention
of the top-secret Wraith outpost.

216
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:13,337
What Wraith outpost?

217
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:15,271
I'm sorry, I assumed

218
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,050
a level of uncertainty was implied
by my use of the phrase "top secret."

219
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,755
- In other words, he doesn't know.
- The log didn't specify.

220
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,596
But whatever this is,
they talk about it

221
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:24,810
like it was sacred.
from what I can gather, it played

222
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,435
a pivotal role in helping the Wraith
win against the Ancients.

223
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:29,476
Which is why we got to check it out.

224
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:31,755
All right, wait,
just hold on here a second.

225
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,738
Let's just slow down. We don't even
know if this thing can fly... Let al...

226
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:41,438
- How did you do that?
- I don't know.

227
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:44,250
My abilities appear to be
stronger than before.

228
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,744
<i>She's not kidding!</i>

229
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:49,165
According to this, navigation,
propulsion and communications're online.

230
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:52,831
Teyla?

231
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:55,118
I cannot explain it.

232
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,966
The moment I connected with the ship,
everything became available to me.

233
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:02,195
I can feel the various systems
at my disposal.

234
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:03,386
Can you fly it?

235
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:05,345
I'm not sure.

236
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,904
She's flying it, all right.

237
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,446
You okay?

238
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,528
Yes. I'm fine.

239
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,580
It's easier than it was last time.

240
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,535
It's almost effortless.

241
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,454
Hey, don't look at me.
I didn't do anything.

242
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:35,920
The coordinates to the outpost are
in the computer. I can take us there.

243
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,215
That's not why I brought you here.
We can wait for the Daedalus.

244
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:43,702
The hive that attacked this ship had
access to the same information, and by

245
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,470
now, it is almost a day ahead of us.

246
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:48,990
Now, if that outpost is
as important as the log suggest,

247
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,520
do you really think
we can afford to wait?

248
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:52,855
All right.

249
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,189
Get us close, but keep us out of sensor
range. We'll take a Jumper from there.

250
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:10,156
Well, what's up?

251
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:13,465
I decided to go over
the remainder of the ship's log

252
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:16,250
- for any other mention of the outpost.
- And?

253
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:19,344
There's nothing. Can you believe it?
This thing goes back a long way.

254
00:15:19,464 --> 00:15:22,177
As far as I can tell, they haven't been
to this place in thousands of years.

255
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,305
So why now?

256
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:27,226
We've reached our coordinates.
I'm dropping us out of hyperspace.

257
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,063
The planet is just ahead.

258
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:35,186
I have established an orbit around one
of its moons, just out of sensor range.

259
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:37,766
All right, let's get to the Jumper.

260
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:42,939
It's all right, I'm fine. I'm fine.

261
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:56,363
This is exactly the kind of situation
I didn't want to put you in.

262
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,361
I know.

263
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:02,713
I need somebody to stay behind and fly
the ship in case we get into trouble.

264
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,622
Of course.

265
00:16:03,742 --> 00:16:06,352
I'm going to have
Lorne and his men stay here.

266
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:07,424
Good luck.

267
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:22,442
Anything?

268
00:16:22,604 --> 00:16:24,601
We should be in sensor range...

269
00:16:24,721 --> 00:16:25,452
Now.

270
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:30,159
- What?
- Well, there's a space Gate.

271
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:32,328
What, now you're telling me this?

272
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:34,955
I didn't know! Look,
the log wasn't exactly easy reading.

273
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:36,415
All right, anything else?

274
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:38,751
Yeah.

275
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,381
I'm picking up an energy reading
on the surface.

276
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,668
Any idea what it is?

277
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:44,104
No.

278
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:46,969
But there's something else...

279
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:49,153
A hive ship in orbit.

280
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,333
Well...

281
00:16:53,351 --> 00:16:55,356
At least we didn't miss the party.

282
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:06,853
No guards.

283
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:09,200
They're probably not expecting
any visitors.

284
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:11,566
- What say we keep it that way?
- Which way?

285
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:14,182
The energy readings
are strongest over here.

286
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,196
How big is this place?

287
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:24,692
Don't worry. I've got
an excellent sense of direction.

288
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:27,322
Didn't you say you got lost
in a garden maze once?

289
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:29,802
I was 10!
Plus, I was running from a bee.

290
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:44,800
What the hell is this?

291
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:47,143
<i>It's a queen.</i>

292
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:49,332
Nice work, Sherlock.

293
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:52,111
- But what's she doing?
- I have no idea.

294
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:54,047
Sheppard!

295
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,829
- Oh, that's just... revolting.
- What is it?

296
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:18,886
Hey, check this out.

297
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:33,364
Hey! We've got company!

298
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:34,971
<i>Go! Go! Move!</i>

299
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:51,084
This one is ready.

300
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:14,645
Put him with the others.

301
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,602
I'm definitely going to have
nightmares about that.

302
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:26,071
You think this is
some kind of Wraith farm?

303
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:27,748
<i>That's what it looks like.</i>

304
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:30,767
The queen secretes genetic material,
which gets distributed

305
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:35,028
through the structure into those pods.
Presto, newborn Wraith.

306
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:36,142
Nice.

307
00:19:36,714 --> 00:19:39,858
Yeah, I know, it sounds disgusting,
but it actually makes sense.

308
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,111
You got to remember,
they're descended from insects, right?

309
00:19:45,862 --> 00:19:48,260
The thing I don't understand is,
why here?

310
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,338
We always did assume that this
took place on their hive ships...

311
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,686
But what's so special about this place?

312
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:56,647
I think I have an idea.

313
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:07,659
Oh, my god. Pods!

314
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:09,502
Thousands of pods!

315
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,593
<i>Patch into the Wraith console.</i>

316
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:21,608
I've got internal schematics.

317
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:25,853
What?

318
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:29,037
If I'm reading this right,
what we saw from the surface

319
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:32,410
was just the tip of the iceberg.
This thing is miles in diameter.

320
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:35,933
Are there any other chambers like this?

321
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,605
Over a hundred.

322
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:46,203
It doesn't make any sense!

323
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:48,828
There's no way a single queen
could provide enough genetic material

324
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:51,743
- to fertilize all those pods.
- Maybe there's more than one.

325
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:54,423
Queens don't work together.
At least, not as far as we know.

326
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,779
All I know is, this place was built
to create some kind of a Wraith army,

327
00:20:57,899 --> 00:20:59,284
and we can't let that happen.

328
00:20:59,404 --> 00:21:02,323
You've seen how big it is. I doubt
our C-4's gonna make much of a dent.

329
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:04,053
So we fire at it from orbit.

330
00:21:04,173 --> 00:21:07,168
See, theoretically that could work.
The problem is there's another hive ship

331
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:09,856
out there. They'd be on top of us
long before we could finish the job.

332
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:11,523
What about the power supply, huh?

333
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,358
Maybe. Guess we could shut'em down

334
00:21:13,518 --> 00:21:15,277
<i>- for a while.</i>
- That's a start.

335
00:21:19,228 --> 00:21:21,937
Only problem is, these readings
are coming from all around us.

336
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:24,029
We're basically in the middle
of a giant machine.

337
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,787
I'm not sure I can pinpoint the source.

338
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:47,498
Wake her.

339
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:05,452
What has happened?

340
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:08,673
You've done well.

341
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:11,157
The second batch of warriors
is flawless.

342
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:14,169
<i>We now have a suitable genetic template</i>

343
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:17,005
with which to proceed to the next phase.

344
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:20,378
Where is the commander
of the fallen hive?

345
00:22:20,864 --> 00:22:22,302
He's in a holding cell.

346
00:22:23,082 --> 00:22:25,875
<i>He completed the recalibration
that was required.</i>

347
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:28,256
I must regain my strength.

348
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,227
Bring him to me.

349
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:35,073
His understanding of this technology
is impressive.

350
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:37,035
You may wish to keep him alive.

351
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,111
You said the device was ready.

352
00:22:39,453 --> 00:22:40,328
It is.

353
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:44,574
We are simply making final adjustments
before we bring main power online.

354
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,202
Then he has outlived his usefulness,

355
00:22:49,156 --> 00:22:50,962
and I must feed.

356
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:54,501
Unless you are volunteering yourself?

357
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,641
Bring him!

358
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:17,399
I believe I'm about
to receive my reward.

359
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,613
So be it.

360
00:23:26,426 --> 00:23:27,605
Sheppard.

361
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:29,149
How did you find me?

362
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:30,622
We followed them.

363
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,032
You picked up my signal.
I wasn't sure you would come.

364
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,210
What are friends for?

365
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,837
Now... tell us everything you know,

366
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:42,201
or you're going to be joining
your two friends here on the floor.

367
00:23:50,101 --> 00:23:50,996
<i>Hey.</i>

368
00:23:51,404 --> 00:23:52,714
Any word yet?

369
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:55,060
No, they've not been in contact.

370
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:57,052
Well,

371
00:23:57,314 --> 00:23:59,591
guess there's not much
to do but wait, huh?

372
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:07,522
Listen, I never got a chance
to congratulate you.

373
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:09,166
That's really great.

374
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:12,120
I didn't even know
you were dating anyone.

375
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:16,578
My sister has a couple of kids.

376
00:24:16,953 --> 00:24:19,058
Two boys, five and seven.

377
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,717
I miss being around'em.

378
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:24,834
I'm not really sure what to expect.

379
00:24:27,338 --> 00:24:28,766
Nobody ever is.

380
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:31,342
At least, not with the first one.

381
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:33,701
But you get through it.

382
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,687
You're going to make a great mom.

383
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:40,129
Thank you.

384
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,273
I wish I could be so sure.

385
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,158
Dr. Mckay is quite correct.

386
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:53,828
<i>It would be impossible for a queen
to breed so many warriors all at once,</i>

387
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:55,558
<i>except by artificial means.</i>

388
00:24:55,678 --> 00:24:57,124
What are you talking about?

389
00:24:57,435 --> 00:24:59,714
The queen creates
a handful of warriors,

390
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:02,868
each of which is then reproduced
thousands of times over.

391
00:25:02,988 --> 00:25:04,895
This is a cloning facility.

392
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:08,909
That's why it was key to their victory
over the Ancients. We always knew they

393
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,533
did it with greater numbers,
we just never knew where they came from.

394
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:14,728
Aren't there too many wraith in the
galaxy already? A couple of weeks ago

395
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:18,211
when you were fighting the Replicators,
it might've made sense, but why now?

396
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,606
Answer the man.

397
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,995
We didn't use this facility
during the Replicator war

398
00:25:26,115 --> 00:25:28,238
because we didn't have
the means to power it.

399
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:30,574
The energy requirements
are enormous.

400
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:31,753
<i>ZPMs.</i>

401
00:25:32,152 --> 00:25:33,933
He's talking about ZPMs.

402
00:25:34,302 --> 00:25:37,664
I managed to acquire a few before
the Replicator planet was destroyed.

403
00:25:37,824 --> 00:25:40,450
And I was all set
to feel bad about killing you.

404
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,798
My intention was to create an army
to wipe out the other Wraith,

405
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:47,424
but I was betrayed by one of my crew.
He had informed another hive

406
00:25:47,584 --> 00:25:50,135
<i>- of my plans.</i>
- The one that disabled your ship?

407
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:54,132
<i>This is good news, right?</i>

408
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:57,518
It means all we have to do to shut this
place down is get our hands on the ZPMs.

409
00:25:57,638 --> 00:25:59,159
And I know where they are.

410
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,557
I'm sure you haven't come
all this way just to rescue me,

411
00:26:01,677 --> 00:26:03,946
but it would be in your best interest.

412
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:07,549
Let's go.

413
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:20,572
Through there.

414
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,743
We'll see if it's clear, you stay here.

415
00:26:29,477 --> 00:26:31,058
There's one thing I don't understand.

416
00:26:31,178 --> 00:26:33,970
Back when you defeated the Ancients,
how did you get your hands on a ZPM?

417
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,032
The Lantians were powerful but careless.

418
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:40,716
Believing their ships were unbeatable,
they sent them deeper and deeper,

419
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:43,355
<i>into Wraith-controlled territory,
trying to weed us out.</i>

420
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,325
It took months but eventually,
we were able to capture three of them,

421
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:49,611
each one powered by a ZPM.

422
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:51,665
At which point,
you brought them back here.

423
00:26:51,785 --> 00:26:56,541
Within weeks, our army had grown
to hundreds of times its original size.

424
00:26:57,406 --> 00:26:59,937
From that point on,
the tide of war turned in our favor,

425
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:01,864
and there was nothing
the Lantians could do.

426
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,066
Save the history lesson for later.
Let's go.

427
00:27:04,186 --> 00:27:05,101
Right.

428
00:27:11,501 --> 00:27:13,179
They've discovered my absence!

429
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,720
Well, then we're going to have
to move quickly.

430
00:27:25,516 --> 00:27:26,523
This way!

431
00:27:31,437 --> 00:27:32,248
Go!

432
00:27:56,158 --> 00:27:57,270
Oh, man.

433
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,641
I got stunned.

434
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:03,134
Yeah, we know, Rodney. We all did.

435
00:28:03,254 --> 00:28:04,539
You did?

436
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:06,693
How come I'm the last one to wake up?

437
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,165
Where's Todd?

438
00:28:11,285 --> 00:28:12,351
He escaped.

439
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:13,799
Well, that's good, isn't it?

440
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,260
He'll come back for us.
I mean, after all, we saved him.

441
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:18,658
Something tells me
we're on our own with this one.

442
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:21,106
Something tells me
it's not going to matter.

443
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:28,721
Open it.

444
00:28:33,095 --> 00:28:35,091
You're letting us out?
That's very kind of you.

445
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:36,695
Bring them.

446
00:28:51,872 --> 00:28:53,651
The commander of the other hive escaped,

447
00:28:54,845 --> 00:28:56,071
but I brought you these.

448
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:15,438
Inform the hive.

449
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:18,343
Have them begin searching
the area for their ship.

450
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:21,388
In the meantime,

451
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:25,517
I have a few questions
that need to be answered.

452
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:28,882
What is it?

453
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:30,980
I have detected a dart
approaching our position.

454
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:34,375
It could be a scout.
Have they spotted us?

455
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:35,860
I don't know.

456
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,542
Did you detect any communication
between the dart and the other hive?

457
00:29:38,662 --> 00:29:40,298
- No.
- Then we still have a chance.

458
00:29:40,418 --> 00:29:42,046
We should destroy it.

459
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,160
Colonel Sheppard
has flown a dart before.

460
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,967
He would've radioed us by now,

461
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:48,081
and we can't risk sending out
a signal of our own.

462
00:29:54,352 --> 00:29:55,673
Charging weapons.

463
00:29:58,531 --> 00:29:59,384
<i>Do not fire.</i>

464
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:01,764
<i>You recognize me?</i>

465
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:03,665
Yes.

466
00:30:04,693 --> 00:30:06,474
Have you seen our people?

467
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:07,602
<i>I have.</i>

468
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,228
<i>I will tell you everything,
but you must allow me onboard.</i>

469
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:19,221
<i>- They were captured?
- I saw them get stunned.</i>

470
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,926
Funny how you managed to get away.

471
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:24,982
I was lucky. If I had been captured,
they would have killed me instantly.

472
00:30:25,102 --> 00:30:26,482
So how do we rescue them?

473
00:30:26,602 --> 00:30:29,044
By now, they will have been
brought before the queen.

474
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:31,594
So there's still a chance,
If you fly us back down there.

475
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:33,337
You don't understand.

476
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:36,296
The hive in orbit will have detected
my dart leaving the planet.

477
00:30:36,456 --> 00:30:39,130
They will grow suspicious
and begin searching for us.

478
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:42,546
Our only hope is to leave now
and come again later undetected.

479
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,311
We're not going anywhere.

480
00:30:44,585 --> 00:30:47,340
There is no way
to help your friends right now.

481
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:48,808
You must face this.

482
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:50,224
Wait.

483
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,667
There is a chance.

484
00:30:52,338 --> 00:30:53,620
I have an idea.

485
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:56,900
How were you able to find this place?

486
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:02,035
I don't believe that

487
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:04,299
I have ever encountered such resistance

488
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:06,075
from a human before.

489
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,078
I've had a lot practice.

490
00:31:09,238 --> 00:31:10,288
<i>Well...</i>

491
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:11,998
<i>There is a simpler way.</i>

492
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,410
Tell me what I want to know,

493
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,775
or I feed on one of your friends.

494
00:31:20,844 --> 00:31:22,342
As you wish.

495
00:31:22,502 --> 00:31:24,469
If you're hungry,
I'm the one you're looking for.

496
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:25,844
This one!

497
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:27,120
Oh, great.

498
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,724
My entire life,
I've never been chosen first...

499
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:34,771
And now fate decides
to restore the balance?

500
00:31:49,855 --> 00:31:51,788
What is it? My queen?

501
00:31:54,388 --> 00:31:56,297
Take them back to their cell.

502
00:31:58,109 --> 00:31:59,963
- I do not understand.
- Get out!

503
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:12,739
What did she say?

504
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:14,478
She's not talking to us.

505
00:32:14,735 --> 00:32:17,017
She's taking control
of the queen's mind.

506
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:18,886
Impossible.

507
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,183
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

508
00:32:34,306 --> 00:32:36,209
Who is this who dares

509
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,260
to enter my mind?

510
00:32:39,802 --> 00:32:40,670
Who I am

511
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,052
does not matter.

512
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:43,673
What matters

513
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:46,843
<i>is that I am stronger than you.</i>

514
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,586
Really?

515
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:53,182
Even now I am gaining
control of your body.

516
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,227
Yes,

517
00:32:58,582 --> 00:33:00,845
you do have strength.

518
00:33:01,485 --> 00:33:03,943
I can feel it now.

519
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:06,493
But even you cannot sustain

520
00:33:06,613 --> 00:33:08,434
this level of concentration

521
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:09,844
forever.

522
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:13,113
I do not need forever.

523
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:14,471
Now...

524
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:16,039
get up!

525
00:33:26,783 --> 00:33:28,509
Turn right.

526
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:39,020
You are hiding something from me.

527
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,906
I can sense it.

528
00:33:51,991 --> 00:33:54,065
Of course.

529
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:56,746
Now I feel it.

530
00:33:58,946 --> 00:34:00,883
You're not working alone.

531
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:03,053
There is another life...

532
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:04,649
inside you.

533
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:06,339
Helping you.

534
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,020
Stay away!

535
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,077
You cannot resist me for long!

536
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:21,904
Combined, your two minds

537
00:34:22,024 --> 00:34:24,591
are very powerful,

538
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:26,747
but all I need to do is distract you

539
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:28,926
for a single moment

540
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:31,762
to get to the other...

541
00:34:33,397 --> 00:34:34,842
One thought...

542
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:36,901
is all it will take

543
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:40,214
to crush it out of existence.

544
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:46,465
That was just weird.

545
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:49,382
Weird? Did you see how close
I just came to becoming Wraith food?

546
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:51,020
I don't think weird quite cuts it.

547
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,511
Like, maybe paralyzing,
or sickening, or heart-stopping.

548
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:55,972
- What do you think happened to her?
- I'm not sure.

549
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:03,640
Oh, great. She's back.

550
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:09,652
Here are your weapons.

551
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:14,782
It's me, John.

552
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:16,576
Teyla?

553
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:18,703
Yes.

554
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:23,958
You are weakening. I can feel it.

555
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:26,706
Teyla?

556
00:35:28,464 --> 00:35:29,422
Teyla, you okay?

557
00:35:32,502 --> 00:35:33,885
You must go, quickly!

558
00:35:35,212 --> 00:35:37,680
I do not know how much longer
I can control her.

559
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,814
Go. Move.

560
00:35:38,934 --> 00:35:40,725
Can you get her to tell us which way?

561
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:41,879
Just go!

562
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:45,688
You can let go of her now.
We're leaving.

563
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:48,816
There it is!

564
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,486
The other life inside you.

565
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:54,692
Teyla? Let go.

566
00:35:54,812 --> 00:35:55,944
John,

567
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:57,408
help me!

568
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:04,248
Teyla!

569
00:36:06,243 --> 00:36:08,704
Let's pull out those ZPMs
and get the hell out of here.

570
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:10,665
We have no idea where they are,
remember?

571
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:12,645
We pulled up the schematics
in the pod room.

572
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:14,438
It didn't have any reference to ZPMs.

573
00:36:14,558 --> 00:36:17,512
You didn't look hard enough.
Let's go.

574
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:34,612
Make this quick.

575
00:36:34,772 --> 00:36:37,448
There's a lot of data.
I'm gonna need a minute.

576
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:45,284
What was that?

577
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:49,316
It's too late.

578
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:57,608
They started to clone the warriors.

579
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,297
Forget that. Just find the ZPMs.

580
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,110
- I'm going to need more time!
- Rodney.

581
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,620
There are hundreds of pages
of information and it's all in Wraith.

582
00:37:05,378 --> 00:37:06,519
They found the queen.

583
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,629
All right. I got a better idea.

584
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:10,784
- You do?
- Let's get out of here.

585
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:17,135
Teyla, are you okay?

586
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:20,203
- Major Lorne.
- What happened?

587
00:37:20,558 --> 00:37:21,718
I saw them...

588
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:24,871
Colonel Sheppard, Ronon, Dr. McKay.

589
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:28,182
- Did they get away?
- The queen was...

590
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,042
was going after my child.

591
00:37:30,419 --> 00:37:31,414
It's okay.

592
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:33,528
It's okay. Just take it easy, all right?

593
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:35,723
Major.

594
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:38,759
The other hive is on its way.

595
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,303
They've found us.

596
00:37:49,862 --> 00:37:51,631
Isn't there another way out of here?

597
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:54,267
You want a different exit?
It was hard enough to find this one!

598
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:58,199
We better make a decision fast.
We've got more of 'em coming.

599
00:37:58,578 --> 00:37:59,572
Oh, crap.

600
00:38:13,496 --> 00:38:14,859
Let's get out of here!

601
00:38:28,822 --> 00:38:31,250
The hive ship will be here momentarily.
We need to leave now.

602
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,623
Not before our people get back.

603
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,363
Weapons capabilities
are limited at best.

604
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:39,178
The hull is still severely damaged.

605
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:40,992
We can't survive an attack.

606
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:42,921
Colonel Sheppard will be here shortly.

607
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,219
You don't know that.

608
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:45,828
I have seen them! They are alive,

609
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,536
and we will wait
for as long as is necessary.

610
00:38:50,751 --> 00:38:52,957
- What's that?
- The other hive.

611
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:55,211
They've entered weapons range.

612
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:04,006
This is foolish.
They will target our hyperdrive,

613
00:39:04,126 --> 00:39:05,596
making it impossible to escape.

614
00:39:05,756 --> 00:39:07,251
We can't wait any longer!

615
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:11,936
Teyla, Lorne, come in.

616
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:13,771
- <i>Colonel, where are you?</i>
- On our way.

617
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:16,090
You must hurry.
The other hive has found us.

618
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,386
<i>Can you hold them off?</i>

619
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:18,910
Not for long.

620
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,788
Approaching dart bay.

621
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:32,248
Acknowledged.

622
00:39:32,815 --> 00:39:33,916
They're inside.

623
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:36,793
Colonel, request permission
to jump to hyperspace immediately.

624
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:38,546
<i>Negative. I have another idea.</i>

625
00:39:38,706 --> 00:39:39,747
Are you crazy?

626
00:39:39,915 --> 00:39:42,550
We still have to destroy
the cloning facility.

627
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,780
How? In case you hadn't noticed,
we're under attack.

628
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,763
I know! Teyla, I want you
to set a new course.

629
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:57,806
- Commander.
- What is it?

630
00:39:57,926 --> 00:40:00,799
We just received
an urgent communication from the hive.

631
00:40:01,748 --> 00:40:02,938
The enemy,

632
00:40:03,058 --> 00:40:05,363
they're headed straight for us.

633
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:31,515
Well, I think that should
probably do the trick.

634
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:34,268
Let's get out of here.

635
00:40:46,815 --> 00:40:48,498
So, what happened to the other Wraith?

636
00:40:48,618 --> 00:40:49,932
You mean Todd?

637
00:40:50,052 --> 00:40:51,929
- Don't ask.
- He took a dart.

638
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:55,331
He escaped through the Gate like we did,
or was captured by the other hive ship.

639
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:58,434
I can't imagine they could have
given him a very warm welcome.

640
00:40:58,554 --> 00:40:59,554
No.

641
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,253
Talked to Keller?

642
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:18,869
I've just come from the infirmary.
Everything is fine.

643
00:41:19,617 --> 00:41:21,232
At least, physically.

644
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,651
What does that mean?

645
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:29,491
I exposed my unborn child

646
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:30,950
to the mind of a killer...

647
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:34,733
Even before he has opened
his eyes on the world.

648
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,622
He?

649
00:41:38,143 --> 00:41:39,206
It's a boy.

650
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,716
Really?

651
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:45,548
I thought you didn't want
Keller to tell you anything.

652
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:47,116
She didn't.

653
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,620
Okay...

654
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:54,473
You were right

655
00:41:54,633 --> 00:41:57,560
to question my involvement
in this mission.

656
00:41:58,494 --> 00:42:01,662
There was a time when
I would have laid down my life for you,

657
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:03,869
or Ronon, or Rodney,

658
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:05,944
without hesitation.

659
00:42:06,933 --> 00:42:07,933
But...

660
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:11,597
I have other considerations now.

661
00:42:11,856 --> 00:42:13,489
That's understandable.

662
00:42:15,987 --> 00:42:18,387
You have no idea how close she came

663
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:21,208
to extinguishing his life.

664
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:26,213
If you had hesitated

665
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:28,570
for even

666
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:30,937
a moment...
