1
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:06,058
Maybe if we...

2
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:08,284
No.

3
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:09,971
No.

4
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:16,173
<i>Why don't we bring
the Wraith in on this?</i>

5
00:00:16,293 --> 00:00:17,095
No.

6
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:21,670
<i>A lot of this new nanite coding is based
on his calculations, so maybe...</i>

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,832
(A) he wouldn't help us,
(B) we don't need his help and (C)...

8
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,747
someone get me some coffee.

9
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:30,574
<i>You've been silently
staring at that board</i>

10
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:32,267
for three hours.

11
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:35,537
- Yeah. It'll come to me.
- Just e-mail her, already.

12
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:40,465
Excuse me?

13
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:42,044
<i>Rodney, we're stuck.</i>

14
00:00:42,284 --> 00:00:44,281
We've been stuck for ten hours.

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,691
Just ask her for help, please.

16
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:49,384
- I'm not stuck.
- Last time we had a block like this,

17
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:51,294
- she helped us.
- Completely different.

18
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:53,662
I cannot sit here waiting
for you to have an epiphany!

19
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:55,557
I'm losing the will to live!

20
00:00:58,546 --> 00:01:01,099
I suppose there could be more
important things I should be working on.

21
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,315
However you want
to sell it to yourself, that's fine.

22
00:01:15,252 --> 00:01:16,558
<i>- Done!
- Done!</i>

23
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:18,624
- Just one big cookie?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,267
Don't you wanna use your cutters?

25
00:01:20,387 --> 00:01:22,010
Nah. I just want a big one.

26
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:28,633
You may wanna flatten
the dough a little bit.

27
00:01:30,494 --> 00:01:31,266
<i>No.</i>

28
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:34,001
<i>No? Just a giant cookie mountain?
That's what you're going for?</i>

29
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:34,922
<i>Okay!</i>

30
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,481
- <i>Anything good?</i>
- It's from my brother.

31
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:42,146
He's stuck again!
Do you mind if I...

32
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,070
Yeah, I got this.

33
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:46,009
- Here, do you wanna help with mine?
- OK.

34
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:46,892
OK.

35
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:48,879
I want a lot of flour.

36
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:52,170
<i>- How about some more chocolate chips?
- But not the full bowl.</i>

37
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,968
<i>No, that would be too many.</i>

38
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:07,140
You can't sleep?

39
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:09,394
I thought I heard something.

40
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:10,519
Madison?

41
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:12,676
I don't know.

42
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:15,709
I'm going to check it out.

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,522
She probably just snuck
downstairs for more cookies.

44
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:20,309
That's actually not a bad idea.

45
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:22,637
Drop!

46
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:31,966
You're coming with us.

55
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,260
Gentlemen.

56
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:46,876
I'm agent Barrett. I work for the NID.
Mr. Woolsey has asked me

57
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:50,142
to help you in any way I can. Sorry we
didn't meet under better circumstances.

58
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:51,982
Have the kidnappers tried to contact us?

59
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:54,111
- No, I'm afraid not.
- I need to get to Vancouver.

60
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:56,585
Okay, the Daedalus is in orbit,
so it will be a quick trip.

61
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:58,596
Have you learned any
new information yet?

62
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:01,702
No, not yet. The NID is liaising
with CSIS on the ground.

63
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:03,662
- They are expecting us.
- "C" what, now?

64
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:05,566
Canadian Security Intelligence Services.

65
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:07,269
They're kind of like our CIA.

66
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:08,498
"CSIS"?

67
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:10,869
That the best you guys can do, huh?

68
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:13,314
We will be out in the open, so...

69
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:16,129
Perhaps a change of clothes first?

70
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:18,435
What?

71
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:32,433
I look dumb.

72
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,016
It helps you blend in a little.

73
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:37,379
I'm going to stand out
no matter what you dress me in.

74
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:38,907
That's a good point.

75
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,094
Hey, look. It's your uncle Mer.

76
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:54,454
Hey, lady.

77
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:56,378
You going to say hi?

78
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,852
Where's mom?

79
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,269
Uh, she's...

80
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,289
I told you. She's had
to go away for a bit,

81
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:04,506
but she's going to come back soon, okay?

82
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:06,270
Can I...

83
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:07,284
Yeah.

84
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:09,014
Okay, sweetie.

85
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:16,227
- Who did this?
- We're not sure, but we have

86
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:18,693
the best people working
on this, and all the resources of...

87
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:22,589
When you came back last year, she almost
didn't go back with you to Atlantis.

88
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:25,177
I said, "Go, you have to do it.

89
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,205
- You'll regret not going."
- I know you did.

90
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:29,623
She knew it'd be dangerous,
but you two are so competive...

91
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:32,167
- Listen to me. We're going to...
- This is your fault,

92
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:34,657
- Hey, just a second.
- She got kidnapped because of you.

93
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:36,964
- We do not know that for sure.
- <i>We don't?</i>

94
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:40,408
Really? You figure four masked men
with guns broke in here

95
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:42,573
to steal her secret
apple dumpling recipe?

96
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:44,500
- <i>Jealous neighbor, maybe?</i>
- You're angry.

97
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,122
- You have every right to be...
- If something happens to her...

98
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:48,620
<i>Kaleb.</i>

99
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:51,478
We're going to find her.

100
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:54,602
Just...

101
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,316
Bring her back. Bring her home.

102
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:00,332
I will.

103
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:04,728
Come on, Mad.

104
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,976
- Where are we going?
- Just away for a bit.

105
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,968
I told him to get a hotel.

106
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:16,205
There's no reason for them
to stick around here.

107
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:18,718
All right, thanks, guys.
Give us the room, please.

108
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:28,750
- <i>So, where do you want to start?</i>
- Jeanie and I were

109
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,253
corresponding by email.
She was...

110
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,770
- I was bouncing some ideas off her.
- What about?

111
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,866
Well, before Sheppard's
Wraith showed up,

112
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:40,273
I was trying to perfect
my nanite medical program.

113
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:41,945
The thing you used to save Weir?

114
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:45,157
Yeah, a better, more complex
version of that, but yeah.

115
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:48,918
<i>Of course, as soon as we found out the
Replicators were attacking human worlds </i>

116
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,784
in the galaxy, we switched our focus
to shutting them down once and for all.

117
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:55,588
And you sent Jeanie the program
that you were working on?

118
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,143
I need a new set of eyes.

119
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,360
The question is, what does it
have to do with her being taken?

120
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:03,592
Yeah. Maybe the Trust
or some other Earth-based organization

121
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:06,522
<i>wanted info on me, or about
the Program, but regardless,</i>

122
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:09,523
my email and her capture happened
too close together not to be connected.

123
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:11,718
Right. That sounds like
a great place to start.

124
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:14,887
- Has anyone touched her computer?
- No, I told them you wanted to have a

125
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:18,351
- look at it first. Nobody's touched it.
- I'm going to need to take it apart.

126
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,834
It'll take some time.
Go back to the hotel.

127
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:23,392
- I'll call you if I find anything.
- It's okay, we'll stay.

128
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:24,335
Seriously.

129
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:27,240
This could take 10 to 12 hours.
There's nothing you can do here.

130
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:29,803
<i>Just go back to the hotel.
I'll call you if I find anything.</i>

131
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:56,271
<i>Here.</i>

132
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,277
No... Wait, please.

133
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:07,178
It's all right.

134
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:10,222
Let me?

135
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:20,267
Who are you?

136
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:24,384
My name is Henry Wallace.

137
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:26,470
I'm sorry to...

138
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:30,095
I need you to do some work for me.

139
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,392
Hello?

140
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:48,393
So, someone was monitoring my sister's
computer. I think I've cracked

141
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:51,366
their trojan, and I've got an address.
Barrett and I are on our way there now.

142
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:53,193
You said it was going to take 10 hours?

143
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:55,832
Hey, even I underestimate
how smart I am sometimes.

144
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,257
<i>All right, stay at the house,
and then we'll all go together.</i>

145
00:08:58,377 --> 00:08:59,857
It's too late, we're almost there.

146
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,828
<i>I'll give you an address.
You can meet us.</i>

147
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:04,254
Okay, what is it?

148
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:10,048
This looks like the place.

149
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:12,261
Shouldn't we wait
for Sheppard and Ronon?

150
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:15,093
Okay...

151
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:16,617
Stand back.

152
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,385
Okay, well, that works, too.

153
00:09:26,185 --> 00:09:27,945
You don't have
another one of those on you?

154
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:29,887
Yeah, I've got a shotgun in the car.

155
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:48,708
You okay?
What the hell happened?

156
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:50,649
Two men,
they must've been following us.

157
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:51,769
McKay!

158
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,553
He's not here.
They took him.

159
00:10:04,226 --> 00:10:05,338
Meredith?

160
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:09,825
- Jeanie. Thank God you're alive!
- What are you doing here?

161
00:10:09,945 --> 00:10:11,869
I came back
when I heard you'd been kidnapped.

162
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:14,967
- Have you seen Madison and Kaleb?
- Yes, they're a little shaken but okay.

163
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,202
I've put a security detail,
so you don't have to worry.

164
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:18,482
Then how did you...

165
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:20,870
I got ambushed trying to track
down the guys who took you.

166
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,638
Oh, great.
That's just great.

167
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:24,496
First you get me captured
and then you...

168
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:26,441
I got you captured?
How do you figure that?

169
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:28,873
Come on! They were monitoring
my computer, right?

170
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:30,482
- Yeah, so?
- So, would I be here

171
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:33,863
- if you hadn't sent me those emails?
- Possibly. What is this? A lab?

172
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,990
That's some great detective work there,
Nancy Drew.

173
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,989
- Where the hell are we?
- I have no idea.

174
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:41,748
They put me on a plane...

175
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:44,563
Yeah, me too.
Any idea who's behind any of this?

176
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:49,987
Dr. McKay.

177
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,024
I've heard a lot about you.

178
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:55,352
It's a pleasure.

179
00:10:56,862 --> 00:11:00,217
I thought you might show up
if your sister went missing.

180
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:03,948
We couldn't count on it, of course,
but it's a pretty big bonus.

181
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,581
Bonus?

182
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,925
I've no idea who you are but you've made
a terrible mistake bringing me here.

183
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:11,844
I suggest you let us both go right now,

184
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,098
otherwise, about 100 marines
are gonna come kicking down

185
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:17,742
- your front door in the next 2 minutes.
- I'm pretty sure they won't, actually.

186
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:21,141
Your subcutaneous transmitter
has been deactivated.

187
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:25,539
Who are you?

188
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:28,580
I should have started with that.

189
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:31,867
My name is Henry Wallace.

190
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,393
- I'm the president of...
- DMT. Great.

191
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:37,539
You know who I am, then.

192
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:39,461
I'm familiar with your work.

193
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,868
What's DMT?

194
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:42,414
Devlin Medical Technologies.

195
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:44,743
<i>They're a predominantly
government-funded contractor,</i>

196
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,007
and, unfortunately for us,
they manufacture

197
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:48,927
our subcutaneous transmitters.

198
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,345
- Great.
- Yeah.

199
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:52,464
<i>How do you even know I exist?</i>

200
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:56,134
Your company's only privy to very basic
information about newly declassified

201
00:11:56,254 --> 00:11:57,902
experiments the military is working on.

202
00:11:58,022 --> 00:12:01,071
No, more accurately, my company
is given limited access

203
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:04,100
to alien advances discovered
through the Stargate Program,

204
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:08,778
<i>and is asked to integrate them
into Earth-based medical technologies.</i>

205
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:12,403
- You're not cleared to know that.
- No,

206
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,876
I'm not.

207
00:12:14,552 --> 00:12:16,250
But after years of being

208
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:21,047
stupefied by the military's endless
and unbelievable advances,

209
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:23,660
I started to do a little digging.

210
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:26,666
That's how I found out about the SGC,

211
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:28,370
<i>Atlantis,</i>

212
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:29,876
<i>you...</i>

213
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,654
And that's why we've been
monitoring your family's emails for

214
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:36,365
quite some time now.

215
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,221
What do you want from me?

216
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:48,766
I've hit a wall

217
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:50,796
and need some help.

218
00:12:57,922 --> 00:12:59,628
My daughter, Sharon.

219
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:01,286
What's wrong with her?

220
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,052
She's suffering from acute
lymphocytic leukemia.

221
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:06,304
I'm very sorry, but...

222
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:09,868
She's been particularly unresponsive
to induction chemotherapy...

223
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:13,756
Prednisone, Vincristine,
cranial irradiation...

224
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,164
I don't know what all that means.
How am I supposed to help?

225
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:19,687
The best doctors in the world have told
her to start saying her goodbyes,

226
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:22,241
<i>begin making funeral plans...</i>

227
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:26,361
That's what I'm saying. Neither of us
are doctors. I have a PHD, 2 actually...

228
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:29,474
The latest project my company
has been working on for the SGC

229
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:32,138
involves applying advances
in nanotechnology

230
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:33,926
<i>to cure injury and disease.</i>

231
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:36,443
<i>- We were close to a prototype.</i>
- Wait a second.

232
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:40,050
Sharon was injected with the first batch
of nanites one week ago.

233
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,886
You barely got manufacturing perfected.
I'm working on the coding.

234
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:44,576
It's months away!
They're not ready!

235
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:47,057
My team thought they had
ironed out most of the coding.

236
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:48,864
"Ironed out"?
It's not that easy.

237
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,556
I know that, now.

238
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,111
- They're malfunctioning.
- Well, of course they are.

239
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:55,551
And it's not just
that they're not working, they're...

240
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:59,199
They're actually causing
more problems than the cancer.

241
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,028
Her body is rejecting them.

242
00:14:02,985 --> 00:14:05,213
When I intercepted your correspondence
with Jeanie,

243
00:14:05,383 --> 00:14:08,808
I desperately needed someone familiar
with the coding to come fix the program.

244
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,977
- Right, so Jeanie was just the bait.
- No.

245
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:14,241
No. From what I could tell, she had a
firmer grasp of the coding than you did.

246
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:17,660
I don't think it's fair to judge me on a
couple of emails. They don't reflect...

247
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:20,512
- It doesn't matter.
- If we don't do something quickly,

248
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:22,759
Sharon's going to die.

249
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:27,994
Get the nanites fully operational,
and I'll let you go.

250
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:29,812
Really?

251
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:32,664
- Absolutely.
- And if we don't?

252
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:38,324
That's right, Sir. They must
have neutralized the transmitter.

253
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:40,951
What about the lead you were following?

254
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:43,631
Dead end. It's a small,
rented room with a router

255
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:45,595
that ported data to a site in Singapore.

256
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:48,054
I mean, who knows where
it was forwarded from there.

257
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:50,365
We've got our best IT guys
on the job, though.

258
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:53,677
We'll start tracing the paper trail,
and hopefully it's gonna turn up a lead.

259
00:14:53,797 --> 00:14:56,344
We've combed the security,
traffic, and ABM cameras from the area.

260
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:58,337
We've got ambush talking to witnesses...

261
00:14:58,457 --> 00:15:00,528
We've got half
the Vancouver PD on this one.

262
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,684
We're going to get 'em.

263
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:11,174
<i>- They're not communicating.</i>
- What?

264
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:14,355
The nanites're causing all the problems,
going after some cells redundantly,

265
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:17,669
they're ignoring others, they've caused
at least 3 partially clogged arteries...

266
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,943
<i>Something in their coding is stopping
them from understanding each other.</i>

267
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:21,846
Great.

268
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:25,051
- Are you even listening to me?
- You lost me at "nanites."

269
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:27,177
Hey, idiot, we need to solve
this coding problem.

270
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:29,403
No, what we need to do
is get the hell out of here.

271
00:15:29,523 --> 00:15:31,643
I know, by solving the coding problem.

272
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:34,012
- So young, and so naive.
- You got a better idea?

273
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:36,735
Yes. Look. They gave
these computers network access

274
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:38,931
so we could monitor Sharon
in real time, right?

275
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:41,359
Which means I can also hack
into the security mainframe.

276
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:43,549
What about Sharon?

277
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:46,616
- What about us?
- We can do this. We can help this girl.

278
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,858
And then what?
He's just going to let us go?

279
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:51,199
He's just going to give up his life,

280
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:54,115
lose his company, get carted off
to prison? He'll be fine with that?

281
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,773
He's desperate.
I think any parent would understand...

282
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:58,613
You think?
Let's just for a second

283
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:01,798
imagine that we live in this magical
land of unicorns and wizards

284
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,814
and kindhearted people who you can
take at their word. Let's assume

285
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:06,830
that he lets us go if we save her.

286
00:16:07,181 --> 00:16:10,579
What if we fail, huh? What if she dies?
How happy do you think he'll be then?

287
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:13,058
He'll just let us waltz out
the door with an "aw, shucks,

288
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:15,300
<i>well, better luck next
time, tiger" attitude?</i>

289
00:16:15,983 --> 00:16:16,983
<i>Exactly.</i>

290
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,623
We need to get out of here. I've worked
on a code to unlock the keypad doors.

291
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:24,302
You ready?

292
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:26,472
What happens
after you get the door open?

293
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:29,660
Well, I memorized the building's layout
from this computer here.

294
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:31,284
Okay.

295
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:42,673
Come on.

296
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,141
Come.

297
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:03,533
You said there was
a stairway entrance here.

298
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:05,276
There's supposed to be.

299
00:17:05,396 --> 00:17:08,114
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
We got to go back.

300
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:10,940
- Go back? Why?
- Because I got all mixed around.

301
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,688
We start again. Maybe what I thought
was north was south. Hard to tell.

302
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:16,097
Can't believe I'm betting my life
on your sense of direction.

303
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:18,806
- I've an excellent sense of direction.
- Remember in West Edmonton Mall

304
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:20,560
dad had to call the police to find you?

305
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:22,795
- That mall is huge!
- There are maps every 7 metres!

306
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:25,070
Misleading ones.
Now, come on. We got to go back.

307
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,163
Oh, man.

308
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,736
Oh, shoot.

309
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:44,047
Run! Run!

310
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,687
Why would you do that?

311
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:17,062
Why would...

312
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,916
My daughter is dying.

313
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:23,532
You kidnapped us.
What did you expect?

314
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:25,927
I shouldn't have
given you network access.

315
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:28,097
Yeah, well, it's a rookie mistake.

316
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:31,587
You're never going to help me.

317
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:34,386
- Are you?
- You're gonna kill us either way.

318
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:36,739
- What exactly is our incentive?
- I gave you my word.

319
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:39,135
Which means exactly nothing to me.

320
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:45,669
Please.

321
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:49,569
My wife died three years ago.

322
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,140
I can't go through that again.

323
00:18:53,526 --> 00:18:55,021
<i>Sharon's all I have.</i>

324
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:57,168
You can save her.

325
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:59,135
Look, this is an experimental
medical program.

326
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:01,339
It may never work.
All this might've been for nothing.

327
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:04,344
Worst case scenario, I thought
I would have weeks with Sharon.

328
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:08,051
Now, if things stay as they are,
I'm lucky to have days.

329
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:10,211
You never should have injected her.

330
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:13,921
No.

331
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:15,364
<i>No.</i>

332
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:18,672
It will work.

333
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:21,892
It has to work.

334
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:23,725
What is that?

335
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:25,201
A dose of nanites.

336
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:27,460
- Meredith...
- Wait, wait. Please.

337
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,081
No. I'm sorry.

338
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:31,266
You need an incentive.

339
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:32,856
Don't!

340
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:42,171
Fix this.

341
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:44,409
Or they both die.

342
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,231
You okay?

343
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,702
Yeah, I'm fine.

344
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:09,156
You were right. They're not
communicating. They're not doing lots of

345
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,494
- things they should be doing, in fact.
- Yeah, I know.

346
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:14,090
<i>See, the thing is, even though DMT
manufactured their own nanites,</i>

347
00:20:14,662 --> 00:20:16,114
the coding, the programming...

348
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:18,467
Most of it's lifted directly
from the Replicators.

349
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:20,866
Yeah, well, the thing is,
as much as I hate to admit it,

350
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,985
we're just beginning
to understand that coding.

351
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:25,539
The Wraith we've been working with
has helped us...

352
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,409
Wait, you've been working with a Wraith?

353
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:28,790
Yeah, it's a long story.

354
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:30,627
What I'm trying to say is

355
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:34,800
this program that we're pushing on it
is designed to restrain them...

356
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,736
Very specifically, to make sure they
don't get out of control. So much so...

357
00:20:37,856 --> 00:20:40,578
- They're completely ineffective.
- Like we tied their hands.

358
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:44,118
- So we have to cut them loose.
- Exactly. The nanites can't replicate.

359
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:47,487
Technically by unleashing them, we might
make all our little problems go away.

360
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:48,426
Okay,

361
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:52,038
that shouldn't be too complex. Altering
2,000 maybe 3,000 lines of code.

362
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,272
- Yeah, it's a... cinch.
- Yeah.

363
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,029
- I'm really sorry about all this.
- Don't wanna talk about this right now.

364
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:03,227
We need to write this program
and upload it.

365
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,077
I'll yell at you later, okay?

366
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:22,735
We're going in circles here.

367
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,305
I don't even get what we're doing.

368
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:28,585
We're trying to match the corporations.

369
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,895
See the company that rented the space
for the internet router

370
00:21:32,015 --> 00:21:34,784
was owned by another company which was
owned by another and owned by another.

371
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:37,165
Trying to connect the company
that was monitoring Jeanie's

372
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:39,251
<i>computer to a company
that would want to take her.</i>

373
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:42,081
Probably a company owned by the trust.
We just haven't found a connection.

374
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,103
<i>They knew enough
to shut down the transmitter.</i>

375
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:46,670
Exactly. You know, the fact that they
even knew that tells us that

376
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,514
they're pretty intimate with
the operations of the Stargate Program.

377
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,346
Again, the Trust.

378
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,686
We should widen the net.

379
00:21:53,806 --> 00:21:55,206
Maybe it wasn't one of them.

380
00:21:56,311 --> 00:21:57,838
Other known enemy groups?

381
00:21:58,307 --> 00:22:00,623
- Or an ally.
- Chinese? Russians?

382
00:22:00,743 --> 00:22:04,021
McKay said he was working on a program
which shut down the Replicators.

383
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:06,304
Was he working in tandem
with anyone here on Earth?

384
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:08,238
No. No, not that I know of.

385
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,988
Wait. There was a medical
company that was working on

386
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:13,763
other nanite programs but they didn't
have any direct dealings with him.

387
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:15,154
Which company was that?

388
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:18,287
I don't know.
Give me a sec. I'll find out.

389
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,413
- Where are you going?
- Get some food.

390
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:26,840
In case you forgot, McKay
and his sister are still missing.

391
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:31,142
What? You want my help
dissecting corporate structures?

392
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:33,400
When you find someone to point a gun at,

393
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,764
you let me know.

394
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:36,157
Fair enough.

395
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:42,506
What's it been? A couple of hours?

396
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:43,844
Something like that.

397
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:45,211
So, what? No updates?

398
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:47,600
I mean, I know we're hostages and all,
but, come on...

399
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:49,814
took me like 10 sec
to upload the program.

400
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:52,387
- What's taking so much time?
- It'll take a while to figure out

401
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:54,756
if our coding patch
makes the nanites fight the cancer.

402
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:57,248
When we activated them in Weir,
she was healed almost instantly.

403
00:22:57,368 --> 00:23:00,144
That time, the replicator cells
actually replaced her damaged cells.

404
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:01,552
Our guys have to heal them.

405
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,581
But still, by now they should have seen
a massive changes in her condition.

406
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:07,957
- Why aren't they telling us anything?
- Sit down. You're driving me crazy.

407
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,056
- Are you gonna marry that Katie girl?
- What?

408
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:23,314
- You heard me.
- Where did that come from?

409
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:26,212
I'm trying to take my mind off the fact
I have tiny robots running through

410
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:29,235
my veins 'cause you need help with your
homework. You'd rather talk about that?

411
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:30,182
Not really.

412
00:23:30,302 --> 00:23:32,147
<i>- Are you going to marry her?</i>
- I don't know.

413
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:33,905
<i>You've been dating for over a year now.</i>

414
00:23:34,027 --> 00:23:35,363
I'm aware of that, thank you.

415
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:38,192
- You think you'll find someone better?
- No, it's not that.

416
00:23:38,312 --> 00:23:39,788
'Cause you're not.

417
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:40,880
Hang on.

418
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:44,084
The fact that you've found a nice girl
who's willing to put up with all your

419
00:23:44,204 --> 00:23:45,748
many little flaws is a miracle.

420
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:47,589
- Look.
<i>- Plus, physically, you're...</i>

421
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:49,601
Well, how do I put this?

422
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,211
You're no John Sheppard.

423
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,633
Okay.

424
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,063
Let's go back to talking about how it's
my fault, I think I liked that better.

425
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:58,468
Come with me.

426
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:05,175
Oh, come in, come in.

427
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:09,385
Sharon, I want to introduce you
to Rodney McKay, Jeanie Miller.

428
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,657
They're the ones that saved you.

429
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,464
It's very nice to meet you.

430
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:16,115
Thank you so much.

431
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,430
How are you feeling?

432
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:19,357
Better than I've felt in years.

433
00:24:19,477 --> 00:24:20,500
<i>And the cancer?</i>

434
00:24:21,056 --> 00:24:22,761
We can't find any trace of it.

435
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:32,396
<i>And I'm nervous, right? Because, you
know, it's an admiral I'm talking to,</i>

436
00:24:32,516 --> 00:24:33,801
<i>so I say to him,</i>

437
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:38,966
<i>"Sir,
if you use an I37 form instead of an N1,</i>

438
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:43,282
you can save yourself from using,
like, like, like, a hundred G72s,"

439
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:46,097
and there's this pause.

440
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:49,167
No one says anything for, like,

441
00:24:49,497 --> 00:24:51,437
I don't know, felt like minutes,

442
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:55,346
and, finally, the admiral
looks over at Landry and he goes, "Hank.

443
00:24:56,054 --> 00:24:58,020
not only is your boy here right,

444
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:02,753
but I think we found ourselves
a new bingo caller for sunday nights."

445
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:04,763
Bingo!

446
00:25:05,115 --> 00:25:05,957
God!

447
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:07,647
<i>"I37!"</i>

448
00:25:07,825 --> 00:25:08,713
<i>"N1!"</i>

449
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,592
"G72!" Bingo!

450
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:16,072
Who ever said the admiral
didn't have a sense of humor?

451
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:20,451
Then there was this other time
that general O'Neill and I,

452
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:23,040
- we were...
- Tell me you have something.

453
00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:25,969
- Devlin Medical Technologies.
- That means?

454
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:28,713
- We got somebody to point your gun at.
- Sweet.

455
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,721
- What are you going to do with us?
- Hey!

456
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:42,842
We're celebrating here.

457
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:45,511
She's still got nanites inside her,
and we're both still hostages,

458
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:48,132
so you'll excuse me
if I skip the champagne.

459
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:50,089
I'm a man of my word.

460
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:53,872
- I'm going to let you go.
- What, just like that?

461
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,406
Just like that.

462
00:25:55,526 --> 00:25:58,048
- But you'll be arrested.
- Not helping.

463
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,343
I know.

464
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,783
I've known I was going to prison from
the moment I decided to kidnap you.

465
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:06,811
I don't care.

466
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,471
My daughter's going to live.

467
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,781
That's all that matters.

468
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:15,784
- I can't expect you to understand.
- You're right, I don't.

469
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:19,243
We've done a great thing here today.

470
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:21,553
And not just for my daughter.

471
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,819
<i>Hell, we might have just
cured cancer altogether.</i>

472
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:26,307
<i>So, please,</i>

473
00:26:26,967 --> 00:26:27,944
a toast.

474
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,359
To the future.

475
00:26:34,608 --> 00:26:36,270
Sir, we have a problem.

476
00:26:41,336 --> 00:26:42,346
Clear!

477
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,764
Nothing. Going again.

478
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:48,764
<i>Charging.</i>

479
00:26:50,295 --> 00:26:51,215
Clear!

480
00:26:58,856 --> 00:26:59,901
Turn it off.

481
00:27:06,982 --> 00:27:08,081
I'm so sorry.

482
00:27:10,606 --> 00:27:11,677
She was fine.

483
00:27:13,295 --> 00:27:15,225
- I don't understand.
- Her heart just stopped.

484
00:27:15,345 --> 00:27:17,083
We couldn't get it pumping again.

485
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:19,036
I'm not sure what happened.

486
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,264
- We need to get out of here.
- I know.

487
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,932
I need to get you back to the SGC.

488
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,418
Your nanites are running
on the same programming.

489
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:40,023
Okay. I'm going to see if I can distract
the guard, I need you to go. Jeanie?

490
00:27:40,143 --> 00:27:41,894
What are you doing?

491
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:45,775
I'm so sorry.

492
00:27:48,044 --> 00:27:49,829
My brother and I need to leave.

493
00:27:50,152 --> 00:27:53,173
We need to get to a bigger
lab with more scientists.

494
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:55,095
Please.

495
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,471
I don't know what to do.

496
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:01,725
I can't imagine

497
00:28:01,903 --> 00:28:03,601
what you're going through right now.

498
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:06,276
I know you're angry.
I would be, too, but...

499
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,819
If I go untreated...

500
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,068
Look, I have a family,
a husband, a daughter.

501
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,339
Please.

502
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,698
I need to get help,
and I can't do it here.

503
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:21,187
I'm sorry.

504
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:36,044
- You said she was dead.
- She was.

505
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:52,316
The nanites are still active.

506
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:55,073
Once they've beaten the cancer, they're
supposed to shut themselves down.

507
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:58,347
Never been tested in a live subject,
only worked sporadically in simulations.

508
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:01,419
Look, I told you, this programming
is nowhere near ready to implement.

509
00:29:01,556 --> 00:29:02,925
Wait, you're saying

510
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:04,659
the nanites brought her back to life?

511
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:06,288
It's the only viable explanation.

512
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,833
Then why did she die in the first place?
Shouldn't they have kept her alive?

513
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:11,335
- It's a good point.
- Wait.

514
00:29:11,472 --> 00:29:14,213
The doctor said her heart just stopped?
Seemingly out of nowhere?

515
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,372
Right.

516
00:29:15,563 --> 00:29:17,876
Does Sharon have any heart problems?
Unrelated to the cancer?

517
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:20,773
Yes, she has a mitral
regurgitation problem.

518
00:29:21,188 --> 00:29:22,391
<i>Heart murmur.</i>

519
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,180
- What, you don't think...
- We broadened the parameters.

520
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:27,480
They weren't just programmed
to cure the cancer.

521
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:29,812
Once they were done with leukemia,
they moved on to heart,

522
00:29:29,974 --> 00:29:32,346
<i>- easiest way to fix that...</i>
- Shut it down while they repaired.

523
00:29:32,469 --> 00:29:34,569
<i>That doesn't make any sense.
Shutting down the heart</i>

524
00:29:34,692 --> 00:29:37,260
and starving the brain of oxygen
would cause severe brain damage.

525
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:40,521
- Damage they could technically fix.
- They could repair the tissue, yes, but

526
00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:43,121
<i>the patient would lose their memories,
their language skills,</i>

527
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,695
- any sense of self.
- They don't care about that.

528
00:29:45,815 --> 00:29:48,982
Look, they were designed to fix the body
of all physical maladies. I mean,

529
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:51,276
preserving a sense of self
isn't one of their directives.

530
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:52,401
<i>So...</i>

531
00:29:53,247 --> 00:29:55,629
She's going to be stuck
in this vegetative state?

532
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,694
Technically, her brain
is perfectly healthy.

533
00:29:58,814 --> 00:30:00,472
It's like she's been

534
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,344
reset to zero, so to speak.

535
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:06,761
Meredith. What about me?
I don't have any cancer.

536
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:08,958
They'll look around
and go straight for...

537
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:10,428
Your epilepsy.

538
00:30:10,735 --> 00:30:12,354
I don't wanna be shut down for repairs.

539
00:30:12,516 --> 00:30:14,398
Okay, okay, the first thing
we got to do is...

540
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:21,393
- You guys okay?
- <i>How...</i>

541
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:23,907
We need to get Jeanie to the SGC!
Is the Daedalus still in orbit?

542
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:25,692
You're welcome. It was a daring rescue.

543
00:30:25,815 --> 00:30:28,829
Thanks, but we're not out of the woods.
We have to get to the SGC now!

544
00:30:30,373 --> 00:30:31,835
Daedalus, this is Sheppard.

545
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,188
We need a lift.

546
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:46,317
Okay, I've put Jeanie in a medically
induced coma, and I've broken her legs.

547
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,807
You what?

548
00:30:48,217 --> 00:30:49,666
We need to slow down the nanites.

549
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:51,904
This could buy us 10 hours, at least.

550
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,822
You broke her legs?

551
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:55,405
Couldn't you give her a disease?

552
00:30:55,525 --> 00:30:57,316
She need an immediate and severe trauma.

553
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:59,759
Besides, if we shut them down
before she's properly healed,

554
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:01,361
all she has is a few broken bones.

555
00:31:01,523 --> 00:31:03,412
Instead of a disease
she'd have to fight alone.

556
00:31:03,532 --> 00:31:06,516
Exactly. I'm pretty sure we can't just
keep doing this. Sooner or later,

557
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:08,497
the nanites are gonna
abandon her broken bones

558
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,524
and move to her brain,
so we need to move fast.

559
00:31:10,644 --> 00:31:12,818
Can't we just blast her
with an electromagnetic pulse?

560
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:15,978
These nanites were designed specifically
to be immune to EM field fluctuations.

561
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:18,106
- Wonderful.
- So we have 10 hours to come up with

562
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:20,464
- a program that shuts down the nanites?
- Right.

563
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,379
So what's the plan?

564
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,154
Well, as embarrassing
as I find this to say...

565
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,095
I need some help.

566
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:32,838
This was a bad idea.

567
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,226
Yeah, well, it's the only one I've got.

568
00:31:49,768 --> 00:31:51,955
Why have you brought me here?

569
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:57,834
<i>Look, you understand the
replicator coding better than anyone.</i>

570
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,795
<i>If we're going to do this quickly, then</i>

571
00:32:00,047 --> 00:32:01,372
we need your help.

572
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:06,636
And why should you care?
We're gonna kill you either way.

573
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:08,245
That's what you're thinking?

574
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:12,051
Okay. So, incentives...

575
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:15,894
First off,
we have no interest in killing you.

576
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:18,312
You've probably already
figured that out by now, but

577
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,014
we can't let you go, either, because

578
00:32:20,134 --> 00:32:22,991
you know too much about Atlantis. Unless
you could prove you're trustworthy...

579
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,751
<i>And this would go a long way
towards proving that.</i>

580
00:32:27,474 --> 00:32:28,474
Right.

581
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:31,748
Yeah, pretty sure
I wouldn't buy that either.

582
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:37,082
Do you have any relatives?

583
00:32:40,728 --> 00:32:44,063
Do Wraith have brothers or sisters?
I don't know how it works...

584
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:47,926
But with us, with

585
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:49,128
my people,

586
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,163
those bonds mean a lot.

587
00:32:54,746 --> 00:32:56,380
My sister is in trouble, and

588
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:58,457
it's pretty much all my fault.

589
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,024
You could help us. You could save her.

590
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:09,161
That doesn't mean anything
to you, does it?

591
00:33:10,436 --> 00:33:13,464
I suppose it wouldn't mean much to me,
either, if I was in your place.

592
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,370
You and I both know

593
00:33:21,493 --> 00:33:23,968
that if we can figure out how
to shut down these earth-made nanites,

594
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:26,423
it would be a giant step toward
shutting down the Replicators.

595
00:33:27,448 --> 00:33:29,056
I know you lost your hive.

596
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:32,413
I have no idea how horrible
that must have been for you,

597
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:35,765
but knowing they're still out there,
that you alone could do something,

598
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:37,635
that's got to be driving you crazy.

599
00:33:39,699 --> 00:33:41,265
So don't do this for me,

600
00:33:41,525 --> 00:33:43,384
don't do this for my sister...

601
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:45,502
Do this for yourself.

602
00:33:46,227 --> 00:33:48,099
Do this because you know you can,

603
00:33:48,372 --> 00:33:50,484
and because you know
it'll help destroy the Replicators

604
00:33:50,604 --> 00:33:51,782
once and for all.

605
00:33:53,557 --> 00:33:54,760
<i>What do you say?</i>

606
00:34:02,072 --> 00:34:03,072
Thank you.

607
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:48,437
All right, there's a few bugs
to code out, but I think we're close.

608
00:34:48,574 --> 00:34:49,443
We?

609
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:53,564
Hey, I have been contributing. Now,
if I could suggest a few, targets...

610
00:34:54,753 --> 00:34:55,997
Are you okay?

611
00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:58,729
No.

612
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,063
<i>What if he's faking?</i>

613
00:35:05,388 --> 00:35:07,411
Maybe he's just milking
it for a hot meal.

614
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:08,567
No, I believe him.

615
00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:10,488
He can't finish the coding
without feeding.

616
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:13,312
I understand exactly
what he's doing, but

617
00:35:13,435 --> 00:35:15,452
he's far more versed
at implementing it than I am.

618
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,332
Maybe if I had a couple of weeks, but

619
00:35:17,455 --> 00:35:19,159
he's the only one
who can do it in a day.

620
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,683
I don't know what to say,
but the NID is not gonna provide us

621
00:35:21,806 --> 00:35:23,540
with a human for him to feed on.

622
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,023
I know.

623
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,526
It needs to be me.

624
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:30,072
What?

625
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:33,446
I want him to feed on me.

626
00:35:38,227 --> 00:35:39,306
You wanna what?

627
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:41,728
Let him feed off me,
get his strength back,

628
00:35:41,854 --> 00:35:44,095
then he can finish the coding
and save Jeanie.

629
00:35:44,215 --> 00:35:46,677
Then what? Force him
to give you your life back?

630
00:35:46,797 --> 00:35:48,855
- He's not gonna do that.
- Sharon died.

631
00:35:49,507 --> 00:35:50,860
Half an hour ago.

632
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:54,202
I don't understand. What happened?
I thought the nanites would...

633
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:56,329
This time it wasn't a problem
with the programming.

634
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:58,111
It was a manufacturing defect.

635
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:00,452
Look, in Layman's terms,

636
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:03,121
the nanites ran out of steam while
they were repairing her arteries.

637
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,427
She bled out internally.

638
00:36:05,547 --> 00:36:07,083
There was nothing we could do.

639
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:11,478
I can't lose my sister, John.

640
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:14,299
How am I gonna explain that
to her husband? To her kid?

641
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:16,384
That Wraith'll kill you.

642
00:36:17,335 --> 00:36:19,596
- That's my choice to make.
- No, it's not.

643
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,972
You're an invaluable member of my team,
and you report directly to me.

644
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,727
You wanna talk about chain of command?

645
00:36:25,941 --> 00:36:28,919
- You are not doing this.
- She's here because of me.

646
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:33,033
I can't fix the problem,
but I can help the guy who can.

647
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:35,927
Look, this was not
an easy decision to make.

648
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,323
- I can't.
- Please.

649
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:44,621
I'm sorry.

650
00:36:51,555 --> 00:36:54,803
We're going over the data.
We don't understand what happened.

651
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:57,292
I'm sorry.

652
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:01,746
And Jeanie?

653
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,648
She's not gonna make it.

654
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:08,177
We brought in a...

655
00:37:09,347 --> 00:37:12,312
specialist from the Pegasus galaxy.

656
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:15,430
Part of an enemy race called the Wraith.

657
00:37:16,013 --> 00:37:18,318
Somehow, McKay has convinced him to

658
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:22,318
create a program to shut down
the nanites in Jeanie's body.

659
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:24,414
And?

660
00:37:24,817 --> 00:37:26,938
He was close, real close, but

661
00:37:27,184 --> 00:37:29,794
he hasn't fed in a few weeks,
so he collapsed.

662
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:33,068
He's too weak
to finish the coding modifications.

663
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,154
I don't understand.

664
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:40,164
If it means saving her life,
why not just feed him?

665
00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:42,178
Well, he feeds on...

666
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:45,133
humans.

667
00:37:45,636 --> 00:37:47,098
Their life force.

668
00:37:48,629 --> 00:37:49,723
I see.

669
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,882
Little hard to find volunteers.

670
00:37:53,932 --> 00:37:56,318
- So Jeanie will...
- She's going to die.

671
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,112
Just like Sharon.

672
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:02,824
I'm so sorry.

673
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:06,479
I'm sure you are.

674
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,285
<i>This is Kaleb,</i>

675
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:21,280
<i>her husband...</i>

676
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:24,452
<i>And, Madison, her little daughter.</i>

677
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:34,648
I never meant for any of this to happen.

678
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:36,779
I know you didn't...

679
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:39,156
But it did.

680
00:38:41,234 --> 00:38:43,202
Now McKay's blaming himself.

681
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:45,033
I know better.

682
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:49,329
You know better.

683
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:03,627
Come on.

684
00:39:05,612 --> 00:39:07,995
- Can I help you, Sir?
- No. No problem.

685
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:09,781
May I see that, Sir?

686
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,913
- No, you may not.
- Sir. The card, please.

687
00:39:18,447 --> 00:39:21,021
- You're not Dr. Lee, Sir.
- Was that lee's card?

688
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,858
You know, we were just at the gym,
and must have swapped pants, so,

689
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:27,044
- would you just open the door for me?
- Not without a card, Sir.

690
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,697
I'm Dr. Rodney mcKay. This is my lab.
Would you please open the door?

691
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:32,087
- I can't do that, sir.
- This is a matter of life or death.

692
00:39:32,214 --> 00:39:33,844
Open the door! I'm under...

693
00:39:34,715 --> 00:39:36,386
- Sheppard?
- Let him in.

694
00:39:45,624 --> 00:39:48,159
- What...
- I was showing Wallace the labs.

695
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:50,010
<i>The Wraith got the upper hand.</i>

696
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,758
<i>That's what the report's going to say.</i>

697
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:52,700
You...

698
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,490
- Come on. You've got work to do.
- No, he does not.

699
00:39:57,238 --> 00:39:58,822
I have completed the reprogramming.

700
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:00,666
<i>That was quick.</i>

701
00:40:01,214 --> 00:40:02,580
Well, get it uploaded.

702
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:21,592
- Jeanie?
- Mer...

703
00:40:21,891 --> 00:40:23,548
It's okay. It's okay.

704
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,179
Man... Medical comas are weird.

705
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:28,933
Yeah, well,

706
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:31,264
you're not the first to mention it.

707
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:34,258
- Did you...
- Yes.

708
00:40:34,548 --> 00:40:35,699
So I... I'm...

709
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,337
<i>You are absolutely fine.</i>

710
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:40,651
I mean, aside from
a few inert nanites in you.

711
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,627
Thanks, Mer.

712
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:45,349
You know...

713
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:48,446
I'm really sorry about all this.

714
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:51,559
Oh, I am going to hold this
over your head for...

715
00:40:52,064 --> 00:40:52,993
Forever.

716
00:40:53,649 --> 00:40:55,740
- It's totally fair.
- Like, you're going to eat a lot

717
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,320
of vegetarian food
and not complain about it.

718
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
Sure. Sure.

719
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,934
And you're going to read Madison
3 stories instead of her usual 2...

720
00:41:03,054 --> 00:41:03,914
All right.

721
00:41:04,443 --> 00:41:06,169
You're going to buy me a car.

722
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:08,785
- Let's not get out of control here.
- You almost got me killed.

723
00:41:08,905 --> 00:41:10,518
That's at least a car. A nice one.

724
00:41:10,682 --> 00:41:13,059
- A hybrid.
- We'll talk about it on the way home.

725
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,007
Home... that sounds great.

726
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:21,199
I love you.

727
00:41:21,817 --> 00:41:22,654
Yeah.

728
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:27,691
I love you too.

729
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:42,498
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

730
00:41:42,618 --> 00:41:44,569
Look who's back.
How's the family?

731
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,714
It was great.

732
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:48,802
I bought them a Prius.

733
00:41:49,038 --> 00:41:50,112
- Guilt.
- Yeah.

734
00:41:50,728 --> 00:41:51,752
Listen...

735
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:55,194
- I can't believe what you did.
- I don't really want to talk about it.

736
00:41:55,314 --> 00:41:57,395
You talked Wallace
into sacrificing himself.

737
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,749
No, I didn't.

738
00:41:59,213 --> 00:42:01,155
- Well, then how did he...
- I...

739
00:42:04,312 --> 00:42:06,082
I presented a situation.

740
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:09,717
He volunteered.

741
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:14,508
Still, you talked a man
into killing himself.

742
00:42:14,628 --> 00:42:16,526
He wanted to make things right.

743
00:42:18,142 --> 00:42:19,380
I merely...

744
00:42:21,658 --> 00:42:23,062
Presented the situation?

745
00:42:25,697 --> 00:42:26,607
Yeah.

746
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:31,062
Thanks.

747
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:39,948
Want to get something to eat?

748
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:42,532
Sure.

749
00:42:46,944 --> 00:42:47,800
Say...

750
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:51,099
You and I are about even
when it comes to looks, right?

751
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:53,095
- Who's been lying to you?
- No, I'm serious.

752
00:42:53,215 --> 00:42:54,388
I am too.

753
00:42:54,508 --> 00:42:56,213
Who's been lying to you?
