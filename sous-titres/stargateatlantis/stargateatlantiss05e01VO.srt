Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:05,090
I believe I had a vision last night.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,344
I saw Kanaan, the father of my son.

4
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:09,137
- Save us.
- Where are you?

5
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:10,193
Dart!

6
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,183
I came for you, just like you asked.

7
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:15,069
Like I asked.

8
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,145
- Michael.
- I was the one in your visions.

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,732
- I was sent back in time?
- No, in fact, you were sent forward.

10
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:25,014
I've loaded all the intel we got
on Michael after your disappearance,

11
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:27,239
including the address
where we found Teyla.

12
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:28,674
Quickly.

13
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,243
- You must release me.
- Teyla.

14
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:38,309
- John.
- I know where Teyla is.

15
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,211
My child is of no concern to you.

16
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:43,213
I have great plans for him.

17
00:00:43,797 --> 00:00:46,299
I think we're too early, but
he'll bring her here to have the baby.

18
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:48,718
Colonel, it's a boobytrap.
We must get outta here, now!

19
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:05,201
This is perfect.

20
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:06,528
Just what I needed.

21
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:10,114
To the has been hectic several weeks.

22
00:01:10,673 --> 00:01:12,001
Try four years.

23
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:13,910
Very true.

24
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:17,998
You know what, it makes
these common moments even more special.

25
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,331
I cherish these times,
when it's just you and me.

26
00:01:23,554 --> 00:01:24,444
Me too.

27
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:31,219
You...
you've got an early morning.

28
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,093
I never got to properly thank you.

29
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:38,010
For what?

30
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:39,685
For what?

31
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:41,271
For rescuing me.

32
00:01:45,116 --> 00:01:46,278
From Michael.

33
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:49,613
I never gave up hope because I knew...

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,571
I knew that you would come for me, John.

35
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:55,793
I know this sounds crazy, but...

36
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,665
I don't remember...

37
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:02,989
rescuing you.

38
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:05,102
You don't remember rescuing her
because you didn't.

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,632
Just like you never rescued me.

40
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:18,757
Sheppard!

41
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Hey, buddy.

42
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,479
- What happened?
- Michael's compound collapsed on us.

43
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:28,026
I got to move.

44
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:35,774
I think I... I...

45
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:37,410
Yeah, hold on. Let me take a look.

46
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:53,425
What the hell was that?

47
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:55,344
Just old scrap, no big deal.

48
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,945
What about the others?

49
00:02:59,065 --> 00:03:01,480
I don't know. We got separated.

50
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:04,129
Try them on the radio.

51
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:13,099
Still no signal.
There's too much interference.

52
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:15,282
Pretty sure my leg is broken.

53
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:17,174
I think I'm remarkably fine.

54
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:18,994
Isn't that wonderful?

55
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,872
That brings me great comfort, thank you.

56
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:26,653
I don't think we're that deep.
I can see daylight.

57
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:28,691
If I can just...

58
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:37,179
- Sorry.
- I posted Edison at the entrance.

59
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:38,722
He'll get help.

60
00:03:38,882 --> 00:03:41,608
That is assuming
he wasn't hit by falling debris.

61
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:42,714
Doc,

62
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:45,937
The Dedalus left Atlantis when we were
still confirming Sheppard's story.

63
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,444
With that kind of a headstart,
they should be here in less than

64
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,798
three hours.
So one way or the other,

65
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:53,322
help is on the way.

66
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:55,989
I'm sorry.
It's just I'm not good in tight spaces.

67
00:03:57,058 --> 00:03:59,730
Look, there's no bad guys around, okay?

68
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:03,043
No bad guys, just a lot of debris. So...

69
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,915
if you could please just sit tight

70
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:07,994
and try not to make the ceiling
collapse, that would be great.

71
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:10,593
Okay. No bad guys.

72
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:12,864
Just... just sit tight.

73
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,744
- When did you get this?
- Moments ago.

74
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:31,891
Change of plans.

75
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:34,906
We're setting a new course.

76
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:39,811
Our compound has been compromised.

<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

88
00:07:04,464 --> 00:07:06,381
It's lieutenant Edison's IDC.

89
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,224
- What happened? Where's your team?
- There was a massive explosion.

90
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,242
Everyone was in the main compound,
the whole building imploded on itself.

91
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:18,327
- Were there any survivors?
- Radios are down.

92
00:07:18,447 --> 00:07:20,666
I don't know.
I just thought I should get back here.

93
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:23,238
No, you did the right thing.
Get him to the infirmary.

94
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:26,918
- How far away is the Dedalus?
- Still two hours out.

95
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:28,238
We can't wait that long.

96
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:31,359
Have the combat engineers gear up
and Doctor Keller ready her away team.

97
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:32,522
Yes, ma'am.

98
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,891
- What are you doing?
- I'm claustrophobic.

99
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:49,317
I'm trying to keep my mind busy,
which is hard, because you know, it's...

100
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,510
my mind.

101
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:54,895
Well, there's no way
anything useful survived that implosion.

102
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:56,146
Speak for yourself.

103
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,785
You know what I mean, Doc.

104
00:07:57,905 --> 00:07:59,414
I found a bunch of computer parts.

105
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,396
The mother boards
are all fried or snapped.

106
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:03,602
But these hard drives
might still be intact.

107
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:05,682
If I can just get the power to...

108
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:07,407
Hello hello.

109
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:12,426
- What is it? Something good?
- I don't know, a lot of information.

110
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:13,455
Hold on.

111
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:16,708
I think I just hit the jackpot.

112
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:18,919
Some way to broadcast a signal?

113
00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:22,301
Let people know our location,
speed up the rescue? What?

114
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:26,337
No, although in hindsight, you're right,
that should be considered the jackpot.

115
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:28,929
But, no, this is a hardrive,
I can only access what's on it.

116
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:30,388
Which is?

117
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:32,849
It's Michael's wiki.
It survived the explosion.

118
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,602
- The what?
- Michael's database.

119
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,838
A large chunk,
maybe the whole thing.

120
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,372
I mean we've got base schematics,

121
00:08:40,492 --> 00:08:42,819
medical research information,
list of planets...

122
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,892
- I mean, you know what this means?
- Yeah.

123
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:47,548
It means we're still stuck here
and I still have a broken leg.

124
00:08:47,668 --> 00:08:49,562
In the short term.
But if we get out of here...

125
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:50,382
If?

126
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:54,410
We'd have him on the run,
he'd be finished. Look, if Michael...

127
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,621
Oh no.

128
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:57,707
What?

129
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,939
I don't want to concern you any more
than you actually already are,

130
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,145
but if I'm reading this correctly,
then Michael is...

131
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:05,105
- Shut up.
- You shut up. This is important.

132
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:07,843
- If Michael is...
- Quit making noise.

133
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:10,137
It's footsteps.

134
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:13,276
Okay, revise that. Start making noise.

135
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:15,335
Down here!

136
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:17,381
- We're down here!
- Help!

137
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,117
All right, we've got four life signs
in two different locations.

138
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,247
First two should be right beneath us.

139
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:40,481
- Listen!
<i>- We're down here!</i>

140
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:47,039
McKay, is that you?

141
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:48,508
<i>Oh, thank God. Yes!</i>

142
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:51,544
- I'm trapped down here with Lorne.
<i>- Are you okay?</i>

143
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:53,690
- Were fine!
- Hey Doc!

144
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,725
Right, right, right.
Okay, Lorne's got a broken leg.

145
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:02,147
Stay put. We've got combat engineers
here. We're going to dig you out.

146
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:04,357
Hurry up!

147
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:06,818
We work as fast as is safe, Rodney.

148
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:11,184
No, you don't understand. I found out
that when the selfdestruct is initiated,

149
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:13,951
it's automatically programmed
to send a subspace burst.

150
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:16,196
<i>Michael's probably already on his way.</i>

151
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,108
It doesn't look like
they're too far down.

152
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:20,249
We should be able to get them out
inside of an hour.

153
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:22,376
But what about the other two?

154
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:25,505
They're a lot deeper.

155
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,423
Well, the Daedalus will be here soon,
so we can just beam them out, right?

156
00:10:29,543 --> 00:10:31,851
As long as Michael
doesn't get here first.

157
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:33,470
All right, let's get started.

158
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:38,433
Rivers, take a Jumper into orbit
and keep a look out for Michael's ship.

159
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:40,087
Let me know the second he gets here.

160
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:00,529
Okay.

161
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:01,623
One,

162
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:03,176
two,

163
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:04,615
three.

164
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:13,510
This thing ain't moving.

165
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,075
What happened to the others?

166
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:17,277
I don't know.

167
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,809
It happened pretty quickly,
not that many people made it out.

168
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:23,060
I'm so stupid.

169
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:25,957
Of course
the building was booby trapped.

170
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:29,242
- I should have seen that coming.
- Yeah, well none of us did.

171
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:30,819
- Yeah, but...
- What?

172
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:32,770
I'm the guy, you know...

173
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,520
like "the guy".

174
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,793
Everyone knew what we were getting into.

175
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:40,228
We all knew how dangerous it was
so don't beat yourself up about it.

176
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:42,873
You need to start thinking
about how to crawl your way outta here.

177
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:44,944
No way.

178
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:48,712
Serious, you just keep moving up,
keep moving the debris.

179
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:50,355
Work your way up.

180
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:52,228
I'm not leaving you behind, Sheppard.

181
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,412
I'm not trying to be a hero here.

182
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:58,013
It's a selfish thing.

183
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,377
I need you to dig a hole

184
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:08,397
so that the rescuers can come down
and get me.

185
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:13,088
It's the wrong way, chief.

186
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,543
If we get this beam out of you,
we get you free.

187
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:17,991
We'll dig ourselves out together.
Deal?

188
00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:21,985
You're not gonna listen to me
one way or the other, are you?

189
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:23,133
Great deal.

190
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,091
<i>Excellent.</i>

191
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:37,056
This is all very good.

192
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:40,764
Your son should be making an appearance
any day now.

193
00:12:43,056 --> 00:12:44,601
I thought that would make you happy.

194
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:49,857
I can't imagine carrying a child
inside of you is very comfortable.

195
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,602
I will not harm him.

196
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:59,543
- Why can't you just accept that?
- Because I know you.

197
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:03,218
All these worlds filled with people

198
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:06,129
busying themselves
with their pathetic lives.

199
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:08,386
They come and they go,
they live and they die,

200
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:11,797
and the galaxy is no better for it,
but your son...

201
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:16,216
your son will be
an instrument of change.

202
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,888
He will be remembered for the ages.

203
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:23,307
And what of his mother?

204
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:27,059
You speak often of his future,
but never of mine, why is that?

205
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,727
I'd hoped that you would...

206
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,405
- I had hoped that you would understand.
- It's time.

207
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:42,942
Very well.

208
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,730
Remove the restraints
and post a guard outside this door.

209
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:55,666
I must escape before our child is born.

210
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:59,134
He will kill me
once I'm of no use to him.

211
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,775
- I can't.
- Kanaan, why?

212
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:04,431
- It is too dangerous.
- For who?

213
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:07,240
He will kill us.

214
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:09,520
Kill us all.

215
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Yes, he will.

216
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:12,607
Whether you help me or not,

217
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,551
you are disposable to him,
can you not see that?

218
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:20,369
Listen to me.

219
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:24,220
Kanaan.

220
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:26,126
Please.

221
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,757
Please!

222
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:43,587
Come over here.

223
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,932
I'm fine, it's just a couple scratches.

224
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:50,453
Rodney McKay refusing medical help, now
I really know there's something wrong.

225
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:53,063
Seriously, I'm okay,
just you should look after Lorne.

226
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:58,665
Any survivors?

227
00:14:58,787 --> 00:15:01,822
We found two other life signs but
they're burried under a lot more debris.

228
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:04,616
So it's going to take a little longer.
I've got people working on it.

229
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:06,076
We know who it is?

230
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:07,619
Not yet.

231
00:15:10,023 --> 00:15:11,999
- Did you find Teyla?
- No.

232
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:13,804
But I think Sheppard was right.

233
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:16,247
He was gonna bring her here.
We just came to soon.

234
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:17,732
- <i>Colonel Carter.</i>
- Go ahead.

235
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:20,506
<i>Ma'am, a Wraith cruiser
just came out of hyperspace.</i>

236
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:22,384
Michael's here.

237
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:32,061
Multiple life signs.

238
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,345
It must be the Atlantians.

239
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:37,232
They're combing the debris.

240
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:40,986
But they must know
it's too dangerous to stay here.

241
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:43,947
They're searching for survivors.

242
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:48,114
This might not be a total loss,
after all.

243
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:52,081
Everyone, fall back to your Jumpers!

244
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,337
We got incoming!

245
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:15,896
Good shot!

246
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:17,957
Let's fall back to our Jumpers.

247
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,738
We still got men trapped down here.

248
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:22,140
They'll have to wait.
We're no good to them out.

249
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,570
Let's go! Fall back!

250
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:34,341
- Cloak the ship.
- Got it!

251
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:39,811
We're getting a reading.
The Gate's been activated.

252
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:41,130
Wraith battle technique:

253
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,559
dial the Gate, lock everyone out,
make sure they can't escape.

254
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,926
- Well it's a good one.
- Well, they're not idiots.

255
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:49,535
We got more darts on the way
and they got troups on the debris field.

256
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:51,014
Must know we got people there.

257
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,335
- How many Jumpers do we have?
- Three including this one.

258
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:55,144
I'm reading over twenty darts!

259
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:58,622
- But they can't see us though, right?
- We can't fire while we're cloaked.

260
00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:01,770
Look, it's gonna take them time
to dig them out. The same as us.

261
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,034
We wait for the Daedalus.
Rodney, take us into orbit.

262
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,547
Darts reporting minimal resistance.

263
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:13,648
They've started searching the debris.

264
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:16,589
We must work fast.
I need them alive.

265
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:24,560
Here it is.

266
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,110
- Is that Michael's cruiser?
- Well, it looks like it.

267
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,846
Does that mean
that Teyla's on that ship?

268
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:32,402
It's possible.

269
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,170
Well, that's great, though, right?

270
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,699
When the Daedalus shows up
we can just beam her up too, no?

271
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:38,312
It's not as easy as that.

272
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:41,528
Chances are Michael has
already removed her transmitter.

273
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:42,864
And even if he hasn't,

274
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:46,414
Wraith cruisers surround themselves
with an electromagnetic jamming field.

275
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:48,322
No beaming in, no beaming out.

276
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:51,261
We're so close.

277
00:17:59,806 --> 00:18:01,168
How about one more try?

278
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:05,975
- I feel pretty weak, buddy.
- You're not quiting on me yet, are you?

279
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:07,015
No.

280
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:11,095
I was thinking about it.

281
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:13,504
You know this is part of our deal?

282
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:17,058
You keep adding things
to this deal of ours.

283
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:19,104
Ready?

284
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:21,849
One,

285
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,691
two,

286
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:25,494
three.

287
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,997
I need you to get outta here.

288
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:41,506
Would you leave me
if I was stuck under there?

289
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:42,459
Yes.

290
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,731
You hear that?

291
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:46,922
What?

292
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:50,160
It sounds like digging.

293
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,452
Yeah.

294
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:54,346
They're here.

295
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:56,663
They're here.

296
00:18:57,851 --> 00:18:59,269
We're down here!

297
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,198
<i>We're coming for you, just stay calm!</i>

298
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:04,979
And you were gonna quit.

299
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:17,681
<i>Status.</i>

300
00:19:17,975 --> 00:19:20,397
Reading another ship in orbit.
It's a Wraith cruiser.

301
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:22,517
Shields up.
Ready forward beam weapons.

302
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:25,418
Sir, I'm receiving a coded transmission
from Colonel Carter.

303
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:27,630
- Sam, what's going on?
- <i>Long story short:</i>

304
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,858
<i>that's Michael's cruiser
and he likely has Teyla onboard.</i>

305
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:33,928
- So I can't blow him out of the sky.
- No, I'm afraid not.

306
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,515
We're taking fire, sir.
Shields are holding.

307
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,314
They managed to get the shields up
before we hit them.

308
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:42,937
That's unfortunate.

309
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:45,755
Transfer power to the hyperdrive.

310
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:48,820
What about the Darts?

311
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,331
Acceptable losses.

312
00:19:58,706 --> 00:19:59,799
He's running.

313
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,756
Not if I can help it.
Target his hyperdrive.

314
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:02,850
Yes, sir.

315
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,458
We've lost hyperdrive!

316
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:21,267
I guess we're fighting, after all.

317
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,952
Shields are down to 80%.

318
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:37,533
Daedalus, we still have two people
on the planet.

319
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:40,324
And it's just a matter of time
before the hybrids reach them.

320
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:42,329
Can you scan for transmitter signals?

321
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:45,170
<i>Stay calm. We're almost there.</i>

322
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:49,627
I'm gonna stop making fun
of combat engineers.

323
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:51,529
As of today, I promise.

324
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:54,835
Is Herrish up there with you?

325
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:59,056
<i>Yeah, he's here!
Don't worry, we'll have you out soon.</i>

326
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,058
Don Herrish is on leave
until next month.

327
00:21:09,723 --> 00:21:11,295
If we get outta here,

328
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,738
beer is on me, boys.

329
00:21:14,224 --> 00:21:15,279
What do you like?

330
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,855
Duff beer?

331
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,123
Or Oprah Ale?

332
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:22,619
<i>Duff.</i>

333
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:26,237
Well, they don't watch The Simpsons,

334
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:27,938
or drink beer.

335
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:29,919
Michael's hybrids.

336
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:33,215
Maybe he was tipped off
when the builing blew up.

337
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:37,063
You totally should
have gotten out of here.

338
00:21:37,183 --> 00:21:38,440
Yeah, whatever.

339
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:40,748
I can't reach my gun.

340
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:50,286
Here.

341
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:52,919
All right.

342
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:55,025
How do you wanna play this?

343
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:02,924
Shoot until we can't shoot anymore.

344
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:05,281
All right.

345
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,209
Been a pleasure.

346
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,278
Same.

347
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:27,393
We got 'em.
It's Colonel Sheppard and Ronon.

348
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:31,438
- Can you beam them up?
<i>- We'd have to drop our shields,</i>

349
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:34,066
I kind of think
that'd be a bad idea right now.

350
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:36,527
If Michael gets his hands on them,
he'll kill them.

351
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,112
We don't have a choice.

352
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:43,229
Be ready to drop the shields.
As soon as they're down,

353
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:45,411
- beam them directly to the infirmary.
- Yes, sir.

354
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:48,247
Sam, you should bring your Jumpers
onboard at the same time.

355
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,499
Understood, we're in position.

356
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:52,042
All right.

357
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:53,036
Do it.

358
00:23:09,094 --> 00:23:10,810
We got 'em.
Jumpers are in the bay.

359
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,937
Shields up!

360
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,961
Enemy vessel's raised shields again.

361
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:21,197
- We scored several direct hits.
- Keep firing.

362
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,992
How are we doing?

363
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:32,797
Not so good. Lost sublight,
hyperdrive, and Asgard weapons.

364
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:35,479
- Life support's down at 55%.
- What about the shields?

365
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,099
They're holding for now
but we're basically dead in the water.

366
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:45,652
Don't touch me.

367
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:50,337
Thought we'd lost you there.

368
00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:53,340
Yeah, well, for a second,
I thought we lost me.

369
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:57,093
It's gonna be okay though, right?

370
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:58,409
Yeah.

371
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:01,619
You need some serious work
but you should...

372
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:04,974
you know, live to fight
another day and all that.

373
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,670
So,

374
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:09,471
what's going on?
I guess

375
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:11,988
Michael showed up before the Daedalus.

376
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:15,494
Yeah, we had to lower the shields
to beam you up here.

377
00:24:15,614 --> 00:24:17,128
Sorry about that.

378
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:20,297
I'm sure McKay and Colonel Carter
will be able to fix it.

379
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:22,258
McKay is alive?

380
00:24:23,341 --> 00:24:24,242
Yeah.

381
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:29,473
Yeah, he and Lorne were the only two
to make it out of the rumble.

382
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:32,935
- I need to get back out there.
- No, no, look,

383
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:36,105
you will be fine,
but you're far from it now.

384
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:39,355
You've lost a lot of blood.
You need surgery

385
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:42,570
and a transfusion.
I mean, this can't wait.

386
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,774
Look, Doc, Michael's here.

387
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:47,645
That means Teyla's probably on the ship.

388
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:50,857
I'm too close to sit here
and do nothing.

389
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,905
You're not gonna be doing nothing,
you're gonna be laying here in surgery.

390
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:57,380
That's gotta be like...
It's gotta be a quick fix, just...

391
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,285
- No.
- I need a few hours.

392
00:24:59,405 --> 00:25:00,874
I'm sorry, I can't.

393
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:04,675
I have had the chance

394
00:25:05,497 --> 00:25:07,303
to rescue a teammate before.

395
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,730
And it slipped through my hands.

396
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:12,524
I am not letting that happen again.

397
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:22,402
- Nice one.
- Of course.

398
00:25:22,883 --> 00:25:25,696
Life support's still not working
at full power but

399
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,971
at least we won't freeze to death.

400
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:30,250
I've almost got sublight back online,

401
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,222
but the way these guys
are taxing our shields,

402
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:34,668
we won't have any power to spare anyway.

403
00:25:34,788 --> 00:25:36,742
We need to take out
the cruiser's main weapons.

404
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:38,083
Yeah, with what?

405
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:40,294
We can launch a 302 attack.

406
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:42,775
That's what I was thinking.

407
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:46,358
Colonel. Dr. Keller said
you were out of commission.

408
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,177
She revised her diagnosis.

409
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,416
Look, we may have an idea.

410
00:25:52,908 --> 00:25:54,767
Maybe a way to get Teyla back.

411
00:25:58,205 --> 00:26:00,189
We need to take out
the cruiser's main weapons.

412
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,045
The easiest way to do that right now
is to launch an attack with 302s.

413
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:07,566
Well, I wouldn't exactly call that easy.
They'll send Darts to intercept them.

414
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:11,075
- That's what we're counting on.
- To launch them, they'll open the bay.

415
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:12,813
If we have a cloaked Jumper in place,

416
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:15,162
a team should be able to sneak
onto the cruiser undetected.

417
00:26:15,322 --> 00:26:18,076
Find Teyla, bust her out
and blast our way home.

418
00:26:18,196 --> 00:26:21,127
As a rule, I like to keep
daring rescues down to one a day.

419
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,838
Look, shields are already down to 20%,

420
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,340
it's just a matter of time
before they fail completely.

421
00:26:28,117 --> 00:26:30,718
She's over there, Steven,
counting on us.

422
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:33,055
I won't take "no" for an answer.

423
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:40,274
All right, take a cloaked Jumper.
Radio us when you're in position.

424
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:51,406
- What really happened in the infirmary?
- Nothing.

425
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:54,076
You're telling me, if I go down there
and talk to Jennifer,

426
00:26:54,236 --> 00:26:56,023
she'll tell me that you're fit for duty.

427
00:26:56,143 --> 00:26:58,039
- I'm just trying to do a job.
- So am I.

428
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:00,749
And part of my job
is determining whether or not

429
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,968
you're gonna be a liability
on this mission.

430
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:08,286
I have more respect for you than any
commanding officer I've ever had but,

431
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,187
I'm getting on that Jumper,
end of story.

432
00:27:12,142 --> 00:27:14,555
I'll surrender for court martial
when I'm done.

433
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:33,840
You know, Ronon and I
could probably handle this.

434
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:36,581
Maybe you should stay with the Jumper.

435
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:39,699
Or not.

436
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,793
- Daedalus, we're in position.
<i>- Confirmed.</i>

437
00:27:44,044 --> 00:27:45,044
Launch 302s.

438
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,006
302s are approaching.

439
00:27:54,896 --> 00:27:56,395
Give me the Darts.

440
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:04,137
- It's closing.
- I see that.

441
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:06,232
- It's closing quickly.
- I got it.

442
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:15,077
Daedalus, we're in.

443
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:31,746
It worked.
Cruiser just lost main weapons.

444
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,842
Let's hope
that Sheppard has the same luck.

445
00:28:49,238 --> 00:28:52,541
All right, this won't take more
than a couple of seconds.

446
00:28:57,585 --> 00:28:58,868
That's troubling.

447
00:28:59,394 --> 00:29:00,216
What?

448
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:03,147
Michael's a lot further ahead with
the repairs than I would have thought.

449
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:05,499
Hyperdrive's almost back online.
We got to make this quick.

450
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:08,640
- What do you mean quick?
- 15 minutes. It's not a lot of time.

451
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,189
No, it's not a lot of time. So...

452
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:13,173
why don't you tell us
where Teyla is, already?

453
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,874
All right, all right, all right.

454
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,534
Got it! Okay.

455
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:18,464
Follow me.

456
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:20,691
Or... you...

457
00:29:34,811 --> 00:29:37,039
- John?
- We're going to get down here.

458
00:29:38,212 --> 00:29:40,021
Not a moment too soon.

459
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,774
We got to get you back to the Jumper.

460
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:48,190
You okay?

461
00:29:48,824 --> 00:29:51,592
- It's my baby.
- What? Is something wrong?

462
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:55,152
No. I have been having contractions
for over an hour now.

463
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,167
They're very close.

464
00:29:58,853 --> 00:30:00,230
My baby's coming.

465
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:13,660
God!

466
00:30:13,903 --> 00:30:14,956
I'm sorry.

467
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:16,404
I just need a moment.

468
00:30:19,843 --> 00:30:22,535
I'd carry her buddy but...
I'm not really up to it.

469
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,122
- Yeah. Okay, you're ready?
- No. I can walk.

470
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:28,226
I just need a moment.

471
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,871
Say, friends,
we have a small issue, here.

472
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:32,937
Oh, what now?

473
00:30:33,057 --> 00:30:35,737
Looks like Michael got his hyperdrive
back online. It's powering up.

474
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,099
- Can you shut it down?
- Not from this little thing.

475
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:39,819
The drive room is down the corridor.

476
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:43,117
You slap a C-4 charge on that thing,
it should certainly shut it down.

477
00:30:44,784 --> 00:30:47,024
- Where?
- Here. I've a map.

478
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,524
All right. Ronon, you're with me.

479
00:30:54,164 --> 00:30:57,160
I'll be right back.
Everything is gonna be fine.

480
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:02,290
You take care of her.

481
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:11,148
So...

482
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:12,959
how are you doing?

483
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,699
The pain is very great.

484
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:15,779
Oh yeah.

485
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:18,682
Yeah I had a kidney stone once.
Incredibly painful.

486
00:31:18,802 --> 00:31:21,367
Same kind of thing from what I'm told.
So I hear you.

487
00:31:21,624 --> 00:31:23,567
Actually, my cat and I had one
at the same time.

488
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:25,304
We were not fun to be around,

489
00:31:25,424 --> 00:31:28,976
He, 'cause he was eating the dry food,
I wasn't drinking enough liquids.

490
00:31:29,248 --> 00:31:32,647
That's why you always see me hydrating.
I've no desire to experience that again.

491
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,607
- It's just...
- Fascinating story.

492
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,957
Yes, no problem.

493
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:40,047
Okay just, just breathe?
Breathe, okay?

494
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:45,157
- What you doing?
- It's Lamaze. It's supposed to...

495
00:31:45,277 --> 00:31:48,112
I don't know what I'm doing.
What do you need me to do?

496
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:50,935
Okay, there it is, there they are.

497
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,501
- The baby is coming!
- You just...

498
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,465
Hang on. We'll get back on the Deadelus,
Keller can pull it out.

499
00:31:57,848 --> 00:31:59,507
The baby is coming now!

500
00:32:15,555 --> 00:32:18,322
- It's almost powered up.
- Give me your C-4.

501
00:32:24,974 --> 00:32:26,432
- Give it to me.
- I got it.

502
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:28,551
Give it to me.
You don't have to do everything.

503
00:32:31,764 --> 00:32:32,957
All right. You're ready?

504
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:34,747
Let's go.

505
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:53,896
All right.
Let's hope we're far enough away.

506
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,354
Yeah, we'll see.

507
00:32:55,813 --> 00:32:57,190
Fire in the hole.

508
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,997
- What happenend?
- Hyperdrive just exploded.

509
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:08,846
No. That's impossible.

510
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:10,911
Main power is out
across most of the ship.

511
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,476
- An accidental overload?
- Doesn't appear that way.

512
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:15,481
How did they do that?

513
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:17,100
I will look into it.

514
00:33:19,463 --> 00:33:20,718
They're onboard.

515
00:33:22,136 --> 00:33:23,769
How did they get onboard?

516
00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:26,091
- Well, can't you just hold it in?
- No, Rodney!

517
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:28,857
This doesn't happen this quick!
No one has babies this quick!

518
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:30,896
My water broke quite a while ago.

519
00:33:31,016 --> 00:33:32,650
I've been trying to...

520
00:33:35,853 --> 00:33:37,379
Oh, I can see its head.

521
00:33:37,743 --> 00:33:40,011
That's good.
That's a good thing, Rodney.

522
00:33:40,213 --> 00:33:43,210
Yeah but am I supposed to touch it?
Am I allowed? I don't know what to do!

523
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,303
Rodney,

524
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:46,651
calm down.
I need you to be calm.

525
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:48,555
But I'm not an MD.
I've never been an MD!

526
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:50,778
People have been having babies
for thousands of years.

527
00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:52,120
Most without doctors.

528
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,641
But before doctors the infantile
mortality rate was very high.

529
00:33:54,761 --> 00:33:56,126
Something like one in three.

530
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:59,293
No, a doctor is a very important part
of this process, trust me.

531
00:33:59,758 --> 00:34:02,380
There are no doctors around.
You have to do this.

532
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:04,812
We don't have a choice.

533
00:34:04,974 --> 00:34:06,081
Okay, okay.

534
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:07,134
Now,

535
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:09,523
you need to catch him.

536
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:13,034
- Catch him?
- Yes. You need to catch him,

537
00:34:13,154 --> 00:34:15,570
- while I push him out.
- Oh, God!

538
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,082
OK, well, just...

539
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,857
Underhand him, all right.
I've never been good at baseball.

540
00:34:23,196 --> 00:34:23,985
Please.

541
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,989
Okay, I can do this!

542
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,324
All right, I may have panicked a little
back there but we're gonna do this!

543
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:32,403
I am great with kids.

544
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:34,389
The little ones.
The ones who don't talk back.

545
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:35,791
Here he comes!

546
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:43,796
Okay. Almost there, almost there!

547
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:51,133
I got him!

548
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,388
I got him!

549
00:34:58,035 --> 00:34:59,054
It's a boy.

550
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,941
- Watch his head.
- Right, right. OK.

551
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,047
Oh, God!

552
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:11,643
Do I get to cut the cord?
I can cut the cord now, right?

553
00:35:11,763 --> 00:35:14,114
OK, OK.
Here you go.

554
00:35:14,897 --> 00:35:16,788
Yeah. OK. So...

555
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:20,958
Right, Teyla,

556
00:35:22,148 --> 00:35:24,024
I'd like to introduce you to your son.

557
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,228
I got it!
Didn't let it fall or anything.

558
00:35:41,027 --> 00:35:42,741
You did a wonderful job.

559
00:35:43,592 --> 00:35:45,050
That's good, that's...

560
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:46,764
You're good, Rodney.

561
00:35:46,993 --> 00:35:49,057
We got to get you out of here.

562
00:35:50,264 --> 00:35:52,505
Ronon, you may need to help me.

563
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,530
Ready?

564
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:11,009
- Why isn't it decloaking?
- Let me see, did you break it?

565
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,859
No, no...
We parked the Jumper right here.

566
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:16,019
- Yes.
- One hundred percent.

567
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:18,300
Someone stole the Jumper.

568
00:36:19,758 --> 00:36:21,189
This is not good.

569
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,703
I told you you should have stayed here.

570
00:36:33,351 --> 00:36:36,317
How the hell are we supposed
to get off this ship, now?

571
00:36:37,701 --> 00:36:40,430
I just delivered a baby.
That's not enough for today?

572
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,479
Don't they have escape pods
or things like that on the cruiser?

573
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,667
No, they...

574
00:36:45,448 --> 00:36:46,381
Wait...

575
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:47,569
I know...

576
00:36:47,763 --> 00:36:50,424
We need to get back to a terminal.
A lot of their internal power is down.

577
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:53,535
Maybe I can short out the jamming code,
we can get the Daedalus to beam us out.

578
00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:55,137
Great. Lead the way.

579
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,836
Don't shoot! Put me down.

580
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:11,440
It's all right, John.

581
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,560
This is Kanaan.

582
00:37:13,262 --> 00:37:14,639
He is the father.

583
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:35,836
This is our chance.

584
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40,967
These are the friends I told you of.

585
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:45,536
They can help you.
Get back to your old self.

586
00:37:46,413 --> 00:37:48,147
But first you have to help us.

587
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:51,110
We must get off this ship.

588
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:54,094
Do you know a way?

589
00:37:54,782 --> 00:37:55,558
Yes.

590
00:37:57,266 --> 00:37:59,200
- Follow me.
- No offence, Teyla.

591
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:01,578
I don't trust this guy.

592
00:38:02,498 --> 00:38:04,402
He has tried to save me before.

593
00:38:04,522 --> 00:38:05,582
I trust him.

594
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,734
Give me your weapon.

595
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:17,702
What's your plan?

596
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:27,145
Sir?
We've got a Dart trying to hail us.

597
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:28,788
What?

598
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:31,109
Let me hear it.

599
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,430
<i>This is Colonel John Sheppard.
Authentication code:</i>

600
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,373
<i>bravo, delta, charlie, alpha, niner.</i>

601
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:39,964
<i>Daedalus, please come in.</i>

602
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:43,445
Authenticated, Colonel Sheppard.
What the hell happened to your Jumper?

603
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:47,037
I got all turned around in the garage.
I was in a rush, I borrowed this Dart.

604
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:49,709
I've got the team beamed
into the storage device.

605
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:51,748
- Do you have Teyla?
- Yes, and the baby.

606
00:38:51,868 --> 00:38:53,963
You beamed a baby into Wraith storage?

607
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:55,284
No.

608
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,140
I got it right here.

609
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:01,622
So...

610
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:04,997
Feel free to do whatever
you want to that cruiser.

611
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:06,293
<i>Copy that.</i>

612
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,588
Major Marks?

613
00:39:08,808 --> 00:39:10,802
Please make that ship go away.

614
00:39:11,355 --> 00:39:12,300
Yes, sir.

615
00:39:23,246 --> 00:39:26,591
Colonel, head down to the planet,
beam your crew out and land that Dart.

616
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:28,586
I'm sure
you can dial up that Stargate now.

617
00:39:28,706 --> 00:39:29,541
<i>Copy that.</i>

618
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,330
- What's with the bags?
- What's with the flowers?

619
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,719
I'm going to see Teyla.
You heard I delivered her baby?

620
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:48,768
I did.

621
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,062
And they tell me
she's going to name him Rodney.

622
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:52,459
Yes! Really?

623
00:39:53,214 --> 00:39:54,566
No. Not really.

624
00:39:55,022 --> 00:39:58,020
- That's funny. Where are you going?
- Back to Earth.

625
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,044
- What? Why?
- They caught the last Ba'al clone.

626
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:04,450
The Tok'ra gonna extract the symbiote.
They want SG-1 to put in an appearance.

627
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:06,620
Plus,

628
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,320
the IOA wants to do an exhaustive review

629
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,947
of my first year in command, so...

630
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:13,793
- That can't be good.
- Are you crazy?

631
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,385
They probably want to give you a medal.
You had a great year.

632
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:19,547
I know my opinion
doesn't mean much to those folks, but...

633
00:40:19,741 --> 00:40:22,302
I think you've done an excellent job.
I'm glad you took the post.

634
00:40:22,597 --> 00:40:24,652
Thanks Rodney, that means a lot.

635
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,307
Tell Sheppard the court martial
will have to wait.

636
00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:30,685
Sure. See you soon.

637
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:33,117
I hope so.

638
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:38,817
How long will the surgery take?

639
00:40:39,262 --> 00:40:41,085
The Doc says a few hours.

640
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,740
I'll be off my feet for a week or so.

641
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,426
I cannot believe you attempted
to mount a rescue in your condition.

642
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:48,631
Attempt?

643
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,506
The last time I checked, I succeeded.

644
00:40:54,414 --> 00:40:55,668
How's the kid?

645
00:40:55,961 --> 00:40:58,715
Doctor Keller says
he's perfectly healthy.

646
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,616
I say he's perfectly everything.

647
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:04,871
It's great.

648
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:07,138
It's great.

649
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,742
I want to thank you.

650
00:41:12,564 --> 00:41:13,686
There's no need.

651
00:41:14,103 --> 00:41:16,231
I never gave up hope, because I knew...

652
00:41:18,504 --> 00:41:20,527
I knew that you would come for me, John.

653
00:41:21,516 --> 00:41:23,238
You would have done the same for me.

654
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:25,349
Yes.

655
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:26,533
All right.

656
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:28,955
You're ready, Colonel?

657
00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:29,911
Ready?

658
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,434
From my understanding,
I'm... not doing anything.

659
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:36,543
Yeah, that's right.
You'll just have to lay still and...

660
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:38,670
let me play with your insides.

661
00:41:42,977 --> 00:41:43,800
Sorry.

662
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,920
Let's go.

663
00:41:47,324 --> 00:41:49,094
What are you going to name the kid?

664
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:52,953
Well, if it's all right with you,
I was thinking of Tughan John.

665
00:41:53,073 --> 00:41:55,735
After my father and after you.

666
00:41:56,773 --> 00:41:57,664
Really?

667
00:41:58,088 --> 00:41:58,973
Well...

668
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,077
McKay is gonna hate that.

669
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,715
I will be very honoured.

670
00:42:04,902 --> 00:42:06,029
Very well.

671
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:08,263
Tughan

672
00:42:08,383 --> 00:42:09,476
John

673
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:10,800
Emmagan.

674
00:42:22,722 --> 00:42:23,807
Colonel Carter.

675
00:42:23,927 --> 00:42:25,269
Mr Woolsey, how are you?

676
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:27,198
Very well, thank you for asking.

677
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:30,638
So, is this whole evaluation process
gonna take very long?

678
00:42:30,778 --> 00:42:33,558
There's a lot of work on Atlantis.
And I'm kind of anxious to get back.

679
00:42:34,036 --> 00:42:35,438
I'm sure you are.

680
00:42:35,765 --> 00:42:36,653
However,

681
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:41,190
the IOA has decided that perhaps
someone with a different skill set

682
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,224
would be more suited to lead
the Atlantis expedition now.

683
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,402
Excuse me?

684
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,750
I'm here to inform you
that effective immediately,

685
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:53,922
you are being removed from command.

686
00:42:57,573 --> 00:42:59,287
Who's replacing me?

687
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,164
As a matter of fact,

688
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:03,755
I am.
