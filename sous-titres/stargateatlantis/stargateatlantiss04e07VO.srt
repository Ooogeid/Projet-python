1
00:00:02,105 --> 00:00:04,893
Are you ready?
They're preparing to dial the Gate.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,807
Yeah, almost finished.

3
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:10,101
I know,

4
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:13,247
I'm terrible at packing.
I never know how much to bring.

5
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:14,975
<i>We are only going overnight.</i>

6
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:16,353
I'm sure you have enough.

7
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:18,697
Well, you'd think so, but...

8
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,169
You seem nervous.

9
00:00:22,342 --> 00:00:24,492
Oh, no, I'm fine.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,335
Well, maybe a little.

11
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:30,793
Going off-world
is still kind of new to me.

12
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,648
Whole other galaxy
and meeting new civilizations...

13
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:37,873
My people are very welcoming
and they're eager to meet you.

14
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:39,790
Well, I'm eager to meet them, too,

15
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:42,246
learn about their culture
and their history.

16
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:44,853
A gesture for which
they will be most grateful.

17
00:00:45,183 --> 00:00:46,287
It's just...

18
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:49,719
I know they were very fond of Carson.

19
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:52,821
I only hope to make
half the impression he did.

20
00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:54,803
What are those?

21
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:56,266
Oh, lollipops.

22
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:58,101
For the kids.

23
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:00,202
Makes the check-ups go easier.

24
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,264
You will make a wonderful impression.

25
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:11,024
Look at you.

26
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:12,325
Got a date?

27
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:13,823
Please.

28
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:16,238
You will contact us if you need us?

29
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:18,373
Oh, we'll be fine. You kids have fun.

30
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:20,225
You're gonna love the Athosians.

31
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:22,553
I'm going to experience
my first tandul feast.

32
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:23,919
<i>Oh, those are good, but</i>

33
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:25,718
watch out for the...

34
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:28,470
- What do you call it?
- Roos wine.

35
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,426
<i>Roos wine.</i>

36
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:31,171
Tasty stuff, but a hell of a kick.

37
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,971
We really should be going.

38
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:34,749
Have fun, kids.

39
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:48,193
- The settlement is through the woods.
- Lead the way.

40
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:50,968
It is some distance.
Let me help you with those.

41
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:52,384
Oh no, no, it's okay.

42
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:55,160
I'm the idiot who over-packed.
I should be the idiot carrying them.

43
00:01:57,187 --> 00:01:58,954
So Sheppard was right, huh?

44
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:01,475
About that hot date tonight?

45
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:05,625
<i>I didn't think it would be this far.</i>

46
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:14,554
Is it always this quiet?

47
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:16,678
Something is wrong.

48
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:23,201
Hello?

49
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:29,679
Hello!

50
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:33,097
Is anybody here?

51
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:34,546
Where is everyone?

52
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:36,760
I do not know,

53
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:39,913
but they did not leave
of their own accord.

54
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:42,212
Are you saying they were attacked?

55
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,211
Or culled.

64
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:58,360
I thought the Wraith
didn't know about this planet.

65
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,651
That was my understanding as well.

66
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:05,876
Well then, how could they just...

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,255
What is it?

68
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:23,807
You know them?

69
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:27,867
We must leave.

70
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:39,918
Over here.

71
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,436
The weapons cache is too far.

72
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,808
- What?
- Better to make a run for the gate.

73
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:52,862
What are you...
What are you looking for?

74
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,055
Did you bring a weapon?

75
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:59,469
No, it's just medical supplies.
Don't you have a weapon?

76
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:02,597
<i>Just a knife.</i>

77
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,010
I was coming to visit my people.
I did not believe I would need a gun.

78
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:09,265
- Who are those men?
- Bola Kai.

79
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:11,609
- <i>You know them?</i>
- I know of them.

80
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:14,626
The markings on their faces
are distinctive to their tribe,

81
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:16,625
but I have never
crossed paths with them...

82
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:17,779
Until now.

83
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,477
Are they dangerous?

84
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:25,370
Beyond dangerous.

85
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:27,792
Let's go.

86
00:05:58,343 --> 00:05:59,517
Are you all right?

87
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:01,206
I twisted my ankle.

88
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,783
We have to keep moving.

89
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:05,410
Just hang on a sec.

90
00:06:05,724 --> 00:06:06,984
Is it broken?

91
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:09,414
No, I don't think so.

92
00:06:09,977 --> 00:06:11,754
It's probably just sprained.

93
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:16,851
<i>Leave the bag. It's too heavy.</i>

94
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,278
Oh, God, what do we do?

95
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:43,668
It is too risky to return
to the weapons cache.

96
00:06:43,812 --> 00:06:45,213
What weapons cache?

97
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,646
We gave my people guns

98
00:06:47,796 --> 00:06:50,543
to protect themselves
in the event they were raided.

99
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,061
What makes you think
that the guns would still there?

100
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:55,395
Wouldn't that be the first thing
those guys would steal?

101
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:57,795
If the Bola Kai stole them,
they would be using them.

102
00:06:59,272 --> 00:07:00,964
<i>But the weapons cache is too far,</i>

103
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:02,549
especially in your condition,

104
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:05,136
<i>and we have no idea how many
more Bola Kai are out there.</i>

105
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:13,478
Our best option is to take out
these guards by ourselves.

106
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,448
Take them out?
What are you talking about?

107
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:17,269
How are we going to do that?

108
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:18,691
I don't know yet.

109
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:20,860
Hey, listen,

110
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,237
I am not like you.
I don't know anything about fighting.

111
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:27,825
Just do what I say.

112
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:29,989
I want to, believe me, but I...

113
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,583
I don't think I can.

114
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,206
You must think otherwise.

115
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:35,342
What we first need to do is create a...

116
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:11,411
They're gone.

117
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:15,373
Are you all right?

118
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:17,457
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:20,369
I know this is something
for which you are unprepared.

120
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:22,718
I should be prepared, I know.

121
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,267
Unfortunately, I'm afraid things may
get worse before they get better.

122
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:30,847
Those guards will alert
the others to our situation,

123
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:33,640
<i>and they will hunt us.</i>

124
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:37,878
The longer we avoid capture,
the better our chances.

125
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,772
They will continue
to guard the Gate, yes,

126
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:43,333
<i>but in time,
Atlantis will realize we are late,</i>

127
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:45,218
<i>and they will send a rescue team.</i>

128
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:47,779
But we're not due back till tomorrow.

129
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:52,410
It is therefore critical that
we elude capture until then.

130
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:54,958
<i>What do you need to help your injury?</i>

131
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,636
Well, I should probably wrap it,

132
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,333
but the ace bandages
are in the medical kit.

133
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,651
The kit is on the way
to the weapons cache.

134
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:08,593
Hopefully, it'll still be where we...

135
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:13,680
What is that?

136
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:16,057
They are summoning the others,

137
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:17,927
<i>gathering them.</i>

138
00:09:19,563 --> 00:09:21,080
The hunt is beginning.

139
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:36,596
Oh, thank God.

140
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:38,955
- You must move quickly.
- I will.

141
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:44,715
Ibuprofen.

142
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:47,735
- Helps with the pain and swelling.
- Yes.

143
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:50,920
Dr. Mckay uses them frequently,

144
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:52,762
along with antihistamines, antacids,

145
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:54,331
motion-sickness pills...

146
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:57,515
You forgot the prescription I just
wrote him for restless leg syndrome.

147
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:00,977
<i>I've always been a wimp.</i>

148
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,340
I've got a low threshold for pain.

149
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,281
People often underestimate
the level of discomfort

150
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:08,164
they are capable of enduring.

151
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:12,989
When I was a child, several of us were
sent into the woods for 10 days alone.

152
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,826
10 days alone?

153
00:10:15,986 --> 00:10:17,744
It is a rite of passage among my people.

154
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:19,871
<i>No food, no water.</i>

155
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:21,935
Forced to survive on our own.

156
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:24,542
None of us believed we could endure it,
but all of us did.

157
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:28,004
I went to summer camp.

158
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:31,094
There were other kids.

159
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:33,731
We had cabins.

160
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,136
With beds.

161
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:39,350
And electricity, and food.

162
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:41,017
I see.

163
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:43,682
I didn't even make it three days.

164
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:45,212
I got homesick,

165
00:10:45,472 --> 00:10:47,315
called my parents to come and get me.

166
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:05,835
The weapons cache?

167
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:10,587
Well, where are the weapons?
Obviously, the Bola Kai don't have them.

168
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,077
My people must have need them
to fight off the attack,

169
00:11:13,836 --> 00:11:16,002
but then why were they not successful?

170
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,831
The Bola Kai's weapons
would have been no match against these.

171
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:25,760
- Over there.
- What?

172
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:28,093
- There is a blind across the river.
- A blind?

173
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,910
For hunting. It is well hidden.

174
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:31,906
It will provide shelter for the night.

175
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:45,423
We're going to cross that?

176
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,801
<i>It is the quickest way across.</i>

177
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,232
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

178
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:56,821
My people built it. It is quite safe.

179
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,010
I'm...

180
00:11:58,406 --> 00:11:59,929
I'm sure it is. It-it's just...

181
00:12:01,427 --> 00:12:03,504
Well, my... my ankle,

182
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:05,745
and I've also got this...

183
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:07,782
inner ear thing.

184
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:10,619
We call it vertigo, and...

185
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:12,443
God, look at it!

186
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:18,341
There comes a point in adversity
when fear disappears,

187
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:20,700
- leaving only the will to survive.
- I know,

188
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:23,098
it's just, I don't think I'm even

189
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,844
remotely close to that point.

190
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:28,619
Fine.

191
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:30,027
Stay here then.

192
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,804
Oh, well, wait! I mean, I...

193
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,772
I'm sure I could...

194
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,726
I could climb down and find a...

195
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,060
Shallow spot in the river to cross.

196
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,657
I mean, it might take me
a little longer but...

197
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:50,250
Oh, God...

198
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,446
Here we go.

199
00:12:57,357 --> 00:12:59,052
It's perfectly safe...

200
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,924
Perfectly

201
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:02,154
safe.

202
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,272
Wobbly...

203
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,199
Too wobbly...

204
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:29,783
Almost there...

205
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:16,231
Thank you.

206
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:18,649
Come on.

207
00:14:25,724 --> 00:14:27,383
Maybe your people managed to

208
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:29,635
make it to the Gate and escape.

209
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:31,973
All of them?

210
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:34,203
Well, I don't know, maybe.

211
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:37,507
I mean, we haven't found
any bodies, right?

212
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:42,034
From what you've said,
I doubt the Bola Kai would...

213
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:45,162
take the time to bury their victims.

214
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:46,538
No,

215
00:14:47,113 --> 00:14:48,367
they do not...

216
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:52,908
because when they are done with their
victims, usually very little remains.

217
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,022
What are you telling me,
they're cannibals?

218
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:00,216
Teyla?

219
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:48,462
Are you all right?

220
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:50,285
- Yeah.
- Stay here.

221
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:53,037
What? Teyla! Teyla!

222
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:07,914
That's one's dead, but...
He's still alive.

223
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:19,123
We cannot afford to take prisoners.

224
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:22,730
Well, we could... We could have tied
him up and left him in the woods.

225
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,714
Then the others would have found him
and released him to rejoin the hunt.

226
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:31,567
<i>I know it is difficult to accept,</i>

227
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:34,513
but the fewer of them,
the better our chances at survival.

228
00:17:58,552 --> 00:18:00,565
His hands are tied.
He must have been a...

229
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:01,833
a prisoner.

230
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:08,589
He's got a stab wound to his abdomen.
Will you get me my medical kit?

231
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:10,425
We have to leave him.

232
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:13,031
What are you talking about?
He's one of your people.

233
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:14,802
He is not Athosian.

234
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:18,668
But his... his clothes...

235
00:18:18,788 --> 00:18:20,482
I have never seen him before.

236
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,273
He's obviously not one of them,
and if I don't suture his wound,

237
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,070
he's going to bleed to death.

238
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:27,233
More Bola Kai will be here very soon.

239
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:30,486
I know, but this won't take long, okay?
Please?

240
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:45,467
Well...

241
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:50,907
I got the bleeding under control.

242
00:18:52,158 --> 00:18:55,080
If the wound doesn't get infected,
he should be okay.

243
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:57,363
It will be dark soon.

244
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:59,724
Stay here with him.
I will find the blind.

245
00:18:59,998 --> 00:19:02,435
- Is it far?
<i>- No.</i>

246
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:49,157
- Did you find it?
- Yes.

247
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:50,907
How is he?

248
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:52,847
Unconscious, but stable.

249
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,855
Can he be moved?

250
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:57,514
Oh, I don't know. He shouldn't be.

251
00:19:57,842 --> 00:20:00,118
His condition's precarious.
I would hate to...

252
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:02,076
Yes, he can be moved.

253
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,280
- Water from the river.
- Thank you.

254
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:20,441
I have laid traps around the perimeter.
If any Bola Kai come near,

255
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:22,965
hopefully, we will hear them
before they discover us.

256
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,657
Good.

257
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,401
How's your ankle?

258
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:30,775
The swelling's not too bad...

259
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,385
And the pain's eased up,
thanks to the painkillers.

260
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:36,598
If you wish to sleep, I can...

261
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:39,782
What?

262
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:12,733
What is that?

263
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,193
Dinner.

264
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:18,743
<i>They are attracted
to the warmth of our bodies.</i>

265
00:21:28,343 --> 00:21:31,043
The taste leaves much to be desired,
but it will sustain you.

266
00:21:32,962 --> 00:21:35,163
No, thanks, I'm not hungry.

267
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,298
You should eat.

268
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,216
This was my least
favorite part of survivor.

269
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:49,993
He's regaining consciousness.

270
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:57,361
It's okay. You're safe now.

271
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,363
Who are you?

272
00:21:59,994 --> 00:22:01,621
Nabel Golan...

273
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:03,991
of the Genii.

274
00:22:04,343 --> 00:22:05,693
The Genii?

275
00:22:05,966 --> 00:22:07,218
What are you doing here?

276
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,871
I was planted

277
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:12,166
to work inside the Athosian community...

278
00:22:12,906 --> 00:22:14,509
To gather intel.

279
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:16,505
What happened to them?

280
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:18,839
Dead.

281
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,933
<i>All of them.</i>

282
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:27,944
Who killed my people?

283
00:22:29,011 --> 00:22:30,017
Wraith.

284
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,186
<i>A culling. Entire settlement.</i>

285
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,106
Not the Bola Kai?

286
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:38,968
Bola Kai were the ones
who told the Wraith about them.

287
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:42,279
The Bola Kai are Wraith worshipers?

288
00:22:43,273 --> 00:22:44,749
I was able to...

289
00:22:44,912 --> 00:22:47,285
escape during the attack,

290
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:50,414
but I was cut off from the Gate.

291
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:53,582
<i>Bola Kai were guarding it.</i>

292
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:55,737
They captured me.

293
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:57,364
I have never seen you before.

294
00:22:57,514 --> 00:22:59,619
How long have you lived among my people?

295
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:02,338
I only arrived a few days ago.

296
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:11,727
Where are you from?

297
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:15,557
She is a friend of mine
from another world.

298
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:18,222
Your equipment, it looks ancestral.

299
00:23:18,454 --> 00:23:20,152
<i>We discovered it in our travels.</i>

300
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:22,540
We have been away
for some time, trading.

301
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:23,739
<i>Trading?</i>

302
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:25,574
With who?

303
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:30,631
If you are still seeking intel,

304
00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:33,999
then you are wasting
what few breaths you have remaining.

305
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:35,521
<i>So say,</i>

306
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,501
<i>"thank you for saving me",</i>

307
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:40,172
and be done with this discussion.

308
00:23:42,382 --> 00:23:43,571
Thank you...

309
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:45,844
for saving me.

310
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:04,280
You have not slept all night.

311
00:24:04,854 --> 00:24:06,958
With people trying to kill us and...

312
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:09,825
creatures crawling around
under the ground?

313
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:14,357
Not to mention I'm starving.

314
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:22,024
Not that starving.

315
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:25,183
- It will give you strength.
- It'll make me puke.

316
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:29,218
You do not believe
you are capable of eating it,

317
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:31,223
and so you do not.

318
00:24:31,943 --> 00:24:34,212
No, I think it's disgusting,

319
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:35,906
and so I do not.

320
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,896
I have a friend like you,

321
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:43,485
afraid to challenge himself.

322
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,071
I'm not afraid of challenges.

323
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:49,407
I signed up to be chief of medicine

324
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:51,823
on an expedition
in a whole other galaxy.

325
00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:54,371
That's about as challenging as it gets,

326
00:24:55,472 --> 00:24:57,374
<i>but eating gross food?</i>

327
00:24:57,864 --> 00:25:00,761
Sorry, but that's where I draw the line.

328
00:25:02,205 --> 00:25:03,618
Fair enough.

329
00:25:34,014 --> 00:25:34,953
<i>See?</i>

330
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:37,371
No puking.

331
00:25:37,964 --> 00:25:39,002
Yet.

332
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:44,482
So this...

333
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:46,505
friend of yours...

334
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:49,430
One of your team members?

335
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:53,291
A certain uptight astrophysicist maybe?

336
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,245
No.

337
00:25:55,983 --> 00:25:57,336
Athosian.

338
00:25:58,703 --> 00:26:00,507
His name is Kanan.

339
00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:03,842
A natural leader,
but he is unaware of it,

340
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:06,520
burdened by an overly

341
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:08,666
cautious nature.

342
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:12,324
He's more than a friend, isn't he?

343
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,367
<i>He's the one you were coming to see.</i>

344
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,119
The hot date.

345
00:26:19,655 --> 00:26:21,870
I'm sorry. It's none of my business.

346
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,480
I should just learn to shut up.

347
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,005
We have known each other
since childhood,

348
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:31,287
but only recently kindled
more than a friendship.

349
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,369
I have not told anyone yet.

350
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,480
I'm so sorry.

351
00:26:46,817 --> 00:26:49,017
We need more water.

352
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,166
We have to leave.

353
00:27:15,738 --> 00:27:17,907
- What happened?
- Can you walk?

354
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,324
I don't even think he can stand.

355
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:22,347
Very soon, many more
Bola Kai will be here.

356
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,477
It's all right.

357
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:24,930
I can walk.

358
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:32,571
Mr. Freeze, no, King Tut.

359
00:27:32,722 --> 00:27:34,551
Wrong on both.
Otto Preminger was Mr. Freeze.

360
00:27:34,674 --> 00:27:36,341
Victor Buono was King Tut.

361
00:27:36,464 --> 00:27:39,060
- Vincent Price was Egghead.
- Egghead, right.

362
00:27:39,256 --> 00:27:40,556
Okay, so, Cliff Robertson?

363
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:42,668
Oh, I know this one.
Played the cowboy, right?

364
00:27:42,805 --> 00:27:45,332
Hey. Teyla and Keller get back?

365
00:27:46,092 --> 00:27:48,130
- I haven't heard from them yet.
- They're late.

366
00:27:48,573 --> 00:27:50,635
- That doesn't sound like Teyla.
- No, it doesn't.

367
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,493
Well, she had that big feast last night.

368
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:55,050
Maybe she did too much celebrating,
and needs to sleep it off.

369
00:27:55,987 --> 00:27:57,600
Yeah, that sounds like Teyla.

370
00:27:58,106 --> 00:27:59,459
Let's give her a call.

371
00:28:01,858 --> 00:28:03,415
- Shame.
- What is?

372
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:05,394
Cliff Robertson.
The villain he played, Shame.

373
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,856
Very good. Shelley Winters.

374
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:09,231
What the hell are you talking about?

375
00:28:12,415 --> 00:28:13,527
I need to rest.

376
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,550
He is slowing us down,

377
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,952
and he is making
your ankle injury worse.

378
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:32,192
Well, if we leave him behind,
the Bola Kai are going to capture him.

379
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:35,096
If we continue this way,
we will all be captured.

380
00:28:40,942 --> 00:28:41,949
Look,

381
00:28:42,686 --> 00:28:44,328
I'm the first to admit

382
00:28:44,546 --> 00:28:47,389
I'm not very good at certain things.

383
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:49,534
I'm not athletic,

384
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,441
I can't cook,

385
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,194
and you don't even want to hear me
try to play the piano,

386
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:57,692
but I do think I'm a pretty good
judge of character,

387
00:28:57,938 --> 00:28:59,263
and I know that you

388
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,628
would never sacrifice an innocent man,

389
00:29:01,956 --> 00:29:03,912
not even if he was a complete stranger,

390
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:05,865
to save yourself,

391
00:29:06,835 --> 00:29:10,627
which means the only reason you would
even suggest it would be because of me.

392
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:12,033
I brought you here.

393
00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:14,918
This is my responsibility.
If anything should happen to you...

394
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,503
I signed up for this,

395
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,635
all right? All of it.

396
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:21,805
I may not have had any idea
what I was getting into,

397
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:22,824
but...

398
00:29:22,947 --> 00:29:25,999
that makes me no different
from anybody else on Atlantis.

399
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:30,724
- I'm glad you feel that way...
- Oh, yeah, I know, I know.

400
00:29:30,861 --> 00:29:33,982
Before this is all over, I'm gonna have
to find all the courage I can muster.

401
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:36,696
<i>Actually...</i>

402
00:29:37,272 --> 00:29:39,607
You're going to need
to find it right now.

403
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:41,946
Oh, God.

404
00:30:09,414 --> 00:30:10,185
Teyla!

405
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:25,836
<i>Teyla? This is Atlantis, do you read?</i>

406
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:30,791
Teyla, this is Sheppard,

407
00:30:31,242 --> 00:30:32,295
come in.

408
00:30:32,993 --> 00:30:34,593
She wouldn't turn off her radio.

409
00:30:34,864 --> 00:30:35,998
No, she wouldn't.

410
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:39,251
Calling anyone
in the Athosian settlement,

411
00:30:39,388 --> 00:30:41,417
this is Lieutenant Colonel
John Sheppard.

412
00:30:41,547 --> 00:30:42,695
Do you copy?

413
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:47,383
<i>Teyla, this is Sheppard,
please respond...</i>

414
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:02,821
What are they going to do to us?

415
00:31:05,262 --> 00:31:07,421
They will try to extricate information.

416
00:31:08,404 --> 00:31:09,786
We must tell them nothing.

417
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:15,834
Dr. Keller, the lives of everyone
in Atlantis are at stake.

418
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:18,934
I know.

419
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:23,485
I'm sorry.

420
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:29,311
Where are you from?

421
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:31,056
What?

422
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:32,628
Your home?

423
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:37,425
Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.

424
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:40,485
A little town.

425
00:31:41,976 --> 00:31:43,411
Do you have any family?

426
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:45,147
Just my dad.

427
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:47,690
My mom died a few years back.

428
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:48,825
I'm sorry.

429
00:31:50,057 --> 00:31:51,703
You must miss him.

430
00:31:53,498 --> 00:31:55,151
I'm all he's got left.

431
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:59,033
Then you must do
everything you can to survive,

432
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:01,534
<i>to return home.</i>

433
00:32:02,095 --> 00:32:03,188
You must...

434
00:32:07,164 --> 00:32:09,054
You will survive.

435
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,558
You will return home.
Do you understand?

436
00:32:31,246 --> 00:32:32,537
Who are you?

437
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,539
I am Athosian.

438
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:43,505
I don't believe you.

439
00:32:44,368 --> 00:32:46,508
I do not care what you believe.

440
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:54,142
The longer you are silent,
the worse it will be for you.

441
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,020
<i>I told you.</i>

442
00:32:57,325 --> 00:32:59,124
We are Athosian,

443
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,107
and you will suffer for what
you have done to our people.

444
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:04,025
What we've done?

445
00:33:04,188 --> 00:33:06,820
You murdered them, an entire village.

446
00:33:07,077 --> 00:33:09,236
That village was deserted
when we arrived.

447
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,142
Deserted because
it was culled by the Wraith,

448
00:33:12,262 --> 00:33:14,369
Wraith who were brought here by you.

449
00:33:14,662 --> 00:33:16,286
Do you know who we are?

450
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,647
You are Bola Kai.

451
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,168
Then you know we are hunted
by the Wraith like everyone else.

452
00:33:20,627 --> 00:33:23,545
Unless you are Wraith worshipers.

453
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,674
Get her out of here!

454
00:33:37,995 --> 00:33:39,771
<i>I'm willing to spare her life</i>

455
00:33:40,964 --> 00:33:42,276
if you tell me

456
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,258
who you are.

457
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,170
Did you tell them anything?

458
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:07,506
They said they would kill you.

459
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:09,424
You told them about Atlantis?

460
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:11,028
No.

461
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:12,982
I...

462
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:15,059
I gave them a Gate address,

463
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:17,432
an uninhabited planet,
just to throw them off,

464
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:19,601
<i>buy us more time,</i>

465
00:34:19,763 --> 00:34:20,885
like you said.

466
00:34:26,462 --> 00:34:28,486
I don't think they're Wraith worshipers.

467
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:31,191
That guy in there,

468
00:34:31,943 --> 00:34:34,784
he seemed surprised when you accused him
of working with the Wraith.

469
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:37,327
<i>Why would he deny it if it was true?</i>

470
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:40,780
I would think that would provide
an even more effective threat

471
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:42,332
to get us to talk.

472
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,607
So they just happened to arrive here

473
00:34:44,743 --> 00:34:46,957
moments after the settlement was culled?

474
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:48,798
I find that a coincidence.

475
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,593
Something just came through the portal,
a flying ship of some kind, but

476
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:57,766
it disappeared before
we could do anything.

477
00:34:57,889 --> 00:34:59,172
You two, watch them.

478
00:35:00,371 --> 00:35:02,958
The rest of you,
get your weapons and come with me!

479
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,335
Not much longer.

480
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:13,523
Those guys guarding the Gates
certainly don't look Athosian.

481
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:15,327
- They're Bola Kai.
- What?

482
00:35:15,477 --> 00:35:17,049
It a warrior tribe. Ruthless.

483
00:35:17,185 --> 00:35:20,147
They like picking fights,
especially with tribes who are peaceful.

484
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,159
Great, just what we need,
another bad guy.

485
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:24,605
Don't worry. They're primitive.
We can handle them.

486
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:26,157
Define primitive.

487
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,638
- Clubs and arrows.
- Hey, arrows can hurt.

488
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,174
Only if you're stupid enough
to get hit in the ass with one.

489
00:35:31,723 --> 00:35:33,468
- Life signs?
<i>- All over the place.</i>

490
00:35:33,811 --> 00:35:36,551
Mostly in the woods.
It's hard to get a visual from up here.

491
00:35:36,674 --> 00:35:39,706
All right, we'll have to go
on foot then. Gear up, boys.

492
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,514
If these guys want a fight,

493
00:35:41,637 --> 00:35:43,072
happy to give it to 'em.

494
00:35:57,971 --> 00:35:58,910
John?

495
00:36:02,438 --> 00:36:03,288
Nabel...

496
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:05,322
Move back.

497
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,589
Where did you get the gun?

498
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:15,670
The Athosians were not the only ones
with a hidden cache of weapons.

499
00:36:16,312 --> 00:36:18,805
The Bola Kai captured me
before I could get to mine.

500
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:25,575
We need to get moving.

501
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:27,546
They no doubt heard the gunfire.

502
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:41,419
They coming?

503
00:36:41,556 --> 00:36:42,936
It does not appear so.

504
00:36:43,073 --> 00:36:44,754
I believe it is safe to rest.

505
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:50,503
Thank you for coming for us.

506
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:52,244
You saved my life.

507
00:36:52,532 --> 00:36:54,130
I figured I'd return the favor.

508
00:36:55,008 --> 00:36:56,361
I thought you were dead.

509
00:36:56,497 --> 00:36:57,851
Well, I can't die yet.

510
00:36:58,097 --> 00:37:01,012
I have far too many questions
I need answers to first.

511
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:06,309
We can start with you giving me
the Gate address to Atlantis.

512
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,512
I've got lifesigns, there,

513
00:37:12,675 --> 00:37:13,647
there,

514
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:15,611
there, and there.

515
00:37:15,772 --> 00:37:18,575
- That really narrows it down.
- That way.

516
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,969
Really? Why?

517
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,242
No reason.

518
00:37:21,596 --> 00:37:22,909
Good enough for me.

519
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:24,726
Let's go.

520
00:37:27,065 --> 00:37:28,330
Why are you doing this?

521
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:30,878
Just give me the address
and I'll let you go.

522
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,085
I promise.

523
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:36,338
I see you're not
as badly wounded as I thought.

524
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,611
Oh, it's bad.

525
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:40,017
I just have a high tolerance for pain.

526
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:42,430
The address, and I'll let you go,

527
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,913
<i>both of you.</i>

528
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:46,099
You're lying.

529
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,853
<i>You're not Genii, are you?</i>

530
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:51,430
We have an understanding with them.

531
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:54,984
They wouldn't need to resort
to these tactics in order to contact us.

532
00:37:56,581 --> 00:37:58,577
All right, so that part wasn't true,

533
00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:00,655
but I was captured by the Bola Kai.

534
00:38:01,857 --> 00:38:03,159
You're the Wraith worshiper.

535
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:08,039
You're the one responsible
for the death of the Athosians.

536
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:12,834
Unless I lied about that as well.

537
00:38:12,996 --> 00:38:14,879
What do you mean, they're not dead?

538
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,875
Give me the Gate address,

539
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:18,965
and I'll gladly tell you everything.

540
00:38:43,108 --> 00:38:45,326
- Don't move.
- Untie me.

541
00:38:48,983 --> 00:38:51,581
- Get out of the way.
- Give me the gun.

542
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,918
I'll shoot you.

543
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,295
No, you won't. You don't have it in you.

544
00:38:57,938 --> 00:38:59,090
<i>You're a doctor,</i>

545
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,849
a healer...

546
00:39:01,928 --> 00:39:02,842
Not a killer.

547
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,467
You're right, I am a healer,

548
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:09,432
but first I need something to heal.

549
00:39:25,568 --> 00:39:26,866
What happened to my people?

550
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:30,741
What happened to them?

551
00:39:59,826 --> 00:40:01,736
- You okay?
- Yeah.

552
00:40:01,981 --> 00:40:03,089
What happened?

553
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:05,488
My people, they are gone.

554
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,881
What are you talking about?
All of them? What happened?

555
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:11,881
Nabel!

556
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:17,793
- Where did he go?
- I didn't see.

557
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,813
Who are you talking about?

558
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:21,603
Not arrows!

559
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,666
We need to move! Come on, let's go!

560
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,224
Well...

561
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,315
How you feeling?

562
00:40:46,998 --> 00:40:48,064
I am fine.

563
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,783
Dr. Keller insists I remain in bed.

564
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,752
She fears I have a concussion.

565
00:40:53,011 --> 00:40:54,651
Well, you should listen to her.

566
00:40:56,045 --> 00:40:57,890
We just got back from New Athos.

567
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,282
The Bola Kai are all gone.

568
00:41:00,555 --> 00:41:02,017
Must have scared them off.

569
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:04,518
Rodney's got teams going out there

570
00:41:04,655 --> 00:41:06,716
to collect clues about
what happened to your people.

571
00:41:07,347 --> 00:41:08,968
Did you find Nabel?

572
00:41:09,857 --> 00:41:12,527
Searched the entire planet,
no life signs.

573
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,426
He must have escaped through the Gate.

574
00:41:14,563 --> 00:41:16,684
Or, more likely,
he's lying dead somewhere.

575
00:41:17,748 --> 00:41:20,168
He knows what happened to my people.

576
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,792
I will find them.

577
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,745
I know you will,
and we're going to help you,

578
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,328
but you've got to rest
and get your strength back.

579
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:29,597
Whoever did this will pay.

580
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,016
I will make certain of it.

581
00:41:36,131 --> 00:41:37,921
Hey, Doc, how you feeling?

582
00:41:38,386 --> 00:41:41,141
Oh, it's just a sprain. I'll be fine.

583
00:41:42,105 --> 00:41:45,500
Why is it that you are allowed
to resume working, and I am not?

584
00:41:45,718 --> 00:41:48,384
Because I didn't take
half the beating you did.

585
00:41:48,664 --> 00:41:50,997
- I have suffered worse.
- Yeah, well, I believe you,

586
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:54,031
but you're on my turf now,
so you have to listen to me.

587
00:41:54,675 --> 00:41:56,326
I'll check in on you later.

588
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,056
So...

589
00:42:01,668 --> 00:42:04,732
I got permission to go home
for a few days of R&R.

590
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,777
God bless that
intergalactic gate bridge, huh?

591
00:42:08,921 --> 00:42:10,096
Anyway...

592
00:42:11,723 --> 00:42:13,409
I get to see my dad...

593
00:42:15,194 --> 00:42:17,370
And I have you to thank for that.

594
00:42:22,548 --> 00:42:24,627
How long must I stay here?

595
00:42:25,814 --> 00:42:27,755
About another day or so.

596
00:42:28,808 --> 00:42:29,757
I told you,

597
00:42:29,919 --> 00:42:31,153
I feel fine.

598
00:42:31,304 --> 00:42:32,927
I do not have a concussion.

599
00:42:33,272 --> 00:42:34,220
You're right.

600
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,389
You don't.

601
00:42:37,236 --> 00:42:40,682
Teyla, I've looked over
your test results.

602
00:42:43,284 --> 00:42:44,929
There's something we need to talk about.
