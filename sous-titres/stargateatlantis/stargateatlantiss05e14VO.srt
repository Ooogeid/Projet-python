1
00:00:01,276 --> 00:00:02,820
You wanted to see me?

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,593
May I ask why
you have not filed a single

3
00:00:06,753 --> 00:00:09,957
mission report
since I assumed command of this base?

4
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:12,588
'Cause I haven't given you any?

5
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,867
As you know,
one of the changes I made around here

6
00:00:14,987 --> 00:00:18,571
is to require every team member
to file mission reports,

7
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:21,358
as opposed to only team leaders
and science officers.

8
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:24,211
Really. I didn't know that.

9
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:26,573
I announced it my fourth day here,

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,637
at an away-team orientation meeting

11
00:00:28,757 --> 00:00:31,534
- detailing changes to mission protocol.
- Was I there?

12
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:34,037
Yes. It was mandatory.

13
00:00:34,397 --> 00:00:36,623
- Because I don't remember...
- I saw you there.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,142
It's kind of hard to miss you.

15
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:42,196
Look, my point is

16
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:44,497
I want you to file a report

17
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:46,216
every mission.

18
00:00:47,044 --> 00:00:48,676
I'm not good at writing.

19
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:52,068
I figured you might say that.
Use this.

20
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:55,545
It's a digital voice recorder.
Speak into it,

21
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:57,393
we'll plug it in, and your report

22
00:00:57,553 --> 00:00:59,896
will be automatically transcribed
and filed with the others.

23
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:03,436
I'm not good at talking, either.

24
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:10,114
I'm sorry.
Too fast for you, buddy boy?

25
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,035
Nursing home just called, Rodney.
They want their scooter back.

26
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:17,747
Scooter? That is a tri-cell li-po pack
under my hood, son.

27
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:22,167
Sorry. My bad.

28
00:01:26,923 --> 00:01:29,425
- I will trample you.
- Well, don't trip on your skirt.

29
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:33,429
You okay?

30
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:35,222
I could have dropped him!

31
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:38,726
- We didn't know anyone was around.
- What are you doing down here anyway?

32
00:01:38,886 --> 00:01:42,230
Trying to get Torren to sleep.
Walking him is the best way to calm him.

33
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:44,022
He's colicky?

34
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,788
Dr. Keller says
it's a phase that will pass.

35
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:48,966
I was a colicky baby too.
Just do what my mom did,

36
00:01:49,086 --> 00:01:52,189
which was let me cry myself to sleep.
I'm no worse for it.

37
00:01:53,297 --> 00:01:55,644
Anyway...
we usually take turns walking him,

38
00:01:55,764 --> 00:01:57,912
but Kanaan is away
visiting our people for a few days.

39
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:02,292
I'd help you out, but it looks like
you've got everything taken care of.

40
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:05,475
Yes. Now all I have to do
is get him back to my quarters

41
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:06,977
without waking him...

42
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:09,674
Or being run over.

43
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:11,759
We're done here.

44
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,594
We're just, you know, finishing up.

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,762
- 'Night.
- 'Night. Good one.

46
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:19,934
Go, go, go!

47
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:45,735
I must have put too much strain
on the motor.

48
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:47,759
Shaft needs a bushing lube.

49
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,841
What?

50
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:53,810
What's that about?

51
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,126
Beats me.

52
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,235
Come in.

53
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:00,756
Control room, it's Dr. McKay.

54
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:03,778
We just lost power in the east pier.
What's going on?

55
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:17,192
That's strange.

56
00:03:17,758 --> 00:03:19,475
Lights are out
except the control room.

57
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:20,978
Why is that?

58
00:03:21,488 --> 00:03:23,581
This is Dr. Rodney McKay,
calling the control room.

59
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:25,005
Please respond.

60
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:30,002
Something's definitely not right.

64
00:03:57,976 --> 00:03:59,580
Rodney, are you there?

65
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:03,450
Colonel Sheppard?

66
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:18,610
Everything's dead.
No way of knowing what's going on.

67
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,970
All right.
Rivers. Fan out,

68
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:23,743
find as many marines as you can,
work your way up to the central tower.

69
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,685
If you run into Woolsey, let me know.
No communications. We're on walkies.

70
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,147
- What's going on?
- You don't know either?

71
00:04:30,307 --> 00:04:32,456
I'm going to the control tower.
I tried to radio you.

72
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:34,534
Power's out
except for the central tower. Here.

73
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:36,987
Go to the main power room.
See if you can reboot the system

74
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:39,148
- from there.
- Okay. All right.

75
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:45,113
Hello?

76
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,394
- <i>Rodney, do you read me?</i>
- Yeah, Radek. Go ahead.

77
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:11,355
I've tried to restart power.
So far, absolutely no success.

78
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,900
- What about the ZPM?
- <i>I've checked it,</i>

79
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,023
<i>as well as the naquadah generator.</i>

80
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:17,644
<i>Neither are online.</i>

81
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:20,464
<i>Someone must have disabled them
from the control room.</i>

82
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:22,700
No,
they wouldn't have any power up either.

83
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,949
Not unless they're using
an external power source.

84
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:28,410
Okay, listen to me.
I want you to do exactly the same thing.

85
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,207
Initiate a temporary patch using

86
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:33,294
an external power source...
One of the auxiliary battery units.

87
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:36,046
Yes, but that won't be enough
to power the entire City.

88
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:39,058
Just get me enough juice
to access the mainframe.

89
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:40,718
We can figure out what's going on.

90
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:42,803
All right.
Whereabouts are you right now?

91
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:44,388
Level 36?

92
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:45,347
35.

93
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:47,283
Great. 35. Perfect.

94
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:49,100
So just another 28 floors to go,

95
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:52,396
and that's just this stairwell.
And then we get to level 63,

96
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:54,685
got to cross over
to an ancillary stairwell,

97
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:58,113
climb another four levels...
That's just to access the Gate room...

98
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,225
See if you can route some of that power
to the transporters while you're at it.

99
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:02,884
All right, I'll try.

100
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:27,838
This door leads
to the Gate room stairwell, right?

101
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,121
Yeah.

102
00:06:30,382 --> 00:06:33,631
Well, maybe the door was already closed
when we lost power.

103
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:35,784
It was sealed on purpose
to keep people out.

104
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:38,507
What, you think someone's
infiltrated Atlantis?

105
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:41,235
Talk to me.

106
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:44,907
I've initiated a temporary patch.
I was able to route power to your lab.

107
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:48,657
- Well, what about the transporters?
- <i>Still working on it.</i>

108
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:51,282
Yeah, well, let me know
when you've got one online.

109
00:06:51,402 --> 00:06:53,786
Go to your lab
and try to tap into the mainframe.

110
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:56,885
I'll try the other stairwells.
They're probably blocked too, but...

111
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:59,000
maybe there's another way up.

112
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:00,470
All right.

113
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:04,846
- Colonel.
- That one sealed too?

114
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,343
All the stairwell doors are.

115
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:08,405
Been trying to find a way up
to the Gate room.

116
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:09,625
So have we.

117
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:12,538
- Any idea what's going on yet?
- McKay's still working on it.

118
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:16,205
- I guess we could blow the door.
- Probably, but we're not there yet.

119
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:19,924
I need to know what we're up against
before we go storming up there.

120
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:27,532
- Any luck?
- Not much.

121
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:30,281
You're right.
Someone's taken over Atlantis.

122
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:33,555
 I'm having a hard time accessing
several of the critical systems.

123
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:35,829
And the ones that I can access
are read-only.

124
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,426
What're you...
How did you get up here so fast?

125
00:07:38,546 --> 00:07:41,755
I was able to get some
of the transporters back online again.

126
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:43,799
- What about the one on the Gate room?
- No.

127
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,760
There's a lockout code in place
on that one.

128
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:50,305
- Surveillance cameras.
- We've got closed-circuit feeds

129
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:53,274
- on the control room.
- If you're not locked out of those.

130
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:56,896
They're not critical systems.
I should be able to access them if...

131
00:07:59,026 --> 00:07:59,980
Got it.

132
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:02,886
A Puddle Jumper?

133
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:09,449
- Who is that?
- It's definitely not from Atlantis.

134
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:14,735
- Can you get Woolsey's office?
- Yeah, hang on.

135
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:19,364
Oh, my God.

136
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:32,347
Is that...?

137
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,565
Hello, Teyla.

138
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:48,892
How did you get here?

139
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,349
The ship I borrowed
from your people.

140
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:56,497
It has provided me with a wealth
of information and technology...

141
00:08:56,762 --> 00:08:59,040
And the key
to infiltrating this base.

142
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,886
Use this.

143
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,336
It's a digital voice recorder.

144
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:05,585
Speak into it, we'll plug it in,
and your report

145
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:08,049
will be automatically transcribed
and filed with the others.

146
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:10,879
I'm not good at talking, either.

147
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,875
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

148
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:22,380
- Is the shield raised?
- Yes, Sir.

149
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:25,330
Major Nelson's IDC.

150
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:27,285
They're early.

151
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,588
Not due back until tomorrow.

152
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,198
All right, let them in.

153
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:44,586
It's not going up to the Jumper bay.
What's wrong?

154
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,713
Major Nelson, what's your status?

155
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:53,923
What is that?

156
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:57,217
Get everybody out of here.

157
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,579
Get 'em out now!

158
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:34,677
Closing all immediate access doors.

159
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:46,639
- I've activated the Portal's shield.
- Good.

160
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:49,539
What about
the external power interface?

161
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:50,948
We're connected.

162
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,572
The control room level is now
drawing power directly from the ship.

163
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:57,167
- Is the stun field holding?
- Yes.

164
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:59,511
Two levels above and below us
are protected.

165
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:01,333
Now we can get to work.

166
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,914
Get to work on what?

167
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,466
Forgive me.

168
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:09,504
I forgot to congratulate you.

169
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:13,854
What's his name?

170
00:11:18,403 --> 00:11:19,404
No matter.

171
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:23,543
We don't have much time,
I'm afraid.

172
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:27,492
My hybrids are preparing to activate
Atlantis' self-destruct device.

173
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:29,312
As soon as they do that,

174
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,402
- we will leave.
- You're going to destroy Atlantis?

175
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,785
A punishment richly deserved.

176
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:38,410
Not that I expect you
to agree with me.

177
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,822
But don't worry.

178
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,164
Your baby will be safe.

179
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:44,080
You are not taking my son.

180
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:46,874
Yes, Teyla. I am.

181
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:51,281
You know how important
your child is to me.

182
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:55,123
His father and you have given him
a powerful gift that I will utilize

183
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:58,348
to exert greater control
over my legion of hybrids.

184
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,414
He is the key
to increasing my strength,

185
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,892
securing my reign over the galaxy.

186
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:08,954
Your "reign" is over.
You will not make it out of here alive.

187
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:11,983
- My people will make certain...
- Enough! Enough.

188
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:14,485
You think you've weakened me.

189
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:16,987
You've destroyed my facilities,

190
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:19,803
ruined much of my research,
but you cannot...

191
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:21,561
You cannot...

192
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:23,828
weaken my resolve.

193
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:26,231
Make no mistake, Teyla.

194
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:29,584
I am as strong now
as I have ever been.

195
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,105
Look around you.

196
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:36,257
I am in control of Atlantis,

197
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:41,220
the very place where your people
ended my life as I knew it.

198
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,868
It's only fitting that I return...

199
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:48,401
to extinguish this blight
from the galaxy once and for all.

200
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,345
- I thought Michael was dead.
- As did I.

201
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:58,229
- I mean, we blew up his ship, right?
- He's the one who stole our Jumper,

202
00:12:58,349 --> 00:13:00,988
used it to escape from his cruiser
before we could destroy it.

203
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:03,159
He's like a cockroach.
Every time you try

204
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:04,994
to step on him,
he just skitters away.

205
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:07,313
All right,
we need to get moving.

206
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:11,417
You and your team take this stairwell.
My team will take this stairwell.

207
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,880
We move into position.
You wait for my mark to blast the door.

208
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:15,880
We head up,
retake the Gate room.

209
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:18,381
McKay, you're with me.
Zelenka, try to figure this thing out.

210
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:19,759
Certainly.

211
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,423
We're giving Michael no quarter.
If you get a shot at him, take it.

212
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,311
Make sure he's dead.
Let's move.

213
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,346
I must speak with you.

214
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:10,296
We are still having difficulty
with the self-destruct device.

215
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:12,361
- Why?
- As I told you,

216
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:14,854
the encryption is much more complex
than we had anticipated.

217
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:17,875
We have run several integer
factorization algorithms.

218
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:19,873
Nothing has worked so far.

219
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,987
- Keep at it.
- For how long?

220
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:26,081
As long as it takes.

221
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:29,870
It is a matter of time before the others
figure out a way through our defenses.

222
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:33,332
I know. But you will have solved
the encryption problem before then.

223
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,837
We have the baby.
We don't have to remain here.

224
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,132
We are not leaving
until that device is armed.

225
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:52,173
Problems?

226
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:54,939
Nothing that can't be dealt with.

227
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:58,399
You do know Colonel Sheppard is no doubt
preparing teams to retake the Gate room.

228
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:01,860
Of course, probably moving them
into place as we speak.

229
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:04,905
Don't worry.

230
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:08,148
They're not getting in here.

231
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:21,588
Major, what's your status?

232
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:26,020
C-4 is in place, Colonel.
Ready when you are.

233
00:15:28,256 --> 00:15:29,291
Fire in the hole.

234
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:30,793
<i>On my mark.</i>

235
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:34,810
Three, two, one, mark.

236
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:39,634
Move!

237
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,431
We're picking up
a serious energy reading up ahead.

238
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:54,392
What is it?

239
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:57,241
I don't know,
but we should stop until I do.

240
00:15:59,237 --> 00:16:00,909
Major Lorne, hold up.

241
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:08,635
Colonel Sheppard,
Major Lorne is down.

242
00:16:10,974 --> 00:16:12,661
- What happened?
- I don't know.

243
00:16:12,781 --> 00:16:15,150
I think he hit
some kind of force field.

244
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:18,478
- He's alive, but unconscious.
- <i>Get him out of there and fall back.</i>

245
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:21,189
Looks like he's got himself
a force field.

246
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:23,525
He's nothing
if not annoyingly industrious.

247
00:16:24,036 --> 00:16:25,777
- What do we do?
- We disable it.

248
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,489
- How?
- We... we... good question.

249
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:35,665
I've been examining
the energy reading we picked up,

250
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:38,115
and it appears
that Michael has somehow managed

251
00:16:38,235 --> 00:16:40,410
to modify the Wraith
stun-pulse technology

252
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,840
and integrate it with the Puddle Jumper
cloaking mechanism...

253
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,797
- Creating a kind of "stun-bubble"...
- No, a force field

254
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:48,126
around the control room
and the Gate room.

255
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:50,153
While it's in place,
we're not getting in there.

256
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:53,513
I know that. What you haven't told me
is how we're gonna turn it off.

257
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:56,280
Because we haven't figured that out yet.
It's gonna be very tricky.

258
00:16:56,469 --> 00:16:58,969
Michael is using the Puddle Jumper
as an external power source,

259
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:02,688
for the control room and the Gate room,
also to power the stun-bubble...

260
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:05,296
- Enough with the "stun-bubble".
- That's an accurate description...

261
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,777
- No, it's a stupid description...
- Guys, guys...

262
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:10,238
Look, the point is
that if we wanna disable the stun...

263
00:17:11,502 --> 00:17:14,781
the force field, then we first need
to disable the power from the Jumper.

264
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,621
Or we figure out a way to override
the mainframe lockouts Michael has.

265
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,207
- All right, how's that going?
- It's not.

266
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:21,333
Not yet.

267
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:24,669
Keep working on it.
I'm gonna check on Lorne.

268
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:39,451
What happened?

269
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:41,411
That Puddle Jumper
that came through...

270
00:17:41,531 --> 00:17:43,980
it sent out some kind of stun wave,
knocked everybody out.

271
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:48,076
- All of Atlantis?
- I don't know.

272
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:49,208
Probably.

273
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:57,437
Don't worry,
they'll wake up soon.

274
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,100
Everyone has a different
level of resistance.

275
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,956
Here.

276
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:02,951
- Who would do this?
- I don't know.

277
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:05,904
That's what I wanna find out.
Can you open that door?

278
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:08,338
- I think so.
- Good. Do it.

279
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,650
Still nothing.

280
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:36,741
There was a time
you understood me, Teyla.

281
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,481
When your people brought me here,
gave me the retrovirus

282
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:42,163
that turned me into a human,

283
00:18:43,024 --> 00:18:45,559
you alone showed me compassion.

284
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:48,795
You were the voice of conscience.

285
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:56,029
I've given this
a great deal of thought. I've...

286
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,308
I'm willing to return the favor.

287
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:05,761
I would very much like
for you to come with me.

288
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:11,317
You can care for your child,
and I will care for the both of you.

289
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:13,903
I would rather die.

290
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,226
I promise...

291
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:23,345
I will not harm either of you.

292
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:24,455
Teyla...

293
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,212
- You have to believe me.
- I can not trust the word of a murderer.

294
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,214
Why can't you understand?

295
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:39,014
I have become what I am
out of necessity,

296
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:40,763
the need to survive!

297
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:42,932
You became what you are
out of vengeance.

298
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:44,836
Do you not punish criminals
in your world?

299
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:48,062
- Are they not brought to justice?
- Is this justice to you?

300
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,592
Killing hundreds of thousands
of innocent people across this galaxy?

301
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:52,904
They would not be dead

302
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:55,828
had you not made me the subject
of your vicious experiment!

303
00:19:55,948 --> 00:19:57,989
Their blood is on your hands!

304
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:09,201
It's your choice. You can come with me
and live, or remain here and die.

305
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:11,519
Either way, I'm taking your child.

306
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:22,310
We need to blow up the Jumper.

307
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:27,304
If we blow it up, we cut the power
and disable the force field, right?

308
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:31,339
Great plan... I'm not entirely clear on
how you intend on doing the blowing up.

309
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:33,298
- Fire a drone at it.
- We can't.

310
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:36,903
The Chair room requires more power than
the auxiliary batteries can provide.

311
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:39,632
I was barely able to bring
enough power into this lab, let alone

312
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:42,694
- the transporters I could bring online.
- Then, we'll take a Jumper.

313
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:44,971
Again, I come back
to my question of how?

314
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:48,039
- No way of getting to the Jumper bay.
- We take one from the underwater bay.

315
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,873
- Fly it up to the tower,
- fire a drone through the window,

316
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:52,880
and take out Michael's Jumper.

317
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:55,410
What?

318
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,966
No, no, no, that's a good plan,
except I see one small problem...

319
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:02,220
which is that the underwater Jumper bay
only has a couple of Jumpers in it.

320
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:05,180
- Well, we only need one.
- Yes, well, the thing is...

321
00:21:05,343 --> 00:21:08,785
Both were severely damaged in the flood.
Neither of them is able to fly.

322
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:11,312
That was two years ago, Radek.
McKay already fixed them.

323
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:16,053
- You've gotta be kidding me...
- It was the next thing on my list.

324
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:19,320
- You said you were gonna fix them.
- I was getting to it, I swear.

325
00:21:19,524 --> 00:21:20,738
And you had two years!

326
00:21:21,556 --> 00:21:22,410
I was busy!

327
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,658
Perhaps we should go
and see if we can fix one of them.

328
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:26,556
That's a good idea,

329
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:29,035
but I want you stay here
to try to override Michael's lockouts.

330
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,910
Why don't I stay here and work on that?
Zelenka can go with you to the bay.

331
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,459
Because I want you to come
with me and fix those Jumpers

332
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:36,658
like you said you were gonna do
two years ago.

333
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:39,508
- Let's go.
- Please tell me there's a transporter.

334
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:43,033
Well, there's no one by the Jumper bay,
but there's one two levels down.

335
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:44,227
That'll do.

336
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,890
Nice.

337
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:19,812
You can fight.

338
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:22,548
Five years of kick-boxing.

339
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:25,161
That's good to know.

340
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:26,569
What happened?

341
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,300
It's Michael and his hybrids.
I counted three of 'em.

342
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,301
I'm not sure how many more there are.
They all had to fit in that Jumper.

343
00:23:15,421 --> 00:23:17,924
Unless more came through
on foot afterward.

344
00:23:18,044 --> 00:23:19,371
What do we do?

345
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:22,981
Try to get to the armory,
come back and retake the Gate room.

346
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,464
Sounds like a plan.
You two, come with us.

347
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:27,666
Banks, stay here with them,
keep everyone calm.

348
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:31,160
And if any more hybrids show up,
just do what you did earlier.

349
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:40,591
... speak with you again.
It's urgent.

350
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:41,918
Stay with him.

351
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:49,008
What is it?

352
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,294
We were finally able
to decipher the encryption

353
00:23:51,414 --> 00:23:53,713
on the self-destruct device.

354
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,728
Good.

355
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,455
Prepare the ship to leave.

356
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:59,984
We'll arm the self-destruct,
and switch the power back

357
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:02,129
to Atlantis' systems
a split-second before we leave.

358
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,836
The timing of the switch
must be precise.

359
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:07,947
I don't want to give them
any opportunity to disarm the device.

360
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,018
I'll make the calculations.

361
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:16,482
Change of plans.
We're not going to the armory.

362
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:19,500
- Why? What happened?
- They armed the self-destruct.

363
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:22,690
Mr. Woolsey, would you please
head back to the others?

364
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:41,688
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla.
Can you hear me?

365
00:24:42,044 --> 00:24:44,066
John, this is Teyla.
Please respond.

366
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:03,252
Colonel Shep...
Colonel Sheppard.

367
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:05,911
Ronon is in the control room.
He's fighting with Michael!

368
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:09,079
We're almost at the Jumper bay.
Keep us posted.

369
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:23,108
Teyla, run!

370
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:35,683
Teyla!

371
00:25:36,108 --> 00:25:37,425
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

372
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:40,581
But Ronon needs our help. We need
to get back up to the control room.

373
00:26:05,703 --> 00:26:08,525
Radek? Tell us
what's going on up there.

374
00:26:08,954 --> 00:26:10,666
I... I can't tell.
Ronon is down.

375
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,821
He might just be unconscious.

376
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,927
Tell me when he comes to.

377
00:26:15,427 --> 00:26:16,517
What have we got?

378
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:18,600
It's like I said...
Both of the Jumpers are toast.

379
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,079
This one's got a whack of problems,
starting with zero power.

380
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,877
- You said the other Jumper's got power.
- Yeah, but not much else.

381
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:26,771
- Drive pods won't extend, no drones...
- This one's got drones.

382
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:29,904
So if we bring power over to this,
we can get drive pods working, right?

383
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:33,216
I harvest parts from the Jumpers, cobble
together a fix so one of them will work?

384
00:26:33,453 --> 00:26:34,926
- Is it possible?
- Doubtful.

385
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:36,927
- But maybe...
- It's a long shot at best.

386
00:26:37,202 --> 00:26:39,598
Perfect. Get to it.
What do you need, 15 minutes?

387
00:26:44,322 --> 00:26:45,937
Great, just great.

388
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:53,398
Must've locked out the transporters.

389
00:26:53,518 --> 00:26:56,193
- We need to get to the control room.
- Too dangerous. Not without weapons.

390
00:26:56,313 --> 00:26:59,130
- Where's the nearest stairwell?
- Around the corner. This way.

391
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:01,083
Let me lead.

392
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:48,811
Okay, give 'er.

393
00:28:50,915 --> 00:28:54,185
- Drive pods are go.
- All right, we're getting somewhere.

394
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:56,798
I got juice,
I got life support, I got...

395
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:58,862
- Come on!
- What?

396
00:28:59,143 --> 00:29:00,655
The weapons won't come online.

397
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:03,241
- Why not?
- I don't know.

398
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:05,451
Well, figure it out.
We need those drones.

399
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:13,619
Where is she?

400
00:29:15,163 --> 00:29:17,677
We don't know.
We searched everywhere.

401
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,284
Are you telling me
she just disappeared?

402
00:29:20,516 --> 00:29:23,838
I'm saying that we searched every room
and corridor within the stun field.

403
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:26,011
We couldn't find her anywhere.

404
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,825
She knows this City well.

405
00:29:28,577 --> 00:29:29,947
She's hiding somewhere.

406
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:31,436
She's toying with me!

407
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:37,084
- We'll keep looking.
- No. I'll handle this.

408
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:42,407
- What are you going to do?
- Flush her out.

409
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,257
That's Atlantis' self-destruct.
Michael's gonna blow up the City.

410
00:29:51,377 --> 00:29:53,708
- How much time do we have?
- He set it for 10 minutes.

411
00:29:53,928 --> 00:29:55,710
How much time
before you get those drones?

412
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,254
If I can get them working at all,
a lot more than 10 minutes!

413
00:29:59,594 --> 00:30:01,591
- All right, forget about it.
- What are you doing?

414
00:30:01,945 --> 00:30:03,885
Gonna fly the Jumper
and crash it into the Tower.

415
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:06,763
- Crash it?
- It's our best chance.

416
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:08,306
And yourself.

417
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:11,184
I have crashed Jumpers
into the Tower before.

418
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:12,818
Not like this you haven't.

419
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:15,229
In addition to the weapons,
the inertial dampeners are out.

420
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:18,691
You'll need to impact Michael's Jumper
with enough force to do some damage,

421
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:21,153
which means a lot of speed
when you hit that tower.

422
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:23,196
Look, this is a suicide mission.

423
00:30:30,735 --> 00:30:32,443
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

424
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:37,201
<i>That alarm, if you're not aware,
is Atlantis' self-destruct device.</i>

425
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,213
<i>I've armed it,
set it for 10 minutes.</i>

426
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:44,634
<i>That is the amount of time you have
to consider the offer I'm about to make.</i>

427
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:48,124
If you will surrender yourself
and your child to me,

428
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:49,943
I'll disarm the device,

429
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:52,218
sparing the lives
of everyone on this base.

430
00:30:52,338 --> 00:30:53,338
If not...

431
00:30:53,912 --> 00:30:55,394
You, your baby,

432
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:57,397
<i>and everyone else</i>

433
00:30:58,026 --> 00:30:59,215
<i>will die.</i>

434
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:08,172
Okay, you're good to go.

435
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:11,644
Make sure that strike team is ready
to move as soon as that field drops.

436
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:14,163
Don't accelerate too fast
coming out of the Jumper bay.

437
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:17,892
If you hit the gas too hard,
you're gonna flatten like a pancake.

438
00:31:18,012 --> 00:31:19,168
Right.

439
00:31:21,843 --> 00:31:22,895
What?

440
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:26,138
Well, it's just...
What you're about to do is...

441
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:29,723
Yeah. It's not like it's the first time.
How many suicide missions have I flown?

442
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:32,515
- I don't know. I lost count.
- Well, there you go.

443
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:34,996
All right, well, you know...

444
00:31:36,076 --> 00:31:37,675
Here's to many more.

445
00:31:44,884 --> 00:31:46,377
Yeah, Radek. Go ahead.

446
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:48,959
<i>I've figured out how to override
some of Michael's lockout codes.</i>

447
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,305
That's great.
Can you shut down the self-destruct?

448
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:53,444
No, no, that will take
a little bit more time.

449
00:31:53,564 --> 00:31:56,038
I have managed to get the access doors
to the Gate room open.

450
00:31:56,328 --> 00:32:00,084
Well, that does us absolutely no good.
The stun field is still in effect.

451
00:32:00,678 --> 00:32:02,378
The transporter
on the Gate room level?

452
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,089
No, no, I still don't have control
of that, either.

453
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:08,426
- For crying out loud...
- <i>I'm sorry, I'm doing the best I can.</i>

454
00:32:08,586 --> 00:32:10,803
Michael has placed
several highly encrypted codes...

455
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:13,681
Just... What about the Gate shield?
Can you lower it?

456
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:15,516
Yes. That I can do.

457
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:18,853
Great.
You don't have to do your <i>kamikaze</i> run.

458
00:32:20,695 --> 00:32:23,242
- Why not?
- Fly to the Tower, get in proximity,

459
00:32:23,362 --> 00:32:26,748
dial the DHD to a random planet,
we'll have Radek lower the Gate shield,

460
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:29,613
allowing the vortex to obliterate
Michael's Jumper... or most of it.

461
00:32:30,391 --> 00:32:32,113
Now, that's a good plan.

462
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:35,047
- Where are you going?
- You're gonna fly it.

463
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:37,390
That frees me up
to lead the strike team.

464
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,438
You said it... it's simple enough.
You just dial the Gate.

465
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,103
- I guess I can do that.
- Go easy on the accelerator.

466
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:46,411
Radek, get ready
to drop that shield on my mark.

467
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:49,517
Right...

468
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:54,272
We don't have much time.

469
00:32:54,392 --> 00:32:56,412
We need to leave this place.

470
00:32:57,604 --> 00:32:59,162
Time is short, Teyla.

471
00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:02,360
I don't understand...

472
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:04,690
I would think the choice
is an easy one...

473
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:07,637
<i>If nothing else,
consider your child.</i>

474
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:11,364
<i>By remaining in hiding,
you are sentencing him to die.</i>

475
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:14,095
<i>What kind of mother
would do such a thing?</i>

476
00:33:15,518 --> 00:33:17,202
<i>He has a chance to live.</i>

477
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,767
<i>Both of you do.</i>

478
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:22,515
Come with me, Teyla.

479
00:33:23,595 --> 00:33:24,688
Trust me...

480
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:27,642
I will not harm either of you.

481
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:29,758
And I will not harm Atlantis.

482
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:32,509
You have my word.

483
00:33:37,022 --> 00:33:39,202
<i>Turn off the self-destruct system.</i>

484
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,022
You want me to trust you?
Then show me you mean what you say.

485
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:49,993
<i>Turn off the self-destruct system,
and I will come with you.</i>

486
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:11,507
All right, I'm in the air...
approaching the central tower.

487
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,467
Copy that.
Zelenka, you ready?

488
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:14,968
Ready when you are.

489
00:34:17,793 --> 00:34:19,403
Michael, can you hear me?

490
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:21,936
Less than two minutes.
We need to go.

491
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:23,091
Now.

492
00:34:25,776 --> 00:34:26,870
I hear you.

493
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,094
You disappoint me.

494
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,321
So I will leave you
to the fate you have chosen.

495
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:36,670
<i>But I'm not leaving alone.</i>

496
00:34:37,298 --> 00:34:40,383
<i>You should know that I've already
collected your son's DNA...</i>

497
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:43,352
<i>Cloning him
will require additional time,</i>

498
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:45,799
<i>delaying the implementation
of my plan,</i>

499
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,559
<i>but as you well know,</i>

500
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:49,896
<i>I will not be deterred.</i>

501
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:53,924
Good-bye, Teyla.

502
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,565
What are you doing?

503
00:35:15,002 --> 00:35:16,765
Collecting one last prize.

504
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:25,956
I'm in position. Ready to dial.

505
00:35:26,783 --> 00:35:28,502
Radek, drop the shield.

506
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:35,382
The shield's down!

507
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:12,669
- <i>The stun field is neutralized!</i>
- Is the self-destruct disabled?

508
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:14,671
It shut off
when the Jumper's power was cut.

509
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,258
Good. I'm heading back.
Go ahead and reboot the City's power.

510
00:36:18,418 --> 00:36:19,634
I'm already doing it.

511
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,826
Get a medic!

512
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,332
Close the Jumper bay doors, Radek!

513
00:36:56,576 --> 00:36:57,674
Amelia...

514
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:03,011
- Will you take care of Torren for me?
- Of course.

515
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:06,073
Make sure no one leaves.

516
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:53,034
How's Dr. Keller's
most cantankerous patient?

517
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:54,552
You've gotta be kidding me.

518
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:56,906
You get released,
and I gotta stay here another day?

519
00:39:57,026 --> 00:39:59,122
Because I only fell down
a flight of stairs.

520
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:02,197
You, my friend, were hurled
from a much greater height.

521
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,809
You're lucky you suffered a concussion
and didn't break your neck.

522
00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:06,421
Nothing. I'm fine.

523
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:07,570
I know you are.

524
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:09,998
But listen to the Doctor.

525
00:40:11,296 --> 00:40:12,857
Anyway, I just wanted to drop by

526
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,546
and commend you
for your exemplary work.

527
00:40:16,271 --> 00:40:19,957
Your courage in the face of danger
continues to amaze and,

528
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,002
dare I say, inspire me.

529
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:27,381
Thanks.

530
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:29,942
Get some rest.

531
00:40:30,062 --> 00:40:32,628
And don't worry. Your team's not going
anywhere without you.

532
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:34,026
That reminds me.

533
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,435
I know Michael attacking the City
isn't really a mission,

534
00:40:40,326 --> 00:40:41,854
but I filed a report anyways.

535
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:45,588
Splendid.

536
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,318
Thank you.

537
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,708
<i>Mission report...</i>

538
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,799
<i>Michael invaded Atlantis,</i>

539
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:56,976
<i>tried to blow it up.</i>

540
00:40:57,096 --> 00:40:58,407
<i>We stopped him.</i>

541
00:40:58,913 --> 00:41:00,143
<i>End of report.</i>

542
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:08,388
Take a good long look,

543
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,563
'cause soon you're gonna see
nothing but taillights.

544
00:41:10,683 --> 00:41:12,261
Nice try, speed racer.

545
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:21,836
I'm sorry.
Sorry, we were just, you know...

546
00:41:21,956 --> 00:41:23,756
- Who's winning?
- I am.

547
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,836
Still colicky, huh?

548
00:41:25,956 --> 00:41:28,302
He was awake all day.
Refused to take a nap.

549
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:30,611
That's not surprising.
He got a full night's sleep.

550
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:34,465
Yes, it's remarkable.
He slept through the entire ordeal.

551
00:41:34,585 --> 00:41:37,868
He hasn't slept through
a whole night in... ever.

552
00:41:38,376 --> 00:41:40,996
Well, he can rest easy now,
'cause Michael's out of the picture.

553
00:41:41,316 --> 00:41:43,694
Unfortunately, there will be
somebody else to take his place.

554
00:41:43,814 --> 00:41:44,750
I am certain.

555
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:48,805
He's got super mom watching his back.
If you ask me, he's in good hands.

556
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:53,056
Torren, do you wanna watch me
kick Rodney's ass?

557
00:41:54,336 --> 00:41:57,833
You may wanna cover the child's eyes,
because this could get ugly.

558
00:41:58,546 --> 00:41:59,789
Are you ready?

559
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:01,475
One... two...
