00:00:00,432 --> 00:00:02,309
<i>Previously on</i>
Stargate Atlantis.

2
00:00:02,707 --> 00:00:04,698
You're both familiar
with the ancient named Janus.

3
00:00:04,818 --> 00:00:07,101
I have information that could lead us
to his secret lab.

4
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:12,510
- We were attacked.
- By who?

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,017
I was hoping you could tell me.

6
00:00:14,177 --> 00:00:16,727
Get the device operational
within one hour

7
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:18,062
or I will kill him.

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:19,680
Do you understand?

9
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,568
Somehow,
you've found the attero device.

10
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:25,737
What?

11
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:30,033
We're locked in.

12
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:33,993
Wait, there's a very dangerous,
serious problem with the device,

13
00:00:34,113 --> 00:00:36,665
- and we need to talk...
- if the power continues to build,

14
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:39,042
the gate will reach critical overload
and explode.

15
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:42,128
Everyone that doesn't need to be here,
get to the edge of the City.

16
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:43,965
It's not enough.

17
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:50,356
Move quickly. We have to get everyone
to the lower levels of the tower

18
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:52,869
to make sure
that everyone will be...

19
00:00:58,838 --> 00:01:01,240
Colonel Sheppard, are you all right?

20
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:05,527
- How many were up there?
- Two.

21
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:07,248
I'll go get my people.

22
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:23,430
They were right here
when I left them.

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,456
If the explosion was hot enough,

24
00:01:25,576 --> 00:01:28,425
there might not be anything left
for us to find.

25
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:35,221
Did you hear that?

26
00:01:47,627 --> 00:01:49,229
We didn't take cover.

27
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:52,568
Are you all right?

28
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:55,367
- Are you all right?
- My ears...

29
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:58,455
I think I've got a some glass
in my back.

30
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:04,346
We lost the Stargate,
we lost the control room. That's bad.

31
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,161
But we did not lose you.

32
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:07,591
That's good.

33
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:19,851
All the troops you've requested
have beamed onboard.

34
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:22,165
Have them round up the rest
of the humans and confine them

35
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:24,260
to one of the hangar bays.

36
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:27,586
Inform our Hive to wait for us here,

37
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,702
and under no circumstances
are they to activate their hyperdrive.

38
00:02:31,822 --> 00:02:33,261
Is that understood?

39
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:34,381
Yes.

40
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:36,083
Where are we going?

41
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,641
Atlantis.

42
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:45,762
Season 5 Episode 11
The Lost Tribe (v. 1.00)

43
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:48,779
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

44
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:51,424
www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

45
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:00,221
I need you to get Banks
and her team to set up

46
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:02,519
an auxiliary control room
below the damaged areas.

47
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,521
They've already begun.
How are you?

48
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:07,736
I'm alive. That's good for now.

49
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:09,651
I still do not understand
what happened.

50
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:11,569
The Gate blew up.

51
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:13,934
That much I surmised.

52
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:15,073
But why?

53
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:19,123
I don't know. Where the hell's McKay
when you need him?

54
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:28,511
All right, so the device creates
a very specific subspace "turbulence"

55
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:31,020
that makes it impossible
to operate the Wraith hyperdrive.

56
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,824
- I know.
- But there's a side effect.

57
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:35,510
- The "unforeseen" mentioned.
- It's certainly not seen here

58
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,163
- because there's no Stargate.
- What's the point, Rodney?

59
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:40,272
Although the subspace turbulence

60
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:42,443
only affects
the Wraith's hyperdrive systems,

61
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:45,930
it creates a very dangerous
type of radiation that...

62
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:49,367
messes with the basic operation
of the Stargates.

63
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:51,442
Stargates?
What, as in all of them?

64
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:53,319
All of the Stargates in Pegasus, yes.

65
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,361
And when you say: "messes with,"
you mean what?

66
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,325
Look, when dialed, power will build up
inside the Gate until it overloads.

67
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,204
So you're saying that as long
as this Janus device is running,

68
00:04:03,324 --> 00:04:05,540
every time someone dials a Gate
in the entire galaxy...

69
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,907
It'll explode.

70
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:10,003
Millions of people will die
if we don't shut that thing down.

71
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:24,310
Good timing, Mr. Woolsey.

72
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,741
Look,

73
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:33,385
I don't know what it is
you think we've done,

74
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:36,237
- but I assure you...
- Take us out of hyperspace.

75
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:38,031
We haven't arrived at Atlantis yet.

76
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:41,721
- Atlantis?
- We're within communications range.

77
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:43,828
We don't want to get too close.
Take us out.

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,762
I was hoping you'd be awake
for this.

79
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:54,199
Well, are we up and running?

80
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,494
Yes, sir. We've routed all the City's
main controls into this room.

81
00:04:57,614 --> 00:05:00,845
- At least we're not blind anymore.
- No, but we're severely crippled.

82
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:02,755
Without the Gate or the Daedalus,

83
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:06,226
we have no way of getting to M6H-987
or rescuing Rodney and Dr. Jackson.

84
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:08,486
What should we do?

85
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:11,189
5 bucks to anybody who can figure
out how to contact the Daedalus.

86
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,857
Colonel Sheppard?

87
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:14,899
You got an idea?

88
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:17,445
No, but I am being hailed
by the Daedalus on subspace.

89
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:19,351
Does that count?

90
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:24,128
Technically that's not your idea,
but good enough. Put 'em on screen.

91
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:26,997
I'll pay you later.

92
00:05:28,324 --> 00:05:30,708
- Daedalus, it's good to...
- <i>Colonel Sheppard.</i>

93
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:33,669
What the hell's going on?
Where's Caldwell?

94
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,881
<i>I'm afraid I had to relieve him
and his crew of duty.</i>

95
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:40,051
- How close are they?
- Not close enough to go by Jumper.

96
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:43,471
Don't worry, I'm more than willing
to return this ship and its crew

97
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:45,698
- to you.
- <i>In exchange for what?</i>

98
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:48,439
You've activated the attero device.

99
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:50,353
I need you to shut it down

100
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,189
<i>and give me its location
immediately.</i>

101
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:55,149
I don't know
what you're talking about.

102
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:58,027
<i>It was very clever of you,
luring me</i>

103
00:05:58,187 --> 00:06:00,029
<i>and my ship out into the open</i>

104
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:02,313
so you could see for yourself
if it worked.

105
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,575
- <i>If what worked?</i>
- I have to admit,

106
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:07,229
in a way I'm impressed.

107
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:09,789
I was there 10,000 years ago

108
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:12,754
<i>when the Ancients
first tried to use it,</i>

109
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:15,189
<i>but they didn't have
the stomach to leave it on</i>

110
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,256
<i>once they realized how many</i>

111
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:20,049
<i>of their precious Stargates
it would destroy...</i>

112
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:22,301
how many humans it would kill.

113
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:23,970
Sounds like Janus work's.

114
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:26,556
<i>Give me the location
of the attero device, and once</i>

115
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:28,850
I have destroyed it,
I will return this crew to you.

116
00:06:29,813 --> 00:06:32,520
Look, it's not what you think.
We have nothing to do with this.

117
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:34,440
<i>Every minute that goes by</i>

118
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,359
<i>without you telling me
where this device is,</i>

119
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:41,122
<i>I will kill
a member of your expedition.</i>

120
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:52,139
<i>Your time starts now.</i>

121
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:54,982
<i>Give us a second.</i>

122
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:01,069
I don't think this should count
toward the minute.

123
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,528
I mean, he didn't say no...

124
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,792
Yet.

125
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,306
What are the odds that...
What's this thing called?

126
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:09,897
Attero device.

127
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:13,603
What are the odds that this thing was
at the subspace link that Rodney opened?

128
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:15,563
M6H-987?
I'd say it's very likely.

129
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,191
It's also very likely
that's where they were taken.

130
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:20,709
It must be a weapon that Janus developed
during the Wraith war.

131
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:22,369
A weapon to blow up Stargates?

132
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:25,489
I doubt that was its original design.
Doesn't seem like an effective strategy.

133
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:28,690
So, a nasty side effect. That's probably
why they stopped production.

134
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:31,679
Whatever the aliens took from the lab
allowed them to reactivate it again.

135
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,868
Whatever it is,
Todd seems pretty keen to stop it,

136
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:36,179
enough to risk taking the Daedalus.

137
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:37,941
But we can't give him the address.

138
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:42,055
He'll destroy everything in his path,
including Rodney and Dr. Jackson.

139
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:44,509
John, we don't have a choice.

140
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:46,986
Our shield was able
to take the explosion,

141
00:07:47,106 --> 00:07:49,483
but if this is happening
on other worlds,

142
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,848
it could kill millions.

143
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,226
Put 'em back on.

144
00:07:58,229 --> 00:07:59,230
Thank God.

145
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:01,442
<i>We're not the ones behind this.</i>

146
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:03,476
<i>Very well.</i>

147
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:07,531
Wait! Wait! I said,
we're not the ones behind this,

148
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:09,617
<i>but we may have what you need.</i>

149
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,900
<i>Atlantis was attacked yesterday, by
a race we have not encountered before.</i>

150
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,858
<i>They stole a piece
of Ancient technology.</i>

151
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:19,085
<i>We believe this could be a component
to this attero device.</i>

152
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,508
We managed to track them.

153
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:23,423
You swing by here, pick me up,
I will take you there myself.

154
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,113
<i>And give you the chance
to take out my hyperdrive</i>

155
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,632
<i>with one of your drones?
I think not.</i>

156
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:30,113
Why would I do that?

157
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:32,123
You're one of the few people
in the galaxy

158
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:34,182
with a ship capable
of dealing with this problem.

159
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,317
And I intend to keep it that way.

160
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:43,167
Transmit the coordinates

161
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:45,695
or I will feed

162
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:48,216
<i>on Mr. Woolsey before your eyes!</i>

163
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:51,826
Do it.

164
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:56,806
We have it.

165
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,006
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

166
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:20,104
- You really think that's gonna work?
- You got a better idea?

167
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:22,738
We're on a space ship.

168
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:24,611
Those doors are designed
to be airtight.

169
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,953
That means something as tiny as air
can't even get through.

170
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:29,906
- How do you think you will?
- I'm a lot bigger than air.

171
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:32,450
Yeah... that's kind of my point.

172
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:36,230
See?

173
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:42,689
You okay?

174
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:45,811
- All right. Come on.
- Wait.

175
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,673
What's our plan?
Where are we going?

176
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,020
Get to an access ladder,

177
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,243
head down two floors
to the engineering rooms.

178
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:52,595
Then we cripple the ship.

179
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:54,555
You... know how to do all that?

180
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:55,932
Yeah. Don't you?

181
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,725
Not really.

182
00:09:58,156 --> 00:09:59,463
Watch and learn.

183
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:06,294
Hyperspace window opening.

184
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,857
Think Todd changed his mind?

185
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:10,736
He might have realized
how crippled we are.

186
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:12,906
- We're being hailed.
- Put it up.

187
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,145
<i>My name is Katana Labrea.
I'm a traveler.</i>

188
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:17,495
<i>Larrin sent me.</i>

189
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:20,031
Well, is everything all right?

190
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:21,987
<i>No, as a matter of fact, it's not.</i>

191
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:25,711
<i>Larrin was hoping you could tell us
why the Stargates are blowing up.</i>

192
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:37,473
You. Come with me.

193
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:38,641
Me? Why?

194
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,977
- We'll both go. No need for that.
- No.

195
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:48,192
I guess it just must be your turn
to use the fitness room.

196
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,961
Right.

197
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:52,223
Good luck.

198
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:53,756
You too.

199
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,402
It was the first colony we'd built
on the surface of a planet

200
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:08,325
in a hundred generations,

201
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:10,673
and it was leveled in an instant.

202
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:13,033
I was in orbit when it happened.

203
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:15,344
We could see the explosion
from space.

204
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:18,653
I've never witnessed anything
that powerful.

205
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:20,342
The Gates are made of naquadah.

206
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:24,306
When they become unstable, the size
of the explosion is unimaginable.

207
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,049
We lost 3,000 people

208
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:28,635
and two ships,

209
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:30,484
including our Ancient vessel.

210
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:34,857
- Larrin would have come herself, but...
- No, I'm sure she's got her hands full.

211
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:38,954
Look, these aliens
or whoever they are,

212
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,869
they have two of our people hostage.
They need to be stopped.

213
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:45,166
We have coordinates,
but... we have no ship.

214
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:48,163
- Then I guess I got here just in time.
- That's what I wanted to hear.

215
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:49,667
Zelenka, you're with me.

216
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:53,506
Teyla, I need you to stay here,
all right? The second Todd's done,

217
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,844
there's nothing stopping him
from making a run at Atlantis.

218
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:00,031
I need somebody I can trust
to stay in charge here.

219
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:01,348
Good luck.

220
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:23,962
I locked the door.

221
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,664
- This won't take long.
- So what do we do?

222
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:30,336
Bring up the main control systems
and disable them one by one?

223
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:32,056
That's one way to go.

224
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:35,466
You'd have to lock them out.
Or they could turn them back on again.

225
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:37,629
Do you have some sort of a passcode

226
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:40,000
to make sure they're locked out
once and for all?

227
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,121
Nope.

228
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:43,265
Well, then, what are you thinking?

229
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:56,090
- We just dropped out of hyperspace.
- I see that, yes.

230
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:58,864
- Why?
- I'm not sure.

231
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:02,727
The computer seems to think
it's due to battle damage.

232
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,869
Get our troops
down to the engineering room.

233
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:06,622
Someone's sabotaging this ship.

234
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:12,369
What are you doing?

235
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:13,995
Disabling the ship.

236
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,425
You can't just blast away
at vital systems like that!

237
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:20,868
What if you take out
the life support system?

238
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:23,520
Don't worry.
The life support system is that tray.

239
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:25,775
At least, I'm pretty sure it is.

240
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:29,199
Okay, we're out of hyperspace.
That's enough. Come on.

241
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:46,537
You wish to speak to me?

242
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:49,384
You're the leader?

243
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:54,920
You need to shut this device down
immediately.

244
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,406
No, I do not.

245
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,558
Okay, look, I understand
wanting to destroy the Wraith.

246
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:04,472
I do.
But this isn't the way.

247
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,515
I disagree.

248
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,828
I don't know
if you're aware of this or not,

249
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,415
but this device
has a serious side effect.

250
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:14,607
It makes Stargates explode
when they're activated.

251
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:16,901
We do not use the Stargates.

252
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:19,170
Okay.

253
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,198
But lots of other people do.

254
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,317
They are of no concern to us.

255
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:30,998
So you're just gonna let them die,
millions of people, across the galaxy?

256
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:37,963
- You're no better than the Wraith.
- Perhaps. But we have little choice.

257
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:39,147
Why?

258
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:43,221
Our planet is dying.
It can no longer sustain us.

259
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,527
For the first time
in countless generations,

260
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:48,123
we must venture out
into this galaxy again,

261
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:50,265
a galaxy controlled by the Wraith.

262
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,350
If we do not destroy them,
they will destroy us.

263
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:55,254
This is the way it must be.

264
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,593
They're ahead. When they get to that
planet, they'll open up with everything.

265
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:08,156
Trust me, they ain't gonna be worried
about collateral damage.

266
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:11,413
The only chance we have to save
our friends is to get there first.

267
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:14,124
You want speed?
You've come to the right place.

268
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,713
This is your engineering ?

269
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:23,088
That's right.

270
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,401
It may not look like much,
but trust me,

271
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:28,253
we can outrun most anything
in the traveler fleet.

272
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:29,745
Mila?

273
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,350
Hey.

274
00:15:34,148 --> 00:15:35,938
This is Colonel Sheppard
and Dr. Zelenka.

275
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:38,810
They're from Atlantis.
Mila's our chief engineer.

276
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:42,417
- She can't be more than 16 years old.
- 15, actually.

277
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:45,523
She's been working on ships
since she was four.

278
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:49,058
We need to get where we're going
as fast as possible.

279
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:51,662
I want you to do whatever you can
to maximize hyperdrive output.

280
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,272
No problem.

281
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:56,917
You know, Zelenka knows a thing or two
about hyperdrives himself.

282
00:15:57,294 --> 00:15:59,679
I'm sure he'd be happy
to give you a hand.

283
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,760
Who knows,
maybe you'll learn a thing or two.

284
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:17,218
The damage is significant.
Begin repairs.

285
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:19,338
Every second
the attero device is active,

286
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,966
we risk losing more and more
of our alliance.

287
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,655
It has come to my attention that someone
from the crew has eluded capture.

288
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:30,029
<i>Your freedom has become a nuisance.</i>

289
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,029
<i>Turn yourself in immediately or
we will begin killing off your friends</i>

290
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:35,387
<i>one by one.</i>

291
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:38,344
- <i>You have three minutes to comply.</i>
- He's bluffing.

292
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,092
- No, he's not.
- Where are you going?

293
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:42,087
- I'm turning myself in.
- No, you're not.

294
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,549
- He's gonna start killing people.
- He's gonna kill you.

295
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,714
Well, I hope not.

296
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:50,256
We need to get armed, free these people,
take this ship back.

297
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,794
Exactly. I turn myself in,
and he'll think he's got us all.

298
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:55,105
It buys you the time you need
to do what you've gotta do.

299
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:57,404
- No. I'm not letting you do it.
- Ronon, listen to me...

300
00:16:57,524 --> 00:16:59,226
Jennifer,
no.

301
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,025
Okay.

302
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:05,964
You're right.

303
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,367
Okay.

304
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,635
Come on.

305
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:10,846
We're almost there anyways.

306
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:21,877
We're talking about the deaths
of millions of people.

307
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:26,382
How can you be so callous?

308
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:31,028
And what is it you're so afraid of?
Why are you still in your battle armor?

309
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:33,472
I can't hurt you.

310
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:38,352
- I know you're not human.
- You're definitely not Wraith.

311
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:43,680
And if you were an Ancient, you wouldn't
need our help to activate the device.

312
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,248
What are you?

313
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:24,507
You're Asgard.

314
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,220
You've encountered our kind before?

315
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:30,481
No, not just encountered.
I've worked with them,

316
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:33,420
even called a few of them
my friends.

317
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,283
Indeed.

318
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:37,386
Of course, the Asgard I knew
were a noble race

319
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:40,039
who actually helped
the human population in my galaxy.

320
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,540
And where are they now?

321
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:44,728
Dead.

322
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:49,048
- But that had nothing to do with us.
- Are you certain?

323
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,066
They were clones...

324
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,635
Copies of copies of copies,
going back generations,

325
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,763
and they suffered irreversible
genetic degradation as a result.

326
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,478
- But you probably already know that.
- Of course,

327
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,230
because we are clones as well,

328
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,857
subject to the same law
of diminishing returns.

329
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,816
And yet,
we are still very much alive.

330
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:10,948
- So, what, you solved the problem?
- Not entirely.

331
00:19:11,307 --> 00:19:14,116
But once we were able to conduct
our research without interference,

332
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,824
we made significant progress.

333
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,598
Research on humans...

334
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,122
Because our physiology is similar
to what yours used to be.

335
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:23,665
Precisely.

336
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:26,451
I take that back.
I have met an Asgard like you before.

337
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:27,711
His name was Loki,

338
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,545
and he was experimenting
on humans too,

339
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:31,900
until he was caught

340
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,301
and brought to justice
by the Asgard High Council.

341
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:37,846
Because they did not believe
the ends justified the means.

342
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,164
That's right.

343
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:42,167
And look where it got them.

344
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,571
- Well, how's it coming?
- Well...

345
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,330
It does that sometimes.
Don't let it bother you.

346
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,705
- What we are doing here is not safe.
- What else is new?

347
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:06,125
She is pushing this ship
well past its boundaries.

348
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:07,958
That's kind
of what we asked for, no?

349
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:10,817
If we don't get Rodney and Danny back
before Todd gets there, they're goners.

350
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:13,356
This is the crudest hyperdrive system
I've ever encountered.

351
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:15,491
It is cobbled together
from mismatching components.

352
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:17,579
She's gotta be smart
to put a hyperdrive together

353
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:19,747
- with mismatched parts.
- She's going to burn it up.

354
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:21,975
Once out of hyperspace,
there's a high possibility

355
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,854
we won't be able
to engage the drive again.

356
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,807
Let's worry about that
when we get there.

357
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:27,240
What was that?

358
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:29,922
Just a radiation warning.

359
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:31,838
The detector's
a little over-sensitive.

360
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,619
I wouldn't worry about it.

361
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:38,648
I gotta get back to the bridge.
I'll leave you to it.

362
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:44,671
We came to this galaxy
during the war.

363
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:48,833
With both of them occupied,
we were free to conduct our experiments.

364
00:20:48,953 --> 00:20:51,794
Unfortunately, the hostilities
came to an end sooner than we thought,

365
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:54,106
and with an unexpected result.

366
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:56,133
You were betting on the Ancients.

367
00:20:56,476 --> 00:20:59,213
They may have tried to shut you down,
but at least they wouldn't

368
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,304
exterminate you.

369
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:03,768
The Wraith do not tolerate
the presence of advanced technologies

370
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:04,994
other than their own.

371
00:21:05,114 --> 00:21:07,983
Before we knew what was happening,
we were under attack.

372
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:10,314
We lost our intergalactic ships
in the first battle,

373
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:12,858
and we did not have the resources
to build more.

374
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:14,697
So how did you survive?

375
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,900
We had no choice
but to abandon our settlements

376
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,231
and retreat to a place
where the Wraith could not look for us,

377
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:23,829
a planet with a toxic atmosphere.

378
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:27,873
That... sounds nice.

379
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,176
It was tolerable at first.

380
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:33,740
We were able to survive
using simple breathing apparatus.

381
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,381
But over the eons,
the environment has grown so harsh

382
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:41,554
that not even our armored exoskeletons
can protect us now.

383
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:45,139
So you ventured back into the galaxy,
that's when you came across this place.

384
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,301
We knew it was built
by the Ancients, and why,

385
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:51,813
but we were unable to activate it
until you came along.

386
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:53,489
Look, I... I'm sorry

387
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:56,864
that you were trapped on a poisonous
planet for the last 10,000 years.

388
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,152
I really am.
I'm sure it was awful.

389
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:01,823
But that doesn't justify
what you're doing.

390
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:04,239
My people are dying.

391
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:07,969
The fact that, as you tell us,
our brothers are already gone,

392
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:10,142
only reinforces the need.

393
00:22:10,486 --> 00:22:13,303
If we do not do this,
our whole civilization,

394
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:15,615
a hundred thousand years of history,

395
00:22:15,804 --> 00:22:17,600
will be wiped out forever.

396
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:20,477
I cannot allow that to happen.

397
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,485
Dr. Keller.

398
00:22:28,995 --> 00:22:30,489
You're the saboteur?

399
00:22:31,343 --> 00:22:32,437
That's right.

400
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:36,120
Where's your weapon?

401
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:38,615
- My weapon?
- Yes.

402
00:22:38,735 --> 00:22:41,488
The one you used
to destroy the crystal trays.

403
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:44,823
I ditched it.

404
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:48,068
You really think I'd want it
ending up in your hands?

405
00:22:48,188 --> 00:22:50,927
Oh, it's foolish of you
to see me as the enemy.

406
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:53,024
Really? Why's that?

407
00:22:53,174 --> 00:22:55,627
I'm on a mission
from your Colonel Sheppard.

408
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,369
I seriously doubt that.

409
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:00,734
It is a long story,
but he has requested

410
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:04,364
that we neutralize
a very dangerous target.

411
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:08,116
Then why did you take over the ship?
Why did you attack our crew?

412
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:10,986
As I said, it is a long story.

413
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,942
The mission, however,
is time-sensitive,

414
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:14,713
and you have handed us
a major setback.

415
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,301
Hyperdrive, weapons, shields...

416
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:19,272
they are all down.

417
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:22,110
- That's a real shame.
- It is,

418
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:26,554
considering that hundreds
of thousands of humans

419
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:28,577
could die because of it.

420
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:31,997
I would think that will weigh heavily
on you in the future.

421
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:34,562
What are you talking about?

422
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:36,584
Hyperdrive's coming back up.

423
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:37,710
And weapons?

424
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,923
Irreparably damaged.
They're no good to us anymore.

425
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:45,035
I guess you won't be able
to finish the mission, then.

426
00:23:46,182 --> 00:23:47,888
We'll find a way.

427
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:53,173
Get us back into hyperspace

428
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,438
and get her down with the others.

429
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:19,239
You okay?

430
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,864
- I thought you were a goner.
- I'm all right.

431
00:24:21,984 --> 00:24:23,672
They need me.
You're kind of expendable.

432
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:26,225
- I just figured...
- Yeah, I got what you meant by "goner".

433
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,720
- What did they want?
- To talk, actually.

434
00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:32,057
- Oh. How did that go?
- They're Asgard.

435
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:33,700
- For real?
- Yeah,

436
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,384
a faction that broke off from the guys
we knew thousands of years ago.

437
00:24:36,504 --> 00:24:39,647
- They're the ones inside the suits.
- I did not see that one coming.

438
00:24:39,857 --> 00:24:43,773
- Apparently no fans of the Wraith.
- Are they gonna shut off the device?

439
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,570
- No.
- Then I don't care.

440
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,232
As long as that thing is on,
then millions of people could die.

441
00:24:48,352 --> 00:24:50,918
Besides, I think
I've figured a way out of here.

442
00:24:51,296 --> 00:24:52,052
Really?

443
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:54,070
This is an Ancient facility,

444
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,680
and Rodney McKay knows a thing or two
about Ancient facilities.

445
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,638
It's been proven,
referring to yourself

446
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:00,969
in the third person
is a sign of mental instability.

447
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:03,422
Mentally unstable like a fox!

448
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,551
Okay, so, here's the plan.

449
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,402
I blow the fire-monitoring fuse.

450
00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:09,886
The system suddenly goes dead,
it assumes there could be a fire,

451
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:13,181
detects lifesigns inside the room,
it unlocks the doors for safety.

452
00:25:18,422 --> 00:25:19,422
Good job.

453
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:24,052
Good thing they brought you back,
assumed you were dead, was gonna leave.

454
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:26,222
- Lucky me.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

455
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:28,802
- So, what do we do now?
- We've got to shut down the device.

456
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:32,595
- How do we do that?
- We'll just... We'll improvise.

457
00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:35,202
Right.

458
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:01,471
Todd didn't kill you.

459
00:26:02,298 --> 00:26:03,802
No, but you almost got me killed.

460
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:06,678
I've never fired one of these
outside of the range before.

461
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,000
You did great.

462
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,956
- Ronon. Good work.
- It's not over yet.

463
00:26:21,172 --> 00:26:23,865
There's an armory down the hall.
We need everyone we can.

464
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:25,734
We're taking this ship back.

465
00:26:28,737 --> 00:26:31,122
Okay. We need to get
to the device control room.

466
00:26:31,242 --> 00:26:33,178
- It'll be crawling with soldiers.
- A diversion.

467
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:36,065
- I'm all ears.
- We go to the power relay station,

468
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:38,122
- we create a massive explosion.
- I never got

469
00:26:38,242 --> 00:26:40,143
- how that made a good diversion.
- What?

470
00:26:40,547 --> 00:26:42,926
You want to clear the device
control room of bad guys, right?

471
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:46,364
Why would assume if there was a massive
explosion, people would run towards it?

472
00:26:46,484 --> 00:26:48,234
- I would.
- I rest my case.

473
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:50,131
I'm sorry.
I'm a good person.

474
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:52,677
I'd want to save people from the fire,
figure out what's going on.

475
00:26:52,797 --> 00:26:56,945
I'd order more guards to protect
the room whoever wants to get to.

476
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,584
Explosion diversions
are the very cornerstone of diversions.

477
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,423
- You don't have any better ideas?
- I don't have any better ideas, yes.

478
00:27:05,543 --> 00:27:08,588
Oh, my God. Please don't kill me.
You need me. Us, us. You need us.

479
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:11,757
Look, the device needs constant care.
I'm the only one who can work it...

480
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,428
What am I talking about killing for?
You ain't violent. You may've stunned...

481
00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:17,570
- more than we'd have liked, but...
- They're suits.

482
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,601
Suits that house
one of the smartest races ever.

483
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,775
I've always been
a big fan of the Asgards.

484
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:24,270
- Some of my best friends are Asgards...
- They're empty suits.

485
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:26,992
See?

486
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:29,425
- Yeah. I know. I was...
- You were...

487
00:27:29,635 --> 00:27:31,183
Yeah, it's not important.

488
00:27:32,045 --> 00:27:33,554
You know, from what I could tell,

489
00:27:33,674 --> 00:27:36,374
the inside of the suits form
around whoever's in them.

490
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:38,416
One size fits all...

491
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,132
You sure you have all that
figured out?

492
00:27:52,726 --> 00:27:55,726
I've flown birds a lot harder to manage
than this one.

493
00:27:56,872 --> 00:27:59,423
I'm surprised Larrin
didn't say anything.

494
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:02,067
Larrin's never brought you up
before today.

495
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,476
Really?
Never, huh?

496
00:28:05,021 --> 00:28:06,087
Nope.

497
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:12,067
We're about to come out of hyperspace.
Everyone, get ready.

498
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,917
See, I knew this would happen.

499
00:28:28,158 --> 00:28:30,670
- We burned it out.
- We got here, though, didn't we?

500
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:36,608
Any sign of the Daedalus?

501
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:38,803
No. Looks like we beat them.

502
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:41,639
That's the first good news
I've had all day.

503
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:42,875
Wait,

504
00:28:43,072 --> 00:28:45,866
I've got two ships closing in.
Shields up.

505
00:28:45,986 --> 00:28:47,077
Fire at will.

506
00:28:47,197 --> 00:28:50,054
- Evasive maneuvers might be good.
- I'm on it.

507
00:29:06,724 --> 00:29:09,416
Clear! How come
we haven't run into any of them yet?

508
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:11,340
I've got a bad feeling about this.

509
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,630
Do a lifesigns scan,
find out where they are.

510
00:29:17,813 --> 00:29:20,394
I have a mass of lifesigns
in the second 302 bay.

511
00:29:20,514 --> 00:29:22,597
They fell back to their ship.
It's still in the bay.

512
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:24,140
Why?

513
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,389
They saw we'd armed up?
Didn't want to risk a fight?

514
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:29,366
That doesn't sound like Todd.
I'm gonna check it out.

515
00:29:30,342 --> 00:29:32,092
Take us out of hyperspace.

516
00:29:36,094 --> 00:29:36,895
What?

517
00:29:37,015 --> 00:29:39,656
- They locked us out of flight controls.
- Can you get us back in?

518
00:29:40,222 --> 00:29:41,408
Not quickly.

519
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,488
What's he got planned?

520
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:56,410
Okay, how long
to get the device shut down?

521
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:57,968
Five minutes.

522
00:29:58,857 --> 00:30:00,920
All right, look.
You watch the...

523
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:03,138
- Oh, come on!
- What? What now?

524
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:05,409
- Something must have spooked them.
- Why?

525
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:07,427
Aside from encrypting
the access to this...

526
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:09,717
- But you can break that.
- In a heartbeat,

527
00:30:09,837 --> 00:30:12,938
but you can't operate this machine
without the control key.

528
00:30:13,905 --> 00:30:16,969
Look... the thing they stole
from Janus' lab to begin with.

529
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:18,469
They've taken it.

530
00:30:38,821 --> 00:30:40,258
One down, one to go.

531
00:30:40,418 --> 00:30:42,218
I'm picking up a third ship.


532
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:43,720
Wonderful.

533
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:57,512
That was close.
It flew into hyperspace.

534
00:30:58,004 --> 00:30:59,068
- What?
- Hold on,

535
00:30:59,228 --> 00:31:01,847
- I've got another window opening.
- They're coming right back at us.

536
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:04,240
What kind of messed-up
battle technique is that?

537
00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:07,407
It's quite a bit out,
nowhere near the planet yet.

538
00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:10,121
Wait... it's the Daedalus.

539
00:31:12,313 --> 00:31:14,792
Contact them.
We're gonna need the help.

540
00:31:15,717 --> 00:31:18,254
- <i>Colonel Sheppard?</i>
- Surprised to see all of you guys.

541
00:31:18,568 --> 00:31:19,672
Same here.

542
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,354
<i>Look, I'm on a Travelers...</i>

543
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:25,211
<i>I'm on a travelers ship.
We've engaged the enemy.</i>

544
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:27,847
<i>Have you gotten the Daedalus back?
Because we're gonna need the help.</i>

545
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,621
Todd let us take her back
without so much as a fight.

546
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:33,478
But he's locked us out of the controls
and retreated to one of the 302 bays.

547
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:36,199
Why the hell would he do that?

548
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,107
He needs that place destroyed.


549
00:31:38,372 --> 00:31:40,574
- Mr. Woolsey, sir?
- What is it, Marks?

550
00:31:41,218 --> 00:31:44,822
The second we came out of hyperspace,
a pre-programmed sub-routine kicked in.

551
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:48,130
- Meaning...
- Our main scanners located a facility

552
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,929
and immediately locked
the guidance system into it.

553
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,464
It's taking us to the Attero device.

554
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:54,457
In a way...

555
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:56,543
Sir, it's programmed
a collision course.

556
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:01,422
That's how he's gonna destroy it,
by ramming us into the facility.

557
00:32:07,337 --> 00:32:09,101
Can't we just power down
the facility?

558
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:11,957
Can't do more than turn the lights off
without the component thing.

559
00:32:12,077 --> 00:32:13,651
We have to do something.

560
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:14,945
Wait a second.

561
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:17,355
These suits were designed to protect
from harsh environments?

562
00:32:17,678 --> 00:32:18,857
Technically, yes.

563
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:22,488
Then I have a really terrible idea.

564
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,596
You're not thinking
what I think you're thinking.

565
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:29,698
The radiation
would be pretty extreme.

566
00:32:29,818 --> 00:32:32,704
Not to mention electrical discharges
look pretty unfriendly, but...

567
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:35,790
The antenna has a control crystal.
If we could pull it manually...

568
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,458
It's 50-50 we even get that far.

569
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:39,780
I'd go 30-70,
but I don't have a better idea,

570
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,990
and the suits,
they should protect us.

571
00:32:46,653 --> 00:32:48,136
We disabled the ship weapons.

572
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:50,732
- You did?
- Ronon did, yeah.

573
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:54,118
They didn't have any other choice.
Ramming the facility with the ship

574
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,185
is the only way to take it out.

575
00:32:57,291 --> 00:33:01,190
- Killing all of us in the process.
- I don't think he's worried about us.

576
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:03,276
They just depressurized the 302 bay.

577
00:33:15,422 --> 00:33:18,092
- You ready?
- Let's just get this over with.

578
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:23,937
You know we both
don't have to go in there.

579
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:26,261
When you get killed
by one of those discharges,

580
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,639
someone's gonna have
to finish the job, so...

581
00:33:29,528 --> 00:33:31,263
Great pep talk.
Thanks.

582
00:33:51,344 --> 00:33:53,794
I'm pretty sure
we wanna avoid those touching us.

583
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:54,869
Thanks, coach.

584
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:21,623
What are you waiting for?

585
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:25,486
I have to pull the right one
or the antenna explodes.

586
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:29,090
Hurry up.

587
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:35,339
But get it right.

588
00:34:37,947 --> 00:34:39,821
How long before the Daedalus
hits the surface?

589
00:34:40,355 --> 00:34:42,375
A minute, tops.
How many people on board?

590
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,008
Couple hundred.

591
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:47,130
Look, I've got an idea,
but you're gonna have to trust me.

592
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,464
All right.

593
00:34:51,144 --> 00:34:54,845
Open up the hyperdrive in 30 seconds<i></i>.
We're gonna have to make a short jump.

594
00:34:55,138 --> 00:34:56,975
- Impossible.
- Not a problem.

595
00:34:59,238 --> 00:35:00,768
You can do this, Marks.

596
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:02,874
We're all counting on you.

597
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:04,869
I've almost got it.

598
00:35:06,032 --> 00:35:07,942
We're entering the atmosphere.

599
00:35:43,695 --> 00:35:44,771
Here goes nothing.

600
00:36:00,352 --> 00:36:01,503
What just happened?

601
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:04,290
- <i>You're welcome.</i>
- What did you do?

602
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:07,747
I just opened up a hyperspace window
big enough for the both of us.

603
00:36:08,236 --> 00:36:10,628
We just traveled through the planet.

604
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:12,915
I got it!

605
00:36:13,648 --> 00:36:15,593
I'm back in.
We've got control of the ship.

606
00:36:16,226 --> 00:36:18,513
And not a moment too late.

607
00:36:20,031 --> 00:36:22,809
- They found us again.
- Give them everything you've got.

608
00:36:35,435 --> 00:36:37,266
You're okay, you're okay.

609
00:36:39,686 --> 00:36:40,660
Wrong again.

610
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:43,898
Did you turn it off?

611
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:46,137
I did... we did... you did.

612
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:48,760
Look, where does it hurt?

613
00:36:49,717 --> 00:36:50,854
Everywhere.

614
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:55,707
I don't suppose
there's a hospital nearby?

615
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:58,094
I'm pretty sure we're on our own.

616
00:36:58,766 --> 00:36:59,859
Good.

617
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:04,723
Look, on the bright side,
we'll be dead of dehydration in 5 days,

618
00:37:04,843 --> 00:37:07,341
so you won't have to put up with me
for much longer.

619
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:11,962
I'm pretty busted up, Rodney.

620
00:37:13,751 --> 00:37:16,160
I don't think
I'm gonna make it that long.

621
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,269
I know it may not seem like it,

622
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:21,492
but I want you to know
I really res...

623
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:29,041
- Oh, thank God.
- I sure am glad to see you two.

624
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:30,741
He's badly hurt.

625
00:37:32,913 --> 00:37:34,832
That's a new look for you.

626
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,518
You know me,
it's function over fashion.

627
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:41,487
- Is the device still active?
- Not without this.

628
00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:43,674
It's the facility's
main control crystal.

629
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,820
That's not good enough for me.

630
00:37:47,502 --> 00:37:50,577
We have Drs. McKay and Jackson.
Our weapons are not operational.

631
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:54,370
Please see to it that we never have
to deal with the Attero device again?

632
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,320
- I'm locked on to its coordinates.
- Opening fire.

633
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:08,539
Leveled.

634
00:38:09,943 --> 00:38:11,046
Good.

635
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,503
- Let's go home.
- Well, you want to... unzip me?

636
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:17,633
I'll look for a can opener.

637
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:29,851
Zelenka has helped with ship repairs.
It should be ready to fly in no time.

638
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:31,069
Then what?

639
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:33,270
Start a new settlement, I guess.

640
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,363
Good to hear.

641
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:36,650
You tell Larrin I'll help you
with whatever you need.

642
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,481
Thank you.
We'll be in touch.

643
00:38:38,601 --> 00:38:40,368
Yeah.
I'm sure you will be.

644
00:38:41,108 --> 00:38:45,092
Tell Larrin she doesn't need to wait for
the next galactic emergency to drop by.

645
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,881
I'm a lot more charming
when my friends aren't about to die.

646
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:50,496
That's not what Larrin said.

647
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:52,996
See, she does talk about me!

648
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:54,732
Every now and again.

649
00:38:55,538 --> 00:38:57,025
What does she say?

650
00:38:59,244 --> 00:39:00,871
What, not even a hint?

651
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:11,477
You all done for the day?

652
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,552
Dr. Cole's taking my shift.
Yeah.

653
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:16,561
Wanna get something to eat?

654
00:39:17,245 --> 00:39:18,192
Listen,

655
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,112
I'm really glad
you came on the mission.

656
00:39:21,836 --> 00:39:23,964
I mean, without you there, we'd...

657
00:39:24,084 --> 00:39:25,491
probably all be dead.

658
00:39:27,413 --> 00:39:28,493
But...

659
00:39:29,026 --> 00:39:30,995
I just want to be clear,

660
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:32,416
because,

661
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:41,122
I just want you to know,
that I'm kind of...

662
00:39:42,762 --> 00:39:44,662
interested in somebody else.

663
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:47,513
So?

664
00:39:48,913 --> 00:39:50,964
I just didn't wanna give you
the wrong...

665
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,269
Didn't.
I just wanted to get something to eat.

666
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,801
Okay, because I thought...

667
00:39:56,174 --> 00:39:57,606
Yeah, well, you're wrong.

668
00:40:07,903 --> 00:40:09,590
Do you still wanna go...

669
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,351
No. I should probably...

670
00:40:15,424 --> 00:40:16,488
I should go.

671
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:27,489
How are you?

672
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:30,222
- It hurts to eat this fruit cup.
- Don't eat the fruit cup, then.

673
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,120
Thank you, Groucho.

674
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,013
Not that I don't appreciate the visits,

675
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:37,452
but shouldn't you be figuring out a way
to keep the Asgards out of the shield?

676
00:40:37,572 --> 00:40:39,398
One step ahead of you.
Won't happen again.

677
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:41,264
Oh. Good.

678
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:44,073
You don't think
they'd make a run at us again?

679
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:46,022
Well, I'm not sure,

680
00:40:46,142 --> 00:40:49,589
but we did ruin the one plan they had.
They might hold a grudge.

681
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:51,118
Well, let's hope not.

682
00:40:51,384 --> 00:40:54,413
- I won't be around to find out.
- I heard they're sending you back.

683
00:40:54,691 --> 00:40:56,992
Yeah, I guess I need
some major patching up and recovery.

684
00:40:57,112 --> 00:40:59,682
Landry prefers I do that
there instead of here, so...

685
00:40:59,802 --> 00:41:02,315
The Daedalus already picked up
a Gate left over from the Gate bridge,

686
00:41:02,435 --> 00:41:05,758
and my team is installing it,
so we should have you home in no time.

687
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:09,136
That's good.
That is good.

688
00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:10,554
Yes. So...

689
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:14,665
Well, it's been...

690
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:19,162
- unique.
- Yes, it has. It sure has.

691
00:41:19,723 --> 00:41:22,027
But I do want to say thank you for...

692
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,706
saying that you respected me
when you thought I was about to die.

693
00:41:26,826 --> 00:41:29,865
- Excuse me? I said no such thing.
- Yeah, you did. You were, like...

694
00:41:30,025 --> 00:41:32,395
"I know it may not seem like it,
but I really respect you.",

695
00:41:32,515 --> 00:41:35,536
and that means a great deal to me.

696
00:41:36,218 --> 00:41:38,582
I don't believe I ever finished
that sentence.

697
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,355
- How else would you have finished?
- I would have said "regret."

698
00:41:41,475 --> 00:41:44,587
I would have said
I really regret you being here

699
00:41:45,157 --> 00:41:47,180
because none of this
would have happened...

700
00:41:47,522 --> 00:41:48,742
Otherwise.

701
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:54,205
So you can only
give compliments to the dying?

702
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:56,600
It's something I'm working on.

703
00:41:58,181 --> 00:41:59,997
Do you wanna try any of this?

704
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,156
Fries.

705
00:42:01,443 --> 00:42:03,982
Dive right in, take the...
Take the deal there.
