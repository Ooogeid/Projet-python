1
00:00:01,783 --> 00:00:04,435
- What are you talking about?
- I'm telling you,

2
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:06,739
- she's hiding him from me.
- She's not hiding him.

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:10,290
Every time I go to see him, she tells me
that he's just settled down.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,212
- Can you blame her? You dropped him.
- I did not drop him, he jumped.

5
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:15,349
- Jumped?
- He wiggled out of my arms.

6
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:18,496
I said I was sorry. Besides, how much
damage could I possibly have done?

7
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:20,690
He fell, like, maybe two feet.

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,564
Stuff like that happens all the time.
I was dropped like, a dozen times

9
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:25,629
- when I was a kid.
- That explains a lot.

10
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:28,369
- Why care? You don't like kids.
- It's the principle of the thing.

11
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:31,391
- Everybody else gets to hold him.
- Colonel...

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,485
We've got a new contact.
Looks like a ship.

13
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:36,708
- How far out?
- It's in orbit.

14
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:39,338
- How come we didn't detect it?
- I don't know.

15
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,548
We didn't detect a hyperspace window.
It just appeared out of nowhere.

16
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,072
Hang on a second, we're getting IFF.

17
00:00:45,443 --> 00:00:46,925
It's the Daedalus.

18
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:49,719
How can that be?
They're on their way back to Earth.

19
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:51,513
They were supposed to be.

20
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:54,714
Open up a channel.

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,960
Daedalus, this is Atlantis,
please come in.

22
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,013
Daedalus, please respond.

23
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:06,719
They're not gonna answer.

24
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:07,841
Why not?

25
00:01:08,128 --> 00:01:10,455
Because I'm not reading any lifesigns.

26
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:13,326
What are you telling me, Rodney,
this thing flew here by itself?

27
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:16,121
I don't know how they got here,
but there's no one on board.

28
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,813
At least, no one alive.

37
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:34,783
<i>Colonel, we just got confirmation
from Stargate Command.</i>

38
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:38,369
<i>The Daedalus is in the Milky Way,
on course and on schedule.</i>

39
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,451
<i>They expect to reach Earth
within two days.</i>

40
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:41,769
Understood.

41
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:44,614
So that's not the Daedalus, then.

42
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:46,073
Well...

43
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:49,264
Not unless it can be in two places
at once.

44
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:51,843
Perhaps one of your other ships...

45
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,210
They wouldn't be sending Daedalus IFF,
it doesn't explain how they got here,

46
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,180
or why we're not picking up
lifesign readings.

47
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:01,100
All right,
I'm taking us in for a closer look.

48
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:22,288
You see that?

49
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,038
Some scorch marks.
You think weaponsfire?

50
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:30,296
Wherever she's been, she's been through
some pretty hard times.

51
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:33,252
What's that?

52
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:35,548
I'm picking up an energy reading.

53
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:36,786
From the ship.

54
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:39,138
- Is it dangerous?
- I don't think so, but I have

55
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:41,813
- no idea what's causing it.
- Can you get the bay doors open?

56
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:44,030
If the ship's command systems
are the same,

57
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,949
it shouldn't be a problem.

58
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:03,259
No F-302s, but

59
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,207
there's a Jumper.

60
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:08,551
You sure there's no one else inside?

61
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,270
As far as I can tell.

62
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:12,297
All right, we're going in.

63
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,384
Why is it so cold in here?

64
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,966
The ship's operating on emergency power.

65
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:36,321
Some of the systems
are barely registering.

66
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,311
- Except for the weird energy thing.
- That's right.

67
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:41,226
Can you do something about it?

68
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:43,948
Sure, I just have to get to engineering.

69
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:47,582
You and Ronon are together.
Teyla and me, we check out the bridge.

70
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,836
Radio me if you find anything.

71
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,181
No bodies in here.

72
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:12,440
Colonel...

73
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:20,281
It's the Daedalus, all right.

74
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:24,912
McKay, is that you?

75
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:27,038
<i>Of course it was me.
Who else would it be?</i>

76
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:30,300
You think we've got a ghost
on board or something?

77
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,616
Will you please not touch anything!

78
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:36,005
<i>What's our status?</i>

79
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,923
I've restored basic power to the ship.

80
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,010
- <i><i>It should be warming up any second.</i></i>
- Good.

81
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:44,931
Check on that energy reading.
Try to figure out what it is, all right?

82
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:46,987
I'm on it.

83
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:49,769
Colonel...

84
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:52,245
Ship's log, last entry.

85
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:00,406
<i>Preparations are almost complete.</i>

86
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,280
<i><i>We've beamed down our supplies,</i></i>

87
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:04,363
<i>and any equipment
we think might be useful.</i>

88
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:07,583
<i>I'll be taking the last
of the F-302s down myself.</i>

89
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:10,807
<i>We haven't had time to do
a proper survey of the planet's surface,</i>

90
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:12,785
<i>but it seems habitable enough.</i>

91
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,802
<i>Plenty of fresh water, arable soil,</i>

92
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:17,280
<i>not that different from our own.</i>

93
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,340
<i>I realize our chance of rescue is slim,</i>

94
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:23,051
<i>but it's become obvious
that we no longer have a choice.</i>

95
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:26,713
<i>This is colonel Sobol,
commander of the Daedalus,</i>

96
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,937
<i>signing off.</i>

97
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:30,567
Do you recognize her?

98
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:33,187
I've never seen her before in my life.

99
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:36,173
It appears as if they abandoned ship.

100
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:38,397
Yeah. The question is, why?

101
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,581
I'll check previous entries.

102
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,157
Man, this ship
has been through the wringer.

103
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:48,277
No hyperdrive,

104
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:50,486
subspace communications
are all damaged beyond repair,

105
00:06:50,606 --> 00:06:53,007
the shields are virtually depleted...

106
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:56,649
What is it?

107
00:06:56,893 --> 00:06:58,212
It's the energy reading.

108
00:06:58,732 --> 00:06:59,931
It's spiking.

109
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:01,834
Sheppard, come in.

110
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:04,184
- <i>Go ahead.</i>
- Something's happening.

111
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,716
The energy reading,
it's going off the charts.

112
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:08,222
Do something. Turn it off.

113
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,517
I don't know how. It's not coming
from any of the main systems.

114
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:14,478
<i><i>This is Atlantis.</i></i>

115
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,117
We're picking up some kind
of power surge coming from the ship.

116
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,407
Yeah, we noticed it.
We're trying to check it out ourselves.

117
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,282
The levels are still rising.

118
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,209
Colonel, should we send another Jumper?

119
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:26,533
<i>Stand by.</i>

120
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,762
All right, that's our cue to leave.

121
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:38,461
Everyone, back in the Jumper.

122
00:07:45,204 --> 00:07:46,779
McKay, what the hell was that?

123
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,449
<i>I have no idea, but...</i>

124
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:51,349
The energy reading's
gone back down the way it was.

125
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,104
Atlantis, you reading anything unusual?

126
00:07:58,158 --> 00:07:59,560
<i>Atlantis, come in.</i>

127
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,192
Atlantis, do you read?

128
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,308
Colonel Sheppard, do you read?

129
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:13,356
Daedalus, this is Atlantis,
please respond.

130
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:18,090
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

131
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,170
One moment they were there,
the next minute, they were gone.

132
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,843
<i>I'm having problems with communications.</i>

133
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:28,506
<i>I can't reach Atlantis.</i>

134
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:29,825
Wait a second.

135
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:32,864
- That can't be right.
- What?

136
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,102
I'm not seeing the City
on any of my screens.

137
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,795
What are you talking about?

138
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:40,500
<i>I just did a sensor sweep,</i>

139
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,330
<i>and there's nothing down there</i>
<i>but ocean.</i>

140
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,371
Maybe they cloaked.

141
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:47,283
- <i><i>Without telling us?</i></i>
- I don't know,

142
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,372
maybe there's a Wraith ship in the area.

143
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:51,291
<i>I'm not reading anything.</i>

144
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:53,636
Are we certain it's the same planet?

145
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:56,383
Perhaps the energy burst
shifted our position.

146
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:59,200
No, according to our instruments,
we haven't moved at all.

147
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,382
What do you want me to believe, Rodney?
That Atlantis just disappeared?

148
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:04,714
<i>I don't know.
Give me a second, I'll figure it out.</i>

149
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:07,102
I've localized
the source of the energy reading.

150
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:09,425
It's coming from a hold on deck 9.

151
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:13,723
Keep trying to reach Atlantis.
We'll check it out.

152
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:27,481
<i>Sheppard, I think I've got something.</i>

153
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:29,773
It's the residual radiation
from the flash.

154
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:32,325
It's similar to what happens
when you open a hyperspace window,

155
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:35,445
<i>but different enough that the sensors
<i>wouldn't have picked it up.</i></i>

156
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:37,138
What the hell does that mean?

157
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:39,228
I think we're looking
at a new kind of drive.

158
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:40,870
You said we didn't go anywhere.

159
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,081
<i>We didn't. At least not according
to the ship's navigational systems.</i>

160
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:46,709
So, a malfunctioning drive?

161
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,430
<i>Maybe. Just hang on.</i>

162
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,937
My God, Sheppard...

163
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:02,303
Stand by.

164
00:10:02,423 --> 00:10:04,219
<i>No, you don't understand,
I know what it is.</i>

165
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:07,351
Look, the residual radiation.
It's exactly what we recorded

166
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:10,519
when my double arrived on Atlantis
from an alternate reality.

167
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,189
<i>I can't believe
I didn't see this before.</i>

168
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:16,327
<i>It's a drive all right, but it didn't
move us through space.</i>

169
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:18,662
I think it's moved us
into a parallel universe.

170
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:22,283
That would explain a lot of things.

171
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:40,502
How long have they been dead for?

172
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:42,825
This place was like a meat locker.

173
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:46,109
They could've been preserved
like this for months.

174
00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:50,381
- They look just like us.
- That's because they are us...

175
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:53,077
The alternate reality versions of us.

176
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:55,227
I feel like someone
just walked over my grave.

177
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:56,685
Everything's fine.

178
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:58,899
No, no, no, this is very bad.

179
00:10:59,019 --> 00:10:59,955
What?

180
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:02,750
Could this tablet belong
to the other McKay?

181
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,001
They weren't part of the original crew.
They came here just like us.

182
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:09,921
A ship appeared above their Atlantis,
they came to check it out.

183
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:12,174
That would explain
the other Jumper.

184
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,094
The ship jumped to another reality,
and they were stuck.

185
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:18,556
Eventually their supplies ran out,
and they...

186
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:20,924
All right, mystery solved.
Let's move on.

187
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,643
Don't you realize what this means?

188
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,062
They were us, and they failed.

189
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:28,899
They're not us.
We're still alive. Let's go.

190
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:40,913
The answer's in here somewhere.
Can you power up the systems?

191
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:43,860
Yeah, just hold on.

192
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:50,714
All right...

193
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:57,219
All right, that's a start.

194
00:11:57,631 --> 00:11:58,888
What's behind here?

195
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:03,167
That's a good question.

196
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:23,079
I'm guessing
that's our alternate reality drive.

197
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:25,774
Can you figure out how to control it?

198
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,875
Offhand, I'd say no.

199
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,338
That's what the other McKay
was trying to do, and he had... weeks.

200
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,758
Fine.

201
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:37,771
I'll start with his research.

202
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,470
It'll at least give us a head start.

203
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,597
That's better.
We're going to go look or supplies.

204
00:12:41,757 --> 00:12:43,431
The other us
wouldn't have tried that?

205
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:44,652
Get to work.

206
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:02,293
Did you find anything?

207
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:05,265
Not unless you know a way to cook this.

208
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,845
Perhaps we should consider going down
to the planet to collect supplies.

209
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:12,612
Sheppard says it's too risky.

210
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:14,899
The drive could kick in,
and the ship could take off.

211
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:16,719
Then we'd be stuck here.

212
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:20,819
The others that we found...

213
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:24,136
Do you think their lives
were very similar to ours?

214
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:25,357
Who cares?

215
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:28,629
How can you say that?

216
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:31,125
We've seen our doubles before.

217
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:34,397
Replicator-manufactured copies.

218
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:37,791
These were real people, with real lives.

219
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:40,005
I'm concern about
who might still be waiting for her

220
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,241
back on her Atlantis.

221
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:45,726
Do you mean, did she also have a son?

222
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:48,581
- The thought had crossed my mind.
- Look...

223
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,543
I've heard McKay talk
about this stuff before,

224
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:56,695
and supposedly, there's a million
different realities out there,

225
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,632
with every possible variation.

226
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,178
Which also means
there's a million different Torrens.

227
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,874
You going to worry
about every one of them?

228
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,819
No.

229
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,769
It's difficult enough
worrying about one.

230
00:14:11,788 --> 00:14:13,689
I'll bet it is.
Come on.

231
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,155
- Why is the blast door closed?
- Hello? Residual radiation?

232
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:29,736
Oh, right.

233
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:31,802
Have you made any progress?

234
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:33,937
As a matter of fact, yes, we have.

235
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:35,785
- We?
- Me and the other McKay,

236
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:38,190
who, unsurprisingly, is a genius.
Not only that,

237
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,842
but it looks like the drive
was created by yet another McKay

238
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:42,376
from the original reality.

239
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:44,848
- What makes you say that?
- Well, there's a certain...

240
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,849
elegance to the design that I recognize.

241
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:49,392
I'm sure that's what the crew was saying
when they abandoned ship.

242
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:53,397
Well, admittedly there are problems,
but it's still a monumental achievement.

243
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:57,107
So, what do we do?
Can we just throw this thing in reverse?

244
00:14:57,422 --> 00:15:00,055
Yeah, it's a little more
complicated than that.

245
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:01,630
The first problem is navigation.

246
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,716
They've developed a coordinate system
to identify the various realities

247
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:09,203
and allow them to get back,
but obviously that didn't work.

248
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:10,972
Obviously.

249
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:14,541
- That's not what bothers me.
- Well, it kind of bothers me.

250
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:16,268
It's power generation,

251
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:19,474
and jumping from one reality to another
requires massive amounts of power.

252
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,173
We're talking ZPM levels here.

253
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:23,896
Obviously they didn't have
one of those rattling around,

254
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:28,055
so they created a capacitor that's
constantly drawing power from subspace.

255
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:32,039
And it looks like it's almost charged.

256
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,928
Is this your long-winded way of telling
me you just can't turn it off?

257
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:38,686
Think of it like a tap,
pouring water into a bucket.

258
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:41,102
When the bucket is full,
the drive engages,

259
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:43,821
except this particular tap has no valve.

260
00:15:44,837 --> 00:15:47,286
That seems like a pretty serious
design flaw, don't you think?

261
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,845
Exactly. Which leads me to believe
they were tampering with it,

262
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:51,810
in a vain attempt
to generate more power.

263
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,043
As they got further and further
from their own reality,

264
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,427
I guess they figured
they needed to get back.

265
00:15:56,952 --> 00:15:59,084
And here we go.

266
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:07,188
Okay.

267
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:11,334
- Where are we?
- Don't look at me.

268
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:14,914
I haven't had time to route the main
systems to these control panels.

269
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,687
I'm flying blind down here.

270
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:20,721
- Ronon, Teyla, meet me at the bridge.
- <I>On our way.</I>

271
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:22,425
Keep it up, Rodney.

272
00:16:27,597 --> 00:16:29,353
Colonel, Atlantis is back.

273
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:31,572
I'm picking them up on the sensors.

274
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,281
You know how to work this stuff?

275
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:39,627
The last time the Daedalus was in orbit,
Major Marks generously offered

276
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:43,356
to give both of us
some preliminary training.

277
00:16:43,476 --> 00:16:46,337
- I was busy.
- Atlantis, this is Sheppard, come in.

278
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,953
Atlantis, do you read?

279
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,226
Atlantis, this is Sheppard, come in.

280
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,476
Maybe they already have a Sheppard.

281
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:04,568
Rodney, what are the odds of us

282
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:08,790
randomly jumping
back into our own reality?

283
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,852
<I>I'd say slim to none.</I>

284
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:13,573
I'm detecting another ship in orbit.

285
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:15,334
What kind?

286
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:17,872
I'll see if I can pull it up on screen.

287
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:23,039
I don't recognize it.

288
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:25,464
What's that?

289
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:31,870
- You know it?
- No.

290
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:35,497
Colonel, I believe
the ship is powering weapons.

291
00:17:36,784 --> 00:17:38,540
What's our shield status?

292
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,660
Minimal.

293
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,163
It's firing on Atlantis.

294
00:17:50,283 --> 00:17:52,169
The City's shields are failing.

295
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,785
Rodney, do we have enough juice
to power up the Asgard beam?

296
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:58,510
<I>Maybe. You might be able to get
a couple of shots off. Why?</I>

297
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,304
There's some alien ship
attacking Atlantis.

298
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:03,460
- <I>So?</I>
- What do you mean, "So?" It's Atlantis!

299
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:06,290
It's not our Atlantis.
We have no idea who's down there.

300
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,101
Look, we should just stay out of it.

301
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,509
If we do not intervene,
the City will be destroyed.

302
00:18:10,877 --> 00:18:13,131
Yeah, we need help.
My gut tells me we're better off

303
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:15,744
going with the people on that planet
than whoever's on that ship.

304
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:18,414
- <I>I hope you're right.</I>
- Yeah, well, me too.

305
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:32,489
The ship's been damaged.
It's stopped firing.

306
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:34,789
Hopefully we took out its main weapons.

307
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:36,493
Wait, something's happening.

308
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:39,799
They're launching fighters.

309
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:56,037
You should've took Marks up when you had
the chance. You'll have to learn fast.

310
00:18:56,157 --> 00:18:59,770
Rail-gun targeting systems.
Button's on the right.

311
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,188
Control, radar, tracking, and target
acquisition, use the red button to fire.

312
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:25,959
- What the hell was that?
- <I>We're under attack.</I>

313
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,086
Any chance of getting
that hyperdrive back online?

314
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:30,839
No, it's completely shot!
I already told you that!

315
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:32,257
Great.

316
00:19:38,158 --> 00:19:40,808
- They're too many. I can't do this.
- Keep trying!

317
00:20:01,948 --> 00:20:04,117
- We've lost sublight.
- We have a hull breach.

318
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:07,293
We're venting atmosphere.
I don't know what to do.

319
00:20:13,031 --> 00:20:15,412
Seal off damaged areas.
We should be okay for the moment.

320
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,093
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

321
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:21,223
Sheppard, I have an idea!

322
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,263
- Let's hear it.
- I've set up a few protocols

323
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:27,437
that should increase the efficiency
of the alternate reality drive.

324
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:30,594
If I enable them,
we might be able to jump sooner.

325
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:33,349
What, jump to the next universe?

326
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:34,469
<I>Exactly!</I>

327
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:36,822
<I>But if I do this, I can't undo it!</I>

328
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,615
I mean, we'll just start jumping
faster and faster!

329
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:44,705
Do it.

330
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:07,199
- It worked.
- Where are we?

331
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:10,828
We have a problem.

332
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:13,066
Temperature in the hull
is rising rapidly.

333
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,466
What the hell is this?

334
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,471
According to these readings,
we're less than two million kilometers

335
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:28,189
from the surface of the sun.

336
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:31,436
I thought we always jumped
to the same place in every reality.

337
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,500
As did I.

338
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,934
Hull temperature is
approaching critical.

339
00:21:38,054 --> 00:21:39,825
If we do not restore shields...

340
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:41,353
We're gonna burn.

341
00:21:45,026 --> 00:21:46,224
Are you sure about this?

342
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:49,019
Well, we're not imagining it, Rodney.

343
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:53,054
Let me transfer the sensors down
to the station. Then at least I can...

344
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:56,276
You're definitely not imagining that.


345
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,105
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- <I>I don't understand it.</I>

346
00:21:59,225 --> 00:22:01,531
<I>We always jump to the same</I>
<I>relative position in space.</I>

347
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:03,787
Unless...

348
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:05,421
<I>Unless what?</I>

349
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:08,354
You said when you went to the future,
you saw our sun

350
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:10,332
expanding into a red giant, remember?

351
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:13,069
- You saying we're jumping through time?
- <I>No, no, no,</I>

352
00:22:13,189 --> 00:22:15,937
but maybe what eventually happens
in our reality

353
00:22:16,057 --> 00:22:18,312
is happening in this one,
only much sooner.

354
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:21,051
Look, we didn't go to the sun.
The sun came to us.

355
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:23,695
So how does this help us?

356
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:25,449
I don't know.

357
00:22:25,806 --> 00:22:27,307
I just... I found it interesting.

358
00:22:28,118 --> 00:22:30,815
What's interesting, Rodney,

359
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:33,028
is a way out of this
without getting fried,

360
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:35,061
like getting sublight back on,

361
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:38,360
- so we can get the hell out of here.
- <I>Actually, I think our best bet</I>

362
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,994
is just to transfer as much power
as we can to the shields,

363
00:22:41,114 --> 00:22:43,125
and ride it out till the next jump.

364
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:44,877
Well, when does that happen?

365
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:47,128
The time the capacitor
takes to charge is different

366
00:22:47,248 --> 00:22:49,687
now that I've enacted
those new protocols.

367
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,151
You know...

368
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:52,829
I have no idea.

369
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,022
You're not exactly
selling the plan, Rodney.

370
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,880
<I>I have no idea how long it would take me
to fix the sublights either!</I>

371
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:01,380
I've got to run a diagnostic,
but theoretically,

372
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,794
transferring power to the shields
should be relatively easy.

373
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:05,971
All right, what do we do?

374
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,052
The first I need you to do
is head down to engineering.

375
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:10,268
Let's go.

376
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:24,816
All right, we're here.
What do we do?

377
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:27,824
You need to kill all power
to non-essential decks.

378
00:23:27,944 --> 00:23:30,620
Which means you're gonna have to access
the main administrative interface.

379
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:34,750
<I>That should bring up a list
of all available override commands.</I>

380
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,893
Got it.

381
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,368
<I>Okay.
So choose the command for life support.</I>

382
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:47,356
<I>You're gonna have to designate the decks
one by one.</I>

383
00:24:33,163 --> 00:24:34,867
I think that's all of them.

384
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:37,896
Dammit. That didn't buy us nearly
as much power as I would have thought.

385
00:24:38,488 --> 00:24:41,173
- There's got to be something else.
- <I>Right...</I>

386
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:45,070
All right, the ship has auxiliary power
modules for most of the main systems.

387
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:47,489
<I>Most likely they're depleted,
but if not, well,</I>

388
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:50,714
- <I>it might buy us a little more juice.</I>
- Well, there you go.

389
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,802
<I>What the hell was that?
Was it gunfire?</I>

390
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,103
Where's Ronon?

391
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:11,244
Keep working.

392
00:25:13,351 --> 00:25:14,351
Stay focused.

393
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:17,480
- <I>Tell me what to do next.</I>
- All right.

394
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:35,120
- You okay?
- Yeah.

395
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,789
Where the hell did he come from?

396
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,235
Check it out.

397
00:25:42,704 --> 00:25:45,308
It's the same symbol
that was on the alien ship.

398
00:25:46,624 --> 00:25:47,883
How'd he get onboard?

399
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:50,864
You know, they crashed into us,

400
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,637
penetrated our hull, remember?

401
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,347
- Think he did it on purpose?
- That's a good question.

402
00:26:05,135 --> 00:26:06,157
Let me try that...

403
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:14,206
That's it.
That's all of them.

404
00:26:14,588 --> 00:26:16,988
I must go help Colonel Sheppard
and Ronon. Good luck, Rodney.

405
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,365
<I>No, no, no, it's not enough!</I>

406
00:26:19,984 --> 00:26:21,014
What do you mean?

407
00:26:21,134 --> 00:26:22,863
Without sublights,
our orbit is decaying,

408
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:25,337
which means more radiation
slamming into the shields.

409
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,172
The alternate reality drive
is only charged to 70%.

410
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,675
Which means it'll never make 100
before the shields fail.

411
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:33,050
What do we do?
We have no more power.

412
00:26:34,778 --> 00:26:36,704
Just... Give me a second.

413
00:26:47,014 --> 00:26:49,569
Rodney, Colonel Sheppard
and Ronon are under attack.

414
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:53,114
All right, I got it.
Drop the shields.

415
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:54,866
- What?
<i>- Drop the shields,</i>

416
00:26:55,134 --> 00:26:58,661
I'll transfer all power to the drive.
Hopefully it'll be enough for a jump.

417
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:01,039
- Hopefully?
- <I>It is our only option,</I>

418
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:04,125
and every second we argue about it,
is less of a chance it's gonna work!

419
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:06,670
Very well.
Dropping shields.

420
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,488
Hull temperature is passing critical.

421
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:17,296
Okay, transferring power
to the drive now.

422
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:21,893
No, no, no.

423
00:27:22,384 --> 00:27:24,744
- <I>What is it?</I>
- it's not enough. It's only 98%!

424
00:27:27,171 --> 00:27:29,901
Rodney, the hull
is beginning to deteriorate.

425
00:27:33,189 --> 00:27:34,500
Come on, come on!

426
00:27:38,153 --> 00:27:39,703
That's it!
Sheppard, we're jumping!

427
00:27:57,649 --> 00:27:58,997
Nice work, Rodney.

428
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:02,600
You may want to hold off
on the congratulations.

429
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:04,102
Now what?

430
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:08,023
<I>I think I've overtaxed the drive.
Look, it's not completely blown, but</I>

431
00:28:08,463 --> 00:28:11,484
we've only a handful of jumps
before it's burned out.

432
00:28:11,644 --> 00:28:13,576
All right, then what happens?

433
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,651
If we haven't found
our way back by then,

434
00:28:15,771 --> 00:28:17,615
we will be stranded forever.

435
00:28:25,922 --> 00:28:27,426
What happened to the planet?

436
00:28:27,546 --> 00:28:30,358
Rodney believes that in this reality,
it was destroyed by an impact,

437
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:32,138
possibly millions of years ago.

438
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:34,222
All that remains is this asteroid field.

439
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:36,367
All right, I think I got something.

440
00:28:36,487 --> 00:28:38,482
It was staring me
in the face the whole time.

441
00:28:38,602 --> 00:28:41,225
- I was just too busy to notice it.
- What are you talking about?

442
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,643
See, my mistake was focusing
on the navigation system.

443
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,502
I should've known
it was never gonna work.

444
00:28:45,622 --> 00:28:48,401
- So, what, then?
- So in spectacular feat

445
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:50,113
of multi-dimensional mathematics,

446
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:52,690
I've discovered a way
to send the ship back along the path

447
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,403
it's previously traveled by passing
the navigation system altogether.

448
00:28:55,873 --> 00:28:58,907
Wait a minute. You're talking about
putting this thing in reverse?

449
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:02,737
- Exactly.
- I just suggested that two hours ago.

450
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:04,608
And naturally,
I dismissed it out of hand,

451
00:29:04,728 --> 00:29:06,925
but then I realized that,
including the original designer,

452
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,001
not one, but two versions of myself
have failed to make this thing work.

453
00:29:10,671 --> 00:29:13,317
I had to think not like me.
I had to think the opposite of me.

454
00:29:13,437 --> 00:29:16,424
- Doesn't get more opposite than you.
- I'll take that as a compliment.

455
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:19,554
- So can we get back or not?
- Well, not directly.

456
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,573
It's impossible to calculate

457
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,721
the relative position
of our original starting point

458
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:25,933
from where we are now,
but we can retrace our steps,

459
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:29,236
passing through each reality in turn
until we reach the right one.

460
00:29:29,356 --> 00:29:30,772
Wait, there's a slight problem.

461
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:33,232
We barely got
out of those realities alive.

462
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:37,217
If we do not restore the shields,
the radiation will kill us.

463
00:29:37,337 --> 00:29:38,405
Not necessarily.

464
00:29:38,565 --> 00:29:41,403
Look, we know that the ship carries
its momentum in real space

465
00:29:41,523 --> 00:29:42,866
from one reality to the next.

466
00:29:42,986 --> 00:29:45,989
Now, we may not have sublight engines,
but we do have maneuvering thrusters.

467
00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:47,772
You know, one long continuous burn

468
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:50,577
along the right trajectory, from now
until the next jump should be enough

469
00:29:50,697 --> 00:29:53,584
to allow us to establish a higher,
more stable orbit around the sun.

470
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:55,380
So the radiation will not affect us?

471
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:59,092
Well, I wouldn't go that far, but still,
it'll be... not quite as deadly?

472
00:30:00,094 --> 00:30:01,772
Okay.
That's it.

473
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:03,720
Course is already plotted.

474
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,641
What about those alien dudes?
They know we shot at them.

475
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:08,832
- Maybe they'll be gone.
- I wouldn't count on it.

476
00:30:08,952 --> 00:30:12,739
Time is passing at the same rate
in each of the realities, which means...

477
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:14,274
It hasn't been that long.

478
00:30:14,797 --> 00:30:18,111
To get past those aliens,
we're gonna need sublight engines,

479
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:19,996
and I'll need to fix them in time.

480
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:22,200
But you said
you don't know what's wrong with those.

481
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,535
I haven't had a chance to check it out.
I'm sorry, I can't do 10 things at once.

482
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,052
I already told you,
the drive is gonna burn out, soon.

483
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:30,490
We have to do something.

484
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:33,336
Who's to say
the next reality won't be even worse?

485
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:45,471
All right, all the modifications
to the drive are in place.

486
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,421
<I>Here we go.</I>

487
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,547
It worked.
You did it, Rodney.

488
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:08,912
<I>All right,
I'm gonna head up to engineering,</I>

489
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,161
get to work on the sublights.

490
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:17,253
- What's our status?
- Hull temperature is rising,

491
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:19,964
but not as rapidly as it did before.
I think we'll be okay.

492
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,760
So much for the frying pan.
Let's hope we make it through the fire.

493
00:31:28,447 --> 00:31:29,893
How is it coming?

494
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:31,436
Ah, it's not good.

495
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:35,443
The main systems are completely fried.
I'll have to do a full bypass.

496
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:37,738
- Can I be of assistance?
- I doubt it.

497
00:31:37,858 --> 00:31:38,743
Okay...

498
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:41,705
Oh, Jeez!

499
00:31:42,024 --> 00:31:43,171
What the...

500
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:51,261
Thanks.

501
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:54,790
Perhaps a separate diagnostic
of the auxiliary system might be useful.

502
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:58,076
Sure.

503
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,469
- I wanted to thank you, Rodney.
- For what?

504
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:09,206
For not giving up.

505
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,725
Oh, I know what this is.

506
00:32:13,502 --> 00:32:14,851
It's your first mission back.

507
00:32:14,971 --> 00:32:16,980
Look, I am not about
to let it be your last, okay?

508
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:21,734
Oh, no, that's what I was afraid of.

509
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:25,612
- What is it?
- The drive's charging a lot faster now.

510
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:28,950
Looks like the next jump's gonna
happen a lot sooner than we thought.

511
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:31,583
How's it coming
with the sublight engine?

512
00:32:31,703 --> 00:32:33,488
I'm gonna need a few minutes.

513
00:32:33,608 --> 00:32:36,165
- <I>Do we have a few more minutes?</I>
- I doubt it.

514
00:32:37,475 --> 00:32:40,503
Let's split rail gun positions.
I'll take forward, you take aft.

515
00:32:40,663 --> 00:32:44,299
- You think that'll make a difference?
- Without shields, probably not,

516
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:47,427
but we don't have much of a choice.

517
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:58,880
Where's the alien ship?

518
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:00,669
I'm not sure.

519
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:04,012
Well, maybe they left.

520
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:07,613
No such luck.
They're right behind us.

521
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:21,377
Fighters, closing in on our position.
How's it going down there?

522
00:33:21,497 --> 00:33:23,312
Look, just give me a second!

523
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:30,903
Okay, try it now.

524
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:38,519
That's it, I've got it!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

525
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:56,419
<I>How we doing?</I>

526
00:33:57,856 --> 00:33:59,067
They're gaining on us.

527
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:01,360
- Can you get us more speed?
- <I>There's not a chance!</I>

528
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,252
<I>I've barely got this thing working!
</I>

529
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,005
If we tax it any more,
we're gonna blow the whole system!

530
00:34:06,615 --> 00:34:08,448
Then we've got a real problem.

531
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:19,477
They're in weapons range.

532
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:23,022
- Return fire.
- I'm trying.

533
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:40,455
Easy, Chewie,
those buttons are your friends.

534
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:42,500
- Just keep trying.
- I'm trying!

535
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:48,214
That's it,
sublights are gone for good this time!

536
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:10,840
What the hell was that?

537
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:12,029
F-302s.

538
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:14,866
It's Atlantis.

539
00:35:34,692 --> 00:35:36,073
What's happening?

540
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:38,530
<I>Looks like we're getting
some help from some friends.</I>

541
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,084
Guess we bet on the right side
after all.

542
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:44,186
Daedalus, this is Lieutenant Colonel
John Sheppard, do you read?</I>

543
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,483
<I>Daedalus, do you read?</I>

544
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:53,988
Yeah, Daedalus.
This is Daedalus. Come in.

545
00:35:54,149 --> 00:35:56,073
<I>Who...
Who is this?</I>

546
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,463
It's a long story.

547
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:01,939
<i>Whoever you are, you saved our asses
when you took out their main weapons.</i>

548
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,040
<I>Figured the least we could do</I>
<I>is return the favor.</I>

549
00:36:04,575 --> 00:36:06,007
Much appreciated.

550
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,870
Sheppard...

551
00:36:15,713 --> 00:36:16,803
Oh, crap.

552
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,523
<I>Sorry about that.
One of 'em got through.</I>

553
00:36:28,683 --> 00:36:29,857
<I>Nice shooting, though.</I>

554
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,422
Oh, thanks.

555
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,216
<I>All right, looks like
that's the last of them.</I>

556
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:58,344
<I>So...
So, what happens now?</I>

557
00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:01,256
Well, we go our own ways.

558
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:02,723
<I>Just like that?</I>

559
00:37:03,545 --> 00:37:04,550
Pretty much.

560
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,864
<I>Well, the thing is...
we do have a few questions.</I>

561
00:37:07,984 --> 00:37:11,816
<I>See, the Daedalus we know
was destroyed two years ago</I>

562
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:15,448
- <I>in a battle with the replicators.</I>
- Sorry to hear that,

563
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:18,908
but this isn't exactly our Daedalus.

564
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,611
We're just borrowing it for a while.

565
00:37:21,731 --> 00:37:24,328
<I>Okay, I have no idea what that means.</I>

566
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:27,063
Like I said, it's a long story.

567
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:30,347
<I>All right, Daedalus, good luck.</I>

568
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:33,280
Thank you, Colonel, and one last thing,

569
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:35,840
it's been a pleasure.

570
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:39,062
You're obviously a man
of great integrity,

571
00:37:39,914 --> 00:37:43,556
and a dedicated commander,
and a very skilled pilot.

572
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:47,310
<I>Well, that's funny.
I was going to say the same to you.</I>

573
00:37:58,606 --> 00:38:00,919
All right.
The alien ship's gone.

574
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:03,052
I'm reading a planet
with no energy signatures.

575
00:38:03,172 --> 00:38:05,661
It's the first reality we jumped to.
One more, and we're home.

576
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:09,373
Let's get down to the hangar bay.

577
00:38:18,473 --> 00:38:19,713
All right...

578
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:29,440
I got shot!

579
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,399
- I thought we got 'em all.
- Apparently not.

580
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:47,370
- Think there's any more of them?
- We're not waiting around to find out.

581
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:55,839
Move, move, move!

582
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,769
The explosion's caused a hull breech.
Whole sections have been de-pressurized,

583
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:14,951
including the hangar bay!
We just lost the Jumpers!

584
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:18,025
Our stop is coming up, Rodney.
It's time to get off this train.

585
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:21,140
- Look, there's no way off.
- Once we jump into our own reality,

586
00:39:21,288 --> 00:39:23,321
Atlantis will detect us,
and they will send help.

587
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:25,783
We broke orbit to get away
from the fighters, remember?

588
00:39:26,517 --> 00:39:30,210
Look, we carry our momentum and position
in space from one reality to the next.

589
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,132
Which means, by the time we next jump,
we're gonna be half a million km out.

590
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:36,127
They're never gonna get to us in time!

591
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,047
We got C-4. We wait till we get back,
then we blow the drive.

592
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:43,846
That could work, or it could tear a hole
in the space-time continuum

593
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:46,511
not only killing us
but destroying the entire solar system!

594
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:49,682
Well, we'd better
think of something fast.

595
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,564
Another contact just appeared
on our screens.

596
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:03,404
- Was it the Daedalus?
- They're too far out for us to get IFF.

597
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:05,614
Well, try subspace.

598
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:09,368
Colonel Sheppard, do you read?

599
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,045
Colonel Sheppard, this is Major Lorne,
do you read?

600
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:17,093
- Was there a hyperspace window?
- No, sir.

601
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:19,011
They just appeared out of nowhere.

602
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:21,195
Well, it's got to be them.
Alert Mr. Woolsey.

603
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:23,335
Doc, you're with me.
Let's go, come on.

604
00:40:28,366 --> 00:40:31,245
All right, we should be
within radio range.

605
00:40:32,123 --> 00:40:33,684
Colonel Sheppard, come in.

606
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:37,242
Dr. McKay, this is Major Lorne.

607
00:40:37,362 --> 00:40:39,883
- Do you read?
- There's too much interference.

608
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:44,009
I'm picking up some kind
of energy reading.

609
00:40:44,418 --> 00:40:45,687
It's spiking.

610
00:40:53,592 --> 00:40:55,496
What the hell just happened?

611
00:40:56,635 --> 00:40:58,011
They disappeared.

612
00:40:58,131 --> 00:40:59,835
- What are you talking about?
- Well...

613
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:02,307
They're just gone.

614
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,826
Oh, wait a minute.

615
00:41:07,616 --> 00:41:10,513
- I'm picking up four lifesigns.
- Okay, where?

616
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:12,352
Dead ahead.

617
00:41:21,161 --> 00:41:23,037
Colonel Sheppard, is that you?

618
00:41:23,157 --> 00:41:25,678
<I>Major...</I>
<I>Nice of you to stop by.</I>

619
00:41:25,798 --> 00:41:28,682
<I>Kind of hard to get a cab</I>
<I>in this neighborhood.</I>

620
00:41:30,006 --> 00:41:31,006
Yes, sir.

621
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,631
How many jumps you think that drive
has left in it before it burns out?

622
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:47,056
Half a dozen, tops.
Then it'll be completely inert.

623
00:41:47,176 --> 00:41:51,074
Good. I'd hate to think of somebody else
getting trapped inside like we did.

624
00:41:51,194 --> 00:41:52,600
I've been thinking about that.

625
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,818
Now, true, the navigation system
was flawed to start,

626
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:57,935
but the basic principles of the drive
are fundamentally sound...

627
00:41:58,055 --> 00:42:00,135
- Forget it, Rodney.
- I've saved the relevant data.

628
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:02,427
Minor adjustments,
and I'd have this thing up and...

629
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:04,259
I said forget it.

630
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:06,485
Hey, look who's here.

631
00:42:07,479 --> 00:42:08,696
How's your shoulder?

632
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:11,574
It's pretty bad,
but, you know, better, thanks.

633
00:42:12,632 --> 00:42:14,034
Is it well enough to hold him?

634
00:42:17,366 --> 00:42:18,257
Really?

635
00:42:22,445 --> 00:42:23,779
Don't drop him.

636
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:25,045
Thank you.

637
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:32,595
Hey there, little guy.

638
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:35,135
I think he likes me.

639
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:37,224
- It suits you.
- You think so?

640
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,519
I think you'll make
an excellent father someday.

641
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:46,055
I've seen a lot of scary things
in my time,

642
00:42:46,175 --> 00:42:49,600
but that thought scares me the most.

643
00:42:51,894 --> 00:42:54,079
- Do you want to...
- I think so.

644
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,118
There you go, watch out...

645
00:42:58,266 --> 00:42:59,241
Right.
