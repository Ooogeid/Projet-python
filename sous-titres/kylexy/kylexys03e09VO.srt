00:00:03,112 --> 00:00:05,006
Is there a romantic interest
I'm not aware of?

3
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:06,111
Only Kyle.

4
00:00:07,694 --> 00:00:09,425
I've seen one of these symbols before.

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,178
Kyle has a ring with this on it.
He got it from his birth father.

6
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:13,252
Adam...

7
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:14,722
- something.
- Adam Baylin?

8
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,157
If Andy can't stay here,
then she has to move to Cleveland!

9
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:20,491
I know that's gonna be really hard
for you to deal with.

10
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:22,647
Everyone at Latnok seems genuine.
But...

11
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:24,466
I'm style not conviced about Cassidy.

12
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,419
Have you seen anyone
hanging around my office?

13
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,778
Actually, I caught Jessi in there
this morning.

14
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,215
I'm well aware of Jessi's gifts,

15
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:33,667
but I also know that
she's volatile and unpredictable.

16
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:37,503
- Her mother's not a friend of Latnok.
- What do you know about Sarah?

17
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:40,164
I foudn something,
in Cassidy's office.

18
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:42,541
- He has Sarah's ring.
- How?

19
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:45,048
I think he might have something
to do with her disappearance.

20
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:48,506
You can recall your experiences from
that night and examine your memories.

21
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:49,825
It's working!

22
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:51,535
I see something...

23
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:56,472
He killed her.
She's dead.

24
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:58,808
My mother is dead.

25
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,935
We need to find out
why he did it.

26
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:02,061
We will.

27
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,401
Hey, Jessi.
I didn't know you were here.

28
00:01:57,862 --> 00:01:58,951
What's wrong?

29
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,628
- It's okay.
- What happenned?

30
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:12,388
I heard you thrashing around.

31
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:14,258
It was just a bad dream.

32
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:16,463
It was terrible.

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,336
I was at Latnok, and...

34
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:22,767
I don't really remember...

35
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,501
It's over now.

36
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,839
Are you okay?

37
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:29,648
Thank you for checking on me.

38
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,052
It's...

39
00:02:45,152 --> 00:02:45,967
late.

40
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:48,326
We should get back to sleep.

41
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:53,832
Good night.

42
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:56,852

Listen, Josh... I know you're upset
about Andy leaving.

48
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,503
I've been walking around
with a pit in my stomach,

49
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:34,547
I can't eat,
I can't sleep.

50
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,715
And everytime
I think about her being gone...

51
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,370
Yes, but she's not, yet.

52
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,761
So don't waste your last few days
together, moping around.

53
00:03:41,284 --> 00:03:43,055
What am I suppose to do?

54
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:45,371
Give her a big send-off.

55
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:47,763
What are her favourite things?

56
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,127
G-Force.

57
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:53,202

Well, thank you, Mr. Wikipedia.

64
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,624
Have you seen any of them?

65
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:12,334
No.

66
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:14,642
We'll take you when
the new movie comes out.

67
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:17,409
You'll like the character Spock.
He's half-Vulcan, half-human.

68
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:18,308
Vulcan?

69
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:19,375
Alien race.

70
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:21,468
So, he's different
than everyone else.

71
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,410
He struggles to understand human
emotion. Sees the world from a

72
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,926
unique perspective.

73
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:28,753
Sounds interesting.

74
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,483
Our man from the pod can relate.

75
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,275
- Except Spock's got really big ears.
- Which I have out in the garage.

76
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,483
You own Spock ears?

77
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:39,508
Want to dig 'em up?

78
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:41,444
It'll impress Andy.
Come on.

79
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:58,580
Sorry. I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

80
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,924
That's not easy to do.

81
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:05,998
Something wrong?

82
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:07,393
Well...

83
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:08,715
I need to

84
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:10,531
talk to you about something.

85
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,438
I saw you the other night.

86
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,689
Kissing Jessi.

87
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:20,569
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:23,143
No, you don't need to apologize.

89
00:05:23,243 --> 00:05:25,126
The two of you have shared so much.

90
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:26,518
You have a unique bond.

91
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,953
It's not that surprising that
you'd be attracted to each other.

92
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,630
It is, to me.

93
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,577
I mean,

94
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:35,445
Jessi's always been really
important to me, but...

95
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:39,489
these new feelings, I...
just don't how to deal with them.

96
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,355
Those feelings are confusing enough

97
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:44,064
for ordinary teenagers
living in separate houses.

98
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:47,137
It's so much more complicated
for the two of you.

99
00:05:47,986 --> 00:05:49,014
So, what do we do?

100
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:52,061
You may not like it, but...

101
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:53,711
you and Jessi live here

102
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,437
together, as part of our family.

103
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:59,233
And for you to pursue
that kind of relationship,

104
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:01,318
well, it's just
not appropriate.

105
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:05,906
I'm sorry, Kyle. I haven't set this
kind of boundary with you before.

106
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:07,574
It won't happen again.

107
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:08,956
Thank you.

108
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:11,537
I don't want either
of you to be hurt.

109
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:14,194
And you know
how fragile Jessi is.

110
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:21,658
I just signed for this.

111
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:25,035
What is it?

112
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,783
The label not clear enough
for you, mate?

113
00:06:35,971 --> 00:06:37,363
I've got a new project for you.

114
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,411
I want you to team up with Kyle.

115
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:41,942
Seriously?

116
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:45,444
Yeah. It's the formula
for a growth accelerant.

117
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:47,522
We've been trying
to crack it for months.

118
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:49,907
I think the two of you
can make some headway.

119
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:51,723
I don't want to work with him.

120
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:52,893
Ask Jessi.

121
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:54,893
No, that ain't gonna happen.

122
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:56,457
I need someone I can trust.

123
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,442
Besides,

124
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,034
play nicely with Kyle,

125
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:03,797
and you might make progress
with that chick you're seeing.

126
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,676
I'll e-mail you the assignment.

127

00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,716
That's right.

136
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:59,013
- We were just...
- Tell you what.

137
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:00,227
Sibling benefit.

138
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:01,939
Ten minutes. Start slurping.

139
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:09,530
This may be one of the few
places we can be alone together.

140
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:12,743
What?

141
00:08:13,272 --> 00:08:15,619
Did you listen in on me
and Nicole this morning?

142
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:17,768
Yes,

143
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:20,332
and I don't think
it's any of her business.

144
00:08:21,063 --> 00:08:22,624
We live in her house.

145
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:24,294
We're part of her family.

146
00:08:25,512 --> 00:08:26,352
So...

147
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:28,507
kissing me
meant nothing to you?

148
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:35,139
Of course it meant
something to me.

149
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:38,100
Then how could you not
want to be together?

150
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,552
Kyle, when you kissed me, I felt

151
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:44,161
such a rush
through my entire body.

152
00:08:44,486 --> 00:08:45,607
Didn't you feel it?

153
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:52,114
Is it me, or are you getting a vibe?

154
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,528
Trying not to.

155
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:56,617
But they're definitely sitting at least
two inches closer than they used to.

156
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:59,231
- You don't think they're...?
- God, I don't wanna talk about it.

157
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,072
- Can we talk about something else?
- Absolutely.

158
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,627
So, how goes things
with you and Nate?

159
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:08,006
- Good.
- That's great.

160
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:12,038
You don't like him.

161
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,429
I don't really know him.
How well do you?

162
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,365
It's still really new.

163
00:09:19,412 --> 00:09:21,746
I guess he doesn't talk
about himself too much.

164
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:24,308
I don't want to dump on what
could be a really good thing for you.

165
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:25,824
I just want you to be careful.

166
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:27,918
Make sure you can trust
this guy, that's all.

167
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:32,595
- How's it going?
- Good.

168
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:34,865
Is Kyle around?

169
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:38,035
He's back there. Why?

170
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,622
I just want to partner up
on a project with him.

171
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,416
That's really nice.

172
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:45,924
Well,

173
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:47,149
see you later?

174
00:09:57,757 --> 00:09:59,417
Am I interrupting anything?

175
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:05,520
So Cassidy's got something for us
to work on together. You up for it?

176
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:07,329
You and me?

177
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:09,858
Why didn't Cassidy ask me
to work with Kyle?

178
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:13,301
I don't know.

179
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:14,868
He doesn't like you.

180
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:25,341
Fine.

181
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,352
Good.

182
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:28,913
You'll have another chance
to impress me.

183
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,421
We can't be together
at Latnok either.

184
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,882
We can't let Cassidy know
we suspect anything.

185
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:35,995
We can't cause any trouble.

186
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,866
If he wants me and Nate to work
together, we have to go along with it.

187
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:41,886
Time's up. Get out.

188
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:52,720
Hey, you're home early.

189
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,571
- Where's Kyle?
- At Latnok, without me.

190
00:10:57,494 --> 00:10:58,991
I'm not as fragile as you think.

191
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:02,348
You don't understand how much
Kyle means to me.

192
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:04,871
I know how close
you feel to him.

193
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,582
Nobody cares
about me like he does.

194
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:10,961
No one makes me feel
as happy or as safe.

195
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:12,872
I need that.

196
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:14,171
I need him.

197
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:17,032
Kyle can still be there for you.

198
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:20,053
But while you're both living in
this house, he can't be with you,

199
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,722
not in that way.

200
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:28,729
I need to know why you
have a problem with Jessi.

201
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:31,669
She...

202
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:34,239
She was poking around
in here the other day.

203
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:36,528
I think she may have
broken into my safe.

204
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,687
Why would she do that?

205
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,973
I was hoping you could tell me.

206
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:43,281
I don't know anything about it.

207
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:46,621
Well, did you know that after
your mother's car accident,

208
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:48,106
Jessi said to me

209
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:52,124
that if I ever harmed you
or your family,

210
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:53,886
she'd kill me.

211
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,181
She was just being protective.

212
00:11:58,281 --> 00:12:00,052
She could never
do anything like that.

213
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,744
Really?

214
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:04,375
Jessi is a good person.

215
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,684
She's certainly lucky
to have a friend like you.

216
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:11,563
I'm just not sure you know
who you're really dealing with.

217
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:15,192
Is that all?

218
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:33,024
You scared me.

219
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:34,503
I owe you a few.

220
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,517
What are you doing?

221
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:40,335
Reading you.

222
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,105
What?

223
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:45,347
I know the look when a girl
has a boy on her mind.

224
00:12:49,463 --> 00:12:51,378
- What?
- You tell me.

225
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,563
You can't keep those kinds
of secrets in this house.

226
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,361
Kyle kissed me.

227
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:03,911
Wait a second, clarify.
Did he actually kiss you?

228
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,422
- Or did you throw yourself at him?
- He kissed me.

229
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:08,245
There was no throwing involved.

230
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,834
Why does everyone
think that's so wrong?

231
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:16,513
Because it's Kyle,
of the

232
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:19,881
pure and beautiful soul.
We only want what's best for him.

233
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,794
- Which means not me.
- No.

234
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:22,820
Get out.

235
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:23,867
Get out!

236
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:35,647
God, I hate myself sometimes.
Why do I say cruel things to people?

237
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:38,358
To Declan, Hillary or Jessi?

238
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:42,060
Jessi was the lucky recipient.
But I couldn't help it.

239
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:45,700
Am I supposed to ignore that the two of
you were huddled up at The Rack today?

240
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,507
- Huddled up?
- We were just talking.

241
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:48,660
Sharing secrets.

242
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:53,147
What kind of secrets?

243
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:56,502
Have anything to do with Latnok?

244
00:13:57,235 --> 00:14:00,005
Yes. Most of the students there
have been great.

245
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,048
It's Cassidy I need
to know more about.

246
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,341
So I have to make him
believe I'm on his side.

247
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:06,136
You need an olive branch.

248
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:07,345
An overture.

249
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,847
Ask him out to dinner.

250
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:10,932
Invite him here.

251
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,345
If you want him to believe
he's winning you over,

252
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:15,357
a dinner invitation
from your parents...

253
00:14:15,457 --> 00:14:17,346
I'd like to meet this guy anyway.

254
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:18,982
I don't want him in this house.

255
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,234
You're not doing this
unless we're part of it.

256
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:25,947
- You and Josh shouldn't be here.
- But I want to be.

257
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,742
You make Cassidy too uncomfortable.

258
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,422
Why is everybody shutting me out?

259
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:34,039
I haven't done anything wrong.

260
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:36,240
You don't want me around either.

261
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,569
You know that's not true.

262
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,025
You know what? I won't
bother any of you anymore.

263
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:55,430
You'd better leave the door open.

264
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,848
You know,

265
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:08,848
what we're doing with Cassidy
is all about you.

266
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:14,661
I'm trying to figure out
why Sarah was killed,

267
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:16,444
and I need him to trust me.

268
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:21,062
So if he wants to drive a wedge
between us, we have to let him.

269
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,965
I just hate how everyone's looking at me
like I'm this horrible person.

270
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,716
Nobody in the family does.

271
00:15:27,412 --> 00:15:29,886
And you shouldn't care
what Cassidy thinks about.

272
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:35,412
Fine.

273
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,171
Have your dinner.
I'll stay away.

274
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,208
Jessi, I need to know that
you're committed to this.

275
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:50,457
I have to trust that you can
keep things under control.

276
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:52,617
Don't you know me
well enough to be sure?

277
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:55,787
I just don't want any surprises.

278
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,117
Lori,

279
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:06,983
I need you to help me with something.
But you'll have to keep it a secret.

280
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,310
Espionage?

281
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,523
All over it.

282
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:13,263
- So what's my mission?
- I need to know more about Cassidy.

283
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:17,783
I think we should adjust
the floor value here.

284
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:20,054
Too many ideal elements.

285
00:16:20,154 --> 00:16:23,350
The algorithm lost stability
about three adjustments ago.

286
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:24,696
You're right.

287
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,305
Easy to miss.

288
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,196
Apparently, not for you.

289
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:33,965
Cassidy teamed us up.
He must think you can contribute.

290
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,828
Cassidy just wants us to get along.

291
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,712
I know he supervises everything,

292
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:41,328
but have you ever seen him
report to anybody?

293
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:42,667
Why do you ask?

294
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:44,002
Curious.

295
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,055
Well, I have no idea
who he answers to.

296
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:53,055
All those senior Latnok guys, they're
all cloak and dagger, minus the dagger.

297
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:54,962
Right.

298
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:00,694
So, what do we got?

299
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:07,637
Maybe if we adjust the values
in this sequence here...

300
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:17,724
That's it.

301
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:20,956
Cassidy's had people working on this for months

302
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,838
and you solved it.
Just like that.

303
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:25,394
We solved it.

304
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,764
I guess we're done.

305
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,135
Kyle!

306
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:38,909
I wanted to thank you.

307
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:40,161
For what?

308
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:42,120
For making an effort with Nate.

309
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:43,852
It means a lot to me.

310
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:47,023
I just want you to be happy, Amanda.

311
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,707
I want the same for you.

312
00:18:15,982 --> 00:18:18,641
So, what's this big surprise?
G- Force marathon?

313
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:20,848
Give me more credit than that.

314
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:23,479
- Well, show me already.
- Not yet.

315
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:25,713
Still gotta kick out
a couple of paying customers

316
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,342
so I can reap benefits that come
with minimum wage authority.

317
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:31,026
It turns me on
when you go crazy with power.

318
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:32,940
Just give me a minute.

319
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:37,879
Whatever it is, he hasn't
stopped working on it.

320
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,807
Yeah, he's such a cute worker bee
when he puts his mind to something.

321
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:44,608
All right, guys, time's up.

322
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:50,937
Makes me sad to think his ambition
might stop when I leave.

323
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:53,071
I don't know about that.

324
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,996
He's already offered to take
half of my shifts next week.

325
00:18:57,326 --> 00:19:00,532
I think he wants to stay busy
so he doesn't miss you as much.

326
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:04,976
I'm sorry, did I say something?

327
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:08,469
No, it's fine.
It's just...

328
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,228
My moms changed our plans.

329
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:15,342
We're not leaving in three days.

330
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:17,989
We're leaving in the morning.

331
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:21,581
And Josh doesn't know?

332
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:24,871
This is our last night together.

333
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:37,967
- Mrs. Trager, I presume.
- Mr. Cassidy.

334
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,641
It's Michael, please.

335
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:41,178
These are for you.

336
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:42,566
They're beautiful.

337
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,665
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

338
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:47,963
- Stephen Trager.
- Pleasure, sir.

339
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:51,105
- Kyle, how you doing, man?
- Hello.

340
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:54,109
It smells ridiculously
delicious in here.

341
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,319
Don't let that fool you.

342
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,801
- Can I get you a drink?
- I'd love one. Thank you.

343
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,784
You know what it is?

344
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,722
Give a girl a minute.

345
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:19,689
The lights, like little stars,

346
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,709
shiny surfaces.

347
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:26,987
It feels very... futuristic.

348
00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:30,018
An interesting observation, Miss Jensen.

349
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:33,724
Oh, my God.

350
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:36,192
I loveStar Trek.

351
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,530
I wanted to give you
something really special.

352
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:45,547
You did.

353
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:48,949
- So you know what to do?
- The mission is clear.

354
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:51,883
- You love this, don't you?
- Nothing like a little intrigue

355
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:53,877
and reconnaissance
to light up the night.

356
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,898
Here they come. Hey!

357
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,537
- Sorry. Too much?
- Yeah, a little. A tad.

358
00:21:00,637 --> 00:21:02,177
Just, uh, act natural.

359
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:08,182
We just bumped into each other.

360
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,633
So did we.

361
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,187
I mean, we were both here

362
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,814
waiting for you, separately.
And then we decided

363
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:18,006
to sit at this table.
Here at The Rack.

364
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:22,363
And we're all here now, so you guys
want to hang out for a few?

365
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,684
- Great.
- Fantastic.

366
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:30,888
Hi.

367
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:37,337
This is wonderful.
Thank you.

368
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,420
I haven't had a good home-cooked meal
in I don't even know how long.

369
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,092
Where is home, Mr. Cassidy?

370
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:44,761
Brooklyn.

371
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:47,953
OK.

372
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:52,273
Uh, England. East London.

373
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:54,275
Little town called Hackney.

374
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,945
Still have family there?

375
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:57,697
We've scattered.

376
00:21:58,223 --> 00:22:01,213
But I love Seattle.
And my work keeps me busy, so...

377
00:22:02,326 --> 00:22:04,405
Kyle tells us you're not a scientist.

378
00:22:04,735 --> 00:22:07,617
No. I'm definitely missing that gene.

379
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:10,848
So, what exactly is
your contribution at Latnok?

380
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,041
I foster. I encourage.
Basically, I'm a professional nag.

381
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,300
Kyle can attest to my persistence.

382
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,990
Yes, I can.

383
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:22,186
I think we'd all like to hear
what's expected of Kyle.

384
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,137
- Jessi, what are you doing here?
- I live here.

385
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:30,765
I thought you had plans
to be out tonight.

386
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,183
I changed my mind.

387
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:34,560
Well, we were just having dinner.

388
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,792
Great.

389
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:38,523
Is there a place for me?

390
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,151
- Of course there is.
- I'll get you a plate.

391
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:04,741
It must be exciting to have two minds
like Kyle's and Jessi's in the mix.

392
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,301
Oh, thrilling! Thrilling.

393
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,588
Kyle's a natural-born leader.

394
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,476
And Jessi shows great potential.

395
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,695
This brownie is amazing.

396
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,490
So good you want
to save some for later.

397
00:23:34,054 --> 00:23:35,693
My cobbler's pretty great.

398
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:37,271
Want some?

399
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:39,792
Trager doesn't eat cooked fruit.

400
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:46,507
So, what are you guys doing later?

401
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:49,962
Whatever it is,
we can't go back to my house.

402
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,282
I've been banished.

403
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:54,606
Your boss, Cassidy, is over for
dinner with Kyle and my parents.

404
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:56,162
He's not our boss.

405
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:57,894
I thought he called the shots.

406
00:24:02,342 --> 00:24:05,568
Oh, I get it. What happens
at Latnok, stays at Latnok.

407
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:07,737
That's right, top secret.

408
00:24:08,043 --> 00:24:11,407
No, we like to keep
the details confidential, but...

409
00:24:14,377 --> 00:24:16,782
I think I can trust you.

410
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,251
Cassidy's in charge,
but we have tons of freedom.

411
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:25,709
He knows when to help
and when to get out of our way.

412
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:27,843
So you like working with him?

413
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:29,008
He's fine.

414
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:32,970
Yeah, whatever. He's, um...
You know, we should get going

415
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,373
- if we're gonna catch a movie.
- No!

416
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:38,687
I mean, I wanna try your cobbler.

417
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:49,548
You used to dream about Mr. Spock?

418
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:52,176
In my mind, we were dating.

419
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:55,676
I was only 12, rember?
It was innocent.

420
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:59,168
We'd do things like eat cotton
candy and play foosball

421
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:01,165
at the International Space Station.

422
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:07,130
Three days before you leave,
and you pull out this great goofy stuff.

423
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,989
Josh...

424
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:12,494
Thank you.

425
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:14,875
For what?

426
00:25:16,442 --> 00:25:19,142
I just don't think I've said it enough.

427
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:22,520
You've been so great.

428
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:26,755
I haven't been the typical
first girlfriend and

429
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:28,886
you've always been there for me.

430
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,855
Through everything.

431
00:25:31,955 --> 00:25:33,958
And I have to tell you...

432
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:35,303
Stop.

433
00:25:36,716 --> 00:25:38,468
No heartfelt goodbyes.

434
00:25:38,974 --> 00:25:41,372
We still have plenty of time for that.

435
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,423
- Yeah, but...
- No buts.

436
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:46,175
Tonight is about you and me

437
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,337
in our own private universe.

438
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:53,272
You want to go where
no man has gone before?

439
00:25:53,674 --> 00:25:55,761
Or just once before?

440
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,964
How long have you been
waiting to say that?

441
00:25:59,064 --> 00:26:00,433
All night long.

442
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,850
Michael,

443
00:26:11,643 --> 00:26:15,727
you know, Kyle and Jessi share very
unusual backgrounds.

444
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:17,779
Two peas in a pod, so to speak.

445
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:21,496
Yes. We've tried to keep
their lives very private.

446
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,665
My biggest concern is that
they always stay protected.

447
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,019
Absolutely.

448
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:30,588
Look, my apologies for Latnok's
regrettable actions on prom night.

449
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,490
- Regrettable is putting it mildly.
- Fair enough.

450
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,800
But let me assure you,
from this point forward,

451
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,302
Kyle and Jessi's well being
is always at the forefront.

452
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,962
You know what I'd like to hear about?

453
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:45,021
My mother.

454
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,355
- Jessi.
- What?

455
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:50,361
- He must know Sarah.
- I've heard of her.

456
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:51,629
Brilliant woman.

457
00:26:52,982 --> 00:26:54,570
So you've never met?

458
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,704
Never had the pleasure.

459
00:26:56,804 --> 00:26:57,740
Really.

460
00:26:58,034 --> 00:26:59,934
Jessi, you know she's been
in hiding for years.

461
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:01,604
She wants nothing
to do with Latnok.

462
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:02,735
That's right.

463
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:04,331
She didn't trust you.

464
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,568
She never met me.

465
00:27:08,774 --> 00:27:10,249
It's Latnok she had...

466
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:11,837
has a problem with.

467
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:16,509
Nate and I finished
that project for you.

468
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,090
So soon? Great.

469
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,953
You must be working well together.

470
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:23,808
- He was very helpful.
- What was the project about?

471
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,963
We don't know anything about this guy
and he's here having dinner.

472
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:29,101
- Jessi.
- He doesn't trust me?

473
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,535
- I don't trust him.
- Jessi, please.

474
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:33,276
He's done terrible things.

475
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:36,089
- What are you talking about?
- You're a liar!

476
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:37,363
You have secrets.

477
00:27:41,157 --> 00:27:42,859
Maybe we should tell this family

478
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:45,322
about the secret you've
been keeping from them.

479
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:50,248
I think it's beholden upon me

480
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:53,045
to tell you what sort of person
you have living under your roof.

481
00:27:56,783 --> 00:27:59,260
You remember that first night, Jessi.

482
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:02,847
After the explosion...

483
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:07,393
...you found your way out of the pod

484
00:28:07,775 --> 00:28:09,270
and left Zzyzx.

485
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:12,315
You took a little wander
in the woods.

486
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,193
You came across a man camping.

487
00:28:17,116 --> 00:28:18,002
No.

488
00:28:19,178 --> 00:28:20,531
A stranger to you.

489
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,074
Please stop.

490
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:23,826
And you killed him.

491
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:33,127
An hour out of the pod,
and she murdered someone.

492
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:37,401
I'm afraid that's
the sort of person that she is.

493
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:42,181
It's in her nature.

494
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:45,765
Jessi, what is he saying?

495
00:28:49,877 --> 00:28:51,270
I have the news reports.

496
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,392
- The murder's still unsolved.
- I didn't murder him.

497
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:57,485
- He had a knife.
- Then it's true?

498
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,599
No. I was alone.
I was scared.

499
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:02,365
He tried to attack me.

500
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:05,198
- Oh, my God.
- I'm not a killer!

501
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:08,926
I'm not a killer.

502
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:12,855
Jessi! Jessi!

503
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,133
Wait!

504
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:33,833
I'm terribly sorry.

505
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:37,151
I hate to drop
news like that on you.

506
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:38,880
I just can't believe it.

507
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:42,279
It's a lot to take in.
But I do feel I had to tell you.

508
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:45,528
We've been concerned about
Jessi for quite some time.

509
00:29:46,011 --> 00:29:48,619
Knowing that she's here
with your family now...

510
00:29:51,552 --> 00:29:53,959
I don't think any
of us want someone so...

511
00:29:54,588 --> 00:29:55,887
...unpredictable

512
00:29:55,987 --> 00:29:57,691
getting closer to Kyle.

513
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:00,278
Are you OK?

514
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:03,732
She was so upset.

515
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,763
I just hope she's all right.

516
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:10,297
This is why he's extraordinary.

517
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,394
He's only concerned about her.

518
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:18,196
So is it off-limits,

519
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:21,441
or can you tell us what you're
working on at Latnok now?

520
00:30:23,035 --> 00:30:27,334
Unbelievable. What's with
this super perky friendly routine?

521
00:30:29,158 --> 00:30:31,495
I'm showing interest.
I'm being nice.

522
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,355
That's so not like you.

523
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:37,261
I think it's sweet that you're
trying to connect with me

524
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:40,773
- as Declan's ex-girlfriend.
- See? I'm sweet.

525
00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:42,483
I'm trying to connect.

526
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:45,143
And in answer to your question, I've

527
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:48,095
got a bunch of new ideas,
too soon to discuss.

528
00:30:48,536 --> 00:30:50,680
You have to run them by Cassidy?

529
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,897
Why all this interest in Cassidy?

530
00:30:54,975 --> 00:30:57,229
I just want
to get a sense of your life.

531
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,604
I don't like him.

532
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,370
He didn't want me
to date you at first,

533
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,244
and he didn't exactly threaten me,

534
00:31:05,344 --> 00:31:08,667
but we got pretty close
to Don Corleone territory.

535
00:31:09,894 --> 00:31:12,077
- The guy creeps me out.
- How weird.

536
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,085
Kyle,

537
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,044
I know tonight didn't
work out the way we'd hoped.

538
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:26,291
We all want the best for Jessi.
But clearly,

539
00:31:26,828 --> 00:31:28,427
she's a very troubled girl.

540
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:33,420
And you've spent an excessive
amount of time being her anchor.

541
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,271
That has got to be draing.

542
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:36,941
She's my friend.

543
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,687
I'd do anything for her.

544
00:31:40,177 --> 00:31:41,590
You're a good man.

545
00:31:43,095 --> 00:31:45,903
I just don't want her instability
jeopardize your future.

546
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:49,378
We never had a chance
to talk about that...

547
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:50,791
I'd still like to.

548
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:52,743
Maybe we can meet later.

549
00:31:54,547 --> 00:31:55,829
That would be wonderful.

550
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,200
The Rack?

551
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,457
Half an hour?

552
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,226
Sounds like a plan.

553
00:32:11,511 --> 00:32:12,419
OK,

554
00:32:12,621 --> 00:32:15,013
- the coast is clear.
- I always pictured the fairy-tale

555
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:18,322
ending to the perfect date as me
climbing through your sister's window.

556
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,061
I wish I could beam you up
to maintain the theme of our evening.

557
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:24,875
Anyway, let's move.

558
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:27,278
Yes, sir.

559
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,210
He's coming.

560
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,025
Dad!

561
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:36,203
How's it going?

562
00:32:37,008 --> 00:32:39,039
Is Star Trek night over already?

563
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:41,503
What happened?
Did you get mopey again?

564
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:43,183
No, it was great.

565
00:32:43,283 --> 00:32:46,526
You were right. Andy loved
the whole super-galactic send-off.

566
00:32:46,626 --> 00:32:48,674
- Genius idea.
- Then why...?

567
00:32:51,574 --> 00:32:53,275
Let me explain.

568
00:32:53,575 --> 00:32:55,556
Josh, I can't believe you...

569
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:01,520
...look so tired.

570
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,710
I'll go tell your mother
that you're home

571
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,152
and that you're going
straight to bed.

572
00:33:15,688 --> 00:33:16,577
To sleep.

573
00:33:28,954 --> 00:33:30,392
So this is it.

574
00:33:30,492 --> 00:33:31,475
My domain.

575
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:35,538
You must study a lot.

576
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:38,734
There's always someone studying more.

577
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:41,466
Why do you make
everything a competion?

578
00:33:43,394 --> 00:33:44,425
Direct.

579
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:45,689
Sorry.

580
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,683
No, I think I need that.

581
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:49,693
You should call me on my stuff.
It's good.

582
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,364
Can I get you anything?

583
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,307
I could use a soda.

584
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,248
Machine's right downstairs.

585
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:45,379
Your beverage, milady.

586
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:46,575
Thank you.

587
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:49,712
- You OK?
- Fine.

588
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:54,491
Hello?

589
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:57,368
Is anyone here?

590
00:35:00,172 --> 00:35:01,182
Kyle?

591
00:35:06,514 --> 00:35:07,339
Jessi.

592
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:09,658
Where is everyone?

593
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,916
We closed early.

594
00:35:23,324 --> 00:35:25,706
- I don't know what it is you want.
- The truth.

595
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:27,734
I know you killed Sarah.

596
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:29,267
Why?

597
00:35:29,987 --> 00:35:31,115
Sarah left.

598
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,379
Now I'm sorry she couldn't
handle being your mother.

599
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:36,816
Don't you dare speak
of her that way.

600
00:35:37,423 --> 00:35:38,909
She didn't leave me,

601
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:40,721
you killed her.

602
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,400
You need help.

603
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,713
Actually,

604
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:45,318
I think you do.

605
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,912
See what's happening to the water?

606
00:35:51,393 --> 00:35:52,733
I can do that to you.

607
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:59,656
I can manipulate the
blood flow in your body.

608
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,493
- What?
- I can target certain areas

609
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:05,913
and make the vessels
expand and contract.

610
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,624
- Jessi, listen...
- Why did she have to die?

611
00:36:10,158 --> 00:36:11,752
I suggest that you answer me.

612
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:14,845
You don't want to accept
that Sarah left.

613
00:36:15,295 --> 00:36:16,888
I had nothing to do with it!

614
00:36:27,053 --> 00:36:28,394
What are you doing?

615
00:36:31,009 --> 00:36:31,834
Stop!

616
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:33,089
Don't!

617
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:39,656
You need to calm down.

618
00:36:39,756 --> 00:36:41,240
He murdered my mother!

619
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,197
Stay out of it.

620
00:36:47,649 --> 00:36:49,552
It didn't happen that way.

621
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:54,062
What are you saying?

622
00:37:00,371 --> 00:37:02,719
You want the truth?
Sarah attacked me.

623
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:03,719
What?

624
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:06,447
She saw me that night!
She knew I was Latnok.

625
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:08,755
She was gonna kill me.
She lost it!

626
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:11,077
I was protecting myself.
I had no choice.

627
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:12,271
You're lying.

628
00:37:12,952 --> 00:37:14,630
I can tell that you're lying.

629
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,037
It makes no sense.

630
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:19,933
You need to tell her what's going on.

631
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:27,898
Baylin's experiment,

632
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:30,530
prolonged gestation in a pod.
We're starting it up again.

633
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,820
The experiment.

634
00:37:32,562 --> 00:37:33,927
Why would you do that?

635
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:35,531
I'm looking at the reason,

636
00:37:36,477 --> 00:37:37,797
you're a success.

637
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:40,316
Sarah found out.

638
00:37:42,258 --> 00:37:43,720
She didn't approve.

639
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,483
So you killed her!

640
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,268
You took everything from me!

641
00:37:47,368 --> 00:37:48,891
My mother! And now Kyle!

642
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:52,594
Jessi, don't!

643
00:37:53,014 --> 00:37:55,472
You know what I did. You can't
even look at me anymore.

644
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:56,690
That's not true.

645
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:58,572
We can get through this.

646
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:00,860
No. It doesn't matter anymore.

647
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,285
I'm already a murder.

648
00:38:14,155 --> 00:38:15,243
Speak to me.

649
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:25,649
- Kyle, she's...
- No, don't say it!

650
00:38:38,915 --> 00:38:40,481
Please.
It didn't work.

651
00:38:41,437 --> 00:38:42,947
Jessi, please! Breathe!

652
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,685
Kyle, I got nothing, man.

653
00:38:45,785 --> 00:38:46,932
I got nothing.

654
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,604
Come on, we gotta
get out of here.

655
00:38:50,532 --> 00:38:52,120
We gotta get out of here.

656
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,287
- I won't leave her.
- Kyle, you can't be here.

657
00:38:54,387 --> 00:38:55,677
You can't be here, man.

658
00:38:55,777 --> 00:38:56,728
I'm sorry.

659
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,675
They're gone.

660
00:39:23,587 --> 00:39:24,653
Are you all right?

661
00:39:24,956 --> 00:39:28,125
I slowed my heartbeat down
to two beats per minute.

662
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:32,202
And it was strangely relaxing.

663
00:39:33,347 --> 00:39:34,416
You better go.

664
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:39,675
Nicole's waiting for you at home.

665
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:43,218
Do you think we convinced Cassidy?

666
00:39:44,305 --> 00:39:46,573
But he'll send people
to clean up the mess.

667
00:39:46,922 --> 00:39:49,161
Won't they tell him
they didn't find my body?

668
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:51,987
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

669
00:40:14,442 --> 00:40:16,114
I'm so happy you're home.

670
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,756
Are you all right?

671
00:40:22,856 --> 00:40:23,879
Oh, I'm fine.

672
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:26,640
Kyle explained the trick
you were pulling on Cassidy.

673
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,855
I just wish I'd known
about it from the beginning.

674
00:40:28,955 --> 00:40:30,624
We didn't want to worry you.

675
00:40:30,724 --> 00:40:33,180
Well, that part of your plan
was unsuccessful.

676
00:40:37,942 --> 00:40:41,146
I'm really sorry I didn't tell you
about what happened to me that night.

677
00:40:41,246 --> 00:40:43,861
No, I'm so sorry you
had to go through that.

678
00:40:44,337 --> 00:40:45,902
And the way I reacted...

679
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:48,978
You know you
can always count on me.

680
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:50,157
I was just

681
00:40:50,754 --> 00:40:51,888
so surprised,

682
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:53,468
hearing it like that.

683
00:40:53,732 --> 00:40:54,872
Well, that's why I

684
00:40:54,972 --> 00:40:56,605
decided to tell Kyle before.

685
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,498
When we were planning all this,
he said, "No surprises."

686
00:41:01,065 --> 00:41:01,911
And...

687
00:41:02,274 --> 00:41:04,002
that was the one secret
I never shared.

688
00:41:05,744 --> 00:41:07,032
So I told him.

689
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,003
And...

690
00:41:08,103 --> 00:41:09,176
he understood.

691
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:11,134
He always does.

692
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:13,319
So...

693
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:15,163
how did it go at The Rack?

694
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:16,473
Just like we wanted.

695
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,935
I don't like that Kyle's
still out there with Cassidy.

696
00:41:21,156 --> 00:41:22,570
Kyle can handle him.

697
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:26,304
<i>We had fooled Cassidy,</i>

698
00:41:26,757 --> 00:41:28,889
<i>and he revealed
my biggest challenge,</i>

699
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:31,489
<i>Latnok was re-starting
Adam's experiment.</i>

700
00:41:32,298 --> 00:41:33,696
<i>I had to stop them.</i>

701
00:41:34,097 --> 00:41:35,941
<i>I had to keep up the charade.</i>

702
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,405
It was an accident.

703
00:41:39,224 --> 00:41:41,498
- You know that, don't you?
- That still doesn't change

704
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:43,711
- what happened.
- She was gonna kill me.

705
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:44,960
You saved my life.

706
00:41:48,612 --> 00:41:50,455
I promise
I will take care of this.

707
00:41:50,555 --> 00:41:52,071
I will take care of you.

708
00:41:53,951 --> 00:41:55,462
But you need to pull it together,

709
00:41:56,067 --> 00:41:57,050
go home.

710
00:41:58,505 --> 00:42:00,976
Tell them you met with me,
but you never saw Jessi.

711
00:42:02,464 --> 00:42:04,004
Look at me.
Look at me.

712
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,760
I'll make sure there is
no trace of what happened.

713
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:13,547
This never happened.

714
00:42:15,024 --> 00:42:17,634
As far as anyone's concerned,
Jessi ran away

715
00:42:18,048 --> 00:42:20,085
and she's not coming back.

716
00:42:20,185 --> 00:42:21,661
Do you understand?

717
00:42:24,874 --> 00:42:25,689
Yes.

718
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:30,910
We're in this together now, Kyle.

719
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:34,406
And together,
there is nothing

720
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:36,296
that we can't do.

721
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:39,710
But we need
to trust each other.

722
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,167
I trust you.

723
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,612
Do you trust me?

724
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:49,454
<i>I hadn't had much experience lying.</i>

725
00:42:51,462 --> 00:42:52,809
Do you trust me?

726
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:57,686
<i>But when it was necessary...</i>

727
00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:00,131
I do.

728
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:04,147
<i>it turned out I was good at it.</i>
