1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,938
Previously on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,038 --> 00:00:03,486
Will you go to the prom with me?

3
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:04,962
Yes, I would love to go with you.

4
00:00:05,062 --> 00:00:06,608
I have less than four weeks
to book a venue,

5
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:08,696
plan a theme, decorations, food...

6
00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:09,877
- Ouch.
- Bummer.

7
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,631
And you're gonna wow me with the lyrics.

8
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,154
In exchange for...

9
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:14,665
I dj the prom.

10
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:16,450
Cause I'd really hate
to see you blow off Declan

11
00:00:16,554 --> 00:00:18,098
for a taste of college-boy pie.

12
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:20,092
If neither of us meet
anyone else before prom,

13
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:22,151
we can finish what we started
in the car today.

14
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:23,263
- Yeah?
- Totally.

15
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:26,511
My test results are back.
I'm officially in remission!

16
00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:28,872
I have to find her.

17
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:30,692
I have to know who this woman is.

18
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:32,651
Brian told me about the girl
in the picture, Sarah?

19
00:00:32,758 --> 00:00:33,861
You don't know how Sarah died.

20
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:36,312
She was just like you,
trying too much too fast,

21
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:38,853
and when she tried something
she wasn't ready for, it killed her.

22
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:41,312
I don't know why Taylor's pushing you,
but you need to stop.

23
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:43,482
We need to prove
to Latnok that we matter.

24
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:45,550
Jessi, please don't listen
to him anymore.

25
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:47,182
What am I supposed to do?

26
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,422
He's my father.

27
00:00:48,527 --> 00:00:50,490
Someone is sending Kyle
a message this way.

28
00:00:50,598 --> 00:00:51,910
I thought Sarah was dead.

29
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:52,972
She is.

30
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:54,812
Maybe she wants me to find her.

31
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:56,202
Hello.

32
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:57,261
I'm Kyle.

33
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:58,791
My name is Sarah.

34
00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:01,690
<i>Life is a journey.

35
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:04,473
<i>And the road we travel
has twists and turns

36
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:07,422
<i>which sometimes lead us
to unexpected places

37
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:09,463
<i>and unexpected people.

38
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:11,771
It's amazing
how much you look like Adam.

39
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,803
You haven't told him
about us meeting tonight?

40
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:16,983
Adam knows about the messages,

41
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:19,050
but I never mentioned them to Jessi.

42
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,281
Good.

43
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,091
They think about you a lot.

44
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:27,633
Yes.

45
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:28,813
Well...

46
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:31,303
I want you to understand...

47
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:34,852
Brian Taylor has always been
a true believer in Latnok,

48
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,983
and by showing off Jessi's abilities,

49
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:38,343
he thinks they'll let him back in,

50
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,002
even if she's harmed in the process.

51
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:41,912
Adam's explained that to me.

52
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:44,901
And I'm sure Adam's explanation

53
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:46,120
preserved his belief

54
00:01:46,225 --> 00:01:48,183
in Latnok's noble intentions.

55
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:51,511
- Aren't they?
- What Adam told you wasn't wrong.

56
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,560
The people in Latnok aren't bad,
they're simply scientists

57
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:56,320
with a very clinical point of view.

58
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:58,570
To them everything's about numbers,

59
00:01:58,675 --> 00:01:59,712
facts, hypotheses.

60
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:01,050
Nothing's personal.

61
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:02,653
But I took it personally.

62
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:04,451
That's why you disappeared.

63
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:05,803
To have a life.

64
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:08,173
To be free to make my own choices,

65
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,950
which is what you and Jessi deserve.

66
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:11,553
But Jessi wants this.

67
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,552
Because she doesn't know any better.

68
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,860
Taylor cares about Latnok,
he doesn't care about Jessi.

69
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,440
He sees her as an achievement.

70
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:21,993
And if he pushes her past her limits
and she breaks down,

71
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:23,760
such is the cost of science.

72
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,602
She's just a means to an end.

73
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:29,011
You have to make her see it, Kyle.

74
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:31,842
You have to get through to her
before it's too late.

75
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:33,843
You could get through to her.

76
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,040
No.

77
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:37,142
Don't tell her about me.

78
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:39,431
But how will I find you?

79
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:41,790
You won't.

80
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:43,453
I'll find you.

81
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:55,360
I wasn't able to finish the protocol

82
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:57,622
within the time limit,
but I'll do it tomorrow.

83
00:02:57,857 --> 00:02:58,550
Don't bother.

84
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:01,103
No, I can do it.
I just have to stay focused.

85
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:04,353
Jess, you're done training.
You're ready now.

86
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:06,853
I am?

87
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:09,420
I set up a meeting with Latnok.

88
00:03:17,758 --> 00:03:19,730

<b>Kyle XY
2x22 - Hello...</b>

91
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:35,640
That's how you're starting your day?

92
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:37,581
Considering I spent all last night

93
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:39,871
listening to Lori battle
with a guitar and lose...

94
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,743
- It wasn't that bad.
- Yes, it was.

95
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:42,961
What was?

96
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:45,421
Hey, we heard you working
on your song last night.

97
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:47,402
- How's it coming?
- Blocked.

98
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:50,411
I think I need an inspirational cup
of teen angst at the Rack.

99
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:52,300
Lucky for you, that's today's special.

100
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:53,473
What are you guys talking about?

101
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:56,142
Nothing says prom like watching
your fellow students blow

102
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:58,862
their entire life
savings planning a crass,

103
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:01,402
over-hyped,
meaningless ritual of adolescence

104
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:03,261
the sole purpose of which is to indulge

105
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:04,533
in an orgy of underage drinking,

106
00:04:04,638 --> 00:04:07,570
promiscuity,
and unrealistic expectations.

107
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:10,451
- Declan.
- You don't sound blocked to me.

108
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:12,631
I didn't know prom cost so much money.

109
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:15,303
- 1, 900 bucks and counting.
- No way.

110
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:17,680
200 for the tickets,
3 for the limo,

111
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:19,220
another 150 for dinner,

112
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,773
then a thousand for the suite.

113
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:27,343
For the sweet afterparty.

114
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:30,623
- Lots of punch and chips.
- Nice save.

115
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:32,592
Yeah, not to sound
too mom or anything,

116
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:35,503
but I don't think you need to break
the bank to have a great time at prom.

117
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:38,891
Thanks, Mrs. Trager.
And no "mom" offense taken.

118
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:40,523
Okay, you ready?

119
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:41,900
We gotta go.

120
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:43,302
- See you later.
- Bye.

121
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:49,730
So, who signed up
for the Declan prom extravaganza?

122
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:53,563
Um, tux fitting's at 10.
Ready to go?

123
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:55,742
Actually, I have to take care
of something.

124
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:01,840
Avoidance. Interesting.

125
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,612
Why are you so happy?

126
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:06,233
Because I'll be hanging out with Andy

127
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:07,931
while you go broke
watching prince charming

128
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:09,761
with his new Cinderella.

129
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,463
- Drop dead and die.
- Catchy.

130
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,181
You should use that in your song.

131
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,772
It's the title.

132
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:19,022
Why are proms so expensive?

133
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:21,493
You want it to mean something,
to be special.

134
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:24,012
And that means spending
thousands of dollars you don't have?

135
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,851
It's about creating a mood.

136
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:28,260
Girls want romance and magic.

137
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:31,040
Romantic is easy.
Magic requires cash.

138
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:33,170
But what if I want
to give Amanda the magic,

139
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:34,540
but I don't have the money?

140
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:36,610
Nothing. You're screwed.

141
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:38,633
Don't forget to vote.

142
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:40,572
You're actively campaigning?

143
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:41,790
Why leave things to chance,

144
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:43,638
when I found the perfect prom date?

145
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:44,792
Who's the lucky guy?

146
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:47,181
Well, he's round, sparkly,

147
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:48,762
weighs just the right amount,

148
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:50,220
and keeps your hair in place.

149
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:52,422
- You're dating the Tiara?
- Yes, munchkin.

150
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:55,540
Plus he goes with anything,
so my dress choices are unlimited.

151
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:00,320
Prom queen. Just add crown.

152
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:04,561
You really went all out.

153
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,871
You seem decidedly unfabulous.

154
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:10,060
Prom committee's become a nightmare
of mix-ups with the decorators

155
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,453
and arguments with the caterers.

156
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:13,273
I want prom to be
this perfect night with Kyle,

157
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:15,301
and all I can think about
is table and chair rentals

158
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:16,992
and nonrefundable deposits.

159
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:19,831
And to top it all off, now I'm getting
crap for the prom theme.

160
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:20,893
Which is?

161
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,582
The time of our lives.

162
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:27,851
Oh, come on. Patrick swayze?

163
00:06:28,057 --> 00:06:29,431
"Nobody puts Baby in a corner".

164
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,111
How many times
have you seen dirty dancing?

165
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:33,040
33.

166
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,892
You poor thing.

167
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:37,721
Why does everyone keep saying that?

168
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:40,232
You know there are other places
we can meet.

169
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:42,760
Yes, but none that have
your employee discount.

170
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:44,861
You owe me a buck fifteen.

171
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:47,272
They wouldn't believe me
when I said I was you.

172
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,312
Actually, save your money.
Put it towards your tuxedo.

173
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:51,063
Why, did somebody die?

174
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:52,783
You don't wear a tuxedo
to a funeral,

175
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:53,941
you wear one to a prom.

176
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,702
Didn't you once tell me
that going to a prom

177
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:57,523
would be a fate worse than death?

178
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,241
I did, and then death and
I were like next-door neighbors,

179
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:02,111
until he moved out of the area...

180
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:04,583
You are getting that
this is a cancer metaphor, right?

181
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:06,412
Actually, it's a cancer simile.

182
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:08,553
And I also know
that neither one of us is old enough

183
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:10,082
to actually get into the prom.

184
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:12,761
That's why mama got her
Josh to work out the details,

185
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:16,073
while I'm off buying
this smoking-hot prom dress.

186
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:20,163
So what do you think?

187
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,750
I think

188
00:07:23,997 --> 00:07:25,671
that you and the prom

189
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,240
should be required by law

190
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:29,140
to stay a hundred yards
away from each other.

191
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:30,540
Excuse me?

192
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:34,291
"with the crepe paper moon
and make-believe smiles,

193
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:35,690
"we'll never forget this sight.

194
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:38,261
"Swirling with laughter
and fraudulent tears,

195
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:40,690
our hollow memory of prom night."

196
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:42,780
I think it captured the mood.

197
00:07:43,618 --> 00:07:45,663
You've annihilated
an innocent teenage ritual.

198
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:47,591
Oh, I'm sorry it doesn't meet

199
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:50,282
your shiny, happy people
musical standards.

200
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:57,503
Well, I guess I just expected
more from you.

201
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,163
Since when are you working today?

202
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:06,723
Since when do you drink coffee?

203
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:09,091
I need enough caffeine to keep awake
until the day after prom.

204
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,001
And I need ducats in a major way.

205
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,312
- So you better tip well.
- Money? What for?

206
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:15,163
For that fancy little dance

207
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:16,833
you're willing to give up sleep over.

208
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:18,270
You're going to prom?

209
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:19,843
But you and Andy aren't old enough.

210
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:21,400
Are you going with someone else?

211
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:24,323
Oh, did you guys break up? I'm so sorry.

212
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:25,482
None of that.

213
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:27,852
It's... it's the damn cancer.

214
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:32,370
I thought we had it beat,
but it's still biting my ass.

215
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:34,062
Andy...

216
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,001
She of hamburgers and hippie skirts,

217
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:37,921
has decided she wants to go.

218
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,361
And you wanna make it special.

219
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:43,450
Andy's like the coolest guy
I've ever known

220
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:45,171
in a body I get to make out with.

221
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:46,801
I'm lucky enough I got her once,

222
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:48,321
but now that she's not sick anymore,

223
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:50,541
I feel like I've hit the jackpot
all over again.

224
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:51,912
I don't care what it takes.

225
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:53,740
She's getting prom deluxe.

226
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:56,241
That is so sweet. I wanna help.

227
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:58,711
First we have to figure out
a way to get you guys in.

228
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:00,322
Aren't you the head
of the prom committee?

229
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:02,442
Even if I sold you tickets,
you'd never make it past the door,

230
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:04,632
unless you had an upperclassman
as your date.

231
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:08,222
And the costs keep rising.

232
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:12,833
Bribe decoy prom dates.

233
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:14,100
Josh?

234
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,140
I think I might know a couple
who'd so it for free.

235
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,910
Whatever you've come here to say, don't.

236
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:35,502
- You'll ruin today for me.
- What's today?

237
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:41,770
It's happening.
I'm meeting them, Latnok.

238
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:43,341
They want me to show them what I can do.

239
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:45,901
Taylor wants to show them
so he can look good.

240
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:48,842
Why do you have to say that?
Why'd you come here?

241
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:50,673
I finally have the chance to prove
that I'm worth something.

242
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:52,033
You already are.

243
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:56,113
And you don't have to prove that
to Taylor or Latnok or anyone.

244
00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,680
Yeah, well, maybe I need
to prove it to myself.

245
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:03,163
So did Sarah,
and it almost destroyed her.

246
00:10:03,405 --> 00:10:04,450
You're wrong.

247
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,493
No one really knows what happened.

248
00:10:06,598 --> 00:10:07,673
But I do.

249
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:12,472
Because she told me.

250
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:21,452
If you don't wanna listen to me,
maybe you'll listen to Sarah.

251
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:26,113
She's alive.

252
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:39,031
She's been living alone all these years?

253
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:41,690
She wanted to escape the pressure,

254
00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:45,230
live some kind of life other
than Latnok's experiment.

255
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:49,340
But she made everyone
think she was dead.

256
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:51,520
I'm sure she had her reasons.

257
00:10:55,506 --> 00:10:57,190
Why would she come to you?

258
00:10:57,927 --> 00:10:58,640
Why not me?

259
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:01,423
She doesn't want anyone
to know she's still alive...

260
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:03,061
Even Adam.

261
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:05,980
But she wants to meet me, right?

262
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:08,382
She wants you to come with me.

263
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,613
But I'm supposed to go with...

264
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:13,191
No, you need to come to my house now.

265
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:15,900
So I can talk to her?

266
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:19,620
I'll make sure of it.

267
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:24,872
Okay.

268
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:32,320
Does Taylor know Jessi's here?

269
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:34,543
No, but he'll start to look for her.

270
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:36,953
She's supposed to meet
the people from Latnok today.

271
00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:38,682
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

272
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:40,461
Their membership is kept secret.

273
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:42,443
Adam always described them

274
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:43,930
as great thinkers and humanitarians.

275
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:44,952
But according to Sarah,

276
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:46,921
they don't have
Jessi's best interests in mind.

277
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:50,490
Well, until we know more, I'm glad
you convinced Jessi to stay away.

278
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:53,382
Except I did it by telling her
she's going to meet Sarah.

279
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:55,183
But Sarah said she'd contact you.

280
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:57,203
So if I can't find her soon,

281
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,762
I've only made the situation worse.

282
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:04,793
- So, where are we going?
- I'll tell you in the car.

283
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:07,630
- Kyle, you can't leave.
- Why? What's wrong?

284
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:09,420
I need 2, 000 bucks by yesterday.

285
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,813
- I'm going to prom.
- You're not old enough.

286
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,243
I'm also not rich enough.

287
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:15,473
And your brain power
equals my cash flow.

288
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:17,620
Josh, I'd like to help,
but I really need to go.

289
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,170
To get Sarah?

290
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:23,050
I'm planning on it.

291
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:24,571
Let me come with you.

292
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:28,221
I think it'd be better for you guys
to meet here for the first time.

293
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:30,223
But I'm her daughter.

294
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:36,031
And she's been in hiding for 20 years.

295
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:37,753
It might be best for the two of you

296
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,070
to meet someplace quiet...
safe.

297
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:42,303
This is it.

298
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:43,573
<i>If you're the 82nd caller,

299
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:46,773
<i>you win a $50 gift certificate
to Harville's Caramels,

300
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:48,523
<i>Seattle's finest candy store.

301
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:50,671
What does winning that have
to do with paying for prom?

302
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:52,161
I win and I sell it.

303
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:54,201
It's a start.

304
00:12:55,027 --> 00:12:57,552
Okay, 82nd caller.

305
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:00,613
Wait.

306
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,733
Now.

307
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:05,741
Lucky number 82, you're on the air.

308
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:07,831
Hello? I won?

309
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:10,211
I won.

310
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:12,560
You're not going anywhere.

311
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:16,852
Let's go.

312
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,031
Personally, I think the problem
with my lyrics is your music.

313
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:21,310
Come again.

314
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,410
It's showy, yet dull
and emotionally barren.

315
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:25,740
So it's the melody's fault?

316
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,502
Just a little constructive criticism.

317
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,140
Right. That from someone who thinks

318
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:30,690
B-flat means to fully recline.

319
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:32,963
Oh, that's funny,
considering your big talent

320
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:34,921
is mixing other people's songs.

321
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:39,050
Sorry. What, did you need me
to write you a pithy comeback?

322
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:41,723
You know what, Lori?
All you do is cut down

323
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:43,153
everything and everyone around you.

324
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,950
You're telling yourself
you're being alternative and edgy.

325
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:46,142
What you don't realize

326
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:48,221
is that everyone knows
you're just jealous,

327
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:50,153
because they've found something
meaningful in their lives,

328
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:51,400
and you haven't.

329
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:56,150
Looks like you could use
a pithy comeback now, too.

330
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:58,501
How about, "I quit"?

331
00:13:58,608 --> 00:13:59,773
My thought exactly.

332
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,682
You can find yourself another DJ.

333
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:11,601
No one inside remembers her.

334
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:13,793
Yeah, I told you it was a long shot.

335
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:15,570
Which means no one saw her drive away,

336
00:14:15,677 --> 00:14:17,292
so we can't even track her car.

337
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,951
You ever play driver/rider?

338
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:25,133
- What's that?
- I played it when I was a kid.

339
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:27,710
It's when you match
the drivers with their rides.

340
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:32,723
Late 30s, lives off her tips,

341
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:35,172
but still finds enough dough
for highlights.

342
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:38,250
15-year-old beater with expired plates.

343
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:45,030
I was really good at it.

344
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,921
If I can describe every car
in the lot last night,

345
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:50,202
and all the people in the diner,

346
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,243
Can you match them up?

347
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:52,691
I can if you can.

348
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:54,670
That's something I'm really good at.

349
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:12,853
Besides the waitress's car,

350
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,862
there's a sports car, a blue minivan,

351
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,470
a rusty pickup,

352
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:19,461
an old motorcycle,

353
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:21,083
and two sedans,

354
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,840
a blue four-door with a rental sticker,

355
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:24,141
the other dark gray.

356
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:25,610
Who's inside the diner?

357
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:31,400
<i>You haven't told him
about us meeting tonight.

358
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:33,010
<i>Adam knows about the messages,

359
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:34,981
<i>but I never mentioned them to Jessi.

360
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:36,321
<i>Good.

361
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:38,642
A man, mid 30s, in a nice suit.

362
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:41,251
He's with a girl, early 20s,
in a tight red shirt.

363
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:42,750
They're having an affair.

364
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:44,973
She's the sports car, he's the minivan.

365
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:45,863
Minivan?

366
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:47,750
It's his turn to carpool the kids.

367
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:52,190
Man, mid 20s, flannel shirt
talking to the waitress.

368
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:53,633
He's the pickup truck.

369
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,203
And the cook with the tattoo on his hand

370
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:56,711
must be the motorcycle.

371
00:15:57,218 --> 00:15:58,732
You're getting the hang of it!

372
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:01,712
Which leave an other man.

373
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:02,860
Heavy, looks tired.

374
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:03,761
Salesman.

375
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:05,352
He's driving the rental.

376
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:07,880
Sarah's driving the gray sedan.

377
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:10,493
Okay, how did you do that?

378
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:13,993
I just calculated the speed
of the telephone lines,

379
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:15,391
the radio station switcher,

380
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:18,930
and the physiological requirements
to dial a multidigit number.

381
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:24,650
We're going to win every prize

382
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:26,342
on every radio station in Seattle,

383
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:28,680
Then sell the booty online for half off.

384
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:30,893
I'll be swimming in green by dinnertime.

385
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:33,513
You are up for this, aren't you?

386
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:36,810
I mean, I could cut you in for,
say, 10%?

387
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,111
I'm waiting anyway.

388
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:40,781
Don't you need money for prom?

389
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:42,962
No. No one would want to take me.

390
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:45,451
But I don't care because
I'm meeting my mother.

391
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:47,490
That's really great.
I'm happy for you.

392
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:49,050
So, five percent it is.

393
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:55,450
"You know you want to,
vote Hillary for prom queen?"

394
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:57,952
Are you trying to get elected prom queen

395
00:16:58,055 --> 00:16:59,201
or invade a small country?

396
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:01,801
Well, I am like the Einstein
of social networking.

397
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:04,963
And I'm choosing to use my powers
for good instead of evil.

398
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:06,740
"good" meaning your coronation?

399
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:08,601
The trick to getting votes is research

400
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,531
and making sure everyone gets laid.

401
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,512
Well, except you of course.

402
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:17,892
So, what's up with Declan?
How's he faring?

403
00:17:18,377 --> 00:17:20,483
Look at you, curious kitty.

404
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:23,271
I'm asking for
demonstration purposes only.

405
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,420
Well, there's no confirmed
kill as of late,

406
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:31,311
But four sharks are circling,
two are cheerleaders.

407
00:17:31,628 --> 00:17:32,912
No surprise.

408
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,512
Of course, it could be time
for the resurrection of Leclan.

409
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:38,891
I'm so not going there.

410
00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:41,841
But relationships like yours
bring order to the universe.

411
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:43,890
Nothing says "copacetic" like reuniting

412
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:46,631
Beachwood's very own Brangelina.

413
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:50,482
Whoever invented proms
should be forced to plan one.

414
00:17:50,588 --> 00:17:52,970
Great, I'm stuck
with gloom and gloomier.

415
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:55,753
Unless we convince people
to brown-bag it, the prom's ruined.

416
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:56,981
What happened with the food?

417
00:17:57,086 --> 00:17:58,850
Our caterer got shut down
by the health department

418
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:00,973
and I can't get our deposit back.

419
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:05,713
This might not be such
a good time to tell you this.

420
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,372
Tell me what?

421
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:10,230
We don't have a DJ, either.

422
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:25,290
How'd you find me?

423
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:27,422
Traffic cameras.

424
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:28,932
Traffic cameras.

425
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:31,503
I reviewed the Seattle traffic database,

426
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,152
starting with the three near the diner,

427
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:36,432
then sequentially accessed
137 more to lead me here.

428
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:39,762
I just wanted to tell you
that Jessi's okay.

429
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:41,932
Does she understand
what Taylor's been doing?

430
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,231
I don't think she'll really believe it

431
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:44,911
until she hears it from you.

432
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,430
That won't be possible.

433
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:49,750
She really wants to meet you, Sarah.

434
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:51,473
Did you tell her?

435
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:53,852
Why'd you do that?

436
00:18:53,956 --> 00:18:55,580
I didn't know what else to do.

437
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:57,163
I couldn't get her to listen.

438
00:18:57,265 --> 00:18:59,591
But now you've made things complicated.

439
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,303
Jessi was so excited to find out

440
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,202
that her mother is really alive.

441
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:05,460
I'm not her mother.

442
00:19:09,726 --> 00:19:10,591
No.

443
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:14,941
I can't be a mother to her.

444
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:16,151
To anyone.

445
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,510
Please don't slip away again.

446
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:20,762
You can't just disappear.

447
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:23,061
I'm glad Jessi's safe.

448
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,521
That's all I wanted.

449
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:26,301
I don't believe that.

450
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:27,981
You didn't have to come back here.

451
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:30,290
Nobody had to know that you were alive.

452
00:19:30,658 --> 00:19:33,221
But Jessi touched
something inside of you.

453
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:36,862
You left Jessi the record of that song.

454
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:39,782
You didn't have to do that.
You could've left it for me.

455
00:19:41,037 --> 00:19:43,062
But I think you wanted Jessi to feel

456
00:19:43,168 --> 00:19:45,992
that somehow you were
around looking out for her.

457
00:19:48,116 --> 00:19:50,213
All she wants is to know you.

458
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,512
And I think you're lucky to have
this opportunity to know her.

459
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:00,813
Okay.

460
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:03,612
I'll come.

461
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:07,052
This afternoon.

462
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:08,893
Wait, my address.

463
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:11,151
I know where you live.

464
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:12,843
Right.

465
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:14,931
Tell Jessi...

466
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:17,782
I'm looking forward to meeting her.

467
00:20:17,987 --> 00:20:19,240
I will.

468
00:20:36,448 --> 00:20:37,542
What did she say?

469
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,223
She's looking forward to meeting you.

470
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:42,700
Well, when is she coming?

471
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:43,992
This afternoon.

472
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:46,872
Kyle...

473
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:49,380
This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

474
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:52,493
Okay, enough of that.

475
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:54,190
I need you. We're on a roll.

476
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:57,311
What's going on?

477
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,873
Thanks to Jessi,

478
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:00,972
we're gonna prom it in style, bro.

479
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:02,742
<i>Buenos dias, Seattle!</i>

480
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:05,490
- Hablas espanol?
- Claro que si?

481
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:07,923
If it's food we need,
then it's food we get.

482
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:09,332
French would be my choice.

483
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:11,073
Just remember,
we can't afford anything...

484
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:12,301
Then french it is!

485
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:14,300
The gourmet club will be psyched!

486
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:17,030
Is everything all right?

487
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,262
She's trying to save us
from starving at prom.

488
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,670
A little setback with the caterer

489
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:22,470
and then there's
the issue with the music.

490
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:24,511
Prom sucks.

491
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:28,252
What's wrong with Lori?

492
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:32,481
You cannot give me an opening like that.

493
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:34,620
- Hi.
- Hey. What's Josh doing?

494
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:36,832
Raising money.

495
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:38,232
In spanish?

496
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:41,353
Apparently we're double dating
to the prom with him and Andy.

497
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:44,513
Actually, I'm taking Josh,
you're taking Andy.

498
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,941
But... I want to go with you.

499
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,451
Oh, you still are.

500
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:49,823
It's just... it's a technicality.

501
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:50,961
It's called a "date switch".

502
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:52,831
It's the only way
underclassmen can go to prom.

503
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:53,963
We're still going together.

504
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,721
It's just I have officially asked Josh

505
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:57,412
and you've officially invited Andy.

506
00:21:58,455 --> 00:22:00,303
I'm sorry. I didn't even ask you
if it was okay.

507
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:02,981
It is okay. It's more than okay.

508
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:04,633
Thank you for thinking of it.

509
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:06,593
Josh needed my help,
so I just asked myself,

510
00:22:06,697 --> 00:22:07,821
what would you do?

511
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:09,730
Mucho dinero!

512
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:12,942
Uh, para Josho!

513
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:14,392
Me llamo Josh Trager.

514
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:17,362
Me llamo Josh Trager. Whoo!

515
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:31,402
What?

516
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:32,963
Why do you hate prom?

517
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:35,093
Jessi, I'm so not in the mood.

518
00:22:38,097 --> 00:22:39,412
She comes in anyway.

519
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:41,852
You're sad.

520
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,543
No, I'm frustrated and annoyed.

521
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:48,683
Okay, maybe a little sad.

522
00:22:50,277 --> 00:22:51,063
Why?

523
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:53,813
I just don't understand.

524
00:22:53,918 --> 00:22:56,863
I mean, prom's supposed to be
this great milestone, right?

525
00:22:57,185 --> 00:22:58,602
The whole thing has just left me feeling

526
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:02,693
sort of... lost and empty.

527
00:23:05,037 --> 00:23:07,243
That's how I feel most of the time.

528
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:15,753
I just wanted prom to mean something.

529
00:23:17,595 --> 00:23:21,011
Wasn't it about celebrating the times
you've had with your friends?

530
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:22,663
I guess.

531
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,761
You have lots of friends.

532
00:23:25,428 --> 00:23:28,442
But it shouldn't just be this night
where we all play dress-up

533
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:30,743
and nobody looks like themselves
anyway.

534
00:23:31,238 --> 00:23:32,803
You should be who you are.

535
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:34,950
And who are you?

536
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:39,182
The eternal question.

537
00:23:40,147 --> 00:23:43,403
Honestly?
No clue.

538
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:53,941
She even looks like me, you know?

539
00:23:54,745 --> 00:23:57,320
Like the way Adam looks like Kyle?

540
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:03,440
You must be happy to meet her.

541
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,013
I want to remember every second.

542
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,340
That's what you do
when you don't have a past.

543
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:13,300
You live in the moment.

544
00:24:20,748 --> 00:24:25,652
The big difference is...
Sarah didn't have long hair.

545
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:30,412
If you want, I could change that.

546
00:24:39,618 --> 00:24:40,500
Okay.

547
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:46,623
Oui! C'est magnifique!

548
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:48,260
Très bien.

549
00:24:49,145 --> 00:24:50,681
I had no idea you spoke french.

550
00:24:50,886 --> 00:24:51,942
I speak french food.

551
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:53,883
So, we just need to give chef Jacques

552
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:56,601
a check for $5, 000
by tomorrow and, voila!

553
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:58,723
We're in for the gastronomical
treat of our lives.

554
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:00,593
But I already told you
we don't have any money left.

555
00:25:00,698 --> 00:25:03,981
Well, you're just going to have
to fix that now, aren't you?

556
00:25:10,335 --> 00:25:11,680
How are you doing?

557
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:14,973
It's hard to just wait.

558
00:25:15,435 --> 00:25:17,080
You've done all you can do.

559
00:25:19,437 --> 00:25:20,403
Maybe.

560
00:25:20,657 --> 00:25:22,442
I just hope Sarah wants to meet Jessi

561
00:25:22,545 --> 00:25:24,603
half as much as Jessi wants to meet her.

562
00:25:25,366 --> 00:25:26,251
What do you mean?

563
00:25:26,547 --> 00:25:29,122
Sarah's pretended to be
dead all these years.

564
00:25:29,425 --> 00:25:32,032
She cut herself off
from everyone she knew.

565
00:25:32,985 --> 00:25:35,513
That doesn't sound like someone
eager to make a connection.

566
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,410
You think she may not come?

567
00:25:37,598 --> 00:25:39,480
I hope that's not the case, but...

568
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:43,402
I'm more worried that
if she does come, it won't be enough.

569
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,060
The last time I did this
I was with Declan

570
00:25:50,168 --> 00:25:52,323
and we were both wasted.

571
00:25:53,258 --> 00:25:54,532
Do you need a drink first?

572
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:57,343
No! Trust me, better sober.

573
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:04,372
I have been angry with you for so long.

574
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:10,010
I don't want to be anymore.

575
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:13,470
I'm glad.

576
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:16,991
Me, too.

577
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,500
You sure about this?

578
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:29,073
Jessi, once we do this
there's no turning back.

579
00:26:29,277 --> 00:26:30,381
I know.

580
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:46,262
You're either lost or waiting for Kyle.

581
00:26:46,476 --> 00:26:47,941
A little bit of both.

582
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:50,393
Is Kyle on board with the date swap?

583
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:53,910
He'd love to help you go to prom,

584
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:55,320
except there won't be one.

585
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:57,350
Do you know how hard
I've worked for that night?

586
00:26:57,455 --> 00:27:00,063
Do you know how many donuts I had
to sell to raise money for balloons?

587
00:27:00,165 --> 00:27:02,812
I just should've kept the donuts
so at least we'd have something to eat

588
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,871
now that the caterer's
taken all our money.

589
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:08,882
One, I think you've had
way too much caffeine.

590
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:09,860
And two...

591
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:13,550
Are you telling me there are
problems with the prom?

592
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:15,781
Yes. And yes.

593
00:27:18,215 --> 00:27:20,081
N-no, don't even think it.

594
00:27:21,576 --> 00:27:22,663
Are you all right?

595
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:23,811
No.

596
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:26,181
I just had the most terrible thought
flash in my brain

597
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:27,813
"what would Kyle do?"

598
00:27:28,598 --> 00:27:29,930
I think that's going around.

599
00:27:31,498 --> 00:27:33,021
How much do you need?

600
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:35,793
You don't want to know.

601
00:27:36,647 --> 00:27:37,692
I hate Kyle.

602
00:27:41,137 --> 00:27:42,320
You take cash?

603
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:45,042
I'll get it!

604
00:27:51,726 --> 00:27:53,032
I thought you'd be here.

605
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:56,493
What did you do to your hair?

606
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,161
I cut it.

607
00:28:01,037 --> 00:28:01,832
Let's go.

608
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,142
No.

609
00:28:04,187 --> 00:28:06,742
- You know what today is.
- I'm not going.

610
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:08,130
That's not really your decision.

611
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:09,251
Yes, it is.

612
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,743
You can't force her to go anywhere.

613
00:28:10,845 --> 00:28:12,003
I have every right.

614
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,221
I'm aware of your rights,

615
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:14,530
but I'll do whatever's necessary

616
00:28:14,635 --> 00:28:15,922
to make sure Jessi stays safe.

617
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,220
I wonder what your licensing board

618
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:18,680
would say about that.

619
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:21,082
Let them say what they want.

620
00:28:21,188 --> 00:28:22,080
You're not taking her.

621
00:28:22,188 --> 00:28:24,440
What happens when they start
asking questions about her?

622
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:26,903
- About Kyle?
- I'll answer them.

623
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:31,663
I can't believe this.

624
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:33,613
You know how important this is.

625
00:28:33,977 --> 00:28:36,831
They think that I was wrong
to even create you.

626
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:38,933
We have to prove to them
that I was right.

627
00:28:39,036 --> 00:28:41,561
I don't care what Latnok thinks.

628
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:43,560
I don't have to win them back.

629
00:28:44,095 --> 00:28:46,760
I've done everything for our dream.

630
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:48,920
But they turned their backs on me.

631
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,111
And now you?

632
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:51,783
You owe me.

633
00:28:51,986 --> 00:28:53,180
I owe you?

634
00:28:53,886 --> 00:28:55,553
Is that the price
of being your daughter?

635
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:56,833
You're damn right it is!

636
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:57,991
I gave you life!

637
00:28:58,095 --> 00:28:59,392
And they saved it.

638
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:01,240
So get out.

639
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:02,521
You heard her.

640
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,191
You'll regret this.

641
00:29:12,145 --> 00:29:13,470
I'm all you've got.

642
00:29:33,845 --> 00:29:34,773
Thank you.

643
00:29:38,098 --> 00:29:39,173
Are you okay?

644
00:29:41,036 --> 00:29:42,220
I will be.

645
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:45,102
My mother is coming.

646
00:29:51,045 --> 00:29:52,631
Someone need the money
and I didn't want to do it,

647
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:54,001
but I did, which made me feel better,

648
00:29:54,107 --> 00:29:55,323
but now I'm broke,
which means...

649
00:29:55,428 --> 00:29:57,153
Exactly how much money is left?

650
00:29:57,688 --> 00:29:59,791
I can spring for the prom tickets,

651
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:04,410
a sky-blue rayon suit,
and a scoop of ice cream.

652
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:09,743
Two...scoops?

653
00:30:10,105 --> 00:30:11,862
God, you're such a moron.

654
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,743
I am?

655
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:14,073
I'm the one who wanted to go.

656
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:15,160
It should be my treat.

657
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:16,363
But I just assumed that...

658
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:17,871
That it was this whole archaic thing

659
00:30:17,976 --> 00:30:20,710
where you save your lunch money
and mow extra lawns

660
00:30:20,815 --> 00:30:22,781
to take me out because
you think I'm pretty?

661
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:24,500
Uh-uh. Not having it.

662
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,162
This time, you're the pretty one.

663
00:30:26,265 --> 00:30:28,661
But you wanted
a night of cancer-free fun,

664
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:30,560
and it's my job to pay the way.

665
00:30:33,676 --> 00:30:35,100
Let me explain something to you.

666
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:40,072
This mouth upchucked
a lot of lunches while in chemo.

667
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:42,583
And for some stupid reason,

668
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:45,551
you never stopped wanting
to make out with me.

669
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:48,443
Well, you were generous
with the mouthwash.

670
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:50,831
- I figured it was cool.
- Would you zip it?

671
00:30:51,246 --> 00:30:52,701
This is, like, a serious moment.

672
00:30:56,567 --> 00:30:59,282
Yes, I'm glad the cancer's gone,

673
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:03,141
And, yes, I want to party
like a rock star...

674
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,763
But, Josh, you're the reason
I want to celebrate.

675
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:12,641
You really think I'm pretty?

676
00:31:14,988 --> 00:31:17,352
So forget about tossing
the couch for change.

677
00:31:17,456 --> 00:31:19,111
Mama's got you covered.

678
00:31:19,215 --> 00:31:21,283
Exactly how are you paying for all this?

679
00:31:21,805 --> 00:31:23,320
I recovered from cancer.

680
00:31:23,426 --> 00:31:25,452
My moms will give us money for days.

681
00:31:44,846 --> 00:31:47,173
It's beautiful. Yeah.

682
00:31:47,878 --> 00:31:49,302
I'm glad you called.

683
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:50,830
Well, I'm glad you liked it,

684
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:53,980
because in order to make those chords
and make that key change

685
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:56,011
I had to break two of my fingers.

686
00:31:56,455 --> 00:31:57,851
I was referring to the lyrics.

687
00:31:57,955 --> 00:32:00,111
I just wanted you to know
that although I am a cynic,

688
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,731
I'm only a partial cynic.

689
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,581
I timeshare an actual heart

690
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:06,280
on weekends and major u.s. holidays.

691
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,141
Well, then I guess
I will be sure to schedule

692
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:11,290
our future songwriting
sessions accordingly.

693
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:14,121
We're having future sessions?

694
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:19,503
Well, I guess we should...

695
00:32:20,578 --> 00:32:22,142
Wrap this one up first.

696
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:25,050
Um, what prompted you to revisit it?

697
00:32:26,385 --> 00:32:27,940
You won't believe me if I tell you.

698
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:29,350
Try me.

699
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:32,512
A haircut.

700
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:42,032
So, uh, we should enter
this in the contest.

701
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:43,540
I suppose.

702
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:45,022
Although, I'm sure some three-chord

703
00:32:45,126 --> 00:32:47,040
trite piece of crap will win.

704
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:48,571
You're probably right.

705
00:32:54,177 --> 00:32:55,410
What's that for?

706
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:58,813
You just bought yourself a DJ.

707
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,860
Although I don't plan on attending,

708
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:03,931
on behalf of Beachwood high,
I accept your offer.

709
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:09,111
You know, I never went
to my high school prom, either.

710
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:11,341
I mean, when you're a 15-year-old senior

711
00:33:11,446 --> 00:33:14,200
with no driver's license,
no one wants to go with you.

712
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:18,382
But I stayed home,
I made fun of it a bit,

713
00:33:18,695 --> 00:33:20,471
and after a while I felt better.

714
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:22,860
And you regret not going.

715
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:27,503
I regret that it was just another thing

716
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,001
I never got to do in my life.

717
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:45,293
Maybe you'd like
to come back in for a while?

718
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:47,360
No.

719
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:51,591
She's not coming.

720
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,890
- It's only been...
- 3 hours and 52 minutes.

721
00:33:56,816 --> 00:33:58,682
Sarah said she'd be here.

722
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:00,883
People say a lot of things.

723
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:02,543
It doesn't mean they're true.

724
00:34:03,337 --> 00:34:04,653
Where are you going?

725
00:34:05,938 --> 00:34:08,522
Don't worry,
I'm not going back to Brian.

726
00:34:19,537 --> 00:34:21,912
Uh-oh, am I in trouble?

727
00:34:22,236 --> 00:34:23,663
Should you be?

728
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:27,752
I'm so not falling for that one again.

729
00:34:31,026 --> 00:34:34,761
No. There's no reason
I should be in trouble... Dad.

730
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:36,763
All right, good.
Then sit down.

731
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:44,402
So, it looks like Sarah's not coming.

732
00:34:44,855 --> 00:34:45,922
And once Jessi gets back,

733
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:47,781
there's no way
we're sending her to Taylor's.

734
00:34:47,888 --> 00:34:51,060
We've already talked about this,
but it's a family decision.

735
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,221
We want Jessi to stay here

736
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:56,041
until we can find
someplace more permanent.

737
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,970
I'm okay with it.

738
00:35:04,775 --> 00:35:05,762
Are you sure?

739
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:07,313
Well, we want you to be.

740
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:09,942
Especially you, Lori,

741
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,592
given what happened
between you and Jessi.

742
00:35:11,697 --> 00:35:14,170
We don't want you to feel
uncomfortable in any way.

743
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:18,431
Of course she can stay.

744
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:21,311
I mean, that's what we do, isn't it?

745
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:25,791
Can I tell Jessi?

746
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:26,771
Of course.

747
00:35:26,976 --> 00:35:28,363
I thought she took off.

748
00:35:28,718 --> 00:35:29,482
She did.

749
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:31,903
<i>But I think
I know where to find her.</i>

750
00:35:48,428 --> 00:35:49,671
How'd you find me?

751
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:52,503
I've gotten good
at knowing where you'd go.

752
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,633
Did she ever show up?

753
00:36:05,877 --> 00:36:06,820
No.

754
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:16,440
So...my mother lied

755
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:18,281
And my father lied.

756
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,660
It's true. I'm a mistake.

757
00:36:21,865 --> 00:36:23,473
Jessi, don't say that.

758
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:27,443
- You're important.
- No, I never mattered.

759
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:41,320
You matter to me.
And the Tragers.

760
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:42,593
We want you to come stay with us.

761
00:36:42,695 --> 00:36:44,562
No. Don't pity me!

762
00:36:44,826 --> 00:36:47,143
We don't. We care about you.

763
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:50,332
Jessi, please!
You could be part of our family.

764
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:55,320
No! That's your family.
It won't ever be mine.

765
00:36:55,578 --> 00:36:57,271
Don't you understand?

766
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,441
I'm alone.

767
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:01,930
Jessi...

768
00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:04,410
You're not alone.

769
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,252
It's too late.

770
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,172
It never is.

771
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:17,241
Jessi!

772
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,220
Her heart has stopped.

773
00:37:26,555 --> 00:37:28,141
<i>Seeing Jessi on the floor,</i>

774
00:37:28,515 --> 00:37:29,872
<i>I knew what I had to do.</i>

775
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:33,163
<i>I had to save her,
to restart her heart.</i>

776
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:35,482
<i>But was it too late?</i>

777
00:37:35,635 --> 00:37:37,070
<i>Was I strong enough?</i>

778
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:40,360
<i>And if I failed,
would I kill us both?</i>

779
00:38:19,586 --> 00:38:20,811
It's okay now.

780
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:24,833
I'm here.

781
00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:38,462
When I saw Jessi laying there,

782
00:38:39,118 --> 00:38:40,833
the thought of losing her...

783
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,131
I focused all of my energy
to revive her.

784
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:46,740
And you did.

785
00:38:48,896 --> 00:38:51,232
I still feel a little drained.

786
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:53,982
But that's not what's worrying you.

787
00:38:57,748 --> 00:38:59,081
In that moment,

788
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:02,171
when I brought Jessi back,

789
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:06,493
I felt like there was nothing
I couldn't do,

790
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:09,582
and that scared me.

791
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:14,881
Kyle, part of growing up

792
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:19,231
is learning how our actions
affect other people...

793
00:39:20,076 --> 00:39:22,173
And how we handle that power.

794
00:39:23,148 --> 00:39:25,590
It's kind of what it's like
to be a parent.

795
00:39:26,955 --> 00:39:28,031
Or a friend.

796
00:39:30,865 --> 00:39:32,752
I'm not worried about you.

797
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:35,591
I think you're going to be just fine.

798
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:41,211
<i>The road we travel
is unpredictable.</i>

799
00:39:42,315 --> 00:39:43,870
<i>Sometimes it's smooth,</i>

800
00:39:45,796 --> 00:39:48,051
<i>and sometimes
it's filled with bumps.</i>

801
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:53,610
<i>But if we're lucky...</i>

802
00:39:54,938 --> 00:39:57,411
<i>We find people to travel with us.</i>

803
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:07,772
I know this is gonna sound weird,
but...

804
00:40:08,796 --> 00:40:11,300
Remember that deal we made
about prom night?

805
00:40:12,188 --> 00:40:13,881
Regrettably, yes.

806
00:40:13,986 --> 00:40:15,190
Regrettably?

807
00:40:15,295 --> 00:40:17,231
Come on, it was a silly thing
to promise one another,

808
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:18,811
especially since two cheerleaders

809
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,963
are getting your magic
and romance package.

810
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:22,403
Where'd you hear that?

811
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:24,133
I have my sources.

812
00:40:24,236 --> 00:40:26,620
Well, I have a source, too,
that says you're not going.

813
00:40:26,727 --> 00:40:28,351
Then your source is wrong.

814
00:40:28,698 --> 00:40:30,531
I'm going stag.

815
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:34,120
What, and miss the chance
to mock the madness firsthand?

816
00:40:35,297 --> 00:40:36,452
Well, good.

817
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:38,420
So you don't have a date yet, either.

818
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:42,063
Guess your source is wrong, too.

819
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:46,112
Oh, my god.

820
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:48,533
You planned this all along.

821
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:51,811
You turned down girls
so I would stick to the deal

822
00:40:51,918 --> 00:40:53,783
and hook up with you on prom night?

823
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:59,413
I know we said we'd go with one another
if we didn't have dates,

824
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,151
But I didn't rig anything.

825
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:05,140
I'm not asking you to go to prom

826
00:41:05,248 --> 00:41:06,913
because there's no one else.

827
00:41:08,328 --> 00:41:11,300
I'm asking because you are the only one

828
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:12,863
I want to go with.

829
00:41:16,705 --> 00:41:18,391
So, then, we should go.

830
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:42,923
<i>Our journey is really a search,</i>

831
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:45,511
<i>a yearning for love
and connection.</i>

832
00:41:45,757 --> 00:41:48,583
<i>Sometimes it leads us back home.</i>

833
00:41:49,188 --> 00:41:51,380
Why didn't you come to the house?

834
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:53,692
I was scared.

835
00:41:54,877 --> 00:41:55,612
Of me?

836
00:41:57,625 --> 00:42:00,361
Of not being everything
you want me to be.

837
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:03,443
I just want to know you.

838
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:07,031
I want to know you, too.

839
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:11,532
What about Brian?

840
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:15,053
Kyle said he's taking care of it.

841
00:42:39,108 --> 00:42:40,542
A one-way ticket?

842
00:42:41,466 --> 00:42:44,793
Trust me... you don't want to come back.

843
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:00,651
<i>Her heart has stopped!</i>

844
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:18,132
<i>He's incredible.</i>

845
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:21,280
<i>More than we dreamed
we'd ever see in our lifetimes.</i>

846
00:43:23,158 --> 00:43:25,722
<i>I think it's time
we introduced ourselves.</i>

847
