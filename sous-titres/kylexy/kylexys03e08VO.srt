<i>Prevously on Kyle XY...</i>

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,087
- I'm Kyle.
- My name's Sarah.

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:08,284
Jessi was so excited to find out
that her mother is really alive.

4
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:10,317
All she wants is to know you.

5
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:14,096
We have to get away from all this,
Jessi. We have to start our new life.

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,584
I'll be back.

7
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,310
Sarah just left. I would
never do that to you.

8
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:20,519
I know that.

9
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,548
Just go out there,
find a girl,

10
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:23,845
grab her and just...

11
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:24,896
rebound.

12
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,319
- Oh, my God!
- I can't believe you refuse

13
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,863
to speak to me over something
that doesn't even matter.

14
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:33,016
What doesn't matter, the fact
that Declan kissed you

15
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,448
- or that you let him?
- I didn't let him.

16
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:37,787
- I'm Jackie.
- Declan.

17
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,247
Are you a good guy
or am I wasting my time?

18
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:44,168
- I'm about 80 percent good guy.
- Those are pretty good odds.

19
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,420
My mom got a job
she couldn't pass up.

20
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,130
We move at the end of the month.

21
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,549
You can't move.
What about us?

22
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:54,838
I never caught your name.

23
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:57,251
- Jessi.
- I'm Cassidy.

24
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:59,126
Everyone else at Latnok
seems genuine.

25
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,976
I'm still not convinced
about Cassidy.

26
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,688
- What do you know about Sarah?
- She's not a friend of Latnok.

27
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:06,691
He's hiding something in his office.

28
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:12,697
He has Sarah's ring, but it might have
something to do with her disappearance.

29
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:14,949
My mother didn't leave me.

30
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,541
I don't think she did.

31
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:19,042
I need to find out
what happened to her.

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,288
Promise me you'll
help me find out.

33
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:22,707
I promise.

34
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:46,738
- Are you okay?
- I've just been doing some research.

35
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:48,932
I tapped into the rental
car company's records,

36
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:53,038
and it turns out Sarah returned her car
the day after she supposedly left town.

37
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:55,172
It was definitely Sarah?

38
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:56,859
I called the rental company.

39
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,948
The car was dropped off.
I mean...

40
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:01,514
nobody saw her, exactly.

41
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,766
- But it still could've been Sarah.
- That's true.

42
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,057
What's the matter?

43
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,840
Nothing. Just a headache.

44
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,567
We'll find her, right?

45
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,767
<i>She was so hopeful.</i>

46
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:22,590
<i>How could I tell her what I feared
might have happened to her mother?</i>

47
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,744
We'll find her.

Don't mind me.

54
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:47,542
Just keep at it, big guy.

55
00:03:48,826 --> 00:03:50,284
What are you doing?

56
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:53,567
You're a paragon, Stephen Trager.

57
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,491
The kind of man a son
can hope to be someday.

58
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:57,483
Paragon?

59
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:01,540
At least you're attempting to
butter me up with an SAT word.

60
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:04,651
Come on. You know
you can ask me anything.

61
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:05,752
You're right.

62
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:07,606
I mean, you love me unconditionally,

63
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,357
and you always have my
best interests at heart.

64
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:14,712
And that's why you're gonna
let Andy move in with us.

65
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,379
Don't say no.

66
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:24,227
No is not on the list
of acceptable responses.

67
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:25,709
Unfortunately, it is.

68
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:26,795
Come on!

69
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:29,144
Mom brings home strays
whenever she wants

70
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:31,138
and the one time I ask,
you suddenly get picky?

71
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,856
Kyle and Jessi are a different
story and you know it.

72
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,609
But if Andy can't stay here,
then she has to move.

73
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:38,648
To Cleveland.

74
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:40,917
For, like, ever.

75
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:44,102
I know that's gonna be really
hard for you to deal with.

76
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,191
So don't make me
have to deal with it.

77
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,997
Please, Dad.

78
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:54,043
I'm sorry. I really am.
It's just not an option.

79
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,499
Not even a tiny sort of

80
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:58,848
"let me discuss it
with your mother" option?

81
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:00,380
Not even that.

82
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,075
Great.

83
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:07,134
Way to be there for me.

84
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:22,096
Stop it.

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,787
Stop what?

86
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:26,099
You're looking
for Cassidy. Don't.

87
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,368
I'm just wondering where he is.

88
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:32,499
We can't let him know we suspect
he's involved in Sarah's disappearance.

89
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,156
It'll just make it harder
to find what he's hiding.

90
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:36,094
I know.

91
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:37,868
So act normal.

92
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:40,381
I could make him
tell us what he's hiding.

93
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:43,200
- That's not acting normal.
- It is for me.

94
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,969
Good work.

95
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:53,412
My head.

96
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,106
Are you okay?

97
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,226
You can do this.

98
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:01,912
How are my two favorite
brainiacs this morning?

99
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:03,239
Good, thanks.

100
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,634
Fine.

101
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,993
- Is everything all right?
- She's just been tired.

102
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:11,080
Maybe you're coming down
with something.

103
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,601
I'm fine. See?

104
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:15,388
I'll have them fix up a cup of tea.
You'll feel better.

105
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:18,168
- You don't have to do that.
- It's all right. I'm here to help.

106
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:21,549
You know the plan.

107
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,776
Copy his cell's memory card,
then get out.

108
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:26,802
Just make sure
you buy me enough time.

109
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:28,721
I'll try.

110
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,104
- You have time for a demonstration?
- Yeah, absolutely. What you got?

111
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:01,353
The door was open. I swear,
I knocked and rang the bell, but...

112
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,110
- obviously...
- Kyle's not here.

113
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,686
- Actually, I stopped by to...
- He and Jessi were all bunched up

114
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:07,867
and whispery at breakfast table,
which, if you ask me,

115
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:10,191
is a little too buddy-buddy
for my taste because, get this,

116
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,382
apparently Jessi is crushing
on Kyle something fierce.

117
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:14,931
I don't know where they went or when
Kyle's coming back. All I know

118
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:17,182
she lured him out of the house
to a cabin to lock him up

119
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:18,854
and turn him into her love-slave.

120
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:20,355
I'm here to see you.

121
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:22,197
You are?

122
00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:24,355
I came to see if you
wanted to hit The Rack.

123
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:26,945
And it looks like you could stand
some quality friend time.

124
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:29,596
Why, because I'm dancing
around the house

125
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:32,993
and babbling like you're the first
person I've talked to all day?

126
00:07:33,682 --> 00:07:34,997
I'll get my purse.

127
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:47,507
As you can see, I've modified
the design to accommodate

128
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,551
several different energy sources.
It can use electricity, fission

129
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,513
or solar power to process
a petabyte of data from the sensor.

130
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,270
That's really interesting.
Thanks.

131
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,603
I've also reduced the transfer time
to less than a picosecond

132
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:02,648
so the data now degrades only
a tenth as much as when I started.

133
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:03,856
Fantastic.

134
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,192
Good job.

135
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,319
Now, onto the program specs.

136
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,836
That's fantastic.
Really good work, man.

137
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:43,587
There's this really funny video
about a Star Wars kid.

138
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:45,508
- You should see it.
- Saw that one.

139
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,775
Made the rounds a few years ago.
But good work.

140
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,944
Keep it up.

141
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,958
Oh, my God.
Are you all right sweetheart?

142
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,027
Good. Guys, step back.
Get someone to fix that.

143
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,853
What are you doing?

144
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:12,431
What are you looking at?

145
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:14,562
Are you okay?

146
00:09:14,806 --> 00:09:17,181
I don't know,
I feel strange.

147
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:21,360
I'm gonna take you home.

148
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,981
- What took you so long?
- I wanted Sarah's ring.

149
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:34,721
I didn't take it.
I didn't have time.

150
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,658
Good. He would've missed it.

151
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,658
I hate that he has it.
It's hers.

152
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:40,201
We'll get it back eventually.

153
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:42,225
Meanwhile, that was a good
cover with Nate.

154
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:44,334
I really thought you were sick.

155
00:09:54,972 --> 00:09:57,560
- You OK?
- What happened?

156
00:09:57,921 --> 00:10:00,408
- You fainted.
- I fainted?

157
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:04,523
I thought you were pretending,
and then you just... Are you OK?

158
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,064
Yeah. I guess
I got a little dizzy.

159
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,359
This is a lot to deal with.
If you need to take some time...

160
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,444
- No.
- Jessi...

161
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:15,124
Thank you for looking out for me,

162
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:17,658
- but you promised you'd help.
- And I will, but...

163
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:19,368
Kyle, I'm fine.

164
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:24,790
Let's go home and check out
Cassidy's call log.

165
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,929
<i>And here, working like
a drone we find the boyfriend.</i>

166
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,539
The boyfriend is not in the mood.

167
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:35,968
This isn't still photography.
Look alive.

168
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,859
Look around.
It's dead in here.

169
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,972
When it gets like this,
I need you to entertain me,

170
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,340
which you will not do once
you're 2,000 miles away.

171
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,975
And imagine me there,
missing you.

172
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:46,937
Thus, the whole point
of my Andi-mentary.

173
00:10:47,303 --> 00:10:49,511
When I need my Josh-fix,
I'll just pop it in.

174
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:51,002
But let me tell you. This?

175
00:10:51,102 --> 00:10:53,842
Not buyin' the DVD.
Even on clearance.

176
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:55,862
So pep up or perish.

177
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:07,222
OK, so this song, you have
to listen to the words

178
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:09,501
because they're romantic,
without being sappy.

179
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,729
Do you do a play-by-play every time
a guy gives you a mix?

180
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:14,588
Mark has good taste in music.

181
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,799
Terrific.

182
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:19,490
Sorry.
This is weird, huh?

183
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,699
Last time you were
the one making the mixes,

184
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,057
and I was forcing Hilary
to listen. But now...

185
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:29,146
- So you guys still aren't talking?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

186
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,499
Don't you think if you two
could get in the same room...?

187
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,986
There is no way I'm getting
in the same room with Hilary.

188
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:37,863
Who says Hilary wants to be
in the same room as you. You ready?

189
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,658
- For what?
- Ignoring you and hanging out with me.

190
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:49,837
You're the one who was all, "Meet me
at The Rack, we need some quality..."

191
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:51,168
Friend time?

192
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:57,689
I know I lied to get you both down here,
but this fight has gone on too long.

193
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:01,222
So I'm just gonna get us some coffee
and you two can work it out.

194
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,227
Not funny, Declan.
Open up.

195
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:08,101
This is not what I signed on for.

196
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,897
Quality friend time, ladies.

197
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:12,358
Make it happen,
and I set you free.

198
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:29,920
- You find anything?
- No. Just that

199
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,684
Cassidy likes to order takeout a lot.
He likes pizza.

200
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:35,770
His phone logs
aren't giving us anything.

201
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,313
It would help if we had
a record of Sarah's calls.

202
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:40,842
Sarah was always on the run.
She wasn't the kind of person

203
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:43,220
- to use a regular cell phone.
- Isn't.

204
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:46,848
- What?
- She isn't the kind of person.

205
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,102
You're right.
We still don't know anything for sure.

206
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:54,751
I'm sorry.

207
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,940
He wanted Andy
to move in with us?

208
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,190
Yeah, he did.
I feel terrible.

209
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,865
- He's really taking this hard.
- You said no, right?

210
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,828
Of course. I just...
wish I didn't have to.

211
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,262
There's no way we can have two kids
whose hormones are exploding

212
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:13,125
living together under our roof.

213
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,002
No one can just disappear.

214
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,490
We should go back to the apartment
and take a look around.

215
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,856
I think we're too late.
Nicole's already scrubbed the place,

216
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:22,551
and Josh and Andy have cleaned.

217
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:26,686
You were there that night.

218
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:31,802
- You're a witness.
- Kyle, Sarah was gone when I got back.

219
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:34,945
- I didn't see anything.
- You don't know if you saw anything.

220
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:37,767
But if you access your holographic
memory, you might find a clue.

221
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:40,083
- I don't know how to do that.
- I'll walk you through it.

222
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:44,021
You can recall your experiences from
that night and examine your memories.

223
00:13:44,485 --> 00:13:47,159
- I don't know.
- I'll be right here for you.

224
00:14:00,362 --> 00:14:03,133
- How do I do it?
- You just need to focus.

225
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:10,849
- Nothing is happening.
- Just relax.

226
00:14:11,114 --> 00:14:13,475
- I am relaxed.
- More relaxed.

227
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:14,519
No.

228
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:20,150
- You should get in my tub.
- Really?

229
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:23,285
It helps me.

230
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:34,902
Lay back.

231
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:43,801
Okay. Are you ready?

232
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,552
Close your eyes.

233
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:52,265
Concentrate on the night you left Latnok
and went back to the apartment.

234
00:15:01,114 --> 00:15:05,952
<i>I went inside.
It was dark. Quiet.</i>

235
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:07,245
Sarah?

236
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,411
You're okay.
I'm here with you.

237
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:15,080
What happens next?

238
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:19,563
<i>I saw the letter.</i>

239
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:24,059
<i>I read the letter.</i>

240
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
<i>She said she left.</i>

241
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,554
<i>She couldn't be my mother anymore.</i>

242
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:33,790
But Sarah didn't write
the letter. Remember?

243
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,426
- Cassidy did.
- Cassidy.

244
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:39,684
You saw him that night, too.

245
00:15:40,921 --> 00:15:42,440
That's when we met.

246
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:45,479
<i>He was friendly.</i>

247
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:48,863
<i>Relaxed.
He had his dog with him.</i>

248
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,283
- Nothing strange.
- Then you left to help me.

249
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,743
And I met Cassidy
when we were at Latnok.

250
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,392
What is it?

251
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:01,155
When I got back to the apartment,

252
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:04,280
Cassidy was already there,
in the hall.

253
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:07,966
He got back from Latnok
so quickly, ahead of me.

254
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,843
Why would he have to rush?

255
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:13,234
What did you see
when you got back?

256
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:24,266
<i>- Sorry.
- He was going to do his laundry.</i>

257
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:28,778
<i>He's just standing there,
holding the basket.</i>

258
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,779
There has to be something.

259
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:35,201
Sorry...

260
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:44,044
What is it?
What did you see?

261
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,087
Blood.

262
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:50,842
Jessi, are you okay?

263
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,803
You're burning up.

264
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,649
- How is she doing?
- We couldn't...

265
00:17:07,649 --> 00:17:09,278
She's still running a fever.

266
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:12,600
101.3, down from 102
a couple of minutes ago,

267
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,029
but up from 100.8 at the hour.

268
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,855
A human thermometer.
That can come in handy.

269
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:22,081
- Poor thing.
- Why won't it go down?

270
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,280
Well, a fever is just the body
fighting off an illness.

271
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,630
As long as it doesn't get too high,
it's good that she's sleeping it off.

272
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:31,674
People get sick.
It happens.

273
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,288
- Not really to you and Jessi, but...
- There's no other

274
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,722
- physiological signs of illness.
- That can happen with a virus.

275
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:42,227
What is it?

276
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:46,587
Jessi and I discovered some
new information about Sarah.

277
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:49,234
I don't think she abandoned Jessi.
Something happened to her.

278
00:17:50,244 --> 00:17:53,113
She's been really upset about it.
And then the fever.

279
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,602
You think her illness
is psychosomatic?

280
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:59,823
Yes. But how do I treat
a psychosomatic problem?

281
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:02,665
We might be able to help her
with therapy, but we need

282
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:06,508
- to get her fever down first.
- Right. Treat the symptoms.

283
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:09,983
I think I have an idea.

284
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,770
It's okay.

285
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,112
I've seen how rowdy my sister
can get on a sugar rush.

286
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:25,448
Probably not a good idea
to feed the animals.

287
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:27,115
All part of my plan.

288
00:18:27,868 --> 00:18:30,720
Lock the door behind me,
'cause I'm going in.

289
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,621
You're a brave man, Declan.
It's been a pleasure knowing you.

290
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:40,150
Now, listen,
this whole thing is my fault.

291
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,870
I was in a bad place,
I was drunk and I kissed her.

292
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,408
I shouldn't have done it,
but I did and now it's done.

293
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:48,411
- You guys work out your differences.
- Thanks, traitor muffin.

294
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:50,941
But no carbs for me.
It's bikini season.

295
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,464
Oh, it's not to eat.

296
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,645
You two should just get your aggression
out the way you usually do.

297
00:18:55,745 --> 00:18:59,053
Orange-flavored soda.
Flavored syrup. Need I go on?

298
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,514
You're not seriously suggesting
we have a food fight.

299
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,688
- Seemed like it helped before.
- What would help

300
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:07,062
is if some people
didn't jump to conclusions

301
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:09,065
and call their best friend a slut.

302
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:11,441
Best friends don't
break the girl code.

303
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,721
He just said it was his fault.
Why won't you accept it?

304
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,669
I'll accept it when you admit
that you wanted it to happen.

305
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:19,407
- Bring it.
- It is on.

306
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:23,522
- Thanks, man.
- Any time.

307
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:28,319
- Psst! Hey, Declan.
- What are you doing here?

308
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:30,418
Might've asked around,
I heard you hang out here.

309
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:33,505
- Is that weird?
- A little.

310
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,930
But in a good way.

311
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:40,011
Um, why are they staring at us?

312
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:44,349
They're, um...
going through a thing.

313
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,139
Uh, care to join me over here?

314
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:54,446
I don't think this is all for show.
I think he really likes her.

315
00:19:54,546 --> 00:19:55,360
I know.

316
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:58,613
- He's got the Trager gaze.
- The what?

317
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:02,912
Well, that's what I called it
when he looked at you that way.

318
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:05,995
- It's kinda dorky.
- Jealous.

319
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,485
You wish he was looking
at you like that.

320
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:10,237
- I do not.
- Do too.

321
00:20:10,337 --> 00:20:12,814
- Do not.
- Do too.

322
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:14,832
All right, fine.
You know what?

323
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:17,422
I did want him to look at me
with that stupid moony look.

324
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:20,093
I even thought he and I
might have something.

325
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:23,721
But I let it fizzle out...
because of you.

326
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,390
You did?

327
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,882
Because you're more important
to me than any guy,

328
00:20:28,982 --> 00:20:30,812
no matter how great his arms are.

329
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,733
What are we doing?
We've been fighting for weeks

330
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,237
over something Declan started
and now he's completely moved on.

331
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:42,282
I see your point.
Instead of fighting,

332
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:45,618
we should be figuring out
ways to make him suffer.

333
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,134
Yeah.

334
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,330
Let's find a way out
of here and crash his date.

335
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:03,344
I never thought I'd see your tub
being used as an actual tub.

336
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:06,300
- Her temperature's still not dropping.
- We just put the ice in.

337
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,863
Give it a little time.

338
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,084
Do you think she knows,
deep down, that Sarah's not OK?

339
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:16,969
It's possible.

340
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,053
Her reaction, the fever,

341
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:22,658
maybe her body is fighting
her deep-rooted anxiety

342
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:25,199
as if it were
some kind of infection.

343
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,538
Almost like she knows
what happened.

344
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:32,248
- What if she does?
- You mean, like a suppressed memory?

345
00:21:32,986 --> 00:21:36,738
What if Jessi witnessed something,
something she doesn't want to admit?

346
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:40,024
Kyle, in my experience, if she's gone
to such great lengths to deny it,

347
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:42,828
- she won't want to go back there.
- I could go with her.

348
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:45,136
I could access her memories,
if she lets me.

349
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:49,091
Kyle, what you're talking about,
even if I could wrap my head around it,

350
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:50,913
I'm not sure it's the best way.

351
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:54,004
I know it's extreme.
But I have to help her.

352
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,855
I have to try everything I can.

353
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:01,118
Okay.

354
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,743
Definitely not
getting out that way.

355
00:22:09,624 --> 00:22:11,371
Looks like it's gonna be up and over.

356
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:18,336
- Ew, it's dirty up here!
- Revenge is dirty work.

357
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:28,534
Oh, my shirt!

358
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:32,391
Maybe you should think twice before
leaving the house with half an outfit.

359
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,186
Excuse me, Lori, I didn't know
I should dress for hijinks.

360
00:22:44,908 --> 00:22:48,372
I so don't feel
fabulous right now.

361
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:51,411
Not your best moment, no.

362
00:22:53,196 --> 00:22:56,550
Jessi, I want to help you.

363
00:22:57,003 --> 00:22:59,877
I can try and access your memories,
but I need your permission.

364
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:02,046
Just want to sleep...

365
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,716
Sleeping won't help you
feel better. This might.

366
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,428
- I don't want to...
- We should try.

367
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,598
Remember,
I'm still here with you.

368
00:23:14,312 --> 00:23:15,184
All right.

369
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,502
What is it?

370
00:23:49,853 --> 00:23:52,059
I feel like
I'm invading her privacy.

371
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:55,134
She's remembering all
these moments that she's...

372
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:56,713
...that she's had with me.

373
00:23:56,813 --> 00:24:00,345
Sometimes people hide disturbing
thoughts or emotions with

374
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:02,419
ones that calm them.

375
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,942
Almost like a child puts a blanket

376
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,108
over a stuffed animal that frightens
them when it's time to go to sleep.

377
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:11,493
- So I'm the blanket.
- But you can't be forever.

378
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:13,826
Not if you want her
to face her memories.

379
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,207
- They must be very intense.
- Kyle,

380
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,892
you don't have
to be the one to do this.

381
00:24:22,937 --> 00:24:25,088
Yes, I do.

382
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:32,632
I want to keep trying.

383
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:37,294
I'll leave you alone
for a little while.

384
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:38,726
Thanks.

385
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,361
Jessi, I want to try again.
I need you to help me.

386
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,257
Think of a time when
you were happy,

387
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,978
safe.

388
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:57,286
Focus on that memory
and I'll be there.

389
00:25:10,357 --> 00:25:13,983
- You're here.
- I said I would be.

390
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:20,168
- This is nice.
- It is.

391
00:25:20,957 --> 00:25:23,091
And I know you
don't want to leave.

392
00:25:24,978 --> 00:25:27,988
But I have to, don't I?

393
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,871
I'll stay with you.

394
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,478
Whenever you're ready.

395
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:53,718
You have to be
the one who takes us.

396
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,221
<i>- Trager, what are you up to?
- Hils and I made up.</i>

397
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:21,946
<i>We want you to come outside
so we can thank you.</i>

398
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:24,581
Okay. Where are you guys at?

399
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:27,472
<i>What are you talking about?
We're outside on the patio.</i>

400
00:26:28,132 --> 00:26:30,039
- Where?
- Behind you.

401
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,431
Open it, Trager. Open it!

402
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:48,339
- Hi.
- Cute little blonde thing.

403
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,075
We need to talk.

404
00:26:56,195 --> 00:26:58,448
Behold the species, boyfriend.

405
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:01,731
A rare breed, prone to strange
and erratic behavior.

406
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:03,566
Nothing erratic
about what I'm doing.

407
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,391
Yon spending your paycheck
on fake tattoos and superballs.

408
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,430
You don't think
that's a little off?

409
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,368
Got it.

410
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:19,470
Andromeda Summer Faith Jensen,

411
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,305
will you marry me?

412
00:27:29,956 --> 00:27:32,368
- Well?
- Well...

413
00:27:32,956 --> 00:27:36,090
- Are you serious?
- Totally, 100 percent.

414
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:39,164
I love you
and I want to get married.

415
00:27:39,772 --> 00:27:42,994
What kind of idiot,
asinine idea is that?

416
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,830
The only kind that will
keep you from leaving me.

417
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:49,417
Oh, my God.
You've lost your mind.

418
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,627
Why? Why is it so crazy?

419
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,006
I could write an encyclopedia
on why it's crazy.

420
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,134
Well, start writing, because
I'm not taking no for an answer.

421
00:28:01,191 --> 00:28:03,763
You might not believe this,
but I'm quite the coffee brewer.

422
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:05,681
You're right,
I don't believe you.

423
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,991
- No! You can't do this.
- But you questioned my skills.

424
00:28:10,091 --> 00:28:12,393
You can't come back here.
What if my boss comes back?

425
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:14,976
Then he'll get the best
cappuccino he's ever tasted.

426
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:19,430
Hey, I've seen one
of these symbols before.

427
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:23,450
Kyle has a ring with this on it.

428
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,166
- That's impossible.
- No, I'm pretty positive.

429
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:27,838
He got it from his birth father.

430
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:30,166
- Kyle was adopted?
- By the Tragers, yeah.

431
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,877
- Who's his birth father?
- I don't know.

432
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,612
- Adam something.
- Adam.

433
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,200
- Adam Baylin?
- You know what?

434
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,334
I shouldn't even be talking about this.
It's Kyle's business.

435
00:28:49,468 --> 00:28:51,983
- What is that sound?
- I don't know.

436
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:56,734
It sounds like butterfly wings.

437
00:28:56,992 --> 00:28:58,611
Jessi, you said you saw blood.

438
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:04,200
Yes. In the laundry basket.

439
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,952
On a towel stuffed
down at the bottom.

440
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,906
We can stop if you need to.

441
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:14,081
No, I can do this.

442
00:29:21,904 --> 00:29:23,935
I don't see anything else.

443
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:26,222
Try looking at
the memory differently.

444
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,560
At crime scenes, detectives use
ultraviolet lights to view evidence.

445
00:29:33,911 --> 00:29:36,815
You mean blood evidence, right?

446
00:29:37,785 --> 00:29:38,692
Yes.

447
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:41,028
Are you okay?

448
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:49,983
We can do the same
by adjusting our vision

449
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:54,880
to display the ultraviolet part of the
spectrum our eyes normally can't see.

450
00:29:56,898 --> 00:29:57,939
I'll try it.

451
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,094
It's working.

452
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:08,381
I see something.

453
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:20,776
It's more blood.

454
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:23,446
And more.

455
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:31,912
Jessi!

456
00:30:35,468 --> 00:30:36,386
Jessi!

457
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,004
Jessi, it's okay.

458
00:30:43,612 --> 00:30:47,052
I'm sorry. We're done.
We're done. I'm sorry.

459
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,126
Is she OK?

460
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:50,890
We're stopping. Don't worry.
We're done. It's okay.

461
00:30:51,178 --> 00:30:52,746
That's it. I'm calling a doctor.

462
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:56,006
It's OK, Jessi. We're not going back.
We'll figure this out another way.

463
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:56,979
No.

464
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:06,123
She's in there.
She's in his apartment.

465
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:09,532
- Jessi, stop.
- Help me! I need to get in there.

466
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,639
Yon can't. It's a memory.
It's already happened.

467
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:13,996
No! Let go of me.
I can help! Sarah!

468
00:31:14,318 --> 00:31:17,009
- Sarah!
- Jessi, please. Stop.

469
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,091
Stop. Okay.

470
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,212
What is that?

471
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:26,926
What? Do you know what it is?

472
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:30,679
- You do.
- Jessi...

473
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,306
What? I don't...

474
00:31:34,803 --> 00:31:36,809
No. No!

475
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:39,108
- Maybe it's not.
- It's a heartbeat.

476
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,623
It's Sarah's heartbeat.

477
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,898
Why didn't I recognize it?

478
00:31:48,712 --> 00:31:51,527
Because it's slower
than it should be.

479
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:54,306
- Kyle, she's dying in there!
- Look at me.

480
00:31:54,406 --> 00:31:56,288
- I can't!
- Look at me!

481
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,416
Look at me. Don't look away.
I'm right here.

482
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:03,712
It's just you and me.

483
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:07,007
- Kyle...
- I know. I know.

484
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,479
Just stay with me.

485
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:30,804
No!

486
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:35,327
He killed her!
I was here all along!

487
00:32:35,427 --> 00:32:38,455
- And I didn't save her!
- You couldn't. You didn't know.

488
00:32:41,021 --> 00:32:42,237
She's dead.

489
00:32:44,155 --> 00:32:46,255
My mother is dead.

490
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,864
I don't know what they said but...

491
00:33:41,272 --> 00:33:43,955
Apparently, it wasn't
what I thought it would be.

492
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,210
I'll call you.

493
00:33:49,942 --> 00:33:51,943
OK, so she's kind of adorable.

494
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:54,314
You've always been a sucker
for cute and smart.

495
00:33:54,414 --> 00:33:56,469
- We wanted to sabotage you.
- We did.

496
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:00,046
But then when we were trying to explain
to her what a jerk you were...

497
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:03,251
We realized it was pretty sweet of you
to get us to patch things up.

498
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:05,758
Does this mean you two
are back on track?

499
00:34:05,858 --> 00:34:08,457
Looks like your dirty double-cross
served its purpose.

500
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:11,500
Well, watching you guys fight
was breaking my heart,

501
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,196
even if it did
inflate my ego a little.

502
00:34:14,296 --> 00:34:16,989
- Oh!
- It was so not about you.

503
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:19,688
I'm just glad you two
are friends again.

504
00:34:19,946 --> 00:34:22,421
But if that blonde
little bimbo hurts you...

505
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:24,730
Just say the word
and we'll crush her.

506
00:34:38,672 --> 00:34:41,466
Don't worry. I'm okay.

507
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:47,074
I never could get used to Kyle
seeing through me all the time,

508
00:34:47,174 --> 00:34:49,726
but with two of you,
I guess now I'll have to.

509
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,046
I guess.

510
00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:57,911
I know you had to relive
something today, Jessi.

511
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:00,764
Something that you saw
that was really bad.

512
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:04,101
You don't have
to tell me about it.

513
00:35:04,973 --> 00:35:07,396
- I will. I just...
- It's too much right now.

514
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:10,873
- And that's OK.
- One day, I'll tell you.

515
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,819
- I promise.
- When you're ready.

516
00:35:14,163 --> 00:35:17,114
And whenever that is, I promise
I'll still be around to hear it.

517
00:35:19,104 --> 00:35:20,867
I'm not going anywhere.

518
00:35:23,424 --> 00:35:25,796
I guess you can see through me, too.

519
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:28,876
I want to be here for you.

520
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:31,671
You are.

521
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:49,371
- Can we talk about it?
- Not until your answer is yes.

522
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:52,855
Then it'll be a hundred
years of silent solitude.

523
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,957
Fine, I'll talk.

524
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,784
I'm sorry, okay?

525
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,483
I know you meant well,

526
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:07,957
but getting married
won't solve our problems.

527
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,503
In fact, I think our collective three
moms and a dad would probably kill you,

528
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,140
and then me, and then
probably you again.

529
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:21,762
Seriously?
This is how you're gonna be?

530
00:36:34,303 --> 00:36:37,042
- What the hell is your problem?
- Finally, he speaks!

531
00:36:37,142 --> 00:36:39,833
Yeah, and here's
what he has to say!

532
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:45,917
No... you... didn't.

533
00:36:52,215 --> 00:36:55,462
It's gonna stink later!

534
00:36:58,864 --> 00:37:01,717
You see, this is the Josh
I'm gonna miss.

535
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:20,236
Do I want to know?

536
00:37:21,651 --> 00:37:23,764
- I'm going to my room.
- Since when do you want

537
00:37:23,864 --> 00:37:26,887
to go to your room? When I send you,
you don't go to your room.

538
00:37:26,987 --> 00:37:30,124
- It's just been a long day.
- Too long for a G-Force marathon?

539
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,704
Come on,
I'll let you kick my ass.

540
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,798
I said ass and I get nothin'?

541
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,190
Josh...

542
00:37:50,365 --> 00:37:51,977
I don't know what to do.

543
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,482
- Hi.
- Hi.

544
00:38:21,563 --> 00:38:23,160
How do you feel?

545
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,840
Exhausted.

546
00:38:26,232 --> 00:38:27,366
Drained.

547
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:30,465
But a little bit free.

548
00:38:31,785 --> 00:38:32,795
Good.

549
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:36,383
You didn't tell Nicole.

550
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:39,726
I don't think anyone
should know about this yet.

551
00:38:39,826 --> 00:38:42,027
- I know it's not over.
- No.

552
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,398
We need to find out
why he did it.

553
00:38:44,498 --> 00:38:45,590
We will.

554
00:38:47,456 --> 00:38:50,577
But there's something
I want you to see.

555
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:53,751
What is it?

556
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,091
There's a service
that backs up cell phone data.

557
00:38:57,191 --> 00:38:59,795
- Even disposable cell phones.
- Like Sarah's?

558
00:39:00,091 --> 00:39:02,072
- I found her records.
- You did?

559
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:06,551
The call records lead nowhere.
But there were pictures she took.

560
00:39:08,164 --> 00:39:09,463
Of what?

561
00:39:12,836 --> 00:39:13,642
You.

562
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:26,178
<i>Memories are our way
of keeping the past alive.</i>

563
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:29,621
<i>Some are so painful we never
want to visit them again.</i>

564
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:33,707
<i>But a memory can also be a gift,
something we can open again </i>

565
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:36,717
<i>and again in orderer
to fill ourselves with happiness.</i>

566
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:09,633
<i>And sometimes a moment becomes
a memory the instant it's happening</i>

567
00:41:10,592 --> 00:41:12,798
<i>because it is so true,</i>

568
00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:15,889
<i>so pure and so significant,</i>

569
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:19,554
<i>you want to capture it forever.</i>

570
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,211
- Nate?
- What's up?

571
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,974
Do you see anyone hanging
around my office?

572
00:42:34,074 --> 00:42:36,633
Actually, I caught Jessi in there,
this morning.

573
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:38,756
- Jessi?
- Why? Something's wrong?

574
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,699
No, no. Just curious.

575
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:44,043
Sorry to interrupt.
Have a good night.

576
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:45,438
Yeah, good night.
