00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,665
Previously on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,914
I don't remember taking this.

3
00:00:03,968 --> 00:00:05,400
It's not us.
That's Adam.

4
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:08,150
I have to find her. I have
to know who this woman is.

5
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:10,765
Brian told me all about
the girl in the picture, Sarah.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,800
He said he created me from Sarah's
genetic material after she died.

7
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,951
- How sweet is this?
- That's awesome.

8
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:18,816
- You're awesome.
- You're kind of awesome, too.

9
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:21,078
- Get away from me.
- Hey. Whoa.

10
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:22,710
Stay away from me!

11
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:25,708
- You know him?
- He's my T.A.

12
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:29,012
You're arrogant
and conceited.

13
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,261
And you're bitter
and hostile.

14
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:32,371
There's so much
we don't know about each other.

15
00:00:32,696 --> 00:00:34,432
And I wanna know
everything about you.

16
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,772
I wanna know everything
about you, too.

17
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:38,802
I don't want you
to see Kyle anymore.

18
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:41,531
He's the only one that understands
what it's like to be me.

19
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:43,600
But he doesn't believe in you.
Not the way that I do.

20
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,952
They just don't think
you're as good as Kyle.

21
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:47,902
They're wrong.
You can be better.

22
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:52,101
Don't forget, I am more like you
than any of these people here.

23
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:53,801
More than the Tragers
and more than Amanda.

24
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,503
<i>I thought you said
Adam Baylin was dead.

25
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:58,201
I scattered his ashes.

26
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,272
Adam!

27
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:03,642
Hello, Kyle.

28
00:01:08,598 --> 00:01:11,303
<i>The human body has its own
built-in repair kit.</i>

29
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:14,130
<i>My response to injury
is automatic.</i>

30
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:17,601
<i>When the skin is torn, the brain
activates platelets in the blood.</i>

31
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:21,203
<i>Drawn to the injury,
the blood forms a clot.</i>

32
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:23,703
But you have greater control
of your brain.

33
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:28,201
It can isolate the platelets and
direct them to an injury sooner,

34
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:31,263
and heal faster.

35
00:01:31,506 --> 00:01:33,602
That's what you did
after you were shot.

36
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:35,963
Well, what took me months,

37
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,663
with your gifts,
it'd only take weeks.

38
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:41,003
I still can't believe you're
here standing in front of me.

39
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:43,701
Now you know
anything is possible.

40
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,860
Draw the oil
through the water...

41
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:53,662
<i>like platelets
through your blood.

42
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:03,472
<i>What Baylin was teaching me
may have been true</i>

43
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:05,180
<i>for wounds that pierce the skin,</i>

44
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:07,420
<i>but I also knew
of ruptures and breaks</i>

45
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:10,593
<i>between people that were
easier to cause than to cure,</i>

46
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:13,161
<i>like my friendship with Jessi.</i>

47
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:15,800
<i>But that was a rift I still
didn't know how to heal.</i>

48
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:23,861
I'm glad to see
you've kept yourself sharp.

49
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,803
Foss has trained you well.

50
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:32,701
Adam, I need
to talk to you.

51
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:35,880
About Jessi?

52
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:38,073
You made it seem
like I was the only one.

53
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:40,641
Well, I thought you were.

54
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:44,403
According to Latnok, Brian Taylor's been
acting in his own interest for years.

55
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:47,490
- I just didn't realize it.
- But you did.

56
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:49,291
You sent me that message
not to trust him.

57
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,360
Based on a hunch.

58
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:53,363
I had no idea
that Taylor

59
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:56,602
was still conducting the
experiment after I created you.

60
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:59,521
- Neither did Latnok.
- But Taylor is Latnok.

61
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:01,501
Not anymore.

62
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:04,773
You may have noticed
he's no longer wearing the ring.

63
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:07,543
Once I recovered and Latnok
put all of the pieces together,

64
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,813
he was stripped
of his affiliation.

65
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:12,692
They don't approve
of what he did.

66
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:14,820
Jessi should've
never been created.

67
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:17,112
But she was.

68
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:19,602
And all she wants is to feel
like she matters to somebody.

69
00:03:20,057 --> 00:03:22,362
- You can't turn your backs on her now.
- We're not.

70
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:26,000
On the contrary. We're all very
concerned about Jessi's well-being.

71
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:30,003
In fact, we're looking to you
to take care of her.

72
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:36,502
That hasn't been easy.

73
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:38,682
And she's mad at me now.

74
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:41,062
You have to keep trying.
I know Brian Taylor.

75
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:42,373
He's gonna push her too hard

76
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:44,740
just to prove that it wasn't
a mistake to create her.

77
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:49,072
And if Jessi is anything at all like
her mother, she'll get carried away.

78
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,513
She won't know
when to stop.

79
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:58,901
I'm increasing your incline
and speed by five percent.

80
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:00,543
Fine.

81
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,203
- You sure?
- I said I'm fine.

82
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:05,171
All right.

83
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:13,701
Move it.

84
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,160
There's no water in it.
I can't manipulate the polarity.

85
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,053
You've mastered that.
Challenge yourself.

86
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:19,523
But it's impossible.

87
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:21,700
Not for you.

88
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:45,732
- How was that?
- Incredible.

89
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:58,142
- Need a break?
- No.

90
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:00,782
I'm just getting started.

<b>Kyle XY
2x19 - First Cut Is The Deepest</b>

94
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,462
I think you do more homework
than your students.

95
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,400
I'm the teacher. I have to be
the smartest one in the class.

96
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,592
Speaking of which,
how'd it go?

97
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:26,642
With Adam? Good.

98
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,613
He's teaching me
about healing.

99
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:30,100
He healed himself
from a gunshot wound.

100
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:31,453
I'm sure he has a lot to offer.

101
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:33,200
You know,
we'd really love to meet him.

102
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:36,001
Thanks.

103
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,272
But I don't think he's really
comfortable around people.

104
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,250
He's spent a lot of time
on his own.

105
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:42,400
Well, no pressure.
Whenever he's ready.

106
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:46,011
He said it's imperative
that I reconnect with Jessi.

107
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:49,803
You think we could go
to U-Dub with you tomorrow?

108
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:51,680
U- Dub? Why?

109
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:54,031
It turns out that Sarah
was a student there with Adam.

110
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:57,152
And I think Jessi'd really like to
see where her mother went to school.

111
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,361
It's fine with me.

112
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,660
Great.

113
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,520
What?

114
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:12,161
Kyle's coming to work with me.
That never ends well.

115
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:39,002
What are you doing?

116
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:42,903
Trying to put a lesson Adam
Baylin taught me into practice.

117
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:44,901
Is he teaching
how to shave?

118
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:46,771
Heal a wound.

119
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:48,973
Whoa! Cool.

120
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:53,503
Go ahead.
Seal it up.

121
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,891
- Is it working?
- Shh.

122
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:02,300
Hey, if you pull this off
and keep practicing,

123
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:05,202
maybe you can give
curing Andy's cancer a shot.

124
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:08,002
Josh, I can't even get
this small cut to stop bleeding.

125
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:10,972
Yeah. What's up with that?

126
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:14,200
- Do you wanna try?
- Draw my own blood?

127
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:16,671
Are you crazy?

128
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:45,703
What are you doing here?

129
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,322
I needed to talk to you.

130
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,372
Did you ever hear
of a phone?

131
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:55,302
- You won't take my calls.
- How about the front door?

132
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:58,300
I'm being direct,
like you.

133
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,800
Can I come in?

134
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:13,441
I hope I didn't
startle you.

135
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:16,101
I heard you coming.

136
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:18,980
It's hard to be quiet
when you're scaling a building.

137
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:23,001
I am.
I've done it lots of times.

138
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:24,281
Oh.

139
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:29,293
Well, it's tricky.
The ledges are narrow.

140
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:33,713
So, what do you want?

141
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:37,741
Every time you've tried to talk
to me lately, I've put you off.

142
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:40,923
- I wanna make it up to you.
- Don't bother.

143
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:44,890
It's not a bother. I've
thought about what you said.

144
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:47,648
You're right. There is no
one more like me than you.

145
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:53,302
You climbed all the way up here
just to tell me that?

146
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,301
I wanna tell you
Adam's recovered.

147
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,140
He's told me a way we could find out
more about our history,

148
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:00,602
more about Sarah.

149
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,401
Sarah? How?

150
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:12,143
- Is this where she studied?
- Could be.

151
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:14,530
- Well, what did Adam tell you?
- Not much.

152
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:16,900
He thought we should discover
things about her on our own.

153
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:18,970
But he said we could start
with these articles.

154
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:20,991
They're from the archives
of the school paper.

155
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:22,843
She made the paper?

156
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:25,433
- What do you think she did?
- Let's find out.

157
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:26,913
Okay.

158
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:32,901
Hi.

159
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:36,002
- Hey, you working today?
- Worse. Prom committee.

160
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:38,322
Since when are you not
excited about a committee?

161
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,203
I thought you had the word
tattooed on your...

162
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:42,061
I'm not even gonna
let you finish that sentence.

163
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:45,331
My mom's decided that I need to keep
all my extracurricular obligations

164
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:49,003
that might look good on my college
applications, but not let me go to prom.

165
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:54,003
Anyhow, since you're in charge, can
you do something about the music?

166
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,783
- What about it?
- I don't know. Make it not suck.

167
00:09:56,898 --> 00:09:59,402
- Or maybe just suck less.
- Let's see.

168
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:02,773
I have less than four weeks to book
a venue, plan a theme, decorations,

169
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,783
food, transportation, security and
photographers

170
00:10:04,815 --> 00:10:06,411
for an event
I won't be attending.

171
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:10,290
I'll be sure to make the music
my top priority.

172
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:13,403
When did Pollyanna
learn to be facetious?

173
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:15,110
Stop it.

174
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:20,313
She was amazing, brilliant.

175
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:22,783
No wonder she and Adam
were friends.

176
00:10:22,886 --> 00:10:25,260
I'll bet she was smarter.

177
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:30,713
I don't know.
But she definitely was special.

178
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,530
All those honors and awards.
She was the best.

179
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:41,602
What else is there?

180
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:48,431
"Honor student sabotages
biochem final. "

181
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:51,063
"The Biochemistry department
canceled the final exam

182
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:54,453
"after discovering honor student
Sarah Emerson stole the test and

183
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:57,520
vandalized the lecture hall
in the science building. "

184
00:10:57,608 --> 00:11:02,123
Vandalize it.
Where's the lecture hall?

185
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:18,900
- Is your upper lymph node swollen?
- No.

186
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:23,803
- What about on this side?
- Eye on the prize. Focus.

187
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:30,050
- You feel hot.
- Thank you.

188
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:34,230
I mean, you feel hot,
as in fever.

189
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:37,262
When I said
I wanted to play doctor,

190
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:40,602
I was expecting inappropriate "over the
shirt" action, not J. Trager, mini-M.D.

191
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:43,603
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Be grabby.

192
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,863
You sure you're okay?

193
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:49,703
If your future self ever travels back
in time to this moment, he'll slap you.

194
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:52,442
I am here on your lap
bringing the sexy,

195
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:55,702
and your mind and hands are
everywhere but where they should be.

196
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:58,273
I can't stop thinking about
your test tomorrow. Aren't you?

197
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:02,371
Thinking about whether I still have
cancer or not? Never entered my mind.

198
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:09,273
You know what?
Forget it.

199
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,761
- Don't get mad.
- All I want is a diversion.

200
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:14,841
I'm just a diversion?

201
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:16,203
You know what I mean.

202
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:21,303
I think we need help.

203
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,503
- Hi, friend.
- Hi.

204
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:32,501
- What ya doin'?
- Studying.

205
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:34,360
Why?

206
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:36,261
Nothing else to do.

207
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:41,601
Come on. Things aren't that
boring around here, are they?

208
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:44,202
Oh, you miss fighting
the evil empire.

209
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:45,772
I do not.

210
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:47,800
You totally do.

211
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:53,100
I totally do.
I'm bored out of my mind.

212
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:55,060
I'm not plotting
against bad guys,

213
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:57,311
I'm not playing basketball,
I'm not having sex.

214
00:12:57,336 --> 00:13:00,323
- You're not having sex?
- Not the point.

215
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:06,472
- I just feel...
- Restless?

216
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:08,893
Sort of.

217
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:11,483
Do you have a Lori word
handy for things like this?

218
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,902
You think those little
nuggets of gold grow on trees?

219
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:19,731
We'll find you an adventure,
I promise.

220
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:34,500
Well, whatever she did
is long gone by now.

221
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:38,501
No, it's not.

222
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:43,070
Look. She drew
the Latnok symbol.

223
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,702
What does that have to do with
canceling the biochemistry exam?

224
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:54,801
Look closely.
She gave everyone the answers.

225
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,771
Why would the school
leave that up there?

226
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:07,800
The article said even the professors
couldn't help being impressed.

227
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:10,651
I guess they didn't have
the heart to paint over it.

228
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,840
My mother was awesome.

229
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:25,793
Since you guys are here,
I could use your help in class.

230
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:27,502
Here's the deal.

231
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:29,960
Each one of these computers
have been loaded up with

232
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:32,082
the security encryption programs
you've all been working on.

233
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:34,393
But today I have
a little surprise.

234
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,802
Two students from Beachwood will
be trying to hack those programs.

235
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:40,802
- Isn't Beachwood a high school?
- Yes, it is.

236
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,401
You have a problem
with that, Alexander?

237
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:47,903
No offense, Stephen, but the NSA
would have a hard time

238
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:51,270
cracking my sub-laced elliptically
curved 384-bit module system

239
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:53,471
with a 256-bit encryption.

240
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:55,303
Did you actually
just say that?

241
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,563
Yes. Why?

242
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:00,302
Well, she might be in high
school, but she's a girl,

243
00:15:00,345 --> 00:15:03,803
and she's talking to you, which
means you're way ahead of the game.

244
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:06,321
So don't blow it.

245
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:10,290
All right, Kyle. Is there anything you
and Jessi need besides a little quiet?

246
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:13,002
- A timer.
- For what?

247
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,831
To judge performance
and to see who wins.

248
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:17,730
Why is that important?

249
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:20,552
Because that's how
you find out who's the best.

250
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:24,870
I guess a timer
will be fine.

251
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,463
Okay.

252
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:32,342
Ready, set, go.

253
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:35,340
Okay, don't be shocked.

254
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:37,902
We're about to do something
totally out of character.

255
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,952
- What?
- Volunteer.

256
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,482
- For prom committee?
- Mmm, more like a subcommittee.

257
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:45,600
We're here to help you
with your music woes.

258
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:48,142
There's this amazing deejay
who spins out of U.W.

259
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:51,323
His mash-ups are ridiculous.
He's got this whole following on-line.

260
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:53,613
You should read up on him.
Djspinbrandt.com.

261
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:55,471
He is fabulous.

262
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:58,232
Sounds fine.
So what's the catch?

263
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:01,251
A little matter of
a thousand-dollar deposit.

264
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:04,211
But if you write us a check,
we'll book him for you.

265
00:16:04,305 --> 00:16:06,080
You want me to give you guys
a thousand dollars

266
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:07,420
for someone I've never heard of?

267
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:09,731
No offense honney-bunny, but the fact
that you haven't heard of him

268
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:10,903
is actually an endorsement.

269
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,400
- Hillary.
- No, she's right.

270
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:16,463
When it comes to that kind of
stuff, I'm a little behind the game.

271
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,392
Facetious and self-aware.

272
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:21,553
I think I might
start liking you.

273
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:23,651
Given the fact
you had sex with my ex-boyfriend

274
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:25,442
while we were dating,
I don't really care.

275
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:28,123
Facetious, self-aware,
and spicy.

276
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:31,763
Anyway, SpinBrandt's working
tonight at a bar on campus.

277
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:35,301
We could go there and track him
down and convince him to do it.

278
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:37,270
I can't go to a bar.

279
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,220
They don't start carding
until after 7:00.

280
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:40,872
It's just a regular restaurant
before then.

281
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:43,753
We could go, book our guy and be
out of there before we're illegal.

282
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:45,312
Even your mom
can't find fault in that.

283
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:48,600
Believe me, my mom can find
fault in anything.

284
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:53,300
Well, then, just write us a blank check,
and we'll take care of everything.

285
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:59,302
- We're gonna need a ride.
- I've got it covered.

286
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:12,491
I just cracked
the fifth program.

287
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:16,192
- Me, too.
- Getting a little worried?

288
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:19,630
- Hmm? No, not at all.
- You should be.

289
00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:22,913
Kyle, how's it coming?

290
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:24,371
I'm putting together
second orders of referential.

291
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:26,402
I'll attack
the faults in the weak keys.

292
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:28,760
"Weak keys." There are none.

293
00:17:28,818 --> 00:17:32,100
Actually, there's just no way to check
for them before doing the key expansion.

294
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:36,572
I'm locked out.

295
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:39,502
Behold the victor!

296
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:42,801
Not by you. By Jessi.

297
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:47,020
Done.

298
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,650
- Your program's toast.
- What happened?

299
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:01,163
- I'm not sure.
- Well, after I hacked in,

300
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,301
I went back and reverse engineered
the encryption so Kyle couldn't enter.

301
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:05,602
Sweet.

302
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:12,882
That was really nice of you
to do that for Jessi.

303
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,492
- Do what?
- Let her win.

304
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:17,160
I didn't. She beat me.

305
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:19,702
I knew I recognized
your face from somewhere.

306
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:22,690
- What do you mean?
- You're famous.

307
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:26,210
<i>Just for the record,

308
00:18:26,276 --> 00:18:29,901
I wanna say I think this
is a very bad idea.

309
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:32,180
Mom, we're out of options.

310
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:36,652
Teetering on the brink of a relational
train wreck. You are our last hope.

311
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:39,001
Okay.

312
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,692
So, what's on your mind?

313
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:44,630
She never takes anything seriously.
It's all a big joke to her.

314
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:46,673
He's like a television
with only one channel.

315
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:48,681
I'm not asking
for soap-opera seriousness.

316
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,501
A little adultness
isn't too much to ask.

317
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:52,082
I have to jump on him
to get him to touch me.

318
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:53,970
That's all she thinks about.
I'm not a piece of meat.

319
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:56,211
On a scale of one to 10, do you
know what our make-out level is?

320
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,222
Okay, stop.

321
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,183
We have some work to do.

322
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,113
Huh. So, why am I famous?

323
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:13,061
Well, not you exactly. Unless,
besides hacking computers,

324
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:14,530
you've managed
to master time travel.

325
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:17,622
- Not yet.
- Funny.

326
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:20,500
Uh, but if it's not me,
then why are we here?

327
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:24,820
Well, I just wanted to see if the
sequel matches up to the original.

328
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,822
It's Sarah.

329
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,321
I can't believe she played pool.

330
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,510
I play pool.
Lots of people play pool.

331
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,031
They say Sarah was an artist.

332
00:19:57,076 --> 00:19:59,900
- What's straight pool?
- It's called 14.1 continuous.

333
00:19:59,968 --> 00:20:02,362
It's considered to be the
truest test of a billiard skill.

334
00:20:02,406 --> 00:20:03,513
There's 15 balls in a rack.

335
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:05,783
So it's shooting as many
as you can until you miss.

336
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:09,962
The world record
was 625 balls sunk in a row.

337
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:12,582
Legend has it
Sarah shot 626.

338
00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:14,111
Six in the corner.

339
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:20,501
World record. Huh.

340
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:22,640
Yeah, well, actually,
she disappeared,

341
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:25,283
according to the story, before
anyone could really verify it.

342
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:26,922
Why would she do that?

343
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:30,891
We should go. Stephen's
office hours will be over soon.

344
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,361
Eight in the side.

345
00:20:35,757 --> 00:20:38,592
No. I wanna play pool.

346
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:41,582
We don't really have
much time, Jessi.

347
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:44,331
Then we better get started.

348
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:49,031
Excuse me. Thanks.
You wanna play?

349
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:58,480
You call this an adventure?

350
00:20:58,806 --> 00:21:00,480
Come on. U-Dub.

351
00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:04,050
The return to the scene
of your first secret mission.

352
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:06,691
Oh, you mean, where you spent
the night with some guy,

353
00:21:06,737 --> 00:21:07,901
and I stood at
the side of the road

354
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:11,103
waiting for Kyle to come back out of
the woods and not tell me anything?

355
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,080
The memory was better
in my head.

356
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:14,612
You coming in?

357
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:16,422
No. I'm gonna go watch
the team practice,

358
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,262
see if I can grab
a moment with the coach.

359
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:21,063
- Call me when you're ready to go.
- Will do.

360
00:21:22,956 --> 00:21:24,330
Let's go.

361
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:29,741
<i>- Come on girls. Let's do this.
- I'd better not get involved in this.</i>

362
00:21:33,147 --> 00:21:34,551
College bars.

363
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:38,431
- Good times.
- Hey, is that Jessi?

364
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:40,081
Six in the corner.

365
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:43,231
Oh, no.

366
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:48,341
- What's the matter?
- I can't go out there.

367
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:49,951
If she sees me here,
she'll bust me to my mom.

368
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:52,760
Come on.
She's not that evil, is she?

369
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,872
- Alrighty, then.
- I'll wait in here.

370
00:21:55,905 --> 00:21:57,902
- You guys go handle the deejay.
- Um, yeah.

371
00:21:57,938 --> 00:22:00,011
We kind of have a problem
with that now, too.

372
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:01,130
What do you mean?

373
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:03,560
Apparently he doesn't go
on until 7:30.

374
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:05,911
- And they start carding
at 7:00. - Uh-huh.

375
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:07,920
Not a problem,
little Brownies.

376
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:10,331
We'll just hang out here in
the bathroom until 7 o'clock,

377
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:12,322
then sneak back out to the bar.

378
00:22:12,356 --> 00:22:14,101
They only card at the door.

379
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,201
That's a terrible plan.
Will it work?

380
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:19,380
Trust me.
I'm a professional.

381
00:22:19,387 --> 00:22:20,512
I don't think we should do this.

382
00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:23,283
We've come this far.
An extra hour won't kill us.

383
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:25,321
Please, please, please
please, please!

384
00:22:25,336 --> 00:22:28,680
We're so close to musical
victory and prom greatness.

385
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:34,851
I've totally just succumbed
to peer pressure.

386
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,570
Welcome to our worlds.

387
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:41,190
Okay, relationships
are hard work.

388
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:44,031
- Tell me about it.
- And communication

389
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,120
can be the hardest.

390
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:50,863
What many couples do is share
private thoughts on a regular basis.

391
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:54,483
It's a good way of maintaining
their... intimacy.

392
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:56,511
Thanks to me losing
at the Madacorp picnic,

393
00:22:56,565 --> 00:22:58,883
she already knows everything
there is to know about me.

394
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:02,072
- That's depressing.
- Andy.

395
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:07,462
I want you to share with Josh
something you've never told him.

396
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:17,250
Everyone thinks that "Andy"
is short for "Andrea. "

397
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,762
And I let people think that,

398
00:23:21,955 --> 00:23:26,793
but in actuality,
my moms named me Andromeda.

399
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:29,862
Andromeda? They named you
after a TV show?

400
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,943
It's from Greek mythology,
moron.

401
00:23:31,998 --> 00:23:33,451
It means ruler of all men.

402
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,682
At least it's better than having an
O-Town poster hanging in my bedroom...

403
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:38,111
You promised you would
never mention that.

404
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:40,382
Well, if the tight pants fit,
wear 'em, boy band groupie.

405
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:42,602
- You are such a liar!
- I'm not the liar. You are.

406
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:43,730
We are so done!

407
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:45,711
You're right.
We are so done! For good!

408
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:49,212
- That's it. I'm outta here.
- Enough. You, out.

409
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:51,793
Wait, you can't do that. You're
supposed to be our therapist.

410
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:53,981
Right now, I'm your mom
and Andy's therapist.

411
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:55,583
Move it.

412
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:02,861
Tough love. Cool.

413
00:24:04,848 --> 00:24:06,402
326.

414
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:08,820
Seven ball in the corner.

415
00:24:17,097 --> 00:24:18,970
You seem to know
a lot about Sarah.

416
00:24:19,386 --> 00:24:21,630
When you spend enough time in
here, you hear all the stories.

417
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:23,783
She's a legend
in the science building.

418
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:25,602
You guys should check out
this picture she drew.

419
00:24:25,686 --> 00:24:26,571
We saw it.

420
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:28,890
<i>- It's pretty awesome, right?
- Yeah.

421
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:31,351
Do you know
what happened to her?

422
00:24:31,877 --> 00:24:34,180
Yeah. Um, it's sad.

423
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:36,960
I heard that she
just lost it.

424
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:40,040
She went nuts.

425
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:45,372
She became obsessed. She had
to be the best at everything.

426
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,632
And supposedly,
it killed her.

427
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,590
Tell me more.

428
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:54,852
What is that?

429
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:57,461
That's Josh's
third birthday party.

430
00:24:57,527 --> 00:24:59,460
He was going through
his Tarzan phase.

431
00:24:59,505 --> 00:25:03,633
I can see. Everything.

432
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:12,700
I know
how special he is,

433
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,440
and I know
how much he cares.

434
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:17,181
But?

435
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:22,073
I have not one,
but two moms.

436
00:25:23,025 --> 00:25:25,650
I have three different doctors
making sure

437
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:28,850
I don't do one
teeny, tiny thing wrong.

438
00:25:29,405 --> 00:25:31,880
I don't need my boyfriend
to do it, too.

439
00:25:33,468 --> 00:25:37,581
We don't go anywhere
or stay out too late

440
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:40,322
or do stupid things
just to do them.

441
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:44,462
- I'm...
- You're what?

442
00:25:44,797 --> 00:25:47,100
I'm going in
for my checkup tomorrow.

443
00:25:47,448 --> 00:25:49,403
It'll tell me
if I'm better or not.

444
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:55,663
And if I'm not,
things are gonna get real bad.

445
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:59,063
I'm afraid he's gonna forget
how much fun we have together.

446
00:25:59,218 --> 00:26:02,132
I don't wanna be
that sucky downer

447
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:05,973
he has to hang out with after
school every day because he has to.

448
00:26:06,756 --> 00:26:08,490
I couldn't deal with that.

449
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:13,650
This is ridiculous.
It's past 6:30.

450
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:16,451
- Maybe he's already setting up.
- I'll go check.

451
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:19,653
God, I look pretty today.

452
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,362
Crap.

453
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,413
Is your father know
that you're in a bar ?

454
00:26:26,207 --> 00:26:28,263
Look, I know that you
don't know me as anything

455
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:31,132
other than the psychotic walking
mood swing who pepper-sprayed you,

456
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,543
but could you pretend
you didn't just see me?

457
00:26:33,595 --> 00:26:35,171
You want me to not tell
my new boss

458
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:38,122
that his teenage daughter
is hanging out at a college bar?

459
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:41,372
What are you doing here?

460
00:26:41,427 --> 00:26:43,771
I'm trying to book the deejay
for an event.

461
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:47,221
- What kind of event?
- Uh, you know, dance thing.

462
00:26:47,428 --> 00:26:49,512
- High school dance thing?
- Maybe.

463
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:52,392
A prom! You wanna ask
a deejay who spins at

464
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:54,953
the biggest parties on campus
to a high school prom?

465
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:56,003
What's wrong with that?

466
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:57,890
Well, for one,
it's in high school.

467
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:00,860
High school kids are,
well, stupid.

468
00:27:01,978 --> 00:27:03,853
I'm in high school, jackass.

469
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:06,491
You're really making a good case on
why I shouldn't bust you to your dad.

470
00:27:06,545 --> 00:27:08,711
You know what ?
Do whatever you want. Be a suck-up,

471
00:27:08,777 --> 00:27:11,742
contribute to me being grounded, yet
again, for the rest of high school,

472
00:27:11,855 --> 00:27:15,001
and then, maybe, when I come of
age, I will come down here legally

473
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:17,710
and personally
kick your ass.

474
00:27:20,777 --> 00:27:22,611
Ten in the corner.

475
00:27:36,937 --> 00:27:40,010
<i>Jessi seemed so focused,
driven,</i>

476
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,971
<i>and trying
to be like Sarah.</i>

477
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:43,961
<i>And I knew that
Sarah's pushing too hard</i>

478
00:27:44,015 --> 00:27:46,160
<i>is what got her into trouble.</i>

479
00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:49,181
- Jessi, we need to wait outside.
- I'm not going anywhere.

480
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:52,440
- Jessi...
- No. Not until I lose.

481
00:27:52,565 --> 00:27:56,102
<i>To get Jessi to leave, I needed
to beat her at her own game.</i>

482
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:58,241
Okay, then.

483
00:27:59,556 --> 00:28:01,190
Play against me.

484
00:28:04,145 --> 00:28:05,673
I rack them up.

485
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,141
<i>That means you're
solids, man.</i>

486
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:24,693
Don't worry.
He's got nothing on you.

487
00:28:33,856 --> 00:28:35,511
<i>Wow, he's really good.</i>

488
00:28:51,615 --> 00:28:54,183
<i>If he sinks this ball,
she's done.

489
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:12,841
<i>I didn't know what
she was trying to prove</i>

490
00:29:12,905 --> 00:29:15,151
<i>or how she could do
what I couldn't.</i>

491
00:29:18,647 --> 00:29:20,282
Hot professor alert.

492
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:22,653
I just saw him walking
across the quad.

493
00:29:22,718 --> 00:29:25,312
I have never seen a teacher
with shoulders like that.

494
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:29,673
I know. And those cute little laugh
wrinkles, I just wanna lick 'em.

495
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:34,741
I think that we need to take
a class in software design.

496
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:37,750
- I'm sure Stephen Trager
can teach me plenty.

497
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,153
Okay, that's it.

498
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:47,223
- Your dad's a total PILF.
- What's a PILF?

499
00:29:48,897 --> 00:29:52,463
- Professor I'd like to...
- Learn from.

500
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:55,012
I'm calling Declan.
We need to go.

501
00:29:55,056 --> 00:29:57,700
Why? We're safe. It's almost
7:00. The problem's gone.

502
00:29:57,768 --> 00:29:59,770
<i>Along with my innocence.</i>

503
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:01,602
Hey, yeah, we're ready.

504
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:03,683
And what about the deejay?

505
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,432
No prom music is worth
what I just had to hear.

506
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,040
Gross.

507
00:30:15,838 --> 00:30:17,730
Taking out the bad guys?

508
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:26,482
What, you wanna play?

509
00:30:29,315 --> 00:30:31,961
G- Force is your favorite game,
right? You're great at it.

510
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:33,440
Well...

511
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:36,253
Counseling is my game.
So here's the deal.

512
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:40,470
If I can score a point off you
in your game, you let me do mine.

513
00:30:42,276 --> 00:30:45,143
First of all,
it's not a point, it's a kill.

514
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:48,550
And I currently lead all level
45 shooters in on-line play.

515
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:51,252
I honestly have no idea
what you just said.

516
00:30:54,067 --> 00:30:55,583
Okay, you're in.

517
00:30:55,698 --> 00:30:57,302
The screen
on the left's yours.

518
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:05,480
By the way, I just showed Andy a
few of the old family photo albums.

519
00:31:06,728 --> 00:31:09,990
She really enjoyed
your third birthday photos.

520
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:12,560
<i>What? No, you didn't.</i>

521
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:15,132
Ah! I win!

522
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:16,391
No fair.

523
00:31:16,446 --> 00:31:18,432
Those pics should've
been burned years ago.

524
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:21,060
- I mean, I was naked, for God's sake.
- So?

525
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:24,071
It was a cold day
and a pool party, remember?

526
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,662
You told her I had
just left the pool, right?

527
00:31:25,836 --> 00:31:30,092
Josh, you were three. And she
thought those pictures were adorable.

528
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:31,780
She did?

529
00:31:31,988 --> 00:31:34,870
You know, Andy appreciates
that you're concerned about her.

530
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:40,031
She needs the fun loving, G-Force
playing, hilarious side of you, too.

531
00:31:42,325 --> 00:31:44,791
I guess I've been
pretty boring lately.

532
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:49,473
I mean, with all
the doctor stuff and studying.

533
00:31:49,597 --> 00:31:53,220
No, you're not gonna use this as
an excuse to get out of studying.

534
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:57,252
So, she really thinks
I'm all those things you said?

535
00:31:57,965 --> 00:31:59,651
She's not the only one.

536
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:08,263
<i>There's only the eight ball left.
If she gets that, she wins.

537
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:16,762
- Go for it.
- It's your turn.

538
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:20,632
I know.
I'm giving it to you.

539
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,853
<i>Somehow, she'd gotten
stronger, better.</i>

540
00:32:40,997 --> 00:32:42,673
<i>But at a cost.</i>

541
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:47,580
- You're bleeding.
- No. I'm fine. Try it again.

542
00:32:48,316 --> 00:32:49,081
We're leaving.

543
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:49,903
- No.
- Jessi.

544
00:32:49,977 --> 00:32:52,590
Hey. No means no, assface.

545
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,403
- I know what it means.
- Apparently you don't.

546
00:32:54,498 --> 00:32:57,393
- Jessi, we have to go now.
- She'll leave when she wants to.

547
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:02,380
Okay, if that's the way
it's gonna be.

548
00:33:03,956 --> 00:33:06,083
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- But I will.

549
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:17,492
- Get down!
- What the hell are you doing?

550
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:20,272
I'm saving you. Your brother Kyle's
crazy friend instigated a brawl.

551
00:33:20,328 --> 00:33:21,421
Wait. Kyle's here?

552
00:33:21,506 --> 00:33:23,163
I may not have busted you
to your dad,

553
00:33:23,198 --> 00:33:24,550
but there's no way I'm
letting you get hospitalized.

554
00:33:24,597 --> 00:33:25,811
You choose now
to be chivalrous.

555
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:28,563
- You caught me on a bad day.
- What are we doing in here anyway?

556
00:33:28,597 --> 00:33:30,303
Um, hiding in my booth.

557
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,282
I got that...
Your booth?

558
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:34,420
- That's what I said.
- You're DJ SpinBrandt?

559
00:33:34,455 --> 00:33:36,523
- And I don't do proms.
- Oh, my God!

560
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:38,883
I can't believe I got into
this whole mess over you!

561
00:33:45,015 --> 00:33:45,993
Are you okay?

562
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:54,940
Declan's facing off
against a supercute frat boy

563
00:33:55,007 --> 00:33:57,202
wearing a lovely
Marc Jacobs sweater.

564
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:05,853
What are you doing here?
Are you okay?

565
00:34:05,886 --> 00:34:07,221
You're so my hero right now.

566
00:34:07,305 --> 00:34:08,883
Come on. Let's go.

567
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:13,980
I'm Hillary and
I'm in a bar fight!

568
00:34:22,346 --> 00:34:24,051
I'm sorry about
what happened in there.

569
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,653
- What happened?
- Nothing. I cut myself on some glass.

570
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:28,473
- Jessi...
- Kyle, it's fine.

571
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:30,103
We'll find Stephen
and get you to a hospital.

572
00:34:30,147 --> 00:34:32,622
- No, I can fix it.
- You can't. And neither can I.

573
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:34,360
Adam could.

574
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,741
I bet with how smart
Sarah was, she could've, too.

575
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:43,471
Jessi, you shouldn't push
yourself. You don't know...

576
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,540
What don't I know?

577
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,680
<i>Jessi was able
to heal a wound.</i>

578
00:34:53,785 --> 00:34:55,093
<i>But keeping her safe and whole</i>

579
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:58,170
<i>would draw on my ability
to break through to her.</i>

580
00:34:58,905 --> 00:35:00,720
You don't know
how Sarah died.

581
00:35:01,288 --> 00:35:02,941
She claimed she could
move things with her mind,

582
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:04,573
run for hours and never get tired,

583
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:06,502
scale a building with her bare hands.

584
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:07,940
And then she died.

585
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:10,770
People said she went crazy.

586
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:13,320
- My mother wasn't crazy.
- Of course not.

587
00:35:13,406 --> 00:35:16,500
She was just like you. She was doing
all the same things that you're doing,

588
00:35:16,556 --> 00:35:18,900
pushing herself,
trying too much too fast.

589
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:21,661
And when she tried something she
wasn't ready for, it killed her.

590
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,361
I don't wanna see that
happen to you.

591
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:27,293
Kyle, I'm fine.

592
00:35:27,398 --> 00:35:28,561
Jessi...

593
00:35:36,197 --> 00:35:38,503
You can't keep
doing this to yourself.

594
00:35:39,488 --> 00:35:41,323
Promise me you'll stop.

595
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:44,743
I promise.

596
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:57,280
- You.
- That's right.

597
00:35:57,437 --> 00:36:00,210
The real you,
or the prickly version?

598
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:03,480
The ass-whoopin',
kung fu, butt-kickin' version.

599
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:06,631
- Seriously? You know kung fu?
- No.

600
00:36:06,808 --> 00:36:09,653
But one time, Kyle showed me
how to do a roundhouse.

601
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:11,510
Cool. Teach me?

602
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:12,760
Sure.

603
00:36:14,678 --> 00:36:16,880
So, is this the moment
that we're supposed to

604
00:36:16,935 --> 00:36:19,791
old school Hollywood it
into each other's arms?

605
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:23,162
'Cause I'm not running.

606
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:29,161
- Neither am I.
- Especially not into your arms.

607
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:32,542
Those things
are like chicken legs.

608
00:36:32,787 --> 00:36:34,163
You love my arms.

609
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,492
They are cute.

610
00:36:40,957 --> 00:36:43,051
I'm never getting rid
of you, am I?

611
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:44,170
Nope.

612
00:36:45,685 --> 00:36:46,823
Good.

613
00:36:55,426 --> 00:36:58,740
- And the cut was gone?
- Completely.

614
00:36:59,035 --> 00:37:01,111
I saw Jessi heal herself.

615
00:37:01,337 --> 00:37:03,863
She might very well
be more advanced than you.

616
00:37:04,147 --> 00:37:06,230
But she's so impulsive.

617
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:11,273
And that makes you
feel responsible for her.

618
00:37:13,306 --> 00:37:15,030
More than ever.

619
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:19,263
She needs me
to watch out for her.

620
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:24,123
Like Sarah needed me.

621
00:37:27,118 --> 00:37:28,942
She was falling apart,

622
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:34,420
and it was all... just
too much for me to handle.

623
00:37:35,707 --> 00:37:37,223
And I left.

624
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,951
That can't be true.

625
00:37:40,118 --> 00:37:43,493
It is true.
I failed her.

626
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:47,142
And I had no right to ask you
to be responsible for Jessi

627
00:37:47,796 --> 00:37:50,373
when I was incapable
of doing that myself.

628
00:37:50,508 --> 00:37:53,310
I just thought if you went
to the university,

629
00:37:53,395 --> 00:37:55,403
and you learned
what happened to Sarah...

630
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:57,770
That I'd make the choice
for myself.

631
00:38:01,335 --> 00:38:03,280
You're very brave, Kyle.

632
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:05,092
And I'm proud of you.

633
00:38:13,278 --> 00:38:15,242
I thought your mom
didn't allow nighttime meetings.

634
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:19,642
She doesn't. But she had a glass of wine
with dinner and passed out on the couch.

635
00:38:20,938 --> 00:38:23,040
Now I know what it feels like
to be Lois Lane.

636
00:38:23,105 --> 00:38:24,122
Lois who?

637
00:38:24,188 --> 00:38:26,723
You know,
Superman's girlfriend.

638
00:38:28,617 --> 00:38:31,290
She always wanted to be
the center of his universe,

639
00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:34,341
but, eventually, she realized being
with him meant having to share him.

640
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:36,221
And did she?

641
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:39,103
It was hard
for her at first.

642
00:38:39,298 --> 00:38:43,311
But then she realized that it
was his destiny to help people.

643
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:47,161
I just can't help but think,
though,

644
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,330
he was always so busy
protecting other people,

645
00:38:49,388 --> 00:38:51,531
there was never anyone
protecting him.

646
00:38:51,918 --> 00:38:54,001
Well, that's why
it's not real.

647
00:38:54,827 --> 00:38:57,561
Everyone needs someone
to protect them once in a while.

648
00:39:15,076 --> 00:39:18,042
<i>There's truth in the saying
that time heals all wounds.</i>

649
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:20,683
<i>Physically, the healing
begins in moments,</i>

650
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:23,032
<i>and our bodies
do all the work.</i>

651
00:39:24,455 --> 00:39:26,393
<i>But when a relationship
is injured,</i>

652
00:39:26,587 --> 00:39:28,671
<i>some wounds heal in a day,</i>

653
00:39:29,178 --> 00:39:32,011
<i>others lay bare
for the rest of our lives.</i>

654
00:39:32,568 --> 00:39:35,170
<i>Sometimes we only
have to heal ourselves.</i>

655
00:39:35,937 --> 00:39:37,161
What was that for?

656
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,660
For persuading me
away from couples therapy.

657
00:39:39,746 --> 00:39:42,651
Personally, I think you'd make a
killing as a marriage counselor.

658
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,481
What about you guys? Anything
eventful happen in your day?

659
00:39:45,996 --> 00:39:48,740
Hillary, Declan, Amanda and I
went to a bar

660
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:50,181
and got into a brawl.

661
00:39:50,226 --> 00:39:51,380
Yeah, right.

662
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:53,932
Next time, leave Amanda out
if you want to sell your story.

663
00:39:54,205 --> 00:39:55,882
All right.

664
00:39:57,115 --> 00:40:00,873
<i>And sometimes, our true work
lies in healing others.</i>

665
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:09,303
- Hi, Andy.
- Hey, Kyle.

666
00:40:09,718 --> 00:40:11,961
Josh told me
about your test tomorrow.

667
00:40:12,526 --> 00:40:15,582
Yeah.
Keep your fingers crossed.

668
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:20,050
- Why?
- It's good luck.

669
00:40:23,438 --> 00:40:26,682
- Can't hurt, right?
- Right.

670
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:31,812
I just wanna
get it over with.

671
