2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:06,773
I can't be with you when I know
I'm losing you to someone else.

3
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,091
- You could never lose me.
- I already have.

4
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:10,443
I'm Cassidy.

5
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:12,595
There is a foreign hottie
who seems into you.

6
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,270
- You're available.
- I guess.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,960
Guess? Is there a romantic
interest I'm not aware of?

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,601
- Only Kyle.
- Kyle?

9
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,062
I'm sorry, I really am, but it,

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,977
the sex, is done.

11
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:25,650
Why would you invite Lori Trager
here if you were meeting me?

12
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:28,027
- I see the problem.
- You told me not to see her.

13
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,612
I thought you'd be happy.

14
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,364
Watch out!

15
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:37,615
We've done all we can.

16
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:39,664
<i>Adam's substitute
for amniotic fluid.</i>

17
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:43,243
Think it could help Nicole? There is
one place you might be able to get some.

18
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,753
- My mother is dying.
- I have what you need.

19
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,707
- I can get it to you.
- Thank you.

20
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:50,383
But you have to do
something for me. Join us.

21
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,343
At Latnok.
It's your choice.

22
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,692
I pushed Kyle to go to Latnok today

23
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:56,847
because I knew it could save
Nicole's life.

24
00:00:57,279 --> 00:01:00,726
Now, if you ever harm him
or anyone else in that family,

25
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,852
I'll kill you.

26
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,187
She's gonna be OK.

27
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:05,981
Thank you.

28
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,103
How's Mrs. Trager?

29
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:34,990
She's okay.

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,124
Getting her strength back slowly.

31
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:39,886
- We're taking good care of her.
- That's great.

32
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:42,752
I was gonna come by.
I mean, I should have.

33
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,688
- But I was really busy at work.
- That's okay.

34
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:50,443
You don't have to avoid
The Rack, you know.

35
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,320
- Oh, I'm not avoiding it.
- Because, even though we're not...

36
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:57,221
It doesn't mean you
have to give up smoothies.

37
00:01:57,321 --> 00:01:59,243
I'd still make you one
if you wanted me to.

38
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,120
Amanda, I still like smoothies.

39
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,205
- You do?
- Of course.

40
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:07,229
- I've just been busy.
- Right.

41
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:08,693
Sure.

42
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:14,258
- How about lasagna?
- A lasagna smoothie?

43
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:16,552
I could make one and bring it by.

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,929
- Want to make lasagna for me?
- For the family.

45
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:21,599
Your mom probably doesn't
feel like cooking nowadays.

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,168
That'd be great.

47
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,528
- Well, I gotta...
- Me too.

48
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:32,889
Lasagna!

49
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,371
- What did she want?
- Were you listening?

50
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:43,746
No. I was watching.

51
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,290
She just wanted to say hello.

52
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,833
What's the point in dumping you
if she still wants to talk?

53
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,684
- She was being polite.
- She broke up with you

54
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:52,838
and hurt your feelings.
That's not very polite.

55
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,496
I'm getting over it.

56
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:56,926
I'm trying.

57
00:02:57,702 --> 00:02:59,553
Today should help
take your mind off it.

58
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:03,802
I don't want the family
to know I'm going to Latnok.

59
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:06,227
- I don't want to upset Nicole.
- Then don't go.

60
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,977
I've made a deal.
And I've seen what they're capable of.

61
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:11,148
If I don't go today,
it won't be the end of it.

62
00:03:13,477 --> 00:03:15,162
So you won't say anything?

63
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:18,368
I won't.

64
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:21,408
I'm glad I can count on you.

Saison 03 Episode 06
Welcome to Latnok

68
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,011
Forom.com & U-sub.net

69
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,674
I've waited a long time for this day.

70
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:49,012
Why are we at a university?

71
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:52,430
What did you expect,
to go to my underground lair?

72
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:55,104
It wouldn't surprise me.

73
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,318
Well, maybe this will.

74
00:03:57,418 --> 00:04:00,731
I know your previous impressions
of Latnok have been not so great,

75
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:03,082
but I'm determined to change all that.

76
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:07,414
I want you to see that we're not about

77
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,786
stuffy suits or mad scientists.

78
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:11,439
What are you about?

79
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:15,011
The future.

80
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:19,121
These are the best
and brightest minds on campus,

81
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:21,474
but none of them hold a candle to you.

82
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:24,046
What do they know about me?

83
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:27,533
I told them you're a genius.
A prodigy. A real find.

84
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:29,745
But that's all they know.

85
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:31,955
As far as they're concerned,

86
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,469
you're just my latest recruit.

87
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:36,644
The one I wanted most of all.

88
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:47,560
That sounds pretty.

89
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,015
Thanks. I'm writing a song for my mom.

90
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:51,891
Don't you want her to feel better?

91
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,557
Yeah, that's why I'm...

92
00:04:57,624 --> 00:04:59,886
Don't you have anything else
you could be doing, like

93
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:02,388
magically lighting
small animals on fire?

94
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:05,179
- Why would I do that?
- It's a joke.

95
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:07,283
Never mind.

96
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,905
I need a favor.

97
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,976
And you've teed it up
so successfully.

98
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,701
Please don't tell Kyle
anything about Cassidy.

99
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:19,319
Finally you've opened your eyes
up to the hotness next door.

100
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,070
So you won't tell him?

101
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,651
Why do you care if Kyle knows
you've been seeing Cassidy?

102
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:26,075
I just don't think he'd like it.

103
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,354
Whatever.

104
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,454
But my silence comes with a price.

105
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,540
The keys to your apartment.
Mark and I need privacy.

106
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,875
But it's mine.

107
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,431
And yet you want me
to keep your secret.

108
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:40,642
What a predicament.

109
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:42,894
I thought you were done
being mean to me.

110
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:45,377
This isn't mean.
This is sibling politics.

111
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,470
Kill or be killed.
Ask Josh.

112
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,352
So do we have a deal or what?

113
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:52,213
We have a deal.

114
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,819
<i>You look great.</i>

115
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:55,860
How do you feel?

116
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,883
I can finally go up
and down the stairs

117
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,597
without feeling like a Ginsu knife
is piercing me in the lungs,

118
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:01,963
so pretty good.

119
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:03,539
Scratch that.

120
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,733
- What's that?
- Hospital bill.

121
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:09,775
How much?

122
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:13,483
Too many pages...

123
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:16,094
Oh, my God.

124
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,679
- Is that before insurance?
- I wish.

125
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:24,118
Stephen, we don't have this kind
of money. What are we gonna do?

126
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,377
What are we gonna do about what?

127
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:27,986
Dinner.

128
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:30,372
You know what? I...
I don't feel like cooking.

129
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,895
Is she okay?

130
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,774
She'll be fine.
Don't worry about it.

131
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:05,424
- Is this sponsored by the university?
- The university gives us the space

132
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:08,052
in exchange for bragging rights
generated by our ideas.

133
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,772
What kind of ideas?

134
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:11,964
Advances in science, technology.

135
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:15,641
Working towards a better
more sophisticated civilization.

136
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:18,313
I don't have a great history
with people who say that.

137
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:20,294
Yeah, well, forget
about everybody else.

138
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:21,690
We're the real deal.

139
00:07:22,895 --> 00:07:26,070
And this lovely little pixie
is Jackie.

140
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,352
Who holds the record for

141
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:31,482
darts, Guitar Hero
and the longest keg stand.

142
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:35,079
Let me know if I can kick your ass
at any of them later, cutie.

143
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:39,208
- What's she working on?
- Nuclear suitcase bomb.

144
00:07:40,615 --> 00:07:42,604
Plants, mate.
Growth patterns.

145
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:44,922
My goal is to accelerate
the maturation period.

146
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:48,175
A system like hers could help
eradicate world hunger.

147
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,097
Have you considered binding
FT proteins to activate

148
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,261
the nucleus of the meristem cells?

149
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:57,221
No.

150
00:07:58,288 --> 00:07:59,474
No, I haven't.

151
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:03,482
So, the great mind has finally
come to play with us mortals.

152
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:06,670
Yeah, most people open with
"hello," but that will work.

153
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,779
Nathanial Harrison,
Kyle Trager.

154
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:10,781
- Hello.
- Hello.

155
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,290
And goodbye.
I've got work to do.

156
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,228
Why don't you tell Kyle here what
you're working on? Maybe he can help.

157
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:20,077
No offense, Boy Genius,

158
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:22,292
but I graduated high school at 13,

159
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,161
and I have an IQ of 156.

160
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:25,828
I think I got it.

161
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,926
Nate considers himself
top dog around here.

162
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,200
He thinks I'm an idiot because
I have the IQ of a normal person.

163
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,171
I don't take it personally.

164
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:37,759
I've got better hair.

165
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:40,756
So, make yourself at home.
Get to know everyone.

166
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:42,631
I believe you already know...

167
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,915
I'm glad we finally got you in here.

168
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:58,652
Easy there. You're hitting a little
too close to the Promised Land.

169
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:01,915
I love the never-ending
role reversal.

170
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,960
- The who?
- With us.

171
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,770
First it was you who didn't want to...

172
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,595
you know. Then...

173
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:10,135
it was me.

174
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:11,354
Now it's you.

175
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:12,934
Wait a minute.

176
00:09:13,588 --> 00:09:15,686
Were those little
twinkly finger maneuvers

177
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:18,324
is your way of telling me
that you've changed your mind?

178
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,018
I don't know. Would that
be such a bad thing?

179
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,854
Are you testing me?
Is this a test?

180
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:26,130
Josh, I'm not testing you.

181
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:30,800
I just missed you.

182
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,319
I missed you, too.

183
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,657
Really bad.

184
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,838
Josh, I need to...

185
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:58,889
- have an exorcism!
- Don't you knock?

186
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,351
- Don't you lock?
- It's okay. You can look.

187
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:06,220
I'm so, so, so sorry.

188
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,854
- But I need to talk to you.
- Now?

189
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:10,609
My cue to leave.

190
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:17,908
Did you get a <i>How to Screw Your Brother
Over</i> handbook the day I was born?

191
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,760
No, but you were lucky
it was me and not Mom!

192
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:23,643
Which is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

193
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:26,365
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah.

194
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:28,331
I caught a glimpse
of the hospital bill.

195
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:30,673
- They can't pay it.
- How do you know that?

196
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:33,340
They walked me through the finally
finances when they made their will.

197
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,795
- They have a will?
- Yes, idiot,

198
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:39,305
and now we have a problem. So,
where's our chief problem solver?

199
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,288
I've been involved for two years.

200
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:43,332
I know I didn't tell you or Lori.

201
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:45,518
I swear to you,
I met her totally by accident.

202
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:47,068
Lori needs to know.

203
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,321
Okay. You're right.
I'll tell her.

204
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:55,305
I know this is a bit overwhelming
for you, your first day and all,

205
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,890
but we're good people here.

206
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,973
And we have the best
resources available.

207
00:10:59,073 --> 00:11:01,311
It's all about
discovery and opportunity.

208
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,413
- Scientific and financial.
- Financial?

209
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,606
We're encouraged to chase
grants and enter competitions.

210
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:10,880
For myself, I cleared
more than 80,000 last year.

211
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:14,091
So,
have we won you over yet?

212
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:17,292
See you later.

213
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,751
I'm here to pay a debt,
keep my word.

214
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:23,208
Beyond that, I have no interest
in being part of this.

215
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,367
If you can't let go of
past impressions,

216
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:28,522
your time here is not going
to be productive. So go home.

217
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:31,615
Seriously, go home.

218
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:35,470
Sleep on it. If you're not back
tomorrow morning, then so be it.

219
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:36,907
Debt paid.

220
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:39,133
Deal?

221
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:42,401
Deal.

222
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:46,066
There has to be something we can do.

223
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,879
We were hoping you could
help us figure that out.

224
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,668
- Where's Jessi?
- Out.

225
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:54,006
We figured this was the one place
we could privately summit

226
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:55,630
without Mom and Dad stumbling in.

227
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,077
So, what's our strategy?
I make minimum wage,

228
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,446
and this slacker
over here doesn't work at all.

229
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:03,178
I could take my guitar
and play on a street corner.

230
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:05,443
You'd do better
without the guitar.

231
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:09,114
Okay, enough kidding around. We're
talking thousands of dollars here.

232
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:12,008
We're never gonna come up
with that kind of cash.

233
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:15,108
I have an idea.

234
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:21,128
<i>I had been released
from my debt to Cassidy,</i>

235
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:23,421
<i>but now a new debt had arrived.</i>

236
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:27,288
<i>What was the price I'd have to pay
for the situation I had created?</i>

237
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:29,707
<i>And, in the end,
would it be worth it?</i>

238
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:31,569
<i>I had no way of knowing.</i>

239
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:33,904
<i>But I also knew I had no choice.</i>

240
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:45,755
<i>Hello, this is Cassidy.
Please leave a message.</i>

241
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,903
Cassidy, it's Kyle.

242
00:12:48,655 --> 00:12:50,369
I'll be back tomorrow.

243
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,179
<i>Good morning.</i>

244
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,070
I need to know about all available
competitions with a cash prize.

245
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,322
Suddenly the entrepreneur, right?

246
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,433
No problem.

247
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:08,023
Mark can help you with that.

248
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:25,906
A hoverboard competition.

249
00:13:26,962 --> 00:13:29,533
- The deadline's...
- Thirty-six hours and 23 minutes.

250
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,810
Judged here on campus.
It's exactly what I need.

251
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,863
No, I think what you need is a breath.

252
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:35,480
I know how smart you are, but

253
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,260
even if you manage to construct the
prototype, but it's highly unlikely,

254
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,392
the real question is
whether it will work.

255
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:42,362
Nate's been jamming
on this for a year.

256
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,726
- He's still working the bugs out.
- I have to try.

257
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:45,817
I really...

258
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:48,497
If you could just show me
where I could work.

259
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:49,839
Yeah...

260
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,706
we'll set you up a station here.

261
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:01,788
So, head over heels
or a broken heart?

262
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,528
Most songs are about one or the other.

263
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:07,638
- How do you know I'm writing a song?
- I know you pretty well.

264
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,071
Yes, you do.

265
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:12,517
I'm hoping if I write
enough songs, I can sell one of them.

266
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,730
So, which one is it?

267
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:19,262
She's gonna make me say it.

268
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:21,840
How's that guy, Mark?

269
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,778
That guy, Mark, is...

270
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,740
good.

271
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:28,006
Good.

272
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,368
And you are...?

273
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,703
- Good.
- Good.

274
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:36,833
I guess I'll see you around.

275
00:14:42,624 --> 00:14:45,176
Sounds like a whole lot of
goodness going on around here.

276
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:47,955
I'm hoping we can move past
the awkward stage.

277
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,123
One minute you're telling
each other everything, and

278
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,791
the next you don't know what to say.

279
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,770
Exactly.

280
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:58,269
Just because you break up
with a guy doesn't mean you stop

281
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:00,573
- having feelings for him.
- I know.

282
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:03,125
I don't want to, but sometimes
I still do. I just...

283
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:05,485
I can't get past the whole Jessi thing.

284
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:08,031
Kyle does not have
feelings for Jessi.

285
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,859
Trust me,
I would kill him.

286
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,161
She's after him. Jessi's the kind
of girl who gets what she wants.

287
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:17,332
Jessi likes someone else now.

288
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:19,078
She does?

289
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,548
She's over Kyle.
So...

290
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:23,711
maybe, you don't have to be.

291
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:28,594
<i>Jessi's got a sweet secret pad.</i>

292
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:33,937
What's all this?

293
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:36,422
Everything I can afford to part with
and not walk around naked.

294
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:37,627
And why is it here?

295
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,633
Cause if I'm gonna sell
everything I own online,

296
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,923
I don't want my parents to know.
That's where you come in.

297
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,426
Not remotely following.

298
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,995
You'll be my boxer-shipper.

299
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:47,821
I thought you brought me here
for more exciting purposes.

300
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,967
That can be the reward
for a job well done.

301
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:53,869
How did you get the keys
to this place, anyway?

302
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,683
Lori blackmailed them out of Jessi,
I blackmailed 'em out of Lori.

303
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,656
- What do you have on Lori?
- Nothing. I just inferred things.

304
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:02,044
She's a guilty person.

305
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,151
You're so cute
when you're being diabolical.

306
00:16:05,494 --> 00:16:07,613
I just really want to help my mom.

307
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:08,840
I know you do.

308
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,602
And I'm happy to help.

309
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:12,911
But

310
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:15,766
maybe we can get
to the reward part first?

311
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:19,203
Someone's in a rush
to get to the good stuff.

312
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,273
Here we are,

313
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,941
alone in our secret little apartment.

314
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,027
No fears of getting caught.

315
00:16:27,514 --> 00:16:31,073
Do you have any idea how many couples
would kill for a deal like this?

316
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:34,996
Or how much they'd pay for it.

317
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:37,954
You're a genius!

318
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,746
Apparently, now I'm also a pimp.

319
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,642
You really think you can build a
working prototype in less than 2 days?

320
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:02,882
Seems like maybe you're not
as smart as they think you are.

321
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:06,037
- Maybe so.
- This isn't like playing with Legos.

322
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:08,183
There's no way you can finish.

323
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,324
Your board is burning.

324
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,759
- What was that for?
- My tomato plants

325
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,399
doubled their growth in 12 hours.

326
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,756
- That's amazing.
- Thanks to you.

327
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:28,252
- You're so nice.
- Well, why wouldn't I be?

328
00:17:37,946 --> 00:17:39,664
How are you feeling?

329
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:42,097
- Much better.
- Good, because I have some news.

330
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:44,396
I made a decision.
I've been thinking about it.

331
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,693
- I'm not gonna go to college.
- What?

332
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:49,135
It doesn't make sense for me
to spend 4 years in school

333
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,008
when all I care about is my music.

334
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:53,104
Plus, it's so expensive.

335
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,783
You know I love you and
I try to respect your life choices,

336
00:17:56,883 --> 00:17:58,623
but this is a non-starter for me.

337
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:00,844
- But...
- Please don't make me play the mom

338
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:03,498
who just got out of the hospital
and has a weak heart card.

339
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:08,462
Okay. You need
time to process.

340
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,006
There's not enough time
in the world for this one.

341
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:13,341
- Let me get that.
- I've got it.

342
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:15,803
I've got it.

343
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:17,231
All right.

344
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:18,707
Suit yourself.

345
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:25,516
- Let me get it.
- I've got... I've got it.

346
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:27,075
You're not supposed to get it.

347
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:27,977
Why not?

348
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:31,535
Because we're supposed to treat you
delicately until you feel better.

349
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:33,062
Who told you that?

350
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,884
Since when do you listen to Lori?

351
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:37,980
I guess you're right.

352
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:42,287
Okay, so,
where are you coming from?

353
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:46,625
- I was out.
- Just wandering the streets aimlessly?

354
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:48,408
Why would I do that?

355
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,089
No, I meant you could
tell me more if you want to.

356
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:53,807
No, I can't.

357
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:55,217
Why not?

358
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,198
Because I'm not supposed to upset you.

359
00:18:57,298 --> 00:18:58,298
Lori again?

360
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:02,023
What does he think
would upset me?

361
00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:04,905
I really shouldn't be
talking to you about this.

362
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:07,483
I think you should.

363
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,920
I think I did something really bad.

364
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,986
And I don't want Kyle to know, but
I'm worried that what I did might affect

365
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,718
what he's doing, and then
he won't realize what's being done.

366
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:19,366
What happened?

367
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:23,726
Tell me.

368
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:27,114
<i>I can't believe
you're working with them.</i>

369
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:30,107
It was the only way to get you
help when you were so sick.

370
00:19:30,207 --> 00:19:33,533
- I had to make the deal.
- Now you need to unmake it.

371
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:35,173
I'm serious, Kyle.

372
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,759
I don't want you involved
with those people.

373
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:40,427
- It's not as bad as you think.
- Not as bad?

374
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:44,015
They followed you, they toyed with you,
they kidnapped Amanda!

375
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,480
- So far there's been nothing...
- No, don't do that.

376
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,485
Don't tell me anything other than that
your relationship with them is over.

377
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:53,109
It can't be over.

378
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:54,651
I'm sorry.

379
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:02,071
How could you tell her?

380
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:04,813
I was worried. I don't like that
you're involved with them.

381
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,579
I don't like that I'm involved
with them! But I have to be.

382
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,406
Why?

383
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:10,234
Why can't you just walk away?

384
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:14,135
I had the chance, but Stephen and Nicole
ran into money trouble, so now I can't.

385
00:20:14,235 --> 00:20:15,371
Money trouble?

386
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,879
Yes.

387
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,698
The hospital bill
is really high.

388
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:23,568
I didn't know that.

389
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:26,273
I have to help them,
no matter what it takes.

390
00:20:26,373 --> 00:20:29,060
Why are you always helping people,
even if it's hurting you?

391
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,326
Because that's what you do, Jessi.

392
00:20:31,426 --> 00:20:33,982
- That's what people do.
- But Cassidy's a bad person.

393
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:35,382
I don't trust him.

394
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:37,642
What do you know about Cassidy?

395
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:44,882
What do you know about Cassidy?

396
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:51,489
I met him awhile ago.

397
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,823
He didn't tell me he was
part of Latnok, at first.

398
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:57,425
- What did he tell you?
- I thought he was my neighbor.

399
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:59,782
He lived down the hall
from Sarah's apartment,

400
00:20:59,882 --> 00:21:02,292
probably as a way
of keeping tabs on me.

401
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,297
He told me that Latnok
is changing and that

402
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,989
you and I can help with that change.

403
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,755
- And you believed him?
- I didn't know what to believe.

404
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:10,820
Sarah hated them,
but then she left.

405
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,163
He was there,
being so kind and supportive

406
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:15,675
and telling me how important
we both were to the future.

407
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,749
When Nicole got injured
and she needed help...

408
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:20,285
- You suggested I go see him.
- You would have gone anyway.

409
00:21:20,385 --> 00:21:22,875
But you encouraged me without
telling me the whole story!

410
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:24,981
You did exactly what Cassidy wanted!

411
00:21:26,781 --> 00:21:27,651
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:28,157 --> 00:21:31,222
I'm working with the people
I trust least in this world.

413
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:33,740
I never thought
you'd be just like them.

414
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:41,270
<i>Hello?</i>

415
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,166
<i>An appointment for what?</i>

416
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:45,545
What apartment?

417
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:46,890
Hello?

418
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:50,631
That was one of Josh's friends,
canceling a 10:30 appointment.

419
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:51,891
What appointment?

420
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:54,678
He hung up. Said something
about an apartment.

421
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:58,240
What do you know about this?

422
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:00,441
Nothing. Not a thing.

423
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:03,318
Zero.

424
00:22:04,753 --> 00:22:06,293
You want to try that again?

425
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,416
<i>Four-ninety-eight,</i>
four-ninety-nine,

426
00:22:08,516 --> 00:22:10,279
five hundred. Not bad.

427
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:12,761
Except for the fact I've had to
clean this place five times

428
00:22:12,861 --> 00:22:14,140
in the past 24 hours.

429
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,095
- We could hire a maid.
- No, that'd cut into our profits.

430
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,370
The last party
left the bathroom looking like

431
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:22,190
a chunk-style soup factory exploded.

432
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,292
I've still got to scrub
the toilet before the 10:30.

433
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:27,520
10:46.

434
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:30,647
- Maybe they're not coming.
- Well, they'd better come!

435
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:34,486
One appointment is 50$ less stress
my mom has to worry about.

436
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:36,392
Amen.

437
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:39,735
I'll get the door,
you manage the facilities.

438
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:48,345
Don't think you guys'll
get out of paying full price.

439
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:51,011
What, exactly,
are we paying full price for?

440
00:22:51,695 --> 00:22:53,263
Dad!
Mom!

441
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:56,945
Great to see you!

442
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,967
- Andy.
- Leaving. Now.

443
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:01,971
I'm late for my family summit, which

444
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:04,165
hopefully goes better
than this is about to.

445
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,918
- What is going on here?
- A little entrepreneurial venture.

446
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:13,008
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- You mean before right now?

447
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:14,971
Why would you need money?

448
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,272
Andy's birthday.

449
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:19,590
- She's expecting diamonds.
- Well, then start mining.

450
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,554
Cause you're gonna give
all this money back,

451
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:23,901
and you're gonna clear
out of here immediately.

452
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:26,229
- I just wanted to...
- Just wanted to what?

453
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:29,281
Tell us, please, because
we really want to understand.

454
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,079
Nothing.

455
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:33,365
I'm sorry.

456
00:23:34,153 --> 00:23:35,027
I suck.

457
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:39,097
Am I on too many painkillers,

458
00:23:39,197 --> 00:23:41,910
or is there something seriously
wrong with our children?

459
00:23:42,451 --> 00:23:44,284
Don't you ever sleep?

460
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:46,863
This has to be done.

461
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,134
You know, I know you're only
into it for the prize money now, but,

462
00:23:53,312 --> 00:23:55,641
Kyle, I really think
you're gonna like it here.

463
00:23:56,748 --> 00:23:58,657
- Why?
- Well...

464
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,105
I know, for me,

465
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:03,998
it is the first time
I can remember, I'm in a place

466
00:24:04,098 --> 00:24:06,861
where I'm not this super-smart
outsider. We all are.

467
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:09,749
It's my home.

468
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,950
I guess I have a different
definition of home.

469
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:20,386
Speaking of,
I haven't talked to Lori yet.

470
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:23,013
Do you have any tips

471
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:25,099
on how to keep her from hating me?

472
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:29,550
You're asking the wrong person about
keeping secrets from his girlfriend.

473
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,149
- Doogie Howser's got a girlfriend?
- Not anymore.

474
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:37,253
- Is she hot?
- Amanda's a nice girl, Nate.

475
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:39,571
In other words,
totally off-limits to you.

476
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:40,596
Amanda?

477
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:44,011
- That's a pretty name.
- Leave her out of this.

478
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,723
What's this? You're not satisfied
with moving into my project?

479
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:56,285
You've got to steal
my materials now, too?

480
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,347
- I didn't steal them.
- Cassidy told him

481
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:00,665
- he could use our supplies.
- Was I talking to you?

482
00:25:03,094 --> 00:25:05,309
Look, you can't just
waltz in here and take over.

483
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:07,880
- I don't want to take over anything.
- Who are you, anyway?

484
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,508
Where'd you come from
and where'd you learn to make that?

485
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,597
- I'm self-taught.
- That's impossible.

486
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:15,179
Is this kindergarten?
We share. We help each other.

487
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,096
Well, I'm not helping him.

488
00:25:35,762 --> 00:25:37,034
Kyle isn't here.

489
00:25:37,427 --> 00:25:38,974
I'm not here to see Kyle.

490
00:25:39,182 --> 00:25:41,205
I made a lasagna.
To help out.

491
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,999
Okay. I'll take it.

492
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:48,212
- I told you, Kyle isn't here.
- And I said I'm not here to see him.

493
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,561
Is that why your eyes are
darting all over for him?

494
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:53,245
Why do you even care?
You already have a new boyfriend.

495
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:55,136
I don't have a boyfriend.

496
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:57,722
That's what Lori said.

497
00:25:58,702 --> 00:26:00,896
Here. Just take
the stupid lasagna.

498
00:26:09,546 --> 00:26:13,242
I heard about the Nate thing.
Sorry about that. Ignore him.

499
00:26:13,342 --> 00:26:16,699
Should I ignore that you were conspiring
with Jessi to get me in here?

500
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,249
She told you about that, huh?

501
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:21,969
- Good.
- Good?

502
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:24,290
We've liked the idea
of her here for awhile,

503
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,066
but so far she hasn't proved
to be a very trustworthy girl.

504
00:26:27,273 --> 00:26:29,345
I'm glad to hear that
she's honest with you.

505
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,297
Maybe there is room
for both of you here.

506
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,664
I don't want Jessi
to have any part of this.

507
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:36,114
Not after everything
you've done to her. And to me.

508
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:38,875
You have to understand,
they wanted you here desperately.

509
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:41,432
- Who?
- The old guard, stuffy suits.

510
00:26:41,758 --> 00:26:43,917
They put enormous pressure
on me to bring you in.

511
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:46,294
They wanted their
greatest achievement on their side.

512
00:26:46,394 --> 00:26:48,619
You still haven't even
told me for what.

513
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:50,039
Do you not see?

514
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,693
That's for you to determine.

515
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,676
Inspire them.

516
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:57,472
Be inspired.

517
00:26:57,845 --> 00:27:00,493
Shape the future. With you
on board there are no limits.

518
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:02,756
But I'm not on board.

519
00:27:03,223 --> 00:27:05,008
I'm only here to help my family.

520
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:07,875
What can I do to convince you?

521
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,960
How can we earn your trust?

522
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:13,937
You can't.

523
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:18,712
What happened?

524
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,523
Nate.

525
00:27:22,478 --> 00:27:23,391
Bye-bye.

526
00:27:25,322 --> 00:27:26,298
Jerk.

527
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,495
You don't even know
what you just did.

528
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:31,440
I probably don't care, either.

529
00:27:31,723 --> 00:27:34,703
Nate, for God's sake,
man, shut it.

530
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,492
- Kyle, we can fix this.
- I don't want you to fix it.

531
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:41,993
You all talk about being family,
taking care of your own.

532
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,828
Well, I'm going
to take care of mine.

533
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,070
Kyle, wait.

534
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:46,394
Don't.

535
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,524
Aren't those Dad's old speakers?

536
00:28:00,742 --> 00:28:01,607
Yes.

537
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:04,036
I need the magnets
to make the board levitate.

538
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:05,662
He's gonna kill you, you know.

539
00:28:05,762 --> 00:28:08,122
I tried yours first,
but they weren't big enough.

540
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:10,313
That's...
You what?

541
00:28:11,716 --> 00:28:13,294
Oh, bro!

542
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,883
We've got to talk about the
concept of personal property.

543
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:20,114
I thought Latnok had
unlimited resources.

544
00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:24,052
- I had a setback with them.
- The competition's tomorrow. And

545
00:28:24,152 --> 00:28:26,783
- you don't have the right materials.
- I know that.

546
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:29,969
Why don't you just
levitate with the board?

547
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,021
'Cause that would be cheating.

548
00:28:34,191 --> 00:28:37,399
One day we'll discuss this
sporadic morals thing you've got going.

549
00:28:40,357 --> 00:28:44,291
I'll have the test scores in by
tomorrow. Yeah, thanks, you too.

550
00:28:44,795 --> 00:28:47,810
So do I want to know why half the
kitchen appliances are on the driveway?

551
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,019
- Science project.
- For what?

552
00:28:50,474 --> 00:28:52,362
For fun. You know Kyle.

553
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:55,870
Loves to have fun with science.
Good times.

554
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:59,005
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, Mom.

555
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,330
Child number one is acting
deceptively vague again.

556
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,115
What is up with them?

557
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:07,078
Oh, child number four
makes an appearance.

558
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:09,794
Sarah's been sending me
these for expenses.

559
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:14,460
Jessi, this is a lot of money.

560
00:29:15,332 --> 00:29:17,433
We need to open up
a bank account for you.

561
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:20,299
Actually, I wanted
to give it to you guys.

562
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,085
No, this is for you.

563
00:29:22,185 --> 00:29:24,136
This is her way
of taking care of you.

564
00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:28,391
But she doesn't. You do.
I should pay rent.

565
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,348
You're living here
as part of our family.

566
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:32,687
None of the other kids pay rent,
so why should you?

567
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:35,248
Why's everybody so concerned
about money lately?

568
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:38,609
Oh, no.

569
00:29:39,646 --> 00:29:40,948
- What?
- The bill.

570
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:42,833
You all know about the bill.

571
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:48,954
Okay, what's going on?

572
00:29:49,411 --> 00:29:51,288
I know you know
about the hospital bill.

573
00:29:55,776 --> 00:29:58,671
I'm trying to win a science competition
so I can pay your hospital bill.

574
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,716
That's why I went to Latnok. If I win it
I can make the money you owe.

575
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:03,755
How am I supposed to feel,

576
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:06,303
knowing this is the price you're
paying for saving my life?

577
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:08,480
I am the adult here.

578
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,976
It is my job. It is my responsibility
to take care of all of you.

579
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,574
But it's my fault.

580
00:30:15,235 --> 00:30:18,539
I was driving, and
I wasn't paying attention.

581
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:21,981
I was thinking about Adam's death,
and what Foss said that night,

582
00:30:22,757 --> 00:30:24,656
and I made the wrong turn.

583
00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:28,104
I wasn't focused, and that's
when we ran off the road.

584
00:30:29,817 --> 00:30:32,496
Is that what you think?
That you're responsible for this?

585
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,374
Yes.
Because it's true.

586
00:30:39,592 --> 00:30:42,564
So I'm finishing this project,
I'm winning this competition tomorrow,

587
00:30:42,664 --> 00:30:45,031
and I'm fixing
this problem that I caused.

588
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,804
And I'm sorry if you're
not okay with it, but,

589
00:30:49,136 --> 00:30:50,756
I won't let you stop me.

590
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:53,491
I won't stop you.

591
00:30:54,238 --> 00:30:56,312
I just don't think
it had to be this way.

592
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:10,097
So I hear you're solving
the world's problems.

593
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,204
I know Nicole's upset,
but I'm doing this.

594
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:17,583
Actually, I was just wondering
if there's anything I can do to help.

595
00:32:07,863 --> 00:32:09,426
Where do you need me?

596
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:23,566
Okay. Here we go.

597
00:32:34,012 --> 00:32:35,244
Dude, you're floating.

598
00:32:38,963 --> 00:32:40,718
Steady, steady.

599
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:44,476
- How's it look?
- Good.

600
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,321
Magnets are running a little hot,
but they're OK.

601
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,633
We need to prime the fields.

602
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:52,781
- Kyle, you're flying.
- Okay, let me go.

603
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:54,203
What? You sure?

604
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,482
- Looking good, Tragers.
- Steady, steady.

605
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,532
I can't compensate!

606
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:18,965
Stephen, shut it down.

607
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:26,754
Are you okay?

608
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:33,802
- I'm fine.
- The board isn't.

609
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,885
- We can fix it.
- Is there time?

610
00:33:35,985 --> 00:33:38,231
It's not about time.
It's the magnets.

611
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:41,542
They're not pure enough. I was hoping
we could mimic their chemical makeup,

612
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:43,660
- but we couldn't.
- Industrial magnets cost

613
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,981
thousands of dollars.
They're not easy to come by.

614
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,687
- I know where we could get some.
- No. You're not asking them

615
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:51,293
for anything anymore. I don't care
what the consequences are.

616
00:33:51,393 --> 00:33:53,815
- But we...
- Kyle, please.

617
00:33:56,097 --> 00:33:57,159
Then it's over.

618
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:00,371
We're done.

619
00:34:14,323 --> 00:34:16,618
Jessi, I don't really
feel like talking.

620
00:34:17,762 --> 00:34:19,236
I don't need to talk.

621
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:22,476
I just want you to have this.

622
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:28,260
- Did you get this from Cassidy?
- No.

623
00:34:28,698 --> 00:34:30,695
I cashed the checks
that Sarah sent me.

624
00:34:30,795 --> 00:34:32,592
Then I tracked down
an online supplier

625
00:34:32,692 --> 00:34:34,847
who sold me the magnets
for half the market value.

626
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,427
- Do you think it will work?
- I don't know.

627
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:39,842
But at least now we have a chance.

628
00:34:42,478 --> 00:34:44,623
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

629
00:34:57,856 --> 00:35:00,422
No, we've got it.
We've got pens for everyone.

630
00:35:00,522 --> 00:35:01,965
I'll start final assembly.

631
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,470
- Well, you good?
- Yeah.

632
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:17,114
Praying won't help you now, newbie.

633
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:21,326
Look, I don't quite know
how it went down, but

634
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,935
we can assume that whatever
happened, Nate was out of line.

635
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:25,581
We've all been there.

636
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,084
So where do you need us?

637
00:35:31,584 --> 00:35:34,339
Look, he's all confused.
We're here to help you.

638
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:39,986
- I'd like that.
- Cool.

639
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,268
This is the main frame.
I'm gonna need those, too.

640
00:35:50,173 --> 00:35:52,656
<i>Now, taking the stage,
our final two contestants,</i>

641
00:35:52,756 --> 00:35:54,803
<i>Kyle Trager and Nate Harrison.</i>

642
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,498
<i>The current leader had
an elevation level of five feet,</i>

643
00:35:57,598 --> 00:36:01,402
<i> six and one half inches,
22.4 second duration.</i>

644
00:36:01,502 --> 00:36:05,208
<i>Followed closely by five feet,
three inches and 19 seconds.</i>

645
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,037
You're just the girl
I need to talk to.

646
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:13,294
- What are you doing here?
- It's a long story

647
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:16,683
that ends with me telling you that
I've liked you since the minute we met.

648
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:19,890
Which doesn't excuse the fact that
I didn't tell you this before now.

649
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,468
- I know.
- Tell me what?

650
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:26,086
The Latnok organization?
The one Kyle's working with?

651
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:27,267
I'm a part of it.

652
00:36:29,052 --> 00:36:31,114
You're... what?

653
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:36,475
Don't. I can't deal
with this right now.

654
00:36:36,575 --> 00:36:38,214
We'll talk about it later.

655
00:36:44,224 --> 00:36:47,317
You know, when you paint a loser gold,
you still know what's inside.

656
00:36:48,462 --> 00:36:49,854
I'm just saying.

657
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,418
All right. Begin.

658
00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:12,368
I hope that thing doesn't explode.

659
00:37:12,468 --> 00:37:15,728
"Experimental" and "prototype"
are just synonyms for "kaboom."

660
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:44,469
Cream always rises to the top.

661
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,470
<i>We have a 50,000 dollar
grand prize winner.</i>

662
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,796
Round one goes to you.

663
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,262
- There doesn't have to be a round two.
- Don't be so sure about that.

664
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,538
- That was amazing.
- Great job.

665
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:38,898
Kyle, that was so awesome.

666
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,617
Dude.

667
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:49,019
Congratulations, Kyle.

668
00:38:51,256 --> 00:38:54,665
<i>Everything has a price.
I had paid mine, certain of the outcome.</i>

669
00:38:55,149 --> 00:38:58,827
<i>And yet, here I was, wondering if,
possibly, I had been wrong.</i>

670
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:05,347
Why are you in such a good mood?

671
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:08,573
Cleaning up other people's
trash is punishment.

672
00:39:08,823 --> 00:39:09,957
Two reasons.

673
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,452
One, Kyle saved the day and we're not
on the verge of bankruptcy anymore.

674
00:39:15,468 --> 00:39:18,814
I thought we'd have to sell the house
and move, which would've sucked.

675
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:20,994
And two,

676
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,403
after we're done cleaning,
we have the apartment all to ourselves.

677
00:39:25,992 --> 00:39:27,698
A swing and a miss.

678
00:39:28,456 --> 00:39:30,575
Josh, we need to talk.

679
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:32,536
No. Role reversal again?

680
00:39:33,386 --> 00:39:34,445
I wish.

681
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:38,333
I have some really bad news.

682
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,253
Hey, what's the matter?

683
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:47,469
You're not sick again, are you?

684
00:39:47,815 --> 00:39:50,691
Please tell me you're not, 'cause
I know you rely on me to be strong,

685
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,879
and I don't know
if I can handle that.

686
00:39:52,979 --> 00:39:54,515
It's not the cancer.

687
00:39:56,195 --> 00:39:57,185
It's worse.

688
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:00,439
What could be worse than that?

689
00:40:01,384 --> 00:40:02,298
Cleveland.

690
00:40:02,807 --> 00:40:03,650
Excuse me?

691
00:40:06,064 --> 00:40:07,663
You may not be moving,

692
00:40:09,202 --> 00:40:10,208
but I am.

693
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,369
My mom got a job
she couldn't pass up.

694
00:40:16,685 --> 00:40:18,726
We move at the end of the month.

695
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,334
You can't move.

696
00:40:22,932 --> 00:40:24,386
What about us?

697
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:42,200
We're closed.

698
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,119
I'm the kind of guy
who can't take no for an answer.

699
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:48,643
Except I'm tired
and I really want to go home.

700
00:40:48,743 --> 00:40:49,988
You don't look tired.

701
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:52,449
But I'll get out of your hair.

702
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:57,438
Slink sadly home to ponder the sad
state of life without a caffeine buzz.

703
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,039
The pity strategy. Nice.

704
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:04,795
This is for telling me
I don't look tired.

705
00:41:10,087 --> 00:41:11,301
You're saving my life.

706
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,870
I'm Nate.

707
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:16,319
- Amanda.
- Amanda.

708
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,601
That's a pretty name.

709
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:25,414
Come in.

710
00:41:33,914 --> 00:41:35,018
Did you win?

711
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,621
Are you still mad?

712
00:41:42,473 --> 00:41:43,838
I don't want to be.

713
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:47,740
Help me understand.

714
00:41:48,276 --> 00:41:50,549
You knew better,
yet you did it anyway.

715
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,476
I never wanted to hurt you.

716
00:41:53,494 --> 00:41:55,971
You're the most important person
to me in the world.

717
00:41:57,171 --> 00:41:58,014
I just...

718
00:41:58,556 --> 00:42:01,718
I wanted to be accepted by them,
and I let him manipulate me.

719
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,080
Why would you want to be
involved with them at all?

720
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,279
Because it...

721
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:07,928
would have been something
that you and I shared.

722
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:11,069
- Jessi, we share a lot of things.
- Not enough.

723
00:42:13,943 --> 00:42:15,350
I wanted more.

724
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:19,771
I need to trust that you'll
always be honest with me.

725
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,957
Otherwise, we won't
share anything.

726
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,318
In that case...

727
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,964
I guess you should know
Amanda came by.

728
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:32,946
She did?

729
00:42:34,173 --> 00:42:36,204
- When?
- The other day.

730
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:37,917
Why didn't you tell me?

731
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,182
'Cause I think that
she still likes you.

732
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,952
What does that have to...

733
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:45,729
Wait, she does?

734
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:51,193
What does that have to do
with you not telling me?

735
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:55,749
What is it?

736
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,202
Why didn't you
tell me about Amanda?

737
00:43:03,283 --> 00:43:05,373
Because I don't want you
to be with her.

738
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:09,881
I want you to be with me.
