00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
<i>Previously on</i> Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,437
Why are you acting so weird?

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,820
Nicole says it's because I like you.

4
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:10,110
- Don't you like me?
- Yeah, I do.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,204
My dad was notorious
for breaking promises.

6
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:13,736
Don't wanna be that kind of father.

7
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:15,758
You're not; you're a great father.

8
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:17,042
My sister Jessi,

9
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:18,731
she's been having some problems.

10
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:20,622
We hope you might sit down with her.

11
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:22,382
It's a really pretty necklace.

12
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:25,067
Thanks. It's a remnant
from my Declan days.

13
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:29,826
- Jessi, we're leaving.
- You can't tell me what to do!

14
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:35,080
Foss!

15
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:41,091
- I want to tell you everything.
- I'm ready to hear it.

16
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,465
Foss did this?

17
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:03,153
<i>Life is full of regrets.</i>

18
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:05,716
<i>But no matter how hard you try,</i>

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,722
<i>you can't change the past.</i>

20
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:11,061
<i>Lori had been attacked.</i>

21
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:13,399
<i>No one was sure who did it or why.</i>

22
00:01:13,814 --> 00:01:17,987
<i>And all I could focus on was how
I wasn't able to stop it from happening.</i>

23
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,937
Hey.

24
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:27,420
Dad, you have to stop doing this.

25
00:01:28,786 --> 00:01:31,596
And you, do I speak
with a British accent?

26
00:01:32,185 --> 00:01:33,191
No.

27
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:36,071
- Am I wearing a crown?
- No.

28
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:40,317
Then stop guarding my door
like I'm Queen freakin' Elizabeth.

29
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:42,410
Sorry.

30
00:01:46,768 --> 00:01:48,173
He's just worried about you.

31
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:49,464
I gathered.

32
00:01:49,996 --> 00:01:53,224
Sweetie, I know you're just
trying to be strong, but

33
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:56,499
what happened, it's a lot to deal with.

34
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:58,995
What happened is I became one
with my inner liberal

35
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:00,643
and got hate-crimed for it.

36
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:03,624
As far as I'm concerned,
this is my badge of honor.

37
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:05,133
How's she doing today?

38
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:06,700
Apparently, better than I am.

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,791
- When I look at her it breaks my heart.
- I feel the same way,

40
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:13,216
but we have to keep it together,
and make her feel safe and comfortable.

41
00:02:13,336 --> 00:02:16,114
How about whipping up
some sympathy pancakes?

42
00:02:16,627 --> 00:02:19,133
What? She likes them
and I'm in the mood.

43
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,458
I'll be right down.

44
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,631
Me first.

45
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:28,099
All yours.

46
00:02:31,612 --> 00:02:33,428
I hope that's the police
with news for Lori.

47
00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:35,870
I already spoke to them.
Still no leads or eye witnesses.

48
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,362
And since Lori can't identify her
attacker, then they're at a dead end.

49
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:40,932
A Dr. Keel is on the phone.

50
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:42,469
Dr. Keel?

51
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,547
She's calling from the hospital
about a patient:

52
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,087
a William Trager.

53
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,650
Who is he?

54
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,729
He's my father.

55
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:53,115
Hello.

56
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,990
Yeah, this is his son.

57
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:58,415
I didn't know Stephen's father
lived in town.

58
00:02:58,585 --> 00:03:00,104
How long has he been sick?

59
00:03:00,237 --> 00:03:02,259
I don't know.
They haven't spoken in years.

60
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:05,495
It's complicated.

61
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:09,899
He had a stroke last night.

62
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,716
Looks like he's not going to make it.

63
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:14,202
I'm so sorry, Stephen.

64
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:17,408
Is there anything I can do to help?

65
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:20,878
No, there's nothing to do. I said
good-bye to my father years ago.

66
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:27,785
Are things really that bad between them?

67
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:31,572
I always hoped they'd manage
to repair things, but

68
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:33,579
doesn't look like
that's going to happen.

69
00:03:34,686 --> 00:03:37,292
<i>Adam Baylin said
I would touch the world,</i>

70
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:39,731
but what good is having a gift
if I couldn't help

71
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,785
the people I loved the most?

72
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:46,100

Season 2 Episode 8
- What's The Frequency, Kyle? -

75
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,275
You didn't have to come.

76
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,388
I know you told everyone not to,

77
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:04,732
but I want to meet your father.

78
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:08,559
He's in coma, you know?
He can't communicate.

79
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:09,882
I understand.

80
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:18,303
Been a long time since I've seen him.

81
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:21,607
This wasn't how I envisioned
our next meeting.

82
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:24,027
Would you rather go in alone?

83
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:27,275
No.

84
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,474
Mr. Trager.

85
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:48,372
Yes?

86
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:51,400
- I'm Dr. Keel.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

87
00:04:51,628 --> 00:04:52,729
- Hi.
- So,

88
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:54,324
how's he doing?

89
00:04:54,818 --> 00:04:57,323
Well, I'm afraid there's
been no improvement.

90
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:58,557
Can he hear us?

91
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:01,623
This machine monitors
his neural patterns.

92
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:04,793
The readings indicate that he can't.

93
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:11,924
I'll give you some time with him.

94
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,043
That's probably for the best
that he doesn't know I'm here.

95
00:05:23,175 --> 00:05:24,960
Do you really think that?

96
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,517
Yeah. I was a big disappointment to him.

97
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,966
He never agreed with
how I chose to live my life.

98
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:37,319
Never listened...

99
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:40,110
never cared.

100
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,216
Are you okay?

101
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:51,257
Yeah. I'm fine.

102
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:08,589
God, how long were you standing there?

103
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:10,095
Six seconds.

104
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,930
I haven't seen you since you threw
that hissy fit at the dance.

105
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:15,601
I got mad at my sister.

106
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,552
Remind me never to cross you.

107
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,508
So, what's up?

108
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,451
Uh, I have a session
with your mom today.

109
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:26,281
Oh, I get it.

110
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:28,666
You came by for a damage report.

111
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:30,359
Well...

112
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:35,400
You look awful.

113
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:37,830
Wow. Blunt.

114
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,776
Does it hurt?

115
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:42,577
Looks worse than it is.

116
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,671
I just hope the cops
nail the bastard who did this.

117
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,924
The police?

118
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:49,851
You know, blue hats, shiny badges?

119
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:52,281
Why would they be involved?

120
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:56,419
Last time I checked the statutes,
assault was still a crime.

121
00:06:57,194 --> 00:06:58,200
A crime?

122
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:00,127
Yeah.

123
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:03,676
Plus, the creep who did this
stole the necklace Declan gave me

124
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:05,054
and I want it back.

125
00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:10,580
So, are we done with 20 Questions?

126
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:12,867
I only asked four.

127
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:18,013
Right. Well, you don't want
to keep my mom waiting.

128
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:26,345
What's up, baby? Come on, Declan.

129
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:27,604
Let's move!

130
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,587
Come on! Heads up!

131
00:07:29,902 --> 00:07:31,098
Come on, baby!

132
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:35,474
- Game!
- Nice shot.

133
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:37,277
Is that all you got?

134
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:43,197
You okay?

135
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,998
I didn't sleep much last night.

136
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:47,592
How are you doing?

137
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,193
You mean now that I know
the whole truth about you?

138
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:53,604
I'll never look at science class
the same, that's for sure.

139
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:55,423
I know it was a lot to take in.

140
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,021
You can say that again.

141
00:07:57,153 --> 00:07:58,198
But don't.

142
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:01,207
How's Lori?

143
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:04,529
She's dealing.

144
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,522
You should stop by.
I'm sure she'd appreciate it.

145
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:09,810
I want to, but what about Foss?

146
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:12,027
We can't be sure it was him.

147
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,452
The cops cleared everyone
who was at The Rack,

148
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:16,578
which can only mean one thing:

149
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:18,448
your boy Foss is guilty.

150
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,281
I just can't imagine he would go so far.

151
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,240
Because he's such a model citizen.

152
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,906
The guy's offed how many people
that we know about?

153
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:29,891
So believing he can knock Lori around
is not that big a stretch.

154
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:34,933
I should have seen it coming. I could
have done something to prevent it.

155
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:36,796
Kyle, the guy's a frickin' psycho.

156
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,906
You're not responsible for what he did.

157
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:43,687
You haven't heard from him, have you?

158
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:46,174
Not since he left last week.

159
00:08:46,782 --> 00:08:49,203
And I have no idea where to find him.

160
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:52,977
What are you going to do
if he comes back?

161
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:55,312
I have to figure that out.

162
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:57,693
Meanwhile, you should check on Lori.

163
00:08:57,813 --> 00:09:00,109
At least for now I think it's safe.

164
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:05,606
Lori seems fine.

165
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,140
Well, appearances can be deceiving.

166
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,077
What do you mean?

167
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:14,499
Sometimes people project
what they want others to see,

168
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:18,191
even if it's not an accurate
representation of who they are.

169
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:21,651
We can be different
than who we appear to be?

170
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:28,801
Are you writing that down?

171
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:30,775
Not exactly.

172
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:33,619
Sometimes I record what you say.

173
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,680
Other times, just my thoughts
and impressions.

174
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,876
About me?

175
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:39,803
Well, yes.

176
00:09:40,638 --> 00:09:41,891
Can I read them?

177
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:44,473
Jessi, they're confidential.

178
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,063
You know that.

179
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,505
Let's talk about Emily.

180
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:54,648
Now, when she insisted
that you leave the dance,

181
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:58,330
is that the way she normally behaves
when she's upset with you?

182
00:09:58,577 --> 00:09:59,583
I guess.

183
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:04,027
I know everybody thinks she's so nice,

184
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:05,394
but she's not.

185
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:07,617
She just...

186
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:09,326
appears to be.

187
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,478
What do you mean?

188
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:16,535
She's always saying
that she's in control...

189
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:19,408
telling me where to go
and who to be with.

190
00:10:21,281 --> 00:10:24,319
Sometimes, I'm just
really scared around her.

191
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:39,923
<i>Ever since my trip to the hospital,</i>

192
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:42,031
<i>I felt like I was in a fog.</i>

193
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:45,788
<i>But as my head cleared,
an image appeared in my mind.</i>

194
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:48,873
<i>I didn't know what it was
or why I was drawing it.</i>

195
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,163
<i>I just knew I had to get it out.</i>

196
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:00,217
Dad?

197
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,249
Hey, guys. What's up?

198
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,696
We figured you weren't
feeling that great...

199
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:06,509
Want to go to a movie or something?

200
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:07,632
Our treat.

201
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,364
Wait, you'll actually be seen
at a movie with me?

202
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:13,966
At a time like this, I'm willing to risk
the embarrassment.

203
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:16,168
So you're really okay, then?

204
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:18,058
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

205
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:21,535
Dad, your father's in the hospital.
My face will heal.

206
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:25,681
Grandpa had a chance to be part
of our lives and he chose not to be.

207
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:27,804
Do any of you recognize this?

208
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:30,472
It's a church, dude.

209
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:32,209
That's St. Augustine.

210
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,136
How do you know that?

211
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,878
My father belonged to the congregation.

212
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:38,619
He wanted me and your mom
to get married there.

213
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:40,138
Why did you draw this?

214
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:42,048
I don't know, it just came to me.

215
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:43,681
I must have seen it recently.

216
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:48,169
You couldn't have. This church
was torn down years ago.

217
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,498
No St. Augustine in this one, either.

218
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:05,162
Well, he had to have seen it
in one of these.

219
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,390
Check it out, our first apartment.

220
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:11,497
Yeah, if you can call a basement sublet

221
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:13,662
with bad plumbing and mice an apartment.

222
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:14,953
Hey, I loved it.

223
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:16,085
I did, too.

224
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:22,051
Oh, you were so beautiful.

225
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:26,213
I was afraid you were going
to wise up at the last minute.

226
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:29,180
We could have gotten married
at the church, you know?

227
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:32,160
I would have gone along with it.

228
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,002
You remember how he was.

229
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,381
He had to put his stamp on everything.
If I didn't make a stand with

230
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:41,136
our wedding, he'd have barked religion
at us for the rest of our lives.

231
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:43,561
Instead he just didn't come at all.

232
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:50,171
I know we both made mistakes.

233
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,980
Maybe you should try talking to him.

234
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:59,135
I know he can't hear you,
but saying the words might be enough.

235
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:03,560
I got nothing to say to him.

236
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,758
Not a single picture of the church.
How the hell did Kyle draw this?

237
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:12,322
My Grandfather sent Kyle the image.

238
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:13,595
But he's in a coma.

239
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:15,426
Like that's going to stop Kyle?

240
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,821
Just when I'm ready
to cross "alien" off my list,

241
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:21,508
you pull another stunt
and suck me back in.

242
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:23,616
I don't do stunts.

243
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,415
You know what I mean.

244
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:27,471
Something unexplainable.

245
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:29,161
It is explainable.

246
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:31,282
I'm listening.

247
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:35,454
Okay, I can't explain it... yet,

248
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:38,820
but whatever it is, I'm sure there's
a logical scientific explanation.

249
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:40,339
Don't be so sure.

250
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:43,056
Maybe it's divine intervention.

251
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:44,227
Boring.

252
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,018
Divine intervention?

253
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:49,373
Maybe God wants you to help Stephen
make peace with his father.

254
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:51,823
Do you really think that's possible?

255
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,842
With you, anything's possible.

256
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:07,186
I really wish people
would stop sneaking up on me.

257
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:08,623
Sorry.

258
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:10,965
- How you doing?
- Fine.

259
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:13,899
I never knew there were
so many shades of purple.

260
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:15,297
You're painting your room?

261
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:17,405
Time to change it up in here.

262
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,286
Lori, seriously, are you okay?

263
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:21,744
Did you expect to find me
in the fetal position?

264
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,510
I- I wouldn't blame you.

265
00:14:23,985 --> 00:14:27,535
Look, some coward jumped me. I'm not
going to let him get the best of me.

266
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:29,152
Well, that's great, but

267
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:31,924
I also think you can let yourself
freak out a little.

268
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,638
Are you going
to Preston's party this week?

269
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:37,852
Thinking about it. Are you?

270
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:41,924
I'm sure everyone's expecting me
to hide, but I'm going.

271
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:45,072
- You su...
- Maybe I'll see you there.

272
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:00,501
I hate hospitals.

273
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:02,808
They're always so cold.

274
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:05,583
The colder temperature helps
prevent the spread of viruses.

275
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:08,391
The least they could do
is paint the walls,

276
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,330
make it feel warmer.

277
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:15,870
Was it difficult to see
your father this way?

278
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:18,788
How did you...

279
00:15:20,823 --> 00:15:22,760
Oh, yeah, you're you.

280
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:28,974
Do you think he knows we're here?

281
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:30,671
The doctor said no.

282
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:33,786
He can't be sure, right?
I mean if you received a message...

283
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:35,123
But did I?

284
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,599
I want to believe I can do this, but...

285
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:40,621
Sometimes things happen
that just don't make sense.

286
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,058
You've got to have faith that
they're happening for a reason.

287
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:49,173
Hey.

288
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:51,299
What are you two doing in here?

289
00:15:52,343 --> 00:15:53,670
I know it sounds crazy,

290
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,022
but when I drew that church...

291
00:15:57,126 --> 00:16:00,787
What if your father's trying to
communicate something through me?

292
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:03,241
And you're here waiting
for him to communicate again?

293
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:06,936
I asked Kyle to try, Mr. Trager.
I thought if your father's reaching out

294
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:08,777
- in some way...
- Listen...

295
00:16:08,974 --> 00:16:10,211
I know you two both mean well,

296
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:13,429
but my father had plenty of chances
to reach out and make amends.

297
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,345
What if he wants one more chance?

298
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:19,182
There are no more chances.

299
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,931
At least not for us.

300
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,235
Thanks for taking the time.

301
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,631
I know how hard it must be
trying to balance work and

302
00:16:38,808 --> 00:16:40,649
raise Jessi by yourself.

303
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:43,419
Well, we manage.

304
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:46,610
Still, it must get stressful at times.

305
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:50,807
Nicole, what are you getting at?

306
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:56,493
Jessi's expressed some anxiety to me
about the way you deal with her.

307
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,828
And I saw the dynamic myself
when you showed up at the dance.

308
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:04,024
The dynamic.

309
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:08,005
You seem to get very
hostile and aggressive.

310
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:11,690
I asked her not to go, she did anyway.

311
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:16,415
Do you always react that
way when she doesn't listen?

312
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:19,722
You know, I have to say I thought

313
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:22,419
that Jessi would be making
more progress by now.

314
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:25,077
I think she is.

315
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,614
She's finally starting
to open up to me, and

316
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:30,220
apparently, that makes
you uncomfortable...

317
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,933
and that makes me even more concerned.

318
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:35,844
There's no reason for concern.

319
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,069
But I think I made a mistake
bringing Jessi to you.

320
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:47,128
I think it's vital that
she continue coming.

321
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,448
In fact, if Jessi misses
even one appointment,

322
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,219
I won't hesitate to call
Social Services.

323
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:03,345
<i>We can be different
than who we appear to be.</i>

324
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:05,421
Are you writing that down?

325
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,227
Not exactly.

326
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:37,875
"Jessi lacks empathy...

327
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:41,736
is socially manipulative,
and has no remorse."

328
00:18:45,886 --> 00:18:46,890
Hey.

329
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:49,241
Hi.

330
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:51,204
Sorry it took me so long.

331
00:18:51,356 --> 00:18:54,114
This guy in line changed
his order, like, 60 times.

332
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,675
That's a lot of orders.

333
00:18:55,846 --> 00:18:56,853
Yeah.

334
00:18:59,275 --> 00:19:00,453
What's wrong?

335
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:02,110
What do you mean?

336
00:19:02,243 --> 00:19:05,205
Well, I don't think the coffee
is what's bothering you.

337
00:19:08,762 --> 00:19:09,769
It's just...

338
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,066
- I saw Lori earlier.
- So?

339
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,761
Seeing her all beat up like that...

340
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:17,947
She's trying to convince
herself it's no big deal.

341
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,625
- Maybe it isn't to her.
- How couldn't it be?

342
00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:23,358
Think how you'd feel if you were her.

343
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:26,712
You get attacked and you
don't know why or by who.

344
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:32,938
I guess I never thought about
how it'd make her feel.

345
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:41,370
<i>Adam told me that as my mind developed,</i>

346
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:43,845
<i>new abilities would reveal
themselves to me,</i>

347
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:45,717
<i>like holographic memory.</i>

348
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:47,826
<i>But this was different.</i>

349
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,019
<i>The church wasn't my memory;</i>

350
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,831
<i>it was someone else's.</i>

351
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,170
<i>If this was a new ability,</i>

352
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:56,217
<i>why couldn't I control it?</i>

353
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:57,723
<i>And if it wasn't,</i>

354
00:19:57,913 --> 00:20:00,116
<i>how could it be happening at all?</i>

355
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,671
It's my father's living room.

356
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:04,461
This is incredible.

357
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:06,629
It's exactly how I remember it.

358
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:08,469
How did you do this?

359
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:10,463
I wish I knew.

360
00:21:17,953 --> 00:21:20,067
There's something I want you to see.

361
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:23,733
- You grew up here?
- Yeah, sure did.

362
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:31,555
Been a long time since
I've been in this house.

363
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,641
Nothing has changed.

364
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:55,467
Every night he'd pour himself
a glass of Scotch,

365
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:57,290
sit in this chair,

366
00:21:58,405 --> 00:21:59,867
and read his bible.

367
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:05,422
Put it ahead of everything,
even his family.

368
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,727
Is that why you don't like religion?

369
00:22:09,922 --> 00:22:11,727
It's not that I don't like religion.

370
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:13,033
It's just...

371
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:16,263
that I'm a science guy.
I need hard evidence,

372
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:17,782
proof.

373
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:21,398
My father, he never understood that.

374
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:29,972
Strange how something meant to bring
people together can split so many apart.

375
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,969
I wrote him a letter

376
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:38,987
after the kids were born...

377
00:22:39,861 --> 00:22:42,044
hoping he'd want to
be part of our family.

378
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:47,366
When I came here to give it to
him, we had this huge argument.

379
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,673
He tore it up right in front of me.

380
00:22:55,228 --> 00:22:56,719
Never even read it.

381
00:22:58,822 --> 00:23:00,284
Was that the last time you spoke?

382
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,801
We both said some
horrible things to each other.

383
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:10,172
I have always regretted
the way we left it.

384
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:17,164
So if he's really trying
to say something,

385
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,004
I'm ready to listen.

386
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:26,324
I need to talk to Ballantine,
so I'm just going in.

387
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:29,636
Nicole Trager's threatened
to call Social Services on me.

388
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,050
- Why would she do that?
- It's Jessi.

389
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,072
She's been willful and defiant.

390
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:36,717
She must be complaing about
me during her therapy sessions.

391
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:40,404
She's a computer with a glitch.
Bring her in. We'll fix her.

392
00:23:41,701 --> 00:23:44,680
With all due respect,
I don't think that that's a solution.

393
00:23:46,704 --> 00:23:48,720
You may have downloaded
a history into her brain,

394
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,481
but I've been living with that girl.

395
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:53,989
And she has wants and desires
and feelings like any other teenager.

396
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,908
She's not like any other teenager.

397
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:59,266
But you can't just reboot
her every time she acts like one.

398
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:00,710
Ms. Hollander,

399
00:24:01,836 --> 00:24:03,583
that's not your concern.

400
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:06,136
Look,

401
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:09,272
I don't think I'm the right
person for this assignment.

402
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:11,861
You know, you won't tell me
what we're really doing here,

403
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:15,262
it's taking a lot longer than you led
me to believe, and I miss my little...

404
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:21,413
I think it'd be best if I resigned.

405
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:24,813
You're stressed out.

406
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:27,737
It's a tough assignment.

407
00:24:28,564 --> 00:24:32,172
And now that you're so familiar with our
agenda I expect you to see it through.

408
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,346
Take a few days to reconsider.

409
00:24:43,183 --> 00:24:44,764
We'd hate to lose you.

410
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:04,097
Brought your bible for you, Dad.

411
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:06,518
Thought you'd want it with you.

412
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:17,234
What are you doing...

413
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,058
exactly?

414
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,136
Trying to focus on your father.

415
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:27,516
Anything?

416
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,062
Not yet.

417
00:25:41,718 --> 00:25:43,453
Hey, I was heading out for some coffee.

418
00:25:43,573 --> 00:25:45,271
I thought you might want to come along.

419
00:25:45,873 --> 00:25:48,898
Thanks, I'm already pretty deep
into the Lori Trager trifecta.

420
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,123
You have a trifecta?

421
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:52,992
Trashy magazines,

422
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:54,516
nail polish,

423
00:25:54,873 --> 00:25:56,201
Oprah reruns.

424
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:01,961
I know what you're thinking,
but I'm not here to analyze.

425
00:26:02,237 --> 00:26:05,281
You don't have a shrink speech
prepared for this scenario?

426
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:08,515
I don't have a mom speech
prepared for this, either.

427
00:26:09,787 --> 00:26:12,701
I never thought I'd have to see you
deal with anything like this.

428
00:26:13,525 --> 00:26:15,516
But I know you'll get through it,

429
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,226
and I know you need time,

430
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:20,977
and you should know your dad
and I are here for you if you need us.

431
00:26:21,097 --> 00:26:22,121
Touching.

432
00:26:23,964 --> 00:26:25,065
What are you doing?

433
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:27,173
Taking my Kyle File digital.

434
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,521
Going to go videotape
the collage he drew on his wall.

435
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:32,657
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
How do you think he did that?

436
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:38,364
I gotta go.

437
00:26:44,413 --> 00:26:45,852
Do you know what this means?

438
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:48,765
You're actually doing it.

439
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:50,843
You're really communicating with him.

440
00:26:51,531 --> 00:26:54,494
But what's a church and
an old room supposed to tell me?

441
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,708
Maybe there's more to the message.

442
00:26:57,396 --> 00:26:58,847
I tried and got nothing.

443
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,683
Stephen's finally ready to listen
and I'm letting him down.

444
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:05,844
When my dad was alive,

445
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:10,061
we used to sit in the gardens
at Lancaster Park and talk for hours.

446
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:13,822
He always told me
I could do anything if I just believed.

447
00:27:14,818 --> 00:27:16,097
But what if I fail?

448
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:17,744
You won't.

449
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,822
How can you be so sure?

450
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,594
Because...

451
00:27:22,062 --> 00:27:23,217
I believe in you.

452
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:33,828
about the dance,

453
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:36,828
it didn't really end the way I'd hoped.

454
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,430
I know.

455
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:40,025
With Lori and everything.

456
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:42,139
Yes.

457
00:27:43,504 --> 00:27:44,684
With us, too.

458
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:49,147
The timing wasn't right.

459
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:52,578
When will it be?

460
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:00,601
We'll just know.

461
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:29,350
What is it?

462
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:32,805
I don't know what's wrong with me.

463
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:38,240
Nothing's wrong with you;
you're just confused.

464
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:40,908
I lack empathy,

465
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:42,863
I'm socially manipulative,

466
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:44,535
and I have no remorse.

467
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:48,584
Did Nicole tell you that?

468
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:51,215
I just want things to make sense.

469
00:28:51,412 --> 00:28:54,128
I want to understand
why I do the things I do.

470
00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:57,719
You know...

471
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:01,432
everyone feels that way sometimes.

472
00:29:01,748 --> 00:29:02,903
Do you?

473
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,005
Sure.

474
00:29:14,952 --> 00:29:17,546
Do you remember what
Mom used to say about tomorrow?

475
00:29:18,543 --> 00:29:19,543
Mom?

476
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,441
She said,

477
00:29:23,252 --> 00:29:25,170
"Tomorrow's a clean slate,

478
00:29:26,142 --> 00:29:29,179
"a chance to correct your mistakes
and become a better person. "

479
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:32,111
I want that.

480
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:34,596
I want to change.

481
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:49,000
Don't stay up too late.

482
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:19,528
<i>What was I missing,</i>

483
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,065
<i>not seeing?</i>

484
00:30:21,877 --> 00:30:24,053
<i>I didn't know the answer
and time was running out.</i>

485
00:30:28,762 --> 00:30:30,421
What are you trying to tell me?

486
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:36,920
Hi, it's Emily Hollander.

487
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,919
I thought I'd stop by
and surprise Paige.

488
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,529
Has my mother picked her up yet?

489
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:44,056
<i>Ms. Hollander, the gentleman
from your office picked Paige up early.</i>

490
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,600
- What?
- <i>Yes, they left about half an hour ago.</i>

491
00:30:47,748 --> 00:30:50,170
What gentleman? Who authorized that?

492
00:30:50,496 --> 00:30:51,590
<i>You did.</i>

493
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:07,237
Mom.

494
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:10,762
- Emily, what's wrong?
- Someone picked up Paige from school.

495
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:12,803
I know that. She's here.

496
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:14,229
Mommy, you're home!

497
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:16,504
Oh, God, sweetie, Paige!

498
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:17,992
Oh, you're okay.

499
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,987
Mom, how did she get here?

500
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,417
Nice young man from Madacorp
dropped her off.

501
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,516
And he said to tell you that Madacorp
always has your family in mind.

502
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:42,426
Back to your old tricks, huh?

503
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:44,233
Thought you might get a kick out of it.

504
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,623
So...

505
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:50,074
you're not painting.

506
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:52,238
I decided I like it the way it is.

507
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:54,193
Me, too.

508
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,132
What are you doing here?

509
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,738
I had a feeling you might
not be up to going.

510
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:02,677
Major chick flicks.

511
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,062
You didn't have to.

512
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:06,586
I wanted to.

513
00:33:07,312 --> 00:33:09,808
Just don't tell anyone
you saw me with those.

514
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,451
Well,

515
00:33:17,906 --> 00:33:20,168
I guess I'll leave you to your Kleenex.

516
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:21,828
Actually...

517
00:33:24,385 --> 00:33:26,168
would you mind sticking
around for a while?

518
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,906
Only if...

519
00:33:36,053 --> 00:33:37,430
I can finally hear your song.

520
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:12,961
You never give up, do you?

521
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:16,109
I don't want to,

522
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:19,392
but I'm starting to think we'll
never know what he's trying to tell us.

523
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:23,217
It's certainly not from lack of effort,
that's for sure.

524
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,691
What's that?

525
00:34:33,077 --> 00:34:35,769
I keep seeing the numbers
15 and 11 in my head.

526
00:34:36,581 --> 00:34:38,615
Those are all things
associated with them:

527
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,471
dates,

528
00:34:40,606 --> 00:34:43,151
formulas,
elements of the Periodic Table.

529
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:47,725
15 and 11.

530
00:34:49,926 --> 00:34:51,961
Do those numbers mean anything to you?

531
00:34:53,264 --> 00:34:55,342
Yeah, Luke 15 verse 11.

532
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,170
The Prodigal Son.

533
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,024
It's my dad's favorite passage
in the bible.

534
00:35:15,796 --> 00:35:16,805
What?

535
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,862
What is it?

536
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,404
It's my letter.

537
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:38,519
He read it.

538
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:43,905
You really did it.

539
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:49,044
This is what he's been
trying to tell me.

540
00:35:56,162 --> 00:35:57,798
I heard you, Dad.

541
00:36:15,682 --> 00:36:17,029
Nicole told me.

542
00:36:17,785 --> 00:36:18,805
I'm sorry.

543
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,432
Yeah, he died late last night.

544
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,428
You know, I was thinking about
the last time I spoke to him,

545
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,801
how angry we both were,

546
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,724
when I realized somewhere alone
the way that...

547
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,662
I wasn't angry anymore.

548
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:41,342
I was afraid.

549
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:43,123
Of what?

550
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:45,984
That he didn't care.

551
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,254
But he did.

552
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,368
Yeah, he did.

553
00:36:58,131 --> 00:36:59,569
I want to thank you.

554
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:03,111
What you did...

555
00:37:07,832 --> 00:37:09,947
You've made such
a difference in my life.

556
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:13,193
I'm very happy that you're here.

557
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:15,849
Me, too.

558
00:37:29,237 --> 00:37:30,798
Okay, what's your problem?

559
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:33,183
Don't have one.

560
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:35,617
You've been avoiding me all week.

561
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:36,839
No, I haven't.

562
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:41,409
Seriously, you haven't made one snarky,
wise-ass comment to me in days.

563
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,004
I'm coming up with some new material

564
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,155
and I'm not ready to launch it.

565
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:49,647
Please, as if you have
a self-editing bone in your body.

566
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,560
I'm going to talk about
my feelings, here.

567
00:37:55,721 --> 00:37:57,478
So bear with me if I am

568
00:37:57,638 --> 00:37:59,359
a little less articulate than usual.

569
00:37:59,531 --> 00:38:01,929
I'm not really into the whole
touchy-feely movement.

570
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:03,564
That's more like it.

571
00:38:06,343 --> 00:38:07,400
It's just...

572
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:10,277
every time I look at your eye,

573
00:38:10,782 --> 00:38:11,827
the bruises,

574
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:14,716
I get so mad.

575
00:38:15,757 --> 00:38:17,697
All I wanna do is find the guy
who did this and

576
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:19,677
beat the hell out of him.

577
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,653
It's my job as your brother
to protect you.

578
00:38:23,022 --> 00:38:24,972
It's one thing if
I push you around, but...

579
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:26,219
no one else can.

580
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:28,431
Not if I have anything to say about it.

581
00:38:32,129 --> 00:38:33,604
That make any sense?

582
00:38:36,604 --> 00:38:37,723
Not in public.

583
00:38:39,912 --> 00:38:40,912
And...

584
00:38:41,793 --> 00:38:42,793
one other thing.

585
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:45,703
Hilary Duff called.

586
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:47,351
She wants her shirt back.

587
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:58,510
- Trager.
- So we're back to that, huh?

588
00:38:58,731 --> 00:38:59,949
For old time's sake.

589
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:02,912
It's good to see you
with a smile on your face.

590
00:39:03,477 --> 00:39:05,063
I've been told it suits me.

591
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:08,346
Hey, you heading to Miller's class?

592
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:10,928
Yeah. Just let me
put my stuff in my locker.

593
00:39:14,408 --> 00:39:15,945
This is totally not funny.

594
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:17,899
What is it?

595
00:39:18,354 --> 00:39:20,051
It's my necklace that was stolen.

596
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:26,186
Why did we come to your office?

597
00:39:26,346 --> 00:39:27,945
To get you some help.

598
00:39:28,363 --> 00:39:29,555
Nicole's here?

599
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:32,801
I don't think she's been
a good match for you.

600
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:35,235
You remember Mr. Ballantine?

601
00:39:36,194 --> 00:39:39,010
- Hi.
- Hello, Jessi. Nice to see you again.

602
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:42,329
- What's this about?
- I'll explain everything to you.

603
00:39:42,612 --> 00:39:43,657
Please.

604
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,646
It's okay, Jessi, I'll be right here.

605
00:39:56,106 --> 00:39:57,790
You made the right choice.

606
00:39:58,184 --> 00:40:00,759
Don't worry, we'll take
good care of her.

607
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,066
It's time for you to concentrate
on Stephen Trager.

608
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:29,694
It's beautiful.

609
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:33,321
How'd you know I was here?

610
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:36,715
It's where you used to come
with your father.

611
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:46,614
I heard what happened to Stephen's dad.

612
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:50,069
I'm sorry.

613
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,395
I couldn't have helped him without you.

614
00:40:53,515 --> 00:40:56,056
- Yes, you could.
- You wouldn't let me give up.

615
00:40:57,347 --> 00:40:58,712
And I'm glad you didn't.

616
00:41:00,513 --> 00:41:01,927
You did a great thing.

617
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:05,468
You gave Stephen a chance
to say good-bye.

618
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,972
A lot of people never get that.

619
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:13,520
Like you.

620
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:19,790
When my dad first got sick,

621
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:22,741
I thought everything would be fine,

622
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:25,212
that he'd get through it.

623
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:29,259
I just couldn't imagine
a world without him in it.

624
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:34,411
By the time I got the courage
to go see him at the hospital,

625
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:38,629
he was so out of it
they said he couldn't hear me.

626
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,108
And I believed them.

627
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:46,670
But after seeing what you did...

628
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:49,928
I know they were wrong.

629
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,223
He could hear me.

630
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,530
So, did you ever solve how you did it?

631
00:42:04,595 --> 00:42:05,726
Not really.

632
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:10,926
But I thought about what you said,
that some things science can't explain.

633
00:42:11,971 --> 00:42:13,397
What I realized was that...

634
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:17,467
it doesn't matter
how it happened or even why.

635
00:42:19,544 --> 00:42:21,216
What matters is it did.

636
00:42:26,246 --> 00:42:27,549
What's that look?

637
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:30,771
You're the mind-reader.

638
00:42:32,062 --> 00:42:33,193
You tell me.
