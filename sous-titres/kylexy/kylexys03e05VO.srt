00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:02,084
<i>Prevously on Kyle XY...</i>

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,836
You are our greatest achievement

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,869
and we want to have a
relationship with you.

4
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:08,658
- A relationship to do what?
- Come see what we're about.

5
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:12,101
We are making state of the art
advances in science and technology.

6
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:13,248
I'm not interested.

7
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:15,711
Is there a romantic interest
I'm not aware of?

8
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:16,941
Only Kyle.

9
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:18,977
If you really sense that

10
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:21,918
special bond between you and Kyle,
you should act on it.

11
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:24,269
How did you know his name?
I never mentioned it.

12
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:27,350
There's a lot of things
I know about you, Jessi.

13
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,840
A lot more than you think.
I think it's time I explained.

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,864
As long as you don't rat me
out to Mom and Dad.

15
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:33,616
- I won't.
- Fine.

16
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,160
Thank you, Jessi. I knew you
couldn't keep your mouth shut.

17
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,426
- Jessi didn't have to say a word.
- I'm sure she was a pillar of secrecy.

18
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:40,985
I thought you'd be with Andy.

19
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,417
Her mom's extended their
vacation rental.

20
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:45,920
- I really miss her.
- Listen to me.

21
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:48,756
- Adam Baylin...
- What? What about him?

22
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:50,966
Adam died today.

23
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:54,470
You may not realize it yet,
but this changes everything.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,316
How's the speech?

25
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,186
Overwritten and tedious.

26
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:10,799
I doubt that.

27
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:13,698
Most of the speeches at
the psychology conference usually are.

28
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,370
Thanks for coming, by the way.

29
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:18,864
Thanks for inviting me.

30
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:20,783
I thought you could use
a weekend away.

31
00:01:20,883 --> 00:01:23,290
And I knew Josh would love
the free room service.

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,512
It's nice to see you smiling.

33
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:31,156
There hasn't been a lot
to smile about lately, I know.

34
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:32,219
You okay?

35
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:34,051
I think so.

36
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:35,928
It's okay if you're not.

37
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:40,504
When somebody you love dies it can
take awhile to make sense of it all.

38
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,060
Yeah, especially since Baylin
technically died twice.

39
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,788
- Just saying.
- Maybe we should ride for a while

40
00:01:46,888 --> 00:01:48,399
in contemplative silence.

41
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,183
Suit yourself.

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,127
Let me know when we hit the hotel.

43
00:01:52,227 --> 00:01:54,662
I'll be the guy in the
heated pool all weekend.

44
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,418
<i>Nicole had suggested this weekend away</i>

45
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,497
<i>as a chance to get away from
everything that was on my mind.</i>

46
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:03,034
<i>We were miles away from home</i>

47
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:06,083
<i>and it seemed my mind had
brought my problems along...</i>

48
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:07,369
<i>uninvited.</i>

49
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:10,149
Why're you moving Adam around?

50
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:13,799
We figured if Latnok couldn't find him
they couldn't convince him to come back.

51
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:15,502
They want me to come work with them.

52
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,137
With Baylin gone they'll have
even more reason now.

53
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,889
I won't do it.

54
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:22,057
Well, they give you the choice.

55
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:24,906
I was gonna tell Amanda everything.

56
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:29,482
You'll just be adding her to a list of
people that you've already compromised.

57
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,026
- Is that what my life is now?
- More than ever.

58
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:35,812
- What's the matter?
- That sign we just passed,

59
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:37,490
it says we're on Route 41.

60
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:40,242
I must have taken the wrong road.

61
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,995
- What's going on?
- Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

62
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,727
I knew I should have driven.

63
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:46,791
Very funny, but we need
to get off this road.

64
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:49,024
I can turn at the next exit.

65
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,148
Watch out!

Seatbelts totally save lives.

72
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:39,423
How bad is it?

73
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:42,595
It's pretty bad.

74
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:47,072
- Do you have your phone?
- Yeah.

75
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:50,896
I got nothing.

76
00:03:52,427 --> 00:03:53,427
You guys,

77
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:57,695
I think I'm stuck. The dashboard
on my side is caved in.

78
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,653
Let me help you.

79
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,399
No, no, no, stop.

80
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:06,567
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine. I just can't get out.

81
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,372
Let me try the other side.

82
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:20,620
I don't think anybody's coming in
or going out this way.

83
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,610
<i>Hello? Are you all right?</i>

84
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,673
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

85
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,327
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

86
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:29,685
- You sure you're okay?
- No, I'm fine. I can just sit here

87
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,736
- until someone comes.
<i>- Is anyone hurt?</i>

88
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,689
I don't have any choice about it, do I?

89
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,484
<i>It's freaking me out
that nobody's answering.</i>

90
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:40,191
<i>Hello!</i>

91
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,065
I'll stay with Mom.

92
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:46,878
We're fine.

93
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:51,136
Oh, my God. I thought you guys
were straight up toast.

94
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:53,747
Which would
have been a downer.

95
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:56,840
The upside is, I have someone
who can push my car out of the road,

96
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,732
so thanks to you,
I'm no longer a highway hazard.

97
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,928
Not counting the accident
I just caused, of course.

98
00:05:06,242 --> 00:05:08,647
By someone who can help I meant you.

99
00:05:08,747 --> 00:05:11,024
Come on. It'll only take a sec.

100
00:05:21,262 --> 00:05:23,572
Geez, Louise. Stare much?

101
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,368
- You're pregnant.
- Holy crap. Really?

102
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:29,286
I got it.

103
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:37,529
God, I hope somebody comes by.

104
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,947
No one ever drives this road.

105
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:49,181
- See? That only took, like...
- Twenty seven point two seconds.

106
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:51,100
But who's counting?

107
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:58,253
Are you all right?

108
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:00,693
It's all good.
Braxton Hicks.

109
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:02,911
Is that your baby's name?

110
00:06:04,638 --> 00:06:06,487
Braxton Hicks contractions.

111
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:08,117
It'll pass.

112
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:15,249
I think I'm gonna walk back a ways,
see if I can't flag somebody down.

113
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:18,690
- But you're pregnant.
- And you're repeating yourself,

114
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,564
so either you're a dumb little bunny,

115
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:22,260
or you have a concussion.

116
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,466
Either way,
you're gonna need some help.

117
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,824
- You should stay here. I...
- I'm not an invalid.

118
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:31,361
- You won't see anybody for miles.
- I'm fine.

119
00:06:38,117 --> 00:06:38,944
What?

120
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,860
My water just broke.

121
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:51,383
You left these
on top of the dryer.

122
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:53,583
I thought I'd bring them to you.

123
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:00,314
I just made that.

124
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:05,123
With military precision. Don't want
to wreck the hospital corners.

125
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:08,604
You seriously don't want me
sitting on your bed?

126
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:10,520
I like to keep my room clean.

127
00:07:13,524 --> 00:07:14,717
Totally get it.

128
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:16,594
Your space, your rules.

129
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:20,153
Is that my shirt?

130
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:22,608
You never wear it anymore.

131
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:24,895
So, you just took it?

132
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:27,684
You shouldn't wear this color.

133
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:29,198
It looks better on me.

134
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:33,660
Okay, so I can't sit on your bed
but you can just raid my closet?

135
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:37,748
Jessi, that is 100 percent not
cool of you. That shirt is mine.

136
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:39,476
Did you buy it?

137
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,669
Then, technically, it's not yours.

138
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,664
Dad!

139
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:50,469
Are we having this discussion?

140
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,682
- She's inappropriate.
- She's mean to me.

141
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:53,842
I am not mean!

142
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:56,037
You're only nice to me
when you want something.

143
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:58,743
- Both of you, give it a rest.
- Just keep her out of my face!

144
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:00,813
I already told her it's not her color.

145
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,145
You said you were coming right back.

146
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:07,963
I was hoping to get this car started.

147
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,272
If I had the right parts
I could get you to the hospital

148
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:11,818
before your baby was born.

149
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,079
Check it, bunny.
And, by the way,

150
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:16,771
no offense,
you're cute as a button, but,

151
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,050
I'm the reject from
the Macy's Parade, all right?

152
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,303
I think I'd know if
I'm actually going into labor.

153
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:23,053
She's going into labor?

154
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:26,463
- Who's this guy?
- That's Josh.

155
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:28,715
- And bunny over there?
- Kyle.

156
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,688
Great.

157
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:31,024
I'm Gretchen.

158
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:33,755
I want you to both listen to me
very carefully, all right?

159
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:35,436
I'm in my 35th week.

160
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:37,295
I'm not due for at least another month.

161
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:38,744
But your water just broke.

162
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:41,082
You can expect to give birth
in as few as two hours.

163
00:08:41,182 --> 00:08:42,935
Or as much as
a full day from now.

164
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:45,899
- How do you know that?
- He knows a lot of stuff.

165
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,811
Okay, then. Figure out how to get us
out of here in under two hours so that

166
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:53,115
I don't have to give birth in the woods
like some crazy wolf mother person.

167
00:08:54,343 --> 00:08:56,535
Lucky for you, Kyle's
an expert at wood births.

168
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:59,041
I'll go talk to Nicole.

169
00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:02,708
- And she would be?
- My mom.

170
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,205
Finally. Someone who knows
something about having a baby.

171
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:08,628
Get her up here.

172
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:11,543
I'll be right back.

173
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:16,432
So,

174
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:18,223
your mom's okay, right?

175
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:21,752
She's just...

176
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:23,604
stuck.

177
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:29,321
You hungry?

178
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:32,020
I've got some smoking hot
cheese crackles in the car.

179
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,951
Those things are disgusting.

180
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:36,575
And I love them.

181
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,627
Well, I took basic human biology,
but as far as my own experience goes,

182
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:43,543
it's basically,
breathe, push, catch.

183
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:45,046
What, like football?

184
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:47,836
We're not gonna be able to do this.

185
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,796
Sure, you can.
You read the encyclopedia.

186
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,904
Which gives a brief overview
of the physiological process.

187
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:55,093
But it doesn't tell you
how to deliver a baby safely.

188
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,553
How's she doing now?

189
00:09:57,568 --> 00:10:00,223
She's trying to hide it, but
she's had a few contractions.

190
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:03,297
About 20 minutes apart,
30 to 45 seconds each.

191
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:05,996
Okay, well, it does sound
like she's in labor.

192
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:09,120
The contractions are just her cervix
dilating so the baby can come out.

193
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,054
We still have some time.

194
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:13,560
- I can go get help.
- No, no, you shouldn't leave her.

195
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,510
- I'll go.
- Walk three steps without limping.

196
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:22,562
Look, we may not like it,

197
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:25,008
but we're just gonna have
to sit tight until help comes.

198
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,334
- Here's another thing.
- About the baby?

199
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,603
You can't delay labor
once it starts.

200
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:32,506
So, if the baby comes
before help does?

201
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,801
Then Kyle will be delivering it,
whether he wants to or not.

202
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,180
Holy mother of macaroni!

203
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:46,774
Wait.

204
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,084
I feel it.

205
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,239
A heartbeat.

206
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,845
Really?

207
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:04,913
Show me.

208
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,019
Oh, my God.

209
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,311
You...

210
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:20,499
totally distracted me.

211
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,112
Swell job. Contraction's over.

212
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,600
I wasn't pretending.

213
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,001
Really?

214
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:36,903
You have ultrasound hands?

215
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:41,074
Any other superpowers
I should know about?

216
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,271
'Cause, I mean, if you could fly me
to Seattle General right about now...

217
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,629
I think you could use
some water.

218
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,833
Wait, don't leave me.
She freaks me out!

219
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:57,867
I have an idea.
I'm gonna try and reach Jessi.

220
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,465
Don't you guys have to be in the same
room for your mind mail to work?

221
00:12:01,565 --> 00:12:03,268
I have to try something.

222
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,057
Make sure
Gretchen's comfortable.

223
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,226
I'll just be a minute.
Try your cell again.

224
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:20,200
<i>When we were touching, Jessi and I
could access each other's minds.</i>

225
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,355
<i>We could always sense
one another if we were near.</i>

226
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:29,309
<i>But lost in the woods,
miles from home,</i>

227
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:32,000
<i>I had no idea if she would
pick up what I was sending.</i>

228
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:35,319
<i>Or if she could understand
that we need help.</i>

229
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:41,019
- Father-daughter bonding?
- He's keeping me out of your hair.

230
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:44,262
- You're welcome to play, you know.
- Right. She probably cheats.

231
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,180
Accident.

232
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:08,335
- What's happening?
- Sorry, I was trying to reach Jessi.

233
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:11,422
- Are you okay? You...
- Oh, I'm fine. Did it work?

234
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:13,667
- I have no idea.
- Kyle, get up here!

235
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,899
- I think Gretchen needs your help now.
- I don't know what to do.

236
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:19,260
Well, just tell her to push
when she feels like it and

237
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,258
trust her body to do most of the work.

238
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:23,799
Is that all?
There's nothing else I can do?

239
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:27,973
All you have to do is keep her calm
and focused and encouraged.

240
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:30,508
Focused and encouraged.

241
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,704
Less than two minutes
since the last contraction.

242
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:37,908
- The baby's coming.
- Then you'd better get to it.

243
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,890
Josh, grab a blanket.

244
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,791
Use a couple of bags as pillows and
set it up on that hillside over there.

245
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,565
- There's one in the trunk of my car.
- We're gonna get you propped up.

246
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:14,790
Maybe a little Gravity will do
part of the work.

247
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,737
Ready?

248
00:14:17,443 --> 00:14:18,319
Come on.

249
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,495
Got one.

250
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,956
I think it's coming right now.
Can you see anything?

251
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:40,379
If you're waiting for a handwritten
invitation, it's gonna be a while.

252
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:41,383
Wait.

253
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:43,590
Risk of infection.

254
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:46,956
Nicely done, excitable, sidekick.

255
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,400
Okay, I'm ready.

256
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:56,561
I just lost my virginity.
I'm not ready for this.

257
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,426
He's a regular
Santa's little helper, huh?

258
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,488
It's okay. Go ahead and push.

259
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,589
Just keep pushing.

260
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:12,327
I can't do this. We need help.
We need serious help.

261
00:15:12,593 --> 00:15:14,579
Don't worry. We're gonna get it.

262
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,809
Everything okay?

263
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:19,555
Something's wrong.

264
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,580
- What is it?
- I don't know.

265
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,383
That's not a word.

266
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:27,881
- That's definitely a word.
- Not according to the game dictionary.

267
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:29,450
How do you know that?

268
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:32,556
Of course. You read it.

269
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:35,767
I'll get it.

270
00:15:36,713 --> 00:15:38,645
I'll get it. I need a break.

271
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:44,841
Oh, look. We're out of my soda.
I wonder how that happened.

272
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:46,606
And yes, I bought it.

273
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:49,635
- Now you're just being selfish.
- I'm being selfish?

274
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:52,150
You're the one who takes what
she wants when she wants it.

275
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,650
- That's called being assertive.
- You are unbelievable.

276
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:58,123
Have you heard from your mother?

277
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,670
No, but I'd like to have
a few words with her right now.

278
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,356
Someone just called. Her speech is in
half an hour and they haven't arrived.

279
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:06,356
They were supposed
to be there hours ago.

280
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:08,091
- I know.
- Stephen.

281
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,985
- Have you heard anything from Kyle?
- I think so.

282
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:11,886
Look.

283
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:20,486
"Crash. Ravine."

284
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:22,045
"Distress."

285
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:25,885
- Dad, you don't think...?
- No, we don't know anything yet.

286
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,320
You try their cell phones.
I'll try Highway Patrol.

287
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,244
I can't do it.

288
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,455
You're doing great.
Just keep pushing.

289
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,081
Just stop, okay?

290
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,460
I'm tired of pushing and
I just want this to be over.

291
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:46,204
What's wrong?

292
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,085
Gretchen, I promise
I'll be right back.

293
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:51,926
I'm just going to the car, okay?

294
00:16:52,618 --> 00:16:53,484
Okay?

295
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,456
Bring back drugs, please.

296
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,958
- How's the baby doing?
- I was getting a strong

297
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:12,548
heartbeat earlier but it's fading
fast and the labor's not progressing.

298
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:14,240
I don't know what to tell you.

299
00:17:17,432 --> 00:17:19,788
I could stimulate the baby
with a little charge.

300
00:17:20,054 --> 00:17:21,856
You don't think
that would be dangerous?

301
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:23,291
I've done it before.

302
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,185
What's wrong?

303
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:30,956
- You're warm.
- I got banged up a little.

304
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:32,300
Nicole, you're bleeding!

305
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,613
Oh, no, no, it's not that bad.

306
00:17:34,713 --> 00:17:37,222
- I gotta get you out of here.
- The baby needs you.

307
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,271
- You need help.
- Somebody has to help

308
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:42,577
that poor girl bring her baby safely
into the world, and that person is you.

309
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:43,693
Now, go!

310
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:47,246
I'll be back for you
as soon as I can.

311
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:56,491
Go.

312
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:04,739
Anything?

313
00:18:05,257 --> 00:18:07,590
We know that they were
headed east on Interstate 90.

314
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,483
Nicole used her credit card
at a gas station

315
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,089
about 42 miles outside of Seattle.

316
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,924
Narrows our route options
down to nine.

317
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,980
So they either tookay a wrong turn

318
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,928
or maybe they decided
to take a scenic route.

319
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,359
Kyle was driving, they wouldn't
have taken a wrong turn.

320
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:20,807
You're right. Maybe...

321
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:23,184
It's got to be
one of the scenic routes.

322
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,051
That narrows it down to

323
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,521
Rocky Canyon Road,

324
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,732
Silica Heights

325
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:30,942
and Elk Heights.

326
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:33,695
I'll try to get Highway Patrol
to search those roads.

327
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,162
<i>Yes, officer, Stephen Trager once
again. Apparently, my family...</i>

328
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:43,395
Wait.

329
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,957
- It's Route 41.
- Hold, please.

330
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:49,335
- That's not one of the routes.
- I know but that's what it is.

331
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,038
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

332
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:54,841
It's Route 41.

333
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:02,891
- Something's wrong. I know it.
- No.

334
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,143
Gretchen, I need your help.
Can you stay with me?

335
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,421
Good. You're gonna have
another contraction in a minute.

336
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:11,733
And when it comes
I need you to push.

337
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,897
Just close your eyes
and focus, okay?

338
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:16,654
- Okay.
- Just think of something happy.

339
00:19:18,036 --> 00:19:20,758
- Smoking hot cheese crackles?
- Yeah, that'll work.

340
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:26,956
Okay. Okay, it's coming.

341
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,556
Cheese crackle!
Cheese crackle! Cheese crackle!

342
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,764
Push. Come on, one more.

343
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:46,142
Come on, you're doing it.

344
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:48,812
You're doing it!
You're doing it.

345
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,181
Keep pushing.

346
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:04,577
It's a boy.

347
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,421
I'm gonna name him
"Dumb Little Bunny" after you.

348
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,173
You will?

349
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:20,802
Absolutely not.

350
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:26,599
Keep screaming, little buddy.

351
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,810
Maybe somebody will
finally hear us out here.

352
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,980
I promise you,
I'm gonna try and be, like,

353
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,858
the most rad mother ever, okay?

354
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,029
It's okay. It's okay.

355
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,990
- I'll go tell Mom.
- No, stay here.

356
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,328
- But I want...
- Josh, stay here.

357
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:52,959
I hope he has an inny.
Outy belly buttons are just weird.

358
00:20:53,272 --> 00:20:54,836
Just be glad he has one.

359
00:22:29,794 --> 00:22:31,949
- What's he saying?
- Is it good or bad?

360
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:33,977
Maybe if you shut up he could hear.

361
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:38,432
<i>Your wife has...</i>

362
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,529
<i>internal injuries.</i>

363
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,714
<i>Her organs are in distress.</i>

364
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,975
<i>She has a punctured lung and</i>

365
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:48,024
<i>right now her condition
is critical but stable.</i>

366
00:22:48,124 --> 00:22:49,991
What is it ?
What's wrong ?

367
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,501
There's too much noise.

368
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:08,616
Well, she's out of surgery.

369
00:23:09,277 --> 00:23:12,132
They were able to stop the internal
bleeding but there was some damage.

370
00:23:12,232 --> 00:23:13,743
So, she'll be okay ?

371
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:17,063
The doctors say the first
few hours will be critical.

372
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:18,508
She's a fighter.

373
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,732
And they're hopeful
she can pull through.

374
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,735
Of course she'll pull through.
She's Mom. She'll be fine.

375
00:23:26,256 --> 00:23:28,531
- Can we see her ?
- What are you crying for ?

376
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:30,783
We have to stay calm.

377
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,554
Visitors aren't allowed in the ICU,
but once she feels better

378
00:23:33,654 --> 00:23:36,806
- we'll be able to get back there.
- We have to just sit here ?

379
00:23:36,906 --> 00:23:38,331
I know it's hard.

380
00:23:38,935 --> 00:23:39,760
But...

381
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,377
we have to put
our trust in her doctors.

382
00:23:44,604 --> 00:23:47,097
Now, they want me to fill out
some forms, so...

383
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:48,499
I'll be back.

384
00:23:54,212 --> 00:23:56,949
- Where's Jessi ?
- Outside somewhere.

385
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:02,800
I shouldn't have left her.

386
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:06,406
If I would have
got her out of the car, then...

387
00:24:06,506 --> 00:24:08,391
Kyle, this isn't your fault.

388
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:13,929
I can't just wait here
and do nothing.

389
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:16,871
Then don't.

390
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,560
You can help her.

391
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,293
- But Stephen said her doctors...
- Forget her doctors.

392
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:24,417
All of them combined
aren't as smart as you.

393
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:27,048
You know I'd do anything
to help Nicole.

394
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:29,061
But I don't know how.

395
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,719
And even if I did,
they won't let me back there.

396
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,111
You can't let a little thing
like that stop you.

397
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,750
If you don't know it by now,
you might as well give up.

398
00:25:47,027 --> 00:25:48,205
Now I know it.

399
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:54,583
Come on !

400
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:07,227
That's not gonna make it work.

401
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:10,007
I'm sure Jessi could fix it.

402
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,980
You have to stop
fighting with Jessi.

403
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,958
Why? Because she's the supernatural
genius who saved the day ?

404
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:18,367
No.
Because you're betterthan this.

405
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,140
Am I? Because I sort of thought I was
the one who picked fights

406
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,072
and then stood around like an idiot
while everyone solved the problem.

407
00:26:24,172 --> 00:26:26,164
There is nothing you could do.

408
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,852
That's the point.

409
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,250
Jessi figured out where they were,

410
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,912
Kyle delivered a baby.

411
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:33,586
Even Josh was a hero.

412
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,450
And... now...

413
00:26:36,631 --> 00:26:37,855
Mom's in there and

414
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:40,556
there's not a thing
that I can do to help.

415
00:26:42,008 --> 00:26:43,970
You help just by being here.

416
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:47,418
That's not much, Dad.

417
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:49,139
It is more than enough.

418
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,188
It's helping me, okay ?

419
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:56,551
Okay.

420
00:27:09,057 --> 00:27:10,294
Patient is male,

421
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,051
23 year old mechanic,
admitted non-responsive.

422
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:15,284
History of depression
but no drug overdose.

423
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,494
Toxicology reports are negative.

424
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,093
Patient was dehydrated
and in metabolic acidosis.

425
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,021
Course of action ?

426
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,192
What do you got ?

427
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,001
He's a mechanic.

428
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:38,322
He may have injected antifreeze,
which means possible glycol poisoning.

429
00:27:40,377 --> 00:27:41,498
Impressive.

430
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:47,203
How is it possible we haven't worked
a shift together all year ?

431
00:27:47,303 --> 00:27:48,986
I wasn't supposed
to be here today.

432
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,569
Keep up, gentlemen.

433
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:54,498
Female, car accident.

434
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:58,730
Laceration to right torso, blood loss

435
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,296
and acute internal injuries
including rib fracture,

436
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:04,390
subsequent pneumothorax.

437
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:09,635
Blood oxygen levels extremely
low, blood pressure is down.

438
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,189
What can we expect to see,
moving forward ?

439
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,526
- Possible sepsis ?
- No sign of external infection.

440
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:17,528
Anyone else ?

441
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,232
If her heart rate continues
to fall, her kidneys will fail.

442
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:23,993
Other organs would follow.

443
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:24,986
Correct.

444
00:28:25,242 --> 00:28:28,377
Unfortunately, the damage
is extensive and her systems

445
00:28:28,477 --> 00:28:30,776
have already shown signs of failure.

446
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,379
So, we do nothing ?

447
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:34,433
We've done all we can.

448
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:36,914
Our job now is to make sure
she's comfortable.

449
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:38,858
There has to be a way to heal her.

450
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:41,766
Can we rebuild the cells
in her damaged organs ?

451
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:44,268
Forward-thinking but hardly realistic.

452
00:28:44,368 --> 00:28:47,133
That sort of stem cell
technology is years away.

453
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:48,575
Now, let's move on.

454
00:29:01,096 --> 00:29:03,437
Andy, hey, I keep
getting your voicemail.

455
00:29:03,537 --> 00:29:05,936
Anyway, you know how you always
tell me to charge my phone

456
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:09,005
in case of an emergency ?
Well, you were right, I was wrong.

457
00:29:09,105 --> 00:29:11,620
Now, I don't want you to freak
out, but I'm at the hospital.

458
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,396
I'll try to talk quick so my phone
doesn't cut off before I can...

459
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:18,710
tell you what happened.

460
00:29:59,438 --> 00:30:01,016
I'm sorry I left you.

461
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:06,085
But I'm here now.

462
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:09,754
And I'm going to make you better.

463
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:11,684
I promise.

464
00:30:35,715 --> 00:30:39,253
<i>Code blue, room 347,
Code blue, room 347.</i>

465
00:30:40,613 --> 00:30:42,589
What are you doing in here ?

466
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,219
A power surge must have set off
the alarm. Vitals appear stable.

467
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,374
Is she better ?

468
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:50,825
She'd have much better odds
if you weren't interfering.

469
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:54,993
If I catch you alone with her again I'll
have you thrown out of the hospital.

470
00:31:04,221 --> 00:31:08,203
<i>I had saved one life today by helping
Gretchen's child into the world.</i>

471
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:11,411
<i>The birth in the woods was
more natural and beautiful</i>

472
00:31:11,511 --> 00:31:13,621
<i>than anything
I had ever experienced.</i>

473
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:16,024
<i>And so different
from my own birth.</i>

474
00:31:16,728 --> 00:31:21,013
<i>But it had also shown me how life and
death exist in uncertain equilibrium.</i>

475
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:24,048
<i>Would I be able to save Nicole
and keep the scales balanced?</i>

476
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:27,866
<i>Did supporting one life
mean I had to lose another?</i>

477
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,022
I never got a chance
to thank you.

478
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,356
You got my message
and sent help.

479
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:43,948
You heard me.

480
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:48,948
Is there any news?

481
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:56,533
I couldn't help her.

482
00:31:58,193 --> 00:32:00,544
With everything we can do, I can't...

483
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:03,054
There must be something.

484
00:32:10,114 --> 00:32:11,512
He's so beautiful.

485
00:32:12,758 --> 00:32:14,207
And she's so happy.

486
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:18,177
We never had that.

487
00:32:19,057 --> 00:32:19,853
No.

488
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:25,268
It's hard to believe he wasn't
even here a few hours ago.

489
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,506
He was still safe and protected.

490
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:32,705
And all he had to do
was get bigger and stronger.

491
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,621
Now he's out here in the world
and anything can happen.

492
00:32:39,532 --> 00:32:42,835
Do you think it's better
to stay in a pod for 16 years?

493
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,327
I guess the important thing
is what we do after we're born.

494
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,431
The fluid.

495
00:32:57,404 --> 00:32:58,154
What?

496
00:32:58,354 --> 00:33:00,311
Adam's substitute for amniotic fluid.

497
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,547
It's what nourished us
while we were in the pod.

498
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,526
You think it could help Nicole?

499
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:07,351
Adam used it to heal himself
from a gunshot wound.

500
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:09,876
It might help restore
her damaged tissue.

501
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:13,032
As far as Nicole's doctors know,
that fluid doesn't even exist.

502
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:18,621
There is one place
you might be able to get some.

503
00:33:20,572 --> 00:33:23,042
- I can't ask Latnok.
- How could you not?

504
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,864
I know how you feel about them,
but Nicole is in trouble.

505
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:29,011
You have to ask for their help.

506
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:30,716
You have to try.

507
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:52,179
Josh told me I could find you here.

508
00:33:55,405 --> 00:33:57,100
I've spent my life

509
00:33:57,466 --> 00:33:59,894
respecting science and logic.

510
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:03,650
Rejecting religion.

511
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:11,788
But when it comes right down to it,
I'm sitting here praying for a miracle

512
00:34:11,888 --> 00:34:13,217
to spare my wife.

513
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:26,340
It may not be a miracle, but I think
I know a way I can help her.

514
00:34:28,837 --> 00:34:30,435
Adam Baylin's formula.

515
00:34:31,132 --> 00:34:33,441
- From the pod. I can inject it...
- Inject it?

516
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:34,571
Into her IV.

517
00:34:36,499 --> 00:34:38,950
The doctors don't have
an alternative.

518
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,553
Kyle, you know that I...

519
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,746
- But this...
- Is hope.

520
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,289
A real chance.

521
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:56,184
Let me do this.

522
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:05,864
Anyway, I hope you get this.

523
00:35:05,964 --> 00:35:08,923
My cell phone's dead
so I guess I'll try again later.

524
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,924
I don't know how you spent
so much time in hospitals.

525
00:35:12,024 --> 00:35:15,118
I mean, I know you had to,
but they're creepy and weird.

526
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:17,189
I hate this waiting!

527
00:35:23,598 --> 00:35:24,709
I'm just...

528
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,791
pretty scared.

529
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:30,791
Andy, please.

530
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,480
You get back.

531
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,343
<i>Please deposit 85 cents.</i>

532
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:36,708
Wait, wait.

533
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,312
<i>Please deposit 85 cents.</i>

534
00:35:39,412 --> 00:35:41,183
Hold on, I'm not done yet.

535
00:35:57,667 --> 00:36:01,452
- Why are you still out here?
- The waiting room is for family only.

536
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:03,118
You're family, sort of.

537
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:04,489
Not really.

538
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,850
Yes, you are.

539
00:36:08,661 --> 00:36:11,816
As much as I try to convince
myself that you're not.

540
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,008
I'm sorry I make you miserable.

541
00:36:16,658 --> 00:36:19,209
You don't make me miserable.
I'm just...

542
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:21,857
a miserable person sometimes.

543
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:22,986
Why?

544
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:25,957
I don't know. I just am.

545
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:29,468
I don't like fighting with you.

546
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,614
- Yes, you do. You're good at it.
- You're better.

547
00:36:32,714 --> 00:36:33,464
I am?

548
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:36,136
You always know what to say to win.

549
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:39,335
And that's something
to be so proud of?

550
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:40,405
Still,

551
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:42,593
it's impressive.

552
00:36:44,234 --> 00:36:47,454
I feel like all I've been doing
lately is fighting with people.

553
00:36:48,084 --> 00:36:49,385
You should stop.

554
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,240
You're probably right.

555
00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:54,728
Especially now.

556
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,552
Kyle will fix it.

557
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:03,274
That's what he's good at.

558
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,091
You gotta love Kyle.

559
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,746
I mean in a

560
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:10,254
platonic, brotherly sort of way.

561
00:37:13,751 --> 00:37:16,753
I'm sorry I said all those
things to you earlier.

562
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:18,354
I was panicked and

563
00:37:19,357 --> 00:37:20,909
I took it out on you.

564
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,828
It's just...

565
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:26,118
my family.

566
00:37:29,603 --> 00:37:31,206
They mean everything to me.

567
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:34,084
They mean everything to me, too.

568
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:36,293
I know they do.

569
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:43,766
She's not doing well and the doctors
don't think she can make it.

570
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:47,320
But the fluid that Adam invented
has regenerative properties.

571
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,105
I know Latnok helped him
when he was healing.

572
00:37:50,718 --> 00:37:53,269
And you think we kept
the leftovers?

573
00:37:55,618 --> 00:37:57,542
My mother is dying!

574
00:38:01,504 --> 00:38:02,393
Please.

575
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:06,950
I have what you need.

576
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,548
I can get it to you.

577
00:38:09,768 --> 00:38:10,824
Thank you.

578
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,639
But you have to
do something for me.

579
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:18,698
Join us at Latnok.

580
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,464
Participate.

581
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,051
- You're using this situation?
- You are asking me

582
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,066
to provide you with the one thing
that might save your mother's life

583
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:30,209
and yet you continue to see
Latnok as evil in some way.

584
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:34,613
We are all about
scientific advances like Baylin's.

585
00:38:36,753 --> 00:38:38,482
All I'm asking you is,

586
00:38:39,843 --> 00:38:41,261
take part.

587
00:38:45,577 --> 00:38:48,042
I can have that fluid here
in 20 minutes.

588
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:49,643
It's your choice.

589
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,064
<i>A chance</i>

590
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:56,878
<i>to save the woman
who had saved my life</i>

591
00:38:56,978 --> 00:38:59,188
<i>just by letting me into hers.</i>

592
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,511
<i>As far as I was concerned,</i>

593
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:03,760
<i>my choice had already
been made.</i>

594
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:44,751
She's gonna be okay.

595
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,167
That's awesome news.
She'll recover.

596
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:05,272
I don't like
being dishonest with him.

597
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,375
All you did was help
lead him to the cure.

598
00:42:09,475 --> 00:42:12,863
Gave him a nudge in the right direction.
And now Nicole's better, right?

599
00:42:13,747 --> 00:42:16,100
I pushed Kyle to go to Latnok today

600
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,444
because I knew it could
save Nicole's life.

601
00:42:18,544 --> 00:42:21,246
Now if you ever
do anything to harm him,

602
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:23,585
or anyone in that family,

603
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:25,167
I'll kill you.

604
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:29,233
I understand.
