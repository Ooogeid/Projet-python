1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,870
Previously on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,540
You have no idea
how disappointed I am right now

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,050
Don't you even care that
I'm not happy at the conservatory?

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,500
Thank you for letting me know
that Amanda was here.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,040
Glad that I can help.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,000
My mum and I talked

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,000
She won't let me see you outside
the school for a while.

8
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,230
And I need to get a job

9
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,420
to be more muture and responsible.

10
00:00:15,677 --> 00:00:17,460
I am lazy.
My work ethic does suck,

11
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:18,678
and I really don't care about school

12
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:20,272
Don't expect me to ride shotgun

13
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:22,501
on your "woe is me" interstate.

14
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:23,633
You're smart, and you know it.

15
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:26,752
So get off your ass and
start making something of yourself.

16
00:00:26,886 --> 00:00:28,410
I know that box is still
very important to him.

17
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:29,780
I don't think Kyle would
want you to handle it.

18
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:32,420
Do you know why it's important
to him? Because I do.

19
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:35,942
You have no idea about what
Kyle and I share with each other.

20
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:38,060
I know you don't know him
as well as you think.

21
00:00:38,426 --> 00:00:41,022
The way you've crossed boundaries,
mixing your personal

22
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:43,622
and your professional life,
shows an alarming lack of judgment.

23
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:45,210
I have big plans
for you, Jessi,

24
00:00:45,507 --> 00:00:48,821
and I need you to be as strong
and as smart as you can possibly be.

25
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:50,512
I need to focus
on my family right now.

26
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:52,201
Brian said that you'd be like this.

27
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:53,702
He said I couldn't count on you.

28
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:55,990
- Why would he say that?
- You keep sending me away.

29
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:57,862
I'm finally comfortable
with where we are.

30
00:00:58,277 --> 00:01:00,003
- Which is?
- Friends.

31
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:01,753
- Friends.
- Without benefits.

32
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:02,823
Brutal.

33
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:04,380
If there's ever anything

34
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:06,483
you want to tell me,
I hope you know you can.

35
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:07,870
I do know that.

36
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:22,510
All right. I think it's time we take
your training wheels off.

37
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:23,743
You ready?

38
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:25,853
I just want to go over the milk
to espresso ratio...

39
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:26,960
Forget the cheat sheet.

40
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:29,512
Just shadow me.
You'll get the hang of it.

41
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:31,022
How's the rookie?

42
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:33,103
- Okay, I guess.
- Eh, you'll be fine.

43
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:35,413
I mean, if Josh can do it...

44
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:36,861
- Nice.
- Sundays are slow.

45
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,050
It's a good day to,
you know, ease into it.

46
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:43,003
Okay, this cash register
can get a little complicated.

47
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,511
You could put a rover
on mars with this thing.

48
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:50,023
Anyways, we start with 200 bucks
in the till to make change.

49
00:01:50,556 --> 00:01:52,092
We take the drawer out of
the safe in the mornings,

50
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:54,103
and at the end of the day,
we add up all the sales

51
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:56,032
and put it back in the safe
for the next day.

52
00:01:57,206 --> 00:01:57,960
Got it.

53
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:00,240
And here you go.

54
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:05,022
Am I too late?

55
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:08,213
- For?
- I want to be your first.

56
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:11,100
Uh, being somebody's first

57
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:13,053
can mean something
completely different.

58
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:18,310
I want to be your first customer.

59
00:02:18,617 --> 00:02:19,450
I knew what you meant.

60
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:26,142
- Is this what you need?
- Oh, thanks.

61
00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:33,200
Now, what can I get for you, sir?

62
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:35,942
I'll have a pineapple orange
banana smoothie.

63
00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:45,092
I must have hit the wrong button.

64
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,652
- No, I don't want kiwi!
- Kiwi sounds good.

65
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:51,733
- Really?
- I love kiwi.

66
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,212
Now how I take the strawberry off?

67
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:57,353
I want strawberry, too.

68
00:02:57,706 --> 00:02:59,591
Kyle, if you keep changing
your order to cover for me,

69
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:01,011
I'll never learn
how to do this right.

70
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:02,743
Kiwi-strawberry, that's my order.

71
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:05,031
- Promise?
- promise.

72
00:03:06,127 --> 00:03:07,100
Except there's lime on here, too.

73
00:03:07,306 --> 00:03:08,420
Lime makes all the difference.

74
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:09,992
Promise?

75
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:11,113
Promise.

76
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:14,491
Is this like some lame ritual
you guys have?

77
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:16,541
Cause I promise that I'm about to puke.

78
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,752
Keep it professional.

79
00:03:18,486 --> 00:03:20,763
I am. I'm working. Kyle's a customer.

80
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:28,261
Listen, I got to take off
for a few hours,

81
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:30,301
so you're in charge.

82
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:32,950
I am? I mean, are you sure?

83
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:34,442
It's just me and Amanda,
and she's new.

84
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:37,312
Yeah. Relax. Nothing
ever happens on sunday.

85
00:03:58,127 --> 00:03:59,242
"Nothing ever happens on sunday."

<b>Kyle XY - 2x18
Between The Rack and a Hard Place</b>

89
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:13,800
I don't want you
to see Kyle anymore.

90
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:17,793
- Why?
- I'm just not convinced

91
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:19,403
that he has your
best interests in mind.

92
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:23,583
But he's the only one that
understands what it's like to be me.

93
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:26,101
But he doesn't believe in you.

94
00:04:27,078 --> 00:04:27,882
Not the way that I do.

95
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:30,780
And the others, Latnok, they...

96
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:34,773
They just don't think
you're as good as Kyle.

97
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:38,033
But they're wrong, okay?
You can be better.

98
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:41,822
See, they don't see your potential,
and neither does Kyle.

99
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:43,352
Or he won't.

100
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:46,092
I mean, if he acknowledges
how special you are,

101
00:04:46,378 --> 00:04:49,752
then somehow it makes him
less special.

102
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:51,830
He's always helped me.

103
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:55,353
Has he... always helped you?

104
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:57,340
I mean, it seems that
he's pushing you away.

105
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:02,802
I am the only person who will
always be there for you.

106
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:05,261
Whenever you need me.

107
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:08,091
Just you and me.

108
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:25,943
You should probably take
the seed out of the avocado

109
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:27,583
before you put it in
the smoothie machine.

110
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:29,461
Should've known.

111
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:33,030
I thought they were
just really big limes.

112
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:35,263
Okay, so I'm not that great with fruit.

113
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:37,162
At least you know
an avocado is a fruit.

114
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:38,820
Most people think it's a vegetable.

115
00:05:39,618 --> 00:05:40,650
Tell that to the smoothie machine.

116
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,121
Amanda, we got customers.
Look alive, okay?

117
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:45,113
I'm on it.

118
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:48,873
I can't help it if all I want
to do is be alone with you.

119
00:05:54,348 --> 00:05:55,600
You really do sound like the manager.

120
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,820
Think I should make the other
employees call me "the man"?

121
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:02,423
Anyway, I've got
my eye on a big, fat raise.

122
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:04,943
So if I have to crack
the whip a little...

123
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:07,381
I'm glad I'm not one of your employees.

124
00:06:07,518 --> 00:06:08,752
Then technically, you're loitering.

125
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:21,502
Jessi. Hi.
You here for Kyle?

126
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:25,501
Do you think maybe we could talk?

127
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:27,800
You know, like we used to.

128
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:29,250
Jessi, I don't...

129
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,552
I mean, I'm not your therapist anymore.

130
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:35,433
Can't we just talk as friends?

131
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:37,792
I'm not sure that's appropriate.

132
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:40,321
Why?

133
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:43,880
Well, there are ethical boundaries,
and it's just...

134
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,441
Better if we maintain them.

135
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:54,033
I think Kyle's at the Rack
if you need to talk to him.

136
00:06:57,766 --> 00:06:58,460
Okay.

137
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:03,460
Good-bye.

138
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:06,360
Bye.

139
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:20,613
What's a girl got to do
to get some service around here?

140
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,303
Well, you can start with the manager.

141
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:24,451
What happened to J.T.?

142
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:26,221
He put me in charge for a few hours.

143
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:27,880
Brave man.

144
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:31,468
Aren't you forgetting something?

145
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:34,092
Oh, sorry.

146
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:37,631
Um, sweet, but no.

147
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:41,912
Money? Cow Keys tickets?

148
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,260
On sales today.

149
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:44,733
Oh, right.

150
00:07:45,477 --> 00:07:47,481
Fork it over.
Mama needs some green.

151
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:48,613
Are you sure you're up to this?

152
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:50,700
I thought you'd be too chemo'ed out
to wait in line for tickets.

153
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:53,022
Please. My last chemo was,
like, two days ago.

154
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:55,022
Puking is, like, so yesterday...

155
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:56,960
And last night.

156
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:59,681
I can't believe I'm paying
120 bucks for concertickets.

157
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,072
- Am I not worth it?
- You are, but the band?

158
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:03,921
Fine. We won't go.

159
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:05,252
But then these...

160
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:06,510
Are off-limits.

161
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:08,913
You're giving me an ultimatum?

162
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:11,133
Sometimes it's the only thing
guys will respond to.

163
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,182
So either I pay for
overpriced concert tickets...

164
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,383
Or the only rack you'll be
seeing is the one

165
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,701
that makes you wear
that stupid apron.

166
00:08:19,337 --> 00:08:20,101
Fine.

167
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:22,301
Yielding to the power of the boob.

168
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,283
And you just lived to feel me up
another day.

169
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:32,701
Don't tell me Josh

170
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,192
roped you into minimum wage hell.

171
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,851
Actually, I'm not getting paid.

172
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:40,862
Looks like the job does have its perks.

173
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:46,280
She said all she want to do
is to be alone with me.

174
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,463
Looks like your guys are about to take
the next step in your relationship.

175
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:51,230
What's the next step?

176
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:54,843
I think things are about to get
a little bit more hands-on.

177
00:08:57,715 --> 00:09:01,543
As on hands on butts,
hands on boobs.

178
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:06,700
Don't you want to move beyond
the hugs and no-tongue kisses?

179
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:11,361
Well, I know that
when I'm with her, I...

180
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,822
You get like you did
that day at the pool.

181
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,293
I can't help it.

182
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:20,980
Kyle, that's a good thing.

183
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:22,543
It's totally natural.

184
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:26,063
I'm just not sure Amanda's ready
to take the next step.

185
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:27,663
Kyle?

186
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:29,880
Could you help me in the storage
room for a minute?

187
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:31,423
Sure.

188
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,171
You were saying?

189
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:39,311
Go. Go.

190
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:42,701
Yes.

191
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:49,442
How can I help?

192
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:51,241
The protein powder. Top shelf.

193
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:52,540
I can't reach it.

194
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:56,711
Thanks.

195
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:01,941
Is that it?

196
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:04,350
For now.

197
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:07,303
Were you expecting something else?

198
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:10,833
Lori thought you asked me in here to...

199
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:15,783
No.

200
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:17,483
But I kind of wish
I'd thought of that.

201
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:20,360
That's okay. I'm glad I could help.

202
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:21,770
Kyle...

203
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,153
Thank you.

204
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:38,110
You know, this storage room
is our only chance of privacy,

205
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:39,871
at least until my mom cools down.

206
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:41,732
When will that be?

207
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:43,492
It's hard to tell.

208
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:45,910
I think she just needs
to get to know you better.

209
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:49,640
I do, too.

210
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:52,042
But you already know me.

211
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:53,563
Yeah, but...

212
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:55,720
Now that we're together,

213
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,253
I feel like there's so much
I still don't know about you.

214
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:04,151
And I want to know everything.

215
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:26,860
Small cappuccino, decaf... whatever.

216
00:11:30,668 --> 00:11:31,450
Where have you been?

217
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:32,642
It's a madhouse.

218
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:35,941
- Sorry.
- Just go wipe the tables.

219
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:43,863
I thought sunday was a slow day.

220
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:45,182
Yeah, somebody forgot to tell them.

221
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,001
Can I help?

222
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:50,771
Raise your right hand.

223
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:56,683
Do you solemnly swear to uphold
the principles of the Rack

224
00:11:56,878 --> 00:11:58,390
and not do anything
that will get me fired

225
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:00,171
and/or sued for labor law violations,

226
00:12:00,326 --> 00:12:01,221
so help you, Josh?

227
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:03,502
- What?
- I'm deputizing you.

228
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:04,860
- Just say yes.
- Yes.

229
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,351
Okay, Amanda's still
new at the register,

230
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:08,341
so keep an eye on her.

231
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:11,031
And fix the blender ASAP.
Can you multi-task?

232
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,262
Right. Stupid question.

233
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:16,281
Any questions that aren't stupid?

234
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:17,622
Do I get a badge?

235
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:20,760
You get an apron.

236
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:26,790
I don't think the smoothie
machine is that damaged.

237
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:27,562
Speaking of damaged...

238
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:35,041
Hi, Jessi.

239
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,221
Do you work here now?

240
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:40,960
Special circumstances.
I'm just helping out.

241
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,100
I could give you a hand.

242
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:46,671
Uh, that's okay.
I think I can manage.

243
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,161
The ground wire's not supposed
to run back to the motor.

244
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:58,060
You're right.

245
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,080
Does it bother you that I am?

246
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,280
No, I'm glad you pointed it out.

247
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:08,541
Well, I was wonderg if...
if maybe we could talk.

248
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:11,001
Um, but if this a bad time, I could...

249
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:11,963
Oh, no, no, no.

250
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:13,112
Just hang out for a couple minutes.

251
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:15,281
I'll get you some coffee,
and then we can talk.

252
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:17,011
Promise?

253
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:19,542
Yeah.

254
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:28,640
Easy, there, Lady Macbeth.

255
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:32,093
You've been scrubbing that same spot
for quite some time now.

256
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:35,120
I hate to be the jealous girl,
but I just...

257
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:36,441
I don't like seeing them together.

258
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:40,912
Yeah, you've got that "my boyfriend's
with another woman" expression.

259
00:13:41,126 --> 00:13:41,931
What does that look like?

260
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,461
Probably a lot like mine right now.

261
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:55,112
Except he's not your boyfriend.

262
00:13:58,926 --> 00:13:59,952
You're absolutely right.

263
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:02,761
He's a free agent.
We both are.

264
00:14:05,048 --> 00:14:07,270
There is no reason at all
why it should bother me.

265
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:09,382
But it does.

266
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:11,572
Nope.

267
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:16,253
I'll prove it.

268
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:33,871
- I'm Lori.
- Kenzie.

269
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:36,850
And, uh, I'm a little confused.

270
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,430
What? I'm just stopping by
to see my friend.

271
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:43,960
Your friend?

272
00:14:45,557 --> 00:14:47,121
Aren't we? friends?

273
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:50,100
I'll see you later.

274
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:51,440
No, no, no.
You don't have to go.

275
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,902
I think I do.

276
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:57,902
Thank you for that.

277
00:14:58,218 --> 00:14:59,261
I was trying to be friendly.

278
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:01,061
Yeah, well, don't try so hard.

279
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:02,152
Excuse me?

280
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:03,942
Friends want other friends to be happy.

281
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:05,980
You want me to be miserable and pining.

282
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:07,933
That is so unfair.

283
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,401
My point exactly.

284
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:20,972
That did not just happen.

285
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:21,890
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:22,476 --> 00:15:23,181
You should be.

287
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,023
Holding the door would get you, what,
kicked out of the ass hat society?

288
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:29,882
Maybe you can put in
a good word for me

289
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:31,201
at the psycho bitch league.

290
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:34,220
Tell you what,
let's settle this out of court.

291
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:35,421
Let me buy you a coffee.

292
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:40,032
<i>Yeah, forget it.</i>

293
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,170
<i>Like you're ever gonna get that.</i>

294
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:42,541
<i>Should be free by now.</i>

295
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:45,291
<i>I asked for no whipped cream.</i>

296
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:47,961
<i>Let's go somewhere else.</i>

297
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,242
Sorry.

298
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:00,460
<i>Should be free by now.</i>

299
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,061
I didn't want milk in this.

300
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,083
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you did.

301
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:08,343
Obviously, but I didn't.

302
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:09,721
My mistake.

303
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:11,493
Actually, sir, you did order milk.

304
00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:12,780
Honey, hang on.

305
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:14,513
What did you say?

306
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:17,422
You ordered a half-caf double
espresso with skim milk.

307
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:20,113
And then you asked somebody on the
phone, "Honey, do you want anything?"

308
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,430
and I'm assuming they said no,
because you only ordered the one drink.

309
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:25,131
Sir, we'll fix your order right away.

310
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:26,001
Not a problem.

311
00:16:28,816 --> 00:16:30,102
Just give him what he wants.

312
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:31,292
But he's wrong.

313
00:16:31,786 --> 00:16:32,751
The customer is always right.

314
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:35,302
It's an expression.

315
00:16:36,438 --> 00:16:37,471
I don't get it.

316
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:39,813
Uh, it doesn't matter if he's wrong,

317
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:41,023
you have to let him think he's right,

318
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:42,533
or he'll just take
his business somewhere else.

319
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:44,463
It's my first day

320
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:45,972
and I really can't afford
to lose customers,

321
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,070
so just trust me on this.

322
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:49,003
The customer is always right,
even when they're wrong.

323
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:51,283
- Yes.
- Every customer?

324
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,362
Everyone.

325
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:17,342
Crap.

326
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:18,883
I lost count again...

327
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:20,913
Here.

328
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,830
$397.

329
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,812
You did not seriously
just count that.

330
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:32,121
Do you need serial numbers, too?

331
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,723
Since when did the smart guy
become a smart-ass?

332
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:38,012
Wait, how much
did you say was in there?

333
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:39,701
$397.

334
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:42,383
That's not right.

335
00:17:42,555 --> 00:17:44,611
There's supposed to be
570 bucks and change in here.

336
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:47,991
- So...
- We're short 120 bucks.

337
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:55,213
Josh, I was really careful
with the register.

338
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:56,793
Yeah, when you were at the register.

339
00:17:57,696 --> 00:17:59,500
You left it and took off
with Kyle in the storage room.

340
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,120
Anybody could have had
their hand in the till.

341
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,073
But, Josh, it could have happened
anytime during the day.

342
00:18:04,437 --> 00:18:06,090
Including the time you guys
were busy making out.

343
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:10,091
I hope your little
rendez-vous was worth it.

344
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:28,501
Same count.

345
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:29,620
Great.

346
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:31,493
We were only gone for a minute.

347
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:33,203
2 minutes and 49 seconds, actually.

348
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:40,483
Maybe there's another explanation.

349
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:43,103
Okay, full disclosure.

350
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:45,212
120 bucks is the exact amount

351
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,652
I gave to Andy for
the Cow Keys tickets.

352
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:48,590
But I've been saving up
for weeks to get those tickets.

353
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:50,080
Josh, no one thinks you
stole the money.

354
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:52,840
Good. So let's get back to
blaming you and Amanda.

355
00:18:53,347 --> 00:18:54,371
It must have been a customer.

356
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:56,000
Maybe Jessi.

357
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:57,593
Jessi?

358
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,281
She probably did it to make me
look bad on my first day.

359
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:01,991
No, she couldn't have done it.

360
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,350
Right.
Jessi would never do that.

361
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:06,911
I mean, she beat up Lori
and took her necklace,

362
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:08,351
but she'd never steal any money.

363
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:15,630
Hey, you still gotta fix this.

364
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:18,371
It'll give J.T. one less thing
to fire me for.

365
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:19,961
You really think he'll fire you

366
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:21,161
because the money's missing?

367
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:22,372
Right after he fires Amanda.

368
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:24,080
So unless you can what happened,

369
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:26,052
we're both doomed.

370
00:19:33,017 --> 00:19:34,082
I spent most of my job

371
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,453
trying to get kids to open up.

372
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,253
Right? Then one of them shows up,

373
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:38,420
crying out for my help.

374
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:40,170
I practically slam
the door in her face.

375
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:42,312
Look, I know it's a tough situation,

376
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:44,411
but you just got slammed
by that social worker.

377
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:46,052
You can't be Jessi's sounding board.

378
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:47,242
She's a former patient.

379
00:19:47,516 --> 00:19:48,410
Well, I can't just ignore her.

380
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,430
You have to.
They're watching you now.

381
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:51,832
Well, it's wrong.

382
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:53,570
That's not the point.

383
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:56,163
Your license is at risk.

384
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:58,441
You can't jeopardize
your career over this.

385
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:01,282
What's the point of my career?

386
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:12,200
How's your first day going?

387
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:14,023
Not great actually.

388
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:15,821
Someone stole money out
of the register.

389
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:18,483
You think I did it.

390
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:19,761
I wouldn't put it past you.

391
00:20:20,848 --> 00:20:21,603
I'm not a thief.

392
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:24,010
Lori's necklace notwithstanding.

393
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:25,663
I gave that back.

394
00:20:26,168 --> 00:20:27,923
Great. Now give back the money.

395
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:29,200
I didn't take it.

396
00:20:31,278 --> 00:20:32,861
You may have everyone fooled.

397
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:34,552
Even Kyle.

398
00:20:35,656 --> 00:20:37,031
But I know what you're really about.

399
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:39,791
You don't know anything.

400
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:41,910
Maybe I should call your mom again

401
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,722
and tell her that you're here
hanging out with Kyle.

402
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:09,623
What are you doing?

403
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:11,220
What does it look like?

404
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:13,821
Opening drink bottles
and not drinking them.

405
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:16,370
I'm trying to make up
for the missing $120.

406
00:21:19,356 --> 00:21:21,252
The drink company's doing
a prize giveaway game.

407
00:21:21,736 --> 00:21:23,580
Check under certain bottle caps,
and you can win cash.

408
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:25,180
One in twenty is a winner.

409
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:26,233
How much have you won so far?

410
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,900
One free drink and a t-shirt.

411
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:30,731
But we sold eight drinks today,

412
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:31,963
And nobody's won cash.

413
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:33,530
The odds are one in twenty,

414
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:35,042
So if I open twelve more bottles...

415
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,040
It doesn't work that way.

416
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:37,822
The odds are one in twenty

417
00:21:37,987 --> 00:21:39,552
for all the bottles produced
by the drink company,

418
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:41,452
not just for the bottles
that are in this case.

419
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,772
One in twenty odds

420
00:21:45,258 --> 00:21:48,220
that means that each bottle's
a 95% chance of not being a winner.

421
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:50,153
So if the drink company puts
out billion bottles,

422
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:52,161
950,000 of them are not winners.

423
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:53,972
That's a lot of losers.

424
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:55,892
And even if you do find a winning cap,

425
00:21:56,156 --> 00:21:57,352
you still have to pay
for all these bottles.

426
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:00,503
Yeah, you're right.

427
00:22:01,128 --> 00:22:02,862
Sorry, I lost my mind
for a second there.

428
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,160
Is that all for you?

429
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:08,022
Oh, I'll get one of these, too, please.

430
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:10,151
That's $4.00.

431
00:22:14,147 --> 00:22:15,492
Oh, my God! I won 50 bucks!

432
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:17,703
Thank you so much.

433
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,241
<i>I can't believe it!
I wasn't even gonna buy that!

434
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:39,401
You!

435
00:22:41,015 --> 00:22:42,693
- Hey.
- Get away from me.

436
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:44,731
- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Stay away from me!

437
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:50,840
- Lori!
- Dad, he tried to attack me!

438
00:22:53,648 --> 00:22:55,482
- Mr. Trager?
- Mark?

439
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:56,711
Mark?

440
00:22:59,115 --> 00:23:00,011
I got those papers you wanted.

441
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,322
I can explain the coffee stains.

442
00:23:03,277 --> 00:23:04,010
You know him?

443
00:23:05,336 --> 00:23:06,261
He's my T.A.

444
00:23:11,627 --> 00:23:12,690
No, J.T., everything's cool.

445
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:14,353
All right, see you soon.

446
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:17,790
He'll be back in an hour.

447
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:20,892
I'm screwed.

448
00:23:21,807 --> 00:23:22,952
Is this even close to working?

449
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:24,563
I have to boost te motor's power,

450
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:25,483
but to do that...

451
00:23:25,547 --> 00:23:26,403
Don't explain, just fix it.

452
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,170
- Hey, I've been waiting.
- I know.

453
00:23:31,307 --> 00:23:32,160
You said we could talk.

454
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:34,561
It's a little crazy right now.

455
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:36,062
You promised.

456
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:39,352
Are you going to turn me away again?

457
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:40,752
Josh needs my help.

458
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:41,901
Can you give me a little more time?

459
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:47,682
No.

460
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:49,763
Jessi! Jessi!

461
00:23:52,435 --> 00:23:53,200
Let her go.

462
00:23:55,255 --> 00:23:56,401
Why is that so hard?

463
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,082
What makes her so important?

464
00:23:58,726 --> 00:24:00,090
She said she had
something to talk about.

465
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:01,900
Kyle, Jessi is not your problem.

466
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,201
I love that you assume
the best in people,

467
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:05,263
but enough is enough.

468
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:07,420
Aside from everything else she's done,

469
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:09,440
she is the one who ratted
me out to my mom.

470
00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:11,723
How do you know that?

471
00:24:12,138 --> 00:24:13,052
She admitted it.

472
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:14,613
She is so mapulative.

473
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:16,860
She lies, and then she throws
it back in your face.

474
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,723
She makes me so uncomfortable.

475
00:24:21,825 --> 00:24:23,252
I know it's not the same thing, but...

476
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:25,683
How would you feel if I said

477
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:27,153
I wanted to keep hanging out
with Charlie?

478
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:31,063
I guess I never
thought of it that way.

479
00:24:31,247 --> 00:24:32,293
I know.

480
00:24:49,677 --> 00:24:50,552
Excuse me.

481
00:25:00,287 --> 00:25:01,003
What have you done?

482
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:03,490
What you asked.
I'm fixing the smoothie machine.

483
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:04,872
With a grenade?

484
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:06,103
The blades were damaged,

485
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:08,901
so the machine was too
inefficient to blend the juice.

486
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:10,422
But by boosting the motor's power,

487
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:11,303
we can compensate.

488
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:13,692
Unfortunately, that means
rewiring the electrical system.

489
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:15,381
I'm a dead man.

490
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:18,622
Someone just sprayed graffiti
in the bathroom.

491
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:22,701
"For a good time,
call Dava Vina 535..."

492
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:23,730
I know the number.

493
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:28,591
What's going on?

494
00:25:29,718 --> 00:25:31,121
The switch machine's motor is broken

495
00:25:31,287 --> 00:25:32,000
so until I fix it...

496
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:33,502
No, I mean with you and Amanda.

497
00:25:34,537 --> 00:25:35,431
You guys are fighting?

498
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,603
She doesn't want me
to be around Jessi.

499
00:25:39,827 --> 00:25:41,442
Amanda doesn't have to know
you're hanging out with her.

500
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:42,793
I won't lie to her.

501
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:46,222
Then try the four magic words.

502
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:48,791
"You're right.
I'm sorry."

503
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:50,053
I should apologize,

504
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:51,743
even though I don't think
I've done anything wrong?

505
00:25:52,027 --> 00:25:52,723
Hell, yes.

506
00:25:53,578 --> 00:25:55,763
Sometimes you gotta
let them be right,

507
00:25:56,548 --> 00:25:57,632
even though you know they're wrong.

508
00:25:58,447 --> 00:25:59,781
Or they'll take their
business somewhere else.

509
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:02,253
What?

510
00:26:02,548 --> 00:26:03,523
The customer's always right.

511
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,313
Uh, yeah, something like that.

512
00:26:08,048 --> 00:26:10,302
I'm telling you, those four little
words are an instant cure.

513
00:26:11,297 --> 00:26:12,272
Your fight's over.

514
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,022
You can move right on
to the makeup sex...

515
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:18,903
Or in your case, makeup hugs.

516
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:38,723
Water seems to be working.
I'll go find some eyedrops.

517
00:26:40,378 --> 00:26:41,833
Well, look at the bright side.

518
00:26:42,128 --> 00:26:44,370
I think the pepper spray got the
coffee stain out of your shirt.

519
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,700
Yeah, and that's a real priority now.

520
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:48,072
Hey, I said I was sorry.

521
00:26:49,405 --> 00:26:50,461
Can I ask you a personal question?

522
00:26:50,947 --> 00:26:52,530
I suppose you're entitled to one.

523
00:26:53,497 --> 00:26:54,753
Why are you so angry?

524
00:26:55,538 --> 00:26:56,952
Um, let me see.

525
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,722
I guess it all started when you
let the door hit me in the face.

526
00:26:59,907 --> 00:27:00,721
Unintentionally.

527
00:27:00,928 --> 00:27:02,262
You branded me a callous jerk

528
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:03,452
without proper provocation.

529
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:04,743
Well, when it comes down to it,

530
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,190
aren't you all callous jerks?

531
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:07,402
Oh, I see.

532
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,373
So some guy did you wrong,

533
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:09,973
and I'm the one who
gets pepper sprayed.

534
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:11,643
Aren't you insightful?

535
00:27:11,948 --> 00:27:12,823
Oh, so I'm right?

536
00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:15,911
No, you're arrogant and conceited.

537
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:17,560
And you're bitter and hostile.

538
00:27:18,275 --> 00:27:19,780
Are you sure you don't
want a second spray?

539
00:27:19,955 --> 00:27:20,893
I'd be happy to oblige.

540
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,272
Man, I think you already
emptied the whole can.

541
00:27:26,008 --> 00:27:26,851
Don't count on it.

542
00:27:36,995 --> 00:27:37,770
I'm sorry I snapped.

543
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:39,823
The stress is really getting to me.

544
00:27:41,088 --> 00:27:42,023
I know it's been rough.

545
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:43,542
I thought I could handle it.

546
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:46,411
I mean, this job is the one
thing I'm good at,

547
00:27:46,585 --> 00:27:48,183
and I've totally screwed it up.

548
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:51,061
I've managed to double the power
to the smoothie machine.

549
00:27:51,788 --> 00:27:53,783
That's great, but
the money's still missing.

550
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:55,580
Can't you do something Kyle-like?

551
00:27:57,578 --> 00:27:59,020
I can access my holographic memory.

552
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,900
It lets me reexamine
past events from every angle.

553
00:28:02,868 --> 00:28:04,120
Oh, I thought you could
do something cool,

554
00:28:04,377 --> 00:28:05,322
like make money.

555
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:08,102
Okay, do your holodeck whatever thing.

556
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:27,543
<i>In replaying the day,
I once again saw

557
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,431
<i>every encounter with
disgruntled customers.

558
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:33,001
<i>It was a chaotic day where
nothing seemed to go right.

559
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:35,600
<i>Well, almost nothing.

560
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:39,163
<i>There was one thing that
made everything worthwhile.

561
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:41,013
You should probably take
the seed out of the avocado

562
00:28:41,185 --> 00:28:42,583
before you put it in
the smoothie machine.

563
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:44,923
<i>Amanda's reassuring touch.

564
00:28:46,188 --> 00:28:48,192
I can't help it if
all I wanna do is be alone with you.

565
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:49,733
<i>Her playful laugh.

566
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:51,941
Kyle?

567
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:54,350
Could you help me in
the storage room for a minute?

568
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:55,422
Sure.

569
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:58,250
<i>And most of all,
the sweetness of her kiss.

570
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,150
<i>These moments made all of
my other problems disappear.

571
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:05,791
Uh, being somebody's first

572
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:07,780
can mean something
completely different.

573
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:09,592
I want to be your first customer.

574
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:10,983
I knew what you meant.

575
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:16,513
Is this what you need?

576
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:17,821
Thanks.

577
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:22,360
<i>That was it.

578
00:29:30,796 --> 00:29:32,043
Well, what happened to the cash?

579
00:29:34,418 --> 00:29:35,402
It was never in the cash drawer.

580
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:37,220
What?

581
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:38,671
I replayed the day back
to the beginning.

582
00:29:40,198 --> 00:29:41,352
Right before Amanda took my order,

583
00:29:41,537 --> 00:29:42,613
I helped her with the cash drawer.

584
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:44,812
Each bill weighs one gram.

585
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:47,051
The drawer was nine grams too light.

586
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:49,152
Based on the levels of denominations,

587
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:53,502
it looked like four twenties,
three tens, and two fives were missing.

588
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:55,703
That's a total of $120
that was missing

589
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:57,612
before the cash was
even put in the register.

590
00:29:59,435 --> 00:30:01,672
A superhuman memory bank
with a built-in scale.

591
00:30:02,145 --> 00:30:03,022
Did you count the money in the drawer

592
00:30:03,227 --> 00:30:04,113
Before the start of the day?

593
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:07,761
Uh, no. I was training Amanda.

594
00:30:08,816 --> 00:30:09,700
J.T. counted it.

595
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:10,940
Maybe he made a mistake.

596
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:13,560
Yeah, blaming my boss,
that'll go over big.

597
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:18,170
It's okay. I'll take the heat for this.

598
00:30:18,647 --> 00:30:19,473
Amanda's in the clear.

599
00:30:20,196 --> 00:30:21,021
But it wasn't your fault.

600
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:22,540
That's what happens
when you're the man.

601
00:30:23,637 --> 00:30:25,401
I totally cancered my way
into front-row seats.

602
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:26,632
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hi.

603
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,661
FYI,
I implied you had cancer, too.

604
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:30,820
So we might have to shave your head.

605
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:33,542
It's a fitting end to a horrible day.

606
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:34,362
What happened?

607
00:30:35,095 --> 00:30:36,990
There's 120 bucks missing
from the cash register.

608
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:38,263
I'm totally fired.

609
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,300
Well, if J.T. busts you for that,

610
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:41,580
you can bust him for playing hooky.

611
00:30:43,546 --> 00:30:45,882
I saw him in line for
the Cow Keys tickets.

612
00:30:46,848 --> 00:30:48,473
Tickets that cost $120.

613
00:30:53,796 --> 00:30:55,691
J.T. took the money
to buy concert tickets?

614
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:57,283
Doesn't make sense.

615
00:30:57,646 --> 00:30:59,121
He'd know the register
would come up short.

616
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,160
He'd get caught.

617
00:31:00,378 --> 00:31:01,371
That's why he put you in charge.

618
00:31:01,587 --> 00:31:02,323
You're his fall guy.

619
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,720
That bastard's gonna be
here any minute.

620
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:06,363
What do I do?

621
00:31:12,275 --> 00:31:13,553
Maybe I boosted the power too much.

622
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:17,223
You think?

623
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:19,873
You've got to be kidding me.

624
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:24,330
On the bright side,

625
00:31:24,598 --> 00:31:26,690
the missing money isn't the
first thing your boss will notice.

626
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:48,450
I'm sorry about the smoothie machine.

627
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:52,473
It's fine.

628
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:55,741
Amanda...

629
00:31:56,386 --> 00:31:58,562
I just wanted you to know that
Jessi didn't take the money,

630
00:31:58,767 --> 00:31:59,963
and it's not our fault either.

631
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:01,353
The manager stole it.

632
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:03,420
That's great.

633
00:32:10,946 --> 00:32:11,882
You're right. I'm sorry.

634
00:32:13,858 --> 00:32:14,620
What?

635
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:17,302
You're right. I'm sorry?

636
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,431
Does that mean you won't hang out
with Jessi anymore?

637
00:32:24,905 --> 00:32:26,123
Kyle, please tell me,

638
00:32:26,616 --> 00:32:27,761
why do you want to
be friends with her?

639
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:29,102
I mean, she's creepy
and she's strange

640
00:32:29,258 --> 00:32:30,091
and she beat up your sister,

641
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:33,061
yet everyone's apparently
fine with it.

642
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:34,413
I know it's hard to understand.

643
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,150
You have to trust me.

644
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:38,843
Trust you?

645
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:40,810
Haven't I been trusting enough?

646
00:32:43,357 --> 00:32:45,881
Go on Kyle and Jessi, it's okay,
stroke each other's bellies.

647
00:32:45,908 --> 00:32:47,842
Oh, and have a nice road trip,
and, hey, while you're gone,

648
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:49,710
is there a love song
I can play for the two of you?

649
00:32:50,957 --> 00:32:52,640
The problem isn't that
I don't trust you,

650
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:53,730
it's that you don't trust me.

651
00:32:54,517 --> 00:32:55,451
I trust you completely.

652
00:32:55,968 --> 00:32:56,721
Really?

653
00:32:57,937 --> 00:32:59,451
Then what's the due
with that weird box,

654
00:32:59,968 --> 00:33:01,900
the one I pulled out of
the underground death trap?

655
00:33:02,287 --> 00:33:03,830
The one you almost got
yourself killed for?

656
00:33:07,658 --> 00:33:09,180
Jessi knows what it is, doesn't she?

657
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:11,990
Amanda...

658
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:13,980
You can trust her with
your secrets and not me,

659
00:33:14,897 --> 00:33:15,731
and until you can do that,

660
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:18,553
maybe I'm the one you shouldn't
be hanging out with.

661
00:33:30,406 --> 00:33:31,922
It's a total no-win situation.

662
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:35,713
If I say I don't know what
happened to the money,

663
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:37,780
I'm fired.

664
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:41,843
If I tell J.T. I know he stole it,

665
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:42,942
but can't prove it,

666
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:45,603
then it's his word
against mine, and I'm fired.

667
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,161
If I don't tell Amanda secrets,

668
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:48,252
I risk losing her.

669
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:50,180
If I do tell her, I risk losing her.

670
00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:51,281
You don't know that.

671
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:53,140
Secrets ruined your
relationship with Lori.

672
00:33:53,655 --> 00:33:55,642
Openness and honesty hasn't
exactly worked either.

673
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:58,053
Let Amanda cool off,
maybe she'll be more reasonable.

674
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,520
That's the thing,
I think she is being reasonable.

675
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:02,330
How can we have a real relationship

676
00:34:02,497 --> 00:34:03,801
If she doesn't know
the whole truth about me?

677
00:34:04,797 --> 00:34:05,560
Then tell her.

678
00:34:05,966 --> 00:34:07,030
Then she'd know I'd been lying to her.

679
00:34:07,556 --> 00:34:08,290
She'll forgive you.

680
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:09,582
Like she forgave Charlie?

681
00:34:10,145 --> 00:34:11,093
That's different.

682
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:12,180
You lied to protect her.

683
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,660
Charlie lied to protect himself.

684
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:17,383
But what if she looks
at me differently?

685
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:19,671
What if she doesn't like
who I really am?

686
00:34:21,246 --> 00:34:22,913
Then I guess telling her
is one way to know

687
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:24,023
if you should really be together.

688
00:34:31,328 --> 00:34:32,080
Amanda!

689
00:34:35,586 --> 00:34:36,382
We need to talk.

690
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:38,841
Look, if you're going to break up
with me, please,

691
00:34:39,888 --> 00:34:41,220
don't draw it out, just do it quick.

692
00:34:42,488 --> 00:34:43,560
I'm not gonna break up with you.

693
00:34:46,825 --> 00:34:48,223
I need you in my life.

694
00:34:50,015 --> 00:34:51,403
I need you in every part of it.

695
00:34:55,036 --> 00:34:55,861
Okay.

696
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,663
So let's talk.

697
00:35:05,627 --> 00:35:06,760
Well, I guess I'll see you around.

698
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,013
I mean, once I can see again.

699
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,222
Well, watch your step
and I'll go easy on you.

700
00:35:12,186 --> 00:35:13,170
Declan.

701
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:14,361
Hey.

702
00:35:16,585 --> 00:35:17,330
I'll see you.

703
00:35:20,845 --> 00:35:21,603
Who was that?

704
00:35:22,556 --> 00:35:23,583
Some guy I pepper-sprayed.

705
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:25,591
Why did you do that?

706
00:35:26,695 --> 00:35:27,723
He pissed me off.

707
00:35:29,186 --> 00:35:29,900
I'm sensing a pattern.

708
00:35:31,306 --> 00:35:32,141
Oh, I see.

709
00:35:32,827 --> 00:35:34,073
You think I'm being irrational?

710
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:35,780
What about you,
mister all-up-in-arms

711
00:35:35,905 --> 00:35:37,550
when I say an innocent hello
to your new girlfriend?

712
00:35:38,018 --> 00:35:39,470
A, she's not my new girlfriend,

713
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:42,090
And b, your tone was hardly innocent.

714
00:35:42,945 --> 00:35:44,421
Oh, what was it then?

715
00:35:46,116 --> 00:35:47,900
Passive-aggressive mean
girl comes to mind.

716
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:51,773
You are so not-allowed to use
my own phrases against me.

717
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:52,932
Trager...

718
00:35:58,195 --> 00:35:59,142
You're right.

719
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:01,511
What?

720
00:36:01,897 --> 00:36:04,031
You're right. I'm sorry.

721
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:07,340
I'm totally not falling for that.

722
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:18,113
Hi, mom.

723
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:19,862
- Hey.
- Hello.

724
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,131
Mr. Taylor... Brian.

725
00:36:23,188 --> 00:36:24,302
It's Nicole Trager.

726
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:26,710
Yes?

727
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:28,041
Uh, I just wanted to let you know

728
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:29,642
I saw Jessi earlier.

729
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:30,873
And she seemed troubled,

730
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:32,872
and I tried to explain to her that

731
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,751
it's difficult for me
to talk to her now

732
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:36,431
since I'm not her therapist,

733
00:36:37,138 --> 00:36:40,682
but I want to let her know
that I do care about her.

734
00:36:41,886 --> 00:36:43,792
Well, I'm sure she'd be glad hear that.

735
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,341
She's just not in right now.

736
00:36:46,097 --> 00:36:48,471
<i>Oh, well could you let her know
that I called?</i>

737
00:36:48,936 --> 00:36:50,571
And please tell her that
I'm thinking about her.

738
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:52,433
Absolutely.

739
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:53,931
Thanks.

740
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:57,492
Who was that?

741
00:36:59,247 --> 00:37:00,280
Nobody.

742
00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:08,712
What's wrong?

743
00:37:10,415 --> 00:37:11,133
You were right.

744
00:37:12,616 --> 00:37:13,563
Kyle doesn't care.

745
00:37:15,158 --> 00:37:16,183
He won't even talk to me.

746
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:18,182
And neither will Nicole.

747
00:37:21,426 --> 00:37:22,222
I tried to explain.

748
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:24,423
They're not a family.

749
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:27,161
But I just want to be their friend,

750
00:37:27,368 --> 00:37:28,520
but they won't let me.

751
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:32,300
They're jealous.

752
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:34,751
You know what you're capable of,

753
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:36,480
but they don't want to see you succeed.

754
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:38,031
Not like I do.

755
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:50,503
I'm your father, Jess.

756
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:52,822
I will never let you down.

757
00:37:58,608 --> 00:37:59,363
The place is clean,

758
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:00,680
the smoothie machine is fixed,

759
00:38:02,268 --> 00:38:04,560
now if I could only find $120
lying around somewhere.

760
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:13,940
I scalped the Cow Keys tickets.

761
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:17,403
But I thought you were really

762
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:18,570
looking forward to seeing them live?

763
00:38:19,446 --> 00:38:21,153
No, I was really looking forward

764
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:22,453
to spending time with you.

765
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:33,672
So...

766
00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:35,003
How did it go?

767
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:36,792
No worries.

768
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:37,953
All right.

769
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:46,082
There's so much we don't know
about each other.

770
00:38:46,988 --> 00:38:47,720
Yeah.

771
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,773
And I want to know
everything about you.

772
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:52,892
I want to know everything
about you, too.

773
00:38:54,346 --> 00:38:55,503
But I think we should take it slow.

774
00:38:56,428 --> 00:38:57,602
Savor each new thing.

775
00:38:58,556 --> 00:38:59,353
One step at a time?

776
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:01,083
Exactly.

777
00:39:02,265 --> 00:39:02,960
So how about this?

778
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:05,921
I'll tell you something
you don't know about me,

779
00:39:06,665 --> 00:39:08,131
and then you tell me something
I don't know about you.

780
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:10,603
Yeah.

781
00:39:13,448 --> 00:39:14,340
Okay.

782
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,032
So that box you asked me about,

783
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:19,943
it belonged to someone
very close to me.

784
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:23,781
But you found that box underground.

785
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:25,121
Whose was it?

786
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:26,512
My biological father.

787
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:29,020
Your biological father?

788
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,021
A man named Adam Baylin.

789
00:39:33,577 --> 00:39:35,332
He worked in that facility
many years ago.

790
00:39:38,948 --> 00:39:39,812
I don't understand.

791
00:39:40,286 --> 00:39:41,262
It's okay.

792
00:39:41,926 --> 00:39:42,802
Eventually, you will.

793
00:39:44,398 --> 00:39:45,971
Now it's your turn.
Tell me something

794
00:39:46,158 --> 00:39:47,190
I don't already know about you.

795
00:39:49,356 --> 00:39:50,450
I really like kissing you.

796
00:39:51,276 --> 00:39:52,571
That doesn't count,
I already know that.

797
00:39:52,828 --> 00:39:54,351
I really, really like kissing you?

798
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:55,640
Sorry, I know that, too.

799
00:39:56,805 --> 00:39:58,043
My favorite ice cream flavor is...

800
00:39:58,265 --> 00:39:59,280
Double mint chip.

801
00:40:22,108 --> 00:40:23,260
Register balances out.

802
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:25,063
You sound surprised.

803
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:28,761
Oh, no. no, no.
Um, good work.

804
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:32,500
So, I got to take off,
so, cool.

805
00:40:33,046 --> 00:40:33,943
Don't forget to lock up.

806
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:35,741
Have fun at the Cow Keys concert.

807
00:40:37,857 --> 00:40:38,960
Those tickets are really expensive.

808
00:40:39,926 --> 00:40:42,153
What do they cost?
Like, 120 bucks?

809
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:46,853
Some people would do almost
anything to get those tickets.

810
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:49,581
I guess you really lucked out, huh?

811
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:53,322
Next time, you might not be so lucky.

812
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:01,991
With what you've got over him,

813
00:41:02,236 --> 00:41:04,033
I bet you get that raise
sooner rather than later.

814
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:06,041
Hush money.

815
00:41:06,068 --> 00:41:07,741
Or buy Andy something pretty money.

816
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:09,222
Has a better ring to it.

817
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:11,922
You know,
I may have given up our tickets,

818
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:14,070
but I was able to get
the next best thing.

819
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:19,032
The Cow Keys live in Gainesville?

820
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:21,243
When did this go on sale?

821
00:41:21,585 --> 00:41:23,713
It hasn't. Promo copy.

822
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:25,023
Doesn't go on sale for two weeks,

823
00:41:25,278 --> 00:41:26,620
but mama's got people
who know people.

824
00:41:29,247 --> 00:41:30,593
Yeah, I figured you'd want
to give it a listen.

825
00:41:32,137 --> 00:41:33,421
Only if we can listen to it together.

826
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:38,700
There's a CD player
in the storage room.

827
00:41:39,868 --> 00:41:41,151
Sounds like an ultimatum.

828
00:41:41,845 --> 00:41:44,113
Sometimes it's the only
thing girls will respond to.

829
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,363
Two years ago, I actually
went to band camp.

830
00:41:51,327 --> 00:41:52,362
I saw the photo on your wall.

831
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:55,242
At this rate I'll never learn
anything about you.

832
00:41:55,985 --> 00:41:57,583
Well, then I guess it
could take a while.

833
00:42:07,238 --> 00:42:09,193
You'd better get inside
before your mom sees us.

834
00:42:35,228 --> 00:42:36,103
Foss?

835
00:42:37,428 --> 00:42:38,652
Foss I got your message.

836
00:42:39,427 --> 00:42:40,720
It wasn't from Foss.

837
00:42:46,717 --> 00:42:47,441
Adam.

838
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:51,962
Hello, Kyle.
