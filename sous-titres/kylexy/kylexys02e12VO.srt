00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,733
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

2
00:00:02,088 --> 00:00:04,524
<i>When I knew that I would not
always be here to guide you,</i>

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,569
<i>I knew I'd need a way to communicate,</i>

4
00:00:06,692 --> 00:00:07,934
and more importantly...

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,540
<i>assure you that
you would never be alone.</i>

6
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:12,709
I wanna understand
why you think the way you do.

7
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:15,622
You don't wanna get inside my head.
It's a scary place.

8
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:17,249
I want you to read Andy's mind.

9
00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:19,247
I think I like her.

10
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,546
You make fun of me, you put me down,
you always have to have the last word.

11
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:24,295
I thought that was...

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,465
our thing.

13
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,025
We have a thing?

14
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:29,344
I got a letter from
this conservatory in New York.

15
00:00:29,703 --> 00:00:30,820
And I kinda got in.

16
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:33,557
- Admit it, now you're having doubts.
- I do have doubts.

17
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:36,108
- There's something I need to tell you--
- No!

18
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:37,955
I've doubts about
everything in my life...

19
00:00:38,147 --> 00:00:39,563
except how I feel about you.

20
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:41,607
<i>Madacorp sent some wicked-hot mentally</i>

21
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,071
scrambled science experiment
to invade your life.

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,055
Why?

23
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,307
I don't know.

24
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:49,356
<i>It's like they've been watching.</i>

25
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,918
Get her into their family's life.

26
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:55,913
<i>Destabilizing the boy's support
structure will make him more vulnerable.</i>

27
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:57,748
Her nutcase sister is
the one who hit me.

28
00:00:58,288 --> 00:00:59,875
There must be a logical explanation.

29
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:01,511
Whatever she did to Lori,

30
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:03,623
I don't think Jessi's
gonna flip out on Kyle.

31
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:05,291
I think I just read your mind.

32
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:06,987
My sister...

33
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:09,712
she shot me.

34
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:11,428
I think you should know something.

35
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:14,165
- What do you want?
- I wanna know who I really am.

36
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:15,474
Kyle, they said you--

37
00:01:17,804 --> 00:01:18,852
Just believe in me.

38
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,854
That's what Charlie always said.

39
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:26,635
I can't stress it strongly enough,
Captain.

40
00:01:26,814 --> 00:01:29,374
Jessi should be treated
as a psychiatric case...

41
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:30,939
not a criminal one.

42
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:34,950
Thank you.

43
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,816
I'm worried about Lori.

44
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:42,748
She's angry at...

45
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:46,509
Are you okay?

46
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:51,134
Times like this, when the professional
line blurs with the personal,

47
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:53,012
- it's...
- Difficult.

48
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,389
The hardest part is the guilt.

49
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:57,365
Guilt?

50
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,393
I'm the one who brought Jessi
into this house.

51
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:02,228
No.

52
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,345
You tried to help her.

53
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:06,691
Tried.

54
00:02:12,493 --> 00:02:13,735
What's the matter?

55
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:19,004
My head is...

56
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:27,421
I'm fine.

57
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:29,756
You need to get some rest.

58
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:31,654
You're exhausted.

59
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:34,344
We all are.

60
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:45,003
Why?

61
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:47,476
I'm too riled up to sleep.

62
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,284
Therefore I don't get to sleep either?

63
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:53,714
I spent all night scheming
revenge against Jessi.

64
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:57,031
- And what did you come up with?
- Nothing good.

65
00:02:57,863 --> 00:03:00,134
I need a diabolical mind in my corner.

66
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:03,667
And I'm said diabolical mind?

67
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:04,879
Exactly.

68
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:06,427
Good morning, guys.

69
00:03:07,695 --> 00:03:09,219
Dad, do me a solid.

70
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,382
Go downstairs and throw
some black into that pot.

71
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:15,295
Not quite sure what that meant,
but we'll go with no.

72
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:17,999
How you doing, Lori?

73
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,351
What do you think?

74
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:23,631
I'm gonna go.

75
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:31,201
Now, I know you've been
through a lot lately,

76
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:32,778
but your tone needs adjusting.

77
00:03:33,408 --> 00:03:36,698
Oh, so we're going with stern,
responsible dad now? That's rich.

78
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,456
I have dealt with your attitude
because I know you're angry.

79
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:42,116
I know you're confused,
you need to lash out against someone.

80
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:44,956
But don't you dare treat me
like I'm some peer

81
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:47,572
you can cut down with some snide
little comments.

82
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,045
I am your father. This stops now.

83
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:11,364
What are you doing?

84
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:12,813
Same thing as you.

85
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:15,117
Which is?

86
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:17,229
Pacing.

87
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:20,330
Continuous back-and-forth walking
in an effort to clear one's mind

88
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,894
for mental breakthrough.

89
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:23,173
I got that part.

90
00:04:23,702 --> 00:04:24,788
Why are you pacing?

91
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:27,810
Why are you?

92
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,997
There's some seriously toxic mojo
going down in this house, and I'm

93
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:32,575
looking for a solution.

94
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:35,397
Me, too.

95
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:38,009
Well, good. 'Cause I could use some

96
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:41,817
super brain enhancement to help Lori
figure out how to get revenge on Jessi.

97
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,973
Jessi?

98
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:46,877
Yeah. You know?

99
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,185
Brown hair, green eyes, 5 foot...

100
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:51,028
11 personalities.

101
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:53,613
I don't think
you should get involved in that.

102
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,634
Not get involved?

103
00:04:55,873 --> 00:04:56,972
Are you crazy?

104
00:04:57,271 --> 00:04:58,750
She deserves whatever we dish out.

105
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:00,763
There's a lot about her
that you don't know.

106
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,506
Dude, are you defending her?

107
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:04,138
- No, I...
- Whatever, man.

108
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:07,220
I thought Lori could rely
on her brothers to have her back.

109
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:24,823
My life was spinning out of control.

110
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,624
The Fallout of my secrets had brought
trouble into the lives

111
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,065
of the people I loved.

112
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:31,449
And I was powerless to stop it.

- Lockdown -

116
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:49,010
Hils, I'm talking hostile takeover
of Jessi's reputation.

117
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:53,068
Declan, things are falling apart and
I need help figuring out what to do.

118
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:54,501
I'm coming over.

119
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,225
Fire up that G-Force.
I need your mind working at it's best.

120
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:58,875
Hold on.

121
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:00,610
Where's everyone going?

122
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,995
- I gotta go see Hillary.
- I gotta go see Andy.

123
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:04,444
And I'm meeting Declan.

124
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:06,241
I don't think anyone should leave.

125
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:09,586
Jessi's still unaccounted for, and
we don't know what her state of mind is.

126
00:06:09,755 --> 00:06:12,062
Sure we do. Six ticks past psychotic.

127
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:14,325
Too much?

128
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,299
So... what, you're putting us
on lockdown?

129
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,541
Until further notice...

130
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:23,331
yes.

131
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,324
He survived.

132
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,049
Barely.

133
00:06:36,748 --> 00:06:39,850
His brain function is still intact.
No residual damage.

134
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:43,900
I'd say the chair's retrieval system
performed better than expected,

135
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,296
and I expected a lot.

136
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:47,556
You can't put Kyle in that chair.

137
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:49,554
Actually, I can.

138
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:54,020
At best you'll get 10 percent
of his data before you fry his brain.

139
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:56,189
I'd settle for one percent.

140
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:58,778
You called?

141
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:01,874
Where's the girl, Hollander?

142
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,293
In the field.

143
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:07,659
In other words,
your mission remains incomplete.

144
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,328
I'll give the girl one more day.

145
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:15,911
But if I don't get what I want,

146
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:18,712
I'm strapping the boy into the chair.

147
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:30,309
Okay...
I've called in the Andy reinforcements.

148
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:32,493
Two diabolical minds at your disposal.

149
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,769
- Forget it.
- Forget it?

150
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:37,359
Has your thirst for revenge
been quenched already?

151
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:38,505
Never.

152
00:07:39,295 --> 00:07:41,195
But I don't need to drag
you down with me.

153
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:43,112
I'm supposed to be your bad-ass brother,

154
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:45,357
ready to serve a beat down on command.

155
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,090
Go have fun with Andy.

156
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:50,715
You guys have better things to do
than get... caught up in all my drama.

157
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,157
Okay, but we'll just be
a room away from turning

158
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,083
our G-Force skills
into real-life mortal pain.

159
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:59,940
Yeah, that's sort of exactly why
I'm keeping you out of it.

160
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:02,819
Probably for the best.

161
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:12,815
Hillary.

162
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,459
Operation Vengeance in effect.

163
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,580
- I brought cookies.
- Thank God.

164
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:20,763
- Amanda.
- Is Kyle home?

165
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:29,330
I'm sorry I compared you to Charlie.

166
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,623
You don't need to be sorry for anything.

167
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:34,078
I'm the one who should apologize.

168
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,375
- It's just what I saw...
- Was confusing.

169
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:39,947
I know.

170
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:42,817
But I promise nothing
physical was going on.

171
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,873
I wouldn't lie to you.

172
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:46,625
I know you wouldn't.

173
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:50,220
And I do believe in you,
even if it doesn't seem like I should.

174
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:52,958
Thank you.

175
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:57,560
Maybe if you told me
why you were so drawn to her.

176
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:02,582
She's lost.

177
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,526
Troubled.

178
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,932
And you wanna help her?

179
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:15,370
This is what I get
for dating a do-gooder.

180
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,414
You're still mad.

181
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,484
This isn't what I came
over here to talk about.

182
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,878
What did you come over here
to talk about?

183
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,590
I'm leaving.

184
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:30,802
- You just got here.
- No, I mean I'm leaving town.

185
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:32,460
Leaving town?

186
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:34,394
For how long?

187
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:36,725
For the rest of the semester.

188
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:39,436
I got accepted to
a music program in New York.

189
00:09:41,884 --> 00:09:43,356
I leave in two days.

190
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:46,521
Two days?

191
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:49,824
Usually, the whole
multiple-question thing is cute,

192
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:51,384
but I'm really struggling here.

193
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:52,935
Why are you strug...

194
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:58,919
You're struggling because
you're not sure if you wanna go.

195
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:00,790
It's a dream come true, but...

196
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,654
You're afraid you're using it
as an excuse to run away...

197
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:05,890
because you have doubts about us.

198
00:10:07,746 --> 00:10:09,717
What do you think I should do?

199
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:22,187
I think it's your decision to make.

200
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:26,399
I'm just so confused.

201
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:31,112
I need to clear my head.

202
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:35,158
Don't bother with pacing.
It hasn't been working for me.

203
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:39,120
I'm gonna go play for a while.

204
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:43,666
See if I can figure it out.

205
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:55,315
Whatever you decide...

206
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,139
I'll be here for you.

207
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,767
Promise?

208
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:03,186
Promise.

209
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:05,563
Then I know it'll happen.

210
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:19,392
- Hello?
<i>- Kyle...</i>

211
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,288
Emily.

212
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:24,271
Yes.

213
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:26,462
<i>What do you want?</i>

214
00:11:28,294 --> 00:11:29,712
Jessi needs your help.

215
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:32,989
<i>She knows the truth about who
she really is, and she's run away.</i>

216
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:34,384
She's in danger huh?

217
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:36,566
Yes.

218
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:39,264
You're the only one who can
bring her home safely.

219
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,453
I can tell when people are lying.

220
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:44,811
<i>- I'm not lying.</i>
- Or telling the whole truth.

221
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,499
You want the truth?

222
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:50,024
If you don't find Jessi,
they'll hurt my family.

223
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:52,485
- Who are they?
<i>- You're in danger too,</i>

224
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:55,131
Kyle. You and everyone
who matters to you.

225
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:05,707
I'm gonna ruin her reputation.

226
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:09,085
You do it right, she'll be wearing
a Sacred Heart skirt by Friday.

227
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:11,322
How you doing, Lori?

228
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,061
I vow to kill the next person
that asks me that.

229
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,080
What are you doing here?

230
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,414
I... came to talk to Kyle.

231
00:12:20,593 --> 00:12:22,978
Oh, good. Maybe you can talk
some sense into him.

232
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:25,214
His whole "believe the best
in people" philosophy

233
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:29,171
has gotten way too close to Jessi
"spawn of the devil" Hollander.

234
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:32,400
Clearly you're not willing to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

235
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:34,937
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

236
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:36,966
I just meant that it's complicated.

237
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,573
Oh, my God.

238
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:41,910
This thing's messy enough already
without you two going haywire.

239
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:44,796
- She beat me up!
- I know that!

240
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:47,123
Then you understand
she deserves whatever she gets.

241
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:51,322
What is happening up there?

242
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:52,587
Lori's outta control.

243
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:53,880
She's just upset.

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,215
She's more than upset.
She's acting like a 12-year-old.

245
00:12:57,063 --> 00:12:58,509
What's going on between you two?

246
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,849
She thinks I'm having
an affair with Emily.

247
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,018
I think I was hoping
for a little more outrage.

248
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:10,438
It's not an outrageous assumption.

249
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,498
- It damn well is.
- Stephen.

250
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:14,758
I can't believe you would
even think for one minute...

251
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,654
No, I don't think that.
I just meant that Lori...

252
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:20,187
You're the psychologist.
Isn't the first reaction

253
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:22,116
- usually the most telling?
- Let me finish.

254
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:24,922
<i>- Please.
- I just meant that Lori has picked up</i>

255
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:26,648
<i>on the dynamic you have with Emily.</i>

256
00:13:26,768 --> 00:13:27,915
<i>She's my co-worker.</i>

257
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,944
<i>It's a little more than that.
Even I noticed it.</i>

258
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:33,331
<i>Real mature, Trager.</i>

259
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:36,965
<i>- Stephen, I'm trying to make a point.
- Which is?</i>

260
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:46,570
<i>There was no way I could help.</i>

261
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,289
<i>Nothing I could do.</i>

262
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,552
<i>More than anything, I wanted it to end.</i>

263
00:13:50,672 --> 00:13:52,325
<i>a total disconnect between you and me.</i>

264
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:53,914
<i>And then suddenly it did.</i>

265
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:09,998
Adam?

266
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:14,961
Is that really you?

267
00:14:16,498 --> 00:14:18,923
No. It's really you.

268
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,834
I don't understand.

269
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:24,385
You don't need to understand what I am.

270
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:26,681
Only that I can help you.

271
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,756
Thank God you're here.

272
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:33,019
You do realize that I went
out of my way to pimp out

273
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,504
my mom's media room
for our G-Force marathon.

274
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:37,438
I'm hoping this will make up for it.

275
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:39,027
Check it out.

276
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:40,775
What do you think?

277
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:42,302
It's perfect.

278
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:47,122
<i>Cover fire on the left flank!</i>

279
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:49,376
Especially for our last day together.

280
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:57,344
Hey, Kyle, I made it.

281
00:14:59,073 --> 00:15:00,445
Okay.

282
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:02,663
Guess I'll talk to you later.

283
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:07,013
Kyle...

284
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:09,921
you're upset because you think
all the anger

285
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,516
that's dividing this house
is because of you.

286
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:16,534
Madacorp obviously sent Jessi and Emily
into our lives to mess with me.

287
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:18,316
I just can't figure out why.

288
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:19,525
Well...

289
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,557
what do they want?

290
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:25,999
It has to be the information I took
from Zzyzx that's inside my head.

291
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:27,696
How far will they go to get it?

292
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,637
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

293
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,863
- Just tell me.
- I can't.

294
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,333
You need to slow down, Kyle...

295
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:37,031
and think.

296
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:41,751
I was able to get inside Jessi's head,

297
00:15:41,914 --> 00:15:43,080
read her thoughts.

298
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:46,177
Madacorp must believe that
she can get into mine.

299
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,793
But she hasn't.

300
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,347
Not yet.

301
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:51,388
Why?

302
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:56,185
I had to get her to trust me,
let her guard down before

303
00:15:56,324 --> 00:15:57,965
I was able to dig deep enough.

304
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:00,983
So then she's trying
to get you to trust her.

305
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,015
But all she and Emily have done
is cause chaos.

306
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,286
And how does that chaos make you feel?

307
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:08,699
Upset.

308
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:11,285
- Uncertain.
- Vulnerable?

309
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,342
It makes me feel like everything that's
important to me is gonna disappear.

310
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:18,543
When you're vulnerable,

311
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:20,628
you let your guard down.

312
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:22,964
Jessi.

313
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:25,463
No...

314
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:27,343
but it could have been.

315
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:29,776
I'm losing my mind.

316
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:32,807
Actually, you're just
beginning to find it.

317
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:38,551
Madacorp manipulated everything.

318
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:42,066
And my whole family has suffered for it.

319
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:45,111
So what does that say about Jessi?

320
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:47,955
She can't be trusted.

321
00:16:49,222 --> 00:16:50,931
She's bad like everyone said.

322
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,349
When Kyle wakes up,
will you tell him I was here?

323
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,427
Right, because I'm so in the mood
to be your messenger service.

324
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Trager...

325
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:04,880
For the love of Peter Petrelli,
will you two cut it out?

326
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:07,297
I have been a guest

327
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,548
at your pity party of two for months.

328
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:12,636
Wah wah, bicker bicker, boring boring.

329
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:15,451
Now, for the sake of my sanity,

330
00:17:15,763 --> 00:17:17,194
and your future children,

331
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,179
we're putting an end to this right now.

332
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:21,468
You two need a mediation.

333
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:23,910
I'm gonna go fetch our own
resident Dr. Phil.

334
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,522
Ah! I don't wanna hear it
from Kyle right now.

335
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:27,796
And he's asleep.

336
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:29,812
All righty, then.

337
00:17:29,936 --> 00:17:32,569
You'll have to temporarily
settle for second best.

338
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:34,906
Dr. Hils at your service.

339
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:37,004
Hils, I really don't think...

340
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,140
Sit!

341
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,641
Okay, I've had enough.

342
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:47,070
Hey,

343
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:48,922
I was about to beat you.

344
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:51,349
I'd say you already did.

345
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:54,543
No. See, your player's still alive.

346
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:57,963
I'm talking about that
little bomb you dropped earlier.

347
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,489
I think that was your bomb.

348
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,046
And if you want some advice, I'd lay off
the junk food, let your stomach settle.

349
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,854
Andy, quit messing around!

350
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:06,240
I'm in trouble, huh?

351
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:08,569
How could you say it's
gonna be our last day together?

352
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:12,755
What, are you, like, dying tomorrow?

353
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:15,948
How many cancer patients
do you know that die overnight?

354
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:17,495
You're doing it again.

355
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:19,035
All right, fine.

356
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:22,568
It's our last day together because

357
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:24,133
I start chemo tomorrow.

358
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:27,333
What does chemo have to do with...

359
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:29,090
It has to do with me puking,

360
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,104
you sympathizing, me withdrawing,

361
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:35,452
you resenting me,
me resenting your resentment,

362
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:37,215
blah blah blah.

363
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:39,978
Trust me, it's messy.

364
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:45,147
That's why I think it should
be our last day together.

365
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,088
So why don't we make it special, okay?

366
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:56,048
To kick things off,

367
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:59,276
I think we should
go upstairs and make out.

368
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,199
Pacing's not working for you.

369
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:09,776
How do you know that?

370
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,704
You said it.

371
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:13,445
But not to you.

372
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:17,309
That's right. You said you were me,
which means I'm talking to myself.

373
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:20,725
Your self-doubt was paralyzing you.

374
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:23,769
You needed someone to talk to.

375
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,891
Someone I trusted more
than my own instincts.

376
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:29,163
Someone like you.

377
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:31,880
Kinda cool, isn't it?

378
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:34,947
Okay, then.

379
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:38,117
I need help deciding
if I should go after Jessi.

380
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,355
You just realized she's
Madacorp's secret weapon.

381
00:19:42,674 --> 00:19:44,982
Wouldn't you be playing
right into their plan?

382
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,902
But I can't believe that
she's a willing weapon.

383
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:49,879
Which means she's out there
lost and alone.

384
00:19:50,217 --> 00:19:52,923
Why are you worried about her
after everything she's done?

385
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:55,326
Because if I don't believe in her,

386
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:56,927
no one will.

387
00:19:58,154 --> 00:19:59,722
Maybe no one should.

388
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:12,968
What are you doing?

389
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:18,862
Now, you gotta be nice.

390
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,124
<i>You wanna play?</i>

391
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,726
Let's play.

392
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:35,466
No. No. Please.

393
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:38,511
No, let him go!

394
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,839
Why aren't you letting him go?

395
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:45,810
Don't! Don't kill him!

396
00:20:55,191 --> 00:20:56,487
Oh, God!

397
00:21:24,622 --> 00:21:26,456
- I have to go to work.
- What?

398
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:29,060
I rushed out last night
when I got the call about Kyle.

399
00:21:29,195 --> 00:21:31,274
I didn't get a chance to
shut down all my systems.

400
00:21:31,394 --> 00:21:33,486
I don't think it sends
a good message to the kids

401
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,341
about the lockdown
if you leave right now.

402
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:38,601
I am not in the mood to be lectured
about what's appropriate.

403
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:40,531
- I'm not.
- No, let me finish.

404
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:43,660
I ver betrayed the vows
I made to you when we got married.

405
00:21:44,243 --> 00:21:45,661
I never cheated, I never lied,

406
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:47,612
and I never kept any secrets.

407
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:52,192
But I guess you'll either
believe that or you won't.

408
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:02,532
So why do I get the happy
family and the great life?

409
00:22:02,795 --> 00:22:05,055
You mean why does she get
the short end of the stick?

410
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,908
- It's just a...
- Expression.

411
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:10,227
I know. You're me, remember?

412
00:22:13,016 --> 00:22:14,356
Maybe she was born bad.

413
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,106
The same way that you were born good.

414
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:18,631
But was I?

415
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:22,385
Or would being taken in
by a loving family make me good?

416
00:22:22,828 --> 00:22:23,991
She didn't have that.

417
00:22:24,672 --> 00:22:27,568
There's no one that cares
enough about her to help her.

418
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:30,205
You're a do-gooder like Amanda said.

419
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:31,999
Help her.

420
00:22:34,692 --> 00:22:36,143
I can't leave this house.

421
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:38,319
So don't help her.

422
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,928
- Stop confusing me.
- You just need to trust yourself.

423
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:46,389
That's what this is all about.

424
00:22:47,503 --> 00:22:49,126
Even if I wanted to help her,

425
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:51,419
I have no idea where she is.

426
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:53,909
You should ask her.

427
00:22:57,215 --> 00:22:58,330
Help me.

428
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:07,955
Help me.

429
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,298
You're not really here.

430
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:15,376
That's true.

431
00:23:29,036 --> 00:23:30,599
You look so happy.

432
00:23:35,736 --> 00:23:37,721
If I had what you have,

433
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:40,943
I wouldn't come after me either.

434
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,770
You made a promise to be here for her.

435
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:56,749
I know.

436
00:23:58,151 --> 00:23:59,795
Would you break it just to help me?

437
00:24:02,664 --> 00:24:05,807
I'd help you so that we could
take down Madacorp and save my family.

438
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:07,544
Do you think that's possible?

439
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:08,872
It has to be.

440
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,889
I can't live like this anymore.

441
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,562
Then you should come find me.

442
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:19,126
But where are you?

443
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,822
That's for you to figure out.

444
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:23,687
You already said that,

445
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:25,613
you and I were the same.

446
00:24:27,364 --> 00:24:28,544
In a way, yes.

447
00:24:30,032 --> 00:24:31,124
So...

448
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:34,121
have you ever run away?

449
00:24:34,877 --> 00:24:35,922
Once.

450
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:38,584
Where did you go?

451
00:24:41,885 --> 00:24:43,255
Back to the beginning.

452
00:24:45,205 --> 00:24:46,835
Then you know where to look.

453
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,374
The question is...

454
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:51,930
will you?

455
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,552
Are you okay?

456
00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:23,921
Stay away from me.

457
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,761
- I'm bad.
- Are you lost?

458
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:28,519
Do you need some help?

459
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:30,917
I don't deserve help.

460
00:25:32,515 --> 00:25:33,634
Sweetie,

461
00:25:34,876 --> 00:25:36,449
what happened to you?

462
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:41,933
I said stay away from me!

463
00:25:55,052 --> 00:25:56,620
- What are you doing here?
- Hey.

464
00:26:00,547 --> 00:26:01,876
I'm sorry about earlier.

465
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:04,157
You know the situation's sensitive.

466
00:26:04,277 --> 00:26:06,505
It's okay. We're all
under a lot of pressure.

467
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:09,883
Well, you being here is a good sign.
I take it Jessi made it home.

468
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,653
Yes.

469
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:13,494
We had a long talk.

470
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:16,849
She's got a lot to work out,
and I'm gonna get her some more help.

471
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:18,276
Oh, good.

472
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,995
The police are still
gonna want to talk to her.

473
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:22,175
Of course.

474
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:24,773
So what brings you
up to the fifth floor?

475
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,881
I was shutting down
my system from the trial run,

476
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:30,279
and I noticed the diagnostic results
have been erased.

477
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:33,615
That doesn't sound right.

478
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,870
The entire server's on lockdown.
I don't have any access to it.

479
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,705
I'm worried that it's viral,
I'm gonna check out the mainframe.

480
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,000
You can't go in there right now.
Ballantine's

481
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,377
giving a tour to a potential investor.

482
00:26:46,495 --> 00:26:47,504
On Sunday?

483
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:50,584
Yeah, the human trial was so successful

484
00:26:50,704 --> 00:26:52,426
that he wanted to show it off.

485
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:54,769
What? That's just the thing.

486
00:26:54,892 --> 00:26:57,014
We don't know if it was
because we don't have

487
00:26:57,134 --> 00:26:58,941
any access to the system.

488
00:26:59,873 --> 00:27:01,977
Stephen, go home.

489
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:03,502
Worry about it tomorrow.

490
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,216
What's going on in there?

491
00:27:08,887 --> 00:27:10,986
Nothing, just a business show-and-tell.

492
00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:15,949
I'll see you tomorrow?

493
00:27:17,506 --> 00:27:18,526
Sure.

494
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:26,202
You're acting weird.

495
00:27:26,838 --> 00:27:29,255
I'm on top of you making out.
What's weird about it?

496
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,583
You're being hesitant.

497
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:32,531
Guys aren't supposed to do hesitant.

498
00:27:32,654 --> 00:27:34,038
I'm not being hesitant.

499
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:43,966
Totally hesitant.

500
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,942
- Stop using that word.
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

501
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:50,237
Any other guy would have his hand
halfway to the promised land by now.

502
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:52,480
I'm trying to be respectful.

503
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:53,618
No,

504
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,609
respect is the slow, steady inching,

505
00:27:56,735 --> 00:27:58,934
waiting for me to swat your hand away.

506
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:01,467
Respect is at least trying to go there.

507
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:04,953
Unless...

508
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,209
Unless what?

509
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:10,629
Unless you've never gone there before.

510
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:15,801
- You've never touched a boob.
- I've touched a boob.

511
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:17,803
A real one or one of those inflatable...

512
00:28:17,925 --> 00:28:19,461
I've touched a boob, okay?

513
00:28:19,608 --> 00:28:20,848
Just never...

514
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:22,267
Never what?

515
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,936
Never one that mattered.

516
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:28,939
My boobs matter?

517
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:30,790
Well, of course they matter.

518
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:33,277
Why else would I put up
with this humiliation?

519
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,044
Then let me help you out.

520
00:28:44,126 --> 00:28:45,205
There you go.

521
00:28:45,638 --> 00:28:46,874
They're all ready for ya.

522
00:28:48,048 --> 00:28:50,606
Go where only a few men
have gone before.

523
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,212
You're not helping.

524
00:28:52,437 --> 00:28:54,267
I'm serious. I want you to.

525
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,134
Besides, this is your
only chance, remember?

526
00:28:57,681 --> 00:28:58,510
See?

527
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:01,179
That's the problem.

528
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:02,705
You're ruining it.

529
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:05,017
You said this would be our last day.

530
00:29:05,865 --> 00:29:08,270
Which means that'll be
the last time I can touch

531
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,652
them... boobs.

532
00:29:10,155 --> 00:29:11,315
And that's not cool!

533
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,522
Because I wanna touch them tomorrow

534
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:16,351
and the next day and
all the days after that.

535
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,991
So quit acting like today is it for us,
'cause I don't want it to be.

536
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:22,893
It has to be.

537
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,080
You're gonna have to find
someone else to feel you up...

538
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,926
'cause I'm not having it.

539
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:39,217
<i>What we have here</i>

540
00:29:39,337 --> 00:29:40,965
is a failure to communicate.

541
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:44,123
Hils, I've spent a year trying
to get Declan to communicate.

542
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:47,659
- I seriously doubt...
- You say that like it is all my fault.

543
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:50,720
I don't know, Mr. Secretive and Moody.
What do you think?

544
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,822
You haven't exactly made it easy lately.

545
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:55,400
Good. So it's my fault
that you dumped me

546
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:58,129
for no reason and then
took up with La Femme Nikita.

547
00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:00,101
This is good.
We're speaking from the heart.

548
00:30:00,224 --> 00:30:02,019
Declan, I need to talk
to you for a minute.

549
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:03,754
- Gladly!
- Oh, no! No way!

550
00:30:03,874 --> 00:30:06,787
We were just making progress.
We're not making progress here.

551
00:30:06,912 --> 00:30:08,413
We're wasting each other's time.

552
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:11,667
So you think trying to get to the bottom
of our problems is a waste of time?

553
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,399
Come on, Lori! You think
this is just as stupid as I do!

554
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:15,843
I just need a minute.

555
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:19,729
What you need is to accept
your part of the responsibility

556
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:22,219
for the tragic demise
of Beachwood's best couple.

557
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:23,679
For cryin' out loud!

558
00:30:23,878 --> 00:30:26,890
Seriously! I'm all in favor
for a good romance.

559
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,890
But the intensity of
the Kyle-Declan friendship...

560
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:31,478
we'll call it Kyclan...

561
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:33,397
clearly interfered
between the relationship

562
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,940
of Lori and Declan.

563
00:30:35,607 --> 00:30:37,734
Kyle, what do you have
to say for yourself?

564
00:30:41,276 --> 00:30:42,280
I'm sorry.

565
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,229
I'm not doing this.

566
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:46,164
Lori, if you wanna talk to me,

567
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:48,254
really talk, minus the circus,

568
00:30:48,374 --> 00:30:49,452
then I'm here.

569
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:51,690
Until then, leave me out of it.

570
00:30:55,058 --> 00:30:56,253
<i>She's right.</i>

571
00:30:56,718 --> 00:31:00,841
You, Lori, everything that's happened
to this family is all because of me.

572
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:04,886
I need to put a stop to it.

573
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,341
How can I help?

574
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:12,894
Loan me your car.

575
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:15,591
I thought you couldn't leave the house.

576
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:20,373
You're going after her.

577
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:24,948
The thing I admire most
about you is your faith in people.

578
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,995
But I worry this time...

579
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:30,120
it's gonna be the end of you.

580
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:32,998
Does this mean
you won't give me the keys?

581
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:41,641
Thank you.

582
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,387
Good luck.

583
00:31:44,223 --> 00:31:45,576
You're gonna need it.

584
00:31:57,577 --> 00:31:58,671
Hello.

585
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:00,442
I don't know how you do it.

586
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:01,923
Do what?

587
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:03,208
Help people.

588
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,448
I gave it my all...
with Angst and Angstier.

589
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:09,325
I learned from Phil and Oprah,

590
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:11,359
yet everything comes up Springer.

591
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,289
I'm a fraud. A Faux-prah.

592
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,271
Well, helping people, get in touch
with what they're really feeling

593
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:20,962
is a complicated process.

594
00:32:21,742 --> 00:32:23,537
I just hate all the drama.

595
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:26,968
Lori's my best friend.
I just wanna help her.

596
00:32:27,803 --> 00:32:30,631
All we can ever really do
is encourage people to

597
00:32:30,963 --> 00:32:33,287
talk openly about their problems.

598
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:35,045
They may not like it, but...

599
00:32:35,562 --> 00:32:36,937
it's imperative to put issues

600
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:38,611
out on the table.

601
00:32:38,746 --> 00:32:40,333
That's what I've been saying.

602
00:32:40,468 --> 00:32:43,318
I mean, really, is honesty
that freaking difficult?

603
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:48,086
It shouldn't be, should it?

604
00:32:49,284 --> 00:32:51,338
And people think I'm the dumb blonde.

605
00:32:52,322 --> 00:32:55,372
I have to say, Hillary, I don't think
there's anything dumb about you.

606
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:22,503
<i>What happened to you?</i>

607
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:24,163
The old Tom,

608
00:33:25,105 --> 00:33:27,178
<i>he would have fought it out
till the bitter end.</i>

609
00:33:28,432 --> 00:33:29,197
<i>Big,</i>

610
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:31,700
strong, stoic

611
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:33,577
Tom Foss.

612
00:33:35,463 --> 00:33:37,885
Survived a war, brought down Zzyzx,

613
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,792
then a little trip down memory lane

614
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,790
did him in.

615
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:46,086
All I want,

616
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:48,336
all Baylin wanted,

617
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,536
was to see Kyle reach his potential.

618
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:52,972
But now Ballantine's
gonna put him in the chair

619
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:54,181
and go for broke.

620
00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:57,827
It's gonna make what happened to you
look like a day at the spa.

621
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:01,716
You let them beat you, Tom.

622
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,889
You let them break you.

623
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,692
And now they're gonna break Kyle.

624
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:11,114
You are the traitor!
I'll never help you!

625
00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:14,534
You'll never break me.

626
00:34:57,251 --> 00:34:58,777
What are you doing?

627
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:01,412
I came in here to ask
your permission to tell Stephen

628
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,124
about the secret we kept
from the family only to find you

629
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:05,835
sneaking out of the house?

630
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:08,857
I'm going to find Jessi.

631
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:12,676
- I wanted to tell you, but...
- But you knew I wouldn't let you go.

632
00:35:14,014 --> 00:35:15,262
This is important.

633
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:18,598
More important than our trust in you?

634
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:22,794
I'm doing this for all of you.

635
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,495
I can fix this.
I can fix everything that's broken.

636
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,618
Why Jessi?

637
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,982
Why you? How are you two connected?

638
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:36,309
You already know the answer
to that question.

639
00:35:36,872 --> 00:35:38,535
She and I are the same.

640
00:35:39,455 --> 00:35:41,262
What is that supposed to mean?

641
00:35:41,397 --> 00:35:43,373
I don't even know who you are.

642
00:35:46,685 --> 00:35:50,164
You told me once that I never brought
anything by love into this house.

643
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:53,868
But all I ever brought was pain.

644
00:35:55,673 --> 00:35:57,542
I need to make this right.

645
00:35:58,645 --> 00:35:59,645
Please.

646
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:02,141
I have to go.

647
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:30,985
<i>I had promised her I'd always be here,</i>

648
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:33,256
<i>just like I promised
myself I'd never put</i>

649
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:34,772
<i>my family at risk.</i>

650
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:39,407
<i>I had broken both those promises.</i>

651
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:05,620
I'm not hungry.

652
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,989
Consider it a peace offering.

653
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:12,545
Considering I made them
for you in the first place,

654
00:37:12,973 --> 00:37:14,657
your gesturing's a little hollow.

655
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:16,269
Don't be so cranky.

656
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:18,163
Right.

657
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:26,831
What are you pausing it for?

658
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:30,028
Go ahead. Put the final nail
in the coffin of this miserable day.

659
00:37:30,163 --> 00:37:33,839
There's no rush.
I can beat you tomorrow and the next day

660
00:37:34,097 --> 00:37:36,069
and all the days after that.

661
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:39,197
Really?

662
00:37:40,073 --> 00:37:41,152
Really.

663
00:38:09,742 --> 00:38:12,029
No more wild revenge scenarios?

664
00:38:12,238 --> 00:38:13,467
Not today.

665
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,139
It's too exhausting.

666
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:16,734
Where's your partner in crime?

667
00:38:16,854 --> 00:38:19,400
She said something about
a lost marathon and bailed.

668
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,202
Which just leaves us.

669
00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:22,991
Lucky us.

670
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,969
Listen, Lori, I don't wanna be that guy,

671
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:28,121
the guy who's all locked up.

672
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:30,734
You were the one I could
always open up to.

673
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,375
But you never did.

674
00:38:32,996 --> 00:38:34,127
I did.

675
00:38:34,902 --> 00:38:35,962
Sort of.

676
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,256
As much as I could.

677
00:38:39,095 --> 00:38:41,968
Says the guy with more baggage
than an airport carousel.

678
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:45,611
I suppose I could limit myself to

679
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:48,141
carry-on if it meant
that we could be friends again.

680
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,228
One of those big rolly ones you have to

681
00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:54,197
scrunch and shove in the overhead?

682
00:38:54,317 --> 00:38:56,733
You really want to run
this metaphor into the ground, huh?

683
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,735
It's what I do.

684
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,072
I miss this.

685
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:04,658
I miss you.

686
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:08,219
I miss you, too.

687
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:11,785
I won't be able to change overnight.

688
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,379
But if you can bear with me,

689
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:17,107
I can try to be a little more...

690
00:39:19,788 --> 00:39:21,132
Communicative?

691
00:39:22,972 --> 00:39:24,219
I suppose.

692
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,471
Open and honest?

693
00:39:27,435 --> 00:39:29,474
About... certain things.

694
00:39:30,866 --> 00:39:32,143
Warm and sunshiny?

695
00:39:32,477 --> 00:39:34,187
You may wanna quit while you're ahead.

696
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:37,727
Downgraded from darts.
Things are looking up.

697
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,517
I guess they are.

698
00:40:43,564 --> 00:40:45,383
Why did you come after me?

699
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:47,927
You need me to.

700
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:53,182
I'll betray you.

701
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:56,436
That's what they want me to do.

702
00:40:58,061 --> 00:41:00,023
You don't have to do
what they want you to.

703
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:03,298
You can make your own choices.

704
00:41:04,576 --> 00:41:06,070
That's what Nicole said.

705
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,794
Nicole's smart.

706
00:41:10,073 --> 00:41:11,524
She helped me.

707
00:41:13,048 --> 00:41:14,769
Now let me help you.

708
00:41:17,597 --> 00:41:19,000
They'll take me back.

709
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:21,347
We're not going back.

710
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,172
Not until this is all over.

711
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:29,599
I want it to be over.

712
00:41:31,786 --> 00:41:32,680
So do I.

713
00:42:14,675 --> 00:42:16,342
There's something I want to tell you.

714
00:42:17,053 --> 00:42:18,351
I want to talk to you, too.

715
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:21,688
I don't know where to begin.

716
00:42:21,808 --> 00:42:23,514
Why don't we begin with me because

717
00:42:23,649 --> 00:42:25,506
there's something I need to tell you.

718
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:27,694
I accused you of keeping secrets.

719
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:29,487
What I have to say goes far beyond that.

720
00:42:29,607 --> 00:42:31,072
I've been keeping secrets, too.

721
00:42:31,192 --> 00:42:34,283
- I discovered something about Kyle.
- Secrets about Kyle.
