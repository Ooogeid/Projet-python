1
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,595
I hate being the new girl.

2
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:20,106
You'll be fine.

3
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,749
What if nobody likes me?

4
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,856
Why wouldn't they like you?

5
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:28,294
- I don't know.
- Just...

6
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:30,036
be yourself.

7
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:34,269
Myself.

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,488
You know, Nicole's kids go here.

9
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:37,979
Kyle's your age.

10
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:39,842
I don't know Kyle.

11
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:41,752
I bet you two have a lot in common.

12
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:43,360
- How would you know?
- I don't,

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,408
but you won't make friends
if you don't try.

14
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:50,516
Okay.

15
00:00:57,843 --> 00:00:58,964
Have a nice day.

16
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:04,319
Well, that's subtle.

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,864
Nice rims.

18
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:10,088
Josh, the car is not on display
for you to admire its accessories.

19
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,279
Somebody died in it.

20
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:14,687
Somebody who shouldn't have guzzled
a bucket of vodka before driving.

21
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,959
- Check out that stereo.
- You're diseased.

22
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,683
Kyle, knock some sense into him.

23
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,153
I'm sorry I haven't fixed your radio.

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,846
You have been remiss
in your boy genius duties.

25
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,221
I've had a lot on my mind.

26
00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:31,981
I think I'm in a gunk.

27
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,040
- A what?
- A guy funk.

28
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,356
It's your word.

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,624
Oh, yeah. No,"gunk" is over.
You have the <i>ennui.</i>

30
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:42,514
<i>Ennui?</i> Isn't that French?

31
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:44,749
<i>Ennui</i> is the new gunk. Trust me.

Season 2 Episode 7
- Free To Be You And Me -

35
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,194
<i>I was surrounded by people,</i>

36
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,163
<i>many of them friends,</i>

37
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:26,009
<i>but none who knew the real me.</i>

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,562
<i>Foss had made it clear that
he was the only one I should trust,</i>

39
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:35,857
<i>and I had allowed him to set the rules
for how I lived my life.</i>

40
00:02:36,249 --> 00:02:39,021
<i>But now all I felt was doubt and regret.</i>

41
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:45,191
These are for you.

42
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,681
- Why?
- Well, let's see.

43
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:51,634
A piano mysteriously appeared
in my living room last night.

44
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:53,401
- Really?
- When I asked Mom

45
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,977
how it got there,
she rolled her eyes in annoyance.

46
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,713
- She did?
- The only person

47
00:02:57,868 --> 00:03:00,093
who could annoy her like that is you.

48
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,049
- True.
- Ergo, flowers.

49
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,433
Actually, tap-rooted
perennial herbaceous plant.

50
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:11,013
I love them. Thank you.

51
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:13,212
Are you kidding? Thank you.

52
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,577
You've been such a good friend
to me through everything.

53
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,564
You've been a good friend to me, too.

54
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,911
And I was thinking maybe
that I should return the favor.

55
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,457
You want to give me a piano?

56
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:25,760
No.

57
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,448
But I thought we could go
to the Spring Fling dance together.

58
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,226
I mean, if you wanted to.

59
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,268
Your mom won't like that.

60
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,458
My mom left this morning for a week.
The cat's away.

61
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:39,280
You don't have a cat.

62
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:42,887
No. I mean I can do whatever I want.

63
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,432
She's not around to control my life,

64
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:47,673
to tell me who to hang out with.

65
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,364
My cat's away, too.

66
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,623
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

67
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,382
Great. That's great.

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,061
Okay, well, I'll... I'll see you later.

69
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:03,943
See you later.

70
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,200
<i>A single bright moment
in an otherwise dark time.</i>

71
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:13,777
<i>With Foss not around to dictate my days,</i>

72
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:17,036
<i>I could finally pursue the very thing
he'd wanted me to give up:</i>

73
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,608
<i>a life.</i>

74
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:22,829
- Thank you.
- There you go, sir. You're welcome.

75
00:04:22,988 --> 00:04:25,152
- Yes, Madam?
- Hi. Uh, can I get

76
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:27,243
a large latte double shot?

77
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:29,119
Start the day off with a jolt, huh?

78
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:30,693
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

79
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,571
Yeah. I just dropped my sister off

80
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:35,546
for her first day at a new school.

81
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:37,685
She's nervous, I'm nervous.

82
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:39,535
I figured I'd drown myself in caffeine.

83
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,600
- What school?
- Beachwood.

84
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,328
Oh, my kids go there.

85
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:45,140
- Yeah?
- What's her name?

86
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,602
Jessi Hollander.

87
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:48,682
And I'm Emily, in case you forgot.

88
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:50,410
It's Stephen, right?

89
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,890
Stephen Trager.

90
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:53,337
Trager.

91
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:55,444
Any relation to Nicole?

92
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,770
She's my wife.

93
00:04:57,927 --> 00:04:58,934
No.

94
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:01,702
Unbelievable.

95
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,391
Jessi's been taking
some private therapy sessions with her.

96
00:05:04,562 --> 00:05:05,799
- You're kidding.
- No.

97
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:07,476
She has been so great with her.

98
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,000
So, how are you enjoying
life at Madacorp?

99
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,527
Oh, well, so far, so good,

100
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,674
although I don't understand
half of what they do here.

101
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:19,811
We're building the foundations
for tomorrow.

102
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,359
- Right.
- Yes, we're very important.

103
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:25,887
- I tell my kids to watch your sister.
- Oh, that would be great.

104
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,689
She's had a rough time,
but she's a really good kid.

105
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,544
Well, maybe they can be friends.

106
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:32,694
I hope so.

107
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,370
- Well, I got to go.
- Okay.

108
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,715
- I'll see you around.
- Bye.

109
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,026
You're off the hook.

110
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,702
I didn't know I was on a hook.

111
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:50,550
I know you have a secret burning desire

112
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,330
to ask me to the dance,

113
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,462
but I can't go.

114
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:56,873
And why, perchance,
has this hideous fate befallen me?

115
00:05:57,264 --> 00:06:00,429
I got nabbed for trying to borrow
the stereo from the drunk-driving car.

116
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:03,191
You tried to steal
a dead person's radio?

117
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:04,552
Borrow.

118
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:06,201
So you can't go to the dance.

119
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:07,676
I was ordered to clean-up duty.

120
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:09,171
- Sucks.
- Totally.

121
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:12,228
What sucks even more is that you have
to clean up after me and my dates.

122
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,801
Your who?

123
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:15,395
Dates.

124
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,527
You have multiple dates for the dance?

125
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,581
Uh, yeah.

126
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:21,452
Is that a problem?

127
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:22,722
No, I just thought...

128
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:25,938
That I had a secret burning
desire to ask you?

129
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:27,625
Yeah. No.

130
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,548
How's a girl supposed to combat PMS

131
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,627
when the chocolate machine's
on the fritz?

132
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,583
- Did you buy the dance tickets?
- They wouldn't sell them to me.

133
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:37,768
Why not?

134
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,604
Because you're a girl.

135
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,309
- And?
- And that's it.

136
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,197
They won't sell same-sex couple tickets.

137
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,130
But we're not a same-sex couple.

138
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,238
We're just two girls
who currently hate men.

139
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:49,765
I tried to explain that,

140
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:51,714
then they told me
to buy two single tickets,

141
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,308
which were more expensive.

142
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,404
Then I got all PMS-y on them.

143
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:57,172
They told me to go away.

144
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,397
That's stupid.

145
00:06:58,556 --> 00:06:59,572
Whatever.

146
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:01,782
Yes.

147
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:04,624
Hi.

148
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,301
Hi, mood swing.
What's got you all peppy?

149
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,041
I'm going to the dance with Amanda.

150
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:10,564
Oh, the hypocrisy.

151
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:13,057
You have a date with Amanda?

152
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:14,885
Oh, no. It's not a date.

153
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,519
How do you know?

154
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:19,318
She told me she's doing me a favor.

155
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:21,070
A favor?

156
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,803
Kyle, what exactly did she say?

157
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,586
She said, "You've been such a good
friend to me through everything,

158
00:07:27,718 --> 00:07:30,404
"and I was thinking maybe
that I should return the favor.

159
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:32,897
"I thought we could go
to the Spring Fling dance together.

160
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,550
"I mean, if you wanted to."

161
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,512
And then she said something about a cat.

162
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:40,496
Oh, you sweet, clueless little muffin.

163
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:42,570
You better put on your dancing shoes

164
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:44,813
because you have a date.

165
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:49,460
I do?

166
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:51,659
You totally do.

167
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,051
Dibs on the new girl.

168
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,087
- Hi.
- Hey.

169
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,844
- You go here?
- Yes.

170
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,968
I'm, uh, I'm Charlie Tanner.

171
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,589
I'll happily be your one-man
welcoming committee.

172
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,141
Maybe later we could hang out.

173
00:08:19,617 --> 00:08:21,003
I'd like to do more kissing.

174
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,573
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

175
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:28,750
Who's that?

176
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,845
One of my mom's troubled teens.

177
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,696
She looks like trouble.

178
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:35,660
You say that because
she's totally smoking hot and sexy

179
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,210
and hitting on my ex-boyfriend.

180
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,427
Pretty much.

181
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,837
I think I have to hate her.

182
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:42,332
<i>Au contraire.</i>

183
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,588
Keep your friends close

184
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:46,815
and your enemies even closer.

185
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:48,850
Make that girl your "frenemy."

186
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:09,707
- What's the matter?
- I have a date with Amanda.

187
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,167
Well, that's great.

188
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:13,854
No, it's terrible.

189
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:16,260
- Why?
- Because I feel sick.

190
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,166
When did that start?

191
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,419
When I found out it was a date.

192
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,617
It's just anxiety.

193
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,930
But why am I anxious? I like her.

194
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:27,983
I've liked her
since the first time I saw her.

195
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,571
That's precisely why you're scared.

196
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,891
If you weren't,
then you'd have reason to worry.

197
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,206
You feel better?

198
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,385
Working on it.

199
00:09:41,095 --> 00:09:43,373
Take a minute. I'll get us some water.

200
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:47,809
Jessi, hi.

201
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:49,254
Hello.

202
00:09:49,393 --> 00:09:51,422
I'm sorry. I didn't hear
the back doorbell ring.

203
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:52,617
Do we have a session today?

204
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:55,044
Hey, Mom. I invited Jessi over.

205
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:56,489
Oh.

206
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,951
That's nice.

207
00:09:58,518 --> 00:09:59,923
Lore, do you have a second?

208
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:02,398
Sure. Make yourself at home.

209
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:09,155
Since when are you two friends?

210
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,546
She's not my friend. She's my "frenemy."

211
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:13,890
Regardless of semantics, Lori,

212
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,826
I really don't think
this is appropriate.

213
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,210
I need to keep an eye on her.

214
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,070
She's all over Declan,

215
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,382
and I just don't think
they're a good match.

216
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:42,125
Well, I don't think pretending to be
her friend is the mature choice.

217
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:14,956
You're crossing boundaries here.

218
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:17,237
Your job is what brought
Kyle into this house.

219
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,939
Don't you think you should be
a little flexible on the matter?

220
00:11:41,263 --> 00:11:42,279
Hi.

221
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,840
Hi.

222
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,653
You're Kyle.

223
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:47,291
You're in my tub.

224
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:50,685
It's comfortable.

225
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:53,081
You don't think it's strange
I sleep in a tub?

226
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:55,260
Is it?

227
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,360
Maybe a little.

228
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,305
You must be Jessi.

229
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,270
You're here for Nicole.

230
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,699
You call your mom Nicole?

231
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:09,910
She's my guardian.

232
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:11,987
She used to be my therapist, too.

233
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,851
Were you troubled?

234
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:17,253
I'm troubled.

235
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,717
Why?

236
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:21,961
I'm not sure.

237
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,419
Have we met before?

238
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:37,367
I don't think so.

239
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,240
Sweet. Pizza.

240
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,877
I thought you liked when I cooked.

241
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:15,794
Yeah, but ever since you got good at it,
we never get cool food.

242
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:18,661
I'll try to remember that.
Where is everybody?

243
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,182
Finally.

244
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:22,854
Uh, I'll take that.

245
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,920
Principal Hooper called.
You won't be needing this for a while.

246
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,945
I blame you.
If you'd fixed this a week ago,

247
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,261
I wouldn't have been tempted.

248
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:32,317
I didn't fix it. Jessi did.

249
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:33,674
Jessi did?

250
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,990
Who's Jessi?
And is she hot or just smart?

251
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:39,860
She's one of my patients.
She's off-limits on all fronts.

252
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:43,236
Here we go again.
Mom's setting boundaries.

253
00:13:43,396 --> 00:13:44,592
Mom's rights.

254
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:48,126
Twice in one day people are telling
me who I'm allowed to hang out with.

255
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:51,275
The stupid school won't sell us
same-sex couple dance tickets.

256
00:13:51,408 --> 00:13:53,247
What? Well, that's ridiculous.

257
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,006
What's wrong with same-sex couples?

258
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,286
Nothing...

259
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:58,154
if they're girls.

260
00:13:58,335 --> 00:13:59,350
Neanderthal.

261
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,792
Why are girls okay and not guys?

262
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:02,141
Both should be okay.

263
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:04,537
Why is the school saying no?

264
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:07,655
Apparently, they're still living
in the 20th Century.

265
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:09,810
Sweet. Pizza.

266
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:11,293
I'm never cooking again.

267
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,139
Dad, thank God you're here.

268
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,322
Dinner was becoming an episode of <i>Oprah.</i>

269
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:19,721
Hey, guys, I have a coworker whose
sister just started at your school.

270
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:21,400
It's your patient, Jessi Hollander.

271
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:24,186
- Emily works at Madacorp?
- Mm-hmm.

272
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:26,085
I told her you'd
keep an eye out for Jessi.

273
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:27,248
Ha!

274
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,375
Stephen, you have terrible timing.

275
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:39,893
Is Lori your friend?

276
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:43,750
- You want to talk about Lori?
- Well, she's being nice to me,

277
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,986
and my sister said
that I should make friends.

278
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:48,042
You are.

279
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,189
- What about Kyle?
- What about him?

280
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:54,546
Is he your friend?

281
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:56,383
He used to be.

282
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:58,315
I don't really have any friends.

283
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,172
Well, they're overrated.

284
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,266
You're lonely.

285
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,977
I'm lonely, too.

286
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:16,865
What's going on?

287
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,048
Jessi, what are you doing?

288
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:22,170
Making friends.

289
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:24,397
Hi. I'm...

290
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,536
Leaving.

291
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,999
Who the hell was that?

292
00:15:37,231 --> 00:15:38,237
Declan.

293
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:39,995
You are not seeing him again.

294
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:42,415
But I like him.

295
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,756
We have a lot in common,
there's a dance this...

296
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:46,342
No. You are not going with him.

297
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,425
Jessi, what is it?

298
00:15:54,316 --> 00:15:55,322
My head.

299
00:15:56,862 --> 00:15:58,552
You said I should meet people.

300
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:00,866
Not him. That's not who I meant.

301
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:02,592
Then who did you mean?

302
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,767
Jessi,

303
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:09,730
stop being so dramatic,
and just do what you're told.

304
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:17,956
Hi.

305
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:20,608
- Hi.
- I saw you from my window.

306
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,056
What are you doing out here?

307
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:24,437
Can't sleep.

308
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,171
What are you doing?

309
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:30,148
My mom said I'm supposed to be in bed
by 10 while she's out of town.

310
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:32,425
- It's 11.
- Exactly.

311
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,141
Are you okay?

312
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,710
Not really.

313
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:49,002
Kyle,

314
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,318
it's okay if you don't want
to go with me to the dance.

315
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,536
I didn't mean to make you
uncomfortable by asking you.

316
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,254
I do want to go to the dance with you.

317
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,420
Then why are you acting so weird?

318
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,908
Nicole says it's because I like you.

319
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,235
You do?

320
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:13,491
Of course.

321
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,417
Don't you like me?

322
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:20,052
Well, yeah.

323
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:22,027
Yeah, I do.

324
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,722
I like you.

325
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,111
So we're going to the dance together.

326
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,143
And you're okay with that?

327
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,429
It's the best thing
that's happened to me in a long time.

328
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,367
Hey, potentially sane Trager
and perky blonde girl.

329
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:04,356
In the mood for a little
civil disobedience?

330
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:05,617
Does it involve drinking?

331
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:08,475
Only if rehab's your idea
of social activism.

332
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:12,334
It's your chance to overcome the obvious
genetic deficiencies in your family.

333
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,522
"Beachwood bias"?

334
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:15,099
You're protesting the dance policy?

335
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,827
Yes, the dance policy.

336
00:18:17,005 --> 00:18:19,966
A bunch of us are ditching first period
to plaster the school with these.

337
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:21,377
We need more bodies.

338
00:18:21,704 --> 00:18:23,081
Yeah, we're not,

339
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:26,081
you know, of the lesbionic variety.

340
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:28,404
I don't really think
that's the point, Hils.

341
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:30,872
You heard about us
getting denied dance tickets?

342
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:32,615
She made a little bit of a scene.

343
00:18:32,818 --> 00:18:34,641
What? I was cranky. Sue me.

344
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:37,360
Anyway, I thought you guys
might be into taking a stand,

345
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,894
having a voice, that kind
of important life stuff.

346
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:42,526
But maybe I pegged you wrong.
Whatever. No big.

347
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:44,094
He, wait. Hold on.

348
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:46,098
You said you need more bodies?

349
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:47,362
Yeah. Why?

350
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,878
You know anyone who wants
to help change the world?

351
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,253
As a matter of fact, I do.

352
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:54,113
I can't believe I'm skipping class.

353
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:55,951
And you're skipping class.

354
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,090
I got a hall pass.

355
00:18:58,086 --> 00:18:59,478
Your teacher give you a hall pass?

356
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:02,591
Mr. Miller's an advocate for
the principles of nonviolent resistance.

357
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:04,204
I need more flyers.

358
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,414
Hillary and I are gonna
wrap the flagpole.

359
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,132
She wanted to chain herself to it naked

360
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,516
with the words "I heart gay"
written on her body, but

361
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:11,976
this seemed like a better plan.

362
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:13,281
You're really enjoying this.

363
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:15,526
I'm embracing my inner activist.

364
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:17,339
That little Andy's a spitfire.

365
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,352
She definitely knows
how to rile people up.

366
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:22,405
I know. Poor Josh.
She'll eat him alive...

367
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,605
not literally.

368
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,546
Long live civil disobedience.

369
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,377
Crap.

370
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,437
Where does this school get off
denying same-sex couples?

371
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,817
It is the administration's prerogative

372
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,748
to uphold certain moral standards.

373
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:45,404
Certain moral standards
or your own personal prejudices?

374
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:48,154
Mrs. Trager,
I am principal of this school.

375
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:50,044
If you think you can do a better job,

376
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:51,534
I invite you to try,

377
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,653
but given the fact
you've managed to raise

378
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:55,233
two vandals and a petty thief,

379
00:19:55,353 --> 00:19:58,045
I recommend you stay focused
on your own children,

380
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:01,601
none of whom will be allowed
to attend the dance.

381
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:11,116
Sorry you got busted.

382
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,617
Oh, whatever. It was worth it.

383
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:15,105
I feel bad for Kyle, though.

384
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:16,906
He really wants to go to the dance.

385
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:18,820
Which brings me to Phase 2.

386
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:20,468
There's a Phase 2?

387
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:21,785
There is now.

388
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,325
Not that I don't appreciate

389
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:26,977
your commitment to the cause,
but why this one, specifically?

390
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:28,662
I get it from my moms.

391
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,090
Moms?

392
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,436
Yes.

393
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:32,810
Plural.

394
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:36,891
Let's just say
I don't have a lot of tolerance

395
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:38,638
for other people's closed-minded crap.

396
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,435
I don't understand
how you tolerate my brother, then.

397
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:45,489
I like to think of Josh
as a perpetual work in progress.

398
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:48,139
Changing the world
one moron at a time, huh?

399
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:50,013
Something like that.

400
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:54,609
Well, then, count me in for Phase 2,

401
00:20:54,768 --> 00:20:56,173
except I can't get suspended.

402
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,706
I don't think SuperMom
could bail me out twice in one week.

403
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,797
Speaking of SuperMom,
mine are both booked,

404
00:21:02,016 --> 00:21:05,267
so do you think yours would be willing

405
00:21:05,403 --> 00:21:07,340
to chaperone
a non-school-sponsored event

406
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:08,912
the same night as the Spring Fling?

407
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:10,756
Well, like an alterna-dance?

408
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:13,323
Something where everyone's welcome,

409
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,303
no matter who their date is.

410
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:16,985
The Swing Spring Fling.

411
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:19,117
I love it, and so will my mom.

412
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:21,500
She's dying to put
Principal Hooper in his place.

413
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:24,206
There's hope for you Tragers after all.

414
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,546
What's up, buddy?

415
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,305
Lori's planning another dance.

416
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:33,802
I heard.

417
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:36,784
And according to Mom,
I'm still on clean-up duty.

418
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:38,470
There's no justice.

419
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,983
I need dancing shoes.

420
00:21:41,747 --> 00:21:43,892
As opposed to any other kind of shoes?

421
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:47,015
Hillary said I need to put on
my dancing shoes for Amanda,

422
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,339
except I don't have any.

423
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:49,970
Dude, it's just an express...

424
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,366
Expression. I knew that.

425
00:21:52,997 --> 00:21:54,004
Sure.

426
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:55,505
Except...

427
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:56,967
Yes?

428
00:21:57,457 --> 00:21:59,356
If there's no shoes to help me dance,

429
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:01,512
- how do I do it?
- Do what?

430
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:04,448
- Dance.
- You don't know how to dance?

431
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:06,102
I don't know. I've never tried.

432
00:22:06,222 --> 00:22:08,496
Well, then, my large-brained friend,

433
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:10,459
allow me to teach you.

434
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,996
You're the smart one.

435
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,049
Music is made of beats.

436
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,341
Get the beats, you'll get the rhythm.

437
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,050
Uh, right, uh...

438
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,491
you got to, you know...

439
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,351
feel it.

440
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:48,515
I feel it.

441
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:51,324
4/4, 4/4, bop, bop, bop.

442
00:22:51,476 --> 00:22:53,373
No, I mean feel the song.

443
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,387
Express yourself. Dancing is freedom.

444
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:05,246
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

445
00:23:10,464 --> 00:23:12,591
Uh, you're not feeling it, man.

446
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:16,684
You'll be fine if you dance next to
people who know what they do. Otherwise,

447
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:20,075
I think we found the first thing
you suck at. Check it.

448
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:35,712
We're dancing together.

449
00:23:36,036 --> 00:23:37,137
I'm dancing.

450
00:23:37,508 --> 00:23:38,514
You're copying.

451
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,749
So why do you have a problem
with other guys dancing together?

452
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,664
- Totally different, dude.
- Why?

453
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:49,369
We're not having one
of those conversations now.

454
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:51,017
I know why you don't like it,

455
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,931
but you're the one who said
dancing's all about freedom.

456
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:55,930
So shouldn't everybody
be able to enjoy it?

457
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:07,757
Jessi, you want to be my first
ticket buyer for the alterna-dance?

458
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:09,760
I assume you're going with Declan.

459
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:12,261
I'm not going.

460
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,303
Oh?

461
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:16,311
My sister won't let me go with him.

462
00:24:17,148 --> 00:24:18,154
Why not?

463
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,059
She has a lot of rules.

464
00:24:22,248 --> 00:24:23,331
She's stric, huh?

465
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:24,660
She's really strict.

466
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:26,747
She's always telling me what to do.

467
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:30,466
Where are your parents?

468
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,069
My mom's crazy, and
my dad couldn't handle it,

469
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,778
so Emily takes care of me now.

470
00:24:36,802 --> 00:24:38,378
Wow. That's rough.

471
00:24:39,237 --> 00:24:41,060
Yeah, we haven't always
had the easiest life.

472
00:24:41,742 --> 00:24:43,109
And Emily's all I have.

473
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,862
She loves me, and that's
why I have to listen to her.

474
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,933
But I really want to go to the dance.

475
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,168
I am a horrible person.

476
00:24:58,674 --> 00:25:00,098
- You are? - Yes.

477
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,191
I'm sorry. I have not
been very nice to you.

478
00:25:03,611 --> 00:25:04,617
You've been nice.

479
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,620
Not inside my head.

480
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,337
Let me make it up to you.

481
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,130
Nobody should have to sit at home alone

482
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,814
when everyone else
is out with their friends.

483
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,514
You can come with me and Hillary.

484
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,124
I can?

485
00:25:21,904 --> 00:25:22,919
Sure.

486
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:24,153
Why not?

487
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,792
We'll be a threesome.

488
00:25:30,543 --> 00:25:31,550
Dinner's in ten.

489
00:25:31,673 --> 00:25:34,532
I have to dine and dash.
I got to meet the decorating committee.

490
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,279
I think I like activist Lori.
She reminds me of someone I know.

491
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,506
By the way, Mom,

492
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,534
I invited Jessi
to come to the dance with me.

493
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:44,202
- Lori...
- I know you don't like it,

494
00:25:44,322 --> 00:25:45,832
and believe me, I'm surprising myself,

495
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:48,287
but she's like a lost little
puppy or something.

496
00:25:48,453 --> 00:25:50,276
I just feel sorry for her.

497
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,713
Must be genetic.

498
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,773
She just used heredity
as an excuse not to obey her mother.

499
00:25:58,944 --> 00:26:00,140
Yeah, well, she's good.

500
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:03,612
The situation with Jessi is different
than it was with Kyle.

501
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,940
There's something about her
that worries you?

502
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,080
I couldn't discuss it even if
there were. That's my point.

503
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:14,263
Point made, although I think
Lori's instincts are pretty good.

504
00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:15,752
Must be genetic.

505
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,413
Whoa. Nice moves.

506
00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:22,306
I taught him everything
he knows, literally.

507
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:25,189
- Excited about your big date?
- Yes.

508
00:26:25,324 --> 00:26:28,194
Uh-oh. Here comes Dad's
fatherly advice about dating.

509
00:26:28,345 --> 00:26:30,074
Well, let's hope it lands
better on Kyle,

510
00:26:30,194 --> 00:26:31,858
seeing as how yours never happened.

511
00:26:33,223 --> 00:26:34,615
A dagger in the heart, Dad.

512
00:26:34,748 --> 00:26:36,268
You know, I'm really impressed that

513
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:38,747
your friend Andy helped
put the whole night together.

514
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:41,334
She probably only did it
so I wouldn't get off garbage duty.

515
00:26:41,706 --> 00:26:42,808
Somehow I doubt that.

516
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:45,280
Plus, if you hadn't felt it
necessary to steal...

517
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:46,800
- Borrow.
- Whatever.

518
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:48,257
You could be going with her.

519
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:50,375
Why would I want to go with her?

520
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,968
You're all crazy.

521
00:27:03,094 --> 00:27:04,100
What happened?

522
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:08,413
Principal Hooper called my mom,
and she came home early.

523
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,750
I'm grounded, I can't go to dance.

524
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,165
People actually came.

525
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:32,114
Hils, you are such a pessimist
about the human condition.

526
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,751
We got our message out there.
Of course people came.

527
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:37,815
Yeah, plus we sold our tickets
for half the price of the other dance.

528
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:39,471
Yeah, that helped.

529
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:42,745
What are we doing here again?

530
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,061
Supporting Lori.

531
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:46,614
Why?

532
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:49,709
Because the other night
I made out with Jessi

533
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:53,063
while Lori was in the next room
singing a song about our breakup.

534
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,067
Whoa, that's, uh...

535
00:27:56,548 --> 00:27:58,560
- that's a move worthy of me.
- Great.

536
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:01,048
Now I really feel good about myself.

537
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,109
Uh, I'm... I'm gonna need
something stronger if that's...

538
00:28:10,827 --> 00:28:13,201
When did you two hop
on the lesbian granola bus?

539
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:16,580
I don't know.
Hils, you want to give it a try?

540
00:28:16,724 --> 00:28:19,817
Yeah, I've always wanted
to be a granola lesbian...

541
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,493
... if only to never kiss
homophobic cheating jerks like you.

542
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,969
You busted your new moves yet?

543
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:43,420
I don't think I like dancing.

544
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:46,026
Because you're not feeling it,

545
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:49,555
which is understandable,
given your dateless status.

546
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,026
But you're more than welcome
to join me on clean-up duty.

547
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,809
These Sour Patch Kids are different.

548
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,456
They're extreme... like my punishment.

549
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,227
People, the Earth is not your trash can.

550
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
Ow.

551
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,518
Static electricity.

552
00:29:19,435 --> 00:29:21,930
An electrical charge
caused by an imbalance of electrons

553
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,460
on the surface of a material.

554
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:26,264
You like science.

555
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:27,772
I guess.

556
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:30,841
How did you know
how to fix Josh's radio?

557
00:29:31,444 --> 00:29:33,457
Sometimes I just know things.

558
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,036
Me, too.

559
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,157
You made it.

560
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:42,343
I snuck out.

561
00:29:42,571 --> 00:29:43,577
Hi, Declan.

562
00:29:44,423 --> 00:29:45,430
Hey.

563
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,709
- You thirsty?
- Sure.

564
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,624
- Hey.
- Hi.

565
00:29:57,766 --> 00:29:59,892
I see I'm not the only
workaholic in the company.

566
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,482
Oh, all work, no play.

567
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,657
Well, it looks like
your evil plan is working.

568
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,594
What?

569
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,286
Jessi. She and my daughter Lori
really hit it off.

570
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:13,738
Oh, yeah. That's great.

571
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:16,410
I'm going to the dance now to help out
Nicole. You can join us

572
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,618
and check out the budding
friendship for yourself.

573
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:20,623
Jessi's not there.

574
00:30:22,127 --> 00:30:24,311
I'm pretty sure she is.
Lori said she was going.

575
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,332
Social as ever, I see.

576
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,507
- You missed something.
- Where?

577
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,848
There.

578
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:47,074
Very funny.

579
00:30:50,704 --> 00:30:52,185
So how's the hot dates?

580
00:30:52,472 --> 00:30:55,339
I guess you'll just have
to see for yourself, won't you?

581
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:58,424
I hope the view from the garbage cans
is good enough.

582
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,948
- It's not really my scene anyway.
- What about it isn't your scene?

583
00:31:03,373 --> 00:31:05,728
- You know.
- You don't like gay people.

584
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,900
That's not what I meant.

585
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,918
Oh. I see. You're gay.

586
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,064
What? No.

587
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:16,191
It's cool, though.
I'm hip with the gays.

588
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:17,592
I'm not gay.

589
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:20,366
Bummer. It might make you cooler.

590
00:31:46,596 --> 00:31:48,115
- You're here.
- I am.

591
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,884
How? Why?

592
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:52,763
I snuck out.
Long live civil disobedience.

593
00:31:53,706 --> 00:31:54,902
Come on. Let's dance.

594
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:03,239
She's good.

595
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,112
Yeah.

596
00:32:06,564 --> 00:32:08,557
Shame you can't be out there.

597
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,064
Yeah.

598
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:13,470
I guess if you agreed to some
community service at my discretion,

599
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,299
I could lift your punishment
for one dance.

600
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,324
I don't know.
She looks a little busy with her dates.

601
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,223
Uh, somehow I think
she'll make the time.

602
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:30,339
Go.

603
00:32:54,926 --> 00:32:55,933
Go for it.

604
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,700
Oh. I think it's a hundred
degrees in here.

605
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,414
This is fun. Thank you for inviting me.

606
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:48,323
That's a really pretty necklace.

607
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,200
Thanks. It's a remnant
from my Declan days.

608
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:56,542
He gave it to you?

609
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,001
Yeah.

610
00:34:01,155 --> 00:34:03,130
Do you wish
that you were still with him?

611
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Honestly, sometimes.

612
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,561
We didn't end very well, so

613
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:12,771
there's always gonna be part of me
that wishes things were different.

614
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:15,913
But he's moved on, obviously.

615
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,384
Anyway, back to work.

616
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,696
You're a good dancer.

617
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:42,075
This part's easy.

618
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,223
- Slow dancing is...
- No.

619
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,203
Dancing with you.

620
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,900
I don't think Charlie's very happy
to see us dancing.

621
00:35:13,658 --> 00:35:15,652
Who cares what Charlie thinks?

622
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:18,296
Do you mean that?

623
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,287
You mean that.

624
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,052
Lori still wants to be with you.

625
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,004
I don't think so.

626
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:34,307
Do you still want to be with her?

627
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:36,601
I'm with you, aren't I?

628
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,187
You made it.

629
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,096
- Emily.
- Hi.

630
00:35:45,953 --> 00:35:46,997
We have a little problem.

631
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:51,748
- Jessi! What did I tell you?
- Oh!

632
00:35:51,886 --> 00:35:53,481
- Hey!
- Stay out of this.

633
00:35:54,327 --> 00:35:55,808
You're not supposed to be here.

634
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:57,383
You're hurting my arms.

635
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,722
- Emil, why don't we all...
- I'll handle this.

636
00:35:59,842 --> 00:36:00,843
Get your things.

637
00:36:01,098 --> 00:36:03,010
- You're coming home now.
- I don't want to.

638
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,024
You don't get to make those decisions.

639
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,636
- Did you see that?
- No.

640
00:36:08,356 --> 00:36:10,141
- The lights.
- What lights?

641
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:15,002
Oh.

642
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:18,823
Whoa.

643
00:36:24,554 --> 00:36:25,731
Jess, we're leaving.

644
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:28,063
You can't tell me what to do!

645
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:48,330
Doesn't look like the power's
gonna come back on.

646
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,893
It's for the best anyways.
It's pumpkin hour.

647
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,113
Time for me to get home,

648
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:55,322
unless I want to be
grounded until I'm 50.

649
00:36:56,169 --> 00:36:57,707
Well, I hope that doesn't happen.

650
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,720
I'd like to go out with you again,

651
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,936
before you're 50.

652
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,028
I'd like that, too.

653
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,825
Good night.

654
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,546
Good night.

655
00:37:28,057 --> 00:37:29,975
Go ahead.
Throw the trash at my feet again.

656
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,268
- What are you doing?
- I think it's called cleaning.

657
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:38,373
No. You're being nice.
You're never nice.

658
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:40,202
I'm totally nice.

659
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,731
You make fun of me, you put me down,

660
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:44,951
and you always have
to have the last word.

661
00:37:45,149 --> 00:37:47,276
I thought that was... our thing.

662
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,748
We have a thing?

663
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,793
Well, not like a "thing" thing,

664
00:37:51,947 --> 00:37:53,067
but you know...

665
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:54,529
a vibe.

666
00:37:55,347 --> 00:37:56,391
A pattern.

667
00:37:57,669 --> 00:37:58,676
A thing.

668
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,380
Yeah.

669
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,570
Cool.

670
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:06,243
Oh, yeah, your dates, they're...

671
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,842
Gay, yes.

672
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:12,340
Actually, I was gonna say
they're pretty cool guys.

673
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,816
Go ahead. Get in the last word.

674
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,906
No need.

675
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:32,787
Thwarted by an electrical snafu.

676
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:38,916
Other than the drama,
it was a pretty great night.

677
00:38:39,076 --> 00:38:40,443
You were certainly enjoying it.

678
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:42,648
Sarcasm, party one.

679
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:46,202
It's okay. I deserve it.

680
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:49,539
What, because,
on top of everything else,

681
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:53,155
you bailed on me right before
my first ever live performance?

682
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,467
Yeah. Not your best moment.

683
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,030
I'm really sorry, Lori.

684
00:38:58,223 --> 00:38:59,325
I wanted to be there.

685
00:38:59,476 --> 00:39:00,767
You were there.

686
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:03,697
And then... suddenly you weren't.

687
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,147
I can't explain what happened.

688
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,129
I've been in a bad place for so long,

689
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:13,859
and then Jessi was there, and

690
00:39:14,703 --> 00:39:16,715
somehow it was an escape from it all.

691
00:39:17,036 --> 00:39:18,593
She makes you feel better.

692
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,095
She makes me... forget.

693
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,324
Forget me?

694
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:27,350
I don't want to forget you.

695
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:30,644
But with everything else...

696
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,662
being with her
feels better than being alone.

697
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,224
What exactly happened

698
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:43,990
between you and Kyle?

699
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,432
I never understood
what went wrong with you two.

700
00:39:48,442 --> 00:39:49,638
Besides you...

701
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,289
Kyle was the only real friend
I ever had.

702
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,317
I guess...

703
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,563
we didn't trust each other
as much as we thought.

704
00:40:01,663 --> 00:40:03,201
Romance interrupted.

705
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,207
You and your words.

706
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,268
Let there be light.

707
00:40:10,905 --> 00:40:12,728
Ladies and gentlemen,

708
00:40:13,651 --> 00:40:14,847
boys and boys,

709
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:19,446
thank you so much
for coming out... literally...

710
00:40:19,642 --> 00:40:21,598
to this very gay event.

711
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,706
And by gay,

712
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,090
I... I don't... I don't mean happy.
I mean,

713
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,623
oh, so very homosexual.

714
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,897
Knock it off.

715
00:40:34,604 --> 00:40:35,952
Why? I'm just messing around.

716
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,252
No, you're being an idiot.

717
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:41,440
You should remember
who your friends are.

718
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,183
You're right.

719
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:49,938
I should.

720
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,085
Declan.

721
00:41:09,798 --> 00:41:10,804
What's up?

722
00:41:12,475 --> 00:41:13,747
I want to tell you everything.

723
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,860
I don't get it. Why now?

724
00:41:19,424 --> 00:41:21,905
There's someone else who knows
my secret. I thought

725
00:41:22,027 --> 00:41:24,096
- he was the only one I could rely on.
- Tom Foss.

726
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,613
How do you know that?

727
00:41:27,556 --> 00:41:29,236
I think there's something
you should see.

728
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,423
Saw the two of you together.
Started digging around.

729
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:43,624
He left these for me...

730
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:46,812
as a warning.

731
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,291
- A warning?
- To back off.

732
00:41:56,944 --> 00:42:00,198
- Foss did this?
- He obviously doesn't want me involved.

733
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:02,952
But I'm in this. I always have been.

734
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,595
If you want me to know the truth,

735
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,433
I'm ready to hear it.

736
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:12,337
Okay.
