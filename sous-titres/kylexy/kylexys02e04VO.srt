00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:02,398
Previously on Kyle XY.

2
00:00:02,557 --> 00:00:03,959
How are you not burned?

3
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,086
I... I don't know.

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,429
I don't want anyone to have
a reason to take me away.

5
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:10,620
No one else needs to know
that you're different.

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,000
I feel hurt and angry,
and if you want to break up,

7
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:16,564
- you're going to have to say it.
- I wanna break up.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,423
Doesn't matter anyway.
I've already erased you. Never happened.

9
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:20,767
What if I just wanna be normal?

10
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:22,887
I'm not gonna let you ruin
what we're trying to do!

11
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:24,145
I don't wanna do it anymore.

12
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:26,198
Now that's a well-balanced meal.

13
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:29,366
What the... This is a guys bathroom.

14
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:30,977
Relax. I have brothers.

15
00:00:31,075 --> 00:00:32,539
At least I'm in the right bathroom,

16
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,567
Miss... whatever your name is.

17
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:35,945
Andy Jensen.

18
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:38,896
Tonight's mine and Charlie's
two-year anniversary.

19
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,379
We've been through so much,
he's been so patient.

20
00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:42,609
I feel like I'm ready.

21
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:43,844
You're not gonna like this,

22
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:46,322
but I think there's something
you should know about Amanda.

23
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:47,769
What's going on?

24
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:49,429
It's a really stupid joke.

25
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:50,732
I slept with him.

26
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:52,416
This is what you wanted to tell me?

27
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:55,376
You didn't think I wanted
to hear it from you? You were wrong.

28
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,818
Get her into that family's life.

29
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,719
Destabilizing
the boy's support structure will

30
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:02,498
make him more vulnerable,
receptive to her.

31
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:06,536
I'm ready.

32
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:19,335
Life is made up of routines.

33
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:21,968
For as long as I lived with the Tragers,

34
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,933
my routine had been simple...

35
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:26,725
until now.

36
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:33,036
I wanted to explore
and develop my potential,

37
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:35,934
which meant strengthening
my mind and body

38
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,022
so I could use my abilities
without harming myself.

39
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:47,686
But I had to do it in secret.

40
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,716
The early morning and after-school
hours were the only times

41
00:01:56,796 --> 00:02:00,113
- I could meet with Tom Foss.
- Faster, faster. Pick it up.

42
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:02,277
I was the athlete in training.

43
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,412
I didn't come here to watch you walk it.

44
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,770
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up.

45
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:08,721
- Better.
- And he was my coach.

46
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:09,778
Faster!

47
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,377
<i>While I was finishing
my morning routine,</i>

48
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:15,185
<i>the family was just starting theirs.</i>

49
00:02:19,127 --> 00:02:21,649
I had to get home
before they knew I was gone.

50
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,762
Lori! Let's go!

51
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:36,213
Kyle?

52
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:38,183
Breakfast!

53
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:41,142
<i>But life is far from a perfect science.</i>

54
00:02:41,423 --> 00:02:45,024
Statistically speaking,
we're all bound to slip up.

55
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:55,805
Good morning.

56
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:57,166
Good morning.

57
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:58,739
Breakfast ready?

58
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:01,027
You okay?

59
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:04,159
- Just hungry.
- Then come eat.

60
00:03:06,197 --> 00:03:07,830
Be there in a minute.

61
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:14,211
<i>This was my life, my routine,</i>

62
00:03:14,857 --> 00:03:18,246
<i>and making it work was going to be
a lot harder than I thought.</i>

Season 2 Episode 4
- Balancing Act -

66
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:37,359
Is Josh still asleep?

67
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,200
You're kidding, right?

68
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:42,837
Stephen took him to take his driver's
test this morning.The first appointment.

69
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,602
That's right. I forgot.

70
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:47,090
How? He hasn't shut up
about it all week.

71
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:49,330
Hey, how'd it go?

72
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,503
You totally bombed, didn't you?

73
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:54,893
If by "bombed" you mean a direct hit,

74
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:56,077
as in I nailed it...

75
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:57,594
Did you pass?

76
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,644
Yes, I passed.

77
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:03,396
In fact, the instructor said I was
the best she'd ever tested.

78
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,052
- He was very impressive.
- Aw, way to go, Josh.

79
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:08,104
- Thanks.
- Let me see that.

80
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,838
God, that's frightening.

81
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:13,242
I'll get it.

82
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:16,060
You do realize
what this means, don't you?

83
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:17,488
You can drive.

84
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:20,017
Yes, my obvious friend, that is true.

85
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:21,652
But more importantly,

86
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,517
Dad gets to make good on his promise

87
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:24,906
of buying me a new car.

88
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:26,861
Oh, great. You remembered that.

89
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:29,760
Dad, it's for you.

90
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:32,893
A car.

91
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:34,995
That's a pretty big birthday present.

92
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:36,532
It sure is.

93
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:38,906
That's us. Soon,

94
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:41,522
we'll be the ones picking people up.

95
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:44,584
And after work,
I wanna go scope out some dealerships.

96
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:46,542
- Are you in?
- Absolutely.

97
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,857
For Dad.

98
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:53,382
Some light reading.

99
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:55,529
Okay.

100
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:58,144
Have a good day, guys.

101
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:07,599
Stephen, what is it?

102
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,656
That was the office.

103
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:12,746
The company was sold this morning.

104
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:15,204
Sold? I didn't know it was for sale.

105
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,668
Neither did I.

106
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,422
Some big conglomerate snatched us up.

107
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:21,266
Well, what does this mean?

108
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,300
It means...

109
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:26,545
I just lost my job.

110
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:31,368
Hi, Amanda.

111
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:34,348
I don't want to talk to you.

112
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:35,749
It's ok, I'll talk to you.

113
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:38,101
I mean I don't want you
to talk to me, either.

114
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,174
- I just wanted...
- You're still talking.

115
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:53,424
A little service here.

116
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:55,659
Hang on a sec.

117
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:57,591
You must just rake in the tips.

118
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,754
The extra 20 cents isn't worth it.

119
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,577
Fantasizing about your dream car?

120
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:07,602
Just narrowing down my choices.

121
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:09,819
You're actually getting a car?

122
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:12,248
It was my birthday this week,

123
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,591
and it's all systems go from my parents
and the state of Washington.

124
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,375
It's incredible who they let
behind the wheel these days.

125
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:19,527
Don't worry.

126
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,079
I brake for minors.

127
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:26,689
Did you clear things up with Amanda?

128
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,360
Didn't get a chance.

129
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:32,097
I saw you talking to her.

130
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:34,313
No talking allowed.

131
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:38,125
She'll get over it,
just give her a little real estate.

132
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:41,243
You know, give her some space.

133
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:51,245
Is space what you wanted from Declan?

134
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,727
What I want from Declan
is an explanation.

135
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,266
Or a distraction.

136
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:58,726
I need to do something
to get him off my mind.

137
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,978
How about something from here?

138
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:05,415
I'm not really
the "activity board" type.

139
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:08,518
I mean, have you seen the people
who post these flyers?

140
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:09,982
Totally hideous.

141
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:19,581
The guitar, on the other hand,
is a very sexy instrument.

142
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,768
What's the latest?

143
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,931
Everybody's still in shock.

144
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:35,058
Not even a hint this might happen?

145
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,340
I thought things were going great.

146
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:39,909
I mean, I was expecting
a big bonus at the end of the year,

147
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:41,416
but now I'm looking for a job.

148
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,543
You'll find something.

149
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,735
Well, hon, at my level,
jobs aren't easy to come by.

150
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,128
Everything else is a big cut in pay.

151
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,592
I got a lot of good contacts out there.

152
00:07:59,432 --> 00:08:01,092
I'll put the word out right away.

153
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:04,307
We should tell the kids.

154
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,318
No. There's no point in worrying them.

155
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:10,132
Let me line something up first.

156
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,958
What are you doing?

157
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:44,811
- Giving you space?
- No, you're staring at me.

158
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,454
I just want to say one thing.

159
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:50,704
You may want to say it,

160
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:52,914
but I'm not ready to hear it.

161
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:17,211
When are you looking for this...

162
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:20,339
offensive and irresponsible
gas-guzzling heap?

163
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:22,063
Right after my shift, with Kyle.

164
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:25,009
Looks like you're flying solo.

165
00:09:26,352 --> 00:09:27,703
There goes your wingman.

166
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,625
What are we doing?

167
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,055
Finding equipment.

168
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,164
- For what?
- Your next challenge.

169
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:40,153
Balance,

170
00:09:40,652 --> 00:09:41,771
coordination,

171
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,156
and weights.

172
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:47,878
You had me run 7,642 steps this week.

173
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:49,569
Now I'm gonna be lifting cement?

174
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,725
Baylin's body gave out because
it couldn't keep up with his mind.

175
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:56,069
Baylin's body failed internally.

176
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:58,732
Weight training won't stop that
from happening to me.

177
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,587
Mental and physical strength
are connected.

178
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:05,949
Look, I don't mind doing the work,
but do you even have a plan?

179
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:08,022
We should look at Baylin's journals.

180
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,160
- He may knew a better way.
- I saw his journals.

181
00:10:10,246 --> 00:10:13,235
It's formulas, equations
you can learn that yourself.

182
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:16,154
But this kind of conditioning,

183
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:18,149
I can teach you.

184
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:21,224
- What else do we need?
- Grab that.

185
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,789
That's right.

186
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:26,403
Inside.

187
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:36,648
Looking for something?

188
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:39,308
The guitar Dad got me.
Have you seen it?

189
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,631
Well, I thing we sold it
at the garage sale, which,

190
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:43,819
if I remember correctly, you told me to.

191
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:45,443
Oh, yeah. Crap.

192
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:48,584
Well, if you wanna play,
I'm sure you can borrow your dad's.

193
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:49,787
I guess.

194
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:53,407
Did you ever feel like
you're not interesting?

195
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:55,300
Like you hope people
look at you and say,

196
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,686
"Hey, that Lori Trager,
she's really good at...

197
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:59,031
whatever."

198
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:04,255
Everything I ever tried to be good at
is in this closet.

199
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:08,219
And most of it is
in the original wrapping.

200
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:11,954
Why do I get the feeling
this sudden interest in guitar

201
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:13,695
has something to do with Declan.

202
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:16,614
Because you're a super psychologist?

203
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,616
- Have you tried talking to him?
- Yes!

204
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:24,127
Did you try "warm and fuzzy" or
go straight for "agro-crazy teen girl?"

205
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:27,989
I'll take "agro-crazy" for a thousand.

206
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,915
I just want to know
what happened with us.

207
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,099
Then really talk to him.

208
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:37,883
You might not like what you hear, but
you can get some closure and move on.

209
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:41,776
How would girls survive
without a mom like you?

210
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:43,296
They get by.

211
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:45,591
Have you seen Kyle?
I'm supposed to bring him

212
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:47,091
to buy Josh a present.

213
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:50,055
I saw him rush out after school,
but I don't know where he was going.

214
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:53,563
I love you.

215
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:54,706
I love you.

216
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:09,956
Two thousand...

217
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,697
four hundred...

218
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:12,900
and one.

219
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:15,592
Square it.

220
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:25,401
5 million, 10 hundred...

221
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:29,733
You lost focus!

222
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:39,595
- I was trying.
- Well, try harder.

223
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:42,572
An ordinary mind can convince
the body to withstand the most

224
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,643
extreme conditions.
You should be able to handle more.

225
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,144
Like carrying 200 pounds
while doing a math drill?

226
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:50,962
- I know what I'm doing.
- Except you're not the one doing it.

227
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:53,130
I've done a lot worse.

228
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,489
What do you mean?

229
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,967
I was in a recon extraction
unit in the service.

230
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:06,772
What's that?

231
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,035
That is "military speak"

232
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,188
for rescue and torture.

233
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:14,133
Which one were you trained for?

234
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:17,743
We're done.

235
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,451
After I leave,

236
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:48,841
do you just stay here?

237
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:52,641
It must get lonely.

238
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:57,358
In your old apartment, I saw a picture.

239
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:00,271
A woman and a little girl.

240
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:03,611
Are they your family?

241
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:07,395
They were.

242
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:13,221
You're not together anymore.

243
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:17,258
They were killed by a drunk driver.

244
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,424
Look, you should go.

245
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:29,877
They'll be looking for you.

246
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:36,985
You know, if you ever need anything...

247
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:41,769
You're here all alone,
and this neighborhood seems kind of...

248
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:43,478
Don't worry about it.

249
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:50,260
I'm just saying if you're ever
in trouble, you can call me.

250
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:55,326
Okay, don't call me.

251
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:56,861
Text message.

252
00:14:57,336 --> 00:14:58,603
Three stars.

253
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:01,183
All right?

254
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:06,082
Go home.

255
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:49,051
You're late.

256
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:51,204
- I'm sorry.
- Again?

257
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:52,977
I lost track of time.

258
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,904
Kyle, you know we have
rules about curfew.

259
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:56,173
If you're gonna break them,

260
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,747
I expect a phone call.

261
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:00,038
You're right.

262
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:02,178
I didn't mean to worry you.

263
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:05,720
I was putting away some laundry.

264
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,404
I found this in your room.

265
00:16:08,178 --> 00:16:09,580
From the fire.

266
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:11,909
I don't think you should
leave it lying around.

267
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:18,480
I'll get rid of it.

268
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:24,708
Well...

269
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:25,950
good night.

270
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:28,364
Night.

271
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:01,851
Hello?

272
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:06,189
Who is this?

273
00:17:22,936 --> 00:17:24,614
Notice the way she struts?

274
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,451
You'd need something

275
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:29,205
sleek and sexy to get her.

276
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:31,833
A luxury import,

277
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,258
definitely.

278
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,453
Pickup truck.

279
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:41,265
And her?

280
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:43,583
Miss Perky?

281
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,514
Convertible.

282
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,429
Goth girl.

283
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,311
Batmobile.

284
00:17:51,913 --> 00:17:53,591
Please, challenge me.

285
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:55,111
Okay.

286
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:57,533
- What about you?
- Me?

287
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:00,667
- A hearse.
- You are sick.

288
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,931
I'm so sorry.

289
00:18:10,374 --> 00:18:11,799
It's been one of those days.

290
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:13,921
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.

291
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,899
- Your jacket isn't.
- Don't worry about it.

292
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,974
I was just so focused on my phone.

293
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,634
Please let me pay to have that cleaned.

294
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,377
Oh, no, really, it's not...

295
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,619
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

296
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:28,582
I... I don't think so.

297
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:31,970
Have you ever lectured
at U.W. in child development, like,

298
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:33,695
two or three years ago?

299
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:35,626
Actually, I speak there fairly often.

300
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:38,983
I knew I recognized you.
I was finishing grad school.

301
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:41,452
It's Trager, right? Nicole?

302
00:18:41,863 --> 00:18:45,190
- I can't believe you remember.
- Oh, you were so great.

303
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,354
Okay, now I'm definitely
paying for the cleaning.

304
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,061
- I'm Emily. Hi.
- Hi.

305
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:54,687
You know, I have to run, but please
let me know when you get the bill.

306
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:57,014
I insist on reimbursing you.

307
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,451
- You're very kind.
- Well, call me.

308
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:00,862
I will.

309
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:12,824
Where's Josh?

310
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:14,668
- Upstairs.
- We're clear.

311
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:15,944
Put it in the fridge.

312
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:20,114
Please tell me you're not
taking him car shopping.

313
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:25,477
A car is a big responsibility.

314
00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:26,924
Josh is ready.

315
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:30,431
But gas is really expensive these days.

316
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:32,644
I'm not sure he can afford the gas.

317
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,072
He'll be fine.

318
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:35,948
But with your recent car trouble...

319
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:40,413
you're gonna...
need a new engine.

320
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:42,413
So I'll get a new engine.

321
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,276
There are plenty of mechanics out there.

322
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:46,228
What if repairs
take longer than expected?

323
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:47,728
Then you'd have to borrow my car,

324
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:50,285
and my car doesn't get nearly
the mileage your car gets.

325
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:51,700
Nicole, I made a promise.

326
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:54,532
It's just... bad timing.

327
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,835
You know, we'll talk about this later.

328
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:05,627
Sorry you lost your job.

329
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:09,447
Cars are expensive, and...

330
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:12,360
you can't afford one for Josh
since you're out of work, and...

331
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:14,502
Nicole doesn't make as much as you.

332
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:16,187
I mean...

333
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,609
get as good gas mileage as your car.

334
00:20:21,402 --> 00:20:23,803
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm glad you know.

335
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,932
Walking around here
the last couple of days,

336
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:27,780
keeping a secret just...

337
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:29,627
it feels awful.

338
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:31,605
Must have been tough.

339
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:34,378
Yeah, but don't worry.
Everything's gonna work out.

340
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:36,734
What are you gonna tell Josh
about the car?

341
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,561
I'm not sure.

342
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,534
My dad was notorious
for breaking promises.

343
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:44,216
I don't want to be that kind of father.

344
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:46,134
You're not.

345
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,975
You're a great father.

346
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,567
What's up with that?

347
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:06,116
I'm taking lessons.

348
00:21:08,022 --> 00:21:09,359
Well, see ya.

349
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:11,528
Is it so impossible
to have a conversation?

350
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:14,157
We're having one right now.

351
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:15,422
Don't do that.

352
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,334
You can't just blow me off.

353
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:22,208
You can't just end what we had
and move on like it didn't matter.

354
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:23,509
You erased me!

355
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:26,413
I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean it.

356
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:31,021
Look, we can't really talk here.

357
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:34,719
Why don't you come over later?
I'll be home around 4.

358
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,715
And if you don't show up then
I'll know there's nothing left to say.

359
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,631
Police are still searching for any clues

360
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:55,829
that may shed light
on the murder of a hunter

361
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:58,955
found in the woods near Victor Falls
almost a month ago.

362
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:00,815
The victim's throat was crushed.

363
00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:03,332
So far police have
no motive for the killing,

364
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:05,197
and no suspects have been named.

365
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:13,246
It's Saturday.

366
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:14,859
I know.
I want you to come in.

367
00:22:15,524 --> 00:22:17,090
I thought I had weekends to myself.

368
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:19,972
If you slack off for one day,
you'll stop making progress.

369
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:21,587
This isn't a game.

370
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:24,143
It's about your survival.

371
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:25,780
I'll be there.

372
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:32,544
Josh, stop hitting the horn.
The neighbors are gonna freak.

373
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:34,643
You are the neighbor. Relax.

374
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:36,862
I just wanna hear her purr.

375
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,276
Naughty. Let me guess.

376
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:44,180
.357 magnum, about 5,000 horsepower?

377
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:46,279
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

378
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:47,368
Of course.

379
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:55,143
Just the guy I was looking for.

380
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,839
You ready for tonight?

381
00:22:57,481 --> 00:22:58,481
Tonight?

382
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:00,689
Dude, my birthday dinner at La Scala.

383
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:04,198
Killer calamari,
awesome shrimp, garlic everything.

384
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:05,978
It sounds good.

385
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:09,104
Kyle, I'm not sensing
your excitement here.

386
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:11,890
This isn't just dinner.
I get my new ride.

387
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:14,988
That's a huge lift
to both our social lives.

388
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:18,672
Dinner's at 6.
Bring your "A" game.

389
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,871
He's really excited about his birthday.

390
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:28,558
- About Charlie...
- Kyle.

391
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:30,407
I should have told you
what was going on.

392
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:35,903
Yeah, well, being someone's friend
isn't about what you should have done.

393
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:39,813
It's about what you do.

394
00:23:40,563 --> 00:23:41,811
I know you're hurt,

395
00:23:42,576 --> 00:23:44,586
but you always look
for the best in people.

396
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,567
Don't ever lose that.

397
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,892
Where the hell is he going?

398
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:29,706
I don't have time for this.
Josh's birthday dinner is tonight.

399
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:31,469
Then start climbing.

400
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:35,051
From weight training to this?

401
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,308
What happened?

402
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,801
Your anxious about something.
Is it Zzyzx?

403
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:44,137
Zzyzx is gone.

404
00:25:44,902 --> 00:25:47,302
Stop the analyzing, and climb.

405
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:55,630
Hey, buddy.
You got a second?

406
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:58,582
Sure. Just getting ready
for the big night.

407
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,412
Josh, what happened to your room?

408
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,579
What do you mean?

409
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,150
It's clean.

410
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,782
I just got tired of living
in a mess all the time.

411
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,527
I'm impressed.

412
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,583
Is Kyle back?

413
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:15,303
Uh, I don't think so.

414
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:17,480
Listen, I gotta talk
to you about something.

415
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:19,407
It's like he doesn't care anymore.

416
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,785
The guy's been AWOL all week long.

417
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:25,062
- Has he?
- Yeah. Where have you been?

418
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:28,021
I don't know.

419
00:26:28,148 --> 00:26:30,403
I guess I've been
a little AWOL myself this week.

420
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:33,309
I just wish things would go
back to the way they were.

421
00:26:34,753 --> 00:26:36,474
Yeah, tell me about it.

422
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:40,128
Listen, Josh, things change.

423
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:42,592
That can be hard to accept.

424
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,288
But what you need to believe is that
things will work themselves out...

425
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,491
in the end.

426
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,510
About the car...

427
00:26:57,661 --> 00:27:00,029
- What time is it?
- You're fine. Keep going.

428
00:27:02,896 --> 00:27:05,126
You're almost there.
That's right. Keep going.

429
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,247
The way you've built
this wall is impossible.

430
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:13,070
Not for you.

431
00:27:14,961 --> 00:27:17,446
- If I fall...
- If you fall, I've got you.

432
00:27:18,202 --> 00:27:19,157
Trust me.

433
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:37,728
Again.

434
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:39,493
Do it!

435
00:27:59,732 --> 00:28:01,404
Hey. I'm glad you called.

436
00:28:01,503 --> 00:28:03,247
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

437
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:06,275
- Great house.
- Thanks.

438
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:07,852
So, what do I owe you?

439
00:28:09,045 --> 00:28:11,768
$26.

440
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:13,298
Expensive cup of coffee.

441
00:28:13,486 --> 00:28:15,142
Make yourself at home.
I'll get my purse.

442
00:28:15,222 --> 00:28:16,560
Thank you.

443
00:28:36,877 --> 00:28:39,730
- Okay. Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

444
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:41,987
This was really so nice of you.

445
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:43,954
And I have to confess,

446
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:46,711
I actually had another
reason for stopping by.

447
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,502
My sister Jessi,

448
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,129
she's been having some problems,

449
00:28:51,256 --> 00:28:53,299
more than just
the typical teenage things,

450
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,836
and I was hoping that
you might be able to sit down with her.

451
00:28:55,922 --> 00:28:59,231
Oh. Well, unfortunately,
I'm not in private practice,

452
00:28:59,316 --> 00:29:01,631
but I'd be happy to recommend
another therapist.

453
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:07,134
It's just...

454
00:29:08,044 --> 00:29:10,231
Our parents abandoned us
when we were young,

455
00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:12,674
and I was left to raise Jessi by myself.

456
00:29:13,248 --> 00:29:15,178
I've just been having
a really hard time lately.

457
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:18,580
And unfortunately, there's a history of
mental illness in the family.

458
00:29:21,335 --> 00:29:23,613
I just don't know where to turn anymore.

459
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:26,006
And you were just so warm.

460
00:29:26,086 --> 00:29:28,221
I know that you would be
so good for Jessi.

461
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,172
It's just a shame that
you can't see patients on the side.

462
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:39,736
You know, I...

463
00:29:39,883 --> 00:29:41,755
I think I might be able to help you.

464
00:29:44,161 --> 00:29:45,491
That would be great.

465
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,565
It's Hollander.

466
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,517
Jessi's got herself a therapist.

467
00:29:56,075 --> 00:29:58,129
Don't get discouraged.

468
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:00,050
The jump is too far.

469
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,421
You just gotta trust yourself,

470
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:02,729
believe that you can do it.

471
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:04,233
I know that you can.

472
00:30:05,364 --> 00:30:07,206
Why do you think I push you so hard?

473
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:08,989
I don't wanna let you down.

474
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:10,661
It's not about that.

475
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:13,658
You just... You keep trying,
do your best.

476
00:30:13,738 --> 00:30:14,797
You'll get there.

477
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:17,309
And that jump is too far...

478
00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:18,419
for now.

479
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,497
I'll add a few holes.
You can work your way up.

480
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:22,477
Okay.

481
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:24,900
- I better go.
- Do you want a ride home?

482
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:26,076
No, thanks.

483
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:27,183
This is faster.

484
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,531
We should go.

485
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:37,893
Kyle's not back yet.

486
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:39,135
Where is he?

487
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,262
Do we ever know where he is anymore?

488
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,636
Let's just give him a few more minutes.

489
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:10,319
Sorry, Josh, we gotta go now,
otherwise we'll lose our reservation.

490
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:13,160
I don't care anymore.

491
00:32:32,048 --> 00:32:33,327
Don't move!

492
00:32:42,568 --> 00:32:44,449
Wait! You can't reach this from there.

493
00:33:00,585 --> 00:33:01,876
Okay, let go. I got you.

494
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:05,959
Trust me.

495
00:33:13,512 --> 00:33:14,655
I got you.

496
00:33:43,252 --> 00:33:45,330
Save it. I'm tired of your excuses.

497
00:33:46,252 --> 00:33:47,629
I promise I'll make it up to you.

498
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:49,511
Your promises don't mean anything.

499
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:52,553
You know, I can deal
with not getting a car,

500
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:55,516
'cause I thought
I still had my best friend.

501
00:33:57,857 --> 00:33:59,503
I guess I was wrong.

502
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:18,982
We need to talk.

503
00:34:21,183 --> 00:34:22,659
We know what's going on.

504
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:23,963
You do?

505
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:27,122
We understand you're still adjusting,
but being part of this family

506
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:28,340
is about trust.

507
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,123
Now, if you don't want
to live here with us...

508
00:34:31,382 --> 00:34:32,557
Why would you think that?

509
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:33,804
You're hardly here.

510
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:36,226
You missed Josh's birthday.

511
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,599
And we know that you've
spoken to Mr. Taylor.

512
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,172
Mr. Taylor?

513
00:34:40,284 --> 00:34:41,918
Your cell phone rang the other day.

514
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:44,267
The caller I.D. said it was from T.

515
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,870
Was he calling because

516
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,484
you don't want to stay?

517
00:34:48,877 --> 00:34:50,770
Of course I want to stay.

518
00:34:54,311 --> 00:34:56,776
I know I've been
distracted lately, but...

519
00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:01,234
I never meant to give you the impression
that I didn't want to be here.

520
00:35:03,158 --> 00:35:06,654
You know how committed
we are to you being part of the family.

521
00:35:07,498 --> 00:35:09,674
We need to know you feel the same way.

522
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:20,567
Nothing is more important to me.

523
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:40,095
Rough night last night.

524
00:35:42,627 --> 00:35:44,226
Josh is still mad at me.

525
00:35:46,038 --> 00:35:47,570
He's disappointed.

526
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:51,436
Feels like all I do these days
is disappoint people.

527
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,472
I know that feeling.

528
00:35:54,927 --> 00:35:57,311
I just wish I could have
gotten him that car.

529
00:35:58,554 --> 00:36:00,669
I wish there was some way
I could make it up to him.

530
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:05,304
I had this great old junker in college.

531
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,434
Junker?

532
00:36:06,608 --> 00:36:08,267
Yeah, this crappy old car.

533
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:11,326
I remember the day I bought it.

534
00:36:11,425 --> 00:36:13,982
Well they practically
gave it to me for free.

535
00:36:15,322 --> 00:36:18,261
Now that would have been
the perfect starter car for Josh.

536
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:20,990
I think I know where we can find one.

537
00:36:24,027 --> 00:36:25,289
Watch your step.

538
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:27,453
Okay, now.

539
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,378
What is this?

540
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:34,903
It's your new car.

541
00:36:43,746 --> 00:36:44,905
So what do you think?

542
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:46,095
This is...

543
00:36:47,017 --> 00:36:48,861
the coolest thing I've ever seen!

544
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,643
It doesn't run right now,
but we're gonna fix it up.

545
00:36:51,729 --> 00:36:52,897
Where'd you get it?

546
00:36:53,008 --> 00:36:55,529
Well, you can thank Kyle here.
He found it.

547
00:36:56,538 --> 00:36:58,530
I thought you were too busy.

548
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:00,939
Hey, this isn't just benefiting you.

549
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,926
It's a huge lift for both
our social lives.

550
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,012
Thought the three of us
could work on it.

551
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:09,005
Dad, you don't know how to fix up a car.

552
00:37:09,091 --> 00:37:12,153
Well, that's true,
but Kyle just read the manual.

553
00:37:13,247 --> 00:37:14,378
Here, check it out.

554
00:37:55,989 --> 00:37:57,465
What song is that?

555
00:37:58,141 --> 00:37:59,186
Song?

556
00:37:59,395 --> 00:38:00,686
You're too kind.

557
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:03,117
It's G,

558
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:05,760
D, and C.

559
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:08,760
Beyond that, it's the great unknown.

560
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:12,003
It sounds good so far.

561
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:13,589
Thanks.

562
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:15,163
Can I try?

563
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:17,155
Knock yourself out.

564
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:32,104
Each string had a particular sound.

565
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:34,711
Like a mathematical equation,
it was just a matter

566
00:38:34,797 --> 00:38:37,306
of recognizing patterns
and familiar shapes.

567
00:38:37,761 --> 00:38:41,584
Finding the right formations would
translate into musical notes.

568
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:45,525
Finally,
something you're not amazing at.

569
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:47,407
I never thought I'd see that day.

570
00:39:11,661 --> 00:39:12,707
Get out.

571
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,523
I'm just kidding.

572
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:18,815
Seriously, though, give it back.

573
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:22,036
So what's your song about?

574
00:39:22,712 --> 00:39:24,212
New beginnings.

575
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:25,479
And Declan.

576
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:27,267
Mainly Declan.

577
00:39:27,403 --> 00:39:29,050
I'm trying to eviscerate his name.

578
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:30,427
It's very therapeutic.

579
00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:32,579
- So you guys are...
- Over?

580
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:34,275
It appears so.

581
00:39:34,952 --> 00:39:36,144
I'm sorry.

582
00:39:37,423 --> 00:39:38,358
Don't be.

583
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,301
Who knows what he's up to these days.

584
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:01,559
Sweet car.

585
00:40:02,282 --> 00:40:03,631
It's not the greatest?

586
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:06,866
Happy birthday.

587
00:40:07,307 --> 00:40:08,980
You didn't have to get me anything.

588
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:10,185
I know.

589
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:12,067
It was on sale.

590
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:14,285
I didn't know what you'd like,

591
00:40:14,365 --> 00:40:16,575
but I couldn't bear myself
to buy those flaps with the

592
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:17,891
naked ladies on them.

593
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:20,033
I love these. They're awesome.

594
00:40:22,024 --> 00:40:23,345
Wanna check it out?

595
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:27,070
Cool.

596
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:35,337
So what kind of girl do you think
I can get with this car?

597
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:37,857
The kind who appreciates potential.

598
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:56,681
How long has it been?

599
00:41:03,307 --> 00:41:05,139
Ten years next month.

600
00:41:08,644 --> 00:41:10,107
You were the drunk driver.

601
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:17,952
When you told me what happened to them,

602
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,657
your heart rate doubled,
and your body temperature rose.

603
00:41:22,786 --> 00:41:24,138
It doesn't matter. I just...

604
00:41:24,237 --> 00:41:25,712
wanna say I'm sorry.

605
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:32,147
I wanna...

606
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:34,889
thank you for coming back to help me.

607
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:38,064
You can count on me...

608
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,018
like I count on you.

609
00:41:42,477 --> 00:41:43,903
But here's the thing.

610
00:41:44,825 --> 00:41:47,161
I can tell when you're
not being truthful.

611
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:49,571
So if there's something else out there,

612
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,743
something you know could
bring danger into my life,

613
00:41:53,284 --> 00:41:54,723
I need you to tell me.

614
00:41:56,037 --> 00:41:57,857
There's nothing
to worry about right now.

615
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:00,913
Let's get back to work.

616
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:13,967
We all struggle to find
the right path to take in life.

617
00:42:15,664 --> 00:42:18,197
It's not always easy
to know what that is

618
00:42:18,308 --> 00:42:20,324
or where it will lead us.

619
00:42:22,525 --> 00:42:24,211
In the end, it's the people in our lives

620
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,816
that provide us the balance
to help us make it through.
