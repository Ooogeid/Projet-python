00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
************

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,650
It's a text from Amanda.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,340
Latnok. They have her.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,790
- You're leaving with Sarah tonight?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,730
It's good to travel light.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,570
I think there's
something wrong with Kyle.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,950
He's in trouble. I can't leave.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,250
I don't know with me or with what we're
supposed to be or not be, but it's in your hands.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,100
I think that means that
we shouldn't be together.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,570
What you need is a hot
and sweaty mack session.

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,310
With who?

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,980
Who cares? Just rebound.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,660
Oh,my god.

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,950
No. No.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,210
No,that's OK. Go back
to your bathroom fiesta.

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,370
Lori!

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,140
My prom night's turning out
to be a G-rated experience.

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,490
You were hoping for an R?

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,980
You're the one who didn't want to.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,980
You didn't want to,either.

21
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,580
It'll happen when it's right.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,100
When everything comes together in the
moment,we'll feel it. We'll just know.

23
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,990
Sarah?

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,060
That spiked punch must have
really done a number on me.

25
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,720
You'll feel better in the morning.

26
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,520
I want to thank you,Kyle.
My night was perfect.

27
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,710
Sweet dreams.

28
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,400
You took Amanda!

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,680
She won't remember a thing.

30
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,380
Don't you ever go near her again!

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,610
We're not the enemy,Kyle.

32
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,170
We just want to know you, work with you.

33
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,840
I'll never be part of this.

34
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,940
See you around.

35
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,690
Thirty-seven dollars and 26 cents.

36
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,640
That's it? I worked a double today.

37
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,970
Eight hours minus lunch and two
breaks,that's $5. 32 an hour.

38
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,990
I need to get a new job.

39
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,310
I've got to clean up the
back and then we can go.

40
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,550
OK.

41
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,760
Are you all right?

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,190
Amanda?

43
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,410
Kyle?

44
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,930
How'd you get by me?

45
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,150
Amanda,wait!

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,710
Kyle,help!

47
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,000
- Amanda!
- Kyle!

48
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,700
It's too late.

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,910

50
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,910

51
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,790
<font color=#00FFFF>Kyle
XY Season03 Episode02</font>

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,990
I felt like it was really happening.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,820
It's anxiety.

54
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,660
Latnok really put you
through the wringer.

55
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,010
And even though she was never in any real jeopardy,
you still experienced the trauma of losing her.

56
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,120
I still can't get over
what they did to you.

57
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,360
Listen,Kyle,could you ask
Jessi to have Sarah call me?

58
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,910
I've left her a dozen messages and I want
to talk to her about this Latnok thing.

59
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,550
I've been trying to meet
up with her all week.

60
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,490
I want to see her before they leave.

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,870
I hope they're OK.

62
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,000
This can't be easy.

63
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,590
Let's face it. Sarah
does sound a little weird.

64
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,870
Latnok put her through
a lot in her life.

65
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,800
And she was right about them.

66
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,600
They didn't even listen when Adam
Baylin told them to stay away.

67
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,670
You think they'll listen to you?

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,710
I don't know.

69
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,840
I guess that's why I'm
having the nightmares.

70
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,670
Maybe Foss could take
care of it,Zzyzx style.

71
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,570
I knew never told him.

72
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,590
You're implying I'm not
man enough to handle it?

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,690
That stings a little,Stephen.

74
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,110
You're kidding me,right?

75
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,460
Kyle,you ready for some
summer street fair fun?

76
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,870
Josh Trager bus is leaving in five.

77
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,590
The Josh Trager bus still
needs a new fuel pump.

78
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,150
Right. The actual bus,then.

79
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,210
- Good day,parents.
- Good day.

80
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,540
What is up with him?

81
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,340
No idea.

82
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,320
A total disaster. Best friend
making out with ex-boyfriend.

83
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,050
What did they say about it?

84
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,840
Nothing. I've been dodging
both of them all week.

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,970
So,um,how many songs
have you written about it?

86
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,990
Nine. That's why I called you.

87
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,280
That's why you called me?

88
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,610
To exploit me for my musical genius?

89
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,470
Yeah. I mean,that's OK,
right,exploiting you?

90
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,800
Yeah. Yeah. No,I thought maybe
you,uh, you called for another reason.

91
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,760
Like what?

92
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,950
Like uh... Maybe you
wanted to hang out with me.

93
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,710
What would make you that.

94
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,310
Well,I don't know.Because
I'm smart,I'm clever.

95
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,720
And I'm intuitive. And you're blushing.

96
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,080
- I'm so not blushing.
- Totally blushing.

97
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,710
Crap. Are you going
to make me ask you out?

98
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,850
Uh,depends. Do you want to?

99
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,590
No. I was kind of hoping for the
traditional gender roles here.

100
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,780
Oh,the guy asks the girl out.

101
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,040
- The girl plays hard to get.
- Something like that.

102
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,000
How about this? The guy asks the daughter
of his boss and the boss kicks the guy's ass.

103
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,050
You're afraid of my dad.

104
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,490
Well,your dad technically holds
the keys to my future in his hand.

105
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,120
But I could ask him, you know,first.

106
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,500
You would do that?

107
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,350
I mean,if we're being traditional...

108
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,320
OK,no,yeah,all right. It's settled.

109
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,600
Operation Date With
Lori Trager is in effect.

110
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,510
Hey,Amanda,it's me.

111
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,760
I think I'm in the right
spot, but you're not here.

112
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,860
Just give me a call when you get this.

113
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,550
Sorry I'm late. I got a late start
this morning. I wasn't feeling well.

114
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,570
I came to talk to your mom.

115
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,090
She hasn't been returning my calls.

116
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,010
Maybe she doesn't want to talk to you.

117
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,020
Why wouldn't she?

118
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,910
I don't know. She's not
really a talkative person.

119
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,410
You know,she keeps to herself a lot.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,900
I understand. Still,this is important.

121
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,230
She's not here.

122
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,490
I'm happy to wait. May I come in?

123
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,100
******

124
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,080
Jessi,is everything OK?

125
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,330
Yeah,never better.

126
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,810
I know this is a difficult transition.

127
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,540
I don't think you know anything,
Nicole. I think you should go.

128
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,850
Jessi,I'm coming inside.

129
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,370
Suit yourself.

130
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,120
Please don't tell Kyle.

131
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,160
You feeling OK?

132
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,950
It's this stupid headache
I've had all week.

133
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,500
It's the world's longest
spiked punch hangover.

134
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,930
Let's get you some water.

135
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,020
You think they can tell?

136
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,880
- Tell what?
- Tell that... you know.

137
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,900
That you're a man now?

138
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,800
When you say it like
that it sounds stupid.

139
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,140
It is stupid.

140
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,430
A girl's considered a woman
when she gets her period.

141
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,450
Real nice. Real manly.

142
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,580
I just wonder if anyone
can tell the difference.

143
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,160
You didn't tell anyone,did you?

144
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,580
- I said I wouldn't.
- Good. Don't.

145
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,490
Did either of you
drink the punch at prom?

146
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,660
I share enough germs with this
one. No need to take on more.

147
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,410
They had already confiscated it when I
heard the good news about it being spiked.

148
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,810
I don't know what was in it,
but it really messed me up.

149
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,690
I can't remember anything
about the end of the night.

150
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,450
I really hope I didn't embarrass
myself at the after party.

151
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,280
You weren't at the after party.

152
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,090
We were there,weren't we?

153
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,680
- Of course you were. Andi just didn't see you.
- But I...

154
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,320
Nothing embarrassing other
than being passed out.

155
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,020
Well,look,a psychic. Come on,honey.

156
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,490
Honey?

157
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,500
Is there something I should know?

158
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,110
No. Nothing.

159
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,800
You're keeping a secret.

160
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,210
Apparently,more than one.

161
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,430
I'm just helping Kyle
out with a problem.

162
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,110
A lying to your girlfriend
about wh on prom night problem?

163
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,220
It's a long story.

164
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,770
Which you were going to tell me when?

165
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,150
Never. A man is bound by his honor.

166
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,780
Oh,for the love of God!

167
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,690
Did you want me to continue?

168
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,340
Yes,please.

169
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,170
Let's move on from all the secret stuff.

170
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,030
You'll come into a sudden windfall.

171
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,410
Maybe you can go buy yourself
some more honor,honey.

172
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,230
Amanda?

173
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,780
- Amanda!
- What?

174
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,070
- Where were you? I didn't see you.
- I went to find a garbage can.

175
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,010
What's going on?

176
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,170
- I thou for a second.
- You're on edge.

177
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,460
- There's something you're not telling me.
- Amanda,I...

178
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,900
Is it about the after party because
Josh and Andi were being weird.

179
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,800
Did something happen?

180
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,000
You have to tell me the truth!

181
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,050
I came out of the school after
getting your bag and you weren't there.

182
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,120
You were just gone.

183
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,250
I was scared. I thought
something had happened.

184
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,010
- I don't remember this.
- I know.

185
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,790
What then?

186
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,530
I looked everywhere for you.

187
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,980
When I finally found you,
you were asleep,out cold.

188
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,850
Where?

189
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,310
A ways away from the school.

190
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,480
I wandered off and passed out?

191
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,080
When I found you, you were fine.

192
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,330
So,we never actually
went to the after party?

193
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,690
I took you home and you
didn't remember anything.

194
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,900
You didn't say anything?

195
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,640
- Your mother was there.
- You let me believe that I just...

196
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,330
- Amanda,I'm sorry.
- You lied to me!

197
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,210
I didn't want to ruin
your perfect night.

198
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,550
You just did.

199
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,830
Your turn.

200
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,480
- OK,so...
- We should go.

201
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,550
No.

202
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,090
- Amanda...
- I don't feel like going anywhere with you right now!

203
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,080
maybe you guys should
check out the psychic.

204
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,390
Yeah. Yeah,she's really great.

205
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,920
You guys should totally check her out.

206
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,380
You should, because I'm going home now.

207
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,090
Put your money on the table.

208
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,330
You don't want to be here.

209
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,910
No.

210
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,410
So,you don't believe?

211
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:20,420
It's scientifi to predict a future action without
having complete knowledge of all the variables.

212
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,090
Perhaps,if you're only
looking at it scientifically.

213
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,500
How else can I look at it?

214
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,240
Faith. Fate. Intuition.

215
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,050
Haven't you ever felt certain you
knew something was going to happen?

216
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,320
I've sensed things.

217
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,170
There's always been an explanation.

218
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,500
A change in the weather, pattern of
behaviors with a predictable outcome.

219
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,190
What about a gut feeling?

220
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,060
Perhaps a dream? A nightmare?

221
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,280
You're afraid.

222
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,260
But it's not for yourself.

223
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,940
You know there's no
one who can hurt you.

224
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,140
The only way to get to you
is through those you love.

225
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,400
There is a girl.

226
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,900
Your soul mate.

227
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,080
But you've missed the signs.

228
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,370
What signs?

229
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:49,680
I see something white
and water. It's swimming.

230
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,810
Rabbit.

231
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,050
Rabbits don't swim.

232
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,520
The white rabbit will swim.

233
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,790
I don't understand.

234
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,840
How? When?

235
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,550
Tonight.

236
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,100
Be ready. Your soul mate is in danger.

237
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,560
Could you tell if she was lying?

238
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,290
I don't know.

239
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,430
Her heart rate was all over the place, but
that could have just been from the trance.

240
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,170
Well,you have to understand,
empaths,the best ones,

241
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,780
are usually just picking up on
the cues from their subjects.

242
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Your anxiety must have
been pouring out of you.

243
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,290
And she exploited it. She's
a two-bit carnival hack.

244
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,110
But she knew about Amanda.

245
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,320
It's a con. She was deliberately vague.

246
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,750
Why would someone do that?

247
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,990
It's an unfortunate reality.

248
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,630
People prey on the innocent.

249
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,710
If you ask me, they're all a bunch
of crazies looking to make a buck.

250
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,270
Again with the eavesdropping.

251
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,160
The sound carries.

252
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,180
What did she say to you?

253
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,530
She said I have a secret.
Windfall. A secret windfall coming.

254
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,200
Speaking of windfalls,you owe
me 20 bucks for your fuel pump.

255
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,780
You're robbing me of my last bill,sir.

256
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,090
Somehow I think you'll survive.

257
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,890
Sweet. Another 20.

258
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,830
Must have missed it
when I counted my tips.

259
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,700
A windfall.

260
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,460
Dude,20 dollars is hardly the lottery.

261
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,690
I gotta go.

262
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,780
Hey,it...

263
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,380
Make mine a double.

264
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,890
What's the matter with you?

265
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,910
Unresolved friend drama.

266
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,300
You?

267
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,470
Boyfriend problems.

268
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,000
Do you think I'm too innocent?

269
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,160
Is this a trick question?

270
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,920
Kyle treats me like I'm a child.

271
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,050
I'm this fragile thing
that needs protecting.

272
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,410
Number 27.

273
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,260
Number 27?

274
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,440
I can break down relationship
troubles into 42 parts.

275
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,890
The higher the number,
the worse the problem.

276
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,210
What's number 42?

277
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,180
Devastating breakup.

278
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,420
And number 27 is
overprotective boyfriend?

279
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,050
Followed shortly after by
woman exerting independence.

280
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,920
What's wrong with that?

281
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,980
Absolutely nothing. If you're the woman.

282
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,100
- Hey,man.
- Is Amanda here?

283
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,320
Out back,talking to Hilary, the
source of many of my current problems.

284
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,830
Great.

285
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,440
Would you like me to play
wingwoman or should I skedaddle?

286
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,280
Do you want to do something tonight?

287
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,600
You mean like a girl date?

288
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,070
I just... I need a break
from Kyle for the night.

289
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,170
Number 28, woman exerting independence.

290
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,360
Absolutely.

291
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,190
I have these tickets to this great
band playing at the street fair.

292
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,220
I was gonna ask Lori and Declan,but...

293
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,510
Actually,I was thinking,stay in,eat some
chocolate,wallow our way throughThe Notebook.

294
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,570
That could be fun,too.

295
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,910
Lori still not talking to you?

296
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,250
Neither is Hilary.

297
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:01,020
Apparently,kissing your ex's friend is a major
violation of something called "the girl code."

298
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,380
There's a girl code?

299
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,060
It was news to me,too.

300
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,540
I need to talk to Amanda.

301
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,490
May you have better luck
with the female persuasion.

302
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,390
Just give me a minute.

303
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,760
Stay strong.

304
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,600
Hey,Hils.

305
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,110
You need to keep your
distance. I can't be seen

306
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,650
This is ridiculous. I was drunk.

307
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,500
Why can't we all
pretend it didn't happen?

308
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,500
Because it did happen!

309
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,920
And now my best friend
isn't speaking to me.

310
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,050
I'm sorry. I'm sorry it's some
weird violation of the girl rule.

311
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,210
Code.

312
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,310
Whatever. But you and I are friends.

313
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,550
You helped me through
everything with Lori.

314
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,130
Don't bail on me now.

315
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,220
You have got to be kidding me.

316
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,030
Trager,come on.

317
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,140
Come on,what? Choose
a guy over your friend?

318
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,600
That's not what happened.

319
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,930
Lori,it wasn't her fault.

320
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,450
Are you sure,because she
has a history with the boys.

321
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,320
I can't believe you just went there.

322
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,060
Well,that makes two of us.

323
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,370
I want to talk to you.

324
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,630
I'm not in the mood to talk right now.

325
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,650
Amanda,I understand that
you're upset and I'm sorry.

326
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,360
Look,I just need some time to think.

327
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,490
A night off.

328
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,130
Kyle,I'm not asking for your permission.

329
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,050
I think I really blew it.

330
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,780
Amanda's mad at me.

331
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,990
Well,that's a first.

332
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,540
She doesn't want me, I don't
want to let her out of my sight.

333
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,960
Do I need to give you a lecture
on the perils of stalking?

334
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,000
I have a terrible feeling something
bad is going to happen to her.

335
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,260
Earlier I think I saw that guy from
Latnok, the one that kidnapped Amanda.

336
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,690
And then a psychic told me
my soul mate was in danger.

337
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,990
The one from the street fair?

338
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,770
I saw her yesterday as a joke.

339
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,020
She didn't make She just
kept babbling about...

340
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,890
- What?
- Nothing.

341
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,470
Declan,what?

342
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,890
She told me I'd be caught
between enemy lines.

343
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,610
Which didn't make any
sense until just now.

344
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,360
Hello?

345
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,550
Sarah?

346
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,750
You're back.

347
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,460
I told the landlord I'd
locked my keys inside.

348
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,860
Thankfully,he'd never met Sarah
and he just assumed I was her.

349
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,380
What are you doing?

350
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,280
I want you to come home with me.

351
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,170
- I already said...
- I know.

352
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,360
And I'm not gonna force you.

353
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,010
But Jessi,I've counseled a lot
of teenagers over the years.

354
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,500
And I've seen them through
some terrible situations.

355
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,140
Some of them I've been able to help.

356
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,810
Some of them I haven't.

357
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,920
I have never given up on any of them.

358
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,240
And I'm not giving up on you.

359
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,450
- Everybody else did.
- No.

360
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,410
Sarah did. Just Sarah.

361
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,510
And the first thing that you and I are gonna work on
is a way for you to understand that's not your fault.

362
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,500
But in order for that to happen,
you're gonna have to come with me.

363
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,610
You're gonna have to trust me.

364
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,250
Does Kyle know about Sarah?

365
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,220
Not yet,but he should.

366
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,770
OK. I just need some time to pack.

367
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,840
OK.

368
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,720
Amanda!

369
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,150
What are you doing here?

370
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,830
I've been acting strange
and keeping things from you.

371
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,210
But I'm truly sorry.

372
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,630
I'm not in the mood to discuss it.

373
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,040
So,let's talk about it tonight.

374
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,950
Cancel your plans and stay in with me.

375
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,490
I can't just cancel my plans.

376
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,650
Please,Amanda,just spend
tonight with me instead.

377
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,790
Why? Why is tonight so important?

378
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,910
I'm worried that something
might happen to you.

379
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,820
One visit to the psychic and
now you can predict the future?

380
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,620
She said that...

381
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,670
Wait a minute. Is this
actually about the psychic?

382
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,720
She said that tonight, when the white
rabbit swims, my soul mate will be in danger.

383
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,680
Kyle,come on. Really.

384
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,680
You're so trusting of everyone.

385
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,820
You can't let that
scam artist get to you.

386
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,380
You don't need to
protect me. I'll be fine.

387
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,020
The psychic had warned
me of bad things to come.

388
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,350
Was it possible for
someone to see danger?

389
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,350
Had my nightmare been a way of
predicting trouble for Amanda?

390
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,670
I needed to understand the
message,decipher its meaning.

391
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,300
And more than anything,
to keep Amanda safe.

392
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,040
Even if I needed some help to do it.

393
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,940
The Little Mermaid,Cinderella,
The Princess Diaries.

394
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,720
I'm sensing a theme here.

395
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,370
What do you mean?

396
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,860
Never mind.

397
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,410
Let girls' night commence.

398
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,630
What the hell is she doing here?

399
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,010
Tuesday's pasta, Thursday's pot roast.

400
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,980
Where's Monday's chicken?

401
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,700
I think it's sprouted
wings and flown the coop.

402
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,040
All right. I'll cook.

403
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,190
You'll what?

404
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,060
Don't sound so surprised.
Any moron can boil a noodle.

405
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,450
Well,it's just so grown
up of you to offer.

406
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,320
Face the facts,Stephen, I'm growing up.

407
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,510
OK. First of all,Stephen is my name only
to people your mother did not give birth to.

408
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,540
- Secondly,what the hell's going on with you?
- Nothing.

409
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,320
Nothing?

410
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,040
You're acting like
you've been body swapped.

411
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,700
So,you're either up to something or...

412
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,010
My god. You're having sex.

413
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,850
What?

414
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,500
You're having sex. I can't believe I
didn't see the signs. I'm such an idiot.

415
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,420
- Dad,I was...
- You said it didn't happen.

416
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,140
- Well,actually...
- ********

417
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,140
I didn't think you could keep
something like that from me.

418
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,710
Andi didn't want anybody to...

419
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,020
I trusted you,Josh. Damnit!

420
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,440
Hey,Mr. Trager.

421
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,420
Mark,did we have a meeting?

422
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,750
No,actually. I came
by... I wanted to,uh...

423
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,440
I wanted to talk to
you about your daughter.

424
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,430
Oh,I feel for you,Mark, because if you're
standing on my doorstep at this moment,

425
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,100
about to ask permission
to date my daughter,

426
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,960
then you possibly have the worst
timing in the history of the universe,

427
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,500
so I'm gonna say no, one hundred percent,
absolutely not, over my dead body,no. Got it?

428
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,740
- I just wanted...
- Good.

429
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:50,030
- Oh,good. I'm al I just need...
- Jessi. I need your help.

430
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,830
My help?

431
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,350
Amanda's at her house with the girls.

432
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,060
I need you to go over
there and watch out for her.

433
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,550
You want me to help you with Amanda?

434
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,620
I know it's a lot to ask, but I have a feeling
something bad is going to happen tonight

435
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,870
and you're the only one that
can protect her like I can.

436
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,610
Please,Jessi. I need you.

437
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,060
Yeah,sure.

438
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,190
Great. I'll text Lori and
have her tell Amanda sh

439
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,650
You OK? You seem like something's wrong.

440
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,300
No,no,I'll take care of it.

441
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,940
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you guys were in a fight.

442
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,790
I swear I didn't plan this.

443
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,880
I think I'm gonna go.

444
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,860
So soon?

445
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,240
- Great.
- What?

446
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,250
I forgot to tell you Jessi was coming.

447
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,730
- Nicole,thank God you're home.
- What's the matter?

448
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,970
While you were out saving a
teenager I've lost control of ours.

449
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,400
Hey,how did everything go with Jessi?

450
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,440
Great. I asked her to watch
over Amanda for me tonight.

451
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,730
She needed to talk to you about
something. She didn't mention it?

452
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,930
I guess I didn't give her the chance.

453
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,470
*****

454
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,000
Is she your new best friend now?

455
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,160
Because if memory serves, she made out
with Declan too, and then bitch slapped you.

456
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,210
For some reason th sting
as bad as what you did.

457
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,490
I didn't do anything.

458
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,760
What?

459
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,530
Jessi,I'm so sorry.

460
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,100
For what?

461
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,340
You got what you wanted.
Isn't that all that matters?

462
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,250
You know that's not true.

463
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,170
I should have noticed
that you needed me.

464
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,920
Look,I'm do I'm watching
over your precious girlfriend.

465
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,380
I promise I'll make this right.

466
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,810
Don't bother.

467
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,400
Hilary,do you still have
tickets for that band?

468
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,160
- Why?
- Because we're going.

469
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,830
- Hallelujah.
- What's going on?

470
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,200
I'm not gonna stay in my
own house and get spied on.

471
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,270
I wasn't spying,I was watching.

472
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,810
There's a difference.

473
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,430
Not to me,there isn't. Let's go.

474
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,820
Is she going?

475
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,290
Not if you are.

476
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,950
You know what? I needed night. I needed
a night off from Kyle with you two.

477
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,050
I'm gonna go alone if I have to.

478
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,100
You're not coming.

479
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,130
You can tell Kyle I'm off
putting myself in danger.

480
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,810
I have to go,don't I? For Kyle.

481
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,230
Lovely.

482
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,140
You've got a problem.

483
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,920
- I'm in trouble.
- That bad?

484
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,810
I really messed things up
with Amanda, and now Jessi.

485
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,470
Do I want to know what you did?

486
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,710
Everything wrong.

487
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,030
That makes two of us.

488
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,140
They're going to see a band
play but I don't know where.

489
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,910
You call Lori?

490
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,900
Tried but her phone went to voicemail.

491
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,860
Try again.

492
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,020
Let me guess. Kyle?

493
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,390
No,it's Mark,actually. I'm just gonna...

494
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,690
Hi,Mark.

495
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,580
Just tell me where you're
going. That's all I need to know.

496
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:43,280
I'm just on my way to see
Faber Drive play. Where are you?

497
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,800
Thanks.

498
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,740
OK,grea talking to you,too. Bye.

499
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,440
Lori?

500
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,710
Mark.

501
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,120
I'm really sorry.

502
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,550
Uh,I was gonna call you tonight.

503
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,800
Sort of wishing you just had.

504
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,710
I talked to your dad.

505
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,440
To say that it went horribly
would be a massive understatement.

506
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,020
Talked to her dad about what?

507
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,550
None of your business.

508
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,530
Unbelievable.

509
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:21,100
You're giving me all this crap about Declan
and you're busy lining up the DJ on the side?

510
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,000
The best friend,I presume.

511
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,410
You know what,Lori? You're a hypocrite.

512
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,480
- I'm having a bad night.
- We can talk later. Where you guys headed?

513
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,250
To see Faber Drive play.
I'm sorry,I have to go.

514
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,610
Yeah,yeah. Don't worry about it.

515
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,250
Where are they all running off to?

516
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,670
Faber Drive's playing.

517
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,540
Sounds like fun. Maybe
I'll go check it out.

518
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,780
Look,I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

519
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,320
If she catches you following
her,she'll hate you.

520
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,270
What if something
happens and I'm not there?

521
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,220
Ask yourself how much you really believe
in the prediction of a street fair psychic.

522
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,880
What if I told you I
could predict the future?

523
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,230
I've learned from experience never to
doubt when you say you can do something.

524
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,400
So,what if,no matter how crazy
it seems,the psychic is right?

525
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,190
What if Amanda really is in danger and
I don't do everything I can to stop it?

526
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,930
What do you want to do?

527
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,800
I want to go to the Faber Drive show
and watch over her. Just in case.

528
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,070
Wait. They're going to Faber Drive?

529
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,580
- Yes.
- Man,we gotta go.

530
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,410
What's the matter?

531
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,210
- The psychic,she saw water in her prediction?
- Yes.

532
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,250
Well,that band, they're
playing on a boat.

533
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,780
Here you are. Kyle?
Put it out of your head.

534
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,280
We're gonna have fun,right?

535
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,270
How could it be anything but?

536
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,330
Great. My headache's back.

537
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,720
It's not too late to go home.

538
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,260
No,I'm gonna do this.

539
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,900
So,the psychic was right.
My secret wasn't safe.

540
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,670
I knew it. You couldn't help yourself.

541
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,380
You had to blab to the
heavens you got laid.

542
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,610
I didn't blab to anyone.
My dad figured it out.

543
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,360
Your dad? Your parents know?

544
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,400
Well,usually where one
knows, the other follows.

545
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,670
Josh,this is a disaster.

546
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,420
For me,yes. Why are you so pissed?

547
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:28,680
Every time your parents look at me they'll
see the girl who's having sex with their son.

548
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,430
What if they tell my
moms? They'll freak!

549
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,040
This d the end of the world.

550
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,180
No,but it's the end of our sex life.

551
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,880
What? Why?

552
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,910
It's just... I'm not ready for
people to look at me like that.

553
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,730
Like what?

554
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,570
Like a walking statistic.

555
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,220
Like a possible Juno in the making.

556
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,230
Like every other idiot girl who gives it
up too early and has to suffer consequences.

557
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,470
That's not gonna be me. I'm sorry.

558
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,620
I really am,but it,the sex, is done.

559
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,120
There you guys are. I'm
glad I caught up with you.

560
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,410
Good. You made it. Need a ticket?

561
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,900
I can't believe you just did that.

562
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,780
And I can't believe you refuse to speak to
me over something that doesn't matter to you.

563
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,890
What doesn't matter? That Declan
kissed you or that you let him?

564
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,910
I didn't let him.

565
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,060
I know what I saw. You liked it.

566
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,200
All right,fine. I liked it. Happy?

567
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,520
You dumped him. You decided he wasn't
good enough for all your "woe is me,

568
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,550
I need to find myself without you" crap.

569
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,320
- That's not crap.
- Face it,Lori.

570
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,290
You had a good guy and you blew it.

571
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,450
This whole thing's your fault.

572
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,020
- It's not my fault.
- Get off of me!

573
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,670
Serves you right.

574
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,090
Oh,I hope that doesn't stain.

575
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,140
You so did not just do that.

576
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,240
Oh,I think I just did.

577
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,520
Lori,where is she? Where's Amanda?

578
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,250
She's in line for the... boat.

579
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,350
White rabbit swims...

580
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,260
Are you two 12?

581
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,520
You followed me here?

582
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,520
Don't flatter yourself.

583
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,700
You just happened to be
at a party by yourself?

584
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,070
Aren't you?

585
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,970
Amanda!

586
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,490
Jessi!

587
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,920
You feeling OK?

588
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,330
I should have seen that beam coming.

589
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,910
Guess I was distracted.

590
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,490
With good reason.

591
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,180
I'm sorry,Jessi. I've
been a terrible friend.

592
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,460
You didn't know.

593
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,340
But I should have.

594
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,670
You're always saying
that we're the same.

595
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,030
I should have picked up on the
fact that you were having problems.

596
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,290
You're right. You should have.

597
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,160
But I shouldn't have
kept them from you,either.

598
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,800
- Sarah just left?
- Yep.

599
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,850
I would never do that to you.

600
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,520
You know that,right?

601
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,430
I know that.

602
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,090
Why did you go after Amanda tonight?

603
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:45,340
You asked me to look after her for
you, and I didn't want to let you down.

604
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,750
Does it hurt?

605
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,690
A little.

606
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:25,020
- Is that better?
- Yeah.

607
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,670
Your girlfriend's waiting
for you. You should go.

608
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,900
She's mad at me.

609
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,510
She'll get over it.

610
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,220
No one can stay mad at you.

611
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,160
I'll be right there.

612
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,610
I have to pick up Kyle and Jessi.

613
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,300
I'll stay here with Josh.

614
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,150
Great,so you can yell at me some more?

615
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,810
I love you. We'll talk later.

616
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,080
Sit.

617
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:16,580
OK,before you say anything, I
have to tell you that I'm sorry.

618
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,740
- You are?
- Yeah.

619
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:24,270
When I gave you the condom I knew I
was putting the choice in your hands.

620
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,200
I'm not upset that you had sex.

621
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,150
I mean,I'm a little upset.

622
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,370
But I'm mostly disappointed that you didn't
feel like you could talk to me about it.

623
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,520
Dad,come on, it's embarrassing.

624
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,650
It shouldn't be. It can be a
great thing when it's right.

625
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,250
But I don't want you to feel like
you have to handle this alone.

626
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,780
Apparently,Andi was the
one who couldn't handle it.

627
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,940
She's cut me off.

628
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:54,760
She has? I mean,she has?

629
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,330
Girls are confusing.

630
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,320
Oh,this is only the beginning.

631
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,950
So,do you feel like you want
to tell me more about it?

632
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,620
Yeah. Sure.

633
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,340
What's next,mud wrestling?

634
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,750
You can't stay mad at her forever.

635
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,130
What,are you choosing sides?

636
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:35,790
Honestly,Trager,if I'd have known about
this girl code, I never would have done it.

637
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,020
I was just drunk and
feeling sorry for myself.

638
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,350
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

639
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,880
But I did and I'm sorry.

640
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,110
- Are you into her?
- No!

641
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,020
I... I don't know. Maybe.

642
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,900
But it shouldn't matter.

643
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,300
You made the choice to move on.

644
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,390
It's not fair for you to hold me back.

645
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,280
I owe you an apology.

646
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,270
Do you?

647
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,770
The psychic was right.

648
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,590
You were there to save the day.

649
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,520
In spite of everything I
did to make sure you weren't.

650
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,580
But I don't think the
psychic predicted the future.

651
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,400
- I think I created it.
- How?

652
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,280
Everything I did put you on that boat.

653
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,460
If I hadn't made you angry or
had been a better friend to Jessi,

654
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,830
neither of you would have been there.

655
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,680
But we were.

656
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,730
And it's funny.

657
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,820
What is?

658
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,770
The psychic said your soul
mate would be in danger.

659
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:03,950
And after all was said and done,
it wasn't me who needed saving.

660
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,250
It was Jessi.

661
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:20,070
My mom's here. Good night.

662
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,540
Let's go home.

663
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,850
- Settling your tab?
- Yes. Thanks for all your help.

664
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,170
It was a terrible joke
to play on your friend.

665
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,990
Well,that's why I paid
you a little extra.

666
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,840
I felt him,you know.

667
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,310
That boy,he's special.

668
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,740
Yes,he is.

669
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,280
I see great things in his future.
