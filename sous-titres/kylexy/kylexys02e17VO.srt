1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,100
Previously on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,390
I got accepted to a music
program in New York.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,660
I leave in two days.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,090
I'll call...and text,
and I'll come back to you.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,370
The two of you used to play
that song all the time.

6
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,910
She could be you.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,560
- Third row, fourth one down.
- It's not there.

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,560
The song on the jukebox?

9
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,570
D4.

10
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:20,920
You didn't tell me you were coming.

11
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:23,158
No one knows. I'm surprising
my mom for her birthday.

12
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:25,092
You will not see or speak to Amanda

13
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:27,771
until she's back where
she belongs at that school.

14
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:30,223
Please. You'll have 20 bubbleheads
lined up by tomorrow.

15
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,172
They all have the same thing
working against them.

16
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:33,782
What's that?

17
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:35,560
None of them are you.

18
00:00:35,838 --> 00:00:38,090
- Start teaching me.
- I can't.

19
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:39,782
I have plans tonight with Amanda.

20
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:41,180
Oh, Amanda. She's home?

21
00:00:41,197 --> 00:00:44,423
You have no idea
how disappointed I am right now.

22
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,030
Your flight leaves
in less than two hours.

23
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,502
Thank you for letting me
know Amanda was here.

24
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:50,623
Glad I could help.

25
00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:52,983
We made it very clear
you're not to see Amanda.

26
00:00:52,997 --> 00:00:54,902
- You're still grounded.
- Two weeks.

27
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:02,660
Latnok?

28
00:01:07,476 --> 00:01:08,442
Amanda?

29
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,202
I didn't get on the plane.

30
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:19,313
Tell me what happened?

31
00:01:20,298 --> 00:01:22,382
I was waiting at the gate,
it was time to board the plane,

32
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:23,722
and I literally could not move.

33
00:01:23,738 --> 00:01:26,000
It was like my whole body was saying,

34
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:27,870
"You can't do this.
This is wrong."

35
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:29,892
The next thing I knew,
I was running through the terminal,

36
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:31,613
jumping in a cab and
knocking on your window.

37
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:33,340
A total loss of sanity.

38
00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:37,832
My mom's gonna kill me.

39
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:41,392
Maybe your mom will understand
when you explain it to her.

40
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:44,490
Key word "understand".
She's not capable of.

41
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:46,152
What am I gonna do?

42
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,403
I'll go get Stephen and Nicole.

43
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:49,540
No. You can't involve them.

44
00:01:49,936 --> 00:01:51,972
I'm sorry I've already involved you.

45
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:56,470
Amanda, everything's gonna be okay.

46
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:07,710
Can I stay here?

47
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:09,890
- Amanda...
- Just until the morning...

48
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:11,130
Then I'll go straight home.

49
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:12,173
I'm already grounded.

50
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:13,903
No one will even know I was here.

51
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:16,740
I just need some time
to get my head together.

52
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:18,413
And somehow,

53
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:20,600
my mom won't be as scary
to deal with in the daylight.

54
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:27,433
All yours.

55
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:31,303
Thank you so much.

56
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:33,222
My luggage is probably being searched

57
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:35,073
by the terrorist watch squad
as we speak.

58
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:37,221
Can I borrow something to sleep in?

59
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,490
Sure.

60
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:42,410
You're being really
amazing about all of this.

61
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,020
I mean, I knew you were the kind of guy

62
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:45,522
who'd give the shirt off
their back to help somebody,

63
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:47,393
but this is really above and beyond.

64
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:51,582
I didn't...

65
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:54,670
I'm...

66
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:58,013
I didn't... I just... I meant...

67
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,602
Thank you.

68
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:13,353
What's the matter?

69
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,563
What do you mean?

70
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:17,583
Your cheeks are getting pinker.

71
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:19,981
Are they?

72
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:22,350
Your body temperature is climbing.

73
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:30,852
I'll get you a thinner blanket.

Let me sleep on the floor.

78
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:09,211
You don't like the tub?

79
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:12,601
No. I'm sorry,
I'm just trying to be polite.

80
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,023
How is sleeping on the floor polite?

81
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:16,861
I don't wanna take your tub from you.

82
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:19,213
I want you to have it.
Unless you don't like it.

83
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,430
Why wouldn't I like it?

84
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:23,591
- It's a tub.
- It's your tub, all of it.

85
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:45,643
Can you lock the door?

86
00:04:45,657 --> 00:04:47,821
I don't want anyone
to catch me in here.

87
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,602
Asleep yet?

88
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:19,272
No.

89
00:05:19,715 --> 00:05:21,633
How's the tub?
Are you comfortable?

90
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,183
Strangely, I am.

91
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:25,923
How's the floor?

92
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:29,770
It's too open.
No sides.

93
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:39,072
You could, if you wanted to...

94
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:42,290
I mean, there's plenty of room.

95
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,350
With you?

96
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,363
With me.

97
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:17,983
That better?

98
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:19,550
Much.

99
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,073
Thank you for this.

100
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:26,773
You're welcome.

to spend the night

102
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:36,262

Everything's fine.

109
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:01,690
What happened?

110
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:03,810
Nothing. I, uh...

111
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:06,121
I just... I just woke up.

112
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:11,423
- Hi.
- Hi.

113
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:16,340
- Come grab some breakfast.
- Okay.

That was with my personal things.

119
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:43,971
No, I found it on my bed.

120
00:07:44,145 --> 00:07:45,680
You know, Jessi,

121
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:47,530
all you had to do
was ask for the record,

122
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:49,151
and I would have given it to you.

123
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:51,733
Why would you break into my cabinet?

124
00:07:51,748 --> 00:07:53,263
What cabinet?

125
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:55,271
Come on now.
Don't lie to me, all right?

126
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:56,600
There's gonna have to be
a certain level of trust

127
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:57,600
if this thing's gonna work,

128
00:07:57,656 --> 00:07:59,530
and you snooping around in my stuff

129
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,301
is just not gonna cut it.

130
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:03,571
I'm telling you the truth.
I found the record right here.

131
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:08,102
That song meant something to my mother.

132
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:12,890
I was hoping you'd tell me
more about her.

133
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,933
Now is not the time.

134
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:17,033
No, don't take that from me.

135
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:20,872

just be careful with it.

There's a difference?

140
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,592
He locked his door this morning.

141
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,070
I wouldn't worry about it.

142
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:09,701
He's never locked it before.

143
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:12,260
Maybe he just wants some privacy.

144
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,588
Privacy?

145
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:16,592
I don't get it.

146
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,291
- Oh, I get it.
- People, it's breakfast.

147
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:23,301
Good morning.

148
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:25,160
Kyle. Just in time to have
a little breakfast.

149
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:26,492
Maybe you can beat the batter.

150
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,713
Are we having pancakes?

151
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:30,433
Or perhaps you'd like
to grill your sausage.

152
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,170
- Okay, Josh...
- I might vomit.

153
00:09:32,186 --> 00:09:34,930
- Kyle, ignore him.
- Why?

154
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:36,531
Not even worth explaining.

155
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:39,111
Now that we're all together
enjoying our quality time...

156
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:40,413

157
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:41,990
Whatever. You're gonna
make good use of it.

158
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:44,240
- Meaning?
- Gutters. Clean 'em out.

159
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:46,362
You and I are gonna wash
all the windows outside.

160
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,890
That's cruel and unusual punishment.

161
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:51,701
We cooked up a little
to-do list for you guys, too.

162
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:53,232
Bring it on.

163
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:55,331
I'll to-do the hell out of it

164
00:09:55,347 --> 00:09:59,041
in exchange for the briefest
of parole periods later this evening.

165
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,550
Your sentence does not
include a parole option.

166
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,812
I'm trying to be
a responsible young adult.

167
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:05,522
I'm the sober cab to Preston's party.

168
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:06,872
Sober cab?

169
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:08,312
Designated non-drinking driver,

170
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:10,900
and if I bail, I'll ruin it
for everyone else.

171
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:13,083
Everyone else should not
be drinking at all.

172
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:15,142
Absurd request denied.

173
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,332
As long as the parole
board's in session,

174
00:10:17,346 --> 00:10:19,403
I really need to see Andy today.

175
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,541
Emotional support.

176
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,751
She's got chemo.

177
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:25,532
Andy has chemo on tuesdays,

178
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:29,000
and I can't believe you just falsely
played the cancer card.

179
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:31,203
It was her idea.

180
00:10:31,617 --> 00:10:33,491
You wanna make a plea, too?

181
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:36,212
No. I'll do my time.

182
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:37,850
Man of honor.

183
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:39,691
Or a giant suck-up.

184
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,770
You can start by cleaning your room.

185
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:45,843
I'll get started.

186
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:49,893
Think he's gonna go peel his banana?

187
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:06,302
This is so sweet,
but I'm too nervous to eat.

188
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:07,870
Maybe you're underestimating
your mother.

189
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:09,483
She might surprise you.

190
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:10,461
I appreciate the optimism,

191
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:14,640
but I expect bloodcurdling screams
followed by frothing at the mouth.

192
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:16,743
Well, I'm here if you need me.

193
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,562
I'm counting on it.

194
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,720
Here goes.

195
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:29,673
- Hi.
- Hi.

196
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,300
You should, uh,
keep your window closed,

197
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:33,273
unless you want Josh
to spray your whole room.

198
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:38,251
How long do you think that'll take?

199
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:40,223
In Josh time, all day.

200
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:41,610
Thanks.

201
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:46,591
Amanda, we have a problem.

202
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:48,731
No.

203
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:50,840
None of the other window's open.

204
00:11:50,937 --> 00:11:52,201
Great.

205
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:54,223
So what do we do?

206
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:16,231
- Amanda?
- What about her?

207
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:19,702
I was just wondering
how she's doing in New York.

208
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:22,632
My guess is she'll be thrilled
to get a break from her mother.

209
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,760
No. The front door.

210
00:12:33,196 --> 00:12:36,911
Amanda Bloom,
you little stowaway.

211
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:38,861
Lori?

212
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:44,620
Here you go. I left the pieces out
in the dining room.

213
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:48,572
- Armed and ready to polish.
- Make me proud.

214
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,203
Kyle, I need you at the computer.

215
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:51,610
Okay.

216
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,611
Whenever I save something,

217
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:03,632
the hard dive makes
this grinding sound,

218
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:05,953
like "wooosshh."

219
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:08,120
I'll take a look at it.

220
00:13:16,537 --> 00:13:18,303
- Mrs. Trager.
- Yes.

221
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:19,662
<i>I'm Constance Berlinger.

222
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:21,671
I'm with the department
of children services.

223
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:23,340
How can I help you?

224
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:25,700
We've received a complaint
about your ward.

225
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:27,950
Kyle? Who filed a complaint?

226
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:29,873
You know I can't tell you that.

227
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,621
Never mind. I can guess.

228
00:13:37,736 --> 00:13:39,352
Carol Bloom?

229
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:40,802
<i>Unbelievable.

230
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:43,773
<i>She's angry because she thinks
Kyle interfered with Amanda.

231
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:45,513
<i>She must have called social services.

232
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:46,722
He's no longer in the system.

233
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:48,480
Well, he was, and
if someone files a complaint

234
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,911
about a former ward of the state,

235
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:51,581
they're legally bound to check it out.

236
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,122
What was her complaint?

237
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:55,191
That Kyle's living here
without proper supervision

238
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,730
and being disruptive to the community.

239
00:13:57,747 --> 00:13:59,930
- That's not true.
- Well, of course it isn't.

240
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:01,152
But now we need to prove it.

241
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:02,302
To that woman?

242
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:03,720
<i>She doesn't even know us.

243
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:05,401
<i>This is how the system works.

244
00:14:05,415 --> 00:14:07,043
<i>We just have to get through this.

245
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:08,870
<i>Let her go through her checklist.

246
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:10,441
What kind of checklist?

247
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:12,191
Questions to make sure we're providing

248
00:14:12,206 --> 00:14:14,282
a safe and healthy environment for you.

249
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:18,133
The first question,
Does the child have his own proper bed?

250
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:18,910
Great.

251
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:20,142
Well, the bigger problem is

252
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:21,930
keeping the truth about you a secret.

253
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:22,921
I'll be careful.

254
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:24,340
None of us can slip.

255
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:26,163
I know her type, very thorough.

256
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:28,781
We just have to keep
our stories straight and...

257
00:14:28,797 --> 00:14:30,731
stay on our toes.

258
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:33,943
Be careful.

259
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,981
<i>This woman can't find out
who you really are.

260
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:43,930
Just so I'm up to speed.

261
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:45,542
You were first called in
to treat Noah...

262
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:47,412
Kyle.

263
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:49,333
I'm a little confused.

264
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:50,992
We changed his name.

265
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:53,822
Legally, at his request.

266
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:55,551
I'd like to see those papers.

267
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:57,443
Oh, no problem. Stephen,

268
00:14:57,456 --> 00:14:58,993
they're in the family file
in my office.

269
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:00,053
Could you go grab them?

270
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,430
Absolutely. Could I get you
something to drink?

271
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:03,910
Ice water, please.

272
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,441
So, you first met Kyle
at the detention center,

273
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:14,062
diagnosed him with amnesia,

274
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:16,763
and the very next day,
moved him, your new patient,

275
00:15:16,778 --> 00:15:18,622
in here with your family.

276
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:21,890
There were special circumstances.

277
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:24,230
Of course there were.

278
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,821
I hate that some stranger
can just come in here

279
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,162
and decide things about us.

280
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:38,730
I know. As if we're the kinda kids

281
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:42,382
who'd smuggle in one of their
runaway girlfriends or something.

282
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,303
Amanda needed help.

283
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:49,863
Oh, no. You're not getting away
with the nutshell version.

284
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:51,932
What happened with you two last night?

285
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:53,311
I heard a knock on my window,

286
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:54,910
and I went over and
Amanda was out there,

287
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:56,421
- and she really needed...
- No, no, no.

288
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:58,152
Never mind, I know nothing happened.

289
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,780
It's you and Amanda, for god sakes.

290
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:02,642
Still, where'd she sleep?

291
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:03,963
My tub.

292
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:05,441
Where did you sleep?

293
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:08,152
My tub.

294
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:10,812
You dog! And?

295
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:16,651
Okay, the real scandal is did she just
bail on her flight and come here?

296
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,880
Yes.

297
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,951
And her mother, the crypt keeper,
doesn't know.

298
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:22,983
Well, she must know by now,

299
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:24,462
assuming Amanda left and went home.

300
00:16:24,478 --> 00:16:25,942
<i>She better have.

301
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,651
You don't wanna get busted
harboring a fugitive

302
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,561
with that social worker here.

303
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:36,210
Shaken, not stirred.

304
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:39,001
Thank you.

305
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:47,472
Following the death of his parents,

306
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:49,232
you've become his permanent guardians.

307
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:51,383
Yes. We love Kyle.

308
00:16:51,397 --> 00:16:52,132
Honestly,

309
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:56,033
the idea of him being disruptive
in any way is ludicrous.

310
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:57,993
Our son Josh on the other hand...

311
00:16:58,006 --> 00:16:59,662
Is there a problem with
Josh's behavior?

312
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:02,322
Is there a problem with
Josh's behavior?

313
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:06,212
There's no problem.

314
00:17:06,228 --> 00:17:07,690
I have to hide all my porn.

315
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,992
She's gonna search the house?

316
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:09,932
<i>Oh, yeah.

317
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,893
Social worker is basically
a fancy title for "snoop."

318
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,001
What's she looking for?

319
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:15,832
Weapons of mass destruction.

320
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:19,831
Guns, sex toys, drugs, booze.

321
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:20,941
Oh, no!

322
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,250
Relax. Dad flushed
his pot stash, remember?

323
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:24,500
I'm not worried about dad.

324
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:26,081
You have a pot stash now?

325
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,223
No.

326
00:17:27,238 --> 00:17:29,152
I have this.

327
00:17:32,498 --> 00:17:33,860
Oh! beer?

328
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:37,191
I was holding it for Preston
until his parents left town.

329
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,171
I'm the only one
he could trust with it.

330
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,292
Because I'm the most responsible.

331
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:46,091
I hate myself!

332
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,510
Well, we have to get rid of it.

333
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:48,952
First, you. Out.

334
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,933
Smuggling beer
is not gonna score you any points.

335
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:52,260
But I'm the one that
got you into this mess

336
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:53,532
in the first place.

337
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:55,132
Two little words called "peer pressure"

338
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,451
got me into this mess.

339
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,091
Go figure out a story to explain

340
00:17:58,106 --> 00:18:00,312
why you have a bathtub
in your room instead of a bed.

341
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:03,283
And you...

342
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:05,373
Tap into that cunning
little brain of yours

343
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,312
and come up with something quick.

344
00:18:14,797 --> 00:18:17,400
<i>Tell me about his relationships
outside the family.

345
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:19,682
I assume you're referring to Amanda.

346
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:22,370
It's a very caring,
supportive relationship.

347
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:24,101
There's nothing objectionable
or inappropriate.

348
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:26,232
Amanda's mother is overreacting.

349
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,743
She's a little... high-strung.

350
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:35,031
Amanda, I thought you made it home.

351
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:35,941
I'm trapped.

352
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:38,270
That social worker's staked out
your living room.

353
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:42,100
I bet my mother's responsible.
It's so mortifying.

354
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:43,343
Maybe we should tell her.

355
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,740
What, that I never got on my plane

356
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:46,422
and hid out here
in your bedroom all night?

357
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:48,550
That would prove all the complaints
she had about you.

358
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:50,553
- So what do we do?
- Sneak me out.

359
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,802
Then I'll wait till she leaves
and head home.

360
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:53,970
Why wait?

361
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:56,081
Do you want that social worker around

362
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:58,432
when my mom's head explodes?

363
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:01,973
I'll move the ladder.

364
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:08,860
Look, I know you're nervous,

365
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:10,752
but when you talk
to her just be yourself.

366
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,152
I'm sorry to put you through this.

367
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:15,402
It's not your fault.

368
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:16,942
Carol Bloom's trying
to pin the problems

369
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,500
she having with Amanda on you.

370
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:20,320
Anyway, I thought I'd show off
some of your drawings.

371
00:19:20,337 --> 00:19:21,483
Can I go grab a few?

372
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:23,863
I don't wanna show them.

373
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:26,912
- They're beautiful.
- They're too personal.

374
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:28,750
Oh. Well, of course.

375
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:29,962
Then you may want to
take them off your wall

376
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:31,103
before she inspects your room?

377
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:32,653
When's that happening?

378
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,703
I'd like to delay explaining your tub

379
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:35,902
for as long as possible,

380
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,210
at least until you've won her over.

381
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:38,831
- Right.
- Make sure your room is ready

382
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,673
in case she insists on starting there.

383
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:43,960
So get back in there and
clear out anything incriminating.

384
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:45,992
Okay. I'll try.

385
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:58,883
- What are you doing here?
- What are you?

386
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,643
Amanda, we need...

387
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:13,392
- What are you doing here?
- That's what I want to know.

388
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:15,890
You said when she left,
we could spend more time together.

389
00:20:15,908 --> 00:20:18,482
- You did?
- Well, I...

390
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:20,752
And now she's climbing through
your bedroom window?

391
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:22,312
I asked you not to do that.

392
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:23,922
I had to see you right away.

393
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:24,881
Why?

394
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:26,920
- That's none of your business.
- Excuse me?

395
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:28,102
Why aren't you in New York?

396
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:29,782
That's none of your business!

397
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:31,640
Both of you, please!

398
00:20:32,477 --> 00:20:33,511
I'm already grounded!

399
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:35,392
There a social worker
investigating my family,

400
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:36,453
and I can't let her find two girls

401
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:37,623
who aren't supposed to be here

402
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,662
fighting in my room!

403
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,022
You both have to go.

404
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:44,891
Now.

405
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:47,251
Declan?

406
00:20:53,595 --> 00:20:55,191
How come I got stuck doing this part?

407
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:56,931
You hid it, you lift it.

408
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:59,683
That ladder weighs a ton.

409
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:02,062
Thank god the cavalry's here.

410
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:04,933
Your leg okay?

411
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:08,000
A little wobbly, but...
there's beer to be liberated

412
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,683
and damsels to be rescued, so...

413
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:14,060
I must say I'm impressed.

414
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:15,752
You coming here helping Lori out,

415
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:18,402
even though
she's still closed for business.

416
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:19,923
Jerk!

417
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:23,842
Oh, smart! Leave a bruise
with a social worker present.

418
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:26,051
Josh? I need you.

419
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:27,463
Go, go, go!

420
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:31,000
Our room's up here
with Josh and Lori's.

421
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:32,941
Kyle's got the spare one downstairs.

422
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:34,123
I'll show you around down there

423
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:36,283
after you've had a chance
to talk to everybody.

424
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:38,662
Hello, mother.
What can I do for you?

425
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:41,673
This is Mrs. Berlinger.
She'd like to see your room.

426
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:44,413
But of course.
It's this one right here.

427
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,502
The one that says "Josh" on the door?

428
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:48,160
Exactly.

429
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:03,182
Looking for an escape route?

430
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,701
I just need to get some fresh air.

431
00:22:04,718 --> 00:22:05,933
Yeah. I don't blame you.

432
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:08,090
Well, hopefully she'll be
quick and painless.

433
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:09,733
If she asks you about Amanda,

434
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,903
I think you should say
you hope she's having a great time.

435
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:13,170
but knowing how her mother feels,

436
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:15,993
you recognize
the appropriate boundaries.

437
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:18,053
Boundaries.

438
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:19,900
Right.

439
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:22,702
- Will you excuse me?
- Sure.

440
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:26,881
And this is Lori's room.

441
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:28,692
- They're coming!
- Lori?

442
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:38,573
Constance Berlinger,
my daughter Lori.

443
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:46,593
And welcome to my... den of teen angst.

444
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:50,362
Which I must confess,
I retreat to way too often.

445
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:53,422
Not kyle, though.

446
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:54,762
Not Mr. Positive Spin.

447
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,762
You should let some light in here.

448
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:09,203
What are you doing?

449
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,711
What does it look like I'm doing?

450
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:13,930
I need to move the ladder.

451
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:16,291
That's gonna be
a little difficult right now.

452
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:29,162
Can you not touch that?

453
00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:31,350
I don't think Kyle
would want you to handle it.

454
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:33,141
How would you know?

455
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:35,393
I know that box
is very important to him.

456
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:39,522
Do you know why it's important to him?

457
00:23:39,675 --> 00:23:40,671
Because I do.

458
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:43,040
Oh, really? Why?

459
00:23:44,427 --> 00:23:46,002
I can't share that information with you

460
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,700
and neither can Kyle.

461
00:23:49,598 --> 00:23:52,002
You have no idea about what Kyle and I

462
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:53,950
share with each other.

463
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:57,291
I know you don't know him
as well as you think.

464
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:01,422
You can't go through the window

465
00:24:01,436 --> 00:24:03,361
and the social worker's
about to start my interview

466
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:05,300
with a clear view of the front door.

467
00:24:05,547 --> 00:24:06,923
So I'm still stuck?

468
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:08,192
Not necessarily.

469
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:09,712
I'll get jessi out of here first.

470
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:12,190
And if I can't get back to you,
look for my signal then go.

471
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:13,383
What kind of signal?

472
00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:15,483
I'm not sure yet.
You'll just know.

473
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,480
Come with me.

474
00:24:31,218 --> 00:24:32,562
Finally, we can talk.

475
00:24:32,575 --> 00:24:34,433
- Later.
- No.

476
00:24:34,677 --> 00:24:36,221
This is important.

477
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:45,733
Here.

478
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:49,170
It's their song, D4.

479
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,153
It's the missing record
from the jukebox.

480
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:52,141
Where did you get this?

481
00:24:52,155 --> 00:24:53,813
I found it in my room.

482
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,643
Brian said he didn't leave it
there for me,

483
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:57,352
but I don't know who else would.

484
00:24:57,737 --> 00:24:58,942
You have to play it.

485
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,962
I will... but I can't right now.

486
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:03,212
It's part of our history.

487
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:07,031
I know, but I need to focus
on my family right now.

488
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:11,132
Brian said that you would be like this.

489
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:13,752
He said I couldn't count on you.

490
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:16,421
Why would he say that?

491
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:18,212
You keep sending me away.

492
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:20,243
Jessi, you know the situation today.

493
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:22,671
So what if some social worker
sees me here?

494
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,503
She can't see anything out
of the ordinary.

495
00:25:24,518 --> 00:25:26,740
We are out of the ordinary.

496
00:25:26,836 --> 00:25:28,502
Don't forget,

497
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:31,023
I'm more like you
than any of these people here,

498
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:33,220
more than the Tragers
and more than Amanda.

499
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:35,053
Why do you have to make
this a competition?

500
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:37,252
There should be no competition.

501
00:25:37,468 --> 00:25:39,670
Jessi! Jessi!

502
00:25:39,686 --> 00:25:41,733
- I'll leave when I want.
- Jessi.

503
00:25:42,655 --> 00:25:44,332
I didn't know you were here.

504
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:46,140
She was just leaving.

505
00:25:48,587 --> 00:25:49,992
Hi, there. And you are?

506
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:52,530
- Jessi.
- A friend of Kyle's?

507
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:55,963
Well, I'd like to think
I'm more than that.

508
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,520
Well, I started off
as Nicole's patient,

509
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:03,942
but now it's like
I'm part of the family.

510
00:26:05,776 --> 00:26:07,230
How lovely.

511
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,080
Well... bye.

512
00:26:51,006 --> 00:26:53,273
How long was Jessi your patient?

513
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:54,840
For a few months.

514
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:57,022
You treated her here?

515
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:59,302
Yes, but I don't see patients
at home anymore.

516
00:26:59,316 --> 00:27:01,950
Because they kept
becoming part of the family?

517
00:27:03,307 --> 00:27:04,820
What'd she say?

518
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:06,830
"Mrs. Trager,

519
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:09,873
you seem to have a history
of getting too involved emotionally."

520
00:27:09,885 --> 00:27:11,863
At least nicole has emotions.

521
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,810
You realize that eavesdropping
is an invasion of privacy

522
00:27:15,828 --> 00:27:17,273
and that me asking you to do it

523
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:18,681
is unacceptable parenting, right?

524
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:20,160
- Right.
- Good.

525
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:21,203
What did she say now?

526
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:25,222
24 cases, 20 ladder rungs each way.

527
00:27:25,235 --> 00:27:27,141
Just a few weeks post-op.

528
00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:29,620
You know I'll owe you for,
like, ever, right?

529
00:27:29,635 --> 00:27:31,603
I'm already making a list of the ways

530
00:27:31,656 --> 00:27:33,032
you can make it up to me.

531
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:35,490
No way. We made a deal.

532
00:27:35,507 --> 00:27:37,872
Oh, I think we should
amend our deal to include

533
00:27:37,887 --> 00:27:40,622
one-time payments for heroic measures.

534
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,931
You want me to lose
my born-again virgin status

535
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:44,461
because you helped me move beer

536
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:46,251
so you can bring it to a party
that I can't even go to?

537
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:48,322
Um, pretty much.

538
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:51,933
You're technically doing it
to help Kyle anyway,

539
00:27:51,948 --> 00:27:54,813
which you always do
for no return favors.

540
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:58,091
And now that I think about it,
I'm mad at you

541
00:27:58,108 --> 00:27:59,613
because how come you never
ask him for anything,

542
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:03,023
and yet I get propositioned
for casual, meaningless sex?

543
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:05,922
Meaningless sex? Really?

544
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:09,260
Not meaning...
You know what I mean.

545
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,170
No. No, I'm not so sure that I do.

546
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:14,630
Don't get mad.

547
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:18,053
I'm being a jerk, huh?

548
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:20,681
Tell the boy something
he doesn't already know.

549
00:28:20,695 --> 00:28:22,380
Not a good time, Josh.

550
00:28:22,688 --> 00:28:23,473
Look,

551
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:25,033
I enjoy the
"are they or aren't they" drama

552
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:26,363
as much as the next person,

553
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:29,031
but you two seem to have gotten
a little sidetracked.

554
00:28:29,637 --> 00:28:30,902
Yeah, I'm on it.

555
00:28:30,915 --> 00:28:33,090
While you're at it,
figure out how to explain

556
00:28:33,106 --> 00:28:34,173
why kyle sleeps in the bathtub.

557
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,961
Well, he's got a cover story for that.

558
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:37,291
The one his fake parents used.

559
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:38,713
Yeah, but that's a lie,

560
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:40,201
and you know
how Kyle is with the lying.

561
00:28:40,215 --> 00:28:41,602
Meanwhile, he's had Amanda

562
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:44,353
secretly hidden in his room
for the last 12 hours.

563
00:28:44,368 --> 00:28:47,361
Even if Kyle the rebel makes
an appearance,

564
00:28:47,578 --> 00:28:49,262
pretend you're the social worker.

565
00:28:49,276 --> 00:28:51,721
Does any cover story explain
why two responsible parents

566
00:28:51,737 --> 00:28:54,422
would allow their child to sleep
in a bathroom appliance?

567
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,093
Kyle,

568
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,360
Mrs. Berlinger wants
to speak to you now.

569
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:11,941
Just another day in the Trager house.

570
00:29:12,805 --> 00:29:14,590
Maybe that's why she's here.

571
00:29:14,797 --> 00:29:16,871
No, seriously.
With everything that's happened

572
00:29:16,886 --> 00:29:18,763
since Kyle came into our lives,

573
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:20,291
what seems everyday to us

574
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:23,221
may be just plain weird
to everybody else.

575
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:24,922
Yeah, maybe you're right.

576
00:29:25,076 --> 00:29:27,153
How many kids help take down
a multi-national corporation

577
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,532
over the weekend?

578
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:32,701
So, Kyle, how would you describe
your time with the Tragers?

579
00:29:33,187 --> 00:29:34,980
They've been wonderful to me.

580
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:37,170
I had no one when they took me in,

581
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:38,703
and they became my family.

582
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:40,550
But you found your family?

583
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,440
You were reunited
with your real parents.

584
00:29:45,096 --> 00:29:47,652
Leaving the Tragers
was extremely difficult.

585
00:29:48,818 --> 00:29:51,273
When I was gone,
I missed them terribly.

586
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:57,333
And what was it like coming back here

587
00:29:57,347 --> 00:29:58,790
after your parents died?

588
00:29:59,436 --> 00:30:01,953
<i>She was trained
to pickup on non-verbal cues.

589
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:06,861
<i>A twitch, a tense grip of my hands,
a nervous gesture,

590
00:30:06,876 --> 00:30:09,572
<i>anything that could indicate
I wasn't being truthful.

591
00:30:09,588 --> 00:30:10,863
Kyle?

592
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:13,723
Even though the circumstances
were tragic,

593
00:30:14,255 --> 00:30:16,202
I knew I'd be in a home
where I felt loved

594
00:30:16,256 --> 00:30:17,860
and well taken care of.

595
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,603
I'd like to know more about
your relationship with Nicole.

596
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:28,551
<i>This was Amanda's chance to escape,

597
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,553
<i>but there was no way she could know it.

598
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:32,822
<i>I had to signal her, but how?

599
00:30:32,838 --> 00:30:35,870
When did it become more maternal
than professional?

600
00:30:35,887 --> 00:30:37,810
<i>I knew if I relaxed and concentrated,

601
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:40,233
<i>I could control the flow
of electrons through the house.

602
00:30:45,296 --> 00:30:47,631
Nicole and I had a special bond
from the beginning.

603
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:50,153
<i>I felt a special connection
with everyone here.

604
00:30:50,345 --> 00:30:52,271
They've all taught me
something important.

605
00:30:53,956 --> 00:30:56,180
<i>All of the abilities
I'd explored seemed useless

606
00:30:56,195 --> 00:30:58,540
<i>If I couldn't help Amanda
sneak out of the house.

607
00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:00,000
<i>I had to focus,

608
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:02,170
<i>just not look like I was focusing.

609
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:07,812
<i>They've all welcomed me
as one of their own.

610
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:11,201
My life has changed for the better
by living here with them.

611
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:14,801
What kinds of things
have they taught you?

612
00:31:16,386 --> 00:31:17,792
I think the most important thing is

613
00:31:17,848 --> 00:31:19,412
what it means to be a family.

614
00:31:20,775 --> 00:31:22,201
<i>Am I passing your test?

615
00:31:22,628 --> 00:31:24,032
<i>This isn't a test.

616
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:26,230
<i>It merely helps me evaluate...

617
00:31:26,245 --> 00:31:28,772
<i>whether or not this is
a loving and nurturing environment.

618
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:30,661
Something like that.

619
00:31:30,706 --> 00:31:31,572
I don't understand.

620
00:31:31,587 --> 00:31:34,181
How can you quantify
a family's love for one another?

621
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:37,283
How can you measure intangible
things like nurturing?

622
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:40,462
It's just a tool that
social services uses.

623
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:42,373
A standard checklist.

624
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:45,420
<i>I need to get Amanda past
the kitchen and out of the house.

625
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,110
If it's a checklist you need,

626
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:50,992
let me give you mine.

627
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,811
<i>They gave me a seat
at their dinner table

628
00:31:52,825 --> 00:31:54,382
<i>when I had nowhere else to go.

629
00:31:55,277 --> 00:31:56,793
<i>Stephen gave up his work room

630
00:31:56,805 --> 00:31:58,611
<i>so I could have my own place to sleep.

631
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,580
<i>Josh taught me how to play basketball.

632
00:32:02,155 --> 00:32:03,993
<i>And Lori shared her birthday with me.

633
00:32:04,326 --> 00:32:08,450
<i>And Nicole always made me
feel safe and protected,

634
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:10,773
<i>even when I felt lost and scared.

635
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:12,363
<i>I could go on and on

636
00:32:12,418 --> 00:32:15,132
<i>cause this family means
everything to me.

637
00:32:15,928 --> 00:32:17,150
Interesting.

638
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:29,190
Oh. Oh, gosh.

639
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,931
I'm sorry. Oh!

640
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,241
- Amanda?
- Mom?

641
00:32:46,158 --> 00:32:47,852
Someone from the airline called

642
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,420
telling me you never got on the plane.

643
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,920
- Mom...
- You deliberately defied me, Amanda.

644
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:53,171
I didn't plan any of this!

645
00:32:53,186 --> 00:32:55,810
This kind of deceitful,
impetuous behavior.

646
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:57,683
You never would have done it
if it weren't for him.

647
00:32:57,698 --> 00:32:58,943
Carol, I know you're upset,

648
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:00,771
but it's really unfair to blame Kyle.

649
00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:03,580
He has fill her head with
god-knows-what nonsense,

650
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:05,042
now she is lying to me,

651
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:07,983
and she is throwing away
everything she has worked for.

652
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:10,242
That was my choice.
It has nothing to do with Kyle.

653
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,693
But you came here and
ran to him, didn't you?

654
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:13,633
Yes, but...

655
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:15,670
And you let her in, did you not?

656
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,863
Yes, but it was late...

657
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,943
And my daughter spent the night here,

658
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:21,031
and you knew nothing about it, did you?

659
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:24,421
It's that kind of loose,
permissive attitude...

660
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:25,762
Mom, stop!

661
00:33:26,235 --> 00:33:27,930
The Tragers are an amazing family,

662
00:33:27,946 --> 00:33:29,953
and Kyle is the most incredible person.

663
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:32,613
The real problem is you have no idea

664
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:35,233
and no interest in who I am
or what I want.

665
00:33:35,248 --> 00:33:36,341
So maybe you should ask yourself

666
00:33:36,358 --> 00:33:37,900
why I was so afraid to talk to you

667
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:40,193
that I hid here all night
instead of coming home.

668
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:43,291
If you wanted to report
a really messed up family,

669
00:33:43,307 --> 00:33:44,623
uou should have reported our own.

670
00:33:44,635 --> 00:33:45,951
What are you talking about?

671
00:33:46,097 --> 00:33:48,412
Everyone knows you called
social services here.

672
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:50,143
I did nothing of the sort.

673
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:57,071
I'm sorry, Mrs. Trager.

674
00:33:59,096 --> 00:34:01,021
I didn't mean to cause you
so much trouble.

675
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,542
I'm sorry.

676
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:18,101
Well, clearly that's a private
family matter,

677
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:20,651
not one social services could resolve.

678
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:23,331
- Then we're done.
- For now.

679
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:25,132
I still need to file my report.

680
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,460
Is there anything else I can tell you?

681
00:34:26,475 --> 00:34:28,132
No, no. I'll just...

682
00:34:28,147 --> 00:34:30,660
Oh, wait. There is something
I've overlooked.

683
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:31,850
Kyle's room.

684
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:34,592
- What about it?
- I need to see it.

685
00:34:38,397 --> 00:34:39,513
Is there a problem?

686
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:41,362
No, not at all.

687
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:44,472
It's this way.

688
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:47,913
We've always believed in

689
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:50,211
making Kyle feel
as comfortable as possible,

690
00:34:50,227 --> 00:34:52,142
and we encouraged him
to make his room his own,

691
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:55,020
which includes some unorthodox choices.

692
00:34:55,038 --> 00:34:57,243
Believe me, I've see hundreds
of teenagers' rooms

693
00:34:57,258 --> 00:34:58,830
with the most eccentric designs.

694
00:34:58,846 --> 00:34:59,862
Nothing can throw me.

695
00:34:59,877 --> 00:35:01,351
Well, always a first.

696
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:02,563
This is it.

697
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:26,231
This all seems quite ordinary.

698
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,962
If you ask me, perfectly normal.

699
00:35:31,317 --> 00:35:32,180
Thank you.

700
00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:35,393
You'll receiver notice
of my evaluation within 48 hours.

701
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,040
I don't suppose
you could give me a little preview.

702
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:42,801
It's not easy when someone drops in

703
00:35:42,816 --> 00:35:44,942
and puts your whole family
under a microscope.

704
00:35:44,956 --> 00:35:46,443
But yours survived.

705
00:35:46,597 --> 00:35:48,561
And Kyle seems like
a promising young man.

706
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:50,961
I don't see any reason
to be concerned about him.

707
00:35:50,978 --> 00:35:52,261
Thank you.

708
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:55,060
I do, however, have some
gave concerns about you.

709
00:35:55,698 --> 00:35:57,513
The way you've crossed boundaries,

710
00:35:57,528 --> 00:35:59,481
mixing your personal
and your professional life

711
00:35:59,497 --> 00:36:02,682
shows an alarming lack of judgment
and ethical integrity.

712
00:36:03,158 --> 00:36:06,062
It would be remiss of me
if I didn't file the proper notice.

713
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:10,763
I'm shocked that you feel that way.

714
00:36:11,318 --> 00:36:12,512
Really?

715
00:36:12,678 --> 00:36:14,020
Knowing what I've heard about you,

716
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:15,552
it doesn't surprise me at all.

717
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:23,322
How'd you get a bed in here?

718
00:36:23,738 --> 00:36:25,581
I just found it this way.

719
00:36:34,768 --> 00:36:36,060
Beer?

720
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:38,093
Soft, firm, and extra firm.

721
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:39,261
Where did it all come from?

722
00:36:39,278 --> 00:36:41,601
Does it matter? We saved the day.

723
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:43,861
Lori, you have how many
cases of beer in this house?

724
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:47,361
Not to drink. I was storing it
for some friends.

725
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:49,731
And I know that's, like,
the most idiotic move ever.

726
00:36:49,748 --> 00:36:51,280
So go ahead and do what you need to do.

727
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:52,820
Well, you're staying grounded,
that's for sure.

728
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,103
I know it got you into trouble,

729
00:36:55,115 --> 00:36:57,153
but thank you for doing this.

730
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,642
All of you.

731
00:36:59,997 --> 00:37:01,322
Thank you for today.

732
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:03,151
We should celebrate.

733
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:05,051
Let's crack open a few, make a toast.

734
00:37:05,066 --> 00:37:06,541
Well, say good-bye to this beer.

735
00:37:06,555 --> 00:37:07,872
Come on, everybody out.

736
00:37:22,488 --> 00:37:23,711
Come in.

737
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,150
You've been in here all day.

738
00:37:31,297 --> 00:37:33,110
A lot to catch up on.

739
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:44,151
I don't want to disturb you, I...

740
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:46,322
I just wanna say that
I know letting Amanda stay here

741
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:47,952
without telling you was wrong,

742
00:37:48,326 --> 00:37:49,611
and I'm sorry.

743
00:37:50,788 --> 00:37:52,111
It's funny.

744
00:37:52,616 --> 00:37:53,670
What?

745
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:56,583
How even with the best of intentions,

746
00:37:56,597 --> 00:37:59,143
making one questionable decision can...

747
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:01,441
Lead to such a mess.

748
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:04,841
I think things are still
gonna be a mess

749
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:06,783
for me and Amanda with Mrs. Bloom.

750
00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:08,593
Well, hopefully, in time,

751
00:38:08,607 --> 00:38:11,663
She'll cool off and
won't see you as an issue.

752
00:38:18,488 --> 00:38:20,050
Is everything all right, Nicole?

753
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,771
Everything's fine.

754
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:38,263
Damn, Josh.
You scared the living...

755
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:40,180
Hey, hey!
You eat with that mouth?

756
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:42,252
It's been a long day.
What do you want?

757
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:43,563
I just thought we could spend a moment

758
00:38:43,575 --> 00:38:44,952
and reflect on a job well done.

759
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:46,742
I still can't believe
we actually pulled it off.

760
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:47,792
Please.

761
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:49,530
Child's play to one that is adept

762
00:38:49,548 --> 00:38:51,990
in the black arts of adult deception

763
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:54,761
as your gifted yet humble brother.

764
00:38:56,478 --> 00:38:57,851
Lucky Declan was there.

765
00:38:58,666 --> 00:38:59,781
Yep.

766
00:39:00,826 --> 00:39:03,922
On the saving your bacon scale,
I'd say he scored about nine.

767
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:06,523
8.5. What's your point?

768
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:07,550
Nothing.

769
00:39:09,108 --> 00:39:11,212
I know I'm a new player
in the great game

770
00:39:11,227 --> 00:39:12,711
of adolescent relationships.

771
00:39:12,806 --> 00:39:14,283
But if you ask me,

772
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:17,430
I'd say the big D
is carrying the proverbial torch.

773
00:39:18,865 --> 00:39:21,721
Yes, sirree.
He's tasted from the fountain of lor,

774
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:22,831
and he wants to dive right...

775
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:23,883
Finish that sentence,

776
00:39:23,927 --> 00:39:26,101
and I guarantee you
they'll never find the body.

777
00:39:26,368 --> 00:39:28,930
- Hey, I was just saying...
- Get out.

778
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:57,511
Amanda.

779
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:03,731
I'm sorry.
I'm not allowed to let you in.

780
00:40:03,746 --> 00:40:05,052
I'm not allowed to go in.

781
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:07,711
I just wanna make sure you're okay.

782
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:10,203
I'm still grounded, but I'm fine.

783
00:40:10,347 --> 00:40:11,460
How about you?

784
00:40:12,437 --> 00:40:13,792
My mom and I talked.

785
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:15,833
She's still hurt and angry, but...

786
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:18,813
at least she listened more
than usual this time.

787
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:21,131
That's encouraging.

788
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:23,493
Unfortunately,

789
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,793
she won't let me see you,
outside of school, for a while.

790
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:29,401
And I need to get a job to be
more mature and responsible.

791
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:32,872
To tell you the truth,
after the way I've handled things,

792
00:40:33,368 --> 00:40:34,722
I don't really blame her.

793
00:40:35,647 --> 00:40:38,363
Well, I'll learn to be more mature
and responsible with you.

794
00:40:43,098 --> 00:40:43,993
That song.

795
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:49,393
That's the one you asked me to play

796
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,283
when you and Jessi
were out somewhere.

797
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:53,033
You never told me why you needed it.

798
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,422
It helped us get where we needed to go.

799
00:41:04,397 --> 00:41:05,712
Kyle,

800
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:08,631
if there's ever anything you
want to tell me,

801
00:41:10,247 --> 00:41:11,843
I hope you know you can.

802
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:14,062
I do know that.

803
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,462
Okay.

804
00:41:17,848 --> 00:41:19,062
Well, good night.

805
00:41:19,386 --> 00:41:20,682
Good night.

806
00:41:35,755 --> 00:41:37,003
<i>Only a day had passed

807
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:38,721
<i>since my decision to hide Amanda,

808
00:41:38,736 --> 00:41:40,173
<i>and allowing her to stay in the house

809
00:41:40,186 --> 00:41:42,483
<i>seemed to leave her with
new questions about me.

810
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,891
<i>Still, I didn't regret
making that choice

811
00:41:45,316 --> 00:41:46,833
<i>because it's worth taking risks

812
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:48,771
<i>to help the people you care about.

813
00:41:48,808 --> 00:41:50,430
<i>And that day, I knew that my family

814
00:41:50,446 --> 00:41:52,242
<i>was willing to take risks for me,

815
00:41:52,568 --> 00:41:55,211
<i>that our love for each other
could never be questioned

816
00:41:55,536 --> 00:41:58,631
<i>and that the secrets
we keep remain unexposed.

817
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:04,481
I've been to his home.

818
00:42:04,557 --> 00:42:06,353
He's very attached to the family.

819
00:42:06,367 --> 00:42:07,361
It could be a problem.

820
00:42:13,018 --> 00:42:15,792
<i>But now I understand
why you believe he's the one.

821
00:42:17,305 --> 00:42:19,653
<i>After no further questions,
I'd like to say again

822
00:42:19,696 --> 00:42:22,312
<i>what an honnor it is
to be at your service.

823
