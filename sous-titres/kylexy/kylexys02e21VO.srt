00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01,830
<i>Prevously on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:04,146
I think I'm sensing a thaw
with my mom's concerned.

3
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:06,449
If she letting us study together,
a date can't be far behind.

4
00:00:06,636 --> 00:00:08,356
- Mrs. Bloom?
- Yes?

5
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,251
Can I take Amanda to the prom?

6
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:11,706
Maybe.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,100
Yes.

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,735
Maybe I am lazy
and I lack study skills

9
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:17,147
but I've changed.

10
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:19,420
And I'm gonna do something
important with my life.

11
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:22,458
My test results are back.
I'm officialy in remission.

12
00:00:22,685 --> 00:00:24,232
I'm finally comfortable
with where we are.

13
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:26,281
- Which is?
- Friends.

14
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,661
- Friends.
- Without benefits.

15
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:29,621
Brutal.

16
00:00:29,716 --> 00:00:31,552
- Did you hear any of that song?
- Hum... Not really.

17
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,120
- Come in here.
- Why do his opinion matter?

18
00:00:34,276 --> 00:00:35,170
He knows music.

19
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,571
Brian told me all about the girl
in the picture, Sarah.

20
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:40,383
<i>He said he created me from Sarah's
genetic material after she died.

21
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:42,870
"The Biochemistry Departement
cancel the final exam

22
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,650
after discovering honnor student
Sarah Emerson stold the test and

23
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:48,112
vandalized the lecture hall
in the science building."

24
00:00:48,237 --> 00:00:49,603
She gave everyone the answers.

25
00:00:49,837 --> 00:00:51,271
My mother was awesome.

26
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,070
The way you've cross boundaries

27
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:54,960
mixing your personnal
and professionnal life

28
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:57,981
<i>shows an alarming lack of jugdment
and ethical integrity.

29
00:00:58,137 --> 00:00:59,560
<i>Challenge yourself.

30
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:01,841
Incredible.

31
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:04,563
Nead a break?

32
00:01:05,255 --> 00:01:06,421
I'm just getting started.

33
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:07,620
I'm fine.

34
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:09,862
<i>You can't keep doing this
to yourself.

35
00:01:10,017 --> 00:01:11,460
Promise me you'll stop.

36
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:14,112
I promise.

37
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:15,021
<i>Where did you get this?

38
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,221
Someone left it for Jessi.
We don't know who.

39
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:20,241
Sarah and I used to burried messages
for each other beneath the music.

40
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,592
<i>We translate the sounds into images.

41
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:25,791
<i>I gave Sarah a Latnok ring
with a red stone.

42
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:28,202
- I thought Sarah was dead.
- She is.

43
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:38,231
Never miss.

44
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:43,641
<i>Every day, we face questions
of right and wrong,

45
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:47,532
<i>and decisions about wether to take
actions or stay out of the game.

46
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:50,473
<i>And it's when those choices
are at least clear

47
00:01:50,518 --> 00:01:52,393
<i>that draw upon our conscience,

48
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:54,350
<i>follw our instincts,

49
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:56,353
<i>and reveal our true character.

50
00:01:58,086 --> 00:02:00,973
This is like the one place on the world
where I almost got the edge on you.

51
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:04,551
What are you gonna to do now?

52
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:13,630
Like I said, almost.

53
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:15,443
I do have an advantage.

54
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:17,602
Tell me about it, pod boy.

55
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:19,460
I'm talking about your ankle.

56
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:22,110
You've been favoring your good one.

57
00:02:22,796 --> 00:02:25,043
Just hope the coach
at U-Dub don't notice.

58
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:25,972
U-Dub?

59
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:28,801
I'm working out there next week
to show them what I can do.

60
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:31,590
Can't let this bum ankle slow me down.

61
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,460
So, what's up with you?

62
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:42,681
How are things with you and Amanda?

63
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:45,281
It's good.

64
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:47,280
Her mom's let me take her
to the prom.

65
00:02:48,756 --> 00:02:51,572
I just... gotta think
of the right way to ask her.

66
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:54,072
Dude, it's not a marriage proposal.

67
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:56,460
I just want it to be perfect.

68
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:58,313
Who will you taking?

69
00:02:58,556 --> 00:03:01,782
Oh I love that book,
how do you like it?

70
00:03:02,537 --> 00:03:04,260
I'm not reading,
I'm listening.

71
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:06,053
Listening?

72
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:11,752
You know that's a really bad habit
eavesdropping on people.

73
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:13,982
Tell me you wouldn't do it
if you could.

74
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:19,322
So what did they saying?

75
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,662
Kyle just ask Declan
who is taking to the prom.

76
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:24,921
Really?

77
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:26,371
And ?

78
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:34,172
They're talking about
Declan's ankle again.

79
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,293
Damn.

80
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:36,603
Mr. Trager.

81
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:40,421
I've just redceive the result from
the placement exams. Please sit down.

82
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:48,531
And your score... went up by
an astonishing 27% over last year.

83
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,843
That's awesome.

84
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:54,993
Mr. Trager I take great pride in what
the students in Beachwood can accomplish

85
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:58,971
- Thank you.
- Which is why I find this situation,

86
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:00,613
so disturbing.

87
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:07,232
You're a former remedial student
from a C average.

88
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:09,623
- C plus.
- Yes, well.

89
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:14,942
It's just not possible to make
such a dramatic leap without

90
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:16,491
assistance.

91
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,630
Mr. Hooper I busted my ass studying.

92
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:20,442
Mr. Trager...

93
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll take that test again,
right here, right now !

94
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:27,211
There are too many other average students
who scored well above the norm.

95
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,803
Now something
is going on here,

96
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:33,082
and I promise you
I'm going to find out what.

97
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:36,672
I will not tolerate
cheaters at my school.

2x21 - Grey Matters</b>

101
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:54,151
That makes you feel better?

102
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:57,933
The banana got Marie Antoinetted
because I can't do it to Hooper.

103
00:04:58,086 --> 00:04:59,071
The funny thing is,

104
00:04:59,227 --> 00:05:02,003
if you had asked me who Marie Antoinette
was about three months ago,

105
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:03,472
I would have probably said

106
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:06,162
that French foreign exchange
student with the acne.

107
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:08,461
But I've been applying my-self.

108
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:11,162
I found a new leaf
and turned that puppy over.

109
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,871
I know how much work you've been doing.
You wouldn't cheat after all that.

110
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:17,763
Would you ?

111
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:20,282
You're the human lie detector,
you tell me.

112
00:05:25,197 --> 00:05:25,911
You didn't cheat.

113
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:31,281
Now convice Hooper. Make the world
safe for bananas everywhere.

114
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:34,763
Tropical splendor, your favorite.

115
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,362
I didn't order this.

116
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:38,483
You're here,
I just assumed you'd asked.

117
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:40,133
Thank you.

118
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:44,963
Amanda, speaking of asking...

119
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,722
Can I have a straw?

120
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:53,590
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:01,933
Step into my office.

122
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:07,842
It's about the prom.

123
00:06:11,515 --> 00:06:13,393
Mrs. Bloom said I can ask Amanda.

124
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:16,033
But I don't know how.

125
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:17,820
I'll take this one.

126
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:21,830
Amanda, would you go
to prom with me?

127
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:26,751
It's that easy?
I mean I thought...

128
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:29,450
If it were that simple,
you're must be missing something?

129
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:30,673
Well, yes.

130
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:35,230
And you came to your goddesses of all
things oestrogen for the real skinny.

131
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:38,430
You came to us for a girl advice.

132
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:39,851
Just ask her.

133
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:46,253
- I'll do it now.
- No!

134
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:48,192
You can't do that.

135
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:50,231
Look at her, she's way too busy.

136
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,782
And she's a big chunk of kiwi
stuck in her hair.

137
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:55,492
Okay.

138
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,253
I'll do it when she goes on her break.

139
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,413
She will have low blood sugar
and her feet will hurt.

140
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:02,762
I thought you said this was simple.

141
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:06,042
The question is simple
but the timing of the question...

142
00:07:06,196 --> 00:07:08,012
Needs to be perfect.

143
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:14,750
I heard you're ankle hearts.

144
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:17,118
Did it makes the news?

145
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:20,872
I think I can help you.

146
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:23,271
I know how to work through pain.

147
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:25,393
Maybe I take yours away.

148
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:29,212
Okay.

149
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:32,190
Well not, not here,
it has to be a secret.

150
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,773
And you can't tell Kyle.

151
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:35,780
Why?

152
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,910
Beacause he doesn't like
when I do special things.

153
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:46,332
You know, thanks, but heu, I think
I'm gonna let it heal on it's own.

154
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:53,303
<i>It's good that
you haven't told Jessi.

155
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:56,482
It will be wrong, to gave her hope that
her mother is alive

156
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:57,472
before we're sure.

157
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:00,293
And I'm concerned that
she might tell Taylor.

158
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:02,482
What do you think he might do?

159
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:06,063
Use that information to try to restore
his standing with Latnok.

160
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:09,260
The same reason he keeps
pushing Jessi.

161
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,743
To impress them.

162
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:12,271
There's no point.

163
00:08:12,886 --> 00:08:14,231
Latnok is down with him.

164
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:27,293
Who ever sent this is very concerned
about remaining unexposed

165
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:29,630
But if it is Sarah...

166
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:31,832
why would she fake her own death ?

167
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:34,991
Why would she stay hidden
all this time ?

168
00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:38,563
Because people hide
when they're afraid.

169
00:08:39,348 --> 00:08:41,843
Or, when they want
to reinvent themselves.

170
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:45,673
Or when they're secretly healing
themselves from a gunshot wound.

171
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:46,532
True.

172
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:51,400
But if she really is alive why is she
contacting me now,

173
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:52,811
and not you?

174
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:55,693
Because I faild her when she needed me.

175
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:01,180
I can't believe principal Hooper.

176
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:03,973
He was completely inappropriate
to hurl an accusation like that

177
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:05,572
at you after the effort
you've made.

178
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,822
I've been profile based on
a past reputation, we should sue.

179
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:10,773
You're sure your case
would hold up in court?

180
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,303
Please. I may have cut
a few corners back on a day,

181
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,090
but I'm an honest-to-God B student now.

182
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:17,430
Well I think principal Hooper
needs a good talking to.

183
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:18,182
I'll go with you.

184
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:19,893
Oh no, no. You don't need
to miss your class.

185
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:21,201
I can handle him.

186
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:23,612
Go Mrs. Trager !

187
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:30,560
Now this one.

188
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:37,393
That's too heavy.

189
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:38,693
Be positive.

190
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,890
That's right,
you can do it.

191
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:19,292
Why did you stop?

192
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:22,301
Ah, I'm bleeding.

193
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:24,763
Just wipe it off and keep going,
you're doing so well.

194
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:26,690
Don't quit.

195
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:32,181
Look, we need to show them
that you weren't a mistake.

196
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:35,571
We need to prove
to Latnok that we matter.

197
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:39,241
Well, all I do is training here,
day after day...

198
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:42,613
Time come, when we'll prove to them
what you can do.

199
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,403
Meanwhile, why don't we change up
your routine a little bit?

200
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:52,043
Tomorrow we'll take it outside.

201
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,383
Okay, yeah.
That sounds good.

202
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:58,203
In the mean time...

203
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:00,842
Let's try it again.

204
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:07,002
Hooper said there are other students

205
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:09,042
whose grades didn't match
their usual grades.

206
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:10,473
And apparently I was involved

207
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:12,953
in a crappy stutend cheating ring
I didn't know about.

208
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,031
How would that work?
I mean if you could have cheated.

209
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:18,743
I guess the old me may have
considered a cheat sheet.

210
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:21,850
Impratical in this case,
way to much material to cover.

211
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:23,630
Any other methods?

212
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:27,693
Sneaking a peek at someone else's answer
is an option,

213
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:31,290
but I sat between Darryl Tibb,
who was wasted at the time,

214
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:34,743
and Kim Tresa,
hot as Hell but not mental giant.

215
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:36,832
If anything,
they cheated off me.

216
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:39,823
My only crime was doing better
than Hooper expected me to.

217
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:43,103
I should've bombed as usual
and avoided this mess.

218
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:46,253
- No, you eran that score.
- Yeah, I did.

219
00:11:46,495 --> 00:11:48,082
I really want to keep it.

220
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:51,992
Good night.

221
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:53,082
Good night.

222
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:04,091
Keep my secret.

223
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:12,560
Anonymous

224
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:19,243
Are you Sarah?

225
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:29,662
Sarah?

226
00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:36,632
You can't accuse Josh of cheating
because his score has improve.

227
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:39,690
- If you look at his record...
- That was last year.

228
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:41,721
He's finally made a commitment
to his education.

229
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,563
You shoul be applauding that
not condamning him without any proof.

230
00:12:44,716 --> 00:12:48,913
Mrs. Trager, in my experience,
numbers lie far less thant people do.

231
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,203
And unfortunately,
this number show that

232
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:53,702
you have two suspected cheaters
living in your home.

233
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:55,682
Now you're sugesting Lori is involved?

234
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:57,643
No. No, not your daughter.

235
00:12:58,385 --> 00:12:59,290
Kyle?

236
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:00,820
Come in.

237
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:03,403
Hi.

238
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:05,182
You got to be kidding me.

239
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:07,100
Why would the smartest kid
at your school

240
00:13:07,258 --> 00:13:09,550
bother to cheat on a test
he could take blindfolded?

241
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:12,623
Mr. Hooper, Josh didn't cheat,
neither did I.

242
00:13:12,978 --> 00:13:15,070
It is come to my attention
that someone

243
00:13:15,176 --> 00:13:17,233
hacked in the district's
computer system,

244
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,093
downloaded the test and then posted
them on some sort of secret web site.

245
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:22,821
The results being

246
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:27,590
that students who are failing their
courses managed to ace their exams.

247
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:32,052
I want you to show me that web site
and tell me who logged onto it.

248
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:34,242
I don't know anything about a web site.

249
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:37,020
You can't target Kyle
for posting those tests

250
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:38,580
even I'd know how to do that.

251
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:39,990
Yes,

252
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:42,710
but hacking in
the district mainframe is

253
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,421
only slightly harder
than breaking into Fort Knox

254
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:49,401
Now, you know any other student here
that coul do that,

255
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:50,713
besides him?

256
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:55,611
What were you thinking?

257
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,542
What do you mean?
It's so Sarah.

258
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:59,973
So Sarah got trouble
for what she did at U-Dub

259
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,520
Because she got caught.

260
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:05,212
And she gave away the answers
to the test, I just post the questions.

261
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,690
Why ? For attention ?

262
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,881
No. Everyone was complaining
about the exams.

263
00:14:09,946 --> 00:14:11,441
I just wanted to help them.

264
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:13,242
Except Hooper think I did it.

265
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:16,532
And now Josh and everyone who scored
higher than expected is under suspicion.

266
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:18,082
Well, maybe they cheated.

267
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:20,500
Or maybe they studied
really hard like Josh did.

268
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:23,670
Look, all I did was post the test
and help spread the word a little.

269
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:26,312
I'm not responsible for anyone
who log on to check it out.

270
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:33,500
- What is it?
- Nothing.

271
00:14:33,745 --> 00:14:35,821
Jessi, you promised you'd stop
pushing yourself.

272
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:37,133
I'm fine.

273
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:41,152
Just got me worked up a little.

274
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:42,993
Are you going to turn me in ?

275
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:45,881
No.

276
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:48,503
Thanks.

277
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:06,560
Hi. Why is everyone smiling at me?

278
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:09,481
Well, word's out you're the hacker
who posted the exams.

279
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:10,900
I didn't.

280
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:12,663
I know that, but they don't.

281
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:15,090
They're impressed by someone
who helped people cheat?

282
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:17,723
Everyone looks for an edge,
it's human nature.

283
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,051
Did you look at the web site?

284
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,431
No, but I would have
if I'd have known about it.

285
00:15:21,698 --> 00:15:24,341
You've got to built an advantage
over anyone at this school.

286
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:27,072
So a sneak peek at that test
sort of leveled the playing field.

287
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,761
They still have to look all the answers
so it's not...

288
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:34,511
- Is your ankle any better?
- The same, which sucks.

289
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,763
I'll catch you later.

290
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,420
Been there, done him.

291
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,681
And him.

292
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:50,473
We've been watching the same parade
of neanderthals since 7th grade.

293
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:54,161
I suppose I could tap into my inner
lesbian and go with a hot cheerleader.

294
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,541
You have an inner lesbian?

295
00:15:56,826 --> 00:16:00,350
To not have to go stag to prom
I would inner anything.

296
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:03,392
Any news on the DJ?
I need to finalize the budget.

297
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:07,043
- I'm working on it.
- On it or on him?

298
00:16:07,195 --> 00:16:08,790
You seriously have to stop with that.

299
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:10,462
You're interested in the DJ?

300
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:14,551
I am not interested in the DJ!

301
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:17,963
Is there a smart girl quote
for what just happened there ?

302
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:20,673
<i>Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

303
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,140
- Thank you smart girl.
- You're welcome.

304
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:25,692
So, has anything delicious
happened to you today?

305
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:26,923
Hillary!

306
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:29,041
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

307
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:33,042
We're talking about smart girls
and smart but clueless boys

308
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:35,961
who need their friends' help to
pave the glorious way to prom.

309
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:38,831
Stop it.
You're gonna spoil it for her.

310
00:16:38,986 --> 00:16:40,582
Spoil what?

311
00:16:42,657 --> 00:16:44,442
Both of you, spill.

312
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:48,641
I can't help it.
It is too cute.

313
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:50,243
You're gonna be so excited.

314
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:58,052
You really think you can help me?

315
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:00,100
What changed your mind?

316
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:05,153
My ankle hurts. It's really tight and
I gotta be at the top of my game.

317
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:08,330
- You want to be the best.
- I want to be my best.

318
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,860
- I know what that's like.
- So you're still into it?

319
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:16,030
Well, the truth is I've... I've never
done anything like it before.

320
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,111
Give it a shot.

321
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:22,380
Okay. Just promise
that you won't tell Kyle.

322
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:26,611
- I promise.
- Okay.

323
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:32,970
So he thinks you're the hacker?

324
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,721
Does Hooper know who is dealing with?

325
00:17:34,826 --> 00:17:37,053
You're mister "pure as snow,
I can not tell a lie".

326
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:40,273
I don't know about that, but I guess
he thinks I'm smarter enough to do it.

327
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:43,400
Hooper thinks you're not smart enough
to do well, so you must have cheated.

328
00:17:43,785 --> 00:17:45,970
And you're really smart,
so you must be the hacker.

329
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:47,991
We're both victims
of Hooper's twisted logic.

330
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:49,023
And I'm telling you...

331
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:52,753
forget the bananas, because I'm going
straight to Hooper and I'm go...

332
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:55,902
Hey hey Mr. Hooper!
How's it going?

333
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:57,841
Well I'm very disappointed.

334
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,732
I had hope my students
would show more conscience,

335
00:18:00,886 --> 00:18:02,662
but so far no one's come forward.

336
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:05,251
It's force me
to consider canceling the prom.

337
00:18:06,898 --> 00:18:08,522
What does the prom
have to do with this?

338
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:11,232
Nothing. As soon as you show me
the web site.

339
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:14,090
Mr Hooper, I told you,
it's the first I've heard of it.

340
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:17,210
Then maybe you can tell me
who is responsible

341
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:19,840
and I'll take your cooperation
into account.

342
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:24,613
I am merely trying to protect
the legitimate score of honest students.

343
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,951
Yeah, me included.

344
00:18:30,157 --> 00:18:32,050
Why did they look mad at you?

345
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:36,361
I think they blame me because
principal Hooper might cancel the prom.

346
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:37,852
Because of the web site?

347
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:41,023
He wants to know
who posted the exams.

348
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:45,863
Okay. You want me to tell?
Fine.

349
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,472
But a lot of other people going
to get into trouble if I do

350
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,351
and I don't think you'd like it.

351
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:52,021
What do you mean?

352
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:54,442
If I show Hooper my web site,

353
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:57,802
he could trace the IP adresses of
every computer that logged onto it.

354
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:00,222
I started to already
and kept a list.

355
00:19:00,376 --> 00:19:01,471
Why did you do that?

356
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:04,191
Because I like to see
the people I help.

357
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:07,852
No, I don't want to see that.

358
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:10,612
You need to,
to understand why Hooper can't.

359
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:20,880
You still want me to tell him?

360
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:34,961
Hey.

361
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:36,283
Hi.

362
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,332
The Hooper patrol's got you down, huh?

363
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:40,271
Yeah.

364
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:41,843
Let me whip you up today's special.

365
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:43,721
You'll love it, it's fantastic.

366
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:47,950
Maybe later.

367
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,470
Amanda, I need to ask you something.

368
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:57,133
Okay. Please, ask away.

369
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:02,231
There was a web site where someone
posted the placement tests in advance.

370
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,062
Did...

371
00:20:07,696 --> 00:20:11,893
It's none of my business.
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

372
00:20:12,135 --> 00:20:13,650
I already do.

373
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:18,841
I heard a rumor about the web site
and logged on.

374
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:23,050
When I got to the cover page
I just couldn't go through of it.

375
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:24,833
I click right off.

376
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:26,862
I never saw any of questions.

377
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:29,182
But why did you even go there?
You always get A's.

378
00:20:29,337 --> 00:20:32,463
I fell so far behind when I came back
from the conservatory.

379
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:35,692
When I heard about the web site
I guess I just couldn't resist.

380
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:40,640
- I'll tell Hooper what I did.
- No, don't do that.

381
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:44,403
You and Josh didn't do anything
and you're getting so much grief.

382
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:46,631
Amanda, how many people
were tempted

383
00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:49,343
or look just because they were curious?

384
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:53,501
Don't say anything to Hooper.
I'll figure a way out.

385
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:58,011
<i>Yes Mr Taylor?</i>

386
00:20:58,167 --> 00:20:59,882
Jessi is almost ready.

387
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:03,640
I know you don't approve
of my creating her.

388
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:07,512
But I appreciate the opportunity
to show you that it wasn't a mistake.

389
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,702
And I think you'll all be very impressed
with what she can do.

390
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:19,952
Holly crap!

391
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:22,683
How did you do that?

392
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:25,722
Everything with an atomic mass

393
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:29,101
have a gravitational field
that can be manipulated.

394
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:31,090
That simple huh?

395
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:34,101
It's a joke.

396
00:21:36,658 --> 00:21:38,783
Hey, you and Kyle
are so alike sometimes.

397
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:43,282
You... you haven't say
anything to him, have you?

398
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:47,783
No, but why is this such as secret?

399
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:49,951
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

400
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,122
My father would be mad.

401
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:59,731
So, you're out here every day?

402
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:02,733
Well I used to train inside,

403
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:05,121
but now start by running 13 miles.

404
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:08,211
Wait. You warm up
with a half-marathon?

405
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:11,140
I have to condition
myself so I'm ready.

406
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:13,162
For what?

407
00:22:17,057 --> 00:22:19,201
Let's check out your ankle.

408
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:23,350
Has your big brain figures out
how to clear both our names yet?

409
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:25,362
I'm working on it.

410
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:28,552
But I think it's only fair to tell you
I have access to a list.

411
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:32,002
It's a log of all the IP adresses
that looked at the website.

412
00:22:32,156 --> 00:22:33,231
How did you get that?

413
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:35,212
It's not important.

414
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:39,352
But your computer's not on there
so it's should help your case.

415
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:43,071
But I couldn't show it to Hooper
without ratting everyone else out.

416
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:45,661
- This is true.
- Then forget it.

417
00:22:45,818 --> 00:22:47,891
Nobody's taking the fall for me.

418
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:51,763
Dude, I've got morals.

419
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,381
I know, it's juste nice to see.

420
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:55,501
Now, huh...

421
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:58,843
Show me who's on that list.

422
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:03,871
Hey, I may have morals,
I still want to see who doesn't.

423
00:23:04,455 --> 00:23:06,323
I need to keep it confidential.

424
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:07,551
Figures.

425
00:23:11,118 --> 00:23:12,982
Man, it's sucks you may miss out

426
00:23:13,086 --> 00:23:15,252
if Hooper follows through
and cancels the prom.

427
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:18,082
Have you, asked her anyways?

428
00:23:18,627 --> 00:23:20,452
Bad timing.

429
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:25,641
Bye.

430
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:31,681
He's threaten to cancel prom?

431
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:34,793
Okay, that is not acceptable.
To strong arm you like that...

432
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:37,692
I'd like to take principal Hooper
and just...

433
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:41,871
You and Josh like to take
all your aggressions on food.

434
00:23:42,135 --> 00:23:43,421
Except he chops bananas.

435
00:23:43,527 --> 00:23:46,293
Yeah well,
pasta is much more satisfying.

436
00:23:46,788 --> 00:23:48,042
I have to call the superintendent

437
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:49,770
and tell him how
Hooper's been handling all this.

438
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:51,173
I wish you wouldn't.

439
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:53,660
Look Kyle, with you and Josh
both under the gun...

440
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:56,010
I mean, I know you want
to protect Jessi but...

441
00:23:57,358 --> 00:23:59,211
She is the one
who is responsible, isn't she?

442
00:23:59,365 --> 00:24:01,381
I don't want to get anyone into trouble.

443
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:03,513
She made a mistake.

444
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,350
- She needs to own up to it.
- She's willing to.

445
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:09,363
But that would mean
exposing some other people.

446
00:24:13,116 --> 00:24:15,090
How did it go to school today?

447
00:24:15,836 --> 00:24:16,873
Awesome.

448
00:24:17,027 --> 00:24:19,413
Unless you count the big black cloud
over my head.

449
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:22,233
What's the point of trying when
no one believes your grades anyway?

450
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:23,843
Well, I do.

451
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:32,701
Josh, I know it's been tough,

452
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:34,500
but I am proud of you.

453
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:39,440
I have to tell you, the way
you turned your grades around,

454
00:24:40,858 --> 00:24:44,831
and more important watching you
support Andy through her illness,

455
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:47,771
being such a loving friend,

456
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:50,840
I don't think I had that kind
of maturity at your age.

457
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:54,731
In fact,
I know I didn't.

458
00:24:56,086 --> 00:24:58,620
So you just keep doing what your doing.

459
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:01,813
Don't let the Hoopers of this world
get you down.

460
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,383
<i>PLEASE HELP JESSI.</i>

461
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,552
<i>What do you mean?</i>

462
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:35,602
<i>TAYLOR WON'T STOP
UNTIL HE DESTROYS HER.</i>

463
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:39,223
"Taylor won't stop
until he destroys her"?

464
00:25:44,718 --> 00:25:47,572
<i>HELP JESSI, HELP JESSI,
HELP JESSI, HELP JESSI...</i>

465
00:25:48,957 --> 00:25:51,942
What does that mean,
Taylor's trying to destroys her?

466
00:25:52,455 --> 00:25:55,730
Well, Jessi said she's stop pushing
herself but I can tell she's lying.

467
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:57,590
I can sens she's not well.

468
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:58,991
Maybe Taylor's behind it.

469
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:02,160
Well we still don't know who sent
those messages or wether to trust them.

470
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:03,973
I know I don't trust Taylor.

471
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,641
Oh, I hate to say this Kyle but...

472
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:10,133
I don't think I can get involve
when it comes to Jessi.

473
00:26:10,707 --> 00:26:13,153
My profesionnal conduct is in question.

474
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:15,592
That social worker who came here,
she cited me

475
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:18,051
for crossing ethical boundaries.

476
00:26:18,387 --> 00:26:20,071
You're the most ethical person I know.

477
00:26:20,485 --> 00:26:25,110
Thank you but the truth is I've...
I've skirted the rules now and then.

478
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:27,313
When I needed to...

479
00:26:28,028 --> 00:26:28,982
I've cheated.

480
00:26:29,317 --> 00:26:31,580
If you did, I'm sure
it was to help somebody.

481
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:34,552
Well, I need to be carefull now.

482
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:37,122
And since I am not
Jessi's therapist anymore...

483
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,442
I understand.

484
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:46,012
You've already done so much
to help Jessi.

485
00:26:53,597 --> 00:26:55,861
And that social worker
was wrong about you.

486
00:26:57,078 --> 00:27:00,292
When you think about it
if you hadn't skirted the rules...

487
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:03,353
I might not be here at all.

488
00:27:17,477 --> 00:27:21,190
- You look cranky.
- I can't get this verse right.

489
00:27:21,588 --> 00:27:24,003
Can't help you there.
I'm tone-deaf.

490
00:27:24,465 --> 00:27:27,042
- Hills, these are lyrics.
- I can rhyme a little.

491
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:31,222
Have to be careful with rhymes,
it's too pedestrian.

492
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:32,592
So Mark says.

493
00:27:33,557 --> 00:27:35,820
Why do you care so much what he says?

494
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:38,631
Once and for all...

495
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:41,793
this is a professional
one-song-only relationship.

496
00:27:41,897 --> 00:27:43,032
I hope so.

497
00:27:43,197 --> 00:27:46,853
Cause I really hate to see you blow off
Declan for a taste college boy pie.

498
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:48,221
Declan?

499
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,702
Can you honestly tell me that
you still don't feel the sparkage?

500
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:54,770
Decaln and I are in a really good place
right now, I don't want to mess with that.

501
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,863
Doesn't have to be a mess this time.

502
00:27:58,947 --> 00:28:00,663
Away with you now.
I need to be brilliant.

503
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:04,380
Fine. I've done my job.
Seed planted.

504
00:28:25,018 --> 00:28:26,672
<i>Good job, Declan.

505
00:28:27,645 --> 00:28:30,410
- Hey what's up?
- I was looking for Jessi.

506
00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:31,863
Yeah, I haven't seen her.

507
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:35,440
- It seems better.
- Oh, it is.

508
00:28:35,908 --> 00:28:37,272
Like magic.

509
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:44,751
What?

510
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:45,993
Your heart is racing.

511
00:28:46,097 --> 00:28:47,763
Yeah, I was just
kicking ass in that game.

512
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:50,131
Faster than when
you walked over here.

513
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:54,753
Oh, man, the CIA should snatch you up.

514
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:00,903
I told Jessi I wouldn't tell you,
but...

515
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:03,111
the whole thing
creeped me out a little.

516
00:29:03,216 --> 00:29:04,990
She did something.

517
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:07,150
I'm not sure how, but...

518
00:29:07,557 --> 00:29:09,793
she made my ankle
not hurt anymore.

519
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:11,760
What did she do exactly?

520
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:15,862
She touched my ankle,
and then she just concentrated.

521
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,722
I'm not into that whole
faith healer mumbo jumbo stuff but...

522
00:29:21,356 --> 00:29:23,701
it does feel a lot looser.

523
00:29:23,807 --> 00:29:26,082
Maybe she manipulated the joint
in some way.

524
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:29,211
Or maybe it's just
the power of sugestion.

525
00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:31,540
I was desperate for a fix.

526
00:29:31,975 --> 00:29:34,173
That tryout means everything to me.

527
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:35,781
I know it does.

528
00:29:35,886 --> 00:29:37,602
You just need to make sure
that your ankle's really healed

529
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:39,620
so you don't hurt it again.

530
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:41,031
Yeah, I get it.

531
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:45,622
- I appreciate you seeing me.
- Well, it sounded urgent.

532
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:49,241
- Please, sit.
- Thank you. I think it is.

533
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,500
We both know it's dangerous
for Jessi or Kyle

534
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:55,942
to expand their abilities too quickly.

535
00:29:56,418 --> 00:30:00,030
And it's come to my intention you may be
encouraging Jessi to do just that.

536
00:30:00,478 --> 00:30:02,150
It's come to your attention?

537
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:07,473
You know, you seem to have this
strange compulsion, Nicole,

538
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:09,541
to interfere
in other people's business.

539
00:30:10,587 --> 00:30:13,163
When a child's welfare is at stake,
it is my business.

540
00:30:13,428 --> 00:30:15,791
You are no longer
Jessi's therapist.

541
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:17,180
She's doing just great.

542
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:21,092
- I'd still like to talk to her.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.

543
00:30:21,977 --> 00:30:24,002
Well, I hoped we could deal
with this privately,

544
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,250
but I'll go over your head
if I need to.

545
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,363
What, by involving social services?

546
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:30,452
See, I don't think
you're gonna do that.

547
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:32,212
You're already on notice with them.

548
00:30:32,717 --> 00:30:35,903
And if you attempt
to contact Jessi in any way,

549
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:39,343
I will lodge a complaint with them,
I promise you.

550
00:30:39,997 --> 00:30:41,672
You'll just have to do that then.

551
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:44,400
You went to see Taylor?

552
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:46,482
And now I'm convinced
he's up to something.

553
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:48,972
He threatened to make trouble
if I don't stay out of it.

554
00:30:49,077 --> 00:30:49,971
Well, what do we do?

555
00:30:50,228 --> 00:30:53,120
Well, I'm not backing off.
Jessi could be in danger.

556
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:55,421
I'm not backing off, either.

557
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:57,623
We've been through a lot.

558
00:30:58,697 --> 00:31:00,551
We'll figure out
how to get through this too.

559
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:06,631
Nicole...

560
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:10,561
What made you change your mind
about getting involved?

561
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:13,392
You.

562
00:31:29,795 --> 00:31:31,203
Jessi.

563
00:31:31,695 --> 00:31:33,031
What are you doing here?

564
00:31:33,136 --> 00:31:34,562
I'm worried about you.

565
00:31:35,898 --> 00:31:37,472
Declan lied to me.

566
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:38,962
He promised.

567
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:42,730
I don't know why Taylor's pushing you,
but you need to stop.

568
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,723
Brian wouldn't let anything bad
happen to me.

569
00:31:45,827 --> 00:31:47,543
He cares about me.

570
00:31:47,645 --> 00:31:51,303
Does he care that your nose starts
to bleed every time you strain too hard?

571
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:55,342
Jessi, please don't listen
to him anymore.

572
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:57,900
What am I supposed to do?

573
00:31:58,006 --> 00:31:59,483
He's my father.

574
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:03,242
A real father
wouldn't push you this way.

575
00:32:04,026 --> 00:32:07,030
Yeah, well, he's all I have.

576
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:11,021
- Jessi.
- Go away.

577
00:32:11,586 --> 00:32:12,702
Please go away.

578
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:39,680
Mr. Hooper.

579
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:42,812
I think I have
what you've been looking for.

580
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,570
Well, Mr. Trager,
it's taken you a while,

581
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:48,481
But I'm pleased you finally decided
to follow your conscience.

582
00:32:48,587 --> 00:32:50,663
My conscience has always been clear.

583
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,670
I didn't post the exams.

584
00:32:53,697 --> 00:32:55,343
But I can give you
the internet addresses

585
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,662
of all the computers
that accessed the web site.

586
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:01,583
But you should know in total,
there were 774 hits.

587
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:02,703
Well, that's impossible.

588
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,232
The entire student body is only 812.

589
00:33:05,338 --> 00:33:07,050
Clearly, not all of us cheated.

590
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:10,710
Well, no, the scores
don't reflect that, but..

591
00:33:10,815 --> 00:33:13,801
So I can give you the list,
and you can trace the addresses,

592
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:16,123
but you can never be certain
Who simply checked out the rumor

593
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,861
and logged off right away.

594
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:21,902
And you definitely can't prove who
actually stayed to copy the questions.

595
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:30,280
The entire school will take
a new set of exams.

596
00:33:30,637 --> 00:33:33,413
It is the only fair thing to do.

597
00:33:36,457 --> 00:33:38,142
Mr. Trager,

598
00:33:38,456 --> 00:33:41,590
if you have those addresses then
you must know where the web site is.

599
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:44,992
Who created it, if not you?

600
00:33:47,837 --> 00:33:51,241
By withholding,
it makes you an accomplice.

601
00:33:51,348 --> 00:33:53,723
Doesn't that also make you a cheater?

602
00:33:54,547 --> 00:33:57,032
I guess you could look at it that way.

603
00:33:57,478 --> 00:34:00,031
But everybody needs to live
with their own choices.

604
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:26,920
You think I should tell him?

605
00:34:28,755 --> 00:34:32,421
I just wish you'd be more careful
about the things that you do.

606
00:34:49,175 --> 00:34:50,491
Have you seen Kyle?

607
00:34:53,485 --> 00:34:55,183
Prom's back on, have you heard?

608
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,370
You're such a sports movie cliché
right now.

609
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:04,692
Feels like the right place to mope.

610
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:06,383
Are you gonna tell me why,

611
00:35:06,486 --> 00:35:09,671
or are you still stuck
in the flashback of the glory days?

612
00:35:10,265 --> 00:35:11,753
My ankle hurts again.

613
00:35:19,235 --> 00:35:20,911
It started to feel pretty good.

614
00:35:21,546 --> 00:35:23,791
But that was just temporary.

615
00:35:24,008 --> 00:35:25,952
All in my head, or whatever.

616
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:28,021
Should've known.

617
00:35:28,558 --> 00:35:30,633
Nobody comes back
from a surgery like mine

618
00:35:30,738 --> 00:35:32,632
and rocks a college-level workout.

619
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:35,923
There will be other workouts, Declan,
and other colleges.

620
00:35:36,095 --> 00:35:38,632
It doesn't matter
if I'm not strong enough to play.

621
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:41,313
It happens all the time, you know.

622
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:43,450
People get injured, dream over.

623
00:35:45,927 --> 00:35:47,983
Well, look at the bright side,
there aren't many point guards

624
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:50,633
who fight evildoers
in their spare time.

625
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:54,722
Yeah, but with Kyle,
I'm just a sidekick.

626
00:35:55,915 --> 00:36:00,063
But out here with five seconds
on the clock, 3-point shot,

627
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:03,282
I'd sink 'em half the time
with my eyes closed.

628
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:09,023
And cue sad, fallen hero music.

629
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,410
Nice. Really helpful.

630
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:14,480
What, you were on the express train
Heading south to broodville.

631
00:36:14,587 --> 00:36:16,971
I'm pulling the emergency brake.

632
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:20,323
Besides, I don't think you could make
a 3-point shot with your eyes closed.

633
00:36:38,305 --> 00:36:39,810
Ha. Fluke.

634
00:36:40,238 --> 00:36:42,052
And your eyes weren't closed.

635
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:44,633
Fine, I'll do it again.

636
00:36:45,007 --> 00:36:45,970
You're on.

637
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:50,103
You're amazing.

638
00:36:50,897 --> 00:36:53,860
I mean,you know when to listen
and when to shut me up.

639
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:57,360
You totally get me.

640
00:36:58,397 --> 00:37:00,281
Why wouldn't I get you?
I mean...

641
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:02,200
friends get friends, right?

642
00:37:04,775 --> 00:37:05,520
Right.

643
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:16,513
You

644
00:37:26,818 --> 00:37:27,573
Kyle.

645
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:32,102
You did it.
You find a way out.

646
00:37:33,238 --> 00:37:36,320
I'm just not sure everyone's too happy
about having to retake the test.

647
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:38,992
It was the right thing to do.

648
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:42,482
Which, I hope you know,
I don't always manage.

649
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,841
Amanda, making the right choices
isn't easy for me, either.

650
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,200
But somehow, you always do.

651
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:51,913
Kyle, you're such a good person.

652
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:53,813
And I know you see me
in a certain way.

653
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:56,201
I jut feel like
I'm bound to disappoint you.

654
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:57,671
You could never do that.

655
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,593
You're you.

656
00:38:03,038 --> 00:38:04,961
Will you go to the prom with me?

657
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:07,892
I've been wanting to ask, but
the timing's never been right, and...

658
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:09,272
The timing is perfect.

659
00:38:11,766 --> 00:38:14,132
And yes, I would love to go with you.

660
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,220
Is it happy Hooper banana day?

661
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:36,380
You stopped the inquisition.
I've been exonerated.

662
00:38:36,645 --> 00:38:39,230
Wow, now I know
you've really been studying.

663
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:42,091
A few months ago, you didn't know
the words inquisition or exonerate.

664
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,480
A shot of wheat grass to celebrate?

665
00:38:45,218 --> 00:38:47,260
I'll take one of those beauties instead.

666
00:38:48,715 --> 00:38:52,012
What? ancer couldn't do it.
A pastry's not gonna kill me.

667
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:55,433
I could cheat now and then.

668
00:38:55,815 --> 00:38:57,523
Hey, don't look at me.
I'm no cheater.

669
00:39:13,035 --> 00:39:14,912
TONIGHT.

670
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:19,000
What will happen?

671
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:20,803
Hey, Kyle.

672
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:25,761
Another shout out
from Baylin's dead girlfriend?

673
00:39:26,286 --> 00:39:27,840
I'm still not sure.

674
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:30,941
But if she was smart enough
to stay hidden all those years,

675
00:39:31,297 --> 00:39:33,941
why would she send me ims,
knowing they can be traced?

676
00:39:35,757 --> 00:39:37,741
I'm hoping that's
a rhetorical question.

677
00:39:39,098 --> 00:39:40,912
Maybe she wants me to find her.

678
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:46,030
Right, so call up and
set up a date like a normal person.

679
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:47,433
Too risky.

680
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:50,590
Phone calls, ims, emails,
can all be intercepted.

681
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,630
Then what are you waiting for?
Start tracing.

682
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,961
Why aren't you training?

683
00:40:03,966 --> 00:40:06,480
I had a hard day, and I'm tired.

684
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:10,721
Well, you've got to push through
the fatigue.

685
00:40:13,856 --> 00:40:14,770
Jessi.

686
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,480
This isn't a game we're playing here.

687
00:40:17,925 --> 00:40:19,361
This is your future.

688
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:22,451
You told me I have to train
so I can impress Latnok.

689
00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:26,070
When? When am I gonna do that?

690
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:28,383
When I say you're ready.

691
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,570
Now get up.

692
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:34,683
My mother wouldn't treat me this way.

693
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,001
Your mother's dead.

694
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:10,970
In the past few weeks,
I received four ims,

695
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:12,630
each from a different computer,

696
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:14,631
and in four separate locations.

697
00:41:14,736 --> 00:41:16,000
The four dots.

698
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:19,650
They make a perfect square.
That can't be a coincidence.

699
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:22,741
But even you can't meet up
in four places at once.

700
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:24,673
Can you?

701
00:41:25,556 --> 00:41:27,712
If it's Sarah,
she must be leading me somewhere.

702
00:41:30,217 --> 00:41:32,381
Someplace inside the square?

703
00:41:33,985 --> 00:41:34,770
Exactly.

704
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:37,100
Eh, when you're hot,
you're hot.

705
00:41:38,647 --> 00:41:40,173
What'd I do?

706
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,511
X marks the spot.

707
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:53,070
I know that place.

708
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:57,331
I know where to go.

709
00:42:00,816 --> 00:42:03,921
<i>I realized the messages
I'd received were my test.</i>

710
00:42:04,677 --> 00:42:07,401
<i>Whoever sent them to me
needed me to solve a puzzle.</i>

711
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:13,451
<i>And only
when I found the solution,</i>

712
00:42:14,605 --> 00:42:16,701
<i>was I worthy of knowing
the answer.</i>

713
00:42:38,217 --> 00:42:39,081
Hi.

714
00:42:40,907 --> 00:42:42,042
Hello.

715
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:44,821
I'm Kyle.

716
00:42:45,918 --> 00:42:47,041
I know.

717
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:51,630
My name is Sarah.

718
00:42:55,307 --> 00:43:02,000
