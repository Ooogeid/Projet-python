1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,800
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,740
- You're Kyle.
- You're in my tub.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,032
We need what he knows.

4
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:08,141
<i>She's the only one
capable of getting it.</i>

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,300
I have a feeling we're more alike
than you think.

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,800
How sweet is this?

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,140
That's awesome. You're awesome.

8
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,500
Kyle, I'd like to introduce you
to the cerebral impulse relay, or CIR.

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,640
If it can work on him,
we can break through Kyle's firewall.

10
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:24,440
You can remove the information
that you require.

11
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:25,708
<i>I just spoke to the police.</i>

12
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:27,942
<i>They went to Emily's house
to look for Jessi.</i>

13
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:28,801
<i>She's run away.</i>

14
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,601
<i>He went after her, didn't he?</i>

15
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,941
Hopefully, Kyle can explain.

16
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:35,240
He's been hiding things,
and you've been helping him.

17
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:36,902
You lie. You've been lying.

18
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:37,941
Get out!

19
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:41,940
All Kyle has ever wanted
is to be a part of your family.

20
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,101
Bring our son home.

21
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:45,102
I'm leaving tomorrow.

22
00:00:45,457 --> 00:00:46,900
Will you be back in time
to say good-bye?

23
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:47,801
I wanna be.

24
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:49,242
- Who is he?
- Adam Baylin.

25
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,040
<i>He knows I'm here.
I think we can communicate with him.</i>

26
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:54,141
<i>Kyle, stop. She's betrayed you.</i>

27
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:56,642
I did it.
I took what they wanted me to.

28
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,300
- The information.
- You shouldn't have trusted me.

29
00:00:59,457 --> 00:01:00,502
No!

30
00:01:10,557 --> 00:01:11,503
Jessi!

31
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:14,300
Kyle, no!

32
00:01:14,856 --> 00:01:15,800
What are you doing?

33
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:18,900
- She jumped!
- She's already dead!

34
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:23,202
And you can't bring her back
by killing yourself.

35
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:26,901
She took it.

36
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:29,500
- She took what?
- Everything.

37
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:30,942
All the information in my head.

38
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:33,303
Everything I got from Zzyzx.

39
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:37,702
Well, maybe it's best
that it died with her.

40
00:01:38,856 --> 00:01:41,501
No one could have survived
that jump, not even you.

41
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:44,100
Before today, I didn't think
anyone could survive a gunshot.

42
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:48,502
Look, I know I owe you an explanation.

43
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:51,301
This was the plan
from the very beginning,

44
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:52,943
in case anything happened to Baylin.

45
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:54,801
He wasn't sure that
he'd be able to heal himself.

46
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,002
He still might not recover.

47
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:59,342
But he didn't want me to get
your hopes up unnecessarily.

48
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:00,303
In case he died.

49
00:02:04,855 --> 00:02:06,403
This is where you went.

50
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:09,302
When you left and wouldn't tell me.

51
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:10,803
You came here to take care of him.

52
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:11,740
Yes.

53
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,040
You were with me the rest of the time.

54
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:14,201
Was he up here alone?

55
00:02:14,356 --> 00:02:16,041
Members of Latnok looked after him.

56
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:17,350
Latnok?

57
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:19,442
They still exist?

58
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,301
Yes.

59
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:22,440
That ring that
you wear around your neck,

60
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:24,041
the box you found at Baylin's,

61
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:26,743
it all originated from Latnok.

62
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:29,400
They have Baylin's best interests,
and mine... and yours.

63
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:31,200
- I wanna see him.
- Not now.

64
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,942
I have to find a safer location.

65
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:37,943
You need to go home.

66
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:39,201
But I can help you.

67
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:41,700
Your family's waiting for you.

68
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:45,001
It's time for you
to tell them the truth.

69
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:10,753
Hi.

70
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:12,203
Hi.

71
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:20,803
I know you have a lot of questions.

72
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:24,802
I have a lot of answers, and I'm ready
to tell you everything.

73
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:31,003
None of it changes the way
I feel about all of you.

74
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,701
I hope that it doesn't change
the way you feel about me.

2x14 - To C.I.R. With Love</b>

<i>I told them how Adam Baylin created me.</i>

79
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:55,403
<i>Josh was wrong about me being an alien.</i>

80
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:59,203
<i>But as far as believing I came
from some place very different,</i>

81
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:01,000
<i>he was right on target.</i>

82
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,101
<i>I told them how Foss
saved me from Zzyzx,</i>

83
00:04:05,357 --> 00:04:08,501
<i>then later returned to destroy
it after Baylin was shot.</i>

84
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,502
<i>I told them how
Brian Taylor betrayed us.</i>

85
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,602
<i>How could Nicole have known that
by bringing me into her home,</i>

86
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:17,600
<i>she had also invited the danger
that would follow me?</i>

87
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,403
<i>I revealed how I enlisted Declan
as the keeper of my secrets.</i>

88
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:23,303
<i>And while I had gained an ally,</i>

89
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:25,142
<i>Lori had lost a boyfriend.</i>

90
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:27,400
<i>So I couldn't help wondering
if I had lost her.</i>

91
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:30,801
<i>I warned them
of the most recent danger.</i>

92
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:32,301
Madacorp.

93
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:33,842
<i>How they recruited Stephen</i>

94
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:35,402
<i>as an unwitting pawn in their game</i>

95
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:38,101
<i>and their agenda to get
what they wanted from me.</i>

96
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:41,802
<i>But I saved what I knew might be
the most troubling part for last.</i>

97
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:43,700
<i>I told them all about Jessi.</i>

98
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:46,100
We already know
that Jessi is different,

99
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:48,402
but she and I are a lot alike.

100
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,802
We were created the same way.

101
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,741
Ballantine programmed
her from the beginning

102
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:55,140
to get the information
that was inside my head,

103
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:57,100
the information I got from Zzyzx,

104
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:00,201
and she did.

105
00:05:04,658 --> 00:05:06,602
And then she jumped
from the edge of the dam,

106
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:09,500
and I couldn't save her.

107
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,303
And that's it.

108
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:19,801
That's everything.

109
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:37,403
That is so much cooler than
anything I've ever dreamed up.

110
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:43,203
<i>I knew that I'd given
the Tragers a lot to process.</i>

111
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:45,302
<i>I was anxious to hear their response,</i>

112
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:49,102
<i>but at the same time, I was afraid
of what that response might be.</i>

113
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:53,301
<i>Today would be the day I'd know if
I'd have to say good-bye to my family.</i>

114
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,402
<i>But it wasn't the only good-bye
I had to worry about.</i>

115
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:02,001
- Hello, Kyle.
- Is Amanda home?

116
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:04,000
She had to fly out this morning.

117
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,502
Orientation at the conservatory
started early.

118
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:10,603
Sorry you missed her.

119
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:13,501
I was just hoping I'd have
a chance to say good-bye.

120
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:15,802
I know. So did she.

121
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:18,802
Well, I know she'll be amazing.

122
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:21,600
She's never been anything but.

123
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:24,903
Thank you.

124
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:43,302
I didn't get a chance to say I'm sorry.

125
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:46,000
For everything.

126
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,903
I never meant for any harm
to come to this family.

127
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:02,503
Something wonderful
happened to this family.

128
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:08,100
You.

129
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:12,803
You could never do anything
to make us love you any less.

130
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:25,641
So what do we do now?

131
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:29,403
I do to Madacorp exactly what I did
to Zzyzx when I was inside the pod.

132
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:31,541
If Ballantine wants the information
inside my head,

133
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:33,242
he'll have to put me
in the CIR chair to get it.

134
00:07:33,255 --> 00:07:35,241
But you said you don't have
the information anymore.

135
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:36,601
But he doesn't know that.

136
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,342
Once I'm in the chair,
I can create an energy surge

137
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,943
that will burn out all
of Madacorp's servers.

138
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:42,201
Actually, you can't.

139
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:44,041
The CIR chair's specifically isolated

140
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:45,503
from the Madacorp mainframe.

141
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:46,901
But...

142
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:49,240
I can physically link it.

143
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:51,340
All I need is
a translink multi-induction cable

144
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:53,148
and access to the mainframe corridor.

145
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:55,942
If you can do that,
I'll make sure that Madacorp

146
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:57,401
can never do this to anyone again.

147
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,943
Great. When do we start?

148
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,043
As soon as possible.

149
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:02,640
Not today.
It's the Madacorp open house.

150
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:03,703
That's right.

151
00:08:03,806 --> 00:08:04,503
It's perfect.

152
00:08:05,555 --> 00:08:07,603
No, really. There'll be
a lot of people there, right?

153
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:08,340
Yeah.

154
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:09,702
It'll give us the perfect cover.

155
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:10,803
Great.

156
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,243
What are the rest of us supposed to do

157
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:14,301
while you two go storm the castle?

158
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:21,403
<i>Technology, science, art.</i>

159
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:24,903
<i>Only one company integrates all three</i>

160
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:27,200
<i>for the benefit of mankind.</i>

161
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:28,900
<i>Madacorp...</i>

162
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:34,601
How are you doing? I mean...

163
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:37,102
Now that you know all of my secrets.

164
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:41,902
I got dumped because Declan
wouldn't trust me with your secrets.

165
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:43,100
Do you know what that means?

166
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,903
This wasn't about me.

167
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,440
It wasn't my fault.

168
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:50,240
All this time, I've been worried
about what I did wrong

169
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:51,901
or what I could have done different.

170
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,202
I couldn't have done anything
because it wasn't me.

171
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:56,303
I'm free.

172
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:57,641
- Free?
- Yes!

173
00:08:57,656 --> 00:08:59,940
Free from all the drama
with a capital Declan.

174
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,242
Free from worrying about
anybody else's feelings but my own.

175
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:04,303
Free.

176
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:06,302
Thank you for this.

177
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:09,403
You're... welcome?

178
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:20,202
Just make sure you and the kids
stay close to the crowd.

179
00:09:20,556 --> 00:09:21,302
We will.

180
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:23,401
This is the safest place for everyone.

181
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,701
Ballantine won't do anything
with all those witnesses around.

182
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:28,601
Whoever thought when he hired you,
you'd be his undoing?

183
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:32,301
I'll be back in 45 minutes.

184
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:34,603
Good luck.

185
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,942
Okay. So, we know the drill.
Just act normal.

186
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,443
How can I act any another way?
Mom and Dad won't tell us anything.

187
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:49,242
All we have to do
is protect the secret.

188
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,501
I know the drill.

189
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:54,600
Everything Kyle told us, outside
of the family, we can't talk about.

190
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:55,701
Talk about what?

191
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:58,203
What are you doing here?

192
00:09:58,255 --> 00:09:59,002
Nice!

193
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:04,502
This is the Madadork... corp...
whatsit open house, right?

194
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:08,302
You invited me to this thing,
like, two weeks ago.

195
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:10,640
Remember? We planned to eat
every piece of food in the place

196
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:13,042
cause the chemo's gonna make me
ralph it back up anyway,

197
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:15,001
and you're totally holding
my hair back when I do.

198
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:19,101
Wait a minute. What's going on?

199
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:20,542
What? Nothing.

200
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:23,002
Right! I can always tell
when you're lying.

201
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,501
I'm not lying.
There's nothing going on.

202
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:28,501
We are so screwed.

203
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:40,903
I hear you've been looking for me.

204
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:49,303
I must admit,
I'm a little surprised to see you.

205
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:52,300
You're a businessman.
I'm here to make a deal.

206
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:54,002
You have terms?

207
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:55,701
A proposal.

208
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:58,502
A trade that mutually
benefits both partners.

209
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:00,501
So what is it we're placing
on the table?

210
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:03,300
I give you the information
inside my head.

211
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:05,001
You leave my family alone.

212
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:08,202
You talk like you know
what the information is.

213
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:11,303
I know it must be valuable if
you've gone to such lengths to get it.

214
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:12,901
Valuable?

215
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,443
<i>Thank you, Mr. Ballantine.</i>

216
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:18,201
More like priceless.

217
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,843
Oh, my God.
If this tastes half as good

218
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:35,803
coming back up as it does
going down, mmm!

219
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:46,600
Hey, good to see ya.

220
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:48,802
What are you doing?

221
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,100
Acting normal.

222
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:53,200
Well, stop acting normal.
You're freaking kids out.

223
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:55,303
What normal thing would you
be doing if you weren't...

224
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:58,402
You know, defending the greatest
secret of the modern world?

225
00:11:58,956 --> 00:12:00,902
Looking for a cute guy to hook up with.

226
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:04,600
What? I'm free to inspect the hotties.

227
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,642
Lori Trager's open for business.

228
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:09,203
I'm looking for a little...
customer appreciation.

229
00:12:09,757 --> 00:12:11,601
I've eaten nine pigs in a blanket,

230
00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:14,802
but my stomach can't take thinking
about you doing...

231
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:16,842
Business.

232
00:12:16,855 --> 00:12:18,642
Well, too bad for you,

233
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:19,943
because the next cute guy I see

234
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,100
is about to have a very memorable
open-house experience.

235
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:33,801
You gotta be kidding me.

236
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:41,902
What makes the information
so priceless?

237
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:44,941
20 years of highly sensitive
scientific research,

238
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,002
and you're the only one who has it.

239
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,202
There was no backup?

240
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:51,641
When you don't want people
to know what you're up to,

241
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:53,900
you're careful about how
you backup your information.

242
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:56,401
They, unfortunately,
were a little too careful.

243
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:58,143
Finally.

244
00:12:58,157 --> 00:12:59,802
I didn't think we'd ever get
to the front of this line.

245
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:04,002
How does a crepe booth
run out of crepes?

246
00:13:08,356 --> 00:13:09,300
Excuse me, sir, sorry.

247
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,441
It's just that you got the last crepe,

248
00:13:11,455 --> 00:13:13,542
and I was in line for so long,
and I really wanted one...

249
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:15,400
First come, first serve.

250
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:16,701
I have cancer.

251
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:27,873
I can't believe
you just used your cancer

252
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:28,943
to get a french pancake.

253
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,201
I can't believe I didn't use it
a long time ago.

254
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:33,503
Besides, do you know how freeing it is

255
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:36,203
not have to keep this big giant secret?

256
00:13:56,108 --> 00:13:57,501
What do you think you're doing?

257
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:04,800
Emily.

258
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:07,900
Making sure the protocols
are still online.

259
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:12,003
Stephen, you have no clue
who you're really dealing with.

260
00:14:13,155 --> 00:14:15,102
Leave now, and I will call security.

261
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:16,300
I can't do that.

262
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,302
You don't understand.
My family's in danger.

263
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:24,103
Think about what you would do
if it were your family.

264
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:27,202
I do understand.

265
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:32,302
Well, here we are.

266
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,403
So we have a deal?

267
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:38,201
Well, we would,
but there's just one problem.

268
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:40,902
You don't have what I want anymore.

269
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:43,801
But she does.

270
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:53,503
She survived.

271
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:57,203
You could call it that,
but she's in a lot of pain.

272
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:00,842
Information is like a thousand bees

273
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:03,901
buzzing around inside her head
trying to fight their way out.

274
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:07,702
The writing. She's trying to get it out
any way she can.

275
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:09,800
Well, I can make it easier for her.

276
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:14,300
It's all right, Jessi.

277
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:16,501
The men aren't here to hurt you.

278
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:19,203
Just remember what I promised you.

279
00:15:19,256 --> 00:15:20,500
Jessi, don't do this!

280
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:23,640
I just want them
to take it out of my head!

281
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:26,442
Then go with these men.
Everything will be fine.

282
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:28,242
Jessi, wait! You can't let him have it.

283
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:30,800
What could he possibly give you
that would make you do this?

284
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,603
So, now I have my own personal stalker.

285
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,600
Did you plant a tracking chip
on me when I was asleep?

286
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:47,242
Hillary told me where you were.

287
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:49,542
Look, I can't explain why,
but it's not safe to be here.

288
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:51,400
Madacorp is evil. I get it.

289
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:55,702
Kyle gave us the "previously on" recap.

290
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:03,402
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
I wanted to.

291
00:16:03,656 --> 00:16:05,540
I hated lying to you,
pretending that I didn't care...

292
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:06,701
I forgive you.

293
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,202
It's not that easy.

294
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,542
I've learned that sometimes

295
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:15,101
you have to let go of all the baggage
that weighs you down.

296
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:18,702
Which clearly you haven't.

297
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:21,702
Why do you still have all this stuff?

298
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:24,901
Never got around to tossing it.

299
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,802
Exactly my point.

300
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:37,602
Try it.

301
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:42,400
It's the everything but mix you made.

302
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:44,100
A remnant of the past.

303
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:46,502
Let's move forward.

304
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:52,902
Wow. You're right.
That felt really good.

305
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:55,800
Tickets to that concert we went to.

306
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:00,301
Mr. Wafflebean.

307
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:02,401
I won it for you at the carnival.

308
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,202
You think this is a sign?

309
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:34,901
I am thinking about my family,
Stephen.

310
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,502
Something that we both have in common.

311
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:51,303
Stephen, it's me.

312
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:53,201
I just checked on the kids,
and they're fine,

313
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:55,001
but I'm worried about you.

314
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:58,200
Where are you?
It's been over an hour.

315
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:01,301
Please let me know you're all right.

316
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:20,940
So, what are you thinking?

317
00:18:20,955 --> 00:18:23,840
More strawberry smoothies
or hit the seafood tower again?

318
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:25,802
I'm thinking we sneak inside.

319
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:28,001
There's gotta be some cool stuff
we can steal,

320
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,240
or at least break.

321
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:30,001
No, no, no!

322
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,203
That's, like, a really bad idea.

323
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:33,600
Okay, what's really going on?

324
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:35,143
You've been acting weird all day.

325
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,500
What aren't you telling me?

326
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:38,200
Nothing.

327
00:18:39,555 --> 00:18:40,402
Spill it.

328
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:44,103
Aw... you don't understand.
I can't tell you.

329
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,001
Can't or won't?

330
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:49,602
Fine.

331
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:52,703
If you wanna be the guy who keeps
secrets from the girl who has cancer...

332
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:56,302
I wanted to be a figure skater
until I was ten.

333
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,502
I used to have an O-town poster
above my bed.

334
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,603
You know those stupid letters
that spell "Josh" on my door?

335
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,940
I put them up,
not my mom like I told you.

336
00:19:04,956 --> 00:19:06,942
I used to try on Lori's training bra,

337
00:19:06,957 --> 00:19:09,100
and one time I took
a measuring tape and...

338
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:16,002
Are you okay? You look a little...

339
00:19:27,956 --> 00:19:30,101
I guess I'm gonna be the one
holding your hair.

340
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:39,802
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:40,257 --> 00:19:42,303
They got to me before
I could finish making the connection.

342
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:47,002
It's almost like they were
expecting something like this.

343
00:19:47,456 --> 00:19:50,202
They were. It was a trap.

344
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:56,002
Is this what was in your head?

345
00:19:57,158 --> 00:19:58,901
It must be random pieces of it.

346
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:01,902
When it was in my mind,
it was like a compressed file.

347
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,533
Like my brain compartmentalized it.

348
00:20:05,678 --> 00:20:08,142
Maybe Jessi's mind doesn't know
how to handle it.

349
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,742
Maybe the information wants out,

350
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:12,332
and she's trying to release it.

351
00:20:14,407 --> 00:20:17,471
Why would Ballantine
put Jessi in the chair to extract it

352
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:19,800
if she's writing it all out?

353
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:22,410
Because it would take her
about 57 years to finish.

354
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:28,722
Do you know what this is?

355
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:32,062
There's symbols here
I've never seen before.

356
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:36,443
But based on my memories of what
they were up to at Zzyzx,

357
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:39,171
I can't let Madacorp
get their hands on any of it.

358
00:20:41,997 --> 00:20:43,141
What's wrong?

359
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:46,653
It's Jessi. I can sense her.

360
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:47,872
How?

361
00:20:48,485 --> 00:20:49,652
I've always been able to.

362
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,681
I just didn't realize how
until a few days ago.

363
00:20:52,358 --> 00:20:53,982
It's like we're two wireless computers.

364
00:20:54,718 --> 00:20:56,431
But this is stronger.

365
00:20:57,178 --> 00:20:58,411
What do you mean, stronger?

366
00:20:59,845 --> 00:21:01,493
I think I can connect with her.

367
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:02,971
From in here?

368
00:21:02,987 --> 00:21:04,410
The more intense Jessi's emotions,

369
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:05,993
the more pronounced
her brainwaves become.

370
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,932
All right, Jessi,
while we extract the data,

371
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:22,071
we'll give you the memories
of the life you always wanted.

372
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,242
Jessi, welcome home.
Dinner's almost ready.

373
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:51,070
I made your favorites.

374
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:52,663
Spaghetti with mushrooms.

375
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:54,013
Thanks, mom.

376
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:57,231
Data's coming through now.

377
00:22:32,256 --> 00:22:34,481
Jessi, would you mind
setting the table for me?

378
00:22:34,516 --> 00:22:36,292
- Sure, mom.
- Thanks.

379
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:44,691
Don't do it.
Don't give them the information.

380
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:46,311
Get out of here!

381
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:52,300
Leave me alone!

382
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,322
Hey, Jess. You gotta check out
this mix I made for you.

383
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:58,120
I call it "songs to get
felt up by declan to."

384
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:00,391
Hey, Jessi, the food's gonna get cold.

385
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:02,421
Unless Josh eats it all first.

386
00:23:03,806 --> 00:23:05,403
I won't let you take this away from me.

387
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,891
This isn't real, it's an illusion.

388
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:11,253
<i>In other stories tonight,</i>

389
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:13,042
<i>Police are still searching for clues</i>

390
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:14,641
<i>that may shed light on the murder</i>

391
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:16,742
<i>of a hunter that was found
in the woods...</i>

392
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:28,483
Hey, are we going to the Rack later?

393
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:00,183
You can't escape from who you are.

394
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:05,660
I don't like who I am.

395
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:09,180
This life is no more real than
the one they gave you with Emily.

396
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:11,793
They can't make you a better person.

397
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:13,950
Only you can do that.

398
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:14,992
How?

399
00:24:15,006 --> 00:24:16,851
By choosing to be a better person.

400
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:23,101
I never meant to do
all those terrible things I did.

401
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:27,180
I just wanted them
to take it out of my head.

402
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:28,252
I know.

403
00:24:29,147 --> 00:24:31,260
This was never supposed
to be your burden.

404
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:32,893
It was always mine.

405
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:35,202
I can take the pain away...

406
00:24:37,596 --> 00:24:38,780
If you let me.

407
00:25:01,657 --> 00:25:02,890
What the hell's going on?

408
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,350
- We've lost the data. It's gone.
- Where'd it go?

409
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:08,931
There was a giant energy surge
in room 237.

410
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:17,081
You want the information?

411
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:19,161
You'll have to put me
in the chair to get it.

412
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,781
You can't do it.
It's too big a risk.

413
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:29,433
He's right.

414
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,083
Kyle, listen to me.

415
00:25:33,097 --> 00:25:34,610
Why would I ever listen to you?

416
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:37,300
Because if you don't,
you'll destroy yourself.

417
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:40,320
Don't resist.
Give Ballantine whatever he wants.

418
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,571
I can't do that.

419
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:46,433
This isn't Zzyzx.
They've taken precautions.

420
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:49,701
They will not allow you to take over
the system like you did before.

421
00:25:49,937 --> 00:25:51,502
If you try and fight the machine,

422
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:53,522
it will fry your synapses.

423
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:56,163
It'll turn that brilliant
brain into charcoal.

424
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:02,693
Think about everything
that you're meant to do.

425
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:05,233
Everything that Adam
would have wanted you to do.

426
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:07,240
Don't you dare mention his name.

427
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:18,683
He's about to make
the biggest mistake of his life.

428
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:24,202
What's gonna happen to me?

429
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,130
Don't worry about anything.
It's fine.

430
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:29,023
- Where are you taking me?
- Jessi, everything's okay.

431
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,253
Please.

432
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:34,513
Go back the way we came.
Take the elevator to the lobby,

433
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,372
get the hell out of here. Go.

434
00:27:50,476 --> 00:27:51,930
All systems normal.

435
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:53,953
Vitals look good.

436
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,132
We're ready, sir.

437
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:58,470
Begin the extraction.

438
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:06,512
- My god, Jessi! You're okay.
- They're coming!

439
00:28:10,228 --> 00:28:11,322
Oh, god.

440
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:13,460
Jessi, where's Stephen?
Where's Kyle?

441
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:14,792
They have them.

442
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:16,440
- I have to go back!
- No! Please!

443
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,630
- I have to help them.
- you can't. It's too late.

444
00:28:20,836 --> 00:28:23,443
Jessi, is there anything you can do?

445
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:24,473
No!

446
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:27,233
Jessi, Kyle always believed in you.

447
00:28:27,845 --> 00:28:29,932
He risked everything
trying to help you.

448
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:33,323
Jessi!

449
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:38,243
They're still in his active memories.

450
00:28:38,257 --> 00:28:40,823
Once we get past those,
we can get to the information.

451
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:43,692
Do it.

452
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:16,683
Sir, he's on the verge
of cardiac arrest.

453
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:18,482
- Keep going.
- You'll kill him.

454
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:19,871
Get him out of here.

455
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:21,602
Let's go.

456
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:26,941
<i>The harder I tried
to hold out against the chair,</i>

457
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,582
<i>the more I began to fear
that the chair was winning.</i>

458
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:34,383
Go to maximum power.

459
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,182
Jessi...

460
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,892
<i>And it threatened
to take everything I held dear.</i>

461
00:29:57,986 --> 00:29:59,161
What are you doing here?

462
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:00,871
Choosing to be a better person.

463
00:30:12,596 --> 00:30:14,910
This is it. Are you ready?

464
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:17,261
I'm ready.

465
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:18,722
Let's end this.

466
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:36,332
There's some kind of power surge.

467
00:30:47,385 --> 00:30:48,942
Do not do this, Kyle.

468
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:17,340
Did it work?

469
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:21,662
I don't know how,
but I think you did it.

470
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,042
Jessi!

471
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:52,132
Kyle?

472
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:56,382
Why is it so dark?

473
00:31:56,446 --> 00:31:57,952
We caused a blackout.

474
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:00,821
The city's been dark for hours.

475
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:02,633
You brought me here?

476
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:05,200
Shh. Just rest for now.

477
00:32:05,598 --> 00:32:07,043
It takes a lot out of you.

478
00:32:07,315 --> 00:32:08,783
You seem to be okay.

479
00:32:09,198 --> 00:32:10,791
I've had more practice...

480
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,332
And definitely more training.

481
00:32:13,928 --> 00:32:16,111
But don't worry.
We'll work on that.

482
00:32:21,578 --> 00:32:22,792
You know,

483
00:32:24,037 --> 00:32:25,913
I couldn't have done it
without you today.

484
00:32:25,925 --> 00:32:27,281
Ballantine will never know
how close he came

485
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:28,960
to getting what's in my head.

486
00:32:28,976 --> 00:32:31,900
He'd broken through,
but you saved me in the nick of time.

487
00:32:33,896 --> 00:32:35,312
You did a good thing.

488
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:40,612
It was nice to do
something good for a change.

489
00:32:45,317 --> 00:32:46,831
What's gonna happen to me?

490
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:49,493
Nicole's looking for
a foster-care placement.

491
00:32:49,506 --> 00:32:51,262
I'm sure she'll find you a good home.

492
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,862
A real one this time.

493
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,371
She's been so kind.

494
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:04,761
After everything I've done,
you all keep helping me.

495
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,113
I'm happy to do it.

496
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:11,390
Do you think I'll ever be happy?

497
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:20,482
She looks happy.

498
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:24,640
That's not me.

499
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:26,652
I think it could be you some day.

500
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:34,593
I'm so sorry for what's happened.

501
00:33:37,378 --> 00:33:39,870
All the feelings I had for you,
and what I did at the dam.

502
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:42,623
Madacorp was responsible.
None of it was your fault.

503
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,990
That's not who you really are.

504
00:33:48,138 --> 00:33:49,633
You're free.

505
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:53,492
And so are you.

506
00:33:58,207 --> 00:34:01,820
So everything that
was inside my head, it's gone?

507
00:34:01,835 --> 00:34:04,563
Not gone, just in a safe place.

508
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:26,202
The city traced the blackout
back to Madacorp.

509
00:34:26,955 --> 00:34:30,970
Seattle's blackout is now
our biggest public relations nightmare.

510
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,842
I've been contacted by the board.

511
00:34:33,757 --> 00:34:35,661
Apparently, Brian Taylor's connections

512
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:38,430
Go a lot higher than I anticipated.

513
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,571
You already know this.

514
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:43,860
What I didn't know

515
00:34:44,076 --> 00:34:47,812
Is that you were doing everything
without Madacorp's knowledge.

516
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:49,973
One thing I learned in Iraq,

517
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:52,392
you can only fly
under the radar for so long.

518
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:53,893
Am I to take it, Ms. Hollander,

519
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:56,463
that you won't be resigning after all?

520
00:34:57,076 --> 00:34:58,920
I've decided to stick around.

521
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:07,392
You're too soft.

522
00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:08,982
You take things personally.

523
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:11,572
You don't have
the constitution for my job.

524
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:15,251
I think you might be surprised
with what I can accomplish.

525
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:23,960
This is all Baylin's stuff.

526
00:35:23,976 --> 00:35:25,603
He'll be back for it.

527
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,432
Is he gonna be okay?

528
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:29,470
One day, yeah.

529
00:35:31,405 --> 00:35:32,921
You're leaving, aren't you?

530
00:35:33,237 --> 00:35:34,901
You think I don't need you anymore.

531
00:35:35,615 --> 00:35:36,881
Your family will watch over you,

532
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:38,911
and they'll help you
with your training.

533
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:43,700
I don't want to do it without you.

534
00:35:43,717 --> 00:35:47,811
Well, you might not want to,
but... you can.

535
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:51,810
Where will you go?

536
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:54,692
I'll be around.

537
00:36:01,135 --> 00:36:02,440
That's everything.

538
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:20,402
Do you remember what you told me the
night that you brought me back here?

539
00:36:21,206 --> 00:36:23,230
When I thanked you for everything
you'd done for me?

540
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:25,921
I told you to be worth it.

541
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:28,401
That's what kept me
going through all this.

542
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:31,240
With what you've lost in your life,

543
00:36:31,538 --> 00:36:33,690
you still gave everything
so that I could have mine.

544
00:36:36,147 --> 00:36:37,823
I'm gonna work as hard
as I can every day

545
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:39,390
so that I can be worth it for you.

546
00:36:40,718 --> 00:36:42,003
You already are.

547
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:05,241
I guess the lights aren't back on
in your neighborhood either.

548
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:08,563
Yeah. Citywide blackout
strikes just as you and I

549
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:11,360
are about to take a trip
down route sixty-slut.

550
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:13,762
Someone's trying to give us a sign.

551
00:37:14,206 --> 00:37:15,640
Not very subtle.

552
00:37:15,657 --> 00:37:16,552
I'd say there was someone out there

553
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:19,173
who did not want me
to de-revirginize you.

554
00:37:19,345 --> 00:37:20,473
You know about that?

555
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,560
Are you kidding?

556
00:37:21,576 --> 00:37:23,612
None of the guys at school
have been able to get any

557
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:25,853
since revirginization
started sweeping the nation.

558
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:28,060
You know, the whole purpose of that

559
00:37:28,078 --> 00:37:30,430
was so that I wouldn't let
"boy drama" run my life anymore.

560
00:37:30,445 --> 00:37:31,721
How'd that go?

561
00:37:31,775 --> 00:37:33,851
So it took a little while to kick in.

562
00:37:37,425 --> 00:37:41,313
But I've had more fun
with you today

563
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:42,693
than I've had all year,

564
00:37:42,706 --> 00:37:45,102
And I think it's because...

565
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:47,191
I'm finally comfortable
with where we are.

566
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:49,213
Which is?

567
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:50,912
Friends.

568
00:37:51,748 --> 00:37:52,630
Friends.

569
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:55,151
- Without benefits.
- Brutal.

570
00:37:57,355 --> 00:37:59,423
But I think we should make a pact.

571
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:02,021
If neither of us have met
anyone else by prom,

572
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:05,052
We can finish what we started
in the car today.

573
00:38:05,556 --> 00:38:07,160
- Yeah?
- Totally.

574
00:38:07,998 --> 00:38:09,552
I think I'll take you up on that.

575
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:12,352
Please. You'll have 20 bubbleheads
lined up by tomorrow.

576
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:13,760
I don't know about that.

577
00:38:14,006 --> 00:38:15,830
They all have the same thing
working against them.

578
00:38:15,848 --> 00:38:17,380
What's that?

579
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:19,090
None of them are you.

580
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,461
Later, Trager.

581
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:32,733
Bye.

582
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:42,412
You're here.

583
00:38:43,557 --> 00:38:45,222
I thought you'd be in new york by now.

584
00:38:45,347 --> 00:38:46,411
Me, too.

585
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:48,182
My flight was already
delayed for hours,

586
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:50,101
and then this crazy blackout happened,

587
00:38:50,117 --> 00:38:51,492
and they cancelled it.

588
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:53,853
So I'm flying out tomorrow.

589
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:57,713
Which means I don't have to leave
without saying good-bye.

590
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:01,363
So it looks like the blackout
was pretty lucky, huh?

591
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:03,430
I guess you could say that.

592
00:39:09,795 --> 00:39:11,082
Amanda,

593
00:39:12,345 --> 00:39:14,120
I need to talk to you about Jessi.

594
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:18,112
Do you have feelings for her?

595
00:39:18,185 --> 00:39:19,322
No.

596
00:39:21,037 --> 00:39:22,431
That's all I need to know.

597
00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:25,520
I know how much you care about me.

598
00:39:27,486 --> 00:39:29,013
I see it all over your face.

599
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:32,300
Is it one of my "Amanda" looks?

600
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:34,113
You have "Amanda" looks?

601
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:36,110
Three or four of them, apparently.

602
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:40,962
The semester will be over
before you know it.

603
00:39:41,188 --> 00:39:42,491
Four months isn't that long.

604
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,243
172,880 minutes.

605
00:39:49,157 --> 00:39:50,440
I'll call.

606
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,651
And text.

607
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,221
And e-mail.

608
00:39:59,038 --> 00:40:00,362
I will, too.

609
00:40:02,575 --> 00:40:04,103
And I'll come back to you.

610
00:40:05,328 --> 00:40:06,660
You promise?

611
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:09,022
Promise.

612
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,862
Then I know it will happen.

613
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:44,903
I'm sorry, sir.
Visiting hours are over.

614
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:46,891
Only family members after hours.

615
00:40:46,908 --> 00:40:48,120
I'm her father.

616
00:40:51,427 --> 00:40:52,610
Hello, Jessi.

617
00:40:53,676 --> 00:40:54,920
How are you feeling?

618
00:40:55,096 --> 00:40:56,472
I heard what you said.

619
00:40:57,078 --> 00:40:58,492
How could you be my father?

620
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:02,663
It's time you learned the truth
about who you really are.

621
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:15,141
Um, that's...
that's not me.

622
00:41:15,845 --> 00:41:17,281
She looks like me.

623
00:41:17,357 --> 00:41:18,802
You know who she is.

624
00:41:20,376 --> 00:41:22,410
I'll tell you about her if you like.

625
00:41:24,945 --> 00:41:26,403
How do you know her?

626
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:30,932
I was there.

627
00:41:31,177 --> 00:41:32,863
I'm the one who took the picture.

628
00:41:34,488 --> 00:41:35,763
Her name was Sara.

629
00:41:38,827 --> 00:41:41,823
I don't think we've had a candlelit
dinner since before the kids were born.

630
00:41:41,885 --> 00:41:43,680
It's nice to get back to basics.

631
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:45,621
Can I help?

632
00:41:46,146 --> 00:41:48,133
Yeah. You can light the candles.

633
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:51,290
Lori, would you come help me
in the kitchen for a minute?

634
00:41:51,497 --> 00:41:52,723
So how are you feeling?

635
00:41:53,316 --> 00:41:54,550
Fine.

636
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:57,191
Hey, guys.

637
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:03,100
I know how hard it must have been
to keep my secret.

638
00:42:04,325 --> 00:42:05,582
Thank you.

639
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:06,550
Don't thank me.

640
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:08,443
I barely managed
to make it through one day.

641
00:42:10,176 --> 00:42:12,351
I guess we'll just have to take it
one day at a time, then.

642
00:42:24,905 --> 00:42:26,941
<i>When I was in the chair,
all I could think about</i>

643
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:29,060
<i>was losing my memories of the Tragers,</i>

644
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:33,773
<i>memories like the one
we were making right now.</i>

645
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:40,643
<i>I didn't know what lay ahead for me,</i>

646
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:43,900
<i>but I knew that I would never
have to face it alone.</i>

647
00:42:57,155 --> 00:43:23,152
