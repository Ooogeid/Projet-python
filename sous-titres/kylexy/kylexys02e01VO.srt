1
00:00:01,525 --> 00:00:03,418
Previously, on Kyle XY.

2
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:04,792
So let me understand.

3
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,853
The boy has no family that you know of.

4
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:09,668
He doesn't communicate, and he was
found wandering alone in the city.

5
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:11,904
But there is one more thing
we should see.

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,156
- No belly button.
- I have a new patient,

7
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:16,272
and I'm bringing him here
for a little while.

8
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:18,639
- You don't know him.
- Don't want he touches my things.

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,987
He's a very sweet, very special boy.

10
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,447
He's this super brain... with amnesia.

11
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:25,617
He can't understand the simplest things,

12
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:27,928
but does calculus like it's 2 plus 2.

13
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:29,810
He barely knows what
you're saying sometimes,

14
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,973
but somehow speaks Chinese?

15
00:00:32,053 --> 00:00:35,139
Mom, I'm telling you, Kyle is not human.

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,143
781227.

17
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:39,491
Spelling out your alien birthday?

18
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:40,782
It's you!

19
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:43,696
1985?

20
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,027
The guy in the photo.

21
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:46,109
It's Adam Baylin.

22
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:48,753
Adam Baylin has been
missing for 20 years.

23
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:50,634
You gotta stop asking questions!

24
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:52,923
If you don't, you're gonna put
your family in danger.

25
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:54,853
- Who are you?
- It's Mom.

26
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:56,759
The Peterson's live in Connecticut.

27
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,136
I'll be ready to go by tomorrow.

28
00:00:58,216 --> 00:00:59,679
Now that I know, I'm ready.

29
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,222
You're not telling me something.

30
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:03,616
You've proven you can keep my secrets.

31
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,503
If there was anything to tell,
don't you think I'd bring you in on it?

32
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,283
- Thanks for everything.
- Take care, kid.

33
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:14,576
I'll take care of 781227
and Adam Baylin.

34
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:17,245
In the meantime, 781228

35
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,261
is in excellent condition.

36
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:20,710
What did you tell him?

37
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,815
To go with the Petersons, it was the
only way to keep Tragers out of danger.

38
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:25,234
You two are very good liars.

39
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:27,115
It's our job.

40
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:31,663
I'm Adam Baylin.

41
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:34,167
- What do you want from me?
- What would you like to know?

42
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:35,547
Everything.

43
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:40,533
He's home.

44
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:41,751
Home?

45
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,829
With his parents.

46
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:46,202
It's okay. It's just another dream.

47
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,259
I have a...

48
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,735
bad feeling.

49
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,090
Kyle's okay.
There's nothing to worry about.

50
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,205
Come on.

Season 2 Episode 1
- The Prophet -

54
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:26,014
Every story has a beginning.

55
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:33,539
Every life has meaning and potential.

56
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:39,475
But I didn't know my story's beginning,

57
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:41,501
nor realize my true potential,

58
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:47,144
until a few month's ago
when I first met Adam Baylin.

59
00:03:50,894 --> 00:03:53,464
I've waited a long time
to meet you Kyle.

60
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:56,775
There's so much that I want to tell you.

61
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:59,206
There's so much that I want to know.

62
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,308
I'll answer all of your questions...

63
00:04:02,388 --> 00:04:04,506
at least the ones that I can.

64
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,177
I want you to feel at home here.
Are you hungry?

65
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:13,505
Would you like something
to drink after your trip?

66
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,496
Thanks.

67
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:25,081
Try again.

68
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:33,987
What's the trick?

69
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:37,547
There is none.

70
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:39,870
The magic is in your mind.

71
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,526
You only need to discover
and release it.

72
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,657
Teach me.

73
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:49,841
We'll have to start at the beginning.

74
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,706
Are you familiar with
Einstein's contributions?

75
00:04:52,786 --> 00:04:54,344
I've read about him.

76
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:55,795
He was a genius.

77
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:58,389
No question.

78
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:03,050
Why do we think Einstein's was capable
of such brilliance and innovation

79
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:04,637
when his peers must have worked

80
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:06,023
just as hard?

81
00:05:07,118 --> 00:05:08,384
He had a gift?

82
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,786
Or...

83
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:11,790
a head start?

84
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:16,081
The typical gestation period
for a human being is 40 weeks.

85
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:19,720
Einstein spent several weeks
longer in his mother's womb.

86
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,995
His brain had more time to develop.

87
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:23,642
That's why he was smarter?

88
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,273
Well, not just smarter.

89
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,241
Einstein believed it was why
he perceived the universe differently.

90
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,473
There've always been rumors
that Einstein conducted

91
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:34,273
a series of secret
experiments in the 1920s.

92
00:05:34,353 --> 00:05:37,872
Allegedly, he tested the idea
of extending natural pregnancy,

93
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,556
mostly on primates,

94
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,863
hoping the animals would
develop superior brains.

95
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:45,799
But when the experiments failed,
they say that Einstein

96
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,843
abandoned the project,

97
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:49,730
although

98
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,106
other scientists were still intrigued.

99
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:55,623
They resurrected the experiments
in the 1950s,

100
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:58,131
this time without Einstein

101
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:00,676
and under tighter secrecy.

102
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:04,844
They decided to implant human embryos
in surrogate human mothers.

103
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,607
Did it work?

104
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:13,918
After many failures, there was
one successful pregnancy.

105
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,034
A healthy 13-month gestation.

106
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:19,173
13 months?

107
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,907
Unfortunately, the surrogate mother
died when the child was born.

108
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:26,096
What happened to the child?

109
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:28,641
You're looking at him.

110
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:34,890
Okay, here's the deal.
Mom and Dad really need this trip,

111
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,484
so you can't do anything
to stress them out while they're away.

112
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,522
I'm planning a weekend
of quiet reflection.

113
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,408
Seriously. If you have your
loser friends over, don't be total pigs.

114
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:43,669
And keep them out of my room.

115
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:45,777
Don't want their little hands
in my underwears.

116
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:48,878
That was one time
in sixth grade. God, let it go.

117
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:52,454
Okay, I think we have everything.

118
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,557
We don't.

119
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,483
Well, Lori is in charge.

120
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:02,322
Not more than one friend
over at a time, and no one

121
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:03,475
spends the night.

122
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,826
If you're referring to Declan,

123
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:07,508
I don't think that's a concern.

124
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:09,278
Why? Is everything okay with you guys?

125
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:10,816
We're fine...

126
00:07:10,902 --> 00:07:11,947
I guess.

127
00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:14,541
It's hard to tell what
he's thinking nowadays.

128
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,319
Forget about things here.
Enjoy your weekend.

129
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:19,176
Yeah. Just go. Have fun.

130
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:21,524
It's not like you're counting
the minutes or anything.

131
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,889
I'm down to seconds.

132
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:25,627
All right. We'll call you later.

133
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:28,074
If you hear from Kyle,
make sure he knows I have my cell.

134
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:29,909
And give him the number of the hotel.

135
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:31,950
What?

136
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:33,794
Can we go?

137
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:45,191
Sweet freedom.

138
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:47,085
Give me half.

139
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:50,654
Sorry. Bank's closed.

140
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:56,491
You drew this symbol.

141
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:57,748
For Zzyzx.

142
00:07:58,486 --> 00:08:00,539
Zzyzx was my conception, Kyle.

143
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:04,939
My hope at the time was to create
children with more sophisticated brains,

144
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,111
children who could enlighten the world
and advance civilization.

145
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:10,408
So I continued the experiment.

146
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:12,474
Even if it meant harming
more surrogate mothers?

147
00:08:12,904 --> 00:08:13,986
I didn't.

148
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:18,659
I worked years on developing
an artificial womb.

149
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:24,696
Finally, I designed a chamber
that I believed could work,

150
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:27,241
and I invented a fluid

151
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:28,615
that would provide oxygen

152
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:30,493
and nourish the embryo placed inside.

153
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,550
So there was no need
for a natural mother...

154
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:36,191
and obviously,

155
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:37,503
no umbilical cord.

156
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:38,709
And as a result,

157
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,426
the child would not have a belly button.

158
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:45,583
You're saying I was gestated

159
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:47,554
inside one of those tanks at Zzyzx.

160
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:51,673
A carefully monitored chamber.

161
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:55,438
So you created me.

162
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:58,057
Yes.

163
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:07,143
My first memory
is waking up in the forest,

164
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:11,201
fully grown, covered in
that pink fluid you were talking about.

165
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,791
How long was I kept inside that chamber?

166
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,590
Your whole life.

167
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:32,213
All the fine ladies showed up

168
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:33,317
tonight.

169
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,628
Check it out!

170
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:40,180
Party of the year!

171
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,444
The party's over.

172
00:09:42,637 --> 00:09:43,777
Such a tragedy, Kyle.

173
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:45,867
Ever since you left,
the rowdy queen of rebellion

174
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:47,973
has become a total buzzkill.

175
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:51,550
I'm attempting thoughtful,
sober, and restrained

176
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:53,773
until Mom and Dad
get over you being gone.

177
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:56,551
Dude, you should be here.
It's, like, the whole school.

178
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,067
Hey, I was talking to Kyle.

179
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:00,784
- Actually, I should go.
- Wait. I want to hear how you are.

180
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:03,047
Sorry. We'll talk later.

181
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:06,920
He's always doing that.

182
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,169
You cut it too close.

183
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:16,891
I told you.

184
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:20,765
I'm responsible for the security here.

185
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,334
Two minutes, Kyle.

186
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:25,133
Two minutes...

187
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:27,356
or Zzyzx can trace the connection.

188
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:28,614
I've been careful.

189
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:33,629
You gotta stop pretending that you're
living with your parents in Connecticut.

190
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:35,547
Stop contact with the Tragers.

191
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,613
It's too dangerous.

192
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:39,715
It's an unnecessary complication.

193
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:41,486
It's necessary for me.

194
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:49,522
If you didn't like dinner,
you could have just said so.

195
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:51,200
What happened?

196
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,464
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

197
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,534
I just tripped over the table.

198
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:58,162
His IQ's off the charts.

199
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,501
His ability to avoid furniture,

200
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:02,047
well, gets him every time.

201
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,742
Kyle, this is Brian Taylor,
an old friend of mine.

202
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:06,058
Very old.

203
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:08,873
We grew up together.

204
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:10,029
Nice to meet you.

205
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:13,161
Me as well. I've heard...

206
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:14,615
a lot about you.

207
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:16,213
Really?

208
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,430
Yeah.

209
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,446
He tells me everything.

210
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,254
Almost everything.

211
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:24,693
All right, I'll check in on you later.

212
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:27,366
I'll be inside
if you need me, all right?

213
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:30,120
Kyle...

214
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:33,144
living here alone, I've...

215
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:35,148
relied on both of them over the years.

216
00:11:35,234 --> 00:11:38,237
Taylor's managed to turn
my dreams into reality.

217
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:41,360
He brings any useful ideas
I have to the outside world,

218
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:43,635
and it's Foss' job
to protect me from it.

219
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:45,085
From Zzyzx?

220
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,708
Yes.

221
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,609
I sent him there to work.
He's my eyes and ears.

222
00:11:52,314 --> 00:11:54,613
Why did Zzyzx order my termination?

223
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,256
I don't know. Years ago, I realized

224
00:11:58,336 --> 00:11:59,790
that some of my backers

225
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:02,150
had other plans for the experiment.

226
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:03,580
I protested.

227
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:05,351
They tried to kill me.

228
00:12:06,236 --> 00:12:08,756
- So I just disappeared.
- But you left me there.

229
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,617
Every time that I tried to remove
a subject from the chamber,

230
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:13,794
the subject died.

231
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:15,260
You mean the child died.

232
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,839
I'm sorry. It's just that...

233
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:21,347
I'm the subject.

234
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,884
I'm the child.

235
00:12:22,982 --> 00:12:25,708
The original purpose
of the experiment was noble

236
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,052
and good.

237
00:12:27,642 --> 00:12:30,337
It was supported by
a secret group of visionaries,

238
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,038
great humanitarians

239
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:34,030
known as Latnok.

240
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,173
Latnok?

241
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:36,907
It's Hungarian. It means...

242
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:38,049
The Prophet.

243
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:48,765
Ready to get started?

244
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:50,840
Change within,
change the world around me.

245
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,122
That's right.

246
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:54,983
Once you teach your mind
to alter the positive and negative

247
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:56,520
polarity of the cells in your body...

248
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,056
- The glass will move.
- Not the glass,

249
00:12:59,142 --> 00:13:00,777
the water inside it.

250
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:03,040
The glass is just a container.

251
00:13:03,594 --> 00:13:05,266
It's the content that matters.

252
00:13:07,073 --> 00:13:08,143
The content.

253
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:10,683
Take a shot.

254
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:22,122
I have no idea what I'm doing.

255
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:24,212
It took me 20 years to master this.

256
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:26,512
Give yourself at least 5 minutes.

257
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:31,227
Free your mind.

258
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:37,596
And concentrate.

259
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:50,310
All the evidence of the festivities
has been eliminated.

260
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:51,773
You actually made a list?

261
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,987
I'm taking no chances here.

262
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,274
Dumped the empty bottles
in our neighbors' bins,

263
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:58,475
glued the broken picture frame,

264
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:00,036
and got the stains out of the couch.

265
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:03,033
The only thing left is making sure
you don't narc on me.

266
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:05,385
I won't say anything.
They're still gonna know.

267
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:07,537
There's always one
little thing you overlook.

268
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:09,296
No way. I've got it all covered.

269
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:12,677
Except that.

270
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:14,841
Oh, crap!

271
00:14:15,726 --> 00:14:16,759
Nice save.

272
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:19,323
Hey, guys, we're home.

273
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,180
Hey. How was San Francisco?

274
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:23,319
Oh, we had a great time.
Just what we needed.

275
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,832
Yeah. How'd it go here?

276
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:26,184
Everything's cool.

277
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:28,458
No major damage?

278
00:14:28,544 --> 00:14:29,884
It was quite dull, actually.

279
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,194
- Did a lot of reading.
- Have you heard from Kyle?

280
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,441
- Just a quick chat on-line.
- How's he doing?

281
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:37,247
Who knows? He signs off
so fast all the time.

282
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:38,697
Well, he didn't call us.

283
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:39,878
I hope he's okay.

284
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:41,292
Maybe he sent an e-mail.

285
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:43,329
What's this?

286
00:14:45,088 --> 00:14:46,670
I had nothing to do with it.

287
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,493
Josh, start talking.

288
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:50,498
I had a few friends over.

289
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:54,125
Okay. How long am I grounded?

290
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:56,965
Why don't you go get
next year's calendar.

291
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,134
I don't know. What do you think?

292
00:15:00,388 --> 00:15:01,974
We just got home.

293
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:03,863
Let's deal with this later.

294
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,425
What are you doing?

295
00:15:51,855 --> 00:15:54,400
Trying to imagine what
it was like inside the chamber.

296
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:57,745
Must be why I like the tub.

297
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,003
You must have seen me
when you worked at Zzyzx.

298
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:05,884
Yeah, I saw you.

299
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,856
Did I know what was happening?
Was I aware?

300
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:11,023
You were in some kind of sleep state.

301
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:13,359
Did I look comfortable?

302
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:14,871
You seemed to be, yeah.

303
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,896
So I just stayed there
asleep the whole time?

304
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,936
Look, I... I don't know
what they were doing to you.

305
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,093
You saw me.

306
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:26,609
A person floating in a tank
year after year,

307
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:28,955
and you never bothered
to ask what was going on?

308
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:32,618
I did my job.

309
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:48,031
- Your parents are home.
- The door's closed.

310
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,810
Which is technically
against their rules.

311
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:54,154
If I don't break a few rules
soon, I'm gonna explode.

312
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,774
It's not easy being the good girl.

313
00:16:55,854 --> 00:16:58,408
Well, here's your chance to corrupt me.

314
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:07,687
What is it?

315
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:08,879
Nothing.

316
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,116
Come on. Where's the guy who used to
crawl through my bedroom window?

317
00:17:14,522 --> 00:17:16,698
I guess I'm... just distracted.

318
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,255
Yeah... ever since Kyle left,
just like my mom.

319
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,723
Comparing me to your mom.
That's not good.

320
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:28,760
Well, we all miss him, but you can't
sit around and brood all the time.

321
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:31,199
It's just... it was
pretty wild how he left.

322
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:33,400
I know. So fast.

323
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,145
No time for closure.

324
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:38,133
Hey, he should come visit, right?

325
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:39,915
Good luck with that.

326
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:42,424
Why are you being so negative?

327
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,702
Kyle's gone.

328
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:45,866
He's not coming back.

329
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,870
Can't hurt to ask.

330
00:17:50,661 --> 00:17:52,050
Hey, Kyle. How are you?

331
00:17:52,382 --> 00:17:54,423
I'm fine. How's it going with you?

332
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:55,895
No, not this time.

333
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,089
Tell me what's happening with you.
How are things in Connecticut?

334
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:00,640
It's all good.

335
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,113
Are you going out?

336
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:03,687
A little bit.

337
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:05,980
- Meeting people?
- A few.

338
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,420
Getting along with your parents?

339
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:10,442
Things are going well.

340
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:13,381
- Well, things here kind of suck.
- Why? What's wrong?

341
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,558
We're all basically craving
some Kyle-time.

342
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:16,898
So here's the plan.

343
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:19,979
Use our frequent-flyer miles
and catch a flight to Seattle.

344
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:21,860
You want me to come to Seattle?

345
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:24,454
It'd be so great if you
could surprise everyone.

346
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,678
- Well...
- My mom would flip out, in a good way.

347
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:28,868
Will you come?

348
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:36,223
I take that as a "no. "

349
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,858
I just stumbled.

350
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:44,832
No.

351
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:46,520
Something's wrong. Tell me.

352
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:54,200
The two of us share a gift, Kyle.

353
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,478
Our minds can enable our bodies to do

354
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:58,577
extraordinary things, like...

355
00:18:58,657 --> 00:19:00,572
Swim faster. Jump off a roof.

356
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:02,540
You jumped off a roof?

357
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:04,458
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to.

358
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:08,760
Foss told me you had a seizure.

359
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,711
I was trying to hear
a distant conversation.

360
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:13,431
Well...

361
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:16,395
you put too much strain on your mind.

362
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:18,912
I've spent years challenging myself,

363
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,054
testing what I could do...

364
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:22,690
at a great cost.

365
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:25,469
My mind is stronger than ever,

366
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,571
by my body is failing me.

367
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:28,813
Failing you?

368
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:33,387
Your mind's potential is...

369
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,973
far greater than mine,

370
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,519
and so is the toll
it can take on your body.

371
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:39,695
You have to condition yourself

372
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,230
or you're gonna die too young...

373
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,409
...before you've even
had a chance to live, Kyle.

374
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:51,699
The timer.

375
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:03,168
It's hard,

376
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:04,363
you know?

377
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:05,962
You feel like...

378
00:20:06,048 --> 00:20:08,630
everyone looks to you for support so...

379
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:10,552
You try to be strong,

380
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:12,433
as usual. You try to...

381
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:13,831
go on and...

382
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:16,908
smile like everything's
back to normal, but...

383
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:19,515
inside, you know it's not.

384
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:24,307
It's like you've made
this strange and...

385
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:26,708
powerful connection with someone,

386
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:29,240
and then suddenly, he's gone.

387
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,416
And you can't just...

388
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:33,174
get on with your life.

389
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:36,598
Not when you feel this void...

390
00:20:37,618 --> 00:20:40,151
and this terrible sense
that something is wrong.

391
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,415
It just...

392
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:48,048
I really miss him.

393
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,100
You know, I...

394
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:55,273
I feel like I've lost
one of my own children.

395
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,813
You just let me know if
anything else comes up.

396
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:03,641
I will. Just keep me
in the loop on things.

397
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,215
Sorry.

398
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,215
Kyle. It's okay. Come on in.

399
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:13,354
Are you turning Adam's
latest dream into reality?

400
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,469
Something like that.

401
00:21:16,747 --> 00:21:18,604
I heard he tripped again
the other night.

402
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:20,264
Must have scared you.

403
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:21,592
It did.

404
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:24,826
How about that, huh, Adam?

405
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:27,710
Someone else cares about you besides me.

406
00:21:32,122 --> 00:21:33,167
Well...

407
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,184
I feel like I'm seeing double.

408
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,405
- Talk with you later.
- All right.

409
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,766
I hope I didn't alarm you.

410
00:21:41,995 --> 00:21:43,704
I'm still worried about the timer.

411
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,954
Let me worry about that.

412
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:48,336
We should tell Foss.

413
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:50,500
No, we can't. He's too cautious.

414
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:52,516
He'll want us to leave here,

415
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,840
and there's still so much to do.

416
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,763
I want you to remember this moment.

417
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:00,508
After I'm gone,

418
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,223
all of my experiences,

419
00:22:03,582 --> 00:22:05,205
everything I've studied and learned

420
00:22:05,414 --> 00:22:07,025
will be yours.

421
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:11,635
Your mind is a powerful tool.

422
00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:15,372
Develop it,

423
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:16,799
protect it.

424
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:19,848
Use it wisely.

425
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:25,377
But more important than your mind,

426
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,156
it's your soul that touches people.

427
00:22:29,275 --> 00:22:30,922
You can touch the world, Kyle.

428
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:33,070
It's who you are.

429
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,894
It's who you're meant to be.

430
00:22:39,614 --> 00:22:41,537
How about Shanghai Garden?

431
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:45,376
- If I see another lettuce wrap...
- Well, I can't live on pizza.

432
00:22:45,484 --> 00:22:46,765
Hey, guys.

433
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:49,504
Dad, you and me :
mushroom, garlic, pepperoni.

434
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,257
I had that for breakfast.

435
00:22:51,343 --> 00:22:53,187
Compromise: We go for sushi.

436
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:54,651
An invitation to hell.

437
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,011
Here's an idea:

438
00:22:57,146 --> 00:22:59,101
Mom could actually make something.

439
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:01,894
What? She has time now.
She stopped working.

440
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,691
Look, I know your mom
hasn't been as focused lately.

441
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:05,837
Focused?

442
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,604
I throw this awesome rager
while you're out of town,

443
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:10,706
and she still hasn't
said a word about it.

444
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:12,821
Swift, Josh. Remind them to punish you.

445
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:16,153
And we will, believe me.
We just have to discuss how.

446
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:18,094
Make me sweat it out, huh?

447
00:23:18,193 --> 00:23:19,736
Well, it's not working.

448
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,574
It's totally working.

449
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:25,373
Anyway, Mom's been in such a funk
since Kyle left, I asked him to visit.

450
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,083
- Kyle's coming?
- I don't know. I mean

451
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,640
I invited him but
he basically cut me off.

452
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:31,927
I haven't heard from him since.

453
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,644
It's gotta be tough he's trying to
connect with his real parents

454
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:36,295
while staying in touch with us.

455
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,397
So, what, we can't talk to him?

456
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:40,979
Well, I just think...

457
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:42,996
if we're all gonna move on

458
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,369
we have to let each other go.

459
00:24:13,062 --> 00:24:15,791
- Ready to try again?
- I can't do this.

460
00:24:17,352 --> 00:24:18,569
Well, I told you.

461
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:19,823
It takes time.

462
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:21,311
No. I don't want this.

463
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,524
I didn't ask to come here.

464
00:24:23,621 --> 00:24:25,539
I had people who I loved,

465
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:26,978
who loved me.

466
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:29,425
I had a life.

467
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,229
You'll have an extraordinary life.

468
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:33,147
I don't want to hear about Latnok

469
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:35,523
or their experiments or how
I was locked in a tank.

470
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,191
I'm a human being.

471
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:42,052
How could you put me in there?

472
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:46,447
Why did you create
me in the first place?

473
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:55,196
I had no one.

474
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:58,087
No real family.

475
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:01,282
No one whose mind worked like mine,

476
00:25:01,552 --> 00:25:04,060
who could experience
the world the way that I did.

477
00:25:05,077 --> 00:25:06,762
I always felt different.

478
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:10,266
And I thought if there
were another person...

479
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:13,561
You didn't want to be alone.

480
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:17,803
I hope in time you can forgive me, Kyle.

481
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:10,461
What is it?

482
00:26:15,302 --> 00:26:16,645
He's been shot!

483
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,391
Get inside.

484
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:21,044
- Now!
- I won't leave him!

485
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,470
I'm here.

486
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,056
Please.

487
00:26:30,182 --> 00:26:32,966
There's still so much
you have to teach me.

488
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:20,223
The briefest connection can make the
strongest, most indelible impression.

489
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,445
Adam encouraged and inspired me

490
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:25,386
and helped me unravel
the mystery of my past

491
00:27:27,587 --> 00:27:28,972
But without him,

492
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:32,690
my future seemed more uncertain
and dangerous than ever.

493
00:27:34,706 --> 00:27:36,012
Zzyzx will kill him.

494
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:38,222
They had the opportunity,
and they didn't.

495
00:27:38,314 --> 00:27:39,771
- They'll be back.
- Then we have to

496
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:42,445
- get him out of here.
- And then what?

497
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,335
And then Kyle runs
for the rest of his life?

498
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:47,607
You build him a prison
to hide like you did for Baylin

499
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:51,045
- Well, you tell me the alternative
- I worked security at Zzyzx for years

500
00:27:51,132 --> 00:27:53,090
I know every in and out.

501
00:27:53,732 --> 00:27:55,082
I'll go tonight

502
00:27:55,432 --> 00:27:57,674
- and eliminate the threat.
- You will do no such thing.

503
00:27:57,754 --> 00:27:59,494
What are you talking about?

504
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,531
"Eliminate the threat?"
What does that mean?

505
00:28:03,785 --> 00:28:05,211
Zzyzx killed Baylin

506
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,400
because he knew too much about them.

507
00:28:07,498 --> 00:28:09,195
You know too much, too.

508
00:28:09,415 --> 00:28:10,335
No!

509
00:28:10,415 --> 00:28:12,559
I have an obligation to protect you.

510
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:14,772
- Not by eliminating anyone.
- They'll come after you

511
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,199
- I won't let them find me.
- They'll target the Tragers

512
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,256
to draw you out. Do you wanna be safe?

513
00:28:19,356 --> 00:28:21,918
Do ya? Do you want them safe?
Then I need to do this.

514
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:23,524
You'll do nothing.

515
00:28:24,397 --> 00:28:25,823
You'll harm no one.

516
00:28:49,134 --> 00:28:51,027
Have you heard from Kyle?

517
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,339
Not lately.

518
00:28:53,511 --> 00:28:56,807
Would you know if he's traveling
somewhere with the Petersons?

519
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,711
He never said anything.

520
00:28:58,949 --> 00:29:01,097
Well, the last time
you talked to him, did he

521
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:02,311
seem all right?

522
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,922
What did he say?

523
00:29:08,324 --> 00:29:10,304
You know Kyle. He's a man of few words.

524
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,926
Do you realize that was the longest
conversation we've had in weeks?

525
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:25,894
And what a surprise.
It was all about Kyle.

526
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:28,967
- Josh, I'm worried about him.
- You're worried about him?

527
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:30,529
Right.

528
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:32,471
I threw a party while you weren't home.

529
00:29:32,557 --> 00:29:35,508
There was unsupervised minors
messing around in our house.

530
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:37,471
There was underage drinking and...

531
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:39,396
inappropriate behavior and...

532
00:29:39,797 --> 00:29:42,404
probably a few illegal
substances I didn't know about.

533
00:29:44,174 --> 00:29:45,566
And you busted me for it.

534
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:46,965
You actually found out.

535
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:51,255
And then you did nothing.

536
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:52,325
Nothing.

537
00:29:54,182 --> 00:29:55,567
By why should you?

538
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,288
I only live here. I'm only your son.

539
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:05,505
Feels strange not having him here.

540
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:07,718
Yeah, it does.

541
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:12,340
It seems Adam planned for everything.

542
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,833
He was always ten steps ahead,

543
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:17,080
preparing for every contingency.

544
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:18,549
You mean he expected...

545
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,295
To be killed?

546
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:23,061
He had to live with that possibility,

547
00:30:23,578 --> 00:30:24,659
that fear.

548
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,314
As will you now.

549
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:32,110
I'll manage, like he did.

550
00:30:32,983 --> 00:30:35,255
You have to disappear for a while.

551
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:39,462
We have to keep you as
far away from Zzyzx as we can.

552
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:42,044
Foss thinks they'll find me.

553
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:45,314
You let me worry about Foss.

554
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:51,572
Where is he?

555
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:19,831
I never thought I'd hear
Josh begging to be punished.

556
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:22,315
It was more than that, and you know it.

557
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,159
Look, I'm concerned about Kyle.

558
00:31:24,245 --> 00:31:27,634
That doesn't mean I'm not attentive to
Josh or anyone else in this family.

559
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:28,802
Who are you kidding?

560
00:31:29,343 --> 00:31:32,616
Do you think you're fooling anybody
and you're not concerned about Kyle.

561
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:35,295
You're being completely
stressed out and obsessed.

562
00:31:35,454 --> 00:31:38,790
Steven, I can't help feeling
that something is wrong.

563
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:40,139
Well, get over it.

564
00:31:40,237 --> 00:31:42,057
He's not ours to worry about anymore.

565
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:57,586
I know how much you miss him.

566
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,489
I know

567
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:02,601
that you can't stop caring
about him. We all do.

568
00:32:04,694 --> 00:32:06,932
But Kyle is not here, we are.

569
00:32:08,088 --> 00:32:10,842
We just need to feel
that you're here with us.

570
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,543
The heart rate is stable.

571
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:48,949
We'll move on to the next phase
as soon as possible.

572
00:35:12,324 --> 00:35:13,833
- What did you do?
- Get in.

573
00:35:13,932 --> 00:35:15,776
- They're innocent.
- They're not innocent!

574
00:35:15,874 --> 00:35:17,426
They killed Baylin! They'll kill you!

575
00:35:17,526 --> 00:35:18,574
No!

576
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,342
I did what needed to be done.

577
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:19,510
And you feel nothing now?

578
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:22,143
- People died.
- I know that.

579
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:24,914
- We're responsible.
- No.

580
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,032
No.

581
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:27,988
I'm responsible.

582
00:36:28,873 --> 00:36:31,652
Those people,
they ordered you terminated.

583
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:34,531
They saw you as inhuman,

584
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,117
as...

585
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:37,470
expendable.

586
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,400
The waste product
of a failed experiment.

587
00:36:46,212 --> 00:36:47,245
It's...

588
00:36:47,515 --> 00:36:50,183
Keep learning what
Adam had to teach you.

589
00:36:52,236 --> 00:36:53,711
Get stronger. Condition your mind

590
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,420
and body like he said.

591
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:05,425
He kept everything
organized, but there's just...

592
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:07,909
there's so much of it.

593
00:37:08,388 --> 00:37:10,754
I just don't know where we should start.

594
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:13,594
We?

595
00:37:16,323 --> 00:37:17,455
I'm gonna stay here

596
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:20,295
and read his notes
and see if I can help.

597
00:37:22,336 --> 00:37:23,750
Why would you do that?

598
00:37:28,385 --> 00:37:31,286
You think I'm just gonna
walk away from you now?

599
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:38,186
Sometimes

600
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:41,712
the connections you make
with other people sneak up on you.

601
00:37:41,798 --> 00:37:43,545
You share experiences.

602
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:45,121
You have a history.

603
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:46,200
You form a bond.

604
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:51,266
I should take a picture.

605
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,893
You better do it fast. It's not gonna
last long. The natives are hungry.

606
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:56,366
Dinner's my choice tonight.

607
00:37:56,446 --> 00:37:57,982
I think not.

608
00:37:58,253 --> 00:38:01,031
Excuse me? I can still taste
that chili you ordered yesterday.

609
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:03,933
- Good. So you've already eaten.
- Let's not order in.

610
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:05,973
- I'm with you. Let's go out.
- No, actually,

611
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:07,504
I'd like to cook tonight.

612
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:13,528
What, is that such a scary thought?

613
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:16,538
No, no. That sounds great.

614
00:38:16,618 --> 00:38:17,649
Absolutely.

615
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:24,239
And one more thing.

616
00:38:25,788 --> 00:38:26,993
No phone,

617
00:38:27,215 --> 00:38:30,092
no Internet, no video games for a week.

618
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,536
Plus,

619
00:38:31,683 --> 00:38:33,048
you're getting a job.

620
00:38:33,368 --> 00:38:35,679
You need to take on
some real responsibility.

621
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:37,202
Harsh.

622
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:55,929
It wasn't your fault.

623
00:38:57,945 --> 00:39:01,031
Adam knew you couldn't
protect him every minute.

624
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:02,925
I hope you know that.

625
00:39:06,564 --> 00:39:07,990
We should get started. You've

626
00:39:08,076 --> 00:39:09,121
a lot to learn.

627
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:13,806
I won't be able to, not in this house.

628
00:39:13,904 --> 00:39:16,535
Kyle, you can't go back to the Tragers.

629
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,422
If I stay here, safe but shut in,

630
00:39:18,594 --> 00:39:21,483
I might as well have stayed
inside that tank.

631
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:23,619
I won't be able to touch
the world like Adam said

632
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:26,103
if I'm not part of it.
- You don't know what you're asking.

633
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:28,848
I know I can't tell them about
the experiment or the people who died

634
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:31,466
without making them accomplices.

635
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:33,519
I know I'll have to keep
my past a secret.

636
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,203
You'll be lying to them, every day.

637
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,335
No.

638
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:40,367
I lied so that I could leave.

639
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,638
And now I'll lie so that I can return.

640
00:39:45,187 --> 00:39:46,391
But beyond that,

641
00:39:47,794 --> 00:39:50,314
I'll do everything in my power
to live by the truth.

642
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:53,167
Why do you wanna go back there
and complicate your life?

643
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:57,212
It's not complicated. It's simple.

644
00:39:59,205 --> 00:40:00,410
I love them.

645
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,347
Taylor will provide all the details.

646
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,078
I understand.

647
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:24,203
Well, you got what you wanted.
I expect you to honor our agreement.

648
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:27,066
I will.

649
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:31,025
It took a lot to get you here.

650
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,436
I won't let you waste your potential.

651
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:42,325
Thank you

652
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:44,452
for doing this,

653
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,550
for everything you've had to do.

654
00:40:50,452 --> 00:40:51,644
Be worth it.

655
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:08,624
You made our favorites.

656
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,698
Well, I'm making up
for a lot of missed meals.

657
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:13,628
Welcome back.

658
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:17,388
Is it ready yet?

659
00:41:17,468 --> 00:41:18,694
Almost!

660
00:41:20,957 --> 00:41:24,151
- It smells so good!
- I know. I'm dying here.

661
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,704
Dinner is served.

662
00:41:34,151 --> 00:41:35,594
Oh, my God.

663
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:18,937
In that moment,

664
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:21,580
all the things I'd learned about myself

665
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:23,757
all the gifts I need to develop

666
00:42:23,843 --> 00:42:26,142
and all the secrets I promised to hide

667
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:27,408
didn't matter.

668
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,502
All that mattered was being
home with my family,

669
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:36,838
feeling that connection again...

670
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:43,537
and knowing that I wasn't alone.
