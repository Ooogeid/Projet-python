1
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:02,436
Prevously on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,848
I have a lot of answers and
I'm ready to tell you everything.

3
00:00:05,162 --> 00:00:07,402
All we have to do
is protect the secret.

4
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:10,761
Everything Kyle told us, outside
of the family, we can't talk about.

5
00:00:10,816 --> 00:00:14,385
Fine, if you wanna be the guy who keeps
secrets from the girl who has cancer...

6
00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:16,574
I hated lying to you,
pretending that I didn't care...

7
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:17,521
I forgive you.

8
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:19,127
That ring that
you wear around your neck,

9
00:00:19,158 --> 00:00:20,512
<i>the box you found at Baylin's,

10
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:22,530
<i>it all originated from Latnok.

11
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:25,838
They have Baylin's best interests,
and mine... and yours.

12
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:27,452
I make things happen.

13
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:29,211
<i>I made lights explode.

14
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:30,862
I shattered a skylight.

15
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:32,152
<i>You did?

16
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,193
How did we do that?

17
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:34,490
What's the trick?

18
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,342
Once you teach your mind to alter

19
00:00:36,357 --> 00:00:38,921
the positive and negative
polarity of the cells in your body...

20
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:40,540
- The glass will move.
- Not the glass.

21
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:42,492
The water inside it.

22
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:43,960
She looks happy.

23
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:45,880
That's not me.

24
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:47,892
I think it could be you someday.

25
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:49,731
How could you be my father?

26
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:53,052
It's time you learned the truth
about who you really are.

27
00:00:53,158 --> 00:00:55,422
Kyle's very special,
but you already know that.

28
00:00:55,838 --> 00:01:00,950
All he's ever wanted
was to be a part of your family.

29
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,552
To Kyle, this is home.

30
00:01:13,177 --> 00:01:14,651
<i>A new day.

31
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:16,612
<i>The future full of promise.

32
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:19,552
<i>Now that my family
knew all of my secrets,

33
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:21,863
<i>I felt free,

34
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:24,513
<i>like I could do anything.

35
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:28,833
<i>Even while facing the future,

36
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:32,452
<i>I knew there were some lessons
from the past worth remembering.

37
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:50,610
<i>As Adam taught me,

38
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:54,252
<i>I was able to manipulate
the polarity of the cells in my body,

39
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:57,041
<i>using my own water content
against the water on the ground,

40
00:01:57,537 --> 00:01:59,862
<i>like two magnets fighting
to come together.

41
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:07,080
Kyle?

42
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,441
Beautiful day.

43
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:16,562
I spoke to Amanda yesterday.

44
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:18,182
She's doing great.

45
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:21,043
Yes. Yes, she is.

46
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:23,273
Have a nice day.

47
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:33,990
Mrs. Bloom thinks I can levitate.

48
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:37,103
- Can you?
- Not exactly.

49
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:39,073
I was trying to do something
Adam taught me,

50
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:40,173
and I think she saw.

51
00:02:40,187 --> 00:02:42,572
You have to be careful,
even in our backyard.

52
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:44,211
Especially with a neighbor
like Carol Bloom.

53
00:02:44,226 --> 00:02:46,373
We have bigger problems
than Mrs. Bloom.

54
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:48,652
Jessi starts back at school today.

55
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,893
Well, just take the high road.

56
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:51,871
Do your best to avoid her.

57
00:02:51,886 --> 00:02:54,251
Have you spoken to her
since she moved in with Taylor?

58
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:57,043
No. I still don't believe
he's her father.

59
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:58,803
She doesn't have a real father.

60
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:00,630
She's another pod child like you.

61
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:02,542
Genetically, she does match Taylor.

62
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,683
Yeah, but there are ways
to fix paternity tests.

63
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:06,580
We know that from the Petersons.

64
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:08,091
Well, until we can prove otherwise,

65
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,882
I'm afraid we can't take any action.

66
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:12,262
Is it really any of our business?

67
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,792
Well, I want to be sure
she's in the right situation.

68
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:17,633
And living with Brian Taylor isn't.

69
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:20,332
He lied when he brought
Kyle back to us.

70
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:22,481
He was involved
with Ballantine at Madacorp.

71
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:24,152
I know you're concerned about Jessi,

72
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,781
and if she needs our help,
we're here.

73
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:28,400
But this family needs
to focus on what's ahead.

74
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:30,842
Agreed?

75
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:33,320
Agreed.

76
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:41,612
So what the hell are we supposed
to talk about?

77

2x14 - To C.I.R. With Love</b>

80
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:12,053
Career days?

81
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:14,041
Second best thing to summer break.

82
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:15,242
Why?

83
00:04:15,257 --> 00:04:17,013
Half days of school, dude.

84
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:19,043
Free ride on the party express.

85
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:20,741
We're supposed to be browsing
the career booths

86
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:22,452
contemplating our futures.

87
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:23,980
What's to contemplate?

88
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,602
Self-made millionaire.

89
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:27,253
Homeless street musician.

90
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,203
Global superhero.

91
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:31,341
Let's waste some time!

92
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:34,300
He's right. These things
are a waste of space.

93
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:37,151
Why does Madacorp
have a booth here?

94
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:39,152
Don't worry.
They do every year.

95
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:42,820
What the hell is Hillary doing?

96
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:45,851
Coming at you from
Beachwood's annual career fair,

97
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:48,872
I'm Hillary, and I'm fabulous.

98
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,740
Hello, fabulous friends!

99
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,253
I thought that TV reality show
rejected you already.

100
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:56,173
Oh, reality TV is so five minutes ago.

101
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:57,823
I'm on a new path.

102
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:01,400
Sexy high school correspondent.

103
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,933
I'm gonna be the "queen of fabulous."

104
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,163
Do they have a booth for that?

105
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:08,440
When did he get funny?

106
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:09,652
Think about it.

107
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:12,040
Paris, Nicole, the "lonely15" chickie.

108
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:14,403
They're all famous because
they're hot and visible.

109
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,822
It's not that hard.

110
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:19,282
That is both valid and delusional
all at the the same time.

111
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:21,500
A few video blogs
in the school's web site,

112
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:24,511
and I'll be on my way
to world-wide notoriety.

113
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:28,343
Did you hear that?
It's "party thirty."

114
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:31,031
Preston hid a few of his treats
inside his gym locker.

115
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,051
Now that is fabulous.

116
00:05:33,428 --> 00:05:35,102
- Kyle, are you coming?
- Oh, no.

117
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:37,221
Remember the puker
from Declan's party?

118
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:38,483
This guy.

119
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:40,882
Eww! Then none for you,
little cupcake.

120
00:05:40,897 --> 00:05:42,020
Bye!

121
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:47,053
<i>Lori was right.

122
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:48,762
<i>I could do whatever I wanted.

123
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:52,731
<i>Engineering. Architecture.

124
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:54,493
<i>Medicine.

125
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:57,810
<i>I had spent my life figuring out
who I was,

126
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:01,393
<i>and now was my chance
to figure out who I could become.

127
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:17,251
So what's a hottie like you
doing in a place like this?

128
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:20,342
Is that what counts
for a pick-up line on your planet?

129
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:21,910
Only for girls with pink hair.

130
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:24,861
I shudder to think
what the redheads get.

131
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:27,333
What do you think?

132
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,153
I think you should wait to see
if you actually lose your hair

133
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:31,863
before you start wearing a wig.

134
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:35,011
Meanwhile, let's bust out of here.

135
00:06:36,737 --> 00:06:37,863
And?

136
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,130
Lock ourselves in the bathroom

137
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:40,350
and play G-force.

138
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:41,550
Nah.

139
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:43,810
When have you ever turned down

140
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:45,393
an opportunity to kick my ass?

141
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,003
I wanna take a look around.

142
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,040
You mean, like, job search?

143
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:52,810
Why so skeptical?

144
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:55,358
It would be just my luck
to blow off the career fair,

145
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:56,852
get cured of cancer,

146
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,871
and be totally unprepared
for my future.

147
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:00,090
Okay.

148
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:01,910
Is there something wrong
with me believing

149
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:03,991
I'll live to see
my first crappy adult job?

150
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,483
- Nope.
- You hate the wig, don't you?

151
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:08,220
- Hate it.
- And you think I'm ugly.

152
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:08,981
You're ugly, and you're disease-ridden.

153
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,272
I never want to touch you again.

154
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:12,210
You're totally getting the hang of me.

155
00:07:12,617 --> 00:07:14,171
It's our thing, remember?

156
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:20,603
Mr. Trager, leaving so soon?

157
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:22,843
I was just going to the bathroom.

158
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:24,063
Of course you were.

159
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:28,253
Why am I not surprised that
this fair holds no interest for you?

160
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:33,281
Stephen! wait!

161
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:35,742
I didn't expect to see you here.

162
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:37,033
Just grabbing a few of my things.

163
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:38,443
Could you just give me a minute?

164
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:46,260
I know what happened
with Ballantine was horrible,

165
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:48,492
but his agenda was his own,
not Madacorp's.

166
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:49,913
And you were just following orders.

167
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,563
The point is he's gone,

168
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:53,463
and I'm the one giving orders now.

169
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:55,432
Congratulations.

170
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:59,200
Can we just put our personal
differences aside

171
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:00,481
and remember that Madacorp is,

172
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:03,640
and always has been,
a great company.

173
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,611
We're making huge strides.

174
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:07,252
State-of-the-art in every department.

175
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:10,702
And I want you to stay
and continue to contribute.

176
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:13,510
I'll give you greater creative freedom,

177
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,921
increase your support team
and your salary.

178
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:21,270
You'll do very well at this job.

179
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:27,993
What we offer here you
won't find anywhere else.

180
00:08:28,536 --> 00:08:30,070
I'm counting on that.

181
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:44,081
Are you interested in architecture?

182
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:50,533
This structure won't support 40 units.

183
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,130
Try to move the foundation beams
to the center

184
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:54,962
to offset the weight distribution.

185
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:01,061
How the hell did you see that?

186
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,252
I read a lot.

187
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:15,163
- Hey.
- Glad to be back?

188
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:16,610
Sort of.

189
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:19,700
How are things going with Taylor?

190
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:22,340
I know you don't trust him,

191
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:23,800
but he's taking good care of me.

192
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:26,593
He told me all about
the girl in the picture, Sara.

193
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:29,370
She was part of the original
experiment, just like Adam.

194
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:31,873
Adam said he was the only one.

195
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:33,733
Not according to Brian.

196
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:38,583
He said he created me from
Sara's genetic material after she died

197
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:40,601
based on Adam's experiments.

198
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:43,181
Why didn't he mention her?

199
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,101
I don't know.

200
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:47,353
Maybe you can ask him someday.

201
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:53,811
You didn't mention anything to Taylor
about Adam being alive, did you?

202
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:56,453
No. You told me not to.

203
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:58,850
- I know, but...
- I'm different now.

204
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,402
You made me different.

205
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,763
If I make you a promise,
I'm going to keep it.

206
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:05,710
Okay.

207
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:09,803
Are you as bored as I am?

208
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:12,113
No.

209
00:10:13,098 --> 00:10:15,653
Actually, there's a neurology booth
that looked really interesting.

210
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:17,960
- Kyle.
- What?

211
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:19,831
I don't wanna spend the entire day

212
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,920
thinking about what I'm gonna do
20 years from now.

213
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,431
Well, what do you want to do?

214
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:27,493
Just get out of here for a bit.

215
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:29,123
Wanna come with?

216
00:10:33,035 --> 00:10:34,272
Come on.

217
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:01,750
My first day back,
and I'm already suffocating.

218
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:05,460
You didn't exactly get a right start
the first time around.

219
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:07,330
But it's a new beginning.

220
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:08,933
I think you'll learn to like it here.

221
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:11,900
Well, everything we need to know,
we can learn on our own.

222
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,273
Not everything.

223
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:16,693
They definitely can't teach us
to do the special things we can do.

224
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,602
Have you busted any skylights lately?

225
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:22,172
Haven't felt the urge.

226
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:23,720
Exploded any lights?

227
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:25,441
Been there, done that.

228
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:30,273
There's so much more we can try.

229
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,393
I mean, don't you ever feel
like just busting out

230
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:35,543
and doing something amazing
ever now and then?

231
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:37,950
I kind of did this morning.

232
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:39,842
What'd you do?

233
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:41,800
I sort of levitated.

234
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:44,240
- Really?
- Only slightly.

235
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:45,752
I don't care. Show me how.

236
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:48,200
I will. But we can't start with that.

237
00:11:48,218 --> 00:11:49,532
You have to work your way up to it.

238
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:51,070
No, I don't wanna work on anything.

239
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,242
I just wanna do something now.

240
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,600
There's not much we can do up here.

241
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:02,433
We should get back.

242
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,910
What, to the fascinating career fair?

243
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,191
You never know.

244
00:12:07,538 --> 00:12:09,280
Something might inspire you.

245
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:14,503
Fine.

246
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:47,973
Amanda, hi, it's me.

247
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:49,680
Sorry I missed you,

248
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:52,632
but I've been thinking about you,
and I wanted to call...

249
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:53,782
<i>Uh...

250
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:56,122
I'll call you later.

251
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:05,250
- Fabulousness confirmed.
- Excuse me?

252
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:08,200
Hello! My newest video blog
is on the school's web site,

253
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:11,062
and it already has over 500 hits.

254
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:13,900
Wow. That's a big jump from
the six who saw your last one.

255
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,990
I know, right?

256
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:17,783
At this rate,
I'll be youtubed by dinner.

257
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:20,582
Shoo shoo!
Let the star see her work.

258
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:26,191
<i>Until next time,
I'm Hillary, and I'm fabulous.

259
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,811
Who is that ruining my shot?

260
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,280
Please tell me you're not joining
the wrestling team.

261
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,963
You don't exactly have the body
to fill out those little outfits.

262
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:54,151
It's a punishment for
blowing off the career fair,

263
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:56,143
courtesy of our friendly
neighborhood principal.

264
00:13:56,157 --> 00:13:58,673
Why do you continually
do this to yourself?

265
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:01,473
Cause it's the one thing
I'm really good at?

266
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,090
- Josh.
- What?

267
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,372
Hooper's right. I am lazy.

268
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,630
My work ethic does suck,

269
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,942
and I really don't care about school.

270
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:12,811
Don't expect me to ride shotgun
on your "woe is me" interstate.

271
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:14,530
You're smart, and you know it.

272
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:17,561
So get off your ass and
start making something of yourself.

273
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:21,083
I could always follow
in Hillary's footsteps

274
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:22,512
and film myself
in a low-cut halter top.

275
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:25,143
She's got a little more
than her d-cup working for her.

276
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,662
She's got "the mystery jumper."

277
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:28,211
The who?

278
00:14:28,228 --> 00:14:29,092
Some video trick.

279
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:30,992
It looks like someone's
jumping off the roof.

280
00:14:32,057 --> 00:14:33,720
What makes you so sure it's a trick?

281
00:14:33,768 --> 00:14:36,630
Do you know anyone who
can actually jump off a roof?

282
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:45,282
Hard to believe I'm being responsible,

283
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:47,110
but how are we supposed
to keep your secret

284
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:49,761
if she's out there leaping
tall buildings in a single whatever.

285
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:52,020
I know it wasn't a smart thing to do,

286
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:54,161
but I don't think
anyone could tell it was her.

287
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:55,550
I ran a hyper-zoom processor on it,

288
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:58,410
and I couldn't make out a face,
just a female form.

289
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,840
Just how I like it.

290
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:03,481
What?

291
00:15:04,046 --> 00:15:05,880
I'm on empty, dude.

292
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,711
I've already told Andy all my secrets.

293
00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:10,261
If she finds out I'm hiding something,
she'll kill me.

294
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,301
I'll talk to Jessi.

295
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,403
*

296
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:28,372
Hi, Jessi.

297
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:37,010
Everybody's talking about me.

298
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,782
They're talking about "the mystery
jumper" there's a difference.

299
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:41,663
What should I do for my next trick?

300
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:43,670
How about nothing?

301
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:45,982
Why not? It's fun.

302
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,381
No one knows it's me.

303
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:49,901
No one knows yet.

304
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:52,990
Would it be so bad if they did?

305
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:59,011
I did something this morning
that someone saw.

306
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:02,031
And by this afternoon,
she had told three friends.

307
00:16:02,786 --> 00:16:05,000
And if those three friends
tell three more,

308
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:07,353
by this weekend, I'll have
half of Seattle in my backyard

309
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,953
waiting for me
to do something extraordinary.

310
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:11,493
What's so wrong with that?

311
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:15,391
Because then I won't be able
to relax in my backyard.

312
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:18,550
I won't be able to enjoy
a quiet breakfast with my family

313
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:20,481
or a walk in the park
with Amanda.

314
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:23,793
I wanna figure out
what I'm gonna do with my life

315
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,353
without people watching me,

316
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,730
always waiting to see what I might do.

317
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:31,051
At least people would notice you.

318
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:34,841
Jessi, life shouldn't be
about getting noticed.

319
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:42,033
Look around.

320
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,251
That girl over there tosses her hair

321
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,141
every time a new guy
walks into the room.

322
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,301
And those guys?

323
00:16:50,315 --> 00:16:52,061
They're pretending to read magazines.

324
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,831
But really they're waiting to see

325
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:55,760
if the girl wiping the counter
is looking at them.

326
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:57,853
And the girl wiping the counter

327
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:59,873
is wearing a shirt
that's two sizes too small

328
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:02,040
so that the magazine guys
will watch her.

329
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:06,030
Hillary's decided to make
a career out of being fabulous

330
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:07,463
because girls that look just like her

331
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:09,641
are on most of the covers
of the magazines they sell here.

332
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:12,890
So do you really think that life
isn't about getting noticed?

333
00:17:15,646 --> 00:17:17,062
Just please, Jessi.

334
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:19,351
For me.

335
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:23,390
No more tricks, okay?

336
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,983
Promise?

337
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:34,603
I promise.

338
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:54,272
<i>This message goes out
to whoever faked that jump.

339
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:56,282
<i>You're nothing but a circus act.

340
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:57,850
<i>A one-hit wonder.

341
00:17:57,865 --> 00:18:00,462
<i>By tomorrow, you'll be forgotten,

342
00:18:00,477 --> 00:18:01,883
<i>and I'll still be here.

<i>Because I'm Hillary,
and I'm fabulous.

344
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:08,610
We've got a problem.

345
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:12,112
Jessi was caught on video today
jumping off the school roof.

346
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:14,793
Off the roof?

347
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:16,761
Yeah.

348
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,273
The whole school's trying
to figure out how it was done.

349
00:18:22,437 --> 00:18:25,182
- Which one is it?
- What do you mean, which?

350
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:25,981
Well, they are two.

351
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:27,810
The last one was posted an hour ago.

352
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,710
<i>When lounging
by the pool this spring,

00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:34,081
<i>it's important for guys to know

354
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:37,041
<i>that board shorts
are nothing more than manly.

355
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:43,800
Did she just...

356
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:51,250
Can you do that?

357
00:18:51,516 --> 00:18:52,791
Probably.

358
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:54,632
She has to quit showing off.

359
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:56,732
The whole world
will wanna know about her.

360
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:58,570
I don't think Jessi would mind that.

361
00:18:58,586 --> 00:19:00,522
But if they know about her,

362
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:02,380
eventually, they'll know
the truth about you.

363
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,670
It should be your choice if and
when you want that to happen.

364
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,832
I don't.

365
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:08,413
Not yet.

366
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:11,182
What are we gonna do?

367
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,091
<i>Hey, look, it's her!
She's the mystery jumper!

368
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:37,442
<i>Jessi.

369
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:39,523
Jessi, you gotta tell me.

370
00:19:39,535 --> 00:19:41,091
How'd you pull off your last stunt?

371
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:42,273
Stunt?

372
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:44,181
I studied the footage,
and there's, like,

373
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,193
here's no cables or wires.

374
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,482
Did you do something cgi?

375
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:48,612
No, I just...did it.

376
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:51,430
You ran across water?

377
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:54,550
I'm not believing that so much,
but whatever,

378
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:56,122
I'm totally hooked.

379
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,323
So, our terms are set.

380
00:20:02,338 --> 00:20:04,221
First base, no tongue,

381
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,131
to whoever figures out
how the magician did her tricks.

382
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:12,002
Is there any possibility for...
second base?

383
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:14,650
Dazzle me and we'll see.

384
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:18,643
I don't think you should do this.

385
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:22,041
I'm not really gonna actually let
any of them feel me up.

386
00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:25,130
I mean give so much attention to Jessi.

387
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:27,212
She's a hot story right now.

388
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,502
And if I cover it,

389
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,190
it puts the spotlight were it belongs.

390
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:31,760
Back on me.

391
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:34,550
How do you think
she actually did it?

392
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:36,740
Maybe the better angle
is why she did it.

393
00:20:36,755 --> 00:20:38,262
Well, that's obvious.

394
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:40,780
I mean, everyone's dying
for their 15 minutes.

395
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:43,473
You know, fame.

396
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:45,132
I'm not.

397
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:46,162
Please.

398
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:47,980
You just need a gimmick.

399
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,713
Figure out what makes you special.

400
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,021
How are you different
from everyone else?

401
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:54,863
I'll work on that.

402
00:20:56,897 --> 00:20:58,000
<i>Mr. Taylor.

403
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:01,133
Mrs. Trager,
I'm surprised to see you here.

404
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:02,871
I'm surprised to be here.

405
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:04,322
Is there a problem?

406
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:05,772
I'm concerned about Jessi.

407
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:09,303
Really? what's your concern?

408
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:10,841
Well, first of all,

409
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:12,533
I don't know
what your interest is in her.

410
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:15,053
Well, she's my daughter.

411
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:17,272
Scientifically, perhaps,

412
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:19,353
but there's a lot more
to parenting than DNA.

413
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,923
And based on her recent behavior,

414
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:23,112
you haven't quite gotten
a handle on it.

415
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:25,380
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

416
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:28,310
She's been getting herself filmed
doing things

417
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,073
no person should be able to do.

418
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,093
It's on the school web site,
the school blog.

419
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:36,713
You didn't know?

420
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:38,911
No.

421
00:21:38,926 --> 00:21:41,810
If that gets out, you'll have reporters
and photographers,

422
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:43,563
and whoever else
wants to analyze Jessi,

423
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:44,931
showing up at your door.

424
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:49,372
It's only a matter of time before
that kind of circus leads to Kyle.

425
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:51,482
I don't want that for him.

426
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:56,162
I don't want that for Jessi either.

427
00:21:58,088 --> 00:21:59,233
Look,

428
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,630
you can't know every little thing
your kids are doing.

429
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:03,383
vou can't be
with them 24 hours a day.

430
00:22:04,117 --> 00:22:06,483
But you can hold them accountable
for their actions.

431
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:09,531
If you really are Jessi's father,

432
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:10,932
start acting like it.

433
00:22:15,106 --> 00:22:16,222
There he is!

434
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:19,361
Hey! Hey! Hey! Excuse me.

435
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:21,510
You know that area
you caught yesterday?

436
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:24,351
That saved my firm 10 mil
in construction costs.

437
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:25,741
Glad I could help.

438
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:28,032
No, my boss would love
to have a sit-down with you.

439
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,570
- A sit-down?
- Yeah.

440
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:31,223
Have you ever considered engineering?

441
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,692
I need to learn more about it.

442
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:33,812
Look no further.

443
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:36,243
Back off, folks. I got first dibs.

444
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:39,471
Forget them. here's your future.

445
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:41,182
How to become a doctor.

446
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:42,903
A doctor?

447
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:45,793
Why?

448
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:48,133
Hello?
So you can save Andy.

449
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:49,842
Josh...

450
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,593
With your mind, maybe you could find
a cure for cancer.

451
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:55,751
I am definitely interested in medicine.

452
00:22:55,768 --> 00:22:56,922
Excellent.

453
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:58,921
And arts and physics
and carpentry.

454
00:22:58,937 --> 00:23:00,510
Carpentry?

455
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:02,932
You wanna waste your smarts on lumber?

456
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:05,803
I think if you wanna help Andy,
you should become a doctor.

457
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,353
No offense, dude.

458
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:10,553
That's the stupidest thing
you've ever said.

459
00:23:10,718 --> 00:23:12,063
Our brains are the same size.

460
00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:13,600
I just use more of mine.

461
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:15,333
But it's so easy for you.

462
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,373
I barely passed science.

463
00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:19,650
I'll help you.

464
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,653
<i>I'll take a Madacorp brochure.

465
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:26,532
<i>Hi.

466
00:23:26,925 --> 00:23:28,493
Start with oncology.

467
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:32,850
On...what-ogy?

468
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:40,102
Why are you here?

469
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:44,373
Madacorp's always looking for
students with potential.

470
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:46,483
And what do you know?
I just found one.

471
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:48,803
I don't want anything
to do with Madacorp.

472
00:23:48,997 --> 00:23:51,533
- Emily?
- Jessi.

473
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,133
I was hoping I'd see you here today.

474
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,643
I don't know if it'll mean much,

475
00:23:56,658 --> 00:23:59,041
but for what it's worth,
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

476
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:00,932
And I wanna make it up to you.

477
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:02,520
How?

478
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:04,293
Work with me,

479
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:06,683
and I'll make sure that
you're appreciated.

480
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:09,822
People all over the world
will be fascinated by your gifts.

481
00:24:09,837 --> 00:24:11,731
You'd be respected and admired.

482
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:13,923
I mean, the possibilities
are just so exciting.

483
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:16,012
We should sit down
and go through them all.

484
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:17,742
- I'd love to.
- No.

485
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:20,203
Why not?

486
00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:25,553
We need to talk.

487
00:24:28,356 --> 00:24:29,730
You know where to find me.

488
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:40,510
How could you get involved
with Emily after everything she did?

489
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:42,301
You're just angry about the video.

490
00:24:43,268 --> 00:24:45,393
You promised me
you wouldn't do anything.

491
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:47,550
I don't wanna hide who I am.

492
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:50,242
Who you are should be about
your character, Jessi,

493
00:24:50,337 --> 00:24:52,801
not about impressing people
with the things you can do.

494
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:55,532
Don't tell me what do do anymore.

495
00:24:55,547 --> 00:24:57,480
I'm just asking you to be careful.

496
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,003
I'll do what I want,
and I'll be who I want.

497
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:04,283
You're right.

498
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:07,153
You do what's best for you...

499
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:09,133
And I'll do the same.

500
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:31,162
Endless possibilities.

501
00:25:31,685 --> 00:25:33,221
That's what scares me.

502
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:36,323
Kyle, you'll excel at anything
you set your mind to.

503
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,813
You just have to choose
what interests you.

504
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:42,180
It all interests me,
that the problem.

505
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:45,030
Maybe you're not destined
to do just one thing.

506
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:46,023
Look at Baylin.

507
00:25:46,036 --> 00:25:48,160
He was a scientist, an inventor,

508
00:25:48,316 --> 00:25:50,342
philosopher, writer.

509
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:52,670
I wonder if he had a nosy neighbor

510
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:54,151
and an uncontrollable friend.

511
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,923
I'm sure he had his own set of problems.

512
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:01,990
Am I wrong,

513
00:26:02,408 --> 00:26:04,332
judging Jessi for what she's doing?

514
00:26:05,907 --> 00:26:08,591
Is it wrong for me to wanna keep
this whole life to myself?

515
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:13,381
I guess that depends on your reasons
for wanting to hide it.

516
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:18,992
I was watching
this science documentary with Josh.

517
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:21,240
Josh watched a documentary?

518
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:24,892
It was hosted by
one of those naked magazine rabbits.

519
00:26:25,198 --> 00:26:28,020
Bunnies. Okay, go on.

520
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:30,033
Anyway,

521
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:32,193
they kept a rat in a cage,

522
00:26:32,306 --> 00:26:34,181
and the scientists kept running tests

523
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:37,182
and taking its blood and monitoring
every move that it made.

524
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:39,510
And you don't want
that to happen to you.

525
00:26:42,888 --> 00:26:44,250
But then again,

526
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:46,382
the tests they ran on the rat

527
00:26:46,395 --> 00:26:48,462
helped them get closer
to finding answers.

528
00:26:49,405 --> 00:26:51,340
The rat didn't have a choice
in the matter,

529
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:52,742
so why should I?

530
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:55,201
I mean, I know there's people
who don't approve

531
00:26:55,218 --> 00:26:56,681
of using the rat
in the first place, but...

532
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:59,532
Kyle, you're a teenaged boy.

533
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:02,150
No one should be allowed
to take your life away from you

534
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:04,093
before you've had
a chance to live it.

535
00:27:05,286 --> 00:27:08,263
But why is my life more
important than the rats?

536
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:12,090
Because you're the kind of person

537
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:13,831
who thinks to ask that question.

538
00:27:23,998 --> 00:27:25,841
There should be laws
against people like her.

539
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:28,780
Pretty in the face, dark in the soul.

540
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:31,912
Please! She's not that pretty.

541
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,170
Okay, she's kinda pretty.

542
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:41,281
Here she comes.
Try not to drool.

543
00:27:42,316 --> 00:27:44,141
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

544
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,840
So you made some new friends.

545
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:48,331
Oh, yeah. Isn't it great?

546
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,363
Are you going to Preston's
party this weekend?

547
00:27:55,138 --> 00:27:56,470
Or didn't you know?

548
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,720
I haven't really seen him, so...

549
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:02,311
I can't imagine he wouldn't invite you.

550
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,970
Whatever. Preston's parties
are so yesterday.

551
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:06,670
Really?

552
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:12,742
I heard they were... "a-list" only.

553
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:17,511
Well, see ya.

554
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:24,943
She totally grossed you.

555
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,810
"are you going to Preston's
party this weekend?"

556
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:30,710
That's my line.

557
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,643
I saw the tapes.

558
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,643
And you're right.

559
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:43,521
I don't know how to handle her.

560
00:28:46,645 --> 00:28:48,950
I know what
you must think of me, but...

561
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:53,700
I wanted to show you that
I've come here in good faith.

562
00:28:57,765 --> 00:28:59,251
Where did you get this?

563
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:03,860
The day you sold it
at the pawn shop,

564
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,390
I went and bought it back.

565
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:08,932
I needed to keep it safe

566
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:10,912
until you realized its importance.

567
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,293
It's a Latnok ring.

568
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:15,881
That's the symbol.

569
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:19,010
But if this is the ring
that Adam gave me...

570
00:29:21,098 --> 00:29:22,592
Whose ring is this?

571
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:24,872
That's Ballantine's father's.

572
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:26,741
He was a member as well.

573
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:28,953
All the members received rings.

574
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:30,701
It was a way
of identifying one another

575
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:32,710
and the location of their safe house.

576
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:35,042
And you're a Latnok?

577
00:29:35,348 --> 00:29:36,663
Yes.

578
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:40,912
I know that you think
that I'm a bad guy,

579
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:44,762
and I cannot deny that I've made
some questionable decisions

580
00:29:45,686 --> 00:29:47,710
that may not have been
in your best interest.

581
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:52,261
But right now, my main concern
is Jessi's behavior.

582
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:54,672
You don't know anything about her.

583
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:57,651
How would you describe Adam Baylin?

584
00:29:58,287 --> 00:30:01,073
Warm. Brilliant. Caring.

585
00:30:03,577 --> 00:30:05,773
Do you use those words
to describe Kyle?

586
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,031
Absolutely.

587
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:12,883
See, Adam came by
all of that just naturally.

588
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:17,910
He had the kind of soul that
people just instantly connected with.

589
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:20,383
Sara, she was different.

590
00:30:20,637 --> 00:30:22,133
And Sara was...

591
00:30:22,265 --> 00:30:23,660
Jessi's mother.

592
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:28,562
She was beautiful and brilliant and...

593
00:30:29,158 --> 00:30:32,892
Stubborn, impetuous, and volatile.

594
00:30:34,988 --> 00:30:36,932
Does it remind you of anybody
that you know?

595
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:43,552
You don't have to like me.

596
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:48,513
But please,
don't abandon Jessi.

597
00:30:49,005 --> 00:30:50,490
She deserves better.

598
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:53,303
As did Sara.

599
00:30:59,246 --> 00:31:02,093
Illicit partying, daytime rebellion,

600
00:31:02,118 --> 00:31:04,960
Fabulousness uncensored...

601
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:09,132
Hey! aren't you in enough trouble?

602
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,592
I've cleaned 87 gym mats.

603
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:13,773
I'm already in hell.
Why stop now?

604
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:15,203
Where's Andy?

605
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:17,323
She's chosen this week
to be responsible.

606
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:19,281
Responsible during career days?

607
00:31:19,298 --> 00:31:21,360
She's a rebel,
what can I tell you?

608
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:25,542
Declan finally got that ankle
of his fixed, huh?

609
00:31:25,577 --> 00:31:26,993
Well, well, well.

610
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:29,341
Look at who the arthroscopic
cat dragged in.

611
00:31:29,357 --> 00:31:32,082
Nice. make fun of a disabled person.

612
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:34,340
You hurt yourself fleeing
from a villainous

613
00:31:34,357 --> 00:31:35,632
mega-corporation.

614
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:37,621
It's not exactly Helen Keller material.

615
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:40,693
You could feel sorry for me losing
a basketball scholarship.

616
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:42,242
I've seen your house.

617
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:43,831
Cry me a river, rich boy.

618
00:31:43,845 --> 00:31:45,031
All right.

619
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:47,331
I hobbled my post-surgical
self up here.

620
00:31:47,345 --> 00:31:48,521
What's the occasion?

621
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:50,530
Well, everyone's all
aflutter over Jessi,

622
00:31:50,547 --> 00:31:51,981
the mystery jumper.

623
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:53,633
Hence roof party.

624
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:55,331
We're celebrating the fact

625
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,261
that Jessi's a maladjusted
attention seeker?

626
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:57,972
No,

627
00:31:57,988 --> 00:32:00,271
we're just using it as an excuse
to get out of career days.

628
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:02,631
I'm all for an excuse
to avoid the future,

629
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:04,503
but are we doing about Jessi?

630
00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:06,860
Kyle's adopted a hands-off policy.

631
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:09,662
He thinks she'll learn
her lesson on her own.

632
00:32:10,226 --> 00:32:11,882
I hope he's right.

633
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:15,001
I've got the battle scars from
keeping his identity a secret.

634
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:16,200
I'm not gonna be so psyched

635
00:32:16,216 --> 00:32:18,263
if jessi's stunts
start making headlines.

636
00:32:19,495 --> 00:32:21,013
Hey, there's the mystery jumper.

637
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:22,933
Oh, great.

638
00:32:22,946 --> 00:32:26,062
It's Jessi! Ready to wow us
with another trick?

639
00:32:27,336 --> 00:32:28,932
I don't do tricks.

640
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:30,961
Come on. Here's your chance.

641
00:32:30,977 --> 00:32:32,080
Show everyone what you can do.

642
00:32:32,098 --> 00:32:34,940
Don't encourage her.
She's a poser.

643
00:32:35,877 --> 00:32:37,121
I'm not a poser.

644
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:38,832
Right! Sorry.

645
00:32:38,846 --> 00:32:41,683
You're a superhero...
in schoolgirl's clothing.

646
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,261
Don't make fun of me.

647
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:45,022
Hils, give it a rest.

648
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:47,723
Why are you sticking up for me?

649
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:48,832
You don't even like me.

650
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:50,872
- Gee, I wonder why.
- Trager!

651
00:32:51,465 --> 00:32:53,790
Now, let's hear all the dirty laundry.

652
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:55,782
You can't be an attention whore

653
00:32:55,796 --> 00:32:57,540
and protect your privacy.

654
00:32:58,306 --> 00:33:01,030
Batgirl over here was
the one who beat up Lori.

655
00:33:01,978 --> 00:33:03,042
That... that wasn't me.

656
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:04,251
The hell it wasn't!

657
00:33:04,268 --> 00:33:06,553
No, I mean...
I'm not like that anymore.

658
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,873
Of course not, because now
you're the "mystery jumper."

659
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,311
I did jump.

660
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:14,190
- Total illusion.
- Hils, stop.

661
00:33:14,456 --> 00:33:16,222
Lori, she hurt you.

662
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,122
And now I'm gonna expose her
for who she really is.

663
00:33:19,137 --> 00:33:20,940
I really don't think that's...

664
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:23,382
Fine. I'll do it.

665
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:26,233
This is not gonna end well.

666
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:27,622
Bad idea, Jessi.

667
00:33:27,887 --> 00:33:28,980
Why?

668
00:33:28,998 --> 00:33:31,191
Everybody wants
to see how I did it.

669
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:33,111
I'll show you.

670
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:35,051
No tricks, no wires.

671
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,903
Get Kyle up here now.

672
00:33:53,536 --> 00:33:54,901
Jessi, don't do it.

673
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:58,163
I've done it before.
Don't worry about it.

674
00:34:00,236 --> 00:34:01,021
You getting this?

675
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:03,190
- We're rolling.
- Right, then.

676
00:34:10,956 --> 00:34:12,102
Wait.

677
00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:16,580
What are you doing?

678
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,002
I'm jumping, too.

679
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,591
Kyle, go away!

680
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:21,341
I wanna show them ho easy it is.

681
00:34:21,486 --> 00:34:23,551
- It isn't.
- You can do it.

682
00:34:24,426 --> 00:34:25,902
Because I'm special.

683
00:34:26,048 --> 00:34:28,213
How special are you
if I can do it, too?

684
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:34,513
Fine. Do it with me.

685
00:34:36,896 --> 00:34:38,292
I'm gonna jump, too.

686
00:34:38,586 --> 00:34:40,543
- What?
- You can't.

687
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:42,373
I'll beat you down there.

688
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,072
No. It's unsafe.
You'll get hurt,

689
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:45,273
then stop.

690
00:34:45,287 --> 00:34:47,023
I know how to do this.

691
00:34:47,355 --> 00:34:49,303
You're ruining it.

692
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:51,741
Back off and let me go.

693
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:01,100
Kyle...

694
00:35:01,118 --> 00:35:02,650
This is Jessi's moment.

695
00:35:25,198 --> 00:35:26,580
Thought so!

696
00:35:26,697 --> 00:35:28,482
You got all that, didn't you?

697
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,541
Every last humiliating bit.

698
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:37,011
I guess she did need
all the ropes and wires.

699
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:49,111
Another fraud exposed.

700
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:54,351
How'd you do it?

701
00:35:54,478 --> 00:35:55,552
Do what?

702
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:56,521
She jumped.

703
00:35:56,537 --> 00:35:58,023
The only way out was down.

704
00:35:58,127 --> 00:35:59,590
But she didn't fall.

705
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:01,852
I saw your face.
I know you did something.

706
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:10,380
The human body is more than 50% water.

707
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,590
And?

708
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,701
That's it.

709
00:36:17,057 --> 00:36:18,740
I don't get it.

710
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,463
Study up on your science.

711
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:21,950
You'll figure it out.

712
00:36:57,865 --> 00:36:59,092
Hi.

713
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:02,581
Hi.

714
00:37:18,638 --> 00:37:19,863
I'm sorry.

715
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:25,371
I didn't mean to make you look bad
in front of everyone.

716
00:37:29,268 --> 00:37:30,922
They all laughed at me.

717
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:40,341
I didn't want you to jump.

718
00:37:44,377 --> 00:37:46,211
I didn't want to jump either.

719
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:50,152
So why did you?

720
00:37:54,425 --> 00:37:57,023
I felt like I was losing
their approval.

721
00:37:59,555 --> 00:38:00,840
And...

722
00:38:01,845 --> 00:38:04,462
I didn't want to go back
to how I was before.

723
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:08,530
What were you before?

724
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,322
Invisible.

725
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,321
Jessi,

726
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,460
you were never invisible to me.

727
00:38:20,348 --> 00:38:23,602
Because you know my secret.
You know that I'm special.

728
00:38:26,008 --> 00:38:27,312
Yes...

729
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,510
You are.

730
00:38:30,447 --> 00:38:31,820
You're smart...

731
00:38:32,486 --> 00:38:34,362
And adventurous and creative.

732
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:38,481
And you don't need to do tricks
for people to see that.

733
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,911
And what if I don't even see it?

734
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:49,981
If there's one thing
I've learned about life,

735
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:53,590
from being here at this school
and with my family,

736
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:57,190
it's that the people
with the most to offer

737
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:59,210
usually believe
in themselves the least.

738
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:02,482
You don't.

739
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:07,340
Cause I have people
that believe in me.

740
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,941
So will you if you let them.

741
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:18,762
You gotta give it to her.

742
00:39:18,776 --> 00:39:21,080
Career days a lot more interesting
with Jessi around.

743
00:39:21,145 --> 00:39:23,760
I still vote for shoving her
back into the pod.

744
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,341
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

745
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:27,530
What's up with you?

746
00:39:27,547 --> 00:39:29,693
The woman over there
from the local cable station?

747
00:39:29,706 --> 00:39:30,991
She saw my blog.

748
00:39:31,006 --> 00:39:33,353
She said I pop on camera!

749
00:39:33,366 --> 00:39:36,500
And she offered me an internship.

750
00:39:36,726 --> 00:39:39,223
Hillary, that is fabulous!

751
00:39:39,436 --> 00:39:41,240
Now there'll be no living with you.

752
00:39:46,288 --> 00:39:47,591
Back to basics, huh?

753
00:39:47,897 --> 00:39:49,791
Enjoy it while it lasts.

754
00:39:49,906 --> 00:39:51,021
I do.

755
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:53,452
I thought I made it clear
that this fair

756
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:55,021
is intended only for those students

757
00:39:55,038 --> 00:39:56,781
who are serious about their future.

758
00:39:56,798 --> 00:39:58,631
- Do you know what?
- I got this.

759
00:39:59,368 --> 00:40:01,273
I am serious, Mr. Hooper.

760
00:40:01,548 --> 00:40:02,863
Maybe you're right about me.

761
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:05,242
Maybe I am lazy,
and I lack study skills,

762
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:07,352
but I've changed,

763
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:09,661
and I'm gonna do something
important with my life

764
00:40:09,676 --> 00:40:11,170
and make a difference.

765
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:13,611
Well,

766
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:15,621
that's all I wanted to hear.

767
00:40:20,266 --> 00:40:22,240
That's some serious gumption.

768
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:24,372
Is that a good thing?

769
00:40:24,418 --> 00:40:25,851
What got into to?

770
00:40:26,997 --> 00:40:28,470
I made the decision.

771
00:40:28,647 --> 00:40:30,130
I chose a career.

772
00:40:30,306 --> 00:40:31,730
And?

773
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:34,072
Call me Dr. Trager.

774
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:36,442
Really?

775
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:38,061
Yeah.

776
00:40:38,556 --> 00:40:40,131
I wanna be the one to save you.

777
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:45,890
Josh, you realize
you're looking at, like,

778
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:49,570
ten more years of school before
you actually become a doctor.

779
00:40:49,965 --> 00:40:53,660
Then I guess you're gonna have
to stick around for quite a while.

780
00:41:05,235 --> 00:41:06,912
<i>The future was still wide open,

781
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:10,833
<i>and my choices
still seemed limitless.

782
00:41:12,277 --> 00:41:15,723
<i>I knew that someday I might
need to use my abilities more openly,

783
00:41:15,737 --> 00:41:17,171
<i>as I had done to help Jessi,

784
00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:20,593
<i>and that my gifts
might invite attention.

785
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:29,222
<i>But for now, I just
felt lucky and content,

786
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:32,120
<i>because I could let my gifts evolve

787
00:41:32,137 --> 00:41:34,211
<i>while I enjoyed the comfort
of my home and family.

788
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:37,230
Oh, hi, Mrs. Bloom.

789
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,231
Another beautiful day.

790
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:42,812
Isn't it?

791
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,501
No worries.

792
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,832
Decide to call it a night?

793
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,362
I'm pretty tired.

794
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:13,033
So how was school today?

795
00:42:15,488 --> 00:42:16,711
It turned out okay.

796
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:20,231
You learn anything interesting?

797
00:42:23,456 --> 00:42:26,031
I learned the most important
thing is to be myself.

798
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:29,801
That's, uh...

799
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:32,043
That's a good lesson.

800
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:38,300
Sleep well.

801
00:42:44,675 --> 00:42:45,892
Jessi.

802
00:42:46,966 --> 00:42:48,273
I'm glad you're here.

803
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:51,243
See you in the morning.

804
00:42:51,627 --> 00:42:53,100
All right. Good night.

805
00:42:57,155 --> 00:43:19,382
