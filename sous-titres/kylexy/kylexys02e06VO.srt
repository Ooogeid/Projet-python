1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:01,762
Previously on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:01,855 --> 00:00:04,070
- I'm Adam Baylin.
- What do you want from me?

3
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:06,504
- What would you like to know?
- Everything.

4
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:07,815
Are they your family?

5
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:09,519
They were killed by a drunk driver.

6
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:10,991
You were the drunk driver.

7
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,939
She thinks that she's my sister.

8
00:00:13,127 --> 00:00:14,660
I'm just supposed to live that lie?

9
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:17,039
She's the computer,
and her life is the program.

10
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:19,671
I'm... Declan, by the way.

11
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:23,660
Usually, that would be
where you'd say your name.

12
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,086
Jessi.

13
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,648
- I wanna break up.
- I doesn't matter anyway.

14
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:29,005
I've already erased you.

15
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:30,268
You and me? Done.

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,729
Never happened.

17
00:00:32,687 --> 00:00:33,815
What is this?

18
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:35,130
It's your new car.

19
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:37,231
It doesn't run right now,
we're gonna fix it up.

20
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,516
Kyle just read the manual.

21
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:41,437
Since my dad died,
we've been having money troubles.

22
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:45,193
- I have a job interview.
- What's the job?

23
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:47,964
- Welcome to Madacorp.
- I can't wait to be part of the team.

24
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:50,538
I'm gonna stay here
and see if I can help.

25
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:51,778
Why would you do that?

26
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:54,862
You think I'm just gonna
walk away from you now?

27
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:04,553
People live much of
their lives in uncertainty.

28
00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:06,617
What might happen in a week...

29
00:01:07,464 --> 00:01:08,299
a month...

30
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:09,930
a year.

31
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:13,224
I wondered about my own life,

32
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:16,356
if I would be able to answer
the questions had kept appearing.

33
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,697
I guess, I, too,
was looking for certainty.

34
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:21,890
It's a done deal.

35
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:23,838
I'm scoring Dava Avina.

36
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:26,120
She looks nice.

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,201
Kittens are nice.

38
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:29,673
Dava's...

39
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:32,799
Well, hopefully, she's not nice.

40
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:36,829
I thought you two were just
study partners for biology lab.

41
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:38,385
It may have started there,

42
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:40,066
but I knew we were destined for more.

43
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:41,568
You see, Kyle,

44
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,733
women are attracted to success.

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,398
They can't resist it.

46
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:48,482
And in high school,
success means... a car.

47
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:53,537
Boys, life is not like a rap video.

48
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:55,737
Having a pimped out car
doesn't guarantee

49
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:57,709
your hand gets anywhere near her bra.

50
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,092
If she wears one.

51
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:02,336
What is with boys and breasts?

52
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:05,514
Don't side with her, buddy.

53
00:02:05,703 --> 00:02:07,045
You're breaking a sacred bond.

54
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:10,987
- I'm Andy.
- Kyle.

55
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,364
I'm in the middle of teaching
Kyle about life and love.

56
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,265
Then I am thwarting a great injustice.

57
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:18,245
Let me set you straight on
what girls actually like.

58
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:20,044
I want you...

59
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:22,084
to remember this moment.

60
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:27,494
"Remember this moment."

61
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:30,345
The words triggered something,
and suddenly...

62
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:32,383
I saw things that
shouldn't have been there.

63
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:34,979
A fishbowl.

64
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:36,600
A postcard.

65
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:40,131
And the urn that contained
Adam Baylin's ashes.

66
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:54,654
You okay, dude?

67
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,317
Kyle, you all right?

68
00:03:08,326 --> 00:03:10,283
I feel like something bad
is about to happen.

69
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:39,250
I got two words for you...

70
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:41,412
"Lottery ticket."

71

Season 2 Episode 6
-  Does Kyle Dream of Electric Fish -

74
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,629
- Hey, you guys okay?
- Awesome.

75
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,640
Our little alien can predict the future.

76
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,107
You should see The Rack.

77
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:12,480
It's not the place I would call
earthquake friendly.

78
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:13,729
Then what are you doing home?

79
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:15,199
Checking out my ride for damage.

80
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,034
You should check your room.
It looks like it was hit pretty hard.

81
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,621
No, it was like that before.

82
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:25,903
Did Josh think you predicted
the earthquake?

83
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:30,367
I had a feeling something bad
was gonna happen.

84
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,755
And then everything started shaking.

85
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:37,237
You know, certain animals seem
to anticipate natural disasters.

86
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,172
It's not out of the realm
of scientific possibility.

87
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:43,269
Is there something else?

88
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,477
I saw some things.

89
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,873
What things?

90
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:52,166
Things that were there...

91
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:53,557
and then weren't.

92
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:55,917
Like I was dreaming,
except I was awake.

93
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,899
Sounds like you had some sort of vision.

94
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:00,704
A vision.

95
00:05:01,865 --> 00:05:02,865
Is that normal?

96
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:07,454
I think we need to expand our definition
of normal when it comes to you.

97
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,038
I need the right shirt for tomorrow.

98
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:10,774
You're choosing already?

99
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:12,358
It's my first big day.

100
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,610
Well, you want confident,
but not overbearing.

101
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:26,303
Thank you.

102
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,137
You're welcome.

103
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,171
I like the green.

104
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:32,883
It's perfect for the brilliant new guy
in the software division.

105
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:33,977
Right.

106
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,527
Look, I know I've been
stressed out looking for work.

107
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:39,215
Things have been a little shaky lately.

108
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:42,195
I've been a little shaky myself.
And for a lot longer than you.

109
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,050
I think I can cut you some slack.

110
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,527
I think the future's looking up for me.

111
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:49,247
We're gonna be just fine.

112
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,774
You're totally screwed.

113
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:53,718
You're exaggerating.

114
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,937
You couldn't be more screwed

115
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:56,942
if you were between
a wall and a Phillips head.

116
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,774
I'm golden. I shoot from the hip.

117
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:01,514
Girls like spontaneity in a man.

118
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:03,025
Girls like a plan.

119
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,765
Spontaneity is code for
"I couldn't be bothered."

120
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:10,258
Then what about bowling?

121
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:12,148
Or...

122
00:06:12,232 --> 00:06:14,919
we could look for something
that doesn't scream "seventh grader".

123
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:16,933
Next.

124
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,452
I can't believe I'm doing this.

125
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:25,857
What?

126
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:30,304
For the good of our species,

127
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,099
I'll help you plan your first date.

128
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:36,792
Look, you said I've been kissed before.

129
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:39,776
Yes, I have. Many times.

130
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,823
Maybe this isn't the best idea for you.

131
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:46,322
How can you watch that?

132
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,861
Let's not think about that.

133
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:49,002
I like it.

134
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:51,016
My heart pounds like a drum
when you're near.

135
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:53,485
I can feel it.

136
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,962
Take me away from here...

137
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:57,531
to a place where we...

138
00:06:57,977 --> 00:06:59,685
Remember your appointment today.

139
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:06,862
- You have a session this afternoon.
- All right. I'll be there.

140
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:11,394
Then kiss me.

141
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:14,117
Don't make me ask again.

142
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,769
I don't know how else to explain it.

143
00:07:19,323 --> 00:07:20,631
Predict the future.

144
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:22,415
I know it sounds weird.

145
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:25,400
Who knows what you can do?

146
00:07:26,953 --> 00:07:27,953
We should...

147
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:29,558
We should check Baylin's notes

148
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:31,693
and see if he documented
anything about this.

149
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,770
All right.

150
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:36,170
That phrase that you solved,
"Viz Allati"?

151
00:07:36,448 --> 00:07:38,186
It's Hungarian.
It means "underwater".

152
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:39,833
You looked it up?

153
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:41,251
No, I just know it.

154
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:45,332
Since when could you speak Hungarian?

155
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:53,371
Lori, here.

156
00:07:58,037 --> 00:07:59,037
That was for you.

157
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,200
Open mic night?

158
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:03,736
I just started playing.

159
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:05,170
I've heard you. You're good.

160
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:07,700
- How do you know?
- I live next door to you, remember?

161
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,747
I hear everything that
comes out of your bedroom.

162
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,047
Awesome.

163
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:14,269
Take it from someone
who knows a thing or two

164
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:16,660
about getting their heart
torn out and stomped on.

165
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:18,571
You need to vent.

166
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,003
I'm serious about open mic night.

167
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,391
Singing about your heartache
could be very therapeutic.

168
00:08:27,894 --> 00:08:28,925
Technology.

169
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,156
Science.

170
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,310
Art.

171
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:34,667
Only one company integrates all three

172
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,999
for the benefit of mankind.

173
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:38,848
Madacorp.

174
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:42,679
Ground-breaking research
for tomorrow's solutions.

175
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,533
Madacorp.

176
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:47,610
Building foundations for tomorrow.

177
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,503
Technology.

178
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,811
Science.

179
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:52,996

180
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,330
Only one company integrates all three

for the benefit of mankind.

182
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,766
My mom's been working
really hard, but...

183
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,243
we still had to make some sacrifices.

184
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:41,042
The car and the piano were mine.

185
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:44,257
You two are in it together.

186
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:46,226
Which is nice, but...

187
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,332
it would be nicer if I knew things
were gonna get better soon.

188
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:50,690
It will.

189
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:52,725
You know that for a fact?

190
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:56,828
Do you think it's possible
somebody could?

191
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,103
It would be cool, wouldn't it?

192
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:02,812
If I knew everything was gonna turn out
okay, I could deal with the bad.

193
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,505
It's not knowing that drives you crazy.

194
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,629
So predicting the future
could be a good thing.

195
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,513
Sure. I mean, I guess
you'd never be surprised.

196
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:12,800
And, believe me,

197
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:14,978
lately surprises aren't
all their cracked up to be.

198
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:18,271
There you go.

199
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,460
Anything for the Tragers?

200
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:22,728
Let me check.

201
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,202
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

202
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:31,621
See you later.

203
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:33,022
See you.

204
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:02,931
Hi.

205
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:04,048
Hey.

206
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:06,499
Come in.

207
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:09,717
How's the date training going?

208
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:14,520
Let's just say I'm making the world
safer for ovaries everywhere.

209
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,051
It's nice of you to help him.

210
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:19,814
Oh, it's not nice.
It's a public service.

211
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:21,540
I mean, he's a walking disaster.

212
00:11:21,634 --> 00:11:23,237
He doesn't have a clue about women.

213
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,909
This girl he's after?
She's not the sharpest tool in the shed.

214
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:29,425
And his sense of humor?
Sort of specific. So, strike one.

215
00:11:29,528 --> 00:11:31,373
She's not gonna notice how funny he is.

216
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:33,327
Strike two are those T-shirts he wears.

217
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,390
I'm a T-shirt girl, so I get it.

218
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:37,420
But that Dava person?

219
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:40,228
Can I just say, we're gonna need
an extreme makeover.

220
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:43,860
- Is there a strike three?
- He doesn't know how to talk to girls.

221
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:46,832
I guarantee you...
he brings up on-line gaming,

222
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,189
and he's a virgin till he's 30.

223
00:11:49,302 --> 00:11:50,482
But you like on-line gaming.

224
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:52,666
Yeah, well, he's not going
on a date with me.

225
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:54,053
Sounds like he should be.

226
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:55,575
Um... ew?

227
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:01,336
Did you find anything?

228
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:02,491
Nothing yet.

229
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:10,577
What would you do
if you could predict the future?

230
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,811
Wished I could have done it sooner.

231
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,087
Will you tell me about them?

232
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:26,732
Your wife and daughter.

233
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:31,161
Keep looking.

234
00:12:49,993 --> 00:12:50,996
Hello.

235
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,304
Hello.

236
00:12:54,902 --> 00:12:56,189
Um, can I help you?

237
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:58,082
Oh, Nicole's expecting me.

238
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,674
Oh, well, her office is this way.

239
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,273
I know.

240
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:05,718
We haven't officially met. I'm Lori.

241
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:07,496
Jessi.

242
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:10,071
I know you're new in town, so...

243
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,703
let me know if you need anything.

244
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:14,319
What would I need?

245
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:18,388
I could fill you in
on all things Seattle.

246
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:20,714
People to know, places to see.

247
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:25,306
Like I... I saw you hanging out
with Declan McDonough.

248
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:27,784
He and I used to be very close, so...

249
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:30,719
if you have any questions,
I could answer them for you.

250
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,340
- Questions?
- He can be like any guy.

251
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,965
A real asshole when he puts
his mind to it, in fact, but...

252
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:40,802
under all that I can tell you
he's got a really good heart.

253
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,312
Does your heart pound
like a drum when he's near?

254
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:51,257
Jessi.

255
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,453
I didn't hear you come in.

256
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:55,305
That's okay.

257
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,479
Uh, shall we head to my office?

258
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:12,470
This car is gonna be a babe mobile.

259
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:15,528
Like money in the bank. Ka-ching.

260
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:18,657
What?

261
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:20,166
Nothing.

262
00:14:21,065 --> 00:14:22,219
Back to work.

263
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:24,829
You get to the house. What do you do?

264
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:27,425
Easy. Roll up, honk the horn.

265
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:28,915
Stop.

266
00:14:29,378 --> 00:14:31,025
You give your date the beep-beep,

267
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:34,485
and the only person you'll have running
out of the house will be her dad...

268
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:35,928
to pound on you.

269
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:39,009
You go to the door.
Attempt to be cool.

270
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:40,809
I knew that.

271
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,654
Now, she's in the car.
Show me what you're gonna do.

272
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,066
What? With you?

273
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,013
If you can't do it with me, how are you
gonna do it with a real girl?

274
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,383
I mean...

275
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:54,825
You know what I mean.

276
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,922
Come on.

277
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:57,914
Pretend I'm your date.

278
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,053
Look, I'm the irresistible Dava.

279
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:04,955
Make your move.

280
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:17,310
I don't even know why I bother with you.

281
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:18,596
It's the car.

282
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:23,347
Let me ask you a question.

283
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,335
Why did you ask her out?

284
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:28,022
It can't just be because of her boobs.

285
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:30,562
Oh, my God. It was.

286
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:35,424
You okay?

287
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:38,890
Yeah. Your stupid just...

288
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:41,400
sucked all the air outta the car.

289
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:43,198
Here, I'll get the window.

290
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:49,916
Josh?

291
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,620
You get fired already?

292
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:55,398
I'm just grabbing some software
and then I'm heading back.

293
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:56,635
Well, times have changed.

294
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:59,635
None of my dates ever helped me
get my car running beforehand.

295
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:01,824
Dad, this isn't my date.

296
00:16:01,937 --> 00:16:03,054
It's just Andy.

297
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:05,207
- Oh, well, hi, there.
- Hello.

298
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,033
She's helping me polish my game
to a mirror-like shine.

299
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,288
Well, we better put some time
in this thing, otherwise...

300
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:14,229
your date, whoever she is,
will be riding your handlebars.

301
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:22,859
We've been at this for hours.

302
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:25,567
Baylin didn't record anything
about premonitions.

303
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,075
This is useless.

304
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,850
When I touched the book,
I found myself in another vision.

305
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,573
But this time instead of Baylin's urn,

306
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,431
I saw the man himself.

307
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:05,166
What happened?

308
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:07,790
What did you see?

309
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,345
Adam was there.

310
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:12,749
Baylin?

311
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:14,516
He gave me this.

312
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,238
You wrote that.

313
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:20,360
You walked over here, you picked up
the pad and you wrote that yourself.

314
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:44,859
Well, it's definitely your handwriting.

315
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:47,017
You must have sent it to yourself.

316
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:48,918
- Forgotten I sent it?
- You must have been

317
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:52,381
in some kind of altered state, like
before when you said you saw Baylin.

318
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:55,045
But why send myself
something so cryptic?

319
00:17:55,594 --> 00:17:57,566
Why not just write
what I knew was coming?

320
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,487
We may be looking at this
in the wrong angle.

321
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,569
What if you're not seeing the future?

322
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,356
It could be your subconscious trying
to tell you something, from your past.

323
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:08,881
The things that you're seeing, they
could be symbols for something else.

324
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:10,479
Nicole called them visions.

325
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:11,652
You're...

326
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,102
talking to her about this? You can't!

327
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,385
I am the only one that you can trust.

328
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:23,935
If you have a question or you need to
talk about something, you come to me.

329
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:25,952
I'm just confused.

330
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:28,789
Why is this happening to me now?

331
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,046
Well, we've been working hard,
making progress,

332
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,549
maybe your mind had to reach
a certain level of control

333
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:35,636
before these...

334
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:38,254
visions could present themselves.

335
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:42,120
The important thing now
is trying to figure out

336
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:44,926
what the message is that you're
trying to send to yourself.

337
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:46,490
I just hope we can.

338
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,362
I don't know how much longer
I can take this.

339
00:18:48,442 --> 00:18:50,180
I feel like I can't trust
anything I see.

340
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:56,533
No, that's real.

341
00:18:57,422 --> 00:18:59,402
And it's really out of tune.

342
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,937
And your eyes are where?

343
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:24,207
On her face. Not her chest.

344
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,549
What are the three L's?

345
00:19:27,638 --> 00:19:29,323
Listen, listen, listen.

346
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,894
And at the end of the night?

347
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,086
Feel her up.

348
00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:36,582
Kidding. Feel it out,

349
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:38,696
and if the moment seems right,

350
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,793
kiss her.

351
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:41,967
No tongue.

352
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:46,176
I guess you're as good
as you're gonna get.

353
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:48,899
Hey, Andy?

354
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,413
Thanks for everything.

355
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:56,406
Just don't blow it.

356
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:58,966
This is a one-time charitable donation.

357
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:21,401
Can I sit?

358
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,294
Sure.

359
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:31,782
So, I think we've hit the end of
our break-up drama shelf life.

360
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,942
Proper exchanges, avoiding eye contact,

361
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:36,169
all that.

362
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,183
It's getting kind of tedious. So,

363
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:40,746
I just wanted to say
that I'm done, and...

364
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,648
we should be able to inhabit
each others' space drama-free.

365
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:45,388
That's good.

366
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,085
And we should be able to talk
like two civilized people.

367
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:52,014
And if we're talking and everything,

368
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:54,298
then I should be able to warn
you about Crazytown.

369
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:56,975
- Crazytown?
- Oh, come on.

370
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,312
New hot patient of my mom's.

371
00:20:59,636 --> 00:21:02,757
I have seen the sparkage and
I know how you boys like the crazies.

372
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:05,659
Is this the part where you...
say we should still be friends?

373
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,530
If so, your lead-in kind of sucks.

374
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:11,313
I'm sorry. I'm being...

375
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,372
exactly the kind of girl that I hate.

376
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:18,426
Let's start over. I'm Lori Trager,
passive aggressive mean girl.

377
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:21,497
Declan McDonough,

378
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,304
crazy-chick magnet.

379
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,169
I guess I walked into that one.

380
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:32,588
I'm playing tonight.

381
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:34,296
You should come.

382
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:40,650
Are all your songs going to be about
the cruelty of teenage boys?

383
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:44,590
You're supposed to write
from experience.

384
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:02,816
- Hi.
- I've got to run.

385
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:05,318
I just want to make sure
you're coming to open mic night.

386
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,826
Are you playing, too?

387
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,089
No, I'm running the soundboard.

388
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:10,380
They're paying me, so...

389
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:13,305
it'll get me one step closer
to getting another piano.

390
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:15,642
I'm all messed up without one.

391
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:18,064
And playing the piano unmesses you.

392
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:22,247
When I play,

393
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:25,839
everything that drags me down
and distracts me disappears.

394
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,122
Music brings me clarity.

395
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:30,742
Clarity.

396
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:33,720
I could use some of that.

397
00:22:34,378 --> 00:22:35,583
Couldn't we all?

398
00:22:36,174 --> 00:22:38,103
- So will you be there?
- I will.

399
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:40,312
Great, then I'll see you.

400
00:22:43,757 --> 00:22:45,416
If music helped Amanda,

401
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:47,383
maybe that's what I needed

402
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,716
to shed my distractions and

403
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,231
better understand
the visions I'd been having.

404
00:23:07,374 --> 00:23:08,846
So, have you thought about...

405
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:10,555
what you want to do with your life?

406
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:12,380
What do you mean?

407
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:15,386
Well, have you thought
about your future?

408
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:16,856
My future?

409
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:19,142
No, not really.

410
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:24,631
Jessi, your parents may not have always
made the best choices for you, but...

411
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,146
you can change that now.

412
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,516
You make your own choices.

413
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:49,232
I was amazed by what I was seeing.

414
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:53,396
They were my memories cataloged of
everything since I'd left the pod.

415
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:56,445
I had developed a new ability.

416
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,482
I had complete control over my memories.

417
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:17,587
I want you to remember this moment.

418
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:20,968
Those were the words
that started my visions.

419
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:23,670
What was the moment
I needed to remember?

420
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:30,668
I want you to remember this moment.

421
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,402
That was it.

422
00:24:34,193 --> 00:24:35,680
Remember this moment.

423
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,879
After I'm gone,

424
00:24:38,035 --> 00:24:40,907
all of my experiences, everything
that I've studied and learned,

425
00:24:41,034 --> 00:24:42,034
will be yours.

426
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:44,676
You're special, Kyle.

427
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:48,828
You see the world from
a unique perspective.

428
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:51,405
Your mind's a powerful tool.

429
00:24:56,513 --> 00:24:57,515
Protect it.

430
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:04,892
I discovered not only
could I relive my memories,

431
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:07,479
I could actually move within them,

432
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:10,983
allowing me to view any moment
from anywhere I wanted.

433
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:12,270
Protect it.

434
00:25:13,654 --> 00:25:14,670
Use it wisely.

435
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,838
It was the book
I had touched at the warehouse.

436
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,061
I realized that Baylin
had hidden something inside.

437
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:23,314
You're more important than your mind.

438
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,419
It's your soul that touches people.

439
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,856
All of my memories
had led me to this disc,

440
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:18,769
but Adam's message still eluded me.

441
00:26:27,738 --> 00:26:29,171
Foss, I need to talk to you.

442
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:31,375
It's important.

443
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:50,427
Those things can be a real pain.

444
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:52,833
I think the new guy just
can't work the door.

445
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,261
Maybe you're just punching in
the wrong numbers.

446
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:57,113
Well, they wrote them down for me here.

447
00:26:58,512 --> 00:27:00,499
Well, is that one a four or a nine?

448
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:01,854
It's a four, right?

449
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:04,387
Says the man who can't open the door.

450
00:27:09,157 --> 00:27:10,953
Thanks. I'm Emily, by the way.

451
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:13,405
Stephen, and, uh, thanks.

452
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,010
Don't worry about it.

453
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:17,483
Look, let me take you to the lunchroom.

454
00:27:17,616 --> 00:27:18,750
Coffee machine in there,

455
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,084
now that's the real test
of intelligence.

456
00:27:23,072 --> 00:27:24,456
I love that shade of green.

457
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:41,655
Sorry I'm late.

458
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:43,646
It's not quite purring yet, huh?

459
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,265
More like coughing up hairballs.

460
00:27:47,183 --> 00:27:49,562
Well, just a few more tweaks,
we're almost there.

461
00:27:54,097 --> 00:27:55,245
I remember my first time.

462
00:27:56,085 --> 00:27:57,101
Gross, Dad.

463
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,501
I meant date, Josh.

464
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,669
Jenny Marie, she wore those...
Daisy Dukes.

465
00:28:04,846 --> 00:28:07,614
Despite further mental images
I'll have to purge,

466
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,253
what happened?

467
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,953
Nothing, really.
It wasn't that great.

468
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,213
Why wasn't it great?

469
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:16,768
Well, I don't know.

470
00:28:18,403 --> 00:28:19,837
There was just no...

471
00:28:20,886 --> 00:28:21,956
tap.

472
00:28:23,193 --> 00:28:25,467
- Tap?
- When I first took your mother out.

473
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:27,486
Uh, define "tap" please.

474
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:28,796
You know, my foot.

475
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:31,728
When I first took out your mother,

476
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,907
there was just this...

477
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:36,482
excitement, and...

478
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:38,469
in the middle of dinner, I...

479
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:41,642
realized my foot just kept tapping.

480
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:44,374
Look, all I'm saying is,

481
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,900
every guy has the idea
of a perfect date,

482
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:50,478
but the truth is, the right fit
isn't always what you expect.

483
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:53,295
Go ahead, try it again.

484
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:05,718
We need E.T.

485
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,245
Not to put any pressure on you,

486
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:14,786
but it's a 117 minutes
before I take my first step

487
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,398
into the great dating game of life.

488
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:18,768
Try it.

489
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,119
You forgot to open the fuel valve.

490
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:32,063
It's always right in front of you.

491
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:35,125
Who cares? It's alive!

492
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:44,386
I made your favorite, spaghetti.

493
00:29:44,754 --> 00:29:45,902
I miss Mom's.

494
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,177
I'll just be a sec.

495
00:29:59,987 --> 00:30:01,459
I know, sweetie.

496
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:04,128
Mommy will make you dinner
tomorrow night.

497
00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:09,433
Yeah, I know that I promised
it would be tonight, but...

498
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:11,344
Mommy has to work late.

499
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,068
Tell you what.

500
00:30:15,364 --> 00:30:17,978
I will come by and tuck you in, so...

501
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:19,769
pick out a book with Grandma.

502
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,173
Yeah, of course, any book.

503
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:28,237
All right. Two books.

504
00:30:30,587 --> 00:30:31,860
I love you, too.

505
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:34,167
All right.
See you soon.

506
00:30:45,106 --> 00:30:46,424
Who were you talking to?

507
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,356
Ah, just someone from work.

508
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:56,363
Here you go.
Jess, I have to leave for a while.

509
00:30:57,198 --> 00:30:59,562
You stay here.
Don't leave the apartment.

510
00:31:01,552 --> 00:31:02,958
Mushrooms are good.

511
00:31:03,716 --> 00:31:05,507
- What?
- Mushrooms.

512
00:31:05,737 --> 00:31:07,286
I thought I didn't like them.

513
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:11,149
Remember? They were on my pizza
at my ninth birthday. I got sick?

514
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,599
Mom said I was allergic.

515
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,829
Well, then I guess you are.

516
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:18,684
Then why can I have them
on the spaghetti now?

517
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,617
People change, Jess.

518
00:31:23,796 --> 00:31:25,062
I can change.

519
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:27,128
I can choose for myself now.

520
00:31:28,516 --> 00:31:30,214
Some things, yes.

521
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,755
Other things are decided for you.

522
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:35,910
You stay in the apartment.

523
00:31:36,488 --> 00:31:37,766
Is that clear?

524
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:43,454
Got it.

525
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:09,207
"Viz Allati" means "underwater".

526
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:12,375
Underwater.

527
00:32:14,858 --> 00:32:16,039
Underwater.

528
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:48,851
Underwater.

529
00:32:55,855 --> 00:32:58,264
Using parts from Josh's car radio,

530
00:32:58,474 --> 00:33:00,687
I designed a way to play the CD.

531
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,834
A way Adam knew only I could figure out.

532
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,227
Kyle, if you're listening to this,

533
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:08,120
you've passed a critical test.

534
00:33:09,546 --> 00:33:11,133
Here is your reward.

535
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,163
Memories are important.

536
00:33:14,962 --> 00:33:17,685
When I knew that I would not
always be here to guide you,

537
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:20,658
I knew I'd need a way to communicate,

538
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:23,877
in order to share my experiences,

539
00:33:24,773 --> 00:33:26,347
and more importantly,

540
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:29,212
assure you that you would
never be alone.

541
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:33,981
This is the beginning, Kyle.

542
00:33:35,591 --> 00:33:37,372
Your holographic memory

543
00:33:37,692 --> 00:33:39,893
will become an important
power to master.

544
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:43,176
The ability to explore
your memories will allow you

545
00:33:43,262 --> 00:33:45,217
to see things that others...

546
00:33:45,547 --> 00:33:46,641
and even you,

547
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,871
have missed.

548
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,534
So study the past, Kyle...

549
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:54,148
and understand that all of the answers

550
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,920
are already hidden in front of you.

551
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:03,461
At first I was relieved
to have the answer,

552
00:34:03,978 --> 00:34:06,025
but then something struck me as odd.

553
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:10,198
Why all that work
for such a simple message?

554
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:16,500
Any premonitions about my date?

555
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,184
Why? Are you nervous?

556
00:34:18,811 --> 00:34:21,947
Andy says nervousness is
the last refuge for the unprepared.

557
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:23,816
Sounds like her.

558
00:34:24,382 --> 00:34:25,575
You look nice.

559
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:29,546
Andy says this color
looks good with my eyes.

560
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,336
You know, once you get past
the smart-ass remarks and references

561
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:36,789
that I have to Google to understand...

562
00:34:37,747 --> 00:34:39,775
- she's...
- Pretty great?

563
00:34:44,712 --> 00:34:46,740
Anyway, about tonight.

564
00:34:47,048 --> 00:34:48,339
Predict my future.

565
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,072
Think I'll get lucky?

566
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:52,604
I think you already are.

567
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,690
You're starting to sound
like a Hallmark card.

568
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,639
- Is that for...
- Yes.

569
00:35:03,488 --> 00:35:05,332
It's very sweet.

570
00:35:06,512 --> 00:35:08,627
- Good luck, little brother.
- You, too.

571
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:16,978
We better go, too.
We're gonna be late.

572
00:35:17,174 --> 00:35:18,957
Where did you find a piano?

573
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:40,061
Here.

574
00:35:41,315 --> 00:35:42,594
I'll be right back.

575
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,662
You look very singer/songwriter.

576
00:35:52,957 --> 00:35:54,592
There are a lot of people here.

577
00:35:54,998 --> 00:35:56,676
Fifty doesn't exactly constitute a...

578
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:59,142
Okay, so it's not a stadium.
But still, I don't wanna,

579
00:35:59,228 --> 00:36:00,691
you know, suck.

580
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:02,007
You won't suck.

581
00:36:02,154 --> 00:36:04,970
If you get nervous, just look over at me
and remember how mad you are.

582
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:06,384
It'll be a nice distraction.

583
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,815
I'm not mad at you, anymore.

584
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:10,970
No?

585
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:12,127
No.

586
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:13,762
Shelf life, remember?

587
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:15,934
Cool.

588
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,012
Oh my god.
You did the beep-beep thing, didn't you?

589
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:49,599
I didn't beep. I knocked.

590
00:36:50,361 --> 00:36:51,787
And then I waited.

591
00:36:51,885 --> 00:36:54,062
And then I sat on the porch
for another 20 minutes.

592
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,586
You got stood up?

593
00:36:55,918 --> 00:36:57,012
Seems so.

594
00:36:57,586 --> 00:37:00,239
And since we didn't exactly
cover that part in out training,

595
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,049
I thought maybe...

596
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,211
Wait here.

597
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:17,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

598
00:37:17,686 --> 00:37:19,466
You're not gonna kick her ass, are you?

599
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:20,563
No.

600
00:37:20,747 --> 00:37:22,719
But I planned the perfect first date,

601
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:24,933
and no way in hell is it going to waste.

602
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,589
You're going on my date with me?

603
00:37:27,885 --> 00:37:29,213
It's my date now.

604
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,348
Does that mean you're buying?

605
00:37:32,827 --> 00:37:33,873
Come on.

606
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,960
Okay, this is it.

607
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:46,435
Don't worry.

608
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:51,022
Perfect.

609
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,690
Hello.

610
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:56,727
Hi.

611
00:37:57,476 --> 00:37:58,583
I met you.

612
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:00,955
I remember.

613
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:04,570
I asked about you.

614
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:07,295
What did you find out?

615
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,800
That you have a good heart.

616
00:38:13,013 --> 00:38:14,316
Want to feel mine?

617
00:38:16,603 --> 00:38:18,989
This is definitely a sign
that I should not play tonight.

618
00:38:20,157 --> 00:38:21,283
Why do you think that?

619
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:23,975
Because I wrote a song about...

620
00:38:25,156 --> 00:38:26,558
And he's with...

621
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,316
Playing tonight isn't about them.

622
00:38:30,468 --> 00:38:31,796
It's about you.

623
00:38:34,402 --> 00:38:35,607
If you wanna play...

624
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,795
play.

625
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,058
She need that...

626
00:38:50,193 --> 00:38:52,210
to know everything was gonna be okay.

627
00:38:52,726 --> 00:38:54,816
You're due for something good, too.

628
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,353
How do you know?

629
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:58,184
I can predict the future.

630
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:04,565
You okay?

631
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:08,106
Yeah, I'm... I'm hot.

632
00:39:11,352 --> 00:39:13,061
You should get some air.

633
00:39:14,637 --> 00:39:15,670
Yeah.

634
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,126
Hi, everyone. I'm Lori.

635
00:40:22,806 --> 00:40:24,188
You feel better?

636
00:40:25,805 --> 00:40:26,968
I feel great.

637
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:35,208
- Kiss me.
- What?

638
00:40:35,861 --> 00:40:37,508
Don't make me ask again.

639
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:21,108
As I listened to Lori play,

640
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:24,720
I understood that the future
would reach us all in different ways.

641
00:41:26,865 --> 00:41:29,233
Sometimes it would take
your breath away.

642
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:38,934
Sometimes it would be different
than the version you planned.

643
00:42:03,753 --> 00:42:05,251
Baylin was right.

644
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,561
The only certainty for the future...

645
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:18,322
is that the answers to the unknown are
most likely hidden right in front of us.

646
00:42:24,396 --> 00:42:26,638
The sound waves gave me the answer.

647
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,523
Baylin's true message
was an alpha-numeric cipher.

648
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:33,732
Each number corresponded to a letter.

649
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:36,473
And "Viz Allati" was the key
to unscrambling it.

650
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:39,619
I wondered why he had gone
to such great lengths

651
00:42:39,705 --> 00:42:41,428
to ensure only I could read it.

652
00:42:54,537 --> 00:42:57,943
Finally, I understood
what he wanted to tell me.

653
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:13,115
I went to the warehouse
to talk to him...

654
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:14,692
but Foss...

655
00:43:14,955 --> 00:43:16,841
and all traces of him...

656
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:18,538
were gone.
