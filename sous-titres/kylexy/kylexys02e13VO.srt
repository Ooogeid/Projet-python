1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,817
<i>Previously on</i> Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:04,027
- I'm Adam Baylin.
- So you created me.

3
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:08,866
He's been shot.

4
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:13,704
<i>I got accepted into
a music program in New York.</i>

5
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:15,873
- I leave in two days.
- Two days?

6
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:18,542
What if your father's trying
to communicate something through me?

7
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:20,335
<i>You're really communicating with him.</i>

8
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,141
Entire Zzyzx databank.

9
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:24,798
All of our research,
everything we've ever done or recorded,

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,276
- it's been copied.
- Copied? Where?

11
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:31,763
You were the one I could
always open up to. I miss this.

12
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:32,973
I miss you.

13
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:34,183
I miss you, too.

14
00:00:34,303 --> 00:00:36,894
- <i>Lori, what's wrong?</i>
- <i>Are you having an affair with Emily?</i>

15
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:39,005
Take him to Room 237.

16
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:43,358
Big Tom Foss.

17
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,380
You let them break you, Tom.

18
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:48,155
- Jessi needs your help.
- She's in danger, isn't she?

19
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:49,865
Only you can bring her home safely.

20
00:00:51,326 --> 00:00:53,577
<i>What I admire most about you
is your faith in people.</i>

21
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,954
But I worry this time
it's gonna be the end of you.

22
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:58,511
Why Jessi? How are you two connected?

23
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,659
- She and I are the same.
- What is that supposed to mean?

24
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:03,212
I don't even know who you are.

25
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:06,673
- I kept secrets about Kyle...
- I discovered something about Kyle...

26
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:08,508
You don't have to do what they want.

27
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:10,302
You can make your own choices.

28
00:01:10,422 --> 00:01:12,095
Now let me help you.

29
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:13,680
You'll take me back.

30
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,391
We're not going back,
not until this is all over.

31
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:28,869
<i>I'd risked everything to find her:</i>

32
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:32,334
<i>my home, my family, their trust.</i>

33
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:34,953
<i>No one understood why I believed in her.</i>

34
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:37,919
<i>Even she didn't feel
worthy of my belief.</i>

35
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,140
<i>But I felt somewhere
there must be good in her.</i>

36
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,539
<i>I wasn't sure where we should go,</i>

37
00:01:43,994 --> 00:01:45,921
<i>but we couldn't return home
until we were ready</i>

38
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,174
<i>to face the danger that awaited us.</i>

39
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:50,839
<i>And I had faith that together
we'd find our way.</i>

40
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:03,511
No appetite for Madacorp cuisine?

41
00:02:08,072 --> 00:02:10,654
I never expected things to go this far.

42
00:02:11,294 --> 00:02:12,733
I was supposed to...

43
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:16,785
facilitate the retrieval of data
from one superbrain to the next.

44
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:21,044
But all I've done
is manipulate a confused girl

45
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:23,686
and mess with an innocent family.

46
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:26,895
Now Kyle's run off after Jessi.

47
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:30,590
Ballantine's ordered me
to dispose of you.

48
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,395
I thought that I was
working for the good guys.

49
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,788
But the collateral damage
doesn't seem warranted.

50
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:12,731
- Foss, where are you?
- Never mind.

51
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:14,426
Just keep moving.

52
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:17,179
- Where? I'm with Jessi, I don't know...
- <i>Shut up and listen.</i>

53
00:03:17,694 --> 00:03:19,264
You already know where to go.

54
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,141
<i>It's someplace safe.</i>

55
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:22,934
You have all you need.

56
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:24,561
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,152
You heard me.

58
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,897
<i>I'll catch up to you.</i>

59
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,033
No. I want you to stay
and look after my family.

60
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:34,071
Foss, will you do it?

61
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,115
Yeah. Now just get rid of your phone.

62
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:39,826
- What?
- <i>Kyle, your phone.</i>

63
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,844
I said kill it.

64
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:51,213
You were right to tell me
that Jessi was gone.

65
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,450
But now we've lost both of them.

66
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:56,279
I thought Foss would
lead us straight to them.

67
00:03:56,412 --> 00:03:58,053
You underestimated him.

68
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,971
I'm getting tired of waiting.

69
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,975
- I'll find another way.
- You'd better, and quickly.

70
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:06,311
Now get the hell out of my office.

Season 2 Episode 13
- Leap of Faith -

74
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:33,230
We can't call the police,

75
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:34,373
not yet.

76
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:36,341
Well, we can't just sit here.

77
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:40,429
Our former security guard is locked up
at Madacorp by Kyle's parents' lawyer.

78
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:42,514
Obviously, something is very wrong.

79
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:45,371
- That's an understatement.
- I know you're upset,

80
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:47,602
but let's try to
make sense of things first.

81
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:49,896
Let Kyle find Jessi.

82
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,672
What does that have to do with it?

83
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:53,859
Everything is connected somehow.

84
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,195
- Hopefully, Kyle can explain.
- But will he?

85
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:00,740
He's been hiding things,
and you've been helping him.

86
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,358
You knew he rescued a girl from a fire
without getting so much as a blister.

87
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:08,874
It took you how many months
to mention it to me?

88
00:05:08,994 --> 00:05:11,280
He was afraid they would take him away.

89
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,337
I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.

90
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,242
Well, I'm not anyone.

91
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:19,092
I'm your husband.

92
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:22,853
There's trouble in paradise.

93
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,029
Go away.

94
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:26,862
I'm serious. I heard Mom and Dad
fighting about something,

95
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:29,561
and I haven't done anything lately,
so what's it about?

96
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:33,190
I don't know.
They didn't send me a memo.

97
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:37,042
We need Kyle to tune in
and do a little recon for us,

98
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:38,403
but I can't find him.

99
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,947
Well, he has to be here.
Mom has us on lockdown.

100
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:43,927
Unless he's added invisibility
to his bag of tricks,

101
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,353
he's not home.

102
00:05:45,993 --> 00:05:47,245
Maybe he went to Amanda's.

103
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,706
Maybe you know where he went.

104
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:55,337
He went after her, didn't he?

105
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:58,381
- Went after who?
- She-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.

106
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,135
How could he do that?

107
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:04,054
How can you cover for him?

108
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:07,028
What happened to your cooler head?

109
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:10,602
She's a horrible, toxic person
who attacked me.

110
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,704
He's not excusing her for what she did.

111
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,273
He just wants to bring her home.

112
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:17,077
Why?

113
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:20,113
Why does he have to be
all nice and sympathetic,

114
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,614
going all Kyle on her
when she doesn't deserve it?

115
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:24,950
You know Kyle. He sees something in her,

116
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:27,244
and his instincts about people
are always right.

117
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,996
We should give him
the benefit of the doubt.

118
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,361
Declan loaned you his car?

119
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,161
I told him I had to find you.

120
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:42,446
He must be angry,
now that he knows what I did to Lori.

121
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:44,745
Why did you do that?

122
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:47,439
How could you hurt her that way?

123
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:50,574
I don't know.

124
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,270
I couldn't control myself.

125
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,025
What is that supposed to mean?

126
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,410
You couldn't stop yourself
from hitting her?

127
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:00,834
Sometimes...

128
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:03,321
a darkness comes over me.

129
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:08,159
It scares me.

130
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:13,178
I'm really sorry it happened,

131
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:15,748
and I know Lori will never forgive me.

132
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:16,960
She may not.

133
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:21,268
You have to earn forgiveness.
You can't run from your mistakes.

134
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:23,091
You said we weren't going back.

135
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,137
Now until we get some answers.

136
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,842
- Where?
- Foss said I have all I need.

137
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:30,269
What does that mean?

138
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:33,435
The ring is all you need.

139
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:35,103
- What?
- Now go.

140
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:44,328
A ring?

141
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:46,775
It was a gift from Adam Baylin,

142
00:07:47,463 --> 00:07:48,607
my friend.

143
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,243
He created the experiment.

144
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,038
He doesn't sound like a friend.

145
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,207
He never meant to harm anyone.

146
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:08,762
They forced him out of Zzyzx
and then killed him.

147
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:14,976
I don't remember taking this.

148
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:16,297
That's not us.

149
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,641
That's Adam.

150
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,156
He looks just like you.

151
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:24,798
- She looks like...
- I know.

152
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,655
And if he created me...

153
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:28,494
I have to find her.

154
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:30,241
I have to know who this woman is.

155
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,914
"The light will show you the way. "

156
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:39,334
You know Hungarian?

157
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:41,526
I guess so.

158
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,690
The light will show you the way.

159
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,016
It's just a ring.

160
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,811
Nothing is just anything
if it comes from Adam.

161
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,393
There's a hole.

162
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:07,112
Where? In... In the stone?

163
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,605
No.

164
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:10,281
In the band behind the stone.

165
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,369
I think this goes way beyond
anything we could have imagined.

166
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:18,920
When I first lost my job,

167
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,815
all I knew was LWK Software
was bought up by another company.

168
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,868
What does that have to do with anything?

169
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,924
Well, I've been doing some digging,
and the company that bought LWK

170
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,987
is a subsidiary of Madacorp.

171
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,704
- That must be...
- Another coincidence?

172
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:35,745
Start a list.

173
00:09:37,214 --> 00:09:38,394
Kyle's father?

174
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:40,644
Here's one about his mom.

175
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:42,397
I found 15 different articles

176
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:45,498
on Kyle's parents over the past several
years, all of them glowing tributes.

177
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,095
So what's the problem?

178
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:48,887
Every one of them

179
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,567
was distributed on the web
on the same day,

180
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:54,223
like they were deliberately planted.

181
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:55,784
Why?

182
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,346
I don't know,

183
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,781
but those two showed up out of nowhere.

184
00:10:00,014 --> 00:10:02,091
Those two were his parents.

185
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:04,427
There was a blood test. They matched.

186
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:07,756
- And Kyle remembered them.
- Kyle remembered who?

187
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,258
Guys, this is private.

188
00:10:10,378 --> 00:10:12,093
Did you know Kyle went after Jessi?

189
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:19,434
- How could you let him do that?
- It's complicated.

190
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:20,602
Try me.

191
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,146
Not now. You're just
going to have to trust us.

192
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:31,279
Okay, big mouth's gone. What's the deal?

193
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,558
Out.

194
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,811
How is this going to work?

195
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:44,565
Like a pinhole camera
to view an eclipse.

196
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,585
We position the ring here.

197
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:49,933
And let the light pass through.

198
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:52,896
- Hit the switch.
- Okay.

199
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:09,494
Here.

200
00:11:39,788 --> 00:11:41,558
<i>This map isn't very detailed.</i>

201
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:44,894
<i>I can't tell if we've passed
Route 12 yet. There's no signs for it.</i>

202
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:47,188
<i>She must be my mother.</i>

203
00:11:49,612 --> 00:11:50,859
I look so much like her.

204
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:52,337
Who else could she be?

205
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:53,948
I wish Adam was alive.

206
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:55,905
He would know.

207
00:11:58,104 --> 00:11:59,776
Do you think she's still alive?

208
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:02,920
I mean, if she is,
then I'd have somebody.

209
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:05,330
There'd be someone like me.

210
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:10,715
I'm like you.

211
00:12:24,263 --> 00:12:25,685
What's wrong?

212
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:50,710
Well, well, well.

213
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:53,421
The young lovebirds return.

214
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:03,227
Still sneaking around? Huh?

215
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:04,891
Still the happy couple?

216
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:08,811
- You... You know us?
- Of course I know you.

217
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:12,315
You used to hole up in that
booth over there for hours.

218
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:15,318
I'm sorry. We're just a little confused.

219
00:13:15,555 --> 00:13:18,613
It's not you. My grandfather
gets mixed up sometimes.

220
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,199
I don't get mixed up.
He's grilled cheese, chocolate shake.

221
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:23,687
She's Cobb salad, cheery cola.

222
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,281
Grandpa, these people
just remind you of someone.

223
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:28,625
He can't tell you what day it is,

224
00:13:28,745 --> 00:13:31,167
but he remembers his customers'
orders from years ago.

225
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:33,461
She Could Be You.

226
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:36,192
- What?
- The two of you

227
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,924
used to play that song all the time.

228
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:40,294
Why don't you folks have a seat?

229
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:41,928
Come on. I'll cut you some pie.

230
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:44,467
- I don't want any pie.
- Come on.

231
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:05,201
- What is it?
- Third row, fourth one down.

232
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:10,934
D4.

233
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:13,184
Do you have a quarter?

234
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:30,518
It's not there.

235
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:31,879
Where are you?

236
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:33,848
<i>In a diner somewhere with Jessi.</i>

237
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,273
You found her?

238
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,776
Yes. Are the Tragers okay?

239
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:41,204
Not exactly.
Lori's pissed that you went after Jessi,

240
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:43,031
and apparently
your parents are fighting.

241
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,652
About what?

242
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:46,472
<i>My best guess would be you.</i>

243
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,454
Has Foss been around?

244
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:52,248
I asked him to watch over the family.

245
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:55,209
Then knowing him,
he's probably listening right now.

246
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:58,365
<i>Listen, you'd better get back here.</i>

247
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:00,209
<i>I can't yet.</i>

248
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:03,480
They're gonna want
answers when you get home,

249
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:04,796
I gotta go.

250
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:07,138
Was that Kyle?

251
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,103
He's with her right now, isn't he?

252
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,271
Look, I'm feeling kind of
caught in the middle here.

253
00:15:15,977 --> 00:15:18,816
Then free yourself
and tell me what's going on.

254
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:22,028
I should go.

255
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:27,223
Okay. Chocolate shake,

256
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,353
cherry cola.

257
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:29,452
What did I tell you?

258
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:31,140
It sounded good.

259
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:34,248
So what are you doing around here?

260
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:36,334
Looking for Route 12.

261
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,871
Route 12.

262
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:40,963
A flood washed that out years ago.

263
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,310
What would you want to do up there?

264
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:44,717
Just exploring.

265
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,261
Well, there's not much to explore.

266
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:48,846
It's pretty isolated.

267
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:51,229
I'd be careful.

268
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:00,598
What if there is nothing there?

269
00:16:03,143 --> 00:16:05,571
There has to be. Otherwise,
Foss wouldn't send us.

270
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:08,533
You're worried.

271
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:15,331
When I get home, I have
to tell my family everything.

272
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:17,269
We don't have to go back.

273
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:21,462
We can find Route 12,
see what's there, and keep going.

274
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,006
I want to go back.

275
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:25,792
Why?

276
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,178
They're everything to me.

277
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,739
You...

278
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:40,690
have people you care about
and who care about you.

279
00:16:46,478 --> 00:16:47,530
Yes.

280
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:51,703
I do.

281
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,346
You realize we're doing this
without a warrant.

282
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:03,691
Everything incriminating
will not be held against him.

283
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:05,141
At least for now.

284
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:11,142
Socks in the desk?

285
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,429
And porn under the mattress.

286
00:17:18,097 --> 00:17:19,896
Ah. Got it.

287
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,562
One prays for moments like this.

288
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:31,824
Who'd like to go first?

289
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:33,868
Give us a free pass on this one.

290
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:35,611
I think not.

291
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:37,455
What do you want with my Kyle file?

292
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:40,208
We just need to borrow it for a while.

293
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:42,736
Why?

294
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,047
Enough with that.
Why are you skulking around?

295
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:47,623
Yeah. Skulking's my job.

296
00:17:47,746 --> 00:17:49,750
Don't mess with the balance of nature.

297
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,429
Seriously, if there's something
going on with Kyle, I wanna know.

298
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:55,346
Well, the truth is...

299
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:57,571
the situation does concern all of us.

300
00:17:58,138 --> 00:18:00,478
There's a... situation?

301
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,856
All right, we'll tell you what we know.

302
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:06,137
No more secrets?

303
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:10,785
No more secrets.

304
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,683
What's in the box?

305
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:22,439
What?

306
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:25,598
I saw you with her,
and then I opened the box.

307
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:27,815
You were inside my mind.

308
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:29,791
You got into mine.

309
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:32,445
I guess it works for both of us.

310
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,113
But how did you do it?
We weren't even touching.

311
00:19:38,532 --> 00:19:40,661
You seemed lost in thought. I just...

312
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,582
concentrated.

313
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:55,176
They want me to get what you
have locked in your brain.

314
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:59,472
That's what Emily told me. She said
once they have it, I can be free.

315
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:01,654
Jessi, that information,
it could be dangerous.

316
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,917
- We can't give it to them.
- If I got into your head,

317
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,978
what makes you think I won't take it?

318
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:07,772
Because I choose to trust you.

319
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,823
I've done terrible things.

320
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:22,722
Leave me here.

321
00:20:23,803 --> 00:20:25,008
What?

322
00:20:25,193 --> 00:20:27,541
I don't belong with someone like you.

323
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:30,127
You should go on without me.

324
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:51,652
You scratched that in.

325
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:54,735
Grandpa, it's okay.

326
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:57,863
You never came back after that.

327
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:01,409
Not till today.

328
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:04,889
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:12,201
What was that about?

330
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:14,562
I don't know.

331
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:18,091
But it's part of our history.

332
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:21,971
We have to find out.

333
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:26,107
Whatever happens,

334
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:28,310
we're in this together.

335
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:35,635
This is like a Kyle convention.

336
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,259
Kyle 101.

337
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,792
A symposium on all things Kyle.

338
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:42,368
- Kyle-a-con.
- Be serious.

339
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:44,009
Oh, I've been serious,

340
00:21:44,132 --> 00:21:45,681
and all of you mocked me.

341
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:48,214
But now you want to study my evidence.

342
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,033
Just give us the file.

343
00:21:50,365 --> 00:21:52,959
Every time something unusual
happened concerning Kyle,

344
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:55,381
we managed to explain it or overlook it.

345
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,132
- All these incidents have to add up.
- To what?

346
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:00,050
That's what we're here to figure out.

347
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:11,812
- What do you want?
- Kyle told me you'd be around.

348
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:14,982
I think the family start
to put things together.

349
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:16,516
Yeah, I heard.

350
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:18,444
What if they find out the truth?

351
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:21,363
Well, they would, eventually.

352
00:22:22,664 --> 00:22:24,102
It won't matter anyway.

353
00:22:24,324 --> 00:22:26,463
They'd never turn their backs on Kyle.

354
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:29,622
We haven't.

355
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:33,569
Unless they found out
that he's been lying to them.

356
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:37,429
- They'll never forgive him.
- What is he supposed to do?

357
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:39,974
Well, it was a nice setup
while it lasted, but...

358
00:22:40,748 --> 00:22:43,093
once he gets back,
he'll have to move on.

359
00:22:47,674 --> 00:22:48,724
Whatever.

360
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:59,310
This can't lead anywhere,

361
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:00,778
not anymore.

362
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:03,447
We're here. We might
as well check it out.

363
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:05,460
How far are we supposed to go?

364
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,489
As far as we can.

365
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:13,332
You really believe, don't you?

366
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:17,338
I don't know if we'll find anything,

367
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:18,899
but we might.

368
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:21,382
I mean, there's a chance.

369
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:23,262
There's hope.

370
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:36,823
I make things happen.

371
00:23:38,545 --> 00:23:39,794
Strange things,

372
00:23:39,914 --> 00:23:42,529
when I'm angry or upset.

373
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:45,332
Like what?

374
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,971
I made lights explode.

375
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:52,623
I shattered a skylight.

376
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:54,000
You did?

377
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:55,807
Not intentionally.

378
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:58,217
How do we do that?

379
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:02,225
It has to do with harnessing energy
and projecting it to the outside world.

380
00:24:03,065 --> 00:24:04,746
And they made us this way,

381
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:06,627
the people who created us?

382
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,750
Being in the pod gave our brains
more time to develop.

383
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:13,392
Are we the only ones?

384
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:15,569
As far as I know.

385
00:24:16,557 --> 00:24:18,522
I thought I was the only one
until you came along.

386
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,352
Competition.

387
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:22,318
I don't think of it that way.

388
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:23,911
Maybe you should.

389
00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:26,604
Maybe I'm smarter...

390
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:28,629
stronger...

391
00:24:29,587 --> 00:24:30,669
faster.

392
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,414
The results of his MRI when
I first took him on as a patient

393
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:37,911
showed an unprecedented
amount of brain activity,

394
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:41,095
but the second MRI,
months later, was normal.

395
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:43,259
He sleeps in a tub.

396
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:45,161
Let's start with that.

397
00:24:45,348 --> 00:24:48,135
And I think we can scratch "normal"
off our Kyle adjective list.

398
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:50,596
I'm less concerned about
his idiosyncrasies than I am

399
00:24:50,716 --> 00:24:53,349
about some of the more disturbing things
he's been involved with.

400
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:57,478
He was found wandering near
Kearn's skeleton. Professor Kearn...

401
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:01,398
taught at U-Dub, where he mentored
a student named Adam Baylin.

402
00:25:01,692 --> 00:25:02,942
Who looked just like Kyle.

403
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:04,652
And kidnapped him, raising him

404
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:07,071
for five years
until he committed suicide.

405
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:10,658
And he comes to us with no memory
of any of this until his parents

406
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,743
suddenly show up,
and he leaves with them.

407
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:14,883
They're dead.

408
00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:17,281
Dad, you're creeping me out.

409
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:19,375
Remember that basketball game

410
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,211
where he scored all those
awesome half-court jumpers?

411
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,342
Okay, a bunch of people died.

412
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:29,109
But it's not like Kyle's responsible.

413
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,319
But they're all connected to him.

414
00:25:33,322 --> 00:25:35,170
He didn't sleep for over a week.

415
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:36,961
He jumped off our roof.

416
00:25:37,081 --> 00:25:39,061
He predicted lightning, an earthquake.

417
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:40,755
There are pages of this.

418
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:43,892
And don't forget, he drew a picture
of my father's living room perfectly

419
00:25:44,012 --> 00:25:45,815
even though he'd never been there.

420
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:48,762
No one should be able to do
any of these things, and yet Kyle

421
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:49,988
has done all of them.

422
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,529
Because he's incredible.

423
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:54,785
He's amazing.

424
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:58,789
You're acting like he's done something
wrong, like he's some sort of freak.

425
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:01,041
We're just trying to make
sense of what's happened.

426
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:03,127
Don't put him on trial
before he gets home.

427
00:26:04,043 --> 00:26:05,587
Give him a chance to explain.

428
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,716
That's what you do for me and Lori
when you think we screwed up.

429
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,355
Seriously, Josh, when you hear
all this stuff together, it sounds so

430
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,113
wild and weird.

431
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:16,807
When you think about it, what
do we really know about Kyle?

432
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:18,976
I know. Who is he?

433
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,857
What are you talking about?

434
00:26:21,952 --> 00:26:22,980
He's our brother.

435
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:28,318
He's your son.

436
00:26:31,942 --> 00:26:32,969
Anyhow,

437
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:35,133
I'm not doing this anymore.

438
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:55,027
Who'd live all the way out here?

439
00:26:57,461 --> 00:26:59,784
I think it may be somebody
who's expecting us.

440
00:27:18,485 --> 00:27:21,080
- You can't walk into someone's house.
- I can.

441
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,748
Hello?

442
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:34,187
Is anyone here?

443
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:45,328
Are we in the right place?

444
00:27:45,844 --> 00:27:46,963
I think so.

445
00:27:59,247 --> 00:28:00,612
I know this book.

446
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:13,227
It's in Hungarian.

447
00:28:22,854 --> 00:28:23,899
Dad.

448
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,669
Yeah.

449
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:29,822
I know you didn't do anything.

450
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:33,437
I know you love Mom.

451
00:28:33,622 --> 00:28:35,687
I should have never doubted you.

452
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:37,906
I'm so sorry.

453
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:42,188
Sweetie.

454
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,997
Thank you for apologizing.

455
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:49,601
I don't know how much longer
we should wait to go after him.

456
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:56,117
We don't know where he is.

457
00:28:56,253 --> 00:28:58,244
- Why don't you try his cell?
- I just did.

458
00:28:58,367 --> 00:28:59,720
He's still not picking up.

459
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,792
I know he was talking to Declan earlier,

460
00:29:01,912 --> 00:29:03,640
but he wouldn't tell me anything.

461
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:05,817
You think Declan has something to tell?

462
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:09,714
He was Mood Swing Central when
Kyle left with the Petersons, and...

463
00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:11,773
he only got worse when Kyle came back.

464
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:15,444
This spot in the woods.

465
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,988
Declan went with Kyle,
and they followed these coordinates.

466
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:20,240
The numbers Kyle kept
repeating under hypnosis.

467
00:29:23,783 --> 00:29:25,651
That place in the woods.

468
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:27,706
It could be the same.

469
00:29:28,785 --> 00:29:30,077
Same as what?

470
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:34,796
We didn't tell you guys,

471
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:39,464
but we went to the woods
about a month ago near Victor Falls,

472
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:43,305
and there were these freaky
underground tunnels we got stuck in.

473
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:44,692
Tunnels?

474
00:29:45,061 --> 00:29:46,600
Like a bomb shelter.

475
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:48,602
Kyle said there was
nothing there but trees.

476
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,216
Oh, believe me, there's something there,

477
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:54,529
and Kyle really did not
want us to go... Kyle and Declan.

478
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,172
Doesn't seem like anyone
stayed here in a while.

479
00:30:04,098 --> 00:30:05,336
Is that a closet?

480
00:30:12,283 --> 00:30:13,488
We didn't check.

481
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,996
I think we just found what we came for.

482
00:30:55,007 --> 00:30:56,335
How do we get in?

483
00:31:06,712 --> 00:31:08,741
There are a million
possible combinations.

484
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:11,470
It's like a song.

485
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:15,835
The song.

486
00:31:17,003 --> 00:31:18,073
D4.

487
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:20,236
The song in the juke box?

488
00:31:20,384 --> 00:31:21,945
And from the back of the picture.

489
00:31:22,154 --> 00:31:23,298
That has to be it.

490
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:27,332
Well, even if it is,
we don't know how to play it.

491
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:30,454
I know someone who will.

492
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:32,748
- Where are you?
- <i>It's hard to explain.</i>

493
00:31:33,454 --> 00:31:34,458
I need your help.

494
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,126
Sure. What's up?

495
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,211
Do you know a song
called She Could Be You?

496
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:40,255
No. Never heard of it.

497
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:42,799
Do you think you could look it up
and play the melody?

498
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:44,176
Kyle, what's this about?

499
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:47,928
I'm trying to figure something out.
That song could be the key.

500
00:31:48,063 --> 00:31:49,389
Tell her it's important.

501
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,766
Are you with Jessi?

502
00:31:54,702 --> 00:31:55,729
Yes.

503
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,148
You call me for help,
and you're out somewhere with her?

504
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,151
- Amanda, I...
- That's completely inappropriate.

505
00:32:01,473 --> 00:32:03,070
I wish I could tell you why.

506
00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:05,506
Give it a shot.

507
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,526
<i>All I can say is I'll never
do anything to betray you.</i>

508
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:13,789
<i>You know I wouldn't ask you for this
if it wasn't something I really needed.</i>

509
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:18,168
You know how much I care about you.

510
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:24,549
Give me a few minutes.

511
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:30,555
Got your message.

512
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:32,541
What's going on?

513
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:35,479
We need you to tell us
about that place in the woods.

514
00:32:36,857 --> 00:32:38,099
What place?

515
00:32:39,205 --> 00:32:41,024
I've already told them about that night.

516
00:32:41,357 --> 00:32:43,201
We're not fooling around here.

517
00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:46,890
Mr. Trager, I wish I could help,
but I don't know anything about it.

518
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:49,270
We're concerned about Kyle, Declan,

519
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,869
and you seem to be involved in a lot of
things we try to understand about him.

520
00:32:57,212 --> 00:32:59,418
Like I said, I wish I could help.

521
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:01,519
- That's it.
- What are you doing?

522
00:33:01,642 --> 00:33:03,689
Something I should have done.
Calling the cops.

523
00:33:03,818 --> 00:33:04,950
Wait. Don't do that.

524
00:33:05,122 --> 00:33:06,591
Why shouldn't he?

525
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:10,011
Don't call the police.

526
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:13,890
Not if you care about Kyle.

527
00:33:14,068 --> 00:33:16,268
- Get the hell out of my house.
- Mr. Trager, it's okay.

528
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:20,397
He's looked out for Kyle
from the beginning.

529
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,474
He's a friend.

530
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,129
You know what's going on.

531
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,155
You lied. You've been lying.

532
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:30,574
- I've been trying to protect Kyle.
- From what?

533
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:34,161
I don't want to hear
your crap anymore. Get out.

534
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:36,830
Get out!

535
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:40,029
Please,

536
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:41,997
listen to him.

537
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:53,050
Okay.

538
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:55,030
I found the music online.

539
00:33:55,654 --> 00:33:57,309
- You ready?
- I'm listening.

540
00:34:31,782 --> 00:34:32,969
Is that what you needed?

541
00:34:34,696 --> 00:34:35,983
That's perfect.

542
00:34:37,496 --> 00:34:38,516
Thank you, Amanda.

543
00:34:41,258 --> 00:34:42,389
You're welcome.

544
00:34:45,327 --> 00:34:46,778
I'm leaving tomorrow.

545
00:34:48,143 --> 00:34:49,694
Will you be back to say good-bye?

546
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:53,025
I wanna be.

547
00:35:06,573 --> 00:35:07,587
She played it?

548
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:09,881
Yes.

549
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:33,196
You were right.

550
00:35:34,413 --> 00:35:35,606
Wait.

551
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,064
No matter what we find,

552
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:42,577
you've done a lot for me,
and I wanna thank you.

553
00:35:43,437 --> 00:35:44,630
You don't need to.

554
00:35:45,134 --> 00:35:46,634
You've made me feel safe,

555
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:49,296
and you've given me hope.

556
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:26,556
Who is he?

557
00:36:27,528 --> 00:36:28,585
Adam Baylin.

558
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,599
I thought you said Adam Baylin was dead.

559
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:45,183
I scattered his ashes.

560
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:48,245
I guess they weren't his.

561
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:53,026
Why would they make me believe that...

562
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:57,697
<i>I'm sure that you have questions,</i>

563
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:00,555
but Kyle should answer them.

564
00:37:00,675 --> 00:37:02,597
No. You tell me now.

565
00:37:03,298 --> 00:37:06,556
Last time I saw you, Brian Taylor
had you locked up in a room at Madacorp.

566
00:37:07,282 --> 00:37:08,302
Why?

567
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:11,679
- We had a disagreement.
- What kind of answer is that?

568
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,984
All I can tell you
is Kyle's done nothing wrong.

569
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:16,091
You were our security guard,

570
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:19,719
but Declan said you looked out for Kyle.
What did he mean?

571
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:23,530
That means...

572
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:27,894
I've known him since he was a child.

573
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:34,780
He's been through a lot.

574
00:37:36,883 --> 00:37:38,822
And he's very special,
but you already know that.

575
00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:42,564
- Do you know where he is?
- I think so.

576
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:45,412
He's asked me to stay around
to look after your family.

577
00:37:47,678 --> 00:37:48,907
All he's...

578
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:51,751
ever wanted...

579
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,254
was to be a part of your family.

580
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:56,589
To Kyle, this is home.

581
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,866
Well, I can take care of my family.

582
00:38:07,796 --> 00:38:09,407
It's time for you to go.

583
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,606
And bring our son home.

584
00:38:27,321 --> 00:38:28,913
He knows I'm here.

585
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:38,882
I think we can communicate with him.
I've done it before.

586
00:38:39,629 --> 00:38:42,760
We can pick up the electrical impulses
in his brain, just like the monitor.

587
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:45,339
No.

588
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:47,621
I don't want to.

589
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:49,672
Okay.

590
00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:52,305
I'll try.

591
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:04,157
I really don't wanna talk.

592
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,719
Then just listen.

593
00:39:10,909 --> 00:39:12,499
I know it's been a strange day.

594
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:14,831
It's been a strange year.

595
00:39:15,531 --> 00:39:18,505
And remembering all the things that
have happened since Kyle's been with us,

596
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:21,174
and knowing he's connected
to Jessi in some way

597
00:39:21,294 --> 00:39:22,509
and the...

598
00:39:23,036 --> 00:39:24,758
trouble that's caused us...

599
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,517
I just want to tell all of you
that I'm sorry.

600
00:39:30,772 --> 00:39:32,641
You're sorry? What for?

601
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:34,771
I'm the one that brought
them both into this house.

602
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,182
That's not your fault.

603
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,619
I was just so taken with Kyle, and I...

604
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:41,569
I accepted things
that didn't make sense,

605
00:39:43,086 --> 00:39:44,242
and I allowed

606
00:39:44,427 --> 00:39:46,199
wanting to protect him
to come between us.

607
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:50,370
I am so sorry, Stephen.

608
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:56,500
It's okay.

609
00:39:57,597 --> 00:39:59,245
We can get through anything,

610
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:00,720
remember?

611
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:11,266
This isn't one of those
group hug moments, is it?

612
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,644
- Josh, you were right before.
- I was?

613
00:40:14,893 --> 00:40:17,217
When we said we didn't know
who Kyle really is.

614
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:21,225
We know who he is.
He's part of our family.

615
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:23,935
When he comes back, he'll explain.

616
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:27,328
So does that mean you're not
going to call the cops?

617
00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:29,701
Hopefully, I won't have a reason to.

618
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:31,902
So what do we do now?

619
00:40:33,021 --> 00:40:34,976
We wait for Kyle to come home.

620
00:40:47,074 --> 00:40:48,795
Is he communicating with you?

621
00:40:53,738 --> 00:40:55,768
I think he's trying,
but I'm not getting anything.

622
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:00,523
Will you help me?

623
00:41:04,116 --> 00:41:05,320
I don't know how.

624
00:41:06,538 --> 00:41:08,156
Don't be afraid.

625
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,589
Open your mind.

626
00:41:26,228 --> 00:41:27,091
And focus.

627
00:41:40,306 --> 00:41:42,940
<i>I need to know why
our journey had led us here.</i>

628
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,526
<i>Hoping Adam would guide us forward,</i>

629
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:47,536
<i>I cleared my mind and opened my heart,</i>

630
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:49,048
<i>trying to connect with him,</i>

631
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:51,407
<i>strengthening the pathway
with Jessi's help.</i>

632
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:56,449
<i>While focused on Adam, I felt
all the barriers between us slip away,</i>

633
00:41:56,843 --> 00:41:58,908
<i>then a powerful exchange of energy</i>

634
00:41:59,056 --> 00:42:01,501
<i>as Jessi reached into my mind
and connected with me.</i>

635
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,590
<i>Kyle, stop. She's betrayed you.</i>

636
00:42:18,055 --> 00:42:19,395
Jessi, wait!

637
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:47,866
Why are you running?

638
00:42:48,812 --> 00:42:50,967
I did it. I got into your head.

639
00:42:51,184 --> 00:42:55,054
When you tried to connect with Baylin,
I took what they wanted me to.

640
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,754
The information.

641
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,350
Why did you take it?

642
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:00,893
I couldn't help myself.

643
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:04,564
You shouldn't have trusted me.

644
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,443
No!

645
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,789
