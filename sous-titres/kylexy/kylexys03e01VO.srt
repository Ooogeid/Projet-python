**********

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,070
When you first came here,
everything in the world was new.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,290
Look at all you've learned.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,650
Look at all you've overcome.

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,090
Tonight's a celebration of that.

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,630
Just breathe and enjoy it.

7
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,570
Don't use this.

8
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,130
You don't want me to have safe sex?

9
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,990
I do want you to have safe sex, but
I don't want you to have sex at all.

10
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,080
I really wanted to have
sex with you tonight.

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,950
I just don't think we should.

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,040
Losing my virginity on prom night is
the most clich? of all things clich?

13
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,380
This song is written by someone who
knows a lot more about who she is

14
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,890
and what life's all about
than she will ever admit.

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,300
I don't know where you stand with me, or
with what we're supposed to be or not be,

16
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,060
but it's in your hands.

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,820
I think that means we
shouldn't be together.

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,420
I think we should leave seattle.

19
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,590
- Where would we go?
- Somewhere. Anywhere else.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,580
I'm gonna miss you, jessi.

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,640
No, you're not.

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,040
Because no matter where I
am, we're always connected.

23
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,120
The people in latnok aren't bad.

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,310
They're simply scientists with
a very clinical point of view.

25
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,610
He's incredible.

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,330
I think it's time we
introduce ourselves.

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,860
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,630
Oh, I left my other clothes inside.

29
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,480
I'll get them.

30
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,600
- Got everything you need?
- I do now.

31
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,500
Amanda?

32
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,100
Put him under.

33
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,980
Amanda...

34
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,370
Though we like to believe
we have control of our lives,

35
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,320
in a single moment,
everything can change.

36
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:54,330
My night of celebration had suddenly
turned, leaving me afraid and confused.

37
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,940
I was trapped.

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,260
And the only thing on my
mind was "where was amanda?"

39

42
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,550
Oh, the pain.

43
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,110
Broken heart, broken feet.

44
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,920
Broken heart?

45
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,000
She dumped declan.

46
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,650
Dumped is inaccurate. We weren't
an official couple anymore.

47
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,730
What happened?

48
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,150
Let's just say he very graciously
gave me the opportunity to move on.

49
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,720
Which I took.

50
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,170
Really.

51
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,010
I'm going to sleep.

52
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,020
What about the after-party?

53
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,630
Give my regards to andy
and the dimple twins.

54
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,270
Where are kyle and amanda?

55
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,100
They went straight to the hotel,

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,190
which would sound a whole lot
hotter for any other couple.

57
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Wait a minute, what about
you? How was your night?

58
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,950
Dad, I have to swap
clothes and meet andy.

59
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,180
I know, but anything...
exciting to report?

60
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,550
If you're asking me about that...

61
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,500
candy bar you gave me, no worries.

62
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,540
It's still in the wrapper.

63
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,710
Josh, I know your
father gave you a condom.

64
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,720
Is there nothing sacred in this house?

65
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,770
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

66
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,290
But since we're on the subject...

67
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,330
rest assured, nothing remotely
life-altering awaits me at the after-party.

68
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,660
Even kyle's got a better
shot at some excitement.

69
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,400
I couldn't search for amanda.

70
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,070
So I listened for her heartbeat.

71
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,870
But I could only hear
voices talking about me.

72
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,950
He's non-responsive.

73
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,710
Tell them he's ready
to begin the procedure.

74
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,330
Brutus! Come here! Come here!

75
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,000
How did you do that?

76
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,370
It's just a dog.

77
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,670
I hope he, uh, I hope he
didn't send you packing.

78
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,430
All the barking. It's a new
place. He gets kind of jittery.

79
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,090
No, we didn't hear
anything. We're just leaving.

80
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,720
We?

81
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,940
Uh, me and my mother.

82
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,540
You and your mom. Cool.

83
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,860
Vacation or...

84
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,690
incredibly nosy. I'm so sorry.

85
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,320
Well, my laundry awaits,
so I'm gonna get back to it.

86
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,490
Cool.

87
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,900
When's a good time to us the machine?

88
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,750
The washing machine.

89
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,900
After midnight.

90
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,090
Good to know. Cool.

91
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,770
Have a good night.

92
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,730
You too.

93
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,460
You know, we could
just hang out at home.

94
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,510
This is all part of the
post-prom experience.

95
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,180
Ok, just don't act all excited
and weird. Try to fit in.

96
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,380
How hard can that be?

97
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,560
Is it hot in here?

98
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,750
Like the surface of the sun.

99
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,560
Maybe we should just surrender
and rip off all our clothes.

100
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,970
- Grapefruit.
- What?

101
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,300
Nothing.

102
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,340
G-force is the answer.

103
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,080
Come here.

104
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,130
Keep. It. Together.

105
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,470
Wardrobe change. Much more comfortable.

106
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,870
Are you ready for pome bubbly?

107
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,990
Where'd you get that?

108
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:03,180
Compliments of the caterer, in exchange for
a five-star review of his bistro on my blog.

109
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,660
You know, trager hates champagne.

110
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,810
It makes her nose tickle.

111
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,990
Which is... actually kind of cute.

112
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,870
But I shouldn't be
thinking about that, right?

113
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,900
I should be bouncing back.

114
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,660
Bounce away, most definitely.

115
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,990
I should be having fun.

116
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,000
Mindless fun, that is the goal.

117
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,240
What should we toast to?

118
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,620
To hangovers.

119
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,120
- Is that everything?
- Yeah.

120
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,800
I guess everything I
own fits in one bag.

121
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,200
It's good to travel light.

122
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,690
Jessi? What is it?

123
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,080
I don't know. I think there's
something wrong with kyle.

124
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,770
You're just anxious about leaving.

125
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,580
No, he's in trouble. I can feel it.

126
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,910
Jessi.

127
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,940
I know this is hard
and scary. For me, too.

128
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,740
You're gonna feel better
once we get on the road.

129
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,080
I can't leave.

130
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,390
We have to get away from all this,
jessi. We have to start our new life.

131
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,010
Not until I see him.

132
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,790
Please get in the car.

133
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,400
No.

134
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,560
I'll be back.

135
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,300
Get him!

136
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,850
There's nowhere to run.

137
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,390
Get him!

138
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,620
Faster, josh. Don't stop.

139
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,610
Almost there, almost...

140
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,070
Lost it.

141
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,540
Hey, I was hitting that little
button as fast as I could.

142
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,440
You gotta keep hitting that, trager.

143
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,950
It sounds gross when you
"trager" me. Please don'T.

144
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,410
We need more whipped cream.

145
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,690
Whipped cream, huh?

146
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,540
Looks like your night's
going good, trager.

147
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,410
The whipped cream, unfortunately,
is destined for the sundaes.

148
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,400
How come?

149
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,200
My prom night's turned
out to be totally g-rated.

150
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,600
And you were hoping for an R.

151
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,850
At least.

152
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,290
I want to... you know,
badly. Really, really badly.

153
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,930
And sometimes I think she does too,
because she says these things...

154
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,080
so what's the problem?

155
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:20,320
In a moment of colossal stupidity, I
panicked and told her I'm not ready for sex.

156
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,500
But now...

157
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,790
you want to know how to proceed?

158
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,700
Here's what you do.
Forget about tonight.

159
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,760
You killed the mood, torpedoed your own sub,
kicked the lock shut on her chastity belt.

160
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,360
What are you talking about?

161
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,490
Was that even advice?

162
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,970
The truth hurts. Later, trager.

163
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,160
Dude, quit saying that!

164
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:01,730
I hoped that somehow amanda was home, that
she hadn't been part of what happened to me.

165
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,730
I couldn't hear amanda's heartbeat.

166
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,560
I had to check her room to
know for sure she wasn't there.

167
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,700
I come bearing chamomile.

168
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,950
I thought it might help you sleep.

169
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,970
You just poured me a cup downstairs.

170
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,880
Mom, you don't need an
excuse to come check on me.

171
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,880
Too obvious? So?

172
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm fine.

173
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,690
I mean, I know life with
declan has been a total seesaw.

174
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,330
But it's finally really over.

175
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,800
And I can never go back to him.

176
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,050
And I don't want to. I don't think.

177
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,910
Did I just make a huge mistake?

178
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,770
Declan's been your safety net,
and it's scary to be on your own.

179
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,180
Actually, I kind of
already like somebody else.

180
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,760
Who?

181
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,600
- Kyle?
- Kyle?

182
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,740
She wasn't in her room, and I told
mrs. Bloom she'd be home by 3:00.

183
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,060
What if latnok took her?

184
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,640
What are you doing?

185
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,970
I'm calling the police.

186
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,410
Mom, and tell them what?

187
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,500
Amanda is missing.

188
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,080
And how is that conversation gonna go?

189
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,430
Oh, hi, 911? My adopted son,
the one with no bellybutton?

190
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,020
I think his prom date was abducted.

191
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,160
I see your point.

192
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:25,930
I can't just sit here.

193
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,510
Any place she might have gone?

194
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,870
We were going to the after-party. I
don't think she'd leave without me.

195
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,870
- We should still check.
- Josh is there.

196
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,580
- Let's not involve him just yet.
- I'll go.

197
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,620
Even if amanda's not there, I
can ask if somebody saw anything.

198
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,980
- Thank you.
- We'll find her.

199
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,800
- My phone...
- you left it here.

200
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,630
It's a text from amanda.

201
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,680
Latnok.

202
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,100
They have her.

203
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:07,880
Where are you going?

204
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,020
To check out that building.

205
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,460
- I'll go with you.
- We both will.

206
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,310
No.

207
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:47,210
I returned to the building where they
had kept me, expecting to find amanda.

208
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:54,120
I didn't know who I'd come up against, but I was
prepared to do whatever was necessary to save her.

209
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,560
But she wasn't there.

210
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,570
Everything...

211
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,230
and everyone...

212
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,200
was gone.

213
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,140
Jessi?

214
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,390
Amanda?

215
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,110
Has anyone seen amanda bloom?

216
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,650
Has anyone seen amanda bloom?

217
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,570
Sweet blonde girl, probably the
one assigning designated drivers.

218
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,850
So you came after all.

219
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,070
If you were already feeling like a loser,
probably should have re-thunk the outfit.

220
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,990
Ignoring you. Have
you seen amanda around?

221
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,270
Yeah, she's been doing jell-o shots
and swinging on a stripper's pole.

222
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,200
- No, why?
- Is something wrong?

223
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,630
Oh, no. God, no. Carry on.

224
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,280
This shampoo smells like her hair.

225
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,990
What are the chances that trager's
shampoo would be in this hotel?

226
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,150
Damn this shampoo, it's mocking me!

227
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,450
Nugget, that is generic hotel shampoo.

228
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,780
Definitely not something
lori trager would use.

229
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,850
And this is exactly why I can't
allow you to wallow in here alone.

230
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,090
There's room for two.

231
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,740
Get up and let's go back to the party.

232
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,270
Don't think so!

233
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,030
There's bubble bath.

234
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,320
Not in this dress, muffin.

235
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,800
Sorry.

236
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,340
Carol.

237
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:08,560
I'm next door at the tragers, so if you cannot
reach me on my cell then try calling me here.

238
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,730
Do you have any idea what time it is?

239
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,890
 Almost 1:00?

240
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:18,460
Oh, yes. You say that so calmly, as if your
children are commonly out until all hours.

241
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,890
Well, it is prom night.

242
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,120
I understand that, but amanda said she would check
in at midnight and I have not heard from her yet.

243
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,430
I've been calling and calling,
and she doesn't answer.

244
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,260
Well, everyone's at the after-party.

245
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,880
 It's probably so loud
she can't hear her phone.

246
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,830
What after-party? Where is that?

247
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,540
- why?
- Why?

248
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,930
Because I have to go there.

249
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,020
No, carol, no. I mean, please.

250
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,580
We're talking about kyle and amanda.

251
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,400
We don't have anything to worry aboet.

252
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,000
Let the kids have thir fun.

253
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,150
I understand that you are very
loose with your children, nicole,

254
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,510
but I need to see for myself exactly
what kind of fun they are having.

255
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,010
But stephen and I would love it
if you would stay here with us.

256
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,010
With us?

257
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,210
Cf course. We're waiting up, too.

258
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,690
In fact, we were just about
to crack open a bottle of wine.

259
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,510
Carol, red or white?
What's your pleasure?

260
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,250
You know, I don't partake... ordinarily.

261
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,160
But yes, I do think a little
something just to help calm my nerves.

262
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,790
Nice shiraz would be divine.

263
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,450
Jessi, I don't want you getting nvolved.

264
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,550
Well, it's too late.

265
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,130
Besides, how many
times have you saved me?

266
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,510
I owe you a few.

267
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,770
Where would they have taken her?

268
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,060
Why would they want her?

269
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,000
It's all we've got, and I can't wait
around for them to contact me again.

270
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,070
- What... trace her cell.
- It's turned off.

271
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,810
Wait, you already know
when this message was sent.

272
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,330
And I know what time we left the prom.

273
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,660
Assuming they took amanda straight
rom the school to where she is...

274
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,890
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

275
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,590
A radial tracking map.

276
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,040
Lori trager.

277
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,120
Hey, did you see amanda
after the... Wait.

278
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,860
Am I in your cell?
Have you programmed me?

279
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,530
Uh, what did you say about amanda?

280
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,120
Did you see her and kyle after the prom?

281
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,650
Yeah, he came into the gym and grabbed
something. I didn't see her. No, why?

282
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,320
She borrowed my lip gloss.

283
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,620
Well, this is an emergency.

284
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,560
You must need it for the after-party.

285
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,290
- Actually, I'd rather be home.
- Home?

286
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,730
Or you know... somewhere.

287
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,100
Somewhere... where?

288
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,520
I gotta go.

289
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,490
Booze is just a band-aid
for a broken heart.

290
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,840
What you need is a hot
and sweaty mack session.

291
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,550
- With who?
- Who cares?

292
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,100
As long as she's the anti-lori trager.

293
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,800
So just go out there, find a girl...

294
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,490
preferably a hot one.

295
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,040
But with your beer
goggles it may not matter.

296
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:23,110
Find her, and grab her,
and just rebound. Simple.

297
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,380
Simple.

298
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,890
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

299
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,690
No! No... he's drunk and I got wet.

300
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,040
That's ok. Stop there.
Uh, have you seen amanda?

301
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,270
Best guess, she's with kyle.

302
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,420
Not so much, no.

303
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,310
I can help you look.

304
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,400
No, that's ok. Go back
to your bathroom fiesta.

305
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,580
Lori!

306
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,960
Here's beachwood high.

307
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,160
If their best speed through
the city was 30 miles an hour,

308
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,040
this is the rthest
they could have traveled.

309
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,780
Right.

310
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,100
We need to narrow it down.

311
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,010
Looks like the back wall is curved.

312
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,530
Maybe it's some sort of round building?

313
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,020
Here, play the sound.

314
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,280
Is that a foghorn?

315
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,780
I can make it louder.

316
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,900
What's that popping noise?

317
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,120
A train.

318
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,600
It's not a foghorn. It's a train
horn at a railroad crossing.

319
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,350
If we can find that, we can find her.

320
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,450
That's 350 points fob carol. I guess
that makes you the winner. Again.

321
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,220
I would have never taken
you two for word buzzers.

322
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,240
Shall we play again?

323
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,010
I think I'm all buzzed out.

324
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,920
Hello?

325
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,760
I haven't found her
but I need your hel.

326
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,890
Can you log on to view-it earth?

327
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,890
Hang on.

328
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,290
Who on earth would be
calling at this hour?

329
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,830
Work.

330
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,920
We need a cylindrical building,
maybe some sort of silo,

331
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,880
within 200 feet of the railroad tracks,
and somewhere between cedar and blanchard.

332
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,160
I'm looking.

333
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,540
A 3:00am curfew. What was I thinking?

334
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,110
Looks like something on the
corner of 5th and dexter.

335
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,550
Thank you.

336
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,420
Ok, so I was all up and through that
after-prom, and no one has seen amanda...

337
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,550
dancing like that.

338
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,850
She and kyle are just... just dancing.

339
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,880
A respectable distance from each
other, having an awesome time.

340
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,030
Well, shall we pop another?

341
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,650
- I'm awfully parched.
- Sure.

342
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,800
How do we get in?

343
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,240
We'll have to wait until
they go back inside.

344
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,980
This could take awhile.

345
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,340
We'll slip past them.

346
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,490
No, they'll see us.

347
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,160
No, they won'T.

348
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,600
Great, now we can't see either.

349
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,360
Enhance your vision.

350
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,790
This is amazing.

351
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,420
You've been holding out on me.

352
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,060
What are you worried about?

353
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,450
I got wasted and I screwed up.

354
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,100
If anything, lori hates me.

355
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,820
You don't understand.

356
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,800
She's my bff and your
on-again, off-again.

357
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,760
Yeah, and her and me
are off again for good.

358
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,830
So what does it matter?

359
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,360
It matters, absolutely!

360
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,930
Yes, I may have
transgressed in the past,

361
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,730
but under no circumstances will I
ever hook up with my best friend's ex.

362
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,630
She may have made a major
mistake by rejecting you,

363
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,720
even though you're this incredible guy
that went to great lengths to win her over.

364
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:16,070
But I will not, cannot
allow myself to like you.

365
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,900
Are we clear?

366
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,420
So what do you think? Wrap it up?

367
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,830
Yeah. I don't have the heart to
kill you any more ways tonight.

368
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,730
The lost puppy dog look. Let me guess.

369
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,560
You're thinking, are we really gonna be that couple
who went to prom and played video games all night?

370
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,250
Maybe. A little.

371
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,070
But only because you look so hot
and everyone else is doing it,

372
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:09,130
which is not an argument I imagine
you're gonna fly with right now.

373
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,710
Is it?

374
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,410
You're the one who didn't want to.

375
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,360
You didn't want to either.

376
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,060
But you went on the record first.

377
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,010
Total jerk.

378
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,880
So you really did want to? Do?

379
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,940
Do you?

380
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,760
There are so many arguments against.

381
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,710
I know, the clich? of it all.

382
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,490
There's that. And there's
the what happens after?

383
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,690
I... I just want to get to the during.

384
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,820
Seriously.

385
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,290
Say you have this amazing pair of jeans.

386
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,540
You love them. They feel
great and they hug your ass.

387
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,770
And then you cut them
off to make shorts.

388
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,430
You can't ever get them back.

389
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,750
So... we're the comfortable,
ass-hugging jeans.

390
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,890
But what if we're not great as shorts?

391
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,710
Exactly.

392
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:12,140
And I would hate myself if I gave up a great
pair of jeans for some sucky, raggedy cut-offs.

393
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,490
I think the jeans are worth cutting so we
could try them on as shorts at least once.

394
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,760
Josh, it'll happen when it's right.

395
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,220
Not because it's prom night
or because we're supposed to,

396
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:26,290
but when everything comes together in the
moment, we'll feel it. We'll just know.

397
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,990
How will we find her?

398
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,200
I'll hear her heartbeat.

399
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,470
Come on.

400
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,440
- Security to the front gate...
- I'll handle this.

401
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,650
No. Jessi...

402
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,520
- we don't have time to argue.
- Then listen to me.

403
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,370
Next time, we do it my way.

404
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,370
I don't want you to get hurt.

405
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,780
- Don't worry about me.
- Jessi.

406
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,490
If we have to separate, get out
and head straight back to sarah.

407
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,500
- Kyle...
- promise me.

408
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,140
I need to know you'll be safe.

409
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,690
I promise.

410
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,560
You kbow, it's only a matter of
time 'till they realize we're here.

411
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,480
And when that happens,
you'll have to fight.

412
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,470
See what I mean?

413
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,750
We do it my way.

414
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,260
No choice.

415
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,290
I like my way better.

416
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,470
I can hear it now. It's amanda.

417
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,240
Kyle.

418
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,410
- Jessi, go.
- No. I'll be fine.

419
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,820
Go get your prom date.

420
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,340
What do they want from him?

421
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Please... They have a plan.

422
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,380
What plan?

423
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,700
I don't know.

424
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,490
- Amanda!
- Security breach in corridor six.

425
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,240
Security breach in corridor six.

426
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,860
Kyle! They're coming. Go!

427
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,900
There they are!

428
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,350
Take her.

429
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,550
Put her down!

430
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,630
- Put the girl down.
- Go!

431
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,510
put him in the chair.

432
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,340
It was a rubber bullet.

433
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,910
Waited a long time to meet you, kyle.

434
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,750
I'm glad you're here.

435
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,730
What is this?

436
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,330
You've been through a lot tonight.

437
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,840
But you were amazing, man.

438
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,630
You handled everything we threw at you.

439
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,840
What do you mean?

440
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,220
The way you used and controlled your abilities,
 even though you were upset about amanda.

441
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,670
She'll be fine, by the way.

442
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,560
You planned all of this?

443
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,680
You've got a big future here, kyle.

444
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,420
We have a lot we need to talk about.

445
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,000
I don't want anything to do with you.

446
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,870
Look... you're angry. Fair enough.

447
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,180
Our methods can seem
a little... extreme.

448
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,750
You took me. You've frightened
my family! You took amanda!

449
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,820
 She won't remember a thing.

450
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,320
Don't ever go near her again.

451
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,880
We're not the enemy, kyle.

452
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,820
We just want to know you.

453
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,230
 Work with you.

454
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,370
No. I'll never be part of this.

455
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,980
It's too much to take in for one night.

456
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,540
Here... give him her bag.

457
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,670
Don't forget your bowtie.

458
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,440
They'll charge you an arm and
a leg if you forget it. Go home.

459
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,980
They're all waiting.

460
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,150
See you around.

461
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,650
I don't want to wake them.

462
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,670
Here's my key.

463
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,430
At least you didn't lose it.

464
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,610
 That again?

465
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,540
I meant your key. You
found your key. I swear.

466
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,230
What?

467
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:27,260
Nothing. I just...

468
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,430
I don't know.

469
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,360
Something about the way...

470
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,370
 this was the best night

471
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,320
It was, wasn't it?

472
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,050
And, now it's over.

473
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,290
Yeah.

474
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,710
So, I guess, good night?

475
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,450
Right.

476
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,570
Well, don't make me ask you for one.

477
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,360
- One what?
- A hug.

478
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,960
A hug? Absolutely.

479
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,590
Kyle.

480
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,950
 Jessi, what are you doing here?

481
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,440
I couldn't leave without you.

482
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,160
- Amanda...
- no, she's here. She's fine.

483
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,700
I think she might be starting
to wake up a little bit.

484
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,640
What time is it?

485
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,260
It's about 2:30.

486
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,580
- I have to get her home.
- Wait, what happened? What did they want?

487
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,920
He'll do anything for the girl.

488
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,760
She'll do anything for him.

489
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,420
Thanks for all your help.

490
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,680
Did everything work
out the way you wanted?

491
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,760
Exactly.

492
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,010
They went to all that
trouble to meet you... ...

493
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,720
and I was right there, but
they didn't care about me.

494
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:47,020
Jessi, that's a good thing.

495
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,320
You need to go that way
to get home to sarah.

496
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,980
I know.

497
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,230
Will you be all right?

498
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,700
Aren't I always?

499
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:00,010
Thank you.

500
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,890
You'll be late.

501
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,860
Carol, please stay...

502
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,050
it's 2:58, I need to see if she's back.

503
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,980
All right. I'll walk you home.

504
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,650
You need to stay here with your wife.

505
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,430
you're awake.

506
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,680
I must've fallen asleep
at the after-party.

507
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,530
I'm sorry. Tonit must have
been so boring for you.

508
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,970
I'm just glad to be standing
here with you right now.

509
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,860
The whole night felt
like a dream. Did I...

510
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,930
Amanda, you're home.

511
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,830
You had me very worried.

512
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,340
No need to worry, mrs. Bloom.

513
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,510
Home by 3:00, as promised.

514
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,840
And I'm supposed to be impressed that
you followed my simple instructions?

515
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,890
was it everything you imagined?

516
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,600
Better.

517
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,670
Sorry. Did I scare you?

518
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,300
No, I...

519
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,470
You're still here? Obviously.

520
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,410
 You're standing right in front of me.

521
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,710
- Yes, well...
- thanks for the tip.

522
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,600
Sure.

523
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,470
I never caught your name.

524
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,110
Jessi.

525
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,760
I'm cassidy.

526
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,730
Have a good night.

527
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,900
sarah?

528
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,010
sarah, I'm home.

529
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,810
Sarah?

530
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,450
did I wake you?

531
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,370
No, I'm still awake.

532
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,380
Not for long.

533
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,810
That spiked punch must have
really done a number on me.

534
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,490
Amanda didn't remember
what had happened at all.

535
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,220
You'll feel better in the morning.

536
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,880
I want to thank you, kyle.

537
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:49,130
My night was perfect.

538
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,570
Sweet dreams.

539
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,770
The most important
thing was we were home.

540
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,250
And she was safe.

541
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,670
And for her, only
happy memories remained.
