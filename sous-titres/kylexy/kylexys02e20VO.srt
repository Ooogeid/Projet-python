1
00:00:00,263 --> 00:00:02,167
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,230
My mom and I talked,

3
00:00:03,288 --> 00:00:04,905
she won't let me see you
outside of school for a while.

4
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,380
She could be you.

5
00:00:06,718 --> 00:00:07,444
What?

6
00:00:07,513 --> 00:00:10,184
The two of you used to play
that song all the time.

7
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:11,475
<i>It's not there.</i>

8
00:00:11,556 --> 00:00:13,364
It's their song, D4,

9
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:15,150
it's the missing record
from the jukebox.

10
00:00:15,277 --> 00:00:17,630
<i>- Where did you get this?
- I found it in my room.</i>

11
00:00:17,804 --> 00:00:19,998
I'm trying to book
the DJ for an event.

12
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:21,162
A prom?

13
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:22,411
You're DJ Spinbrandt?

14
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:23,573
And I don't do proms.

15
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:26,141
Oh, my God, I can't believe I got
into this whole mess over you!

16
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,583
How sweet is this?

17
00:00:27,707 --> 00:00:29,002
That's awesome.

18
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:30,533
You're awesome.

19
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:31,670
You're kind of awesome, too.

20
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:34,492
Maybe I am lazy and
I lack study skills,

21
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,700
but I've changed,

22
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,683
<i>and I'm going to do something
important with my life</i>

23
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:38,751
and make a difference.

24
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:39,922
You don't know
how Sarah died.

25
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:41,052
She was just like you.

26
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,671
Trying too much, too fast,

27
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:45,223
and when she tried something she
wasn't ready for, it killed her.

28
00:00:45,298 --> 00:00:47,121
You can't keep doing
this to yourself.

29
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:48,661
Promise me you'll stop.

30
00:00:50,727 --> 00:00:51,871
I promise...

31
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:53,882
I'm going in for my
check-up tomorrow,

32
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:55,653
<i>it'll tell me if
I'm better or not.</i>

33
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:57,781
Andy, everything's going
to be okay.

34
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,181
You know, when you say it,

35
00:01:01,258 --> 00:01:03,650
I almost believe it.

36
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:17,363
<i>When we sleep, the
subconscious mind takes over.</i>

37
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:21,533
<i>Our dreams can reveal what's
disturbing us in our waking hours,</i>

38
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:26,060
<i>and there are rare occasions in the
state between sleep and consciousness,</i>

39
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:28,063
<i>when the things that
most trouble us</i>

40
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:29,953
<i>can emerge.</i>

41
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:37,713
Stephen,

42
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:39,312
what are you doing?

43
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:43,380
Happy anniversary.

44
00:01:43,546 --> 00:01:46,610
That's the bracelet that I
loved at the art fair.

45
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:48,953
Yeah, I grabbed the
designer's card.

46
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:51,283
I just ruined your surprise.

47
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:54,590
Hey, it's not the only
thing I have up my sleeve.

48
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:57,432
I'm making us dinner
tomorrow night.

49
00:01:57,528 --> 00:01:59,650
And for dessert...

50
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:02,741
I thought we'd have these.

51
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:09,762
Kyle, what are you doing up?

52
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:12,451
I can't tell what it is yet.

53
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:22,622
I think he's sleepwalking.

54
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:24,713
Kyle, why are you
in the kitchen?

55
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:26,460
I'm drawing a picture.

56
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:35,311
Should we wake him up?

57
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:38,351
No, let's just put
him back to bed.

58
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:40,151
I'm not finished yet.

59
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:44,431
I ran out of wavelengths
640 to 750 nanometers.

60
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:49,252
Frequency 480 to 405 theraherz.

61
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:53,752
Hex triplet number ff0000.

62
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:54,793
What's he saying?

63
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:57,503
He's basically saying
he needs more red.

64
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:01,102
<i>Come on, Kyle.</i>

65
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:23,951
I need to put them in order.

66
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:26,161
You can do that in the morning.

67
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:27,481
Okay.

68
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:31,791
Good night.

69
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:39,342

72
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:51,221
I guess I really
was sleepwalking.

73
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:53,472
Why would I have done that?

74
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:56,072
Maybe you reached
a boiling point.

75
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:58,880
Sleepwalking is sometimes
a symptom of stress.

76
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:00,392
I don't feel stressed.

77
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:02,971
Well, that doesn't mean
you're not experiencing it.

78
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:05,180
You're restricted
from seeing Amanda,

79
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:08,171
Adam Baylin has basically
come back from the dead,

80
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:10,320
- and Jessi...
- Is still being Jessi.

81
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,522
That's three major
relationships in your life

82
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:16,262
that are asking you to give an
unusual amount of emotional energy.

83
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:19,002
You think that's why
I'm sleepwalking?

84
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:20,870
I think it's...

85
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:24,650
kind of a drastic reaction
to the pressure, but...

86
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:28,310
yes, I think you may need to
simplify your life a little.

87
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:30,153
Simplify.

88
00:04:31,947 --> 00:04:32,990
Back it up!

89
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:35,042
I won the coin toss.

90
00:04:35,157 --> 00:04:36,083
Coin toss?

91
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:37,903
Yeah, for your brain.

92
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,273
Form a line, people.

93
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:46,372
Okay, here's the deal.

94
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:48,012
Placement exams...

95
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:49,281
they're mostly crap.

96
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:52,113
But they're mandatory,
so it must be important to do well.

97
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:53,870
Screw up, and
you're looking at summer school.

98
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:56,001
Really screw up, and
you have to repeat a grade.

99
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:57,030
How can I help?

100
00:04:57,115 --> 00:05:00,491
Mr. Callahan is, like, smoking hot
for a 35-year-old math teacher.

101
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:04,053
As a result, I'm in desperate
need for a trig recap.

102
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:04,912
A recap?

103
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:07,821
I haven't exactly paid
attention the last semester.

104
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,921
- In every subject?
- Not in every subject.

105
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:12,541
I'm just hung up on a couple
of things in biology.

106
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:14,251
What, does everyone
need to study today?

107
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:15,540
Oh, no, I've already studied.

108
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:18,102
But I'm entering the
prom theme song contest.

109
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:19,642
Losing is not an option.

110
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:21,593
I'm going to need to tap
into your mental thesaurus.

111
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,213
<i>Whatever you need.</i>

112
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:25,602
So, I managed to convince my
mom that it wouldn't hurt

113
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,180
to have you tutor me
for placement exams.

114
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:29,630
That's great.

115
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,863
I'd be happy to help you study.

116
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:33,732
Oh, I don't want to study.

117
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:36,321
I just want an acceptable excuse
to spend time with you today.

118
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:37,552
Today.

119
00:05:37,698 --> 00:05:40,223
A whole afternoon of
unchaperoned quality time.

120
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:46,242
You're not free.
I should have asked you first.

121
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:47,843
No, it's fine.

122
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:50,990
I'd love to spend unchaperoned
quality time with you.

123
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:52,193
Good.

124
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:55,292
And I'm think I'm sensing a
thaw with my mom's concerned.

125
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,370
If she's letting us study together,
a date can't be too far behind.

126
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,513
So I should ask her
if we can go out?

127
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:01,480
No.

128
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:04,052
You should ask her to think
about considering the idea

129
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:05,282
whether or not we can go out.

130
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:07,220
She's a glacier,
not an ice cube.

131
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:11,030
So if I told her that letting us
study is symbolic of her trust in me,

132
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:12,950
and that I'd like to continue
to build that trust,

133
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:16,731
maybe in time I can earn the
honor of having a date with you.

134
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:19,602
Yeah, something exactly
like that.

135
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:21,982
See you later.

136
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:29,151
<i>Nicole advised me
to simplify my life</i>

137
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,780
<i>to avoid distractions
and commitments,</i>

138
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:33,970
<i>but the people I
cared about needed me,</i>

139
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:36,151
<i>and I didn't want
to disappoint them.</i>

140
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:39,592
- Kyle!
- Steven, is something wrong?

141
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,492
Yeah, the broth for
my bouillabaisse.

142
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:43,233
Impressive, Nicole
will love it.

143
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,090
Not if she can cut it
with a knife.

144
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:47,988
It should be vaguely
in the realm of soup.

145
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,012
Could you make
something simpler?

146
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,581
It's her anniversary.
I want to wow her.

147
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:54,291
I've never cooked before.

148
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:55,780
I have a cookbook right here.

149
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:57,973
It's all the basics in
less than 2,000 pages.

150
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,552
<i>You can swing that, right?</i>

151
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:02,102
I'll see what I can do.

152
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,121
Kill me now.

153
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,100
My headstone can say,

154
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:07,410
"here lies Lori Trager,
singer/songwriter,

155
00:07:07,446 --> 00:07:09,012
choked on her own lyrics."

156
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:11,090
It's a contest for
a prom theme song.

157
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:13,013
Tap into your inner girl.

158
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:14,930
What does make the rest of me?

159
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,292
You know what I mean.

160
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:18,472
<i>- Don't let it frustrate you.
- I can't help it.</i>

161
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:19,902
Personnal study guide.

162
00:07:19,997 --> 00:07:21,612
I cross-referenced
placement test guidelines

163
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:22,921
with your english
class syllabus.

164
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:24,802
Factoring in
mid-terms and quizzes

165
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:26,483
I pinpointed the areas
where you should focus

166
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:27,952
to maximize your study time.

167
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:28,892
Thanks.

168
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:29,881
Wait!

169
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:30,710
My turn.

170
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:32,622
What rhymes with corsage?

171
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:35,590
There are 12 interims
for the word "corsage."

172
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:36,872
Garage, massage,

173
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:38,802
barrage, mirage,

174
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:46,482
Wait, there's also...

175
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:49,251
Four words is a start.

176
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,260
How's your study guide?

177
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:00,492
Nice.

178
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:03,330
Bio with a focus
on human analogy.

179
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,323
Anatomy.

180
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:06,631
That's what I said.

181
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,230
Do you hear that?

182
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:13,790
What is it?

183
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:15,711
Someone's humming.

184
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,613
It's Jessi.

185
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:26,761
Why can I hear her?

186
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:30,743
A little something
called super hearing?

187
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,980
I can only do that
when I'm trying.

188
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:34,200
Your point?

189
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:36,493
I'm not trying.

190
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:38,733
Alrighty, then.

191
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:40,250
Thanks for this.

192
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:42,561
We'll get the study group
going out to the house later.

193
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:43,802
Is four o'clock cool?

194
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:45,022
Sure.

195
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:50,121
- Wait. Today?
- Hi.

196
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:54,090
You were just
humming that song.

197
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:56,370
How did you make
it sound so loud?

198
00:08:56,498 --> 00:08:58,973
I didn't. I was just humming.

199
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,420
You must've used the acoustics
in here to direct your voice.

200
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:05,030
Have... have you been sleeping?

201
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:07,881
You seem kind of worn down.

202
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:09,400
I do?

203
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:11,602
There's something
wrong with you.

204
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:13,462
<i>I can feel it.</i>

205
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:18,782
I just need you to play my song
so I can give it a pure listen

206
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:20,791
and make sure it's going
to mesh with my lyrics.

207
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:22,463
Five minutes and then
you can go stop dad

208
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:23,910
from burning down our house.

209
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:30,853
Um, that's not my song.

210
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:34,182
I played what you wrote.

211
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:36,180
Play it again.

212
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:39,882
B flat,

213
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:43,203
G minor,

214
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:47,201
I don't even know how
to play that chord.

215
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:49,140
E flat major seven.

216
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:57,042
F major.

217
00:09:57,996 --> 00:09:59,920
That's not your song.

218
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:03,043
I'm sorry, I've had this other
song stuck in my head all day.

219
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,772
Whatever it is, it's pretty.

220
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:09,670
Thanks for bailing me out.

221
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:13,162
I really want this dinner
to be something special.

222
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:16,600
When you're doing something for
someone you really care about...

223
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:20,250
<i>Jessi was right, there was
something wrong with me.</i>

224
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:22,610
<i>My mind seemed to
be playing tricks.</i>

225
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:27,100
<i>No matter how hard I focused,</i>

226
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:29,701
<i>I was losing control
of my abilities.</i>

227
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:34,143
<i>And I didn't know why.</i>

228
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:35,580
Well, thanks, Kyle.

229
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:37,592
You know, you're a natural
in the kitchen.

230
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:41,640
Mom, huge problem.

231
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:43,901
Okay, Josh, could you give me,
like, five minutes?

232
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:45,593
Kyle draws weird
stuff all the time.

233
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:48,062
- This is an emergency.
- What's wrong?

234
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:50,743
How about every answer
on the study sheet?

235
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:53,742
Josh, this is basic
high school science.

236
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:55,922
Come on, you've been
doing so well.

237
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:57,092
That's the thing.

238
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:58,153
I didn't make that.

239
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,312
Kyle did.

240
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,351
When did this happen?

241
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:01,253
This morning.

242
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:04,253
Plus, Lori and I both
noticed he was being clumsy

243
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:05,440
and he kept having brain farts.

244
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:07,023
He's on the fritz.
You gotta fix him.

245
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:08,401
I'm glad you're concerned.

246
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:09,421
Concerned?

247
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:10,730
I'm flipping out.

248
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,041
I told everyone to come over
so Kyle can help us study.

249
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:14,303
What good is he
going to be now?

250
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:15,882
He's like the idiot
king of stupid town.

251
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,482
Kyle has a lot on his
plate right now, okay?

252
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:21,311
Maybe you can try and
study without his help.

253
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:26,523
Or I can find someone as
smart as Kyle to fill in.

254
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:28,791
Yeah, good luck with that.

255
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:36,833
And I expect you to come
straight home for dinner.

256
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:38,273
Mrs. Bloom.

257
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:40,822
Thank you for letting
Amanda come over today.

258
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,352
I'm still not sure
it's such a good idea.

259
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:46,660
However I suppose
the proof will come

260
00:11:46,695 --> 00:11:51,051
when Amanda's test results are posted.

261
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:53,221
All right.

262
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:56,263
I just wanna say that I
appreciate your trust in me,

263
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:58,660
and I want to continue
to build that trust.

264
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:00,723
I hope you know that I
plan on working hard at

265
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:03,231
earning the honor of a
date with your giraffe.

266
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:06,303
I think he meant
"date with me."

267
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:08,473
I should certainly hope so.

268
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:10,733
That's what I said.

269
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,513
Just promise me you'll
thank about it.

270
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:16,923
All right, I'll think about it.

271
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:18,373
Dinner, Amanda.

272
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:19,772
I'll be on time.

273
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:28,633
Did I say something wrong?

274
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:31,081
It's not a big deal.
You were nervous.

275
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:33,920
Plus, I think my mom kind
of likes making you squirm.

276
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:36,672
At least we get to spend
time together today.

277
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:38,911
Speaking of time together...

278
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,123
Josh's study group.
I got the text.

279
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:42,590
I'm sorry.

280
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:45,052
Honestly, I could use
a bit of study time.

281
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:46,560
As long as I get to
sit next to you.

282
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:48,082
<i>Kyle? Little help?</i>

283
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:49,830
That can be arranged.

284
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,193
I just have to finish
something in the kitchen.

285
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:53,520
I'll be waiting.

286
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:01,850
How's the lobster sauce?

287
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:03,992
I burned it before.
Now it's too runny.

288
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:05,412
I'll give it a try.

289
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:08,181
I heard lobster.

290
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:09,872
You keep poking
your head in here.

291
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,683
Stephen, I get the whole top
secret thing, I really do.

292
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:13,991
And I appreciate it, but...

293
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:15,462
Will you quit snooping, then?

294
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:16,710
Kyle and I have
it under control.

295
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,611
Are you sure about that?

296
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:24,942
The recipe says you can thicken
the sauce by adding flour.

297
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:34,053
This isn't flour, is it?

298
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:36,901
Maybe you should lie
down for a while.

299
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:40,850
Go ahead.
I can handle it from here.

300
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:47,920
But Amanda, she...

301
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:49,710
I'll just tell her you didn't
sleep well last night.

302
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:51,451
I'm sure she'll understand.

303
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:55,943
I'll be in my room
if anyone needs me.

304
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:12,040
<i>Maybe I was too stressed,</i>

305
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:15,213
<i>too busy trying to be
everything to everyone.</i>

306
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:49,752
<i>Kyle?</i>

307
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:59,291
I drew the pictures again.

308
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:04,370
Nicole?

309
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:10,313
I only closed my
eyes for a minute.

310
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:12,553
You've been in here
for almost an hour.

311
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:13,553
I checked on you.

312
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:15,371
You fell asleep at your desk.

313
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:22,840
Whatever is wrong with me,

314
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:26,133
I don't think it's stress.

315
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:39,453
Thank god you're here.

316
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:43,440
I'm already feeling at least ten
points above the 50th percentile.

317
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:44,860
What is she doing here?

318
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:47,233
Josh called and said you
needed help studying.

319
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:48,641
Kyle's letting you down.

320
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:50,133
He's not letting us down,
he's just...

321
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:51,391
Not smart enough today?

322
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:53,242
I know, but I am.

323
00:15:53,298 --> 00:15:54,620
You ready to get started?

324
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:01,383
I'm sorry I left you out there.

325
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:03,453
I think I accidentally
fell asleep.

326
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,030
I heard you were tired.

327
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:07,511
Don't worry.
The study session's underway.

328
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:09,362
Josh brought in a ringer.

329
00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:10,273
A what?

330
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,123
He called in Jessi to help.

331
00:16:13,216 --> 00:16:15,463
If you ask me, she seems
a little smug about it.

332
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,231
She probably is.

333
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:22,020
Is everything okay?

334
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:25,730
Sure.

335
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:29,502
I'm just...

336
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:30,880
You're overloaded.

337
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:33,051
We all put too
much on you today.

338
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:35,280
But I wanted to be
there for everybody.

339
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:40,053
How about if I'm here
for you instead?

340
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:47,220
That feels nice.

341
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:53,030
You know...
Jessi probably could help you

342
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:54,513
with your geometry theorems.

343
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:55,630
Kyle.

344
00:16:56,488 --> 00:16:57,303
What?

345
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,613
We're not gonna
waste another minute

346
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:02,301
of our quality time together
talking about Jessi.

347
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:06,881
That's a good idea.

348
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:18,830
18...

349
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:20,402
19...

350
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:22,542
20.

351
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:28,000
What is it going to take
for you to remember?

352
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:30,650
There's no such thing
as the vision system.

353
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,572
The eyes are part of the...

354
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:33,853
Nervous system?

355
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,631
Get up.

356
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,620
Now... name the six muscles

357
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:42,890
that control eye movement.

358
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:46,702
Lateral rectus.

359
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,913
The medieval rectus.

360
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:53,980
It's the medial rectus.

361
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:01,463
Lori.
Wanna study with us?

362
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:02,740
Not so much, no.

363
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:06,771
Looks like somebody
went to the 2 for 1 men sale.

364
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,400
Oh, look.
It's my bar fight hero.

365
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:12,200
Not you, sucker punch. You.

366
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:14,792
Hey, how's the prom shapin' up?

367
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,880
You found any
bargain-basement DJs yet?

368
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:19,173
Funny. I'm looking at one.

369
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,642
You ought to get your
eyes checked, then.

370
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:23,671
I'm not the one
with glasses, four-eyes.

371
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:27,432
Cute.
That insult was so high school.

372
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:31,702
My dad's in the kitchen.

373
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:33,350
You should go there.

374
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:35,360
Now.

375
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:36,883
Okay.

376
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:44,380
What?

377
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:46,450
Hey, guys, this should be fun.

378
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:52,892
I can't study on
an empty stomach.

379
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:54,530
I'm gonna go grab a snack.

380
00:18:54,888 --> 00:18:56,961
I have a crappy high
school song to write.

381
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:59,143
I think Lori needs help
with her crappy song.

382
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:00,312
I'll be right there!

383
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,561
19...

384
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:03,951
20.

385
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:06,652
Stay.

386
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,983
Thanks for taking care of this.

387
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,833
I usually go to Kyle with
the mechanical problems

388
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:14,412
I can't take care of myself,
but... he's unavailable, so...

389
00:19:14,518 --> 00:19:16,800
It's not a problem.
Um, I'll have 'em back to you tomorrow.

390
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:18,181
Great.

391
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:20,771
Uh, is there a bathroom I
could use before I head out?

392
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:22,052
Upstairs and to the right.

393
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:25,253
Ahem. Excuse me.

394
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:30,213
Your ceviche looks perfect,
Mr. Trager.

395
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:31,422
Is that fresh cilantro?

396
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:32,473
Yes, it is.

397
00:19:32,577 --> 00:19:34,411
Yummy. What else have you made?

398
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:36,261
Well, you name it,
and I've probably wrecked it

399
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:37,561
already once or twice today.

400
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:39,040
Started out trying to
make a bouillabaisse,

401
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:40,730
and Kyle helped me pare
it down from there.

402
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:42,872
Wise choice!
It took me three of four tries

403
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,643
before I even got into the french
provençal cuisine ballpark.

404
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:48,422
Uh, Hillary, what was it

405
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,863
you were expecting
to study today?

406
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:51,313
Trig. I'd give you the lowdown

407
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:54,520
on Mr. Callahan
and his massive shoulders,

408
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,641
but we're not really friends
like that yet, are we?

409
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:58,541
Uh, no, not yet.
But did you know

410
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:01,342
that when I was an undergrad
I was a double major?

411
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,622
And one of 'em was
applied mathematics?

412
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:04,752
For reals?

413
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,833
Cause I'm sensing you
need a salad course

414
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,050
that'll stand up to your steaks

415
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:10,760
without overpowering
your lobster.

416
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:13,411
How about a tomato,
orange, and saved fennel salad

417
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:14,431
with frizzled leeks?

418
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:16,581
You frizzle, and I'll tutor.

419
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:28,013
See? I told you it would work out.
That was great.

420
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:30,620
Thanks, but that's not
honest criticism.

421
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:31,851
You're being a friend,

422
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:33,750
and there are times when
I need that from you

423
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:36,461
or from my mother.
This is not one of them.

424
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,991
Did you just
compare me to your...

425
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:39,253
Sorta, kinda, yeah.

426
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:40,630
Sorry.

427
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,582
Hey. DJ boy.

428
00:20:42,878 --> 00:20:44,353
Did you hear any of that song?

429
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:46,520
Uh, not really.

430
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:47,431
Come in here.

431
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:49,181
Whoa. What does
his opinion matter?

432
00:20:49,356 --> 00:20:50,263
He knows music.

433
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:51,400
I need a disinterested

434
00:20:51,435 --> 00:20:53,711
yet well-informed
party to weigh in.

435
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:55,973
Go ahead, Mark.
Be completely unfiltered.

436
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,723
- No holds barred.
- Okay.

437
00:20:57,835 --> 00:21:01,042
Well, uh, the lyrics were catchy.

438
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:02,933
None of this weak-ass,
college boy,

439
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:05,432
discussion group bull.
Be real.

440
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:07,281
All right.

441
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:09,902
You need to work on
musical composition.

442
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,090
That's what I'm talking about.

443
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:13,081
In-you-face gut reaction.

444
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:15,480
I mean,
your fingering's a mess.

445
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:17,893
You handle a guitar like a...
a blunt instrument.

446
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:21,471
- Real nice.
- No, no, it's okay.

447
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:23,142
Come on. More.

448
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,523
There are more than three
chords to a pop song.

449
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:28,382
You know? Just because most
people don't use 'em and...

450
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:31,822
You should push yourself
to be not so derivative.

451
00:21:32,885 --> 00:21:33,883
Right.

452
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:42,601
Jessi, can I interrupt?

453
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,792
- Absolutely.
- We're not finished.

454
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:46,453
I'll take over for you.

455
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:54,191
<i>Come on.
Over here.</i>

456
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,202
I need you to try and read me.

457
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:01,381
I read that answer
sheet you made for Josh.

458
00:22:01,546 --> 00:22:03,052
That's about all
I need to know.

459
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:04,842
When'd you get so ordinary?

460
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:06,520
I'm serious, Jessi.

461
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,001
You knew something was
wrong with me this morning.

462
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:12,000
Maybe you can get in my head
and figure out what's happening.

463
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:13,211
All right.

464
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:15,570
I'll try.

465
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:25,811
- You have to try, too.
- I am trying.

466
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:29,031
It's like the signal's
weak or something.

467
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:32,511
What did you do?

468
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:33,652
What do you mean?

469
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:35,092
You did something.

470
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:36,640
You pushed.
That's not fair.

471
00:22:36,698 --> 00:22:38,462
I... I didn't do anything.

472
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:40,192
You made me promise
not to push myself,

473
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:42,363
and then you go out
and do something new?

474
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:43,380
Tell me what it is.

475
00:22:43,435 --> 00:22:45,110
This isn't a game, Jessi.

476
00:22:45,316 --> 00:22:46,371
I don't know what's
happening to me.

477
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:47,431
I could really be...

478
00:22:52,235 --> 00:22:53,562
You're the best!
Did you know that?

479
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:56,853
I guess I do now.
What's this for?

480
00:22:57,395 --> 00:22:59,160
The other day, when
I was nervous about my tests

481
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:00,173
to see if the cancer was gone...

482
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:02,463
I don't really know you, but...

483
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,320
Anyway, you were just there.
It's like...

484
00:23:04,398 --> 00:23:05,933
You knew I needed a hug.

485
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:07,462
I don't really know you, either!

486
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:10,110
Oh. it's okay.
Hugs are good.

487
00:23:10,178 --> 00:23:11,593
What's all the lovin for?

488
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,370
I was gonna text.
Too impersonal.

489
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,183
Then I was gonna call,
but again, digital.

490
00:23:17,258 --> 00:23:19,181
This is a strictly analog
moment that should be shared

491
00:23:19,218 --> 00:23:21,271
with real-time hugs
and gushy feelings.

492
00:23:23,326 --> 00:23:26,612
My test results are back.
I'm officially in remission!

493
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:52,113
What did you do?

494
00:24:09,675 --> 00:24:11,833
You did it. You cured her.

495
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:13,542
- That's impossible.
- Why?

496
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:14,571
Because it is.

497
00:24:14,615 --> 00:24:15,691
I healed my hand.

498
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:17,260
Adam Baylin healed himself
when he was shot.

499
00:24:17,328 --> 00:24:18,460
It's not the same, Jessi.

500
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:20,823
Andy's cancer
was blood-related.

501
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,961
Manipulating blood
cells to heal a cut...

502
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:25,153
That's not that far off
from what you'd have to do.

503
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:27,332
But I didn't try
to do anything.

504
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:29,443
I just wanted to make
her feel better.

505
00:24:29,795 --> 00:24:31,110
An emotional trigger...

506
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:33,901
Which is how we always
discover new abilities.

507
00:24:34,228 --> 00:24:35,530
- Yes, but it...
- Why are you always

508
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,541
trying to deny what
we're capable of?

509
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:39,201
Can you just stop yelling?

510
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:40,570
I'm not.

511
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:43,271
It's pounding in my head.

512
00:24:44,878 --> 00:24:46,060
You're messed up.

513
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:47,921
You did something that
taxed your system.

514
00:24:47,995 --> 00:24:50,252
Now your system
is punishing you.

515
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:52,222
Look what happens if
we're not strong enough.

516
00:24:52,295 --> 00:24:54,210
Jessi, I can't do
this right now.

517
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:56,251
Everyone out there
is relying on me.

518
00:24:56,347 --> 00:24:58,641
For study groups? Cooking?

519
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:00,752
You and I are so
much more than that.

520
00:25:00,797 --> 00:25:02,652
I don't want to be so much more!

521
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:06,093
I want to help Josh
ace his exams...

522
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:07,931
Lori write her song,
and Steven prepare

523
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:09,562
the perfect dinner for Nicole.

524
00:25:09,737 --> 00:25:12,020
I want to spend the
afternoon with Amanda.

525
00:25:13,348 --> 00:25:15,083
I want to be there for them...

526
00:25:15,496 --> 00:25:17,432
Be the person they
need me to be.

527
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:19,151
Mediocre.

528
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:21,841
You wouldn't understand.

529
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:24,993
You're right.

530
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:27,832
I wouldn't.

531
00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:31,001
Jessi, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

532
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:33,180
We should, uh...
You should get back out there.

533
00:25:33,217 --> 00:25:35,751
I'm sure everyone's
wondering where you are.

534
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:46,391
I really have to go.
My moms are taking me out to celebrate.

535
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,153
Pizza and batting cages.

536
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,041
I should get back to studying.

537
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:54,503
I'm glad I'm not with
cancer girl anymore.

538
00:25:54,576 --> 00:25:57,242
Well, I guess that means
you need a new t-shirt.

539
00:25:57,835 --> 00:25:59,483
I really have to go.

540
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:03,560
Hils, I'm gonna take off.

541
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:05,192
What about the study session?

542
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:06,221
Not feelin' it.

543
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:07,062
Where's Lori?

544
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:08,943
Upstairs. Mark gave
here some feedback

545
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:10,761
- on her prom song.
- My T.A. Mark?

546
00:26:10,825 --> 00:26:13,581
Apparently, he's some
all-knowing musical big shot.

547
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:15,532
You're kidding.
Is he still here?

548
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:16,821
No. He left.

549
00:26:16,905 --> 00:26:19,581
And... He's a little obnoxious,
if you ask me.

550
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:24,490
Okay. All right, uh,
where were we?

551
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:26,582
Um... right. A cord

552
00:26:26,678 --> 00:26:29,971
is just a straight line drawn
between two points on a curve.

553
00:26:30,707 --> 00:26:32,300
Okay, Mr. Trager.

554
00:26:32,368 --> 00:26:33,932
I think we're friends now.

555
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:35,323
Can I be honest?

556
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:37,453
Sure, but could Mr. Callahan wait?

557
00:26:37,506 --> 00:26:40,220
It's not about him.
It's about Mark.

558
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:43,063
I'm not so sure Lori should
get involved with an older man.

559
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:46,112
An older... What...
Uh, did I miss something?

560
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:47,641
Apparently everything.

561
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:49,991
Once upon a time,
Lori and Declan were Leclan.

562
00:26:50,136 --> 00:26:51,373
They were joined at the hip.

563
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:52,630
Then they weren't.

564
00:26:52,707 --> 00:26:55,683
Personally... I think
they're meant to be.

565
00:26:57,026 --> 00:26:58,740
Wait. So how does my T.A.
enter the picture?

566
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:00,961
Oh, come on, like you
haven't noticed.

567
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:02,462
No... I haven't.

568
00:27:02,535 --> 00:27:04,843
Well, snarky Mark's a
hottie in dork's clothing,

569
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:07,462
but I don't think Lori's
seeing it just yet.

570
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:09,531
She has no idea
their aggro-flirting

571
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:12,390
is thinly disguised
sexual tension.

572
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:14,411
Sexual... What...

573
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:17,201
Ex... exactly are
you talking about?

574
00:27:17,685 --> 00:27:19,222
Sexual nothing!

575
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:21,861
What I meant was, could you
pass the sherry vinegar?

576
00:27:21,996 --> 00:27:24,252
Hey, dad. good news
made Josh hungry.

577
00:27:24,328 --> 00:27:26,232
Son, I'm happier for you
than I've ever been,

578
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:27,732
but if you touch my ceviche,
I will kill you.

579
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:30,481
Is Kyle okay?
He disappeared into his room again.

580
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,122
Hopefully, he's in
there getting smarter.

581
00:27:32,237 --> 00:27:33,101
I'm fine.

582
00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:35,181
Good. He's all yours.

583
00:27:35,448 --> 00:27:37,160
It's been a pleasure,
Mr. Trager.

584
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:38,182
Bon appetit!

585
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:42,190
No more study session?

586
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:43,502
Let's just say I
learned some things

587
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:45,070
I'm not sure I wanted to know.

588
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:46,660
Are you feeling better?

589
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:49,802
I am now.

590
00:27:57,738 --> 00:27:59,001
Kyle, you all right?

591
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,441
Yeah. What can I do to help?

592
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:03,852
We're pretty good here.
Hillary was surprisingly helpful.

593
00:28:11,377 --> 00:28:12,852
Josh, how's biology?

594
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:15,522
The medial rectus.
Jessi made sure I'll never forget it.

595
00:28:15,676 --> 00:28:17,531
She's not a very patient person,
isn't she?

596
00:28:17,585 --> 00:28:20,590
Not much, but there's no
way I'm failing that test.

597
00:28:21,688 --> 00:28:23,762
Okay, at least let
me set the table.

598
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:24,923
Okay.

599
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:29,451
<i>Do you need any help?</i>

600
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,892
Kyle. What's happening?

601
00:28:46,706 --> 00:28:48,551
- Kyle!
- Oh, no!

602
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,191
- Just step back.
- Dad!

603
00:28:50,826 --> 00:28:52,242
- Stephen.
- Dad?

604
00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:55,273
It's gonna be ok.

605
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:04,000
You're back so soon?

606
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,122
Kyle's not feeling well.

607
00:29:06,285 --> 00:29:08,180
Well, if he felt he was
coming down with a bug,

608
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:09,561
he shouldn't have
offered to tutor.

609
00:29:09,596 --> 00:29:11,400
You could've caught some...

610
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:12,590
...thing.

611
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:27,061
I remember that song.

612
00:29:27,247 --> 00:29:28,381
I haven't heard it in forever.

613
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:29,482
How do you know it?

614
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:32,370
Kyle needed it to get
through something once.

615
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:35,060
He loves it when I play.

616
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:39,242
Maybe it'll help him now.

617
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:54,053
<i>Amanda's music was a comfort.</i>

618
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,911
<i>But I still felt
lost and confused.</i>

619
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:00,361
<i>I knew Steven and
Nicole were worried...</i>

620
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:02,303
<i>Not sure how to help me.</i>

621
00:30:03,477 --> 00:30:06,633
<i>All of us were hoping
that answers were on the way.</i>

622
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:17,963
- You ready?
- No.

623
00:30:23,597 --> 00:30:25,671
- Hello. I'm...
- Adam Baylin.

624
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,703
It's so good to
finally meet you.

625
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:29,633
We've heard a lot about you.

626
00:30:29,946 --> 00:30:32,203
- Come in.
- Thank you.

627
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:39,762
- This is, uh, my husband...
- Stephen.

628
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:41,982
And Nicole.

629
00:30:42,165 --> 00:30:44,393
Kyle speaks very fondly of you.

630
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:47,063
Well, he's told us a
lot about you, too.

631
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:48,690
Yeah.

632
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,063
Not about the resemblance.

633
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:54,552
Uh...it's pretty striking.

634
00:30:56,928 --> 00:30:58,800
I didn't try to heal Andy.

635
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,713
I wouldn't. You cautioned me
against pushing myself.

636
00:31:01,907 --> 00:31:05,130
Well, using your mind to affect
another person's physiology

637
00:31:05,226 --> 00:31:07,233
is conceivable... someday.

638
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:11,140
But I don't think it's possible
at this stage of your development.

639
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:16,062
Yet...you're experiencing
strange symptoms.

640
00:31:16,485 --> 00:31:18,221
Especially my hearing.

641
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:20,733
Sounds are louder... distorted.

642
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:30,293
There must be a link
between what you're hearing

643
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:31,870
and what you've been drawing.

644
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:43,242
Where did you get this?

645
00:31:44,496 --> 00:31:46,453
Uh, someone left it for Jessi.

646
00:31:46,577 --> 00:31:47,932
We don't know who.

647
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:49,471
It was missing from the jukebox

648
00:31:49,496 --> 00:31:51,172
when we went to the diner.

649
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:52,772
Well, have you listened to it?

650
00:31:53,555 --> 00:31:55,502
- Yes.
- How often?

651
00:31:56,136 --> 00:31:57,311
A lot lately.

652
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,203
I like it. It relaxes me.

653
00:32:11,857 --> 00:32:13,401
Listen again.

654
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:17,733
You don't hear anything else?

655
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:21,512
Am I supposed to be
hearing something?

656
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:25,833
Listen carefully.

657
00:32:29,308 --> 00:32:31,862
How can you study
when your all life just change?

658
00:32:31,956 --> 00:32:34,322
Andy threatened me with my life
if I blew off placement exams

659
00:32:34,356 --> 00:32:36,061
just because she's
in remission.

660
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:38,290
She's tough.

661
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:41,031
Yeah, and without the
chemo to make her weak,

662
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:43,291
she could actually kick my ass.

663
00:32:43,815 --> 00:32:45,422
I'm just trying to
distract myself

664
00:32:45,448 --> 00:32:46,982
from figuring out what's
going on at home.

665
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:48,183
You too, huh?

666
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:50,520
Why'd they kick us out when
things were getting good?

667
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:53,923
I wanted to get a look at the
mad scientist who brewed up Kyle.

668
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,390
You say it like that,
it sounds kind of creepy.

669
00:32:56,738 --> 00:32:58,402
You know what I mean.

670
00:32:59,197 --> 00:33:00,622
The dude's smart.

671
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:02,432
I just hope he can
help Kyle figure out

672
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:03,610
What's up with
his power outage.

673
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:05,202
And all the mental brown-outs.

674
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:06,623
And all the clumsiness.

675
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:08,832
All the drawings
in primary colors.

676
00:33:08,997 --> 00:33:10,191
Lori?

677
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:14,471
You left this sweater.

678
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:17,840
Yeah, and I brought you this.

679
00:33:18,045 --> 00:33:20,921
What, did you take it upon
yourself to rewrite my song?

680
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:24,571
Well, "rewriting" implies you had more
than four chords in it to begin with.

681
00:33:24,856 --> 00:33:26,932
I'm a three-chord
wonder, remember?

682
00:33:27,018 --> 00:33:29,202
You're also a great lyricist.

683
00:33:29,276 --> 00:33:32,371
Like, rock-my-world poetic

684
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:35,271
and funny and unexpected.

685
00:33:35,987 --> 00:33:38,233
- You like my lyrics?
- I do.

686
00:33:38,646 --> 00:33:40,263
I mean, every time I try
to write my own, I kind of just...

687
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:43,052
handle the english language
like a blunt instrument?

688
00:33:44,947 --> 00:33:49,101
So, you want to help
me with the music.

689
00:33:50,846 --> 00:33:53,413
And you're going to
wow me with the lyrics.

690
00:33:53,535 --> 00:33:57,472
I'd be happy to do that
in exchange for...

691
00:33:58,015 --> 00:34:00,253
I DJ the prom.

692
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:01,883
You're killing me.

693
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:05,652
Consider it a launching platform
for our hot new single.

694
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:11,740
Lori Trager,

695
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:14,583
high school girl.

696
00:34:17,778 --> 00:34:19,100
You have a deal.

697
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:37,491
Adam thinks this record have something
to do with what's wrong with me.

698
00:34:37,928 --> 00:34:39,190
What is it about this song?

699
00:34:39,265 --> 00:34:41,022
Well, it's not the song.

700
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:44,270
It's the sounds buried
beneath the music.

701
00:34:44,986 --> 00:34:45,921
Can you hear them?

702
00:34:45,987 --> 00:34:47,503
No, I still can't.

703
00:34:47,557 --> 00:34:48,920
I can't either.

704
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,842
Well, you wouldn't be able
to perceive them, Nicole.

705
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:52,871
They're subliminal.

706
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,522
It's not a frequency
you'd be able to hear,

707
00:34:55,757 --> 00:34:57,301
but Kyle should.

708
00:35:00,036 --> 00:35:01,451
This is why you're
feeling peculiar,

709
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:03,511
and why your hearing
is exaggerated.

710
00:35:03,706 --> 00:35:06,582
Your subconscious is trying
to tell you to listen.

711
00:35:07,668 --> 00:35:09,200
Listen?

712
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:11,373
That's what the
instant message said.

713
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:19,502
You need to clear your mind,

714
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:21,961
block out any outside sound.

715
00:35:23,766 --> 00:35:24,833
And focus.

716
00:35:35,857 --> 00:35:37,453
I can hear it now.

717
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:43,882
Sarah and I used to
take this record

718
00:35:44,515 --> 00:35:47,062
and bury messages for
each other within the music.

719
00:35:47,535 --> 00:35:49,403
It was our secret game.

720
00:35:49,845 --> 00:35:52,380
We'd translate the
sounds into images.

721
00:35:52,468 --> 00:35:53,553
How?

722
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:57,941
Just like a fax machine transmits
a series of tones to send a copy.

723
00:35:58,395 --> 00:36:00,622
I fell asleep listening
to the record last night,

724
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:02,100
And then again this afternoon.

725
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:04,661
And each time after listening,
you drew those pictures.

726
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:05,970
They all seem so random.

727
00:36:06,025 --> 00:36:08,732
Well, yes, if you look
at them individually.

728
00:36:08,805 --> 00:36:10,003
But blended together...

729
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:14,411
If someone is sending Kyle
a message this way...

730
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,523
I mean, you said it was your
secret game with Sarah,

731
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:20,803
and I'm sorry,
but I thought Sarah was dead.

732
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:27,510
She is.

733
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:39,633
<i>All the drawings have been
scanned and put in order.</i>

734
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:40,703
We're ready.

735
00:36:41,187 --> 00:36:43,341
So let's hook it up
so everyone can see.

736
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,510
So, how does this work?

737
00:36:45,546 --> 00:36:48,512
Isn't it just going to be a bunch
of blobs in widescreen format?

738
00:36:48,587 --> 00:36:50,001
More like a flipbook.

739
00:36:50,185 --> 00:36:53,152
We'll use the computer to view all
450 images in rapid succession.

740
00:36:53,288 --> 00:36:55,953
and our eyes will knit together
the individual drawings

741
00:36:56,218 --> 00:36:58,460
and the colors will blend.

742
00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:00,682
We'll see what it is
I'm supposed to see.

743
00:37:09,157 --> 00:37:10,633
Try speeding it up.

744
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:12,091
No problem.

745
00:37:26,506 --> 00:37:28,002
Latnok.

746
00:37:39,195 --> 00:37:41,031
"I'm alive."

747
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:46,013
I gave Sarah a Latnok
ring with a red stone.

748
00:37:48,987 --> 00:37:50,221
It was one of a kind.

749
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:52,670
Then she must have sent this.

750
00:37:54,498 --> 00:37:55,902
It's impossible.

751
00:37:58,638 --> 00:38:00,260
She can't be.

752
00:38:11,685 --> 00:38:14,743
Bet you're looking forward
to a good night's sleep.

753
00:38:15,696 --> 00:38:17,081
I am.

754
00:38:18,406 --> 00:38:22,520
Oh, before I forget,
happy anniversary.

755
00:38:24,407 --> 00:38:26,442
I'm sorry I got ***
with your dinner.

756
00:38:27,535 --> 00:38:28,941
No worries, Kyle.

757
00:38:29,147 --> 00:38:31,440
This was definitely
a memorable one.

758
00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:33,803
- It was?
- Well, sure.

759
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:36,001
We had a house
full of teenagers,

760
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:39,610
a sick kid, a cancer remission,
a secret message,

761
00:38:39,648 --> 00:38:41,760
and a visit from a
self-healing genius

762
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:43,802
back from months in a coma.

763
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:47,041
How was it for you?

764
00:38:48,348 --> 00:38:49,842
Meeting Adam.

765
00:38:51,188 --> 00:38:54,300
Well, I know I said he
was welcome here anytime,

766
00:38:54,315 --> 00:38:58,061
but I did actually have
some anxiety about it.

767
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,152
He's not used to being
around other people,

768
00:39:00,196 --> 00:39:01,500
and the message bringing up

769
00:39:01,535 --> 00:39:02,941
all those feelings
about Sarah...

770
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:05,761
Kyle, you don't have to
make excuses for him.

771
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:12,140
It's just that you're both such
an important part of my life.

772
00:39:13,306 --> 00:39:15,842
We'll find a way to coexist.

773
00:39:16,377 --> 00:39:18,842
Don't start worrying about how Adam
will get along with the family.

774
00:39:18,907 --> 00:39:20,803
You'll stress yourself out.

775
00:39:23,816 --> 00:39:25,742
So what was it that
made you anxious?

776
00:39:28,345 --> 00:39:31,402
Adam, left us in charge
with preparing you

777
00:39:31,465 --> 00:39:34,551
for some greater purpose,

778
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:38,003
and all I could show him
today was a sick boy.

779
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:40,281
You were right
about calling him.

780
00:39:41,268 --> 00:39:44,401
Doesn't every good doctor
call in a specialist?

781
00:39:45,627 --> 00:39:47,340
I'm glad that I did.

782
00:39:48,108 --> 00:39:52,952
But I don't think I'm supposed to know
how to handle every situation.

783
00:39:54,396 --> 00:39:59,590
You're too special for me to
be able to handle all that.

784
00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:02,932
Nicole...

785
00:40:03,576 --> 00:40:06,482
I think you're special
enough to handle it all.

786
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:18,263
Hasn't everybody we know
already been here today?

787
00:40:18,758 --> 00:40:20,743
Amanda says you were coming
down with something.

788
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:22,212
You look fine to me.

789
00:40:22,388 --> 00:40:24,542
I was just tired, that's all.

790
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:29,341
Did I do something wrong?

791
00:40:31,246 --> 00:40:34,093
Something happened while
Amanda was over here.

792
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:37,590
Really, nothing did.

793
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:41,161
She came home and
played the piano.

794
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:45,721
My daughter hasn't struck a note since
she came back from the conservatory.

795
00:40:46,106 --> 00:40:48,333
Not one single
note until today.

796
00:40:49,057 --> 00:40:51,780
She did it because she knows
you love her playing.

797
00:40:53,978 --> 00:40:56,250
You have no idea how much
I've missed it.

798
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:01,330
I've missed it, too.

799
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:05,310
Well, whatever you did,
thank you, Kyle.

800
00:41:05,927 --> 00:41:08,602
I'll have to make an effort
to be less wary of you,

801
00:41:09,078 --> 00:41:12,273
even if you did come from a
juvenile detention center.

802
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:13,792
Mrs. Bloom.

803
00:41:14,658 --> 00:41:15,703
Yes?

804
00:41:17,026 --> 00:41:19,432
I know it's a lot to ask, but...

805
00:41:20,415 --> 00:41:22,501
could I take Amanda
to the prom?

806
00:41:25,218 --> 00:41:26,333
We'll see.

807
00:41:26,535 --> 00:41:29,140
And by that, I mean I
will think about it.

808
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:30,653
Maybe.

809
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:34,331
Yes.

810
00:41:34,468 --> 00:41:35,643
And don't you ever
strong-arm me

811
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:37,541
like that again, young man.

812
00:41:53,585 --> 00:41:56,593
Fortunately, this food survived
your little pyrotechnic display.

813
00:41:56,707 --> 00:41:57,652
I have no clue what it is,

814
00:41:57,686 --> 00:41:59,493
but I think someone
needs to sample it.

815
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:02,332
Uh, Stephen made that
special for Nicole.

816
00:42:02,816 --> 00:42:03,583
And?

817
00:42:03,645 --> 00:42:05,851
And maybe you should
wait till leftovers?

818
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:11,410
So, all your mental wires
are in place again?

819
00:42:11,768 --> 00:42:13,500
- I think so.
- Good.

820
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:15,872
I had enough of Kyle unplugged.

821
00:42:16,137 --> 00:42:18,301
I mean, I was getting kind
of worried about you.

822
00:42:18,817 --> 00:42:21,072
Well, I'm fine now,
so nothing to worry about.

823
00:42:25,827 --> 00:42:27,312
That's great news about Andy.

824
00:42:27,515 --> 00:42:29,672
Yeah! Amazing!

825
00:42:31,638 --> 00:42:34,131
She told me she felt better
after you hugged her.

826
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:37,340
Everyone feels
better after a hug.

827
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:39,650
But then your system
went all out of whack.

828
00:42:41,596 --> 00:42:44,002
It was just a reaction to
the message in the song.

829
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,401
You can say what you want,

830
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:52,483
but I'd like to think
that you helped her.

831
00:42:54,598 --> 00:42:56,100
<i>I spent the day
unable to be there</i>

832
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:58,081
<i>for the people I
cared about the most,</i>

833
00:42:58,655 --> 00:43:00,211
<i>yet everyone worked
to help each other</i>

834
00:43:00,257 --> 00:43:03,140
<i>when I couldn't help
them or myself.</i>

835
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:06,240
<i>The problem was never that
I'd taken on too much</i>

836
00:43:06,805 --> 00:43:08,830
<i>or caused myself stress.</i>

837
00:43:09,436 --> 00:43:10,990
<i>It was only that I didn't see</i>

838
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:12,962
<i>the simplest way to solve a problem</i>

839
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:16,040
<i>is to be sure you have
someone to help you.</i>

840
