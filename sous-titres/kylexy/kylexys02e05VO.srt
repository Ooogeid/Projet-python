1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:02,201
Previously on Kyle XY

2
00:00:02,287 --> 00:00:03,636
Adam wanted me to give you this.

3
00:00:03,716 --> 00:00:05,520
- What's the symbol?
- Never seen it before.

4
00:00:05,643 --> 00:00:07,836
- What is it?
- The company was sold this morning.

5
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:09,169
What does this mean?

6
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:10,458
I just lost my job.

7
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:13,722
XY's brain is powerful,
much like a computer.

8
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:16,546
We need what Kyle knows.
That's where she comes in.

9
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:18,111
What, like a mental hacker?

10
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:19,759
In a manner of speaking, yes.

11
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,580
She thinks that she's my sister.

12
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,556
I'm just supposed to live that lie?

13
00:00:23,636 --> 00:00:25,376
Destabilizing the boy's
support structure

14
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:27,986
will make him more vulnerable,
receptive to her.

15
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:29,572
Get her into that family's life.

16
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:32,175
My sister Jessi,
she's been having some problems,

17
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:34,515
and I was hoping you might
be able to sit down with her.

18
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:36,076
I think I might be able to help you.

19
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:37,761
Jessi's got herself a therapist.

20
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:38,916
What is this?

21
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:40,167
It's your new car.

22
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:41,616
I thought we could work on it.

23
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:43,928
Why don't you come over later?
I'll be home around 4.

24
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:47,370
If you don't show up,
then I know there's nothing left to say.

25
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,601
Where the hell is he going?

26
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,502
About Charlie...

27
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,442
I should have told you
what was going on.

28
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:10,404
Yeah, well, being someone's friend
isn't about what you should have done...

29
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:12,179
it's about what you do.

30
00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:21,954
Foss calls it sensory deprivation.

31
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:24,450
The removal of all other senses

32
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:27,062
to enhance the one sense that remains.

33
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:31,286
As I focused on the nighttime
sounds that surrounded me,

34
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:34,515
the world became more vid
than it ever had before.

35
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,348
So did the people around me.

36
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:39,088
I could sense things,

37
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:41,761
like the guilt and uncertainty
over losing a job.

38
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:48,812
Or the anxiety and self-doubt
over starting a new one.

39
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:55,421
Even staying up way past bedtime
to spend time with a new friend.

40
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:59,506
Or the first sparks of creativity...

41
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:02,539
which can't quite mask the pain
over a break-up.

42
00:02:03,695 --> 00:02:06,941
But soon the walls of the Trager house
began to disappear...

43
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:12,790
and I could hear past
the symphony of crickets...

44
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:15,900
all the way into Amanda's house

45
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:18,961
where I could hear the soft
pounding of her heart.

46
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:24,722
It seemed even a broken heart
still beats the same.

47
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,159
But there was another heartbeat.

48
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:30,510
It was different,

49
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:31,875
erratic.

50
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:44,239
- Are you all right?
- There was a man.

51
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:45,678
He's getting away.

52
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:04,203
The thing about sensory deprivation

53
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:06,764
is you can use it to enhance
any of the senses.

54
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,179
But like my hearing,

55
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:10,564
in order to increase
what my eyes could see,

56
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:12,900
I had to tune out all of
my other senses...

57
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,992
until the only thing left was my vision.

58
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,518
Otherwise I would have
heard the car start.

59
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:40,007

Season 2 Episode 5
- Come to Your Senses -

62
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:56,174
Are you okay?

63
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:57,884
Yeah...

64
00:03:58,971 --> 00:03:59,998
sort of.

65
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,278
I guess he got away?

66
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:05,413
- I tried to follow him, but...
- Detective Myatt, this is my...

67
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:07,393
daughter Amanda.

68
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,089
And you would be?

69
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:15,442
- I live next door, and I...
- Have nothing to do with this.

70
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:17,465
Mom, of course he has
something to do with this.

71
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:18,836
He chased after the guy.

72
00:04:18,922 --> 00:04:20,620
Did you get a good look at him?

73
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,759
He drove away too fast.

74
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:25,120
Did you catch the license plate number?

75
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,125
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:29,128 --> 00:04:30,535
Is there anything else missing?

77
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:34,206
Just my bracelet.

78
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:37,219
It was a gold antique charm bracelet.

79
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:40,121
It's been in my family forever.

80
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:45,863
It was a gift from my dad.

81
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:47,895
Do you mind if I take it to make a copy?

82
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:49,444
No, that's fine.

83
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:56,091
I'm sure the police will do everything
they can to find it, sweetheart.

84
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:57,861
The important thing is no one was hurt.

85
00:04:58,456 --> 00:05:00,480
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes.

86
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:04,358
You can let us deal with this
as a family.

87
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:41,158
You haven't heard from Declan
lately, have you?

88
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:42,805
No. Why?

89
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:45,756
Want him to pick up the crap
he left here, and he won't call me back.

90
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:48,061
It's like he's totally
gone off the grid.

91
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:53,151
I take it things aren't back to normal
with you and Amanda.

92
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,487
Why would you say that?

93
00:05:55,585 --> 00:05:57,127
You've got your "Amanda" look.

94
00:05:57,995 --> 00:05:59,458
I have an "Amanda" look?

95
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:01,807
Three or four.

96
00:06:02,426 --> 00:06:03,759
Which one do I have now?

97
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,791
The one every girl wants a guy
to have when he's thinking about her.

98
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:09,619
Just give her time.

99
00:06:09,742 --> 00:06:11,896
I just think we should
call the alarm company.

100
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:13,946
So they send someone out
to check out our system.

101
00:06:14,026 --> 00:06:16,055
Only thing that'd bother me
more than an intruder

102
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:18,420
would be that creep
Tom Foss showing up again.

103
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:21,993
Why do we have an alarm anyway if
we have Kyle to chase down the bad guys?

104
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,478
I wanted to talk to you about that.

105
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:25,663
Chasing after that guy?
What were you thinking?

106
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:27,624
I was thinking I wanted to catch him.

107
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,542
Well, I'm off to work.

108
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:31,824
Figure somebody in this house
should have a job.

109
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,980
You know, Josh, I happen
to be seeing my first patient today.

110
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:36,448
Great.

111
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:38,459
You're worried about
some whack job breaking in,

112
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:40,710
but inviting them in is no big deal?

113
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,354
I'm just saying...
Is it really a good idea

114
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,677
to bring your freaky patients
into your house?

115
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:49,773
No offense, Kyle.

116
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,204
That reminds me, guys.

117
00:06:52,284 --> 00:06:53,904
My patients expect privacy.

118
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,481
So my office is off limits.

119
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:56,803
So please...

120
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,179
make yourself scarce
whenever I have a session.

121
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:01,933
And my patient is not a freak.

122
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:16,981
You know that you can
turn the lights on.

123
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,555
What for?

124
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:22,207
Forget it.

125
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:26,105
Are you ready for your
first session with Dr. Trager?

126
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:31,308
Why do I have to do this?

127
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:36,077
Because you've had a hard time
since we moved here.

128
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:39,176
It's been hard for you
adjusting and making friends.

129
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:49,404
I think you're ready.

130
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:00,594
I know what you're thinking.
I've sent out a million r\sum\s,

131
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:02,430
I've talked to that headhunter.

132
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,158
And besides, this is fun.

133
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:07,104
Fine. Fine. Could you just
keep it down a little?

134
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,500
My patient will be here soon.

135
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,598
Yeah, no problem.

136
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:13,545
Besides, I wanna check out
Josh's new headset anyway.

137
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:16,901
Hair-trigger Trager!

138
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,450
Thought you were at work.

139
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,643
Hello? Is somebody talking to me?

140
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:21,794
Well, duh!

141
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:24,897
Sounds like Josh has been
smokin' more of that skunk weed.

142
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:28,885
You're hearing' voices, man!
You know that stuff makes you paranoid.

143
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:33,816
Put your hands up and step away
from the bowl, Trager!

144
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:37,578
Skunk weed?

145
00:08:50,144 --> 00:08:51,951
Hi, Emily. Please come in.

146
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:53,673
Hello.

147
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:55,223
And you must be Jessi.

148
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,759
I'm Nicole.

149
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,535
It's okay.

150
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,944
You're in good hands with Dr. Trager.

151
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:21,559
I'll be back in an hour, okay?

152
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,436
So, are you ready to get started?

153
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:32,342
Yes.

154
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:33,996
My office is right this way.

155
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,843
Just this way.

156
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:21,822
Moving to a new town can be
difficult for anyone,

157
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:25,169
but you could try to look at
this as a new beginning.

158
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:27,786
A chance to leave behind
whatever you didn't like

159
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,338
about your old life.

160
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,007
You're a blank slate.

161
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:44,087
Jessi, are you all right?

162
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:46,871
There's someone there.

163
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,672
Jessi, we're alone.

164
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,131
There's someone out there.

165
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:33,663
There you are.

166
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:36,651
The police called.
They told me they have a suspect.

167
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:39,208
Yeah. They want to see if
I can identify him.

168
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:41,581
Did they find your bracelet?

169
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:42,724
Not yet.

170
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,060
Why are you down here?

171
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,033
Detective Myatt wanted me to come down

172
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:49,790
and try and identify the car
they think the intruder used.

173
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,065
Why would people risk stealing

174
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:59,396
if they could end up here
and lose everything?

175
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,428
I guess they count on
not getting caught.

176
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:06,440
But odds are they will, eventually.

177
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:11,656
How much time will the guy that
broke into your house spend in prison?

178
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:13,629
Kyle, I don't care.

179
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,409
I just want my bracelet back.

180
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:23,459
You know, it never really mattered to me
how much it was worth.

181
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:26,840
It was the last thing my dad
gave me before he died.

182
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,069
That's what made it special.

183
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:37,548
I guess that sounds silly.

184
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:38,937
No.

185
00:12:39,896 --> 00:12:41,532
I understand.

186
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:45,158
I feel the same way about this.

187
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,502
Did you get that from your family?

188
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:56,593
Yes.

189
00:13:02,757 --> 00:13:05,235
I wish there's more I could do.
With what you've been through,

190
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:07,043
You've been through a lot, too.

191
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:09,273
Kyle, stop worrying about me.

192
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:10,817
I'm fine.

193
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,052
No, you're not.

194
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:17,961
I just want things to go back
to the way they were.

195
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:38,788
Your... your dad let me in.

196
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:40,740
How you been?

197
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:42,601
Okay.

198
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:44,597
Where you been?

199
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:46,339
Around.

200
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:50,126
Okay. Well, if you're gonna be
all vague and monosyllabic,

201
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:52,400
I mean, let's just get
the hostage trade over with.

202
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:58,013
So, is that everything?

203
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,349
Now it is.

204
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:05,944
I gave that to you for Christmas.

205
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,440
And now I'm giving it back.

206
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:10,739
You keep it.

207
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:19,842
Then we're done. I'll have
my lawyer send over the paperwork.

208
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:24,224
You know, if you ever need anything...

209
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,310
if anything ever happens...

210
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:31,128
- I'm here for you, right?
- Are you confused about

211
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:34,013
the whole dumping thing?
It kinda means I stop counting on you.

212
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:35,460
- Trager...
- It also means

213
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,271
you're no longer allowed to "Trager" me.

214
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,029
I'll walk you out, Jessi.

215
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:01,996
Let me call your sister,
tell her you're ready.

216
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:03,162
Okay.

217
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:27,945
Little help?

218
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,646
Great.

219
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:48,793
For whose pleasure?

220
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:52,278
What?

221
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,609
It says "Ribbed for her"... Nobody.

222
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:04,416
Thanks.

223
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:13,442
You...

224
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:15,606
think you could get the door for me?

225
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:24,730
I'm Declan, by the way.

226
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:33,421
"Nice to meet you, Declan.
My name's... "

227
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:41,585
Usually, that'd be where
you'd say your name.

228
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,253
Jessi.

229
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:49,098
Later, Jessi.

230
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:12,360
Does this look like the car you saw?

231
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:18,202
I guess so.

232
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:21,766
Unfortunately, this car
was stolen last week.

233
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:24,471
We found it abandoned.

234
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,967
This is incredibly detailed.

235
00:17:30,053 --> 00:17:31,861
Are you sure you didn't
see the guy's face?

236
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:34,455
Kyle, maybe you can remember
if you concentrate.

237
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:37,074
I'm sorry.

238
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:39,311
I didn't see him. I wish I did.

239
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:43,037
Well, hopefully, you can ID him.

240
00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:02,328
How'd it go?

241
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:04,201
I'm still getting my feet wet.

242
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:05,819
Good.

243
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:08,586
'Cause I'm in a little over my head.

244
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,220
Josh is smoking pot.

245
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,634
What?

246
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:16,245
How do you know?

247
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,089
I overheard his friends talking.

248
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,737
It's a long story.

249
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:22,670
How could we miss it?

250
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,265
I don't know. But I searched his room.

251
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:25,589
I couldn't find anything.

252
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:29,602
Maybe his friends were kidding.
I mean, where would Josh get pot?

253
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:36,224
What is it?

254
00:18:36,912 --> 00:18:38,437
I think we're Josh's supplier.

255
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,486
- What are you talking about?
- He found our pot stash.

256
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,946
We have a pot stash?

257
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:46,943
- Not anymore.
- Where did that come from?

258
00:18:47,023 --> 00:18:49,392
- That New Year's party.
- That was years ago.

259
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:51,495
You were supposed to get rid of that.

260
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:53,475
Oh, so it's my fault
I didn't smoke it all?

261
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:00,412
What are we gonna tell Josh?

262
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:01,834
That you have cancer.

263
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:04,297
I don't know.

264
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:06,166
We have to make sure he knows

265
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:08,293
that we're not gonna
stand for him doing drugs.

266
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:09,707
All right. So...

267
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:11,820
Good Cop/Bad Cop?

268
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,578
More like Bad Cop/Worse Cop.

269
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:14,734
All right...

270
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,320
Which one am I?

271
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:17,900
Bad Cop. You go in first.

272
00:19:17,986 --> 00:19:19,861
I'll go after, make sure
he's scared straight.

273
00:19:19,947 --> 00:19:21,656
Why do I have to go first?

274
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:24,669
All right.

275
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:25,956
I'll go first.

276
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:32,832
What happened?

277
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,892
I couldn't say which one it was.

278
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:44,876
As all the sound dropped away,

279
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:47,003
I could hear the beating of many hearts,

280
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:48,601
some faster than others.

281
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:51,355
But all pounded with the same tempo...

282
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,088
all except one.

283
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:56,307
This man's heartbeat had
a distinct arrhythmic pattern

284
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:58,301
just like the intruder
at Amanda's house.

285
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,957
They're never gonna find
who took my bracelet.

286
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:02,454
Amanda was wrong.

287
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,637
It was him.

288
00:20:03,846 --> 00:20:05,150
I was sure of it.

289
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:08,593
You two can head home.

290
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:09,970
I'll keep you posted.

291
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:16,274
I'd already told the police
I hadn't seen his face,

292
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,205
so how could I prove it?

293
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,725
They'd never believe
how I knew it was him.

294
00:20:26,845 --> 00:20:29,400
Kyle, what's wrong? Did you see the guy?

295
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:33,232
No.

296
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:35,440
But I had heard him...

297
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:36,767
and lost him...

298
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:39,247
and let Amanda down again.

299
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:53,809
You okay?

300
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:57,781
Didn't go so well at the police station?

301
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,502
No.

302
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:02,317
I thought if I could help
get the bracelet back...

303
00:21:02,403 --> 00:21:04,521
She'd forgive you for not
telling her about Charlie?

304
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:08,003
I know, It's doesn't make any sense.

305
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:09,377
It totally does.

306
00:21:09,457 --> 00:21:10,819
You want a second chance.

307
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:12,871
But all I do is disappoint her.

308
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:17,698
This is not happening.
You cannot end up like me and Declan.

309
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:19,677
This is different.

310
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:21,976
Amanda and I are just friends.

311
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,202
At least we used to be.

312
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:28,016
You've been crushing hard
on her ever since you saw her.

313
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:32,300
At least since that day at the pool,
if you know what I mean.

314
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:33,505
Don't remind me.

315
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:35,583
Tell her how you really feel.

316
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:39,601
This is the wrong time.

317
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,790
Well, if you can't tell her,
then show her.

318
00:21:41,876 --> 00:21:42,970
Get her bracelet back.

319
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:45,822
How am I supposed to do that?

320
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:48,782
Do I look like the one with the 300 IQ?

321
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:56,233
Man, I cannot wait to get
behind the wheel of this baby.

322
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:57,903
Oh, yes, you can.

323
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,954
You wanna talk to me about the pot?

324
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,639
Pot?

325
00:22:06,806 --> 00:22:09,110
I know you're smoking it.
I know where you're getting it.

326
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:12,824
And if you think you're gonna get stoned
in my house, you must still be high.

327
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:15,897
So I can get stoned
out of the house then?

328
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,668
You're gonna joke with me now?

329
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:19,795
Dad, I tried it, like, twice.

330
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:22,242
- I'm not hurting anyone.
- You're hurting yourself.

331
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:24,496
All it does is mellow me out.

332
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,168
And it's fun.

333
00:22:26,297 --> 00:22:28,275
But I guess you and Mom
already know that.

334
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:30,816
We are not talking about me or your mom.

335
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,672
This is unbelievable.

336
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:36,253
Are you gonna lecture me when you had
that shoebox stash in your closet?

337
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:38,790
Don't get me started on
the invasion of privacy thing.

338
00:22:38,884 --> 00:22:41,368
The bottom line is you are not
getting high on my watch.

339
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:42,885
What are you really pissed about?

340
00:22:43,393 --> 00:22:46,699
That I got high on your watch...
or high on your weed?

341
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,037
Okay, this is the area where
all the break-ins happened.

342
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:56,325
Big area.

343
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:59,725
Not if you know what to look for.
Or what the robber looks for.

344
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,315
All of the break-ins fit a pattern.

345
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,577
They all happened between
1:00 AM and 3:00 AM.

346
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,226
And the robber chooses houses
with secluded side entrances,

347
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:07,733
like the one at Amanda's house.

348
00:23:09,752 --> 00:23:12,040
And all of the houses he hits
have no adult male in them.

349
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,238
Nice. A thief and a chauvinist.

350
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:15,828
He doesn't like alarms, either.

351
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,097
And then there were five.

352
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:20,861
Actually, no.

353
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:22,413
He doesn't like dogs, either.

354
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,954
How do you know
that none of these other places

355
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:28,426
don't have any dogs or alarms or men?

356
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:30,211
I've read the public records.

357
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:31,461
Which public records?

358
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:34,286
All of 'em.

359
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:38,012
Well, what about our alarm?
Ever since the break-in,

360
00:23:38,092 --> 00:23:40,867
Mom and Dad have been setting it
at night, and I don't know the code.

361
00:23:41,182 --> 00:23:42,392
I can figure it out.

362
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:44,453
Will you give it to me?

363
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:46,400
Yes... if you help me.

364
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:49,837
Fine. but if I'm going
to risk sneaking out

365
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:52,679
at 1:00 in the morning,
you better be right.

366
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:55,342
This is the house.

367
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:00,330
This is so not the house.

368
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:07,419
I can't believe I snuck out of the house

369
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,745
and swiped Mom's car for this.

370
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:12,755
How much longer will we wait out here?

371
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,497
Just give it 10 more minutes.

372
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,749
You said that 10 minutes ago.

373
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,716
I promise. This is the house.

374
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,180
You're making promises
my bladder can't keep.

375
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,830
I guess I figured
you'd be better at this.

376
00:24:31,963 --> 00:24:33,420
What was that supposed to mean?

377
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:38,510
When you sneak out with Declan, you
spend most time parked in a car, right?

378
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,047
That's way different.

379
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:43,467
Why, because you're in
the back seat, not the front?

380
00:24:47,806 --> 00:24:49,442
You made a joke.

381
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:53,574
Or are just taking your frustrations out
because

382
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:56,684
somebody picked the wrong house?

383
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,676
This is the house.

384
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,250
Kyle, it takes a big man
to admit when he's wrong.

385
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:04,872
And an even bigger woman

386
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:07,039
to admit when he's right.

387
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,682
911. What's your emergency?

388
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:13,861
Um, yes, I'd like to report
a robbery in progress.

389
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,338
Hey, how's it coming?

390
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:31,587
Good.

391
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:36,335
I just need that new distributor cap
Josh was gonna pick up.

392
00:25:36,415 --> 00:25:37,416
Yeah.

393
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,976
Well, Kyle, it looks like
you're gonna be working solo

394
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,834
on this beast for a while.

395
00:25:43,596 --> 00:25:45,693
Josh tell you he was grounded?

396
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:47,510
He said you went all
broken arrow on him.

397
00:25:47,624 --> 00:25:50,036
- Is that what he was talking about?
- Without a doubt.

398
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,885
What else did he say?

399
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:59,368
That you busted him
for smoking a big fat flank.

400
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,945
- Well, you haven't been, have you?
- No.

401
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:07,663
Didn't think so. It's not good for you.
Plus, it's against the law.

402
00:26:07,996 --> 00:26:10,286
Josh said he found it in your room.

403
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:13,881
Yeah, well...

404
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,234
it's complicated.

405
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:21,357
If something's a crime for one person,

406
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:23,816
shouldn't it be a crime for everybody?

407
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,577
So, what's her glitch?

408
00:26:38,016 --> 00:26:39,852
Come on, give me the dirt
on the new girl.

409
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:42,663
Drugs? Torturing animals?
Got the urge to purge?

410
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:46,051
Why the sudden interest
in my patient's problems?

411
00:26:46,165 --> 00:26:48,796
Oh, so you admit
she does have a problem.

412
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:50,007
Interesting.

413
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:54,768
Fine. You wanna dodge
the question, okay by me.

414
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,029
I don't discuss my patients Lori.
You know that.

415
00:26:59,124 --> 00:27:01,317
But I am willing to discuss why you're

416
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:03,650
so concerned about the new girl.

417
00:27:06,285 --> 00:27:08,827
Yeah. Now who's dodging the question?

418
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:24,883
Look, Josh, I know how you feel.

419
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:26,853
No, you don't.

420
00:27:27,193 --> 00:27:29,420
- This is totally...
- Unfair?

421
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:45,072
My father, your grandpa,
was a pretty heavy drinker.

422
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:47,511
It was one of the only things
he was good at.

423
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:53,111
One day, he caught me
sneaking whiskey out

424
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,290
of his liquor cabinet,
and he tore me a new one...

425
00:27:56,726 --> 00:27:58,322
which, incidentally, was

426
00:27:58,408 --> 00:28:00,179
the other thing he was good at.

427
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:08,012
Now, he was the last person that should
be lecturing me about drinking, but

428
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,623
just because he was a hypocrite
doesn't mean he was wrong.

429
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:16,564
He taught me something...

430
00:28:18,192 --> 00:28:20,274
without even knowing it. That...

431
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:25,302
what you do is just
as important as what you say.

432
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,643
So...

433
00:28:29,627 --> 00:28:32,012
if you can't smoke up, neither can I.

434
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:33,945
That sound fair?

435
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:41,118
Unless we both agree to keep partying.

436
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,389
Not a chance.

437
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,551
Hey, how'd it go?

438
00:29:03,214 --> 00:29:05,012
Um, well, they caught the guy.

439
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:08,343
Courtesy of your friendly
neighborhood Kyle.

440
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,149
- What?
- Kyle,

441
00:29:10,263 --> 00:29:12,043
data-crunched the guy's break-in pattern

442
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:14,048
and CSI-ed where he was gonna rob next

443
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:17,153
and then "somebody"
called in an anonymous tip.

444
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:19,452
They should give us guns and badges.

445
00:29:19,565 --> 00:29:21,540
Or maybe just, like,
a really cool Taser.

446
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,737
You don't look so happy about
them catching that guy.

447
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:28,053
He admits he broke into the house,

448
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,291
but he's telling the police
he didn't steal anything.

449
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:32,397
He says he never even saw my bracelet.

450
00:29:32,477 --> 00:29:33,743
And they believed him?

451
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:37,010
No, they're still charging him
with stealing it, but...

452
00:29:37,124 --> 00:29:38,738
They found crystal meth on him.

453
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:40,536
They figure he pawned it for drug money.

454
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:44,810
I'll probably never see it again.

455
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:57,322
We don't even know if he
sold it to a pawn shop.

456
00:29:57,448 --> 00:29:58,924
What's your lucky number, Kyle?

457
00:29:59,004 --> 00:30:01,366
- I didn't know numbers could be lucky.
- Sure they can.

458
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,984
And for a lot of people,
their lucky number is seven.

459
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:06,387
That's how many pawn shops
we've been to.

460
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,655
No, really?

461
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:11,946
So you think because seven's a lucky
number, we might find her bracelet here?

462
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:15,266
I'm just saying yes, there's a good
chance we won't, but we might get lucky.

463
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:16,397
You can't give up hope.

464
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:17,687
- Is that it?
- Well,

465
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:20,219
- that's not all it is...
- No. Is that it?

466
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:22,273
Can I help you two find something?

467
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:23,446
This bracelet.

468
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:26,544
It was stolen from our neighbor's house
a couple of nights ago.

469
00:30:26,676 --> 00:30:30,598
Impossible. That bracelet's been in
this store going on there weeks now.

470
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:32,191
No, that'simpossible.

471
00:30:32,343 --> 00:30:35,483
The robbery happened Sunday night. The
man who sold you this bracelet stole it

472
00:30:35,582 --> 00:30:37,054
from our neighbor's house.

473
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:38,364
I'm not a fence, lady.

474
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:40,180
I don't deal in stolen merchandise.

475
00:30:41,222 --> 00:30:43,020
Let's see if the cops agree.

476
00:30:44,124 --> 00:30:45,485
Okay, easy, Veronica Mars.

477
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:48,059
I don't need another headache
with the cops, all right?

478
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:56,057
Well, it looks like
you're wrong on both counts.

479
00:30:56,152 --> 00:30:59,242
That bracelets been in the store
three weeks and two days,

480
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:01,139
and it wasn't pawned by a man.

481
00:31:01,253 --> 00:31:02,292
It was a woman.

482
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:04,173
No way.

483
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,334
I can't believe it.

484
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:09,060
Amanda's mom sold her bracelet.

485
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:20,617
Why would Mrs. Bloom
pawn Amanda's bracelet

486
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,793
and then say it was stolen
during the robbery?

487
00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:25,252
I guess that way she could get
the money for selling it,

488
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:27,893
plus the insurance money
for reporting it stolen.

489
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,923
She shouldn't be allowed to do that.

490
00:31:30,037 --> 00:31:31,512
Apparently, she can.

491
00:31:31,644 --> 00:31:33,215
Unless we turn her in.

492
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,035
I don't want to get
Amanda's mom in trouble.

493
00:31:36,147 --> 00:31:38,795
Good way to repay her
for all the kindness she's shown you.

494
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,498
But I guess not the best way
to get back into Amanda's good graces.

495
00:31:44,593 --> 00:31:46,921
I just want Amanda to have
the bracelet her dad gave her.

496
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:48,617
I wish there was a way we could do it

497
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:51,202
so that Amanda doesn't know
her mother hocked it.

498
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:54,472
Maybe there is.

499
00:31:57,478 --> 00:32:00,561
So, is it time to send in Worse Cop?

500
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:04,565
Actually, Worse Cop is off the clock.
Bad Cop had a talk with our suspect,

501
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:06,420
and he's agreed not to smoke up anymore.

502
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:08,643
Wow. How'd you get him to do that?

503
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:12,002
- By promising him I wouldn't either.
- Big sacrifice.

504
00:32:12,116 --> 00:32:14,048
I can't even rember the last
time you got high.

505
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:17,045
Well, marijuana does cause memory loss.

506
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:18,162
Funny.

507
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:19,749
Well, all that stuff ever made me do

508
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:21,901
was eat half the refrigerator
and fall asleep.

509
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:24,059
So my ass certainly won't miss it.

510
00:32:24,286 --> 00:32:26,311
- What are you looking for?
- My blue dress shirt.

511
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:27,607
I have a job interview.

512
00:32:27,687 --> 00:32:29,012
- Already?
- Yeah. I got a call

513
00:32:29,092 --> 00:32:31,311
- from that corporate headhunter.
- What's the job?

514
00:32:31,424 --> 00:32:34,923
Some big company wants someone to head
up their experimental software division.

515
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:37,544
It's pretty much something
I've always wanted to do.

516
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:40,437
Maybe LWK going under is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

517
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:41,874
Besides me, of course.

518
00:32:42,606 --> 00:32:43,628
Of course.

519
00:32:43,988 --> 00:32:45,711
So when do they want to see you?

520
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,319
Uh, they're setting it up right away.

521
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:49,325
Stephen, that is so great.

522
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,893
- Yeah.
- And you don't even have to worry

523
00:32:51,987 --> 00:32:53,937
if they give you a drug test.

524
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:00,996
I'm here for the charm bracelet.

525
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:05,947
- How much you got to spend?
- Not spend.Trade.

526
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:10,258
That bracelet didn't exactly
come out of a gumball machine.

527
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:13,494
If you wanna trade,
you better have something of...

528
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,412
value.

529
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:17,858
That's a beautiful stone.

530
00:33:18,374 --> 00:33:19,345
Do you mind?

531
00:33:19,425 --> 00:33:22,915
It was a gift from Adam Baylin,
and it meant a lot to me...

532
00:33:23,076 --> 00:33:24,590
but so does Amanda.

533
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:30,788
Tell you what.

534
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,394
I'm in a good mood. Even trade.

535
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,140
All right.

536
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:43,537
Here you go.

537
00:33:45,605 --> 00:33:46,709
I'll be back for that.

538
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:48,873
I'll be here.

539
00:34:08,153 --> 00:34:09,308
Amanda's not home.

540
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:11,812
Actually, I'm here to see you.

541
00:34:13,194 --> 00:34:15,094
I know you sold Amanda's bracelet.

542
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,460
I don't know what you're talking about.

543
00:34:20,983 --> 00:34:23,566
I don't have to tell her
and neither do you.

544
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:27,496
I figured you could tell her you found
it, that it wasn't stolen after all.

545
00:34:27,617 --> 00:34:28,620
Kyle?

546
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:37,082
What are you doing with my bracelet?

547
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,281
Where did you find it?

548
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:50,948
Kyle, how did you get my bracelet back?

549
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:05,022
Mom...

550
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:08,155
what's going on?

551
00:35:09,962 --> 00:35:12,217
Kyle, will you excuse us, please?

552
00:35:12,322 --> 00:35:14,630
I need to have a talk with Amanda.

553
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:17,684
Thank you.

554
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:23,698
Come on.

555
00:35:30,016 --> 00:35:31,149
Who's the letter for?

556
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:34,564
Just someone who needs help,
even if they don't realize it.

557
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:38,934
So how long are you grounded?

558
00:35:39,048 --> 00:35:41,892
Depends if they give me
time off for good behavior.

559
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,600
At least they let you out of the house.

560
00:35:44,715 --> 00:35:46,583
'Cause they know I'm with you.

561
00:35:48,587 --> 00:35:50,342
I'm not gonna narc on you.

562
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:53,129
Besides, I thought you were done
smoking that stuff anyway.

563
00:35:53,224 --> 00:35:54,827
Don't knock it 'till you rock it.

564
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:57,239
You're all about expanding your mind.

565
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:59,938
I can do that on my own. So can you.

566
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,030
Not all of us have
your brain power, dude.

567
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,541
Then you can't afford
to waste any, can you?

568
00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:17,174
Hey. Come on. I'll play you.

569
00:36:18,822 --> 00:36:20,367
I thought I was grounded.

570
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:23,715
Yeah. Inmates even get
an hour of day in the yard.

571
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:26,666
Look, Josh,

572
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:29,285
I don't want to raise you in a prison.

573
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,303
You become a man. There'll
be a lot of bumps in the road.

574
00:36:33,383 --> 00:36:35,292
I know where a lot of those bumps are.

575
00:36:36,134 --> 00:36:39,042
So if you're straight with me,
I promise I'll be straight with you.

576
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,419
It'll make both our lives a lot easier.

577
00:36:46,342 --> 00:36:47,372
All right.

578
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:52,618
Josh, where ya been?

579
00:36:52,729 --> 00:36:55,775
That ganja really must have
put you in dry-dock.

580
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:00,549
Hey, man, who's "Itchy-Trager Finger?"

581
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:07,164
that's my dad.

582
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:17,190
So you still wanna play me?

583
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:21,473
Hey, just 'cause I can't smoke pot
doesn't mean I can't smoke you.

584
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:31,930
Go mow the lawn. Now.

585
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,223
Yes, sir. I think our
patient's first session went very well.

586
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,775
- Has she met the boy?
- Not yet.

587
00:37:44,073 --> 00:37:46,377
Find out who he knows,
what he does with his time.

588
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,000
Get her into his world.

589
00:37:48,743 --> 00:37:50,459
Her sole focus should be Kyle.

590
00:37:50,612 --> 00:37:51,623
Yes, sir.

591
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,746
By now I knew Amanda's heartbeat
well enough

592
00:38:10,826 --> 00:38:12,678
to know it was her outside my door.

593
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:18,079
Room in there for two?

594
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,371
I wanna thank you for
getting my bracelet back.

595
00:38:30,286 --> 00:38:33,052
Especially after the way
my mom treated you.

596
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:35,620
Since my dad died,

597
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:40,784
we've been having money troubles.
And I know that's no excuse, but

598
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:42,587
at least you can see why she did it.

599
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,025
Amanda, you don't have to
explain anything to me.

600
00:38:45,124 --> 00:38:47,447
But I want you to know she called
the police and told them

601
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,050
the bracelet wasn't stolen.

602
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:51,160
- That's good.
- She was just...

603
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,553
too proud to admit that
we were in trouble.

604
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:58,219
I guess she was scared of me
finding out the truth.

605
00:39:00,776 --> 00:39:02,841
But I'm tougher than people think.

606
00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:06,038
I know.

607
00:39:10,363 --> 00:39:12,612
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

608
00:39:14,694 --> 00:39:17,781
You kept my mom's secret because
you were trying to protect me.

609
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:22,134
Like you were trying to protect me
by not telling me about Charlie.

610
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,035
The really stupid part is...

611
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:32,183
I wasn't even mad at you.

612
00:39:33,293 --> 00:39:36,954
This whole time, I was mad at myself for
almost sleeping with that stupid cheat.

613
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,253
You mean you didn't sleep with him
the night of the bonfire?

614
00:39:43,363 --> 00:39:44,474
No.

615
00:39:48,925 --> 00:39:51,119
Kyle, you've done so much for me.

616
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,464
Let me do this for you.

617
00:39:58,912 --> 00:40:02,002
It's the money my mom got
for selling the bracelet.

618
00:40:02,394 --> 00:40:04,244
We both want you to have it.

619
00:40:05,007 --> 00:40:06,408
So you can get your ring back.

620
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,849
How did you know?

621
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:16,687
Because you're the kind of
person who would give something up

622
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:19,859
just to get back something
important for someone else.

623
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,041
I can't take this.

624
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,604
You know how you said...

625
00:40:41,302 --> 00:40:44,547
you just wanted things to go back
to the way that they were?

626
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:49,133
That's all I want.

627
00:40:56,907 --> 00:40:58,674
I don't want that anymore.

628
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:03,528
I want things to be better.

629
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,417
As I held Amanda in my arms,

630
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:17,252
I realized that as much
as I liked to hear her heartbeat,

631
00:41:17,505 --> 00:41:19,622
it was even better to feel it.

632
00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:26,587
I guess mistakes are
really second chances,

633
00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:29,497
even if they don't seem
that way at the time.

634
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:41,158
The thief didn't know it, but the drugs
had damaged his heart,

635
00:41:41,272 --> 00:41:44,116
giving him the irregular
heartbeat that gave him away.

636
00:41:47,943 --> 00:41:49,545
But getting caught...

637
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,230
just might have saved his life.

638
00:41:56,969 --> 00:41:59,361
It's not in there, kid. Your ring?

639
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,750
I sold it.

640
00:42:01,638 --> 00:42:02,779
Sold it?

641
00:42:03,336 --> 00:42:04,786
It's the damnedest things.

642
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:07,756
I haven't sold a ring out of that case
in... gotta be six months.

643
00:42:08,663 --> 00:42:10,743
Couldn't keep yours in there
more than a few hours.

644
00:42:10,852 --> 00:42:11,864
Who bought it?

645
00:42:13,008 --> 00:42:16,074
Someone who paid me a lot of
money to lose the receipt.

646
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:26,239
That means a lot to me, sir.
I can't wait to be a part of the team.

647
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:29,765
Well, you won't have to.
We want you to start right away.

648
00:42:30,204 --> 00:42:31,730
Welcome to Madacorp.

649
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:35,980
Thank you.
