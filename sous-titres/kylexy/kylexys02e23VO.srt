1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,027
<i>Prevously on Kyle XY...</i>

2
00:00:02,227 --> 00:00:03,528
Will you go to the prom with me?

3
00:00:03,728 --> 00:00:05,177
Yes, I would love to go with you.

4
00:00:05,277 --> 00:00:07,782
You don't wear a tuxedo to a funeral.
You wear one to a prom.

5
00:00:07,982 --> 00:00:09,751
Didn't you once tell me
that going to a prom

6
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:11,328
would be a fate worse than death?

7
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:14,232
I'm not asking you to go to prom
'cause there's no one else.

8
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:17,626
I'm asking 'cause you are
the only one I want to go with.

9
00:00:17,826 --> 00:00:19,680
Are you telling me there are
problems with the prom?

10
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:22,290
Prom committee's become a nightmare
of mix-ups with the decorators

11
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:23,638
and arguments with the caterers.

12
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:25,552
I want prom to be
this perfect night with Kyle,

13
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:27,391
and all I can think about
is table and chair rentals

14
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:28,910
and non-refundable deposits.

15
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:30,312
Well, you should enter
this in the contest.

16
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:31,110
I suppose.

17
00:00:31,218 --> 00:00:34,250
Although I'm sure three-chord
trite piece of crap will win.

18
00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:36,472
Brian told me all about
the girl in the pictures, Sarah.

19
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:39,422
<i>He said he created me from Sarah's
genetic material after she died.</i>

20
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,470
- My name is Sarah.
- She's alive.

21
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:43,530
She wants to meet me, right?

22
00:00:43,637 --> 00:00:45,912
- Sarah said she'd be here.
- She's not coming.

23
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,571
- I'm alone!
- You're not alone.

24
00:00:50,777 --> 00:00:51,572
Jessi!

25
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:53,893
<i>Her heart has stopped.

26
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:59,093
It's okay now. I'm here.

27
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:02,171
The people in Latnok aren't bad,
they're simply scientists

28
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:04,381
<i>with a very clinical point of view.</i>

29
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:06,420
<i>He's incredible.</i>

30
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:09,913
<i>More than we'd ever dreamed
we'd see in our lifetimes.</i>

31
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,773
What are you watching?

32
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:29,040
"If you're not back by midnight,

33
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:30,930
you won't be coming home."

34
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,093
That's not good.

35
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:39,213
Why on earth would you watch
Prom Night? It's scary.

36
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,760
It's video research for the prom.

37
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:43,331
You're researching the prom?

38
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,011
And it led you to Prom Night?

39
00:01:45,116 --> 00:01:47,000
It had the most straightforward title.

40
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:48,861
What else did you look at?

41
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:53,473
44 movies, 2.6 million websites
and 37 young-adult novels.

42
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,842
"Prom is the most romantic moment
in a young person's life.

43
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:58,572
"It's the culmination of adolescence

44
00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:00,843
and marks the beginning of
the journey into adulthood."

45
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:04,293
Pricilla's perfect prom.
I love that book!

46
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:07,561
I wasn't always a cynic.

47
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:09,982
I know how important it is to Amanda.

48
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:11,691
I can't let her down.

49
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:13,402
I just need the perfect plan.

50
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:15,901
There's really no formula
for perfection.

51
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:18,830
Let me let you in
on a little life secret.

52
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:21,380
The more you expect,
the more you get let down.

53
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:22,931
Pricilla's prom was a disaster.

54
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:24,680
Her date leaves her
at the end of the night.

55
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:26,780
Two chapters later, he's gay.

56
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:28,771
Nice pep talk.

57
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,200
Just focus on having fun,
and you will.

58
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:33,582
Don't let your expectations
get the best of you.

59
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:37,930
<i>Expectations.</i>

60
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:40,572
<i>To them, the word implied
inevitable failure.</i>

61
00:02:40,676 --> 00:02:43,743
<i>Was it wrong to have faith
that things could turn out well?</i>

<b>Kyle XY
2x23 - I've Had the Time of My Life</b>

65
00:02:55,198 --> 00:02:57,331
I'm not sure which was
more difficult to process,

66
00:02:57,435 --> 00:02:59,780
the news that Sarah's alive

67
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:02,233
or that you brought Jessi
back from the dead.

68
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,121
Has Sarah tried to contact you?

69
00:03:04,228 --> 00:03:06,623
No. And she won't.

70
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:10,502
She's put her past behind her, Kyle,

71
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:13,311
and I've accepted that
I need to do the same.

72
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:16,562
Your leg is better.

73
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:18,640
Yeah. It's good as new.

74
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:21,162
Just in time for me to move on.

75
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:23,401
Move on?

76
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,470
Kyle, I wasn't pleased that Latnok

77
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:30,903
was willing to test Jessi like
some kind of a laboratory rat.

78
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:35,780
It made me realize just how out of touch
we all are with our own humanity.

79
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:38,923
So I need a break from
the Latnok community.

80
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:41,923
And I asked them to give you a break.

81
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:44,210
For me?

82
00:03:44,747 --> 00:03:45,942
I haven't even met them.

83
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:48,490
Well, they've been watching you
for a while,

84
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:53,171
waiting for an opportunity to take
a larger role in your development.

85
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:55,000
They've been watching me?

86
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:57,461
Believe me,
I wasn't happy about it either.

87
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,901
But I've made it very clear to them

88
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,073
that you have a whole lifetime
to be extraordinary.

89
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:07,181
Now is the time for you to be...
ordinary.

90
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:11,540
So I'd ask you to come along with me,

91
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:14,441
but I think we both know
what your answer would be.

92
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:18,610
It doesn't bother you that
I wouldn't want to leave the Tragers?

93
00:04:20,957 --> 00:04:22,583
I'll be back one day

94
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:25,202
when it's time for us
to resume out training.

95
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:27,323
In the meantime,

96
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:31,123
I want you to stay here
and enjoy what I never had.

97
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:33,461
What's that?

98
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,103
A life.

99
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:39,890
My sunset backdrop is a no-show,

100
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:41,643
so I don't think this gym
is gonna be transformed

101
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,780
into the ocean paradise that I want.

102
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:45,451
We still have time.
Maybe there's something...

103
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:47,052
Kyle, really, I know I made a huge deal

104
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:48,572
about the whole magic of prom,

105
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:51,502
but I'll be happy
if it wasn't a huge disaster.

106
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:54,310
This would be so much more fun
if we were allowed to inhale.

107
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:56,710
Will you guys please
get him out of here?

108
00:04:57,058 --> 00:04:58,373
Amanda, I don't think
I should leave you here

109
00:04:58,476 --> 00:04:59,532
to deal with this by yourself.

110
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:01,732
Kyle, I have 27 perfectly capable people

111
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:03,342
to help me hang lame streamers.

112
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:05,820
I, for one, am happy to pass
the helium torch.

113
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:09,312
Good. Save your energy
for the end of tonight.

114
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:12,060
Your sugar mama's got big plans for you.

115
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:14,013
Is there anything else I can do?

116
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:16,890
- No.
- That was a lie.

117
00:05:17,126 --> 00:05:19,382
You've just been busted
by the human lie detector.

118
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:21,051
Fess up, little lady.

119
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:24,470
- Okay, if you really want to help.
- I really want to.

120
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:26,853
You can pick up my dress
from the cleaners.

121
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:29,430
There was this whole...
well, it's a long story, but...

122
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:31,193
I'd be happy to.

123
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:36,173
You don't have to bring everything.

124
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:39,050
We can start fresh.
I can get you some new clothes.

125
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:40,221
Why?

126
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:44,011
Because of the memories
of Taylor not being exactly...

127
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:45,353
A good father?

128
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:49,241
I'm glad he left.

129
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:52,033
But I like my clothes.

130
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:53,740
I even like this room.

131
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:56,263
It's the first place
I've ever been able to call mine.

132
00:05:58,588 --> 00:06:00,601
Now this brings back memories.

133
00:06:00,706 --> 00:06:01,800
Good ones?

134
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:04,400
Good at the time.

135
00:06:05,556 --> 00:06:08,481
Sometimes I wonder if
it's worth having good memories.

136
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:12,453
When things go wrong,
you almost resent the happy moments,

137
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,061
like they failed you.

138
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:16,733
That picture reminds me of Kyle

139
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:19,460
and everything
we've been through together.

140
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:22,202
I hope I never have to resent that.

141
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:25,181
Yeah, I hope you never have to.

142
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:31,310
<i>Jessi, I think
we should leave Seattle.</i>

143
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:33,510
Where would we go?

144
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:36,948
I don't know.
Somewhere, anywhere else.

145
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:38,822
Because of Latnok?

146
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:42,061
I don't know. Maybe.

147
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,030
Seattle was a cage for me for 20 years,

148
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,260
and being back here,
I feel trapped.

149
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:52,582
Would that be okay with you?

150
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:54,970
Yeah. Of course.

151
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:58,532
Andy says she has big plans for me.

152
00:06:58,637 --> 00:07:00,083
You know what that means, don't you?

153
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,793
This dress is silver.

154
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:03,781
Dude, you already said that.
It's not important.

155
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,612
It's supposed to be yellow.

156
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:08,191
We're talking about me now, dude.

157
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:10,641
Sorry. What does it mean?

158
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:12,730
It means I need to be ready
to round the bases.

159
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:14,380
Round the bases?

160
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:16,322
Prom night often results in extra bases,

161
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:18,881
and considering I slid in to second
with Andy a few weeks ago,

162
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:22,012
I'm looking at third base,
if not an inside-the-park home run.

163
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:24,571
Josh, you should know by now, I have
no idea what you're talking about.

164
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:26,811
Sex. I'm talking about sex.

165
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,812
Yeah, and I've never... you know.

166
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:33,791
- Had it.
- With another person.

167
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:36,331
Never mind.

168
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:39,002
The importance of
prom night sex was portrayed

169
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:40,691
in 82% of the movies I watched.

170
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:41,662
See?

171
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:43,430
But since 17% of them also ended with

172
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:45,462
young teens being fatally mutilated,

173
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:47,783
I assumed it was a cinematic convention.

174
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:48,971
Afraid not, buddy.

175
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:50,501
For much of the adolescent universe,

176
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:52,960
the whole dance
is basically just foreplay.

177
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,662
Is sex part of
the perfect prom equation?

178
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:57,552
Don't you worry about it.

179
00:07:57,656 --> 00:07:59,463
Something tells me
that sex isn't part of

180
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:02,022
yours and Amanda's g-rated prom fantasy.

181
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:04,300
What is it?

182
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:05,971
Nothing.

183
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:10,052
Uh, no.

184
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:12,403
No line-dance songs. Come on.

185
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:13,470
- What?
- Ah!

186
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,982
- You know it's inevitable.
- Not if I can help it.

187
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:17,490
Come on!

188
00:08:18,438 --> 00:08:19,810
It's a prom must-do.

189
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,022
Yeah, then I think I must puke.

190
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:26,280
Are you sure you don't want
to just dj the prom yourself?

191
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,920
Please. Have you seen
those geeks that dj the proms?

192
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:31,972
Ha ha ha! Hilarious.

193
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:34,663
Besides, I'm supposed to be
having the time of my life, remember?

194
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:37,080
Oh, you mean the lyric
you actually neglected

195
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:38,583
to include in your theme song?

196
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:40,150
It's been done.

197
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:43,590
Besides, you and I both know
that there's zero chance

198
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,411
of winning that contest tonight,

199
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:49,030
with my reedy voice and
the 12th-rate acoustic recording.

200
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:51,473
Wow. You're really not
expecting much, are you?

201
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:54,482
The thing about expectations...

202
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,653
You know what? Forget it.

203
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:58,810
I've already busted out
that speech once today.

204
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:01,032
So jaded for so young.

205
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:03,561
Enough with the young already.

206
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:07,340
<i>What's all this?</i>

207
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:09,970
Amanda changed her dress,

208
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:12,541
so the vest and the corsage
I choose don't match,

209
00:09:12,647 --> 00:09:14,432
unless I dye them.

210
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:15,962
Well, can I help?

211
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:18,271
I know this may surprise you,

212
00:09:18,377 --> 00:09:20,991
but I used to be kinda good
at arts and crafts.

213
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,681
I stripped the silver nitrate
off some old rolls of film

214
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:28,503
and combined it with
aluminum potassium sulfate.

215
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:32,111
But I'm having trouble stabilizing
the polyvalent metal ions

216
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:34,880
needed to act as a mortar
to set the dye pigment.

217
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:38,003
I once made a house
out of popsicle sticks.

218
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:42,990
The dye is too dark and
won't stick properly to the fabric.

219
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:46,080
Oh. Well, I'm sure Amanda
will understand.

220
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:50,891
She will understand.
That's the problem.

221
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:53,522
She's already given up
hope of having a good prom,

222
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:54,972
but she shouldn't.

223
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:57,432
I just wanna make sure
it's everything she wished for.

224
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:59,810
Well, don't put too much pressure
on yourself.

225
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:01,813
Sometimes trying too hard to make
things perfect

226
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,543
can blow up in your face.

227
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,112
- Hey.
- How are you?

228
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:19,141
Alive... thanks to you.

229
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,851
You've made a mess.

230
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,410
I don't know why
the formula didn't work.

231
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:32,390
Let me see what I can do.

232
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:41,603
What are you looking for?

233
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:46,163
Adam said Latnok is watching me.

234
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:49,251
He told them to stop, but I still feel
like someone's out there.

235
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:52,550
I think Latnok is creepy.
So does Sarah.

236
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:57,523
How have things been going with her?

237
00:10:58,765 --> 00:10:59,951
New.

238
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:01,493
Exciting.

239
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:03,501
A little scary.

240
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:06,000
She wants to leave town.

241
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:09,441
- Why?
- To start over.

242
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:10,650
Jessi.

243
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:12,533
No, it's okay.

244
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:14,853
Sarah really wants this.

245
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:16,882
Well, what do you want?

246
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,950
I want what you have.

247
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:20,982
A family.

248
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:24,770
Have you told her
that you'd rather stay?

249
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:26,790
- No, I can't do that.
- Why not?

250
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,981
Because what if she leaves anyway?

251
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,490
Jessi...

252
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:37,333
Not everyone who cares about
you is going to disappoint you.

253
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,522
All I know is I'm being given
a chance to have a real life.

254
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,611
I'm not gonna do anything to mess it up.

255
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:47,661
You're missing about
ten milligrams of nickel iodine.

256
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:58,273
Oh, good. I need to talk to you.

257
00:11:58,376 --> 00:11:59,763
Now's not the best time, dad.

258
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:02,050
Well, it's never an appropriate time
for a man

259
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:05,051
to warn his daughter not to get involved
with his teaching assistant,

260
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,611
and yet, here we are.

261
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:09,092
I'm not getting involved with Mark.

262
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:11,432
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm in a towel

263
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:13,382
getting ready for prom with Declan.

264
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:17,413
A much better age-appropriate,
all-around good choice I'm thinking.

265
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:20,843
My year of strumming sad chords
was sponsored by Mr. Declan McDonough.

266
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:23,960
Not to mention his role
in my disappearing reappearing virtue.

267
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:25,273
And about that...

268
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:28,393
Don't worry, dad. Store's closed.

269
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:29,741
What store?

270
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,060
Tragerporium is locked tight.

271
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,453
No weekend sales,
no limited time offers.

272
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:35,940
Security system's armed.

273
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:38,161
Guard dogs are roaming the aisle.

274
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:40,191
Of course we're still encouraging
window shopping,

275
00:12:40,297 --> 00:12:41,730
cause you always wanna keep
the public interested.

276
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:43,623
But I can assure you
that tonight will not be about sex.

277
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,260
I thought prom
was basically just foreplay

278
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:46,623
for much of the adolescent universe.

279
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:48,202
- Says who?
- Josh.

280
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:50,120
- Josh?
- What's up?

281
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:52,891
Not you, that's for sure.

282
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:54,031
What?

283
00:12:54,136 --> 00:12:55,963
There'll be no sex had by you.

284
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:57,462
Not...any of you.

285
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:00,510
Not tonight, tomorrow,
or hopefully in my lifetime.

286
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:12,603
Smile.

287
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:16,710
- What did you do?
- What? Is it that obvious?

288
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:18,553
Last time you had that look,

289
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:21,352
you realized Josh just found
your old pot stash.

290
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:25,501
Okay, so which parental sin
did you commit?

291
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:27,523
The "don't blow the sex talk" one.

292
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:28,950
We already had that talk with Lori.

293
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:31,381
I'm not talking about Lori,
or Kyle either.

294
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:32,652
Josh?

295
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:34,210
Oh, Stephen, he's not ready.

296
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:35,450
I know.

297
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:37,380
Well, you have to go back up
and talk to him again.

298
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:39,081
- I know.
- So why aren't you moving?

299
00:13:39,305 --> 00:13:39,953
I don't know.

300
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:43,462
You only have a small window
of opportunity to correct this.

301
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:46,593
I can't do it.

302
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,821
Yes. Yes, you can.

303
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:51,772
You can. You are a smart, educated,

304
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:53,593
progressive, thoughtful man,

305
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:56,201
and...and... an excellent father.

306
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:58,112
Don't psych yourself out.

307
00:13:59,408 --> 00:14:00,530
Just go.

308
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,910
Hey, it looks like
all the stains came out.

309
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:10,381
Thank you for coming over to help out.

310
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:12,510
How can I pass up my last opportunity

311
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,620
to prove that I'm smarter than you?

312
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:16,802
Very funny.

313
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:21,162
I'm not, you know, smarter.

314
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:24,791
I just try harder to impress people.

315
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:26,723
But you already knew that.

316
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:30,312
You don't have to do that anymore.

317
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:34,691
You never have to prove yourself
to anyone ever again.

318
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,083
If anything,

319
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:40,150
people should start proving
themselves to you.

320
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:42,823
You really don't want
to see me leave, do you?

321
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,930
You're my friend, Jessi.

322
00:14:47,895 --> 00:14:49,450
I don't want to lose you.

323
00:15:01,096 --> 00:15:02,973
I have your dress.
It's not yellow.

324
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:06,240
I know, the dry cleaners accidentally
shredded my original dress,

325
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:08,270
so I had to make a last-minute switch.

326
00:15:08,378 --> 00:15:10,020
At least now I'll match the gym.

327
00:15:10,128 --> 00:15:11,853
How are things going down there?

328
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:12,892
Almost done.

329
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:15,101
But would you mind dropping
the dress off at school?

330
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,960
At the school?
Won't you be home soon?

331
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,680
I'm just taking some precautions.

332
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:20,841
You know, in case the decorations
committee hits a snag

333
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:22,473
and I have to get ready here.

334
00:15:22,575 --> 00:15:23,541
I'm coming to help you.

335
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:26,292
Kyle, don't. I'm dirty and a mess.

336
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:28,120
And even though everything else
is a bust right now,

337
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:30,172
I don't want you
to see me until I'm ready.

338
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:31,380
Just send the dress.

339
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:32,221
But I...

340
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:33,671
Promise me you won't come in.

341
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:35,923
I promise.

342
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:38,100
Good.

343
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:46,970
It's still wet.

344
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,443
I'll take care of it.

345
00:15:50,385 --> 00:15:52,101
I should at least take it
to her and explain.

346
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:54,891
Kyle, you need to get ready.

347
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:58,382
I'll finish the dress,
and I'll take it to Amanda.

348
00:15:58,688 --> 00:15:59,983
It will all be okay.

349
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:03,273
You want to do something nice
for Amanda?

350
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:06,493
No, but I'd like to do something nice
for you.

351
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:12,872
Come in.

352
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,201
What's with the shades?

353
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:23,251
All the makeup, like,
ever, is on your face.

354
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:25,372
I wanna look "va va voomy" for Josh,

355
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:27,723
but I keep coming up
with vampire clown whore.

356
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:29,490
Can you help me?

357
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,372
You have two moms. Doesn't one
of them wear a little lip-gloss?

358
00:16:32,476 --> 00:16:35,761
My moms think that makeup
is an ageist, sexist ploy

359
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:38,243
to devalue the feminine form
in its natural state

360
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:41,680
perpetuating unrealistic myths
and expectations.

361
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:44,681
Yeah. Well... maybe it is.

362
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:46,761
Come here.

363
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:12,063
Nice job.

364
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,230
I downloaded an instructional diagram.

365
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:17,013
Stephen will be disappointed
he wasn't able to help you.

366
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,003
The ultimate father/son prom ritual.
I forgot.

367
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:22,603
No, no, no, no.
Don't worry about Stephen.

368
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:25,393
Don't worry about anyone but yourself.

369
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:27,211
And Amanda.

370
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:28,492
And Amanda.

371
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:31,622
Oh. Beautiful.

372
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:35,962
I got it from the rose garden
where we had our first kiss.

373
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:37,620
You thought of everything.

374
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:39,723
I tried.

375
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:44,440
Don't forget to stop and smell the roses
every so often yourself tonight.

376
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:47,450
Actually double-dyeing
the corsage eliminated the scent of...

377
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:50,740
You mean to focus less
on making things perfect

378
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:52,213
and more on having a good time.

379
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:53,351
Yes.

380
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:56,100
Look at you.

381
00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:00,681
When you first came here,

382
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,171
everything in the world was new.

383
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:05,243
Look at all you've learned.

384
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:07,633
Look at all you've overcome.

385
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,310
Tonight's a celebration of that.

386
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,080
Just breathe and enjoy it.

387
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:17,221
I'm sorry you had to
say good-bye to Adam.

388
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:23,252
He's doing what
he thinks is best for me.

389
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:26,321
Still, I know it's hard
to say good-bye to family.

390
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:30,710
Adam created me.

391
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:34,780
He's my mentor and my friend.

392
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:39,053
But you are my family.

393
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:56,771
Your decorations are ugly.

394
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:59,371
They'll look better once
we turn the lights down.

395
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:07,453
All right. Fine. It sucks.

396
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:09,202
It's like Charlie Brown's
Christmas tree.

397
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,620
I don't know what that means.

398
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:12,620
Ugly. It means ugly.

399
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:15,591
And everyone else left,
so I don't have time to go home.

400
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:17,553
I have to get ready here.

401
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:22,860
I just wanted to make it special
for Kyle, but I blew it.

402
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:27,243
Anyways, thanks for the dress.

403
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,200
Did you deliver the dress?

404
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:40,021
Your prom is going to be terrible.

405
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:42,331
Why?

406
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:45,050
Well, the decorations are a disaster,

407
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:47,350
and Amanda has to get ready
in the school locker room.

408
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,032
Why didn't she ask me for help?

409
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:51,151
She wanted to make it special for you.

410
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:52,792
She did?

411
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:54,891
Maybe if you two stopped working so hard

412
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:56,953
to make it special,
you'd enjoy it more.

413
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,540
Or maybe there's still something
I can do to fix it.

414
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:01,560
I figured you'd say something like that.

415
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,061
Which is why you called.
Thank you.

416
00:20:04,825 --> 00:20:07,003
This doesn't mean I like her,
by the way.

417
00:20:07,618 --> 00:20:08,660
I know.

418
00:20:20,617 --> 00:20:22,193
<i>Thanks to Jessi,
I had an idea</i>

419
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:24,431
<i>of how to make Amanda's night
a little better.</i>

420
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:27,111
<i>Her expectations may have disappeared,</i>

421
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,660
<i>but my desire to surpass them hadn't.</i>

422
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,862
Could this day get any worse?

423
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,361
Not funny.

424
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:42,142
I thought, uh, you could use
some help getting ready.

425
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:45,432
What?

426
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,972
Did you poison my makeup
or put fleas in my dress?

427
00:20:48,077 --> 00:20:50,130
I think you like being mean to me.

428
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:53,092
Well, that's just a little bit of the pot
calling the kettle black, now, isn't it?

429
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:54,593
The pot and the kettle are black.

430
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:55,842
My point exactly.

431
00:20:56,976 --> 00:20:59,293
Well, after tonight,
it doesn't matter anyway.

432
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:00,721
What's that supposed to mean?

433
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,332
It means I'm leaving town.

434
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:06,393
I'm sorry to hear that.

435
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:09,581
Why? You hate me.

436
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,811
But I know how important
you are to Kyle.

437
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:14,672
And when you care about somebody,

438
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,393
you wanna put their feelings first.

439
00:21:20,457 --> 00:21:21,800
So how's it going?

440
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,510
All set.

441
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:29,810
You have to scuff the bottom
of your shoes before you walk in them.

442
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:32,473
- Helps give you traction.
- Yeah. I didn't know that.

443
00:21:32,577 --> 00:21:34,240
Actually, I didn't either.
Kyle told me.

444
00:21:34,348 --> 00:21:36,532
The prom know-it-all strikes again.

445
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,850
- So, listen...
- Please don't.

446
00:21:39,956 --> 00:21:41,383
I have to.

447
00:21:41,598 --> 00:21:43,282
Then could you make it quick
and painless, please?

448
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,682
All right. You want it quick
and painless? Don't use this.

449
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:47,463
You don't want me to have safe sex?

450
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:48,362
No.

451
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,800
I... I mean yes,

452
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:52,980
I do want you to have safe sex,

453
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:54,870
but, no, I don't want you
to have sex at all.

454
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:57,013
I'd much rather you wait untill
you know you're ready,

455
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:59,490
untill you and Andy know you're ready.

456
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:02,410
It'll mean a whole lot more if you do.

457
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:06,573
But if you decide
to ignore everything I say

458
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:08,470
and make you own monumentally
life-altering

459
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,332
no-going-back decision to have sex,

460
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:13,752
forever changing the relationship
you have with Andy,

461
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:16,230
then I want you to be protected.

462
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:19,141
Can I go now?

463
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,443
Yes.

464
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:23,220
Whoa. Hold up.

465
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,412
A little screwy loop here.

466
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:31,393
Okay.

467
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:33,792
Good to go.

468
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,422
- Thanks, dad.
- You're welcome.

469
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:42,043
Hey, handsome.

470
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:45,712
So how was the talk, part two?

471
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:48,870
Well, a little like that condom
I just gave our son.

472
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,272
Clumsy, awkward,
but hopefully effective.

473
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:55,332
Are you sure you're okay with missing
your dinner to help with my plan?

474
00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:56,991
Do you think for one minute
that Lori Trager

475
00:22:57,096 --> 00:22:59,411
would let us miss an opportunity
to help you and Amanda?

476
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:02,511
We're skipping
the pre-prom dinner? Sweet!

477
00:23:02,655 --> 00:23:04,350
You were paying for that part,
weren't you?

478
00:23:04,455 --> 00:23:05,350
I was indeed.

479
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:06,640
What's taking them so long?

480
00:23:06,747 --> 00:23:09,091
I've been gorgeous for hours already.

481
00:23:09,497 --> 00:23:12,122
Let's go, people!
We have a prom to save!

482
00:23:12,706 --> 00:23:14,792
You are ruining our entrance.

483
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,743
- Lori, you look...
- Yeah, yeah.

484
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:21,820
Josh?

485
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:23,801
What you are about to experience

486
00:23:24,007 --> 00:23:27,132
is a defining moment
in your otherwise idiotic life.

487
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:29,721
Do not mess it up.

488
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,443
Looking good, Trager.

489
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:35,322
Not bad yourself, Mcdonough.

490
00:23:35,428 --> 00:23:36,630
Where's...

491
00:23:39,555 --> 00:23:40,522
Andy.

492
00:23:50,927 --> 00:23:52,822
<i>All my research had been right.</i>

493
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:55,583
<i>No matter what anyone said
about expectations,</i>

494
00:23:55,818 --> 00:23:59,623
<i>everyone secretly hoped this would be
the best night of their lives.</i>

495
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:01,751
Oh, my God!

496
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,073
<i>I knew that more than
just helping Amanda,</i>

497
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:08,263
<i>my night had just become about
making sure everyone got their wish.</i>

498
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:20,972
You did that on purpose.

499
00:24:21,446 --> 00:24:22,400
Maybe.

500
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,232
- Really?
- Yeah.

501
00:24:29,227 --> 00:24:30,493
Jessi helped me.

502
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:31,910
You did?

503
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,581
Well, I didn't want to,
but she was really pathetic.

504
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:37,113
Thanks.

505
00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:38,142
You're welcome.

506
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:39,672
Okay. Good to know
a little girl-bonding

507
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:41,291
didn't upset the balance of nature.

508
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:45,262
- What time is it?
- Relax. We're here early.

509
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:47,013
Kyle's waiting for you in the gym.

510
00:24:56,055 --> 00:24:57,921
You've gone soft.

511
00:24:58,636 --> 00:25:00,492
I had a near-death experience.

512
00:25:01,086 --> 00:25:03,792
It's gonna take me a few days
to return to normal.

513
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,413
Hi.

514
00:26:01,355 --> 00:26:02,241
Hi.

515
00:26:07,018 --> 00:26:08,413
It's perfect.

516
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:10,761
I had a little help.

517
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:31,861
Heel, toe, heel, clap, clap.

518
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,073
Heel, toe, heel, clap, clap.

519
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:35,772
I think the problem
is I have two left feet.

520
00:26:35,818 --> 00:26:37,823
I never noticed.
How do you buy shoes?

521
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,292
It's an expression.

522
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:41,131
But you knew that, didn't you?

523
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,953
Those jewels aren't real, you know!

524
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:51,462
<i>Whatever, Hillary!

525
00:26:56,796 --> 00:26:59,393
Don't drink that.
Someone spiked the punch.

526
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:00,801
That's impossible.

527
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,521
According to my research,
it happens at 68% of all proms.

528
00:27:05,336 --> 00:27:06,950
I have to take care of this.

529
00:27:07,116 --> 00:27:10,010
And something's leaking by the dj table.
There's water everywhere.

530
00:27:10,117 --> 00:27:11,043
I'm on it.

531
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:25,622
Where's Declan?

532
00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:27,963
Hopefully not looking for me.

533
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:31,162
Where's Andy?

534
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:33,871
I, uh, ditched her on the dance floor.

535
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:35,730
A man needs a break, you know?

536
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:40,330
Why are you both hiding from your dates?

537
00:27:41,555 --> 00:27:42,721
You want this one?

538
00:27:43,388 --> 00:27:44,992
He's hiding because he's freaking out

539
00:27:45,095 --> 00:27:47,142
about whether or not
to have sex with Andy.

540
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:49,950
She wants this.
I mean, I can't blame her.

541
00:27:52,156 --> 00:27:54,073
But she's so much more experienced
than I am.

542
00:27:55,335 --> 00:27:57,113
So, yeah, I'm totally freaking out.

543
00:27:57,917 --> 00:27:58,972
Right.

544
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:01,420
Your turn.

545
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:04,173
She's messed up because she doesn't know

546
00:28:04,277 --> 00:28:06,510
whether or not to get back
together with Declan.

547
00:28:07,006 --> 00:28:07,972
Yep.

548
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,562
Prom is stressful.

549
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:13,583
True that.

550
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:16,072
It doesn't have to be.

551
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:19,311
Are you kidding?
You've been flipping out all week.

552
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:23,520
I know.
But Nicole taught me something.

553
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:26,393
You're busting out a mom
moment right now?

554
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:29,481
She said that tonight is a celebration
of how far we've come,

555
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:32,651
and we should just let it
happen and enjoy it.

556
00:28:34,488 --> 00:28:35,963
I have come a long way.

557
00:28:36,988 --> 00:28:38,533
From dumb to dumber.

558
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:41,202
Better than a slut to sluttier.

559
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,433
That's the old me.

560
00:28:44,377 --> 00:28:47,491
Which means I have come a long way.

561
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:51,420
That Nicole Trager, she's pretty good.

562
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:52,980
Yes, she is.

563
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:57,420
You're not so bad yourself.

564
00:29:02,955 --> 00:29:04,100
Shall we?

565
00:29:06,325 --> 00:29:07,702
Okay.

566
00:29:12,726 --> 00:29:15,351
All right. Tell me the truth.

567
00:29:15,455 --> 00:29:16,351
About what?

568
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,453
We lost the song contest, didn't we?

569
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:21,521
We lost the song contest.

570
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:23,162
Well, that's just...

571
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:26,712
fine, actually.

572
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:28,372
- Is it?
- Yeah.

573
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,333
I didn't write that song for this.

574
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:34,082
I wrote it because I had something
to say about myself and...

575
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:36,012
everyone here tonight.

576
00:29:36,947 --> 00:29:38,741
Well, no one's heard it except me.

577
00:29:39,355 --> 00:29:42,182
The perils of the undiscovered
songwriting duo.

578
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:44,702
Destined for a lonely life on the road.

579
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:47,312
With only their college degrees
to keep them warm at night.

580
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:48,622
Phds, please.

581
00:29:48,726 --> 00:29:49,912
You have a phd?

582
00:29:50,018 --> 00:29:52,693
No, not yet.
How old do you think I am?

583
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:54,183
How old are you?

584
00:29:54,456 --> 00:29:55,983
I'm 19.

585
00:29:56,526 --> 00:29:58,042
You're only 19?

586
00:29:58,688 --> 00:30:01,842
I was... I was sort of an early bloomer,
academically speaking.

587
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:04,421
And you've been torturing me
about being so young.

588
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:06,531
You are unbelievable.

589
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,711
But I'm half of a pretty
great songwriting duo.

590
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:12,190
I don't know about great.
You heard the song.

591
00:30:12,905 --> 00:30:14,213
But have you?

592
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,203
Hello, everyone. Hello.

593
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:24,251
I hope you're all having a great night.

594
00:30:24,495 --> 00:30:28,133
This song is not the winner
of the prom theme contest.

595
00:30:28,237 --> 00:30:31,382
But I though that everybody
should get a chance to hear this song.

596
00:30:31,756 --> 00:30:36,021
It's written by someone who,
in my opinion,

597
00:30:36,606 --> 00:30:38,830
knows a whole lot more about who she is

598
00:30:39,556 --> 00:30:43,802
and really what life's all about
than she will ever admit.

599
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:47,722
So, enjoy it.

600
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:00,631
This isn't...

601
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:02,812
How...

602
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:05,043
I'm computer genius, remember.

603
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:39,342
What are you doing up here?

604
00:31:40,706 --> 00:31:41,980
Roof leak.

605
00:31:42,725 --> 00:31:44,950
What about you?
I thought you went home hours ago.

606
00:31:45,857 --> 00:31:48,890
What do they call it?
A last hurrah?

607
00:31:49,905 --> 00:31:51,050
A last hurrah?

608
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:56,060
You're leaving with Sarah tonight.

609
00:31:57,287 --> 00:31:58,260
Yeah.

610
00:31:58,577 --> 00:32:00,103
You're not gonna ask her to stay?

611
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,552
Amanda said something to me earlier.

612
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:07,791
If you care about someone,
you wanna put their feelings first.

613
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:10,040
I wanna do that for Sarah.

614
00:32:11,736 --> 00:32:12,882
I understand.

615
00:32:14,197 --> 00:32:16,502
I guess I just wish
she'd done the same for you.

616
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:33,221
Thank you for your help tonight.

617
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:37,480
It's amazing what we can accomplish
when we work together, isn't it?

618
00:32:40,437 --> 00:32:42,531
I'm gonna miss you, Jessi.

619
00:32:44,315 --> 00:32:45,893
No, you're not.

620
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:48,821
Because no matter where I am,

621
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:51,163
we're always connected.

622
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:53,990
That's true.

623
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:56,462
Even if I am smarter.

624
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:59,950
- Stronger.
- Faster.

625
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:21,330
You, uh...

626
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:25,920
You better get back in there
and make some more memories.

627
00:33:26,986 --> 00:33:29,602
They're kinda hard to come by
for people like you and me.

628
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:32,450
You should come down, too.

629
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:37,470
A last hurrah.

630
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:40,583
A last hurrah.

631
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:14,272
You've been following me.

632
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:19,952
Nice tux.

633
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:22,293
Why all the secrecy?

634
00:34:24,055 --> 00:34:25,460
I didn't want to distract you.

635
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:30,450
You're worried about Latnok, aren't you?

636
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,303
You don't trust them either.

637
00:34:33,408 --> 00:34:34,943
Well, they're scientists.

638
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:37,713
I don't know if they should be trusted.

639
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:40,723
Do I have anything to worry about?

640
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:44,171
You should always worry.

641
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:47,883
Not tonight.

642
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:50,612
Tonight is about Amanda.

643
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:52,720
We'll be fine.

644
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:55,171
Okay.

645
00:34:56,775 --> 00:34:58,171
I'll go.

646
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:00,913
But, Foss.

647
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,870
Thanks for looking out for me.

648
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:29,351
God, I love a man in a tux.

649
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:30,520
Me, too.

650
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:32,860
I mean, I like being
the man you love in a tux.

651
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:35,111
Okay, so we've had our pictures taken.

652
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:39,743
We've danced. We've eaten weird french
hors d'oeuvrey things.

653
00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:42,470
We've covered every prom cliché
in the book,

654
00:35:42,577 --> 00:35:47,373
and now I think we should move onto
our end of the night festivities.

655
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,013
Okay.

656
00:35:49,597 --> 00:35:52,041
Let me begin by saying
you're the hottest girl I know,

657
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:55,633
and I fantasize about having sex
with you, like, all the time.

658
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:58,790
And I really wanted
to have sex with you tonight.

659
00:35:59,556 --> 00:36:00,760
But then my dad comes up to me

660
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:03,531
and didn't make any sense about
whatever he was trying to say

661
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:05,252
and wanted to give me a condom,

662
00:36:05,355 --> 00:36:07,040
and it all became real.

663
00:36:07,276 --> 00:36:10,312
And anyway, I just...
don't think we should.

664
00:36:12,398 --> 00:36:15,111
You think I wanted
to give it up to you tonight?

665
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:16,891
Didn't you?

666
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:20,993
Losing my virginity on prom night

667
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,410
is the most cliché
of all things cliché.

668
00:36:25,947 --> 00:36:28,801
What kind of sentimental loser
do you think I am?

669
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:31,781
Wait. You're a virgin?

670
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:34,391
Why wouldn't I be?

671
00:36:35,387 --> 00:36:37,763
So what did you mean then, if not sex?

672
00:36:41,688 --> 00:36:43,673
Triple chocolate sundaes

673
00:36:43,777 --> 00:36:47,813
and me kicking your ass
yet again in G-force Extreme.

674
00:36:49,745 --> 00:36:50,663
Really?

675
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:54,632
Really.

676
00:37:02,616 --> 00:37:03,781
There you are.

677
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:06,171
I'm finally done putting out fires.

678
00:37:07,598 --> 00:37:09,620
I'm assuming there were no actual fires.

679
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:11,143
No, no fires.

680
00:37:11,665 --> 00:37:13,161
A flood or two.

681
00:37:13,636 --> 00:37:15,652
I guess there was more than one leak.

682
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:17,901
The cleaning crew will get it.

683
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:20,200
I think it's time for a dance.

684
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:22,650
I think that sounds great.

685
00:37:23,258 --> 00:37:24,903
Have a great night, everyone.

686
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:27,301
The prom as we know it has ended.

687
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:30,831
It's over.

688
00:37:31,705 --> 00:37:33,201
It doesn't have to be.

689
00:37:38,365 --> 00:37:39,783
May I have this dance?

690
00:37:49,145 --> 00:37:50,371
Gotta go, pumpkins.

691
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:52,190
I got a tiara to stalk.

692
00:37:52,296 --> 00:37:54,941
- Good night.
- Later, Hills.

693
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:59,330
So what's next on our
Hillary-approved itinerary?

694
00:38:00,105 --> 00:38:01,292
How'd you know?

695
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:03,973
Cause she had that glint
of a job well done in her eyes.

696
00:38:04,928 --> 00:38:06,773
I didn't want to mess anything up.

697
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,013
How could you think
you could mess it up?

698
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:11,861
Cause I feel like
that's all I've ever done

699
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,642
since the first time we got together.

700
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:16,552
I couldn't even break up
with you properly.

701
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:18,521
We're so passed that.

702
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:22,363
Look, I know I said
I'd be more open and all that,

703
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,703
so let me do this.

704
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:28,082
Right. Sorry.
Continue with your openness.

705
00:38:29,146 --> 00:38:30,620
I really like you, Lori.

706
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:33,411
I always have.

707
00:38:34,488 --> 00:38:36,010
I don't know where you stand with me

708
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:39,111
or with what we're supposed
to be or not be,

709
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:42,131
but I want you to know
that it's in your hands.

710
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,093
It's in my hands? Why?

711
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:48,373
Cause I heard your song tonight.

712
00:38:48,818 --> 00:38:50,251
Really heard it.

713
00:38:51,568 --> 00:38:54,892
The girl who wrote it has got
her whole future in front of her.

714
00:38:55,596 --> 00:38:57,612
I don't wanna be the one
that holds her back.

715
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:04,480
You know what's amazing?

716
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:08,991
Is you really know me,
and you get me.

717
00:39:11,077 --> 00:39:13,001
I care about you so much.

718
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,741
But you're right.

719
00:39:18,146 --> 00:39:19,901
I don't wanna move backwards.

720
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:23,103
Or even stay in the same place.

721
00:39:27,227 --> 00:39:28,271
So...

722
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:31,622
I think that means
that we shouldn't be together.

723
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:33,771
Is that okay?

724
00:39:34,936 --> 00:39:38,022
I seem to remember it's part of
the whole "it's in your hands" thing.

725
00:39:39,815 --> 00:39:41,252
Do you mean it?

726
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:43,920
Trager, you're one of my best friends.

727
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:46,453
All I want is for you to be happy.

728
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:50,122
I don't know if I deserve that.

729
00:39:50,326 --> 00:39:53,580
Trust me, you do.

730
00:40:23,675 --> 00:40:25,200
You did that, didn't you?

731
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:26,492
Maybe.

732
00:40:28,537 --> 00:40:30,362
So how do you do it all?

733
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:31,902
Do what?

734
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:34,080
Everything I've seen you do.

735
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,010
My brain is more developed
than other people's.

736
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:40,423
It allows me to do special things.

737
00:40:41,468 --> 00:40:43,702
Kinda like superman, only real?

738
00:40:44,898 --> 00:40:46,332
Can you fly?

739
00:40:46,438 --> 00:40:47,643
I'm not gonna tell you that

740
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,960
until you tell me something
I don't know about you.

741
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:52,480
- Not this again.
- It's only fair.

742
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:55,653
You may not know that...

743
00:40:59,275 --> 00:41:00,660
I love you.

744
00:41:05,126 --> 00:41:06,030
You do?

745
00:41:07,488 --> 00:41:08,603
I do.

746
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:13,433
I love you, too.

747
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:18,611
Here, don't get your feet wet.

748
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:31,111
<i>There's a reason why people say
we shouldn't expect too much.

749
00:41:31,547 --> 00:41:34,901
<i>No one wants to see someone
they care about end up disappointed.

750
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:54,300
<i>We instinctively act
to protect our own from being hurt

751
00:41:54,526 --> 00:41:58,572
<i>and do what we can to make the right
choices for the people we love.

752
00:42:00,237 --> 00:42:02,830
<i>But the reason we have expectations
in the first place

753
00:42:03,036 --> 00:42:05,632
<i>is because we wanna
aim as high as we can.

754
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:09,590
<i>Because when you love someone,

755
00:42:09,796 --> 00:42:12,813
<i>there's no limit to
what you can accomplish.

756
00:42:22,605 --> 00:42:24,363
I left my other clothes inside.

757
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:25,733
- I'll get them.
- No, I will.

758
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:27,050
No, let me help you.

759
00:42:27,155 --> 00:42:28,612
- Again.
- Always.

760
00:42:41,616 --> 00:42:42,951
Got everything you need?

761
00:42:44,538 --> 00:42:45,642
I do now.
