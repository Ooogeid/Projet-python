1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:01,984
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,194
- You're Kyle.
- You're in my tub.

3
00:00:04,314 --> 00:00:07,197
The creep who did this stole the
necklace Declan gave me, I want it back.

4
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:10,735
- What is it?
- It's my necklace that was stolen.

5
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:12,536
Just so you know, Kyle is with me.

6
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:14,287
It's not supposed to be that way.

7
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:15,565
<i>You came back for me.</i>

8
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:17,988
<i>When you reached out
for me and took my hand,</i>

9
00:00:18,123 --> 00:00:20,177
<i>for the first time I didn't feel alone.</i>

10
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,463
<i>Say something if you're okay.</i>

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,633
Andy has cancer.

12
00:00:26,753 --> 00:00:28,135
Josh, I am so sorry.

13
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:31,221
I want to help her, but she won't
let me talk to her about it.

14
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,308
- <i>What's wrong?</i>
- <i>Have you an affair with Emily?</i>

15
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,604
Did someone teach you to draw that way?

16
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:43,058
This is Baylin's.

17
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:46,028
- I can't get it open.
- We'll figure it out.

18
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:48,447
Kyle, I'd like
to introduce you to Cerebral

19
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:49,948
Impulse Relay, or

20
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:51,068
C-I-R.

21
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:53,181
But we like to call it CIR.

22
00:00:53,822 --> 00:00:56,137
To Stephen and your wonderful family.

23
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:58,874
Ballantine invaded my home,
my family, and my privacy.

24
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:01,376
- So what do you want to do?
- I want to get my ring back.

25
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:06,048
- We're not leaving you.
- Now listen to me.

26
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,884
- The ring is all you need.
- What?

27
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:10,239
Now go.

28
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,637
- Thank you.
- Get out of here!

29
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:13,472
Take him to room 237.

30
00:01:23,587 --> 00:01:26,353
<i>While discovering who
I am and where I came from,</i>

31
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:30,042
<i>I'd always been led to believe I was
the only person in the world like me.</i>

32
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:33,644
<i>Now it seemed Jessi
and I had a connection,</i>

33
00:01:34,198 --> 00:01:36,084
<i>but I wasn't sure how to figure it out.</i>

34
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:41,375
<i>"The light will show you the way."</i>

35
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,214
<i>- It's Foss.</i>
- Are you okay?

36
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,133
- I've had to lay low.
- What happened? Where are you?

37
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:52,347
I'll let you know
when it's safe to meet.

38
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,513
- I better go.
<i>- Wait...</i>

39
00:01:56,052 --> 00:01:57,975
Thank you, Tom. I appreciate your help.

40
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:02,324
Nice car.

41
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:05,023
Yeah, not bad, as environmentally
conscious vehicles go,

42
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:08,652
but is it worth wasting a day standing
around with my hand planted on it?

43
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:11,238
Your name does have to be drawn first.

44
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:13,830
Highly unlikely.

45
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,119
Wouldn't last 5 minutes in the contest.
You've the attention span of a bird.

46
00:02:17,464 --> 00:02:19,288
Not when I'm properly motivated.

47
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:22,457
I hope your motivation
would be to cancer charity.

48
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:26,699
Why would I care about that?

49
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,340
To help people with cancer?

50
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Whatever.

51
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:38,557
Well, I hope something happens
at this shindig for Hillary's

52
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:39,808
- sake.
- Hillary?

53
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:42,227
She's set her sights on
becoming the next reality

54
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:43,388
TV star.

55
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:46,481
I think she's looking at
this as her walking audition.

56
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,018
You think Jessi will be there today?

57
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:54,197
Are you asking me as
my mom or her therapist?

58
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:56,237
I guess both.

59
00:02:57,817 --> 00:02:59,369
Is she still spending time with you?

60
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:02,664
Invited or not,
she just seems to show up.

61
00:03:03,343 --> 00:03:05,951
And let's just say she's taken
a particular interest

62
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,836
in Kyle as of late.

63
00:03:14,181 --> 00:03:16,172
Is it time to go to the charity event?

64
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,297
Everyone's still getting ready.

65
00:03:19,386 --> 00:03:20,397
What's wrong?

66
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:22,626
Nothing. I just...

67
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,557
I wanted to ask you about something.

68
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:27,113
How well do you know Jessi Hollander?

69
00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:29,812
Not that well.

70
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:32,402
Has she ever seen any of your drawings?

71
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,655
Not that I'm aware of.

72
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:38,970
When you recovered your memory,

73
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,079
did you ever figure out
the meaning of that symbol?

74
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:44,804
The one you kept drawing?

75
00:03:47,388 --> 00:03:49,586
It was a logo for
a company Adam Baylin started.

76
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:54,257
But it's not around anymore.
What does that have to do with Jessi?

77
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:58,387
Just trying to get
some things clear in my head.

78
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,016
I know how that can be.

79
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:07,521
We should get to the carnival.

80
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:09,940
I'm almost ready.

81
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,776
I'll go ring the warning bell.

82
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,549
<i>If Jessi and I did share a history,</i>

83
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:23,844
<i>I knew I had to understand
it before anyone else did.</i>

<i>Buy your tickets now.
The drawing begins in less than an hour.</i>

94
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,521
This thing is way cuter
than in the commercials.

95
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:03,932
I mean, not that cute matters.

96
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,143
It's good to be green, right?

97
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,126
So, I haven't seen you since that night

98
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:12,246
we went into the woods.

99
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,482
I know you were kind
of tripped out on all the gas, but

100
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:17,716
it was kind of
a weird night for everyone.

101
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:18,758
Is Kyle here?

102
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:21,428
He's around here somewhere.

103
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:26,183
- You got your necklace back.
- Yeah. It just showed up

104
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:28,685
in my locker. Some screwed-up
stalker was trying

105
00:05:28,805 --> 00:05:30,061
to play mind games with me.

106
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,107
Maybe someone found it
and was just trying to be nice.

107
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:39,821
I just thought that you
would be glad to have it back.

108
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,707
I'd rather not haveb been beaten down

109
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:45,089
and robbed in the first place, but...

110
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:49,598
kind of puts a damper
on the whole glad thing.

111
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:52,371
Catch you later. Freak.

112
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,589
Crap. Andy's here. Remember,

113
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:01,301
not a word. In fact, don't even use
words that start with the letter C.

114
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:03,845
If she finds out I told you
she has cancer,

115
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:05,388
I'm a corpse.

116
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:07,933
I mean, a dead guy.

117
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:09,684
Keep breathing. I won't speak at all.

118
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,022
Oh, and, Mom...

119
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:16,190
thanks.

120
00:06:24,943 --> 00:06:26,213
I thought you weren't coming.

121
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:27,612
My moms made me.

122
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:30,093
Like some cancer charity
party's going to inspire me.

123
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:33,112
God, look at that.

124
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:35,972
Complete, utter fakeness.

125
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:38,987
Happy-go-lucky kids with cancer.

126
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:40,173
Come on.

127
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:43,517
"You give, we live?"

128
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:45,053
How lame.

129
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:50,767
Not I don't support people with cancer.

130
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:54,312
- Totally down for the cause.
- Screw the cause, just give me the car.

131
00:06:56,893 --> 00:06:58,565
<i>All right, mix it up, girl.</i>

132
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,226
<i>Okay, people, gather 'round.</i>

133
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,040
<i>It's time to see who's going
to get their shot at winning a hybrid.</i>

134
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:05,156
<i>4,000 entries,
but only 20 lucky winners.</i>

135
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:06,782
I talked to Foss.

136
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:10,385
He's okay,
but he said it's not safe to meet yet.

137
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:14,249
- Did you tell him about the picture?
- I didn't get a chance.

138
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,626
But I've been thinking,
that picture has been locked

139
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:19,654
in Adam's box for 15 years.

140
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:21,924
That has to be him in the photo.

141
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:25,498
- What about the girl?
- Maybe Adam had a female counterpart.

142
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:28,305
Maybe Jessi's like me.

143
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:30,822
Jessi had a life before she moved here.

144
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:33,781
- Full-on memories.
- She could be lying.

145
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,395
So Madacorp sent some wicked hot,

146
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:39,055
mentally scrambled science
experiment to invade your life.

147
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:41,117
Why?

148
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,695
Then why haven't they made
some move on you by now?

149
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:46,063
I don't know.

150
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,725
It's like they've been watching...
waiting.

151
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:51,453
Should I go green?

152
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:53,538
Isn't that something?

153
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:58,218
Our fifth contestant is...

154
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:04,549
<i>Give it up for Kyle!</i>

155
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,719
I can't do this. What if Foss calls?
I need to talk to him.

156
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,675
Either way, you stand around waiting.

157
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:11,264
<i>All right, we'll go yellow this time.</i>

158
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:13,350
<i>Contestant number 6...</i>

159
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:18,534
<i>Give it up for Jessi!</i>

160
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:23,568
- What are the odds of that happening?
- 20 in 4,000.

161
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:26,465
Whatever. Look, here's your chance.

162
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:28,573
Get her talking,
figure out if she's lying.

163
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:31,227
<i>I think it'll be good.</i>

164
00:08:31,603 --> 00:08:32,638
<i>It's kind of tough.</i>

165
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:34,208
<i>I'll be standing there for so long.</i>

166
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:35,987
<i>I got a good chance.</i>

167
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:39,271
Congrats, man.

168
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,628
- You must be really psyched.
- Kinda, yeah.

169
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:44,027
You trying to win the car for your girl?

170
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:48,760
Hadn't really thought it
through that far, had you?

171
00:08:49,257 --> 00:08:50,442
Let me cut to the chase.

172
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:54,069
I once played video
games for 17 hours straight...

173
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:56,843
no food, no water, no bathroom.

174
00:08:57,413 --> 00:09:00,230
When I put my mind to something,
I make it happen.

175
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,635
So name your price, man.
Because tonight,

176
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:06,979
I put my mind towards winning that
car for the lady I want to be my lady.

177
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:09,989
Long story,
but she kind of needs the boost.

178
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:13,766
A hundred bucks.

179
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,451
Dude.

180
00:09:15,696 --> 00:09:19,040
I might be a romantic, but I'm
a part-time, minimum-wage romantic.

181
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,909
<i>All right, beautiful people, listen up.</i>

182
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:23,253
<i>We're going to have rules
in this competion.</i>

183
00:09:24,174 --> 00:09:25,219
<i>Number 1:</i>

184
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:28,800
<i>contestants must have one
hand on the car at all times.</i>

185
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:30,429
<i>Number 2:</i>

186
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:31,970
<i>no sitting, kneeling,</i>

187
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:34,081
<i>lounging, or leaning.</i>

188
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:35,996
<i>Number 3:</i>

189
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:39,394
<i>last but not least, last person standing</i>

190
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:41,896
<i>gets to drive this hybrid home tonight.</i>

191
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:43,583
Move over, bro.

192
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:46,151
- This baby's mine.
- I didn't hear your name called.

193
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,071
Some guy dropped out at the last minute.
Guess it's my lucky day.

194
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:52,783
<i>All, right. That about covers it.</i>

195
00:09:53,434 --> 00:09:57,098
<i>So, I guess the only
thing left to say is...</i>

196
00:09:57,873 --> 00:09:59,010
<i>contestants...</i>

197
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:00,736
<i>get ready...</i>

198
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:02,615
<i>get set...</i>

199
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:05,962
put your hands on the hybrid, y'all.

200
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:15,805
<i>This was the opportunity</i>

201
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,348
<i>I'd been looking for.</i>

202
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:19,559
<i>But how would I find out
the truth about her?</i>

203
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:30,153
So, give me the super-genius
lowdown on the competion.

204
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:34,073
See the guy in the red shirt?

205
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:36,618
He's nervous. His heart beats fast.

206
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:38,495
He's a real contender.

207
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:43,833
And her, she's wearing the wrong shoes.

208
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:46,673
I give her an hour.

209
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,215
What about him?

210
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,634
Allergies. Ten minutes, tops.

211
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:55,344
And...

212
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:02,277
I don't know. She's hard to read.

213
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:08,775
We got this in the bag.

214
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:11,592
You already have a car.

215
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,989
I'm a man of many needs.

216
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:23,860
Did you notice how our son magically
ended up in the contest?

217
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:25,500
I don't think that was magic.

218
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:27,335
It's obvious he cheated.

219
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:33,506
It's Ballantine.

220
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:35,763
Hello.

221
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:37,633
Yes. Today?

222
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:39,842
But I'm...

223
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,392
No. No, I understand.

224
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:43,638
I'll see you soon.

225
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:47,146
This is the first family weekend
we've had in a month.

226
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:48,314
Yeah, I know, but it's

227
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:49,482
a last-minute thing.

228
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:51,966
I should be done by dinner.

229
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:56,570
Bye.

230
00:11:57,535 --> 00:11:58,790
See you later, Lori.

231
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:00,827
Yeah, bye.

232
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:07,542
Okay, what is up with you two?

233
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,436
Nothing.

234
00:12:09,716 --> 00:12:12,755
Right. You're in your Lori Trager
cone of silence.

235
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,674
I just don't feel like talking.

236
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:18,854
Look, if there's something
between you and your father,

237
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:21,288
you don't have to tell me,
but I think you're mature enough

238
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,142
to let go of your grudge
and just work it through.

239
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,343
Mom, it's not a grudge, it's...

240
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:33,693
Dad's just been working a lot lately,
and I guess I'm letting it get to me.

241
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,370
<i>One hour in, and they're</i>

242
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:46,809
<i>dropping like flies!
Where's the stamina?</i>

243
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,689
<i>This competion is about sticking it out
until the bitter end.</i>

244
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,719
<i>Last year's winner held on
for a jaw-dropping 18 hours.</i>

245
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,923
Looks like our chances
of winning are getting better.

246
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:56,633
It looks like.

247
00:12:57,498 --> 00:12:58,509
Don't you want to win?

248
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:00,637
Not really.

249
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,681
Then why would you stand
around here for hours?

250
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:05,669
To help people?

251
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:06,851
For the charity?

252
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:10,939
I don't understand you at all.

253
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:14,021
I could say the same about you.

254
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:18,571
What would you do if you won?

255
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:22,195
I don't know. I'd just...

256
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:23,449
drive.

257
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:26,214
Where?

258
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:28,514
Anywhere else.

259
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,211
Don't you ever just want to get away?

260
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,917
I was away once.

261
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,093
And all I wanted was
to come back to my family.

262
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,347
Family's not all it's cracked up to be.

263
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,184
What do you mean?

264
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:52,899
Well, you have...

265
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:54,482
so many people here

266
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:55,614
supporting you.

267
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,693
And...

268
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:59,179
My sister's the only person
I have in my life,

269
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:00,647
but she didn't come.

270
00:14:02,115 --> 00:14:03,867
I'm sure there's a reason.

271
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:06,661
It's not just today. It's...

272
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,558
I don't know, something
about our life just...

273
00:14:12,522 --> 00:14:13,863
feels wrong.

274
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:24,549
What are you doing here?

275
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:27,138
Apparently, the systems integration test
was so successful,

276
00:14:27,258 --> 00:14:28,891
they wanna move immediately into trials.

277
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:31,144
- Today?
- Tell me about it.

278
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:34,201
It's happening faster
than I can train my entire staff.

279
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:36,899
For now I'm the only one who can
babysit the diagnostic software.

280
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:41,362
Well, I'm sure Ballantine
is grateful for your expertise.

281
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:45,447
Emily, listen, about the test today,
I'm just a little concerned.

282
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:47,660
How did they find a subject
on such short notice?

283
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:52,623
Stats analysis has been compiling
a test pool for months.

284
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:55,912
We don't wanna be
stuck here all day, right?

285
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:58,080
- I better leave you to it.
- All right.

286
00:14:58,368 --> 00:14:59,848
<i>Four hours and counting, people!</i>

287
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:01,268
<i>Keep it up!</i>

288
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,283
<i>That's the fighting spirit.</i>

289
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:05,754
<i>Ignore the pain in your feet
and the aches in your brain,</i>

290
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:07,263
<i>and keep up the good work.</i>

291
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:11,631
<i>Hour six. And I can see that a few
of you are in this for the long haul.</i>

292
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,977
Sure you're not tired?

293
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:15,654
I'm sure.

294
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,773
Not the

295
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:19,192
slighest bit sleepy?

296
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:20,109
I mean,

297
00:15:20,356 --> 00:15:21,360
we've been at this for...

298
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,480
hours.

299
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:26,180
Be so nice to relax, have a seat,

300
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,823
maybe have a nap.

301
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:38,932
You're staring.

302
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,339
I guess so.

303
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:42,894
Why?

304
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:48,221
I want to understand
why you think the way you do.

305
00:15:49,234 --> 00:15:50,898
You don't want to get inside my head.

306
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:54,143
It's a scary place.
Why else would I be in therapy?

307
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:03,820
Nicole's really nice,
but I like talking to you better.

308
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:05,655
You do?

309
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:08,251
I don't know...

310
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:10,952
it's just easier than
talking to other people.

311
00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:14,163
- Like we're...
- Connected somehow.

312
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:15,498
Yeah.

313
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:20,670
Like

314
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:23,115
what I said earlier about my sister.

315
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,092
I've never told anybody that before.

316
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:27,827
Not even Nicole?

317
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:31,722
I don't think Nicole would understand
the things that are going on.

318
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:34,809
Maybe I could.

319
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:46,933
When we went to the woods...

320
00:16:47,732 --> 00:16:49,490
I saw some things that scared me.

321
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:52,759
Things that I think I did

322
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,704
but don't remember doing.

323
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:58,291
What kind of things?

324
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:05,089
It's okay.

325
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:06,215
You can tell me.

326
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:13,472
What was that?

327
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:17,894
Uh, what do you mean?

328
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:21,848
- I saw a fire.
- You... You saw that?

329
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:23,659
How?

330
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:26,319
I think I just read your mind.

331
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,876
You just read my mind?

332
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:35,745
That's not possible.

333
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:40,583
I don't know how, but...
I think I saw what you were thinking...

334
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:42,667
or rembering.

335
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:45,693
No. People can't do that.

336
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:48,090
Do you ever feel like
you're not like other people?

337
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:51,093
I do sometimes.

338
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,988
Look, I'm really freaked out
right now, so...

339
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:57,767
please just stay away.

340
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:11,064
I thought you were coming.

341
00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:13,199
<i>Nope. Too busy being painfully</i>

342
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,519
indecisive about New York.

343
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:16,869
Why? Is the event that much fun?

344
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,503
If your idea of fun is watching
Kyle and Jessi standing around a car

345
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:21,707
staring at each other.

346
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:23,621
They're both in the contest?

347
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:26,671
<i>Yeah. And after everything
that's happened with her, I'm not so</i>

348
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,839
psyched about her
standing that close to him.

349
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:30,883
Is it that bad?

350
00:18:32,426 --> 00:18:34,585
First of all,
Kyle hasn't done anything wrong.

351
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:36,013
And we both know he won't.

352
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:39,267
<i>But I saw the way she looks at him,
I know you don't know me well</i>

353
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:41,459
enough to decipher
my melodramatic tendencies,

354
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,313
but I'm telling you,
put on your best flower-print dress

355
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:47,427
<i>and supportive girlfriend smile,
get your ass down here,</i>

356
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,193
<i>and show that boyfriend-stealer up.</i>

357
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:53,167
With five contestants remaing,

358
00:18:53,303 --> 00:18:56,450
the question
on everyone's mind is, who's hot,

359
00:18:57,212 --> 00:18:58,244
and who's not?

360
00:18:58,364 --> 00:18:59,619
I'm not even joking here.

361
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,025
Come on. This is supposed to be fun.

362
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:03,836
I'm aiming for a reality TV career,

363
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,512
not the 11:00 news.

364
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:06,460
Take five.

365
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:07,889
All right.

366
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:10,368
How is this supposed
to get you your 15 minutes?

367
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:11,546
Honestly,

368
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,039
it's a lot harder than I thought.

369
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:16,316
Right now, I'm just kinda running amuck
and looking fabulous.

370
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:17,816
I need an angle.

371
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:19,280
Go tabloid.

372
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,472
Dig up some dirt
on some of the contestants.

373
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,227
You should start with Jessi.

374
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,612
I tried to get a comment from her
during one of the breaks.

375
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,334
Stiff as a board in front of the camera.

376
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:30,331
Kind of crazy in the eyes.

377
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,858
Dig deeper. There's definitely something
about her that we're missing.

378
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:35,654
- Now you got me curious.

379
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,743
- Why her?
- Because....

380
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:41,910
First she's all about Declan,
then all of a sudden she's, like,

381
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,447
suddenly mesmerized by Kyle.
I mean, what is that?

382
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:46,375
She's erratic and moody, and...
Oh, yeah.

383
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:48,252
Remember the fit she threw at the dance?

384
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:51,033
Clearly, she bugs.

385
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,049
But why get so aggravated?

386
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:56,992
It's just... She's all hunkered down
in the middle of our lives

387
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,800
and we know this much about her.

388
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:02,099
Can you honestly think of one normal,
decent thing to say about Jessi?

389
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:05,624
You're right.

390
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:09,153
She's just a mystery
waiting to become a scandal.

391
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,441
I'm on it.

392
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,443
You'd have a career.
You're great at gossip.

393
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,429
Think when there's a camera involved

394
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:16,906
it's called investigative journalism.

395
00:20:17,453 --> 00:20:19,215
<i>How many of you are feeling tired?</i>

396
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,660
<i>Better not see any yawns.
The party's just getting started.</i>

397
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,199
Hey, Andy.

398
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:27,883
Hey, Ms. Trager.

399
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:32,505
My God! He totally

400
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,672
told you?

401
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,802
Covering for Josh, I get it.

402
00:20:38,394 --> 00:20:39,428
But that doesn't let him

403
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:41,806
off the hook for flapping
his yapper in the first place.

404
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,891
How are you?

405
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:45,624
Are you gonna bill me?

406
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,186
Consider it a freebie.

407
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,510
Well...

408
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:53,776
me and my moms have been
through this before, so I can deal.

409
00:20:55,174 --> 00:20:56,195
Look...

410
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,690
you seem very well equipped

411
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:00,825
for what's coming, but

412
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:03,202
when someone who really
cares about you isn't...

413
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:07,720
Slack.

414
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:09,510
Cutting him some. Now.

415
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,847
Thanks.

416
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:14,547
You're really good.

417
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:17,900
Well, I only did half the work.

418
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:21,994
With your coping skills, I assume
one of your moms is a therapist?

419
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:24,890
Nope. They're just a couple
of everyday lesbians.

420
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:27,921
Thank you.

421
00:21:36,466 --> 00:21:37,720
- You came.
- Of course.

422
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:39,761
Every winner needs a cheering section.

423
00:21:40,904 --> 00:21:42,992
- How you holding up?
- I feel good.

424
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:45,369
I packed you a survival kit:

425
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:46,787
energy drinks, power bars,

426
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:48,732
those little Band-Aids for blisters.

427
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:51,118
and you favorite, Sour Patch Kids.

428
00:21:51,997 --> 00:21:53,919
Thank you. This is great.

429
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,574
You know,

430
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,133
if you get bored just waiting...

431
00:21:57,253 --> 00:22:00,176
I'll be here as long as you're
still in the contest.

432
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:11,145
<i>Now that I knew I could
see her memories,</i>

433
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:15,113
<i>I hoped I hadn't lost my chance
to break through to her.</i>

434
00:22:22,712 --> 00:22:25,146
Operation Supportive
Girlfriend underway.

435
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:27,925
- Nicely done.
- I feel kind of juvenile.

436
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,413
My middle name.

437
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,949
Listen, I didn't mean
to get you worried, but

438
00:22:32,072 --> 00:22:33,904
you might be leaving
for an entire semester,

439
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:36,879
I don't want her thinking she can
swoop in and take whatever she wants.

440
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,048
Like she did with you and Declan?

441
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:41,467
Yeah.

442
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,219
And don't think

443
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:46,677
I'm not aware I'm projecting my
annoyance about that on your situation.

444
00:22:46,813 --> 00:22:48,182
It's fine. I totally get it.

445
00:22:49,574 --> 00:22:50,782
Does believing that

446
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,688
Kyle won't get sucked in
by her make me a lame, clueless girl?

447
00:22:54,513 --> 00:22:57,525
Because I've already been that, and
I don't think I'd go through it again.

448
00:22:57,837 --> 00:23:01,046
Believe me, if I thought
you were lame and/or clueless,

449
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:03,781
this whole friend thing
wouldn't even happen.

450
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:08,616
Yeah, I don't think we're gonna be
outta here before dinner.

451
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:10,386
The boys are still hanging in there.

452
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,309
Good for them.

453
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:15,543
Listen, I have a question.
You've run some clinical trials.

454
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:17,825
Back in grad school.

455
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,090
How long does it take
to gather a pool of test subjects?

456
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:24,099
Well, usually as soon as
the parameters are established,

457
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:25,895
test subjects can be
screened and approved

458
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,555
in a matter of weeks. Why?

459
00:23:28,328 --> 00:23:31,722
Well, turns out we're running a test
with a real subject today.

460
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:33,591
Kinda took me by surprise.

461
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:35,813
Emily said not to worry.

462
00:23:36,713 --> 00:23:38,816
- Oh, Emily is there, too?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

463
00:23:38,936 --> 00:23:41,235
Why don't I pick up some food
and bring it on down later?

464
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,112
Sounds good.

465
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:44,619
Okay. Bye.

466
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:53,361
Where'd you go to high school?

467
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:56,311
What is that? Is it a lie detector?

468
00:23:57,922 --> 00:24:00,838
Just make it easier on yourself.
Answer the questions.

469
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,633
I went to high school in Phoenix...

470
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,844
Chicago...

471
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:09,997
D.C.

472
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:14,398
We moved a lot.

473
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,522
Right now we're looking at
the blood flow to Foss' brain.

474
00:24:19,255 --> 00:24:22,193
Each time he answers a question,
a memory's triggered,

475
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:23,902
certain areas of brain will light up.

476
00:24:24,022 --> 00:24:25,957
Signaling an increase
in blood flow to that area.

477
00:24:26,913 --> 00:24:29,033
- So it acts as a map.
- Exactly.

478
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:31,894
We can discover where each
of his memories are stored.

479
00:24:32,123 --> 00:24:33,985
Where'd you do your special ops traing?

480
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:36,957
I spent some time at Quantico.

481
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:40,586
I'm past that. It's... It's classified.

482
00:24:42,642 --> 00:24:43,809
Quantico, huh?

483
00:24:44,755 --> 00:24:46,091
Must have just missed each other.

484
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:47,968
Yeah, probably.

485
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:50,177
You married?

486
00:24:56,902 --> 00:24:57,984
Nope.

487
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,131
You ever been married?

488
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,824
What's her name?

489
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,479
Her name was Erica.

490
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,704
Foss was drunk and driving.

491
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:17,748
Crash killed his wife and daughter.

492
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,049
Those are his most powerful,
most visceral memories.

493
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:23,745
The kind he buried deep behind

494
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,839
an emotional firewall, so to speak.

495
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:28,527
But once we begin the process...

496
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:31,512
The machine can draw those memories out.

497
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,580
If it can work on him,

498
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:35,849
we can break through Kyle's firewall.

499
00:25:36,444 --> 00:25:37,935
A Plan B, if you will.

500
00:25:39,678 --> 00:25:42,398
And you can remove the information
that you require.

501
00:25:46,688 --> 00:25:47,853
Here's your mission:

502
00:25:47,976 --> 00:25:49,661
look through all your footage

503
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,849
and dig up whatever dirt
you can on Jessi Hollander.

504
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:53,104
Why her?

505
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:55,369
I need some juicy scoop
on the contestants.

506
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:58,372
Then take a look at the one
who bribed his way into the contest.

507
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:06,755
<i>All right,</i>

508
00:26:07,255 --> 00:26:08,255
<i>75?</i>

509
00:26:08,794 --> 00:26:09,886
<i>65.</i>

510
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,303
Little Joshie Trager,
what are you up to?

511
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,848
- <i>65, come on.</i>
- Can you clarify that?

512
00:26:16,997 --> 00:26:19,356
Little Joshie Trager's girlfriend.

513
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,980
I'm just doing a little
background piece on all the

514
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,619
contestants. Nothing heavy,

515
00:26:24,739 --> 00:26:26,939
just some feel-good fluff.
Care to comment?

516
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,571
Great. I love me some feel-good,
fluffy cancer talk.

517
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,991
Love the sarcasm. Hate

518
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:35,111
the hat.

519
00:26:35,404 --> 00:26:37,536
Do you seriously object
to cancer research?

520
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:40,167
Not as much as I object to people

521
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,257
who don't answer a question directly.

522
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:44,397
So, again, I ask,

523
00:26:44,606 --> 00:26:46,044
what are you onto with Josh?

524
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,756
Seriously, it's nothing.

525
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:54,487
Why don't you show me
what you're looking at,

526
00:26:54,622 --> 00:26:56,139
then we'll decide if it's nothing.

527
00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:57,327
<i>65, come on.</i>

528
00:26:57,463 --> 00:26:59,024
- <i>Hey, fine, fine.</i>
- <i>Sweet.</i>

529
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:00,536
<i>Here you go, dude.</i>

530
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:06,811
- <i>Oh! Another one bites the dust!</i>
- The sweet smell of victory.

531
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:09,061
Starting to see some wear
and tear on the contestants.

532
00:27:09,197 --> 00:27:10,059
<i>Hang in there.</i>

533
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:12,237
You paid 65 bucks
for a spot in the contest?

534
00:27:12,357 --> 00:27:13,989
How brain damaged are you?

535
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,699
Cheating at a charity event?

536
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,912
- You don't care about this fundraiser.
- Doesn't mean you can buy your way in.

537
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:21,789
This isn't a joke.

538
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:23,372
Wait a minute.

539
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,841
Two seconds ago,
you wouldn't set foot in this tent.

540
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:27,628
- Now you're all schizo?
- Schizo?

541
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:29,338
First I can't talk about...

542
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:31,368
you know...

543
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:34,084
stuff...
that you told me not to talk about.

544
00:27:34,526 --> 00:27:35,969
you don't even want to deal with...

545
00:27:37,246 --> 00:27:39,097
stuff. And now you're all in my face.

546
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:42,768
Hey, I can be schizo if I want to be.
I'm the one with cancer!

547
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,654
Andy, wait.

548
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:03,503
<i>The grownups are starting to clear out.</i>

549
00:28:03,623 --> 00:28:04,943
<i>Too old to hang, huh?</i>

550
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:08,767
<i>That's all right, because I'm gonna
keep this party rockin' all night long.</i>

551
00:28:09,357 --> 00:28:10,764
I made fun of Andy's hat.

552
00:28:10,918 --> 00:28:12,689
Then it turns out she has cancer.

553
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:15,175
Footage good, feelings bad.

554
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:16,477
Nobody knew.

555
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:19,194
I plan on apologizing

556
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:21,222
as soon as I finish
the rest of this story.

557
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,058
What exactly is your story about?

558
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:26,478
Okay, disclaimer:

559
00:28:26,902 --> 00:28:28,480
this has nothing to do with you

560
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,065
or the fact you guys were dating.

561
00:28:31,087 --> 00:28:32,427
Before you yell,

562
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:35,028
I swear I am in no way
meddling or intruding

563
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:36,428
or prying.

564
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,366
I asked her to drudge up
some dirt on Jessi.

565
00:28:39,955 --> 00:28:40,826
Really?

566
00:28:41,273 --> 00:28:42,953
- For anything good?
- You're not yelling.

567
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:47,165
- Why would I yell?
- I'm on a deadline, people.

568
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:49,334
And I actually did kinda find something.

569
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:52,621
Remember my dorky little
camera peon from video yearbook?

570
00:28:52,756 --> 00:28:55,549
Turns out he's noticed Jessi
at some school events.

571
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:57,926
He said she hangs out
on the sidelines a lot.

572
00:28:58,338 --> 00:29:01,722
I think his exact words were
"She's really lurky. "

573
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:04,349
Anyways, there might be
some stuff on these DVDs.

574
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,728
You wanna us look through the footage?
Would you mind?

575
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:10,439
- Consider it done.
- Thanks.

576
00:29:13,653 --> 00:29:15,736
- <i>Things are a go at this end.</i>
- Thank you, Steven.

577
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:20,734
We're ready.

578
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:42,563
Tom, are you still with me?

579
00:29:48,794 --> 00:29:49,860
<i>Nine hours!</i>

580
00:29:50,007 --> 00:29:52,290
<i>And those two show no sign of stopping.</i>

581
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,978
<i>I'm almost impressed.</i>

582
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:56,450
Let's see if they can break
last year's record.

583
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:01,990
You really think win this thing?

584
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:04,242
Are you ask me to win it for you?

585
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:06,396
No.

586
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:08,806
I'm asking you to win it for Andy.

587
00:30:08,995 --> 00:30:10,859
Josh, I'm really sorry about her.

588
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:15,705
This thing
has been bumming her out, and...

589
00:30:15,825 --> 00:30:17,946
I thought if I could
win the car for her...

590
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:21,203
You gotta do this for me.

591
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:23,246
Please.

592
00:30:24,795 --> 00:30:26,168
This is what you do.

593
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:27,579
You help people.

594
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:31,134
I'll do my best.

595
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:52,275
Do you really think
that you can help me?

596
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,692
I'd like to try.

597
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:05,827
This isn't normal.

598
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,536
I shouldn't be seeing those things.

599
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,794
I shouldn't be seeing them with you.

600
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:13,736
I don't understand
why this is happening,

601
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:15,965
but we can figure it out together.

602
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:17,913
How?

603
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,594
You have to open your mind to me.

604
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,391
Trust me.

605
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:39,153
It's too loud.

606
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:41,195
Just block out the noise.

607
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,763
Close your eyes and focus.

608
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:48,164
Keep listening to my voice...

609
00:31:49,499 --> 00:31:51,192
turning out all other sound

610
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:53,669
until it's just like
static on the radio...

611
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:57,099
then quieter like a fly buzzing...

612
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:01,052
until the sound just disappears.

613
00:32:22,129 --> 00:32:23,525
Hindsight is an awful thing.

614
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:25,220
I should have never worn those shoes.

615
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:27,488
There she is again.

616
00:32:27,763 --> 00:32:29,569
Yeah, not doing anything.

617
00:32:32,188 --> 00:32:34,043
My nose looks puffy.

618
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:36,662
I don't see her.

619
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:40,811
Over your shoulder, against the wall.

620
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:43,116
Your nose isn't puffy.

621
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:47,556
And this is from the end of the night.

622
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,971
Oh, my God.

623
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:55,048
Oh, my God, what?

624
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:57,599
She has my necklace.

625
00:32:59,684 --> 00:33:01,584
She's the one who attacked me.

626
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,223
Ballantine, what's happening?

627
00:33:24,894 --> 00:33:26,716
<i>The machine's taxing our energy.</i>

628
00:33:26,847 --> 00:33:28,750
Then find the flaw
and eliminate the problem.

629
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,682
<i>We oughta power down,
make sure the subject</i>

630
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:31,535
is all right.

631
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:32,851
It's under control.

632
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,056
Concentrate on a solution.

633
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:43,904
I'm not drunk!

634
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:45,325
<i>Don't yell.</i>

635
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:48,074
<i>- You'll wake Sara.</i>
- Sorry I missed the recital.

636
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,923
I just... I lost track
of time, that's all.

637
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:52,637
I don't like what I'm seeing here!
He could stroke out!

638
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,915
<i>Ballantine, can you hear me in there?</i>

639
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:57,000
- <i>That's enough.</i>
- <i>Kyle's mind is</i>

640
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,109
<i>far more advanced,
and his resistance is stronger.</i>

641
00:33:59,232 --> 00:34:01,004
<i>We have to see how far
this machine can go.</i>

642
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:03,843
Proceed as directed.

643
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,612
<i>Are you looking at my boobs again?</i>

644
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:12,432
<i>I'm paying you in pizza for
a reality show audition tape.</i>

645
00:34:12,674 --> 00:34:15,561
Did you hear me use the word soft-core
anywhere in our agreement?

646
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,125
- No.
- Josh, listen. I'm sorry.

647
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:20,773
I had no idea that I'd get you
kicked out of the contest.

648
00:34:21,034 --> 00:34:22,609
<i>No thanks to your little ambush.</i>

649
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:24,110
Get a life.

650
00:34:25,557 --> 00:34:27,280
You know what? My career as a tabloid

651
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,565
journalist is officially over.

652
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:29,782
We just cut.

653
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:37,665
You can slow it down.

654
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:47,248
- It's working.
- Yeah.

655
00:34:54,855 --> 00:34:56,167
I saw this...

656
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:58,186
in that place underground.

657
00:34:59,457 --> 00:35:00,542
Wait.

658
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,939
What is this?

659
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:07,904
My sister.

660
00:35:10,713 --> 00:35:12,241
Hello! Personal crisis here.

661
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:14,762
Lori, are you okay?
Did you find something?

662
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:16,664
The minute she takes
her hand off that car,

663
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:18,624
I rip it off her arm and bitch-slap her.

664
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:20,165
You can't hit her. Call the police.

665
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,285
Trager, hold on!

666
00:35:21,846 --> 00:35:22,877
I want to see more.

667
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:25,379
Here we go.

668
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:33,679
I can't see anything. It's dark.

669
00:35:34,017 --> 00:35:34,889
Do you hear that?

670
00:35:37,281 --> 00:35:38,627
I'm in a dark room.

671
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:44,083
I don't know where I am.

672
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:45,316
Don't be afraid.

673
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:58,469
<i>Emily's there.</i>

674
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,831
But I don't remember this happening.

675
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:06,561
<i>What's going on?</i>

676
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,557
God, you're just a kid.

677
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:27,232
That's it. Don't be afraid.

678
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:29,989
She shot me.

679
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,424
Are you okay?

680
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:52,670
I don't know what I am anymore.

681
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:58,029
I finally accomplished what I wanted.

682
00:36:58,672 --> 00:37:00,777
I knew the truth about who she was.

683
00:37:01,468 --> 00:37:03,509
<i>But how could I explain it to her?</i>

684
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:29,145
What did I miss?

685
00:37:29,843 --> 00:37:33,495
Well, the circuits got overloaded
from all the sound equipment and lights.

686
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:35,402
There was some sort of explosion.

687
00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:36,605
My God.

688
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,400
But Kyle and Jessi are okay.

689
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:43,393
Would it be totally wrong
for me to ask you who won?

690
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,766
Technically, Kyle and Jessi both won.

691
00:37:46,902 --> 00:37:49,299
But since they can't split
the car without a chainsaw,

692
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:51,840
the judges decided
to give it to the charity.

693
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,008
That's an entire day wasted.

694
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:57,057
I, on the other hand,
have been very productive.

695
00:37:57,303 --> 00:37:58,496
Check this out.

696
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,968
How sweet is this?

697
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,305
My very own lame slogan.

698
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:06,808
So you're ready to go public?

699
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:09,746
I guess I kinda did already.

700
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:12,963
Besides, if I don't have this on,

701
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:14,649
yours would look really stupid.

702
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:17,902
"I'm with Cancer Girl. "

703
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:20,650
But you'll always have
to stand on my left,

704
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:21,990
or it won't make sense.

705
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,854
That's awesome.

706
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:27,954
You're awesome.

707
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:32,459
You're kind of awesome, too.

708
00:38:39,196 --> 00:38:40,974
That's not how you do it.

709
00:38:58,331 --> 00:39:00,195
Nicole, what happened?

710
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:01,593
Are they okay?

711
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:03,823
Yeah, they're both doing fine.
They're resting.

712
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:05,700
You stay the hell away from my family!

713
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,035
- Lori!
- What?

714
00:39:07,155 --> 00:39:09,370
Her nutcase sister
is the one who attacked me.

715
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,371
No,

716
00:39:10,491 --> 00:39:11,545
Jessi wouldn't do that.

717
00:39:11,668 --> 00:39:13,500
There must be a logical
explanation for this.

718
00:39:14,534 --> 00:39:16,669
You're gonna listen to her
and not your own daughter?

719
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:21,358
I don't even want to talk to you.

720
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:23,176
- Honey, wait.
- Mom, please.

721
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:36,159
How did you do it?

722
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,244
How did you know how to make me rember?

723
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:51,610
They were your memories.

724
00:39:53,366 --> 00:39:54,624
They were there all along.

725
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:57,911
But I don't understand.

726
00:39:58,415 --> 00:39:59,912
How could they be my memories?

727
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:02,382
How was I ever that girl
we saw in the dark?

728
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,792
There's something
I think you should know.

729
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:12,809
I have a feeling we're
more alike than you think.

730
00:40:14,908 --> 00:40:16,521
What do you mean?

731
00:40:57,181 --> 00:40:58,500
They said you could...

732
00:41:11,496 --> 00:41:12,676
Amanda, wait!

733
00:41:12,947 --> 00:41:14,912
I trusted you when you broke our date

734
00:41:15,795 --> 00:41:18,410
I trusted you with Jessi,
even when I didn't think I should.

735
00:41:19,581 --> 00:41:20,941
I thought you were different.

736
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:22,128
It's not what you think.

737
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:23,459
No?

738
00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:25,173
What was it, then?

739
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:27,425
We were just talking.

740
00:41:28,815 --> 00:41:30,511
If you had any idea how much of a guy

741
00:41:30,631 --> 00:41:31,896
you sound like right now.

742
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:34,127
Amanda, you know me better than that.

743
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:36,351
Please, just believe in me.

744
00:41:38,025 --> 00:41:39,687
That's what Charlie always said.

745
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,316
Jessi, thank God.

746
00:41:54,463 --> 00:41:56,726
I have been looking for you all night.

747
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:58,062
Hi, Mommy!

748
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:03,920
Hi, sweetheart.

749
00:42:11,047 --> 00:42:12,412
What do you want?

750
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,601
I wanna know who I really am.

751
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:27,658
<i>That morning, Nicole had asked me
how well I knew Jessi.</i>

752
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:30,731
<i>Now I understood
she was someone like me.</i>

753
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:35,071
<i>The discovery left me even more
troubled and confused...</i>

754
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,140
<i>and wondering what
it might have cost me.</i>

755
00:42:43,137 --> 00:42:44,563
I just spoke to the police.

756
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,694
They went to Emily's house
to look for Jessi, and she's gone.

757
00:42:47,837 --> 00:42:48,715
She's run away.
