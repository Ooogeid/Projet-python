1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,927
Previously on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:03,034
Then no good-byes.

3
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:05,570
- Just like "See ya. "
- See ya.

4
00:00:05,668 --> 00:00:07,266
You've proven you can keep my secrets.

5
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:10,254
If there was anything to tell,
don't you think I'd bring you in on it?

6
00:00:10,337 --> 00:00:11,346
I'm Adam Baylin.

7
00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:14,505
You're saying I was gestated
inside one of those tanks at Zzyzx.

8
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:16,325
- So you created me.
- Yes.

9
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:19,228
You have to condition yourself,
or you're gonna die too young

10
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:20,884
before you've even had a chance to live.

11
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:22,156
This is Brian Taylor.

12
00:00:22,236 --> 00:00:24,049
- Nice to meet you.
- You as well.

13
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:25,732
I've heard a lot about you.

14
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:36,382
- He's been shot!
- Zzyzx will kill him. I'll go tonight

15
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,680
- and eliminate the threat.
- You'll do nothing.

16
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:40,343
You'll harm no one.

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,353
- They're innocent!
- They're not innocent!

18
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:47,006
They killed Baylin and they'll kill you!

19
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:52,329
Kyle, you can't go back to the Tragers.

20
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,759
I lied so that I could leave,
and now I'll lie so that I can return.

21
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:58,526
I'll do everything in my
power to live by the truth.

22
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:00,657
Why do you wanna go back,
complicate your life?

23
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,746
It's not complicated. It's simple.

24
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:03,950
I love them.

25
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:18,463
- Oh, Kyle...
- This is great.

26
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:20,126
It's so good to see you again.

27
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:22,591
- How long can you stay?
- What are you doing here?

28
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:24,244
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

29
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:25,809
Did your parents come with you?

30
00:01:25,904 --> 00:01:29,019
Let's give this guy a chance
to catch his breath here.

31
00:01:29,137 --> 00:01:30,155
Are you okay?

32
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,815
I'll never forget that
look on their faces,

33
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:34,569
the joy and relief.

34
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:36,458
They seemed so happy to see me.

35
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:40,414
I wanted to tell them the truth
about everything that had happened,

36
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,295
but I wanted to be at home
with them even more.

37
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:45,940
Is that your folks?

38
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:48,674
And that meant playing
my part in the charade.

39
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,806
- Mr. Trager ?
- Yes.

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,377
My name's Brian Taylor.

41
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:59,629
I'm the attorney for
David and Julia Peterson.

42
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:01,675
Attorney?

43
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,158
- Well, come on in.
- Thank you.

44
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:10,684
Is everything all right?

45
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:17,711
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but

46
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:20,843
David and Julia were killed
in a car accident last week.

47
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,034
My God.

48
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:15,762
What are you doing?

49
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:20,458
Thank you.

50
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,714
It's not even my birthday.

51
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:26,908
The hell?

52
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,018
No belly button?

53
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,953
No, no, no. Don't be scared, sweetheart.

54
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,143
We can be friends.

55
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:45,386
You want some?

56
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:46,696
Here.

57
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,888
Warm you up.

58
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,069
Go on.

59
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:50,962
There. Yeah.

60
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:58,600
That wasn't very nice.

61
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,097
Now, you gotta be nice.

62
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:29,588
You wanna play?

63
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:32,050
Let's play.

64
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,756
Give me the knife.

65
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:49,123
Give it to me!

66
00:04:58,104 --> 00:04:59,675
Why you little...

Season 2 Episode 2
- The Homecoming -

70
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:28,475
Get me Hollander.

71
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:32,790
According to the police report,
David lost control of the car and it

72
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:34,365
plunged into a canyon.

73
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:37,485
The gas tank was punctured and the...

74
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:40,808
- car caught fire.
- Oh, that's horrible.

75
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:44,883
But for the grace of God, Noah decided
to sleep in that morning.

76
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:49,023
Otherwise, we would be having
a far more difficult conversation.

77
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,427
And you say this happened a week ago?

78
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:53,132
That's right.

79
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:57,295
Well, I'm just surprised that Kyle...

80
00:06:57,427 --> 00:07:00,212
Sorry, we'll still not used
to his real name.

81
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:01,518
Oh, I understand.

82
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:04,955
Why didn't he contact us sooner?

83
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:08,264
Well, he missed you terribly.

84
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:10,819
And to be honest, I...

85
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:12,885
Well I had to insist
that he come here at all.

86
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,804
He was rather reluctant to involve you
and your family again.

87
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:16,922
Why?

88
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:20,503
He felt that he'd already
been enough of a burden.

89
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:22,687
Kyle's never been a burden.

90
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:24,788
I'm glad to hear you say that.

91
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:28,978
See, Julia and David named you
as his permanent guardians.

92
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,117
His... guardians?

93
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,294
It's not that we don't want Kyle.

94
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,979
We went through so much

95
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,885
when we lost him the first time.

96
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,651
If he stays here and another relative
comes to take him away again...

97
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:48,358
There are no other relatives,
Mr. and Mrs. Trager.

98
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,172
It's a lot to take in.

99
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:56,263
I understand. You need time to think.

100
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:59,495
We're staying at a
hotel near the airport.

101
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:01,897
Would it be all right
if he spent the night here?

102
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,206
I'm... I'm sure he'd like
that very much.

103
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:09,428
I'm planning on leaving
town tomorrow evening.

104
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,226
Really the only question
for me is whether

105
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,531
I'm buying one plane ticket or two.

106
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,562
Mom was having a symbolic moment.

107
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:25,687
A way of letting you go.

108
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:27,809
Well,

109
00:08:28,036 --> 00:08:30,081
I always knew you'd be back.

110
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:32,920
You did?

111
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:35,849
Not like this...

112
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:37,647
but, yeah.

113
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,688
Kyle, are you okay?

114
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:54,448
I mean...

115
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:57,011
I'm sorry. I know that sounds lame.

116
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:58,485
No.

117
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:01,571
I don't know what else to say.

118
00:09:03,482 --> 00:09:05,545
You don't have to say anything.

119
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,960
So, is it weird

120
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,692
being back here?

121
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:13,888
A little.

122
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:21,538
There.

123
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:22,910
That's better.

124
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:25,712
Glad to see it?

125
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:29,025
Very.

126
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,842
Welcome, Emily Hollander.

127
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,191
Ms. Hollander, you've handled some...

128
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:59,004
unusual assignments for us before.

129
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:00,363
I like unusual.

130
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:02,292
This case is no exception.

131
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:04,937
In fact, it's a highly sensitive matter

132
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:06,965
that requires the utmost discretion.

133
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:08,918
Well, now I'm intrigued.

134
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:13,622
Madacorp is like an iceberg.

135
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:17,077
Most of its interests lie
beneath the surface.

136
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,864
As did Zzyzx,

137
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:21,966
one of our research facilities.

138
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,411
I say "did" because Zzyzx
was fire bombed this week.

139
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:28,023
By whom?

140
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:31,534
That's unclear at the moment,
but there is a...

141
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:34,196
much more pressing concern.

142
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:41,848
Zzyzx experimented
with artificial reproduction

143
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:44,075
and produced two primary assets.

144
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:48,467
The first was a male called "XY."

145
00:10:48,873 --> 00:10:52,006
He was terminated sometime
last year for reasons unknown.

146
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:55,406
The second is a female, XX.

147
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:58,358
She apparently survived the bombing

148
00:10:58,505 --> 00:10:59,673
and escaped.

149
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:01,677
Escaped?

150
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:05,519
I take it the subject
has outgrown her petri dish.

151
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:07,857
She's fully-developed.

152
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,121
Human, yet not human.

153
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,110
She's had no contact
with the outside world.

154
00:11:13,196 --> 00:11:16,417
Consider her dangerous,
unpredictable, and disoriented.

155
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:19,854
She's likely still wandering
around the woods near Victor Falls.

156
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:22,129
And I assume
that you don't want her to go camping.

157
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,588
I want her here.

158
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:25,753
There's no telling what she might do
and we can't

159
00:11:25,924 --> 00:11:28,599
risk any exposure to the company.

160
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,386
Shouldn't be too much
of a challenge for you.

161
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:34,650
I know what you accomplished in Iraq.

162
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:38,330
I'll find her for you, sir.

163
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:43,756
I wish you'd let us know.

164
00:11:43,842 --> 00:11:46,359
We would've flown out there
to be with you.

165
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:48,549
Everything happened so fast.

166
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,577
Well, you're here with us now.

167
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:52,380
It's okay, you know?

168
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,191
It's normal if you...

169
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:56,957
feel some anger
or a sense of injustice...

170
00:11:57,498 --> 00:11:58,593
Injustice?

171
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:01,887
You finally reunited
with your parents and...

172
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,650
Things don't always turn out
like you expect them to.

173
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:14,518
Well, you need anything else?

174
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:16,948
No.

175
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:23,844
Thank you.

176
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:26,094
Sure.

177
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:32,168
It's so good to see you again.

178
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:35,902
Good night.

179
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:48,619
I couldn't help but think back to
the last night I'd spent in this room.

180
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:51,276
It was the beginning of my secret life,

181
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,657
before I left with the Petersons.

182
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:57,221
And now I was home,
hiding even more secrets.

183
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:03,196
I could only hope
that whatever fate had in store for me,

184
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:06,497
it would be kind and forgiving
to the people I loved.

185
00:13:15,222 --> 00:13:16,537
What a day.

186
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:19,328
I'm exhausted.

187
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,343
It's just so hard to believe.

188
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:25,380
I know.
You kept sensing something was wrong.

189
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,747
I never dreamed of anything like this.

190
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,189
You're not feeling guilty are you?

191
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:39,287
I can tell you're happy
that Kyle's home...

192
00:13:39,672 --> 00:13:41,467
miserable about the reason.

193
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:43,736
When did you become
the psychologist in the family?

194
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:45,766
I learn by osmosis.

195
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,385
I missed Kyle so much...

196
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:51,656
and I'm thrilled that he's here, but...

197
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:53,780
I don't want to lose him again.

198
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:55,940
You heard the lawyer.

199
00:13:56,055 --> 00:13:59,296
Yeah, there are no relatives
that he knows about.

200
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:02,161
I mean, there's still so much
that we don't know.

201
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:06,239
What about those years
when Kyle was missing?

202
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,071
We still don't know
what happened to him{\then}.

203
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:09,489
Yeah, well...

204
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:12,108
I guess we're always going
to have questions.

205
00:14:13,314 --> 00:14:16,732
The only one we could answer
right now is, do we want him to be...

206
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:18,146
part of our family?

207
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:15,499
Okay, just remember, Kyle's been
through a lot, so be extra sensitive.

208
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,582
- Why you looking at me?
- Cause you're such

209
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,567
a model of tact and compassion.

210
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,070
Fine. I won't speak.

211
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:24,496
Can we have that in writing?

212
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:27,428
Guys, stop.
The point is Kyle needs our support.

213
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,701
But don't press him.

214
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:31,744
Let him deal with this in his own time
in his own way.

215
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:37,495
- Good morning.
- Morning!

216
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,260
- Sleep okay?
- I haven't slept so well in days.

217
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:44,955
Nothing beats a cold slab of porcelain.

218
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,137
Sorry.

219
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:49,999
- Are you hungry?
- I'll make pancakes.

220
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:51,769
I missed your pancakes.

221
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:53,418
I think we're out of syrup.

222
00:15:53,593 --> 00:15:56,463
- Who finished the syrup?
- I didn't know we were rationing.

223
00:15:56,577 --> 00:15:58,509
- It's okay.
- I'll go get some more.

224
00:15:58,667 --> 00:15:59,822
No, wait.

225
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:02,967
You don't have to be so nice.

226
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:05,247
Just be yourselves.

227
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:08,148
You know what I mean.

228
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:13,064
You're all trying to make me feel better
and I appreciate it, but the truth is...

229
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,713
just being here is enough.

230
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:21,731
Excuse me.

231
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:24,670
- Hello?
- How did it go?

232
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,357
Fine.

233
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:29,106
- Are they there right now?
- Yes.

234
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:32,946
We need to talk.

235
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:35,618
So meet me later like we agreed.

236
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,479
Okay, I will, good-bye.

237
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:40,839
Was that Mr. Taylor?

238
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:43,648
Cool phone.

239
00:16:44,054 --> 00:16:46,680
- You know, I could use a new one.
- Good. Go buy one.

240
00:16:47,077 --> 00:16:48,183
- Seriously?
- Sure.

241
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:50,691
Just as soon as you get
that after-school job to pay for it.

242
00:16:50,857 --> 00:16:52,811
Check the job board at The Rack.

243
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:54,826
I'm meeting Declan there for lunch.

244
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:56,017
How is Declan?

245
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:58,735
An eternal ray of sunshine.

246
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,231
He's in a gunk.

247
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:01,880
A what?

248
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:04,541
A guy funk. Totally gender-specific.

249
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:07,411
You should come with.
Maybe you can shake him out of it.

250
00:17:07,564 --> 00:17:10,251
If a guy funk is a gunk,
then what's a girl funk?

251
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:12,113
Redundant.

252
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:25,508
It's Hollander. I found our girl.

253
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:28,149
Or at least what she left behind.

254
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,920
Where are you?

255
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,544
In the woods, east of the Zzyzx complex.

256
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:34,693
How long ago since she was there?

257
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:38,162
By the looks of things, it couldn't
have been more than four or five hours.

258
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,955
Is there anything
I should be concerned about?

259
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:46,742
Not unless you count the dead guy
covered in pink goo.

260
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:50,156
Clean it off.

261
00:17:50,248 --> 00:17:53,002
So nothing can be traced back
to the company.

262
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:54,320
What the...

263
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,458
What is it?

264
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:58,702
Hold on.

265
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:11,252
She must be exceptionally strong.

266
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:13,075
You forgot to mention that.

267
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:16,708
As I told you, I have no idea
what she's capable of.

268
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,281
Find her before she kills again.

269
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:21,624
Is that clear?

270
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:23,423
Crystal.

271
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:43,179
What's the trick?

272
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,451
Once you teach your mind to alter
the positive and negative polarity

273
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:48,584
of the cells in your body...
The glass will move.

274
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:51,020
Not the glass. The water inside it.

275
00:18:56,278 --> 00:18:57,652
What are you doing?

276
00:18:58,018 --> 00:18:59,148
Oh, hey, Josh.

277
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,301
- Why were you zoning out like that?
- Was I?

278
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:05,741
You were staring at that glass.

279
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,360
I was thirsty.

280
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:08,947
Right.

281
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,978
Come on, did you learn some new tricks
while you were away?

282
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:14,709
I don't do tricks.

283
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:17,976
You forget I kept records, okay?

284
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:20,568
And I'd be more than happy
to bust out that file

285
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,380
if you've got something new
you want to show me.

286
00:19:24,342 --> 00:19:26,132
Okay, I do have something.

287
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,216
But we have to concentrate really hard
if we want it to work.

288
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:30,467
Absolutely.

289
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:32,269
Face the glass.

290
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:34,895
- Close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?

291
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,260
Do you want it to work?

292
00:19:48,505 --> 00:19:49,635
Open them.

293
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:51,986
I made the water disappear.

294
00:20:01,654 --> 00:20:02,969
- Hi.
- Hey.

295
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:05,440
Welcome back.

296
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:08,319
It's good to see you.

297
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:11,578
You don't look any different.

298
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:13,513
You don't look like you're in a gunk.

299
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:15,513
A gunk?

300
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:18,745
Lori thinks I'm depressed.

301
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:19,703
Are you?

302
00:20:20,224 --> 00:20:21,256
No...

303
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:23,588
but you've had me
freaked out and worried.

304
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:24,957
There's no reason to be.

305
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:27,462
Right, because being
the keeper of your secret code

306
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:30,223
and good-bye message
shouldn't have given me any anxiety.

307
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,202
You should forget about that box.

308
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,850
Forget it?

309
00:20:34,477 --> 00:20:36,493
It's been torturing me for months.

310
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:39,093
Everything's fine now.

311
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,937
No, everything's not fine.

312
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,641
Come on, you can't come back out of

313
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:45,060
nowhere and not tell me what happened.

314
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,153
Sorry, I have to be somewhere right now.

315
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:50,358
Where?

316
00:20:50,678 --> 00:20:52,067
I just gotta go.

317
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:56,260
Not cool, Kyle.

318
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,534
After everything?

319
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,173
Just not cool!

320
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:23,442
What is she wearing?

321
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,905
Come on, now.

322
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:40,675
We need to go.

323
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:13,939
Get the ball.

324
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,251
Can I have my ball back?

325
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:28,061
I appreciate you seeing me.

326
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:30,225
It's my pleasure.

327
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:32,585
I understand you've got a very
weighty decision to make.

328
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:34,233
No, we love Kyle.

329
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:37,201
I mean, that's not the issue.
It's just that...

330
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:39,905
he left here with
so many questions unanswered.

331
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,798
Well, I'll do my best
to answer them for you.

332
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,875
That five-year period when Kyle was lost

333
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:48,802
and the Petersons were looking for him,

334
00:23:48,882 --> 00:23:50,450
he couldn't remember any of it.

335
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:54,704
Well, he did through therapy
in Connecticut.

336
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,264
He was abducted

337
00:23:59,344 --> 00:24:01,173
by a man named Adam Baylin.

338
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:03,756
Adam Baylin, that was the...

339
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:06,858
name of the grad student
who looked like Kyle.

340
00:24:07,854 --> 00:24:09,178
Apparently,

341
00:24:09,277 --> 00:24:10,506
Noah...

342
00:24:10,605 --> 00:24:13,518
bore a striking resemblance
to Baylin's dead son.

343
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:15,928
He kidnapped him.

344
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:18,385
Clearly deluded, he...

345
00:24:18,465 --> 00:24:21,425
raised him as his own
for the next five years.

346
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,675
Now, the good news, if there can be any

347
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:27,047
in these circumstances,
is that he treated him very well.

348
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:30,591
Noah said that they spent
most of their time together with

349
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:32,033
him teaching him.

350
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:34,590
Teaching him? Teaching him what?

351
00:24:34,996 --> 00:24:37,547
Mathematics, physics.

352
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,895
Baylin was a scholar.

353
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:41,019
And as you know,

354
00:24:41,118 --> 00:24:43,321
Noah's very talented in those areas.

355
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,671
How did Kyle end up wandering
in the woods that day?

356
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:52,658
Baylin was a very tortured soul.

357
00:24:55,498 --> 00:24:56,986
He took his own life,

358
00:24:57,072 --> 00:24:58,323
leaving Noah...

359
00:24:58,403 --> 00:24:59,559
alone,

360
00:24:59,657 --> 00:25:00,825
distraught.

361
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,526
Eventually, he just wandered off.

362
00:25:04,612 --> 00:25:06,812
I believe that's where you came in.

363
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:15,170
Noah has come to terms with this.

364
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:19,071
He wants to put the past
to rest and move forward.

365
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:21,346
My hope is that he can do that

366
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:23,387
with the love and support
of your family.

367
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:33,981
Female Caucasian, hair black,
blood-stained shirt only.

368
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:36,206
Behavior erratic, considered dangerous.

369
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:38,833
Sighted on MacGowan,
north of Juniper Park.

370
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:01,242
You made it.

371
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:04,674
What's all this?

372
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:07,035
Baylin's belongings.

373
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,444
His journals and his books,

374
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,821
his research.

375
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:13,997
You'll understand it better than I can.

376
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,423
How'd it go with the Tragers?

377
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:19,973
It's hard...

378
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:22,451
not telling them the truth.

379
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:26,411
I'm going to tell Declan.

380
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:27,923
No, you're not.

381
00:26:28,305 --> 00:26:30,432
I need to. He already
knows a lot of the story.

382
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:33,149
How?

383
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:36,579
Before I left, he was helping me.

384
00:26:36,936 --> 00:26:38,915
There was no one else who understood.

385
00:26:39,112 --> 00:26:40,661
What, and now...

386
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,614
And now you're back
and he's asking questions?

387
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:46,217
- I can explain it to him.
- No, you can't.

388
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:49,172
For the same reason you can't
explain to the Tragers.

389
00:26:49,252 --> 00:26:52,156
- He already knows more than they do.
- Well, that's your mistake!

390
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:54,617
What were you thinking?

391
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:58,831
He's my friend. I can trust him.

392
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:01,215
You're the one who said
you wanted to come back!

393
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:03,652
You said you understood the way
things were going to work.

394
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,961
There are consequences
for my decision. I know that.

395
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,427
But you obviously don't!

396
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:09,507
Because the only logical move
is to shut him out.

397
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,760
I need someone I can talk to.

398
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,983
Then you know what?
Go ahead. Tell him...

399
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:15,664
Tell him everything.

400
00:27:15,983 --> 00:27:17,262
Tell him all.

401
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,034
Tell him about the experiments

402
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:23,010
and the murders and the lies
that you've been perpetrating.

403
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,601
We'll wait and see how long it takes

404
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:27,192
before somebody else
catches wind of who you are

405
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,630
and what you can do
and drags you out of there!

406
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:31,430
Is that what you want?

407
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:43,911
That's... That's...

408
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:45,473
what we're here to explore.

409
00:27:47,022 --> 00:27:49,648
And that's why you can't explain,
because that...

410
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:52,292
that is unexplainable.

411
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,773
This smoothie has chunks.

412
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:06,189
Chunks are good. They add texture.

413
00:29:06,816 --> 00:29:09,447
- Hey, is that your...
- My Kyle file?

414
00:29:09,939 --> 00:29:11,101
Still that alien trip?

415
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:13,318
Not unless he does something
notebook-worthy again,

416
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,273
which, thus far, nada.

417
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,708
His parents just died.

418
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,826
I don't think his mission
is to amaze you.

419
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:20,252
He could throw me a bone...

420
00:29:20,351 --> 00:29:22,834
start speaking in tongues,
run a two-minute mile,

421
00:29:22,945 --> 00:29:25,161
predict a tsunami or something.

422
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,841
He's only been back a day.
Give him time.

423
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:30,638
I just hope Kyle is still...

424
00:29:31,474 --> 00:29:32,728
Kyle.

425
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,407
Hey.

426
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:38,882
- Hi.
- Hey.

427
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:41,255
How's the job search going?

428
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,538
I still haven't found
my ideal work situation.

429
00:29:44,646 --> 00:29:45,753
Which is?

430
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:49,982
Sitting around, eye-groping
unattainable cheerleaders.

431
00:29:50,234 --> 00:29:51,721
Which he does here.

432
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:56,633
Here.

433
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:01,394
You're a genius.

434
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:04,290
Please. I don't even think
you could work a blender.

435
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:06,134
Yo, you're hiring?

436
00:30:25,354 --> 00:30:27,003
Anything interesting?

437
00:30:29,116 --> 00:30:31,552
Oh, my God!
Kyle, what are you doing here?

438
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,444
I'm meeting Josh and Lori.

439
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,781
No, I don't mean here.
I mean here as in in town.

440
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:37,403
I got in last night.

441
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:39,536
I can't believe it.
How long are you staying?

442
00:30:39,653 --> 00:30:41,285
Still trying to figure that out.

443
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:44,305
Well, make it as long as possible.
We've got so much to catch up on.

444
00:30:44,464 --> 00:30:46,213
Well, let's catch up now.

445
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:47,834
I can't. I'm waiting for Charlie.

446
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:50,206
Charlie?

447
00:30:50,285 --> 00:30:52,726
Yeah, you know, tall, dark,
perpetually late boyfriend?

448
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:56,652
- You're still together.
- Yeah, why wouldn't we be?

449
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,461
Anyhow, can we catch up later?

450
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:04,231
How about tonight?

451
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:07,164
We're going to a concert.
Believe me, I'd love to bail,

452
00:31:07,274 --> 00:31:10,705
but Charlie waited in line for,
like, two days to get the tickets.

453
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:12,637
But promise me you'll find time.

454
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:14,729
I promise.

455
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:16,968
Then I know it'll happen.

456
00:31:23,902 --> 00:31:25,518
I'm so glad you're here.

457
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:26,849
Me, too.

458
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:10,296
Hello?

459
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,379
I'm not here to hurt you.
Do you understand?

460
00:32:17,361 --> 00:32:19,197
I'm here to take you home.

461
00:32:23,988 --> 00:32:25,031
Okay,

462
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:28,167
I'm coming in now.
Don't do anything crazy.

463
00:32:29,534 --> 00:32:31,705
Anything crazier than this.

464
00:32:32,781 --> 00:32:33,826
All right.

465
00:32:42,748 --> 00:32:43,847
It's okay.

466
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:49,356
Easy, now.

467
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:55,369
You're okay.

468
00:32:57,457 --> 00:32:59,200
God, you're just a kid.

469
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:03,037
Hi.

470
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:04,996
My name's Emily.

471
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,877
That's it. Don't be afraid.

472
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:12,060
I'm here to help you.

473
00:33:13,168 --> 00:33:14,339
I'm your friend.

474
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:19,407
You like the light? Yeah.

475
00:33:23,098 --> 00:33:25,077
You're just going to go
to sleep for a while.

476
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,463
- Ballantine.
- It's Hollander. I've got her.

477
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,002
- Where are you?
- We're in a dockyard

478
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,448
about six miles west
of the interstate on Route 16

479
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:09,055
in a shipping container
near the back fence.

480
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:10,653
Well, bring her in.

481
00:34:10,796 --> 00:34:14,727
Yeah, there's something here you're
going to want to see for yourself.

482
00:34:19,116 --> 00:34:20,489
Kidnapped?

483
00:34:21,396 --> 00:34:22,441
I know.

484
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:24,847
- It's tough to hear.
- It's horrible.

485
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,253
His amnesia helped protect him

486
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,008
until he was ready
to deal with the experience.

487
00:34:30,783 --> 00:34:33,600
Fortunately, Kyle seems
to have made peace with it.

488
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:36,087
Josh? You okay?

489
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,585
Yeah, but a kidnapping.

490
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:42,029
It's just so...

491
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:44,229
ordinary.

492
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:47,635
Yeah, it's great that Kyle's okay,

493
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:51,606
but this completely blows my alien
abduction theory out of the water.

494
00:34:51,885 --> 00:34:54,006
There is something
seriously wrong with you.

495
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,445
Look, we just wanted you both to know

496
00:34:56,551 --> 00:34:58,814
everything before we make
our final decision.

497
00:34:58,914 --> 00:35:02,492
When Kyle first came here, everything
about him was a mystery and

498
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,148
now it's all clear.

499
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:06,142
And what we're left with is a boy.

500
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,575
A remarkable boy who has no one else
in the world but us.

501
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:14,890
And once we sign those custody papers,
he'll be one of us.

502
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:16,468
Here to stay.

503
00:35:16,689 --> 00:35:18,241
Of course you should sign.

504
00:35:22,406 --> 00:35:23,728
Kyle's still the man.

505
00:35:25,438 --> 00:35:26,685
Even if he is ordinary.

506
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:38,871
Tough day?

507
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,719
What are you doing here?

508
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:44,157
Listen, man, I get
that whatever you have to say

509
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,518
is gonna be a little off
the chart of normal,

510
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,165
but I can take it.

511
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,484
I really can't talk about that.

512
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,563
- Why?
- Because I don't want to lie to you.

513
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:56,887
- Well, then, tell me the truth.
- That's not possible.

514
00:35:58,249 --> 00:36:00,351
I don't understand any of this.

515
00:36:01,545 --> 00:36:03,983
That guy Tom Foss hid
cameras in this house.

516
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:06,263
Someone came after you with a gun, Kyle.

517
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:07,750
It's all been taken care of.

518
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:11,284
What are you... What are you
talking about? By who?

519
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:15,637
Do you have any idea what I've had
to deal with, keeping your secret?

520
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,456
I've been lying to Lori for months,

521
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:20,640
I can't focus, my grades are screwed,

522
00:36:21,276 --> 00:36:22,733
my dad is all over me...

523
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:25,487
the only thing
that's kept me remotely sane

524
00:36:25,614 --> 00:36:28,526
was knowing that one day you would
tell me what the hell you got me into

525
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:30,458
and it would all be worth it.

526
00:36:31,253 --> 00:36:34,352
Look me in the eye
and tell me all of it was for nothing.

527
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,480
It wasn't for nothing.

528
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:42,583
And I can't say any more.

529
00:37:05,896 --> 00:37:07,194
Our girl's been busy.

530
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:11,909
They offer art classes at Zzyzx?

531
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,729
Must be all the people that she came
into contact within the last 48 hours.

532
00:37:24,428 --> 00:37:25,484
Can't be.

533
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:28,210
Who is he?

534
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:30,743
The other asset.

535
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:33,474
XY?

536
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:36,921
Thought you said he was terminated.

537
00:37:37,142 --> 00:37:39,268
That's what I was led to believe.

538
00:37:40,657 --> 00:37:42,956
But if she saw him out there...

539
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,981
Your next assignment, Ms. Hollander...

540
00:37:49,026 --> 00:37:50,197
has just begun.

541
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:05,445
- Boy, I'm starving.
- That looks good.

542
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:11,633
I didn't hear you come in.

543
00:38:12,368 --> 00:38:13,507
Everything all right?

544
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:19,487
I know my coming back here
hasn't been easy.

545
00:38:21,138 --> 00:38:23,924
The last thing I want to do
is make trouble for you.

546
00:38:25,222 --> 00:38:27,753
You never brought anything
but love into this house.

547
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:34,388
Would you like to tell us something?

548
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:40,220
Noah.

549
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:42,246
We know about Adam Baylin.

550
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,933
You do?

551
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:47,961
Mr. Taylor told me everything.

552
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:50,738
And we understand
you want to move on, so

553
00:38:51,049 --> 00:38:54,450
we'll just take our cue from you, okay?

554
00:38:56,513 --> 00:38:57,526
Okay.

555
00:38:58,764 --> 00:39:02,152
And we'd like to sign those custody
papers and make it official.

556
00:39:02,975 --> 00:39:04,020
Thank you.

557
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,040
Can we make one more thing official?

558
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:10,995
What's that?

559
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,658
My legal name is Noah...

560
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:17,811
but I'll never be anybody but Kyle.

561
00:39:20,762 --> 00:39:22,334
My name is Kyle.

562
00:39:24,297 --> 00:39:25,676
We'll take care of it.

563
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:32,889
They believed our story.

564
00:39:33,965 --> 00:39:35,517
This is your home now.

565
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:39,506
They think Adam Baylin abducted me.

566
00:39:40,424 --> 00:39:41,668
Another lie.

567
00:39:41,864 --> 00:39:42,877
My lie.

568
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,516
I had to put the puzzle together

569
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,680
so that they could put the puzzle away.

570
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:52,788
I hope I did the right thing
coming back here.

571
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:56,002
You have what Adam always wanted...

572
00:39:56,098 --> 00:39:57,111
a family.

573
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:02,937
Adam may no longer be here,
but his dream still lives in you.

574
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:06,668
He believed that

575
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:10,427
you could be a shining light
in a world full of darkness.

576
00:40:11,123 --> 00:40:12,168
So do I.

577
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:15,438
The question now is...

578
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:17,786
can you believe in yourself?

579
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,663
I can.

580
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,469
But the secrets that put me here
are the last I'm willing to keep.

581
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:30,465
Well, then, you're already
a better man than most.

582
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,338
Adam wanted me to give you this.

583
00:40:35,637 --> 00:40:37,631
- What is it?
- I don't know.

584
00:40:55,702 --> 00:40:56,700
It's a ring.

585
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,183
It's beautiful.

586
00:41:02,445 --> 00:41:03,450
What's the symbol?

587
00:41:05,293 --> 00:41:06,714
Never seen it before.

588
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,276
When Taylor left,

589
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:19,140
I hoped that the lies
I had to tell left with him,

590
00:41:19,252 --> 00:41:20,629
and that from then on,

591
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:23,702
I could live safely and honestly
with my family.

592
00:41:26,629 --> 00:41:28,681
Kyle, come on. I'm starving.

593
00:41:28,804 --> 00:41:31,103
You'd better sit before things get ugly.

594
00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:37,961
So, here we are.

595
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:41,042
Here we are.

596
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:43,037
Back to normal.

597
00:41:44,556 --> 00:41:45,759
Too normal.

598
00:41:46,222 --> 00:41:47,235
Josh.

599
00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:49,254
Let's eat.

600
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:56,101
Phone's about to ring.

601
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:01,157
The phone... it's about to ring.

602
00:42:06,035 --> 00:42:07,300
How did you do that?

603
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:11,026
I'll tell you how.

604
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:12,895
He's Kyle.

605
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:24,345
- Nobody phones Josh.
- It's probably for you anyway.

606
00:42:25,055 --> 00:42:26,640
They'll call back later.

607
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,608
