1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,000
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:02,765
<i>Kyle?

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,465
Be careful,
even in our backyard.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,300
We have bigger problems
than Mrs. Bloom.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,400
<i>Jessi starts back
at school today.

6
00:00:08,435 --> 00:00:09,665
I sort of levitated.

7
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,600
- Show me how.
- I will.

8
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,865
She's the one
who attacked me.

9
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,800
<i>I know Lori will
never forgive me.

10
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:16,300
<i>You have to earn
forgiveness.

11
00:00:16,404 --> 00:00:18,708
- "She Could Be You. "
- What?

12
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:21,602
The two of you used to play
that song all the time.

13
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:22,501
D4.

14
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:25,000
It's not there.

15
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:26,262
It's a Latnok ring.

16
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:27,763
All the members
received rings.

17
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:29,800
It was a way
of identifying one another.

18
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,463
- And you're Latnok?
- Yes.

19
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:34,003
<i>I got accepted into
a music program in New York.</i>

20
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:36,102
- I leave in two days.
- Two days?

21
00:00:36,706 --> 00:00:37,902
I miss this.

22
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,102
I miss you.

23
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:43,103
I didn't want to go back
to how I was before.

24
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:45,003
<i>How were you before?</i>

25
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:46,960
Invisible.

26
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,601
I'll call...
and text and e-mail.

27
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:51,001
I'm gonna come back to you.

28
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:53,201
- You promise?
- Promise.

29
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:06,103
<i>Spring cleaning,
a curious ritual.

30
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:08,402
<i>Nicole said it meant time
to rid ourselves

31
00:01:08,437 --> 00:01:10,201
<i>of things we didn't
need anymore.

32
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:21,403
<i>The first step
is reflection.

33
00:01:22,507 --> 00:01:23,602
<i>What's worth keeping?

34
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:27,200
<i>What's lost its value
and can be given away?

35
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:40,601
<i>For some,
the choice is easy.

36
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,203
<i>For others,
much more difficult.

37
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,901
Getting rid of all that.

38
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:53,901
Actually, I've gone
through, and...

39
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,301
I like all my things.

40
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:58,300
I don't want
to give them away.

41
00:01:58,406 --> 00:02:00,501
Oh, Kyle, you don't
have to, but...

42
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:03,103
a lot of this stuff
has seen its best day.

43
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,001
Look at this t-shirt.

44
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:06,360
It's shrunk, it's stained,
it's faded.

45
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:08,802
I wore this the first time
Stephen took me to work with him.

46
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:11,103
Well... this one's torn.

47
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,300
I ripped it playing
basketball with Josh.

48
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:14,300
Great game.

49
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:18,101
The first gift Lori
ever gave me.

50
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,501
Sentimental pack rat.
Great.

51
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:21,703
We're in trouble.

52
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,503
Look, this isn't
supposed to be torture.

53
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:26,801
Consider it a chance
to shed your old skin,

54
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:28,200
be someone new.

55
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:32,762
Dude, take a load off.

56
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:34,400
Let's throw this puppy
around for a few.

57
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:36,201
Let me grab the rest
of the boxes first.

58
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,102
The boxes aren't
going anywhere.

59
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:39,463
But I told Nicole that I...

60
00:02:39,508 --> 00:02:41,202
The best part about
spring cleaning

61
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:42,901
is ditching out
on spring cleaning.

62
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:45,803
You can't do it, can ya?

63
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:47,962
You always have to do
the right thing.

64
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:50,400
And you always find a way
of putting fun before work.

65
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:53,300
Alphabetical order,
my encyclopedic friend.

66
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:55,253
But I will have you know,
I'm done with my room.

67
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:57,101
And I'm trashing this
with the rest of my stuff.

68
00:02:58,007 --> 00:02:59,002
But first...

69
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:01,463
Bite marks.

70
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:03,302
Foam.
It's irresistible.

71
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:05,701
Come on.
Show me what you got.

72
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:09,503
Okay.

73
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:16,101
Keep going.

74
00:03:18,705 --> 00:03:19,703
More.

75
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:33,200
Whoa!

<b>Kyle XY

79
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:24,301
You didn't tell me
you were coming.

80
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:25,062
No one knows.

81
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:26,801
I'm surprising my mom
for her birthday.

82
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:28,500
You're a good present.

83
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:29,601
How's New York?

84
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,602
Amazing.
Everything I imagined.

85
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,200
And the music program?

86
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,401
The teachers are
all so inspiring.

87
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:37,401
And the students there
are so talented.

88
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:39,501
Like you.

89
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:42,100
They've all had
incredible training.

90
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:43,653
It was intimidating
at first,

91
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:45,001
but I know
I'm in good company.

92
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:46,752
I'm learning about
composers I never knew...

93
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,440
<i>Amanda's heart
was beating rapidly,

94
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:50,100
<i>and she was speaking
really fast.

95
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:52,703
<i>She seemed happy, but I could sense
that she was troubled.

96
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:54,401
I'm already a better
technical player.

97
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:55,401
Amanda...

98
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:58,502
Is everything all right?

99
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:05,300
I can never hide
anything from you.

100
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,203
But I need to let my mom
know I'm home.

101
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:08,700
Can we get together later?

102
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:09,900
Of course.

103
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:11,002
Good.

104
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:14,403
I guess we need to talk.

105
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:19,701
She said what?

106
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,303
"We need to talk."

107
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:28,000
What is it?

108
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:29,403
Nothing.

109
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:32,300
No, I missed something.

110
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:37,303
Well, when someone says,
"We need to talk,"

111
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,601
sometimes it's a lead in
to a discussion

112
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:42,603
about feelings
that have changed.

113
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:44,403
Feelings?

114
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:46,701
Prepare yourself, dude.
She's dumping you.

115
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:48,601
At least she has the decency
to do it in person.

116
00:05:48,636 --> 00:05:49,460
Don't read into it.

117
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:51,200
Just wait and hear
what she has to say.

118
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:54,601
No. Not my lucky shirt.

119
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:56,801
Josh, you've outgrown it.

120
00:05:57,405 --> 00:05:58,902
<i>I couldn't help but wonder...

121
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:01,703
<i>Had Amanda already
outgrown me?

122
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:10,900
Okay, grab hold of the wire
and make these babies blink.

123
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,263
What?

124
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,402
You turned a block full
of headlights on.

125
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:15,703
This should be easy.

126
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:16,961
Are you serious?

127
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:18,601
You said I look
for ways to slack off.

128
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:20,301
This I take seriously.

129
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:22,552
You have to challenge that
brilliant mind of yours,

130
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:24,702
and someone has to fill in
for that Foss guy, right?

131
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:27,200
Well, that someone,
my friend, will be me.

132
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:28,702
Really?

133
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:30,600
Just,
make 'em blink.

134
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:45,601
Hey. Is it working?

135
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,402
Not really.

136
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,703
Thinking about Amanda drained
all the voltage out of him.

137
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:51,202
Oh. Yeah, I heard.

138
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,800
"We need to talk."

139
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,003
Sorry she left you hanging.

140
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:56,501
Typical woman.

141
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:59,003
Um, anyway...

142
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:00,801
I need to look for
my digital projector.

143
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,860
You giving that away, too?

144
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:04,508
No, I need it for a lecture
I'm giving at U.W.

145
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:06,602
You're giving a lecture?

146
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:12,001
I mean...
you're giving a lecture.

147
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:14,802
I've been asked to speak
at a symposium tomorrow.

148
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:17,403
Are you getting paid
for this thing?

149
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:19,401
Because you're supposed
to bring home the bacon, Dad,

150
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:20,802
and I eat a lot of bacon.

151
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,192
For your information, Josh,
I have already had a job offer.

152
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:25,403
This lecture is about
showing my expertise...

153
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:27,003
for free.

154
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:29,102
Well, I think your expertise
is worth more than that.

155
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:30,502
Thank you, Kyle.

156
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:32,202
I'll let you two
get back to work.

157
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:47,202
What's that?

158
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:49,600
Just an old magazine.

159
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:51,502
- You done in your room?
- Yep.

160
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:55,002
And now I need permission
to boycott an assignment.

161
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:56,701
Let me guess: math.

162
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:58,803
Nope. Me.

163
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:02,061
My guidance counselor
is making everyone

164
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,602
write a two-page essay
about who you really are.

165
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:06,500
I don't know the answer
to that yet.

166
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:08,703
I mean, how old were you
when you figured that out?

167
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,302
I'll let you know
when I get there.

168
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:11,362
Figuring out who you are

169
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:13,503
is a constantly
evolving process.

170
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:15,261
"Constantly evolving process."

171
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:17,001
That's three words.
I need more.

172
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,601
How about "sarcastic,"
"moody," and "cynical"?

173
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:23,101
I didn't ask you.
And I'm not a cynic.

174
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,600
I am totally
"glass is half full. "

175
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:30,101
I just acknowledge that
the other half of the glass

176
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,303
is a desolate void
of disappointment,

177
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:33,802
misery, and regret.

178
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:36,500
Preparing ahead
makes me pragmatic.

179
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:38,402
Uh, speaking of
being prepared...

180
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:40,102
Homework? Done.

181
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:42,302
I know. You should
call Ripley's.

182
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:43,502
I need an opinion.

183
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:45,900
I can't decide which one.

184
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:47,602
What do you guys think,
plaid?

185
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,601
Definitely.

186
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:50,663
Thanks.

187
00:08:50,707 --> 00:08:52,703
You and Amanda should
take a walk around the marina.

188
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:54,200
Sunsets are really pretty.

189
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:57,601
Maybe we will.

190
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:04,901
Dead man walking.

191
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:21,901
- Hi.
- Hello.

192
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:23,100
Can I come in?

193
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:24,601
There's a front door.

194
00:09:24,706 --> 00:09:26,501
I wanted to see you.
This is quicker.

195
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:33,263
What happened?

196
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,503
Oh, I... I slipped
and hit my shoulder.

197
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:37,501
Jumping off another roof?

198
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:39,201
Kyle, I've learned
my lesson.

199
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:40,801
And I'm here to learn
another one.

200
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:42,162
You said I have to
work my way up

201
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,400
to do things like levitate,
so start teaching me.

202
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:45,600
I can't.

203
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:47,000
There's nobody around.

204
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:49,403
I have plans tonight
with Amanda.

205
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,500
Oh, Amanda.
She's home?

206
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:53,800
As a surprise.

207
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:56,462
You're anxious about it.

208
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:58,701
Your heart's beating
really fast, I can tell.

209
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:02,202
She told me,
"We need to talk."

210
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:04,103
So?

211
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:05,901
You don't think
that means anything?

212
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:09,503
Uh... it means she wants
to talk to you?

213
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,002
Isn't that a good thing?

214
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:13,803
That's what I thought.

215
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:17,401
So, uh, when can
we get started?

216
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,700
When Amanda goes back,
I'll have time.

217
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:22,001
Okay.

218
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,500
Well... good-bye.

219
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,600
Bye.

220
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,100
Ready?

221
00:10:52,808 --> 00:10:54,201
Kyle, I can't go out.

222
00:10:55,006 --> 00:10:56,601
But you said
we need to talk.

223
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:58,401
I'm sorry.
I can't see you.

224
00:10:58,435 --> 00:11:00,702
Amanda? Inside!

225
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:11,462
- This is all your fault.
- What?

226
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,403
My daughter flying
clear across the country

227
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:14,662
to surprise me.

228
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:15,862
You're not happy
she's home?

229
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:18,450
I'd be happy if she hadn't
used my birthday

230
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:21,003
as an excuse to tell me
she wants to drop out.

231
00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:23,161
Drop out of
the conservatory? Why?

232
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:25,202
As if you didn't know
you're the reason.

233
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:26,852
She didn't say
anything to me about it.

234
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:28,293
We haven't even
had a chance to talk.

235
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:29,913
You're not gonna
get that chance.

236
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:31,462
You will not see
or speak to Amanda

237
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:34,300
until she's back where she
belongs, at that school.

238
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:43,602
I don't understand why she
won't let me speak to Amanda.

239
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:46,703
Well, unfortunately, Mrs. Bloom
sees you as a distraction.

240
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,103
I just want to know
what happened,

241
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,003
make sure she's okay.

242
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:53,601
Well, put yourself
in Mrs. Bloom's shoes.

243
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:57,902
What I mean is, try to see
things from her perspective.

244
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:00,903
That music conservatory sounds
like a pretty big opportunity,

245
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:02,501
one that Amanda
shouldn't miss.

246
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,502
I don't want her to miss it.

247
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:07,461
But Mrs. Bloom shouldn't
force her to go back.

248
00:12:07,505 --> 00:12:10,302
Kyle, I'm afraid Mrs. Bloom has
every right to send Amanda back

249
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:12,101
whether she wants
to go or not.

250
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:14,601
Just as she has the right
to ask you to stay away.

251
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:16,501
And the hard truth is...

252
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:19,050
it's really none
of our business.

253
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,702
You know what
Amanda means to me.

254
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,303
If she's struggling with,
or confused about something,

255
00:12:23,338 --> 00:12:24,902
how could it be
none of my business?

256
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:33,500
I know you're bummed,
but look at the bright side.

257
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,501
Which, by the way,
is my new M.O.

258
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,200
At least Amanda wasn't
planning on dumping you.

259
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:39,600
How do you know that?

260
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:42,403
Mrs. Bloom blames you
for ruining her life.

261
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:43,860
It seems to me like
Amanda flying home

262
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:46,002
was a case of
"girl missing boy next door."

263
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,502
But we don't know that.

264
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:49,100
We don't know anything
Amanda's feeling.

265
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:50,402
No one's
letting her explain.

266
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:51,262
Even Mom and Dad.

267
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:53,600
I can't believe they're
siding with Mrs. Bloom.

268
00:12:53,635 --> 00:12:55,901
I can't believe we're
siding with Carol Bloom.

269
00:12:55,938 --> 00:12:58,063
She's uptight,
narrow-minded...

270
00:12:58,105 --> 00:12:59,500
Yeah, and those
are her good qualities.

271
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:03,002
Well, like it or not, we have to
respect what she wants for her daughter.

272
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:05,900
But Kyle has shown nothing but
love and concern for Amanda.

273
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:07,303
And now we have to
keep them apart?

274
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:09,053
The funny thing is,
knowing Kyle,

275
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,540
he'd make the situation
a lot better

276
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:12,003
if he were just
allowed to talk to her.

277
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,000
You remember
being Kyle's age?

278
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:17,703
When something like this
takes over your whole life...

279
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:19,303
That's half the fun
of being in love.

280
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:23,000
Now we have to be the buzz kills,
the grown-ups.

281
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:25,351
Well, if this is what
being a grown-up means...

282
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,243
It sucks. Why can't
Mom and Dad do something?

283
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:29,102
They can't cross the line
with Mrs. Bloom.

284
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:30,303
They're all about
crossing the line

285
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:31,702
when something's not fair.

286
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:34,903
Go throw Mom one of your
"puppy dog in a thunderstorm" looks.

287
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,200
Get her to change her mind.

288
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:37,160
They made it clear.

289
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,200
I have to obey
Mrs. Bloom's request.

290
00:13:41,105 --> 00:13:41,863
This isn't right.

291
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,602
I can't just stand back
and do nothing.

292
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:46,001
Kyle, do I detect defiance?

293
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:48,103
Genius joins the dark side.

294
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:50,501
I've got a list of rules
I've been dying for you to break.

295
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:52,101
I don't want
to break any rules.

296
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:56,200
I won't have to.

297
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:58,701
I'll do exactly what
Mrs. Bloom asked me to do.

298
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,503
Atta boy, Kyle.
Take a stand.

299
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:08,501
Why are your feet
on my bed?

300
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:14,802
<i>There were still ways
to contact Amanda

301
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:16,702
<i>without seeing
or speaking to her.

302
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:23,000
<i>* I miss

303
00:14:24,005 --> 00:14:27,902
<i>* Feeling you there
by my side... *

304
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:29,603
<i>I could easily
circumvent Mrs. Bloom

305
00:14:29,638 --> 00:14:31,402
<i>without leaving
my own house.

306
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:50,503
<i>But it seemed she could find
ways to thwart me just as easily.

307
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:54,803
<i>If electronic messages
weren't getting through,

308
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:57,401
<i>there would be no way for
me to send a note or a letter

309
00:14:57,435 --> 00:14:59,502
<i>without Mrs. Bloom
intercepting it.

310
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:05,002
<i>I couldn't see
or speak to Amanda.

311
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:07,500
<i>The written word
was no longer an option.

312
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,303
<i>But there were still a few
notes I could send her way.

313
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:12,703
<i>I hoped this message
would get through,

314
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:15,400
<i>and she would at least know
I was thinking about her.

315
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:31,203
- I was just trying...
- I know what you were doing.

316
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:35,403
I think you better
come in now.

317
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:00,703
What? You want
my music now, too?

318
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:03,102
You've already confiscated
my phone and my computer.

319
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:05,001
I know this is hard
for you to understand...

320
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:06,401
That you're
keeping me prisoner?

321
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:08,660
You will leave this house

322
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,060
when you agree
to return to New York

323
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:12,700
to become the extraordinary
pianist you're meant to be.

324
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:14,703
Mom, I'm not
seven years old anymore.

325
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,000
You think I don't get that this
is a great opportunity for me?

326
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:19,661
Then why would you
throw it away?

327
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,300
Because it's not
right for me now.

328
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,500
It's not what I want.

329
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:27,401
You don't know
what you want.

330
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:40,200
Dude...

331
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:43,100
the crispity, crunchity goodness
in that bowl is long gone.

332
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:45,501
I'm not really hungry.

333
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,600
My essay sucks.

334
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,002
Speaking of sucks...

335
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:52,200
What?
I meant Shakespeare.

336
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:55,802
Extra credit.
Impressive.

337
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:58,803
Impressive would be figuring out
what language this was written in.

338
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:01,300
I thought Kyle might
be able to translate, but...

339
00:17:06,905 --> 00:17:08,102
Well, what part are you at?

340
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:10,302
The part that says
it's about two families

341
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:12,201
and it's set
in "fair Verona."

342
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:13,860
That's the first two lines.

343
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,901
She lives exactly
38 feet 9 inches away,

344
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:17,901
and I can't even
tell her I'm sorry.

345
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:19,602
You could if she wasn't
locked in her own house.

346
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:21,703
Who else but Mrs. Bloom
actually changes

347
00:17:21,735 --> 00:17:23,401
the alarm code
to keep someone in?

348
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:25,802
I just hope Amanda doesn't feel
as bad as I do.

349
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:29,201
Looks like we have our own resident
pair of star-crossed lovers.

350
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:31,903
The balcony scene's her
favorite part of the play.

351
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:33,762
Of course, it didn't
end well for them.

352
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:37,201
So Romeo and Juliet did everything
in their power to be together.

353
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,700
You guys know how this ends?

354
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:40,103
Why didn't you say so?

355
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:45,603
This all began when Amanda
said we needed to talk.

356
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:48,001
That's exactly what
we're gonna do.

357
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:51,350
I can write my essay later.

358
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:53,302
Whatever it is, I'm in.

359
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:55,860
Wait a minute.

360
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:58,301
I'll do just about
anything but that.

361
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:02,002
If you wanna help, you have
to commit, take this seriously.

362
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:04,703
Then let me drive
the getaway car instead.

363
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:07,503
Or I could create
a diversion or something.

364
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:09,703
Hey, you want in?
Accept the assignment.

365
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:13,203
Then I guess I'll see if I can
borrow one of Andy's.

366
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:16,301
What can I do to help?

367
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:17,902
Help what?

368
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,603
Help Kyle have
a night out with Amanda

369
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:21,000
like you've been
talking about.

370
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:22,601
How do you know what
we've been talking about?

371
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,802
You just sat down.

372
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:26,201
I listened in
while I was sitting

373
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:27,500
at that table over there.

374
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:30,101
I thought you had
the copyright on that move.

375
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:32,202
I can do anything
Kyle can do.

376
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:33,602
Could you make out
with Amanda?

377
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:34,600
'Cause that would be hot.

378
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:39,501
It's a common male fantasy
to watch two women make out.

379
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:41,602
Number six on popular
top-ten lists,

380
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:43,800
but it's not really backed
by statistical evidence.

381
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:45,862
That's all really fascinating
and everything, Kyle,

382
00:18:45,906 --> 00:18:48,802
but I think what she really needs
to learn is the meaning of privacy.

383
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:54,102
Bitchy, not cynical.
A total difference.

384
00:18:54,406 --> 00:18:55,802
I was just trying to help.

385
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,301
Actually I think
there is something you can do.

386
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:15,801
Can I help you?

387
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,401
Hi. Is Amanda home?
I'm a friend.

388
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,601
I've seen you going in
and out of the Trager house.

389
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:23,301
You're Lori's trampy friend.

390
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:25,100
Oh, no, that's Hillary.

391
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:26,761
Well, whoever you are,

392
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:28,902
Amanda is not allowed
to have visitors.

393
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:31,703
Oh, but do tell Kyle,
"Nice try."

394
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:40,661
Hey! Dad!

395
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:43,700
Josh! Guess who was a hit
at the symposium?

396
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:44,963
I knew you'd be.

397
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:46,361
Yeah, I was a little nervous
when I got there,

398
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:49,103
but I look out and I see a room
full of computer science geeks.

399
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:50,602
My peeps.

400
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:52,163
Sounds like...

401
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:54,503
really fulfilling
and fascinating stuff.

402
00:19:55,006 --> 00:19:56,700
Say, uh, why don't
you take a load off,

403
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,403
and I'll put that
projector away for you.

404
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:00,803
Sure. Thanks.

405
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:13,502
That's our block?

406
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:15,002
On a map of the power grid.

407
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,600
There's our house..
and Amanda's.

408
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:19,501
And how does that help?

409
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:22,451
I need to know how
the neighborhood is wired.

410
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:24,502
This has high-voltage
cables, transformers,

411
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:26,401
utility lines,
breaker panels...

412
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:29,003
It's part of the plan.

413
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:31,902
I'm back.

414
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,403
Jessi, please try
to use the...

415
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:37,100
Oh. Front door.
Right.

416
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,203
How'd it go?

417
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,101
12154.

418
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:46,401
So, uh, I'll see you
at the Rack later?

419
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:47,803
Okay. Bye.

420
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:51,903
She was done, right?

421
00:20:53,106 --> 00:20:54,500
I should probably
get going.

422
00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:06,702
Um, didn't you just leave?

423
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:09,363
I wanted to talk to you,
and, um...

424
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:11,902
Kyle said that I should...
use the front door.

425
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:13,300
Okay.

426
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:18,960
Um... your parents

427
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:21,203
didn't press charges,
and they could have.

428
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:24,501
They understand that
what I did to you wasn't me.

429
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:27,201
And I'm really lucky
that they do.

430
00:21:27,805 --> 00:21:29,201
Yeah, you are.

431
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:32,201
Kyle explained
everything to you.

432
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:33,800
I didn't want
to beat you up.

433
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:35,400
It was my programming.

434
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,600
Things... went wrong.

435
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,402
So, what, you caused the most
traumatic experience of my life,

436
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,601
and now you're telling me
that it's not your fault?

437
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:46,800
I'm telling you
I'm sorry.

438
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:49,702
I'm not here to
ruin things anymore.

439
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,503
I'm here to help.

440
00:21:52,907 --> 00:21:54,102
I'm trying.

441
00:21:58,808 --> 00:22:00,103
Then I guess I can try, too.

442
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,302
Okay.

443
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:11,302
Hey. Want some help?

444
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,601
Dig in.

445
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:16,601
Hey, I thought you
got rid of this.

446
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:20,100
I got a little nostalgic and
rescued it from the reject pile.

447
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:23,800
I got a little
nostalgic myself today.

448
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:25,900
Being back on campus again,

449
00:22:26,706 --> 00:22:28,903
no office politics,
no corporate crap,

450
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:30,461
just this flow of ideas.

451
00:22:30,505 --> 00:22:32,000
It was a real
give-and-take.

452
00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:34,700
I forgot how satisfying
that can be.

453
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:37,300
It's been a long time since
you talked about teaching.

454
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:38,061
Yeah, I know.

455
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,800
I was surprised
when the feeling hit me.

456
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:44,000
I was also surprised when the head
of the computer science program

457
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:46,110
mentioned
an adjunct professorship.

458
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,202
Stephen, that's great.
Two job offers.

459
00:22:48,307 --> 00:22:50,600
No, no, no, just the one.
I turned it down.

460
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:51,500
Why?

461
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,700
Well, you wanna get back
in the public sector,

462
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,002
and I already have
a fantastic job.

463
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:57,463
I mean,
it's a great salary.

464
00:22:57,508 --> 00:23:00,653
I'd be the senior VP in
charge of software development.

465
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:03,801
Yeah, at a company that makes
elevator control panels.

466
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:07,001
Well, it's not as exciting
as a career change, I admit,

467
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:09,901
but at least this time around,
I won't have an evil boss.

468
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:46,300
How'd it go?

469
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:48,502
Mission accomplished.

470
00:23:48,536 --> 00:23:49,700
Excellent.

471
00:23:50,105 --> 00:23:51,202
So far.

472
00:23:51,408 --> 00:23:52,952
What you are planning here
is so out there,

473
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:54,501
there is no way
everything will go right.

474
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:55,900
Suzy Cynic.

475
00:23:57,906 --> 00:24:00,101
Kyle, your plan is genius!

476
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:01,860
It's totally optimistic,

477
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,702
at least what
I understand of it.

478
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:04,803
Thank you.

479
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:06,803
So what's next?

480
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:08,303
Well, Jessi got
the alarm code,

481
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,700
and you got her to pull down
the shade, so on to Phase Two.

482
00:24:17,008 --> 00:24:19,101
Here you go.
Phase Two.

483
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:24,500
Now we just
wait for dark.

484
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:27,601
I have unwavering faith and
fully support your exploits,

485
00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:28,713
but how is that a plan?

486
00:24:28,757 --> 00:24:29,802
You got
something better?

487
00:24:29,907 --> 00:24:32,200
It's just that there's
a lot at stake for Kyle's sake,

488
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:33,762
and I don't want
anything to go wrong.

489
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:36,003
Any why would that happen?
Kyle's covered all the angles.

490
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:37,163
I'm sure he has.

491
00:24:37,205 --> 00:24:38,702
Then why don't
you just relax?

492
00:24:38,906 --> 00:24:39,960
Kyle's plan has to work,

493
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:41,200
otherwise he won't
get to Amanda

494
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:42,803
before she's gone for good.

495
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:51,303
I think Phase Two
have been activated.

496
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:00,203
Think about Amanda,
how much you want to see her,

497
00:25:01,505 --> 00:25:02,903
to hold her...

498
00:25:05,606 --> 00:25:06,751
to touch her.

499
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:07,901
Josh, eww.

500
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,000
What? He needs
an emotional trigger.

501
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,800
The other thing
I need is silence.

502
00:25:12,005 --> 00:25:14,000
Good idea.
Lori, out!

503
00:25:14,406 --> 00:25:15,300
What did I do?

504
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,201
This is man's work.

505
00:25:18,406 --> 00:25:20,403
I so wanna make
a joke right now.

506
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:27,600
She could have stayed.

507
00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:29,502
Yeah, but I'm about
to get all mushy,

508
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:30,902
and I didn't
want her to hear it.

509
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,400
Listen, Kyle,

510
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:35,600
I get how messed up
you are right now.

511
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:37,902
If anybody told me I
couldn't see Andy ever again,

512
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:39,700
I'd be a mess, too.

513
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:41,601
But you've got
to pull it together.

514
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,963
You really think
I can do this?

515
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:44,602
Knowing how much
you care about Amanda?

516
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:45,801
Zero doubts.

517
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:46,900
Come on.

518
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:49,602
Deep breaths,
just take it slow,

519
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:51,702
one bulb at a time.

520
00:26:07,408 --> 00:26:08,401
<i>By focusing,

521
00:26:08,806 --> 00:26:11,500
<i>I could control the flow
of electrons along the wire,

522
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,102
<i>much like driving a car
along a narrow road.

523
00:26:25,905 --> 00:26:26,900
<i>In this case,

524
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:29,802
<i>the road led into the Trager
house's electrical system,

525
00:26:29,836 --> 00:26:32,601
<i>which in turn connected to
the neighborhood transformer.

526
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:36,200
<i>Through the transformer, I was
able to reach Amanda's house

527
00:26:36,237 --> 00:26:38,901
<i>and gain access to
the house's electrical system.

528
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:42,802
<i>Once inside, I could direct
the flow of electrons

529
00:26:42,837 --> 00:26:44,703
<i>through the wires
hidden in the walls.

530
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:49,702
<i>I was able to find
my way to Amanda's room.

531
00:26:52,106 --> 00:26:54,500
<i>Finally, I got
my message through.

532
00:26:55,305 --> 00:26:58,003
<i>And finally, we would
have our chance to talk.

533
00:26:58,037 --> 00:26:59,303
Phase Three.

534
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:31,302
MEET ME AT THE RACK
ALARM CODE 12154

535
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:51,203
You owe me... big.

536
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,600
Trager, you really embraced
your inner Hallmark card.

537
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:58,000
You've gone soft.

538
00:27:58,308 --> 00:28:00,503
I know. You can cut
the irony with a spoon.

539
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,402
I just hope it's worth it.

540
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:06,703
What's that
supposed to mean?

541
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:08,500
Nothing.

542
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:13,601
All this for puppy love?

543
00:28:13,807 --> 00:28:15,400
I mean, seriously, what
are the odds that the person

544
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:17,003
you're gonna spend
the rest of your life with

545
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:18,800
is literally
the girl next door?

546
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,001
I mean, I don't want to put a
bad mojo on the whole love vibe,

547
00:28:22,206 --> 00:28:23,861
but I don't want
to set Kyle up

548
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:26,301
to get his heart chopped,
sliced, and diced.

549
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,901
God, that felt good.

550
00:28:31,705 --> 00:28:33,301
Did you see where
I put the napkins?

551
00:28:35,707 --> 00:28:37,202
Is there a garlic
convention in here?

552
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:39,002
- Too much?
- Never.

553
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:41,201
What's the occasion?

554
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:43,060
Take your pick.

555
00:28:43,105 --> 00:28:45,400
I feel guilty about
discouraging Kyle.

556
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:47,450
I appreciate
the life we have

557
00:28:47,486 --> 00:28:48,901
and that we have
such good kids.

558
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:51,801
Um... I'm incredibly hungry.

559
00:28:52,805 --> 00:28:54,202
How about
all of the above?

560
00:28:56,308 --> 00:28:57,502
- Stephen.
- Hmm?

561
00:28:57,805 --> 00:29:00,003
You mentioned Amanda would
be missing an opportunity.

562
00:29:00,036 --> 00:29:01,202
You ever feel that way?

563
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:03,202
What makes you think
I feel that way?

564
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:04,962
Spring cleaning.

565
00:29:05,005 --> 00:29:07,603
Dragging the past out of the
closets, seeing who we've become.

566
00:29:07,907 --> 00:29:09,203
You still look great
in a bikini.

567
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:10,662
I wouldn't know.

568
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,801
I haven't worn one
since Josh was born.

569
00:29:13,305 --> 00:29:15,201
Remember how I was
supposed to be the cool mom

570
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:17,101
who published
thought-provoking articles

571
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:18,101
and had a career?

572
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:19,502
All I've accomplished
this weekend

573
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:20,961
is five loads of laundry.

574
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:24,200
Not to mention an insanely
aromatic marinara sauce.

575
00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:28,861
Yes, there was a time
when I wanted to teach,

576
00:29:28,908 --> 00:29:31,601
but I don't feel like
I'm really missing anything,

577
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:32,961
'cause I never
went down that path.

578
00:29:33,008 --> 00:29:35,402
But you had to go the corporate
route to support our family.

579
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,400
Which I wouldn't trade
for anything in the world.

580
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:41,203
Why don't you go
gather the troops.

581
00:29:41,305 --> 00:29:42,901
All right.
I'm on it.

582
00:29:47,507 --> 00:29:49,001
Hey.
Is she coming?

583
00:29:49,305 --> 00:29:51,003
I hope so.
She got my message.

584
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:52,762
I know now is not
the best time to ask,

585
00:29:52,805 --> 00:29:54,300
but can we add that
electrical trick to the list?

586
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:55,601
I really want
to learn that, too.

587
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:57,300
After Amanda goes back
to New York,

588
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,400
when you have more time.

589
00:29:58,506 --> 00:29:59,903
I promise
I'll make time.

590
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,403
But I have to make time
for Amanda, too.

591
00:30:01,437 --> 00:30:02,603
She might be staying.

592
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:04,001
Oh, she's staying?

593
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:06,001
She doesn't want to go back.

594
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,100
You're surprised.

595
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,202
No, it's...
it's good news for you.

596
00:30:13,008 --> 00:30:13,760
Do you know why?

597
00:30:13,806 --> 00:30:16,500
Not yet, but now I have
a chance to find out.

598
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:21,101
Thank you...
for your help.

599
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:37,502
Your dinner
is getting cold.

600
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:42,200
I know you're not very
happy with me right now,

601
00:30:42,236 --> 00:30:44,903
but I am only looking out
for your best interests.

602
00:30:49,706 --> 00:30:52,202
I made that noodle casserole
you like so much.

603
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:55,602
Oh, Amanda.

604
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:08,501
<i>Hey, hon?

605
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:12,901
Where the hell are they?

606
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:15,600
This could be the biggest
move you bust all night,

607
00:31:15,637 --> 00:31:17,202
so we just wanna make sure
you have it down.

608
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:19,002
Meet her at the door.

609
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:24,400
Compliment her.
Walk her over to the table.

610
00:31:28,308 --> 00:31:29,302
Offer her a seat.

611
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:30,903
Yes. Care to demonstrate?

612
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:33,802
Would you like a seat?

613
00:31:34,707 --> 00:31:35,700
No. No, no.

614
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:37,501
You have to pull
the chair out for her.

615
00:31:38,706 --> 00:31:39,703
Oh.

616
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:43,401
And then just slip it
underneath her as she sits.

617
00:31:43,707 --> 00:31:45,500
Not too fast or
you'll take her out at the knees.

618
00:31:46,306 --> 00:31:48,603
Right.
Not too fast.

619
00:31:51,106 --> 00:31:53,802
Why am I even worried?
You'll be fine.

620
00:31:56,808 --> 00:31:57,903
Does it look okay?

621
00:32:05,308 --> 00:32:06,302
Perfect.

622
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:20,602
I love this.

623
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,801
The lights,
the table, everything.

624
00:32:24,805 --> 00:32:25,661
And the window in my room.

625
00:32:25,705 --> 00:32:27,400
How'd you even
get the idea for that?

626
00:32:28,408 --> 00:32:30,000
<i>Romeo and Juliet.

627
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:31,602
Act 2, scene 2, line 2.

628
00:32:31,706 --> 00:32:32,961
The balcony scene.
That's...

629
00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:34,503
Your favorite scene
in the play.

630
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:36,361
I like that
you pay attention

631
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:37,800
to weird little
details like that.

632
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:40,202
You do?

633
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:43,901
You're blushing.

634
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:45,700
I am?

635
00:32:47,705 --> 00:32:48,901
I shouldn't have said that.

636
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:50,101
I totally embarrassed you.

637
00:32:50,206 --> 00:32:52,200
No. Amanda...

638
00:32:52,505 --> 00:32:54,600
you can always say
whatever you want with me.

639
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:01,852
Glazed Cornish game hens

640
00:33:01,888 --> 00:33:03,762
on a bed of sautéed greens,

641
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:06,602
sweet-potato soufflé
and asparagus,

642
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:09,203
with shaved Romano
and pancetta.

643
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,601
I don't think this
is what we ordered.

644
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:16,300
Right. 'Cause nothing
says romance

645
00:33:16,337 --> 00:33:17,700
like a smoked turkey wrap.

646
00:33:18,106 --> 00:33:20,003
I took some liberties
with the menu.

647
00:33:20,506 --> 00:33:21,263
You made this?

648
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:23,601
No one knows I'm secretly
a fan of Top Chef.

649
00:33:24,406 --> 00:33:26,002
And no one ever will.

650
00:33:26,307 --> 00:33:27,703
<i>Bon appétit.

651
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:33,702
Stop staring.

652
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:37,001
I can't. I'm O.D'ing
on suspense.

653
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:38,602
I wonder how it's going.

654
00:33:38,907 --> 00:33:40,501
You wanna know
if it's going badly.

655
00:33:41,805 --> 00:33:42,862
What you witnessed earlier

656
00:33:42,908 --> 00:33:45,403
was a completely
uncharacteristic outburst.

657
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,103
No, it's how you really feel.

658
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:49,861
It was just a mini meltdown

659
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:51,903
brought on by some
stupid homework assignment.

660
00:33:51,935 --> 00:33:53,602
The "Who You Really Are" essay?

661
00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:55,103
No one ever
takes that seriously.

662
00:33:56,607 --> 00:33:58,300
Well, almost no one.

663
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:01,902
It was recently
brought to my attention

664
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,702
that I am always the girl
with the wry commentary

665
00:34:04,737 --> 00:34:06,403
and the patented eye roll.

666
00:34:07,808 --> 00:34:08,900
Honest question.

667
00:34:09,707 --> 00:34:11,403
Do you think I'm a cynic?

668
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:13,102
Honest answer?
Absolutely.

669
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:16,402
You're Miss Possible
But Not Likely.

670
00:34:16,506 --> 00:34:18,703
About my own life?
Of course.

671
00:34:19,705 --> 00:34:21,002
But watching those two,

672
00:34:21,408 --> 00:34:23,000
who am I to say they're
not meant for each other?

673
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:24,301
I mean, look at them.

674
00:34:24,406 --> 00:34:25,462
Have you ever seen
two people

675
00:34:25,505 --> 00:34:27,202
look at each other
like Kyle and Amanda?

676
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:31,500
Not in a while.

677
00:34:46,705 --> 00:34:49,101
<i>Amanda, you said
we need to talk.

678
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:50,100
Right.

679
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:56,003
You didn't think I meant...

680
00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:57,002
Maybe a little.

681
00:34:58,108 --> 00:34:59,463
After a few people
weighed in.

682
00:34:59,505 --> 00:35:01,900
The one time you didn't
take my words literally.

683
00:35:03,508 --> 00:35:05,503
Did you really think
my feelings had changed?

684
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:07,002
Is that why you
brought me here?

685
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:08,662
I brought you here
'cause everyone else

686
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,003
was making assumptions
about what you wanted,

687
00:35:11,107 --> 00:35:13,401
and how you were feeling
and what was right for you.

688
00:35:13,805 --> 00:35:15,703
But no one was
actually asking you.

689
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:20,702
That's why my feelings
for you could never change.

690
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:40,202
Didn't know the lights
out here twinkled.

691
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:42,101
Only for you.

692
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:49,202
You have no idea how
disappointed I am right now!

693
00:35:49,236 --> 00:35:51,160
- Mom...
- Save your excuses!

694
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:52,902
Your flight leaves
in less than two hours.

695
00:35:52,938 --> 00:35:54,363
- My flight...
- You heard me.

696
00:35:54,407 --> 00:35:55,803
But you haven't heard her.

697
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:58,002
You have nothing
to say in the matter!

698
00:35:58,036 --> 00:35:59,000
But I do!

699
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:02,000
Don't you even care
I'm not happy at the conservatory.

700
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,162
Of course I care!

701
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:05,902
But I also care about
scholarships, opportunities.

702
00:36:06,005 --> 00:36:07,460
I care about your future.

703
00:36:07,506 --> 00:36:08,962
If you really cared
about my future,

704
00:36:09,005 --> 00:36:11,803
you would not have sold
my piano in the first place!

705
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:19,403
Mom, I'm sorry.
I didn't...

706
00:36:19,435 --> 00:36:21,400
Get in the car, now.

707
00:36:26,606 --> 00:36:27,801
I have to go.

708
00:36:28,608 --> 00:36:29,901
I understand.

709
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:36,603
I hope you're satisfied.

710
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:50,000
It took all my will power
not to trip her.

711
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:53,501
Thank you for letting
me know Amanda was here.

712
00:36:53,608 --> 00:36:54,903
Glad I could help.

713
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:04,401
<i>Welcome home.

714
00:37:05,107 --> 00:37:06,063
I'd ask you what
you were thinking,

715
00:37:06,105 --> 00:37:08,102
but I don't think
you were thinking at all.

716
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:10,501
Actually, this took
a great deal of planning.

717
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:11,361
Not helping.

718
00:37:11,408 --> 00:37:13,500
The Blooms' situation
was private.

719
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:15,800
We made it very clear
you were not to see Amanda.

720
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:17,501
<i>You were not
to get involved.

721
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:18,901
I know I broke a rule,

722
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:21,002
but I'm not sorry I did.

723
00:37:21,107 --> 00:37:22,700
I had to do it,
for Amanda.

724
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:24,602
Good intentions aside,
you're still grounded.

725
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:26,601
All of you.
Two weeks.

726
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:28,111
- What?
- School, work, home.

727
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:29,621
Everything else is off-limits.

728
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,100
And I'll take
your cell phones.

729
00:37:32,705 --> 00:37:33,563
This was my idea.

730
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:35,103
Lori and Josh
shouldn't be punished.

731
00:37:35,306 --> 00:37:36,202
They were just helping.

732
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:37,301
Exactly.

733
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:41,362
What if Foss...

734
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:43,502
If anyone important calls,
I'll have it with me.

735
00:37:44,108 --> 00:37:45,400
Do I get one last call?

736
00:37:45,606 --> 00:37:46,301
No.

737
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,700
But you do get to go
to your rooms.

738
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:51,903
Now.

739
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:03,901
Grounding Kyle.
Who would have expected it?

740
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:05,202
And he was the ringleader.

741
00:38:06,005 --> 00:38:07,102
When did that start happening?

742
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:12,703
Be honest.

743
00:38:13,705 --> 00:38:15,302
You're kinda glad
they did it, aren't you?

744
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:16,903
Well?
Aren't you?

745
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:18,801
Some rules are meant
to be broken.

746
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,100
About that.

747
00:38:21,808 --> 00:38:23,902
I think we should
break some rules, too.

748
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:27,003
Stephen, I don't want us
to sail into

749
00:38:27,035 --> 00:38:28,763
a complacent,
suburban existence

750
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:30,502
without fighting
the good fight.

751
00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:33,401
I want you to pursue
that opport U.W.

752
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:35,763
Nicole, that's not an option.

753
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:37,403
Well, then we need
to make it one.

754
00:38:38,006 --> 00:38:41,303
You can't get the chance to pursue
an old dream and just pass on it.

755
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:43,550
We have mouths to feed.

756
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:44,802
We'll keep them fed.

757
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:48,401
We'll make it work.

758
00:38:48,435 --> 00:38:49,700
We always do.

759
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:09,663
<i>Spring cleaning
isn't just about

760
00:39:09,707 --> 00:39:12,101
<i>sorting through things
and getting rid of clutter.

761
00:39:12,206 --> 00:39:14,502
<i>It's about taking stock
of who you are

762
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:16,203
<i>and how others see you.

763
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:27,102
<i>It's a chance
to redefine yourself,

764
00:39:29,806 --> 00:39:31,603
<i>to change expectations.

765
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,400
<i>And to remember
that it's never too late

766
00:39:43,436 --> 00:39:45,300
<i>to recapture who you were.

767
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:55,400
<i>Or to aim for
who you want to be.

768
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:10,302
Take a seat.

769
00:40:14,608 --> 00:40:15,903
Where have you been?

770
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:19,900
I was just out
looking at the stars.

771
00:40:20,606 --> 00:40:23,203
You were stargazing...
every night this week.

772
00:40:26,705 --> 00:40:28,201
How about the truth now.

773
00:40:31,105 --> 00:40:32,500
I've been sneaking out.

774
00:40:32,535 --> 00:40:34,103
Obviously.

775
00:40:35,006 --> 00:40:35,900
Why?

776
00:40:37,007 --> 00:40:38,203
To try things.

777
00:40:38,808 --> 00:40:39,803
Such as?

778
00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:41,502
Um...

779
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:45,500
I've been testing myself.

780
00:40:47,107 --> 00:40:49,202
Getting stronger and faster.

781
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:51,900
I know I shouldn't
let people see me,

782
00:40:51,935 --> 00:40:53,602
and that's why
I do it at night.

783
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:56,102
I... I don't know
what to say.

784
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:59,161
I expected that
it would take you longer

785
00:40:59,205 --> 00:41:02,202
to get comfortable living
here before we were ready.

786
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:04,600
We?

787
00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:06,800
I have big plans
for you, Jessi.

788
00:41:08,108 --> 00:41:11,802
And I need you to be as strong and
as smart as you can possibly be.

789
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:16,701
How do we start?

790
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,901
Well, first thing's first.

791
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:21,803
You need to get
some sleep.

792
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:23,902
We'll talk about it
further in the morning.

793
00:41:24,506 --> 00:41:25,603
Okay.

794
00:42:29,305 --> 00:42:30,500
LISTEN

795
00:42:33,107 --> 00:42:34,902
WHO IS THIS

796
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:56,701
Amanda.

797
00:42:56,905 --> 00:42:58,303
What happened? Did your
mother change her mind?

798
00:42:58,336 --> 00:43:00,701
No. I didn't
get on the plane.

799
00:43:03,008 --> 00:43:04,202
Can you hide me?

800
00:43:09,405 --> 00:43:10,500
Come in.
