00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,608
<i>Previously on</i> Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,513 --> 00:00:03,819
Adam wanted me to give you this.

3
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:05,592
It's a ring.

4
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:07,040
That's a beautiful stone.

5
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:09,116
I'll be back for that.

6
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:11,034
It's not in there, kid.

7
00:00:11,587 --> 00:00:12,452
Your ring?

8
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:14,121
- I sold it.
- Who bought it?

9
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:16,404
Welcome to Madacorp.

10
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:20,975
I think I made a mistake
bringing Jessi to you.

11
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:23,482
I think it's vital
that she continue coming.

12
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:25,557
In fact, if Jessi misses
even one appointment,

13
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:27,853
I won't hesitate
to call Social Services.

14
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:30,340
'Cause I like you. Don't you like me?

15
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:32,389
Well, yeah.

16
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:34,320
Let's count to 3

17
00:00:34,753 --> 00:00:36,976
and both say what's on
our minds at the same time.

18
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:38,694
- I like you.
- I have cancer.

19
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:39,771
What?

20
00:00:45,507 --> 00:00:46,945
<i>Zzyzx. That's the way in.</i>

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,065
<i>When we were down there...</i>

22
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:52,611
<i>I saw things.</i>

23
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:56,205
<i>This was Baylin's. Can't get it open.</i>

24
00:01:19,863 --> 00:01:21,361
<i>Locks can play secrets.</i>

25
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:23,523
<i>The stronger the lock,</i>

26
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:24,990
<i>the bigger the secret.</i>

27
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:27,611
<i>Adam Baylin's secrets are locked</i>

28
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:28,949
<i>inside this box.</i>

29
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:32,348
<i>The secrets of Zzyzx are
locked inside my head.</i>

30
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:36,787
<i>But what could be so important to</i>

31
00:01:36,907 --> 00:01:39,482
<i>make me lock them away
and keep them a secret from myself?</i>

32
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:44,824
<i>I guess sometimes the only
thing more elusive than secrets</i>

33
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:46,957
<i>is the key to unlocking them.</i>

34
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:49,903
<i>In this case,</i>

35
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,400
<i>the key was the ring that Adam gave me:</i>

36
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,296
<i>the ring I no longer had.</i>

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,695
I just don't understand

38
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:02,602
what's so important
that's locked inside Kyle's head.

39
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:05,187
Everything that Zzyzx
was able to feed him...

40
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,136
that is, before you could
fit their remains in an ashtray.

41
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:12,406
How did your trip
with Stephen Trager go?

42
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:15,037
It went well.

43
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:18,958
He opened up about his dead father.
I'd say we bonded.

44
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:22,170
And how are things
with Nicole since your...

45
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:23,968
altercation?

46
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:26,348
We'll find out.

47
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,430
She has another session
with Jessi in a couple of days.

48
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:32,609
We need to speed things up.

49
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:45,455
Drop the spoon and back away
from the stove,

50
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:46,619
nice and easy.

51
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,824
Come on, I'm starving. It's your fault
this stuff smells so good.

52
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:52,204
I think there was
a compliment in there somewhere.

53
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,073
Pasta, most delicious of all

54
00:02:55,193 --> 00:02:56,778
carb delivery systems.

55
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:58,726
Yeah, it's an old family recipe.

56
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:02,064
- How old?
- Oh, about 53 minutes.

57
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:06,332
Oh, I need you to set an extra place
at the table. Amanda is joing us.

58
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:07,917
Did Kyle invite her?

59
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:09,663
Yes, and he's very excited

60
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:12,209
and whatever the Kyle version
of nervous is.

61
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:14,290
Great. Kyle has a date.

62
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,729
Bye-bye, leftovers.

63
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:17,137
Josh, this is important to him.

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,161
Hey, Josh, why don't you
invite Andy over for dinner?

65
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:25,945
What, no smart-ass reply?
What's next, locusts?

66
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:28,391
Hey, guys.

67
00:03:29,394 --> 00:03:32,330
We have a guest for dinner.
This is my boss, Julian Ballantine.

68
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:34,112
Sorry to spring this on you.

69
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:36,490
Didn't get a chance to call.

70
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:38,408
Don't be silly. It's so nice to

71
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:39,976
finally meet you, Mr. Ballantine.

72
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:41,829
Bye-bye, seconds.

73
00:03:41,964 --> 00:03:43,194
This is Josh

74
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,915
and Lori.

75
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:47,526
Good to meet you,
and please call me Julian.

76
00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:52,047
I brought... red and white.

77
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:54,712
- Didn't know what you'd be serving.
- I like red.

78
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:56,927
I mean...

79
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:59,104
I mean, I will when I'm 21.

80
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:03,475
I heard the door. Is Amanda...

81
00:04:04,198 --> 00:04:06,056
Oh, you must be Kyle.

82
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:08,415
I heard so much about you from Stephen.

83
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,346
We work together at Madacorp.

84
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,146
Excuse me.

85
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,646
You have to forgive Kyle.
Tonight's kind of a date.

86
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:32,754
You look beautiful.

87
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:35,142
I didn't know what to wear.

88
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:38,385
I wasn't sure how fancy
it would be or not, so I...

89
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:41,162
You wear what you were
wearing the first time I saw you,

90
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:43,079
when you were playing the piano.

91
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:45,875
I had no idea I...

92
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,098
Wait, how could you even remember that?

93
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:50,695
How could I forget it?

94
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:54,623
Well, I almost forgot.

95
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,820
There's this concert at Seattle Phil.

96
00:04:57,748 --> 00:04:59,406
They're playing Pachelbel's works and...

97
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:00,532
I'd love to.

98
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:03,630
Go with you, I mean.

99
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:08,874
<i>Yes. That's good, that's good.
Oh, please.</i>

100
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,046
I almost brought champagne,

101
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:17,466
but I figured I'd save it
till after the test this week.

102
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:20,129
- What test?
- It's a systems integration test.

103
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:23,755
We bring all the software and hardware
online together at the same time.

104
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:25,369
We synch it all up to the mainframe

105
00:05:25,544 --> 00:05:27,731
and evaluate
the biometric signature compatibility.

106
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:30,394
So you're turning neural
impulses into computer data.

107
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:34,107
Sounds you understand
this stuff better than I do.

108
00:05:34,498 --> 00:05:36,776
You know, maybe I should
have served dinner with a manual.

109
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:41,580
I don't know what I did
before we had Stephen around,

110
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,949
after this week, I promise

111
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:45,702
I won't keep him away from you
any more than absolutely necessary.

112
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,744
I figured Emily can
handle the next trip solo.

113
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,373
Emily went with you last weekend?

114
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:54,461
Yeah. She's part of the project.

115
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:59,174
I'd like to propose a toast, if I may.

116
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:00,461
To Stephen

117
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,360
and your wonderful family,

118
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:05,854
whom I hope I get to know
much better in the future.

119
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,713
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

123
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,656
Baylin's ring?

124
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:40,585
Yeah. I saw it right there
on Ballantine's finger.

125
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:42,780
What do you think?

126
00:06:44,632 --> 00:06:47,188
The man who just
happens to be Stephen's boss

127
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:49,843
also just happens
to be in possession of a ring...

128
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,476
Baylin's ring... that you pawned.

129
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:53,229
A ring that

130
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:54,583
just so happens to be

131
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:56,928
the only way
of opening Baylin's box that you

132
00:06:57,238 --> 00:06:59,764
happened to dig up out
of that underground death trap.

133
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,350
What do I think? I think there's
no such thing as coincidence.

134
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:06,032
I need to talk to Foss about this.

135
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:08,348
Baylin told you not to trust him.

136
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:10,411
Baylin told me not to trust Taylor.

137
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:12,304
I think Taylor switched the message.

138
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:13,730
Whatever.

139
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:16,335
You can't just sit back
and wait for Foss' blessing.

140
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,872
Amanda, it's Kyle.

141
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:23,690
He's gonna be thrilled
no matter what you wear.

142
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,181
Trust me, if I wear something lame,
he'll remember it.

143
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:29,795
What's the matter?

144
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,521
I got a letter from
this conservatory in New York.

145
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:37,439
I applied there a long
time ago to study piano.

146
00:07:38,981 --> 00:07:40,066
And I kind of got in.

147
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:41,827
That's awesome.

148
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:44,355
I'd kill to get to go to New York.

149
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:46,343
I'm totally excited. It's just...

150
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,742
It's for a whole semester,

151
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,702
- and...
- The long-distance thing.

152
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:54,910
- It explains your attention to detail.
- Yeah.

153
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:57,626
Am I crazy to think it could work?

154
00:07:57,855 --> 00:07:58,872
I mean,

155
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:00,587
it's three time zones away.

156
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,592
With any other guy, I'd say don't waste
your anytime minutes, but

157
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:07,270
it's Kyle.

158
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:10,096
He spent the last year pining
over you from a distance.

159
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:12,557
I'm sure one semester
won't even make a dent.

160
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:19,132
Dig in.

161
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:21,721
Don't worry. There's, like,
zero nutritional value in there.

162
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:22,851
No, thanks.

163
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:26,076
I can go back and get a turkey club,
if you'd rather have that.

164
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,906
Josh, my stomach's kind of on edge.

165
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:29,763
I have a test tomorrow.

166
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:33,264
Well, fear not.

167
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:35,836
I got a laser printer that
can print, like, nanoscopic

168
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:37,536
so I can make you the primo cheat sheet.

169
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:39,417
It's not that kind of test, Josh.

170
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:43,226
You mean...

171
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:45,718
It's how the doctors are
planning more chemo.

172
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:47,396
Right.

173
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:51,602
You should get some popsicles, then.

174
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:54,472
No, I was reading online that
chemo makes you really dehydrated,

175
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:56,559
- and one thing that helps is popsicles.
- Josh...

176
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:58,509
No, seriously. What flavors do you like?

177
00:08:59,116 --> 00:08:59,938
just in case

178
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:02,424
- the cancer's back.
- Please don't use the C word.

179
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,191
The other C word.

180
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,022
Remember when I said

181
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,371
you couldn't talk to anyone about this?

182
00:09:18,076 --> 00:09:19,609
Well, that includes me.

183
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,765
Homework?

184
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,092
Oh, God, it feels like it.

185
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:36,015
I've that systems
integration test coming up.

186
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:37,393
Right.

187
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,811
Well, Ballantine sounded
very impressed with you.

188
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:44,710
So, um...

189
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:47,944
hey, you never really told
me about your business trip.

190
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:51,489
You know, San Francisco.

191
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:53,622
Oh. Well, it was... it was good.

192
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:56,242
It was work, but it was good.

193
00:09:57,174 --> 00:09:59,489
And after everything that
happened with my dad, it...

194
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:01,811
it was just nice to get away.

195
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:05,020
Lori, could you get that?

196
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:08,131
Well, I'm glad you got a break.

197
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:11,377
Yeah. And... as it turns out,

198
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:13,691
Emily's got a few
issues with her father, too.

199
00:10:14,642 --> 00:10:16,014
She really understood.

200
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:20,212
Well, I'm glad you had
someone to talk to.

201
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:23,354
Phone for you.

202
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:25,221
Oh. Thanks, hon.

203
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:27,200
Hello.

204
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:32,206
What's up?

205
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:34,826
Really?

206
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:36,611
Well, that's good news.

207
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,229
But, hey, that's why we get
paid the mid-range bucks.

208
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:48,898
Absolutely.

209
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:50,632
Ah, no problem.

210
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:52,854
All right, you, too.

211
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,217
Crap.

212
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,068
You scared me.

213
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:02,685
Who was that?

214
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,490
Just someone from work.

215
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:08,801
Listen, I'm gonna go
take a shower, okay?

216
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:27,896
Thanks for letting me
come to work with you.

217
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:31,469
Just... promise me you won't
disassemble the mainframe.

218
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,955
<i>I didn't like misleading Stephen,</i>

219
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,379
<i>but Declan was right.</i>

220
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:37,155
<i>I couldn't sit back and do nothing.</i>

221
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:40,236
<i>I had to face Ballantine
on his own ground,</i>

222
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,508
<i>to try to figure out
what we were up against.</i>

223
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:46,148
You've no idea how delighted I was

224
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:47,727
to hear you were coming with Stephen.

225
00:12:47,874 --> 00:12:49,023
What brings you here today?

226
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:50,482
Research for a project.

227
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,962
Must be very important
if they let you out of school.

228
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:54,436
There's a lot riding on it.

229
00:12:54,562 --> 00:12:56,114
Well, I hope I can lend a hand.

230
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,850
I appreciate that.

231
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:59,264
Right this way.

232
00:13:13,513 --> 00:13:15,652
<i>Thank you, Mr. Ballantine.</i>

233
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:20,639
I don't know if Stephen
has told you much about

234
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,751
what he's been doing here,
but he's working on the CIR,

235
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:26,092
short for Cerebral Impulse Relay.

236
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,280
It's a lot like an advanced MRI machine.

237
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:32,533
You know, I must admit
I'm not a science person.

238
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:34,863
I'm more of a big picture kind of a guy.

239
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:37,155
Well, what's the big picture of?

240
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,510
Well, our hope is to help patients

241
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:43,262
suffering from things
like Alzheimer's disease,

242
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:46,202
stroke, and dementia
recover from memory loss.

243
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:49,556
Give them back that part of their lives
before they've really lost it.

244
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:54,759
<i>Ballantine's goal seemed
like a noble one,</i>

245
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:59,153
<i>but I couldn't help thinking he was
only telling me part of the truth.</i>

246
00:14:08,866 --> 00:14:09,706
Since an MRI

247
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:11,499
is basically a giant magnet,

248
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:14,293
no one's allowed to bring
metal into the lab.

249
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:41,910
Your password, sir.

250
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,672
Shall we?

251
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:09,557
Kyle, I'd like to introduce you
to the Cerebral Impulse Relay,

252
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:11,177
or CIR.

253
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,670
But we like to call it "Sir. "

254
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:15,551
Have a seat.

255
00:15:16,771 --> 00:15:18,357
Not to worry. She's not even online yet.

256
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:20,931
We're still working out
some of the kinks.

257
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:23,699
But after the system's integration test,

258
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:25,293
she'll be up and running.

259
00:15:28,972 --> 00:15:30,453
Maybe some other time.

260
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,997
Count on it.

261
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:47,464
That ring came from Baylin.

262
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,919
He made a point of leaving it to you.
Why would you

263
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,994
pawn it in the first place?

264
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,395
I tried to buy it back.

265
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:55,893
And this Ballantine beat you to it.
You know, this...

266
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:59,325
this ring... this ring is important.

267
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:01,054
More than you know. It...

268
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:02,972
What do you mean?

269
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:05,657
Look, you just should have
told me sooner, that's all.

270
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:09,237
I would have if
I'd known where you were.

271
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:11,596
You know what? What's done is done.

272
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,542
So what did you find out
about Ballantine?

273
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,697
That he must be hiding something,

274
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:22,797
there's enough security
at Madacorp to hide

275
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,485
whatever it is he's hiding.

276
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:25,851
Well,

277
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:28,469
after Taylor, that's one
more person you can't trust.

278
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:32,515
What is...

279
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:33,891
What is he doing here?

280
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:36,187
- What are you doing here?
- He wants to help us.

281
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,980
Like you said, Foss, Kyle's running out
of people he can trust.

282
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:42,817
Help us do what?

283
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:44,539
Get answers.

284
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:50,999
Ballantine invadedy home,
my family, and my privacy.

285
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,745
I don't know what he's doing
with my ring and wants

286
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:57,373
- with me or the Tragers.
- So what do you want to do?

287
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:00,156
I want to get my ring back.

288
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,050
I'm glad you came.

289
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:10,870
Well, it's important for Jessi.

290
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:12,524
Come on in.

291
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,601
Thanks, Nicole.

292
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:18,900
See you in an hour.

293
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,417
Right.

294
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:22,273
I...

295
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:24,609
I like your glasses.

296
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:26,594
Oh, yeah?

297
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:28,029
I lost my contacts.

298
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:31,282
You should lose them
more often. You look great.

299
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:33,784
Thanks. Bye.

300
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:39,779
Come on.

301
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:54,809
The cameras we have to worry about
are here, here, and here.

302
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:57,948
We can disable those,
assuming they're on the same circuit.

303
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:00,692
Then there are motion detectors,
double-redundant I.D. interfaces,

304
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,168
and retina scanners.

305
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,355
What's the matter?

306
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:07,008
I just

307
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:08,614
wonder where he comes in.

308
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:09,975
Worry about yourself, Foss.

309
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:13,030
Wrong. I have to worry about you
because you could get me killed.

310
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:14,798
We all have to work together on this.

311
00:18:15,517 --> 00:18:18,162
We have one shot, one opportunity.

312
00:18:19,152 --> 00:18:20,706
The system's integration test is

313
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:23,209
the only time we know
where and when Ballantine will be,

314
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:24,877
and he'll have to take his ring off.

315
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,171
That's our window.

316
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,057
It's tomorrow or nothing.

317
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:37,679
I don't know.
I'm just seeing weird things.

318
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:39,225
Weird how?

319
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:44,355
I have this memory of being in a fire.

320
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:48,192
I asked my sister about it,
and she said there wasn't any fire.

321
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:53,948
Sometimes it helps to draw the images.

322
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,675
It may help to clarify some things.

323
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:01,158
Want to give it a try?

324
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:10,780
Don't worry how it looks. Just...

325
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,138
draw what you feel.

326
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,405
Did someone teach you to draw that way?

327
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:37,325
No. Am I doing it wrong?

328
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:38,802
No, no.

329
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:42,413
You... Go on. You're doing fine.

330
00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:55,908
And you're sure this will
fool Madacorp's retina scan?

331
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,723
As long as Kyle can upload it
into the security system.

332
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,715
The image is clean.

333
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:13,058
Amanda, you got my message.

334
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:14,582
Yeah. I got the tickets.

335
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:16,103
Totally scored the orchestra seats.

336
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:20,608
Are you all right?

337
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,410
Yes.

338
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,659
I'm sorry, but something came up.

339
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:26,630
What?

340
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,965
<i>Something important.</i>

341
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:31,666
It happens.

342
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:35,080
I promise I'll make it up to you.

343
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,973
Don't worry about it.

344
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:38,907
It's no big deal.

345
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:43,358
I'd better go.

346
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:57,067
You got a minute?

347
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,350
Sure.

348
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:01,152
I need to talk to you,

349
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:02,983
strictly confidential.

350
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:05,035
Okay.

351
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:08,030
So you're not my mom,
you're my therapist.

352
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:27,101
Andy has cancer.

353
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:30,385
Oh, no.

354
00:21:33,578 --> 00:21:35,557
Oh, Josh, I'm so sorry.

355
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:39,599
I finally meet a girl that I like...

356
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:41,882
I mean, she's awesome.

357
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:44,065
She likes to play G-Force.

358
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:45,623
She loves zombie movies...

359
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,528
the unrated ones
you think I don't watch.

360
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
And...

361
00:21:51,948 --> 00:21:53,370
I want to help her through this,

362
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,461
but she won't let me
talk to her about it.

363
00:21:56,603 --> 00:21:58,955
What would you say to her if you could?

364
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,039
I don't know.

365
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:04,242
Something to make her feel better.

366
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,864
You may not have to say
anything to do that.

367
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:13,336
Andy might just need you
to hang in there with her,

368
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,827
and if the time comes

369
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:18,549
when she wants to talk,

370
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:20,762
you'll be ready.

371
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:19,961
Paige.

372
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:29,823
Hello.

373
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:30,953
<i>It's Kyle.</i>

374
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:32,609
Hi. Is everything okay?

375
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:35,670
<i>Well, when I was in your office,
I think I left my binder.</i>

376
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:38,193
Okay, well, I can bring it home with me.

377
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:39,317
<i>I can pick it up.</i>

378
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:42,821
It's kind of important,
I'm not that far away.

379
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,859
Well, I'm heading to
the systems integration test,

380
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:47,956
but I can have security let you in.

381
00:24:48,735 --> 00:24:49,735
Thanks.

382
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:52,803
No turning back now.

383
00:24:53,114 --> 00:24:54,295
You sure you wanna do this?

384
00:24:54,736 --> 00:24:56,212
Yeah. Are you?

385
00:24:58,673 --> 00:24:59,673
Absolutely.

386
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,613
- Hello.
- <i>Stephen Trager, please.</i>

387
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:30,518
He's not in. Can I take a message?

388
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:32,676
I'm calling from the Stratford Hotel.

389
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,786
<i>Mr. Trager stayed here last weekend,</i>

390
00:25:34,906 --> 00:25:37,920
<i>and it seems he left
his contact lenses in his room.</i>

391
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:40,365
My dad doesn't wear contacts.

392
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:42,144
<i>Are you certain? He was the last...</i>

393
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:43,374
Who is that?

394
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:45,489
Wrong number.

395
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:46,989
Okay.

396
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:03,084
Here's hoping the test goes
as well as it did in simulations.

397
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:08,494
Well, you'll be fired if it doesn't.

398
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:12,242
Kidding.

399
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:14,619
But Hollander's out on her ass.

400
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:24,258
Mr. Ballantine's office.

401
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:27,680
<i>I've got a package for Mr. Ballantine
that I need a signature for.</i>

402
00:26:27,983 --> 00:26:29,089
<i>I'll be right down.</i>

403
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:30,209
Thanks.

404
00:26:59,331 --> 00:27:01,088
How do we bypass the security system?

405
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,826
Once I get inside Ballantine's office...

406
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:04,557
<i>Your password, sir.</i>

407
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:08,762
<i>I'll be able to access
the Madacorp mainframe.</i>

408
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:13,183
<i>That'll give me
complete control of all building's</i>

409
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:15,644
<i>video cameras, doors,
and retina scanners.</i>

410
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:21,373
<i>I'll be able to switch the image
of Foss' retina with Ballantine's.</i>

411
00:27:23,404 --> 00:27:25,101
<i>And you know where you'll be.</i>

412
00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:36,244
Let me go, man! Get off me!

413
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:38,652
Gonna take this punk upstairs.
Cops gonna deal with him.

414
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:40,671
Get off me, man! I didn't do anything!

415
00:27:41,046 --> 00:27:43,051
The truth is out there!
Resistance is futile!

416
00:27:46,871 --> 00:27:48,974
You have a package here
for Mr. Ballantine?

417
00:27:56,785 --> 00:27:59,011
<i>Thank you, Mr. Ballantine.</i>

418
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:10,882
Damn it, did you have
to practically break my arm?

419
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:12,419
I had to look convincing.

420
00:28:12,714 --> 00:28:14,165
Why not just taser me?

421
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,042
I considered it.

422
00:28:21,457 --> 00:28:22,687
Don't mess this up.

423
00:28:23,474 --> 00:28:25,367
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

424
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:28,001
<i>You copy, Smith?</i>

425
00:28:29,948 --> 00:28:30,843
Go for Smith.

426
00:28:30,963 --> 00:28:34,430
We got a report of a disturbance
in the North B stairwell.

427
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:36,771
Copy that.

428
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:03,382
<i>The guard will be detained...</i>

429
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:05,795
<i>and so will the assistant.</i>

430
00:29:11,443 --> 00:29:12,808
Foss, you're good to go.

431
00:29:18,442 --> 00:29:19,475
781227.

432
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,078
My code name at Zzyzx.

433
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:24,820
What did Ballantine
have to do with Zzyzx?

434
00:29:42,716 --> 00:29:44,792
I need to see my dad right now.

435
00:29:45,028 --> 00:29:46,430
<i>Miss, is he expecting you?</i>

436
00:29:46,693 --> 00:29:48,115
No, he's not expecting me.

437
00:29:48,235 --> 00:29:50,296
I tell you it's a family emergency!

438
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:51,888
He's in the middle of a software test.

439
00:29:52,011 --> 00:29:53,132
Fine. I'll wait.

440
00:30:07,524 --> 00:30:10,253
<i>I had no idea what I'd find
on Ballantine's computer,</i>

441
00:30:10,752 --> 00:30:12,027
<i>but once I was there,</i>

442
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,696
<i>I had to take advantage
of the opportunity.</i>

443
00:30:17,254 --> 00:30:18,914
<i>781228.</i>

444
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,461
<i>I thought the experiments
at Zzyzx had ended with me.</i>

445
00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:27,047
Well, looks like you two have
your jobs for another day.

446
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:29,711
- Was that a congratulations?
- I think so.

447
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:37,177
Lori, what's wrong?

448
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:40,013
I need to talk to you in private.

449
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:42,460
Well, let's go to my office.

450
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:44,277
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

451
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:01,407
Looks like someone's upset
over some contact lenses.

452
00:31:17,922 --> 00:31:18,968
We got a problem.

453
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,095
- Did you get the ring?
- <i>No.</i>

454
00:31:21,674 --> 00:31:24,349
Ballantine has it.
He's headed your way. Get out now.

455
00:31:43,383 --> 00:31:44,577
Mr. Ballantine,

456
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:46,329
there has been a security breach.

457
00:32:11,748 --> 00:32:13,189
Are you Paige?

458
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:14,690
Where's your mommy?

459
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:15,929
Away.

460
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:23,950
- What's wrong?
- I wanted a lion.

461
00:32:28,838 --> 00:32:30,534
- Can I have a crayon?
- Sure.

462
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:40,883
Who are you?

463
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:43,177
Just a friend.

464
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:54,891
What's going on?

465
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,471
Honey, whatever it is, you can tell me.

466
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:01,453
Are you having an affair with Emily?

467
00:33:03,592 --> 00:33:04,782
Why would you think that?

468
00:33:05,141 --> 00:33:06,203
The hotel called,

469
00:33:06,323 --> 00:33:08,062
the one you stayed at
on your business trip.

470
00:33:08,182 --> 00:33:10,287
They said you left your
contact lenses in the room.

471
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:12,247
I don't wear contacts.

472
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:14,249
I know. But Emily does.

473
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,456
Oh, honey, the hotel made a mistake.

474
00:33:18,654 --> 00:33:20,154
I'm just afraid you did.

475
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:25,594
Nothing happened.

476
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:28,293
I've seen how you act when she calls.

477
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,767
You get all happy and excited.

478
00:33:30,924 --> 00:33:32,732
We work together.
She understands what I do.

479
00:33:32,852 --> 00:33:34,352
She understands you're married?

480
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:39,084
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

481
00:33:39,204 --> 00:33:40,320
No problem.

482
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:46,865
That guard is Kyle's handler.

483
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:54,616
- Did you get the ring?
- No.

484
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:55,973
We got to get out of here.

485
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,375
Wait. Where's Foss?

486
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:58,334
He's coming.

487
00:33:58,913 --> 00:33:59,913
There he is.

488
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,227
Ballantine's headed this way.

489
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:06,546
- Wait. Is he close?
- What?

490
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:07,898
Yes. We got to go.

491
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:10,008
Can you stop the doors from retracting?

492
00:34:10,143 --> 00:34:11,209
I can.

493
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,550
What?

494
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:16,895
MacGyver reruns.

495
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,109
<i>The problem seemed complex,</i>

496
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:26,196
<i>but the math was a simple mix
of algebra and geometry.</i>

497
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:29,115
<i>The angle of the incidence
equals the angle of</i>

498
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,742
<i>reflection on the Madacorp logo.</i>

499
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:33,036
- What are you doing? Kyle!
- Come on, man.

500
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,204
That gave me Ballantine's distance.

501
00:34:36,295 --> 00:34:38,417
<i>Distance divided by the time
told me that he'd reach</i>

502
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:39,560
<i>the elevator in...</i>

503
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,791
Three, two, one.

504
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:42,953
Do it now.

505
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:02,488
Lock down the building now.

506
00:35:05,906 --> 00:35:08,144
The building is now on lockdown.

507
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:10,197
There's an emergency exit
out in the lobby.

508
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:16,212
Are you okay?

509
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:17,997
Uh, I'm fine.

510
00:35:18,176 --> 00:35:19,332
You're not fine.

511
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:20,889
Get up. Come on.

512
00:35:22,602 --> 00:35:23,762
We got company.

513
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,750
- Just leave me.
- No.

514
00:35:26,803 --> 00:35:27,868
They're coming.

515
00:35:27,988 --> 00:35:29,003
Get him out of here.

516
00:35:29,404 --> 00:35:31,302
- What are you gonna do?
- Buy you some time.

517
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:33,596
- We're not leaving you.
- Listen to me.

518
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:35,556
The ring is all you need.

519
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:37,224
- What?
- Now go.

520
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:39,639
- Thank you.
- Get out of here!

521
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,125
We need backup, Level 3!

522
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,267
Stupid ankle.

523
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,783
- I have to go back.
- You can't.

524
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:11,922
They'll take the ring,
it'll have been for nothing.

525
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,454
- But Foss...
- He wanted you to get that ring back.

526
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:20,018
I hope it's worth it.

527
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:38,063
Sir,

528
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:40,362
we got this one,
but the others got away.

529
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,759
Take him to room 237.

530
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:46,076
Move it.

531
00:37:56,258 --> 00:37:57,648
A kiss for Mommy?

532
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,805
I missed you.

533
00:38:00,057 --> 00:38:01,826
I missed you more.

534
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,489
Is this me?

535
00:38:04,635 --> 00:38:06,956
No. That's my new friend.

536
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,541
Your new friend?

537
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:12,332
Yeah. She made me these.

538
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:25,850
Okay, sweetie, let's go.

539
00:38:30,528 --> 00:38:31,547
I was just...

540
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,381
returning a CD of Lori's.

541
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:38,863
Did you have fun,
doing whatever you had to do?

542
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:42,199
I wish I could have gone
to the concert with you.

543
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:44,588
It's okay.

544
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:46,752
I understand.

545
00:38:49,964 --> 00:38:51,612
Actually, I don't understand.

546
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:54,021
One minute you're thrilled
to spend time with me

547
00:38:54,157 --> 00:38:55,664
and all excited to go to the concert,

548
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:58,067
and then you cancel
without telling me why.

549
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:02,100
You say it's important, but
you won't tell me why it's important.

550
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:06,807
I know what's going on.

551
00:39:07,435 --> 00:39:08,517
You do?

552
00:39:09,464 --> 00:39:11,038
I rushed you into this.

553
00:39:11,345 --> 00:39:13,105
Admit it. Now you're having doubts.

554
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:16,817
I do have doubts, but...

555
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,528
If that's the way you feel,
I need to tell you something...

556
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,690
No.

557
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,734
I have doubts
about everything in my life...

558
00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:27,494
except how I feel about you.

559
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:29,959
I just...

560
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:46,138
What did you need to tell me?

561
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:48,809
Not important.

562
00:40:07,836 --> 00:40:09,250
How bad do you suck?

563
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:11,398
Well, you do.

564
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:15,513
Gonna give me a chance?

565
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,150
At the game?

566
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:23,652
Aren't you working?

567
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:26,579
You're just afraid I'll smoke you.

568
00:40:26,702 --> 00:40:27,734
Right.

569
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:29,338
Dream much?

570
00:40:39,672 --> 00:40:41,234
I got the test results.

571
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:50,901
And?

572
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,205
Let's just say I'm gonna
need a lot of Popsicles.

573
00:41:14,652 --> 00:41:15,835
Cherry okay?

574
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:24,089
My favorite.

575
00:41:27,737 --> 00:41:28,840
Want half?

576
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:30,402
Cool.

577
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,208
- My turn?
- Hit it.

578
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:38,777
I'm gonna try the...

579
00:41:42,937 --> 00:41:43,963
Mr. Ballantine?

580
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:45,131
Your appointment is here.

581
00:41:45,251 --> 00:41:46,519
Send him in.

582
00:41:51,554 --> 00:41:53,347
It's nice to finally
meet you, Mr. Taylor.

583
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:54,993
Pleasure.

584
00:41:58,303 --> 00:41:59,687
We had a little security breach.

585
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:02,744
Someone stole my ring,
but it's being taken care of.

586
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,025
It had better be.

587
00:42:06,682 --> 00:42:08,568
No need for alarm. It was just a...

588
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:10,197
heirloom from my late father.

589
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,921
An heirloom.

590
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,450
That heirloom is a Latnock ring.

591
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:20,240
You people and your rings.

592
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:24,211
Forgive me if I don't lose any sleep
over a glorified pledge pin.

593
00:42:24,428 --> 00:42:26,924
You really don't have any idea

594
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:29,064
how important that ring is.

595
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:30,676
Do you?

596
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:46,608
<i>Adam Baylin's secret had been locked
inside this box for 15 years,</i>

597
00:42:47,377 --> 00:42:49,226
<i>almost as long as I'd been alive.</i>

598
00:42:50,221 --> 00:42:52,531
<i>Would his secrets provide
the answers to my own?</i>

599
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:54,753
Or simply raise more questions?

600
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:58,079
There was only one way to know for sure.
