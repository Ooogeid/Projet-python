00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,332
<i>Previously on</i> Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,512
- Why are you acting so weird?
- Nicole says it's 'cause I like you.

3
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:09,618
- Don't you like me?
- Yeah, I do.

4
00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:13,142
You make fun of me, you put me down, and
you always have to have the last word.

5
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:16,100
- I thought that was our thing.
- We have a thing?

6
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,408
- I'm Adam Baylin.
- What do you want from me?

7
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:22,376
- What would you like to know?
- Zzyzx was my conception, Kyle.

8
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:25,772
You're saying I was gestated
inside one of those tanks at Zzyzx.

9
00:00:25,962 --> 00:00:27,001
So you created me.

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,297
I worked security at Zzyzx for years!
I know every in and out.

11
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:33,124
- There are innocents!
- They'd kill Baylin, they'll kill you!

12
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,215
- Kyle, what's wrong?
- That's him.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,356
I am the only one that you can trust.

14
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:41,993
- What did you see?
- Adam was there?

15
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:43,406
- Baylin?
- He gave me this.

16
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:47,109
The important thing now is trying
to figure out what the message is.

17
00:00:47,277 --> 00:00:48,662
Foss, I need to talk to you.

18
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:52,811
What's going on?

19
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:54,744
- Who the hell was that?
- Declan.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,652
I never thought I'd see
you deal with anything like this.

21
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:01,738
Look, some coward jumped me. I'm not
gonna let him get the best of me.

22
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,902
I think you can let
yourself freak out a little.

23
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:07,173
- Her sole focus should be Kyle.
- She's been willful and defiant.

24
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:10,129
She's a computer with a glitch.
Bring her in. We'll fix her.

25
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:13,413
- Why did we come to your office?
- To get you some help.

26
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:15,792
- You remember Mr. Ballantine?
- Hello, Jessi.

27
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,676
I got your message.

28
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,456
- You're back.
- Anything come up?

29
00:01:35,357 --> 00:01:36,671
Where were you?

30
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:41,582
You just took off and cleared
everything out of here.

31
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:44,632
Well, I wasn't gonna
leave it just lying around.

32
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:47,491
What is it?

33
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:50,024
What happened?

34
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,391
She was attacked two weeks ago.

35
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,396
Attacked?

36
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:08,285
You think...

37
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:13,042
You think I did it?

38
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:18,757
I wouldn't hurt her.

39
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:20,491
Did you leave that warning for Declan?

40
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:24,131
Only to keep him away, to protect you.

41
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,374
By threatening my friend
and hurting my sister?

42
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:28,092
I said I didn't do it.

43
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:32,132
And how could you think that I would?

44
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:39,600
That's from Baylin.

45
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,494
Why would he leave that?

46
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:50,786
I've been struggling with
that same question myself.

47
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:54,225
You expect me to trust you?

48
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:56,010
Tell me where you went.

49
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:04,212
Let's get back to work.

50
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:13,326
Wait!

51
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:18,121
This is it?

52
00:03:19,343 --> 00:03:21,060
Just gonna walk on out?

53
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:23,658
After everything?

54
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:28,407
I'm sorry.

Season 2 Episode 9
- The Ghost In The Machine -

58
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:18,875
There's the genius at work.

59
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:22,160
What kind of genius
plays with human life?

60
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:25,771
Adam, you're trying
to better human life.

61
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:27,932
At the cost of too many innocents.

62
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,187
If this one doesn't survive
the extraction process,

63
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:34,125
I'm shutting us down.

64
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:36,384
Just like that?

65
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,228
I'm sorry, Brian.

66
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,472
I know how hard you've worked
to make this happen for me.

67
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,470
You're damn right.

68
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:52,799
I'm not gonna let you give up.

69
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,813
This one's different.

70
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,991
That boy of yours will be our salvation.

71
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:03,616
Salvation.

72
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:06,474
Your Bible is showing.

73
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:09,986
Yeah, well ... old habits
die hard, right?

74
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:14,410
Look, your friend Kern has, um,

75
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:16,158
finally lost it.

76
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:19,627
I already told you
I can't let you in there.

77
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:22,106
- What are you talking about?
- I will not allow you

78
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:23,992
to extract the subject.

79
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:28,582
The subject is a person,
William! A child!

80
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,275
You're letting your
emotions cloud your science.

81
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,183
I thought I taught you better than that.

82
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:37,880
- Adam.
- Get your hands off me.

83
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,693
This is my company!

84
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,956
Well, you're the only ones

85
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:44,482
- who still think so.
- What?

86
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,812
Let's just say your backers are
a little more motivated by my plan.

87
00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:51,158
Your plan?

88
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,069
You were a frustrated
academic worried about tenure

89
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,840
before Adam brought you in here.

90
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,387
What I know is that
781227 is more valuable

91
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:03,230
to this company if it remains inside.

92
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,949
You can't keep him in
there like he's some machine.

93
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:07,802
He is a person!

94
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:10,066
A human being!

95
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:13,416
Well, that's not how I see it.

96
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,445
Then you and I have a problem.

97
00:07:34,643 --> 00:07:36,734
<i>Foss' words kept ringing in my head.</i>

98
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,934
<i>He'd done so much for me,
and we'd been through so much together,</i>

99
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:41,945
<i>it was hard for me
to accept his betrayal.</i>

100
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:43,487
So how'd it go ?

101
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:48,093
- We're done.
- Good riddance.

102
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,637
Foss was bad news.

103
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,402
- I know you don't like him, but...
- What?

104
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:55,718
He threatened to hurt Lori
and then she gets beat up.

105
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:57,925
Then Baylin, the guy you said
had the answers

106
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,512
-  to everything leaves you a warning.
- Okay.

107
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:02,229
I get it.

108
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:04,590
We got a bigger problem anyway.

109
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,678
Lori's got this screwed-up idea

110
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:09,348
to drive to a spot in the woods
where some hunter was killed.

111
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:10,485
Why?

112
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:13,360
I think she's trying to prove
she's not traumatized

113
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,156
by what happened at the dance.

114
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:17,673
So she found the scariest
thing she could get into.

115
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,507
That sounds like a terrible idea.

116
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:21,574
You haven't heard all of it.

117
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:23,475
That spot in the woods?

118
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:26,383
- It's right where Zzyzx used to be.
- We're not going.

119
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:29,004
- Excuse me?
- Declan told me where you wanna go.

120
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,943
I'm going.
If you guys wanna flake, fine.

121
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:34,185
Whatever it is, me and Andy are in.

122
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:35,679
No one invited you.

123
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:39,774
- Rude.
- I meant "you" as in "him." No offense.

124
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:40,936
None taken.

125
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:42,448
Wait a minute.

126
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,376
Dad's away on business.

127
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,303
So that typically means a night
of watching old musicals with Mom.

128
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,213
So I may have to show her my Lori file.

129
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,934
And I have to warn you,

130
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,392
I have photos.

131
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:58,091
Welcome aboard.

132
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:06,063
That's Amanda.

133
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:12,342
- Hey.
- Hey.

134
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:21,447
Yo. Amanda. You should get
the scoop about tonight's big event.

135
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,759
- What big event?
- Lori Trager's excellent adventure!

136
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:26,410
No one's going anywhere.

137
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:28,140
Don't be such a buzzkill.

138
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:30,136
She's in there.

139
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:36,581
Listen...

140
00:09:37,582 --> 00:09:39,490
I need you to do me a favor.

141
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:42,290
I want you to read Andy's mind.

142
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:45,863
I don't know. Note her sweat
glands, analyze her aura.

143
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:48,792
Work your extraterrestrial mojo.

144
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:50,955
What are you talking about?

145
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:54,168
I think I like her...

146
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,912
in that "I wanna be alone with
her in a dark place" sort of way.

147
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,601
Oh.

148
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:04,287
And I need to know
if she feels the same way about me.

149
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,107
Your sister said
since you have a job now,

150
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,447
you're paying for the gas.

151
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,687
Tell her no... and feel free
to slap her upside the head.

152
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:12,960
She thought you'd say that.

153
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,326
She said to mention how your dad might
like to know who crashed his laptop.

154
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:19,241
Blackmail runs in the family.

155
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:21,493
We need serious munchies.

156
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:23,385
We should find someplace else to go.

157
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,512
What would be creepier
than the scene of an actual murder?

158
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:28,445
My mom's been on the warpath lately.

159
00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:30,561
You guys can go, but I better stay here.

160
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:33,287
Come on, Amanda.
Where's your sense of adventure?

161
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,711
Whoever killed that hunter
could still be out there.

162
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:37,037
That sounds really appealing.

163
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:40,276
Trager, this is lame.
We're not 12-year-olds at summer camp.

164
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:42,154
Hey, Kyle.

165
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,616
Hey, Jessi.

166
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:46,505
What's up?

167
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:50,745
How did you get in here?

168
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:52,782
The door was open.

169
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:54,097
Well, we were just leaving.

170
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:57,000
- Can I come?
- You don't even know where we're going.

171
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,297
Because we're not.

172
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,562
Great.
I'll just stay here with you, then.

173
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:02,282
New player on the field.

174
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:05,201
What are we waiting for?

175
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:08,717
- Amanda, I though you said...
- I changed my mind.

176
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:11,513
You coming?

177
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,301
- All right.
- And then there were seven.

178
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,655
Come on, you guys, keep up.

179
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:23,191
Whatever, bossy.

180
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:24,859
This is the murder site.

181
00:11:25,112 --> 00:11:26,724
I looked it up online.

182
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:31,636
Lori, are you okay?

183
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:33,592
You keep drinking.

184
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:37,282
I really appreciate the whole
"concerned brother" thing, but...

185
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:40,152
let's skip the
After School Special routine.

186
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:44,353
What's this?

187
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:00,275
Don't worry.
There's no such thing as ghosts.

188
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:02,582
Then why can I see them?

189
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:04,756
You guys! Get over here! Hurry!

190
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:06,176
It's Lori!

191
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:15,556
I saw her go down there.

192
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,591
Trager, quit messing around!

193
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,311
Lori, get out! It's not safe!

194
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:25,222
What's wrong?

195
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:27,862
Zzyzx. That's a way in.

196
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,537
Lori, get the hell out! Now!

197
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,091
Cool! What is this place?

198
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:34,735
RESTRICTED AREA KEAP OUT

199
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:38,871
Get your candy asses down here!

200
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:43,142
- I have to go get her.
- I'll go with you.

201
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:44,547
Wait!

202
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:48,396
- What?
- She's your sister!

203
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,874
And following her into a porthole to
hell isn't part of my job description.

204
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,946
However, I will contribute.

205
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,072
Everyone stay here.

206
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:08,157
We'll be back as soon as we can.

207
00:13:09,662 --> 00:13:10,662
Be careful.

208
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:37,378
Are you okay?

209
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:40,130
It's just a little... tight.

210
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:42,266
I'm sort of claustrophobic.

211
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:43,526
Careful.

212
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,722
Fire doors. They work on gravity.

213
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,084
We don't want those to come down.

214
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:50,906
How did you know about that?

215
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:54,404
I don't know, I just do.

216
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:56,401
This isn't a game
of hide and seek, boys.

217
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,417
This isn't a game, Trager!

218
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:00,494
Did you see that?

219
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:13,553
<i>I suddenly found myself
transported to the Zzyzx of the past,</i>

220
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:16,161
<i>as if I were reliving a memory.</i>

221
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:18,992
<i>But how could I remember this and why?</i>

222
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:25,187
<i>I realized Adam
couldn't hear me or see me,</i>

223
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:27,632
<i>but I could watch the memory unfold.</i>

224
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:29,838
Take him out, now!

225
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,332
<i>It was Professor Kern.</i>

226
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:33,533
<i>Was this the moment he betrayed Adam?</i>

227
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:35,552
Get off me!

228
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,784
Get off me! You're making a mistake!

229
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,280
Let me go!

230
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:50,743
- You can't do this.
- It's already done. Move him out.

231
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,207
You're not gonna get away with it, Kern.

232
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:55,267
Run!

233
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:59,376
Kyle! What is it!
Why'd you rush in here?

234
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,104
I think there's something here.

235
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:12,224
How'd you know that was there?

236
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,319
I think a ghost showed it to me.

237
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:21,097
It's not that hard.
Pick a character from the show.

238
00:15:22,564 --> 00:15:23,635
Let's see.

239
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:28,172
I'm funny, likeable,
and, dare I say, philosophical.

240
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:32,553
- I'll going with Shaggy.
- Wrong. You're Velma...

241
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:34,620
with a Daphne overlay.

242
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:37,418
Kyle's totally Fred,
minus the blond hair and the scarf.

243
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:40,288
Which character are you, Jessi?

244
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,624
I've never seen Scooby-Doo.

245
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:44,691
What? The Mystery Machine?

246
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:48,415
Scooby Snacks?
Subversive plot references?

247
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:52,359
- Where are you going?
- To find Kyle.

248
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:54,055
But he told us to stay here.

249
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:56,783
Do you always do
what people tell you to?

250
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:59,115
I just thought it'd be
safer if we all stayed put.

251
00:15:59,465 --> 00:16:00,465
Then stay put.

252
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,270
Catfight.

253
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:16,740
Alone at last.

254
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:21,092
- Think you can get a fire going?
- Not a problem.

255
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:22,720
What if Zzyzx is haunted?

256
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:24,455
There's no such thing as haunted.

257
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:27,463
People hear scratches at the window,
it's just a tree in the wind.

258
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:31,334
- Foss.
- What?

259
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,058
<i>I followed Foss and once
again stepped into the past.</i>

260
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,571
<i>When I saw the pod,</i>

261
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:56,262
<i>I realized this is the room where
I spent the first 16 years of my life.</i>

262
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,867
<i>As I looked at myself,</i>

263
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:07,495
<i>I wondered what they
were doing to me all those years.</i>

264
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,566
<i>Did anyone care what I was feeling?</i>

265
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,339
I don't know why
you insist on playing that.

266
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:43,564
It can't comprehend it.

267
00:17:46,928 --> 00:17:49,196
I'm prepping for a data
input retention test.

268
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,202
Don't let anyone through the door.

269
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:54,170
Data input retention test.

270
00:17:57,246 --> 00:17:58,369
Do your job.

271
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,464
You know, one of these days,

272
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:10,205
he's gonna tell you what
you can do with your tests.

273
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:17,244
<i>What was a data input retention test?</i>

274
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:20,399
<i>And why was Foss so concerned?</i>

275
00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:23,047
We're losing the sun here.

276
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:25,482
How's that fire coming, Prometheus?

277
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,085
I almost got it.

278
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,097
I thought you'd be better
at rubbing wood.

279
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:33,788
I need a breather.

280
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,588
I can't believe you brought
Sour Patch Kids but no matches.

281
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:43,711
Such a wimp. It's not that cold.

282
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:49,579
Where are they already?

283
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:51,638
Kyle's with them. No worries.

284
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:54,244
What's to worry about?
All of our friends just disappeared

285
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,350
into a big black hole
in the middle of nowhere.

286
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:58,734
- What?
- Nothing.

287
00:18:58,883 --> 00:19:00,431
Then stop staring at me like that.

288
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,896
I wasn't. I was just
thinking about that...

289
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:06,323
drainage pipe.

290
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:09,222
Where does it lead to?

291
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:11,212
A government LSD lab?

292
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:14,420
A secret prison where inmates
fight to the death to be set free?

293
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:16,989
You play way too much G-Force.

294
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:20,197
- All right. What do you think it is?
- How about a drainage pipe?

295
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,975
Okay. I get it.
You're scared, so you mask it

296
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:26,621
- with extra-strength sarcasm.
- I'm not scared.

297
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:28,882
Being afraid of
things is a big waste of time.

298
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:32,562
You're staring again.

299
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:45,104
This seemed like such
a good idea four beers ago.

300
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:47,537
Lovely.

301
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:51,426
Are you a natural blonde?

302
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:53,623
Excuse me?

303
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:55,447
I heard blondes have more fun.

304
00:19:57,624 --> 00:20:00,095
I guess it depends on the blonde. Why?

305
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,546
Kyle likes you.

306
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:03,390
I thought that was the reason.

307
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:05,180
My hair color?

308
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:07,319
Why else would he like you?

309
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:10,393
I don't know, really.

310
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,815
Maybe there isn't a good reason.

311
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:16,430
Do you always just say
what you're thinking?

312
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:17,649
I guess.

313
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:21,048
Does he like that you're so...

314
00:20:21,474 --> 00:20:23,052
good all the time?

315
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:26,142
If you're so interested in why
Kyle likes me,

316
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:27,989
why don't you just ask him yourself?

317
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,875
- All right.
- No! I mean, why do you care so much?

318
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:36,156
Listen, just so you know,
Kyle is with me!

319
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,150
It's not supposed to be that way.

320
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,567
Well, that's how it is!

321
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:42,789
Once we get to know each other,
he'll understand.

322
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,182
Oh, I wouldn't count on it.

323
00:20:44,303 --> 00:20:46,649
Kyle doesn't go for the
emotionally tortured type.

324
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:48,557
Kyle and I have a connection.

325
00:20:49,225 --> 00:20:51,746
What are you talking about?
Last week, you were all over Declan!

326
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:53,684
Declan? I don't want Declan!

327
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:54,805
I want Kyle.

328
00:20:57,104 --> 00:20:58,105
Trager!

329
00:20:58,898 --> 00:21:00,291
Where the hell have you guys been?

330
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:01,581
Lori, get out of there!

331
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:07,525
Kyle! Declan! Can you guys hear me?

332
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:09,632
Oh, my God!

333
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,784
<i>Hello?</i>

334
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,345
Lori!

335
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:14,422
Declan!

336
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:16,959
<i>Kyle! Can you hear me?</i>

337
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:20,536
Kyle! Declan! Can you hear me?

338
00:21:23,787 --> 00:21:25,754
Okay... don't panic.

339
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,507
You have a flashlight.

340
00:21:31,543 --> 00:21:32,974
You have got to be kidding me.

341
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:35,177
Okay.

342
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:37,126
Okay, Trager, stay calm.

343
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:43,952
Please don't be a crazy guy with an axe.

344
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:47,621
No. No. No. No. No.

345
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:49,457
Son of a...

346
00:22:02,915 --> 00:22:04,379
Stay here. I'll check it out.

347
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:05,994
Where am I gonna go?

348
00:22:09,906 --> 00:22:12,287
What do you mean
"It's not giving back the information"?

349
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:13,861
It depends on what we ask.

350
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:15,607
Math problems are fine.

351
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,842
We input the question,

352
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:20,326
he outputs the answer
just like he's supposed to.

353
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:24,352
Is that correct?

354
00:22:24,741 --> 00:22:27,605
Yes, that equation would take
our most advanced mathematician

355
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:29,798
- two weeks to solve.
- So what's the issue?

356
00:22:30,204 --> 00:22:33,401
For one, it won't process any of
our strategic warfare scenarios,

357
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:35,984
almost like it's making judgment calls.

358
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:40,029
<i>I'd somehow rejected the information
they wanted me to process.</i>

359
00:22:40,231 --> 00:22:42,304
It can't make judgment calls.

360
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:44,492
It's like saying
my toaster has a conscience.

361
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:48,305
When your toaster malfunctions, you go
out and buy a new, but 781227 costs...

362
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:49,694
I know what it costs.

363
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,396
Yeah, it's Kern.

364
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:56,404
781227 is no longer cooperating.

365
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:57,806
Yeah.

366
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:09,139
Too bad they don't have merit
badges for porn or video games.

367
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,062
You'd be an Eagle Scout by now.

368
00:23:11,662 --> 00:23:13,349
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

369
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:24,678
It's getting late.
We should go after them.

370
00:23:25,477 --> 00:23:26,969
I'm more worried about us.

371
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:29,009
This is exactly how those movies start.

372
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,973
They kill the impishly handsome
young comedy relief first.

373
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,108
Only comedy going on here
is you trying to start that fire.

374
00:23:41,142 --> 00:23:43,269
Let's go back to the car.
It'll be warmer in there.

375
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:44,536
I'm not that cold.

376
00:23:45,331 --> 00:23:47,105
Says the girl with two jackets on.

377
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,195
Dead end.

378
00:24:18,117 --> 00:24:19,125
Perfect.

379
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:23,084
<i>I could tell his fear was growing,
and I tried to keep his mind off of it.</i>

380
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:25,839
I have a question about girls.

381
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:28,150
Don't ask me.

382
00:24:28,377 --> 00:24:30,745
I just got blown off by
the weirdest one I know.

383
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:35,208
I don't get it. One minute
you think she's weird, and...

384
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:37,048
the other you're sorry she's gone.

385
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:38,641
Yeah.

386
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:41,142
I don't get it, either.

387
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,552
<i>Declan was hiding another fear,</i>

388
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:45,999
<i>just like the one I had about Foss...</i>

389
00:24:46,364 --> 00:24:47,467
<i>betrayal.</i>

390
00:24:48,017 --> 00:24:50,399
- You're worried Jessi likes me.
- No.

391
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,262
You think she does?

392
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,344
I don't know, but if she does,

393
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:01,012
Don't worry,
I wouldn't do that to a friend.

394
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:07,959
I kissed Amanda.

395
00:25:09,562 --> 00:25:10,676
I knew it.

396
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,057
You had this weird morning-after vibe.

397
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:16,734
I just can't figure out if...

398
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:18,114
...we're a couple or not.

399
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,819
What you need is the kiss test.

400
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:23,860
This first kiss is the stuff of
romantic comedy endings.

401
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,980
The second kiss?

402
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,954
That's the one that defines
the relationship.

403
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:28,841
- So all I have to do is just...
- Amanda?

404
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:31,397
- What are you doing down here?
- Looking for you.

405
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,078
We told you not to do that.

406
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,574
- I know, but Jessi went down...
- Jessi's down here, too?

407
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:39,442
I'm sure she's fine. She's a lot scarier
than anything else down here.

408
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:30,913
Stop it!

409
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,473
What is that?

410
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,445
It's methane gas.

411
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:40,795
Must be a natural pocket beneath us.
We have to get out of here fast.

412
00:26:50,473 --> 00:26:52,019
How much time do we have?

413
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:54,404
Gas could have been released
all over the complex.

414
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,839
There's no way to estimate
how much is leaking in.

415
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:59,420
Great. I'm gonna die
like a canary in a coal mine.

416
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:01,203
What way do we go?

417
00:27:01,472 --> 00:27:03,919
There's gotta be a map or something
on one of these walls.

418
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:06,277
Complete with a "you are here" sticker?

419
00:27:06,586 --> 00:27:08,296
I'm trying to get us out of here,
Trager.

420
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,385
Why don't you ask the ghost
to show you the way?

421
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:21,478
I was kidding.

422
00:27:23,252 --> 00:27:24,527
<i>Declan was right.</i>

423
00:27:24,884 --> 00:27:28,127
<i>I didn't know how or why,
but I suddenly saw an escape.</i>

424
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:36,072
Go down the hallway. Make the first left
you can. There's a door in the corridor.

425
00:27:36,293 --> 00:27:37,486
That's the way out.

426
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:40,633
There's no fire doors between us and
that point, you shouldn't have problem.

427
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,735
- Follow me.
- Wait, aren't you coming?

428
00:27:43,485 --> 00:27:45,378
- I have to find Jessi.
- I'll come with you.

429
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:48,378
I need you to be safe.

430
00:27:56,363 --> 00:27:57,384
Come on.

431
00:28:00,043 --> 00:28:02,613
<i>Kern, 781227's lab.</i>

432
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,998
- What happened?
- It's the cool memory matrix.

433
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,194
The entire Zzyzx data bank.
All research, everything we've ever done

434
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:15,522
or recorded.

435
00:28:16,205 --> 00:28:18,461
- It's been copied.
- Copied? Where?

436
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:24,547
<i>Finally, I understood.</i>

437
00:28:24,735 --> 00:28:27,584
<i>I had copied all the data
from the Zzyzx mainframe,</i>

438
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,702
<i>including every frame of surveillance
footage their cameras had ever recorded.</i>

439
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:33,682
<i>I hadn't been seeing ghosts.</i>

440
00:28:33,952 --> 00:28:35,821
<i>I'd been seeing the past.</i>

441
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:37,777
It can't do that.

442
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:40,826
It can't make decisions
and act on its own.

443
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:42,893
That's exactly what it's doing, sir.

444
00:28:43,213 --> 00:28:44,850
Well, then disconnect it now.

445
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:45,979
Kern!

446
00:28:46,284 --> 00:28:47,691
Disengaging neuron...

447
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:50,392
<i>I had spent my whole life fearing them,</i>

448
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,396
<i>when in reality, they feared me.</i>

449
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,118
<i>I was the ghost...</i>

450
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:55,568
<i>the ghost in the machine.</i>

451
00:28:55,863 --> 00:28:57,507
Begin protocols for termination.

452
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:00,486
I won't let you do this, Kern.

453
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:02,859
<i>Kern wanted me dead.</i>

454
00:29:03,294 --> 00:29:04,916
<i>But I knew somehow...</i>

455
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:06,908
<i>Foss had saved me.</i>

456
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,127
So...

457
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,900
it's a nice night out here.

458
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:23,905
I'm just saying.

459
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:25,217
Despite...

460
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:28,549
everyone we know may be
perishing underground right now, it's...

461
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,856
a nice night out... here.

462
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:38,776
I can't take it anymore.
What is up with you?

463
00:29:39,534 --> 00:29:43,168
And don't say nothing, because we both
know you've been rambling all night.

464
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:45,182
Even more than usual.

465
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:48,465
And you've had zero tolerance
for my witty banter.

466
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:52,545
If you've got something to say,
forget the jokes.

467
00:29:52,714 --> 00:29:54,279
Man up and say it.

468
00:29:58,621 --> 00:29:59,625
Okay.

469
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,248
I have a proposal.

470
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,849
I mean, idea.

471
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:09,973
Let's count to three

472
00:30:10,353 --> 00:30:12,593
and both say what's on our minds
at the same time.

473
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,879
What, are we 12?

474
00:30:16,112 --> 00:30:17,112
Forget it.

475
00:30:23,803 --> 00:30:24,809
Okay.

476
00:30:27,974 --> 00:30:29,151
Okay, I'm in.

477
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:33,372
Here goes.

478
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:37,251
One.

479
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:38,735
- Two.
- Three.

480
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,862
- I have cancer.
- I like you.

481
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:42,410
What?

482
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:43,831
What?

483
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,126
Help!

484
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,426
Help!

485
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:50,066
Josh! Andy! Help!

486
00:30:58,403 --> 00:30:59,409
Holy...

487
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,010
- Kyle!
- Jess!

488
00:31:55,931 --> 00:31:56,997
Is she breathing?

489
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:02,103
I'm okay. We got to her.

490
00:32:02,226 --> 00:32:04,729
You're okay. You're gonna be okay.
Hang on.

491
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:05,968
How did you...

492
00:32:07,412 --> 00:32:09,238
- Where'd he go?
- He went back in.

493
00:32:09,447 --> 00:32:10,454
Why?

494
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:16,211
<i>I knew I couldn't survive
in this gas much longer.</i>

495
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:19,639
<i>But I had to have
what was in Baylin's safe.</i>

496
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,316
<i>As I struggled to open the lock,
I heard a voice...</i>

497
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:25,790
<i>Baylin's voice.</i>

498
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:27,348
<i>Find the answer.</i>

499
00:32:28,077 --> 00:32:29,577
<i>You already have it.</i>

500
00:32:54,396 --> 00:32:56,200
<i>As the gas overpowered me,</i>

501
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:59,134
<i>I feared I'd never make it out alive.</i>

502
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:06,910
<i>And I'd already died in Zzyzx once.</i>

503
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:12,249
<i>If I fell, I knew
I wouldn't be able to get up.</i>

504
00:33:15,116 --> 00:33:17,173
<i>And this time I didn't have Foss
here to help me.</i>

505
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:22,812
<i>So I called upon everything
he had taught me,</i>

506
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:26,553
<i>and how he had sacrificed everything
so that I could live.</i>

507
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:30,984
<i>Now it was my responsibility to survive.</i>

508
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,978
Come on!

509
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,149
Come on.

510
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:45,785
<i>No matter how afraid
I might be at times,</i>

511
00:33:47,741 --> 00:33:49,330
<i>I could never give up.</i>

512
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,002
Oh, God.

513
00:34:10,603 --> 00:34:12,129
Say something if you're okay.

514
00:34:25,812 --> 00:34:27,678
I'm so sorry about tonight.

515
00:34:31,523 --> 00:34:34,597
I guess I should have let you give me
your "After School Special" routine.

516
00:34:34,877 --> 00:34:35,928
That's okay.

517
00:34:36,552 --> 00:34:38,545
Forgiving is what concerned brothers do.

518
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:50,359
I'll be right back.

519
00:34:55,987 --> 00:34:57,238
Some night, huh?

520
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:04,282
It sucks, doesn't it...

521
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:08,169
when the person who turns you on
turns you off?

522
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:14,190
Did I ever tell you about
the healing power of song?

523
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,642
I have a feeling you're about to.

524
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:37,817
Feeling better?

525
00:35:40,812 --> 00:35:42,529
When we were down there,

526
00:35:43,192 --> 00:35:44,486
I saw things...

527
00:35:45,804 --> 00:35:49,107
strange things... happen
and I think it was because of me.

528
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,075
I wouldn't worry about it.

529
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,766
I think the gas was just messing
with all of our heads.

530
00:36:00,764 --> 00:36:02,460
I know you have to go...

531
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:05,687
but I want to say something.

532
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:08,286
You came back for me.

533
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,116
When you reached out for me
and took my hand,

534
00:36:12,855 --> 00:36:15,506
it was the first time
I didn't feel alone.

535
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:20,020
Anyway...

536
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,627
thank you for saving my life.

537
00:36:39,082 --> 00:36:40,693
About what you said...

538
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:42,835
Forget about it.

539
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:46,779
How am I supposed to do that?

540
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:48,428
Easy.

541
00:36:49,003 --> 00:36:51,823
When you feel the urge
to talk about it... don't.

542
00:36:53,741 --> 00:36:55,131
And do me a favor.

543
00:36:55,979 --> 00:36:57,378
Don't tell anyone.

544
00:36:59,994 --> 00:37:01,796
- Andy...
- I'm serious.

545
00:37:25,671 --> 00:37:26,688
You okay?

546
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,248
Yeah.

547
00:37:28,676 --> 00:37:29,706
I guess.

548
00:37:32,175 --> 00:37:36,177
Everyone was really impressed with
the way you held it together tonight.

549
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,012
Lori said you were the most
responsible one there.

550
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,203
Responsible.

551
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:47,213
I should have been more like you.

552
00:37:49,187 --> 00:37:53,343
I almost killed myself going back for
something I ended up not getting anyway.

553
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,755
I could have lost everything.

554
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,743
I could have lost you.

555
00:38:07,158 --> 00:38:08,854
Is this what you wanted?

556
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,247
I had to pry it out of your hands.

557
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:13,367
Seems important, so I kept it.

558
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,921
How am I to thank you?

559
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,108
Does this mean you're
impressed with me now, too?

560
00:38:19,306 --> 00:38:20,917
I'm always impressed with you.

561
00:38:27,468 --> 00:38:29,354
Come on, I'll walk you home.

562
00:38:49,686 --> 00:38:50,958
You're up late.

563
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,228
What's all that?

564
00:38:56,553 --> 00:38:58,758
The... That message from Baylin.

565
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:04,927
I can't figure out how, but somebody
must have tampered with it.

566
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,503
You spent all day working on it.

567
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:12,833
Well, he had no reason not to trust me.

568
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:18,394
Neither do I.

569
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:22,834
You've always been there for me.

570
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,058
You're the reason I'm alive.

571
00:39:40,038 --> 00:39:41,437
This was Baylin's.

572
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:43,484
Can't get it open.

573
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:47,768
We'll figure it out.

574
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:14,032
<i>Being in Zzyzx, I was able to free
myself of the ghosts</i>

575
00:40:14,254 --> 00:40:15,716
<i>that had haunted me.</i>

576
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:20,447
<i>But I still hadn't seen the real danger
hiding in the shadows.</i>

577
00:40:20,756 --> 00:40:23,024
<i>If someone had tampered
with Adam's message,</i>

578
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:26,186
<i>it was someone who wanted me
to lose faith in Foss.</i>

579
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:30,751
<i>I had searched the information I had
acquired at Zzyzx, hoping for a clue.</i>

580
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:35,915
Take him out. Now.

581
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,869
Come on.

582
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,969
Get your hands off me.

583
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:41,350
Get off me!

584
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:45,422
<i>This was the moment that Kern
betrayed Baylin all those years ago.</i>

585
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:49,478
- You can't do this.
- It's already done.

586
00:40:49,665 --> 00:40:50,831
Move him out.

587
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,742
<i>But I was still missing the answer.</i>

588
00:40:55,991 --> 00:40:58,471
<i>You're not gonna get away with it, Kern.</i>

589
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:00,119
Run!

590
00:41:11,395 --> 00:41:13,303
That was a little dramatic,
don't you think?

591
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:16,143
I had to be sure he bought it.

592
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:19,065
Betrayal seems to come easy to you.

593
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:21,731
It's necessary.

594
00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:25,870
I only wish that I could help
him understand

595
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,012
that this thing is bigger
than all of us.

596
00:41:29,692 --> 00:41:32,555
You know, one of these days
we're gonna have to take care of him.

597
00:41:34,988 --> 00:41:36,684
I'd like to see you try.

598
00:41:43,436 --> 00:41:46,500
<i>I realized then that my instincts
were right about Foss.</i>

599
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,087
<i>The man not to be trusted wasn't him.</i>

600
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,270
It was Taylor.
