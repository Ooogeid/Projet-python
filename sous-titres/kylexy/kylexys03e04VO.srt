<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,865
- The thought of you two living together
- It's not like that.

3
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:09,759
She needs a place to live, a family.

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,345
- I know, but...
- You're the only one for me.

5
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:14,518
- I never caught your name.
- Jessi.

6
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:15,552
I'm Cassidy.

7
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:17,953
I've counseled a lot of
teenagers over the years.

8
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:19,810
I have never given up on any of them.

9
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,520
I'm not giving up on you.

10
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,190
I heard you've been spending
time with Lori Trager.

11
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,703
- We're just hanging out.
- Not anymore.

12
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,444
There you are.

13
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,379
- I don't know how to say this.
- Mark told me he won't date me

14
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:33,699
- because he's afraid for his future.
- Good. He should be.

15
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,826
Why do you get to decide who
I can go out with?

16
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,970
Because I'm your father
and you live in my house.

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,410
I thought you'd be with Andi.

18
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,791
Her mom extended their vacation
rental another 3 weeks.

19
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,567
I just really miss her.

20
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,586
With Kyle I'm just a sidekick.

21
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:49,838
But out here I'd sink 'em half
the time with my eyes closed.

22
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,944
What did you do to Amanda?
You put something in her head.

23
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:55,137
We might be able to disintegrate it.
I'd like to help.

24
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,632
- You've done enough.
- Kyle, that's it.

25
00:00:59,132 --> 00:01:02,728
Pass the electricity through
a kiss. You'll have to practice.

26
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:05,439
- Are you ready?
- Just try to be gentle.

27
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:11,362
- Amanda, let me explain.
- You are always trying to explain.

28
00:01:11,565 --> 00:01:14,104
But there is no explanation
for why you were kissing Jessi!

29
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:16,494
I can feel what's happening
between you two.

30
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,195
But I can't be with you when I know
I'm losing you to someone else.

31
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:22,873
- You can never lose me.
- I already have.

32
00:01:29,196 --> 00:01:30,780
<i>The call it heartache,</i>

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,475
<i>a hurt so profound
it becomes hard to breathe.</i>

34
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:35,389
<i>I had never felt it before,</i>

35
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:36,657
<i>and I wondered,</i>

36
00:01:36,757 --> 00:01:38,276
<i>will it ever go away?</i>

37
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,651
I know you're hurting over Amanda.

38
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:47,861
But you have to stop obsessing.

39
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:50,109
And I have just the distraction.

40
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:54,386
The allure of a new woman.

41
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:57,575
See? Many new women.

42
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,412
Two dimensional, yes,
but still satisfying.

43
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:03,344
It's a safe, easy escape
with someone you love.

44
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:05,147
You!

45
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:10,098
Let music be your relief,
your way out.

46
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:13,023
You're wallowing in sorrow,
you're depressed.

47
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:15,259
You're pining.
You need A minor.

48
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:20,526
Come on, now.
With more feeling. Commit.

49
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:24,793
Great.

50
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,365
Trust me, you're not
the first guy to get dumped.

51
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,073
Think of it as a rite of passage.

52
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:33,360
Mine was tenth grade,
Beth Ann Johnson.

53
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:36,052
Beautiful, adventurous, a gymnast.

54
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:37,562
Deadly.

55
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:39,755
Stick with me, now.

56
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:47,994
I'm ready.

57
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:50,815
What are you doing?

58
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:52,901
Wiping Amanda from Kyle's memory.

59
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:56,325
Could you give us a minute?

60
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:58,969
- But I'm all charged up.
- Jessi, please.

61
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,745
Fine. I'll just go
zap someone else, then.

62
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,002
I'm kidding.

63
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,738
She is kidding, right?

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,974
What you're going through takes time.

65
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:22,409
But it will take even longer

66
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,730
the more you lay around here
and feel sorry for yourself.

67
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,325
It's time to get up, or man up,
whatever the phrase is these days.

68
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:31,362
- Man up?
- Out of the tub. Now.

69
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:37,260
Either that or fill it with soap
and water because you stink.

70
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:39,606
Come on.

- We should go.
- Sit.

76
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,246
I thought Amanda
didn't work on Fridays.

77
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:29,671
You know her schedule?

78
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,369
That's so co-dependent.

79
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:35,624
I've been reading
some of Nicole's books.

80
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:38,903
Like it or not, you're gonna see her.
She lives next door,

81
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,481
so get used to it.

82
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:44,354
- If you want my advice...
- We don't.

83
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:48,270
I can't believe
he came in here with her.

84
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,550
- Who?
- Please. I saw your jaw clinch.

85
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:54,613
By the way, don't grind or
you'll get really bad TMJ

86
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:57,375
and have to eat creamed spinach
the rest of your life.

87
00:04:57,656 --> 00:05:01,124
- Do they look like a couple?
- Pumpkin, don't torture yourself.

88
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,721
Just look over there and tell me.

89
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:08,249
I see a decided lack
of chemistry.

90
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,284
Nothing like what
Ky-manda exuded.

91
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:16,062
- She just looked over here.
- She did?

92
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:18,346
Don't look back. She'll see you.

93
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,820
- Where should I look?
- Anywhere. Here, look at me.

94
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,692
Yeah. Yeah, look deep into
Trager's eyes.

95
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:26,237
That's not weird.

96
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:28,248
Kyle, look at me.

97
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:34,559
I don't think that's a good idea.
As a matter of fact,

98
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,189
maybe you shouldn't be
sitting next to me.

99
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:40,451
Maybe I should just sit
at another table.

100
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:44,026
I'll make it easier for you.

101
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:45,226
Jessi, wait.

102
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:53,310
Feeling better?

103
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:06,115
Are you using your car?

104
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,736
What? I couldn't hear you.

105
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:11,078
Could I borrow your car, please?

106
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:12,612
For?

107
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:15,118
I want to go out.

108
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:16,729
Where to?

109
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:18,877
I'm not sure.

110
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,665
What, you just gonna
drive around aimlessly?

111
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:24,680
Can I borrow your car or not?

112
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,676
Josh has it.

113
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,595
Josh has the car?
Josh has a car.

114
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,433
His radiator's busted
so he took mine.

115
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,403
You couldn't just say that
in the first place?

116
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:35,130
And be straight with you? Like
you were when you went to see Mark?

117
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,162
Passive-aggressive
doesn't really suit you.

118
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:40,394
- You lied to me, Lori.
- You gave me a good reason to.

119
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:53,557
Jessi, is that you?

120
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:58,890
Come on in.
I was just looking at these colors.

121
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,289
Any preferences?

122
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:04,029
For the walls.
Any preferences?

123
00:07:05,702 --> 00:07:07,898
Not really.
Any color's fine.

124
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:10,322
It's gonna be your room.

125
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:12,097
I want you to feel comfortable.

126
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,810
Something bothering you?

127
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:20,481
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:23,400
- I shouldn't...
- Why are you sorry?

129
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:24,644
Habit.

130
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,529
Being in this room, I guess,
trying to get people to open up.

131
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,825
Just know you can talk to me
whenever you want to.

132
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:34,673
In this room or not in this room.

133
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:49,797
- I feel...
- That daughter of yours!

134
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:55,336
This green's fine.

135
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:08,014
- I should talk to her.
- Bad idea.

136
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:11,031
- I could explain.
- What? Why you kissed another girl?

137
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,605
Right in front of her?
You can't take that back.

138
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:16,036
You're finished, Kyle.
It's over.

139
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:18,700
Way to lift his spirits, dude.

140
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,490
Come on.
We're getting out of here.

141
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,309
- Where are we going?
- I've got just the cure.

142
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:36,974
Good magazine?

143
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:39,700
If by good you mean
trashy and trivial and

144
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,855
completely devoid of journalistic
value, then yes, it's fantastic.

145
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:45,250
I'll leave you alone.

146
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:46,492
Wait.

147
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:48,938
You don't have to.
It's not you.

148
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:50,112
Who is it?

149
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,903
My father. He's unbelievable.

150
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:55,345
He's got this bug up his ass
about Mark.

151
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:56,510
A bug?

152
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:00,993
He's pulling this big
power trip on me.

153
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:04,026
And now I am stuck here,

154
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:05,287
carless

155
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:07,418
with no place to go.

156
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:09,482
I wish I had a place of my own.

157
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,382
I do.

158
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:14,382
The apartment.
I still have the keys.

159
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,748
What are we waiting for?

160
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,807
There's really nothing
to do there.

161
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,150
It doesn't matter.
It's not here.

162
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,624
Are you coming?

163
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:45,276
Is this spot OK?

164
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,333
It's fine.
I parked here a million times.

165
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:48,641
Where are we?

166
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:51,089
Kyle, my friend,
we're at a Seattle landmark.

167
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,132
Little-known watering hole,
tradition passed on from generation

168
00:09:54,232 --> 00:09:56,452
- to generation of teenagers.
- What is it?

169
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:58,660
A bar that doesn't check IDs.

170
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:00,598
Isn't that illegal?

171
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:02,998
Tonight isn't about technicalities.

172
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:04,550
It's about letting loose,

173
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,232
it's about seeing how much fun
life can be post-Amanda.

174
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:08,990
So, why are we at a bar?

175
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:17,167
You don't even have cable ?

176
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,558
I told you
there's nothing to do here.

177
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,528
Hi, Jessi. How are you ?

178
00:10:24,118 --> 00:10:25,559
How are you doing ?

179
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,086
What are you two ladies
up to this evening ?

180
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:32,815
What did you have in mind ?

181
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,759
I was gonna go meet a friend
for coffee. Any suggestions ?

182
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,821
Try the Rack.

183
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:40,351
God, no.
It's totally lame.

184
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,515
Check out.

185
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:45,143
Actually, their lattes are amazing.

186
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:49,018
Well, we have to go.

187
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:51,656
Cool. Maybe I'll see you later ?

188
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,026
Maybe.

189
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:00,197
What's the matter with you ?

190
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:02,765
Ladies, looking good.

191
00:11:03,524 --> 00:11:05,602
You want to take it down a notch ?

192
00:11:06,742 --> 00:11:07,726
Ladies.

193
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,175
That girl keeps smiling at me.

194
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:27,008
- She likes you, dude.
- She doesn't even know me.

195
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:28,640
She feels the heat.

196
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,619
See ? Everyone's having
a great time.

197
00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:41,356
I don't think so, little man.

198
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:43,853
- You're kidding me, right ?
- Your dad would kill me.

199
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,957
You're our designated driver.

200
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:47,195
This sucks.

201
00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:48,869
What are you doing ?

202
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,071
I just...

203
00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:53,045
Are you calling Amanda ?

204
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:57,341
Dude, you're missing the point.
Forget Amanda.

205
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,411
Forget her ?

206
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:01,050
Dude, you've been in that room
for days. You've got tub sores.

207
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,528
You're in pain.
Forgetting her is a good thing.

208
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:05,126
This will help.

209
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:06,964
Wait.

210
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:09,477
I tried that once
and I did not like it.

211
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:11,468
You didn't do it right.

212
00:12:11,568 --> 00:12:13,260
Just do it. Come on.

213
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,429
And the wife says,
"That's not a pig."

214
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,279
And the guy says,
"I wasn't talking to you."

215
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,543
I don't get it.

216
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,631
What are you talking about, man ?
It's ingenious.

217
00:12:45,703 --> 00:12:48,767
- What ?
- Everything is vibrating or something.

218
00:12:49,595 --> 00:12:51,096
- Really ?
- Yes.

219
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,146
I feel a distinct hum.

220
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:55,563
- Dude, you're buzzed.
- Buzzed ?

221
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:58,025
Alcohol's kicking in.

222
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,129
I'm buzzed.

223
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:07,973
This is cool. Just us guys,
bonding over lady trouble.

224
00:13:08,073 --> 00:13:09,746
What kind of lady trouble
do you have ?

225
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:12,003
Dude, Andy's been out of town
for two weeks.

226
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:14,282
And when she's here
she can be a real ball buster.

227
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:16,905
Talking about ball buster,
try your sister.

228
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,387
Please. I've had to live
with that for 16 years.

229
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,758
Why would you ever
be with her by choice ?

230
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:24,553
Her dining habits alone.
The way she slurps...

231
00:13:26,086 --> 00:13:27,555
You ever watch Hilary eat ?

232
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:31,163
Tiny nibbles. She, like,
flosses after every bite.

233
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:36,783
Andy doesn't wear deodorant.

234
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,317
There. I said it.

235
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,515
What do you have on Amanda ?

236
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,791
I haven't thought about Amanda
for 6 minutes and 14 seconds.

237
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,753
It's working !

238
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:06,692
<i>They called it male bonding.</i>

239
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,764
<i>An exercise in forgetting our problems.</i>

240
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,392
<i>And the girls
who had caused them.</i>

241
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,242
<i>I wasn't sure why I had to drink myself
full of chemicals to achieve it,</i>

242
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:19,154
<i>but they clearly felt
like I needed the help.</i>

243
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,202
Dude, the head.

244
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:32,077
The head ?

245
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:33,803
I love you guys.

246
00:14:34,628 --> 00:14:35,990
I love you, too.

247
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:39,543
No, you gotta add the guys, man.

248
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,296
Guys.

249
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:44,090
I love you.

250
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:49,142
Ladies.

251
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,650
I'm drinking
to forget my girlfriend.

252
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:02,261
Come on, it'll be fun.

253
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,741
Oh, my god.
And that British accent.

254
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,351
He was totally laying on the charm.
How could you not be into him ?

255
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,285
- Isn't he too old ?
- Good old, not gross old.

256
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:18,771
Popcorn.

257
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:21,737
Jessi, there is a foreign hottie out
there who seems really into you.

258
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,634
So ?

259
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:25,237
Do something about it.
You're available.

260
00:15:26,853 --> 00:15:27,721
I guess.

261
00:15:27,821 --> 00:15:30,772
You guess ? Is there a romantic
interest I'm not aware of ?

262
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,021
Only Kyle.

263
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:37,143
Rewind. Kyle ?

264
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:40,021
- Is that a problem ?
- Huge.

265
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,173
Here we go.

266
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:29,282
I think we should
get Kyle out of here.

267
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:31,780
- He's fine.
- People are starting to stare.

268
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,825
Now I'm making some serious dime.

269
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,210
OK, do you want
to win your money back ?

270
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,845
Nothing or double.

271
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:40,315
Double or nothing.

272
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:41,789
That's what I said.

273
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:46,122
See this glass ?
Somebody over there, catch.

274
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,424
Put that glass onto the bar.

275
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:53,925
I'm going to bounce this quarter

276
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:56,754
off of this table,
onto the countertop,

277
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:58,931
off of that neon sign,

278
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:03,438
off of that hanging light
and skipping it off the handle there.

279
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,939
- Beer tap.
- Beer tap.

280
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:07,050
Thank you.

281
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,345
And into the glass.

282
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,662
- I'll take that bet.
- You will lose.

283
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:12,656
Sir.

284
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,755
Just do it.

285
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:30,730
Pay up.

286
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,688
Thank you, gentlemen.

287
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,729
I've enjoyed bonding with you.

288
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:39,910
I love you.

289
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,972
How long have you been
into Kyle ?

290
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,362
I guess I've always felt
a special connection.

291
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:50,885
Aren't you guys like,
brother and sister ?

292
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:51,792
No.

293
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:53,915
But you guys both have the same

294
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:55,824
you know, no belly button thing.

295
00:17:57,178 --> 00:17:58,993
That doesn't mean we're related.

296
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:00,998
You sure seem like you are.

297
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:02,602
No, it's...

298
00:18:03,235 --> 00:18:05,523
more like we're from
the same village.

299
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:07,712
Is everybody
in a small town related ?

300
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:09,779
In some parts of the country.

301
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,648
Look, I can't help it if I think
Kyle and I are soul mates.

302
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:15,896
- I just do.
- Soul mates ?

303
00:18:16,118 --> 00:18:18,057
Does Kyle know about any of this ?

304
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:20,145
He's never said anything.

305
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,500
But I think he feels the same way.

306
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:24,757
Or he will eventually.

307
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:28,499
Jessi, Kyle is totally,
hopelessly in love with Amanda.

308
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,195
But they broke up.

309
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:32,218
That doesn't mean
he's not still hung up on her.

310
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:34,978
You saw him. He's been mired
in Wallowtown for days.

311
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:36,741
Well, when will that end ?

312
00:18:37,526 --> 00:18:39,576
There's no exact time.

313
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:43,246
It could take months, years,
forever to get over someone.

314
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:48,849
Meanwhile, there's an exciting
international man of mystery

315
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:51,250
who wants to have coffee
with you at the Rack.

316
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:55,002
Well, what about you ?

317
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:57,774
What about me ?
I'll be fine.

318
00:18:58,376 --> 00:19:00,661
Hot older guys
always have hot older friends.

319
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:04,379
Watch this.

320
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,494
Do you have one of those
clappers like they sell on TV ?

321
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,286
Kyle, you really
shouldn't do that.

322
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:27,571
Mr. Grumpy.

323
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:29,459
Please don't do that.

324
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,424
What else can you do ?

325
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,817
Well...

326
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:47,018
Not good.
This is not good.

327
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:50,007
Where the hell is Declan ?

328
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,943
You're like,
a magician or something.

329
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:57,336
Nope. I was born in a pod.

330
00:19:57,636 --> 00:19:59,453
I'm a science experiment.

331
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:07,724
You're funny.

332
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:14,001
- Whoa. You're bald.
- Josh, do you mind ?

333
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:16,503
- We gotta get Kyle out of here.
- Not now.

334
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:18,650
Hello.

335
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,844
My name is Kyle

336
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:25,164
and I am the result
of a science experiment.

337
00:20:27,472 --> 00:20:28,518
Hang on.

338
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:34,903
It's Tom Foss.

339
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,651
- Hello, Foss.
- Kyle, I've been trying to call you.

340
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:41,878
You've been trying
to call me what ?

341
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,457
Are you drunk ?

342
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:49,022
Maybe.

343
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:52,020
- Yes.
- Kyle, listen to me.

344
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:53,622
Not now.

345
00:20:57,402 --> 00:20:59,088
I just hung up on Foss.

346
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,018
Anyway, what was I saying ?

347
00:21:01,118 --> 00:21:03,928
So, Latnok took an embryo

348
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:08,141
and put it in a pod with
all these X and Y chromosomes,

349
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,824
which is why
there's no umbilical cord.

350
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,439
Yes !

351
00:21:14,717 --> 00:21:15,899
That is my name !

352
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,942
- Gotta stop, buddy.
- No.

353
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:21,297
I cannot stop.

354
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:23,190
Because I'm Kyle.

355
00:21:23,698 --> 00:21:25,491
I'm Kyle XY.

356
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,954
Now can we leave ?

357
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,364
This is a disaster.

358
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,317
Everything's gonna be fine.

359
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,814
Bringing Kyle home like this isn't fine.

360
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:44,184
Kyle, are you OK?

361
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:47,805
Can't you do something like,
I don't know, alter the polarity

362
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,743
of your liver to process
the alcohol or something?

363
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,028
I can't believe
you did this to him.

364
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:55,910
Me? You were into this too
until I cut you off.

365
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,323
About that. I think I
have ginger ale poisoning.

366
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,330
No way.

367
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:09,506
Please tell me
we parked someplace else.

368
00:22:10,486 --> 00:22:15,434
<i>You lifted me
so I could reach the peaks

369
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:20,838
<i>You made me drink
so I could hardly speak

370
00:22:21,855 --> 00:22:23,506
What can I get for you?

371
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:25,900
I hear your lattes are exceptional.

372
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:28,543
I wouldn't go that far,
but they don't disappoint.

373
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:30,885
I'll have one of them, then.
Nonfat.

374
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,768
Sorry. Have we met?

375
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:37,174
I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

376
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,380
One latte, nonfat.

377
00:22:46,144 --> 00:22:48,795
- I'm Lori, by the way.
- Michael Cassidy.

378
00:22:49,354 --> 00:22:51,107
- Here's my friend.
- A friend. 

379
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:53,467
- I want you to meet him.
- Absolutely.

380
00:23:12,912 --> 00:23:14,179
Thanks for the ride.

381
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,292
<i>No problem.</i>

382
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:19,522
Thank you.

383
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:23,457
Man. Now my butt smells
like cabbage.

384
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:24,903
What else is new?

385
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:30,278
The window.

386
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,459
Hey, man, our car got towed
in front of the Wild Coyote.

387
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:41,127
It's my dad's SUV.

388
00:23:42,158 --> 00:23:44,261
Your have daddy's car towed.

389
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:47,725
You guys might lose your Xbox
for a few days.

390
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,638
I need to see your driver's
license and your registration.

391
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:53,890
The registration's in the car.

392
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,834
- That's a problem, isn't it?
- Come on, man.

393
00:23:58,226 --> 00:23:59,204
Do you...

394
00:23:59,677 --> 00:24:03,248
understand the absurdity
of the conundrum that you presented?

395
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:05,207
How is that?

396
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:07,258
You asked us to show you

397
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,721
our registration to retrieve our car.

398
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:12,381
But our car

399
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,761
is locked behind a fence

400
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:17,245
that you won't let us get to.

401
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:20,374
That is incredibly stupid.

402
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:22,788
Are you calling me stupid?

403
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:24,122
No, sir.

404
00:24:24,392 --> 00:24:25,677
Not at all.

405
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:30,118
Can we just work something out,
or...

406
00:24:32,227 --> 00:24:34,314
Sure. I'll tell you what.

407
00:24:34,803 --> 00:24:38,048
You give me 200 bucks, I'll let you
go back and get your registration.

408
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:41,593
See, yeah, I don't...
I don't have $200 on me.

409
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:45,316
Well, you know, I guess
you're gonna have to call Daddy.

410
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:51,030
You're good boys, aren't you?

411
00:24:55,016 --> 00:24:56,707
What the hell are you doing?

412
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,657
Why would you invite Lori Trager
here if you knew you were meeting me?

413
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:03,407
I don't see the problem.
Is there a problem?

414
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:05,083
You told me not to see her.

415
00:25:05,183 --> 00:25:06,660
Change of plans.

416
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,465
- A change of plans?
- I changed my mind.

417
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:12,195
I thought you'd be happy about it.

418
00:25:18,122 --> 00:25:19,165
Whatever.

419
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,252
- Are you purging?
- Yeah.

420
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:29,880
I just tossing out everything
dated last century.

421
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,783
So you realize
all the kids are out?

422
00:25:35,227 --> 00:25:36,624
I want to finish.

423
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:38,433
Are you mad at me?

424
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,532
Just busy.

425
00:25:43,163 --> 00:25:44,667
You are mad at me.

426
00:25:45,094 --> 00:25:45,960
Why?

427
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:50,067
I'm not mad.

428
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:51,433
It's just...

429
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:53,634
here I was,
trying to reach out to Jessi,

430
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,553
something I rarely
get a chance to do.

431
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,119
And you barge in here
with the same nonsense

432
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:00,933
about Lori and her bad attitude
or whatever it is you call it.

433
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,871
- She lied to me.
- I know that.

434
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:05,605
But there was no good reason
for you to object to her seeing Mark.

435
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,548
- Mark's two years older.
- You're four years older than me.

436
00:26:08,648 --> 00:26:10,518
She's in high school
and he's in college.

437
00:26:10,618 --> 00:26:12,554
He's smart, he's responsible.

438
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,980
The kind of boy
we want her to be with.

439
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,489
But you laid down the law
and she broke it.

440
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:19,702
- So you got all puffed up.
- Puffed up?

441
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:22,935
She didn't do what
you wanted her to do,

442
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:24,738
and your ego took a hit.

443
00:26:25,136 --> 00:26:26,042
Is that all?

444
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:28,103
That's all.

445
00:26:43,456 --> 00:26:44,714
Almost there.

446
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:46,520
Why are we doing this again?

447
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,920
To get your registration from the car.

448
00:26:54,985 --> 00:26:56,185
Am I bleeding?

449
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,349
Your turn.

450
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,694
- Show off.
- Just look for the car.

451
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:21,507
I can't believe we're doing
this. This is all..,

452
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:24,789
My fault. Acknowledged. I was just
trying to make Kyle feel better.

453
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:27,437
I don't. I feel terrible.

454
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:30,439
- It'll pass.
- I don't feel better about anything.

455
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,139
Are You gonna start in on me too?

456
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:34,318
You should have let me call
Amanda when I wanted.

457
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,727
Fine. You know what? Go ahead,
call her. Beg for forgiveness.

458
00:27:37,827 --> 00:27:40,230
You'll probably pull it off,
too, 'cause you're Kyle.

459
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,177
Perfect Kyle. You always know
just what to do.

460
00:27:44,692 --> 00:27:47,129
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

461
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:48,764
I feel sick.

462
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,043
Don't leave me, buddy. Come on.

463
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,388
I feel really sick.

464
00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:58,013
Holy crap.

465
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,623
What did you do?

466
00:28:00,568 --> 00:28:04,328
I altered the polarity of my liver
to return my body to homeostasis.

467
00:28:04,428 --> 00:28:05,847
That's what I said.

468
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:13,410
- You stole the car?
- It's your car. Get in.

469
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,810
- Get out!
- What?

470
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,326
You're drunk. I'm not getting in
the car with you. Get in back.

471
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:20,573
- Stay where you are!
- We're all gonna die.

472
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,532
Get back here!

473
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,546
Great. Just great.

474
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:46,118
At least I got your car back.

475
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:48,272
You've been really awesome
tonight. Thank you.

476
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:50,728
It's just a flat tire.
We can fix it.

477
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:54,002
Kyle can twitch his nose
or channel his chi or something.

478
00:28:54,102 --> 00:28:57,276
We all know you're the man.
You're the savior. I'm the screw up.

479
00:28:57,571 --> 00:29:00,214
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

480
00:29:00,785 --> 00:29:02,365
Just... Just fix it.

481
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:05,785
I will.

482
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:15,218
What's taking so long, huh?
Come on, work your magic.

483
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:18,798
- Why are you acting like this?
- You got a problem?

484
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:19,993
Stop.

485
00:29:23,535 --> 00:29:24,474
Come on.

486
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:31,074
You guys should be looking after
me, not the other way around.

487
00:29:31,174 --> 00:29:33,791
This is crazy.
I'm the sober one.

488
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:37,148
I'm the designated driver.
I'm refereeing the fight.

489
00:29:37,585 --> 00:29:39,693
And giving girl advice.

490
00:29:40,594 --> 00:29:43,522
When you think about it,
I'm the only one with a

491
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:45,984
successful, functioning relationship.

492
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:49,314
What am I doing with
you two losers?

493
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,539
So, what are you doing
with your life now?

494
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,964
Are you going to college
or you working?

495
00:29:54,064 --> 00:29:55,570
I'm not that old.

496
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:57,920
You are very mature.

497
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,258
I've had to learn quickly.

498
00:30:02,358 --> 00:30:03,300
It shows.

499
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,515
I haven't seen you
around the apartment.

500
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,110
My mother...

501
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:10,756
she left.

502
00:30:11,046 --> 00:30:12,309
She left me.

503
00:30:12,842 --> 00:30:13,811
I'm sorry.

504
00:30:15,403 --> 00:30:16,770
I'm all right.

505
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:19,001
It's OK if you're not.

506
00:30:21,097 --> 00:30:22,278
You will be.

507
00:30:25,518 --> 00:30:26,901
- Let me explain.
- What?

508
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:28,823
How you like jerking girls around?

509
00:30:28,923 --> 00:30:31,623
Becaue, one minute you're into me,
then suddenly you're not.

510
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:34,135
We play the whole
"accidental run-in thing."

511
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:36,411
And then you gave me a kiss,
which from my vantage point

512
00:30:36,511 --> 00:30:37,935
you seemed to like a whole lot.

513
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:40,680
And then, boom, suddenly
you don't want to defy my father

514
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,609
or jeopardize your future
or some other lame-ass excuse.

515
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,759
- But it's...
- Let me finish.

516
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:48,524
I thought we had something,

517
00:30:48,624 --> 00:30:50,970
but clearly you don't.
And the least you could have done

518
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,903
was been man enough to be honest.

519
00:30:53,003 --> 00:30:54,004
Excuse me.

520
00:31:23,377 --> 00:31:24,817
Did I do something?

521
00:31:28,074 --> 00:31:29,600
Why are you so angry?

522
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,105
If you ask me,
he's still hung up on Lori.

523
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:35,940
It's not about Lori or Hilary.
It's not about girls at all.

524
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:38,771
- You're not, uh...
- It's about my ankle, you idiot!

525
00:31:42,128 --> 00:31:44,440
I went to see a specialist
the other day.

526
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:46,213
Top foot guy around.

527
00:31:46,642 --> 00:31:48,573
Treats the Seahawks
and the Sonics.

528
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:52,117
Turns out there's
this little bone.

529
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:54,491
Talus or something.

530
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:56,883
Anyway,

531
00:31:57,852 --> 00:32:00,801
mine's been fractured
for like, years, he said.

532
00:32:02,218 --> 00:32:04,347
Maybe if they would
have caught it...

533
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,929
They didn't.

534
00:32:10,668 --> 00:32:12,606
So I've been playing on it.

535
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,848
Never healed right.

536
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:17,720
What about the surgery
you had before?

537
00:32:18,663 --> 00:32:22,126
It's a different part of the ankle.
Just one of those things.

538
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:25,951
Diminished function,
I think they call it.

539
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:30,406
Basketball's history.

540
00:32:33,448 --> 00:32:37,881
I should have cracked a book
once in a while, I guess.

541
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,789
I'll uh, get the spare.

542
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,890
- Are you in pain?
- Some.

543
00:32:54,488 --> 00:32:56,674
Is that why you wanted
to get drunk tonight?

544
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,921
To forget?

545
00:32:59,138 --> 00:33:00,436
Maybe, yeah.

546
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:08,068
You step up and face your problems,

547
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,183
but me, I run away.

548
00:33:11,963 --> 00:33:14,575
For once I guess
I wanted you to do the same.

549
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,787
When I saw you like that tonight,

550
00:33:21,524 --> 00:33:23,875
it made me feel so bad
about my life.

551
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,813
I understand.

552
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:33,613
Guys, I don't think
we have a spare.

553
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,181
Your father drives around
without a spare?

554
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:38,466
Guess so.

555
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,910
Now I've got to call him.

556
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:43,683
What am I supposed to say?

557
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:47,106
"Hey, Dad!
You want to come pick us up?

558
00:33:47,312 --> 00:33:49,817
We just did some serious
underage drinking.

559
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:52,541
And then, after Kyle's
humongous ralph,

560
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:55,699
we shredded the back tire
breaking out of an impound lot."

561
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:09,561
Thanks for driving, by the way.

562
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,924
You should have seen this guy
back at the bar.

563
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:20,140
- He picked up a bald chick.
- You did?

564
00:34:21,786 --> 00:34:24,215
She wasn't bald.
Her head was shaved.

565
00:34:24,315 --> 00:34:25,524
There's a difference.

566
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,981
Cue ball.

567
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:30,535
I don't really remember that much.

568
00:34:31,576 --> 00:34:32,403
You don't?

569
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,365
Why? Did I do something?

570
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:39,958
Nothing, really.

571
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:46,568
Gentlemen, our luck
is about to change.

572
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:14,778
Now you are gonna pay for what
you did back there, boy.

573
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:18,091
I'd like to. Eighty-five dollars
for the impound fee

574
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:20,397
and whatever
it costs to fix the fence.

575
00:35:22,181 --> 00:35:23,579
I don't want your money.

576
00:35:33,009 --> 00:35:34,236
What the hell are you?

577
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,071
All right. Keep it.

578
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:41,988
I got something better.

579
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:09,542
I don't like that she lied.

580
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,460
I don't either.

581
00:36:13,078 --> 00:36:17,262
But I guess my
ego did come into play.

582
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:22,262
- But I didn't get all puffed up.
- How about slightly inflated?

583
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:27,601
I'm sorry I interrupted you
and Jessi earlier.

584
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,013
I'll get another chance.

585
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,941
I'll tell Lori
it's OK to see Mark.

586
00:36:38,558 --> 00:36:40,405
I just hope it's not too late.

587
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,568
I knew Jessi was good
for something.

588
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:06,314
Mother relationships
are a tricky business.

589
00:37:06,414 --> 00:37:07,665
Believe me, I know.

590
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:09,728
Did yours leave, too?

591
00:37:11,486 --> 00:37:13,548
Maybe I'll tell you
more about it someday

592
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,012
when I know you better.

593
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:18,007
We're supposed to be closed.
Is there anything else?

594
00:37:18,107 --> 00:37:19,278
Oh. Sorry, love.

595
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,169
Here you go.

596
00:37:30,352 --> 00:37:32,269
She's a bit icy, isn't she?

597
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,501
I kissed her boyfriend.

598
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,537
Oh, really?

599
00:37:37,094 --> 00:37:39,238
We always had
a special connection.

600
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:43,010
- You and her boyfriend.
- Yeah.

601
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,519
It's hard to explain.
But it's there.

602
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:49,306
It's like we speak
the same language,

603
00:37:49,406 --> 00:37:50,767
have the same thoughts.

604
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,808
That is a rare thing to find.

605
00:37:54,756 --> 00:37:55,756
Yeah, well...

606
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,880
For some reason he thinks
he's meant to be with Amanda.

607
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,771
Have you told this boy
how you feel?

608
00:38:04,225 --> 00:38:05,513
It's complicated.

609
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:08,255
I'm living in the same house now.

610
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:12,520
Listen, Jessi,

611
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,958
you are a very special young lady.

612
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:17,376
You're brilliant,

613
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,422
beautiful, unique,

614
00:38:21,978 --> 00:38:24,978
From what I've seen, that
Amanda girl has nothing on you.

615
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:28,639
And if you really do sense that
special bond between you and Kyle,

616
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,401
you should act on it.

617
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:32,728
How did you know his name?

618
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,895
I never mentioned it.

619
00:38:37,913 --> 00:38:41,599
There's a lot of things
I know about you, Jessi.

620
00:38:43,152 --> 00:38:44,802
A lot more than you think.

621
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,855
And many that you don't know
about me.

622
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,160
I don't understand.

623
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:53,185
I think it's time I explained.

624
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,584
Man, I feel like I've been hit
by a truck.

625
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,151
Me, too and I didn't even drink.

626
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,945
Is Amanda's light still on?

627
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:11,974
I can't help it.

628
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,942
You could always get drunk
every night.

629
00:39:14,828 --> 00:39:17,938
I don't ever want to get drunk
like that again.

630
00:39:18,716 --> 00:39:20,899
I don't want to forget
how much I care about Amanda

631
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,017
and why she's so important to me.

632
00:39:23,757 --> 00:39:25,988
So, you happy being miserable?

633
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:29,390
I'm gonna have to work through it.

634
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:32,369
Nothing I can do or say
is gonna help her understand.

635
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,922
Except the truth.

636
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:37,166
What?

637
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:38,375
Josh is right.

638
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:40,476
Why not tell her everything?

639
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,170
- I can't.
- Why not?

640
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:44,786
- You told us the truth.
- It's not the same.

641
00:39:44,886 --> 00:39:47,308
- Kyle!
- It's totally the same.

642
00:39:47,408 --> 00:39:49,738
- Bro, I don't understand.
- Go for it, man.

643
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:50,985
I can't!

644
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:55,775
It's not the same.

645
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:59,487
Amanda loves me
and if I tell her everything...

646
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,683
I don't want her
to stop loving me.

647
00:40:10,683 --> 00:40:12,214
You've already lost her.

648
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,461
You've got nothing to lose.

649
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:20,399
You know, I rarely agree
with this guy here,

650
00:40:20,872 --> 00:40:22,258
but he's right, Kyle.

651
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:28,925
Nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

652
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:32,956
Seems too easy.

653
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:35,863
Sometimes the best solutions are.

654
00:40:43,095 --> 00:40:44,343
I'm gonna tell her.

655
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:47,611
Dude, you made a breakthrough.

656
00:40:48,302 --> 00:40:50,614
Go now.
Before you lose your nerve.

657
00:40:57,523 --> 00:40:58,622
I love you guys.

658
00:41:01,414 --> 00:41:04,609
<i>After a night of mistakes
and valuable lessons learned,</i>

659
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:06,826
<i>I finally understood male bonding.</i>

660
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:09,331
<i>It's not using your friends
to forget.</i>

661
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,048
<i>It's remembering how lucky
you are to have them.</i>

662
00:41:12,952 --> 00:41:14,275
All right, go.

663
00:41:17,398 --> 00:41:18,213
So.

664
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,988
You can give me a lift home.

665
00:41:23,954 --> 00:41:24,871
Let's go.

666
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:36,868
- Foss, I can't talk right now.
- Kyle!

667
00:41:39,468 --> 00:41:42,036
- I've been trying to reach you.
- I was with my friends.

668
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:43,789
Yeah. Getting drunk!

669
00:41:44,779 --> 00:41:46,552
When I call you it's important.

670
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:49,360
- I'm sorry.
- You answer the phone

671
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,078
- and you stay on it!
- Hey!

672
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,268
I needed you and you were gone.

673
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,880
- There's been a lot going on.
- Listen to me.

674
00:41:57,426 --> 00:41:58,854
- Adam Baylin...
- What?

675
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:03,535
- What about him?
- He's been deteriorating.

676
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:07,545
And I've been moving him
from location to location.

677
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:10,307
- Staying on the run.
- Why?

678
00:42:10,885 --> 00:42:12,070
What's been going on?

679
00:42:17,905 --> 00:42:19,744
- He wanted to see you, Kyle.
- Tell me!

680
00:42:23,556 --> 00:42:24,666
Adam died today.

681
00:42:29,726 --> 00:42:30,865
He died?

682
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:35,343
You may not realize it yet,
but this changes everything.
