1
00:00:00,061 --> 00:00:01,783
Previously on Kyle XY.

2
00:00:01,955 --> 00:00:02,984
Back to normal.

3
00:00:03,064 --> 00:00:03,971
I just hope

4
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:05,459
Kyle is still Kyle.

5
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:06,870
I know you think I'm a bad guy.

6
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,862
This whole thing
with Hillary is just physical.

7
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,120
It has nothing to do
with how much I love Amanda.

8
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:12,999
- You're still together.
- Why not?

9
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:14,533
I've been lying to Lori for months.

10
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:15,723
My grades are screwed.

11
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:16,848
Look me in the eye,

12
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:18,471
and tell me all of it was for nothing.

13
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:19,577
It wasn't for nothing,

14
00:00:19,663 --> 00:00:20,829
and I can't say any more.

15
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:23,355
Zzyzx experimented
with artificial reproduction

16
00:00:23,435 --> 00:00:25,308
and produced two primary assets:

17
00:00:25,394 --> 00:00:26,869
the male called...

18
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:27,896
XY,

19
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:29,743
the second is a female,

20
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:30,789
XX.

21
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:31,984
She apparently escaped.

22
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:33,993
She's fully developed.
Consider her dangerous.

23
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:35,272
- Can't be.
- Who is he?

24
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:36,900
- The other asset.
- XY?

25
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,461
I thought you said he was terminated.

26
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:39,617
I'm going to tell Declan.

27
00:00:39,697 --> 00:00:41,750
- I can explain it to him.
- No, you can't.

28
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,262
I need someone I can talk to.

29
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:44,842
Then you know what, go ahead.

30
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:47,061
Tell 'em everything.
And we'll see how long it takes

31
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:49,317
before somebody catches wind
of who you are

32
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:51,674
and drags you out of there.
Is that what you want?

33
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:06,120
Back to normal,

34
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:09,764
a phrase of such simplicity
it nearly defines itself.

35
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:12,404
The months
that had passed since I'd left

36
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:13,797
had been anything but,

37
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,043
and I was ready for that part of my life

38
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:17,632
to be over.

39
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:19,411
I was going to pursue normalcy as

40
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:21,382
if my life depended on it.

41
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,444
...so you just give the team statistics

42
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:25,107
a value of 2/3x,

43
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:27,784
factor in floor conditions
and several other simple formulas...

44
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:29,226
What's he talking about?

45
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:32,272
The basketball pool at the office.
I have a secret weapon.

46
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:34,020
Stephen, isn't that a little...

47
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:35,237
unfair?

48
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,401
Absolutely.
Brad took the whole thing last year.

49
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:39,417
This year he's going down.

50
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,060
Who's getting death by fork?

51
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:44,457
Declan,

52
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,631
if he's not dead already.
I wouldn't know.

53
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,779
You two still having problems?

54
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,926
If by problems you mean
him not returning my calls

55
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:52,753
all weekend, then yes.

56
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:53,832
I'm over it.

57
00:01:53,912 --> 00:01:56,463
Josh, I need your friend Robby's number.

58
00:01:56,543 --> 00:01:58,287
His mom asked me to volunteer

59
00:01:58,367 --> 00:01:59,970
for the Active Parents Committee.

60
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:01,825
- Oh, really?
- To which you probably said,

61
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:02,994
"No way in hell."

62
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:04,715
What's wrong with a little volunteering?

63
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:05,797
I have the time.

64
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:09,080
Time to contribute
to the social annihilation of your son.

65
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,460
Then it was time well spent.

66
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,861
- May I say something?
- Depends.

67
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,460
Latin, Greek or Arabic?

68
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:17,910
Go ahead.

69
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:20,677
Thank you.

70
00:02:22,029 --> 00:02:23,615
For this. For everything.

71
00:02:25,398 --> 00:02:27,095
You're welcome.

72
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:33,429
So cool.

73
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:38,564
She cleaned up well.

74
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,449
It took some work to get her
to understand the concept of soap.

75
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,347
Does she just sit there all day?

76
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:49,900
Sometimes she sits facing the other way.

77
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:54,789
Can she hear us?

78
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:57,150
The room is completely soundproof.

79
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:01,495
We recovered some of
the hard drives from the explosion

80
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,733
at the former Zzyzx complex.

81
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:05,196
I was right.

82
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,458
The other subject, XY,

83
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:09,854
the boy she drew in the pictures...

84
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,660
he wasn't terminated
like we were led to believe.

85
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:14,587
Why would they lie?

86
00:03:15,116 --> 00:03:16,576
He's something of theirs in his head,

87
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:18,989
something they wouldn't want
to admit was missing.

88
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:20,451
What is it?

89
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:22,087
Your job is to get it back.

90
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,794
Where is he now?
I'll set up a retrieval unit.

91
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:30,475
I wish it was that simple.

92
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:32,504
The last time someone tried
to grab that boy,

93
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,110
an entire complex was firebombed.

94
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:37,458
I'd still like my parking space
in the morning.

95
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,494
Fair enough.

96
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:43,826
Everything you need to know
is in that file.

97
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:47,158
What should I do about the girl?

98
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:51,955
Actually, she makes me nervous
just sitting there.

99
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:55,741
Get her a teddy bear or something.

100

Season 2 Episode 3
- The List Is Life -

103
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:38,511
What's this?

104
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,700
St. Collette,
the patron saint of people...

105
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:43,763
- who have lost a parent.
- people who have lost a parent.

106
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:45,066
You heard.

107
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:46,935
I'm so sorry.

108
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:51,631
I can't take this.

109
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,808
It was my gift for you.

110
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:55,612
Now it's a gift from me.

111
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,636
Everything's gonna be okay.

112
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:17,825
I promise.

113
00:05:33,872 --> 00:05:36,036
Young love makes me want to hurl.

114
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:38,975
I wonder if Dull and Duller
will make Best Couple again this year?

115
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:40,463
For what?

116
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,286
The "Hit List".

117
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:44,757
Everyone votes anonymously
in different categories.

118
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:48,328
You know, things like Biggest
Fashion Don't or Hottest Teacher.

119
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,050
Most in Need of an Enema.

120
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:51,694
- It sounds mean.
- It is.

121
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:53,673
But that doesn't stop
everybody from voting.

122
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,631
Well, why would anyone care?

123
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:57,291
Lesson number one:

124
00:05:57,377 --> 00:05:59,037
The list is life.

125
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:01,526
I don't think I like that.

126
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:03,636
You're telling me. You didn't suffer

127
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:05,669
through last year's humiliation.

128
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,423
- Hillary made the list.
- Yeah.

129
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:10,048
Biggest Sl...

130
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:12,655
Four-letter word rhymes with...

131
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:13,860
"chut. "

132
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,573
I suppose it could be worse.

133
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:19,195
I could have an entire category
named after me.

134
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:21,546
That hairnet...

135
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:23,892
has the Biggest Geekman award
written all over it.

136
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:25,832
Okay, Deichman's got a lock on that.

137
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:27,850
That's why it's named after him.

138
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,972
I don't know, dude.

139
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:31,435
You're sort of giving him
a run for his money.

140
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:33,696
Bana-guava.

141
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:35,000
Hold the wheatgrass.

142
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:40,816
I just got hammered on G-Force.

143
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,206
This guy keeps popping in my game

144
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:43,755
and wiping me out.

145
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:46,223
You're not supposed to spend
your breaks on the Internet.

146
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:48,316
It's, like, against the rules.

147
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,657
Be less cool.
It'll really help your cause.

148
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:54,386
Nice guy.

149
00:06:57,842 --> 00:07:00,387
Why are you eye-stalking those two?

150
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:03,474
I'm gonna tell Amanda the truth.

151
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,883
That's a bad idea with a capital very.

152
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:09,437
Lesson number two:

153
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,626
The messenger always gets shot.

154
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:13,766
Not literally, but...

155
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:15,450
you shouldn't be the one to tell her.

156
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,254
She'll hate you for keeping it
a secret in the first place.

157
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:20,159
It's a no-win situation.

158
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:22,680
You could tell her.

159
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,262
You don't even like her.
And you're the one he cheated with.

160
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:26,444
What's done is done.

161
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,017
There's no need in making a bigger
mess out of things than I already have.

162
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:37,893
I have to go.

163
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:39,676
So soon?

164
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:47,906
Lori's here.

165
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:54,029
I can't talk to her right now.

166
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:09,066
- What's this?
- I found these...

167
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:10,468
in Baylin's files.

168
00:08:10,714 --> 00:08:12,952
I can't just come meet you
whenever you call.

169
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:16,160
- People will start asking questions.
- All these feats... all of them...

170
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,189
were performed by ordinary people.

171
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,709
Kyle, imagine what you could do.

172
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:24,669
Are these real?

173
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,365
There they are.

174
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,524
We need to meet more often and
start exploring your physical limits.

175
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,497
I start school again tomorrow.

176
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,354
Well, then after school.

177
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:37,938
After school, there are clubs,
activities, hanging out.

178
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:39,951
- I was hoping...
- Shouldn't waste your time...

179
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:41,100
hanging out.

180
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:44,727
Kyle, this is what Adam wanted for you.

181
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,502
And we need to see that through.

182
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:51,834
All right?

183
00:08:55,646 --> 00:08:56,863
Now, the basic...

184
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:58,523
principle, obviously,

185
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:00,589
is mind over matter.

186
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:07,324
Hey there.

187
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:09,512
War and Peace.

188
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:12,401
A little light reading.

189
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:24,022
When do you think
you'll start working again?

190
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:25,964
I haven't decided yet.

191
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:33,267
We haven't had
a moment alone in a long time.

192
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:35,690
How you feeling?

193
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:38,358
I think...

194
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,780
I thought it'd be easier
to get back to normal.

195
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:46,632
What you've been through
is anything but normal.

196
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:49,865
It's gonna take some time to adjust.

197
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:51,722
You don't have to rush it.

198
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:55,350
But what if I want to?

199
00:09:57,747 --> 00:09:58,976
Sometimes we...

200
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,362
run away from things as a way of...

201
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:04,472
protecting ourselves
from having to deal with them.

202
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,021
Do you wanna talk about it?

203
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:12,066
How much time do we have?

204
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:13,922
You tell me.

205
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:25,186
I think I'll keep running
a little longer while I figure it out.

206
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,708
As long as you know I'm here
when you're ready.

207
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:34,520
You still have 29,642 words left.

208
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,144
You're not going anywhere.

209
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:47,422
I read the family history.

210
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:50,974
These people seem
to consider him one of their own.

211
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,093
It's gonna be hard
to make him disappear.

212
00:10:53,282 --> 00:10:55,425
Actually, we'd like to get what we need

213
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:57,961
without anyone noticing we were there.

214
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:02,989
I'm not sure that I understand
how that's possible.

215
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:08,041
You know what a firewall is, I assume.

216
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,437
Of course.

217
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:13,117
XY's brain is powerful...

218
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,457
like a computer.

219
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:17,273
He's managed to develop a...

220
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:19,162
mental equivalent of a firewall.

221
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:22,979
It's what prevented Zzyzx
from being able to control him

222
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:25,271
and what will prevent us from...

223
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,630
getting what's inside his head.

224
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:30,643
That's where she comes in.

225
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,645
What, like a mental hacker?

226
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:34,749
In a manner of speaking, yes.

227
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,120
I was joking.

228
00:11:37,427 --> 00:11:39,173
We need what he knows.

229
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:41,719
She's the only one
capable of getting it.

230
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:44,617
How?

231
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:46,876
I mean, he's been living a normal life

232
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,105
in the suburbs. Look at her.

233
00:11:49,972 --> 00:11:52,441
She hardly seems capable
of assimilating.

234
00:11:54,664 --> 00:11:56,186
Just leave that to me.

235
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:12,333
Lori doesn't live here anymore.

236
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:15,502
Where'd she go?

237
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:16,909
To hell.

238
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,922
It has excellent lighting.

239
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:26,733
You're upset about Declan.

240
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:29,767
I don't understand.

241
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:33,059
I knew we were having issues,
but nothing that deserves him

242
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:34,588
ignoring me.

243
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:38,422
I don't know what I did.

244
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:42,710
You didn't do anything.

245
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:44,212
Then what?

246
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,930
You've been talking to him,
you must know something.

247
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:53,441
I think he's just going through
something right now and he's

248
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:55,176
trying to work it out
in his head without

249
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:57,158
bringing the people
he cares about into it.

250
00:12:57,253 --> 00:12:58,413
I'm his girlfriend.

251
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:01,528
He should be able to talk
to me instead of avoiding me.

252
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:03,300
Trust that I could help.

253
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,874
He sucks.

254
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:11,286
- We're gonna be late for school.
- School sucks.

255
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,452
I can't get up.

256
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:15,103
My whole body hurts.

257
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,187
Mind over matter.

258
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:23,415
Use your mind to convince
your body it feels better.

259
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,861
If you believe you don't hurt,

260
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:27,229
you won't.

261
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:29,983
Will that work?

262
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:31,950
For the next five minutes.

263
00:13:36,745 --> 00:13:37,770
Come on.

264
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:39,591
Come on.

265
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,247
- Kyle!
- Hey, man,

266
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:50,098
good to have you back.

267
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:52,719
Where's Amanda?

268
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:55,691
Well, you don't have to worry
about Amanda. She's fine.

269
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:57,392
I don't see it that way.

270
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:01,113
Yeah? Well, how do you see it?

271
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:04,026
You weren't honest with her
when you had the chance.

272
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:06,476
Telling her the truth
would have hurt her.

273
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:08,071
It was a no-win situation.

274
00:14:08,206 --> 00:14:09,490
But right now...

275
00:14:09,736 --> 00:14:12,047
it seems like she's the only one losing.

276
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:34,365
Now that's a well-balanced meal.

277
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:36,918
What the... This is a guys' bathroom.

278
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:38,518
Relax. I have brothers.

279
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:43,291
It's the only place
I can get a good wireless signal.

280
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:44,779
Uh, how about a classroom?

281
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:47,988
Yeah, they're not so into using
class time to play G-Force.

282
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:50,538
I play G-Force.

283
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:53,635
Have you come across
the handle AndyJ yet?

284
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:55,968
- He's ruining me.
- I know.

285
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:58,476
I heard you talk about it at the Rack.

286
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:01,983
Bana-guava, hold the wheatgrass?

287
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:05,530
I order it, like, everyday.

288
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:06,689
Sorry.

289
00:15:07,849 --> 00:15:09,187
No big.

290
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:18,269
Speaking of doing weird things
in weird places,

291
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,150
I'm pretty sure
there's a cafeteria about

292
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,617
a hundred yards from here.

293
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:24,646
- I'm hiding out.
- From?

294
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:27,385
The cafeteria is full of landmines
during "List Season."

295
00:15:27,656 --> 00:15:30,848
I don't wanna be branded
some loser like L.K. Deichman.

296
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:33,739
You'd rather be a loser
who eats lunch in the bathroom.

297
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:35,817
At least I'm in the right bathroom,

298
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:39,923
- Miss whatever-your-name-is.
- It's Andy, actually.

299
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:41,339
Andy Jensen.

300
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:48,451
Or AndyJ to you.

301
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:58,420
Today is your last chance to buy
your tickets to the fifth annual ...

302
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:01,678
Tickets are only ten dollars
at the front office.

303
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,553
- Unbelievable.
- I have the answer.

304
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:09,408
To life? Or to how I'll get my boyfriend
to quit his dump-and-dodge routine?

305
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:11,727
- What are you wearing?
- You like?

306
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:13,292
You look Amish.

307
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:15,773
It's part of my strategy
to avoid the slut vote.

308
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:17,367
I'm also gonna revirginize.

309
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,621
Re-what?

310
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:20,694
Revirginization. Think about it.

311
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:23,422
If it's ours to give away,
then it's ours to take back.

312
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,897
But we worked so hard to get rid of it.

313
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:28,245
My problems began the minute
sex entered the picture.

314
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:30,699
Next thing you know,
I'm the "chut" of the century.

315
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:34,798
And if I had never had sex with Declan,
I wouldn't be in this situation.

316
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:37,485
How does one revirginize?

317
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:41,203
We just agree to it. I mean,
there's this whole ceremonial thingy,

318
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:44,360
but mostly it's just us
deciding that it's true.

319
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:47,593
Mind over matter. If we convince
ourselves it's true, then it is.

320
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:50,925
We'll live our lives not
motivated by boys or sex

321
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,852
or anything to do with boys and sex.

322
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:55,778
In which case,
what do we do with ourselves?

323
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:02,357
I guess we'll have to ask a virgin.

324
00:17:03,262 --> 00:17:05,428
There you are.
I feel like I haven't seen you all day.

325
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:09,577
Look, I'm late for class,
but we need to hang out.

326
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:12,496
I have the bonfire committee at three.
You want to help?

327
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:15,213
I can't after school. I'm sorry.

328
00:17:15,312 --> 00:17:17,181
Bummer. Well, maybe this weekend.

329
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,926
- Bye.
- Bye.

330
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:31,426
Will I see you at the bonfire?

331
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:33,812
Well, Amanda's in charge of it.

332
00:17:33,895 --> 00:17:35,834
Hmm, she'll be busy.

333
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:40,041
Yes, she will.

334
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:41,356
And what will you be?

335
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,245
That depends on you.

336
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:46,213
Well, then I guess anything's possible.

337
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:55,808
What's this?

338
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:57,992
I recommend that you learn it.
All of it.

339
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:00,635
- Who's Jessi Hollander?
- See for yourself.

340
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:07,019
Don't bring me to work if you're just
gonna make me sit here all day.

341
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:08,605
Hello.

342
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,978
- I'm Emily's boss.
- Hi, Jessi.

343
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:13,742
- Her sister.
- Nice to meet you.

344
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:18,193
What did you do to her?

345
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:22,078
Think of it like downloading
a program into a hard drive.

346
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:26,086
Only she's the computer,
and her life is the program.

347
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:28,945
Yesterday she was a non-communicative,

348
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,098
cold-blooded killer with no means which
to live her life outside of that room.

349
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:34,338
Today...

350
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:40,083
she's a young teenaged girl who likes
strawberry ice cream and Avril Lavigne.

351
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:41,782
And what about her memories?

352
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,317
Zzyzx, the guy
that she killed in the woods...

353
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,503
Deleted.

354
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:49,362
Everything she experienced in the first
few days of her life has been erased.

355
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:50,910
How?

356
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:52,730
Ms. Hollander,

357
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:55,345
we're a multi-billion dollar
technological research

358
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,947
and development corporation.

359
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:59,068
We have resources.

360
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:04,279
She thinks that she's my sister.

361
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:06,199
I'm just supposed to live that lie?

362
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:08,633
That's the assignment.

363
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:16,170
What's the next step?

364
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,621
Get her into that family's life.

365
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:24,247
Destabilizing the boy's
support structure will

366
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:26,843
make him more vulnerable...
receptive to her.

367
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:29,987
And she'll just know what to do?

368
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:32,102
She won't know she knows anything.

369
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:35,237
She'll just think that
she's the new girl...

370
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:36,839
hoping to make friends.

371
00:19:38,997 --> 00:19:41,774
I recommend that you take her
for a test drive.

372
00:19:43,113 --> 00:19:44,749
Don't try to make contact.

373
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,780
Just ease her in.

374
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,369
Watch for cracks in the facade.

375
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:58,169
I don't think Adam meant
for us to take these studies literally.

376
00:19:58,249 --> 00:19:59,589
It's basic science.

377
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:01,367
Your body

378
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:03,418
won't feel the burn

379
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:05,326
until it reaches
the temperature of the fire.

380
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,584
So I need to keep
my internal temperature constant.

381
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:11,412
I understand what I'm supposed to do.
I just don't understand why.

382
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,009
This isn't...

383
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:14,657
about walking on coals.

384
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,744
This is about you using your mind to
change the physiology of your body.

385
00:20:21,831 --> 00:20:23,109
You can do it.

386
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,774
Come on.

387
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,495
Focus.

388
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:42,348
Hey! You're on the planning committee?

389
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,895
- Uh, that's sweet.
- Actually, no.

390
00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:47,012
We're here to talk to you.

391
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:48,642
Oh, yeah? About what?

392
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:51,321
Well, we were wondering...

393
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,251
How do I put this?

394
00:20:53,342 --> 00:20:54,825
Let's cut to the chase.

395
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,792
We're revirginizing.

396
00:20:56,997 --> 00:20:59,096
We need to know what
your people do for fun.

397
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:00,429
My people?

398
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,941
Yeah, you know, the pure types.

399
00:21:04,523 --> 00:21:05,777
You're serious?

400
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:07,916
Revirginizing?

401
00:21:08,838 --> 00:21:11,531
We're a little adrift,
socially speaking.

402
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:14,627
Okay, well, uh,

403
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:16,555
it's not that complicated.

404
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,387
For example, the bonfire committee.

405
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,838
Yeah, we're not so much committee folk.

406
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,628
We'll, I guess I can't help you then.

407
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,214
Maybe now's a good time to start?

408
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,573
Yeah, we can be bonfirey.

409
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,062
Okay, well, uh,

410
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:35,993
tiki oiling or barbecue scrubbing?

411
00:21:41,073 --> 00:21:42,659
You go ahead. I'll hold your purse.

412
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:44,319
Go ahead. Go.

413
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:51,608
You made 400 cupcakes for the bonfire?

414
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:53,218
Yeah, well...

415
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:54,960
keeps me busy.

416
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:58,032
I appreciate this new

417
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,779
Martha Stewart universe you've
been inhabiting, but what's going on?

418
00:22:03,428 --> 00:22:04,956
Do you think it would be...

419
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,304
awful if I didn't go back to work?

420
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:10,097
I didn't know that was an option.

421
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,251
I've been waiting to feel ready,

422
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:14,391
but lately I'm starting
to wonder if I ever will.

423
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:16,739
But you love your job.

424
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:18,186
I did.

425
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:20,970
Then I let myself get
too close to a patient

426
00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:23,047
and I nearly fell apart when I lost him.

427
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:24,965
Kyle is not an ordinary patient.

428
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,302
We all fell apart when he left.

429
00:22:27,658 --> 00:22:29,794
If you don't want
to go back to work, that's okay.

430
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:32,724
Things at the company are going well.
We're gonna be just fine.

431
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:35,421
But I hate that you're
doubting yourself.

432
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:37,550
I just don't feel good at it anymore.

433
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:40,293
Why would you say that?

434
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:41,776
With Kyle...

435
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:44,367
I still have a feeling that
something's not right,

436
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,285
but he won't open up to me.

437
00:22:46,371 --> 00:22:47,809
I can't break through.

438
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:55,730
The sex shack.

439
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:58,906
Many a sandy night spent in here.

440
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:00,443
Focus.

441
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:02,676
Why do you guys wanna revirginize?

442
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:05,344
We're trying to make
better life choices.

443
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,201
So you think having sex is a mistake?

444
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:10,179
Why do you ask?

445
00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:11,288
No reason.

446
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:14,780
It's just...

447
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,874
What?

448
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:21,149
Tonight's mine and Charlie's
two-year anniversary...

449
00:23:22,552 --> 00:23:24,261
I don't know.
I thought it might be time.

450
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:25,515
No!

451
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:26,892
I mean...

452
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:29,154
I don't think it's a good idea.

453
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:31,073
Why not? I mean...

454
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:33,811
I know he's not perfect,
but we've been through so much together

455
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:35,573
and he's been so patient.

456
00:23:36,077 --> 00:23:38,008
I feel like I'm finally ready.

457
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:50,529
Major gossip.

458
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:51,875
I don't like gossip.

459
00:23:51,955 --> 00:23:53,628
Well, you're not gonna like this,
either.

460
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:56,550
But I think there's something that
you should know about Amanda.

461
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,717
What are you doing?

462
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:03,864
Where are you going?
We were just starting to make progress.

463
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,721
Sorry. This is important.

464
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:07,258
Wait. Wait!

465
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:11,402
You're letting petty things
compromise your destiny.

466
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,152
What do you mean, my destiny?

467
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:16,422
Like Baylin said...

468
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:19,564
You can change the world.

469
00:24:19,794 --> 00:24:21,758
What if I don't wanna change the world?

470
00:24:22,507 --> 00:24:24,236
What if I just wanna be normal?

471
00:24:24,752 --> 00:24:27,003
The last time we had this conversation,

472
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,413
you made a skylight explode.

473
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:32,084
You're not normal.
You're never gonna be.

474
00:24:32,189 --> 00:24:34,872
I'm not gonna let you ruin
what we're trying to do here.

475
00:24:34,977 --> 00:24:36,296
What you're trying to do.

476
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:38,543
I don't wanna do it anymore.

477
00:24:44,842 --> 00:24:46,976
I'm taking back what's near and dear.

478
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:49,038
Letting go of all I fear.

479
00:24:49,145 --> 00:24:50,956
Holding on with all my might.

480
00:24:51,244 --> 00:24:53,965
Saving myself for prom night. Drink.

481
00:24:55,464 --> 00:24:57,754
- Okay, now we're born-again virgins.
- Yes.

482
00:24:58,366 --> 00:24:59,877
B- A-V. BAVs.

483
00:25:00,842 --> 00:25:02,731
- It's got a ring to it.
- I like it.

484
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,051
Are you appreciating the irony

485
00:25:07,137 --> 00:25:10,645
that we just held our revirginization
ceremony in the sex shack?

486
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:28,450
Is she here?

487
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:32,755
Look at Prince Charming over there.

488
00:25:33,102 --> 00:25:35,344
I'm so glad I never slept with him.

489
00:25:46,603 --> 00:25:48,221
So many new people.

490
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:50,532
You know what to do.

491
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:52,795
Mingle and blend in.

492
00:25:54,576 --> 00:25:56,267
You want me to go with you?

493
00:25:59,832 --> 00:26:02,377
No, I don't need
my big sister glued to my hip.

494
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,524
Have you seen Amanda?

495
00:26:17,861 --> 00:26:19,741
- No.
- McDonough! Let's go.

496
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,799
Come on.

497
00:26:21,672 --> 00:26:23,449
You're still hanging out with Charlie?

498
00:26:23,976 --> 00:26:26,163
I found myself a little
short on friends lately.

499
00:26:27,742 --> 00:26:30,605
I'm worried he's not the kind of person
he's pretending to be.

500
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:32,622
You would know.

501
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:37,742
Kyle, thank God.

502
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,420
All my helpers bailed on me.

503
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:41,975
Sour Patch Kids on me. Hi, Amanda.

504
00:26:42,073 --> 00:26:44,397
I was wondering if
I could tell you about the cash box.

505
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:45,507
Sure.

506
00:26:50,498 --> 00:26:52,318
So when can you break free?

507
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:54,732
You're in a hurry.

508
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:56,546
Yeah.

509
00:26:58,857 --> 00:27:01,003
I'm a couple of other things, as well.

510
00:27:01,778 --> 00:27:03,281
Hmm, I can see that.

511
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:05,657
Yeah.

512
00:27:11,628 --> 00:27:13,175
Just give me five minutes.

513
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:15,297
You promise?

514
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:16,952
Yeah.

515
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:18,608
Okay.

516
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,555
What's that look?

517
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,072
Back in business, huh?

518
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:34,779
Yeah. Yeah, my business, man.

519
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,174
I don't think you're as
careful as you think.

520
00:27:39,696 --> 00:27:41,060
What's that supposed to mean?

521
00:27:41,185 --> 00:27:43,888
It means you better go find
your girlfriend before she isn't.

522
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:52,521
You suck.

523
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,414
- What?
- You heard me.

524
00:27:54,735 --> 00:27:56,733
There's absolutely nothing

525
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:58,569
rational or intelligent or

526
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:00,743
remotely kind about
the way you've been treating me.

527
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,179
- Lori, I...
- Let me finish.

528
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:04,848
I feel hurt

529
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:06,790
and angry and,

530
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:09,074
at the moment, a little drunk, so...

531
00:28:09,877 --> 00:28:12,047
I'm here to tell you that you suck.

532
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:14,417
I know I've been crazy.

533
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:16,655
If I could figure out how to explain it,

534
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:17,733
I would.

535
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:19,983
How can we be together
if you can't talk to me

536
00:28:20,063 --> 00:28:21,902
about what you're going through?

537
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,702
Oh, my God.

538
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:32,647
You wanna break up.

539
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,446
This is a place where the silent
treatment is not gonna fly.

540
00:28:38,557 --> 00:28:41,385
If you wanna break up,
you're going to have to say it.

541
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:51,581
I wanna break up.

542
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,351
And I suppose

543
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,470
a why would be asking too much.

544
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:04,698
I just, um...

545
00:29:06,843 --> 00:29:07,814
I can't.

546
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:12,284
Well, that's great.

547
00:29:12,395 --> 00:29:14,276
Really nice. Really mature.

548
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:17,116
I mean, it doesn't matter anyway.
I've already erased you.

549
00:29:17,227 --> 00:29:18,690
You and me? Done.

550
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:19,858
Never happened.

551
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:37,735
It's going well, right?
People are having fun?

552
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:38,916
Are you?

553
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:40,895
I will now that work's done.

554
00:29:43,028 --> 00:29:45,573
There's something
I was hoping to talk to you about.

555
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,812
What's up?

556
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:53,248
If you knew a secret about somebody,

557
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:56,626
would you tell them even
though it might hurt them?

558
00:29:57,757 --> 00:30:00,862
Is is it something someone told you
never to tell?

559
00:30:01,023 --> 00:30:03,627
No, but they probably
don't wanna hear it from me.

560
00:30:05,564 --> 00:30:08,080
- Kyle, what's this about?
- Amanda,

561
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,924
they're calling
for more sodas over there.

562
00:30:10,514 --> 00:30:11,596
I just...

563
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:13,458
Oh, it never ends.

564
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:15,475
All work and no play.

565
00:30:18,365 --> 00:30:20,136
What the hell do you think you're doing?

566
00:30:20,246 --> 00:30:22,164
I'm being a good friend.
What are you doing?

567
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,560
Don't pull that innocent
stargazer crap with me.

568
00:30:35,646 --> 00:30:37,338
Amanda's the only one who falls for it.

569
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:39,412
Now what the hell
do you think you're doing?

570
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,364
Kyle, look at me.

571
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,714
I'm talking to you.

572
00:31:03,532 --> 00:31:05,602
Oh, hey, sorry.

573
00:31:08,011 --> 00:31:10,196
You know, you ought to be nice.

574
00:31:14,662 --> 00:31:15,937
Out of the way.

575
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:17,047
Jessi, stop!

576
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:18,645
Let go.

577
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,571
It's cool. Go for a walk.

578
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:24,780
What happened?

579
00:31:25,272 --> 00:31:26,856
I don't know. I...

580
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,698
What do you think you're doing?

581
00:31:40,796 --> 00:31:42,846
I'm gonna find Amanda.
I wont let you lie to her;

582
00:31:42,926 --> 00:31:44,128
it's not right.

583
00:31:44,911 --> 00:31:46,083
Oh, right, I forgot.

584
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:48,616
You're the guy who refuses
to throw a punch.

585
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,473
- Tanner, give it a rest.
- Hey, whose side are you on?

586
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:58,698
- No one's.
- Well, then stay the hell out of it.

587
00:32:00,246 --> 00:32:01,269
Fire.

588
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,811
- Somebody...
- Oh, my God!

589
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:09,636
There's a girl in there!

590
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,073
Get help!

591
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,948
Somebody call 911! Help!

592
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:17,709
It's too hot.

593
00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:22,257
Mind over matter.

594
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:26,046
Everything I had walked away from
was right here in front of me.

595
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:28,339
Everything I didn't want to be

596
00:32:28,629 --> 00:32:30,989
was everything I knew exactly how to do.

597
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:39,826
We need help over here!

598
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:53,260
Get down, Kyle! Get down!

599
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,599
She's breathing!

600
00:33:09,527 --> 00:33:11,004
How are you not burned?

601
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:20,980
Go!

602
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:23,109
Get outta here! Run!

603
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,190
How...

604
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,661
Please don't ask me any more questions.

605
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:18,458
Why?

606
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:25,674
Because you'll want to know
why I can do what I can do and

607
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,780
I won't be able
to explain it to you because...

608
00:34:28,946 --> 00:34:31,476
I can hardly explain it to myself.

609
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:32,955
But I can...

610
00:34:33,093 --> 00:34:35,025
help you figure it out.

611
00:34:35,955 --> 00:34:37,642
You don't have to be in this alone.

612
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,603
I'm not.

613
00:34:48,175 --> 00:34:50,414
I have you and this family.

614
00:34:53,013 --> 00:34:55,938
And I don't want anyone to have
a reason to take me away.

615
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,225
I wouldn't let that happen.

616
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:02,073
If anyone found out, you might not have
a choice in the matter.

617
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,598
We just got you back.

618
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:12,480
If it means never
letting you go again...

619
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:16,157
no one else needs to know
that you're different.

620
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:22,248
Nicole, I don't want to be different.

621
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,589
I just want to be ordinary.

622
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,823
Honey...

623
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,998
we could ignore

624
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:38,066
all the things about you
that you can't explain

625
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:41,599
and you could try to act
like everybody else,

626
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:44,239
but tonight there was a girl

627
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,921
trapped inside a burning building

628
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:48,097
and your only instinct

629
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:50,401
was to save her.

630
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:53,198
That's who you are.

631
00:35:54,514 --> 00:35:55,798
And there is nothing

632
00:35:55,884 --> 00:35:57,778
ordinary about it.

633
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:25,176
Crap.

634
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:33,416
So busted.

635
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,518
Before you say anything,

636
00:36:36,347 --> 00:36:38,559
yes, I have been drinking.

637
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:41,131
And, yes, I know it's not a good idea.

638
00:36:42,278 --> 00:36:44,946
And, no, I cannot promise
that I will never do it again.

639
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:49,854
I do, however, recognize
that I'm using it as a crutch

640
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,979
to hide from the mistakes of my past,

641
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,895
and I can assure you that I intend
on living a much

642
00:36:56,116 --> 00:36:58,162
less destructive life for myself

643
00:36:58,604 --> 00:37:00,629
in the future as soon as I...

644
00:37:00,716 --> 00:37:02,752
figure out what
my life is supposed to be.

645
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:06,861
I love you, and I didn't drive.

646
00:37:08,132 --> 00:37:10,261
Oh, and I'm a virgin.

647
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:11,878
Again.

648
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:17,599
She's not actually getting
away with that, is she?

649
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:19,811
Good.

650
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:22,055
Cupcake, anyone?

651
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,532
Where's Kyle?

652
00:37:27,863 --> 00:37:30,075
He seemed a bit out of it today.

653
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:32,701
He was feeling a little down.
I talked to him.

654
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:36,426
Then he'll be fine. You're good at that.

655
00:37:41,682 --> 00:37:43,894
He's right, you are good at that.

656
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:46,769
Then I guess it's time
to stop running from it.

657
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,482
Oh, so how was the rest of your night?

658
00:37:54,611 --> 00:37:55,772
Uneventful.

659
00:38:15,223 --> 00:38:16,920
I don't think they did it.

660
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,317
You don't?

661
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:21,695
I have great sex radar. I can tell.

662
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:24,018
Besides, Amanda's a textbook case.

663
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,400
She'd want the night to be perfect,
and last night's...

664
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:28,023
pyrotechnic near-tragedy

665
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:30,017
was hardly the ideal setup.

666
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:32,408
I hope you're right.

667
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,414
And voting season's over in five,

668
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:37,799
four, three, two...

669
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:43,729
I think we're about to get
sage words of wisdom, Kyle style.

670
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:44,959
You mean, like,

671
00:38:45,152 --> 00:38:48,138
why are we both so worried about
what other people think of us?

672
00:38:48,304 --> 00:38:52,258
Or we can't be liked
until we like ourselves.

673
00:38:52,382 --> 00:38:56,710
Ooh, I bet it's that we get to decide
who we really are, not anyone else.

674
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:57,926
Huh.

675
00:38:58,728 --> 00:38:59,746
Interesting.

676
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:01,894
You're good.

677
00:39:12,151 --> 00:39:14,266
- Save me.
- From what?

678
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,630
The list just came out.
I don't want any part of it.

679
00:39:16,796 --> 00:39:18,925
Do we really need
any more ways to be mean?

680
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:20,597
That's what I say.

681
00:39:21,454 --> 00:39:24,799
Hey, I didn't see you leave last night.
You missed all the craziness.

682
00:39:24,993 --> 00:39:26,735
How's the girl from the fire?

683
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:28,582
She's going to be completely fine.

684
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,120
I guess she got out just in time.

685
00:39:31,608 --> 00:39:32,935
That's a relief.

686
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,704
It's a miracle is what it is.

687
00:39:34,815 --> 00:39:37,442
- Let me ring you up.
- Crap!

688
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:38,838
Are you on it again?

689
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,691
Worse. I'm not even on it at all.

690
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:42,984
But you are.

691
00:39:44,145 --> 00:39:45,169
What?

692
00:39:49,682 --> 00:39:53,028
I guess that just goes to show
how wrong it can be, huh?

693
00:39:53,581 --> 00:39:56,899
Totally. Hey, who got
"Biggest Slut" anyway?

694
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:01,351
What?

695
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,507
What's going on?

696
00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:26,327
I think they saw this.

697
00:40:31,424 --> 00:40:32,475
What?

698
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:37,535
That's a really stupid joke.

699
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:50,878
Very funny, everybody.
Very funny. That's good.

700
00:40:57,266 --> 00:41:00,059
Amanda, it's... it's a joke.

701
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:03,017
It's not a joke.

702
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:07,719
I'm sorry, but it's not.

703
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:11,617
I know.

704
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:15,406
I slept with him.

705
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:20,700
She's lying.

706
00:41:22,754 --> 00:41:24,005
She is?

707
00:41:31,228 --> 00:41:33,228
It doesn't look like it.

708
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,660
- Amanda...
- Stop.

709
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,281
Just stop.

710
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,334
This is what you wanted to tell me.

711
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:55,624
You didn't think I wanted
to hear it from you.

712
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:00,992
You were wrong.

713
00:42:26,265 --> 00:42:28,661
In life, everybody gets labeled.

714
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:30,887
Charlie was a cheater,

715
00:42:31,525 --> 00:42:34,071
giving Amanda the label of the betrayed.

716
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:37,822
With the breakup of the "Best Couple,"

717
00:42:37,984 --> 00:42:40,768
Declan and Lori are left
with a new label:

718
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:42,482
the heartbroken.

719
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:46,500
People try to tell us
who we're meant to be,

720
00:42:46,635 --> 00:42:49,825
but it's up to us to decide
whether or not the label fits.

721
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:52,743
After everything I'd done to fight it,

722
00:42:52,878 --> 00:42:55,884
I finally understood the label
I was meant to have.

723
00:42:56,567 --> 00:42:59,044
I would never be normal or ordinary.

724
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:01,330
My destiny...

725
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:03,064
was to be extraordinary.

726
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:06,121
This is the label I've accepted,

727
00:43:06,635 --> 00:43:09,364
and now it's my responsibility
to earn it.

728
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:10,716
I'm ready.
