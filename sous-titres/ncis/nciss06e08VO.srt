2
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:03,473
Langer.

3
00:00:04,776 --> 00:00:06,854
<i>One of them is betraying their country.</i>

4
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:40,619
Can I help you?

5
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,519
Had a heck of a time finding this place.

6
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:47,047
You know you guys don't
have any numbers out here?

7
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:48,532
We don't get deliveries.

8
00:00:48,592 --> 00:00:50,199
Well, today you do.

9
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:52,696
You guys,
mind giving me a hand with this?

10
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,067
Did this go through
secure Naval channels?

11
00:00:59,134 --> 00:01:01,712
Has it been scanned?
What's inside?

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,337
Only one way to find out.

13
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:07,890
Welcome to the 21st Century.

14
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,618
It's clean for hazardous materials.

15
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:14,330
It's not ordnance.
Go and crack it.

16
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:16,495
All right.

17
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:23,201
Greats, if I can just
have you sign right here...

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,264
Who sent this?

19
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:28,577
I don't know.
Why?

20
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:38,765

24
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:07,008
Come on.

25
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:08,376
Come on, ring.

26
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,613
You know what they say
about a watched pot.

27
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,297
Calls the kettle black?

28
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:13,768
Never boils.

29
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,375
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

30
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,329
Just want to make sure it's working.

31
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:24,678
This... is serious, McGee.

32
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:27,530
This is game time. This is the moment
before the gun. Focus.

33
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:30,203
Guess everyone handles
the pressure in their own way.

34
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:33,122
You could use a little
tension-breaker, Tony. Relax.

35
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:34,799
Relax? You're telling me to relax?

36
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:37,097
Would Red Auerbach
tell Bill Russell to relax?

37
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,278
I don't know.

38
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:39,774
William Felton Russell.

39
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:42,965
Five-time MVP.
Greatest basketball champion ever.

40
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:46,226
Used to get so nervous, so pumped,
he had to throw up before every game.

41
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:48,491
You have chosen to model your behavior

42
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,969
after a man who vomited
on a regular basis?

43
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:52,670
Nine titles in 11 seasons.

44
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:56,620
Hall of Fame.
One night, the Celtics take the court.

45
00:02:57,016 --> 00:02:58,872
It's a big game. Huge.

46
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:02,341
Red's watching them warm up from the
sidelines, but something's not right.

47
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:04,869
He can tell.
They're not clicking.

48
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:07,682
He clears the floor, takes them all
back down to the locker room.

49
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:08,489
Why?

50
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:10,909
Because Russell didn't throw up.

51
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,566
You know what Red says next?

52
00:03:13,665 --> 00:03:15,815
"Get in there and puke.
We got a game to win."

53
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,607
- Tip-off?
- Just got the call.

54
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,842
You ride with McGee.
These boots are new.

55
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:29,592
Dead sailor in a box.

56
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:31,543
Delivery manifest had no origin.

57
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,308
We got to ask you this:
did you order a dead body?

58
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:35,851
No, we did not.

59
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:39,135
Can you get him out of here now?
This is a breach of security protocol.

60
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:41,288
- What is this place?
- That's classified.

61
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,696
Classified?

62
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:44,660
What do you got in there, aliens?

63
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,072
Bigfoot? Ark of the Covenant?
That only leaves one thing.

64
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:50,239
<i>- Unicorn.</i>
- What is your clearance?

65
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:52,695
About six-foot-one and a half.
Why, you got low ceilings?

66
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:55,251
Just get him out of here now,
would you?

67
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,441
Can't. Protocol.

68
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,624
Got to wait for the medical examiner
to release him.

69
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,420
- And there he is.
- How many trucks you guys got?

70
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:05,254
Well, you've already met
Widow Woman and Spider Mike here.

71
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:07,698
Rubber Ducky makes it
<i>a great big convoy</i>.

72
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,629
Park it right there, Love Machine.

73
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:12,217
"We're gonna be rocking
through the night here, Smokey."

74
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:13,583
Would rather not.

75
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:15,513
"East bound and down, Snowman."

76
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,720
"Bandit out."

77
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,306
You see what I did there?
It was pretty good.

78
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,639
Seamless transition from <i>Convoy</i> to...

79
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,269
Yep, <i>Smokey and the Bandit</i>. I got it.
You are a comic genius.

80
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,246
Thanks.

81
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:33,716
"You got
some structural damage there."

82
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:35,869
Deckard.
That's from <i>Blade Runner</i>.

83
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:39,707
Dry ice.
It's a very effective coolant.

84
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:42,353
It was initially observed
by a French chemist

85
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,665
in the first half of the 19th Century.

86
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,824
Meanwhile, half a world away,

87
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:49,830
the Chicago meat packer, Gustavus Swift,

88
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:53,577
was trying to perfect a way
of shipping edible flesh

89
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:56,254
in his refrigerated railroad cars.

90
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:01,007
It was almost a century before
the two notions were put togeth...

91
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:05,136
We do take the conveniences
of the modern era for granted, don't...

92
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,002
Doctor?

93
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:10,655
Something familiar, Duck?

94
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,736
Reminds me of Gibraltar.

95
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:17,124
Yeah, that...

96
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:18,686
was the case.

97
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:21,541
What happened in Gibraltar?

98
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,950
That's a story for another time,
Mr. Palmer.

99
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:26,087
Put the lid back on.
Let's get him in the van.

100
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,340
There's nothing more for us
to do here.

101
00:05:31,058 --> 00:05:32,093
Ready to go.

102
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:20,072
- We up?
- Just about.

103
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:23,631
Okay, I'm in their video feed.

104
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:25,992
Recording live signal
for the feedback loop.

105
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:37,715
Now we wait.

106
00:06:49,714 --> 00:06:51,949
- You read me, Snowman?
- Sit tight, Bandit.

107
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:53,777
Okay, electronic pass code:

108
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,753
seven, five, three, zero, <i>nine.</i>

109
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,840
Copy: seven, five, <i>three, zero, nine.</i>

110
00:07:00,243 --> 00:07:02,711
Starting the loop now.
Mirroring the cameras...

111
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:04,510
the guards will be watching a re-feed.

112
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,754
I'm sick of chasing after crazy women.

113
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:08,798
It's like this girl's a robot.

114
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:11,901
Guards have entered secondary hallway.
Interior hallway clear.

115
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:13,288
Green light.

116
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:27,743
They're in.

117
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:36,053
All right,
there's a patrol coming through,

118
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:39,221
take the first door on your right.
<i>15-second window. Go.</i>

119
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:46,534
Stop breathing.

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,127
You are clear.

121
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,413
- Fire alarm?
- What did you do?

122
00:08:15,473 --> 00:08:17,870
- What do you mean, me?
- You, run. <i>Run!</i>

123
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:19,213
Security alarm.

124
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,023
- Mr. Palmer, what did you do with...
- The cause of death paperwork.

125
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:33,795
Sign here by the sticky flag.

126
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:36,078
- And the body release...
- The body release form.

127
00:08:36,257 --> 00:08:37,670
Initial here.

128
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:40,093
What time are the...

129
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,047
The transportation to the mortician
is set up for tomorrow morning.

130
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,577
As you're so adept at reading my mind,

131
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:48,696
what do I want now?

132
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:53,322
Privacy.

133
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:56,536
Spend enough time with someone,

134
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:59,023
and
they begin to notice your patterns.

135
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,438
Yeah, well,
Palmer's got your number, Duck.

136
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:03,262
And I have yours.

137
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:07,804
The successful conclusion of a case
usually marks the appearance of a...

138
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:11,083
a sense of satisfaction
on your countenance.

139
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:15,016
Presently, I can't help
but notice a lack of contentment.

140
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,641
I didn't come down here
to get my head shrunk.

141
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,709
What did you come for?

142
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:21,586
Just killing time.

143
00:09:22,502 --> 00:09:25,047
Would you like me to perform
an autopsy on your watch?

144
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:29,986
Yeah, Gibbs.
On my way.

145
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:36,705
There's obviously
something on his mind.

146
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:39,415
However, rest assured,
whatever it may be,

147
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:41,468
it does not involve you.

148
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:46,642
These are pretty standard indemnity
waivers. Should cover whatever...

149
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:48,658
Pleasantries?

150
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:51,657
Skip them.

151
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:54,380
Got a mission for your team.
Something out of the ordinary.

152
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,694
Secretary of the Navy sees
the need to upgrade

153
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:58,426
our protection of strategic files.

154
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:02,466
No wonder, after what happened with
Agent Langer trying to steal those...

155
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:05,755
confidential military plans.

156
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,417
SECNAV considers us lucky
they didn't get into the open.

157
00:10:08,785 --> 00:10:09,967
Thanks to Agent Lee.

158
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,688
Thanks, Agent Lee.

159
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,942
Doesn't want to press
his luck anymore.

160
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:17,963
You're looking at
a new secure facility.

161
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,612
Just how secure...

162
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,747
- To be determined.
- By us.

163
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:25,032
You get to be
the bad guy for a change.

164
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:32,913
Just a second.

165
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:36,305
I'm... I'm in the shower.

166
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,213
I hit my face on your door.

167
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:45,623
Why'd you do that?

168
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:48,525
I don't know, 'cause the door's locked.
That door is never locked.

169
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:50,485
The door's rarely been closed.

170
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:52,118
There was a...

171
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,630
a draft.

172
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,388
- This room is sealed.
- "Sealed."

173
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,461
Sealed like an evidence box.

174
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,746
Petty Officer Dent's personal effects.
That's what you're here for.

175
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:05,061
- What are you working on?
- I'm not working on anything.

176
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:06,659
Why'd you think I work on something?

177
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:08,912
I don't know.
The Dent case is closed.

178
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:12,192
This is usually the time you catch your
breath and you seem decidedly out of it.

179
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,648
Plus you've got something
on the monitor there.

180
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:19,344
It has nothing to do with your case.
It's another case.

181
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:20,810
Whose case is it?

182
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:23,893
It's my case.
Okay? So get off of it.

183
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:33,980
- What's with the door?
- Don't ask.

184
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,637
Gibbs wants us.
What's that all about?

185
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,180
Bye, guys.
Nice to see you.

186
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,280
This looks like a lecture.

187
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:57,494
It's giving me college flashbacks.
Doesn't this remind you of college?

188
00:11:57,554 --> 00:11:59,014
Not in the slightest.

189
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,580
Hey, boss. McGee thinks
we're going to get a lecture.

190
00:12:01,683 --> 00:12:03,592
You just might if
you don't pay attention.

191
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:05,344
Code name: Domino.

192
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:08,113
Domino. Domino is...

193
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,799
the top secret military
contingency plan,

194
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:12,714
which specifically details...

195
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:17,193
specifically details...

196
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:20,215
Think the freshman's
having a senior moment, boss.

197
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:23,389
How the US would respond
to a terrorist attack on a target

198
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:25,431
of interest in Israel
or the Middle East.

199
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:27,252
What Langer hacked from our system.

200
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:29,579
Gold star.
McGee, study up.

201
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:32,109
I'm up. I'm up, boss.
I just froze for a second.

202
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:36,554
Electronic files like Domino need
to be accessible by multiple sources.

203
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:39,295
President, Joint Chiefs yet,
they need to be secure.

204
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:41,243
SECNAV wants to prevent
another breach.

205
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:43,454
The only way to assure
that would be off-network.

206
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,847
Stand-alone system hardwired directly
to the White House and the Pentagon.

207
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,179
Like this one here.

208
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,712
A labyrinth of security measures
surrounds the Central Access Hub...

209
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,084
Housing Domino. Can't be
hacked because it's closed circuit.

210
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:57,718
Which makes the file "unstealable".

211
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,837
Well, we're going to steal it.

212
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:03,427
It's a test.

213
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:06,225
Breach the facility.
Enter the central hub.

214
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,414
Retrieve Domino.
Extract without leaving a trace.

215
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:10,940
Boss, it's an impossible mission.

216
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:13,109
I suddenly see myself
dangling from wires.

217
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:15,591
Our leak.
Our responsibility.

218
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:18,072
Use any resource.
Don't let out specifics.

219
00:13:18,154 --> 00:13:21,113
- I want to hear a plan.
- "Shall we play a game?"

220
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:25,329
- Matthew Broderick in <i>War Games</i>.
- Don't say the word "War Game".

221
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:27,707
No one else knows?

222
00:13:28,164 --> 00:13:30,097
The guards manning this facility,

223
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,489
they don't even know
there's a test coming.

224
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,138
Okay, first thing we need...

225
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:37,165
... pizza.

226
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:49,846
- I say we go with a fire drill.
- Please stop pitching the fire drill.

227
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:51,418
I think I got it.

228
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:53,782
- We are not digging a tunnel.
- Or building a catapult.

229
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,736
Or setting up a series
of pneumatic tubes.

230
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,684
Although I am partial to the concept.

231
00:13:57,752 --> 00:14:01,193
No, I haven't figured out a way in.
I figured out we're thinking wrong.

232
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:05,396
We need to think less like us.

233
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,288
And more like them.

234
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,248
- Who are "them"?
- The guys we catch.

235
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,958
The break-in specialists,
the burglars, the robbers.

236
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:13,711
Remember that stakeout?

237
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:16,174
The guy fooled you with the
mirror on the video surveillance.

238
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,191
We put the cameras on a loop.
We can use that.

239
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:19,627
Can use that.
Okay.

240
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:23,438
Getting into an inaccessible building.
How many bad guys have broken in here?

241
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:27,026
The Trojan horseman hid inside
a hollowed-out seat of a taxicab

242
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:28,827
to access the evidence garage.

243
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:32,014
A taxi can't get into the front gate
of a high-security facility.

244
00:14:32,074 --> 00:14:33,397
Any other bad guys get in?

245
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:36,874
- Agent Lee.
- Is this up for grabs?

246
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,962
If you can answer the question.

247
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:44,662
Well, it was before my time,
but I'm guessing Ziva's brother?

248
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:48,454
Half-brother.
Ari.

249
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:52,761
- He infiltrated NCIS in a body bag.
- We get a body in there.

250
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:55,696
Gets the guards off guard,
but does it get us in the door?

251
00:14:57,204 --> 00:14:59,095
Follow-up question.
Hypothetical.

252
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:01,341
For the cheese.

253
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:05,012
Say that a dead body was discovered
at a top secret facility.

254
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:07,802
Okay,
what kind of top secret facility?

255
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:10,227
NORAD.

256
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:13,403
- Well, that's not our jurisdiction.
- The Navy equivalent.

257
00:15:13,468 --> 00:15:16,641
Yeah. Off the books.
Hush-hush, but Navy-operated.

258
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:20,389
- Can you be more specific?
- Say, a dead sailor.

259
00:15:21,414 --> 00:15:22,986
About the facility, not the body.

260
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:25,324
That's all we got.
Would they call us?

261
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:27,731
Yeah, I can't see why they wouldn't.

262
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:29,243
Help yourself.

263
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:31,324
- Thank you.
- Small piece.

264
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:33,958
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's talk extraction.

265
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,961
We need to be like a dentist. We got
to kill the nerve, take the tooth.

266
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:37,951
How?

267
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:40,065
- Subterranean.
- The plumbing system.

268
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:43,352
One-way valve joins up with
the main trunk under the street outside.

269
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:45,548
They can't get in that way,
but they can get out.

270
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,741
Thanks for volunteering us
for frogman duties.

271
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:49,153
It's a slam dunk, boss.

272
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:51,851
I'm sensing some reservations.

273
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,928
Yeah, we need to ask him
if we can borrow a body.

274
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:56,897
- Don't.
- It is the only way.

275
00:15:57,078 --> 00:15:58,723
Don't ask.
Just take it.

276
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:00,786
He'll say no.

277
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,959
One other idea.
Okay, this is a good one.

278
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:06,550
The emergency doors on corridor two
are tied to the fire alarm.

279
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:09,076
Fire alarm goes off.
Those doors open automatically.

280
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:10,534
For firefighter access.

281
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:13,533
- Practically open field to the hub.
- No. Too blatant.

282
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,584
Navy is only concerned
about a covert breach.

283
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:17,624
- Get a body.
- Put it in motion.

284
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,197
Last thing.

285
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,011
The other side's using live fire.
Do not engage.

286
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:24,587
Do not resist if caught.

287
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,760
Get in. Get the intel.
Get out.

288
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:29,221
Nobody gets hurt.

289
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:32,517
They spotted us.

290
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:34,198
- Something's wrong.
- Well, yeah.

291
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:35,561
I can hear that, McGee.

292
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:36,830
That's a fire alarm.

293
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,244
Security alarm, too,
which shouldn't be going off.

294
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:45,214
Our feed's been killed.
We're blind.

295
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:46,274
Game over.

296
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:48,505
- They haven't made us!
- On the ground.

297
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:50,076
No, no...

298
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,103
Get down! Now!

299
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:56,984
- Gunshot.
- Stand down.

300
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,915
Stand down!

301
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,030
Hey!

302
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:11,704
Hold her!

303
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:38,838
Young lady?

304
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:40,661
Can you speak?

305
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:42,531
Tony.

306
00:17:43,155 --> 00:17:46,045
Apologies for the shackles. We were
concerned about your state of mind.

307
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:47,457
You were right to be.

308
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:48,842
Where is Tony?

309
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:52,340
Remain calm.

310
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:56,398
I promise you and
Agent DiNozzo will soon be reunited.

311
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:04,871
Cuban.
Prohibited in the States.

312
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,210
I trust you won't tell anyone.

313
00:18:10,391 --> 00:18:12,000
Director Vance has arrived, sir.

314
00:18:12,636 --> 00:18:13,721
She's awake.

315
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:27,766
- What is going on?
- I am not entirely sure.

316
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:33,760
Deckard's bullets may not have
been real, but his gun butt sure was.

317
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:35,776
If the bullets were not real, then...

318
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,695
They knew we were coming.

319
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:44,260
They were in on it, too?

320
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:46,558
Oh, well, yeah, they were in on it.

321
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:48,090
I don't know about "too".

322
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,427
Apparently...

323
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:54,218
we didn't get the full picture.

324
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:55,981
Who was that man?

325
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,747
- You don't recognize him?
- No.

326
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,246
Well,
there's this little drinking game

327
00:19:02,456 --> 00:19:05,461
sailors taught me during
my time as an agent afloat.

328
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:08,685
Someone calls for a coin.
You pull out one of these.

329
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,572
Whoever has
the highest officer's coin,

330
00:19:11,704 --> 00:19:14,449
whoever's rubbed elbows with the...

331
00:19:15,175 --> 00:19:18,359
biggest brass,
everyone else has to buy him drinks.

332
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,270
That's who that man was.

333
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,181
The downside here is,
someone's lying to us.

334
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,470
The upside is, we'll never have
to pay for a drink again.

335
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,794
Mr. Secretary.

336
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:36,158
Do you know where I was tonight,
Leon?

337
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:39,601
The Kennedy Center, sir. I checked
with your scheduling assistant.

338
00:19:39,704 --> 00:19:42,403
A visiting production of Chekhov's
<i>The Cherry Orchard</i>,

339
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,957
a well-deserved distraction.

340
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,325
Ignorance may have been
your best defense.

341
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:48,753
A man of sound judgment
might have opted

342
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,409
to schedule this affair
for a less cluttered evening.

343
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:54,118
I am sorry to pull you out of it, sir,
it was unavoidable.

344
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:55,921
I love the Russians.

345
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:58,999
Their cold, calculating
approach to this business

346
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:02,491
of living makes me feel positively
sentimental by comparison.

347
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:04,059
Do you have a light?

348
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:06,921
Gibbs, isn't it?

349
00:20:09,753 --> 00:20:11,499
For all intents and purposes, sir,

350
00:20:11,664 --> 00:20:14,467
it should appear to anyone watching
that we were conducting a test.

351
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:17,237
Security went off effectively.
In a typical exercise of this nature,

352
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:19,725
you would've been called in
to assess the situation.

353
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,398
We had to delay our own response time
to correspond...

354
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,424
Obviously,
you've scripted this little play, Leon.

355
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:27,238
Just tell me where to go and
how much time I need to spend here.

356
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,914
There's still the off chance
I might rejoin the Ambassador

357
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:32,118
and our respective wives
for a nightcap.

358
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,044
Yes, sir.

359
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:36,080
Have you determined whether this
elaborate ruse was worth the effort?

360
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:37,762
We have confirmation.

361
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:41,018
There's still
a security breach in NCIS.

362
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,974
My team did not set off the alarm.

363
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:46,206
Someone got into the central hub.

364
00:20:48,691 --> 00:20:49,719
Really?

365
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:55,279
Hey, your door's locked.

366
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:58,109
I change one little thing and
you all lose your minds.

367
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:00,171
Is this
because of the <i>body snatchers</i>?

368
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:02,268
Are you accusing me
of being a pod person?

369
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,817
I was talking about the theft.
Abby, you haven't heard?

370
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:07,361
Try beginning at the beginning,
Jimmy, instead of the middle.

371
00:21:07,444 --> 00:21:10,627
Okay, the sailor's body, Dent,
I had him all packed up and ready to go.

372
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,587
I signed him over to transport for
delivery to the mortuary. And then...

373
00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:16,639
- he got redirected.
- You lost a body?

374
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:19,677
I didn't lose him, no.
He was... stolen.

375
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:21,786
And that's not even the weirdest part.

376
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:24,424
We showed up at the crime scene,
and there he was.

377
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:26,543
I think
Gibbs had something to do with it.

378
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:28,674
And Dr. Mallard looks like
he wants to kill someone.

379
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:31,323
I just don't want it to be me.
So I am going...

380
00:21:31,384 --> 00:21:33,304
- You cannot hide here.
- Please!

381
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:34,254
No!

382
00:21:39,316 --> 00:21:40,527
- Hey, Abs.
- Hey.

383
00:21:41,596 --> 00:21:43,109
- You alone?
- Yeah.

384
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,763
Gibbs sent me back.

385
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:47,559
I thought you didn't have any work
to do. What are you doing here so late?

386
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:49,117
What are you doing here so late?

387
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,183
I guess I'm allowed to talk about it
now. We had a mission.

388
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:56,513
- It was a war game.
- I understand.

389
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:58,195
Yeah. We failed.

390
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:03,876
Wait.
Why do you understand?

391
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:06,209
What do you mean?
I'm understanding.

392
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:09,590
I understand that you're understanding,
but... what are you understanding?

393
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,929
How often do we go off
on secret war game missions?

394
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:13,703
Never.

395
00:22:13,763 --> 00:22:15,893
Yet you were not surprised
to hear that we were on one?

396
00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:18,743
- Stop interrogating me, McGee.
- Stop acting weird.

397
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:19,931
I am weird.

398
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,605
- Did you know where we were?
- I don't know anything.

399
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,649
- You know something.
- Well,

400
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:29,586
now, I guess I know everything,

401
00:22:29,701 --> 00:22:31,978
but I didn't know anything then.

402
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:33,509
- When?
- Before.

403
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:34,992
- You're lying.
- I'm leaving.

404
00:22:35,115 --> 00:22:36,130
I'm staying.

405
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,943
We're going to be let in on the real
mission now, assuming you know?

406
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:45,151
It was a trap.

407
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:47,672
There's a mole in NCIS.

408
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:50,256
- Another one?
- You mean Langer was not alone?

409
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,026
Domino was the bait.
This was an opportunity.

410
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:56,472
- To see if they would take it?
- Did they?

411
00:22:56,862 --> 00:22:59,728
Yeah, well,
used our break-in as a smokescreen.

412
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:03,125
Interior cameras were disabled.
Security was focused on us.

413
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,575
We did half the work for 'em.

414
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:08,192
The mole triggered the fire alarm,
used that access point?

415
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:10,137
And the alarm in your sector...

416
00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:11,311
You were a diversion.

417
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,831
So they could get to
the central hub undetected.

418
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:17,835
They could not have gotten in and out in
that amount of time unless, of course,

419
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:19,189
someone let them in.

420
00:23:25,802 --> 00:23:28,739
What exactly are we looking for,
Director Vance?

421
00:23:29,972 --> 00:23:33,289
I was under the impression that
if all went according to your plan,

422
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:35,640
the intruder would enter this room,

423
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,139
use this station to access Domino,
and still be here.

424
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:41,725
I don't recall
the part about vanishing

425
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:43,221
into thin air.

426
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,086
The plan was never to apprehend
the intruder here, sir.

427
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:48,231
No?

428
00:23:49,342 --> 00:23:50,676
Pardon my confusion.

429
00:23:50,736 --> 00:23:53,016
You do intend to catch
this perpetrator?

430
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:54,528
Of course, sir,

431
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,823
- but...
- Escort me out, Leon.

432
00:23:58,628 --> 00:24:01,686
Unless there are other nothings
you would like to show me.

433
00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:06,234
Don't touch the console.

434
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:09,919
Doesn't seem like the thing that
can wait. Where did McGee go anyway?

435
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:11,544
- Leave it.
- But...

436
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,256
It's bogus, DiNozzo.

437
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:16,051
Whole installation is bogus.

438
00:24:18,392 --> 00:24:19,429
Nothing is real?

439
00:24:20,094 --> 00:24:21,264
Just the threat.

440
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,476
Do you know who it is?

441
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:27,896
Do we know who it is?

442
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:31,339
Someone close to us.

443
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:35,570
In my experience, when a trap
is properly sprung, usually one's

444
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:37,542
quarry is found locked inside.

445
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:40,007
It's not sufficient
to identify the leak, sir.

446
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:41,916
We need to determine
the extent of the damage,

447
00:24:41,976 --> 00:24:44,079
where it leads,
where it's gone already.

448
00:24:44,478 --> 00:24:46,810
What we have now, sir, is just an ant.

449
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,085
But the ant takes the poison
to the colony and the whole hill dies.

450
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,641
What you have is not an ant,
but a rat.

451
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:55,635
Rats carry diseases,

452
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,462
diseases you cannot cure.

453
00:24:57,522 --> 00:24:59,809
What you can do is catch the rat.

454
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:02,112
The threat could be
more extensive than that.

455
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:03,431
No one is above suspicion.

456
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,061
When the vacancy was created
at the top of your agency,

457
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:10,814
you induced me to give you this post.

458
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,695
The deal was quite simple.

459
00:25:13,232 --> 00:25:15,291
Get your house in order.

460
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:22,242
I do not care for vermin.

461
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:40,020
Follow me.

462
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:43,618
Okay, but only because
I was already going this way.

463
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:47,057
- What is with the...?
- It's called discretion.

464
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:49,018
- What do you know?
- About what?

465
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:51,478
You know Director Vance
reassigned the three of us

466
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:53,483
because he believed
there was a mole in NCIS.

467
00:25:53,543 --> 00:25:56,275
He'd narrowed it down to three agents:
Langer, Keating, and Lee.

468
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:58,861
Langer was in possession of Domino
when Lee killed him.

469
00:25:59,544 --> 00:26:01,170
Thereby eliminating the mole problem.

470
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,359
As far as Vance was concerned,
we were free to come home again.

471
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,619
- Right, so what's the problem?
- The problem is it's a load of crap.

472
00:26:08,113 --> 00:26:09,842
You're upset
about losing the war game.

473
00:26:09,947 --> 00:26:11,119
It wasn't a war game.

474
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:13,417
It was a mole hunt,
and it's not over yet.

475
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,420
Langer was only part of it?

476
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,562
Maybe...

477
00:26:17,752 --> 00:26:19,923
or maybe
he was not part of it at all.

478
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:21,355
He was a patsy?

479
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:23,375
Mole could have planted
the info on him.

480
00:26:23,508 --> 00:26:26,430
Knew Vance was closing in,
killed Langer to get the heat off.

481
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:29,141
How would he arrange for Lee
to shoot Langer?

482
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:30,767
Easiest way.

483
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:32,293
The mole...

484
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:36,690
is... benign, which is fantastic,
'cause I was a little worried,

485
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:38,326
and so the dermatologist

486
00:26:38,356 --> 00:26:41,207
says, "That's not a carcinoma,
all right. It's a beauty mark".

487
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,265
- Hey, how are you, Michelle?
- Hey, I'm sorry. I overheard.

488
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:46,074
I'm, I'm glad it's good news.

489
00:26:46,335 --> 00:26:48,330
Oh, yeah, beauty mark.

490
00:26:50,628 --> 00:26:53,006
So, how did
that other situation work out?

491
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:54,874
You know, the hypothetical one.

492
00:26:56,296 --> 00:26:58,045
Good, good.
Thank you for your help.

493
00:26:58,126 --> 00:26:59,311
Oh, don't mention it.

494
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,258
Not that you guys mentioned much.
You were... secretive.

495
00:27:04,404 --> 00:27:06,136
We were... conducting an exercise.

496
00:27:07,253 --> 00:27:08,253
It's a war game.

497
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,140
Oh, cool.
Who won?

498
00:27:12,306 --> 00:27:13,363
The other side.

499
00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:21,567
How's your team taking it
being left in the dark?

500
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:23,065
Like pros.

501
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,155
They know the danger.

502
00:27:25,235 --> 00:27:26,698
If she suspects we're onto her.

503
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:29,610
Well, it's best for them
to lick their wounds and act beaten.

504
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,954
Long as you know it's just an act.

505
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:33,821
It won't last much longer.

506
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:36,875
No, but in the meantime,
they have to stay bottled up.

507
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:39,920
Lee gets spooked,
this whole thing's blown.

508
00:27:40,195 --> 00:27:42,214
And we'll never know
if she's working with someone.

509
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:45,380
I've burned a lot of satellite hours
monitoring her movements.

510
00:27:45,755 --> 00:27:47,428
She hasn't made a contact yet.

511
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:51,696
- Stone face, not much consolation.
- She's a trained agent.

512
00:27:51,756 --> 00:27:54,101
You can't put a tail on her
every time she leaves the building.

513
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:56,645
I'm tempted to bust her right now
before anything goes wrong.

514
00:27:57,037 --> 00:27:59,690
Little powwow with SECNAV
bring on a change of heart, Leon?

515
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,983
Change of mind perhaps.

516
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:02,308
Stick with the plan.

517
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,070
You looking to sit in this chair,
Gibbs?

518
00:28:05,342 --> 00:28:07,656
Well, that would be a little awkward.
Chair's occupied.

519
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:10,742
Means, unfortunately,
I don't take my orders from you.

520
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:11,879
Might be easier...

521
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:14,580
and then I wouldn't have all this.

522
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,177
- That one hurt.
- No, it didn't.

523
00:28:29,386 --> 00:28:32,181
Didn't we get our fill
of secret agendas and lying and

524
00:28:32,262 --> 00:28:34,640
manipulation during
the previous administration?

525
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:37,001
Look, I, too, had hoped
things would be different by now.

526
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:39,021
I'd like to go and give
Vance a piece of my mind.

527
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:41,315
The way you're losing it,
you don't have enough to spare.

528
00:28:41,395 --> 00:28:44,735
I'd like to take that toothpick of his
and shove it up the SECNAV's cigar.

529
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:47,279
- You have had enough of this job, then.
- I like the job.

530
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,204
I don't like the politics. I wasn't
kidding about that part earlier.

531
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:52,534
If you had ever had
some military training,

532
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:54,703
then maybe you would have learned
to follow orders.

533
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:56,121
What, like you?!

534
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,416
We were given a direct order
not to engage.

535
00:28:58,476 --> 00:29:00,875
I recall that you were
the first one to throw a punch.

536
00:29:00,957 --> 00:29:02,002
It was a reflex.

537
00:29:02,594 --> 00:29:04,546
Really?
Then what happened after?

538
00:29:04,636 --> 00:29:07,716
Last thing I remember before the lights
went out was you kimbo-slicing

539
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:09,991
through a room full of guards.
Was that a reflex?

540
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:12,887
Yes, it was.
Gunshot went off. I saw you...

541
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,360
I'm tired of pretending.

542
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,426
So am I.

543
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:24,575
It's dinner theater
for an audience of one.

544
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:27,041
When's the curtain go down?

545
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:34,660
Violated is the least
of what I'm feeling.

546
00:29:34,954 --> 00:29:36,808
If ever there was a time

547
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:40,415
for you to break your moratorium
on apologies, then this would be it.

548
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:44,377
I am not unfamiliar with
the discourtesies of the spy game,

549
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:46,755
but there are certain liberties
you do not take, and

550
00:29:46,836 --> 00:29:49,465
if you do, you have to tell
the other person as soon as you can.

551
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:50,592
I'm sorry, Ducky.

552
00:29:51,264 --> 00:29:53,145
Thank you for that apology, Anthony.

553
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:56,083
I'm sorry I didn't let you in on what
we were doing. I knew it'd piss you off.

554
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:57,143
But...

555
00:29:57,832 --> 00:29:59,892
I guess I didn't trust you enough.
Sorry.

556
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:01,603
Thank you, Anthony.
That will do.

557
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:04,744
And I'm sorry for making you look like
an idiot in front of the Secretary

558
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:05,829
of the Navy.

559
00:30:06,188 --> 00:30:07,442
I'm sorry for being

560
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:09,111
a cowardly, devious son of a...

561
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:10,112
Anthony!

562
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:11,453
Are you done?

563
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:13,455
Excuse me.

564
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:16,584
I'm not comfortable with
the hand up my backside.

565
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:19,580
You let the Toothpick
use us as puppets.

566
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:21,766
No, I didn't.

567
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,322
- You didn't?
- No.

568
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:25,627
It was my plan.

569
00:30:26,461 --> 00:30:27,296
Your plan?

570
00:30:27,503 --> 00:30:28,505
Every bit of it.

571
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:34,719
That's much worse.

572
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:36,397
It wasn't that I don't trust you.

573
00:30:36,457 --> 00:30:38,321
I didn't let you in
because I didn't have to.

574
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:42,019
I don't make the right play,

575
00:30:42,252 --> 00:30:43,353
she could kill again.

576
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:44,980
So it is Lee.

577
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,566
I'm not worried about her. She's caught,
but she doesn't know it yet.

578
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,986
Then, why don't we just grab her?
What are you worried about?

579
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,612
Who else is connected.

580
00:30:53,202 --> 00:30:54,698
- In this building?
- Maybe.

581
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:56,063
How are you gonna find out?

582
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:58,366
Cameras in the <i>Grand Wazoo</i> room
went down.

583
00:30:58,426 --> 00:31:02,164
The keyboard in the central hub
is coated with an invisible dye.

584
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,959
What, are you going
to continue to muzzle me?

585
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:07,377
It contains a radioactive isotope

586
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:10,088
whose unique signature
can be picked up by a Geiger counter.

587
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,507
Well, whoever accessed the console
probably wore gloves, so...

588
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:15,123
No, it would penetrate.

589
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,163
Stays on your hands for days.

590
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:19,180
If Lee has an accomplice, we'll know.

591
00:31:19,261 --> 00:31:21,183
And if she doesn't?
What if you come up empty?

592
00:31:22,144 --> 00:31:23,144
Pray we do.

593
00:31:24,394 --> 00:31:27,189
I used both of you because
I knew you could handle it.

594
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:30,414
What do you need from us now?

595
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,058
Patience.

596
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:38,149
<i>Abby, will you open up?</i>

597
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:40,118
I'm not interested. Thank you.

598
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:42,120
Abby, I need to tell you something.

599
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:44,122
I don't really care for your tone.

600
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,791
I need to tell you something.

601
00:31:46,085 --> 00:31:46,785
No,

602
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:49,087
I still don't really care for it.

603
00:31:49,147 --> 00:31:51,672
<i>Abby, what has gotten</i> into you?
Come on. Open up.

604
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,901
<i>Yes, Director.</i>

605
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:04,961
Get me Security.

606
00:32:05,211 --> 00:32:06,338
<i>Anyone in particular?</i>

607
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:07,398
All of them.

608
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,858
Geez, McGee.
Are you trying to break it down?

609
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,838
Everyone stay together.
Bring in the next group.

610
00:32:39,195 --> 00:32:40,220
No one speak.

611
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:44,505
Cause there's any confusion why you're
in here, it will soon become clear.

612
00:32:45,268 --> 00:32:48,228
Several of you were involved
in a covert operation last night.

613
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,189
The rest of you, whether
you were aware or not, were in close

614
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:55,207
enough proximity to have knowledge
of some, if not all, of the details.

615
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:57,779
The operation was designed

616
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,811
to identify a security leak
in our department.

617
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:04,619
One of you accessed a console on site.

618
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,955
This will tell me who.

619
00:33:07,348 --> 00:33:10,375
Until this matter is resolved,
nobody is to leave the building.

620
00:33:11,477 --> 00:33:13,003
There's a traitor in this room.

621
00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:18,768
Show me your hands.

622
00:33:53,236 --> 00:33:54,336
Show me your hands.

623
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,075
- Take Ms. Sciuto into custody.
- Yes, sir.

624
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,119
All right, I've only got a minute.

625
00:34:28,671 --> 00:34:30,037
Gibbs is up with the director,

626
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:32,611
trying to figure out which one of them
is going to interrogate you.

627
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:35,083
Abby, you have got to tell me.

628
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:36,377
What is going on?

629
00:34:37,236 --> 00:34:38,629
Is that some kind of trick?

630
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:42,551
- What do you mean?
- Bad cop, dumb cop routine.

631
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:44,199
See who can get me to talk.

632
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:45,676
I'm not talking.

633
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,129
You are talking.

634
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:48,488
Right.

635
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:49,559
O.K.

636
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:51,941
I'm not talking starting now.

637
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:54,353
Abby, this is absurd.
You are not a traitor.

638
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:56,533
Why would you be?
You love this country.

639
00:34:58,428 --> 00:35:00,318
You love NCIS.

640
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:03,610
You love your lab.
You would never risk losing your lab.

641
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:06,449
Abby, you would never betray Gibbs.

642
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,289
Special Agent McGee.
What are you doing with my suspect?

643
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:15,040
Nothing, Director.

644
00:35:15,122 --> 00:35:16,524
She's not talking anyway.

645
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,835
- I want a lawyer.
- Sit tight, Ms. Sciuto.

646
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,127
I've been looking for you.

647
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:46,863
Director Vance.

648
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:48,557
What do you need, sir?

649
00:35:48,617 --> 00:35:50,744
Sciuto is entitled
to legal representation.

650
00:35:50,804 --> 00:35:52,098
Now this is sensitive.

651
00:35:52,603 --> 00:35:55,361
Of course, sir. I'll see that someone
is assigned immediately.

652
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,310
What specifically are the charges?

653
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,908
Conspiracy to murder,
treason, sedition.

654
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:04,173
We're talking about the kind of crimes
federal agencies are brought down by.

655
00:36:04,378 --> 00:36:06,226
I don't want her name equated
with this agency

656
00:36:06,286 --> 00:36:08,182
like Hanssen is with the FBI.
Do you read me?

657
00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:09,886
Yes, sir.
No headlines.

658
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:12,355
Find me a criminal defense lawyer
who understands that.

659
00:36:12,415 --> 00:36:13,141
Okay.

660
00:36:14,688 --> 00:36:15,393
Sir?

661
00:36:16,724 --> 00:36:19,265
That's the type of conversation
I'd have to have

662
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:21,315
person-to-person.
Not over the phone.

663
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:23,067
I'd have to leave the building.

664
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:24,871
And we're still on lockdown.

665
00:36:25,138 --> 00:36:26,649
Fine. I'll alert Security.

666
00:36:28,992 --> 00:36:30,950
- And Lee?
- Yes, sir?

667
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:32,345
Do it now.

668
00:36:39,914 --> 00:36:41,558
Okay, here's what I know.

669
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:43,379
You've been working on something.

670
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:46,060
It's not related to an official case.

671
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,125
You've been secretive, sneaky.

672
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:51,059
You've been locking your doors,
hiding from people.

673
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:54,515
Now, that all looks bad,

674
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:55,606
but, Abby,

675
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:58,100
I know that you're a good person.

676
00:36:58,568 --> 00:36:59,937
You're occasionally eccentric,

677
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:02,926
but you're always reliable.
You're trustworthy.

678
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:04,936
I know you don't want to talk...

679
00:37:04,996 --> 00:37:06,860
Of course I want to talk, McGee.

680
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:08,237
I'm dying here.

681
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:10,031
I've been in on this
since the beginning!

682
00:37:10,112 --> 00:37:11,653
Not-not the traitor part.

683
00:37:11,871 --> 00:37:13,951
The catching of the traitor part.

684
00:37:16,952 --> 00:37:19,040
Gibbs came to me days ago.

685
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:20,827
I formulated the marking dye.

686
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:23,336
I couldn't let anyone into the lab
because

687
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:26,146
no one could see what I was doing.
And plus, I spilled some.

688
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:27,561
On your hands?

689
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:30,760
And on the floor. I mean, the hands part
that was part of the plan.

690
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,180
Wait. So, this is all part of it? Gibbs
and Vance know that you're innocent?

691
00:37:34,437 --> 00:37:35,437
As a puppy.

692
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:38,180
I mean, the kind of puppy
that you would send...

693
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,020
into the bushes to make all the birds
fly out so you could shoot them.

694
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,171
You're so sweet to worry, Timmy,

695
00:37:45,966 --> 00:37:47,946
but I'm not in the cross-hairs.

696
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:16,305
Go.

697
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,212
Who is that for?

698
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:50,690
It was a signal.

699
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,967
We turned the heat on,
opened the door.

700
00:38:53,174 --> 00:38:54,802
If it was just you, you would run.

701
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:57,764
You do this, means it's a conspiracy.

702
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,183
<i>X</i> leads us to your handler. We're used
to the idea of people working as a team.

703
00:39:04,518 --> 00:39:05,771
Act naturally.

704
00:39:22,922 --> 00:39:24,563
<i>- I can explain.
- Sit down.</i>

705
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:27,209
This is a formality.

706
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,498
You are alone here.

707
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:31,255
You did it to yourself.

708
00:39:32,294 --> 00:39:33,294
Langer.

709
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:34,842
What about Langer?

710
00:39:34,922 --> 00:39:35,926
Langer!

711
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,679
- He wasn't part of it.
- NCIS?

712
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,443
No one I know of.

713
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:41,831
Why?

714
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,015
Because I had no choice.

715
00:39:45,274 --> 00:39:47,853
- Believe me, I had no choice in this.
- Not true.

716
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:51,045
- If I don't do what they want, you...
- Who?

717
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:53,319
Who are they?!

718
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:54,744
I don't know!

719
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:56,822
But they know me!

720
00:39:56,944 --> 00:40:00,618
They knew how to get to me. They knew
things about me you don't know.

721
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:09,210
Look.

722
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:12,446
This is Amanda.

723
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:15,618
She's my daughter.

724
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:19,762
If I don't deliver what they want,
they will kill her.

725
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:23,823
If I tell anybody, they will kill her.

726
00:40:23,883 --> 00:40:26,898
If I do anything that
they don't like, they...

727
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,641
If they knew I was in here right now,
she's dead.

728
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:33,162
What am I supposed to do?!

729
00:40:38,008 --> 00:40:39,907
Daughter kidnapped and held hostage.

730
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:43,827
Almost seems designed to engender
sympathy specifically from you.

731
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,373
It doesn't mean it's not true.

732
00:40:45,771 --> 00:40:47,540
Are you trying to convince me
or yourself?

733
00:40:49,897 --> 00:40:52,082
Daughter doesn't exist
in the personnel file.

734
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,914
We have record of
a much younger sister.

735
00:40:54,124 --> 00:40:57,132
She claims Amanda's her daughter.
Had her when she was in high school.

736
00:40:57,398 --> 00:40:59,280
Parents raised her as a sibling.

737
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,582
Lee was focused.

738
00:41:01,012 --> 00:41:02,304
College, law school.

739
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:03,991
She is ambitious.

740
00:41:05,018 --> 00:41:07,393
We formally charge her,
your little girl's gone forever.

741
00:41:09,346 --> 00:41:12,152
Or the story's a lie,
and Lee's still playing us.

742
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:14,984
She's had everybody fooled
from the beginning.

743
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:18,070
Almost everybody.

744
00:41:20,153 --> 00:41:21,406
What do you want to do?

745
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:28,827
Guys, I have kind of a confession.

746
00:41:29,312 --> 00:41:32,716
Michelle and I sort
of had a-a clandestine...

747
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:35,087
We kind of dated for a while.

748
00:41:35,422 --> 00:41:36,422
We know.

749
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:37,714
You do?

750
00:41:37,837 --> 00:41:40,676
Jimmy, I'm sorry your girlfriend
turned out to be a Cylon.

751
00:41:41,023 --> 00:41:42,023
She has a kid.

752
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:44,597
I didn't know that.
Did you know that? I didn't know that.

753
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:48,225
- Wonder what they're doing up there.
- Does the Navy still hang people?

754
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:51,478
- Well, it is treason, Abby.
- McGee!

755
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,356
What else can they do?
There's no way she walks out of here.

756
00:41:55,001 --> 00:41:55,733
No way.

757
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:07,767
Good night, everyone.

758
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:51,344
Looks like we're working together.
