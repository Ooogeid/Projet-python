00:00:05,127 --> 00:00:07,548
Grimlock the great,

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,757
you have stolen my magic meteor,

4
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:12,220
plundered my elderberry fields

5
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:15,181
and crossed into my land
for the last time.

6
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:20,018
Meet your fate,
you son of a half-gnome.

7
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:24,774
Mom!

8
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:28,401
- What?!
- Internet's down again!

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,112
What the hell is wrong now?

10
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,138
Come on, come on...

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,016
I got the jump on one.

12
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:03,811
- Cuffed him to a pipe.
- What do these guys want?

13
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:06,105
- They're pissed with service?
- Where's that backup?

14
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:11,644
Now what?

15
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:19,494
NCIS Season 7 Episode 08

www.Team-NCIS.com

19
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:02,467
Don't bother, Tony.
Cell towers are down, too.

20
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,839
Don't need a cell tower
to play Bing Ball.

21
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,793
Which is about all
I'm going to get done today.

22
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,989
Who let you out of your cave?

23
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:10,296
Dr. Mallard,

24
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:12,507
set me up for a sit-rep.

25
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,186
It's my first sit-rep.

26
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:17,885
Lucky you.
Well, the heat's out, the phone's out,

27
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,346
Internet's down, no elevator,
coffee or vending machines.

28
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:24,744
Backup generators are feeding basic
lights, communications in MTAC.

29
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,688
And autopsy freezers.

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,691
Really?
Yeah, that could get ugly, huh?

31
00:02:31,756 --> 00:02:34,068
So will Gibbs, if McGee
and Ziva don't get here pretty soon.

32
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,085
Get here?

33
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:37,230
You didn't hear?

34
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:39,902
Tony, they never left last night.

35
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,328
You see this?
Nine hours, 21 minutes.

36
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:46,293
Has it been that long?

37
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:51,210
- Why did you do that?
- It was either you or the watch.

38
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,758
It's just,
what's taking so long, you know?

39
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,004
We're not the only ones
who need to be rescued.

40
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:00,470
- Plus, things could be a lot worse.
- Yeah, how's that?

41
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:02,342
Well, we could be stuck here
with Tony.

42
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:03,632
<i>I heard that.</i>

43
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:06,267
<i>I find it very interesting
that the two of you</i>

44
00:03:06,606 --> 00:03:08,674
<i>left together late last night</i>.

45
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,022
Just ignore him.
He's like an annoying bug.

46
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,565
Eventually he'll just go away.

47
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,817
It's been 5 years.
Trust me, he's not going anywhere.

48
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,379
<i>If you want,
I can sing a song for you guys.</i>

49
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,411
Excuse me.

50
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,699
<i>- Sorry.
- Would rather have an update, Tony.</i>

51
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,413
<i>There was an explosion
at a Potomac electric substation</i>

52
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,046
<i>causing some kind of...</i>

53
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:31,711
What is it?
Begins with a "C",

54
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,875
rhymes with "parade sailor".

55
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:34,922
Cascade failure?

56
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:36,549
<i>Cascade failure.</i>

57
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,090
<i>God, you're good at this, McGee.</i>

58
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,279
<i>So that chain reaction knocked out
power in half the district.</i>

59
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:43,419
<i>Pepco says they'll have it
back online soon.</i>

60
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,891
<i>Could not happen soon enough.</i>

61
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,933
I'm sure Gibbs is feeling
right at home.

62
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:51,020
<i>Well, you don't need electricity to use
hand tools or drink a bottle of bourbon.</i>

63
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,738
He's right behind you, isn't he?

64
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:00,437
<i>Yes, he is.</i>

65
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:03,012
Boss, you know there's nothing wrong
with the occasional cocktail.

66
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:07,139
Grab your gear.
Got a dead Navy Lieutenant...

67
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:10,065
at an Internet provider.

68
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,707
- So we're still...?
- Working?

69
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,339
Yeah. Of course we are.

70
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:16,172
I didn't mean to suggest that I wasn't
planning on being productive today.

71
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:17,340
No go.

72
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,618
Try patching the E-doors
to the backup generator.

73
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,054
- Thank god.
- You're late, McGee.

74
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:34,837
I must apologize for our tardiness.

75
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:39,738
Mr. Palmer has trouble navigating
when the streetlights aren't working.

76
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:41,654
It is not my fault.

77
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:43,698
MapChart was down.

78
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:46,285
And who do we have here?

79
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,663
Navy Lieutenant Emma Paxton.

80
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:49,597
And?

81
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:54,793
Actually, that's all we have.

82
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:57,612
NCIS servers are down, too.

83
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:01,090
Local LEOs identified her
by a credit card found in her boot.

84
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:05,164
And as to why a Naval Officer
was taking part in the assault?

85
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,138
That is the million dollar question,
Ducky.

86
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,809
I was doing rounds
when the alarm went off.

87
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:14,022
The next thing we knew,
all hell broke loose.

88
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:15,648
How many?

89
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:17,483
Three I think.
Armed to the teeth.

90
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,070
I tackled the woman.
I was able to cuff her.

91
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,153
She was wounded?

92
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:23,294
No.

93
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:25,900
She was fine when I left her.

94
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,374
I think her friends shot her.

95
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,096
They did not want to risk leaving
someone behind who would talk.

96
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:32,113
So...

97
00:05:32,796 --> 00:05:34,262
She's dead, 'cause of me.

98
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:36,585
Hey, it was either them or us.

99
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:38,713
- What were they after?
- I don't know.

100
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:41,424
Last I saw them,
they were heading into the farm.

101
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:42,550
The farm?

102
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:44,960
Yeah, kind of the brains
of the whole place.

103
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,096
Real high security.
Even we don't have access.

104
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:50,348
Lucky for them, the power went out or
I doubt they would have made it inside.

105
00:05:50,796 --> 00:05:52,225
Maybe not so lucky.

106
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:54,722
I will alert Potomac Electric.

107
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:28,704
They call it the farm.

108
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:30,567
As in the server farm.

109
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:33,683
Connects the Internet
to Internet users.

110
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,270
Anything worth stealing?

111
00:06:37,078 --> 00:06:40,057
Yeah, millions in proprietary
trade secrets for one.

112
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:43,152
We'll have to wait till they do
a full inventory to see what's missing.

113
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,201
That's the iris scanner.

114
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:56,057
Controls the magnetic seals.

115
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:57,623
Lock's uncrackable.

116
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,024
Yeah, so they blew the power.

117
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:01,284
Looks like it.

118
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,679
The camera.

119
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,863
Left it to charge overnight.
Obviously it didn't.

120
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:17,994
I can...

121
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:20,826
I can run back to the car, see if...

122
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:30,556
Wouldn't happen to have
any food in there, would you, boss?

123
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,867
Missed dinner last night.

124
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:37,206
I'm gonna pass.

125
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,934
- I don't offer it, we don't share it.
- I understand. Thank you for offering.

126
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,796
Found tire tracks
from the getaway car in the alley.

127
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:47,966
And an eyewitness who can give us
a sketch of one of the gunmen.

128
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,602
I also alerted

129
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:52,387
Potomac Electric
for the possible connection here.

130
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,430
So power's going to be back on soon?

131
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:57,371
Actually, they said the damage
was a lot worse than they thought.

132
00:07:57,431 --> 00:08:00,682
The chain reaction has now spread
to the entire tristate area.

133
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:03,690
We may be without power for days.

134
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:07,152
So how are we going to run
fingerprints through AFIS?

135
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,654
Or facial recognition software?
What is that?

136
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:12,741
Or access our photos
from our digital cameras?

137
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,077
Want to switch?

138
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:33,399
Lieutenant Emma Paxton.

139
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:36,878
According to her record,
which I found in the annex

140
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:38,850
misfiled in a box
with a rat trap stuck to it,

141
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,660
- she works for AFE.
- Armed Forces Entertainment.

142
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,525
It's a DOD agency that sets up concerts
for Military overseas.

143
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:49,696
Yeah, Tim,
I think he knows what it is.

144
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:51,398
She was a booking agent.

145
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,199
- What was she doing at Swiftcast?
- Appears to have been robbing it.

146
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:58,100
You mean
why was she robbing the place?

147
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:05,649
Background does not shed
a lot of light.

148
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,863
Has a squeaky clean record.
Never saw combat.

149
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,601
Married her high school sweetheart,
Anthony. Nice name.

150
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,013
She's also an upstanding member
of her church.

151
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:27,200
- Sounds like a criminal mastermind.
- What about the other two gunmen?

152
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,443
Abby's working on the tire track
from Swiftcast and wants to talk to you.

153
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:33,446
I've got the gunman sketch
from our eyewitness.

154
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,908
- DiNozzo, BOLO.
- On it.

155
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:41,329
Lieutenant Paxton's bank statements
and credit card... on it.

156
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,186
- Ziva, I want to talk to the husband.
- I will arrange it.

157
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,784
Fax is dead.

158
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:51,546
Phone is dead.

159
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,342
Computer's dead.

160
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,038
It's going to be a long case.

161
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,329
What do you got?

162
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:05,243
Better question is,
"what do you not got, Abs?"

163
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:07,020
And the better answer
would be a Caf-Pow!

164
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,649
I'm trying to make my own here,
but I'm missing, like, 400 ingredients.

165
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,672
- You all right?
- No, I'm not okay.

166
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:13,987
I'm not going to be okay
until the power comes back on and

167
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,863
I can run diagnostics on my babies.

168
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:18,366
These aren't like light bulbs.
You can't turn them on and off.

169
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:20,452
They're complex pieces of machinery

170
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,774
that require
precise shut-down sequences.

171
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:25,999
I don't understand. Why does autopsy
get backup power and I don't?

172
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,376
MTAC, OK, but what does Ducky
have that I don't have?

173
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,670
- Corpses.
- I'll get some corpses.

174
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,418
Okay, I'm gonna start this again.

175
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,715
What do you got?

176
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,926
- Nothing.
- You called me to say you have nothing?

177
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,886
- That's why I called you.
- To say nothing?

178
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:40,576
Well, I have something.
A tire track.

179
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,600
Tony brought the mold down. My babies
could I.D. this thing in like 2 minutes,

180
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:46,990
but at this point, I'm going to have
to do this by hand... by hand!

181
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,564
Do you understand what that means?

182
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:50,774
Maybe you know what that means,
but I just need to know

183
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:53,013
that you know not to expect
my normal miracles.

184
00:10:53,073 --> 00:10:55,153
- Yes.
- Great. I'll see you in an hour.

185
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,543
- So, this makes copies?
- I don't know.

186
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:13,004
For some reason,
I'm flashing back to fourth grade.

187
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:14,506
There's no scanner.

188
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,925
Sister Maryanne thought
I was cheating on my geology test.

189
00:11:18,523 --> 00:11:19,928
Well, maybe this is it.

190
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:25,739
Hey, boss.
Lieutenant Paxton's husband's up

191
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,045
at the conference room.
I was just about to come get you.

192
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:31,662
We are still working on distributing
the BOLO sketch.

193
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:34,555
- E-mail's down.
- We found this in storage.

194
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,945
We're just need to find a brontosaurus
who knows how to use it.

195
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:54,810
Boss, that was very impressive.
McGee, did you get that?

196
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:07,479
One of the men she was with.
It look familiar?

197
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:10,603
With?

198
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,229
What is that supposed to mean?
My wife was a victim here.

199
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:21,528
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:27,924
I don't expect you to understand...

201
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:33,453
but you do,

202
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,253
don't you?

203
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,548
You want answers.

204
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:40,967
I want my wife back.

205
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:45,504
My wife was a proud American.

206
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,265
Third-generation Navy.

207
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,329
One of the good guys.

208
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:52,645
If there is one last thing
I can do for her...

209
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,993
I can bury her...

210
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:03,782
with the full military honors
she deserves.

211
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,276
Spoke to Swiftcast's CEO.

212
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:20,152
They finished
their inventory of the farm

213
00:13:20,212 --> 00:13:22,141
and every other room
the gunmen were in.

214
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,135
- What did they grab?
- Nothing.

215
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:29,223
So why...

216
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,309
was his wife lying dead
on the floor?

217
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,463
Hey, guys, look what I found.

218
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,028
Look at this.

219
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,295
- What's the map for?
- What are you talking about?

220
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:51,454
You can't have a corkboard and no map.
Haven't you ever seen <i>Dragnet</i>?

221
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:54,416
<i>Baretta</i>?

222
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,629
<i>Kojak</i>?
Then this'll mean nothing to you.

223
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:02,280
Who loves ya, baby?

224
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:05,260
Right, boss?
Telly on the Telly?

225
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:08,555
Sorry.

226
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:10,140
So what do we got?

227
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:13,893
A break-in at a facility with
millions-of-dollars worth of equipment,

228
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,000
but nothing appears
to have been stolen.

229
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,647
And nothing left behind.

230
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:21,234
Swiftcast swept for bombs,
bugs, everything. Place is clean.

231
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,675
Alarm was triggered
during the break-in.

232
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:26,485
Maybe the gunmen split
before they got what they came for.

233
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:28,168
Need to find those missing gunmen.

234
00:14:28,393 --> 00:14:31,536
Still waiting on the BOLO,
but our best lead is Lieutenant Paxton.

235
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:33,215
Talk to her CO.

236
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,999
Okay. Sorry about the Kojak, boss.
Talking to her CO.

237
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,146
Excuse me.

238
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:40,733
Where do you think you're going?

239
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:42,833
Didn't you hear the boss?

240
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,967
I'm gonna go talk
to Lieutenant Paxton's CO.

241
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:49,697
Then who is going to go through
her bank and credit card statements?

242
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:51,876
I figured since that was
your area or expertise,

243
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:54,559
you might look through her credit cards
and bank statements.

244
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,975
I don't do hard copies.

245
00:14:58,118 --> 00:14:59,355
Then let's flip for it.

246
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:02,065
Last time we flipped,
you used a trick coin.

247
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:03,735
We'll use your coin.

248
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:04,736
Fine.

249
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:07,989
I flip, you call it in the air.

250
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:10,700
If you touch me,
I automatically win, and...

251
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:13,935
Sorry, McGee.

252
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:23,421
Ah, Jethro.

253
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:26,673
- I was wondering when you'd come down.
- I've been busy, Duck.

254
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:28,108
Yes, I imagine.

255
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,387
I take it you noticed
that the power has gone out?

256
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,920
Yeah.

257
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,557
Well, luckily for me,

258
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,463
the main tool of my trade
does not require electricity.

259
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:38,523
Observation.

260
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:43,024
And what I have observed is
two gunshots fired at close range,

261
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:45,568
both tore through her heart.

262
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,238
They weren't taking
any chances that she'd talk.

263
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,864
She still talks.

264
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:52,686
This contusion here

265
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,740
corroborates the security guard's story
of her capture.

266
00:15:56,976 --> 00:15:59,357
However,
these handcuff bruises are...

267
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,168
far too profound for her
to have done them herself.

268
00:16:02,686 --> 00:16:04,862
Gunmen tried to free her
before they killed her.

269
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,465
Yes, which shows they did it
as a last resort.

270
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:10,875
Which suggests a concern
for her welfare.

271
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,266
Go ahead.

272
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:16,645
With the power out in the rest
of the building,

273
00:16:17,155 --> 00:16:20,061
I offered 107 to the staff.

274
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:24,700
Anything else?

275
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:27,718
Well, you know how I strive
for balance, Jethro,

276
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,855
with two things that I can explain
followed by two that I cannot.

277
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,837
The first,
this swelling of her extremities.

278
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:38,496
Well, there are medical conditions
that would explain such edema,

279
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:40,398
but...

280
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,960
the Lieutenant shows no anatomical
indications of having any of them.

281
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:47,087
- Blood work?
- Well, I sent it out to Abby.

282
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:48,756
But with her Mass Spec down,

283
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:53,058
I think it might be quite some time
before we get results.

284
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:01,144
I would...

285
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,151
The second thing?

286
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,600
I discovered extensive evidence

287
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,739
of severe and widespread trauma:

288
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,784
broken bones, stab wound scars,

289
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:18,703
gunshot wounds.

290
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:20,876
But according to her records...

291
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:22,373
She's never been in combat.

292
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,168
There's more to this woman
than meets the eye, Jethro.

293
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,422
I can't believe it.

294
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:38,681
I just can't believe Emma's dead.

295
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:41,134
When was the last time
you spoke to Lieutenant Paxton?

296
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,479
I mean, yeah, this is the Military,
but this is the entertainment division.

297
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:46,814
When people die here, it's on stage.

298
00:17:47,538 --> 00:17:48,832
Just the facts, ma'am.

299
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:51,402
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:54,739
We last spoke three days ago.

301
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,867
Before she was supposed
to leave for Baghdad?

302
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,412
She wasn't going to Baghdad.

303
00:18:02,677 --> 00:18:05,077
We spoke when she called in sick.

304
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:11,255
Which is kinda
how I'm feeling right now.

305
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:15,233
I'm sorry.
I'm allergic to perfume,

306
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:16,844
and you're wearing quite a bit.

307
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:18,554
I am not wearing any.

308
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,944
I don't have any hot water.

309
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,733
And it's not perfume.
It's Eau de Cologne.

310
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:33,340
Noted.

311
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:35,905
How exactly do you have power?

312
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:39,019
Portable generators.

313
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,255
We deploy them
for concerts overseas.

314
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:45,039
Tony, if Lieutenant Paxton was
never supposed to go to Baghdad...

315
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,291
She was lying to her husband.

316
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:49,043
I know she was to me.

317
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:55,675
She said she was really sick,
she need to stay home a few days.

318
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,937
But an hour later,
I saw her walking down 30th street...

319
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:01,489
with a man.

320
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:03,533
She didn't look sick at all.

321
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,768
Did you get any descriptions?

322
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:07,562
He was a male.

323
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:08,730
A male man.

324
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,233
Anything else?

325
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:14,219
It's okay.

326
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,617
Well, let's get crackin'.

327
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:23,578
How did people survive
before search engines?

328
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,736
Sorry, boss.
I got another paper cut.

329
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,231
Keep 'em.

330
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,778
Thanks, boss.

331
00:19:42,478 --> 00:19:44,724
Almost done going through
these bank statements, I promise.

332
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:56,694
Taking a little break,
are you, DiNozzo?

333
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:58,279
I would very much like to.

334
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,014
We were running down a lead
from Lieutenant Resnick's CO.

335
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,657
More like walking down a lead.

336
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,160
And walking.

337
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:06,473
How did people
survive before e-mail?

338
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:08,564
Needless to say, it was a dead end.

339
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:12,376
Is it possible for feet to die when
they're still connected to your body?

340
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:14,305
I think I've hit a dead end, too.

341
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:16,923
Paxton's credit card
and bank statements are clean.

342
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:19,246
So, basically, we got nothing.

343
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,718
Do blisters count?

344
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,665
Then we have nothing.

345
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:24,100
Speak for yourselves.

346
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,605
I finally I.D.'d the tire tracks
from the Swiftcast getaway car.

347
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:29,181
I got the make and the model.

348
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:30,269
It only took me...

349
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,773
72 times longer
than it usually does.

350
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:35,246
How did people survive before

351
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:38,319
there was pattern-recognizing sparse
representation algorithms?

352
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,196
Did you get my batteries?

353
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,597
Sorry,
the entire city's been de-duracell'd.

354
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,802
We are looking for a Chevy Impala.

355
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,995
Wait, a '99 Chevy Impala?

356
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:50,762
- I'm not sure of the year.
- Why?

357
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:53,233
I've been jonesing
since our links feed went down.

358
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,689
I been listening to the police band
all day until my batteries died.

359
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,215
Got a report here
of an abandoned car

360
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,551
from Baltimore PD, boss.
It's a Chevy Impala.

361
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,401
One of the Swiftcast guards said
he hit the rear window.

362
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:21,336
Engine is cold.

363
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:28,870
Looks like we got a blood trail.

364
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:48,973
Clear.

365
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,113
This is like the Tardis.

366
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:57,965
Tard what?

367
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,805
It's a contraption
that Doctor Who travels through time in.

368
00:22:02,438 --> 00:22:04,464
- Never mind.
- <i>Doctor Who</i>?

369
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:06,426
Who watches that?

370
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:10,660
This is more like <i>Lord of War</i>.

371
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:14,579
Nic Cage movie from a few years back.
Packed with guns.

372
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:17,183
"You have the gun that Rambo use?"

373
00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:18,702
It's a good movie.

374
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:21,630
Take a look at this.

375
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,117
It's our dead woman.

376
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,509
Multiple passports.
Multiple identities.

377
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:28,137
That's a regular
Jason Bourne identi-kit.

378
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:47,122
Not exactly standard-issue
for Military's entertainment division.

379
00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:49,575
I don't know,
I heard showbiz can be pretty rough.

380
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:53,579
Perhaps that would explain why
Lieutenant Paxton has been moonlighting.

381
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:55,904
Yeah, but moonlighting as what?

382
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:57,959
Well, I've used sites
like this before.

383
00:22:58,382 --> 00:23:00,037
Mossad calls them sanctuaries.

384
00:23:00,705 --> 00:23:02,692
Each operative maintains their own

385
00:23:02,752 --> 00:23:04,924
as a place to prepare for their ops.

386
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,051
What, you think Paxton
was running some kind of op?

387
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,636
Well...

388
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,942
I think...

389
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,100
at this point, we should be asking,
who was she running it for?

390
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:17,271
It's got its own generator.

391
00:23:18,992 --> 00:23:21,103
Think I might be able
to get us some answers.

392
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:23,538
All right.

393
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,697
Come on, baby, you can do it.

394
00:23:31,532 --> 00:23:32,827
Well, so much for answers.

395
00:23:33,466 --> 00:23:35,329
I think I just found us
a new question.

396
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,483
They came here in this car.

397
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:46,976
And then, it looks like they left in
a hurry in a second one.

398
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:49,319
Hey, boss,
I feel like Davy Crockett...

399
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:50,850
trackin' 'em down.

400
00:23:52,438 --> 00:23:54,807
Got a second set of tracks.
Abby's gonna be thrilled.

401
00:23:57,424 --> 00:23:58,436
We got something.

402
00:23:59,197 --> 00:24:00,771
Blueprints for Swiftcast.

403
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,065
And the Pepco substation
where the power was cut.

404
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,568
Whatever the plan was,
looks like it was planned here.

405
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:09,113
Husband's not gonna like hearing
he was married to Mata Hari.

406
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:11,998
He's not going to like
what else we found, either.

407
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:15,350
His wife was not the only one
with a fake passport.

408
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,171
You're recording this?

409
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,921
We record all interrogations.

410
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,068
Interrogation?!
You said you just had a few questions.

411
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,552
I just have one.

412
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:39,184
That's not mine.
I've never seen that before in my life.

413
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,854
- It's your picture.
- Yeah. Where'd you get it?

414
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:43,773
Your wife had it.

415
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,968
She kept a container off
of route 50.

416
00:24:46,164 --> 00:24:47,340
Why would my wife...

417
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:06,574
- What do you want me to say?
- The truth.

418
00:25:11,312 --> 00:25:14,345
I told you before,
my wife is the victim here.

419
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,431
You want answers?

420
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:19,892
You're gonna have to give some.

421
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:26,065
Okay, look...

422
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:27,691
It's...

423
00:25:28,505 --> 00:25:30,069
Some things weren't adding up.

424
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:32,991
- How?
- Nothing I could put my finger on.

425
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:35,324
When you live with someone, you just...
You get a feeling.

426
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:37,535
I didn't say anything before because

427
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:39,922
I know Emma was a good person,

428
00:25:39,982 --> 00:25:42,540
and damned if I was gonna give you
help proving otherwise.

429
00:25:42,882 --> 00:25:44,136
But you still had doubts.

430
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:45,819
I don't know what I had.

431
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:47,255
I thought may...

432
00:25:49,811 --> 00:25:52,867
maybe she could have been
cheating on me.

433
00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:54,057
But she wasn't.

434
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:56,606
She wasn't doing anything wrong.
And I can prove it.

435
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,802
How?

436
00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:01,684
I hired a private investigator
to follow her.

437
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:03,936
I have his tapes.

438
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:06,290
You can see for yourself.

439
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:11,141
Little more contrast
on the big screen, please.

440
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:12,646
Little less.

441
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,947
That is perfect.

442
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:18,932
Need any help?

443
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:21,475
No, I do not.

444
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:23,015
You sure?

445
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,250
I mean,
technology's not my thing, but...

446
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,896
Maybe I could be
your techno wingman.

447
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:33,257
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

448
00:26:33,646 --> 00:26:35,718
It means that I've got it covered.

449
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:39,772
So I want you to go do

450
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:41,724
whatever it is that you were doing.

451
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,064
What exactly are you doing, again?

452
00:26:46,128 --> 00:26:49,607
I was hand-filing evidence custody
documents from the crime scene.

453
00:26:50,557 --> 00:26:52,027
Yeah. Have fun with that.

454
00:26:52,555 --> 00:26:54,111
I hope you blow a fuse.

455
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:57,129
Generator can't last forever.

456
00:26:58,175 --> 00:27:00,303
Then you'll be in the dark
with the rest of us.

457
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,881
- I was just...
- Just what?

458
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:15,347
Rubbing it in?

459
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:19,470
Because he left you
with the paperwork earlier?

460
00:27:24,255 --> 00:27:25,372
You found anything?

461
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:29,805
Well, there's hours of video
from the private investigator...

462
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:33,191
Lieutenant Paxton at the park,
getting a manicure, shopping.

463
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,257
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Just as her husband told us.

464
00:27:36,317 --> 00:27:39,990
- You still think he's covering for her?
- His wife's dead and doesn't know why.

465
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:44,620
I spoke to the P.I.
He told him exactly what he told us.

466
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:45,763
Freeze it.

467
00:27:48,185 --> 00:27:49,029
Back it up.

468
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,264
There.

469
00:27:53,812 --> 00:27:56,731
- The guy in the hat?
- That guy was in the street, too.

470
00:27:57,563 --> 00:27:58,450
Back it up.

471
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:02,069
There.

472
00:28:06,777 --> 00:28:07,935
Different days.

473
00:28:11,465 --> 00:28:14,525
Someone else was following her.
Who do you think it was?

474
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:16,697
I don't know.

475
00:28:18,918 --> 00:28:19,918
There.

476
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,470
But we got his prints.
Go pick 'em up.

477
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:24,949
Right off that wall.

478
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:28,988
You sure you wouldn't want Tony
or Ziva to maybe... They want to...

479
00:28:30,051 --> 00:28:30,809
On it.

480
00:28:35,028 --> 00:28:37,381
Latent fingerprints
from the suspect in the park?

481
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:39,904
Check.

482
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:43,123
Fingerprint cards from local LEOs
matching the suspect's description?

483
00:28:43,844 --> 00:28:45,055
- Check.
- Lemons?

484
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:46,724
Did she say lemons?

485
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:49,727
- I hope not. Paper cut.
- But we can't start without the lemons.

486
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:51,320
Lemons, check!

487
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:53,607
Though I still do not understand.

488
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,678
Are we making cocktails?

489
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:58,861
Now I'm the one flashing back
to the fourth grade.

490
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:01,268
Mrs. Johnson's science fair.

491
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:08,398
Lemons!

492
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:09,943
How could I miss that?

493
00:29:11,774 --> 00:29:13,417
Okay, people, it's showtime.

494
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,547
So, careful, I arranged these
alphabetically, so they would all...

495
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,928
DiNozzo, you're whorls.

496
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,015
Arches.

497
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:32,019
Loops.

498
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,247
I'll take the composites.

499
00:29:34,652 --> 00:29:37,003
We'll use the bins
to narrow down the fingerprint cards,

500
00:29:37,063 --> 00:29:38,942
and find a match
to the print from the park.

501
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:47,224
Go.

502
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:02,758
You never see this crap on <i>Columbo</i>.

503
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,404
Is it me or does this
look like a squirrel?

504
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:09,890
I would rather not answer that.

505
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:11,781
Wait. Wait.

506
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:14,642
I got it.

507
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:17,564
- I got a match.
- And it only took all night.

508
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:20,665
Our camera-happy
tourist's name is...

509
00:30:21,142 --> 00:30:22,828
Donavan Graham.

510
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,918
And he looks familiar.

511
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:31,662
That is our gunman
from the break-in.

512
00:30:32,152 --> 00:30:34,421
Small-time hood, used to sell guns,

513
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:36,583
has a reputation as a gun for hire.

514
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:38,898
Well done.

515
00:31:20,258 --> 00:31:21,419
It's Graham.

516
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,965
This must be the other gunman.

517
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,048
His name is Leo Harper.

518
00:31:28,632 --> 00:31:30,179
Appears they were roommates.

519
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:32,264
Until they shot each other.

520
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:34,174
Commander Resnik?

521
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,101
Agent DiNozzo.

522
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:43,157
- I'm impressed.
- So am I.

523
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:47,452
- Did you have some kind of makeover?
- Despite my attempts at diverting you,

524
00:31:47,836 --> 00:31:49,031
here you are.

525
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:53,138
That's Lieutenant Paxton's CO
at AFE.

526
00:31:54,168 --> 00:31:54,995
Not quite.

527
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:01,418
National Security...

528
00:32:02,238 --> 00:32:03,045
Agency?

529
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:07,799
Paxton and I were colleagues
on a highly classified project.

530
00:32:08,216 --> 00:32:09,501
AFE was our cover.

531
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:12,387
This is much bigger than you think.

532
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:25,895
NSA had agreements with all major
biometric security companies

533
00:32:25,955 --> 00:32:28,375
to program a back door
into their iris scanners.

534
00:32:28,742 --> 00:32:31,417
- Boss, "back door" is...
- Yeah, I know what it is, McGee.

535
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:34,305
Paxton was one of two people
whose irises

536
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:36,418
were hard-coded into the devices.

537
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:38,455
Like a master key.

538
00:32:39,436 --> 00:32:40,415
Who's the other?

539
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,091
That is cool.

540
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:52,553
Our eyes can open any lock
protected by any iris scanner.

541
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,501
So, with AFE as your cover,
then you can...

542
00:32:55,561 --> 00:32:57,714
We can travel around the world
without suspicion,

543
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:00,561
assisting other agencies
with covert activities.

544
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,229
Like the Swiftcast break-in.

545
00:33:03,863 --> 00:33:07,776
We have no idea why Paxton
used her ability to break into Swiftcast

546
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:09,778
or what she was trying
to accomplish.

547
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,730
But clearly our mission
has been compromised.

548
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,117
- Her husband?
- Maybe.

549
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:17,712
But I wouldn't read too much
into the fake passport.

550
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,535
Lieutenant Paxton had it created
in case her cover was blown

551
00:33:20,595 --> 00:33:22,367
and they needed to disappear.

552
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,295
But if she has gone rogue, there's no
telling what damage she might've done.

553
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,332
Or was planning to.

554
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:30,726
What are you thinking?

555
00:33:31,337 --> 00:33:33,390
Paxton used her back door
to get into the farm,

556
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,429
so that's not why the power
was knocked out.

557
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:38,307
- Why is it?
- That's why we're so concerned.

558
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:41,038
Power is down.
Communication's hobbled.

559
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:45,230
Tactically, DC is in a very vulnerable
position right now.

560
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,440
We noticed.

561
00:33:47,414 --> 00:33:49,901
Well, we had hoped to get
to the bottom of this in-house.

562
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:52,365
- Yeah, I bet.
- But you and your team

563
00:33:52,425 --> 00:33:54,281
seem to be making more progress
than we are.

564
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:56,950
We need to pool our resources,

565
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,886
find out what the endgame is.

566
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,121
And fast.

567
00:34:00,764 --> 00:34:01,906
Talk to me, Duck.

568
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:05,039
Do I sense increased urgency
in your step?

569
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:07,440
- I need some answers.
- Those I have.

570
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,796
Starting with
whether these two killed each other.

571
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,424
- They didn't.
- Crime scene was staged.

572
00:34:13,198 --> 00:34:15,135
Postmortem lividity suggests

573
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,846
that both bodies were moved
after they were killed.

574
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:21,683
Additionally, though both victims
were shot repeatedly in the chest,

575
00:34:21,983 --> 00:34:23,683
these too were postmortem.

576
00:34:23,743 --> 00:34:26,438
The actual kill shots
were delivered from behind.

577
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:29,733
I imagine their services
were no longer required.

578
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,026
Tying up loose ends.

579
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,778
The question is, who?

580
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:35,822
Well, I don't know, Jim.
Do you have any ideas?

581
00:34:36,137 --> 00:34:37,789
No, sorry. And...

582
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:41,078
It was rhetorical.
The... Never mind.

583
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:45,096
Well, I certainly have no idea
who murdered these gentlemen. But,

584
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:48,060
I can tell you
how this one spent his last hours.

585
00:34:48,691 --> 00:34:49,795
He was digging.

586
00:34:50,193 --> 00:34:52,589
Copious amounts of dirt
beneath his fingernails.

587
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,068
Thanks, Duck.

588
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:59,054
Left agents digging at Graham's place,
I'm sure this is what we're looking for.

589
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,079
We found it under the shed
in the backyard.

590
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:02,140
Open it.

591
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:09,398
It's from the server farm
at Swiftcast.

592
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,357
Except nothing was reported stolen.

593
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:14,094
And nothing was supposedly left behind.
But I think something was.

594
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,737
The gunmen yanked this thing out.

595
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,906
And they put a duplicate
in its place.

596
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,866
- That doesn't make sense.
- Think, McToma.

597
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:21,910
It's a classic cop show switcheroo.

598
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:24,496
You take something
at the target location

599
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,057
and then you swap it
with a bugged copy.

600
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,127
Paxton was bugging the Internet.
Can you do that?

601
00:35:30,477 --> 00:35:32,888
That would explain
why the power was cut.

602
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,257
The only way to swap the server
without it being noticed

603
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,985
would be when the system was down.

604
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:40,554
Which means the blackout
is not a prelude to a terrorist attack.

605
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,712
At least not the kind
that you're thinking of.

606
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:44,748
This connects directly
to the Internet backbone.

607
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:47,161
Every byte
from every government agency

608
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:49,688
that uses the Internet
would be exposed.

609
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:51,277
Which means...?

610
00:35:51,578 --> 00:35:54,651
Our country's entire electronics
infrastructure would be at risk.

611
00:35:57,387 --> 00:36:00,081
She spent a lot of time overseas.
Imagine she met a lot of people

612
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:02,328
- who would pay for the intel.
- I'm sure she did.

613
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,121
But I don't think
she was the one trying to sell it.

614
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:11,394
So, I finally finished running
Lieutenant Paxton's blood work.

615
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:16,004
Smell anything?

616
00:36:16,438 --> 00:36:17,790
- Whiskey.
- Good.

617
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:25,432
It's nonalcoholic,
but I needed that.

618
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,894
I have not manually distilled
this much plasma

619
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:32,397
since the mass spec in high school
blew a Friedrich condenser.

620
00:36:34,522 --> 00:36:37,684
That's actually really funny
if you have a PhD in chemistry.

621
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:40,947
Paxton's blood work.

622
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:44,910
She recently ingested massive amounts
of a vasodilator.

623
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:47,178
It's prescribed
for high blood pressure.

624
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,235
That explains the swelling
that Ducky found.

625
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:51,386
Suicide attempt?

626
00:36:51,446 --> 00:36:54,169
The drug is nonlethal,
so that wouldn't be smart.

627
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:57,214
I think that she was attempting
something way smarter.

628
00:36:58,455 --> 00:36:59,456
Tell me...

629
00:37:00,476 --> 00:37:01,494
What do you see?

630
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,477
Your eyeball.

631
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:04,930
Blood vessels.

632
00:37:05,652 --> 00:37:07,349
Every person has a specific pattern.

633
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:09,935
That's what allows an iris scanner
to identify you.

634
00:37:10,472 --> 00:37:11,715
Now, Paxton knew that.

635
00:37:11,974 --> 00:37:14,044
Commander Resnick said
that they are forbidden

636
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:15,770
from taking any kind of vasodilator,

637
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,109
because of the affects it has
on the vessels in their eyes.

638
00:37:18,386 --> 00:37:20,445
- Paxton tried to OD on one.
- I think...

639
00:37:20,904 --> 00:37:24,574
she was hoping to block her ability
to unlock an iris scanner.

640
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:28,219
She wasn't part of the break-in.

641
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,189
She was trying to stop it.

642
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:35,232
I identified her prints
at Graham's place,

643
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:36,732
but only in the bathroom.

644
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:40,320
So, I think that she was kidnapped,
and then the kidnapper held her there.

645
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,895
And she fought back
with the only thing available...

646
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,263
What was
in the kidnapper's medicine cabinet.

647
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:49,057
It didn't work,
but a-plus for the MacGyver.

648
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:52,060
The label's peeled off,
but I know who this belongs to.

649
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,022
I found traces of this drug from a blood
swabbed at the Swiftcast shoot-out.

650
00:37:56,656 --> 00:37:57,474
Who?

651
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:06,116
Do you recognize him?

652
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,262
I couldn't see the face,

653
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,370
but I remember those eyes.

654
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:12,414
I think he shot me.
Who is he?

655
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,082
Lieutenant Paxton's husband.

656
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:15,155
Husband?

657
00:38:15,465 --> 00:38:16,918
A real-life Bonnie and Clyde.

658
00:38:18,282 --> 00:38:19,661
You're sure that's him?

659
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,029
Gibbs, we have forensic evidence,

660
00:38:24,447 --> 00:38:26,720
now we have an eyewitness.
It's enough to make the arrest.

661
00:38:28,746 --> 00:38:30,473
Let me know
when you need me to testify.

662
00:38:35,465 --> 00:38:36,516
Nice timing!

663
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,218
Wizards are playing tonight.

664
00:38:42,502 --> 00:38:43,720
Not a moment too soon.

665
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:45,556
Enjoy your sandwich.

666
00:39:10,456 --> 00:39:13,217
Ladies and gentlemen,
the story you are about to hear is true.

667
00:39:13,277 --> 00:39:15,697
Only the names have been changed
to protect the innocent.

668
00:39:16,406 --> 00:39:17,698
It is something you're not.

669
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:19,877
You got a buyer yet
for all those zeros and ones?

670
00:39:20,623 --> 00:39:24,154
Getting shot during the break-in
to divert suspicion was a nice touch.

671
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:26,738
- Till it bit you in the ass.
- Had your blood from the crime scene.

672
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,709
You should really watch
your blood pressure.

673
00:39:30,587 --> 00:39:33,536
Next time you kidnap someone, keep
them away from your medicine cabinet.

674
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:35,694
Book 'em, Dan-Nozzo.

675
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:38,208
Nice <i>Hawaii Five-O</i> reference, boss.
What are you looking at?

676
00:39:43,035 --> 00:39:44,047
Red-handed?

677
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,122
They don't come much redder.

678
00:39:47,898 --> 00:39:48,699
Kill it.

679
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:58,436
Who is he?

680
00:39:58,835 --> 00:40:00,563
Dimitri Verenikin.

681
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,934
Used to work
for Russian counterintelligence,

682
00:40:03,994 --> 00:40:05,151
until two years ago.

683
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:07,570
And then he decided to freelance.

684
00:40:08,024 --> 00:40:11,506
We think he learned about your wife
while she was on an op in Kiev.

685
00:40:11,923 --> 00:40:14,166
And he found an asset
he could exploit.

686
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:17,437
With the National Security Data
she gave him access to,

687
00:40:18,313 --> 00:40:20,125
he could name his price
to our enemies.

688
00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:22,377
Your wife tried to stop him.

689
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:25,780
And when she couldn't,
she cuffed herself during the break-in.

690
00:40:26,783 --> 00:40:29,069
She knew we'd find her body.
She knew we'd dig deeper.

691
00:40:30,615 --> 00:40:32,834
There's a lot I never knew
about Emma,

692
00:40:33,952 --> 00:40:36,122
but one thing's for sure,
she was a fighter.

693
00:40:37,707 --> 00:40:38,977
Stubborn as hell.

694
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:44,774
Been there.

695
00:40:45,178 --> 00:40:46,514
Emma had to do it, right?

696
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:50,019
- She didn't have a choice.
- No, she had a choice.

697
00:40:54,649 --> 00:40:56,101
That's what makes her a hero.

698
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,041
A hero.

699
00:41:03,165 --> 00:41:04,717
High-tech case,

700
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:07,554
low-tech ass-kicking.

701
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:10,016
Kind of ironic.

702
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:14,732
You know,

703
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:17,474
I actually kind
of enjoy being unplugged.

704
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,472
Gives you time to think.

705
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:20,810
Slow down.

706
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,832
No e-mails to return.

707
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:23,938
No spam.

708
00:41:25,752 --> 00:41:26,754
It's nice.

709
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:38,603
It's alive!
