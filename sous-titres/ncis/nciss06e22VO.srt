<i>Acquiring Blackbird. East on Ocean,
turning north onto Linden.</i>

3
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:19,596
Traffic camera acquisition.

4
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:22,109
Leaving <i>Pictometry</i>,
going live in five...

5
00:00:27,073 --> 00:00:28,305
Blackbird acquired.

6
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:31,450
Crossing to the east side
of the street, Sam.

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,575
You got him?

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,234
I got him.

9
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:43,296
We have a visual, Kensi.

10
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,839
Hey, welcome to the party, Mace.

11
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:49,592
Repositioning.

12
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:51,302
Back to me at the intersection.

13
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:54,222
Ease up, Kensi.
You don't want to get there first.

14
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:07,277
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Blackbird under fire!

15
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:10,307
All units, close up.
Close up. Shots fired.

16
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:16,244
<i>- Get me another angle.
- Working on it, Mace.</i>

17
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:27,338
Kensi, behind you!

18
00:01:33,138 --> 00:01:34,684
Get Chandler. Go, go!

19
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:37,562
I need a GPS heading.

20
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:39,350
GPS transmitter's in the briefcase.

21
00:01:39,888 --> 00:01:41,519
<i>We need a visual on Chandler, Sam.</i>

22
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:44,261
It's a negative, Mace.

23
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:45,638
Blackbird has flown.

24
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,341
Crap!

29
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,268
Tony, I'm not arguing with you.

30
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:21,920
- You're arguing now.
- No, I'm not.

31
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,890
- Yes, you are.
- This is not an argument.

32
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,634
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

33
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:27,010
Yes, it is.

34
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,490
Hold on a second.

35
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,110
Ziva David's phone.

36
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:34,704
She's not here right now.
Actually she is just walking in.

37
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,992
 Man, deep voice, slightly accented,
six-three, 200 pounds,

38
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:39,588
Prada suit, Italian shoes,

39
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:41,870
standing on the north side
of the street, looking for Ziva.

40
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,978
Thank you, Tony.

41
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:51,395
For what were we arguing
about before?

42
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,298
We were not arguing.

43
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,438
Oh, that. Yes, we were.

44
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,421
Do you understand that that's
what we were arguing about...

45
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:01,107
the fact that you will argue
about the least little thing?

46
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:04,185
Sometimes you will argue about nothing
at all. You just want to argue.

47
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,333
That's not arguing, McContrary.

48
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:08,147
Come on, have a little insight.

49
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:09,324
It's called banter.

50
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:10,485
No, it is not.

51
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:12,694
Banter is lighthearted,
witty repartee.

52
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:14,259
Go on.

53
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:19,290
It's your turn
to get the coffee. Go.

54
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:20,660
Don't argue, DiNozzo.

55
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:22,245
Can't we all just get along?

56
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:25,540
Coffee can wait, McGee.

57
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,083
Dead Marine can't.

58
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:31,296
Long-distance can be hard.
Tele-friend from Tel Aviv?

59
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:33,081
- You're jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

60
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:34,339
- Yes, you are.
- No.

61
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:35,466
I'm not arguing.

62
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,717
Are, too.

63
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:37,594
Am not.

64
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,740
"X" marks the spot.

65
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:07,721
Private First Class
Nick Francis Chandler.

66
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,185
Camp Pendleton, California.

67
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:10,655
His left shoe is missing.

68
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,449
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

69
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:18,010
Get a load of this, McSnapper.

70
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:22,562
Boarding pass.
Los Angeles to DC.

71
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:23,857
Arrived this morning.

72
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:25,892
Those red-eye flights can be murder.

73
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,730
What a marvelous view!

74
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:35,178
The sweep of early American History
at a single glance.

75
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:38,529
From the Potomac
to the Capital Dome.

76
00:04:40,194 --> 00:04:43,766
I doubt this fellow took
any enjoyment from it.

77
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:46,746
Construction workers found him
when they arrived to work at 8:00 a.m.

78
00:04:46,928 --> 00:04:48,748
Guessing the flight arrived
around 6:00 a.m.

79
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,708
Half an hour from the airport.

80
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:54,654
20 minutes for the tie and fry.
Puts time of death around 7:00 a.m.

81
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:57,507
11 minutes past to be precise.

82
00:04:57,887 --> 00:04:59,592
He's not the only thing
that was fried.

83
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:05,473
24-volt battery. It's not enough
voltage to electrocute him.

84
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:07,849
It's enough to suffocate him,
Timothy.

85
00:05:08,116 --> 00:05:09,216
He was suffocated?

86
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,771
The application
of a sustained current

87
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:13,439
across the chest causes

88
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,224
tetanic contraction
of the respiratory muscles.

89
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,820
The diaphragm
and the intercostals seize up.

90
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:21,522
I mean,
this poor fellow would have been...

91
00:05:21,742 --> 00:05:24,484
fully conscious
and yet unable to speak.

92
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,723
Death by suffocation.

93
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:30,266
It's a particularly excruciating,

94
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:33,166
terrifying and slow way to die.

95
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:34,692
Wanted him to suffer.

96
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:36,698
Or talk.

97
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:41,050
Chandler was deployed to Kuwait.
Got back yesterday.

98
00:05:41,432 --> 00:05:42,714
Humanitarian leave.

99
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:44,036
Service records?

100
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:45,038
Exemplary.

101
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:46,962
Not so much as a scuffed boot.

102
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,709
Chandler bought
his airline ticket at the gate.

103
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,349
No checked luggage.
Man in a hurry to get somewhere.

104
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:54,021
Or away from someone.

105
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:54,975
Car rental?

106
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:57,597
Booked a car in flight with a credit
card but did not pick it up.

107
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,610
- Someone else picked him up first.
- Boss, we've got some activity here.

108
00:06:00,691 --> 00:06:02,536
We are not the only ones
looking at Chandler.

109
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,033
A BOLO's been issued out
of Los Angeles, nationwide alert.

110
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:06,159
LAPD?

111
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:07,618
Negative.

112
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:11,873
Who issued the BOLO, McGee?

113
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:14,167
We did.

114
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:18,035
It's NCIS.

115
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,222
<i>All units close up. Close up.</i>

116
00:06:28,393 --> 00:06:30,716
<i>Shots fired. Give me another angle.
Working on it, Mace.</i>

117
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:34,771
Chandler's mother was beaten half
to death in a home invasion last week.

118
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,774
Before he left Kuwait, someone gave him
a quarter of a million dollars.

119
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,687
Told him if he delivered it
to an address in Los Angeles,

120
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:43,863
they wouldn't go back
and finish the job on his mother.

121
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:47,700
He was an easy target.
He was an only child.

122
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:50,328
A local informant tipped off
our field office.

123
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:52,707
We were waiting
when he got off his flight.

124
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:54,711
He agreed to work with us.

125
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:57,043
But on the way to make the drop,
somebody took a shot at him.

126
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,564
The kid panicked.

127
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:02,563
Tried to get home to see his mother
in West Virginia, got as far as DC.

128
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,826
Not just about a dead Marine, Leon.

129
00:07:05,184 --> 00:07:09,038
I got a bad feeling about an arms-deal
case we're investigating in Los Angeles.

130
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,391
You think the two cases are linked?

131
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,950
Go find out.

132
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,224
Pair up with them.
Take somebody with you.

133
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:17,146
- San Diego office?
- Los Angeles.

134
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:18,532
OSP.

135
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:19,974
They have the lead.

136
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,348
- Macy still the agent in charge there?
- You got a problem?

137
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:27,354
She might.

138
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,332
Well, you're on the same team.
Work it out.

139
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:33,577
<i>It's a negative, Mace.</i>

140
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:34,958
<i>Blackbird has flown.</i>

141
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:40,301
He got a name?

142
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:41,104
Who?

143
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:43,121
- Star of David.
- Oh, him.

144
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,842
Yes, he has a name.

145
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,092
Trevor? Bruce?

146
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:50,121
- Marmaduke?
- Michael.

147
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:53,540
Sounded more like a Bruce
than a Michael on the phone.

148
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,142
Okay, grab your toothbrush.

149
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,347
- Road trip?
- Los Angeles.

150
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:59,355
Californ-i-a.
What time do we leave?

151
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:00,870
Not we.

152
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:04,110
McGee? Not me?

153
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:05,611
McGoo, you?

154
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:09,783
Joint operation with OSP.
Chandler case.

155
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,447
I need you to follow up here.

156
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,828
Pick up's in 45.

157
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:17,886
OSP?

158
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:21,076
Office of Special Projects.
NCIS undercover.

159
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,254
- Surveillance.
- Super cool toys.

160
00:08:25,612 --> 00:08:26,966
After our last trip to L.A.,

161
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:29,719
I do not understand
why you would think I would be such

162
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,880
an eager platypus, Tony.

163
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,807
Beaver. Eager beaver.
Not platypus.

164
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:39,337
Why does that bother me so much?
Don't answer that.

165
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:40,601
Answer that.

166
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,290
Shalom.

167
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:56,141
Well, Tony, I guess the boss knows
who's got his back.

168
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:59,540
Not just his back,
McProbie, his ears as well.

169
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,414
What are you talking about the ears?

170
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,320
The aeroplane...
five-and-a-half hours flying time.

171
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,858
You're going to have to chew the fat,
McChitty-Chat.

172
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:08,608
What are you going
to talk to him about?

173
00:09:08,873 --> 00:09:10,843
- I've got to talk to him?
- Oh, yeah.

174
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,332
Small talk.

175
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:14,137
Better brush up
on your boat building.

176
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:16,014
Maybe pick up a copy
of Sniper Monthly.

177
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:19,268
Seriously, don't mention marriage,
divorce or Vance.

178
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:23,647
- Cover for me?
- What?

179
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:25,904
- When will you be back?
- Soon.

180
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:27,817
Later.

181
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:41,174
You do, or you did?

182
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,543
Okay, I'll do that.

183
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:44,581
You, too.

184
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:45,728
Ciao.

185
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:49,696
- That was weird.
- What's weird, Abs?

186
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:52,509
Special Projects in Los Angeles...

187
00:09:52,754 --> 00:09:56,263
they just e-mailed me confirming
their interest in our "X" man.

188
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,057
- PFC Chandler.
- That's him.

189
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:01,187
Special Agent Macy?

190
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:04,730
That's her. She wants me
to copy her on all my findings.

191
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,109
You know her.

192
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:11,487
Not a question, Gibbs.
You know her.

193
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,736
You find out anything, Abs,

194
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:16,200
you contact me first,
and then you can send it on to her.

195
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:18,119
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yeah.

196
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,211
That's what I came here
to tell you... Los Angeles.

197
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,539
Into the lioness' den?

198
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:23,417
I'm taking McGee.

199
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,628
It's just...

200
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:31,966
the last time you guys went to L.A.,
one of you didn't come back.

201
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,012
I'll bring him home.

202
00:10:36,274 --> 00:10:37,188
Just...

203
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:40,725
make sure
you bring yourself back, too.

204
00:10:41,778 --> 00:10:44,002
Did he use a credit card for that?

205
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:46,055
<i>Yes, he used a credit card
for the call.</i>

206
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:54,363
So he just made one call
from the airphone, huh?

207
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:55,729
Okay.

208
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,110
Yeah, that's all I need to know.
Thanks. Bye.

209
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,314
Hi, I'm not keeping you
from anything, am I?

210
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,023
Like work?

211
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:32,360
Tony, I'm working on something.
I'm following a lead.

212
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:34,820
A lead? On Chandler?

213
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,655
It might not come to anything.

214
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:38,991
Care to share?

215
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:41,785
Tony, I cannot talk, I have to go.

216
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:42,898
Go!

217
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:48,725
Gone.

218
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:58,751
I do not want to lie to him,
Michael.

219
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,262
A small lie.

220
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,595
Your father sends his love.

221
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:08,978
What else does my father send?

222
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:15,353
Me.

223
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:47,761
Boss, you sure
this is the right place?

224
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:58,481
Hi.

225
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:02,992
- Welcome to OSP. I'm Kensi.
- Special Agent Gibbs.

226
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:04,815
Agent McGee.

227
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,386
You sail, Agent McGee?

228
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:08,388
No.

229
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,066
Build boats?

230
00:13:10,126 --> 00:13:11,959
No, it's a conversation starter.

231
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,760
Works.

232
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,755
You guys get
any sleep on the flight?

233
00:13:15,843 --> 00:13:16,847
Not a wink.

234
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,466
Slept the whole way.

235
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,254
Been here before?

236
00:13:22,314 --> 00:13:23,605
- Yeah.
- No.

237
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:31,219
Buckle up.

238
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:34,100
<i>NSA is worried about
the Horn of Africa.</i>

239
00:13:34,838 --> 00:13:36,104
<i>Somalia, in particular.</i>

240
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:37,401
Increased chatter?

241
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,133
<i>Opposite. Suddenly,
all they're hearing is crickets.</i>

242
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:43,502
Maybe the bad guys have
all given up and gone home.

243
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:46,610
<i>Or maybe they're
on their way over here.</i>

244
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,594
<i>You tell Gibbs to call me
when he arrives.</i>

245
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,999
Well, you can tell him yourself.

246
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:56,846
Hello, Director Vance.

247
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:59,507
<i>I know how excited
you two are about working together.</i>

248
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:06,430
<i>I told SecNav I'd have
my best people on this one.</i>

249
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:09,517
<i>A lot of nervous people
at the Pentagon.</i>

250
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:11,685
<i>Don't make me have
to come out there.</i>

251
00:14:22,282 --> 00:14:23,870
He told you I got the lead?

252
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:25,828
Yeah, he told me.

253
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,016
You still drink coffee?

254
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:40,005
It's everything
we know about Chandler.

255
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:45,469
- How's his mother?
- She wants her son.

256
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:49,014
- What was the op?
- Follow the money.

257
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:51,626
Put a GPS locator in his briefcase.

258
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,608
Shadowed him to the rendezvous.

259
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:55,475
Didn't have a lot of time
to set it up.

260
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:57,523
Someone was running
counter surveillance.

261
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:59,483
Whoever he was going to meet

262
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:01,918
took him out to protect themselves.

263
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:04,550
Your team...

264
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:07,011
- got made.
- My team didn't get made.

265
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:08,492
You said...

266
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:09,993
it was a rushed job.

267
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,184
And you've never had
a blown surveillance op?

268
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:14,832
Who was he meeting with?

269
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:16,624
Someone called Liam.

270
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:18,801
How's this tied to the arms deal
you're investigating?

271
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:21,967
Max Talia is brokering the arms deal,
paid in cash.

272
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:24,216
Says the money's coming
in from overseas.

273
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:28,804
Not much of a connection.

274
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:33,843
You have met Talia?

275
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:35,269
Meet's in a couple of hours.

276
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,474
Local diner.

277
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,371
Undercover. It's what we do.

278
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,070
A word of advice, Jethro.

279
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:47,948
Let me do my job.

280
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:53,287
Like you did the first time we met?

281
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:57,290
That is not coffee.

282
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,384
They're all set at the diner.

283
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,178
Callen?

284
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:11,292
Haven't seen him... yet.

285
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:17,823
Get out of my head, Nate.

286
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,481
Operational psychologist.
It's my job to be in your head.

287
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:22,524
So, Gibbs...

288
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,902
- You want to talk about him?
- No.

289
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,654
Well, he doesn't trust you.

290
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,608
Body language screamed it.
He couldn't wait to leave.

291
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:33,079
Nate, you just passed him
in the doorway.

292
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,674
You should have slept
with him way back then...

293
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:38,374
whenever then was.

294
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,482
I was probably
in elementary school, yeah?

295
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:41,803
How do you know I didn't?

296
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:44,129
- I can tell you right now...
- Don't answer that.

297
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:45,130
Okay, cool.

298
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,858
- You scare me.
- Yup.

299
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:47,830
Leave.

300
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,719
Find Callen.

301
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:52,894
Yeah, right.

302
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:05,734
Hey, DiNozzo,
tell me you got something.

303
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:08,570
No luck with the security
footage at the airport.

304
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:10,232
<i>Chandler got lost in the crowd.</i>

305
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:13,409
<i>The truck batteries used for the fry-up
are cheap Chinese imports.</i>

306
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,744
- Thousands sold every year.
- That's what you haven't got.

307
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:19,622
Also checking similar M.O.'s.
Guys knew what they were doing.

308
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:23,226
- Means they've done it before, <i>right</i>?
- We're looking for a guy named Liam.

309
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,563
Liam.

310
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:25,837
Got it.

311
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:31,427
She's following up on a lead.

312
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:35,110
Looks like it didn't go anywhere.

313
00:17:35,982 --> 00:17:39,101
- <i>How was the flight, boss?</i>
- Swell. McGee kept me entertained.

314
00:17:40,984 --> 00:17:43,783
He is full of surprises.
Well done, that man.

315
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:45,880
- <i>Stay on it.</i>
- Will do, boss.

316
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,665
You done with that?

317
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:50,571
Yeah, I'm done.

318
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:51,989
No, stay.

319
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:55,993
Keep 'em company.
I'm visiting a friend.

320
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,083
I'm sorry about yesterday.

321
00:18:03,503 --> 00:18:06,002
That's okay.
I like to keep insanely busy.

322
00:18:06,238 --> 00:18:07,504
I said I was sorry.

323
00:18:08,474 --> 00:18:10,841
The lead did not lead anywhere.

324
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:13,128
Don't sweat on it.

325
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:17,723
No problemo, Davido.

326
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:22,468
Meeting's at the diner
at Venice Beach.

327
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:24,516
We'll be taking feeds
from four cameras.

328
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:29,109
We have a traffic cam
at the intersection.

329
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:31,276
We have a store security cam
across the street,

330
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,363
two pre-placed minis
inside the diner.

331
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:34,990
- We up?
- Coming on stream.

332
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:37,326
- Kensi?
- 15 minutes out.

333
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:38,535
Kickoff's in 30.

334
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:39,495
Callen?

335
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:46,487
Who's Callen?

336
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:55,246
Still building
that boat in your basement?

337
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,491
- Yeah.
- The same one?

338
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:59,306
No, no.
A different one.

339
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,933
Two boats.
Three wives.

340
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,102
Four...

341
00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:04,997
wives.

342
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,067
Did you see Mace?

343
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,577
Yeah, I saw her.

344
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:17,441
You have a long memory.

345
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:20,125
So, how are you, Callen?

346
00:19:21,088 --> 00:19:21,988
Not bad.

347
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,220
Even bordering on good some days.

348
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:28,342
You still looking, huh?

349
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:29,748
I'm still looking.

350
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,466
Is there a reason we're not meeting
in a bar right now?

351
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,590
Well, yeah,
it's 10:00 in the morning.

352
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,397
I don't know what's worse,

353
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:43,568
getting older or getting wiser?

354
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:04,538
It was a good game, but,

355
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:07,462
the striker never should have been
red-carded.

356
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:09,945
Might have mentioned
you were undercover.

357
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,062
Well, I'm not.

358
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:12,612
Just for her.

359
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:14,798
She lives across the street from me.

360
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,026
Just got here from St. Petersburg.

361
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:18,171
Lonely.

362
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,453
Figure if she thinks I'm Russian Mafia,
she won't want to make friends.

363
00:20:26,348 --> 00:20:28,163
Sometimes you get weeks
to plan them,

364
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,272
sometimes a day.

365
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:34,484
Meeting an arms dealer named Talia.
Doesn't trust anyone.

366
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:36,120
I don't like our chances.

367
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,447
Kind of like
that first op in Serbia.

368
00:20:39,276 --> 00:20:40,981
You saved my ass on that one.

369
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,975
- That was Moscow.
- No, no.

370
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,841
My ass did not need saving
in Moscow.

371
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:48,342
That was Petrov.
Petrov's ass always needed saving.

372
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:49,750
Worked with some good people.

373
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:52,548
Yup. Made some good friends.

374
00:20:53,214 --> 00:20:54,264
Lost a few.

375
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:04,550
Next time, we park in a bar.

376
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:06,308
No more BOLO in the park.

377
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:08,101
Next time.

378
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,904
Camera two is up in the diner.

379
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:21,281
Camera two recording.

380
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:25,952
We're getting this call?

381
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:26,880
Trying.

382
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:30,999
Caller's a cell number...
cheap throwaway.

383
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:32,903
Bringing up the outside links.

384
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:36,820
Camera three and four are up.

385
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:43,778
Game time.

386
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,098
Callen, where the hell are you?

387
00:21:46,178 --> 00:21:47,224
<i>At the diner.</i>

388
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,059
<i>Looking right at you, Mace.</i>

389
00:21:52,493 --> 00:21:53,480
Hey, Eric...

390
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,941
<i>this wire itches.</i>

391
00:21:58,076 --> 00:21:59,319
Need a sound check, G.

392
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:00,629
<i>18 years.</i>

393
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:05,416
Wouldn't kill you to cut Gibbs
a little bit of slack, <i>Mace.</i>

394
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,871
Honk once if you can hear me, Sam.

395
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:12,887
Hadley... horn... once.

396
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:28,348
He's in.
Street's clear.

397
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,368
<i>You Talia?</i>

398
00:22:41,565 --> 00:22:42,390
<i>Yeah.</i>

399
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:48,827
My cousin had a diner...

400
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,103
in Chicago.

401
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:52,914
Not like this, though.

402
00:22:53,116 --> 00:22:54,708
Old-style booths and...

403
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:56,868
what do you call them?
Soda fountains.

404
00:22:58,764 --> 00:23:00,797
His roaches probably ran
a little bigger, too.

405
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,164
Hygiene wasn't
one of cousin Mario's strong points.

406
00:23:09,392 --> 00:23:11,183
Acquaintance tells me
you're in the market.

407
00:23:12,222 --> 00:23:13,268
And who are you?

408
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,854
Somebody who can get you
what you want.

409
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:19,092
I don't know you.

410
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,464
I come very highly recommended,

411
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:23,361
or you wouldn't be here.

412
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:27,531
Friend of a friend of some lowlife.

413
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,330
Exactly.

414
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:31,159
We all take some risk.

415
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:34,748
- So what do you need?
- Not me, a client.

416
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,696
Okay.

417
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:39,502
What does your client need?

418
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:42,370
- He needs toys.
- Hunting rifles?

419
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:44,654
Shotguns? BB guns?
What?

420
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:48,254
He's thinking more Fourth of July.

421
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:50,930
Big toys.

422
00:23:58,618 --> 00:23:59,606
You wired?

423
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:03,527
What?

424
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,864
I said are you wired?

425
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:10,897
Are you?

426
00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:17,791
When?

427
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:19,084
Tomorrow.

428
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,710
- Can't happen.
- Look,

429
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:25,757
"no" is not a word
my client understands.

430
00:24:26,156 --> 00:24:27,929
Then let me explain it to him.

431
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,930
Excuse me, sir. The gentleman over there
asked me to give you this.

432
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:52,993
Buzz off.

433
00:24:53,813 --> 00:24:55,588
- What?
- You heard me.

434
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:56,955
I said buzz off.

435
00:24:57,036 --> 00:24:58,790
Op's over.
Time to get him out of there.

436
00:24:59,996 --> 00:25:01,293
<i>We're done.</i>

437
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:10,397
You know,

438
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:13,909
it's not your client
you should be worried about.

439
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:29,905
Got playback on Talia's call.

440
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:31,740
Go.

441
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,117
<i>I know, I know.</i>

442
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,411
<i>Look, I'm working on it.</i>

443
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,864
<i>Look, just give me
a few more days...</i>

444
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:42,959
<i>and you can...
everything you want, Liam.</i>

445
00:25:43,313 --> 00:25:44,419
Quality sucks, Mace.

446
00:25:44,822 --> 00:25:46,838
Replay, isolate the last word.

447
00:25:51,128 --> 00:25:53,071
<i>... everything you want, Liam.</i>

448
00:25:53,324 --> 00:25:55,162
<i>... everything you want, Liam.</i>

449
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:57,666
There's our connection.
Same guy Chandler was meeting.

450
00:25:58,627 --> 00:25:59,768
Same guy.

451
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,319
Chandler was coerced into smuggling
a quarter million dollars

452
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,574
from Kuwait by this guy Liam.

453
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,950
- Wiring it to a bank would be easier.
- Would have left a paper trail.

454
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,729
And at the same time,
Liam approaches Talia,

455
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:20,205
asking him to get him
some serious fire power.

456
00:26:20,844 --> 00:26:23,541
- Cash, weapons...
- And a deadline.

457
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:26,265
You have a plan, Special Agent Macy?

458
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,757
Talia's the plan.

459
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:34,719
Will you give Agents Gibbs
and McGee a full brief of the operation.

460
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:36,263
Include Renko.

461
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:37,884
Sure thing.

462
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:47,551
18 years.

463
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:51,486
Would have made you a lieutenant
in the Marine Corps, Military Police.

464
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,531
- Gibbs was still a gunny...
- Don't go there.

465
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,194
Did you work on a case together?

466
00:26:57,656 --> 00:26:58,917
Why do you want to know?

467
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:01,204
Just looking out for my family.

468
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:03,081
G, you don't have any family.

469
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:05,831
- That's cold, Mace.
- But true.

470
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,057
Gibbs is family.

471
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:11,631
You, too.

472
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,956
Got any photographs in uniform?

473
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:19,368
Yes. And no,

474
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:21,224
you can't see them.

475
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,048
Okay.

476
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:26,913
I'll just ask Gibbs what happened.

477
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,941
Yeah, let me know if you do.

478
00:27:31,952 --> 00:27:34,070
I want to be there to see him
sit you on your ass.

479
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:40,553
He can be very disconcerting,
can't he?

480
00:27:40,634 --> 00:27:43,636
Popping up behind you just
when you have something to give him.

481
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:46,385
- Man's a mind reader.
- Pretend you're him.

482
00:27:47,442 --> 00:27:48,662
What you got, Duck?

483
00:27:49,071 --> 00:27:50,734
That's very good.

484
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:53,590
The dreaded paper chase, Jethro.

485
00:27:54,182 --> 00:27:56,091
I need your signature.

486
00:27:56,172 --> 00:27:57,996
Okay, well,
I'm gonna stop being Jethro

487
00:27:58,056 --> 00:28:00,484
and revert to being plain
old very Special Agent...

488
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:02,307
Anthony DiNozzo.

489
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,366
- Where do I sign?
- All seven pages.

490
00:28:05,974 --> 00:28:09,481
And while you sign, you can tell me
why you came down here to see me.

491
00:28:11,988 --> 00:28:13,485
Personal, not professional.

492
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,640
It's not what you think.

493
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,781
I'm not thinking anything.
What are you thinking?

494
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,824
I'm thinking
she's worried about something.

495
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:23,827
She seems distracted.

496
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,081
Yes, well, we all get distracted.
Keep signing.

497
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:32,628
She ever talk to you about what she did
when she went back to Israel?

498
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:33,799
No.

499
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:37,258
She was involved
in an undercover operation in Morocco.

500
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,052
Yeah, I know all about that.

501
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:41,179
She almost died.

502
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,266
Really? I didn't know about that.

503
00:28:46,296 --> 00:28:49,020
There was a glimpse of her
on some newsreel footage

504
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:50,730
after the bomb blast.

505
00:28:51,557 --> 00:28:54,702
- If she's distracted...
- I'm just probably overreacting.

506
00:28:54,762 --> 00:28:55,931
And look at that!

507
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:57,246
Done and done.

508
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:01,015
Anything else I should know about?

509
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:05,017
Cause of death was indeed suffocation,
brought about by electric shock.

510
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,206
Numerous contusions
and bruising suggests

511
00:29:08,585 --> 00:29:12,493
that he was forcibly abducted
before he was strung up and tortured.

512
00:29:14,397 --> 00:29:15,489
Lovely.

513
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,173
And there was skin.

514
00:29:18,205 --> 00:29:19,259
On the rope.

515
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:21,719
Abby found epithelial tissue,

516
00:29:22,598 --> 00:29:25,328
which suggests that the man
for whom you are looking

517
00:29:25,945 --> 00:29:29,640
will have a rather nasty rope burn
on one of his hands.

518
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,385
- So which case is this exactly?
- My case.

519
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:05,847
Special investigation.
Top secret.

520
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:08,454
I'm not even gonna ask.

521
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,026
Does it have anything
to do with Ziva?

522
00:30:12,225 --> 00:30:15,293
- You said you weren't gonna ask.
- Okay, I won't ask. Just tell me.

523
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:18,896
Got a match.

524
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:20,744
Immigration photo.

525
00:30:21,244 --> 00:30:23,210
Michael Aaron Rivkin.

526
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,659
Israeli citizen, lives in Tel Aviv,
works for a bank,

527
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:29,245
and flew into D.C. two days ago.

528
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:32,335
Is that the answer to the question
I'm not allowed to ask?

529
00:30:32,742 --> 00:30:34,569
Depends.
Any more photos?

530
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,095
Right there. You see it?
A flash.

531
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,022
It's a reflection in a car window.

532
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,693
It's a reflection of a flash.

533
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:46,807
Can you pull up
the bullet trajectory data?

534
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:56,194
Boss, I really got
to get one of these.

535
00:30:57,053 --> 00:30:59,526
Obviously, budgets permitting.

536
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:01,318
It's a single source.

537
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:02,961
Shooter was in the street.

538
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:04,221
Or in the car.

539
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:10,495
Let's pull up LM-Safe, see if there are
any other camera angles we can access.

540
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,623
That's the traffic cam.

541
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,377
Two security cameras.

542
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:19,254
Got a fourth angle.

543
00:31:20,272 --> 00:31:21,297
ATM camera.

544
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:23,575
I'll input the network data.

545
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:34,629
There it is.

546
00:31:36,952 --> 00:31:38,097
There's Chandler.

547
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:41,818
It's an SUV,
but you can't see any plates.

548
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:43,187
Got it.

549
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:47,949
There's our shooter.

550
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:49,617
Might even be Liam.

551
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:51,875
Send the photo to Abby.

552
00:31:54,598 --> 00:31:56,291
Navy Op directory.

553
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:01,796
Abby Sciuto.

554
00:32:05,177 --> 00:32:06,174
On its way.

555
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,575
Oh, I really got
to get one of these.

556
00:32:13,017 --> 00:32:14,128
You got problems.

557
00:32:16,055 --> 00:32:18,904
Do you have a current address?
Okay. Thanks.

558
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:20,851
I have a lead.

559
00:32:21,151 --> 00:32:22,251
A real lead?

560
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:23,738
I mean...
Really? A lead?

561
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,141
18 months ago,
a man was found strung up

562
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:29,641
and wired to a battery
in a forest outside of Baltimore.

563
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:32,134
Same M.O. as Chandler's.
Prime suspects are brothers.

564
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,028
Stephano and Benji Kass.

565
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:35,824
They run a scaffolding business.

566
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:37,304
Why weren't they charged?

567
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:40,166
All witnesses disappeared.

568
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:48,009
Well, look at that.

569
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:50,678
Six-cylinder gas-powered beast.

570
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,555
V-8. Diesel.

571
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,683
- Batteries in here.
- Here.

572
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,930
Over there.

573
00:33:00,631 --> 00:33:02,482
Two 12-volt batteries.

574
00:33:02,757 --> 00:33:03,524
New.

575
00:33:04,908 --> 00:33:06,473
You looking for something?

576
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,240
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo, NCIS.

577
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:13,493
You must be the Kass boys.

578
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:16,329
- Is this your rig?
- What if it is?

579
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,791
Tony, Chandler's left shoe
was missing.

580
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:24,556
Freeze!

581
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:31,751
I'm guessing Stephano?

582
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,653
Looks like the guys
who put the scaffolding

583
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:50,382
together got a little careless?

584
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:52,323
Wait a minute.
That would be you, wouldn't it?

585
00:33:55,464 --> 00:33:57,286
That's a nasty rope burn
you got there.

586
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:59,414
I'm losing my grip. Come on.

587
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:02,333
- How much did he pay you?
- Come on man, please.

588
00:34:02,603 --> 00:34:04,168
How much?

589
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:07,472
Nothing, okay. We owed him one.

590
00:34:07,658 --> 00:34:09,885
He called us. He told us
to pick Chandler up at the airport

591
00:34:09,945 --> 00:34:12,719
- and e-mailed us his flight and photo.
- What was his name?

592
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,765
Come on. You don't know
what he's like, okay? He'll kill me.

593
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:19,308
Benji, my hands are getting
a little sweaty.

594
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:21,978
And I don't know what's going
to happen if I, you know...

595
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:24,022
For instance.

596
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:26,149
What's his name?

597
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:28,108
Okay. His name is Liam.

598
00:34:28,189 --> 00:34:30,695
- What's his last name?
- It's just... It's just Liam.

599
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,755
- What about Stephano?
- <i>No, he's not talking.</i>

600
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,090
Work it, DiNozzo.

601
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:52,717
Need a last name for Liam.

602
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:54,758
Anything?

603
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:57,671
Abby's running facial recognition
on the guy in the SUV,

604
00:34:57,731 --> 00:34:59,556
she's going to call us
when she gets a match.

605
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:01,639
- What have you got?
- Chandler's killers.

606
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,882
Got a call from Liam to grab him
at the airport in D.C.

607
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:06,620
- No last name?
- Working it.

608
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,267
Mace, Talia's on his phone.

609
00:35:08,327 --> 00:35:09,781
Lights dimmed.
On-screen.

610
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,735
Bugged his car
while he was in the diner.

611
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:14,112
Surveillance video, coming in live.

612
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:16,073
He's on his speaker phone.
Quality's not great.

613
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,829
<i>I need to speak to Mattie Rae.</i>

614
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,839
<i>Speaking.</i>

615
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,928
<i>The diner this morning.</i>

616
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,860
<i>How'd you know he was a cop?</i>

617
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,803
<i>Who is this?</i>

618
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:25,958
<i>Name's Max... Talia.</i>

619
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:28,956
- <i>How did you get my number?
- Waitress at the diner.</i>

620
00:35:29,016 --> 00:35:31,340
<i>I can see why you gave it her.
She's a cutie.</i>

621
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:34,716
<i>Saved me a lot of embarrassment
this morning, Mattie.</i>

622
00:35:34,797 --> 00:35:38,079
<i>Yeah, well, that chump just about ruined
my life, so, easy favor, you know?</i>

623
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:40,138
<i>Five years for dealing guns, huh?</i>

624
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:42,706
<i>Wait a minute. How did you know that?
Who you been talking to?</i>

625
00:35:42,895 --> 00:35:44,624
<i>I've got friends, Mattie.</i>

626
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:46,937
<i>Made some inquiries.</i>

627
00:35:47,114 --> 00:35:48,955
<i>I heard you're back in the game.</i>

628
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:49,940
<i>Maybe.</i>

629
00:35:50,141 --> 00:35:52,443
<i>Look, Mattie, I got
a cashed-up client looking for</i>

630
00:35:52,523 --> 00:35:54,754
<i> some specialized ordinance
in a hurry.</i>

631
00:35:55,481 --> 00:35:56,864
<i>I could cut you in.</i>

632
00:35:57,017 --> 00:35:58,144
<i>How specialized?</i>

633
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,517
<i>Assault weapons, C-4.</i>

634
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:02,179
<i>You can handle that?</i>

635
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,328
<i>Well, I know people who could get you
a tank if you had a big enough suitcase.</i>

636
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:08,167
<i>Look, I need to meet this guy first.
I got to know who I'm dealing with.</i>

637
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:09,877
<i>There's an old parking garage</i>

638
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:13,016
<i>downtown, East Temple,
where it hits the train line.</i>

639
00:36:13,955 --> 00:36:15,883
<i>40 minutes.
Work for you?</i>

640
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:17,530
<i>I'll be there.</i>

641
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:20,138
Looks like we've got
ourselves a meeting.

642
00:36:20,955 --> 00:36:23,516
<i>- All right, camera three's on-line.
- All units stand by.</i>

643
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,601
<i>Mattie Rae is here.</i>

644
00:36:26,088 --> 00:36:27,603
And here comes Talia.

645
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:31,649
Still waiting on the guest of honor.

646
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,154
Talia's made the call.
Liam's on his way.

647
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,000
I don't think Liam would be
the kind of guy

648
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,988
to show up to a meeting
on short notice.

649
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:41,226
He's under pressure.

650
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:44,335
Losing Chandler screwed up
his timetable.

651
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:47,666
He probably had to find
that cash fast from someplace else.

652
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:49,490
He's desperate.

653
00:36:49,865 --> 00:36:50,918
Our advantage.

654
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:52,919
Vehicle entering the alley.

655
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:54,839
<i>They're on the move.</i>

656
00:37:08,713 --> 00:37:09,997
That's Liam.

657
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:17,987
McGee, go tight on Liam.
What do you see?

658
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:20,035
<i>Zoom in</i> on camera one, please.

659
00:37:23,396 --> 00:37:25,405
Wearing jeans and a sports coat.

660
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:27,818
He's carrying...
Looks like a long <i>barrel</i>...

661
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,144
It's a hit!

662
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,059
Separate them.

663
00:37:49,649 --> 00:37:51,019
On your feet, Mr. Talia.

664
00:37:51,248 --> 00:37:52,563
Hands behind your back.

665
00:37:53,347 --> 00:37:55,315
You're the friggin' waitress
from the diner.

666
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,874
Should have tipped me better, huh?

667
00:37:58,962 --> 00:37:59,736
Gibbs.

668
00:38:00,398 --> 00:38:02,490
Special Agent Mike Renko.
Thanks for the spot.

669
00:38:03,274 --> 00:38:05,574
- You okay, Mike?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

670
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:08,040
That got interesting pretty fast,
huh, Mace?

671
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:11,256
- How did you guys know it was a hit?
- Weapons had silencers.

672
00:38:14,998 --> 00:38:16,465
Why did they try to take us out?

673
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:17,921
We had what Liam wanted.

674
00:38:18,123 --> 00:38:21,018
- Maybe he got what he wanted elsewhere.
- You were a loose end.

675
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,636
Motel on The Strip.

676
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:30,163
Clear.

677
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:43,406
Four blank passports.

678
00:38:45,321 --> 00:38:47,450
Four suitcases filled with weapons.

679
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:49,904
Enough C-4 to bring down a building.

680
00:38:49,993 --> 00:38:51,140
Room's still booked.

681
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:54,250
That means whoever Liam's supplying
is probably coming back to collect this.

682
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:56,839
Liam's a ghost.

683
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,037
They've probably never met him.

684
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:01,915
Probably.

685
00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:07,066
Get any more hits
on our secret thingy?

686
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:09,219
Do you know how busy I've been?

687
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:10,792
I know how busy you've been.

688
00:39:11,353 --> 00:39:12,344
Just asking.

689
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:14,851
We got one hit, but it is a doozy.

690
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:18,441
Guy on the right,

691
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:21,798
Michael Rivkin,
our supposed Israeli banker.

692
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:24,780
Guy on the left, Director of Mossad,

693
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:26,073
Eli David,

694
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,778
- also known as...
- Ziva's father.

695
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,037
She must know Rivkin.

696
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,203
You don't ask her.

697
00:39:34,314 --> 00:39:35,791
You don't breathe a word of this.

698
00:39:45,374 --> 00:39:46,468
I mean it.

699
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:51,932
Liam Patrick Coil,

700
00:39:52,013 --> 00:39:53,782
former IRA arms dealer.

701
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:57,034
Raised money and smuggled arms
into Northern Ireland in the '90s.

702
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:59,706
After the peace treaty,
he went freelance.

703
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:03,444
He sold weapons everywhere
from Chechnya to the Horn of Africa.

704
00:40:03,962 --> 00:40:05,239
Supplying terrorists.

705
00:40:06,302 --> 00:40:09,177
- How come we've never heard of him?
- He's been living in New York.

706
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:11,285
Fake job, fake name, fake life...

707
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,147
It's called a legend.

708
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,646
It's a word coined by the Stasi,

709
00:40:17,914 --> 00:40:20,336
the East German secret police
back during the Cold War.

710
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:23,849
Now, their idea was to create
a cover so deep

711
00:40:23,909 --> 00:40:25,764
that it could stand up
to any scrutiny.

712
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:29,261
Passports, documents, work papers...

713
00:40:31,225 --> 00:40:33,075
even family histories.

714
00:40:34,242 --> 00:40:35,586
And none of it true.

715
00:40:43,096 --> 00:40:44,385
All a...

716
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:45,900
legend.

717
00:40:58,877 --> 00:41:01,377
- Thanks for holding that.
- You're welcome, Tony.

718
00:41:01,549 --> 00:41:04,378
Never thought I'd say this,
but I almost miss McGee. Almost.

719
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:08,187
- What about you? You miss him?
- Yes, I do.

720
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:10,636
Miss anyone else?
Gibbs?

721
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:11,761
Some.

722
00:41:12,151 --> 00:41:13,791
What about
your friend from Tel Aviv?

723
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,808
I'm just saying.

724
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:18,930
Yes. I miss Michael, too.

725
00:41:20,273 --> 00:41:22,981
When he called the other day,
I thought he must have been here.

726
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:27,077
No.

727
00:41:27,803 --> 00:41:30,076
Sadly, Michael is not here.

728
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:03,804
I've been expecting you.

729
00:42:04,332 --> 00:42:06,920
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, Liam.
