00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:36,853
Where is McGee?

7
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:38,308
 I don't know.

8
00:01:39,103 --> 00:01:41,577
He's been acting distracted lately.
Gibbs is on his case.

9
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:42,756
I have noticed.

10
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:44,794
So...

11
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,890
did you know
Special Agent Patterson?

12
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:50,598
Not really.

13
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:54,449
Met him in a crime scene training
class at FLETC. Seemed like a nice guy.

14
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,691
Give McGee a call.

15
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,591
Tell him we're waiting.

16
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,371
I have a message.

17
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,875
<i>Good afternoon, I'm calling from
Hubbard & Hubbard, solicitor's office...</i>

18
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:05,709
Sorry. There was
an accident on MacArthur.

19
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:06,876
Let's go.

20
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,421
That was strange.

21
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,341
A law firm in London
wants me to call.

22
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:14,010
- Says it's important.
- What could they want?

23
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:16,269
I don't know.
Maybe it's about my Uncle Clive.

24
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:18,331
Remember that funeral
I went to last month?

25
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:20,208
Your uncle really died?

26
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:22,664
I thought you were making that up
to get some time off.

27
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:26,523
Who do you think I am?

28
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:29,843
He was Agent Afloat
on the George Washington.

29
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:32,445
It returned to Norfolk two days ago.

30
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:34,239
You notified Director Vance?

31
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,030
Yeah.

32
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,076
It's way after midnight in Singapore.
I send up an e-mail.

33
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:54,425
Sorry, boss. Got hung up in traffic.

34
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:06,861
911 came from the pastry chef
at the restaurant on the corner.

35
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:10,162
He was in the kitchen when he heard
the screech of tires. Ran out.

36
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:13,123
Caught sight of
a dark-colored SUV racing away.

37
00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:15,745
He did not here any shots. Silencer?

38
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:18,575
Or a small-caliber weapon
that doesn't make much noise.

39
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:20,577
Ducky said
the entry wounds were small.

40
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:23,788
Yeah. One shot was behind the ear,
close-range.

41
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:25,748
Professional hit.

42
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,587
You might want to take
a look at this.

43
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,325
DiNozzo, bring him in.

44
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:42,178
Homeland Security.
Got it.

45
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:46,644
Tony, why'd you cover for me?

46
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:47,937
Did I?

47
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:51,330
This is Anthony DiNozzo, NCIS.
Please call me back...

48
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,295
Patterson never got a shot off.
The mag's full.

49
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,030
Boss, I reached his office.

50
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,880
Voice mail. Left a message.

51
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:02,743
DiNozzo,
cell phone on the back of the card.

52
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:06,294
Good eye.

53
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,224
I don't know
how I could have missed that.

54
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:13,839
Bartholomew Lemming,
this is Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

55
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:17,008
Special Agent Gibbs, I got a woman
who insists on talking to you.

56
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,552
Claims she's with NCIS.
Real weirdo.

57
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:22,222
Wearing a Dracula cape
and dog collar.

58
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:23,806
Like she'd be with you.

59
00:04:24,646 --> 00:04:25,475
She is.

60
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:27,145
You serious?

61
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:29,187
Oh, yeah. Let her in.

62
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:32,712
Sorry about that.
Go ahead.

63
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:36,444
What are you doing here?

64
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:38,051
Is that him?

65
00:04:38,484 --> 00:04:40,239
Is that Jack Patterson?

66
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,532
What are you doing here?

67
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:43,420
This is terrible.

68
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:46,496
- Abby...
- This is all my fault.

69
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:50,042
Gibbs, he was coming to see me.

70
00:04:56,928 --> 00:05:00,009
Agent Jack Patterson.
It's not what I thought he'd look like.

71
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:01,219
Said you knew him.

72
00:05:01,804 --> 00:05:04,931
We had a very special
phone relationship.

73
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:08,873
He would mail me forensic evidence,
I'd e-mail him back results.

74
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:11,270
He'd call me, I'd call him.

75
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:13,289
He never forgot my birthday...

76
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:15,595
like you did last year.

77
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:18,758
I don't know. It's his voice.
He sounded...

78
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:20,737
shorter,

79
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:23,245
blonder, with a mustache.

80
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:26,838
You got all that
from his voice, Abs?

81
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:30,637
You sounded different
when you had a mustache.

82
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:38,131
Well, why was he coming to see you?

83
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,125
He said he wanted
to show me something.

84
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:42,443
What?

85
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,930
I don't know.

86
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,919
He wanted to meet up last night.

87
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:50,356
And I... I put him off.

88
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:52,562
I told him to come this morning.

89
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:55,433
Gibbs, if...

90
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,324
if I had just met up with him last
night, he'd probably be alive right now.

91
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:09,377
Well, it's a little after 10:00
in the morning here.

92
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:12,582
I can be reached on my cell at any time.
You did write that number down?

93
00:06:13,383 --> 00:06:14,876
Good. Tell Mr. Hubbard

94
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:17,128
that I anxiously await his call,

95
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,410
and you have yourself
a very nice day

96
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,978
or night,
or whatever time it is there.

97
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:23,366
Okay,

98
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:24,519
cheerio.

99
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,390
I suppose that was for my benefit.

100
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,870
Okay, I'll bite.

101
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:32,810
Are you in the will?

102
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:37,857
McProbie,

103
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:40,313
we can only assume, right?

104
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,912
That was his secretary.

105
00:06:43,972 --> 00:06:45,198
Mr. Hubbard, my...

106
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:47,449
great-uncle's solicitor
wasn't available, but...

107
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:50,024
she did confirm that...

108
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:52,133
he represents Uncle Clive's estate.

109
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:54,748
Clive DiNozzo.

110
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:58,169
Clive Paddington.
It's my mother's side.

111
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:02,203
- We talking big money?
- Huge money!

112
00:07:04,286 --> 00:07:05,785
I mean, Jed Clampett money.

113
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,413
I'm talking Texas gold.

114
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:09,972
It's actually North Sea oil money.

115
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:12,892
I take it you were close
to the old gent.

116
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:15,311
I spent my 17th summer in Blighty.

117
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:16,979
Uncle Clive was my mentor.

118
00:07:17,284 --> 00:07:19,406
Kind of like Al Pacino
and Chris O'Donnell

119
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:20,821
in <i>Scent of a Woman</i>.

120
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:25,029
Guessing the opposite sex
was involved.

121
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,948
He could sniff out
a gorgeous woman and

122
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:28,911
close the deal faster
than anyone I ever met.

123
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:31,619
I'm more concerned
about closing that case.

124
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,079
I'm working on it, boss.

125
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:37,917
Right...

126
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:40,961
The George Washington returned
from a six-month

127
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:43,046
deployment to South
and Central America.

128
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:46,547
Special Agent Patterson was
still living on board in Norfolk.

129
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,762
Was looking for an apartment. No one
knew he left the ship and was in D.C.

130
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:52,682
Ten years in the Navy,
joined NCIS in '98.

131
00:07:52,762 --> 00:07:55,461
He had a setback in 2003.

132
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:57,936
Spent some time on the beach
for use of excessive force.

133
00:07:57,996 --> 00:07:59,674
Never married.
Only immediate family:

134
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:02,191
a mother and a sister living
in Wheeling, West Virginia.

135
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:03,693
Special Agent Gibbs,

136
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,887
Bartholomew Lemming,
Homeland Security.

137
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:07,697
Call me Bart, Agent Gibbs.

138
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,959
We're in the conference room.

139
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:19,876
My life is about to change.

140
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:22,715
Thinks he's about
to inherit a fortune.

141
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:29,664
Oh! Yeah.

142
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,273
Oh. Yeah.

143
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:34,085
Okay, as soon as I can. Sorry.

144
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:37,894
Blockbuster. <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>,
it's overdue.

145
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,772
I met Jack Patterson

146
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,983
shortly after I joined
Homeland Security.

147
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:47,111
I was assigned to Customs
Border Protection Division.

148
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:51,087
He was working out of the NCIS
Resident Agency in Yuma, Arizona, so

149
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:54,794
we coordinated on incursions
and smuggling cases.

150
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:58,196
- The last time you heard from him?
- He left me a message last night.

151
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:01,669
I was gonna call him
when I got to the office this morning.

152
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,774
Said he was working a case and he found
something he wanted to show me.

153
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:05,963
Yeah.

154
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:07,882
What did he want to show you?

155
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:10,718
What's he working on?

156
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:12,595
I don't know.

157
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:15,598
Jack and I were friendly in Yuma.

158
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:18,601
You know how it goes.
We lost contact with one another.

159
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,769
How did he die?

160
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,401
Shot.

161
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:24,273
Think he was on his way here.

162
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:27,443
And he had my business card
in his hand. Why?

163
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,302
You tell me.

164
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:33,965
We had some good times.

165
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:36,789
Jack could put them down.
He knew how to party.

166
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:38,781
We were single then.

167
00:09:39,052 --> 00:09:40,748
Took the plunge last year.

168
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:46,157
What can I do to help?

169
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,681
I don't know yet.

170
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,458
You have my cell number.
That's the best way to reach me.

171
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:53,332
I'm in the field this week.

172
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:56,639
Well, joint Threat Assessment
Task Force with the FBI.

173
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:00,268
I wish you luck with that.

174
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,879
You know, we always said that,

175
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,663
we would meet someday.

176
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:34,058
This isn't exactly what I expected.

177
00:10:35,787 --> 00:10:37,164
God, this is awkward.

178
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,969
When you called me last night,
you sounded...

179
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,013
you know, excited.

180
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,720
Said you had to see me.

181
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:50,320
I thought you meant a date.

182
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:54,302
I mean, did you want to go out

183
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,372
or was it something else?

184
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:59,473
Was I just jumping
to conclusions? I...

185
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,391
God, I didn't know
what to say to Gibbs.

186
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:08,247
Oh, no, are you behind me, Gibbs?

187
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:11,954
You flatter me, Abby.

188
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:18,387
There was just... there was something
I needed to ask Special Agent Patterson.

189
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:20,871
What?

190
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:23,356
You talk to dead people
all the time.

191
00:11:23,592 --> 00:11:24,928
Well, I have my reasons.

192
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:28,230
Their bodies tell me a great deal.

193
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,667
It helps to reciprocate.

194
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:34,214
But we have work to do.

195
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:46,120
I need the slugs.

196
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:47,808
You'll get them...

197
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:50,753
in due time.

198
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:56,751
Patterson was supposed to be finishing
up paperwork on the deployment.

199
00:11:56,811 --> 00:11:58,742
I have no idea
why he was in Washington.

200
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,572
He's NCIS, don't you know?

201
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:03,127
Anything unusual happen
during the deployment?

202
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:05,036
Well, 6,500 men and women,

203
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:07,604
six months, seven tropical ports,
the usual.

204
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:09,988
Alcohol, fighting, petty thefts.

205
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:13,203
All in Patterson's daily activity log...
nothing major.

206
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,945
- Excuse me, Commander?
- Yes?

207
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:17,738
Could you identify these photos?

208
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:20,783
It's the last file Patterson
opened yesterday afternoon.

209
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:23,156
These images were downloaded
from a digital camera.

210
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:26,091
9-35-6-A.

211
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:29,352
That would be a forward
port-side storage area.

212
00:12:30,092 --> 00:12:32,319
I spent four glorious months
aboard the Seahawk.

213
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:34,637
It was a rewarding experience.

214
00:12:35,181 --> 00:12:36,924
This part of an investigation,
Commander?

215
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,991
It's a big ship,
on a cruise to South America.

216
00:12:41,332 --> 00:12:44,817
A misguided sailor might think
he'll be able to smuggle drugs aboard.

217
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,935
I'm not getting a signal down here.

218
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:49,979
You expecting a call, DiNozzo?

219
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,439
They'll leave a message.

220
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,649
Patterson
and I worked well together.

221
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:56,635
He understood
the demands on the X.O.

222
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:59,325
Usually didn't come to me
until he had something.

223
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:11,750
Well, if you were thinking of smuggling
something, this'd be

224
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:13,294
the perfect hiding place.

225
00:13:14,222 --> 00:13:15,316
Check it out.

226
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:20,056
Boss, it's, it's pretty late.

227
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:22,928
This could take hours, and then it's
a long drive back to Washington.

228
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:26,182
Most of the crew's on leave.
You'll find a place to bunk.

229
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:28,472
Perfect.

230
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,853
22-caliber.

231
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,855
This one's in pristine shape.

232
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:35,316
I like pristine.

233
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:38,944
Hey, Roy.

234
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:40,909
U.S. mail.

235
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:42,948
You mean overnight carrier.

236
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:46,696
No, no, U.S. mail.
Someone dropped this in the mailbox.

237
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,828
No postage.

238
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:50,831
'Cause it was addressed to NCIS,
the postal inspector gave us a call.

239
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:54,084
It's addressed to me?
Well, you could say that.

240
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:56,795
It's a credit card receipt.

241
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:02,214
It's Jack Patterson.

242
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,477
Did the... postal inspector say
where it was mailed from?

243
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,332
400 block of K Street.

244
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:13,020
That's where Patterson was killed.

245
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:14,291
So...

246
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:18,317
he knew he was in jeopardy, and
his last desperate act was to mail this?

247
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:22,342
He wanted this to get to me
even he didn't.

248
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,748
He died getting me this?

249
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:47,272
There has to be a reason
he sent it to you.

250
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,847
I don't know.

251
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:51,917
I mean, maybe he guessed
the little girl looked like me, or...

252
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:53,310
No, that's... stupid.

253
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,541
I don't know.

254
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,854
You ever talk about art?

255
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,110
When you weren't talking about forensic
evidence, what'd you talk about?

256
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:03,528
Well, that's personal.
I feel like you're interrogating me.

257
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,410
I am.

258
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:10,619
Okay, she's reading a book.
The book got a title?

259
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:18,643
Abby, Patterson died
getting this to you.

260
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:20,104
I know.

261
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,547
This is totally weirding me out.

262
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,550
All right,
you said you had a match on the slug.

263
00:15:24,835 --> 00:15:25,843
Yeah.

264
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:28,679
Okay.

265
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:32,390
The one on the left is one
that Ducky took from Patterson.

266
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:34,318
I ran it through the NIBIN database.

267
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:37,021
It's an exact match
to the one on the right,

268
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:38,665
which was used...

269
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:43,277
in the unsolved murder of a businessman
in Scottsdale, Arizona, two years ago.

270
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,343
What are you doing in there?

271
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,306
Our jobs.

272
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:14,496
I'm looking for contraband.

273
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:16,961
I found this.

274
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,003
You are looking good.

275
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:21,662
- What have we here?
- We?

276
00:16:22,556 --> 00:16:25,061
Where were you, when I'm down there
banging my head, huh?

277
00:16:25,121 --> 00:16:26,355
Skinning my knees?

278
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:29,198
I was up on the flight deck,
trying to get a cell signal.

279
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:32,868
I've been playing phone tag
with Uncle Clive's solicitor.

280
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,537
Screw your Uncle Clive.
You haven't done anything all morning.

281
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:39,916
What's with you, McCranky?

282
00:16:40,368 --> 00:16:41,543
You need to chillax.

283
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,074
You want me to chillax?

284
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:44,366
You want me to chillax?

285
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:47,508
I will chillax when you tell me
that you have done something!

286
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:49,301
I have done something.

287
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:54,918
I went over Special Agent Patterson's
e-mails and daily activity log.

288
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,768
Four days ago, he did
a background check on a...

289
00:16:58,023 --> 00:16:59,626
Seaman Richard Zell.

290
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,429
He's had him under surveillance
since Panama. Zell...

291
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:05,534
is one of only three people
with the access code to...

292
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:06,902
this storage bay.

293
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:08,862
Where's Seaman Zell now?

294
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:12,000
According to the ship's duty
roster log,

295
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,785
he's due back on board in an hour.

296
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:21,542
- You make anything of it?
- Yeah. I'm aware of the artist.

297
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:22,876
Dina Risi.

298
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,545
I admired her work in Yuma.

299
00:17:24,764 --> 00:17:26,914
I should've bought it then.
I can't afford it now.

300
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:29,383
Any idea why Patterson
would've sent it to our lab?

301
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,969
I've been trying to make
a connection between the painting

302
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,337
and Jack, but I can't.

303
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:35,505
That was a Scottsdale
homicide detective...

304
00:17:35,565 --> 00:17:37,315
it made his day
when I told him the weapon

305
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,769
that killed Special Agent Patterson was
the same one that was used in the murder

306
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,313
of a local businessman
by the name of...

307
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,023
Hamilton Cooper.

308
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:48,382
They have not had any movement
on the case in the past two years.

309
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:50,486
He is e-mailing me their case file.

310
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,648
You think his death had anything
to do with the time

311
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,299
he and I were stationed in Yuma?

312
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:56,065
Do you?

313
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,935
Well, we did some joint operations.
I'll make some phone calls,

314
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,957
go back through the files,
see what I can dig up.

315
00:18:05,237 --> 00:18:08,381
Uncle Clive's primary residence
is this manor house

316
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:11,578
that's just outside
of Henley on Thames.

317
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:13,425
You have to come and visit sometime.

318
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,982
In the summer, they have these...
annual regattas.

319
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:18,683
It's absolutely smashing.

320
00:18:18,743 --> 00:18:19,743
Tony, shut up.

321
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,050
"What I wouldn't give
for a sock full of horse manure."

322
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,525
La-di-da!

323
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:28,025
Look at you,
fancy-pants-movie-reference.

324
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,109
<i>Annie Hall</i>, 1977.

325
00:18:30,306 --> 00:18:31,825
Really Woody Allen's best.

326
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:33,851
Did I tell you about Clive's...

327
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:35,979
muse in London?
Really?

328
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:38,292
Do you have any idea
how insufferable you are?

329
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:40,537
What are you doing?

330
00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:42,695
You're dripping paint
all over the place.

331
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:47,059
Look, you see what you're doing there?
Look at what I'm doing, okay?

332
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,504
Watch. You do...

333
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:50,416
even strokes.

334
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:53,530
You see that?
Nice, even strokes.

335
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:57,846
We're pretend painting, McGoo.

336
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:00,823
Keep that away from me.

337
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:31,922
NCIS.

338
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,875
Put your hands behind your head,
spread your legs.

339
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:42,423
God!

340
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:44,726
I don't need this crap!

341
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:47,467
I'm about to be a very wealthy man.

342
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:51,351
I fumed it with cyanoacrylate.

343
00:19:51,411 --> 00:19:53,031
There's dozens of prints.

344
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,612
So far I've been able to I.D. two:

345
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:58,657
Special Agent Patterson
and Roy from our mail room.

346
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:01,618
So many prints, so little time.
But...

347
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:03,120
I tried something else.

348
00:20:03,457 --> 00:20:06,498
How long do you think it takes
ballpoint pen ink to dry?

349
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:07,833
Like, really, really dry.

350
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:10,059
Four to five days.

351
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:13,591
I removed the clear plastic window
from the carton,

352
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,315
and I coated
the inside with a solvent,

353
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,635
lifting the ink residue left
by the original sender's mailing label.

354
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:21,703
I heat-transferred it
to a clean piece of paper,

355
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:23,983
then I scanned it...

356
00:20:26,223 --> 00:20:27,891
What's it say?
I can't make it out.

357
00:20:27,951 --> 00:20:29,379
I'm not done yet, Gibbs.

358
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:31,398
And I ran it through
an enhancement program.

359
00:20:33,803 --> 00:20:36,777
The package was sent
to Patterson from the artist,

360
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,697
Dina Risi.
And there's her phone number.

361
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:41,067
Give yourself an atta-girl.

362
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:42,485
- Atta-girl.
- Atta-girl.

363
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:44,450
You get anywhere with the painting?

364
00:20:45,998 --> 00:20:47,664
Never enough for you, Gibbs, is it?

365
00:20:48,356 --> 00:20:50,634
Went right to voice mail...
she's got her phone turned off.

366
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:02,831
You know we've got you for drugs...

367
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:06,539
and assaulting a Federal Officer.

368
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:09,646
So why don't you tell me...

369
00:21:10,157 --> 00:21:13,144
what was going down
between you and Agent Patterson.

370
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,193
Yeah, I punched him.

371
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:18,341
Yeah.

372
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:20,231
Yeah, the coke is mine.

373
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:23,391
But I told you, it's a big ship,

374
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:25,077
I didn't know Patterson.

375
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:27,001
<i>Well, he knew you.</i>

376
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:30,123
<i>Had you under surveillance
since the ship left Panama.</i>

377
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,506
He may have killed
Special Agent Patterson, but

378
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:35,556
Seaman Zell could not have
killed the Arizona businessman.

379
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,759
According to his service records,

380
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,339
he was aboard a frigate

381
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,696
on his way to the Persian Gulf
at the time of the murder.

382
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,178
<i>Tell me why you didn't.</i>

383
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,167
I was just trying
to make a couple bucks.

384
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:48,433
Could you live on an E-3 salary?

385
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:51,034
- What did you pay for the coke?
- $2,000.

386
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:53,009
I'm going home to Brooklyn
on leave next week.

387
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:54,573
On the street, I can get 20.

388
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:59,013
Well, you'll be lucky
if you get 25...

389
00:21:59,073 --> 00:22:00,779
years for murder.

390
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:07,317
His alibi for yesterday morning
checks out.

391
00:22:07,985 --> 00:22:09,705
Patterson was shot at 5:40 A.M.

392
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:11,832
30 minutes later, Seaman Zell

393
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,267
was with drawing $40
from an ATM on the base at Norfolk.

394
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:16,670
That's 200 miles away.

395
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:19,135
Even you couldn't drive
that fast, boss.

396
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,365
Based on the amount
of drugs involved,

397
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:31,867
we're pretty sure
that Seaman Zell was working alone.

398
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:34,631
So I don't have a serious smuggling
problem aboard the Washington.

399
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,692
A new NCIS Agent will be assigned
this week. He'll follow up.

400
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:40,165
What's to follow up?

401
00:22:40,623 --> 00:22:42,850
I thought you said Seaman Zell
didn't have any connection

402
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,698
to Special Agent Patterson's death.

403
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,200
It's an ongoing investigation.

404
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:49,885
We're returning him to your command.

405
00:22:51,322 --> 00:22:53,487
Suggest you put him in
pre-trial confinement.

406
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:00,005
He say anything?
Feel like the guy's got an agenda?

407
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:02,575
- What do we got?
- McGee, tell him about the e-mail.

408
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:05,012
Doesn't sound like Patterson
shared Commander Weidman's feelings

409
00:23:05,072 --> 00:23:06,762
about them working well together.

410
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:09,931
Patterson told the captain in an e-mail
that he felt Weidman

411
00:23:10,012 --> 00:23:12,017
was obstructing
some of his investigations.

412
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:15,061
- Got a call into the captain.
- Gibbs, Dina Risi, the artist,

413
00:23:15,142 --> 00:23:18,022
she's starting to be recognized
outside Arizona.

414
00:23:18,103 --> 00:23:20,586
Had a showing
in San Francisco in December.

415
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:22,444
She specializes in landscape.

416
00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:23,668
She grew up in Italy,

417
00:23:23,728 --> 00:23:26,431
studied art in Milan,
moved to Arizona about ten years ago.

418
00:23:26,491 --> 00:23:29,576
Dina Risi's always been
very outspoken on ecological issues.

419
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:31,536
I did talk to the local sheriff...

420
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:33,876
guy by the name of Clay Boyd.

421
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:37,192
And he said that he was looking for her,
but she,

422
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:38,764
well, she just disappeared.

423
00:23:39,276 --> 00:23:41,479
- Disappeared?
- Disappeared.

424
00:23:41,611 --> 00:23:43,637
Like she just fell off
the face of the earth.

425
00:23:43,774 --> 00:23:46,332
He talks just like that.
That's how he talks.

426
00:23:46,646 --> 00:23:49,025
I won't though.
Says that she has a remote,

427
00:23:49,102 --> 00:23:51,994
mountain retreat where likes to go and
paint, but he doesn't know where it is.

428
00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:54,287
- Find it, McGee.
- Think I did, boss.

429
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:57,809
I only used Risi paintings that have
distinctive geographical landmarks.

430
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:59,960
Compared them
to Google Earth satellite images.

431
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,505
These locations correspond
to backgrounds in her paintings.

432
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:04,882
They're all within a four-mile
radius of Mount Pinos.

433
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,917
Searched the area,
only found one structure.

434
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:09,014
This was taken six months ago.

435
00:24:09,185 --> 00:24:10,805
Good. See if she's there.

436
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:13,193
Piece of cake, Probie.

437
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:19,122
A Ferrari.
599 GTB.

438
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,148
You are counting
your eggs before they are laid.

439
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,150
Operative word is "laid".

440
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,557
- Wouldn't drink that.
- Sure I've had worse.

441
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:38,275
- What do you have?
- I know who's at the center of this.

442
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:40,063
Dina Risi, the artist.

443
00:24:40,206 --> 00:24:43,153
Get this: I talked to a bartender
at a place Jack and I used to hang.

444
00:24:43,672 --> 00:24:46,383
After I left Arizona,
Jack used to come in with her.

445
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,966
Bartender hinted they were
a lot more than just friends.

446
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,840
Might explain why Dina Risi
sent Patterson the painting.

447
00:24:51,988 --> 00:24:53,118
You talk to her yet?

448
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,834
No. She went into hiding.
We may have a location though.

449
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,491
- Mount Pinos.
- That's the badlands.

450
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,730
Good luck finding her up there.

451
00:25:08,118 --> 00:25:09,759
I'm e-mailing the lawyer in London.

452
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,762
All right?
The suspense is killing me.

453
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:13,115
I did not ask.

454
00:25:13,752 --> 00:25:15,679
I have the Scottsdale Police report

455
00:25:15,739 --> 00:25:17,966
on the murder of Hamilton Cooper,
the local businessman.

456
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:19,582
- Anything?
- Yes.

457
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:23,134
He was worth $20 million.

458
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:26,295
Investigators suspected
his wife hired a hit man.

459
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:28,237
She was conveniently out of town.

460
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:30,694
Shooter used a .22,
multiple hits to the body.

461
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:33,387
One to the head,
right behind the ear.

462
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:34,674
Just like Patterson.

463
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:37,075
Well, I guess that lets
Commander Weidman off the hook.

464
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:40,865
Boss.
Tasked an NSA satellite.

465
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:43,009
I got an infrared image
of the cabin here.

466
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:49,566
Heat signature from the fireplace.
Somebody's there.

467
00:25:50,112 --> 00:25:52,168
Ziva, you and McGee
work the case from here.

468
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:53,748
DiNozzo, go home, pack.

469
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:56,345
- Where am I going?
- We're going to Arizona.

470
00:25:56,615 --> 00:25:57,615
Okay.

471
00:25:58,796 --> 00:26:00,513
Arizona and I don't get along.

472
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,974
- Sheriff Boyd?
- Yes, sir.

473
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:31,878
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

474
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:36,367
Hey. Special Agent DiNozzo.
How are you?

475
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:39,095
Is that an Italian name?

476
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,469
- What?
- Any word on Dina Risi?

477
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:45,358
Nope.
We tried all our sources.

478
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,699
- No one seems to know where she went.
- You know her?

479
00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:50,214
Well, I met her.
She was chained to a tree.

480
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:52,856
I was the one
with the bolt cutters and handcuffs.

481
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,174
Let me show you
where we're aiming to go, Sheriff.

482
00:26:58,427 --> 00:27:01,558
We think she's in a small cabin in...
this area here.

483
00:27:02,405 --> 00:27:05,873
Are you expecting to go to a dance while
you're here in town, Agent DiNozzo?

484
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:13,676
Why don't we take our four-wheeler.
You know, the rental.

485
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:15,536
You can't get up there in a vehicle.

486
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,511
Only way to get up there is horses.

487
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:21,206
Why don't we just
requisition a helicopter?

488
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:25,431
Or not. If the government spent
that kind of money every time

489
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:28,269
they interviewed somebody,
government would go broke?

490
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:29,818
The government is broke.

491
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,448
That was security.
Bart Lemming is on his way up.

492
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:37,052
Maybe he's got something for us.

493
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:43,434
- That could be London.
- Answer it.

494
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,211
What, and have
Tony harass me some more

495
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:47,271
about my message-taking skills?
No, thank you.

496
00:27:48,095 --> 00:27:49,598
- I'll get it.
- Why?

497
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,486
You're gonna tell them he's not here,
they're not gonna tell you anything.

498
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:58,184
I think you are jealous
Tony's going to inherit money.

499
00:27:58,358 --> 00:28:00,321
No, I just think
that it could change him.

500
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,578
Which in Tony's case
would be a good thing.

501
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,649
Unless he becomes more...

502
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:05,921
Tony-ish.

503
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:07,845
I see your concern.

504
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:10,961
But you did not change
when your books made you plush.

505
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:12,396
Flush.

506
00:28:12,585 --> 00:28:14,795
Thanks, Ziva,
but it really wasn't that much.

507
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,386
I bought my car,
bought some clothes.

508
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:20,501
What was left over, I put
in a hedge fund which just crashed.

509
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:21,431
Sorry.

510
00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:23,666
That is why you've been
so distracted lately.

511
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:24,851
It shows?

512
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:29,109
Easy.

513
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:36,039
You ever saddled a horse, DiNozzio?

514
00:28:36,786 --> 00:28:38,638
Me?
Saddle?

515
00:28:42,315 --> 00:28:44,613
- No, not really.
- You have ridden, ain't you?

516
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:47,365
Sure. Oh, yeah.
Eighth birthday party.

517
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:51,835
Pony rides and-and-and...
stuff like that.

518
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,546
Well, this should be interesting.
Yeah. Give me that. Give me that.

519
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:56,962
Here you go. I got it.

520
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:59,550
It's a lot of leather.
Here we go.

521
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:02,442
I'm looking
for Special Agent DiNozzo.

522
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:05,224
He is away
from the office right now.

523
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:08,721
He left me a message while I was
on vacation, said it was urgent.

524
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:11,238
I returned his call,
but I haven't heard from him.

525
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,190
And you are?

526
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,966
Boss, we've got a problem.

527
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:27,788
Bartholomew Lemming
from OHS is here.

528
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:29,164
What's the problem?

529
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:31,314
It's the real Bartholomew Lemming.

530
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:35,003
<i>The guy that we've been dealing with</i>
is an impostor.

531
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:45,349
He planted the business card
on his body,

532
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:47,690
knowing whoever investigated
the murder would call.

533
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,393
Yeah. Well, we did.

534
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:52,493
And I briefed him
on the investigation.

535
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,160
Well, the guy's good, boss.

536
00:29:54,482 --> 00:29:56,499
Probably knew Lemming
was on vacation.

537
00:29:56,772 --> 00:30:00,106
It's like Nicholson in <i>Chinatown</i>,
you know? He used a stolen business card

538
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:02,730
to make everyone think he was
from the Department of Water and Power.

539
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:05,617
- Maybe he left his print on the card.
- Abby's on it.

540
00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:08,829
McGee's running facial recognition
against NCIS security videos.

541
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:12,144
Let's go!

542
00:30:16,237 --> 00:30:17,414
Excuse me, boss.

543
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,133
Hey, no, no. Come on around here.

544
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,058
- Is there a step ladder or anything?
- No. Go ahead, get up.

545
00:30:28,184 --> 00:30:30,131
- No, left foot.
- DiNozzo, come on!

546
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:31,393
I'm on my way, boss.

547
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:35,334
You don't want to get
on his bad side, do you?

548
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:37,362
You're a good judge of character,
Sheriff.

549
00:30:37,743 --> 00:30:38,785
Oh, boy.

550
00:30:44,037 --> 00:30:44,988
There you go.

551
00:30:45,774 --> 00:30:46,927
He's going.

552
00:30:47,395 --> 00:30:48,369
He's going.

553
00:30:50,123 --> 00:30:51,763
No! Sheriff...

554
00:30:52,688 --> 00:30:54,379
I think he lost a contact.

555
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:57,648
We X-rayed the painting
that Patterson sent me,

556
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,989
but we couldn't get a clear image.
It was foggy.

557
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:03,146
Did it four times,
thought it was the equipment.

558
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:05,914
- I was about to call the technician...
- Then I got an idea.

559
00:31:13,381 --> 00:31:14,249
Radioactive.

560
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,292
It's the paint.

561
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,235
Dina Risi goes
to the extremes of mixing

562
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,610
her paints and pigments
with indigenous substances,

563
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:23,783
- much like the Mayans did.
- She used clay

564
00:31:23,843 --> 00:31:27,306
containing metallic elements
occurring in pitchblende.

565
00:31:27,446 --> 00:31:29,305
Also referred to as uraninite,

566
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:32,984
which is processed
into purified uranium dioxide,

567
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,142
UO2,

568
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,104
also used in manufacturing...

569
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,602
Nuclear weapons.

570
00:31:39,378 --> 00:31:40,651
Gibbs's satellite.

571
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:43,539
I already tried calling him.
You're not gonna get ahold of him.

572
00:31:44,182 --> 00:31:45,224
It's ringing.

573
00:31:49,635 --> 00:31:51,379
<i>It's not the painting,
it's the paint.</i>

574
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,545
<i>The little girl, the dead steer,
the book, </i>none of it means anything.

575
00:31:54,605 --> 00:31:57,187
I mean, well, I'm sure it meant
something<i> to the artist, but...</i>

576
00:31:58,171 --> 00:32:00,442
- Slow down. What are you trying to say?
- Patterson.

577
00:32:00,901 --> 00:32:02,442
The painting that he sent me.

578
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,413
<i>It wasn't about the image.</i>

579
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:06,394
<i>The paint is radioactive.</i>

580
00:32:06,618 --> 00:32:09,117
<i>Uraninite,
used to make nuclear weapons.</i>

581
00:32:09,408 --> 00:32:11,174
Dina Risi, she must have known.

582
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:13,317
That's why she sent
the painting to Patterson.

583
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:14,955
Transfer me to McGee.

584
00:32:18,652 --> 00:32:20,099
<i>I haven't heard from you.</i>

585
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,062
We're still running facial recognition
on the fake Bartholomew Lemming.

586
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:26,543
<i>I am going to expand
the search to Interpol.</i>

587
00:32:26,603 --> 00:32:30,197
<i>But based on your suggestion,</i>
we did lift a right forefinger

588
00:32:30,257 --> 00:32:33,517
and thumbprint from the carafe our
impostor used<i> in the conference room.</i>

589
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,893
- Did you get a hit?
- No. He doesn't have a record.

590
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:37,676
I want a name, McGee!

591
00:32:40,282 --> 00:32:41,401
He says hi!

592
00:32:45,941 --> 00:32:47,745
You know, the sun's starting to set.

593
00:32:48,623 --> 00:32:50,325
This would be a good place to camp.

594
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,200
No, sir.

595
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:54,586
- No, sir. I want to keep pushing on.
- This mountain at night,

596
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,709
the trail starting to narrow,
big drop-offs.

597
00:32:58,678 --> 00:32:59,916
You got a tenderfoot.

598
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:02,750
No, we camp.

599
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,070
Can you get nerve damage
in your buttocks?

600
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:12,107
You're gonna feel worse
in the morning.

601
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:13,613
Don't say that, boss.

602
00:33:13,673 --> 00:33:14,973
- Beans?
- Yeah. Thanks.

603
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,751
"Mongo like beans."

604
00:33:19,391 --> 00:33:20,414
Mongo.

605
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:26,015
Mongo.
<i>Blazing Saddles.</i>

606
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:27,920
Mel Brooks, genius.

607
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:30,443
What the heck is he talking about?

608
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:32,720
I'm okay.

609
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:35,701
I mean, I'll skip the beans, Sheriff.
Thanks for not offering, though.

610
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:38,163
I got an energy bar at the airport,
so I'm good.

611
00:33:41,843 --> 00:33:43,481
What time is it in London, DiNozzo?

612
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:44,970
It's 3:00 am.

613
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,963
Six hours till I can make the call.

614
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,775
You're not gonna be
with this agency much longer?

615
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:55,180
You get that inheritance,
maybe you think about retiring.

616
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,023
That's yours.

617
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,471
I would get that, boss,
but I got a cramp in my leg.

618
00:34:04,853 --> 00:34:06,795
<i>- Yeah, Gibbs.</i>
- We played a hunch.

619
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:08,498
If Bart is a professional hit man,

620
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:11,307
he would be on his way to Arizona
to silence Dina Risi.

621
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:12,739
The woman who knows too much.

622
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:15,602
<i>We checked all flights
from the D.C. area the last 24 hours,</i>

623
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:17,285
<i>and I think we found something.</i>

624
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:20,483
A corporate jet filed a flight plan
from Washington Executive

625
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:23,961
Hyde Field to a small airport 50 miles
from Mount Pintos.

626
00:34:24,153 --> 00:34:26,423
- It landed two hours ago.
- Whose plane?

627
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:30,133
<i>It's registered to the Sunset Mining
Corporation of Phoenix, Arizona.</i>

628
00:34:30,263 --> 00:34:31,458
<i>Get some sleep.</i>

629
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,052
- Ever heard of Sunset Mining?
- Yeah.

630
00:34:35,425 --> 00:34:38,519
- Who are they?
- Just a slick bunch out of Phoenix.

631
00:34:38,823 --> 00:34:41,205
- They got mines around here?
- Not yet, no.

632
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:43,068
What's that supposed to mean?

633
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,459
Negotiating.

634
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,902
Negotiating for what?

635
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:47,823
Mineral rights.

636
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,752
To an abandoned gold mine.

637
00:34:50,202 --> 00:34:51,704
It's a waste of time, though.

638
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:54,704
I got more gold in my mouth
than is in that whole shaft.

639
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:57,305
Dina and her tree huggers,
they're fighting them.

640
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:00,192
Claim that Sunset Mining...

641
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:02,276
will rape public lands.

642
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:05,215
She knows
they're not looking for gold.

643
00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:10,399
That's what valley fever is about,
you know.

644
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:12,236
I mean,
I'm not afraid of getting it again.

645
00:35:12,296 --> 00:35:14,966
It's just that, you know,
Arizona is a dangerous place.

646
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,932
- And, can we stop soon?
- Just up ahead.

647
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:28,707
That one hit me where I live.

648
00:35:34,536 --> 00:35:36,620
Dina, stop shooting.

649
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,823
This is Sheriff Boyd.

650
00:35:51,768 --> 00:35:53,576
- How did you find me?
- I didn't.

651
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,989
These Feds did.
They're with the Navy.

652
00:35:57,587 --> 00:35:58,786
NCIS.

653
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:04,292
Jack Patterson told me not
to talk to anyone but him.

654
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,541
Yeah, well, Jack Patterson's dead.

655
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:13,506
I mix my own pigments.

656
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:16,978
As the base of my earth tones,
I use clay...

657
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:19,419
that I found near the old mine.

658
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:21,743
When did you suspect
the paint was radioactive?

659
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,506
About a month ago.

660
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,362
I wasn't feeling well.

661
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:29,459
My doctor ran blood tests.

662
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,704
Told me I was exposed to radiation.

663
00:36:32,396 --> 00:36:34,500
So that's what made me suspect
Sunset Mining

664
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,400
was interested
in the mineral rights.

665
00:36:37,344 --> 00:36:39,427
Not for gold, but for uranium.

666
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,974
- You tell anyone?
- I started asking questions.

667
00:36:44,522 --> 00:36:46,825
Thought I was discreet, but,

668
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,749
I started getting paranoid.
Felt I was being followed.

669
00:36:51,452 --> 00:36:53,034
Didn't know who to trust.

670
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,329
Called Jack.

671
00:36:56,646 --> 00:36:58,561
Patterson told you
to send the painting?

672
00:36:58,859 --> 00:36:59,679
Yeah.

673
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,712
He said he'd have it check out.

674
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:08,627
If the mine is a major source
of uranium,

675
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:11,984
it could be worth billions
to Sunset Mining.

676
00:37:12,514 --> 00:37:13,787
Worth killing for.

677
00:37:14,552 --> 00:37:15,903
How did Jack die?

678
00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:18,300
He was shot on his way to see us.

679
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:20,594
We're pretty sure
it was a professional hit.

680
00:37:20,735 --> 00:37:22,192
It's not safe up here.

681
00:37:22,948 --> 00:37:24,395
We got to get down the mountain.

682
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:27,931
Great. Just when I was getting the
feeling back in my lower extremities.

683
00:37:37,566 --> 00:37:39,920
You know, you might want to let go
of that horn, junior.

684
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,845
Riding a horse is like making love.

685
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:44,034
You got to relax and enjoy it.

686
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:46,689
Sheriff, I have a strong feeling
that you and I enjoy both

687
00:37:46,756 --> 00:37:49,911
of those activities in really
different ways, no disrespect.

688
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:55,385
Boss, we've got you on satellite here
and MTAC. You've got company.

689
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:57,672
There's an aircraft moving low
over the landscape.

690
00:37:57,794 --> 00:37:59,267
- What direction?
<i>- West.</i>

691
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:00,929
<i>It is closing in on you.</i>

692
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:04,506
- Head for the rocks.
- What's going on?

693
00:38:04,634 --> 00:38:05,961
Go! Move! Move!

694
00:38:25,384 --> 00:38:26,084
Go!

695
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:29,353
Keep going! Go!

696
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:38,395
The rocks. Take cover.

697
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:44,387
All right.

698
00:38:44,528 --> 00:38:45,608
Behind the rocks.

699
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,093
Boss, he's coming back!

700
00:38:48,365 --> 00:38:49,490
I'm all right, Gibbs.

701
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:53,891
Get the Henry.
It pulls to the right.

702
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:52,936
Boss, you okay?

703
00:39:55,688 --> 00:39:56,688
Boss?!

704
00:39:58,421 --> 00:39:59,695
<i>Yeah. I'm fine here.</i>

705
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,479
Well, take it easy, Sheriff.

706
00:40:08,827 --> 00:40:11,916
Now we've got to round up the horses.
How do you do that?

707
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:20,660
Howdy, partner.
Welcome back to the fort.

708
00:40:21,562 --> 00:40:23,125
I'm surprised you can sit down.

709
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,663
You humor me, Tim.

710
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:27,584
That lawyer call?

711
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:30,325
Tony was notified
he would be calling at 9:00.

712
00:40:30,673 --> 00:40:32,583
That is just a couple minutes away.

713
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:33,908
Yes, it is.

714
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:37,249
- How's the sheriff, boss?
- He's going to be fine.

715
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:39,118
Driving the nurses nuts.

716
00:40:39,178 --> 00:40:41,492
FBI lifted
a thumbprint off of his body.

717
00:40:41,781 --> 00:40:43,386
Real name is Jerome Sax.

718
00:40:43,446 --> 00:40:45,673
Lived in Oregon.
Had a wife and two kids.

719
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:49,191
That's my future calling. Excuse me.

720
00:40:50,263 --> 00:40:52,521
Yes, Mr. Hubbard.
How are you, sir?

721
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,041
He was a little league coach,
deacon of his church.

722
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,605
Wife thought he was a factory rep

723
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:58,706
who traveled out of town
on company business.

724
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:02,059
So far, Ballistics tie him
to four unsolved murders.

725
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:05,425
- They think there'll be more.
- That is unbelievable!

726
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:10,533
The Phoenix D.A.'s
investigating Sunset Mining.

727
00:41:10,696 --> 00:41:13,296
Three executives are expected
to be indicted for the involvement

728
00:41:13,356 --> 00:41:16,914
in the death of Special Agent Patterson,
and the mining scam.

729
00:41:17,037 --> 00:41:18,919
Okay, well, thank you very much.

730
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,621
Yes, thank you very much.

731
00:41:21,874 --> 00:41:23,321
All right. See you, pal.

732
00:41:26,475 --> 00:41:29,522
Did...
Uncle Clive leave a big estate?

733
00:41:31,818 --> 00:41:33,226
Huge!

734
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:37,327
24 million pounds!

735
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,111
That's over $35 million.

736
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:43,682
Yes! Yes, it is!

737
00:41:46,877 --> 00:41:48,449
Yes, it is!

738
00:41:49,278 --> 00:41:52,225
And he left it all
to my sniveling cousin Crispian.

739
00:41:53,504 --> 00:41:57,078
I mean, I'll give you,
granted he did take care of Uncle Clive

740
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:00,139
when he was ill,
and he gave a very moving eulogy.

741
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:02,980
Why is the lawyer calling you?

742
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:09,250
When I was in college, I borrowed
$10,000 from Uncle Clive, and,

743
00:42:10,206 --> 00:42:12,085
I guess I signed an IOU.

744
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:15,731
I don't really remember, but Crispian
says that he found this document.

745
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:18,197
Said "IOU", and that I owe him

746
00:42:18,257 --> 00:42:21,343
that $10,000 plus compounded
interest over the last 20 years.

747
00:42:21,897 --> 00:42:23,845
Do you know how much that is,
by the way?

748
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:29,012
I am sorry for your loss.

749
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:43,747
It's only money.
