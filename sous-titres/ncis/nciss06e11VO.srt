2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,703
I can't. I'm still working.

3
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:17,070
Hey, this is my big week, man.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,396
I made more tips today than
all last month.

5
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,465
Yeah, I got four more deliveries.

6
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:23,733
Yeah, I'll hook up with you
around 7:00.

7
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:25,882
Yeah, whatever.

www.Team-NCIS.com

12
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:27,902
I used to love this game as a kid.

13
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:29,467
Oh, me too.

14
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:31,655
My mother preferred
I played with dolls.

15
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:33,185
My favorite was G.I. Joe.

16
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,888
David, thank you.

17
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,858
My pleasure.
I enjoy shopping...

18
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:38,895
especially when it's not my money.

19
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:44,920
Good.

20
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:49,908
That was security.
A Detective Kemp is on his way up.

21
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:52,363
- Anyone know where Gibbs is?
- Detective Justin Kemp?

22
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:54,991
That's the one. Metro Homicide.
Why, do you know him?

23
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:57,410
Sort of... you know...

24
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:00,025
What does that mean?

25
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:01,790
We have a mutual friend.

26
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,494
I used to date Kemp's wife.

27
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:07,629
How...

28
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,798
many dates we talking about here?

29
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:11,925
Guys, what's it matter?
I don't know.

30
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,094
Like two, or three?

31
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,595
Four.

32
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:17,222
- Not a big deal.
- Oh, it's...

33
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:18,932
Four months.
At least four months.

34
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:20,600
- That is...
- That is a big deal.

35
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,064
So what's Kemp doing here?

36
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:26,439
Investigating a home invasion robbery.
Double homicide, it's an older couple.

37
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:28,299
And how does that involve us?

38
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:30,359
They don't want to discuss it
on the phone.

39
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:37,586
Close your mouth, Ziva.
He's married.

40
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:41,162
- Kemp.
- DiNozzo.

41
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:44,313
- Special Agent Gibbs.
- Sorry to ruin your Christmas.

42
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,667
It's December 23rd.

43
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:47,307
We're not going anywhere.

44
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:50,380
Found fingerprints at the crime scene.
Ran them through AFIS...

45
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:53,883
I got a hit, a Ned Quinn.
A former petty officer.

46
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:55,264
Vietnam vet.

47
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:57,595
We had a witness,

48
00:02:58,783 --> 00:03:00,849
a delivery boy.
Worked with our sketch artist.

49
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,256
Looks like an older version of...

50
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:11,060
- him.
- Can't be.

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,819
Quinn died in a fire in 1991.

52
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,278
That's why I'm here.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,698
According to V.A. records,
Quinn's buried at Arlington.

54
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:19,110
McGee, pull a copy
of the death certificate.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,386
Boss, this is not good.

56
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:27,834
It's a sixpence.

57
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:29,651
What does it have to do
with Christmas?

58
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,662
Everything, Abby.
It's a tradition.

59
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:34,007
That coin has been baked, well,
steamed actually,

60
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,574
into every Mallard Christmas pudding
since the 1850s.

61
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:40,597
It brings good fortune and luck
in the coming year

62
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:43,016
to whoever finds it on their plate.

63
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:45,350
Assuming
they don't choke to death on it.

64
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,312
Sadly,

65
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,197
with no extended family here,
I've let the tradition lapse.

66
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,482
Next year, Ducky,

67
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:55,111
you and me, we're going
to make Christmas pudding.

68
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:56,237
I'd like that.

69
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:59,134
I like everything about Christmas.
Except for...

70
00:03:59,194 --> 00:04:01,534
that Chipmunk song. And shopping,
I hate shopping. I never know

71
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:03,334
what do get anyone, specially Gibbs.

72
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:05,830
What do you get for the guy that has
nothing and wants nothing?

73
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:07,654
Some squeaky shoes.

74
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:09,125
Hi, Gibbs!

75
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:12,508
Bye, Gibbs.

76
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,321
Something wrong, Jethro?

77
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:18,362
Fingerprints found
at a double homicide yesterday.

78
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,096
Belong to a petty officer who's supposed
to have been dead 17 years.

79
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:25,600
- His death certificate.
- Oh, dear.

80
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,852
Someone's in trouble.

81
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:34,994
I signed it?

82
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:45,451
Graduated with honors
from the University of Virginia.

83
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:47,144
He was accepted
to its medical school,

84
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,060
but didn't go.
Enlisted in the Navy.

85
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:50,763
Became a corpsman instead.

86
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,514
Attached to the First Battalion,
Ninth Marines.

87
00:04:53,574 --> 00:04:54,723
The walking dead.

88
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:57,702
Came home from Vietnam in 1972.

89
00:04:57,762 --> 00:05:00,997
Was treated at V.A.
for post traumatic stress disorder.

90
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:04,516
Quinn became addicted to methamphetamine
and was in and out of rehab.

91
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:07,028
His wife divorced him in 1980,

92
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:09,852
and got full custody of
their three-year-old daughter Melissa.

93
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:12,274
He started living on the streets and
supposedly died

94
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:15,316
with seven others in a fire
at a halfway house on Canal Street.

95
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,820
There was nothing to hint that Quinn
was alive until yesterday's murders.

96
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,446
A lot of years in between.

97
00:05:20,627 --> 00:05:22,461
Where's the ex-wife and
the daughter now?

98
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:25,743
Wife lives in Alexandria and
the daughter lives in Clearfield.

99
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:26,911
McGee, go with her.

100
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,264
<i>... massive charring.</i>

101
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:32,639
<i>Pugilistic contractions
of the extremities.</i>

102
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,699
<i>Heat fractions.</i>

103
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,890
<i>Evulsion of the brain...</i>

104
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,538
<i>large and small intestines.</i>

105
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:40,633
My voice had
a deeper timbre in those days.

106
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:43,296
You make a mistake, Duck?

107
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:46,848
The city M.E.

108
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,100
was unable to make a positive
identification from the charred remains.

109
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:52,421
So I was called in in the hope

110
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:56,316
that Quinn's military medical and dental
records could confirm his identity.

111
00:05:56,826 --> 00:05:58,776
Unfortunately, due to the victim's

112
00:05:58,856 --> 00:06:01,291
heavy drug use,
he suffered from meth mouth.

113
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:03,557
Which deteriorated his teeth

114
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:06,367
and made a dental match impossible.

115
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:07,484
DNA?

116
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,287
That was not an option back then.

117
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,620
All I had to go by was an examination of
the skull and measurement of the bones.

118
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,731
From which I determined only that
it was a male,

119
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,330
Caucasian,
about 40 years old and six foot two.

120
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:23,550
- Well, fit Quinn's description then.
- And since

121
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:27,518
the remains were found in Quinn's room
with all of Quinn's personal effects,

122
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:30,444
we both naturally
reached a circumstantial

123
00:06:30,504 --> 00:06:32,060
and logical conclusion.

124
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:33,515
What's more,

125
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:36,272
nobody turned up
claiming to be Quinn.

126
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:40,437
Well, if it wasn't him,

127
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:43,037
then maybe...

128
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:45,406
he killed someone and
covered it up with the fire.

129
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,196
In Quinn's file,

130
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:50,550
it says that he was treated
for his PTSD at Bethesda.

131
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:54,315
By a psychiatrist,
one Dr...

132
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,207
Dr. Pryor.

133
00:06:57,394 --> 00:06:59,340
Yes. As I recall, he's still there.

134
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,725
I need to talk to him.

135
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,261
Thanks for coming over, Mom. I just
have to get a few stocking stuffers.

136
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:12,147
Go, go. As long as I'm home by 6:30
to help your father brine the turkey.

137
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:13,442
You know how he gets.

138
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:15,645
Have you seen my car keys?

139
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:17,697
Jordie, did you take my keys?

140
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:19,398
I'll get it.
Hang on, hang on.

141
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,293
You stay here, my sweet boy.

142
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,205
Afternoon. NCIS.

143
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:28,293
I'm Special Agent Timothy McGee,
looking for Melissa Fox.

144
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:29,588
Who is it, Mom?

145
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,663
- Are you Connie Wheeler?
- Yes.

146
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:37,375
We need to ask you some questions
about your former husband, Ned Quinn.

147
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:42,004
Fingerprints found
at a crime scene match his.

148
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,172
Look...

149
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:44,841
that can't be.

150
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:47,300
He's been dead for 20 years.

151
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:49,433
If he were alive,

152
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:51,564
do you have
any idea where he might be?

153
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,666
I couldn't even offer a clue.

154
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:58,543
He's been out of our lives
since the divorce.

155
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,649
Melissa, have you had any contact
with your father?

156
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:03,564
Her father...

157
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:05,532
is my husband Ed.

158
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,239
He raised Melissa since
she was four years old.

159
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,950
Ned Quinn has never been
a part of her life.

160
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:13,911
I only have vague memories of him.

161
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:17,415
If he is still alive,
I don't want him to know where we are.

162
00:08:17,774 --> 00:08:20,000
He's already destroyed
our lives once.

163
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:22,170
- Mommy, Mommy, I'm done.
- I'm sorry, excuse me.

164
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:29,776
When he came back from Vietnam...

165
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:35,322
he was a drug addict.

166
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:39,093
I tried, but he didn't want my help.

167
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:40,775
I moved on.

168
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:43,844
We both moved on.

169
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:46,694
I don't remember Quinn.

170
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:50,019
Apparently
we treated him over a three year period,

171
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,638
1979 to '82.

172
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:53,534
What were you treating him for?

173
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:55,785
He suffered from survivor guilt.

174
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:57,914
Blamed himself for a buddy's death.

175
00:08:58,463 --> 00:08:59,456
Oh, my God.

176
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:02,126
I heard there was a Santa
in the building.

177
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,964
Abby...

178
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:05,338
He's great. Rosy cheeks,

179
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:07,340
wire-rim glasses.

180
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:09,654
Your beard looks so real...

181
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:10,949
That's because it is.

182
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,467
Abigail,
Dr. Pryor is a psychiatrist.

183
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:14,863
He's here to help me find...

184
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:17,301
To find out who's naughty and
who's nice. Hello?

185
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,185
You think I could get a picture?

186
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:24,649
Why did Quinn blame himself
for his friend's death?

187
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:27,751
Well, he and another corpsman

188
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:30,279
switched patrols a week
before their tour was to end.

189
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,324
The other guy
got killed in an ambush.

190
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:36,827
You last saw him in '82.
The fire was in '91.

191
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:40,533
Have you any idea of anything that
happened in the intervening years?

192
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:43,334
No. Like a lot of those guys,
he stopped coming.

193
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:44,533
They give up.

194
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:46,462
Did he have any violent tendencies?

195
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:47,880
I don't remember.

196
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:51,384
I have to be at the Children's Hospital
party in 30 minutes.

197
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:55,041
Anything that I once knew about the man
is in here.

198
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:57,598
Thank you, Dr. Pryor.

199
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,406
Merry Christmas.

200
00:10:05,227 --> 00:10:06,334
Thank you, Santa.

201
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:12,615
I just suffered
for hours through the...

202
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:15,388
good doctor's rambling notes.

203
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:19,864
There is nothing to suggest
aggressive or impulsive behavior.

204
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:21,859
Per his service record,

205
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:25,543
Quinn left Vietnam on
December 30, 1972.

206
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:28,951
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall
listed 58,000

207
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,418
plus names of the dead and
missing in chronological order.

208
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:35,056
According to its Web site,
17 military personnel died that week.

209
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:38,723
Of that number, two were in <i>Long Khanh</i>
Province where Quinn was stationed.

210
00:10:38,882 --> 00:10:40,587
Only one was a Navy corpsman.

211
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:42,741
Roger Laurence Grant.

212
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:43,877
Yeah.

213
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:47,148
After the Vietnam Memorial
was dedicated,

214
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,609
Quinn went regularly to the wall

215
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:52,007
to pay tribute to his fallen friend.

216
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,907
If Quinn is still alive,
there's a chance

217
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:58,302
he might honor Roger Grant's memory

218
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:02,045
by visiting the Memorial
on the anniversary of his death.

219
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:03,884
December 24th.

220
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,341
Tomorrow.

221
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:11,130
- He does not dress like a cop.
- Who?

222
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:13,132
Your Detective Kemp.

223
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,010
You are a little fascinated by him.

224
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,304
- He come from money?
- Married it.

225
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:20,306
We're missing
the office Christmas party.

226
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:21,918
That could have been you.

227
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:24,518
- What is her name?
- Guy in the blue hoodie.

228
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:26,735
Could be Quinn.
Go check him out.

229
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,529
Too young, too fat, too female.

230
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:32,812
Answer my question.

231
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,070
She pretty?

232
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,570
Gorgeous.

233
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,804
She was perfect, okay?

234
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:42,445
Witty, smart.

235
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,701
That was 12 years ago. She's had kids.
God knows what she looks like now.

236
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:51,072
So...

237
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:53,134
what happened?

238
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,140
You ever...

239
00:11:58,507 --> 00:11:59,507
regret...

240
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,558
not having a wife

241
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:04,302
and kids?

242
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:08,349
Especially during this time of year.

243
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:10,814
<i>Hanukkah</i> is all about family.

244
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,387
Is it not the same with Christmas?

245
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,488
I'm gonna check out
the guy in the blue hoodie.

246
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:20,263
It is a woman!

247
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:22,219
Hey, Gibbs.

248
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,286
The party's starting
to wind down up there.

249
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:27,123
Hollander had to be sent home
in a cab, fourth year in a row.

250
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:29,750
I brought you and McGee some eggnog.

251
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,170
Right.
Two for McGee.

252
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:36,367
Speaking of McGee...

253
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:38,013
and Ziva...

254
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:39,218
and Tony...

255
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:42,658
It's Christmas Eve.

256
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:44,432
- Go home.
- I can't.

257
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,298
- I have to go shopping.
- Then do it.

258
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:49,186
I don't know what to get anybody.
What do you think Tony needs?

259
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:52,356
- An attitude adjustment.
- Gibbs, you're not helping.

260
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:54,275
Right this way, please.

261
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:58,019
- Hi.
- Abs.

262
00:12:58,865 --> 00:12:59,905
Merry Christmas.

263
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:05,578
Boss, this is Melissa Fox,
Ned Quinn's daughter.

264
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:09,002
Melissa, this is Special Agent Gibbs.
He's in charge of the case.

265
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:11,208
- Hi.
- Hi.

266
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,798
Thank you for seeing me,
Agent Gibbs.

267
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:22,178
I just wanted to make it clear
that...

268
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:24,394
my mother doesn't speak for me.

269
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,649
She wants no part of my father.

270
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,907
I do.

271
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:34,732
I have all
these childhood memories of him.

272
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,569
Maybe they're just fantasies, but...

273
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:42,727
don't get me wrong.
My stepfather is...

274
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:44,277
wonderful.

275
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:48,122
But I hoped...

276
00:13:48,182 --> 00:13:50,589
one day to connect
with my biological father.

277
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:52,892
Did you try?

278
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:56,336
My mother protected me from him.

279
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,632
She didn't even tell me when
he died.

280
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,697
How'd you find out?

281
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:04,220
I did a search when I was 21.

282
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:07,138
Excuse me.

283
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:10,947
He's here.
Should we take him down?

284
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:11,795
<i>No.</i>

285
00:14:11,997 --> 00:14:13,863
I'm on my way.
Thanks.

286
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:17,260
Sorry about that.

287
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,536
I'm still reeling from the possibility
that he might be alive.

288
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:26,596
Unlike my mother,

289
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,898
I'd very much like to see him.

290
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,954
It's like a piece of me is missing.

291
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:04,089
No matter how many times
I come here,

292
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:06,985
it still gets to me.

293
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:14,915
You look at a name,

294
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:18,519
you have to look at
a reflection of yourself.

295
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,627
You are among the fallen.

296
00:15:27,022 --> 00:15:27,853
Yeah.

297
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,349
Difference is you can leave...

298
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:34,920
the names don't.

299
00:15:38,463 --> 00:15:39,163
No.

300
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:42,628
Death is permanent.

301
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:46,823
Except in your case, Ned Quinn.

302
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,032
It's been a long time since
anybody's called me that.

303
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,053
He hasn't said a word since
we brought him in here.

304
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,473
Not surprising for a man
who spent 17 years hiding.

305
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,435
Skin and eyes clear,
good hygiene, no tremors.

306
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:19,063
Clean and sober.

307
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:21,094
All he had on him was eight dollars

308
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:24,468
and a key to a long-term downtown
hotel room. No ID.

309
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,194
Metro P.D. is on the way
to pick you up.

310
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,694
You'll be their problem.

311
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,467
That's your buddy.

312
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:46,085
Petty Officer Grant.

313
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:49,093
Corpsman.

314
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:51,331
Just like you.

315
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,427
Corpsman saved my life once.

316
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:03,065
So you're a former Marine, huh?

317
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,891
So what happened
at the Taylor house then?

318
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:13,784
Your fingerprints
were all over the place.

319
00:17:15,223 --> 00:17:16,340
I didn't kill them.

320
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:18,854
You were there.

321
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:21,083
Why?

322
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:24,366
I was out on the street
with my sign,

323
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:27,844
looking for work, and the Taylors
picked me up. They needed help...

324
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,677
decorating their house
for the holidays.

325
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:33,600
You never met them before?

326
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,807
No, they said it was
their traditional way of extending

327
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:39,844
a helping hand to
those less fortunate.

328
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:43,312
Well, if you didn't kill them,
who did?

329
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:46,137
I don't know.

330
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:49,808
I was in the garage.
I was digging...

331
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:52,387
decorations out of boxes.

332
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:55,502
When I got back, I found them.

333
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:58,250
There was blood everywhere.

334
00:17:58,726 --> 00:18:00,431
The husband was already dead.

335
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:02,041
The wife was on the couch.

336
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:05,855
<i>I put her on the floor,
I tried to administer CPR.</i>

337
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:07,677
<i>But it was too late.</i>

338
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,991
- I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

339
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,551
I want to catch the city M.E.
before he leaves his office.

340
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,351
Wish me luck.

341
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:17,412
Why'd you run?

342
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:22,414
I'd been dead for 17 years.

343
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,202
Who's gonna believe me?

344
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,804
How long has Quinn lived here?

345
00:18:29,223 --> 00:18:29,953
Who?

346
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:32,603
The guy in this room.

347
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:33,864
Rembrandt?

348
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:41,163
I've been here 12 years.
He's been here longer than that.

349
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:42,831
Rembrandt ever give you any trouble?

350
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:47,481
Never. Pays his rent every Saturday,
in cash. Keeps to himself.

351
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:49,226
All right.

352
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,801
We'll say good-bye to you
downstairs.

353
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,724
Bye.

354
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:54,405
Downstairs. Thanks.

355
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,956
Guy's got some personality.

356
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:07,398
Check this out.

357
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,843
That's pretty good.

358
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:12,836
Not what I expected to find.

359
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:15,486
Not what I expected to be doing
on Christmas Eve.

360
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,790
- What did you expect to be doing?
- Not this.

361
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:21,160
You had no plans.

362
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:22,242
I had plans.

363
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,051
I had big plans.

364
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:25,621
Big, big plans.

365
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:31,422
I was ten blocks away
when the fire broke out.

366
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,262
So who died in your room?

367
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:36,106
Another tweaker.

368
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:38,914
I didn't know him.

369
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:43,684
He told me where I could cop. I told him
he could crash there till I got back.

370
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,680
When I did, there were...

371
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,719
fire engines and cop cars
all over the place.

372
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:52,109
Why didn't you just identify
yourself?

373
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,390
I realized they thought
I was in the room.

374
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,897
And in a rare, lucid moment,

375
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:03,089
it occurred to me
that my ex-wife and my daughter...

376
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,659
might be better off...

377
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,647
if I was dead and...

378
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,767
they could receive
my military benefits.

379
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,632
That was the only decent thing
I ever did for them.

380
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:17,753
So you disappeared.

381
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,780
You hid.

382
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:22,347
It's not hard
if no one's looking for you.

383
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,975
You work for cash,

384
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,144
<i>you pay cash for what you buy,</i>

385
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,868
<i>you don't need a name.</i>

386
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,628
<i>- Did you leave D.C.?
- Thought about it, but never did.</i>

387
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:37,026
Abby, I thought you went home.

388
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,620
Did Gibbs tell him that his daughter
was here and she wants to meet him?

389
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:41,491
No.

390
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,577
He has to.
It means everything to her.

391
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,611
Abby, this is not
a lost puppy for you to rescue.

392
00:20:46,671 --> 00:20:49,019
You cannot make this better.
This is a murder investigation.

393
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,709
I think Gibbs should tell him.

394
00:20:51,673 --> 00:20:52,740
And I think...

395
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:55,096
you should stay out of this.

396
00:20:57,337 --> 00:20:59,673
Missed the party,
don't have to miss the food.

397
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:02,054
Hey, Ducky,
I found these in the conference room.

398
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,487
They're pretty delish.

399
00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:06,224
You might want to try some of this,
Ducky. It's pretty good stuff.

400
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:08,111
No, thank you.

401
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:10,854
- What'd you find out at his place?
- Nothing to tie him to the murders.

402
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:13,943
Appears to have led
a non-criminal and invisible life.

403
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:16,735
Actually, he's an artist,
sketches.

404
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:17,902
Pretty good stuff.

405
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:19,488
- You catch the M.E.?
- Yes.

406
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:22,150
Mr. Taylor died of blunt force trauma
to the head

407
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,993
from what appears
to be several strikes of a hammer.

408
00:21:25,073 --> 00:21:26,952
Mrs. Taylor, heart attack.

409
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:31,250
Ligature marks on her wrists suggest
that she was restrained by handcuffs.

410
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,711
But what is much more interesting:
our suspect...

411
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:38,507
is telling the truth.
He was trying to save Mrs. Taylor.

412
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,134
- How do you know that?
- Quinn's bloody fingerprints

413
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:42,511
knew what they were doing.

414
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,514
And compression bruises
on her chest suggest

415
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:48,936
he was trying to perform CPR,
Jethro.

416
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:51,852
And he knew to put her
on a hard surface, the floor.

417
00:21:53,518 --> 00:21:56,229
Kill the husband, try and save the wife?
Doesn't make sense.

418
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:59,773
- Kemp's here to pick up Quinn.
- I will go get him.

419
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,343
Keep him here till I get back.

420
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,062
How can he eat those things?

421
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:09,691
Yeah?

422
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,218
Nice work finding Quinn so fast.

423
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:16,461
I got a lot of help from Ducky.

424
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,798
Same guy that declared him dead
17 years ago.

425
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:21,216
Well...

426
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:22,930
Jackie is furious.

427
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,107
I was supposed to be home hours ago.

428
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:28,557
All right,
time to start the Christmas holiday.

429
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:35,157
You're not here to wish me
a merry Christmas, are you?

430
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:38,253
I can't get a handle on Quinn.

431
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:41,760
He faked his own death and
we can place him at the crime scene.

432
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:44,072
But you don't think he did it?

433
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:47,826
I think we may be handing over
an innocent man to Metro.

434
00:22:47,907 --> 00:22:50,191
And you're concerned
they think they've got a slam-dunk case.

435
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:51,882
They're not gonna look any further.

436
00:22:56,998 --> 00:22:59,925
This was taken last Christmas.

437
00:23:01,057 --> 00:23:02,090
Is that your wife?

438
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:07,019
Nobody looks that good
in a bikini after two kids.

439
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:09,431
That hotel is awesome.
Is that a Ritz-Carlton?

440
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:12,184
No, no, that's...
that's my father-in-law's villa.

441
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,396
So, where's Gibbs?

442
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,280
I need to get Quinn downtown.

443
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,910
We're gonna hold him here,
Detective Kemp.

444
00:23:21,493 --> 00:23:23,403
- Leon Vance.
- Director.

445
00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:26,531
The Navy's got unfinished business
with former Petty Officer Quinn.

446
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:27,991
What exactly?

447
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:30,327
Faked his death.

448
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,162
His family collected death benefits.

449
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,915
With all due respect, Director,
I've got him for a double homicide.

450
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:36,041
Not even close.

451
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:38,752
You know you won't be able to get
Quinn in front of a judge for days.

452
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,118
Relax. Enjoy a little family time.

453
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:43,737
What am I missing?

454
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:47,091
Why is NCIS interfering
with a Metro case?

455
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,813
Fine. Tomorrow's Christmas.

456
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,374
I've got two bikes and
a dollhouse to put together.

457
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,492
We'll be back with a court order
the day after tomorrow.

458
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:00,123
Let's go.

459
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:02,188
You asked for it.
You better work fast.

460
00:24:02,248 --> 00:24:03,424
You only have a day.

461
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:06,982
- Merry Christmas.
- Hey, guys. What's up?

462
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:09,283
I hope no one has plans.

463
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:24,548
Keep Quinn in interrogation.

464
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,882
- We'll watch him in shifts.
- What do I do?

465
00:24:27,123 --> 00:24:28,635
You and Duck go home.

466
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:30,679
It's late.
Get some sleep.

467
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,473
Oh, I haven't slept on Christmas Eve
since I was, like, four.

468
00:24:33,553 --> 00:24:36,852
Since I started camping out in front of
the fireplace trying to catch Santa.

469
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,808
I should have pulled
a fingerprint off his milk glass.

470
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:41,256
I may need you both tomorrow.

471
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:44,875
Yes, I have to go visit Mother
in her new home.

472
00:24:45,112 --> 00:24:47,024
May I walk you to your car?

473
00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:48,446
How is she?

474
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:50,657
Driving the nurses crazy.

475
00:24:50,747 --> 00:24:53,827
Kemp is focused on Quinn's fingerprints.
He's not looking at anything else.

476
00:24:54,564 --> 00:24:56,872
- Do our own investigation.
- Visit the crime scene?

477
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,665
- Kemp will go ballistic.
- Boss,

478
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,224
I googled the dead couple
for background information.

479
00:25:01,284 --> 00:25:02,939
Found something interesting here.

480
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:05,139
Six months ago,
the husband, Avery Taylor,

481
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:07,768
filed a multi-million-dollar
patent-infringement lawsuit

482
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:09,563
against Paradigm Industries.

483
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:11,438
Get out of town.

484
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:12,758
What?

485
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:15,890
Paradigm Industries
is owned by Gary Vanderlicht.

486
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:20,108
Metro Detective Justin Kemp's
filthy-rich father-in-law?

487
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:31,448
All right, that's it.
I know when I'm beaten.

488
00:25:31,804 --> 00:25:33,889
How are we going to get
the game back in the box

489
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,683
and make it look like
it was never opened?

490
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:39,289
I am an expert at repacking and
re-wrapping.

491
00:25:39,753 --> 00:25:43,626
Christmas mornings, I knew what was
in each present under the tree.

492
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,836
You peeked?

493
00:25:46,036 --> 00:25:47,303
<i>Is anybody in there?</i>

494
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,132
<i>Agent Gibbs?</i>

495
00:25:56,127 --> 00:25:58,058
When are the police
coming to pick me up?

496
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:00,233
Not for a while.

497
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:03,772
Because of the holiday,
shifts are not fully staffed.

498
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,650
I think you know more
than you're telling me.

499
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:09,944
Are you hungry?

500
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:12,319
Do you need anything?

501
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:15,741
A pencil and paper.

502
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:18,179
I can't sleep.

503
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:20,247
Sketching relaxes me.

504
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:23,750
Oh, yeah, I know,

505
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:25,463
sharp object.

506
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:29,636
I promise I won't stab myself.

507
00:26:36,243 --> 00:26:38,306
Not a happy Christmas morning
for the Taylors.

508
00:26:40,137 --> 00:26:41,597
Hey, wanna make this interesting?

509
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:44,938
I bet you five bucks I can crack the
alarm code before you can pick the lock.

510
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:46,898
I will take that bet.

511
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:47,887
Okay.

512
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:53,308
How did you do that?

513
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:55,532
The one, the four,
the seven and the nine are worn.

514
00:26:55,612 --> 00:26:57,814
The code had to be a combination
of those four numbers.

515
00:26:57,874 --> 00:27:00,161
People like to choose numbers
that are easy to remember:

516
00:27:00,257 --> 00:27:02,574
address, anniversary,
birthday, birth year.

517
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:04,765
Being a good Boy Scout,
I came prepared.

518
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:08,378
The Taylors were born in 1947.

519
00:27:10,484 --> 00:27:11,715
Five bucks.

520
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:18,873
Sorry, loser.

521
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,809
- What do we think the police missed?
- If we believe Quinn,

522
00:27:29,156 --> 00:27:31,901
he found the wife's body
on the couch and moved it on the floor.

523
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:34,446
- They wouldn't have known that.
- Got it.

524
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:38,302
Kemp's investigation focused
on the fingerprint evidence

525
00:27:38,362 --> 00:27:40,912
and the couple's bodies,
which were found here...

526
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,242
and here.

527
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:44,322
Let's check out
the rest of the house.

528
00:27:48,261 --> 00:27:49,326
That's good.

529
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:51,386
So were the sketches in your room.

530
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,877
Did you take art classes in college?

531
00:27:57,723 --> 00:27:58,423
No.

532
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:00,680
Rehab.

533
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,726
I guess being pre-med,

534
00:28:04,806 --> 00:28:08,229
you don't really have a lot of time
to take electives.

535
00:28:10,186 --> 00:28:11,691
You wanted to be a doctor.

536
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:19,639
'Nam changed things.

537
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:23,344
Looks like a chair was moved.

538
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:26,039
Found fibers, hair and...

539
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,303
- Watch!
- A button.

540
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:32,683
Found the chair.

541
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:37,258
Looks like somebody wanted
to get something on the upper shelf.

542
00:28:39,883 --> 00:28:40,887
It's a safe.

543
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:42,816
It's empty.

544
00:28:42,876 --> 00:28:45,644
I'm guessing Metro police got it wrong.
The robbery netted more

545
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:48,269
than just the jewelry the wife
was wearing and the husband's cash.

546
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:49,396
Dust it.

547
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:50,871
Security patrol.

548
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:56,936
Who are you guys?

549
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:58,822
NCIS.

550
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:00,865
We received an alarm.

551
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:04,101
I thought you turned it off?

552
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,121
It's
our top-of-the-line HS 3000 system.

553
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:07,747
It's a double-redundant.

554
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:10,333
If you don't punch in the code twice,
it sends a silent alarm.

555
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:13,266
Double redundancy,
how could I know that?

556
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:15,561
Thought the police had a suspect.

557
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,467
- What are you guys doing here?
- They asked for our help.

558
00:29:18,697 --> 00:29:19,930
They didn't tell us.

559
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:21,511
We got work to do.

560
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,830
NCIS...

561
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:25,890
heard about you guys.

562
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:29,144
I've been in the private
security business for three years.

563
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:31,104
Doesn't pay very well.

564
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:34,659
Does NCIS take applications?

565
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:41,823
Merry Christmas, Tiny Tim!

566
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:44,696
- What are you doing here?
- Well, today's Christmas.

567
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,244
I just came from church.

568
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:50,206
I didn't have anything planned and
I wanted to be with my team.

569
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:51,767
Where is everybody?

570
00:29:52,144 --> 00:29:53,144
In the field.

571
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:56,784
- How's he doin'?
- You know.

572
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,282
Does he...

573
00:29:58,826 --> 00:30:00,133
mention his daughter?

574
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:01,358
No.

575
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:06,605
- You think he'd like to see her?
- I don't know. Why are you asking?

576
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:12,204
Because Melissa's in the lobby and
she wants to see him.

577
00:30:13,526 --> 00:30:15,281
How did she know that we found him?

578
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:19,359
Well, she might have figured it out
when I called her and told her.

579
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:23,906
Abby, what, what are you doing?
You called her? Gibbs,

580
00:30:24,027 --> 00:30:26,864
- Gibbs is gonna kill you!
- No, he won't.

581
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:28,629
Think about it, Tim.

582
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:30,944
This is
the greatest fairy tale ever.

583
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:33,876
There's a little girl and
her dad leaves.

584
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,196
And then he lives on the streets.
And then he dies.

585
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:39,521
And she's never gonna see him again.

586
00:30:39,696 --> 00:30:41,377
She's never gonna get to say...

587
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,797
all the things that a daughter
wants to say to her father.

588
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:48,125
And then she grows up and
she has a child of her own,

589
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:49,794
and then...

590
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:54,048
wonder of all wonders,
he comes back from the dead

591
00:30:54,763 --> 00:30:56,105
and they get reunited...

592
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:59,086
on Christmas!

593
00:31:00,336 --> 00:31:04,040
- Abby, are you finished?
- Please, please, please, pretty please?

594
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:05,916
Do it for me, okay?

595
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:08,965
Just, just tell him Melissa's here.

596
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:12,669
You'll understand when you see
the sparkle in his eye.

597
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,662
All right.

598
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:25,927
You have a visitor.

599
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,827
- Who?
- Melissa, your daughter.

600
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:39,003
- She's here?
- Yep. Wants to talk to you.

601
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:43,997
I don't want to see her.

602
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:47,785
And you tell her that
she was better off when I was dead.

603
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:51,384
Okay.

604
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:03,309
Here, let me,
let me help you with that.

605
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,508
Got it. Thanks.

606
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,340
So how'd you hook up with NCIS?

607
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,465
See if DiNozzo is finished
in the garage.

608
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:12,465
She's cute.

609
00:32:13,214 --> 00:32:16,675
So, maybe I could, you know... well,

610
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:18,979
good luck with the case.

611
00:32:24,457 --> 00:32:26,336
Think we just got
a Christmas present.

612
00:32:29,418 --> 00:32:30,866
What the hell is going on?!

613
00:32:30,926 --> 00:32:32,951
<i>Metro Police Chief
just gave me an earful.</i>

614
00:32:33,015 --> 00:32:36,031
Claims you broke into their crime scene
and corrupted the chain of evidence.

615
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:38,843
- <i>Tell me you didn't do that.</i>
- How'd he find out?

616
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:40,919
Metro got a call
from the home-security firm.

617
00:32:40,979 --> 00:32:42,247
Come on, Daddy!

618
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,778
This how you spend your Christmas?
<i>Most people are home opening presents.</i>

619
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:47,643
Yeah, most people.

620
00:32:47,705 --> 00:32:49,760
<i>Cops are on their way</i>
to pick up Quinn.

621
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:52,206
- Leon, we're late.
- Get him ready.

622
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:56,663
- Hey, Gibbs.
- Looks like we got the murder weapon.

623
00:32:56,997 --> 00:32:59,392
Blood on the hammer
matches the victim's type.

624
00:33:00,476 --> 00:33:02,128
You're not gonna like this, Gibbs.

625
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:06,069
The prints on the handle
belong to the victim...

626
00:33:06,993 --> 00:33:08,196
and to Ned Quinn.

627
00:33:28,863 --> 00:33:30,185
It looks like mine.

628
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,403
Your prints are on it.

629
00:33:32,465 --> 00:33:36,162
Look, the Taylors hired me to help them
decorate their house.

630
00:33:36,656 --> 00:33:38,102
I brought my toolbox.

631
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:40,320
When I left,

632
00:33:41,108 --> 00:33:42,188
I was in a hurry.

633
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,653
I didn't stop to see
if I brought my hammer.

634
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,902
You said you were in their garage.

635
00:33:50,646 --> 00:33:53,036
- That's where the hammer was found.
- I don't know how it got.

636
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:55,020
What do you want me to tell you?

637
00:33:57,885 --> 00:34:00,178
You know, you're getting harder and
harder to believe.

638
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,666
Right, Sherlock.

639
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:06,003
Vietnam Vet, stoner,
a man with no name.

640
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,346
It's got to be me.

641
00:34:11,978 --> 00:34:13,379
Metro police are here.

642
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:16,311
I will have McGee bring you down.

643
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:28,661
You make it a habit,
keeping people waiting?

644
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:31,184
- What's the rush, Kemp?
- It's Christmas.

645
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:34,271
Maybe if you had a family,
DiNozzo, you'd understand.

646
00:34:35,085 --> 00:34:37,026
How did your daughter
like the dollhouse?

647
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:39,403
She loved it.

648
00:34:39,605 --> 00:34:42,125
Yeah, she took it with her
when she left this morning.

649
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:44,269
- Where did she go?
- A family tradition.

650
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:47,463
Yeah, we spend the week between
Christmas and New Year's at the villa.

651
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,716
Yeah, right now they're
on my father-in-law's G5.

652
00:34:49,776 --> 00:34:52,798
Thanks to you guys, the Chief's
on my ass, wouldn't let me leave.

653
00:34:52,995 --> 00:34:55,077
And if I'm luck
I'm getting out of here late tonight.

654
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:57,888
Well, I really feel for you, Kemp.
Life's tough.

655
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:02,520
- Where's Quinn?
- On the way.

656
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:05,247
You gonna explain to me
why you broke into the crime scene?

657
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:10,926
Are you gonna explain to me why you
didn't remove yourself from this case?

658
00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:12,694
Why would I do that?

659
00:35:12,828 --> 00:35:14,811
Avery Taylor was suing
your father-in-law.

660
00:35:15,376 --> 00:35:17,862
You have no business
investigating Taylor's murder.

661
00:35:17,922 --> 00:35:20,285
- What are you talking about?
- Paradigm Industries?

662
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:22,079
A little case of
patent-infringement?

663
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,785
All right, let me tell you
a couple things. Okay, one:

664
00:35:27,107 --> 00:35:29,692
my father-in-law
is the CEO of a holding company

665
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,158
that owns over a dozen
multi-million-dollar companies,

666
00:35:32,218 --> 00:35:35,162
and two: he never
discusses business with me.

667
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,736
I don't like
what you're insinuating.

668
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:45,172
Are you going to tell him
we found the murder weapon?

669
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:46,843
He never asked.

670
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:52,583
Thanks, I was running on empty.

671
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:55,906
God!

672
00:35:56,723 --> 00:35:58,520
They put nutmeg in it
for the holidays.

673
00:35:59,414 --> 00:36:00,609
What do you got, Abs?

674
00:36:01,734 --> 00:36:04,378
The hair on the couch
belonged to Mrs. Taylor.

675
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:07,474
I'm still working on the fibers.
As for the button Ziva found,

676
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:10,249
it was made exclusively
for a clothing manufacturer

677
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:12,008
in Scranton, Pennsylvania,

678
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:16,862
who specializes exclusively
in military and police uniforms.

679
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:20,135
Dusting the safe
produced an unknown print.

680
00:36:27,205 --> 00:36:28,436
Mistletoe.

681
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:33,608
You run the print through AFIS, Abs?

682
00:36:33,668 --> 00:36:34,368
No.

683
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:37,920
- I didn't say it was a fingerprint.
- Well, what was it, Abby?

684
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:39,403
It was a fabric print.

685
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:42,402
Most likely made from a glove.
Should've worn latex.

686
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:44,216
Leather and fabric gloves

687
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:46,843
have a distinct weave, grain,
wear and stitching pattern.

688
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:51,087
In this case, an old leather one
with U-shaped scuff and a frayed seam.

689
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,712
You bring me a glove, and I'll tell you
if it left a print on the safe.

690
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:57,233
You might've redeemed yourself, Abs.

691
00:36:58,331 --> 00:36:59,420
What'd I do?

692
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:01,760
Called Quinn's daughter. McGee!

693
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:08,492
Got it, Boss.

694
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,666
Taylors' home-security
system interfaces

695
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:13,041
with the company's central
dispatch via the Internet.

696
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:14,293
Your hunch was right.

697
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:17,451
The alarm was deactivated
at 2:17 AM this morning.

698
00:37:17,798 --> 00:37:19,986
Between the time Kemp
sealed the house and you...

699
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:21,046
Broke in.

700
00:37:21,797 --> 00:37:24,679
Well, I was gonna say
gained unauthorized access.

701
00:37:25,486 --> 00:37:27,787
Alarm was reactivated
four and a half minutes later.

702
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:30,643
DiNozzo, call
your ex-girlfriend's husband.

703
00:37:30,747 --> 00:37:33,417
Have him meet us at the Taylors'.
Ziva, get the car.

704
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:35,737
How about Ziva makes the call and
I get the car?

705
00:37:36,663 --> 00:37:37,663
Or not.

706
00:37:38,419 --> 00:37:39,452
I'll do it.

707
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:51,034
You guys really don't have lives,
do you?

708
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,739
What are we doing here?

709
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:54,605
Arresting the murderer.

710
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:57,246
He's in a holding cell,
downtown, Gibbs.

711
00:37:57,357 --> 00:37:59,516
What is it with you people?
First you declare him dead

712
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:01,758
now you're trying to help him
beat a double-homicide rap?

713
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,377
This was a home invasion.

714
00:38:03,437 --> 00:38:05,688
But not for the wife's jewelry
or pocket change.

715
00:38:05,894 --> 00:38:07,360
It was all about the safe.

716
00:38:07,803 --> 00:38:08,983
DiNozzo, break in.

717
00:38:09,265 --> 00:38:10,628
With great pleasure, sir.

718
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:14,488
What safe?

719
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,398
I guess you missed this.

720
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:17,809
Okay.

721
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:20,489
So, what?
It was Quinn.

722
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:22,531
His bloody prints
were all over the place.

723
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:24,928
Yeah, because he was trying
to save the couple's lives.

724
00:38:24,988 --> 00:38:26,931
He was in the garage
at the time of the murders.

725
00:38:27,094 --> 00:38:29,016
Last night,
while Quinn was in our custody,

726
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:31,477
somebody deactivated the alarm and
planted the murder weapon.

727
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:33,663
- A hammer.
- In the garage.

728
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:35,500
Trying to seal the case
against Quinn.

729
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:38,143
Wait, you had a murder weapon and
didn't tell me?

730
00:38:38,908 --> 00:38:41,655
Who knew about the alarm code
other than the Taylors?

731
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:43,863
We have company.

732
00:38:47,615 --> 00:38:48,683
Hi, Harvey.

733
00:38:49,305 --> 00:38:50,614
Hey, what's going on?

734
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:53,600
Lose a button?

735
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,285
Looks just like
the ones on your shirt.

736
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:02,058
Found it on the couch.

737
00:39:02,327 --> 00:39:04,104
Where you handcuffed Mrs. Taylor.

738
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:06,137
Other thing you left behind
was a print...

739
00:39:06,848 --> 00:39:07,964
on the safe.

740
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:11,234
You didn't know that gloves
could leave prints, did you, Harvey?

741
00:39:11,814 --> 00:39:13,421
Are those yours right there?

742
00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:17,541
Look at that.
Frayed seams.

743
00:39:22,164 --> 00:39:23,485
That's a TASER, Harvey.

744
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:24,945
You only have one shot.

745
00:39:25,593 --> 00:39:26,744
Non-fatal.

746
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,789
There's five of us.

747
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:39,581
Don't move!

748
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:44,384
- Just breathe through it.
- God!

749
00:39:47,405 --> 00:39:48,562
He confessed?

750
00:39:49,277 --> 00:39:51,469
He knew they kept cash and
jewelry in their safe.

751
00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:53,495
Didn't know that Quinn
was in the garage.

752
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:56,407
When the wife panicked,
She went into cardiac arrest.

753
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:58,885
The husband freaked,
attacked the security

754
00:39:58,947 --> 00:40:01,342
guard with the only weapon
he could find. Quinn's hammer.

755
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:06,041
- The guard overpowered and killed him.
- Abby, it's beautiful.

756
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:08,770
A cotton-ball bouquet.

757
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:10,283
See what I got.

758
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,579
- Cufflinks, made out of...
- Spent nine-millimeter slugs.

759
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:17,198
Friction makes us static.

760
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:19,727
Would you stop that?!
I'm still humming from the TASER.

761
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:20,968
Ladies and gentlemen,

762
00:40:21,028 --> 00:40:24,022
tonight you're all going to share in
a DiNozzo family tradition.

763
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,534
Caramel popcorn, hot mulled cider

764
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:28,959
and the greatest, greatest

765
00:40:29,378 --> 00:40:31,981
Christmas movie of all time,
<i>It's a Wonderful Life!</i>

766
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:33,158
Wonderful.

767
00:40:35,096 --> 00:40:38,256
- We can't start until Gibbs gets here.
- He said not to wait for him.

768
00:40:38,712 --> 00:40:39,993
Where is he?

769
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:47,911
Where are we?

770
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:51,665
- Melissa's house.
- No, Gibbs.

771
00:40:52,238 --> 00:40:53,521
You don't know me.

772
00:40:54,616 --> 00:40:58,126
- I ruin lives, I am poison.
- Give yourself some credit.

773
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,215
You're not the same person
that dropped out of her life

774
00:41:01,277 --> 00:41:03,508
when she was three years old.
You've changed.

775
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:07,115
- I don't need this. I don't.
- She does.

776
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,362
There's too much time that's passed.

777
00:41:16,337 --> 00:41:18,331
If I had one wish for Christmas,

778
00:41:19,538 --> 00:41:21,428
it would be to hug my daughter.

779
00:41:26,515 --> 00:41:27,796
That can never be.

780
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,039
You have that chance.

781
00:41:51,882 --> 00:41:52,956
Thank you.

782
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:47,845
Merry Christmas, Dad.

783
00:42:48,712 --> 00:42:50,105
<i>Merry Christmas, Son.</i>

784
00:42:51,065 --> 00:42:53,420
Merry Christmas !
