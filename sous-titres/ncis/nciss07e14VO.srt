2
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,040
Okay, I came to a bar with you.
Now let's go.

3
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,718
No. No way.

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,790
I've been listening to you complain
the entire year

5
00:00:12,874 --> 00:00:16,307
you don't have a girlfriend, okay?
All right, well, here they all are.

6
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,014
Yeah, I'm not very good
at picking up girls.

7
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:24,259
Look, even the worst pickup lines
are better than not trying.

8
00:00:24,498 --> 00:00:26,067
Now, come on.
Give me something.

9
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:28,710
So, is it hot in here,
or is it just you?

10
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,436
Give me something else.

11
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:34,271
So, you Jamaican?

12
00:00:35,014 --> 00:00:36,719
'cause you Jamaican me crazy.

13
00:00:39,194 --> 00:00:40,331
I stand corrected.

14
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:42,983
That's absolutely worse
than not trying.

15
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:45,211
Maybe
you should just try being yourself.

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,631
Just be cool.

17
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:53,052
Yeah, well, if I was being myself,
I wouldn't be here.

18
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:55,304
Yeah, I know how you feel.

19
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:58,058
- My name's Lynne.
- Alfonso.

20
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:02,861
If you don't want to be here,
how come...

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,654
Don't have a TV at home?

22
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:13,516
Not being cool?

23
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:15,228
That's...

24
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,930
That's my brother's car.

25
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,035
Roman, what the hell's going on?!

26
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,632
<i>Alfonso, listen carefully.
It's happening.</i>

27
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:30,654
<i>Wherever you are, you've got to run!</i>

28
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:31,718
<i>Now!</i>

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,443
Dancing lessons?
You cannot be serious.

34
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,154
May 25, national tap dance day.
I want to be prepared.

35
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:13,241
- What if you're unprepared?
- Well, the unprepared do not get

36
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,243
invited to the national tap
dance parties,

37
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:19,430
and I want to go.
I got a tweet to go to this blog

38
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,474
that linked me to this holiday site.

39
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,195
Do you know how many holidays there are
that fly underneath the radar?

40
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:27,937
It's astonishing.
Lot of ladies at those parties.

41
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,150
I went to an international talk
like a pirate day party last year.

42
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,193
You did not. Excellent.

43
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:37,782
- Let me hear some pirate speak.
- Why is McGee wearing a tuxedo jacket?

44
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:43,735
Yes.

45
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,581
Tuxedo.

46
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:48,880
It's a bold fashion choice
for a young investigator.

47
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,596
Watch someone get married
at work day?

48
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:55,522
It's an online wedding.

49
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:57,582
Of course it is.

50
00:02:57,842 --> 00:02:59,871
Look, it's a gamer buddy from Spain.

51
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:02,098
He set this up for people
that couldn't make it, okay?

52
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,100
I would be laughing if...

53
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,128
I weren't on the edge of tears.
This is sad.

54
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:07,727
Grab your gear. We got a...

55
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,651
- He's at a wedding.
- In Spain.

56
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:14,110
Boss, it's almost done.

57
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:17,630
Take your time.

58
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:20,853
I think McGee is taking
this technology thing a little too far.

59
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:22,359
And this is coming from the man

60
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:24,745
who follows tweets
to blogs to web sites.

61
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,326
- All done, boss. Thanks.
- Let's go.

62
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,646
Grab your gear.

63
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:33,963
Got an exploding car.
Got a dead Marine.

64
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,263
Could I just have a minute to...

65
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,177
Nope. You've had your minute, McGee.

66
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:43,797
Lucky the blast was isolated.

67
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,143
Considering the debris radius,
this could have been much worse.

68
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,479
- Not for this guy.
- Boss, the car was registered to a...

69
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,072
Lance Corporal Roman Vega,
stationed at Quantico,

70
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:54,949
 just back
from his second tour in Iraq.

71
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:58,029
The chase started at Olive and 29th
when Vega ran a stop sign.

72
00:03:58,315 --> 00:04:00,681
About a half mile later,
the car hit a pothole and kaboom.

73
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,491
Acetone hydroxide.

74
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:04,283
Bless you.

75
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:06,120
It is an explosive, Tony.

76
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:07,715
It was in the trunk.

77
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:10,499
It has a very distinctive odor,
highly volatile.

78
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:12,710
Given the lack
of any discernible trigger

79
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,275
and timing of detonation,

80
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,505
the explosion
was likely an accident.

81
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:20,382
Why would a Marine be driving
around with explosives In his trunk?

82
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,738
We found the torso.

83
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:24,722
Yes, it's resting in peace
around the corner there by...

84
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,196
that dumpster.

85
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,601
It matches
Corporal Vega's general build, but,

86
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,902
the burns are extensive.

87
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:33,360
We will probably need DNA
for a positive identification.

88
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:36,608
In the meantime,
he's ready for his close-up.

89
00:04:37,753 --> 00:04:39,375
We're still missing

90
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:42,074
several major body parts.

91
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:45,451
Yeah, sorry.
I forgot about this.

92
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:52,248
It's the head.

93
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:54,335
- What's left of it.
- DNA.

94
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:56,003
Yeah, landed,

95
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,506
back behind an old bowling alley,
of all places.

96
00:04:59,535 --> 00:05:00,796
I do hope,

97
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:02,341
if the time comes,

98
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:05,221
when your head finds itself
removed from your body,

99
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,592
it is treated with more respect.

100
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,504
- Ducky, I...
- Mr. Palmer!

101
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:10,433
Yes, sir?

102
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:12,658
We are still missing two patellas

103
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:14,403
and a shin bone.

104
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,484
- I didn't mean to be disrespectful.
- Get a tow truck.

105
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:19,587
Right.

106
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,901
That's weird.

107
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:31,128
Weirder than you carrying a head
around in a bag and forgetting about it?

108
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:32,320
What?

109
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,212
See, I get a signal over here.

110
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:38,655
Closer to the car,

111
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,172
drops off in inches.

112
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,758
Yeah, I got a dead spot like that
in my therapist's office.

113
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:46,504
Dead zones are common inside,
but out...

114
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:48,723
Therapist?

115
00:05:50,138 --> 00:05:51,307
Physical therapist.

116
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,852
You seeing a physical therapist?

117
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:55,855
- I hurt my knee.
- How did you do that?

118
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,190
Kneeling.

119
00:05:58,428 --> 00:05:59,593
I don't believe you.

120
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:00,775
Come on.

121
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:14,373
- What's that, a lie detector?
- No. It's a Geiger counter.

122
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,710
I just thought of something that could
cause localized RF interference.

123
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:27,210
Radiation.

124
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:38,848
First plague,
now radiation poisoning.

125
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,094
I'm starting to think
someone really has it in for me.

126
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:44,028
- I was there, too, near the car.
- We all were.

127
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:46,322
But don't let that stop you
from thinking about yourself.

128
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,570
This isn't about me.

129
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,409
It's about my little DiNozzo makers.
They've been nuked.

130
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,079
- I know.
- Do you?

131
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:55,164
I mean, sure,
your kids are gonna be smart,

132
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,209
But mine had a shot
at being really beautiful.

133
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:02,078
Well, hopefully,
Gibbs will bring us some good news.

134
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,549
That doesn't look like good news.

135
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:08,580
I was so worried!

136
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,730
I hitched a ride with the emergency team
when I heard.

137
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:18,789
- You guys okay?
- You tell us.

138
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:20,105
Yeah, you're okay.

139
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:23,283
They only found minute traces
of radiation on the car.

140
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:25,280
You guys could even get
your clothes back.

141
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:26,694
Nice work, McPanic.

142
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,378
What was the source
of the radiation?

143
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:30,587
Good news is
that it wasn't from the explosion.

144
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:34,245
But the vehicle... it had been used
to transport something called cobalt-60.

145
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:36,413
It's a byproduct
of nuclear reactors.

146
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:39,375
It's used for, like,
industrial mining and X-ray machines.

147
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:41,252
Dirty bombs.

148
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:44,500
And why was Lance Corporal Vega
transporting radioactive material?

149
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,888
If it can be used to make a dirty bomb,
the more pressing question is,

150
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:49,343
where is it now?

151
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:57,601
All the information regarding
international travel...

152
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,478
And nobody talks to the press.

153
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,188
And do not talk to the press!

154
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:03,023
<i>This just in.</i>

155
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,093
I think
it's a little too late for that.

156
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:07,775
<i>... that a radiological dispersal
device commonly known as...</i>

157
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:10,982
Dirty bomb loose in DC? We don't even
know there is a dirty bomb.

158
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,048
Nope, but it's good for ratings.

159
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:15,310
Corporal Vega...
Gibbs is gonna want a full briefing

160
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,479
when he gets done talking to Vance.
What do we got?

161
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:21,083
Well, we did a preliminary workup while
you were showering for the third time.

162
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:23,742
Lance Corporal Roman Vega.

163
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,590
- Born in Lima, Peru, 1981.
- He and his younger brother, Alfonso,

164
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,297
went to live with their aunt in Maryland
after their parents were killed.

165
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:33,666
Cell records show that Roman called
to his brother During the police chase.

166
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:35,890
- Let's bring him in.
- No one knows where he is.

167
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:37,332
Well, then find him!

168
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,911
- Kind of busy, Leon.
- You're gonna want to hear this.

169
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:42,388
Special Agent Gibbs,
meet Walter Kane.

170
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,233
I'm glad to finally meet you, Gunny.
Been following you for some time.

171
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:49,562
Yeah? Really?
What, on my blog?

172
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,268
Not exactly,
but I do my own research.

173
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:54,241
I knew
we'd be meeting up eventually.

174
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:55,576
How's that?

175
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,037
Lance Corporal Roman Vega.

176
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,629
Mr. Kane runs
a private intelligence firm.

177
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:03,083
- They do work for the Pentagon.
- Between Iraq and Afghanistan,

178
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,836
our country's own intel services
are stretched thin, so...

179
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:07,922
We outsource firms like Mr. Kane's

180
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:10,007
for countries
that we're not at war with.

181
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:12,186
- Like Peru.
- Good guess.

182
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:14,124
We handle it exclusively.

183
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,497
Currently, we're tracking
a group out of Lima

184
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:19,166
called <i>Libertad Nueva</i>. Means...

185
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:20,768
New liberty?

186
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:23,556
They claim to be
a grassroots organization,

187
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:26,719
formed to protest
US anti-drug policies in Peru.

188
00:09:27,012 --> 00:09:29,485
Which they say have caused
civilian casualties.

189
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:31,022
It's a lie.

190
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:33,614
They're not freedom fighters.
They're drug dealers

191
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,827
who just want the US out of their hair.
We think they're planning an attack,

192
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,832
hoping to weaken our resolve.

193
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:40,704
What do you got on Vega?

194
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:44,195
Well, he's been seen
with suspected <i>LN</i> members in Lima.

195
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:47,962
And for a man with no family in Peru,
he travels there quite a bit.

196
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,211
That's it?

197
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,796
That and the fact
that his car glows in the dark.

198
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,165
I don't deny our intelligence linking
Vega to these terrorists is slim.

199
00:09:56,249 --> 00:09:59,306
We're victims of budget cuts
like everyone else, but we're sure

200
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,645
there's a cell here.

201
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:03,060
And Vega was our only link to them.

202
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,853
Thank you.
We'll take it from here.

203
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,405
Thank you, sir.

204
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:12,903
I have to testify before the Senate.

205
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:15,531
An upcoming defense contractor bill.

206
00:10:15,964 --> 00:10:18,024
Reason we don't have money
for real intelligence is

207
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:21,525
the boys on the Hill love to spend money
on toys that we don't really need.

208
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:23,653
Yeah. Gibbs.

209
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:25,608
<i>Vega just checked his e-mail.
Belmont hotel.</i>

210
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,792
I'll be right down.

211
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,414
Got a lead on Roman's brother.

212
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:31,046
He just logged on
to his e-mail account.

213
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,360
Belmont hotel.

214
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:36,076
Hotel manager said Vega came
into the lobby two hours ago,

215
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,978
- Used the guest computer...
- Then checked into room 102.

216
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:40,900
People have been coming
and going ever since.

217
00:10:40,984 --> 00:10:42,114
What kind?

218
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:44,825
He said the kind of people
he wouldn't want to mess with.

219
00:10:46,032 --> 00:10:47,378
- We knocking?
- No!

220
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,775
Would you like the honors?

221
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,710
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

222
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:00,730
NCIS! Federal agents!

223
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,906
- What the...?
- Put them down!

224
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,498
- You put them down! Federal agents.
- Don't see any I.D.

225
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:10,210
That won't be necessary.
Put your weapons down.

226
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,064
Hello, Mr. Gibbs.

227
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,215
You know each other?

228
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:18,635
He's my client.

229
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,346
Your "client"?

230
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,555
That's right.

231
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:23,525
Since when, Alfonso?

232
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:24,727
Don't answer that.

233
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,769
This is going to get ugly.

234
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,828
- I hope so.
- Go on. Get out of here.

235
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,276
- Will you turn that thing off?
- Give us a minute.

236
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,697
Don't worry, it'll be okay. Come on.

237
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:47,803
- Have you seen the news lately?
- I have.

238
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,833
- We don't have time for this.
- For what? The rule of law?

239
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,587
I don't have a problem with the law.

240
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:59,529
Roman Vega was a new client of mine.
He contacted me a few weeks ago.

241
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:00,427
About?

242
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,846
Sorry, attorney-client privilege.

243
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:06,456
After Mr. Vega was killed,
his brother called me.

244
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,740
He was scared.

245
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,079
He wanted to talk.

246
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,730
Don't bother asking me about...
What?

247
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:19,298
As a precaution,

248
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:21,824
I told him to meet me here,
and I arranged for private security.

249
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:23,430
Colonel Bell's men?

250
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:26,940
Colonel Bell owed me a favor

251
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:30,249
after I rescued him from that Mexican
hellhole you sent him to.

252
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,729
Not me, the rule of law.

253
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,963
Which also says I have
the right to talk to Alfonso.

254
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:37,730
Yes, it does.

255
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:39,982
And you're more than welcome,

256
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:42,803
as long as I'm in the room.

257
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:59,862
- Did I miss it?
- Nope, just starting.

258
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:01,544
Where's Ziva?

259
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:04,074
Bringing the popcorn.

260
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,354
Mr. Gibbs
is trying to make you nervous.

261
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,751
Don't let him.

262
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:18,128
Special Agent.

263
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:19,548
Excuse me?

264
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:21,381
Special Agent Gibbs.

265
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,972
And I'm not trying to make you nervous.
I just need answers.

266
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:30,559
And I think you want answers, too,
considering your brother is dead.

267
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:32,806
Now he's trying to piss you off.

268
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:35,105
Just ask the questions.

269
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:39,932
You talked to your brother, right,
before the explosion?

270
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:41,979
Yeah.

271
00:13:42,577 --> 00:13:43,661
What did he say?

272
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:46,950
He told me to run.

273
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:49,682
- Why?
- Don't answer that.

274
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,165
Did he tell you why he was
transporting radioactive material?

275
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,457
Don't answer that.

276
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,557
Did you know that he was
a member of <i>Libertad Nueva</i>?

277
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:02,961
Looks like you didn't.

278
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:05,085
Nicely done.

279
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:08,138
Ziva better hurry,
or she is going to miss it.

280
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:10,952
Would you like to confer
with your client? Because

281
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:13,097
I think he knows something
you don't know.

282
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,687
- Roman didn't do anything wrong.
- We need a moment alone.

283
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,855
Yes! He's fishing,
And that's dangerous.

284
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:21,594
Mr. Gibbs has put plenty
of guilty men behind bars, but

285
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:24,613
- he's also put some innocent ones away.
- What's <i>Libertad Nueva</i>?

286
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:26,999
They're drug dealers, terrorists.

287
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,868
Roman would never be involved in.

288
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:33,121
- But he was involved with something.
- Don't answer that.

289
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,124
I want answers, too.

290
00:14:39,396 --> 00:14:41,838
Don't know what he was messed up in,
but whatever it was...

291
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,633
had him really freaked out.

292
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:48,264
He wouldn't give me
any details, but...

293
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,264
He wanted you to do something.

294
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:55,561
I work for a cell phone company.

295
00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:58,110
He asked me to...

296
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:01,149
back-trace some calls to a warehouse

297
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:02,818
in Virginia.

298
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:07,155
He wouldn't tell me why.
He just told me not to trust anybody.

299
00:15:09,914 --> 00:15:12,119
I hope I'm not making
a mistake trusting you.

300
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:24,996
- Think he's telling the truth?
- He's telling a story, not sure whose.

301
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:28,998
The popcorn!
I burnt the first batch, but...

302
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,594
DiNozzo,

303
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:35,995
take Ziva and check out
that warehouse.

304
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,922
Taking Ziva.
Checking out the warehouse.

305
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:42,309
Well, I'm sure
you're feeling pretty satisfied.

306
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:48,231
I am going to go

307
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,127
get a haircut.

308
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:58,582
I'm feeling pretty satisfied.

309
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:59,658
Good.

310
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:02,293
Then you can release my client.

311
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:03,369
I can.

312
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,632
You have no right to hold him.
You haven't charged him with anything.

313
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:09,760
Terrorism. Don't need to.

314
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:13,721
Spoken like a third world dictator.

315
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,589
I don't make the rules. He's telling
the truth, he's better off here.

316
00:16:16,673 --> 00:16:18,528
How noble of you.
Fine!

317
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,604
Then if he's staying,

318
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,313
I'm staying.

319
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,219
Fine.

320
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,901
Just past the door
to the vending machines.

321
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:30,763
Gun battle?

322
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:33,617
Hand-to-hand?

323
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,161
Knife fight?

324
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:37,816
Right?

325
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,043
Something about our friendly
neighborhood counselor

326
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:43,001
makes you think
she might be good with a blade.

327
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,148
Well, she is tenacious.

328
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:50,378
And training is important in a knife
fight, but not as important as spirit.

329
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:56,210
What is that?

330
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,279
It's a Geiger counter.

331
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,837
Can't be too careful.

332
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:05,440
What do you think Corporal Vega
was doing at an empty warehouse?

333
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,854
I don't know. Why don't you pick
the lock and find out?

334
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:10,862
We do not have a warrant.

335
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,437
This building is foreclosed,
which means it's owned by the banks,

336
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:16,615
and since the people own the banks,
I think technically we own the building.

337
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:23,125
Lock picked.

338
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:26,928
I do not think our friendly neighborhood
counselor would approve.

339
00:17:28,738 --> 00:17:30,657
Let her spend
a night working a homicide.

340
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:32,864
Tell ya...

341
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:34,826
Things aren't so black and white

342
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,439
when the walls are all splattered
with red, are they?

343
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:39,849
Or when your way
of life is threatened.

344
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:41,027
Exactly.

345
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:44,896
Wait a second. Are you mocking me?

346
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:47,020
No, Tony. I was not mocking you.

347
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,583
It's just that...

348
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,735
when I was held hostage in Somalia,
Saleem used

349
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:55,271
similar justifications
for his actions.

350
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:56,980
Saleem...

351
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:01,121
Caf-Pow!-Swilling sociopath
was a terrorist, Ziva.

352
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:04,532
I'm sure he would say
he was just protecting his way of life.

353
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:07,418
You're not seriously defending him,
are you?

354
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,463
No, Tony.
His actions were indefensible,

355
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,724
Regardless of his reasons.

356
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:13,924
And that is my point.

357
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:17,458
This country holds itself
to a higher standard.

358
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,878
It is a nation of laws,
which are to be followed

359
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:21,975
not only
when it is convenient or easy.

360
00:18:23,738 --> 00:18:25,819
I have seen firsthand what happens

361
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:28,297
when convenience

362
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:29,988
wins out.

363
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,671
You never talk about it.

364
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,846
What is there to talk about?

365
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:43,952
Come on, Ziva.

366
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:50,252
What Saleem did was bad enough.

367
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,085
Becoming like him

368
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:55,102
would be worse.

369
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,765
The food is fresh.

370
00:19:01,993 --> 00:19:03,767
Whoever was here left in a hurry.

371
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:07,604
They had a little bonfire
before they split.

372
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:10,899
Acetone hydroxide.

373
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:13,568
Lots of wires.

374
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:16,245
A couple of timers.

375
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:19,378
They were building a bomb.

376
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,404
It's definitely the dirty kind.

377
00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:26,000
I found traces of cobalt-60
on all of the evidence

378
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:27,604
that Tony and Ziva brought in.

379
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:29,501
Is it safe?

380
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,593
Yeah, totally.

381
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,341
This was just way too cool to take off.
I like the sound it makes when I move.

382
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,983
So did Tony and Ziva get any prints?

383
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:41,471
Hundreds.

384
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,099
But judging
by the decomposition of skin oil,

385
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:47,096
I'm thinking that they belong
to the building's old occupants.

386
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,980
- I'm running them now.
- Any idea how big a bomb could be out?

387
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:52,666
It looks like they mixed
enough acetone hydroxide

388
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,026
to blow up Roman Vega's car,
like, five times over.

389
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:57,352
So most of it is still out there.

390
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,748
Tony and Ziva
also found an old laptop.

391
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,366
It's burnt to a crisp,

392
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,869
but I still think
I can get something off the hard drive.

393
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,454
All right, let me know.
I've got to report back to Gibbs.

394
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,674
Wait, wait, wait!

395
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:15,144
- What?
- I can't believe this.

396
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:17,249
I had my whole presentation
timed out perfectly.

397
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,036
So when I said, "I can still pull
something off the hard drive",

398
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,108
my decryption algorithm
was supposed to...

399
00:20:24,504 --> 00:20:25,682
Better late than never.

400
00:20:27,736 --> 00:20:29,978
Okay, so, there's only
two things on the laptop:

401
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:33,156
An encrypted video file
and solitaire.

402
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:35,634
I guess terrorists get bored, too.

403
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,402
Here's the file.

404
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,248
<i>Hola, Mis hermanos.</i>

405
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,034
<i>Get the package in position.</i>

406
00:20:43,707 --> 00:20:45,471
<i>Wait for my order to detonate.</i>

407
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:47,041
<i>I repeat:</i>

408
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,759
<i>Do not detonate
until you hear from me.</i>

409
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,003
<i>Buena suerte.</i>

410
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,623
I'm guessing by "package",
he means "bomb".

411
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,818
Look at the bright side.
If there's a bomb out there,

412
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:01,717
with Corporal Vega dead,
we've bought some time.

413
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:04,152
I'm afraid not as much
as you might think.

414
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:05,167
Here.

415
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,224
I need to talk to Gibbs.

416
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,636
The cause of death
was as we expected.

417
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,849
Multiple traumas caused by the...

418
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,413
Sorry...

419
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:24,619
Agent DiNozzo
actually invited me to...

420
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:28,536
It's not important.
Won't happen again.

421
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:30,173
Yes, well...

422
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,856
Dismemberment was
the cause of death.

423
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,752
I found a wound that,

424
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,379
predates the blast.

425
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:40,186
- It's a cigarette lighter?
- Yeah.

426
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:41,896
It's the one from the car

427
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,137
and the angle suggests
that it was not self-inflicted.

428
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,652
He wasn't in the car alone, then?

429
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:49,711
Well, whoever was there with him

430
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:53,451
apparently got out of the car
at some point during the police chase.

431
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,814
But that's not
why I called you down here.

432
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,900
Mr. Palmer,
I just sent some DNA up to Abby

433
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,740
for positive identification,

434
00:22:00,824 --> 00:22:01,975
but before that,

435
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:05,566
we made a dental impression of the most
perfect set of teeth I've ever seen.

436
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,900
Not a single cavity.
No rotations.

437
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,944
Had all of his wisdom teeth.

438
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:13,034
Something Corporal Vega
did not have.

439
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:17,627
This isn't Vega.

440
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,631
Yeah, the Corporal is alive

441
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:23,533
to give whatever orders
he wishes, whenever he wishes.

442
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,258
This isn't Corporal Vega?

443
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:36,271
Then who is it?

444
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:37,636
His name's John Cook.

445
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:41,418
Former Sergeant.
Served briefly in the second Gulf War

446
00:22:41,502 --> 00:22:43,608
before being dishonorably
discharged for looting.

447
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:46,365
Ducky finally found intact DNA.

448
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,324
- Victim or involved?
- Involved.

449
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,827
Abby lifted his prints off of one
of the bomb timers

450
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,507
Tony and Ziva found
in the warehouse.

451
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,290
So Cook makes the bombs,
and Vega gives the when and where.

452
00:22:55,723 --> 00:22:57,620
So, when and where?

453
00:22:58,491 --> 00:22:59,667
We're working on it.

454
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,027
Unfortunately,
Cook was our best link to Vega.

455
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,013
We've been doing deep background,
going through credit card statements.

456
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:08,553
So far, nothing unusual shows up.

457
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:10,652
Back it up.

458
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:14,589
Dr. Mallard's report said
Cook had perfect teeth, right?

459
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,562
- That's right.
- These right here.

460
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,234
Then why was he going
to a new dentist every two days?

461
00:23:24,273 --> 00:23:26,529
That does qualify as unusual.
I'm gonna go find out.

462
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:28,484
I have to brief the Joint Chiefs.

463
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:31,604
You have any idea how Vega plans
to relay the detonation orders?

464
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,953
- Take your choice.
- Then we prepare for the worst.

465
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,111
I've been told that the risk
of radiation exposure

466
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:38,041
from a dirty bomb
is fairly negligible.

467
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,673
Most of the injuries will be
from the explosion itself.

468
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,828
But the real threat to the city
is panic.

469
00:23:44,277 --> 00:23:47,183
That's why they call the dirty
bombs weapons of mass disruption.

470
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:49,718
When people get scared,
it gets deadly.

471
00:23:50,817 --> 00:23:53,640
- Well, they are scared, Leon.
- I've been having second thoughts

472
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:56,476
about my testimony
against the defense contractor bill.

473
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:57,949
Seemed like overkill.

474
00:23:58,491 --> 00:23:59,510
Yesterday.

475
00:24:04,263 --> 00:24:06,653
Oh, yes, I remember him.
A walk-in.

476
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,520
Showed up, wanted his teeth cleaned.
Then he left.

477
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,200
Did you notice anything unusual?

478
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:15,371
Only that he had about the most
perfect teeth I'd ever seen.

479
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,655
We heard from the last
two dentists we visited.

480
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,695
Yeah. Well, working on him was...

481
00:24:22,248 --> 00:24:23,461
almost orgasmic.

482
00:24:23,793 --> 00:24:25,580
Didn't really need to hear that.

483
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,549
His retromolar pad was shaped just

484
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,302
like a renaissance bosom.

485
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:33,721
We're gonna go. Thank you.

486
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:36,099
You think he had something
to do with the robbery?

487
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:37,557
Robbery?

488
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:39,519
Isn't that why you're here?

489
00:24:39,642 --> 00:24:40,854
Couple days later,

490
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,180
someone broke in.

491
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:44,260
Thieves cleaned out
all our X-ray machines.

492
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:46,926
How many exactly?

493
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:49,772
Well, in the entire practice...

494
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:51,113
15.

495
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:53,616
And these weren't those cheap

496
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:57,579
tube machines. These were
top-of-the-line cobalt-based units.

497
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,618
<i>Excuse me, Dr. Shore,
you're needed in room 1.</i>

498
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:03,620
Yes, I'm on my way.
Thank you.

499
00:25:05,385 --> 00:25:07,297
I have a patient waiting.
Is that all?

500
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:09,792
- No, that's all for now. Thanks.
- Thank you.

501
00:25:12,957 --> 00:25:15,190
Well, that explains
the credit card charges.

502
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:18,266
Cook was casing dentists' offices,
looking for radioactive material.

503
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:20,393
At the dentist?

504
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,052
It's the dirty secret
about dirty bombs.

505
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:24,486
Sources are everywhere.

506
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,233
Oil platforms, medical equipment.
There's too many to keep track of.

507
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:31,321
Is the cobalt of 15 machines
enough to make a dirty bomb?

508
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:34,165
Once the material's powderized,
it's enough to make five.

509
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:36,826
Five.

510
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:39,120
Fantastic.

511
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:40,788
You tell Gibbs.

512
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,374
Okay, well, get back here.
There's computery stuff for you to do.

513
00:25:45,373 --> 00:25:46,730
Tell Gibbs about what?

514
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,215
Still here, how nice.

515
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:53,009
I told you I'm not leaving
until my client is released.

516
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:55,470
We could always have
security escort you out.

517
00:25:57,816 --> 00:25:58,806
I was just

518
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,307
playing with words,
putting them together in random order.

519
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:03,144
Now that is Gibbs' desk.

520
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,014
Where is

521
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:08,575
Mr. Gibbs?

522
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,133
He hasn't left MTAC all day.

523
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,922
- I hope it's not because of me.
- It's probably more to do

524
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,365
with the impending terrorist attack
your client is planning.

525
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,669
Allegedly planning.

526
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,068
And I was as surprised
as you were that he was still alive.

527
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:24,738
Tell me something.

528
00:26:25,412 --> 00:26:27,021
Who cuts Mr. Gibbs' hair?

529
00:26:27,357 --> 00:26:28,461
Excuse me?

530
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:30,922
I think you can tell
a lot about a man by

531
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,115
who cuts his hair.

532
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,758
Who cuts your hair?

533
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:36,578
My sister.

534
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:38,685
She has for years.

535
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,480
I imagine

536
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,637
you spend more on your hair

537
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:45,353
than it'd cost to feed
a third world family for a year.

538
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:49,440
How much does that cost?

539
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:51,718
And Mr. Gibbs...

540
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:55,240
well, I see him getting his hair cut
at the same mom-and-pop shop

541
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:56,780
he's been going to for years.

542
00:26:57,213 --> 00:26:58,332
Get out of my chair.

543
00:27:00,155 --> 00:27:01,201
You talk to McGee?

544
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,276
Five.

545
00:27:07,948 --> 00:27:09,002
What's the plan?

546
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,327
I would be... happy to leave...

547
00:27:17,661 --> 00:27:19,179
as soon as you release my client.

548
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,520
Like I said before,
he's better off here.

549
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,893
Is that how you justify denying him
his right of habeas corpus?

550
00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:30,002
- Is that what I'm doing?
- You know what I can justify?

551
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:35,194
Filing suit against NCIS

552
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,738
and you personally

553
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,381
for violating
over ten Federal and State

554
00:27:39,465 --> 00:27:41,409
constitutional protections.

555
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,079
Calling security, yeah.

556
00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:46,331
Let him go.

557
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:50,077
Let him go?

558
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,850
You heard him.

559
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:54,183
Release my client.

560
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:57,868
Releasing the client.

561
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:04,519
I have a visual on the target.

562
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:07,085
He's being cautious.

563
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:11,206
This is the third place he stopped after
his lawyer dropped him off at home.

564
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:15,026
But the first time
he has sent his taxi away.

565
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,986
Why do I get
a funny feeling Gibbs planned

566
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,095
on using this guy
as bait from the beginning?

567
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:21,324
Because he is Gibbs.

568
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:26,814
I sure hope I'm not around

569
00:28:26,898 --> 00:28:29,113
when Miss Hart finds out
he used her client as bait.

570
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,350
Or maybe I do.

571
00:28:32,646 --> 00:28:35,380
<i>This is all assuming the brothers
had a prearranged meeting place.</i>

572
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:37,366
He's here.

573
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:39,214
<i>Yes, we should think positive.</i>

574
00:28:40,071 --> 00:28:41,344
No. I mean, he's here.

575
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,822
Right in front of me,
coming out the door.

576
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,360
All right, let's take him.

577
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,268
I screwed up, it's my fault.
All right...

578
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,271
NCIS. Freeze!

579
00:28:53,437 --> 00:28:55,274
He said freeze!

580
00:28:56,223 --> 00:28:57,583
You're making a mistake.

581
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,354
Really? Good.

582
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,815
I know someplace quaint we can talk.

583
00:29:14,979 --> 00:29:16,879
I told your agents

584
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,547
I want to talk to my lawyer.

585
00:29:20,686 --> 00:29:21,749
She's on her way.

586
00:29:23,002 --> 00:29:24,859
So, you can't ask me any questions.

587
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:27,824
That is right.

588
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,913
You know you got the wrong guy.

589
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,193
I am not a terrorist.

590
00:29:41,773 --> 00:29:43,160
<i>Hola, Mis Hermanos.</i>

591
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:45,784
<i>Get the package in position.</i>

592
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,910
<i>Wait for my order to detonate.</i>

593
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,768
- I can explain that.
- I can't wait.

594
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:04,135
All right, screw the lawyer. I...

595
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,327
What is that?

596
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:15,125
An attorney waiver.

597
00:30:24,565 --> 00:30:26,407
What is the matter with you,
Marine?!

598
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:28,242
- I'm being set up.
- By who?

599
00:30:29,713 --> 00:30:30,995
I don't know his name.

600
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,748
He said he worked
for the Department of Defense.

601
00:30:34,703 --> 00:30:36,959
Said they needed
native Spanish speakers to perform

602
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:39,892
- in a top secret training video.
- That him?

603
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:43,602
- That's him.
- Well, he does not work for the DOD.

604
00:30:43,686 --> 00:30:45,180
He had all the credentials.

605
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,888
He took me to this building.
It was set up to look like

606
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,071
a terrorist hideout.

607
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:51,474
I recorded...

608
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:53,497
all kinds of messages for the video.

609
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:56,098
BioTerror, dirty bomb attacks.

610
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:58,721
Hell, I even did
a militia insurrection.

611
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:00,388
- It was all fake.
- Not all.

612
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,262
- It was supposed to be.
- It wasn't!

613
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,034
A few days later,
I noticed I was followed.

614
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:12,203
So, I got suspicious,

615
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:14,789
and I started asking around
about the training program.

616
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:16,957
No one had heard about it.

617
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,606
I knew I was in trouble.

618
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,789
And you go hire a lawyer
instead of going to your superior?

619
00:31:23,873 --> 00:31:27,159
Look, I didn't know who to trust.
I read an article about this woman.

620
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,225
Heard that she helps people like me.
We played phone tag for a while,

621
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,654
and before we could talk,
my recruiter shows up,

622
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:35,768
and he sticks a gun in my back,
and he says, "drive".

623
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:37,524
Luckily, I saw a cop.

624
00:31:37,822 --> 00:31:39,537
I blew a stop sign to get attention.

625
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:41,260
I bailed in an alley
during the chase.

626
00:31:41,344 --> 00:31:43,634
My recruiter had no choice
but to keep on going.

627
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:47,029
I called my brother, And then,
I heard the explosion right after.

628
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:50,815
And then what, you just play dead
until you figure out what else to do?

629
00:31:51,313 --> 00:31:52,492
Do you believe me?

630
00:31:57,532 --> 00:31:58,681
Well, you'd better,

631
00:31:59,332 --> 00:32:01,418
because whatever terrorist attack
they're planning,

632
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:03,673
I don't know a thing about it.

633
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:17,204
Yeah, well, the cell records do confirm
the game of phone tag with the lawyer,

634
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:18,243
and,

635
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:21,354
we found traces of blood on the street
where Vega said he leapt from the car.

636
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,440
His blood?

637
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,483
Down to the last chromosome.

638
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,006
What about the trips to Peru?

639
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:33,363
Looks like pleasure, not business.

640
00:32:34,046 --> 00:32:35,401
Her name is...

641
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:39,393
Gloria Garcia Ramirez
De Arroyo Fuentes.

642
00:32:39,688 --> 00:32:41,249
She's a nurse in Lima.

643
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,848
There's no way he's our guy.

644
00:32:42,932 --> 00:32:46,297
Not a suicide bomber in the world
who'd have a girlfriend looks like that.

645
00:32:48,315 --> 00:32:50,635
Unless, you know,
your gut says otherwise.

646
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:52,714
He said he was set up.

647
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:56,630
<i>Libertad Nueva</i> needed a fall guy.

648
00:32:57,722 --> 00:32:59,852
And Corporal Vega fit the profile.

649
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:03,080
Well, I guess we can assume
the upcoming attack's real.

650
00:33:03,578 --> 00:33:05,812
It's too bad we lost
our number one suspect.

651
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,852
But we do have a number two:
the dentist.

652
00:33:07,936 --> 00:33:09,528
I sent a forensic team to his place.

653
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,739
Assistant said he left for lunch
after our visit, never returned.

654
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,659
- Get a Bolo.
- Already out.

655
00:33:14,858 --> 00:33:16,798
That's not why I came down here.

656
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:18,537
You have to see this.

657
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,004
<i>Received verification
from several sources,</i>

658
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:22,750
<i>and now ZNN can confirm</i>

659
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,961
<i>the message was e-mailed
to our Washington bureau chief.</i>

660
00:33:26,488 --> 00:33:28,255
<i>It warns that, unless the US agrees</i>

00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,587
<i>to halt its anti-drug
operations in Peru,</i>

662
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:32,240
Libertad Nueva<i> is going to blow</i>

663
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:34,668
<i>one dirty bomb per day
in the DC metro area,</i>

664
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,452
<i>starting in one hour.</i>

665
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:38,760
<i>Homeland security is
advising people to stay home.</i>

666
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:40,893
<i>Panic is
the greater threat at this time.</i>

667
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,673
I need a copy of that e-mail now.

668
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:43,917
- On it.
- DiNozzo...

669
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:47,022
- You need to talk to metro PD Chief.
- McGee, find the dentist.

670
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:49,705
- Already on it.
- Gibbs, tell me you got something.

671
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:52,363
The Joint Chiefs want a sit-rep now.
What can I give 'em?

672
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,406
Not Vega.

673
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,358
I heard. What can I give you?

674
00:33:55,442 --> 00:33:57,497
- Lawyer.
- Already banned her from the building,

675
00:33:57,581 --> 00:33:59,310
but she's the least of our concerns.

676
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:02,485
We've already had two traffic fatalities
in the rush to get out of the city.

677
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:05,792
- Do you have any leads on the target?
- Boss, I think I got something here.

678
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:07,412
Our dentist may be MIA,

679
00:34:07,496 --> 00:34:10,464
But there's activity on a site
he belongs to called "oralhappiness.com"

680
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,016
a social networking site
for oral care providers.

681
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,988
Anyway, uploaded photos
of a bus station off G street.

682
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:20,640
Either this guy has
a serious greyhound fetish...

683
00:34:20,777 --> 00:34:22,253
Anybody else looking at these?

684
00:34:22,337 --> 00:34:24,393
Well, the photos
were recently viewed.

685
00:34:24,477 --> 00:34:26,954
From behind a firewall,
but the IP address is out of Peru.

686
00:34:27,038 --> 00:34:29,400
It must be how they're relaying
information on the target.

687
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,984
Let's go. We're moving.

688
00:34:38,385 --> 00:34:40,828
- Bomb squad's on their way.
- They're not going to make it.

689
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,970
DiNozzo, Ziva,
coordinate with local LEOs.

690
00:34:43,054 --> 00:34:45,273
Evacuate the building,
but nobody leaves!

691
00:34:45,674 --> 00:34:47,049
All right, Gibbs.

692
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:50,429
Radiation sensors. They'll only work
if the bomb

693
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:52,364
is unshielded,
but it's better than nothing.

694
00:34:52,781 --> 00:34:54,216
Come on, you're with me!

695
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,456
- Where are we going?
- To find the bomb!

696
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,024
Don't make me say it, McGee.

697
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:01,628
We'll be careful, Tony.

698
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,316
Hey, how much time?

699
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:14,343
- Less than five.
- What are we looking for?

700
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,489
In a inside setting like this,
something small.

701
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:19,687
How small?

702
00:35:19,771 --> 00:35:21,638
Briefcase, maybe smaller.

703
00:35:23,376 --> 00:35:26,108
It's somewhere over here,
but something is blocking the sensor.

704
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,628
<i>Evacuate mission is complete.
You want us to hold our position?</i>

705
00:35:31,315 --> 00:35:32,922
Yeah, you stay outside.

706
00:35:34,947 --> 00:35:37,258
Gives a whole new spin
to "dirty bomb".

707
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,190
Lead-lined.

708
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,235
- That's why it was blocking our sensor.
- You recognize the design?

709
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,362
Not really, I mean,
I know the good old black

710
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,988
and red wires probably
supplies the power.

711
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,200
We're going to have to do
better than a probably.

712
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:04,078
- We definitely have time to run.
- Then run.

713
00:36:04,364 --> 00:36:06,579
The building's been evacuated.
We just let it blow.

714
00:36:06,673 --> 00:36:07,673
Go. Leave.

715
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:11,641
Boss, the, the threat
of contamination is minimal.

716
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,880
Go! That's an order. Now, leave.

717
00:36:15,821 --> 00:36:17,258
It's an order I'm disobeying.

718
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,597
OK, if it's a tamper-resistant circuit,
we're dead,

719
00:36:24,672 --> 00:36:26,183
but I'd say cut the black...

720
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,651
I was going to say black, but...

721
00:36:36,206 --> 00:36:37,486
I guess red works.

722
00:36:40,243 --> 00:36:41,864
Actually, no, it didn't.

723
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,368
McGee was right.

724
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,710
There's a tamper-resistant circuit.

725
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:50,708
As soon as you cut any of the wires,
the bomb should have detonated.

726
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:52,912
I'm still here, Abs.

727
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:55,296
The explosive was mixed incorrectly.

728
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,218
The first batch was made too unstable,
so it blew up Roman Vega's trunk.

729
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,719
I don't know,
I guess they overcompensated

730
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,989
for the second batch,
made it too lean.

731
00:37:05,149 --> 00:37:08,103
These terrorists, they get
an "A" for terrorizing,

732
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:10,477
but, gratefully,
an "F" in chemistry.

733
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:12,484
Been over the security tapes, Boss.

734
00:37:12,568 --> 00:37:15,383
Whoever planted the bomb
knew to avoid the cameras.

735
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:17,464
I vote for the dentist.

736
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:20,760
Ever since <i>Marathon Man</i>,
I always vote for the dentist.

737
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,838
If it was him, that'll be the last bomb
he was planting.

738
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:26,145
Look at this, Boss.
Bolo came back.

739
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,913
Metro PD found his body
under the McGregor Bridge.

740
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,373
They're calling it a suicide.

741
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:33,461
Yep, left a note.

742
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:34,995
Took credit for everything.

743
00:37:35,437 --> 00:37:37,878
Did he now?
Guy disappears suspiciously.

744
00:37:37,962 --> 00:37:40,841
Then plants a bomb for a terrorist group
he has no connection to.

745
00:37:41,347 --> 00:37:42,787
Yeah, and then kills himself.

746
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,613
I usually like things
all nice and tidy.

747
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:45,813
It does not add up.

748
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:49,271
<i>Libertad Nueva</i> has been
very careful up until now.

749
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:53,062
Vega was their original fall guy.
Maybe they're improvising now.

750
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:56,523
<i>Despite calls for calm
from several government agencies,</i>

751
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:58,108
<i>panic has engulfed the city.</i>

752
00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:00,238
What about the other four bombs?

753
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:06,108
If you're wrong, we're putting
a lot of lives in jeopardy.

754
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,117
I'm not.

755
00:38:07,637 --> 00:38:09,143
I got here as quick as I could.

756
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,227
Thank you.

757
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,836
As our resident
<i>Libertad Nueva</i> expert,

758
00:38:18,043 --> 00:38:21,374
I wanted to get your take on something
before I went to the Joint Chiefs.

759
00:38:22,472 --> 00:38:25,001
The next bomb is set
to go off in 12 hours.

760
00:38:25,654 --> 00:38:28,381
To prepare, Agent Gibbs thinks
that we should do nothing.

761
00:38:30,497 --> 00:38:31,350
Nothing?

762
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,811
Not gonna be another bomb.

763
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:35,688
Yeah, he says it's all for show.

764
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,649
<i>LN</i> isn't given to making idle threats.
What's the endgame?

765
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,821
The Senate is set to vote
on a new defense bill tonight.

766
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:46,351
It's a terrible bill,
it was never going to pass.

767
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:50,035
Gave away billions in pork
to defense contractors.

768
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:52,906
But now, after the attacks,

769
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,832
looks like it might go through.

770
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,565
What, you think <i>Libertad Nueva</i>
is trying to influence the Senate vote?

771
00:38:58,649 --> 00:38:59,882
No, you are.

772
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:04,675
Did some checking. Your company stands
to make 10 of millions of dollars

773
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,218
if that bill should pass.

774
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,971
The funny thing
about all the intel we got

775
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,429
on <i>Libertad Nueva</i>,

776
00:39:12,168 --> 00:39:13,600
it comes from your company.

777
00:39:13,815 --> 00:39:16,603
All we could
verify independently of the group

778
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,325
was a kid with a web site.

779
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:19,949
13-year-old kid.

780
00:39:20,743 --> 00:39:23,449
You know, it's not unheard of
for somebody in your position to...

781
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:25,988
amplify things
for their own personal gain.

782
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,522
People get scared,
they make bad decisions.

783
00:39:28,606 --> 00:39:29,956
You were counting on it.

784
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,618
You cooked the intelligence,

785
00:39:31,867 --> 00:39:33,688
you created a fake sleeper cell.

786
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,541
No senator would ever vote against
any defense bill at threat level red.

787
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,097
This is ridiculous.

788
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:40,475
Sit down.

789
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,807
Our people traced the IP address
that uploaded the bus station photos.

790
00:39:54,068 --> 00:39:55,872
Came from a computer in your office.

791
00:39:56,198 --> 00:39:58,562
You did your best to camouflage it.

792
00:39:59,211 --> 00:40:02,066
Well, I guess we just have
better nerds than you do.

793
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:07,592
You cop to it now,

794
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,774
right now,

795
00:40:09,695 --> 00:40:11,625
you let me get this city off alert,

796
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,953
I'll ask the Attorney General
to waive the death penalty.

797
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:18,955
You got ten seconds.

798
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,979
After that, you can start thinking
about which vein

799
00:40:22,063 --> 00:40:24,125
you want us to shut you off with.

800
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,037
Five seconds.

801
00:40:34,071 --> 00:40:35,730
I'll need to talk
to my lawyers first.

802
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:37,017
Yeah, I bet you do.

803
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:41,969
We finally traced the photos
from the bus station.

804
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:44,399
They came from a computer
in Kane's office.

805
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,655
You were bluffing.

806
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:54,152
Cuff him.

807
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:14,972
Am I the only one
who needs a warrant?

808
00:41:15,546 --> 00:41:16,621
Door was unlocked.

809
00:41:16,937 --> 00:41:18,517
Well, that's going to end soon.

810
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,066
How dare you use my client as bait!

811
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:25,200
Your client was lying to me.

812
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,401
He knew how to find his brother.

813
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:29,185
He was protecting his brother.

814
00:41:29,295 --> 00:41:31,738
Roman was innocent,
in case you didn't notice.

815
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,407
Then he didn't need protection.

816
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,635
Is that how it works?

817
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:38,619
You never put the wrong guy away?

818
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,372
And you've never helped
the wrong guy get away?

819
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:51,175
That's a very nice suit
you're wearing.

820
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,116
Roman Vega isn't going
to pay for that.

821
00:41:54,317 --> 00:41:56,434
It's scum like Colonel Bell that do.

822
00:41:56,809 --> 00:41:58,764
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

823
00:41:58,871 --> 00:42:01,018
Yeah, but you don't have
to be the one to do it.

824
00:42:01,414 --> 00:42:04,338
I guess with rates like yours,
you don't ask too many questions.

825
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,127
I do plenty of pro bono work.

826
00:42:06,672 --> 00:42:09,255
Yeah, you know what?
I checked into that. You get...

827
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:11,905
I don't know
maybe five requests a week,

828
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,709
but the only ones you seem to do

829
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,940
are the ones
that take you across my path.

830
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:19,828
Are you really that conceited?

831
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,413
You're standing in my house!

832
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,332
You didn't know anything
about Vega's case,

833
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,209
but you took him on
as a client anyway.

834
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,441
He needed help.

835
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:29,274
You knew that it was going
to land you...

836
00:42:30,445 --> 00:42:31,465
in front of me.

837
00:42:32,646 --> 00:42:33,993
Don't flatter yourself.

838
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:36,261
Yet here you are...

839
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,188
again.

840
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,932
I have my reasons.

841
00:42:41,537 --> 00:42:43,001
And I have a job to do.

842
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:48,211
And you keep getting in the way.
