<i>I am in love.</i>

3
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,301
Dude! That's the mailman.

4
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:16,639
Mailwoman.

5
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:17,878
All woman.

6
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:20,479
Are you going to shoot
something or just keep staring?

7
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,399
<i>- Come on, dude. Hurry up!
- Hold up.</i>

8
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:31,441
I'm coming!

9
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:38,462
<i>That's 95 pitches so far for Dryer...</i>

10
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:41,142
- You seeing this?
- My shot.

11
00:00:41,262 --> 00:00:42,262
<i>Okay.</i>

12
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:43,879
Come on.

13
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:49,362
<i>He steps in.</i>

14
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:51,515
<i>Dryer...</i>

15
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:54,022
<i>He makes the sign.
There's the windup...</i>

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,187
<i>and the pitch...</i>

17
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,711
<i>And there it is!
A shot up the middle!</i>

18
00:00:57,837 --> 00:01:01,220
<i>Singleterry puts one in
the gap to left center field!</i>

19
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:04,460
<i>One run's gonna score!
Two runs are gonna score!</i>

20
00:01:04,889 --> 00:01:08,889
<i>Singleterry flies in head first...
and he is safe!</i>

26
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:42,836
<i>I was proud to call Special
Agent Decker</i> my friend.

27
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:44,299
Even after his retirement,

28
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,935
I knew that he was never
more than a phone call away.

29
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:49,937
<i>My heart goes out to his family</i>

30
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:52,301
<i>and his beloved </i>girlfriend Sasha.

31
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:56,747
<i>I know that William loved her very much.</i>

32
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,343
- I'm sure he did.
- We're at a funeral, <i>and she's 22.</i>

33
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:02,536
- Yeah.
- Is that why we're here?

34
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,345
So you can google the girls?

35
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:07,232
"Ogle". And no,
we're here to accompany the Director.

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
I, for one,
am glad she's back from vacation.

37
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,328
Decker died of a heart attack,
not in the line of duty.

38
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,604
I hardly think her
presence is necessary.

<i>NCIS Code of Conduct,</i>

43
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:25,679
You're making this up.

44
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,189
Yes. But...

45
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:30,802
she always is accompanied by
two senior agents for security purposes.

46
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:32,708
And if it's not a rule,
it really should be.

47
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,545
<i>Sorry. What was that name again?</i>

48
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:37,090
Mr. Oshimaida.

49
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,002
<i>First name?</i>

50
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,935
<i>There are more than one?</i>

51
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:44,824
<i>No, sir, in fact,
there's nobody here by that name.</i>

52
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:45,912
Check again.

53
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:49,848
<i>Sorry, sir. I've checked the registry
twice. There is no Mr. Oshimaida.</i>

54
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:53,006
<i>But if you'd like to leave your name,
perhaps, I can...</i>

55
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:17,490
Director, are you ready to go?

56
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:19,298
No, actually, I'm not.

57
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,409
No rush. You know, we'll just hang out.

58
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:23,103
No need to wait for me. In fact,

59
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:25,584
we are not due
<i>to fly out until tomorrow.</i>

60
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:28,109
- So why don't the two of you...
- Yes, sure.

61
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:30,145
<i>... take the rest </i>of the trip off.

62
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:31,990
Right, sure.

63
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,049
<i>So you want us
to call you a taxi, or...?</i>

64
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:36,138
You want the car. Of course.

65
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,609
'Cause, we'll-we'll
figure something out.

66
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:40,899
Thanks.<i> All right, drive safe.</i>

67
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:42,725
That L.A. traffic's a little weird.

68
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,391
L.A. baby!

69
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:48,260
Sorry, Ziva.
I'm going to have to cut you loose.

70
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:50,476
Hey! <i>Wait up!</i>

71
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,536
- Good morning.
- McGee.

72
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:04,274
Timothy.

73
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:06,806
Haircut, McGee?

74
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,125
No.

75
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,188
I believe it was a suggestion,
not an observation.

76
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,698
Is something going on downstairs?

77
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:26,014
Is something wrong, McGee?

78
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:28,423
- Yeah, what are you guys...
- Doing upstairs?

79
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:29,768
<i>Random bug sweep.</i>

80
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:32,352
Off-limits
to all non-security personnel.

81
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:34,128
Didn't Jethro tell you?

82
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:37,754
Or perhaps his cranium
trauma is acting...

83
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:39,776
He's behind me, isn't he?

84
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:41,345
<i>Good morning, Jethro!</i>

85
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,064
- Doc.
- Gibbs.

86
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,523
Got something for me?

87
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:48,693
Just arrived from Agent Fornell.

88
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,685
Mysterious.

89
00:04:57,878 --> 00:04:58,750
Yeah.

90
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,120
<i>Yes. Well, the security boys</i>
should be finished by now.

91
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:06,026
Thanks for the hospitality...

92
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:07,299
probie.

93
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:11,758
<i>Currently, it's 78 degrees in Hollywood,</i>

94
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,093
<i>82 degrees in the Valley
and 73 at the beach.</i>

95
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:17,253
<i>All in all,
a great looking couple of days in L.A.</i>

96
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,955
<i>Warm days,
cool nights, and very low humidity...</i>

97
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:26,399
<i>Take it </i>the Ritz was booked.

98
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:29,839
Ice.

99
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,268
Better be a damn good reason

100
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:35,259
you had me jump on the earliest
flight out of Mexico.

101
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,550
You ever work with Special
Agent William Decker?

102
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:42,170
<i>He hired on the year I retired.</i>

103
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,830
Why? He's in some kind of trouble?

104
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:47,975
He's dead.

105
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:51,161
And I'm next.

106
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,967
<i>I need your help.</i>

107
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:01,577
My help?

108
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:03,020
You are the Director

109
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,297
of an armed federal agency.

110
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,572
This has to be outside the agency,

111
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:10,507
and I need someone I can trust,
and you're on the short list.

112
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:12,320
I didn't know you were a fan.

113
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:15,404
Gibbs' short list.

114
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:18,088
He trusts you with his life
and that's good enough for me.

115
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:20,465
Let's hear it.

116
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:25,736
Ten years ago, I spent time
in Europe with another agent.

117
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:28,073
I take it you two weren't sightseeing.

118
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:29,356
<i>We were...</i>

119
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,843
but the sights we were looking
for weren't on any tourist map.

120
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:34,849
The op?

121
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,355
Classified.

122
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,195
Nice chatting with you.

123
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:43,697
Enjoy the free cable.

124
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:47,479
<i>We were</i> trying to infiltrate
a Russian spy ring.

125
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:52,043
<i>Special Agent Decker</i>
was our contact agent.

126
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:54,595
He got us our identities,
<i>handled communications...</i>

127
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:55,892
I know the drill.

128
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:01,590
The name Oshimaida
was a code word we were

129
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,605
to use in the event
our cover was compromised.

130
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:06,288
And was it?

131
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:08,421
We thought we got out clean.

132
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:10,836
But today at Decker's funeral,

133
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:12,598
a man asked

134
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:14,648
for Mr. Oshimaida.

135
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:16,442
Coincidence.

136
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:19,608
Only three of us knew that name.

137
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:21,933
<i>Whoever he was,</i>

138
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:23,666
he heard that name from Decker.

139
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:27,413
And Decker only would have used it
if he thought he was about to be killed.

140
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,528
You said he died of a heart attack.

141
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:37,339
The coroner said
he died of a heart attack.

142
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:39,628
Decker was trying to get me a message.

143
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:41,004
You're next?

144
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:43,651
My partner's in danger too.

145
00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:46,627
Whoever he is,

146
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,166
he believes one of us is Oshimaida.

147
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:52,284
Who's the other agent?

148
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:58,732
The next time I head for that door,
it won't be for show.

149
00:08:00,895 --> 00:08:01,845
Gibbs.

150
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,378
Where do I sign up?

151
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:48,943
<i>Five shots of the back of his head,
none of his face,</i>

152
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:50,723
<i>and one of the woman driver.</i>

153
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:54,076
She's a great Director.
Annie Leibovitz she's not.

154
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:57,173
Any ideas?

155
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:01,082
<i>No, I know. But I can't ask McGee
because the Director</i>

156
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:03,090
<i>specifically said</i>
to keep this on the D.L.

157
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:05,185
- Keep what on the D.L.?
- Nothing.

158
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:11,379
You told them.

159
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:12,730
McGee...

160
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,400
They're not real.

161
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,109
<i>They're just keeping me company</i>

162
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,818
while Tony and Ziva are in L.A.

163
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:18,747
Okay.

164
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,705
Guess you don't need my help.

165
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:23,801
Wait.

166
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:27,415
I do need your help.

167
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,791
- But you have to keep it a secret.
- My lips are sealed.

168
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:34,745
Okay.

169
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:38,649
The Director <i>sent me these pictures.
She needs an ID on the John Doe.</i>

170
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:40,471
<i>Does Gibbs</i> know about this?

171
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:43,368
I asked her, she said no.
She didn't say any more.

172
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:46,525
- I didn't push.
- Did you try blowing up the photos?

173
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:48,248
How about...

174
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,024
The reflections on the side of the car?
That's a great idea, McGee.

175
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,637
I had it like two hours ago.

176
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:55,978
- Did you have any luck with the driver?
<i>- A woman.</i>

177
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:58,130
<i>Could be blonde, brunette.</i>
I don't know.

178
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,344
The EX-IF data <i>on the cell phone.</i>

179
00:10:06,462 --> 00:10:08,996
It should tell us the exact
time the Director took the picture.

180
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:11,643
McGee, tell me something
that cardboard Tony doesn't know.

181
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,347
No, Abby, <i>look.</i>

182
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:18,544
<i>He's making a call. </i>If we know
what time the call was placed,

183
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:21,614
<i>we can ping </i>all the
cell towers in the area...

184
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,551
And we can lift his cell phone number.

185
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:24,997
That's genius, McGee.

186
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,991
You're googling... again.

187
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:43,353
A book. How McGee-ish of you.

188
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:45,848
- You're in my sun.
- You'll thank me later.

189
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:46,916
Come on. Let's go.

190
00:10:46,964 --> 00:10:49,017
If you value that hand, I suggest

191
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:51,194
you back away slowly.

192
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:55,782
- I'm not going anywhere.
- The Director gave us the day off.

193
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:58,283
Yes, and she can just
as easily change her mind.

194
00:10:58,403 --> 00:11:00,755
We need to stay close to home base,
just in case.

195
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:02,145
<i>We have cell phones</i>, Ziva.

196
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:04,615
If she needs to get in touch with us,
she'll call us.

197
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,626
What do you have in mind?

198
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:11,673
A cruise down Sunset Boulevard, <i>Against
All Odds</i>, Jeff Bridges, Jimmy Woods.

199
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,508
You do not have a car, Tony.

200
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,883
Zero to 60 in 5.2 seconds.

201
00:11:25,104 --> 00:11:27,550
First movie quote I hear, I'm driving.

202
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,830
Pay the guy.

203
00:11:30,427 --> 00:11:31,976
- Thank you.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

204
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,396
Gibbs teach you that?

205
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:46,707
Gibbs doesn't teach.

206
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:48,377
You watch, you learn.

207
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:50,375
You learn. I taught.

208
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,353
<i>We're taking a risk coming here.</i>

209
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:05,617
Local Leos may have missed something.

210
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:08,919
I doubt Decker's killer
left behind a calling card.

211
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:11,498
If he was here,
he left something behind.

212
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,054
Or Decker did.

213
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:19,103
He was a pro.

214
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:20,777
<i>Yeah.</i>

215
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:22,824
Got a little careless in his retirement.

216
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:47,150
Sasha.

217
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:49,181
Sasha, we're not going to hurt you.

218
00:12:49,307 --> 00:12:51,001
How do you know my name?

219
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,189
You were at the funeral.

220
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:55,349
That's right.

221
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:57,618
I was an old friend of William's.

222
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,449
<i>We're here to help.</i>

223
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,513
- Help with what?
<i>- Sasha...</i>

224
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:06,605
<i>we don't think William's death</i>
was...

225
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,340
natural.

226
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:13,246
And I'm guessing you don't either.

227
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,325
If there's something
you need to tell me...

228
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:22,922
William never said anything specific.

229
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:26,402
<i>Just that if anything
was to ever happen to him,</i>

230
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:28,702
that I was to deliver a message.

231
00:13:28,978 --> 00:13:29,824
To who?

232
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,292
"<i>Jenny Shepard, Director</i>, NCIS."

233
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,708
You know her?

234
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:43,883
Unfortunately.

235
00:13:46,265 --> 00:13:47,689
We'll deliver the message.

236
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,311
William wanted me to tell her
that he had some sort of...

237
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:55,272
insurance policy.

238
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,279
<i>- I think he called it.</i>
- Where?

239
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:59,252
<i>In his place </i>out in the desert.

240
00:14:00,343 --> 00:14:01,684
An old diner.

241
00:14:01,912 --> 00:14:04,550
<i>He was going to start
fixing it up next month.</i>

242
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:07,866
He said Jenny would know where to look.

243
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,960
This the address?

244
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,331
Yeah.

245
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:13,852
Sasha.

246
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:16,964
- Do you have family?
- Not in L.A.

247
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,091
<i>- In Nevada.</i>
- Good.

248
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:21,334
Go there. Now.

249
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,294
I don't have a car.

250
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:24,973
Take my rental.

251
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,706
You should do what the lady says.

252
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,626
Okay.

253
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,124
Forget your name?

254
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:40,998
It's better she doesn't know.

255
00:14:41,118 --> 00:14:42,118
Better for who?

256
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,405
So when we find who did this...

257
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:49,499
<i>It'll be just</i> the way you like it.

258
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:52,933
No paperwork.

259
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:13,642
You wanted the authentic L.A.
experience.

260
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,297
I'm giving it to you.

261
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:16,879
I wanted to read my book.

262
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:19,447
- They have books in D.C.
- They have traffic as well.

263
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,815
I do not like this.
Something feels off.

264
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:28,295
Yeah, it's the transmission.

265
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:29,795
No, it's about the Director.

266
00:15:29,926 --> 00:15:31,572
Tony, we are her escort.

267
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:33,392
We're supposed to be escorting.

268
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:35,224
Maybe she found a new escort.

269
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,827
<i>The Director is a </i>flesh-and-blood woman
with flesh-and-blood needs.

270
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,096
<i>If you want to call and ruin
her private party, be my guest.</i>

271
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,580
<i>You couldn't have
gotten a car with SatNav?</i>

272
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:46,889
Sat what?

273
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:48,635
Never mind.

274
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:55,807
<i>Yes, Agent DiNozzo?</i>

275
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,182
Hi, Director. <i>How's everything going?
How's the paperwork?</i>

276
00:15:59,217 --> 00:16:00,868
Slow. Too many interruptions.

277
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:03,844
<i>Well, it's a beautiful
day </i>to be stuck inside.

278
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,682
You need something, Agent DiNozzo?

279
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:08,754
<i>No, just checking in
with our fearless leader.</i>

280
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:10,991
<i>- Got it.
- What'd I tell you, Tony?</i>

281
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:13,621
- Not to call you our fearless leader.
<i>- And?</i>

282
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:15,604
To take the day off.

283
00:16:15,648 --> 00:16:17,727
<i>Enjoy your time in L.A.,</i>
because, believe me,

284
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,759
I can always find
something for you to do.

285
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,018
- Paperwork had a deep voice.
- She is with a man.

286
00:16:24,104 --> 00:16:25,918
Does not mean she is sleeping with him.

287
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:28,745
You're right. I'm sure they're
tag-teaming the paperwork.

288
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:30,430
She's hiding something from us.

289
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:33,361
Yes, it's called a sex life.

290
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:36,011
Maybe if you had one,
you'd be a little more understanding.

291
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:41,420
I could tell you stories.

292
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:43,918
Tell. Slowly.

293
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,546
All right.

294
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:48,459
But first,
you have to do me one small...

295
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:49,549
<i>favor.</i>

296
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:50,977
Name it.

297
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:52,980
Call the Los Angeles Police Department,

298
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,002
<i>tell them you are conducting
a local investigation,</i>

299
00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:58,395
<i>and ask them to track down </i>the GPS
coordinates of the Director's rental.

300
00:16:58,646 --> 00:16:59,646
That's all?

301
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:02,156
It will make me very
happy to know where she is.

302
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:04,983
It'll be like Chinatown.

303
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:07,289
I will even let you do your Jack.

304
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:10,379
Well, how do you like them apples?

305
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:14,190
<i>McGee, what are you doing?!</i>

306
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:17,394
Pinging all the cell towers
<i>near the Hollywood Forever Cemetery,</i>

307
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:19,203
<i>scanning for the Director's mystery man.</i>

308
00:17:19,268 --> 00:17:21,021
No, what are you doing to my Tony?

309
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,251
<i>I'm improving him.</i>

310
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:24,324
Actually...

311
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,488
I do like a man with a little scruff.

312
00:17:29,877 --> 00:17:31,016
Got a hit.

313
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:34,993
Ten calls were in progress
<i>when the Director snapped that photo.</i>

314
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:38,260
<i>Triangulating with the
nearest cell tower for location.</i>

315
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:40,706
Hollywood Forever Cemetery <i>is here.</i>

316
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:43,251
<i>"Viggo </i>Drantyev."

317
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:45,563
Running his background.

318
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,693
Nothing in the domestic database.
Checking international.

319
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:52,716
<i>Got him.</i>

320
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:55,342
McGee, are you seeing this?

321
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:57,915
What exactly did the Director
say this was for again?

322
00:17:58,865 --> 00:17:59,954
She didn't.

323
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:03,947
It's the Director.

324
00:18:04,356 --> 00:18:05,508
Good luck with that.

325
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,712
No, you wanted in, McGee.
You're in.

326
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:10,512
Just... just be quiet.

327
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:13,098
<i>Forensic Specialist extraordinary,
Abby Sciuto.</i>

328
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:14,999
<i>- How can I help you?</i>
- Got a name?

329
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,369
<i>Hey, Director, how's...</i>

330
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:17,489
Name, Abby.

331
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:19,205
Viggo. <i>Drantyev</i>.

332
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:22,764
<i>Viggo as in Mortensen.</i>
And Drantyev as in...

333
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,493
- Drantyev.
- Background?

334
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,782
<i>He flew in from Moscow
three days ago, solo.</i>

335
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:31,879
<i>Rented a car,
checked in to the Excelsior Hotel,</i>

336
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:33,827
<i>and then he checked
out early this morning.</i>

337
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,124
- That's not background.
- <i>That's all I have.</i>

338
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:38,786
Viggo Drantyev didn't
exist until three days ago.

339
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:40,521
<i>And he doesn't anymore.</i>

340
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:43,915
- A burn alias.
- <i>Yeah, and a damn good one.</i>

341
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:46,690
<i>Totally untraceable,</i>
which is impressive these days.

342
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:50,081
Whoever this guy is,
<i>he must have friends in high places.</i>

343
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,575
<i>Like, nosebleed.</i>

344
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,511
- Anything else?
<i>- Nope.</i>

345
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:56,973
You want McGee to put out a BOLO?

346
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,437
<i>No.</i>

347
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,934
Erase the search.

348
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,764
What search?

349
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,279
So, Drantyev hits town

350
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:11,115
<i>and before sundown,
your boy Decker is dead.</i>

351
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:13,109
Not enough for a conviction.

352
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:14,684
Enough for me.

353
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:16,208
Who is he?

354
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:19,279
<i>You don't know.</i>

355
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,481
I know who sent him.

356
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,402
And I know who he's after.

357
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:32,125
One, two, three.
<i>Breathe, damn it! Breathe!</i>

358
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:36,172
I don't recall shouting being
one of the instructions,<i> Mr. Palmer.</i>

359
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:39,002
Sorry, Doctor,
I guess I got a little carried away.

360
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:40,809
<i>Hello, Jethro.</i>

361
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
New girlfriend?

362
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:46,869
<i>No, CPR recertifications.</i>

363
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:51,036
<i>Work has been </i>sufficiently slow
lately for me to be able to update them.

364
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:54,241
When can I put your name on the list?

365
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:56,456
Not today.

366
00:19:58,383 --> 00:20:00,578
Give us a minute please, <i>Mr. Palmer.</i>

367
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,532
Yeah.

368
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:03,556
<i>Annie can stay.</i>

369
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,809
I know that look, Jethro.

370
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:14,502
<i>I'm afraid I'm all out of secrets.</i>

371
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:17,273
You read the autopsy report
on the Grenouille murder.

372
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,849
<i>Yes, what about it?</i>

373
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:20,168
Anything bug you?

374
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:22,153
Normally, I am very bugged

375
00:20:22,273 --> 00:20:25,166
when a person is shot at point-blank
range in the head.

376
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,882
But in this case,
despite the man's charm,

377
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,997
I'm willing to make an exception.

378
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,925
- That a "no"?
<i>- Well,</i>

379
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:36,060
pathologically,
there was nothing out of the ordinary.

380
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:39,018
A single bullet entered
Rene's frontal lobe,

381
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:40,550
causing catastrophic

382
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,484
cerebral hemorrhaging that resulted
<i>in almost instantaneous death.</i>

383
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,367
Yeah. Yeah, I read that.

384
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:48,544
Then you know as much as I do.

385
00:20:51,726 --> 00:20:52,726
<i>Jethro...</i>

386
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:56,816
I had the impression
this case was closed.

387
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:57,934
It is.

388
00:20:58,236 --> 00:20:59,575
<i>Then why all the digging?</i>

389
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:01,227
What are you hoping to find?

390
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:04,784
<i>Answers, Duck.</i>

391
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:08,276
There's a reason why sleeping
dogs are left to lie,

392
00:21:08,821 --> 00:21:09,972
Jethro.

393
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:22,023
California.

394
00:21:22,551 --> 00:21:24,505
<i>There it is, the Director's rental.</i>

395
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:26,474
Well, what can I tell you, kid?

396
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,263
- When you're right, you're right.
<i>- The car seems fine.</i>

397
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:32,181
<i>Yes, it does.</i>

398
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:34,452
Now, can we get the hell out of here?

399
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:36,745
<i>No, that's a good idea.
We should stay here,</i>

400
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:39,026
<i>wait for </i>the Director
<i>to catch us snooping.</i>

401
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:41,479
- What is she doing here?
- You mean, who is she doing?

402
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:44,342
<i>You heard that guy on the phone.</i>
She's probably at his hotel.

403
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:47,263
<i>Now you're making some sense.</i>

404
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:49,670
Where to, miss? Rodeo Drive?

405
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:51,024
<i>Venice Beach?</i>

406
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,973
Our hotel or I file kidnapping charges.

407
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:04,954
<i>This is not good.</i>

408
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:10,255
Let me handle this, okay?

409
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:16,212
<i>- Hey, you can't come up in here.</i>
- NCIS. What's going on?

410
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:20,132
Fatality.

411
00:22:21,802 --> 00:22:23,247
Looks like she fell.

412
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:46,063
My kind of place.

413
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:50,066
<i>I'm not much of a people person.</i>

414
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:51,186
I noticed.

415
00:22:51,275 --> 00:22:52,532
Not that I don't like 'em.

416
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:54,312
They never seem <i>to like me.</i>

417
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:56,454
Decker didn't have that problem.

418
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:59,001
Then why's he dead?

419
00:23:00,357 --> 00:23:03,468
<i>Better save that for the guy that killed
Decker. You might need it.</i>

420
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,042
<i>First we have to find him.</i>

421
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:07,347
If he knows about
Decker's insurance policy,

422
00:23:08,174 --> 00:23:09,312
he'll find us.

423
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,189
<i>There's no obvious signs of foul play.</i>

424
00:23:20,323 --> 00:23:22,760
Depends on what you mean by obvious.
She is dead.

425
00:23:23,181 --> 00:23:24,814
You said she just buried her boyfriend.

426
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,971
Well, she obviously,
you know, <i>been hitting the bottle.</i>

427
00:23:27,017 --> 00:23:30,064
<i>- She could have fallen. Or jumped.</i>
- Or was pushed.

428
00:23:31,098 --> 00:23:34,121
- You know something I don't?
<i>- No. She she's just... </i>it's, you know.

429
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:36,035
Give us a second.<i> Excuse me.</i>

430
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,592
- What are you doing?
- Leave the Director out of this.

431
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:44,720
- The Director's car is right there.
- Yeah, there are 50 cars right there.

432
00:23:44,804 --> 00:23:48,210
<i>Well, I'm not providing</i>
security detail for those 50 others.

433
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,775
Sasha's been dead for two hours.

434
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:53,070
We talked to the Director 20 minutes
ago. She said everything was fine.

435
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,745
Probably just a coincidence.

436
00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:56,812
You don't really believe that, do you?

437
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:00,437
No.

438
00:24:09,735 --> 00:24:11,561
<i>This is not</i> what it looks like, Gibbs.

439
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:12,481
CPR.

440
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:15,483
So, I guess it's exactly
what it looks like.

441
00:24:15,545 --> 00:24:17,025
- Ducky wanted us...
- I know.

442
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:18,296
Right.

443
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:22,642
So... what brings

444
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:25,613
<i>the Almighty Gibbs</i> to my humble lab?

445
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:26,787
The frog.

446
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:28,960
<i>Sorry I asked.</i>
I thought that case was closed.

447
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:34,774
Shell casings contain
<i>a variety of useful data points.</i>

448
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:37,268
The first one...

449
00:24:38,183 --> 00:24:41,402
<i>is this indentation
caused by the firing pin.</i>

450
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,166
<i>Its position narrows down
the list of possible firearms.</i>

451
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:46,665
Can you tie it to a specific gun?

452
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:49,579
Yep, in 2010.

453
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,978
<i>That's when the manufacturers</i>
will be required by law

454
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,473
to microstamp
<i>a serial number onto the firing pin.</i>

455
00:24:54,523 --> 00:24:56,796
- Today, Abs.
- Well, it depends on who you ask.

456
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,337
I'm asking you.

457
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:02,065
<i>Okay, the second data point is this.</i>

458
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:05,093
<i>It's breechblock pattern
around the back of the shell casing.</i>

459
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:07,630
<i>It comes from the concussive
force of the gun firing.</i>

460
00:25:07,843 --> 00:25:10,759
<i>It won't let you say definitively
if a particular gun was used,</i>

461
00:25:10,863 --> 00:25:12,461
but it can rule a gun out.

462
00:25:14,018 --> 00:25:15,717
This is interesting.

463
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,273
<i>That scratch,</i>

464
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:24,728
<i>it could be an ejector impression
from when</i> the spent case was ejected

465
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:28,656
or it could have come from
a slight defect in the gun clip.

466
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:32,649
I couldn't really say for sure
without inspecting the clip<i> but,</i>

467
00:25:32,724 --> 00:25:36,263
either way, I doubt it's definitive
enough to be admissible in court.

468
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:41,849
I know.

469
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:43,530
<i>I have a really bad feeling, too.</i>

470
00:25:43,698 --> 00:25:45,185
Why didn't you stop me?

471
00:25:48,332 --> 00:25:50,908
<i>Thought you knew where
this insurance policy was.</i>

472
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,904
I never said I knew.
Decker said I did.

473
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,116
<i>And stop looking at my ass.</i>

474
00:25:58,203 --> 00:25:59,921
Not much else to look at.

475
00:26:00,097 --> 00:26:03,322
Of course, it might help if you were
to tell me what I was looking for.

476
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:06,015
<i>Decker knew that someone was after him.</i>

477
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:08,124
And he knew why.

478
00:26:08,648 --> 00:26:09,799
Your mystery op.

479
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:13,656
Any useful insurance
policy would contain names.

480
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:15,176
"Viggo".

481
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:16,177
<i>Real names.</i>

482
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:17,772
<i>Targets.</i> Dates.

483
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:21,147
Plus operational blueprints, photos.

484
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,141
We got plenty of those.

485
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:02,988
<i>These dates are wrong.</i>

486
00:27:08,578 --> 00:27:09,672
Do you have a pen?

487
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:22,642
This is
<i>Decker's retirement party in 2007.</i>

488
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:27,148
<i>Crime Analysts conference,'02.</i>

489
00:27:31,624 --> 00:27:34,158
<i>September</i> 18th, 2004.

490
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:36,992
Hopkins-<i>De La Hoya.</i>

491
00:27:39,822 --> 00:27:41,675
<i>This is some kind of code.</i>

492
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:43,607
<i>Bank routing number?</i>

493
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:45,676
Too long for a cash account.

494
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:47,855
Safe deposit box.

495
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:51,699
Ziva.

496
00:27:51,848 --> 00:27:52,833
Again.

497
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:55,576
You don't answer it,
they're gonna call in the SWAT team.

498
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,741
This better be World War III,
Officer David.

499
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:02,333
Sasha Gordon is dead.

500
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,371
- What happened?
- LAPD's still investigating.

501
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:09,812
It appears
<i>that she broke her neck in a fall.</i>

502
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,057
<i>Director, she was found</i>

503
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:14,359
less than a hundred meters away
from your vehicle. <i>Where are you?</i>

504
00:28:14,422 --> 00:28:16,379
- When?
<i>- Three hours ago.</i>

505
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:18,342
<i>Director,
we are assigned to protect you.</i>

506
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:20,475
<i>This is not</i> just a coincidence.
Where are you?

507
00:28:20,662 --> 00:28:22,971
I don't appreciate your tone,
Officer David.

508
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:25,853
<i>And despite what Special Agent Gibbs
may have told you,</i>

509
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:28,755
coincidences do exist.
And that is what we have here.

510
00:28:28,818 --> 00:28:30,451
<i>- Okay, but...</i>
- I'm fine.

511
00:28:30,845 --> 00:28:32,707
<i>There's nothing to worry about.</i>

512
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:35,260
I'll meet you later
to take the red-eye flight home.

513
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:39,891
Good news?

514
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,121
Not for Sasha.

515
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:44,499
That went well.

516
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:46,557
The Director's lying.
She's not fine.

517
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,931
Why would she lie?

518
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:49,601
Maybe she was forced.

519
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:51,864
- Did she use the duress word?
- No.

520
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:53,271
Well then, there you go.

521
00:28:53,414 --> 00:28:56,429
If someone had a gun to her head,
she would use the duress word.

522
00:28:57,043 --> 00:28:59,190
Tony, there is something going on here.

523
00:28:59,357 --> 00:29:00,467
How can you not...

524
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,039
You do see it.

525
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,033
<i>- You just don't want to get involved.</i>
- She doesn't want us involved.

526
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:09,777
<i>If there's one thing I've learned
about the Director's private wars,</i>

527
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:12,899
it's that it's best to stay away.
For her and for us.

528
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,132
<i>She's a big girl.
She can take care of herself.</i>

529
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:18,012
<i>Besides, probably
is a coincidence, anyway.</i>

530
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:20,247
And she's behind one of
those expensive windows

531
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:23,567
<i>munching on overpriced cashews courtesy
of Mr. Outtatown.</i>

532
00:29:28,675 --> 00:29:30,658
I told Sasha to leave town.

533
00:29:30,857 --> 00:29:33,662
<i>Probably went back to her
apartment to grab a few things.</i>

534
00:29:34,547 --> 00:29:37,751
If Viggo got to her,
we have to assume she talked.

535
00:29:37,897 --> 00:29:39,142
Knows about us.

536
00:29:39,704 --> 00:29:42,426
- And this place.
<i>- And Decker's</i> insurance policy.

537
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:03,824
Guess he's gonna be on his way.

538
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:06,119
If we leave now...

539
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,425
You can go.

540
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:11,440
I'm staying.

541
00:30:12,015 --> 00:30:13,816
This ends here.

542
00:30:24,128 --> 00:30:25,823
You're gonna need a clean one.

543
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:45,116
<i>- Gibbs.
- We should call him.</i>

544
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:46,733
But we're not going to.

545
00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:50,014
He would want us to.

546
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
Would he?

547
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:54,003
Of course. They were partners. If
the Director was in trouble, he would...

548
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,070
We do not know that she is in trouble.

549
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,053
Okay, I'll give you that one.

550
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:01,793
<i>But...</i>

551
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:05,041
you want to be the one
to tell Gibbs that we

552
00:31:05,104 --> 00:31:06,821
let the Director out of our sight?

553
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:09,038
Good point.

554
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:11,731
But it's a risk we have to take.

555
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,624
Or we compromise.

556
00:31:24,387 --> 00:31:25,387
Agent McGee.

557
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:27,883
<i>What took you so long?
Were you sitting at my desk?</i>

558
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:29,854
- No.
<i>- You're lying.</i>

559
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,200
- Tony, what do you want?
<i>- Your advice.</i>

560
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,393
- You lost the Director, didn't you?
- No.

561
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,000
- <i>Now, you're lying.</i>
- You were sitting at my desk.

562
00:31:38,085 --> 00:31:40,249
We did not lose the Director.
We just...

563
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:42,419
<i>we just don't know where she is.</i>

564
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,164
Gibbs is gonna kill you guys.

565
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:47,186
All right, calm down, McGee.
Don't get your panties in a twist.

566
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:49,748
We just talked to her.
She said she's fine.

567
00:31:49,818 --> 00:31:51,325
She just said she needed...

568
00:31:51,514 --> 00:31:52,917
a little alone time.

569
00:31:53,117 --> 00:31:54,967
I'm just worried
she might be under duress.

570
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:57,626
Did she use the duress word?

571
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:00,451
No.

572
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:02,589
Then she probably is fine.

573
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,590
Thank you.

574
00:32:03,662 --> 00:32:05,036
The Great McOz has spoken.

575
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,660
I need you to trace her cell.

576
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,308
Wait, you want me to trace
the Director's cell? Forget it.

577
00:32:09,351 --> 00:32:10,879
<i>Gibbs is not gonna like that.</i>

578
00:32:11,061 --> 00:32:12,946
I thought you said
you weren't gonna call him.

579
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:14,519
We won't.

580
00:32:15,122 --> 00:32:17,377
If you trace her cell.

581
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:19,004
Do it, McGee.

582
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:22,436
<i>If we figure out she's at the
Farmer's Daughter Motel with some guy,</i>

583
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:24,069
<i>then </i>we'll just call it a day.

584
00:32:25,947 --> 00:32:26,947
All right.

585
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:29,080
<i>Pulling up the Director's ESN number.</i>

586
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:31,033
<i>Pinging all towers in the L.A. area.</i>

587
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,103
<i>No hits.</i>

588
00:32:34,183 --> 00:32:35,661
Expand the search.

589
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:40,836
<i>Still no hits.</i>
<i>Must have her phone turned off.</i>

590
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:44,134
I can, however, tell you
where she made her last call from.

591
00:32:45,483 --> 00:32:48,771
<i>Just off </i>the 14,
about 35 miles <i>into the Mojave Desert.</i>

592
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:52,329
- 50 miles away from her car.
- You got an exact location?

593
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,392
- I'll work on it.
- Let us know.

594
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,132
- This is not a good idea.
- Humor me.

595
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,163
You always clean
your gun before a fight?

596
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:10,903
It's not my gun.

597
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:14,823
You always sit on your ass before one?

598
00:33:16,543 --> 00:33:18,093
What should I be doing?

599
00:33:18,806 --> 00:33:21,131
<i>Assessing our situation.</i>

600
00:33:21,882 --> 00:33:23,389
You read that in the manual?

601
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,731
Deadbolt: Schlage.

602
00:33:26,814 --> 00:33:28,259
Same lock as the front.

603
00:33:28,361 --> 00:33:31,795
Wood-frame,
stucco exterior, lath-and-plaster walls.

604
00:33:31,832 --> 00:33:33,146
Stone<i> in the rear.</i>

605
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:36,696
<i>If they don't come too heavy,</i>
should provide adequate cover.

606
00:33:37,072 --> 00:33:38,810
Situation assessed.

607
00:33:49,076 --> 00:33:50,691
I never said thanks.

608
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:53,417
Thank me later.

609
00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:00,409
<i>When I first heard</i>

610
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,031
that Decker died of a heart attack,

611
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:04,516
<i>I was relieved</i>

612
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:07,404
Gibbs did say you were complicated.

613
00:34:07,734 --> 00:34:09,798
Relieved because I always knew

614
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,813
that there was a chance
this could come back to haunt us.

615
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:15,708
And it's my fault.

616
00:34:18,318 --> 00:34:21,019
I made some choices I'm
not particularly proud of.

617
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:23,151
We all have.

618
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,122
Even Gibbs?

619
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:27,835
He let you go.

620
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:30,883
No.

621
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,972
He didn't.

622
00:34:34,014 --> 00:34:36,561
<i>He didn't fit into my five-point plan.</i>

623
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,441
Back to choices.

624
00:34:38,884 --> 00:34:40,127
You made your bed.

625
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:42,472
What if I don't want to sleep in it?

626
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:47,782
Gibbs knows?

627
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:49,799
Would it make a difference?

628
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,007
He came back, didn't he?

629
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:54,005
Came back for the job.

630
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:57,552
<i>Well, that would explain</i>
all the conversations we had on my boat.

631
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,750
<i>You know,</i>

632
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:02,506
about the job.

633
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:06,854
You're still young.

634
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:09,357
You got plenty of time to make right.

635
00:35:32,555 --> 00:35:33,686
We could have made it.

636
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:36,169
The needle is below "E".
"E" stands for empty.

637
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:37,952
We have less than empty.

638
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,886
And we don't even know where it is.

639
00:35:40,032 --> 00:35:41,267
We could have made it.

640
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,440
- What?!
- What?!

641
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:54,414
Try to make yourself useful.

642
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,448
What?!

643
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,824
I said, why don't
you make yourself useful?

644
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:01,161
What do you want me to do?

645
00:36:01,383 --> 00:36:02,953
Hold your nozzle?

646
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:05,299
Get us a map.

647
00:36:12,716 --> 00:36:14,307
<i>Some white powdered donuts.</i>

648
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:16,167
<i>And some Blue Ice Gatorade.</i>

649
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:24,408
- You better have my coordinates.
- Even better. I got an address.

650
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:27,540
<i>Did some checking. Turns out
Decker has a little diner in the desert,</i>

651
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:29,413
<i>and I can place Jenny's
call to within...</i>

652
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:30,771
What's the address?

653
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,251
- Just sent it to your PDA.
<i>- You deserve a probie snack.</i>

654
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:36,474
Get yourself one, but not from my desk
drawer. Use the vending machine.

655
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:45,707
<i>Might be hard to believe,
but I was in love once.</i>

656
00:36:46,118 --> 00:36:47,335
Her name was Maggie.

657
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:48,864
<i>She had it all.</i>

658
00:36:49,237 --> 00:36:51,708
<i>Quick as a fox, </i>great curves.

659
00:36:51,854 --> 00:36:53,257
Trusted her with my life.

660
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:54,731
What happened?

661
00:36:55,477 --> 00:36:57,869
Traded her for a Harley
when the transmission blew.

662
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:04,474
<i>You know, when I asked you if
Gibbs knew,</i>

663
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:07,841
<i>I wasn't talking about
your feelings for him.</i>

664
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,859
I was asking if
he knew you were sick.

665
00:37:13,884 --> 00:37:15,688
<i>Gonna lie to me now?</i>

666
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,032
What makes you think I'm sick?

667
00:37:19,563 --> 00:37:22,704
Person gets a look in their eye
when time's running out.

668
00:37:23,182 --> 00:37:24,428
You're not that good.

669
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,848
- Found your pills.
- You went through my purse?

670
00:37:29,968 --> 00:37:33,423
<i>Your purse and your cell
phone and your glove box.</i>

671
00:37:33,728 --> 00:37:35,343
Just being thorough?

672
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:36,328
You blame me?

673
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,607
Gibbs doesn't know.

674
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:47,940
What are you waiting for?

675
00:37:49,515 --> 00:37:50,779
Good question.

676
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:45,430
- What?
<i>- Turn</i>

677
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:47,942
<i>at the giant cactus, right?</i>

678
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,664
That is what he said.

679
00:38:59,108 --> 00:39:01,255
<i>- Found some tea.
- What kind?</i>

680
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:03,269
Does it matter?

681
00:39:03,557 --> 00:39:05,358
Only drink lemongrass.

682
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,624
You just don't strike me
as a tea-drinking kind of guy.

683
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:10,642
And people say I don't open up.

684
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,056
Well,
no water, so, so much for the tea.

685
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,125
I spotted a water tank out back.

686
00:39:17,644 --> 00:39:19,364
- I'll go.
- Let me.

687
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,568
I've got to hit the head again anyway.

688
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:23,325
<i>You're up.</i>

689
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:48,553
<i>The weapon was loaded,
and I wasn't here,</i>

690
00:39:48,993 --> 00:39:50,963
<i>would you have pulled the trigger?</i>

691
00:40:02,122 --> 00:40:04,320
<i>Thought you might want this back.</i>

692
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:26,152
<i>There it is.</i>

693
00:41:27,094 --> 00:41:29,346
<i>Look. </i>I have seen that SUV before.

694
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:31,975
Gas station.

695
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,632
You still believe the Director's
on one of your booty calls?

696
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:41,773
Well, if there's a sock on the doorknob,
you're knocking.

697
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:58,997
You're in.

698
00:42:12,451 --> 00:42:13,451
Clear.

699
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:29,844
Tony.

700
00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:18,665
<i>Jenny?</i>

701
00:43:19,392 --> 00:43:20,965
<i>Jenny, you there?</i>

702
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:30,810
Wait there.

703
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,259
I'll come to you.

704
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,280
I said to wait.

705
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,228
<i>And I said not to.</i>

706
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:10,461
This is my crime scene.

707
00:44:15,977 --> 00:44:18,027
You called SecNav, he called me.

708
00:44:26,062 --> 00:44:27,412
I'm sorry, Jethro.

709
00:44:52,813 --> 00:44:54,963
<i>Bodies were picked up last night.</i>

710
00:44:55,378 --> 00:44:56,828
They're going to DC.

711
00:44:57,502 --> 00:45:00,061
- Ducky?
- He'll be handling the autopsies.

712
00:45:03,032 --> 00:45:05,882
First two shooters
came through the front door,

713
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,460
the other two came from over there.

714
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,130
She stood here.

715
00:45:13,725 --> 00:45:15,193
<i>She got off the first shots.</i>

716
00:45:16,009 --> 00:45:18,696
Shooter number one
never even fired his weapon.

717
00:45:21,381 --> 00:45:23,034
She took heavy fire after that.

718
00:45:27,116 --> 00:45:30,124
One in the shoulder, <i>one in the arm.
She started moving this way,</i>

719
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,794
<i>the other two entered
through the side door.</i>

720
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:36,493
<i>Second shooter went down there.</i>

721
00:45:39,996 --> 00:45:42,820
<i>She dropped to her knee.</i>
She fired three more times.

722
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,310
<i>Which leaves the fourth shooter.</i>

723
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,190
We know how that ended.

724
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:08,079
She put up a hell of a fight.

725
00:46:10,122 --> 00:46:11,372
Not good enough.

726
00:46:11,913 --> 00:46:14,063
She was outnumbered, five to one.

727
00:46:16,428 --> 00:46:18,678
I think you got to check your math.

728
00:46:24,832 --> 00:46:28,623
We found four .45 caliber
shell casings and no .45.

729
00:46:30,043 --> 00:46:32,193
<i>Somebody walked out of here alive.</i>

730
00:46:35,037 --> 00:46:36,887
There was a second car here.

731
00:46:37,344 --> 00:46:39,194
It was the Director's ride.

732
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:41,779
The fifth gunman must've taken it.

733
00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:45,541
- No blood?
<i>- Nothing but a tire track.</i>

734
00:46:46,232 --> 00:46:49,708
<i>We'll put out a BOLO
as soon as</i> we can ID the car.

735
00:46:49,944 --> 00:46:52,582
<i>I'm sure you want to get this bastard
as bad as I do.</i>

736
00:46:56,162 --> 00:46:57,753
<i>Bodies are on their way to DC.</i>

737
00:46:58,574 --> 00:47:02,124
<i>I chartered a private transport,
should be arriving shortly.</i>

738
00:47:04,194 --> 00:47:06,585
- What do you got?
<i>- I'm sorry,</i> Gibbs.

739
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:09,223
- We are sorry.
- What do you got?

740
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:10,528
Not a lot.

741
00:47:11,394 --> 00:47:13,728
<i>Tire tracks are from a second vehicle.</i>

742
00:47:16,475 --> 00:47:17,985
We're working on it.

743
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,689
We should've tailed her. Ziva...

744
00:47:23,016 --> 00:47:24,666
Ziva wanted to tail her.

745
00:47:25,648 --> 00:47:26,952
Why didn't you?

746
00:47:27,538 --> 00:47:28,921
We were given an order.

747
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:30,553
And you followed it.

748
00:47:31,034 --> 00:47:32,584
And now Jenny is dead.

749
00:47:33,614 --> 00:47:34,832
<i>We keep a lid on this.</i>

750
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:38,368
No press, no public statements.
Understood?

751
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,463
It's a cover-up. Understood.

752
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:43,841
I'm heading back to DC with the bodies.

753
00:47:44,135 --> 00:47:47,459
Agent Gibbs, you will remain here
and oversee my investigation.

754
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:50,348
<i>I'll expect a call</i> when you're finished.

755
00:47:56,902 --> 00:47:58,784
Oversee his investigation.

756
00:48:04,787 --> 00:48:06,137
<i>And then call me.</i>

757
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:24,595
You're late.

758
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,930
The least of my problems.

759
00:48:28,624 --> 00:48:32,265
Well, I got another one for you.
Vance knows there was someone else

760
00:48:32,387 --> 00:48:34,225
<i>- at the diner.</i>
- My tire tracks?

761
00:48:35,682 --> 00:48:37,812
I'm not the only one with a problem.

762
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:40,439
Jenny died protecting someone.

763
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:42,559
Who?

764
00:48:43,201 --> 00:48:44,201
You.

765
00:48:51,973 --> 00:48:54,745
<i>- Call him again.</i>
- I've already left Tony five messages.

766
00:48:54,867 --> 00:48:56,706
- Call Ziva.
- Eight messages.

767
00:48:57,572 --> 00:48:59,875
Why'd you call Ziva
more than you called Tony?

768
00:48:59,997 --> 00:49:03,129
Right, not important.
What is important is we remain calm.

769
00:49:03,493 --> 00:49:06,071
- I am calm.
<i>- Don't you care about your friends?</i>

770
00:49:06,072 --> 00:49:07,396
You just said...

771
00:49:07,397 --> 00:49:08,204
Nevermind.

772
00:49:08,205 --> 00:49:10,090
We haven't heard anything
from Tony and Ziva,

773
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:12,139
then Gibbs gets on an airplane
without a word.

774
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,888
Something is wrong! I can feel it.

775
00:49:14,336 --> 00:49:17,386
If something bad happened,
I'm sure we would've...

776
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:19,770
- ... heard by now.
- What is it?

777
00:49:19,926 --> 00:49:22,040
- E-mail from Tony.
- Let me see.

778
00:49:22,137 --> 00:49:23,278
I can't look.

779
00:49:26,026 --> 00:49:27,723
Photos... tire prints.

780
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:30,948
<i>Tony wants me to find out</i>
what car it came from asap.

781
00:49:32,277 --> 00:49:33,277
That's it?!

782
00:49:33,953 --> 00:49:37,088
- Are they working a case?
- Am I interrupting something?

783
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,290
Just Abby's nervous breakdown.

784
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:41,313
I'm sure everyone is fine.

785
00:49:41,863 --> 00:49:44,211
Do you have any reason
to believe otherwise?

786
00:49:44,574 --> 00:49:47,632
Well, Tony just e-mailed me.
<i>It looks like they've started working</i>

787
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:50,009
<i>- some kind of case.</i>
- So there's your answer.

788
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:51,780
They're working on a case.

789
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:55,609
Common courtesy
is the first casualty in a Jethro war.

790
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,260
Who is it?

791
00:50:02,077 --> 00:50:03,127
It's for me.

792
00:50:03,813 --> 00:50:04,813
Jethro...

793
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:08,047
Ducky.

794
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:12,220
I know I typically dominate
the<i> conversation,</i>

795
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:13,802
<i>but since you called me...</i>

796
00:50:13,818 --> 00:50:14,956
Jenny's dead.

797
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:18,170
<i>Yesterday.</i>

798
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:21,354
Dear...

799
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,836
- I can't believe that <i>it happened so...</i>
- She was murdered.

800
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:27,251
<i>Firefight.</i>

801
00:50:29,073 --> 00:50:31,083
- Tony and Ziva?
- Not involved.

802
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:33,636
- What can I do?
- <i>Five bodies...</i>

803
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,699
- on their way.
- I assume one of them is...

804
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:41,435
Tell McGee, tell Abby.
I'm gonna need them.

805
00:50:46,786 --> 00:50:47,936
I know, Duck.

806
00:50:58,522 --> 00:50:59,495
Who?

807
00:51:18,094 --> 00:51:19,098
Everything.

808
00:51:21,318 --> 00:51:23,346
She called me two days ago.

809
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:26,747
Said she needed some help

810
00:51:26,748 --> 00:51:29,231
from someone outside the agency.

811
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:31,987
Another one of her ops.

812
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:33,821
One of yours.

813
00:51:34,565 --> 00:51:35,565
Europe.

814
00:51:37,683 --> 00:51:40,228
Well, I spent a lot of time in Europe.

815
00:51:41,953 --> 00:51:43,403
She wasn't specific.

816
00:51:46,575 --> 00:51:48,711
What'd I tell you about

817
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:50,692
leaving them loose ends?

818
00:51:50,918 --> 00:51:51,749
Not to.

819
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:53,936
We didn't.

820
00:51:55,269 --> 00:51:58,371
Well, you screwed the pooch somewhere.

821
00:52:00,062 --> 00:52:01,675
<i>Decker's cover was blown.</i>

822
00:52:02,131 --> 00:52:05,119
<i>They found him.</i>
Made it look like a heart attack.

823
00:52:06,812 --> 00:52:07,812
"They"?

824
00:52:09,408 --> 00:52:10,858
Decker's funeral...

825
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:15,286
there was a guy named Viggo
came looking for a man.

826
00:52:15,953 --> 00:52:17,236
Oshimaida.

827
00:52:19,823 --> 00:52:20,973
Relax, probie.

828
00:52:21,303 --> 00:52:23,829
Classified went out the window
two days ago.

829
00:52:25,397 --> 00:52:28,542
<i>I know Oshimaida </i>was the code you used

830
00:52:28,553 --> 00:52:30,503
if your cover was compromised.

831
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,592
In Paris, nine years ago.

832
00:52:35,116 --> 00:52:36,751
Decker resurrected it.

833
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:41,205
When they found him,
instead of giving you up,

834
00:52:41,568 --> 00:52:43,213
he sent you a warning.

835
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:46,519
Bought you guys some time.

836
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,165
Not enough.

837
00:52:48,926 --> 00:52:51,616
<i>She knew what she was getting into.</i>

838
00:52:53,483 --> 00:52:56,504
Her last stand was to protect you.

839
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:01,351
Who protected her? Mike?

840
00:53:05,658 --> 00:53:06,808
What happened?

841
00:53:10,469 --> 00:53:11,959
I was out back.

842
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:15,543
I saw 'em going in the side door.

843
00:53:19,388 --> 00:53:20,388
Too late.

844
00:53:26,232 --> 00:53:27,701
I did what I could.

845
00:53:30,706 --> 00:53:31,856
You always do.

846
00:53:34,205 --> 00:53:36,455
If you're looking for <i>an apology...</i>

847
00:53:37,932 --> 00:53:39,082
I know better.

848
00:53:42,243 --> 00:53:43,591
I'm sorry, Gunny.

849
00:53:51,972 --> 00:53:54,378
I'm almost done here.
Where's that next batch?

850
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:56,801
Coming.

851
00:54:18,028 --> 00:54:19,028
It's okay.

852
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,416
Abby, it's okay.

853
00:54:22,454 --> 00:54:24,030
No, it's not.

854
00:54:30,673 --> 00:54:32,123
<i>We have work to do.</i>

855
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:41,978
- Abby, slow down.
- I can't.

856
00:54:44,628 --> 00:54:45,628
Let me.

857
00:54:51,373 --> 00:54:52,923
How could this happen?

858
00:54:54,263 --> 00:54:55,413
I don't know.

859
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,830
Where were Tony and Ziva?!

860
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:05,829
I don't know.

861
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:09,036
And don't ask me what I do know,
because I don't know that, either.

862
00:55:14,535 --> 00:55:15,876
I need more time.

863
00:55:16,064 --> 00:55:18,342
How long does it take
to track a tire print, McGee?

864
00:55:18,343 --> 00:55:19,880
<i>We're going as fast as we can.</i>

865
00:55:20,281 --> 00:55:23,499
- Tony, what happened?
- Not the time... I need that ID now.

866
00:55:23,714 --> 00:55:26,795
<i>Got it. It's a P-235</i> all-season radial.

867
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:28,778
It's a custom mold.

868
00:55:28,899 --> 00:55:32,476
<i>Sold exclusively to</i> the Western Rental
chain for their Mercury Grand Marquis.

869
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,066
Check their Los Angeles Airport office.

870
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:37,398
All Grand Marquis
rented in the last 48 hours.

871
00:55:37,582 --> 00:55:39,121
Got it. Calling you back.

872
00:55:39,122 --> 00:55:42,111
<i>Do it now, or have Abby do it.</i>
She seems to be having better luck.

873
00:55:46,128 --> 00:55:48,575
We're opening a port
into <i>Western Rental Servers.</i>

874
00:55:49,303 --> 00:55:52,329
<i>I'm checking all the customer records
for the last 48 hours.</i>

875
00:55:52,513 --> 00:55:54,707
Ten Grand Marquis at the LAX office.

876
00:55:55,377 --> 00:55:58,006
<i>Three rented this week.</i>
Only one in the past two days.

877
00:55:58,007 --> 00:56:01,777
It hasn't been returned.
<i>Joe Hill </i>out of New Mexico.

878
00:56:04,116 --> 00:56:06,997
No listing at the DMV.
Must have used a fake ID.

879
00:56:06,998 --> 00:56:09,401
<i>That's our guy. Get it!
I want that photo.</i>

880
00:56:09,402 --> 00:56:12,587
Well, it's not on the server,
but I should be able to find it on...

881
00:56:19,197 --> 00:56:21,447
- What?
- It is not McGee's fault.

882
00:56:21,535 --> 00:56:22,776
No. It's not.

883
00:56:26,055 --> 00:56:27,565
We left Paris clean.

884
00:56:32,817 --> 00:56:33,967
Jenny told me.

885
00:56:34,614 --> 00:56:36,426
And I might have bought it,

886
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:37,605
except...

887
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,812
there were three agents on that op.

888
00:56:41,673 --> 00:56:42,823
Two are dead.

889
00:56:45,066 --> 00:56:46,066
The op?

890
00:56:52,447 --> 00:56:53,447
How many?

891
00:56:56,078 --> 00:56:57,078
One each.

892
00:57:00,426 --> 00:57:01,936
You verify the kill?

893
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,420
Her kill.

894
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:07,708
Jen was a pro.

895
00:57:09,569 --> 00:57:10,569
I noticed.

896
00:57:12,214 --> 00:57:13,542
What about Decker?

897
00:57:13,881 --> 00:57:17,343
- I hear he had a thing for the ladies.
<i>- What is your point?</i>

898
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:19,444
Maybe he was compromised.

899
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:21,493
We got out clean.

900
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,569
Jenny knew something you didn't, probie.

901
00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:30,828
And so did Decker.

902
00:57:32,392 --> 00:57:34,833
<i>He knew this might not be over.</i>

903
00:57:35,437 --> 00:57:37,320
Left an insurance policy.

904
00:57:40,898 --> 00:57:42,284
The numbers were...

905
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:45,275
<i>Coded in photos.</i>

906
00:57:46,426 --> 00:57:49,413
- The way we did it back then.
<i>- We burned the original.</i>

907
00:57:50,481 --> 00:57:52,031
That's the only copy.

908
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:55,160
I'll let you know.

909
00:57:57,889 --> 00:57:59,832
You need me on this one, probie.

910
00:58:00,598 --> 00:58:03,841
<i>Viggo was just a </i>hired gun.
There's someone else out there.

911
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,380
It's not your fight, Mike.

912
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:09,758
Vance is looking for you.

913
00:58:10,684 --> 00:58:12,297
<i>So go back to Mexico.</i>

914
00:58:13,303 --> 00:58:15,453
Give my goddaughter a hug for me.

915
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,858
<i>Joe Hill. H-I-L-L.</i>

916
00:58:27,631 --> 00:58:29,681
Great. Send the photo. Thanks.

917
00:58:39,513 --> 00:58:40,688
You got a pen?

918
00:58:41,922 --> 00:58:43,822
- I'm sorry...
- <i>You got a pen?</i>

919
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:46,879
Got a keyboard.

920
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,047
Seven-one-three-nine-nine,

921
00:58:49,629 --> 00:58:50,662
<i>dash,</i>

922
00:58:50,796 --> 00:58:53,427
two-one-eight-one, dash,
five-three-seven-eight.

923
00:58:53,896 --> 00:58:55,846
- What is it?
- I don't know.

924
00:58:56,705 --> 00:58:58,360
But I'm going to find out.

925
00:58:59,389 --> 00:59:01,473
- When are you back?
- On my way.

926
00:59:01,724 --> 00:59:03,270
<i>What about Tony and...</i>

927
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:07,888
<i>- McGee?
- Boss, we got a problem here.</i>

928
00:59:09,499 --> 00:59:10,499
Just one?

929
00:59:10,806 --> 00:59:13,753
<i>The I.D. on the tire tracks
from Decker's</i> diner came in.

930
00:59:13,754 --> 00:59:15,657
- Car was rented to...
- Mike Franks.

931
00:59:16,484 --> 00:59:18,827
- Yeah. How did you...?
- Erase it.

932
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,105
- Agent Vance wanted...
- McGee, erase it!

933
00:59:49,314 --> 00:59:50,317
Viggo.

934
00:59:55,223 --> 00:59:57,248
Makes me miss California already.

935
00:59:58,459 --> 01:00:01,286
Assistant Director Vance.
Didn't know that you were...

936
01:00:01,425 --> 01:00:03,620
Just got in. Late night?

937
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:07,209
- Still logging crime scene photos.
- Anything on the shooters?

938
01:00:09,498 --> 01:00:12,829
Three of them <i>had
a list of prior felonies in the LA area.</i>

939
01:00:13,165 --> 01:00:15,717
- $5,000 cash on them.
- Local hires.

940
01:00:16,249 --> 01:00:19,012
The fourth shooter <i>used a burn-alias
to fly from Moscow</i>

941
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:20,875
<i>into DC, finally into LA.</i>

942
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:22,805
<i>Viggo Drantyev.</i>

943
01:00:22,981 --> 01:00:24,931
Abby and I ran the name
for the Direct...

944
01:00:30,214 --> 01:00:31,214
<i>The...</i>

945
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:34,121
Director took a photo of him

946
01:00:34,122 --> 01:00:35,843
at William Decker's funeral.

947
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:37,499
Asked us to get an ID.

948
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:40,409
<i>BOLO?</i>

949
01:00:42,463 --> 01:00:43,745
There wasn't one.

950
01:00:46,065 --> 01:00:48,086
Have Washington-Dulles TSA

951
01:00:48,302 --> 01:00:51,295
<i>pull every piece of security footage</i>
on Mr. Drantyev.

952
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,338
<i>The gate, customs,</i> baggage claim.

953
01:00:53,894 --> 01:00:54,944
On it, boss.

954
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:58,760
Any lead on the fifth shooter?

955
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:01,839
Nothing yet.

956
01:01:02,215 --> 01:01:04,265
All right, give it another hour.

957
01:01:04,387 --> 01:01:05,934
Then go home, get some rest.

958
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:24,799
Doctor.

959
01:01:25,757 --> 01:01:27,286
I've never had to...

960
01:01:28,052 --> 01:01:29,502
autopsy a colleague.

961
01:01:30,594 --> 01:01:34,257
I assure you, Mr. Palmer,
the next one won't be any easier.

962
01:01:39,341 --> 01:01:43,169
You, my dear, were a woman
who always knew what she wanted.

963
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:47,674
A trait which some
may have seen as mere careerism,

964
01:01:47,694 --> 01:01:51,253
rather than the true sense of duty,
I know carried you.

965
01:01:52,346 --> 01:01:54,288
That's why I can't help wondering

966
01:01:54,289 --> 01:01:57,454
if your death, too,
was on your terms.

967
01:02:11,258 --> 01:02:12,438
<i>I am sorry.</i>

968
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:14,489
I must have...

969
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:37,317
She was dying, Jethro.

970
01:02:38,758 --> 01:02:42,131
<i>She knew the deterioration</i>
would have been rapid.

971
01:02:42,767 --> 01:02:45,250
Debilitating pain, loss of motor skills.

972
01:02:46,325 --> 01:02:48,519
<i>As difficult as it is to say,</i>

973
01:02:48,771 --> 01:02:50,914
this may have been more merciful.

974
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:10,590
Naval Criminal...

975
01:03:12,303 --> 01:03:15,348
I spoke with you earlier. You were
supposed to send me four security tapes.

976
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:17,645
You only sent me three. Thank you.

977
01:03:19,077 --> 01:03:21,816
- I hate airport security.
<i>- Makes two of us.</i>

978
01:03:26,738 --> 01:03:27,855
Rough flight?

979
01:03:37,935 --> 01:03:39,776
I saw you two went swimming.

980
01:03:46,187 --> 01:03:47,637
What are you saying?

981
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:52,440
I was... saying I...

982
01:03:53,075 --> 01:03:55,221
saw that picture of Ziva at the pool.

983
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:00,318
Say it.

984
01:04:01,407 --> 01:04:03,496
- Say what?
- I screwed up.

985
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:05,306
You can say it, probie.

986
01:04:06,566 --> 01:04:08,116
It was not your fault.

987
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:09,812
Thank you.

988
01:04:14,649 --> 01:04:16,399
<i>Sure, be right down, boss.</i>

989
01:04:18,642 --> 01:04:19,642
Abby's lab.

990
01:04:20,214 --> 01:04:23,466
<i>I've barely had a chance
to finish unpacking this stuff,</i>

991
01:04:23,467 --> 01:04:26,718
<i>let alone processing it.</i>
I don't have anything for you.

992
01:04:27,919 --> 01:04:29,656
- You will.
- I will.

993
01:04:29,697 --> 01:04:32,954
- And it'll be my best work.
- Always is, Abs.

994
01:04:33,509 --> 01:04:36,959
It's different this time.
<i>This time it's for the Director.</i>

995
01:04:37,149 --> 01:04:38,928
This'll be my very best work.

996
01:04:49,725 --> 01:04:51,153
I tried not to sad.

997
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:52,994
It's okay.

998
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:56,654
She was always such a snappy dresser,
you know?

999
01:04:56,655 --> 01:04:57,772
Like classy.

1000
01:04:58,364 --> 01:04:59,859
I never told her that.

1001
01:05:00,459 --> 01:05:01,962
Why didn't I tell her that?

1002
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:04,464
<i>She would have liked that.</i>
She would have smiled.

1003
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,683
We can't wait with stuff like that,

1004
01:05:06,684 --> 01:05:08,428
'cause you never know
what's gonna happen.

1005
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:11,096
I like the way you dress.

1006
01:05:11,737 --> 01:05:13,848
It's masculine and spruce.

1007
01:05:14,117 --> 01:05:15,667
<i>Always with a jacket.</i>

1008
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,382
See, even you smiled.

1009
01:05:18,882 --> 01:05:21,567
And Tony...
you're business but after-hours.

1010
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:23,461
<i>It's nice.</i>

1011
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,529
Ziva, you kick ass,
and you look so good doing it.

1012
01:05:37,144 --> 01:05:39,394
- Boss, I...
- It's not your fault.

1013
01:05:41,173 --> 01:05:44,713
- Only one thing to be concerned about.
- Finding the Director's killer.

1014
01:05:45,402 --> 01:05:46,833
Should I call Vance?

1015
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:51,259
Unanimous no.

1016
01:05:51,749 --> 01:05:54,639
- Was this a hit?
<i>- Well, it was personal, has to be.</i>

1017
01:05:54,804 --> 01:05:56,808
Why else
would she have brought along Franks?

1018
01:05:57,414 --> 01:05:59,019
She died trying to end something.

1019
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,044
Does that mean the "something"
is still happening?

1020
01:06:02,045 --> 01:06:03,852
<i>It's a good question, David.</i>

1021
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:18,330
Don't ask.

1022
01:06:23,554 --> 01:06:25,170
<i>Why wasn't I invited to the party?</i>

1023
01:06:26,644 --> 01:06:29,049
Team lost a member, Leon.
Hardly a party.

1024
01:06:31,937 --> 01:06:33,387
Did I miss anything?

1025
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:35,963
<i>Then I guess
you were on your way up to brief me</i>

1026
01:06:35,964 --> 01:06:39,114
on the only guy
that walked out of that diner alive.

1027
01:06:42,859 --> 01:06:44,409
We'll take the stairs.

1028
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,781
Tire tracks
led to a car rental company at LAX.

1029
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:55,613
<i>Mercury Marquis </i>rented to a Joe Hill.

1030
01:06:56,087 --> 01:06:57,587
<i>We're still waiting on the ID</i>

1031
01:06:58,061 --> 01:06:59,592
San Diego team working on this?

1032
01:06:59,713 --> 01:07:01,935
Nobody knows anything about Jenny.

1033
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:03,981
Don't worry, I'm sure your people

1034
01:07:03,982 --> 01:07:06,257
<i>would eventually have put together
the missing pieces.</i>

1035
01:07:08,165 --> 01:07:09,571
<i>Or have you already?</i>

1036
01:07:12,207 --> 01:07:15,857
You think you can protect them forever,
Gibbs, you're mistaken.

1037
01:07:16,085 --> 01:07:18,071
There's already been one casualty.

1038
01:07:18,382 --> 01:07:19,832
There will be more.

1039
01:07:27,968 --> 01:07:29,499
We got <i>something, boss.</i>

1040
01:07:30,127 --> 01:07:33,363
- Rest of the airport footage from TSA.
- Why are you whispering, McGee?

1041
01:07:33,485 --> 01:07:34,989
You know, I didn't want...

1042
01:07:37,173 --> 01:07:38,223
... to yell.

1043
01:07:38,418 --> 01:07:40,787
<i>Didn't want to yell.</i>
You were across the room there...

1044
01:07:41,031 --> 01:07:43,296
Right.
The footage you requested just came in.

1045
01:07:43,794 --> 01:07:44,891
Let's see it.

1046
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,741
The first three clips <i>show Viggo
Drantyev walking through the terminal,</i>

1047
01:07:50,742 --> 01:07:52,340
<i>passing up baggage claim.</i>

1048
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:55,042
<i>Pros </i>usually travel light.

1049
01:07:55,549 --> 01:07:56,790
<i>Then exits.</i>

1050
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,425
The last piece they just sent in
<i>is from outside.</i>

1051
01:07:59,426 --> 01:08:01,897
<i>That is Viggo coming
through the door right there.</i>

1052
01:08:01,898 --> 01:08:04,444
- Cab number and plate, McGee?
- On it.

1053
01:08:05,527 --> 01:08:06,527
Wait.

1054
01:08:07,577 --> 01:08:09,482
<i>Professionals </i>do not share cabs.

1055
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:12,235
Viggo wasn't traveling alone.

1056
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,730
Run it back.

1057
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:22,245
<i>You know what? Let me pull up
the photos from the funeral.</i>

1058
01:08:24,668 --> 01:08:26,618
That could be the same woman.

1059
01:08:27,056 --> 01:08:28,585
<i>Either of you recognize her?</i>

1060
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:32,289
Agent Gibbs, you...

1061
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:39,467
McGee, get him back here. Now.

1062
01:09:02,602 --> 01:09:03,652
Where is he?

1063
01:09:04,025 --> 01:09:06,378
- Who, Gibbs?
<i>- David.</i>

1064
01:09:07,385 --> 01:09:10,309
I am sorry, but I do not
have the slightest clue where...

1065
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:11,310
McGee.

1066
01:09:15,304 --> 01:09:17,962
Photo pops up,
Gibbs runs off the reservation,

1067
01:09:17,963 --> 01:09:20,887
- and nobody knows a damn thing.
- Sounds like a Wednesday.

1068
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,290
And her?

1069
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:25,481
<i>Your Director's dead.</i>

1070
01:09:25,831 --> 01:09:28,603
The Director you were assigned
to protect is dead. We'll get to that.

1071
01:09:28,725 --> 01:09:31,397
<i>But right now,
I need to know what Gibbs knows.</i>

1072
01:09:35,081 --> 01:09:36,831
Decker left a code behind,

1073
01:09:37,502 --> 01:09:39,178
some kind of insurance policy.

1074
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:41,068
It's a string of 13 numbers.

1075
01:09:41,605 --> 01:09:44,101
<i>- Don't know what they mean yet.</i>
- Find out.

1076
01:09:44,203 --> 01:09:46,768
<i>I will</i>. And when I do,
<i>you'll be the first to know.</i>

1077
01:09:46,769 --> 01:09:49,582
The second, but for now,
I'll take what I can get.

1078
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:54,886
<i>- The mystery woman.</i>
- Name. Go.

1079
01:10:03,468 --> 01:10:05,890
- McGee sent you an e-mail.
- No, I didn't get any...

1080
01:10:07,929 --> 01:10:08,935
Neat.

1081
01:10:11,321 --> 01:10:12,324
<i>Who is she?</i>

1082
01:10:12,325 --> 01:10:15,108
We wouldn't be down here
if we knew, would we?

1083
01:10:16,354 --> 01:10:19,070
- Facial recognition?
- Start with Interpol.

1084
01:10:19,223 --> 01:10:21,083
- Eastern Europe.
- What country?

1085
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:22,463
- All of them.
- That...

1086
01:10:22,464 --> 01:10:23,685
Just do it!

1087
01:10:26,023 --> 01:10:27,037
Please.

1088
01:10:33,294 --> 01:10:34,544
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

1089
01:10:36,587 --> 01:10:39,591
- Come on!
- Have you tried latitude and longitude?

1090
01:10:41,668 --> 01:10:43,428
Leads to an asparagus field in Chile.

1091
01:10:43,895 --> 01:10:47,056
<i>It's too many digits </i>for a pin number.
It's too few for a bank account.

1092
01:10:47,178 --> 01:10:48,725
Encrypted code, then?

1093
01:10:50,032 --> 01:10:52,082
I've tried letter substitution.

1094
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:54,606
I've tried frequency analysis.
Affine shift ciphers.

1095
01:10:55,404 --> 01:10:56,941
Affine shift ciphers?

1096
01:10:58,579 --> 01:11:00,528
It's kind of hard to explain.
No offense.

1097
01:11:00,994 --> 01:11:03,240
You mean it's hard to explain
why you'd waste time

1098
01:11:03,241 --> 01:11:06,367
on an affine shift without even knowing
the multiplicative inverse?

1099
01:11:08,478 --> 01:11:10,872
- I thought...
- Have you tried a transposition cipher?

1100
01:11:11,384 --> 01:11:13,249
- Not yet.
- Vigenère encryption?

1101
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:14,778
Well, I was going to.

1102
01:11:15,222 --> 01:11:16,612
So you haven't done anything?

1103
01:11:22,084 --> 01:11:23,834
You call me when you have.

1104
01:11:35,494 --> 01:11:37,444
Surprised it took you so long.

1105
01:11:38,677 --> 01:11:40,268
Thank God for Ducky.

1106
01:11:43,151 --> 01:11:45,348
You have not listened to anything
I have said.

1107
01:11:45,349 --> 01:11:47,700
Well, it's only been three years,
I'm a slow learner.

1108
01:11:49,349 --> 01:11:50,946
And a slow healer.

1109
01:11:51,673 --> 01:11:53,623
<i>You're crying over spilled...</i>

1110
01:11:53,804 --> 01:11:54,804
<i>milk.</i>

1111
01:11:55,417 --> 01:11:56,918
It's not milk that I spilled.

1112
01:11:57,645 --> 01:12:00,238
- Do not do this, Tony.
- Don't do what?

1113
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,359
Blow my protection detail?
Blow my undercover assignment?

1114
01:12:03,723 --> 01:12:05,573
<i>Those sound like apologies.</i>

1115
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:22,990
She died alone.

1116
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,270
We are all alone.

1117
01:12:26,788 --> 01:12:28,054
Thanks for that.

1118
01:12:28,735 --> 01:12:32,052
<i>I just mean that she never got married.</i>
Never had any children.

1119
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:34,288
Never even heard her talk about it.

1120
01:12:39,669 --> 01:12:40,670
Paris.

1121
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:45,691
That's when it must have happened.

1122
01:12:46,034 --> 01:12:47,344
The two of them alone

1123
01:12:47,511 --> 01:12:49,620
- in another world.
- Putting their lives

1124
01:12:49,621 --> 01:12:53,307
- in each others' hands every day.
- Not to mention the long nights.

1125
01:12:53,511 --> 01:12:54,851
It was inevitable.

1126
01:12:57,404 --> 01:12:58,896
Nothing is inevitable.

1127
01:13:39,474 --> 01:13:41,731
- I got it!
- Got what?

1128
01:13:42,597 --> 01:13:44,647
I think I figured out the code.

1129
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:46,800
<i>John Anthony Walker.</i>

1130
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:51,627
<i>He was a Navy warrant officer.</i>
He was busted in '85

1131
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:53,757
for selling encryption ciphers
<i>to the Russians.</i>

1132
01:13:53,758 --> 01:13:54,890
I know that.

1133
01:13:54,891 --> 01:13:56,179
But since I hit a dead end,

1134
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:58,715
I thought I'd look into
his NIS case file for inspiration.

1135
01:13:58,731 --> 01:14:00,291
And that is when I saw it.

1136
01:14:02,428 --> 01:14:04,545
Ciphers that Walker used
are over 20 years old.

1137
01:14:04,683 --> 01:14:06,464
Not the ciphers I saw, it was this.

1138
01:14:08,471 --> 01:14:11,078
<i>The code</i> that Decker used
was <i>not a code.</i>

1139
01:14:12,167 --> 01:14:14,180
It's an old NIS case file number.

1140
01:14:14,403 --> 01:14:16,808
I didn't make the connection,
because in the NIS days,

1141
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:18,643
<i>we used shorter file numbers.</i>

1142
01:14:18,882 --> 01:14:21,882
So Decker hid his insurance policy
in plain sight:

1143
01:14:22,508 --> 01:14:24,058
one of his old files.

1144
01:14:24,187 --> 01:14:25,981
- Pull it up.
- I can't.

1145
01:14:26,384 --> 01:14:28,778
Nothing prior to '84 in the system.
It's in storage.

1146
01:14:31,186 --> 01:14:34,248
- Annex. <i>Across the street.
- You two, </i>with me.

1147
01:14:39,047 --> 01:14:40,697
Nice work, Agent McGee.

1148
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,452
McGee! Nice work.

1149
01:14:55,475 --> 01:14:56,525
<i>Here you go.</i>

1150
01:14:57,969 --> 01:14:59,142
Knock yourself out.

1151
01:15:07,257 --> 01:15:09,068
Who was the last person to look in this?

1152
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:11,234
It'll be on the log...

1153
01:15:12,271 --> 01:15:15,491
- It was last signed out in 2001.
- Wasn't the question.

1154
01:15:17,178 --> 01:15:19,328
An old friend asked me to do a favor.

1155
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:22,081
That favor involve you
leaving to take a leak?

1156
01:15:24,581 --> 01:15:26,890
- When?
- About an hour ago.

1157
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:29,662
- Name.
- It was just a look, okay?

1158
01:15:31,233 --> 01:15:32,383
Let me guess.

1159
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:35,401
Special Agent Gibbs?

1160
01:15:37,762 --> 01:15:38,941
Mike Franks.

1161
01:15:45,964 --> 01:15:47,214
Go take a leak.

1162
01:15:47,523 --> 01:15:48,523
<i>Sure thing.</i>

1163
01:15:50,869 --> 01:15:52,906
Did you know Mike Franks
was involved in this?

1164
01:15:52,972 --> 01:15:53,972
- No.
- Yes.

1165
01:15:54,627 --> 01:15:57,262
<i>You want to take a moment</i>
and get your stories straight?

1166
01:15:57,408 --> 01:15:58,494
- Yes.
- No.

1167
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:03,813
That explains how
Director Shepard got out to the diner.

1168
01:16:05,376 --> 01:16:08,448
- Franks was the fifth shooter.
- On Jenny's side.

1169
01:16:09,404 --> 01:16:10,888
Whose side are you on?

1170
01:16:11,007 --> 01:16:11,842
Gibbs!

1171
01:16:11,952 --> 01:16:14,252
You finally got your stories straight.

1172
01:16:14,763 --> 01:16:15,927
So where's Franks?

1173
01:16:16,665 --> 01:16:18,899
<i>Maybe... </i>on his way to Mexico.

1174
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:20,242
Why?

1175
01:16:20,485 --> 01:16:21,485
Honor.

1176
01:16:22,183 --> 01:16:24,624
He fulfills his debt
to Director Shepard.

1177
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:26,446
He disappears with the file.

1178
01:16:26,447 --> 01:16:27,488
It ends.

1179
01:16:28,356 --> 01:16:30,240
BOLO, stop him at the border.

1180
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,240
- <i>Found her.
- We're on the way.</i>

1181
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:42,406
<i>Her name is Natasha Lenkov,
citizen </i>of Uzbekistan.

1182
01:16:42,814 --> 01:16:44,664
Came out of nowhere in 1999.

1183
01:16:44,786 --> 01:16:47,787
<i>Built up a very successful
import</i>-export business.

1184
01:16:47,788 --> 01:16:49,588
- And before '99?
<i>- Didn't exist.</i>

1185
01:16:49,589 --> 01:16:51,655
- No earlier records.
- Completely blank.

1186
01:16:51,656 --> 01:16:52,710
<i>Not a thing.</i>

1187
01:16:52,758 --> 01:16:55,508
Whoever our mystery woman was back then,
she is now Natasha Lenkov.

1188
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:58,594
Gibbs saw the photo, recognized her,
and he's gone to find her.

1189
01:16:58,877 --> 01:17:00,346
<i>Tying up a loose end maybe.</i>

1190
01:17:00,667 --> 01:17:03,641
- But how would he know how to find her?
- Maybe he's going to call her.

1191
01:17:03,763 --> 01:17:05,713
Maybe Gibbs has an old number.

1192
01:17:06,472 --> 01:17:08,522
No, he's not going to call her,

1193
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:11,460
he doesn't have to.
She's going to call him.

1194
01:17:11,767 --> 01:17:13,629
- Viggo's cell phone.
- Here.

1195
01:17:14,173 --> 01:17:16,869
Photographed, tagged, logged and...

1196
01:17:18,694 --> 01:17:19,944
... and missing.

1197
01:17:33,022 --> 01:17:36,101
<i>Think of a reason why I shouldn't
personally throw the book at you</i>

1198
01:17:36,102 --> 01:17:39,052
- for hindering a federal inquiry?
- 'Cause you want this <i>to go away.</i>

1199
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:41,031
Where the hell are you?

1200
01:17:41,544 --> 01:17:43,180
- Not far.
- <i>Franks with you?</i>

1201
01:17:45,418 --> 01:17:46,568
Should he be?

1202
01:17:46,889 --> 01:17:50,521
If not, then he's on his way to Mexico
with <i>Decker's insurance policy.</i>

1203
01:17:50,889 --> 01:17:51,965
Don't smile.

1204
01:17:53,652 --> 01:17:55,402
Natasha Lenkov, real name?

1205
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:58,049
Svetlana <i>Chernitskaya.</i>

1206
01:18:01,442 --> 01:18:02,442
And?

1207
01:18:06,639 --> 01:18:09,457
- I'm going to have to put you on hold.
- <i>The hell you do...</i>

1208
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:14,660
What are you hearing?

1209
01:18:18,138 --> 01:18:19,288
Russian Polka.

1214
01:18:30,327 --> 01:18:32,785
Dead. I need you to come see me.

1215
01:18:33,277 --> 01:18:35,828
- <i>Who is this?!</i>
- Mr. Oshimaida.

1216
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:41,011
- Trace it.
<i>- Got a hit on </i>Svetlana Chernitskaya.

1217
01:18:41,397 --> 01:18:42,907
<i>"Hit" being the operative word.</i>

1218
01:18:43,029 --> 01:18:45,508
She was the handler for Anatoly Zukov,

1219
01:18:45,509 --> 01:18:48,598
<i>a KGB hit man who started selling
his services to the highest bidder</i>

1220
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:50,998
<i>after the Cold War </i>ended.
Anatoly disappeared in 1999.

1221
01:18:51,832 --> 01:18:52,638
Boss.

1222
01:18:54,341 --> 01:18:55,341
Sir.

1223
01:18:55,692 --> 01:18:59,131
<i>Got a trace on that cell phone.</i>
It's the South Side, narrowing it down.

1224
01:18:59,476 --> 01:19:01,317
All right, we got the street and...

1225
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:02,486
number.

1226
01:19:07,051 --> 01:19:07,876
Delete it.

1227
01:19:13,351 --> 01:19:14,897
- You want us to...
<i>- Stay.</i>

1228
01:19:22,339 --> 01:19:24,780
- Status, McGee.
- Gibbs out there.

1229
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,068
Vance out there. Natasha out there.

1230
01:19:27,132 --> 01:19:28,132
Us here.

1231
01:19:28,157 --> 01:19:31,107
- What are we doing?
- Waiting for the fireworks.

1232
01:19:39,152 --> 01:19:40,559
<i>Hello, </i>Natasha.

1233
01:19:42,826 --> 01:19:44,833
Or do you prefer Svetlana?

1234
01:19:50,176 --> 01:19:52,226
Not business, this is personal.

1235
01:19:54,442 --> 01:19:56,355
It was you who killed Anatoly.

1236
01:20:00,736 --> 01:20:02,186
What was he to you?

1237
01:20:04,212 --> 01:20:05,212
Everything.

1238
01:20:06,345 --> 01:20:07,345
Why now?

1239
01:20:08,193 --> 01:20:10,743
<i>Because it</i> took me until now
to find you.

1240
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:13,539
<i>The night he died,</i>
a woman came to kill you.

1241
01:20:13,849 --> 01:20:14,999
<i>What happened?</i>

1242
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:17,580
She couldn't do it.

1243
01:20:24,469 --> 01:20:25,469
Can you?

1244
01:20:44,846 --> 01:20:47,823
You were going to go for that,
<i>weren't you, probie?</i>

1245
01:20:50,714 --> 01:20:52,364
<i>So Jenny couldn't do it?</i>

1246
01:20:52,867 --> 01:20:54,575
Girl was an artist with the steel.

1247
01:20:55,131 --> 01:20:57,450
<i>- Not back then.</i>
- What changed?

1248
01:20:57,924 --> 01:21:00,103
- Me.
<i>- She made her own choices.</i>

1249
01:21:03,197 --> 01:21:05,047
I taught her how to accept.

1250
01:21:05,893 --> 01:21:07,468
None of that came natural to her.

1251
01:21:09,354 --> 01:21:10,804
Girl cared for you.

1252
01:21:11,379 --> 01:21:12,807
Had a lot of regrets.

1253
01:21:13,841 --> 01:21:14,841
We all do.

1254
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:19,694
They're going to have your ass
when they find her body.

1255
01:21:21,187 --> 01:21:23,437
They're not going to find her body.

1256
01:21:44,003 --> 01:21:45,381
Little late for a stroll.

1257
01:21:50,716 --> 01:21:52,179
Is that what I think it is?

1258
01:21:52,748 --> 01:21:54,098
It was sanctioned.

1259
01:21:54,691 --> 01:21:55,974
Nine years ago.

1260
01:21:58,637 --> 01:21:59,687
Your point?

1261
01:22:00,378 --> 01:22:02,439
Decker's insurance policy, what's in it?

1262
01:22:03,015 --> 01:22:04,965
You can read it for yourself.

1263
01:22:04,966 --> 01:22:06,402
I'll leave it for you

1264
01:22:06,994 --> 01:22:08,028
in my will.

1265
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:14,848
<i>This has been one big screw-up</i>
from start to finish.

1266
01:22:26,335 --> 01:22:27,885
What do I tell SecNav?

1267
01:22:32,221 --> 01:22:33,571
Whatever you want.

1268
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:42,221
<i>These pictures are coming live to us
from our ZNN team here in Georgetown.</i>

1269
01:22:42,222 --> 01:22:44,611
<i>The fire is believed to be
at the home of the Director</i>

1270
01:22:44,735 --> 01:22:46,993
<i> of a federal agency here in Washington.</i>

1271
01:22:46,994 --> 01:22:48,855
<i>The alarm was raised by a passerby</i>

1272
01:22:48,856 --> 01:22:52,383
<i>who heard an explosion and saw smoke
billowing from a downstairs window...</i>

1273
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:54,110
<i>By the time the fire trucks arrived,</i>

1274
01:22:54,111 --> 01:22:56,379
<i>the townhouse was fully
engulfed in flames.</i>

1275
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:58,780
<i>There has been no word yet
if anyone was inside the house</i>

1276
01:22:58,781 --> 01:23:00,602
<i>at the time the fire started.</i>

1277
01:23:00,603 --> 01:23:02,653
<i>Fire officials are confident...</i>

1278
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:12,862
What's the story circulating on Natasha?

1279
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:15,279
Heard she pulled a Roman Holiday.
Ran off with her lover.

1280
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,876
- Viggo Drantyev.
<i>- Shotgun wedding.</i>

1281
01:23:18,523 --> 01:23:22,227
<i>The funeral was held this morning
for NCIS Director Jenny Shepard,</i>

1282
01:23:22,444 --> 01:23:24,936
<i>who died when her Georgetown home
was destroyed by fire...</i>

1283
01:23:24,937 --> 01:23:27,750
I find this whole business
utterly distasteful.

1284
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,569
<i>... when leaking gas
was ignited by a pilot light.</i>

1285
01:23:30,691 --> 01:23:34,438
<i>Official autopsy report found Director
Shepard died of smoke inhalation.</i>

1286
01:23:34,556 --> 01:23:37,370
<i>At today's private memorial service,
one mourner, </i>

1287
01:23:37,371 --> 01:23:39,853
<i>who declined to give his name,
said Director Shepard</i>

1288
01:23:39,854 --> 01:23:41,914
<i>had dedicated her life
to serving her country,</i>

1289
01:23:42,113 --> 01:23:45,834
<i>and would be remembered for her courage,
determination and loyalty.</i>

1290
01:23:45,956 --> 01:23:49,213
<i>Assistant Director Leon Vance
has been named to succeed her.</i>

1291
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:19,618
Could you have Gibbs, DiNozzo,
McGee and David come up, please?

1292
01:24:19,823 --> 01:24:21,373
<i>Right away, Director.</i>

1293
01:24:36,236 --> 01:24:37,386
Bad few days.

1294
01:24:42,793 --> 01:24:43,931
Officer David.

1295
01:24:45,261 --> 01:24:48,502
<i>The liaison position</i> with NCIS
is being terminated.

1296
01:24:49,982 --> 01:24:51,332
<i>You're going home.</i>

1297
01:24:55,533 --> 01:24:56,547
McGee.

1298
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,742
I'm moving you across
to the Cyber Crimes Unit.

1299
01:25:00,104 --> 01:25:02,995
<i>You'll be working with Officer
Hollsworth, starting tomorrow.</i>

1300
01:25:05,844 --> 01:25:07,932
- Sir?
- You've been reassigned.

1301
01:25:08,706 --> 01:25:11,513
<i>Agent Afloat, USS Ronald Reagan.</i>

1302
01:25:12,004 --> 01:25:13,922
Pack your bags,
you fly out tomorrow.

1303
01:25:14,962 --> 01:25:16,290
<i>Agent Gibbs.</i>

1304
01:25:22,739 --> 01:25:24,189
Meet your new team.
