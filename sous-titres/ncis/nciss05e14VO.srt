00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,162
Housekeeping, Tony.

3
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:16,191
Well, keep it to a dull roar, will you?
I got a hot beverage here.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,923
Keep it over there... please.

5
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:19,839
Backing up three years of case files.

6
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:22,196
The bulk of our lives
is in these cables right now,

7
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:24,441
flying back and forth
in zeroes and ones.

8
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:27,723
You do understand that I'm the ones,
and you're the zeroes.

9
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,147
Meadowlark Lemon.

10
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:37,350
<i>- Harlem Globetrotters.
- What?</i>

11
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:44,776
Look at all this.

12
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:48,369
Hey, careful with the liquids.
Please, I told you it's very sensitive.

13
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:50,500
Well, so am I, McZero.

14
00:00:50,823 --> 00:00:52,668
What, you think I'm a complete klutz?

15
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:54,838
- No, no, no, no!
- I might spill my...

16
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,442
Curly Neal. That worked.

17
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,136
<i>Yeah. How about the phones?</i>
They work? I've been calling.

18
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:06,622
Actually, they do not.

19
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:08,267
No, no, no.

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,615
<i>No! No, no, no, no!</i>

21
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:13,174
Well, the unit's getting power,

22
00:01:13,425 --> 00:01:16,340
<i>but the line tone's gone.
Must be a problem with the router.</i>

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,812
<i>It's not my fault.</i>

24
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:19,054
<i>I didn't do this.</i>

25
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:19,915
Freeze.

26
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,269
No need for that.

27
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:22,324
Tobias.

28
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:24,396
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- It's a shutdown, Gibbs.

29
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:27,766
<i>Few months ago,
they pulled a body out of the bay.</i>

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,804
<i>P.D.'s had him on ice while</i>
they were tracking down a DNA match.

31
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,307
Yeah? <i>And?</i>

32
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:35,214
Body's been positively
identified as Rene Benoit.

33
00:01:35,854 --> 00:01:36,866
La Grenouille.

34
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:38,584
He's dead?

35
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:41,275
Murdered.

36
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:44,731

42
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,158
This is ridiculous.

43
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,475
We're prisoners in our own
evidence lock-up.

44
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,162
We're not prisoners.

45
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,162
We're evidence, so we're locked up.

46
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:30,199
Well, why are we being guarded then?
I mean, we are being guarded, right?

47
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,821
You are being very guarded about

48
00:02:31,822 --> 00:02:33,355
whether or not we are being guarded.

49
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,549
Abby, relax.
I'm sure you're not a suspect.

50
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,464
Well, then, who is their suspect?

51
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,451
The FBI is not ready

52
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,621
to walk anyone out in handcuffs.

53
00:02:41,743 --> 00:02:43,339
They're trying to keep it quiet.

54
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:45,575
They don't even know
what they're looking for.

55
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:48,517
So what? We're supposed to just
hand them their first clue?

56
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:51,031
<i>Not us.</i> Gibbs.

57
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:53,466
<i>How did you land this job</i>, Tobias?

58
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:56,930
Intimate knowledge of the case
history made me the obvious choice.

59
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,854
And your personal relationships
with the people involved?

60
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:01,663
Not gonna be a problem.

61
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:04,332
Evidence led to somebody
in this building.

62
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:06,860
What evidence?

63
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:13,617
Other side.

64
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:29,471
Sir?

65
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,037
<i>I don't drink coffee.</i>

66
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,421
Don't seem too shocked.
Grenouille is dead.

67
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:46,599
- Knew it wasn't over.
- Hoped it was?

68
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:52,260
We have determined that you
and your team had significant contact

69
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:53,273
with Grenouille

70
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:54,595
on the day he died.

71
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:57,807
<i>That morning, there was
an earlier attempt on his life.</i>

72
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,578
He wasn't the target.
His daughter was.

73
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:04,752
Somebody was taking things personally.

74
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:08,451
You ever figure out
who that somebody was?

75
00:04:09,094 --> 00:04:10,099
No.

76
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:15,433
Final entry in your
official report has you,

77
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:19,466
McGee and David raiding a yacht where
Grenouille was thought to be staying.

78
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:22,498
- Yeah, we just missed him.
- Did you?

79
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:27,128
<i>'Cause the time of death</i>
roughly coincides with your visit.

80
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:33,409
Ziva, McGee, and I were
here all night securing a warrant.

81
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,048
I'm sure their reports
will verify the timeline.

82
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:40,678
Is it my alibi you're after, Tobias?

83
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,885
Before that,
I was at the Director's house.

84
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,462
With Jenny Shepard?

85
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,795
And the deceased?

86
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:57,611
Her phone records put them
in contact the night he died.

87
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,841
Were you part of their little chat?

88
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:02,134
<i>So here we are at last.</i>

89
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:04,023
<i>Face to face.</i>

90
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:07,131
<i>You believe the story
that my father took a bribe?</i>

91
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:09,219
<i>Sorry, that's not a story,
that's a fact.</i>

92
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:10,697
<i>Because I paid him.</i>

93
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:12,522
<i>No.</i>

94
00:05:13,837 --> 00:05:15,156
<i>You killed him.</i>

95
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:17,821
He left.

96
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,852
- I left.
- Come on, Jethro.

97
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:23,679
Can't be that simple.

98
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,710
What the hell were you all doing there?

99
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:28,313
- He wanted protection.
- Maybe you should have provided it.

100
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:32,626
Are you protecting anybody now?

101
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:38,020
<i>I have been trying for
a decade to bring him down.</i>

102
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,525
<i>What did he do to you, Jenny?</i>

103
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:46,256
It's not my alibi you're after.

104
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,901
Can you account for the director's
where abouts and actions

105
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:52,264
after you left her residence that night?

106
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:53,750
<i>No.</i>

107
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:55,470
<i>You killed him.</i>

108
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:56,895
<i>It's not loaded.</i>

109
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,491
<i>If the weapon was loaded and I wasn't
here, would you have pulled the trigger?</i>

110
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:03,211
<i>I guess we'll never know.</i>

111
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:08,359
You're going to accuse
the Director of NCIS of murder,

112
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,082
that evidence better be damn good.

113
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:11,936
Do you think I'd be here if it weren't?

114
00:06:13,275 --> 00:06:14,287
<i>We both know</i>

115
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:17,356
that her connection to Grenouille had
nothing to do with the job. Never did.

116
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,621
This might have been her mess to begin,
but she spread it all over this place.

117
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:24,008
When this is done, and she's cleared,

118
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,005
I want to see that file.

119
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,355
When this is done, if she's cleared...

120
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:34,374
... I just might let you.

121
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:40,083
<i>Take him back down.</i>

122
00:06:57,957 --> 00:06:59,812
Long way from San Diego, Leon.

123
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:02,108
SecNav felt this warranted
a plane ticket.

124
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,316
You're interrogating my agents?

125
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,187
I assume you have a suspect.

126
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,861
And you've been brought in to oversee.

127
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:18,763
<i>Well, Assistant Director Vance,</i>

128
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:20,763
you gonna ask for 'em?

129
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:38,429
Under the authority
of the Secretary of the Navy,

130
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:40,781
as Acting Director of NCIS,

131
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,330
I hereby relieve you of your duties.

132
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:46,376
I'm sorry, Jenny, you're suspended.

133
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:01,982
Hello, Leon.

134
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:03,026
Gibbs.

135
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:09,767
<i>$2.42.</i>

136
00:08:10,147 --> 00:08:11,615
It's for the cheese Danish.

137
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:13,153
That was eight years ago.

138
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,040
Nine.

139
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:18,279
Are you the one responsible
for this fishing expedition?

140
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:20,002
The Bureau's doing the fishing.

141
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:21,508
I'm just driving the boat.

142
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,251
Keep it off the rocks.

143
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:33,868
What do I say?

144
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:35,775
The truth, McGee.

145
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:37,577
You haven't done anything wrong.

146
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,898
<i>It's a get-out-of-jail-free card.</i>

147
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:43,163
<i>You're going to hack into the CIA.</i>

148
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:46,322
<i>This is highly illegal,
and I'm not even doing it now.</i>

149
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:50,726
You look nervous, McGee.

150
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:53,040
Where's your head at?
What were you thinking about?

151
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:56,064
Nothing.

152
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:00,131
I know

153
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:04,745
you've hacked into everything
from the corner store to the CIA, McGee.

154
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:08,629
I don't care.

155
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:10,969
Jasper Shepard.

156
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:13,058
<i>Director's father.</i>

157
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:16,187
<i>She asked you to investigate</i>
the details of his suicide?

158
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:17,783
No.

159
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,060
You didn't come up with
the idea on your own, McGee.

160
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,316
Gibbs.

161
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:30,060
<i>The Director was</i>
particularly aggressive

162
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:34,192
in her pursuit of the arms dealer
La Grenouille. Agent Gibbs

163
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,565
was curious as to her motivation.

164
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:39,565
Gibbs doesn't get curious.

165
00:09:40,502 --> 00:09:42,012
He gets suspicious.

166
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:43,629
What did he suspect?

167
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:47,748
That...

168
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,355
that she believed La Grenouille
was responsible for her father's death.

169
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:55,189
Is that why she put
Agent DiNozzo undercover?

170
00:09:55,558 --> 00:09:56,877
To get close to him?

171
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:02,282
I can't speak to the nature
of Agent DiNozzo's assignment.

172
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:03,451
Why not?

173
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:06,063
You two do have

174
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:07,943
a professional relationship?

175
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:12,191
<i>McGeek... McGoo... McGiggle...
McGoogle...</i>

176
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:16,359
Yeah.

177
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:18,007
Yeah, it's...

178
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:21,718
- very professional, yeah.
- Then tell me about his assignment.

179
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:23,883
This is not the time
to be covering for your friends.

180
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:29,108
I was not privy to any of his actions,

181
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,626
<i>vis-à-vis</i> the aforementioned
undercover operation

182
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,116
<i>as previously stated.</i>

183
00:10:36,318 --> 00:10:38,297
- In perpetuity.
- Sure you were privy.

184
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:41,489
On at least one occasion,

185
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,445
you were directly involved
in his investigation.

186
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:48,898
<i>Southeastern Quebec. T.O.D. 2400.</i>

187
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:50,356
<i>Where's Grenouille?</i>

188
00:10:50,557 --> 00:10:51,562
<i>Finally...</i>

189
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:54,129
Canada?

190
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,741
What was the purpose of the mission?

191
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:01,848
Officer David...

192
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:03,981
<i>I know you're Israeli.</i>

193
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,954
I know you were trained by Mossad to...

194
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,047
We know what you do.

195
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:13,215
I would hate to be misunderstood.

196
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:14,956
Does that happen often?

197
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:16,692
Once in a blue lagoon.

198
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:19,722
I think I'll be able to translate.
I'll repeat.

199
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,362
What was the purpose
of the mission to Canada?

200
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:27,428
We received intelligence that
the subject would be in the vicinity.

201
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:31,207
Were you attempting to apprehend
this subject who is now deceased?

202
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:34,144
<i>Archangel has him covered.</i>

203
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,658
No.

204
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:39,235
Then why were you there?
What were your orders?

205
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:43,003
<i>Archangel awaiting instructions.</i>

206
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,353
You were there to kill him.

207
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:50,338
That's what you do.

208
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:52,743
I was there to ensure mission safety.

209
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:55,020
I was never given a fire order.

210
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:57,343
Only because you were called off
at the last moment.

211
00:11:57,475 --> 00:12:00,326
By a deep undercover CIA
agent named Trent Kort.

212
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:05,556
<i>- Director Shepard.
- We're about to lose target.</i>

213
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:08,398
<i>- Director...
- Stand down, Archangel. Stand down.</i>

214
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,771
Now, that must have been a shock?

215
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:15,414
To discover that Grenouille
was being handled by the CIA?

216
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,102
Regardless.

217
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:20,485
Director Shepard manufactured
the entire mission to get close to him.

218
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:21,583
Why?

219
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,176
To put a bullet in his head.

220
00:12:29,027 --> 00:12:30,782
We met only once.

221
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,420
But I was rather taken by the man.

222
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:37,389
Dredged out of Baltimore Harbor.

223
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:39,030
Dead less than two days.

224
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,990
Maryland M.E. performed the autopsy?

225
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:43,539
She's very good.

226
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:46,807
- I would like to see the body.
- No.

227
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,928
Four eyes are better than two.

228
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:51,034
No. Cause of death
wasn't much of a mystery.

229
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,738
A single gunshot wound to the head.

230
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,405
Then what do you want from me?

231
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,779
From time to time you compile

232
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:59,507
psychological profiles
on persons of interest.

233
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:03,682
Well, following my encounter
with La Grenouille,

234
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:05,669
I was asked for my opinion.

235
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,849
<i>La Grenouille is not
your ordinary arms dealer.</i>

236
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:12,028
<i>He's not the type
to settle disputes with violence.</i>

237
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:13,665
<i>You liked him, didn't you?</i>

238
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,962
<i>Perhaps it's clouding your judgment.</i>

239
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:18,836
<i>Perhaps it's not my judgment
that's being clouded.</i>

240
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:20,712
<i>Yes,</i>

241
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,532
by the Director herself.

242
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:26,266
I'd like to know your
opinion of that encounter.

243
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:30,770
Dr. Mallard?

244
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:34,483
<i>There was a history between those two.</i>

245
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:36,809
<i>Something that is consuming her.</i>

246
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,965
- <i>How far?
- Will she go? As far as it takes.</i>

247
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,082
She did

248
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,836
manifest obsessive behavior.

249
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,506
<i>He's trying to paint a picture.</i>

250
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:51,759
A comprehensive picture of her need
for retribution against La Grenouille.

251
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:54,161
He's just confirming
what he knows, Duck.

252
00:13:54,263 --> 00:13:56,199
He's holding something back.

253
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,513
Do you think

254
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:00,190
she could have done it?

255
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,108
<i>I will get him,
another time, another deal.</i>

256
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,417
<i>I will be there, and I will get him.</i>

257
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:14,266
I'm sorry, sir. You can't leave.

258
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:16,572
You know what?

259
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:18,977
You're going to have to stop me.

260
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,414
- Problem?
- If you want it to be.

261
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:27,913
I know it's always been lost
on you, Gibbs,

262
00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:30,480
- but they write the rules for a reason.
- I have rules, too.

263
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,524
So I hear.

264
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:35,369
Any reason to keep us here, Leon?

265
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,263
I'm well aware of your
relationship with Director Shepard.

266
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:43,390
Never been comfortable with intimacy
between management and staff myself.

267
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,925
Me either.

268
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:50,352
If you've been interviewed
by Agent Fornell, <i>you're free to go.</i>

269
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:52,529
<i>Just to be clear...</i>

270
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:55,604
do not investigate this case.

271
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:04,945
That guy!
<i>He just, like, puts on a fancy suit and</i>

272
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:07,169
<i>expects everyone
to do everything he says.</i>

273
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:08,742
It is a pretty nice suit.

274
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:10,494
Come on, let's go. Work to do.

275
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:11,922
On what?

276
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:14,187
We can't investigate the FBI's case.

277
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,888
We investigate the FBI.

278
00:15:26,618 --> 00:15:30,260
Boss... Ziva's shaking the FBI tail car.
<i>Got 'em running into circles.</i>

279
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:33,332
Good. When she gets here, she can
help you hack into Fornell's computer.

280
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:36,553
I'm going to need to go to a public
site. They've quarantined all my...

281
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:41,455
Here, use mine.

282
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:44,501
But this doesn't have
a wireless signal, though.

283
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,824
- I'll figure it out.
- Duck.

284
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:53,403
Your friend
in the Maryland M.E.'s office.

285
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:54,509
Dr. Hampton?

286
00:15:54,618 --> 00:15:56,063
Need that autopsy report.

287
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,835
- I'll have to be charming.
- Don't strain yourself.

288
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:00,952
Go out the back, through the hedge.

289
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,142
It's all very exciting, isn't it?
Like a cat and mouse game.

290
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:06,855
Reminds me of...

291
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:10,292
... a part of my life that
I will share with you later.

292
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:11,696
<i>Boss.</i>

293
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:14,257
I may be able to hook up my phone
and piggyback the signal.

294
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:16,909
But I'm going to need an I.D.
to get access to the FBI main...

295
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:17,774
frame.

296
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:19,631
Questions?

297
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:22,279
Yeah, how do you get the boat out?

298
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,769
Just break the bottle.

299
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,943
You wouldn't be breaking the chain
of evidence, now, would you, Abby?

300
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:42,403
On the Portman file?

301
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:44,617
Doubt it.
He died in prison two years ago.

302
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,204
Let me know if you've got something
to eat in there, 'cause I'm starving.

303
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:49,287
How starving?

304
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:55,266
<i>Klowny Kakes.</i>

305
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:56,974
<i>Tarot cards.</i>

306
00:16:57,068 --> 00:16:58,493
<i>Want to see what happens next?</i>

307
00:16:58,537 --> 00:17:01,218
I am dying with anticipation.

308
00:17:05,516 --> 00:17:06,697
Tony!

309
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,573
We're about to summon
the elusive elements of the cosmos.

310
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:11,966
Concentrate.

311
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:14,500
I'm with you. Call the spirits.

312
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:16,189
Tell them to bring pizza.

313
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:25,721
Not yet, DiNozzo.

314
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,123
Gibbs gave you a mission.

315
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:32,504
Everybody's counting on you.

316
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:34,698
Just do what you do best.

317
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,849
- Dance?
- Talk.

318
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:40,147
<i>Ms. Sciuto.</i>

319
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:13,031
Mighty generous.

320
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:17,593
I've gone over your results
with regard to the case in question.

321
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:19,957
There's a problem with
your theory of the crime.

322
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:21,362
<i>A big hole.</i>

323
00:18:21,674 --> 00:18:23,409
I could drive a truck through it. Well,

324
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:26,056
I may not be able to drive
a truck through it,

325
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:29,981
<i>'cause never that great with the double</i>
clutch, but a truck driver could just...

326
00:18:33,704 --> 00:18:35,803
- Care to share?
- Well, it's obvious.

327
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,039
I mean, you think
there's a murder here,

328
00:18:38,103 --> 00:18:39,748
like, right underneath Gibbs' nose.

329
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,261
<i>That whatever took place,</i>
took place without Gibbs knowing.

330
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:44,019
And that could never happen?

331
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,211
I'm going to share a secret with you.

332
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:49,411
<i>It's a theory I've been working on.</i>

333
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:50,845
Off the books.

334
00:18:57,643 --> 00:18:59,282
<i>Okay...</i> the man

335
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:01,214
is magic.

336
00:19:01,331 --> 00:19:02,339
Like dark magic.

337
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:05,240
<i>He has eyes and ears everywhere.</i>

338
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:07,082
He appears like a

339
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,469
mist.

340
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,219
Whenever I get a clue, he just...

341
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:12,598
materializes.

342
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,408
Maybe he bugged your lab.

343
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:16,540
No.

344
00:19:17,693 --> 00:19:18,703
I checked.

345
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,774
What's that like?
It sounds aggravating.

346
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,049
No.

347
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:26,797
Does he ever get angry?

348
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:29,930
<i>Snap... Snap.</i>

349
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,001
Never.

350
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:34,947
He only uses his powers for good.

351
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,100
Well,

352
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:42,391
- sounds like you're a fan.
- No crime like this could

353
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:44,616
<i>ever take place under Gibbs' nose.</i>

354
00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:46,085
He wouldn't allow it.

355
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:48,093
I understand. If we could just get back.

356
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:50,184
No, I don't think you do understand.
Okay,

357
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,027
<i>one night I was in my lab.</i>
It was dark and stormy...

358
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:54,977
<i>Stop.</i>

359
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:57,974
Okay, go a smidge to your left.

360
00:19:58,576 --> 00:20:00,805
Right, a smidge to your right.
Back to your right.

361
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:03,631
There it is, there it is. Stop.

362
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:05,908
Are you serious, McGee?

363
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:08,515
Hold that position.
I've just barely got a signal here.

364
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,026
This going to work?

365
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:13,200
This thing's so ancient, it doesn't
even have the protocols modern

366
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:15,315
day security systems defend against.

367
00:20:16,189 --> 00:20:18,508
It's bringing back memories
of playing Zork.

368
00:20:18,572 --> 00:20:21,364
I'm tempted to tell it
to go throw the crystal orb.

369
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,329
Here we go.

370
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:27,162
Whoa, what's that?

371
00:20:27,437 --> 00:20:28,900
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

372
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:33,434
It's a link.
<i>Indicates an eyewitness statement.</i>

373
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:36,150
Hasn't been digitized. Doubt
we could play it even if it had been.

374
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,321
Witness' name?

375
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:38,623
<i>Just an address.</i>

376
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:41,150
We need to know what this witness knows.

377
00:20:41,477 --> 00:20:43,039
My arms are killing me.

378
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:51,776
The FBI car out front.

379
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:54,003
Got it.

380
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:58,936
Their tires, <i>not their throats.</i>

381
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:04,168
Hey, boss, if you've got a printer,

382
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:07,739
I might be able to convert some of these
crime scene sketches to dot matrix.

383
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,976
This is going nowhere.

384
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:28,131
I've never been entirely
certain she's all there.

385
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,039
<i>Hey, I remembered something.</i>

386
00:21:35,014 --> 00:21:36,928
<i>Something relevant, Ms. Sciuto?</i>

387
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:42,616
<i>Director Shepard,</i>

388
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:46,055
<i>she asked me personally
to do some forensic work for her.</i>

389
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:50,578
<i>I want to know whose
fingerprints are on these.</i>

390
00:21:51,884 --> 00:21:53,331
<i>Which is, strange.</i>

391
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:57,583
<i>I determined that there was a dead
man's fingerprints on a liquor bottle</i>

392
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,391
that was left in her study.

393
00:22:03,231 --> 00:22:06,143
<i>The Director's father supposedly
killed himself years ago,</i>

394
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:08,749
<i>so I guess that doesn't
really help your case, but,</i>

395
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:12,727
<i>they made it seem like somebody
was trying mess with her head, you know?</i>

396
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:16,476
<i>Like the CIA maybe trying to frame her.</i>

397
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:20,367
She's a lot smarter than you
give her credit for, Agent Fornell.

398
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:22,764
<i>Guys? Hello?</i>

399
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:48,152
NCIS.

400
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:53,122
Buy you a cup of coffee, Miss Benoit?

401
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,050
<i>I had hoped, Rene,</i>

402
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:05,770
<i>that you and I would meet again
in person,</i>

403
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,472
enjoy a glass of
"L'Esprit de Courvoisier"

404
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,684
which you so generously gave me.

405
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:13,531
This is the best I can do.

406
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,542
<i>A confession:</i>
I am actually a medical examiner.

407
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:19,523
And your untimely death

408
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:22,431
left questions
which only you can answer.

409
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:23,712
To wit:

410
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:25,932
stippling patterns,

411
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:28,599
<i>powder burns on your forehead,</i>

412
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:31,819
which, though diminished
by immersion in saltwater,

413
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:35,447
indicate a contact wound at close range.

414
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:37,117
No...

415
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,374
defensive wounds, so

416
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:43,450
for some reason,
a cautious man like yourself

417
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,293
allowed an armed assailant
to get extraordinarily close...

418
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:51,962
or else the gunshot
wound was self-inflicted.

419
00:23:52,282 --> 00:23:53,477
My colleague

420
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:55,918
came to the same conclusion.

421
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:59,539
The bullet entered the frontal
bone just above the left orbit,

422
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:01,629
<i>traveled in an upward trajectory</i>

423
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,597
consistent with a left-handed suicide.

424
00:24:05,136 --> 00:24:05,966
Ducky?

425
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,889
Did you say something to me?

426
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:09,308
No, I didn't.

427
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:12,648
Well, I could have sworn
I heard you talking down here.

428
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:15,448
I'm gonna come back when you're done.

429
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:20,583
The FBI's convinced you were murdered,

430
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:22,497
but you didn't tell them that, did you?

431
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:26,342
<i>Well, you were never an easy man</i>
to understand in life.

432
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:29,591
Why should your death be any different?

433
00:24:30,892 --> 00:24:34,360
I do wish you'd shed
some light on this mystery.

434
00:24:34,877 --> 00:24:36,859
Because the prime suspect

435
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,792
is a mutual acquaintance of ours.

436
00:24:49,124 --> 00:24:50,741
That's a start.

437
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:54,887
They're expecting me at your office,
Agent Gibbs.

438
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,689
Well, their questions aren't mine.

439
00:24:57,814 --> 00:24:59,155
Questions about Tony?

440
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:02,556
No, questions about your father.

441
00:25:06,153 --> 00:25:09,046
<i>Well, we've been here before,
haven't we, Toby.</i>

442
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:11,878
You were saying some pretty
bad stuff about me back then.

443
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:15,473
<i>I hope you've learned a few things
since then.</i> I know I have.

444
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,079
Yeah.

445
00:25:19,363 --> 00:25:20,852
You've done some growing, DiNozzo.

446
00:25:20,942 --> 00:25:24,010
The Director thought enough
of you to personally select you for

447
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,964
an extended undercover assignment.

448
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,983
Yep, she played matchmaker.

449
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,699
How did you get so close
to La Grenouille's daughter?

450
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,320
I see where you're going with this.

451
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,791
You'd like to know a few pick-up tricks?

452
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:40,479
I wish I could tell you, but

453
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,527
kind of a family secret
and I took an oath. Sorry. Chip?

454
00:25:46,238 --> 00:25:47,047
No.

455
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,099
So you reported back
to the Director about the girl?

456
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,385
Jeanne? Yes, well, her father
was an international arms dealer,

457
00:25:54,496 --> 00:25:57,560
a threat to the country,
the world, really.

458
00:25:57,706 --> 00:25:59,718
So, yeah, I did what I was told.

459
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:04,529
The Director ordered
you to sleep with her?

460
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,138
<i>Are you attracted to her?</i>

461
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:09,415
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>So what's the problem?</i>

462
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:14,981
- I wouldn't call it an order.
- So you didn't have any problem

463
00:26:14,982 --> 00:26:17,078
developing that kind
of a relationship with her?

464
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:20,255
- No, not at all.
- But you developed feelings for her.

465
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:22,723
That wasn't very professional, Tony.
How'd that happen?

466
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:24,134
Gradually.

467
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:33,063
And then all of a sudden...

468
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:38,978
The Director tell you
to break the girl's heart?

469
00:26:39,924 --> 00:26:41,312
<i>What'd that feel like?</i>

470
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:46,452
This is more like a therapy
session than an interrogation.

471
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:49,449
Why are you so interested
in my feelings?

472
00:26:49,513 --> 00:26:51,013
Because you had them.

473
00:26:55,873 --> 00:26:57,852
So strange being back in the city.

474
00:26:58,987 --> 00:27:01,231
I volunteered for a fellowship in Gabon.

475
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:02,688
Africa?

476
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,481
That's a big change of scenery.

477
00:27:05,544 --> 00:27:08,246
I rode a canoe
to the hospital every day.

478
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:11,539
My commute consisted of avoiding hippos.

479
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,795
Did it help?

480
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:14,883
I like to think it helped some people.

481
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:19,436
But no, I couldn't get
what happened out of my head.

482
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:23,128
Whatever you told the FBI, they're
convinced your father was murdered.

483
00:27:24,594 --> 00:27:25,615
He was.

484
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,783
How can you be so sure of that?

485
00:27:31,212 --> 00:27:32,382
I thought you knew...

486
00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:35,233
... what I saw that night.

487
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:36,865
What'd you see?

488
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:45,306
Duck.

489
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:48,739
I only let Jethro call me that, Ziva.

490
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,072
I think she means "doc", Ducky.

491
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:55,472
<i>Okay, La Grenouille's yacht.</i>

492
00:27:55,732 --> 00:27:58,798
Single shell casing was found
on the deck. No blood splatter.

493
00:27:58,838 --> 00:28:02,436
Le Grenouille must have
been standing by the railing.

494
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,722
Okay, I'm La Grenouille.

495
00:28:06,157 --> 00:28:07,054
Bang.

496
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,348
Overboard, gun goes with me.

497
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:11,265
Nine-mil'shell casing lands there.

498
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,109
<i>Or...</i>

499
00:28:14,382 --> 00:28:15,404
... someone

500
00:28:16,787 --> 00:28:18,701
approaches you with the nine.

501
00:28:20,377 --> 00:28:21,558
Facing you.

502
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:24,323
Someone you know.

503
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:29,251
And I stand here and
let you shoot me in the head?

504
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:32,100
I don't flinch, don't turn my head?

505
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:34,588
The gun is concealed.

506
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:36,035
Your guard is down.

507
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:39,859
Still, when you bring the gun up.

508
00:28:39,947 --> 00:28:42,239
I'm on boat.
Why don't I just jump overboard?

509
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:46,143
Why do I let you shoot me in the head?

510
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:51,847
Jeanne must be going through hell.

511
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:53,602
I didn't mean to hurt her.

512
00:28:53,623 --> 00:28:56,243
What other option was there?
She was in love with you too, right?

513
00:28:56,297 --> 00:28:57,712
I don't know.

514
00:28:57,877 --> 00:28:59,271
<i>Come on, Tony.</i>

515
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,371
You're a better liar than that.

516
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:04,161
<i>I love you, Jeanne.</i>

517
00:29:09,411 --> 00:29:12,199
Well, you're right,
Agent Fornell, I'm lying.

518
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:16,208
Everything I did with her was a lie.
<i>Just recalling those lies,</i>

519
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:18,229
I believe that I'm lying now.

520
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:19,508
It's a,

521
00:29:20,077 --> 00:29:22,915
it's a cacophony of lies, really.
Are you getting all this?!

522
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:25,887
<i>'Cause it's good stuff!</i>

523
00:29:30,946 --> 00:29:33,542
Yeah, she was in love with me.

524
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:37,658
We were in love.

525
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:40,764
What else do you want to know?

526
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:42,678
How is it supposed to end, Tony?

527
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:47,145
I mean, there was never
gonna be a happily ever after.

528
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:50,659
Earlier that morning,

529
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,334
the day her father died,

530
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:54,249
<i>Jeanne was almost killed twice.</i>

531
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,164
You barely managed to save
her from a drug dealer

532
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:02,845
when somebody tried to blow her up.

533
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,050
Yeah, I know.
Someone should figure that out.

534
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:07,334
Likely one of his enemies.

535
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:08,948
Likely. He had a lot of enemies.

536
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:11,196
<i>Any one of them could have
caught up with him on that yacht.</i>

537
00:30:11,197 --> 00:30:12,367
Through the girl?

538
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,578
<i>Jeanne was a key to her father.</i>

539
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,711
No one knew that better than you.

540
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,649
So let's talk about that night.

541
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:22,328
<i>I have to go.</i>

542
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,590
What'd you tell Fornell?

543
00:30:24,182 --> 00:30:25,691
I told him what happened.

544
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:28,729
- When?
- The night he was killed.

545
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,752
How do you know what happened?

546
00:30:30,984 --> 00:30:32,009
<i>Ziva,</i>

547
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:34,286
this mark,

548
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,133
what does it mean to you?

549
00:30:38,431 --> 00:30:39,829
Give me your hand.

550
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:45,866
<i>It's a pressure point.</i>

551
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,370
In Mossad,

552
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:53,239
we call it a "thumb tap".

553
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:55,616
David says she left you
alone in Jeanne's apartment.

554
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,136
<i>She tried to call you on the phone
the next morning, nobody answered.</i>

555
00:30:58,186 --> 00:31:00,309
Your partner did
not know where you were.

556
00:31:00,574 --> 00:31:02,944
- I went for a drive.
- Your car was blown up that morning.

557
00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:04,592
- Company car.
- Where?

558
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:08,070
I need to clear my head.

559
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,412
I wasn't plotting a course.
I was upset.

560
00:31:10,574 --> 00:31:13,066
Of course you were.
The woman you love is in danger.

561
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,392
She's running for her
life and you can't protect her.

562
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,212
- You telling me you saw who did it?
- Yes.

563
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:18,216
Who?!

564
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:22,721
<i>She'd never be safe,
not with her father around.</i>

565
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,152
She knew it, you knew it.

566
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,931
- There was only one way to save her!
- Who pulled the trigger?

567
00:31:28,939 --> 00:31:29,747
Tony.

568
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:32,491
- Bang.
- You killed La Grenouille!

569
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,138
I did what?

570
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:45,688
Jeanne Benoit saw Tony shoot her father?

571
00:31:46,629 --> 00:31:48,661
- He had motive.
- And means.

572
00:31:49,347 --> 00:31:51,304
And no alibi.

573
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:54,167
<i>He was supposed to
meet us at the bar last night.</i>

574
00:31:54,209 --> 00:31:56,422
<i>He did not arrive, did not call.</i>

575
00:31:56,996 --> 00:32:00,719
<i>Jethro, no two suicides are identical,</i>

576
00:32:00,756 --> 00:32:04,026
but the similarities here
are more than coincidental.

577
00:32:04,712 --> 00:32:07,010
Right down to the mark on the hand.

578
00:32:07,521 --> 00:32:08,870
I've seen that before.

579
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,320
Yeah, so have I.
Jasper Shephard's suicide.

580
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:12,611
Supposed suicide.

581
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:17,055
Somebody is missing from this party.

582
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:25,809
Don't get too comfortable.
You already scratched my settee.

583
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:30,095
Your agents have been tearing
apart my house all afternoon,

584
00:32:30,137 --> 00:32:32,392
and they wouldn't even
<i>tell me what they're looking for.</i>

585
00:32:32,457 --> 00:32:34,788
La Grenouille was killed
with a nine-millimeter Glock.

586
00:32:34,975 --> 00:32:36,358
<i>You have a second weapon.</i>

587
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,867
A nine-millimeter Glock.

588
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:41,470
Registered for personal use.
Yet we can't find it.

589
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:42,925
You could have asked me.

590
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,463
- Where's your gun?
- I gave it to La Grenouille.

591
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:47,962
<i>You have the bullets.
Take the damn gun!</i>

592
00:32:48,244 --> 00:32:49,719
Anybody witness that?

593
00:32:49,914 --> 00:32:50,808
Gibbs.

594
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,640
Works for me.

595
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:55,305
Grenouille took the gun,
DiNozzo took it from him.

596
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:58,139
- DiNozzo?
- He's in custody.

597
00:32:58,494 --> 00:33:01,148
<i>An eyewitness at the marina
saw Agent DiNozzo commit the murder.</i>

598
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:03,408
You have a positive I.D.

599
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,606
at night, in the dark, from a distance?

600
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:08,799
I think she'd recognize her boyfriend.

601
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,090
Jeanne Benoit is your witness?

602
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:15,794
You turned my entire department
upside down based on her testimony?

603
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:17,054
I want to talk to her.

604
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:19,246
- Absolutely not.
<i>- Okay.</i>

605
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:21,854
Okay.

606
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,997
My name is Jenny Shepard.

607
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:43,075
I'm the Director of NCIS.

608
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:45,745
Give her a little rope.

609
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,128
<i>I'm the one responsible</i>

610
00:33:47,129 --> 00:33:48,246
for your pain.

611
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:51,589
I ordered Tony to
involve you romantically.

612
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:54,217
Involved you in something
you had nothing to do with.

613
00:33:54,642 --> 00:33:56,919
I'm sorry. I crossed a line.

614
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:01,971
He felt horrible for
what he put you through.

615
00:34:02,402 --> 00:34:03,849
<i>When he told you the truth...</i>

616
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:06,551
<i>My name isn't Tony DiNardo,
it's Anthony DiNozzo.</i>

617
00:34:06,593 --> 00:34:08,401
<i>This has all been a lie. Why?</i>

618
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,467
<i>You should ask him.</i>

619
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:15,862
I think it's the first sign
you're doing something wrong...

620
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:19,814
if you feel bad about telling the truth.

621
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:22,664
You think Tony's a bad person?

622
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:25,258
He killed my father.

623
00:34:26,862 --> 00:34:29,394
That must have been
the worst day of your life.

624
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:31,061
Of anybody's life.

625
00:34:31,714 --> 00:34:33,820
<i>And now you can't stop reliving it.</i>

626
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,229
<i>The way you were feeling.</i>

627
00:34:37,045 --> 00:34:39,641
<i>You probably just wanted
to run away from it all.</i>

628
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,399
Bought a plane ticket,

629
00:34:42,395 --> 00:34:43,842
packed a bag.

630
00:34:45,106 --> 00:34:47,680
<i>Maybe you were tempted to leave a note.</i>

631
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,446
<i>Some last words.</i>

632
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:52,204
Before I knew what Tony was capable of.

633
00:34:53,196 --> 00:34:54,740
Next thing you know,

634
00:34:55,063 --> 00:34:56,978
<i>you're in the car
on the way to the airport.</i>

635
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,573
<i>Praying that any minute
you would wake up...</i>

636
00:35:01,757 --> 00:35:04,034
and find out that
none of it ever happened.

637
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:05,474
I trusted him.

638
00:35:05,781 --> 00:35:07,419
And he lied to me.

639
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,806
Even after all the deception...

640
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:13,318
do you just go?

641
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:17,851
Or do you stop and
see him one last time?

642
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,231
Which him?

643
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:20,779
Tony or the dad?

644
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:22,909
That's the moment, right?

645
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:26,209
<i>You've been taking body blows all day,</i>

646
00:35:26,252 --> 00:35:28,979
and finally that's the moment

647
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:32,707
you actually have to make a choice.

648
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,270
Forget the airport.

649
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,743
Go to the marina.

650
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:40,096
- Pull the car over.
- Yes.

651
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:42,561
- That's where I saw him.
- Your dad?

652
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:43,417
Yes.

653
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,939
- One last time before he's gone?
- Yes.

654
00:35:46,595 --> 00:35:47,404
No.

655
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:51,147
<i>The stars aligned</i>

656
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:54,794
so that you arrived at the marina
when Tony pulled the trigger?

657
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:01,553
You're lying.

658
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,171
What really happened, Jeanne?

659
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:11,234
It's my fault.

660
00:36:14,218 --> 00:36:15,441
I did it.

661
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,251
I killed him.

662
00:36:20,866 --> 00:36:22,761
<i>It feels that way, doesn't it?</i>

663
00:36:24,562 --> 00:36:26,088
But it's not true.

664
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,034
Believe me, I know.

665
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:33,116
You blamed Tony.

666
00:36:33,896 --> 00:36:35,449
Now you're blaming yourself.

667
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,884
What really happened that night?

668
00:36:40,779 --> 00:36:42,810
<i>I made the wrong choice.</i>

669
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:45,080
I wanted to see him.

670
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,610
He was waiting for me at the yacht.

671
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:50,868
But I just couldn't.

672
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,668
I kept driving.

673
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:55,654
You never went to the marina.

674
00:36:55,836 --> 00:36:57,599
I figured he'd come and find me.

675
00:36:58,461 --> 00:37:01,355
No matter what, Dad always found me.

676
00:37:02,446 --> 00:37:03,640
<i>And then he didn't.</i>

677
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:07,069
I just knew.

678
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:09,390
You must be angry.

679
00:37:09,953 --> 00:37:13,592
<i>That you can't have that
one moment to live over again.</i>

680
00:37:14,388 --> 00:37:16,601
I don't know if you
could have changed it.

681
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:19,654
<i>I don't know if you
could have saved him.</i>

682
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:21,449
He loved you.

683
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:24,458
<i>Of that...</i>

684
00:37:25,815 --> 00:37:27,219
I am sure.

685
00:37:42,402 --> 00:37:44,062
Who do you want to talk to now?

686
00:37:45,793 --> 00:37:46,814
How's the case?

687
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,593
Falling apart. Better not be here.
It'll just create more problems.

688
00:37:49,594 --> 00:37:51,162
No, I'm here to solve them.

689
00:37:53,602 --> 00:37:54,970
Well, well, well,

690
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,605
Mr. Kort

691
00:37:56,832 --> 00:37:57,900
<i>from the CIA.</i>

692
00:37:58,682 --> 00:38:00,609
<i>Your boss killed my informant.</i>

693
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:03,305
<i>I need your help to take
La Grenouille down for it.</i>

694
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:05,944
<i>This is not going to end well for you.</i>

695
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:09,279
Your investigation ends now.

696
00:38:09,768 --> 00:38:11,789
This is La Grenouille's handler.

697
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:14,275
<i>I think the CIA would
want to know who killed him.</i>

698
00:38:14,504 --> 00:38:17,172
La Grenouille was killed by an associate
who has since

699
00:38:17,293 --> 00:38:19,821
assumed control of his organization.

700
00:38:20,022 --> 00:38:21,107
Let me guess...

701
00:38:21,371 --> 00:38:23,627
you stepped up to run the whole show.

702
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,598
Did number two here
just confess to murder?

703
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:29,712
The CIA does not assassinate people.

704
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,183
Not on American soil.

705
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:33,317
Let's see your
get-out-of-jail-free card.

706
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:37,577
Eyes only.

707
00:38:44,984 --> 00:38:46,218
It was sanctioned.

708
00:38:46,873 --> 00:38:48,809
La Grenouille wanted to retire.

709
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:51,371
He's retired.

710
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:52,704
It's that simple?

711
00:38:52,772 --> 00:38:54,391
CIA wants it simple.

712
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:57,798
Well, I guess we're
done asking questions.

713
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,181
<i>That's not for you...</i>

714
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:02,081
Just between us...

715
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:03,971
Who killed Jasper Shepard?

716
00:39:06,718 --> 00:39:08,292
Jasper Shepard.

717
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:19,786
Anything that guy wouldn't
do to keep a long-term op intact?

718
00:39:20,084 --> 00:39:20,935
<i>Nope.</i>

719
00:39:21,627 --> 00:39:23,248
Anything he wouldn't say

720
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:26,010
to shut this down
before it got too loud?

721
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:28,259
That night...

722
00:39:29,168 --> 00:39:31,955
<i>at her house,</i>
Jenny gave her gun to the Frog.

723
00:39:33,076 --> 00:39:34,332
<i>You have the bullets.</i>

724
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:35,780
<i>Take the damn gun!</i>

725
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:37,680
<i>Protect yourself.</i>

726
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:39,639
She did.

727
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,554
And that would explain
how it got to the yacht.

728
00:39:41,598 --> 00:39:42,602
It would.

729
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:44,363
And Kort used that gun...

730
00:39:45,568 --> 00:39:46,802
to kill him.

731
00:39:51,393 --> 00:39:52,436
You're right.

732
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:54,602
She's cleared.

733
00:39:58,332 --> 00:39:59,438
The file?

734
00:40:00,152 --> 00:40:01,269
Maybe.

735
00:40:12,548 --> 00:40:13,814
Hey, Trent.

736
00:40:16,336 --> 00:40:17,967
He wasn't just an operative.

737
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:19,707
He was somebody's father.

738
00:40:35,956 --> 00:40:38,874
- Be a man, Tony.
- She accused me of murder.

739
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:41,425
Who is the bad guy? Be a man.

740
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,475
Go tell her what she needs to hear.

741
00:40:58,338 --> 00:41:00,831
Hey, can you give us a second, please?
Thank you.

742
00:41:00,955 --> 00:41:01,976
No problem.

743
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:03,422
Hey.

744
00:41:05,645 --> 00:41:07,702
I'm sorry you got caught
in the middle of all this.

745
00:41:07,714 --> 00:41:09,163
Was any of it real...

746
00:41:10,706 --> 00:41:11,663
Tony?

747
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:19,567
No.

748
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:32,958
I wish I'd never met you.

749
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:51,731
I hope you're not rushing
out on my account.

750
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:53,619
Apparently not.

751
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:57,026
SecNav tells me you're going to be
taking a couple weeks of personal time.

752
00:41:58,196 --> 00:42:01,750
It was never my intention
<i>to burden you with this responsibility.</i>

753
00:42:02,267 --> 00:42:03,273
I don't mind.

754
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:05,789
My wife however, is not so forgiving.

755
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:09,860
<i>Is this yours, Leon?</i>

756
00:42:11,325 --> 00:42:12,335
Keep it.

757
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:22,615
You owe the Bureau for
two sets of all-weather radials.

758
00:42:23,424 --> 00:42:24,255
Yeah.

759
00:42:25,571 --> 00:42:26,571
Bill me.

760
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:34,762
Fairy tale ending?

761
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:38,985
The Frog is dead, and the jesters
have been kicked out of the kingdom.

762
00:42:39,314 --> 00:42:41,080
The queen is back on her throne.

763
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,367
If you're expecting
some sort of knighthood,

764
00:42:43,403 --> 00:42:45,815
I'm sorry to say
I've misplaced my sword.

765
00:42:46,284 --> 00:42:47,609
Maybe it's with your gun.

766
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:49,525
Maybe.

767
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,222
Funny quirk about the Frog,

768
00:42:52,374 --> 00:42:53,523
arms dealer...

769
00:42:54,996 --> 00:42:56,256
never carried a gun.

770
00:42:56,376 --> 00:42:57,482
Except that night.

771
00:42:58,374 --> 00:42:59,459
<i>Take the damn gun!</i>

772
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,083
<i>Protect yourself.</i>

773
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,164
<i>You're signing my death warrant.</i>

774
00:43:04,453 --> 00:43:07,065
- That what happened?
- That's how I remember it.

775
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,573
You remember it differently?

776
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:12,635
<i>Take the damn gun!</i>

777
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,137
<i>Protect yourself.</i>

778
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:17,222
<i>You're signing my death warrant.</i>

779
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:24,890
Long live the queen.

780
