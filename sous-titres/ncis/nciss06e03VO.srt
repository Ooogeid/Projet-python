00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:30,645
- Can't keep up?
- Ten bucks says I beat you to the car.

3
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:31,783
Make it 20.

4
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:47,506
Guess you owe me 20 bucks.

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,507
Oh, my God! David!

Thanks to Bruno and Magic Turtle.

10
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:35,521
Looks scrumptious!

11
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:39,575
They call it Chocoholic's Choice.
Claim it is the ultimate cupcake.

12
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:46,837
- That smells great.
- Don't you dare!

13
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:49,657
Isn't this the week
you're going gluten-free?

14
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:51,659
Thank you, Ziva.
You shouldn't have.

15
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:54,979
I owe you for letting me sleep
at your place.

16
00:01:57,949 --> 00:01:58,949
Slumber party.

17
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,390
You two spent the night together?

18
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,283
- What's going on here, McGee?
- Don't know, don't care.

19
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,932
None of my business, DiNosey.

20
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:10,746
You are such a control geek.

21
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:11,823
Freak.

22
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:13,767
Yes. That, too.

23
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,137
Why do you always need to know
everything that everybody does, Tony?

24
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:18,736
What he needs to know

25
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:22,108
is that a Lieutenant Commander's body
was found in Rock Creek Park.

26
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:26,048
<i>Identified as a female United
States Navy Lieutenant Commander.</i>

27
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:26,907
Gear up.

28
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:30,067
<i>Her name is being withheld,
pending notification of her next of kin.</i>

29
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:38,805
Lieutenant Commander
Carrie McClellan, 35.

30
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:41,490
Stationed at the Pentagon.
She worked as a congressional

31
00:02:41,564 --> 00:02:44,798
liaison officer for the Navy Office
of Legislative Affairs.

32
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:47,262
Lives alone
in the Cleveland Park area.

33
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:48,627
Help DiNozzo.

34
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:51,069
Single small-caliber gunshot
to the back.

35
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,468
No exit wound.

36
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:54,826
However, her death

37
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:57,016
took place elsewhere.

38
00:02:57,216 --> 00:03:00,281
This bloodstain to her back
indicates she bled out

39
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:01,968
on a solid surface.

40
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:03,508
Time of death?

41
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:06,379
Movement of the body and immersion
in water complicates matters,

42
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:08,947
but at least 12 hours,
no more than 24.

43
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:12,415
I'll be able to be more accurate
when I get her back on the table.

44
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:16,491
They were predicting precipitation.

45
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:18,110
Just what we need.

46
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:20,104
Got a partial shoe print here, boss.

47
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:24,702
Boss?

48
00:03:24,827 --> 00:03:27,997
Work fast. It rains, we lose evidence.
Yeah, Gibbs.

49
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:30,220
Stayed at Abby's last night?

50
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:32,347
Guess you sleep in the same room?

51
00:03:32,823 --> 00:03:35,681
- It is a one-bedroom apartment.
- One bedroom, one bed.

52
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,244
- One coffin.
- You want the truth?

53
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,559
Yeah.

54
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,671
I think I can handle the truth.

55
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:44,349
My building was being fumigated,

56
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:46,543
and Abby was kind enough
to let me stay over.

57
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,932
On the couch. In my pajamas.

58
00:03:49,008 --> 00:03:50,488
Come on, work with me.

59
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:53,328
- Couldn't you lie just a little bit?
- DiNozzo, after you're through here,

60
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,826
the victim's apartment.

61
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:56,084
Right.

62
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:05,764
We're fighting the weather and he wants
us to hurry up, and then he leaves.

63
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,723
What is this all about?

64
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:25,309
Senator?

65
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:27,643
Gunny.

66
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,192
Hello, Patrick.

67
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:35,527
- Thanks for coming, Jethro.
- Yeah, sure.

68
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:36,955
Why here?

69
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,813
Well, it's best we not be seen
together right now.

70
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:43,206
I saw on the news,

71
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,644
a Lieutenant Commander was found shot
in Rock Creek Park.

72
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:49,020
NCIS involved?

73
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:51,823
I just left them.

74
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,447
Was it Carrie McClellan?

75
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:01,452
Did you know her?

76
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:11,132
Did you know her?

77
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:17,406
We were having an affair.

78
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,912
Why'd you think
it was Carrie McClellan?

79
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:32,508
News report said the victim
was a female Lieutenant Commander.

80
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,230
Carrie lived near the park.

81
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:38,114
We were supposed to meet last night.

82
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:40,593
She didn't show, didn't call.

83
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:42,229
Try to reach her?

84
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,009
Carrie always made the contact.

85
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:50,903
Nothing unusual about a congressional
liaison calling a senator's office.

86
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,049
Her parents have been told?

87
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,316
Not yet.

88
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:02,855
They'll be devastated.
She was an only child.

89
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:06,520
I'm an idiot, Gunny.

90
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:10,564
I've thrown my career away.

91
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,743
Lynn and the kids don't deserve this.

92
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:18,215
Once the affair is made public,
everyone is gonna think I killed her.

93
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,711
Pat, I can't cover this up.

94
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:25,029
Don't expect you to, Jethro.

95
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:28,487
Tell me about
the Lieutenant Commander.

96
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:31,759
She was an incredible young woman.

97
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:35,013
Smart.

98
00:06:36,248 --> 00:06:37,923
- Well-liked.
- Ex-boyfriends?

99
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:40,060
- Not that she mentioned.
- Problems?

100
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,339
She had a run-in with
her commanding officer.

101
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,417
- Yeah? She say what it was about?
- Not really.

102
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:50,044
He took exception to a report
she wrote.

103
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,220
Media's gonna have
a field day with this.

104
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,796
Couldn't have happened at a worse time.
My energy bill

105
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,463
is up for vote next week.

106
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:03,531
It shouldn't be defeated
because of my indiscretions.

107
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:06,256
Legislation is far too important.

108
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:10,992
The economy is a mess,
and fuel costs are leading the way.

109
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,811
This bill is a way of
turning things around.

110
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:22,441
Could you please keep my name
out of this until after the vote?

111
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,760
I'll see what I can do.

112
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:40,351
It is sad.

113
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:43,825
It was her birthday last week.
Her grandmother sent her this card.

114
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:45,674
Am I the only one that's starving?

115
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:47,555
Haven't eaten since lunch.

116
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:49,595
Well, there's half a veggie pizza
in the fridge.

117
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:56,398
- What are you doing?
- I'm building a profile of the victim.

118
00:07:58,183 --> 00:08:01,233
- Not exactly Navy issue.
- She was not just a Navy officer.

119
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:03,512
She was also a woman.

120
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:05,301
Officer and a gentlewoman.

121
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:07,633
Richard Gere. Debra Winger.

122
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,388
It's a rare commodity.
Military chick flick.

123
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:12,097
It appears she had a lover.

124
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:14,536
"To the woman I love.
You mean everything to me".

125
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,558
And it is signed, "You know who".

126
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:19,229
Why would he not sign his name?

127
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:21,430
Maybe it's not a he. Maybe it's a she.

128
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:23,879
We are dealing with the military.
Don't ask, don't tell.

129
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:26,406
- Looks like a man's handwriting.
- Definitely a man.

130
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:27,718
How do you know?

131
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:30,066
Medicine cabinet.
Low-estrogen birth control pills.

132
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:32,440
- She's on the ninth day of her cycle.
- You just

133
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,830
love snooping around
into other people's lives, don't you?

134
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:38,082
Yeah. That's why I became a cop.

135
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:40,756
Hey, boss. Everything all right?

136
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,199
- Yeah.
- No signs of a struggle.

137
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,160
Didn't find any traces of blood.
The commander wasn't shot here.

138
00:08:46,315 --> 00:08:48,478
The neighbors described
the victim as a loner.

139
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:50,348
No one knew her particularly well.

140
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,230
Still looking her personal effects.

141
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:53,768
Keys, wallet, cell phone.

142
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:55,819
Her car's parked
in her space downstairs.

143
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:57,973
She's got a lover
who won't sign his name.

144
00:08:58,044 --> 00:09:00,766
There's no pictures or evidence
of him in the apartment.

145
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:05,407
Boss, my gut tells me she was having
an affair with a married man.

146
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,605
Lieutenant Commander McClellan
spent more time on the Hill

147
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:13,388
than she did at the Pentagon, but

148
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:16,915
- that goes with her job.
- When's the last time you saw her?

149
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,648
Monday's staff meeting.

150
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:22,314
She had Top Secret clearance.

151
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,631
- Do I have a security problem here?
- I don't know.

152
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,217
What were her responsibilities?

153
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,840
Developing and coordinating

154
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,362
relationships between
representatives of the D.O.N. and

155
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:34,934
members of Congress.

156
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:37,853
She made a lot of powerful friends.

157
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:40,693
Carrie was on the fast track.

158
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,500
Ever meet her boyfriend?

159
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:46,128
Didn't know she had one.

160
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:48,747
Don't really know anything
about her personal life.

161
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,638
Understand you took exception
to a report

162
00:09:50,702 --> 00:09:52,466
Lieutenant Commander McClellan filed.

163
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,082
Technical specs were supposedly

164
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:02,535
leaked to a defense contractor a couple
days before their official release.

165
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:05,285
It was no big deal.
Never traced to my command.

166
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:07,697
McClellan wrote it up.
I told her not to.

167
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,819
She could be stubborn.

168
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:14,851
- That it?
- Yeah, for now.

169
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:22,971
Gonna need to take a look
at her office.

170
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:27,011
Had it secured. I'll make
arrangements for you to get in.

171
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,887
- That's odd.
- What?

172
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:35,339
I'm looking at Commander McClellan's
cell phone calls for the past month.

173
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,554
Restaurants, family, nothing unusual.

174
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:40,183
But there is one number
she called 36 times.

175
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,723
- Trace it.
- I don't have to.

176
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,417
It's the Capitol switchboard.

177
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:47,844
Well, that makes sense.

178
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:51,387
I am sure she has to call senators' and
representatives' offices all the time.

179
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,486
- It's part of her job.
- That's exactly my point.

180
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:55,576
Wouldn't she have
their direct dial numbers?

181
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:58,267
- How'd it go?
- Admiral made an impression on DiNozzo.

182
00:10:58,327 --> 00:10:59,694
I'm gonna check him out.

183
00:10:59,754 --> 00:11:01,995
He was more interested in covering
his ass than the victim.

184
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,373
- You got anything?
- I ran a locator search

185
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:07,336
on McClellan's cell. Either her phone
is turned off or the battery's dead,

186
00:11:07,402 --> 00:11:10,145
so I pulled her phone records.
She made numerous calls

187
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:12,130
to the Capitol,
but always to the switchboard.

188
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:15,301
- She didn't want her calls traced.
- Accessed to ESR.

189
00:11:16,162 --> 00:11:18,134
She was fourth in her class
at the academy.

190
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,953
Been nothing but uphill since then.
Awards and rapid promotions.

191
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:24,700
The family has not returned
my call yet.

192
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,186
Got a minute?

193
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:35,208
So, what's up with <i>el jefe</i>?

194
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:37,444
Yesterday, he leaves the crime scene
with no explanation.

195
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,140
Today, he knew the admiral
had a problem with the victim.

196
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:42,448
- Where'd he get that?
- Maybe he's bluffing.

197
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:49,640
- It was on the nose.
- Whose nose?

198
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:53,075
On the money.
Bulls-eye. Right as rain.

199
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:56,912
You were doing better before you went
back to Israel. You've reverted.

200
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,338
I found this message
on my private line.

201
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:08,062
<i>You have one saved message.</i>

202
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,728
<i>The gun that killed
Lieutenant Commander McClellan</i>

203
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:13,749
<i>can be found in the drainage ditch,</i>

204
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,602
<i>alongside the two-mile marker,</i>

205
00:12:15,662 --> 00:12:18,547
<i>near the Grant Road entrance
to Rock Creek Park.</i>

206
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,331
It's so filthy.

207
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:24,327
I can't see anything.

208
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:25,537
It is filthy.

209
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:27,973
Must be some kind of
sewage thing or something.

210
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,516
It's not here.
Someone's messing with us.

211
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,555
I see something.

212
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:43,607
Over here. Look.

213
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,537
Look, look, look.

214
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:47,505
There. See that?

215
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,214
Looks like a sort of shadowy thing.

216
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:53,811
Here. Your turn.

217
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,943
I am the Jedi Master.
You are the Padawan learner.

218
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:06,379
No, it's... farther.

219
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,125
Farther out!

220
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,447
- I can't go farther.
- Farther out!

221
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:12,771
- I can't.
- All right, here.

222
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,351
I gotcha. I gotcha.

223
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:18,052
- You got me?
- I'm holding you.

224
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,416
- Farther out.
- Here, hold on.

225
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:22,750
A little further.

226
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:37,222
What's that? What do you got there?

227
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,359
See, I told you I saw something.

228
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,939
I had nothing to do with that one.

229
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,214
It's a Smith & Wesson 32 kit.

230
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:02,254
Just like the gat Bogie
was packing in Maltese Falcon.

231
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:04,680
It's the stuff dreams are made of.

232
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,235
Out of my way.

233
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:09,415
Any prints on the weapon?

234
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:11,550
Gibbs, it was underwater
and covered in mud.

235
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:14,802
- McGee found it with his butt.
- The serial number remained intact.

236
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:16,606
I gave it to Ziva.
She's running it down.

237
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:19,099
So, the test-fired slug
is on the left.

238
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,657
And the one that Ducky removed
from our victim is on the right.

239
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:31,415
- You've got your murder weapon, Gibbs.
- Yeah.

240
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,696
Handed to us on a silver platter.

241
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:41,873
<i>Near the Grant Road entrance
to Rock Creek Park.</i>

242
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:45,818
Secure line, restricted number.

243
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:48,688
Find out who made the call.

244
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,160
Director Vance, I'll need the password
to your voice mail account.

245
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:03,813
- For your eyes only.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:15:03,873 --> 00:15:06,735
And the messages from my wife,
not for your ears.

247
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,759
I understand.

248
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:12,301
Go home. Change.

249
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:20,914
You think this is
a catch-me-if-you-can?

250
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:23,464
The killer's taunting us?

251
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:25,917
Possibility.

252
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:28,952
The Lieutenant Commander
had Top Secret clearance.

253
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,603
Worked on the Hill.
Had a lot of high-profile contacts.

254
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,880
I'm going to need to be kept in
the loop on this.

255
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,231
I've been on the case
less than 24 hours.

256
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:41,941
When I get something concrete,
I will let you know.

257
00:15:55,347 --> 00:15:58,006
- What're you doing?
- A boundary's been crossed, Gibbs.

258
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:00,753
I've been violated.
Nothing is sacred anymore.

259
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,730
Yeah. Tell me.

260
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,263
Someone stole my cupcake.

261
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,431
- Cupcake?
- Yes.

262
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:15,442
And it wasn't just any cupcake.
It was a Chocoholic's Choice cupcake.

263
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:17,936
There is a thief amongst us.

264
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,771
I'm gonna find out who,
and they're going to be sorry.

265
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,106
Do you think you could pull
yourself away

266
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,401
from this long enough
to focus on the murder?

267
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:29,275
I've been working, Gibbs.

268
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,415
Commander McClellan.
She buys a lot of clothes online.

269
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:37,279
She downloads classical music, and she
reads her horoscope every day, as do I.

270
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:40,299
Today it said I was gonna have
a positive encounter with a coworker.

271
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,293
- Not gonna happen.
- That all you got?

272
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,844
No. I also found fibers
on the victim's clothing.

273
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:48,122
They're consistent
with automobile carpet.

274
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:51,251
So, I'm running the fibers through
the FBI fiber database

275
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:54,617
to try to find out
the make and... model.

276
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:56,026
What?

277
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,181
What?!

278
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,999
Is that a cupcake crumb?

279
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:04,024
No.

280
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:11,723
We'll see.

281
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,841
Thanks, Jer.
You are indeed the man.

282
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:21,569
If Carrie McClellan had a married lover,
I've got a pretty good candidate.

283
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:24,403
Her CO, Admiral Graves.

284
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,127
What'd you find out?

285
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,564
He and the wife separated a

286
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:29,878
year ago. Now they're back together,
trying to make it work.

287
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:32,469
But my source at the Pentagon
says he's still a player.

288
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:33,637
Who's your source?

289
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:37,836
- Jerry the barber.
- A barber?

290
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:40,302
Yeah, works in the Pentagon
Athletic Center.

291
00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:42,950
Overhears more gossip than
anyone else in the building.

292
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,763
Barbers, manicurists,

293
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,241
shoe-shine guys, they're invisible.

294
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:51,045
People talk in front of them
like they're not even there.

295
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:52,727
Graves is involved.

296
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:55,494
- You accusing an admiral, DiNozzo?
- Following my instincts.

297
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:58,771
Boss, the anonymous call made to
Director Vance came from a burn phone.

298
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:01,808
Was purchased in cash from
a convenience store in Arlington.

299
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,506
- When?
- More than a year ago.

300
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:05,479
Surveillance video
is only kept for a month.

301
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:08,300
Call originated from a cell tower
near Lafayette Park,

302
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,803
across from the White House.
And I identified the voice.

303
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:14,680
- Who?
- Not exactly a "who".

304
00:18:18,656 --> 00:18:22,484
<i>The sly brown fox quickly
jumped over the lazy dog.</i>

305
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,374
It's a text reader from
Write Draft 2007.

306
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:28,599
The most sophisticated
voice-generating software around.

307
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:30,600
Are we ever gonna catch
a break on this one?

308
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,132
I got lucky with the gun.

309
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:35,926
Serial number indicates
it was manufactured in 1949.

310
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:37,201
Was never registered.

311
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,023
But the firing pin looked new,
so I checked around.

312
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:43,372
Turns out ten years ago,
it was taken to a master gunsmith

313
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:46,761
for restoration and cleaning.
The owner's name was...

314
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:49,617
Otis Tripp.

315
00:18:50,498 --> 00:18:52,176
He died in 1999.

316
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,771
No one leaves here till I get back.

317
00:19:02,723 --> 00:19:05,127
Okay. Now I'm officially curious.

318
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,050
We found the murder weapon.

319
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:16,989
- That's a good thing, right?
- Yeah.

320
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:19,945
Owned by a Marine who's been dead
nine years.

321
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:21,876
Otis Tripp, your father-in-law.

322
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:26,448
Smith & Wesson, 32 kit.
Have you ever seen it?

323
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:28,688
Yeah.

324
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:30,810
Otis left it to me.

325
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:33,745
I don't understand.

326
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:37,714
It was in my den, locked in the gun
cabinet with the rest of my collection.

327
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:40,370
Where did you find it?

328
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:44,111
All right, I see where this is going.

329
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:47,469
I did not kill that woman.

330
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,900
I could never get anything by you.

331
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,749
You could always see
right through my bull.

332
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:59,121
I'm telling you the truth.

333
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:02,347
I did not kill Carrie McClellan.

334
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:11,420
Somebody's framing me.

335
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:13,966
It sure looks that way.

336
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,717
Did Carrie get killed because of me?

337
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:24,114
Yeah, Gibbs.

338
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,810
<i>I need you back at my office, now.</i>

339
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:27,936
What?

340
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,176
I gotta go. I love you, too.

341
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:34,592
Yeah?

342
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,760
- When'd the call come in?
- About an hour ago.

343
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:40,876
<i>You have reached the voice mail of...</i>

344
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:44,170
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

345
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:45,916
<i>I led you to the gun.</i>

346
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:48,290
<i>When is an arrest going to be made?</i>

347
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:51,632
<i>Is Special Agent Gibbs
covering up for an old friend?</i>

348
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,006
If there's something
you've been holding back, now

349
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:59,364
would be a very good time
for you to tell me.

350
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,137
- Where the hell are you going?
- Director Vance.

351
00:21:06,677 --> 00:21:08,217
Senator Patrick Kiley.

352
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:18,450
I met Carrie about
a year and a half ago.

353
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,233
She was helping me with
two high school students from my state

354
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:23,898
who I was sponsoring
for admission to the academy.

355
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:25,675
I became fascinated.

356
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:28,872
Her intelligence, wit,

357
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:30,092
beauty.

358
00:21:30,861 --> 00:21:32,992
I kept finding excuses to see her.

359
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:36,774
Obviously, that was a mistake.

360
00:21:37,524 --> 00:21:40,366
And when you heard she was dead,
you called Special Agent Gibbs.

361
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:43,976
I knew the investigation
would lead to me. In Jethro's defense,

362
00:21:44,154 --> 00:21:46,867
the first thing he said was
he wouldn't cover anything up.

363
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:48,742
Senator's being framed.

364
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,186
By whom?

365
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:54,189
Any enemies?

366
00:21:55,154 --> 00:21:58,714
I'm a politician, Director Vance.
Enemies come with the territory.

367
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:00,411
Anyone in particular?

368
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:04,014
Yeah. Big oil money.

369
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,978
I hate to accuse anyone.

370
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:10,140
- We're talking about murder.
- No, Pat.

371
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:13,580
No, we're talking about you.
We're talking about your life,

372
00:22:14,036 --> 00:22:15,971
murder of a naval officer

373
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,113
who might have been killed because
of her association with you.

374
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,999
My energy bill is going to pass.

375
00:22:24,095 --> 00:22:25,879
If I'm a suspect of a murder,

376
00:22:26,296 --> 00:22:27,806
the legislation is dead.

377
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:33,554
There's a lobbyist...

378
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:39,167
... Reed Talbot, who's been trying
to dig up dirt on me.

379
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:41,652
Would he have killed somebody
over a bill not passing?

380
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:45,623
It could cost the oil companies
tens of billions of dollars.

381
00:22:45,746 --> 00:22:48,002
- And the vote's next week.
- Tuesday.

382
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:52,115
Your status as a senator aside,

383
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:54,898
this investigation will take us
where it takes us.

384
00:22:57,255 --> 00:22:59,120
But it's the agency's policy

385
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,775
never to divulge details
of an ongoing case.

386
00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:05,010
Thank you.

387
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,303
Hey, guys.

388
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,256
I identified the fibers I found on
the Lieutenant Commander's clothing.

389
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:13,364
Charcoal gray from the cargo
compartment of a 2003

390
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:15,925
to 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee.

391
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:18,645
Must be hundreds of
those in the metro area.

392
00:23:18,724 --> 00:23:20,864
1,267. Open your mouth.

393
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:24,440
- What? Why?
- I need a DNA swab.

394
00:23:25,096 --> 00:23:28,021
- What's this about?
- Someone stole her cupcake.

395
00:23:29,587 --> 00:23:31,363
No. It's an invasion of privacy.

396
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,501
McGee, I will get your DNA
one way or the another.

397
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:37,110
Do what the woman says.
She sleeps in a coffin.

398
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,259
Thanks. You're next.

399
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:48,929
Can I do that myself? I don't like
people putting things in my mouth.

400
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:50,261
Thanks.

401
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:52,943
Abby, you're making too much of this.
I'll buy you another cupcake.

402
00:23:54,745 --> 00:23:57,198
Feeling guilty, Ziva?

403
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:59,282
I got you the cupcake.

404
00:23:59,726 --> 00:24:01,995
No one is above suspicion.

405
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:05,931
Is that?

406
00:24:08,552 --> 00:24:12,223
- Yes, it is.
- Ziva, background on Reed Talbot.

407
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:13,869
Lobbyist for oil interest.

408
00:24:13,948 --> 00:24:16,548
McGee, Director got
another anonymous phone call.

409
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:17,580
On it, boss.

410
00:24:17,678 --> 00:24:20,537
- Come on, DiNozzo. You're with me.
- Need your DNA, Gibbs.

411
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,770
- I'll show you to the study.
- Senator?

412
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:38,812
Is everything all right? You haven't
been answering your phone.

413
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:41,085
I turned if off, Cole.
Everything's fine.

414
00:24:42,823 --> 00:24:44,873
You know you missed
the Press Club Dinner.

415
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:45,921
I know.

416
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:48,867
Special Agents Gibbs and DiNozzo,
this is Cole Erickson,

417
00:24:49,218 --> 00:24:50,520
my chief of staff.

418
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:52,909
FBI?

419
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,039
NCIS.

420
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,343
We're here investigating
a stolen weapon.

421
00:25:01,492 --> 00:25:02,627
I'll explain it later.

422
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:03,837
Leroy

423
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,963
Jethro

424
00:25:05,044 --> 00:25:06,025
Gibbs.

425
00:25:07,764 --> 00:25:09,698
I thought I heard a familiar voice.

426
00:25:09,946 --> 00:25:12,476
I was going to give Patrick
grief for disappearing tonight,

427
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,651
but since he was with you,
I'll forgive him.

428
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:17,153
Hello, Lynn.

429
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,776
Hi. I'm Lynn.

430
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,289
Anthony DiNozzo.

431
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:23,457
Lynn, I wish it were,
but this isn't a social visit.

432
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,513
No?

433
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:31,273
- Honey, we have to talk.
- What's wrong?

434
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:35,913
Cole, would you take Agents Gibbs and
DiNozzo into the study?

435
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,094
They're here to look at
my gun cabinet.

436
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:40,175
Yes, sir.

437
00:25:42,044 --> 00:25:43,129
Right this way.

438
00:25:49,585 --> 00:25:51,016
Let's go in here.

439
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:55,277
Look at that. Armed to the teeth.

440
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,101
Desert Storm?

441
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:03,477
Yeah, our base camp in Doha.

442
00:26:04,303 --> 00:26:07,086
You're that gunnery sergeant
the senator always talks about.

443
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:10,777
- We served together.
- Well, the way he tells it,

444
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:13,999
you made a young,
raw Lieutenant look good.

445
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:15,486
It's locked.

446
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:17,242
Know where the key is?

447
00:26:19,588 --> 00:26:21,269
I believe he keeps it
in his top drawer.

448
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,361
I got it.

449
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:27,483
Thanks very much. We'll let you know
if we need anything.

450
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:40,029
Well, some things never change.

451
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,257
Door's unlocked, and you're down
here working on that damn boat.

452
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,469
How you doing, Lynn?

453
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,232
I've had better days.

454
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:52,796
<i>It is a six to five game,
top of the seventh inning.</i>

455
00:26:53,157 --> 00:26:55,880
<i>And the series is tied at
two games apiece.</i>

456
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,724
Is the bar open?

457
00:26:58,066 --> 00:27:00,911
<i>Tonight. Digs in. There's the windup.</i>

458
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:01,799
Sure.

459
00:27:02,157 --> 00:27:05,019
<i>And a strike on the inside corner,
just got it!</i>

460
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,385
Thank God the boys are away at school.

461
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:11,694
I had to get out of the house.

462
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:13,974
Been driving around for hours.

463
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:18,934
Realized I needed someone to talk to.

464
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:21,850
'Cause I promised
the bastard I wouldn't tell

465
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,787
anyone about his sleazy affair
with the dead girl, but

466
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,751
but since you already know.

467
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,528
Go. Talk.

468
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:35,785
You were there for me.

469
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,783
If you can get through Shannon
and Kelly's deaths,

470
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:43,621
I can get through this.

471
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:45,881
Gonna be tough.

472
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:50,508
A circus when the media
gets ahold of it.

473
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:53,701
I'll tell you one thing.
I am not going to be the dutiful wife,

474
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,020
standing by his side
at the press conference.

475
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:58,348
He got himself into this.
He can deal with it.

476
00:27:58,427 --> 00:27:59,946
You knew about the affair?

477
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:03,919
Not at first.

478
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:07,614
I mean, you suspect,
but you don't want to believe it.

479
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,727
I didn't even know who the woman was.

480
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,835
I knew where they were meeting.

481
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:15,081
At his chief of staff's apartment.

482
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:16,683
Cole Erickson?

483
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:20,022
I didn't like that weasel
from day one.

484
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:22,475
Seems very loyal.

485
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:25,631
Loyal?

486
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,968
He'd do anything Patrick asked.

487
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:30,582
I think he's in love with my husband.

488
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:34,126
I've never seen him with a woman.

489
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:41,224
Patrick.
It's the fifth time he's called.

490
00:28:41,537 --> 00:28:42,847
You can't keep avoiding him.

491
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:46,023
I'm not feeling very forgiving
at the moment.

492
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:48,813
That'll come.

493
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,281
You need to go home.

494
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:09,989
Thanks for listening, Jethro.

495
00:29:20,211 --> 00:29:21,977
You know, as much as I hate

496
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,968
Patrick at this moment, you and
I both know he's a Marine to the core,

497
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:27,784
and he would never shoot anyone,

498
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,473
let alone a woman, in the back.

499
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:44,696
- Okay, talk to me, Abs.
- Thanks.

500
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:48,178
Okay, I analyzed all the prints
from the gun cabinet,

501
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,938
and I matched them all to
the elimination prints that Tony took

502
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,210
from Senator Kiley, his wife
and the chief of staff, Cole Erickson.

503
00:29:54,302 --> 00:29:57,595
There's was one right index finger
that didn't belong to anybody.

504
00:29:57,721 --> 00:29:59,695
I ran it through AFIS. Nothing.

505
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:02,786
- Did the senator have a housekeeper?
- Well, I think so.

506
00:30:03,484 --> 00:30:07,022
What's that? That the shoe print
McGee lifted from the crime scene?

507
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,724
No.

508
00:30:10,285 --> 00:30:12,693
The print that he lifted was from
a metro policeman.

509
00:30:15,168 --> 00:30:16,687
Well then, what's that?

510
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,521
I'm so close to a bust, Gibbs.

511
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,406
You cannot have my cupcake and
eat it, too.

512
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:27,497
- You're not serious.
- Dead.

513
00:30:31,216 --> 00:30:32,657
Thurman Atteberry?

514
00:30:32,904 --> 00:30:35,233
- The night janitor?
- Seems like he's...

515
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:37,754
recently put on a little weight.

516
00:30:39,982 --> 00:30:41,324
Reed Talbot.

517
00:30:41,403 --> 00:30:44,284
Look at the crooked grin on his face.

518
00:30:44,365 --> 00:30:45,827
Well, he's a lobbyist.

519
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,929
Arm-twisting sleaze bag.

520
00:30:48,048 --> 00:30:50,707
To quote a Congressional aide
I interviewed this morning,

521
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,145
"Reed Talbot will do anything
in his power to defeat

522
00:30:53,205 --> 00:30:55,022
Senator Kiley's energy bill".

523
00:30:55,318 --> 00:30:56,895
I have a feeling about this guy.

524
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:59,148
Yeah, I had a feeling
about Admiral Graves.

525
00:30:59,345 --> 00:31:02,318
- Even I can be wrong.
- Abs got a fingerprint she can't match.

526
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:03,799
Talbot's on file?

527
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:07,600
No. Checked. He has never been
in the military or arrested.

528
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:10,358
Hey, are Cole Erickson's
prints on the gun cabinet?

529
00:31:11,194 --> 00:31:12,950
- Yeah.
- He's moving up my list.

530
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,794
He drives a 2006 Jeep Cherokee.

531
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:17,202
Don't know what color the interior is,
but I'm gonna find out.

532
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:20,170
That second anonymous to the director
was made from the same burn phone.

533
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:21,923
- The same location?
- No.

534
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,759
I need this.

535
00:31:26,262 --> 00:31:27,269
What for?

536
00:31:28,744 --> 00:31:31,561
- Hey!
- The call lasted 26 seconds.

537
00:31:31,643 --> 00:31:35,048
Started on this cell tower. Halfway
through, transferred to this one.

538
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:38,469
The caller was in a vehicle,
traveling west bound on Independence.

539
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:40,634
Probably used a laptop
to generate the voice.

540
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:49,668
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a minute?

541
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:51,493
Sure.

542
00:31:51,574 --> 00:31:54,288
I am collecting signatures
for a national referendum.

543
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,153
- What's it about?
- There is a movement

544
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:58,918
trying to reintroduce
the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit

545
00:31:58,978 --> 00:32:01,671
to reduce fuel consumption.
We are against it.

546
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:04,167
Do you know who I am?

547
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:07,879
A very handsome man who looks like
he keeps himself in shape.

548
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:11,192
Where do I sign?

549
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,523
Phone number and e-mail?

550
00:32:17,988 --> 00:32:19,255
That's optional...

551
00:32:21,592 --> 00:32:22,592
Reed.

552
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:25,495
Well, I'll be happy to give them...

553
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,604
To you.

554
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,284
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

555
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:45,881
Here's the number of Erickson's PDA.
Trace it.

556
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,217
- I'm in the middle of something.
- Now!

557
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:54,085
Cole Erickson's Jeep
has a charcoal gray interior.

558
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:56,630
Matches the fiber
Abby found on the victim.

559
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,861
- Get a look at the vehicle.
- Can't find Erickson.

560
00:32:58,925 --> 00:33:01,272
Not answering his phones.
Called the Senator's office, Erickson

561
00:33:01,332 --> 00:33:03,998
never showed for work this morning,
they're looking for him, too.

562
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,002
- PDA's on.
- Where is it?

563
00:33:07,211 --> 00:33:09,737
- Watergate Complex.
- Erickson has an apartment there.

564
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:15,523
Yeah, we're here. Is it still on?

565
00:33:15,588 --> 00:33:17,088
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Location?

566
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:19,457
McGee says the PDA's still on
at this location.

567
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:20,830
Give me a key.

568
00:33:23,449 --> 00:33:24,870
Keep the hallway clear.

569
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,972
Mr. Erickson, NCIS!

570
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,540
Clear.

571
00:33:48,672 --> 00:33:49,403
Boss?

572
00:33:50,013 --> 00:33:51,257
It's a suicide note.

573
00:34:01,913 --> 00:34:04,583
The suicide note was written and
printed on his computer.

574
00:34:05,216 --> 00:34:07,741
Erickson's Grand Cherokee is
still on his parking space,

575
00:34:07,801 --> 00:34:09,617
having it towed
to the evidence garage

576
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:12,535
Looks like you were wrong about
Reed Talbot.

577
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:14,137
He's still a crumb bag.

578
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:16,260
- You got something?
- Yes.

579
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,999
This area of the carpet
was recently cleaned.

580
00:34:19,263 --> 00:34:20,560
I will get the ALS.

581
00:34:20,753 --> 00:34:23,368
I can give you
a preliminary cause of death.

582
00:34:23,705 --> 00:34:24,705
Asphyxia.

583
00:34:25,217 --> 00:34:27,692
Yes, well,
it is rather obvious, isn't it?

584
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:30,280
Would you care to venture
the time of death?

585
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:32,739
Little after 10:00 this morning.

586
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:35,158
I'm not feeling very needed.

587
00:34:35,455 --> 00:34:37,205
On what do you base your reasoning?

588
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:39,778
Suicide note was written at 10:02.

589
00:34:41,327 --> 00:34:43,374
Boss. Found this in the desk.

590
00:34:43,783 --> 00:34:45,353
It's the burn phone Erickson used

591
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:47,440
to make the anonymous calls
to the Director.

592
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:50,400
The laptop has
Write Draft Text Reader.

593
00:34:50,611 --> 00:34:53,214
- Listen to this.
- <i>What's taking so long?</i>

594
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,136
<i>I led you to the gun.</i>

595
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:56,585
Gibbs?

596
00:34:56,884 --> 00:34:57,895
Visitor.

597
00:35:05,424 --> 00:35:06,986
Cole's body is still in there?

598
00:35:09,459 --> 00:35:10,526
Can I see him?

599
00:35:11,114 --> 00:35:12,765
It's a secure crime scene, Pat.

600
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:16,769
I just can't believe Cole
would do this.

601
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:19,256
When did he learn about your affair?

602
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:22,779
He knew from the beginning.

603
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:24,832
He let us use his apartment.

604
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:28,306
What was his relationship with her?

605
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:31,815
Didn't really have one that I know of.

606
00:35:32,456 --> 00:35:34,079
He met her a few times.

607
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:36,555
I had my own key, so he was...

608
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:39,148
usually gone before we got here.

609
00:35:40,497 --> 00:35:42,148
If what you're asking is:

610
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:44,487
did Cole disapprove?

611
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,269
Yes.

612
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,873
He left a note.

613
00:35:49,282 --> 00:35:52,228
Full confession.
Admitted making the calls to NCIS.

614
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:56,405
Addressed to you.

615
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:11,769
Blood.

616
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,682
Asphyxia confirmed.

617
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:20,429
And I found a large quantity of diazepam
in his stomach and bloodstream.

618
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,972
- A depressant?
- Well, it's not unusual.

619
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:26,833
Suicides often take drugs to relax
so they won't change their mind,

620
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:29,640
and in his case,
pull the bag off his head.

621
00:36:32,496 --> 00:36:34,887
- You got an opinion?
- It doesn't feel right.

622
00:36:34,947 --> 00:36:37,697
We were handed the gun and
a suicide confession. It's too easy.

623
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:41,249
Senator Kiley is holding
a press conference in two hours.

624
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:43,717
I've been asked to attend.

625
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:47,623
I would like to be able to confirm
that this case is solved,

626
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:50,213
but I'm getting the feeling
that you don't think so.

627
00:36:51,572 --> 00:36:53,883
Hell, you can get a lot done
in two hours, Leon.

628
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:04,715
You looking for me, Tony?

629
00:37:05,112 --> 00:37:05,850
No.

630
00:37:06,634 --> 00:37:07,727
I am.

631
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,192
Do you think I'm an idiot?

632
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,690
No.

633
00:37:12,808 --> 00:37:15,943
- You thought I wouldn't figure it out?
- What is she talking about?

634
00:37:17,324 --> 00:37:18,339
The cupcake.

635
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,449
You stole it from my refrigerator!

636
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,157
I have forensic evidence.

637
00:37:23,217 --> 00:37:25,995
Your big fat fingerprint.

638
00:37:26,297 --> 00:37:27,934
Come on, you think I'm that stupid?

639
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:30,785
Look, if I was going to steal
your precious cupcake,

640
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,371
I would not leave a fingerprint
on your refrigerator.

641
00:37:33,722 --> 00:37:34,751
You didn't.

642
00:37:35,183 --> 00:37:36,948
You used latex gloves.

643
00:37:37,962 --> 00:37:39,291
Brand-new box, McGee.

644
00:37:39,621 --> 00:37:41,989
Only prints... mine and yours.

645
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:47,058
- You said you were going gluten-free.
- Where is it, McGee?

646
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:48,893
I was saving you from yourself, Abby.

647
00:37:49,118 --> 00:37:51,187
Where did you "save it", McGee?

648
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:55,141
Okay, I ate it.

649
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:57,643
Look, it was late.
I hadn't eaten since lunch.

650
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,689
The machine in the break room
was empty,

651
00:38:00,749 --> 00:38:01,989
and it looked so good.

652
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:06,865
What were you thinking, McGee?
She's a world-class forensic scientist.

653
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,623
- Thank you, Tony.
- I bought the cupcake for Abby.

654
00:38:13,674 --> 00:38:14,677
So...

655
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:17,546
how was it?

656
00:38:18,248 --> 00:38:19,643
It was life-changing.

657
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:23,344
- Book him, Danno.
- Break it up, we've got work to do.

658
00:38:23,795 --> 00:38:25,471
Gibbs, we have a confession.

659
00:38:25,935 --> 00:38:28,171
The blood on the carpet
was Carrie McClellan's.

660
00:38:28,245 --> 00:38:30,195
She was killed at
Erickson's apartment.

661
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:33,276
More of her blood was in the back of
his truck. That's how he moved the body

662
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:34,383
to the park.

663
00:38:34,443 --> 00:38:36,732
Pull Erickson's phone company records
for his PDA.

664
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:40,111
Find out if his device was used
during these dates and times.

665
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:41,835
Got you, boss.

666
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,838
- Your two hours are up.
- Jethro.

667
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:55,983
Appreciate you showing up.

668
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:59,343
It's good to have the support of
an old friend.

669
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,016
I'm not here to support you.

670
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:04,760
Let's...

671
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,611
I'm here to arrest you, Pat.

672
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:19,483
It's a joke?

673
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,946
I don't think so.

674
00:39:25,568 --> 00:39:27,702
Cole Erickson's confession
didn't pan out.

675
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:31,579
He wasn't the anonymous caller.

676
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:36,034
At the time you got the second tip
from the burn phone,

677
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:40,921
Erickson... he was 50 miles away
talking to his mother on his PDA.

678
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,260
You placed those calls, Pat.

679
00:39:50,112 --> 00:39:52,662
When you were coming to meet me
at the Tidal Basin.

680
00:39:53,984 --> 00:39:57,375
- Jethro, I...
- No, you traded on our friendship.

681
00:39:58,024 --> 00:39:59,256
You did know

682
00:39:59,821 --> 00:40:02,610
that the investigation
of Commander McClellan's murder

683
00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:05,767
would lead to you.
So you came to me,

684
00:40:06,152 --> 00:40:08,248
and you volunteered the information.

685
00:40:12,425 --> 00:40:14,497
I should have known
I'd never get it by you.

686
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,109
- I shot Carrie.
- No, you didn't.

687
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,211
You said that I'd always know
when you were lying.

688
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:31,555
Well, you're lying right now.

689
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,087
- No. Why would I...?
- Don't say any more, Patrick.

690
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:40,481
Your mistake, Lynn, coming to me,

691
00:40:41,713 --> 00:40:44,652
saying to me that Pat
would never shoot anybody in the back.

692
00:40:46,793 --> 00:40:48,489
That detail was never released.

693
00:40:50,613 --> 00:40:52,243
You never should have gone to him.

694
00:40:55,548 --> 00:40:57,248
What the hell happened to you two?

695
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:01,210
I didn't go to Cole's apartment
to kill her.

696
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,990
I took my father's gun
to scare her off.

697
00:41:04,335 --> 00:41:06,597
She got defensive
and said terrible things.

698
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:08,267
I lost it.

699
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:10,776
I don't even remember
pulling the trigger.

700
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:14,293
I got there right after it happened.
I wasn't going to let Lynn

701
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:17,071
go to prison for something
that was ultimately my fault.

702
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:20,336
So when Cole got home,
I persuaded him

703
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:23,193
- to help me dispose of the body.
- Jethro...

704
00:41:25,184 --> 00:41:27,405
- it was an accident.
- Maybe...

705
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:32,252
but the murder of Cole Erickson
was cold and was premeditated.

706
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:33,396
Framed him.

707
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,870
Made it look like suicide
to save yourselves.

708
00:41:39,323 --> 00:41:40,415
You murdered him.

709
00:41:46,835 --> 00:41:50,844
- Do we need to leave with handcuffs?
- You are all out of favors, Pat.

710
00:41:55,828 --> 00:42:00,422
<i>Earlier today, NCIS agents arrested
Senator Patrick Kiley and his wife,</i>

711
00:42:00,482 --> 00:42:04,458
<i>Lynn Tripp Kiley, for the murders of
Lieutenant Commander Carrie McClellan</i>

712
00:42:04,518 --> 00:42:07,860
<i>and Cole Erickson,
the senator's chief of staff.</i>

713
00:42:08,857 --> 00:42:10,446
Welcome to Washington.

714
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:15,334
Would have appreciated a heads-up
before the arrest.

715
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,412
You covered good.

716
00:42:30,224 --> 00:42:31,227
Trust.

717
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,660
Loyalty.

718
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:40,180
They're important.

719
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:49,842
Guess you know all about that
after today.

720
00:42:53,894 --> 00:42:56,344
How do you think we're gonna do
in that department?
