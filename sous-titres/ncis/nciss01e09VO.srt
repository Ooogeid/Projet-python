00:00:02,955 --> 00:00:06,419
I told my lawyer I'd agree to mediation
if Magda dropped the preconditions.

2
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:09,252
I know. I know, mom.

3
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:11,385
But at least it's not
as ugly as divorce court.

4
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:16,798
Thanks, mom.
Yeah, I'm trying.

5
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:21,301
I love you, too. Bye.

Mornin', G.

9
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:54,071
- When did that happen?
- Hey, guys.

10
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,533
Well... who did this?

11
00:01:58,228 --> 00:01:59,174
Don't know.

12
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:02,163
- Where's all our stuff?
- Don't know.

13
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:04,945
- Think it's safe to go in.
- Don't know.

14
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:07,376
I'm saying I think
it's safe to go in.

15
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:10,663
Am I seeing assigned seats?

16
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,132
I'm here.

17
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:17,244
This is nice, nice!

18
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:18,933
Look,

19
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:21,140
they even sharpened my pencils.

20
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,403
Do you write with pencils?

21
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:26,007
Could be one
of Nate's psych experiments.

22
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:27,521
I'm not one of Nate's lab rats.

23
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:30,566
You ever known me to receive mail?

24
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:32,693
Send mail?

25
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,456
Organization and productivity
are directly correlated.

26
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,606
Cleanliness is next to...

27
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:43,944
Efficiency.

28
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,385
- So, you moved our stuff?
- I tried to stop her.

29
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:48,893
She's the only one...

30
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:56,399
Continue, Mr. Callen, continue.

31
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,311
With the authority...

32
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:04,788
If your comment
that "they might be miffed"

33
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,393
constitutes trying to stop me,

34
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,225
I suggest you learn
more forceful techniques

35
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,774
of self-assertion.
Not that I would have listened.

36
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:14,521
People, this is an office.

37
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:16,953
In so far as you have equipment

38
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:20,533
necessary to your duties,
you'll find it in your desks.

39
00:03:20,858 --> 00:03:23,035
In so far as you had "stuff",

40
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:26,455
you'll find it all upstairs
in trash bags.

41
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,338
- Most of it's Kensi's.
- You're welcome

42
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,126
to add a personal touch or two.

43
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:34,588
But let's not again have it
looking like a fraternity lounge.

44
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:36,674
Now, if you'll follow me,

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,848
we have work.

46
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:42,346
Chief Petty Officer Frank McEllon

47
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,000
was murdered last night.

48
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:46,348
He was one
of the Navy's top engineers.

49
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,395
He worked on super-cavitation.
Really cool technology.

50
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,238
Puts a bubble around a submarine,
quadruples its speed.

51
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,359
From 25 knots top speed
fully submerged to 100 knots.

52
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:58,010
- Nifty trick.
- A trick you'd want to keep secret.

53
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:00,539
Murder and possible espionage.

54
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,909
Both balls are in your court.

55
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,491
New bullpen's great?

56
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,390
An enlisted sailor lives here?

57
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:25,541
It's a little too upmarket,
isn't it?

58
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:27,224
Way upmarket.

59
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:31,267
Mobiles go over cribs, right?

60
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:35,296
- Looks like baby moved out.
- Probably not by herself.

61
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:38,652
The alarm system showed
this window open just before the murder.

62
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,919
There's a house directly behind us.
They have a security cam.

63
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:48,579
Thanks.

64
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:51,624
So, McEllon hears a noise,
then he comes in.

65
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,910
Killer takes him from behind,
no struggle.

66
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:55,799
McEllon's six foot.
So, the killer's strong,

67
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:57,546
- he's quiet.
- Knows how to use a knife.

68
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,340
Guys.

69
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:02,593
What do you see?

70
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:06,293
Dusted for prints,
but there aren't any.

71
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:09,099
This was the only window open,
so he came and went through here.

72
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,873
The whole crime scene is like this.

73
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:13,839
Do you know what the forensics
report is going to find?

74
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:14,939
Absolutely nothing.

75
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,692
No prints, fibers, hairs.
This guy didn't leave a trace.

76
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,612
Nanny cam.

77
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,113
With a front-row seat.

78
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,250
- OK, Eric.
- Keep looking, Dom.

79
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,110
- Dom's trying to track down his wi...
- Eric says that the window the kill...

80
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:30,837
- The killer split...
- The wife...

81
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:41,507
- Was I heads or tails?
- I'm not telling you.

82
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,011
The window that the killer used was not
covered by the security camera out back.

83
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,938
Our guy must've cased
the house first then.

84
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,986
But, Eric found
another camera next door.

85
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,060
Now, this is video
from four days ago.

86
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:56,259
He's running facial recognition,
but there's been no hits yet.

87
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:57,898
And now it's your turn, Sam.

88
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:00,567
McEllon's wife split
with the baby a month ago.

89
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:03,904
- Dom's still trying to track her down.
- Financials?

90
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,881
Turns out McEllon's money is clean.

91
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:08,682
He designed sub technology
before he joined the Navy.

92
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:10,885
His patents are lucrative.

93
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:13,623
Why would a wealthy engineer enlist?

94
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,380
Same reason Pat Tillman left
the NFL to join the army.

95
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,067
Patriotism.

96
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:20,087
McEllon signed on after 9/11.

97
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,965
So, a patriotic guy sells secrets?

98
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:24,800
That would make him unpatriotic.

99
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,201
You were tails, for the record.

100
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,013
Can I have my phone?
Thank you very much.

101
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,137
Feels weird.

102
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:36,795
I like it.

103
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,083
I'm over here,
you're way over there.

104
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,315
- You see the forensics report?
- No.

105
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,358
It's right there in your in-box.

106
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:50,457
I thought it was the out-box.

107
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:53,197
Kensi was right.
The killer left no DNA.

108
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,943
No fibers, no hairs,
no prints, nothing.

109
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:58,342
Never seen anything like it.

110
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,419
Thanks.

111
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,612
Director.

112
00:07:04,044 --> 00:07:06,350
<i>NSA completed a preliminary review.</i>

113
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:09,892
<i>Sub program's security protocols
do not appear to have been breached.</i>

114
00:07:10,787 --> 00:07:13,157
<i>Espionage or not,
this case is still a priority.</i>

115
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:17,081
<i>That's why I'm sending our top
forensic specialist to assist you.</i>

116
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:18,921
But there are no forensics.

117
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,133
<i>Our forensic expert has a theory
about this crime that's,</i>

118
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,734
<i>shall we say, original.</i>

119
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,552
<i>Thinks McEllon is the victim
of a serial killer.</i>

120
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,075
<i>No other law enforcement organization
in this country thinks</i>

121
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,612
<i>this killer even exists.</i>

122
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:34,244
<i>Can't say I do either.</i>

123
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:36,330
And you're sending this person why?

124
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:38,510
<i>I was ganged up on.</i>

125
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,049
Who gangs up on the director
of a federal agency?

126
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,510
You'd be surprised.

127
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:52,344
And who's the expert?

128
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:55,431
I think I took a wrong turn. Hello?

129
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:56,683
Abby? We're in here.

130
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:01,188
There you are. Hi.

131
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:05,150
This place is seriously cool.

132
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,734
- So, how do you...
- Double tap,

133
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:19,309
get the menu, fill the screen.

134
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:20,679
It's all very intuitive.

135
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:22,776
No wonder
McGee can't stop talking about this.

136
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:26,380
So, I'm sure Leon has told you
that I know who killed McEllon.

137
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,416
- Wait, you call him Leon?
- You don't?

138
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:29,758
Not successfully.

139
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:30,968
Give it time.

140
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,762
- You have a name for us, Abby?
- He's called "the Phantom".

141
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:36,890
- By whom?
- By me.

142
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:38,116
Anyone else?

143
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:39,518
Just me.

144
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,729
Well, I'm going
to leave you kids to it.

145
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,731
But I must say, Abby,

146
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,606
you are the first NCIS employee
I've ever met

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,237
with a sense of style.

148
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,197
You'd all do well

149
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,230
to note that one can be functional

150
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,459
and stylish at the same time.

151
00:08:58,842 --> 00:08:59,872
Right, Mr. Beale?

152
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:09,548
So, Abby, the forensics report
has no evidence of the killer.

153
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,649
That's why I call him the Phantom.

154
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,993
14 murders in two years.

155
00:09:14,035 --> 00:09:16,874
It took me a while
to see his pattern, but...

156
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,626
Pull up the list of his murders,
please.

157
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:22,394
This is a private web site
for forensic specialists.

158
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,646
Abby's a rock star among them.

159
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,354
I've been blogging
about him for a few months.

160
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:29,568
I'm trying to get local police
departments to pursue him.

161
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,630
A 67-year-old black female
poisoned in Tampa.

162
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:35,699
The killer left nothing.
No hair, no DNA, no fibers.

163
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,577
22-year-old white male
shot in Des Moines.

164
00:09:38,803 --> 00:09:42,289
- No trace of a killer.
- 37-year-old Asian female in Boise.

165
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,410
With a crowbar!

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,492
Do you know how hard it is to cudgel
someone to death with a crowbar

167
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,602
and leave no forensic evidence?

168
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:50,800
The cases with zero forensics
are rare.

169
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:53,884
Like every few years kind of rare.
And this is 14 in two years.

170
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:58,972
Have any of the local PD's
pursued this Phantom theory?

171
00:09:59,205 --> 00:10:00,599
Not one.
Can you believe that?

172
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:03,227
Serial killers are either organized

173
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,873
or disorganized. This guy's organized
in leaving no forensics.

174
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:08,288
But completely disorganized
in everything else.

175
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,275
Random victims, weapons, locations.

176
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,736
It just doesn't look like
one single killer.

177
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,227
He makes it look random on purpose.

178
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,075
That's how I knew
that McEllon was a Phantom victim.

179
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,087
Not just the no forensics part,
but he never repeats himself.

180
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:23,997
Like he's never cut the neck
of a 40-year-old white guy before.

181
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:30,069
- You've spent a lot of time on this.
- If you wanna get my attention,

182
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,589
show me a crime scene
and tell me there's no clues.

183
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,893
We have a clue.

184
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:36,032
This guy.

185
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,808
Casing the house,
three days before the murder.

186
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:46,375
He's not the kind of guy
to let himself get caught on camera.

187
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:49,189
But 3 days prior, scoping the place out?
Maybe he's finally slipped up.

188
00:10:57,906 --> 00:10:59,036
I'm just curious...

189
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,411
why you pressured Vance
to send Abby.

190
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:06,435
He wasn't buying her Phantom theory.

191
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:08,477
He needed goosing.

192
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:11,586
So you want us chasing the Phantom?

193
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,339
Is that what you think?

194
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,695
I don't know.

195
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:18,586
There's...

196
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:21,565
There's been some meddling
around here,

197
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,649
I'm a little fuzzy
on the command chain.

198
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:30,602
This case lacks forensics.

199
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:32,970
As your operations manager,

200
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:35,749
I procured for you
our best scientist.

201
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,695
To help you.

202
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:39,948
You, as head agent, are free

203
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:44,286
to pursue whatever theory of crime
makes the most sense.

204
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,929
There's no fuzziness, Callen.

205
00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:50,259
You still shoot the ducks.

206
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:52,876
I just row the boat.

207
00:11:57,504 --> 00:11:59,017
What is he holding, a rabbit?

208
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:01,011
He misses his little girl.

209
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:02,106
Hang on.

210
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:04,169
Let me see here, and here.

211
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:08,060
It's the same fabric,
top and bottom.

212
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:08,977
Overalls?

213
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:11,480
It's a full bodysuit.
That explains it!

214
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:13,815
He doesn't leave it,
he takes it with him!

215
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:17,508
- Takes what with him?
- Hair, and fibers, and skin.

216
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:19,821
Evidence.

217
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,491
Every day we lose

218
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,853
50,000 dead epidermal cells.
That's 1.5 pounds per year.

219
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,580
- We have to go to this crime scene.
- The crime scene is done.

220
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,999
- And they found nothing.
- So you want to go, why?

221
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:33,895
Because I think
I can find something.

222
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:36,546
All right.

223
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:39,319
CSI guys tracked through dirt.

224
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:41,343
The scene's completely contaminated.

225
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:44,057
I'm not looking
for footprints that leave dirt,

226
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:45,997
I'm looking for footprints
that remove dirt.

227
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:49,324
So you're thinking that...

228
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:51,315
Come with me.

229
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,857
Smart thinking, Abby.
You live up to the hype.

230
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:58,482
Dom found e-mails from Magda McEllon
threatening to kill her husband.

231
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:01,696
- I'm going to need to talk to her.
- Got to find her first.

232
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:04,032
Yo, Callen, Sam. In here.

233
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,618
So, most footwear

234
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,048
is electrically neutral.

235
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,983
But some bodysuits
made for chemical workers or doctors,

236
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:13,041
they have
a tiny electrostatic charge.

237
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,147
Electrostatic charges,
they pick up dust.

238
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:18,338
Just like those dust cloths
you see advertised on late night TV.

239
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,092
- You know about cleaning products?
- You watch late night TV?

240
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:25,679
I can get the full pattern
from his bootee in this dust here,

241
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,931
then I can find you
the make and a manufacturer.

242
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:32,352
- Thank you, Abby Sciuto.
- You're welcome, G. Callen.

243
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:37,394
So where do we start
looking for Magda McEllon?

244
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:43,738
Zuggler-Smith.

245
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:46,747
- I hate lawyers.
- Ms. Jenkins has left for lunch.

246
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:48,869
I told you she said the restaurant.

247
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:56,751
- There she is.
- Enjoy your lunch.

248
00:13:57,345 --> 00:13:58,237
Thank you.

249
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,967
My job, I deal with a lot of jerks.

250
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:03,042
Frank McEllon was a real gentleman.

251
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:06,695
Even to his wife, who demanded
two-thirds of his submarine patents...

252
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:08,928
Things he had invented
before they even met.

253
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,112
- You advised him to fight.
- With the future value, hell, yes.

254
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,954
They're already a gravy train
if he can afford to hire you.

255
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,634
You're cute.

256
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,003
Frank told me they'd be worth
a lot more soon.

257
00:14:21,022 --> 00:14:24,403
Top secret and all, but that had
to mean the Navy liked his inventions.

258
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:25,918
That's a lucky wife.

259
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,600
- She's a widow, not an ex.
- So Magda McEllon gets it all.

260
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:31,621
So...

261
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:34,880
When your people went to serve her
with the papers, where'd they go?

262
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:58,162
Five years married to a button.
Down Navy guy.

263
00:14:58,204 --> 00:15:01,875
She splits, moves down here
to get a taste of the crazies.

264
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,986
- I used to live here.
- You and crazy speaks for itself.

265
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:07,767
That's her.

266
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:09,574
She's fast.

267
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:11,409
Fast for a short girl.

268
00:15:12,062 --> 00:15:14,313
- I said she's fast.
- I said she's short.

269
00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:17,543
Nanny cam, McEllon's killer was
the same height as he was.

270
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,866
She's got the motive,
she's just not tall enough.

271
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:22,436
But he is.

272
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:27,551
That's the guy that was casing
McEllon's house.

273
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:31,979
Boyfriend-girlfriend.

274
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:34,391
She's not even divorced yet.

275
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:40,063
- Other partners after I was shot?
- I'm a loyal guy, G.

276
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:44,276
- Think lover boy over there's loyal?
- Loyal enough to do Magda's bidding?

277
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:47,700
- What do you think, ten bucks?
- Don't do it.

278
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:52,576
Is that a casual walking away or...

279
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,440
a I-see-two-guys-that-may-
be-law-enforcement walking away?

280
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,372
I might look like law enforcement.

281
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,563
- What do I look like?
- Like you grew up here.

282
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,153
Watch out!

283
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:51,373
You hurt?

284
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,499
Good.

285
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:08,369
There's Magda McEllon.

286
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,987
- I'll talk, you get the video.
- Okay.

287
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,533
Make sure you zoom in
on her reaction.

288
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:18,636
You're on.

289
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:26,644
- So what's your name?
- Cyrus Hill.

290
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:31,085
That's funny.
You don't actually look like a Cyrus.

291
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:33,706
Facial recognition says
that your name is Ted Brock.

292
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:39,348
Why'd you run?

293
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:41,542
I thought
you were going to steal my stuff.

294
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,853
It had nothing to do
with the 2 outstanding arrest warrants?

295
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:47,926
So, basically,
what you do is you butter up rich ladies

296
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,703
and then you steal their things.

297
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,029
What I want to know is,
where were you last night?

298
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,666
I had a date.

299
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,705
With Magda McEllon.

300
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:58,113
Magda McEllon?

301
00:17:59,206 --> 00:18:01,243
Hi.
I'm Special Agent Kensi Blye.

302
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:03,851
I need to speak with you.
Please have a seat.

303
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,220
This is difficult.

304
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:14,509
I'm sorry to have to tell you,
but...

305
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:19,472
Your husband was murdered
last night.

306
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:23,966
- I'm sorry.
- My god.

307
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:26,790
How?

308
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:28,475
Where?

309
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:30,900
In his house.

310
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:38,013
I'm really sorry,
but I need to ask you this.

311
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:39,868
Where were you last night?

312
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:42,328
I took Magda to dinner at the Ivy.

313
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:45,832
I was here, with Lilly, my baby.

314
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:49,043
- And Lilly?
- She hired a babysitter.

315
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:51,129
<i>We only have child care daytimes.</i>

316
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,340
I'll take her story over his.

317
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,134
Facial cues: eyebrows, parted lips.

318
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,940
Her surprise is genuine.
She didn't know.

319
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:01,902
She just skewered his alibi,
let's get to motive.

320
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,696
Tell me something.

321
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:05,958
How long have you known this man?

322
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:09,952
A few weeks.
Why?

323
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:13,985
Actually, his name is Ted.

324
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:18,165
I'm guessing that you wanted
the submarine patents that

325
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:20,393
Magda would get
if her husband was dead.

326
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:23,838
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

327
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,955
Did you tell Ted
about your husband's patents?

328
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:32,045
Yes.
By mistake. I was...

329
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,881
<i>pissed off after a phone call
from Frank's lawyer.</i>

330
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,341
He knows about the patents.

331
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,474
- Magda just called you a liar.
- She's out there?

332
00:19:43,157 --> 00:19:45,391
- She can hear me?
- You weren't with her last night.

333
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,425
You knew about the patents and
that she might lose them in the divorce.

334
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:51,314
You went to McEllon's house last night,
and you killed him.

335
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:54,888
Now she is a rich widow,
and she dates you.

336
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:58,446
That isn't true.
Magda! I didn't kill anybody!

337
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,031
You cased the house 4 days ago.

338
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,284
The security camera
across the street.

339
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,787
You picked a different window last night
when you killed him.

340
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,998
- I didn't kill him!
- Then why did you case the house, Ted?

341
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:13,201
Magda said he kept
ten grand in bearer bonds.

342
00:20:13,736 --> 00:20:15,630
I saw the security camera.
I didn't go in.

343
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,923
I'm not a B&E guy.

344
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:19,217
Where were you last night?

345
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:22,720
Brentwood.

346
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:28,969
- Lady friend.
- She rich?

347
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,137
- What happened to lover boy Brock?
- He was what he said he was.

348
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,433
So we turned him over to LAPD
for those outstanding warrants.

349
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,486
- And back to square one.
- Magda's not involved,

350
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:46,397
we've pretty much
ruled out espionage.

351
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:49,785
We have a killer who wears fancy suits
and studies security cams.

352
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:51,332
We're missing motive.

353
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,703
Maybe because it's random.

354
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,257
- Abby got you on board?
- He wishes.

355
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:03,299
Do you guys know
about the birthday paradox?

356
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:05,101
Abby discusses it on her blog.

357
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:08,761
How many people
do you need in a room

358
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:11,352
to have an even chance that 2 of them
have the same birthday?

359
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,374
I don't know.
182 and a half.

360
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:15,770
Only 23.

361
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:20,884
And with 57 people it's a 99% chance
that two of them have the same birthday.

362
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:23,948
True randomness includes repeats.

363
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,698
A truly random group of murders

364
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,744
would have at least
two white males in their 20s.

365
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,336
Or two gunshot deaths. Or two stabbing
deaths. But there are no repeats.

366
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:33,600
It's hard to do.

367
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:35,752
If the M.O.
is to make it all appear random,

368
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:39,047
why kill McEllon when there are
so many other easy targets?

369
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,342
And if it is the Phantom,
then he changed his M.O.

370
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,263
Now, why would he do that?

371
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:51,976
Good news. Flagstaff PD's going back
to their crime scene.

372
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:55,449
Jose Pignon, electrocuted in his bathtub
five weeks ago.

373
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:58,388
I told them to look for dust prints.
I hope nobody cleaned the floor.

374
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:02,889
That's the bootee pattern?

375
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,240
Yep. It was left inversely in the dust
on the floor at the McEllons' house.

376
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:10,036
It's a pattern from a haz-mat suit
made by ProtectorSuits, Inc.

377
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,117
I e-mailed them for a distribution list,
but they're not open till morning.

378
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:21,033
So, then, if we have to wait until...
until morning, then...

379
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:22,966
Are you trying to ask me out?

380
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,019
- Yeah.
- Okay, just checking. Go ahead.

381
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:33,476
Maybe a drink at, say, SteamPunk?

382
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:36,335
It's only the coolest place
I wanted to go,

383
00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:38,313
but never been
west of the Mississippi. Yes.

384
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:44,189
- How did you know about SteamPunk?
- You mentioned it online somewhere.

385
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:47,093
You've been reading my blog...
a lot.

386
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,352
Along with seeing this awesome club,

387
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:13,808
I also want to see the museum of
Jurassic technology and the car museum.

388
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,060
Have you seen out back?
There's hot rods everywhere.

389
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:19,480
This is where they hang out.
That's what makes this place so cool.

390
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,075
And I want to see an earthquake.

391
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,236
I know you can't see an earthquake,
but I want to feel one.

392
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,821
The whole earth shaking?

393
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:29,831
Just a small one,
where no people or animals get hurt.

394
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:33,178
- But doesn't it feel cool?
- I guess it feels kind of funky.

395
00:23:33,782 --> 00:23:35,204
When no one gets hurt.

396
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:38,179
Do you want another...
Whatever this is?

397
00:23:39,306 --> 00:23:40,491
You're on refills.

398
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:44,380
I'm going to go check out
the hot rods.

399
00:23:47,463 --> 00:23:49,691
Flagstaff PD found
footprints in the dust.

400
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:51,160
Same size, same pattern.

401
00:23:51,452 --> 00:23:54,640
- Abby's right... The Phantom's real.
- My god, I am buying that woman a beer.

402
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,101
I'll buy her a brewery,
but I still need to know, why McEllon?

403
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,772
The Phantom's other victims
were all easier targets.

404
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,230
That's not the only difference.

405
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,889
All the other cases happened
in smaller cities with PDs

406
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:06,900
that didn't have the resources
to nationalize the case.

407
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,702
But now Los Angeles?

408
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:10,609
Second biggest PD in the country.

409
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:12,406
And he gets NCIS involved.

410
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,816
A federal agency.
That's not random.

411
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,622
You hit McEllon because of NCIS.

412
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:20,083
But what does that get you,
other than caught.

413
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:22,877
It gets you Abby Sciuto.

414
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,936
The one person calling attention to you
when you're trying

415
00:24:30,978 --> 00:24:33,596
- like hell to stay off the radar.
- He must have had access to her blog.

416
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:37,141
She only reported her Phantom theory
on her closed forum.

417
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:39,949
He hacks into that,
sees that she's a threat,

418
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,770
kills someone from the Navy
to draw her out.

419
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:43,981
Where is she?

420
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,298
They went to a bar.

421
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,614
A place
she talked about before online.

422
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:57,120
- Eric.
- Hey, Callen.

423
00:24:57,942 --> 00:25:00,262
You guys should come down here.
This place is awesome.

424
00:25:02,662 --> 00:25:03,372
What?

425
00:25:34,356 --> 00:25:37,478
- <i>Where was she abducted?</i>
- In a dark parking lot, Leon.

426
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:41,238
No video, and so far, no witnesses.

427
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,144
<i>Nate, I want brass tacks.</i>

428
00:25:43,186 --> 00:25:46,128
The good news is, he abducted her
instead of killing her outright.

429
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,519
Probably wants to gloat
and show her he's superior.

430
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:52,057
The bad news is,
she does pose a major threat to him,

431
00:25:52,587 --> 00:25:54,665
so he will kill her.
Probably soon.

432
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,993
<i>All right.</i>

433
00:25:57,061 --> 00:25:58,347
<i>You keep me in the loop.</i>

434
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:00,658
<i>Gibbs and his team are
en route to Manassas airport.</i>

435
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,873
<i>He's trying to get a favor
with the FBI to borrow their G5.</i>

436
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,022
<i>He'll be with you by midday.</i>

437
00:26:06,527 --> 00:26:08,275
Let's pray Abby has that long.

438
00:26:19,123 --> 00:26:20,583
Excuse me, excuse me.

439
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:30,593
Excuse me.
Have you seen this woman?

440
00:26:32,411 --> 00:26:34,050
Hey! I'm talking to you.

441
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,835
I don't care,
big muggle cop without a warrant.

442
00:26:36,877 --> 00:26:38,931
Listen!
I don't know what "muggle" means,

443
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:41,126
but I don't have time for this,
Marilyn Manson.

444
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:42,559
Sam, let's do this all at once.

445
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,668
Hi.

446
00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:53,695
This woman was abducted
from here 30 minutes ago.

447
00:26:54,073 --> 00:26:55,383
Anyone see anything?

448
00:26:57,935 --> 00:26:59,487
Anyone?
We need your help.

449
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:04,596
She was here with a blonde dude.

450
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,223
Creepy-looking guy in flip-flops.

451
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,294
He's okay.

452
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:11,440
Anyone else? Please.

453
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:15,146
Anyone?
Her name is Abby.

454
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:16,977
Please, we need your help.

455
00:27:22,927 --> 00:27:23,695
Please.

456
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:26,190
She's a friend of mine.

457
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:31,029
Guy came in yesterday.
Gave me this.

458
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:35,444
He said she was an old friend.
Asked me to text him if she came in.

459
00:27:36,412 --> 00:27:37,571
He gave me 100 bucks.

460
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:40,199
What did he look like?

461
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,786
Like you. Like the blonde guy
she was here with.

462
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:45,246
He and I don't really look alike.

463
00:27:45,507 --> 00:27:47,624
I'm sorry.
All muggles look the same.

464
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,570
We've identified every person
who's had access

465
00:27:53,612 --> 00:27:55,737
to Abby's online forum, except one.

466
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:58,927
Check out Mike287.
He mentions SteamPunk.

467
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,845
He suggests that she'd love it.

468
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,806
Post is 2 months old, which means
he's been planning it for that long.

469
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,266
He's setting a lot of bait.

470
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:08,061
Who is Mike287?
Come on, guys. Bust down his door.

471
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,846
Poses as Mike Kinkirk,
L.A. County criminalist.

472
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:12,815
The real Kinkirk has been
in hospice for months.

473
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,401
He's using onion routers to hide
the computer he posts from,

474
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,412
but I'm pretty sure
he's actually in L.A.

475
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:19,701
That makes sense.
All this planning to lure out Abby,

476
00:28:19,743 --> 00:28:22,956
and like Callen was saying, it's more
work than he's ever had to do before.

477
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:24,725
Easier to do it in a familiar place.

478
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:25,888
Home-field advantage.

479
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:28,331
The encrypted phone
that the bar woman sent the text

480
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,208
to belongs to Zuggler-Smith.
That's McEllon's law firm.

481
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:34,369
They bought 30 secure phones
for their attorneys six months ago.

482
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:35,842
That's not all they bought.

483
00:28:35,884 --> 00:28:38,258
They took delivery
of a whole bunch of haz-mat suits.

484
00:28:38,823 --> 00:28:40,802
Deliveries going back two years.

485
00:28:41,068 --> 00:28:42,929
That's when the Phantom
started killing.

486
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,430
- So, he's a lawyer?
- Figures.

487
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,865
But which lawyer?
Doesn't say who actually

488
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:49,477
received the suits, and we don't know
who the firm issued the phone to.

489
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:53,286
- I'm firing up the ops center now.
- Law firm's our only lead.

490
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:55,481
We go undercover.

491
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:06,683
Are you comfortable?

492
00:29:09,513 --> 00:29:10,715
I can't move.

493
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:13,209
It's...
just a little chemical...

494
00:29:15,145 --> 00:29:17,922
It's just a little chemical restraint.
It'll wear off slowly.

495
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:20,716
You'll start feeling
your fingers and your toes first.

496
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:24,054
So, it's not quite a creepy dungeon.

497
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:25,972
I made it for you, Abby.

498
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:28,249
You who named me.

499
00:29:29,732 --> 00:29:30,542
Phantom.

500
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:33,396
If I could have caught you,
I would have.

501
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,769
And yet, I caught you.

502
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:39,290
You went right where
I asked you to go.

503
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:41,913
You're Mike287.

504
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:47,938
You making a little Abby movie?

505
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,032
That's for watching you
when I go to work.

506
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:53,541
I took the day off today
so we could be together.

507
00:29:54,771 --> 00:29:56,377
After all, Abby,

508
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,254
we're a team.

509
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,215
There's no "I" in your team.

510
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,758
You'll resist at first,

511
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,927
and maybe
I'll wait for you to come around.

512
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,386
Or...

513
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:08,477
maybe I won't.

514
00:30:08,752 --> 00:30:11,121
The only people coming around
are my friends.

515
00:30:11,498 --> 00:30:13,537
And they're going
to smash through the door...

516
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,160
wherever the door is...

517
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:18,547
and they're going to put you
in prison where you belong.

518
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,825
- Creep.
- Couple of things.

519
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:25,174
First, anyone comes in here,
the place bursts into flames.

520
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:26,973
Butane.

521
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,576
And second,

522
00:30:29,071 --> 00:30:32,163
- I'm good at what I do.
- Definition of the opposite of good.

523
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:33,444
In part,

524
00:30:34,184 --> 00:30:35,369
thanks to you.

525
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:38,598
I won't wear the suit
on smooth floors anymore.

526
00:30:38,988 --> 00:30:41,041
There will be
no more Phantom footprints.

527
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,252
I didn't blog about that.

528
00:30:43,294 --> 00:30:45,093
No, you told flagstaff PD.

529
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,554
They posted it when they found them.

530
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:49,563
And, by the way,

531
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:51,823
don't... call me...

532
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:53,125
a creep!

533
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:56,330
You're right.

534
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:00,483
We just met.
It's not polite to judge.

535
00:31:02,763 --> 00:31:03,570
I just...

536
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,434
I have this... this itch.
It's...

537
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,355
right on the tip of my nose.

538
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:10,785
Could you just help me, please?

539
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,273
Don't you dare!

540
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:34,877
Calm...

541
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,591
Calm.

542
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:38,207
That's what you look like.

543
00:31:47,857 --> 00:31:49,409
Who's better, Zuggler or Smith?

544
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:52,491
- For what, ma'am?
- For getting every stinking penny.

545
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,249
You've come to the right place.
Have a seat, please.

546
00:32:00,493 --> 00:32:02,429
I don't believe it.

547
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:04,505
I was here first, you weasel.

548
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:07,174
You're going to spend
my money to screw me out of my money?

549
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,011
You're going to want to crawl back
to the sewer you came from.

550
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,302
- All right, that's it.
- Don't do it. Don't touch me.

551
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:14,182
Give back my purse.
Don't touch me!

552
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,141
Fine.

553
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,809
See if they take your business.

554
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,064
How are you going to pay the retainer?
I froze you out of all the accounts.

555
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:23,436
Or maybe they'll take
in-kind contributions,

556
00:32:23,478 --> 00:32:25,297
like you so freely gave
to the pool guy.

557
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:26,876
- Shut up.
- And the gardener.

558
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:29,263
And the driver,
and the personal trainer.

559
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,073
Security to the front, please.

560
00:32:32,225 --> 00:32:33,836
- You are crazy...
- No, no!

561
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:35,537
- No, no, no.
- You are crazy!

562
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,114
Get off of me!

563
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:37,870
Sir!

564
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:40,708
- Easy, miss. Easy.
- Let her go.

565
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,877
Go back into your offices.
It's under control.

566
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,338
I'm in.
Which way do I go, Eric?

567
00:32:45,648 --> 00:32:47,840
Okay, I think you want
the last room on your left.

568
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:49,053
You think?

569
00:32:49,095 --> 00:32:50,884
<i>It's not like we had
a lot of time to plan.</i>

570
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,763
I hacked the surveillance system,
buzzed through a lot of old video,

571
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,808
<i> and caught a woman giving out
a cell phone. She's the chief admin.</i>

572
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,274
<i>She keeps a roster
in her right desk drawer.</i>

573
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:00,843
<i>It's the best I got.</i>

574
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:13,887
Capturing video now.

575
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,578
Got it.

576
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,254
- I'll do it, Ms. Jenkins.
- By tomorrow.

577
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,207
Hey, how are you?
We had a little thing up front.

578
00:33:35,677 --> 00:33:37,701
- Hey, Kensi?
- On her way back.

579
00:33:37,743 --> 00:33:39,475
<i>I found who the phone
was signed out to.</i>

580
00:33:39,965 --> 00:33:42,845
Mike Smith, founding partner.
I hacked into his computer,

581
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,230
it's been idle for two days.
I don't think he's been at work.

582
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:49,235
He logs on as Mike287
and visits Abby's blog regularly.

583
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,897
I'm sending you his license.

584
00:33:52,183 --> 00:33:53,935
Address is 287 Bruckner.

585
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:55,274
Mike287.

586
00:33:58,017 --> 00:33:58,827
Oh, boy.

587
00:34:00,931 --> 00:34:01,955
Abby's alive!

588
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:05,626
He's streaming live video from his house
to his computer at work.

589
00:34:05,904 --> 00:34:08,390
At least I hope it's live.
He's with her.

590
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,172
All right, we're ten minutes out.

591
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,550
Hold on, hold on.
This can't be his house.

592
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,594
The room looks like
it doesn't have any windows.

593
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,554
<i>It's gotta be a commercial space.
I'm...</i>

594
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,231
Yeah, 458 North Fig.

595
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:23,675
The law office is expanding
to the building next door.

596
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:26,397
- <i>Smith owns it.</i>
- We're standing right in front of it.

597
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,348
Eric said no windows.

598
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:37,042
Basement!

599
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,638
He's moving towards her.

600
00:34:56,058 --> 00:34:58,127
Mike Smith.
He's not the Phantom.

601
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,165
We're in the wrong place.

602
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:03,170
So was he.

603
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,952
He's been dead two
or three days, Eric.

604
00:35:16,994 --> 00:35:18,543
The Phantom works in the law firm.

605
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:20,576
Smith, his boss,
gets suspicious so he kills him.

606
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:22,995
I bet there's no forensics
in there either.

607
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:25,164
Sam, we got him.
Check your phone.

608
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:28,858
<i>Mike287 posts
from Smith's work computer.</i>

609
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,821
At those specific time codes,
we found this guy.

610
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:35,257
- The receptionist.
- Front desk at the law firm.

611
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:37,618
Male receptionist is Tom Smith.

612
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:39,344
Your dead guy's his uncle Mike.

613
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:42,556
If the boss is your uncle,
you have the run of the place.

614
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,621
Wherever he's got Abby, he's probably
got the run of that place, too.

615
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:48,578
Okay, there's nothing in Tom's name,
but his uncle has a doz...

616
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,280
Had a dozen real estate holdings.

617
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:52,603
Office buildings, warehouses,
it could be any of them.

618
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:53,776
<i>We check them all out.</i>

619
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,262
We'll take half, Kensi and Dom,
you take the other half.

620
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:58,030
<i>Eric, find out if</i>
LAPD can lend a hand.

621
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,866
- Already on it.
- <i>And Eric.</i> Eyes on Abby?

622
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:03,702
Still streaming.

623
00:36:07,654 --> 00:36:08,791
What's the bed for?

624
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,421
To you, who empower me.

625
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,966
He's toasting her?
I thought he was gonna gloat.

626
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,802
What's with the wine and the bed?

627
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:23,555
Men love women who appreciate them,
and she alone has appreciated him.

628
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,140
I don't buy it.

629
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,253
He's too smart.

630
00:36:26,697 --> 00:36:29,351
He knows she's his downfall.
He knows that she won't come around.

631
00:36:29,393 --> 00:36:31,120
At best he's just playing with her.

632
00:36:31,596 --> 00:36:34,275
- Playing like chess?
- More like a bear with a salmon.

633
00:36:36,997 --> 00:36:39,559
- You must have been good at math.
- Good at everything.

634
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:41,802
Tampa?
That was your first?

635
00:36:44,262 --> 00:36:45,285
My fifth.

636
00:36:46,825 --> 00:36:48,311
So, what four did I miss?

637
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:50,243
Well, they were before the suit.

638
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:52,562
My first was in Chico.

639
00:36:53,572 --> 00:36:54,878
My first human, I mean.

640
00:36:55,453 --> 00:36:57,973
Animals. Before that,
there were dozens of animals.

641
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:00,843
That's how I knew
I was built for this,

642
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:05,260
really, I just couldn't stop
killing animals.

643
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:08,600
It was such intense pleasure.

644
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:10,421
It's not fun.

645
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:12,432
It's awful.

646
00:37:13,158 --> 00:37:14,402
And you are awful.

647
00:37:15,837 --> 00:37:18,610
Every person and animal
that you killed had a life,

648
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,837
and people that loved them
and deserved them alive.

649
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:24,576
I'm not on your side.

650
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:28,412
I've never been on your side,
and I will never be on your side.

651
00:37:30,144 --> 00:37:30,873
I know.

652
00:37:33,273 --> 00:37:34,842
But it was fun to pretend.

653
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:38,145
Do you want to pretend?

654
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:41,401
Buy yourself another night of life?

655
00:37:42,744 --> 00:37:44,822
After all,
you'll be able to move soon.

656
00:37:47,371 --> 00:37:49,173
- Look at that.
- Yeah.

657
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:54,897
And look at this.

658
00:37:57,862 --> 00:37:59,489
Four down, eight to go.
<i>Kensi?</i>

659
00:37:59,906 --> 00:38:01,848
Make that five down, <i>seven to go.</i>

660
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,655
Got two black
and whites dispatching now.

661
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,283
We don't have time to search all seven,
even with local PD.

662
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,816
<i>Find where that camera is now!</i>

663
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:09,593
Camera's fixed, there's no swing.

664
00:38:10,076 --> 00:38:11,663
Wait, I do have zoom.

665
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,919
Zoom out.
Go wide so we can see the building.

666
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,378
I don't believe it. She's signing
to the camera, that's sign!

667
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,589
- Do you read sign language?
- Since I was seven.

668
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:22,326
She's finger spelling.

669
00:38:22,451 --> 00:38:24,632
All right, "noise" something.

670
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:28,388
I can't read. It's like when someone's
mumbling. Her fingers are slurred.

671
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,525
"Noise..."

672
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,018
"Construction noise!"
That's half the message.

673
00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:35,671
Then start looking
for construction sites.

674
00:38:37,257 --> 00:38:39,518
Callen, there's a warehouse
on the corner of 6th and

675
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,980
Ardmore owned by Smith,
<i>construction down the block.</i>

676
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:43,227
On our way.

677
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:48,184
The truth is, you're just not
smart enough for me, Abby.

678
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:51,286
Because you're there and I'm here.

679
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:54,881
And now
the great forensic specialist dies

680
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,000
without any evidence of her killer.

681
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:00,829
And it will be fun for me.

682
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,010
<i>I've almost got
the second half of the message.</i>

683
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:07,479
<i>It's "noise"...</i>

684
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,717
<i>"doors..." doors?</i>

685
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:12,683
<i>"Noise, doors..."</i>

686
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,812
<i>"Doors." It's...</i>

687
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:18,522
- <i>It's...</i>
- Wait.

688
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:19,940
- Guys, stop!
- Wire.

689
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:24,069
<i>Abby's signing "construction noise,
doors booby-trapped".</i>

690
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,421
How we getting in?

691
00:39:28,147 --> 00:39:30,133
Skylight, fire escape north side.

692
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:34,376
I'll leave,

693
00:39:34,885 --> 00:39:36,680
trip the door fuse remotely,

694
00:39:37,237 --> 00:39:38,581
place will go kaboom,

695
00:39:39,223 --> 00:39:42,004
and the Phantom remains traceless.

696
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:45,465
- You're not traceless.
- Come on, Abby.

697
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:48,468
You know butane burns hot enough
to destroy evidence.

698
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:51,596
You have my teeth marks
in your finger.

699
00:39:53,984 --> 00:39:54,850
Creep.

700
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:15,114
Miami?

701
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:18,165
No, Miami was half the height,
and we still got all busted up.

702
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:21,213
One of us may land soft enough
and get the shot.

703
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:22,836
Yeah, if one of us is Peter Pan.

704
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:26,418
I saved the white-woman-in-her-late-20's
slot for you.

705
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:29,593
Guys!

706
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:31,762
You should be honored.

707
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,807
Guys, gotta go now!

708
00:40:57,862 --> 00:41:00,248
You've got to lay off
the doughnuts, buddy.

709
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,094
You okay?

710
00:41:12,405 --> 00:41:13,225
Yeah.

711
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:17,224
Thank you, G. Callen.

712
00:41:19,037 --> 00:41:20,507
You're welcome, Abby Sciuto.

713
00:41:23,729 --> 00:41:26,758
Des Moines PD got a traffic-cam shot
of Smith near the crime scene.

714
00:41:26,892 --> 00:41:30,430
And Tampa PD found him on a flight
manifest, leaving after the murder.

715
00:41:31,073 --> 00:41:34,396
You've solved 15 murders in
as many hours, Abby. How's that feel?

716
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:37,023
Almost as good as being alive.

717
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:40,292
I lowered him down.
And you did it perfectly.

718
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:45,174
The post-incident medical evaluation
is not optional.

719
00:41:45,825 --> 00:41:47,686
They're waiting for you.
Go, go.

720
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,882
I'm so sorry, but there's something way
more important that I have to do first.

721
00:41:51,744 --> 00:41:54,636
- What could possibly...?
- Abby, on screen in 30 seconds.

722
00:41:55,107 --> 00:41:55,817
That.

723
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:21,655
Gibbs, Gibbs, I'm okay!
I know you were coming to save me.

724
00:42:21,697 --> 00:42:25,326
But these guys, they were amazing,
really. I mean...

725
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,622
You should see
what they can do with a fire hose.

726
00:42:27,664 --> 00:42:29,975
McGee, you were so right
about how cool this place is.

727
00:42:30,017 --> 00:42:32,340
I mean, not as cool as home,
'cause nothing's as cool as home.

728
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,045
I can't wait to see you guys again.

729
00:42:34,087 --> 00:42:36,636
It was scary and all, but we got him!
We got the Phantom!

730
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,139
Amazing! I mean, really...

731
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:43,226
I know there's a small fee. We're going
to lend you some resources to search for

732
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,707
evidence that Smith was there
around the time of the...

733
00:42:45,749 --> 00:42:48,968
You're going to tell me that I should
have consulted you before...

734
00:42:51,953 --> 00:42:54,696
My team's getting half
a day's desk work done in half an hour.

735
00:42:57,289 --> 00:42:58,549
You row pretty good.

736
00:43:00,902 --> 00:43:01,662
Thanks.

737
