<i>You see what Carolyn
was wearing today, man?</i>

3
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:07,481
<i>Damn, she's hot.</i>

4
00:00:07,846 --> 00:00:09,160
Today's the day, man.

5
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:10,764
I'm gonna ask her out.

6
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:13,297
Just got to figure out how
to get a few minutes alone with her.

7
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:14,691
<i>Know what I'm saying?</i>

8
00:00:15,176 --> 00:00:17,760
<i>Hey, Richie,
you forgot to sign your timecard.</i>

9
00:00:17,906 --> 00:00:20,459
Sorry about that, Carolyn.
I'll be right down.

10
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:22,469
Dude, what are you doing?

11
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:23,834
<i>The bro rule!</i>

12
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:25,388
I called dibs.

13
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,190
Survival of the fittest, my man.

14
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,014
You ain't got a shot.

15
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:31,755
<i>What the...?</i>

16
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:33,733
<i>Hey, come on, Mike.</i>

17
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,550
I just want one date, come on.

00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:12,943
<i>Well, I'm not exactly sure how it works.</i>

23
00:01:12,944 --> 00:01:15,098
Yeah, that's why I'm
not in charge of that.

24
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,624
<i>What's going on here?</i>

25
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,247
Did I get off on the wrong floor?
I thought this was an office.

26
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,426
<i>Officer David and I</i>
are engaged in a linguistic

27
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:26,238
developmental exercise intended
to bolster her English vocabulary.

28
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:28,413
That's good.
<i>You think Gibbs will buy it?</i>

29
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:31,877
It is not my vocabulary
that needs bolsterment, McGee.

30
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:34,363
- Not a word... <i>hence the scoreboard.
- No.</i>

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,615
<i>50-point cushion for the professor,</i>

32
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,128
<i>and there's only </i>one tile left to play.

33
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:42,321
<i>Gonna be kind of tough</i>
to play that "Q" without a "U".

34
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:44,702
- You peeked.
- Did not.

35
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:47,354
Process of elimination.
I counted the tiles on the board.

36
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:49,675
You suck the fun out
of everything, McCheat.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,824
<i>Give it up, Ziva.</i>

38
00:01:58,172 --> 00:01:59,053
"Kwee"?

39
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:00,721
- I don't think so.
- "Chi",

40
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:03,504
as in the life energy that flows
through all things.

41
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,906
You should've seen that one coming,
Probie Wan-Kenobi.

42
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:06,786
No.

43
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:09,077
62 points!

44
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:11,124
- Jedi wins.
- I'm challenging.

45
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,859
<i>You all are. </i>Grab your gear.
<i>Playtime's over.</i>

46
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:20,360
<i>That was a...
a language exercise, boss.</i>

47
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:23,501
- We weren't actually playing.
- So McGee didn't actually lose.

48
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:24,543
Correct.

49
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,371
So he's not actually humiliated.

50
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,380
"Kwee".

51
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,136
Did you know him?

52
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,511
Wasn't one of our guys.

53
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:37,457
Had the same crew on
here since the beginning.

54
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:39,422
<i>- What's the job?
- Retrofitting.</i>

55
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:41,073
Building's only ten years old.

56
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,212
Yeah, well,
they don't make them like they used to.

57
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,329
Security guard?

58
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:45,785
Not on weekends.

59
00:02:46,664 --> 00:02:47,778
Who knew that?

60
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,310
- Who didn't?
<i>- Are these...</i>

61
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,193
these guys gonna be here a while?

62
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,806
Yeah.

63
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,509
<i>Spatter over here.</i>

64
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:04,305
<i>Looks like this is where it started.</i>

65
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:05,857
<i>And that's where it ended.</i>

66
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:09,668
<i>Right, okay, so...
We got the altercation starting here.</i>

67
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:11,695
<i>Fight, fight, fight.</i>

68
00:03:11,953 --> 00:03:13,271
<i>Scuffle, scuffle, scuffle.</i>

69
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:14,948
<i>And they end up here.</i>

70
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:17,106
<i>Man falls over the edge,</i>

71
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:20,684
<i>lands on the roof of the cage,
which was three stories down,</i>

72
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:23,043
<i>and then he rides the elevator</i>

73
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,646
<i>all the way </i>back up.

74
00:03:24,952 --> 00:03:26,325
<i>To the crime scene.</i>

75
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:28,961
Yeah, it's funny till someone plunges
to their death.

76
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,694
Come on, still with the height thing?

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,218
You got to get over that, man.

78
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:35,341
You don't just get over
irrational fears, Tony.

79
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:36,530
They're irrational.

80
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:38,893
So, we got a struggle and a dead guy.

81
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:40,255
Struggle over what?

82
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:41,493
Over the edge.

83
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,308
<i>All right, here's the cell phone.</i>

84
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:45,830
<i>I'm heading back down.</i>

85
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,644
<i>Dead, just like its owner.</i>

86
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:49,610
<i>Need a hand, Dr. Mallard?</i>

87
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:53,312
<i>The best way to renew the mind and body,
Mr. Palmer</i>, is exercise.

88
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:55,807
The more, the merrier
<i>when it comes to stairs.</i>

89
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,524
- I didn't mean...
- My cardio is fine.

90
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:00,883
Unlike this poor fellow.

91
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:05,308
<i>Use the thermometer.</i>

92
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:08,108
That is one nasty contusion.

93
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:12,216
He struck something hard,
or else something hard struck him.

94
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,664
Yeah, we're still looking.

95
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:16,983
Rick Baxter, <i>34 years of age,
Virginia driver's license.</i>

96
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,749
<i>We won't be able to tell you much more</i>
until we get him back to autopsy.

97
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:22,590
Got to figure out
what he was doing here.

98
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:24,224
And with whom he was doing it.

99
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:25,435
Doing what with?

100
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:28,380
Whatever it was he was
doing when he was undone.

101
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:30,076
Done... what?

102
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:31,470
Done.

103
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,699
In, my dear fellow.

104
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,051
Done in.

105
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:37,358
Don't you understand
the Queen's English?

106
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:38,790
Not this queen.

107
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,545
Time of death.

108
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:43,722
Approximately 4:00 A.M.

109
00:04:43,963 --> 00:04:45,199
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

110
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,073
He's an early riser.

111
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:48,644
Early demiser.

112
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:50,503
Please, Mr. Palmer.

113
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,799
<i>Dr. Mallard.</i>

114
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,826
Aren't we forgetting something?

115
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:56,157
- No, I'm gonna get the gurney.
- I should do that.

116
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:58,953
No, I shall use the elevator, so

117
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:01,723
you get the body off the roof

118
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:03,210
to down here.

119
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:04,319
<i>And then...</i>

120
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,600
And then we can move
the body back into the cage.

121
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,142
Good thinking, Mr. Palmer.

122
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:27,817
<i>Mr. Palmer!</i>

123
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:36,986
- Nice job of parking.
- Sorry.

124
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,747
It's all clear up there?

125
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,943
- All clear, Doctor.
- Good.

126
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:57,992
McGee?

127
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:01,071
<i>Did you take that passport, McGee?</i>

128
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:17,298
<i>Tony?</i>

129
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,565
Ziva, is that you?

130
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:31,693
<i>Who's there?</i>

131
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:42,131
Hey, hey! Stop!

132
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,110
Mr. Palmer?

133
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:46,233
<i>Stop!</i>

134
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:54,656
Jimmy?

135
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:05,505
Jimmy?

136
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:07,210
<i>Jimmy!</i>

137
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:09,849
Are you all right?

138
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:22,134
<i>So, we got no shooter,</i>

139
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:24,710
<i>we got no shell casings,
we got nothing.</i>

140
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:27,228
<i>This guy gonna be useful to us at all?</i>

141
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,835
He's a witness, not a suspect.

142
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:33,298
He's an assistant
to the medical examiner.

143
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:35,700
- He's paid <i>to observe things</i>.
- He's not a field agent.

144
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,257
He's a member of your team.

145
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:40,253
- <i>No</i>. He works for Ducky.
- Ducky works for you.

146
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:45,992
Something bugging you, Leon?

147
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:49,720
Yeah.

148
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:51,957
Director's back end of the week.

149
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:53,100
I want to go home.

150
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:55,821
<i>I miss my kids. I miss San Diego.</i>

151
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:57,801
Missed my damn flight
because of this case.

152
00:07:57,885 --> 00:07:59,882
I just want <i>it solved, so I can leave.</i>

153
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:02,185
- Works for me.
- Like I said...

154
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,499
I got him.

155
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:08,535
Luck.

156
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,826
I saw some of these guys
at the Navy Annex garage, but...

157
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:18,354
none of them look like
the guy who shot at me.

158
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:20,168
What about the photo on the passport?

159
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:21,620
Definitely the dead guy.

160
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:23,062
Positive.

161
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:24,673
Name on the passport?

162
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:29,303
It wasn't the name on the
<i>driver's license, which was...</i>

163
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,632
- Baxter?
- Right.

164
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:34,875
I think the name on the
passport started with...

165
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,252
S-U-S or an S-A-S.

166
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:39,596
Country?

167
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,729
The lettering wasn't in English.
It was like...

168
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,048
Hieroglyphics.

169
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:46,169
Design, then.

170
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:48,989
Blue cover.

171
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:50,860
Might have been like a...

172
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:53,683
<i>an eagle or a star, stylized.</i>

173
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:55,696
You know, like... like a swirl.

174
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:57,476
<i>Sort of.</i>

175
00:08:58,597 --> 00:08:59,519
Swirly?

176
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:03,271
So you saw a man with a gun
and you decided to chase after him?

177
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:07,024
No, I chased after him,
and then I saw the gun.

178
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:10,705
I can't tell if you're dumb or brave.

179
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:12,931
Not brave enough.

180
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,666
The gun...

181
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,870
- What about it?
- Automatic, revolver?

182
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:24,069
<i>Nickel-plated, black?</i>
Dull, shiny, big, small?

183
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,062
- Big.
- The barrel!

184
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:28,276
Yes, the barrel.

185
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:35,992
You want to take a minute?

186
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:41,091
No, no, I... I'm good.

187
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,510
- I'm good.
- All right.

188
00:09:44,113 --> 00:09:44,971
Height?

189
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:47,440
Average.

190
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:49,007
Can you be more specific?

191
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:51,183
It all happened so fast.

192
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:54,769
- But you got a really good look at him?
- Yeah, a very good look...

193
00:09:57,551 --> 00:09:59,424
Beady eyes. Okay?

194
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:01,435
Reptilian.

195
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:04,906
So we're looking for a beady-eyed

196
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:07,793
reptile with a big gun?

197
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,088
How close were you to the shooter?

198
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,260
How close?

199
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:18,573
Feet, yards, inches... how close?

200
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:26,115
Okay.

201
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:30,788
What are you doing?

202
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:32,118
Pythagorean theorem.

203
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:34,357
By calculating two <i>fixed points</i>,

204
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,689
<i>then factoring in the shooter</i>
as a third fixed object,

205
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,306
- I think I can <i>estimate how far...</i>
- Okay, that's enough for tonight.

206
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:43,875
<i>Go down to Sciuto's lab first
thing in the morning, draw a sketch.</i>

207
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:45,502
I want to put a BOLO out.

208
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:52,137
Sir...

209
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:54,917
I'm so sorry that I couldn't...

210
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,227
Remember?

211
00:10:57,534 --> 00:10:58,535
Catch him.

212
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:00,404
It's okay.

213
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:01,997
We'll catch him.

214
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,758
<i>Rick Baxter, 34.</i>

215
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:14,255
<i>Single, born in Denver,
no known relatives.</i>

216
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:15,502
<i>According to the DMV,</i>

217
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:18,506
he's lived at the same address
in Virginia for the past 11 years.

218
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:19,236
<i>And?</i>

219
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:22,086
<i>The address has been a strip
mall for the past two years.</i>

220
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,933
Baxter's condo was demolished.

221
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:26,611
<i>No record of a current address.
Renewed his license by mail.</i>

222
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:28,198
<i>- Fake?</i>
- No, it's real.

223
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,853
Hologram,
strip mag, everything checks out.

224
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:32,451
Only fake part is the address.

225
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:33,452
Passport?

226
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:35,221
Baxter's never applied
for one in his life.

227
00:11:35,252 --> 00:11:38,593
- He's never left the country.
- So, real driver's license,

228
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:42,176
phony address <i>and a fake passport.</i>
It's like Jason Bourne.

229
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,456
Should we put out a BOLO for Matt Damon?

230
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:48,709
- Or not.
- Prints.

231
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,452
Baxter's not in any system anywhere.

232
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:53,565
He's never been arrested,
never <i>served in the military...</i>

233
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:57,771
So there is no way to know
who Baxter really is or is not.

234
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:00,925
He didn't take the license,
he took the passport. That's the key.

235
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:04,528
Maybe Mini-Mallard made a
mistake and it wasn't a passport.

236
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,247
It was.

237
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:11,293
Baxter hasn't filed
a tax return in ten years.

238
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:13,042
<i>No applications for unemployment.</i>

239
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:14,944
- Bank records?
- Dormant account.

240
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:17,117
<i>Defaulted to the state five years ago.</i>

241
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:18,329
Phone.

242
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:21,288
Baxter's cell was a burn phone, boss.

243
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:24,767
<i>Purchased at a convenience
store with cash ten days ago.</i>

244
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,513
So there's no address to trace.

245
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:28,092
From the phone's SIM card

246
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:30,867
we know that a call was placed
from his cell at 4:03 this morning.

247
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:32,481
Around the time of death.

248
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:33,488
Trace.

249
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:35,936
That's going to be
<i>a bit of a problem, boss.</i>

250
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:38,432
The phone he called
was also a burn phone.

251
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:41,779
So even going off cell towers,
<i>we can't really get a fix.</i>

252
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:44,704
Maybe I can...

253
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:47,062
<i>maybe I can track all
transmissions from both phones,</i>

254
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:49,547
<i>see if I can find a </i>common
number that links both to a land line.

255
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:50,993
Yeah, do that. Passport.

256
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,415
<i>Shooter. Dead guy.</i>

257
00:12:52,535 --> 00:12:53,799
<i>Connect the dots.</i>

258
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:55,336
Yeah. Gibbs.

259
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,999
Be right there.

260
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:03,523
<i>- Duck.</i>
- Jethro.

261
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:05,506
The wound to Mr. Baxter's

262
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:08,268
<i>left temporal lobe did not kill him.</i>

263
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:10,614
<i>I found evidence of blood in his lungs,</i>

264
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:14,155
indicating that he lived
some time after the initial blow.

265
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:15,982
- Enough time to make a phone call?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

266
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:18,000
911 would have been advisable.

267
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:22,483
- He had something to hide. Death?
- Exsanguination.

268
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,674
Shattered spleen <i>and a crushed liver</i>

269
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:27,596
<i>and other assorted abdominal injuries.</i>

270
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,713
Not to mention all the fractures.

271
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,833
The fall.

272
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,406
<i>With catastrophic</i> results.

273
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:36,014
I surmise the blow to the head
made him lose his balance,

274
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:39,381
and that caused him to
fall <i>to his untimely death</i>.

275
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:43,750
I don't know how it
fits into your puzzle,

276
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,663
but it is on his upper extremities,

277
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:49,257
<i>and throughout his respiratory system.</i>

278
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:50,637
He was breathing it.

279
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:52,633
- It seems so.
- What is it?

280
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:54,528
Abby is running tests.

281
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:56,907
Thanks, Duck.

282
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,590
How is Mr. Palmer?

283
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:02,907
I really miss his assistance.

284
00:14:03,095 --> 00:14:06,370
You never fully appreciate
someone until <i>they're not here</i>.

285
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:07,717
He'll be all right.

286
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,408
Jimmy may not have had
a good look at the shooter,

287
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,760
but I fear the shooter
may have had a good look at him.

288
00:14:14,842 --> 00:14:15,642
Duck.

289
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,083
You let me worry about the shooter.

290
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,299
My soup is simmering.

291
00:14:27,236 --> 00:14:29,819
Now back to my masterpiece.

292
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,915
Now flare the nostrils.

293
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:35,604
Split the difference.

294
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:39,443
What about the ears?

295
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:41,817
Bigger?

296
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,369
Well, not that big.

297
00:14:45,112 --> 00:14:46,993
<i>Yeah, like that. Now,</i>

298
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,451
<i>reduce the density</i>
of the orbicularis oris area.

299
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:52,786
- The what?
- The space

300
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:54,846
between the nose and the upper lip.

301
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:57,354
We call that a Cupid's Bow.

302
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,894
One time I got my lip stuck in a vacuum
cleaner display at the department store.

303
00:15:00,895 --> 00:15:03,863
I lost, like, a quart of saliva
before my cousin pulled the plug

304
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:06,757
<i>I still have nightmares about it.</i>
Can't be alone with a HEPA filter.

305
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:08,194
How old were you?

306
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:09,462
Twenty-two.

307
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,829
It was, like, Fat Tuesday

308
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:13,317
<i>- or Arbor Day.</i>
- That's him!

309
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:14,555
That is the guy.

310
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:16,057
That's the guy?

311
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,996
That's the guy that
picked up the passport?

312
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:19,559
Yeah. Why, what's wrong?

313
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:23,216
So you got shot at by Dr. Jekyll?

314
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:24,946
I think you're referring to Mr. Hyde.

315
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,626
Dr. Jekyll's the one who invented
the <i>potion, but look, yeah,</i>

316
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,511
<i>you have</i> captured <i>his essence perfectly</i>.

317
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:32,734
His anger.

318
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,842
His intent.

319
00:15:34,973 --> 00:15:36,314
<i>His bloodlust.</i>

320
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:37,814
His likeness?

321
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:39,498
It's his likeness.

322
00:15:39,902 --> 00:15:41,484
That's kind of the point here.

323
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:44,112
<i>You know what?</i> Let's start over.

324
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:47,390
Okay. He was a white guy, right?

325
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:50,962
I couldn't catch him,
now I can't even identify him.

326
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:54,167
I'm sure Gibbs <i>thinks
I'm completely useless.</i>

327
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,310
No.

328
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:56,558
Jimmy!

329
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,814
You chased a crazy guy <i>with a gun</i>.

330
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:02,106
You're a stud muffin.

331
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:04,815
<i>You're an iron fist with a velvet glove.</i>

332
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,320
You're Baby Gibbs.

333
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:08,657
Really?

334
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:16,536
Now make the bridge of the nose flatter.

335
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:19,667
<i>McGee.</i>

336
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:23,401
Done, boss. Common calls
<i>from both burn phones</i>

337
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:25,478
<i>were made to a single residence
two days ago.</i>

338
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,808
- Address.
- A mobile home park in Alexandria.

339
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:29,306
I hope there's no tornados.

340
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:31,070
You know about tornadoes
and trailer homes.

341
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:32,502
<i>Gear. Go. Get back.</i>

342
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,132
Wow, should've seen that coming.

343
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:48,042
Looks like we missed the twister.

344
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:05,718
It was Baxter's house but it
disappeared in the middle of the night.

345
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:07,134
No one heard or saw it leave.

346
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:08,914
Put a BOLO out on the plates,
<i>nothing yet.</i>

347
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:11,132
His neighbor's positively
identified Baxter

348
00:17:11,174 --> 00:17:13,052
from our driver's license photograph.

349
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:15,138
<i>Manager said Baxter
had been there for a year,</i>

350
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:17,598
paid through the end of the month.
Gave no notice of leaving.

351
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,480
Someone is going to great
lengths to clean up <i>after him.</i>

352
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:21,959
The question is why?

353
00:17:22,227 --> 00:17:23,436
I took that picture.

354
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:26,180
<i>Notice anything odd about it?</i>

355
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:28,804
A little underexposed.

356
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,284
<i>Five-gallon drum.</i>
Abby ran the contents:

357
00:17:31,356 --> 00:17:32,512
hydrofluoric acid.

358
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:34,867
That's important because...

359
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:36,881
They don't use it in construction.

360
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:40,234
I knew that.
That's why I took the picture.

361
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,856
<i>I'm really trying here, McGee.</i>

362
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:44,401
Jimmy, I know.

363
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,008
Passport.

364
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:47,727
<i>Okay... blue.</i>

365
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:51,517
<i>Dark blue. I'm pretty sure</i>
it was dark blue.

366
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:54,483
Yes, you have narrowed it down
to the most popular color in the world.

367
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,725
I'm sorry, McGee.

368
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:58,923
It's all right, don't worry.

369
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:03,238
Again, these represent
every dark blue passport

370
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:05,795
in the world from Argentina to Zimbabwe.

371
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,193
There's so many.

372
00:18:07,414 --> 00:18:08,420
Seventy-two.

373
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:12,211
<i>With each country </i>averaging ten percent
of the population with passports,

374
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,524
we're looking at approximately
200 million suspects.

375
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:18,422
Give or take a few million.

376
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:22,392
<i>I took a wilderness survival course.</i>

377
00:18:22,747 --> 00:18:24,025
<i>Spent two weeks alone.</i>

378
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:26,190
I even encountered a bear.

379
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:30,854
But a ten-second encounter
with a bad guy, and I go blank.

380
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:35,516
I do not understand.

381
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:39,280
Well, was that bear
in the woods packing heat?

382
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:42,833
No.

383
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,528
There you go.

384
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:47,377
Guess you never know, do you?

385
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:48,699
What?

386
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:50,434
How you'll respond.

387
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,296
In a moment of crisis, you
have a split second to make a decision.

388
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:57,573
Jimmy, someone was
pointing a gun at you.

389
00:18:57,977 --> 00:19:00,452
In that split second, you chose to duck.

390
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,757
<i>I think you passed with flying colors.</i>

391
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:04,956
It's like it fried my brain circuitry.

392
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:09,653
We're going to fix that.

393
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:10,840
<i>Okay?</i>

394
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,527
You mind if I ask you
a personal question?

395
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:16,893
Yeah.

396
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:20,857
How did you handle getting
shot at the first time?

397
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,281
Well, you know,
I'm a highly trained federal agent.

398
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,539
It's not really <i>a fair comparison</i>.
Anything on these passports?

399
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:37,067
I'm not a lot of help, am I?

400
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:41,340
All right.

401
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:44,059
There is something
else that we could try.

402
00:19:46,246 --> 00:19:48,780
<i>Your eyes are getting heavy.</i>

403
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:50,572
<i>All information</i>

404
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:53,334
is recorded in the subconscious mind.

405
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:56,378
I'm going to count down from three.

406
00:19:56,986 --> 00:19:58,579
<i>As I'm counting down,</i>

407
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:01,845
<i>you are going to go into a deeper
state of relaxation.</i>

408
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,493
Three.

409
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:07,352
<i>You're getting calm and relaxed.</i>

410
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:11,779
Two, you're going into
a deeper state of comfort.

411
00:20:14,524 --> 00:20:15,349
One.

412
00:20:16,304 --> 00:20:18,901
You're in a deep <i>sleep</i>.

413
00:20:26,315 --> 00:20:27,517
You're at peace.

414
00:20:28,512 --> 00:20:31,737
You have the ability <i>to retrieve
any information at will.</i>

415
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:33,634
You have total recall.

416
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:37,446
<i>If at anytime you feel a block
to your memory,</i>

417
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:39,048
<i>take a deep breath...</i>

418
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:43,184
... and the block will melt away.

419
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,411
Understand?

420
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:45,795
<i>Okay.</i>

421
00:20:46,052 --> 00:20:47,958
I'm going to take you back to yesterday.

422
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,706
<i>You're at the crime scene.</i>

423
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,119
You find a passport.

424
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:53,697
Passport?

425
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:54,671
Yeah.

426
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,170
Do you see it?

427
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,169
It's vinyl. Dark blue.

428
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:01,105
- Vinyl?
<i>- Yes.</i>

429
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:03,174
- Dark blue?
- Yes.

430
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,533
Pick it up.

431
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:06,083
No, I'm going to get hurt.

432
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:07,143
You're safe, Jimmy.

433
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,771
<i>No one's going to hurt you.</i>

434
00:21:09,388 --> 00:21:10,388
Deep breath.

435
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:12,937
<i>Good.</i>

436
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:15,261
<i>Okay.</i>

437
00:21:15,562 --> 00:21:16,986
You're at the crime scene.

438
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,279
You look down

439
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:19,673
and what do you see?

440
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:22,279
Leather.

441
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:24,212
Light brown.

442
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:25,677
What?

443
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:29,502
Okay, <i>pick it up</i>.

444
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:31,555
And look at it.

445
00:21:31,746 --> 00:21:33,033
<i>Are you doing it?</i>

446
00:21:33,563 --> 00:21:35,155
Okay, what does it say?

447
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:37,259
Cole Haan,

448
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:38,959
<i>low boot,</i>

449
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:41,343
<i>size seven and a half.</i>

450
00:21:42,012 --> 00:21:43,729
Sounds like a woman's boot.

451
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:46,418
Jimmy, <i>put Ziva's boot down.</i>

452
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,519
Can you hear me? It's Abby.

453
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:49,639
<i>Abby.</i>

454
00:21:50,071 --> 00:21:52,754
<i>Black. High platforms. Dementia.</i>

455
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,836
<i>Size ten.</i>

456
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,027
Jimmy!

457
00:21:56,427 --> 00:21:57,264
What?

458
00:21:57,996 --> 00:21:59,077
<i>What did I say?</i>

459
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:00,557
<i>Did we catch him?</i>

460
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:02,445
Did we learn anything about this guy?

461
00:22:02,516 --> 00:22:04,778
No, but we certainly
learned something about you.

462
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,011
Whatever it is,

463
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:08,299
<i>it's not what you think.</i>

464
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:09,959
If the shoe fits...

465
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:12,436
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

466
00:22:13,011 --> 00:22:16,285
- These boots were made for walking.
- Wait. You can't just give up.

467
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:20,032
We're not giving up, Jimmy.

468
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:21,267
We're moving on.

469
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:24,375
No, no, no. I. I have to do this.
Please. Please!

470
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:27,859
<i>Try again?</i>

471
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,018
Balding, short-cropped rim of dark hair.

472
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:41,496
Squinty eyes,
but set deep in its sockets.

473
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:44,545
<i>Full face.</i>

474
00:22:45,318 --> 00:22:47,223
<i>Small scar on the right jaw line.</i>

475
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:49,505
His details are amazing.

476
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,167
Right down to the scar.

477
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,164
Sideburns about two
inches lower than the ears.

478
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:59,256
Small gold ring in his left earlobe.

479
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,959
Razor stubble.

480
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,832
<i>Pale complexion.</i>

481
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,023
He's got every feature.

482
00:23:06,503 --> 00:23:08,366
This is good enough for a BOLO.

483
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,846
Okay, Jimmy,
<i>I'm going to count backwards from four.</i>

484
00:23:13,376 --> 00:23:16,313
<i>When I get to one,
you're going to open your eyes.</i>

485
00:23:17,246 --> 00:23:20,419
Four, three, two,

486
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:21,942
<i>one.</i>

487
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,079
How'd I do?

488
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,637
Great.

489
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:30,479
<i>Like, greater than great.</i>

490
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:33,681
I didn't mention anything about
the sleep out at Camp Winnamonka, did I?

491
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,379
Okay, are you ready?

492
00:23:42,258 --> 00:23:43,473
That's the guy.

493
00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:46,225
The guy who took a shot at you, right?

494
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:50,822
Two shots.

495
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:53,202
Of espresso.

496
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:56,641
That's the guy I get
my coffee from every morning.

497
00:23:57,773 --> 00:23:59,051
Jimmy!

498
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,694
Wait.
What happened at Camp Winnamonka?

499
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:06,470
Leaving.

500
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:10,581
Hey.

501
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:15,486
<i>I got the results</i> on that
white powder found on Baxter.

502
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:20,004
Any luck jogging Palmer's memory?

503
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:21,006
Working on it.

504
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:23,024
<i>Sounds like he's got a
serious case of brain freeze.</i>

505
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:24,632
Well, freeze can always thaw, Leon.

506
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:25,837
Agent Gibbs!

507
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,226
I've got Abby's results from
that white residue found on Baxter.

508
00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:30,696
<i>It was efflorescence.</i>

509
00:24:30,816 --> 00:24:33,132
<i>Abby says that efflorescence forms</i>
from water

510
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:35,463
and calcium carbonate,
seep through concrete.

511
00:24:35,464 --> 00:24:36,549
Subgrade concrete.

512
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,818
That's why the naval building
was being retrofitted.

513
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:40,641
I saw it on the cement, not in the air.

514
00:24:40,992 --> 00:24:43,260
What would cause him
to breathe in a good amount?

515
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:45,432
Drilling.

516
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:47,454
Why would he be drilling into concrete?

517
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:51,164
I guess that you're going to find out.

518
00:24:51,184 --> 00:24:53,469
Hey, grab your gear. <i>We're going back.</i>

519
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,599
<i>Move it down slowly.</i>

520
00:24:59,525 --> 00:25:00,596
<i>Keep going.</i>

521
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:03,745
Converting to a three-dimensional image.

522
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:05,757
<i>And we get...</i>

523
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:07,303
rebar.

524
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:10,447
<i>Maybe he did not know or forgot</i>
where he was supposed to be drilling.

525
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:12,914
<i>Well, maybe he was drilling</i>
to place explosives.

526
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:15,939
First time they hit the World
Trade Center, <i>they aimed at the garage.</i>

527
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:17,904
<i>Navy annex building's next door.</i>

528
00:25:17,956 --> 00:25:19,116
Keep looking.

529
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:21,841
Here is another hole.

530
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:24,144
I thought that drill
belonged to one of my guys.

531
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:26,968
No. Dead guy's prints are all over it.

532
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:32,719
<i>Okay, Tony.</i>

533
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,563
<i>Keep moving it down.</i>

534
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:38,576
<i>Keep going.</i>

535
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,519
Stop right there.

536
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:41,405
Stop.

537
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:43,264
<i>Converting.</i>

538
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:45,919
Boss?

539
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:05,852
<i>It will take a very long time
to get fingerprints off</i>

540
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,811
- that unfortunate soul.
- How long, Mr. Harris?

541
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:10,678
<i>We're ready to cut out the section, but</i>

542
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,286
we have to wait for the structural
engineer. He's on his way.

543
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:15,091
Thank you for your cooperation.

544
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:18,549
Yeah, well, my... "cooperation"
just put us in the red on this job.

545
00:26:18,804 --> 00:26:20,585
If you'll back away, please.

546
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:22,853
All right, jack it up short.

547
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:24,201
<i>Hey, get ready.</i>

548
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,662
We're making progress, Boss.

549
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:27,379
We had one dead guy with two identities,

550
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:29,882
and now we got another
dead guy with no identity.

551
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:31,412
There has to be a connection.

552
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:33,003
<i>The body must have been dumped</i>

553
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:35,764
<i>into the column form
before the concrete was poured.</i>

554
00:26:35,966 --> 00:26:38,350
<i>What was Mr. Baxter doing
here in the middle of the night?</i>

555
00:26:38,392 --> 00:26:40,926
Without a jackhammer,
he couldn't get those bones out.

556
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,345
He didn't have to, Duck.

557
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:44,657
Because he had hydrofluoric acid.

558
00:26:44,698 --> 00:26:46,709
<i>Hydrofluoric acid</i> is highly corrosive.

559
00:26:47,091 --> 00:26:49,355
<i>If he had managed to pour in that acid,</i>

560
00:26:49,405 --> 00:26:51,830
it would have destroyed all
organic material.

561
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:55,689
That would make DNA and dental
<i>identification virtually impossible.</i>

562
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:57,590
Doesn't explain who killed Baxter.

563
00:26:57,914 --> 00:26:59,657
It's probably the same guy
who shot at me.

564
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:04,200
<i>Yes, well, I think</i> we've done here.

565
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:09,434
<i>Foreman said it'd take a couple
hours to cut out that section of column.</i>

566
00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:12,438
<i>Gibbs wants me to stay behind
and maintain the chain of evidence.</i>

567
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:14,246
<i>Yes, well, Mr. Palmer and I have</i>

568
00:27:14,288 --> 00:27:17,645
<i>to go pick up some unconventional tools,</i>
don't we, Mr. Palmer?

569
00:27:17,934 --> 00:27:19,148
<i>Mr. Palmer?</i>

570
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:21,413
Do you see him?

571
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:23,719
- Who?
- It's him.

572
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,216
<i>He's right behind that truck.</i>

573
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:26,455
He's been watching me.

574
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,048
Stay here.

575
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:47,607
Hi, Gibbs.

576
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:50,075
Impressive.

577
00:27:50,898 --> 00:27:54,061
Well, I learned from the master.
That would be you, the master.

578
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:56,751
And I would be the apprentice.
The master's apprentice.

579
00:27:56,898 --> 00:27:58,915
The apprentice to the master.

580
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,111
Okay, I said "Hi Gibbs"

581
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:04,519
every ten seconds since
I called you down here five minutes ago.

582
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,597
To tell me what?

583
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,929
I took a photo of Baxter's head wound,

584
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,181
<i>using an oblique-angled light source.</i>

585
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:13,449
It makes the impression from
the blunt-forced weapon even clearer.

586
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:15,493
<i>Weapon of choice?</i>

587
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:17,836
<i>Bolt cutters.</i>

588
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:18,933
<i>Watch.</i>

589
00:28:22,362 --> 00:28:23,522
<i>Perfect fit.</i>

590
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:25,284
Lot of those on a construction site.

591
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:27,916
You bring them to me,
and I will tell you exactly which one.

592
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:29,802
And that's not all.

593
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,856
Ducky found a microscopic piece of metal

594
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:37,109
in the victim's wound.
It's 99 percent pure copper.

595
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:39,164
<i>0.4 phosphorous.</i>

596
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:41,015
I matched it to an electric cable.

597
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,680
<i>Do you know what the spot</i>
price is for copper, Gibbs?

598
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:45,269
I know our killer does.

599
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,247
<i>Thanks, Abs.</i>

600
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:06,560
<i>Yeah, there was a time when
I thought I would be an archeologist.</i>

601
00:29:06,784 --> 00:29:08,395
- Really?
<i>- Yes.</i>

602
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:11,623
<i>I was in the upper sixth at school.</i>

603
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:16,106
Summer holidays.
I volunteered for a dig in Tanzania.

604
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:19,163
What happened? Why did you decide
to go to medical school?

605
00:29:19,297 --> 00:29:22,668
Well, although archeology
carried a certain romantic appeal,

606
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:26,748
I soon realized it wasn't in my bones,
<i>so to speak.</i>

607
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:31,324
You have to decide what's in your bones,
Mr. Palmer.

608
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,314
- Not a spine.
<i>- Nonsense</i>. You just have a...

609
00:29:35,436 --> 00:29:37,803
a well-developed sense
of self-preservation.

610
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:41,858
<i>You're training to be a medical
examiner,</i> not an NCIS field agent.

611
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:45,547
I have no doubt

612
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:49,442
that you have it in you
to die a hero's death.

613
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,488
<i>But for the time being, I'd appreciate</i>

614
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,630
it if you could stay alive
to help me examine the dead.

615
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,697
Ducky, sorry to interrupt.
Need to borrow Palmer here.

616
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,074
- What's happening?
- We have a suspect.

617
00:30:04,923 --> 00:30:06,873
<i>A suspect? What did you find?</i>

618
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:09,726
Sometimes I worry about that young man.

619
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:12,533
<i>Now, let's have a look.</i>

620
00:30:21,463 --> 00:30:23,604
<i>Your bolt cutters, Enis.</i>

621
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:27,976
<i>We got a blood match.</i>
You should have used bleach.

622
00:30:31,861 --> 00:30:33,312
How did you know Rick Baxter?

623
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,180
- I didn't.
<i>- Right.</i>

624
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:43,377
You met him at the construction site
when you went to go steal something

625
00:30:43,378 --> 00:30:46,428
- in the middle of the night?
- With bolt cutters.

626
00:30:47,998 --> 00:30:51,460
<i>What does copper</i> sell for
these days, Enis?

627
00:30:57,498 --> 00:30:59,254
About four dollars a pound.

628
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:02,050
- Worth killing for?
- It was self-defense, man.

629
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:04,205
This guy was trying to kill me!

630
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:15,063
There was some copper wire
I wanted up on the third floor.

631
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:17,147
<i>South side, and I went up there.</i>

632
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:20,485
And I saw him. He was drilling a hole
in the support column.

633
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:23,125
You know, he spotted me, he went nuts.

634
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:26,366
I ran, he came after me, and...
I thought he was gonna kill me.

635
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:30,498
I had my cutters.

636
00:31:30,835 --> 00:31:34,538
<i>I took a swing, I got lucky.</i>
Caught him in the side of the head,

637
00:31:34,658 --> 00:31:36,208
and he staggered back.

638
00:31:36,905 --> 00:31:38,988
Just fell right off of the edge.

639
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:42,966
<i>I swear, that's it. If I didn't do it,
he would have killed me.</i>

640
00:31:44,466 --> 00:31:46,782
Watley just confessed to killing Baxter.

641
00:31:46,783 --> 00:31:48,479
Claims it was self-defense.

642
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:51,467
No more looking over your shoulder.

643
00:31:51,818 --> 00:31:54,568
- You got the wrong guy.
- He just confessed.

644
00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:57,438
He may have confessed to killing Baxter,

645
00:31:57,886 --> 00:32:01,024
but that is definitely not the guy
who tried to kill me.

646
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:11,762
Look at the bright side,
<i>at least we solved Baxter's murder.</i>

647
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,022
<i>- Self-defense, not murder.
- So says our copper thief.</i>

648
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,212
And Abby.

649
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:18,158
She analyzed footprints
and blood spatter

650
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,483
we lifted from the garage:
matches Watley's story.

651
00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:23,105
- I'm more concerned with Palmer.
- He said Watley is not the guy

652
00:32:23,106 --> 00:32:25,340
- who took a shot at him.
- Or stole Baxter's passport.

653
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:27,559
And we still don't know who did.

654
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:30,882
- You already knew that.
- Call every Baxter in the phone book.

655
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:33,432
<i>- See if I can find a relative.</i>
- Help Tony.

656
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:35,351
Re-check for a financial trail.
Got it.

657
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:36,964
Short leash.

658
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:40,028
- Them or me?
- No ID on the mummy yet?

659
00:32:40,781 --> 00:32:43,877
- Abby's working on it.
- Then I'm sure you'll have one soon.

660
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,987
- How's Palmer?
- I'll let you know.

661
00:33:02,143 --> 00:33:04,339
- Sorry.
- Never say that. You writing a letter?

662
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:07,695
E-mail to my mom.

663
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:11,178
I'm trying to figure out
how to describe what happened.

664
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:18,602
How do you do it?

665
00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:22,261
Block out fear?

666
00:33:26,077 --> 00:33:27,111
You don't.

667
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:31,136
It's what you do with it.

668
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:37,538
What I'm doing with it
is nothing to write home about.

669
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,709
The look in someone's eyes
can tell you a lot.

670
00:33:45,248 --> 00:33:46,598
What do mine tell?

671
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:52,608
Hold off on that.

672
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,710
You'll have something to tell them.

673
00:34:10,921 --> 00:34:13,224
Pull up a chair...
We just got to the East Coast felons.

674
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:15,175
It's always my favorite part.

675
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:18,621
- Facial recognition.
- Yep.

676
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:21,722
<i>- Where'd you get the face?</i>
- When we found John Doe,

677
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:25,002
there was nothing left,
except a shrunken, dried-up mummy.

678
00:34:25,323 --> 00:34:26,545
But then I realized,

679
00:34:27,036 --> 00:34:30,239
<i>when he was first buried,
he must've had some kind of face.</i>

680
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,219
- When the concrete was poured...
- It left an imprint.

681
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:34,721
Exactly.

682
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,765
I scanned the pieces of concrete
that were surrounding his face,

683
00:34:39,091 --> 00:34:42,270
<i>and then I had the computer
look for pieces that matched a template.</i>

684
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:44,939
<i>Then I converted the grid
into a 3-D imprint.</i>

685
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:48,352
<i>I scanned the imprint, added flesh tones
and estimated a brow line,</i>

686
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,203
and I made a photo likeness.

687
00:34:52,796 --> 00:34:53,656
<i>Voilà!</i>

688
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:56,900
- You got a match.
- Not yet.

689
00:34:56,901 --> 00:35:00,501
<i>But I'm searching every database I can,</i>
and the software is crunching...

690
00:35:00,502 --> 00:35:01,752
You got a match.

691
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:04,285
It didn't ding!

692
00:35:04,473 --> 00:35:07,045
My dinger didn't ding!
My dinger must be broken again.

693
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:09,655
I got a match.

694
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:14,385
<i>A personal injury case </i>from 1998.

695
00:35:15,086 --> 00:35:16,536
And the winner is...

696
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:18,598
<i>Rick Baxter.</i>

697
00:35:19,178 --> 00:35:20,728
The real Rick Baxter.

698
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,770
<i>However, the real Rick Baxter
had his identity stolen by this man.</i>

699
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:25,608
<i>Elevator guy.</i>

700
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:28,523
He didn't just steal Rick Baxter's
identity, he actually became Baxter.

701
00:35:28,804 --> 00:35:31,620
- And got rid of the original.
- Stuffed the body in concrete,

702
00:35:31,621 --> 00:35:34,492
and had to go back and get rid of it
before the retrofitters<i> found it.</i>

703
00:35:34,493 --> 00:35:36,949
- Why Baxter?
- Green.

704
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,192
<i>Baxter was injured
at a construction site in California.</i>

705
00:35:40,193 --> 00:35:43,038
- Won a big settlement, 12 years ago.
- Two-point-one million,

706
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,790
to be paid over 20 years.

707
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:48,503
So Mr. Elevator Shaft Guy killed Baxter,
<i>and then stole his identity.</i>

708
00:35:49,043 --> 00:35:51,972
You need to keep him alive
to keep receiving the payments.

709
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:53,349
It's kind of ironic.

710
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,091
Get injured one day
at a construction site

711
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:56,800
and then the next day
<i>you're part of one.</i>

712
00:35:56,801 --> 00:35:58,822
It still doesn't tell us
who took a shot at Palmer.

713
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,873
He had a partner, McGee.
Check settlement payments.

714
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:12,941
<i>They've all been cashed</i>
at the same currency exchange.

715
00:36:12,942 --> 00:36:14,821
I'll go there and see what I can dig up.

716
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:21,120
<i>Dr. Mallard,
aren't we forgetting something?</i>

717
00:36:21,736 --> 00:36:23,707
<i>I shall use the elevator, so...</i>

718
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:26,749
<i>You get the body off the roof.</i>

719
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:29,710
<i>And then we can move the body
back into the cage.</i>

720
00:36:43,355 --> 00:36:45,005
<i>It's all clear up there?</i>

721
00:36:47,974 --> 00:36:48,974
<i>Stop!</i>

722
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:05,454
<i>I've been thinking and I...</i>
Well, you're obviously the one to ask.

723
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:08,916
Obvious in which way to ask what?

724
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:12,503
- What I should have done.
- Done?

725
00:37:12,623 --> 00:37:14,462
If I had actually caught the guy?

726
00:37:15,821 --> 00:37:18,467
The shooter guy.
What should I have done?

727
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:22,929
To protect yourself?

728
00:37:25,532 --> 00:37:27,101
Yeah, I guess so.

729
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:37,152
This is a gun.
I am you. You are the shooter.

730
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:38,413
<i>Shoot me.</i>

731
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,580
You try.

732
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:57,798
Well, perhaps it is best
that you did not catch him.

733
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:02,094
<i>- M.I.</i>
- M.I.?

734
00:38:02,214 --> 00:38:03,340
M.I.

735
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:06,486
The first two letters
in his first name were M.I.

736
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,368
Ziva, you can let go now.

737
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:14,065
<i>All right. First name started
with an "M" and an "I".</i>

738
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:18,069
Last name started with an S-U-S.

739
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,769
And the next letter was a...

740
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:27,232
The next letter was...

741
00:38:27,545 --> 00:38:29,413
- Republic of Yugoslavia.
<i>- That's it!</i>

742
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:31,083
That is the passport!

743
00:38:31,237 --> 00:38:33,876
Half of the settlement payments
were converted to Serbian dinars.

744
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:36,632
80% of Serbian names end with an I-C.

745
00:38:38,391 --> 00:38:41,976
<i>I-C... M-I... S-U-S... </i>I-C.

746
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:45,244
There are also a lot<i> of Cs and Ks</i>.

747
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:47,880
<i>M-I...</i>

748
00:38:53,617 --> 00:38:56,808
Milos Suskavich!
Milos Saca... Whatever!

749
00:38:56,982 --> 00:38:58,222
I can spell it!

750
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,740
S-U-S-K-A-V-C-E-V-I-C!

751
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,118
We heard it the first three times,
P-A-L-M-E-R.

752
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:10,830
<i>Milos Suskavcevic.</i>
A native of central Serbia.

753
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:13,494
<i>Emigrated to the U.S. in 1998.</i>

754
00:39:13,495 --> 00:39:15,918
<i>Two years after Baxter</i>
was awarded his settlement.

755
00:39:16,306 --> 00:39:19,101
- He come alone?
- He came with his brother, Tesla.

756
00:39:19,102 --> 00:39:20,103
Run him.

757
00:39:27,773 --> 00:39:29,023
Is that the guy?

758
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,643
I don't know.
He didn't have a beard when I saw him.

759
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:35,920
I'd have to see him in person.

760
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:38,269
Worked out well for you last time,
didn't it, Palmer?

761
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,163
Find him, McGee.

762
00:39:40,431 --> 00:39:44,071
I need to access <i>Homeland Security
database for Tesla Susk...</i>

763
00:39:45,788 --> 00:39:47,138
How it's spelled.

764
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:50,855
<i>The only address listed for Tesla
is another P.O. box.</i>

765
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:52,838
<i>Checking the cell-phone records.</i>

766
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:54,665
<i>- He's got a Blackberry.</i>
- Trace it.

767
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:56,169
<i>Already on it.</i>

768
00:39:57,617 --> 00:40:00,995
<i>Junction of 95 and Arlington Highway.</i>
It's another trailer park.

769
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,741
Hiding in plain sight.

770
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,177
- No. You stay.
- I can identify him.

771
00:40:06,297 --> 00:40:08,236
You will, when we bring him back.

772
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,068
Clear!

773
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:01,039
<i>- Just missed him.</i>
- He'll be back.

774
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:09,001
<i>Belgrade</i>, Serbia.

775
00:41:09,974 --> 00:41:12,535
- First Class.
- Traveling on Baxter's dime.

776
00:41:12,952 --> 00:41:14,057
Or dinar.

777
00:41:15,405 --> 00:41:16,955
McGee, check the park.

778
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:18,532
- DiNozzo!
<i>- Boss!</i>

779
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:20,959
Check the manager's office.
Ziva, stay here.

780
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:39,527
- What are you doing?
- I thought I could help.

781
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:41,938
What don't you understand
about the word "stay".

782
00:41:42,477 --> 00:41:44,814
<i>Stay!</i> Palmer, you stay in the car.

783
00:42:22,808 --> 00:42:23,856
Boy...

784
00:42:53,922 --> 00:42:55,021
<i>Drop the gun!</i>

785
00:42:58,232 --> 00:42:59,266
<i>Put the gun down!</i>

786
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:07,315
<i>- Get on the ground! Now!
- Hands behind your back.</i>

787
00:43:09,855 --> 00:43:12,005
What the hell were you thinking?!

788
00:43:12,726 --> 00:43:14,280
I did not get out of the car.

789
00:43:14,771 --> 00:43:16,874
Don't ever do it again.

790
00:43:21,472 --> 00:43:24,522
Now you got something
to write home about, Palmer.
