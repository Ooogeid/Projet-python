00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:17,794
Cut.

3
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:19,912
What?

4
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:21,652
Rhiannon...

5
00:00:21,712 --> 00:00:23,024
What was wrong with that?

6
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:24,609
I'm gonna need a real scream.

7
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:26,429
That was a scream.

8
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,278
No, no.
An <i>über</i>-scream, okay?

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,866
Think of <i>Halloween II</i>
on steroids, okay?

10
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:35,620
You want to take a break?

11
00:00:36,022 --> 00:00:36,737
Yeah.

12
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:41,206
- Should have gone with the blond.
- No. You know, this is a favor.

13
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:42,836
He should be happy I'm even here.

14
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:44,963
I've screamed in three real movies.

15
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,954
I mean,
if there's one thing I can do, it's...

16
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:50,467
Lame.

17
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:54,431
See, now that was a real scream.

18
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:57,725
- Rhiannon?
- Help! Help!

19
00:00:58,522 --> 00:01:00,103
Help! Help!

20
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:02,886
Gary, get me out of here.

25
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:39,173
She was not smiling at you, Tony.

26
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:41,703
Some men can hit
a baseball 400 feet,

27
00:01:41,763 --> 00:01:44,771
others build rocket ships
that sail to the stars.

28
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:47,067
I can spot a woman's smile
at 20 yards.

29
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:50,695
Her name is Hannah,
and she's asked me out to lunch twice.

30
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:52,099
You?

31
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:54,606
Did your rocket ship
just take a nose dive?

32
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,535
No. It just landed
on a different planet.

33
00:01:58,116 --> 00:01:59,329
Look, two days ago,

34
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:02,790
you told me my car would be ready
yesterday, and the bill was $270.

35
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:03,880
Then yesterday,

36
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,011
you told me my car would
ready today, and the bill was $400.

37
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:09,255
Now you're telling me
my car's gonna be ready tomorrow?

38
00:02:09,315 --> 00:02:10,924
<i>- Absolutely. Tomorrow.</i>
- How much?

39
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,216
One octave or two?

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,238
Two.

41
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:15,678
$600?!

42
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:20,444
- Okay, I understand, but...
<i>- It's got to be replaced.</i>

43
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:21,699
- Tomorrow?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

44
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,428
Okay then. Thank you.

45
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:27,398
My crankshaft is wearing out.

46
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,652
There is no question what's going on
involves you and a shaft, McSofty.

47
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:34,078
Well, Tony, sometimes it's not
always the best policy to be too tough.

48
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:36,032
It can end up costing you more
in the long run.

49
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:39,076
I'm guessing that you got more than
your fair share of wedgies as a kid.

50
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:41,238
I can be tough when I have to be.

51
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:45,766
What?

52
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:46,987
Nothing.

53
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:49,024
I mean, you do have your...

54
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,103
- strengths.
- And weaknesses.

55
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:53,378
But remember that people
can be loved as much for their...

56
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:55,218
weaknesses as
they are for their strengths.

57
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:58,863
Well, then, DiNozzo,
you must be one very well-loved man.

58
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:01,178
- Thank you for noticing, boss.
- Squid.

59
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:02,260
Long dead.

60
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,581
Let's go.

61
00:03:08,236 --> 00:03:09,236
Hey, Ziva?

62
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:12,300
Did you accept?

63
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:15,113
Lunch? Hannah?

64
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,988
Coming through.

65
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,089
Take it easy, McCranky.

66
00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:24,963
You never cease to amaze me, Jethro.

67
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:27,274
You find the most dastardly crimes

68
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:29,736
 in the most idyllic of settings.

69
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:33,304
Lieutenant Neal Poletto.

70
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,548
Poletto?

71
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:38,219
- Get anything?
- Yeah.

72
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,514
An offer to be his tech advisor
on his next film.

73
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,600
It's about a psycho, sex-crazed cop.

74
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,060
<i>Life and times of
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo?</i>

75
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:48,563
Cuts across the upper torso.

76
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:51,577
He's been stabbed multiple times.
And he...

77
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,418
he's missing a middle finger.

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,405
It appears to have been swan-off.

79
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:01,708
The other hand, too, Duck.

80
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,835
Anything else you'd care
to tell me about this fellow, Jethro?

81
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:12,879
Dead, 11 years.

82
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:13,796
And?

83
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,214
And I know who did it.

84
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:18,760
Celia Roberts.
A looker.

85
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,523
No, a hooker.

86
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,222
Convicted of killing two sailors.

87
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:25,015
By our very own Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

88
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,266
Before our time.

89
00:04:26,572 --> 00:04:30,141
Both men had multiple stab wounds. Both
men had their middle fingers cut off.

90
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,397
Why the middle finger?

91
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:33,316
Maybe she was giving them
the finger.

92
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:35,745
<i>- Man-hater</i>.
- You would know, Ziva.

93
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:40,466
She was suspected in the disappearance
and murder of Lieutenant Neal Poletto.

94
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:42,302
But since his body was never found,

95
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:44,758
she was only prosecuted
for the other two murders.

96
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,222
She was sentenced to 175 years

97
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:49,093
in the Maryland State Prison
for women.

98
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:51,028
I hear the first hundred years
are the hardest.

99
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:53,525
Well, Abby has confirmed
that the knife that killed Poletto

100
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,589
is the same one that Celia Roberts
used on her first two victims.

101
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:57,738
Open...

102
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:58,800
and shut.

103
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,011
Well, DiNozzo, it'd be easier for
everyone if we just get her to admit it.

104
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:07,183
- I will get a confession.
- Why you?

105
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:08,475
Because I am a woman.

106
00:05:08,638 --> 00:05:10,210
And women open up to other women.

107
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,410
You mean, like <i>Hannah...
and Her Sisters</i>.

108
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:16,234
Come on. After 11 years
in the joint, all ladies,

109
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:18,747
she might welcome
a little change of pace.

110
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:19,904
You mean a man.

111
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:22,990
A virile man could be just
the thing to loosen her lips.

112
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,576
- Oh, you mean Gibbs.
- I mean me.

113
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:27,203
Not that you're not virile.

114
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,005
You are, 'cause you're the boss.
Who's the boss?

115
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:32,250
You don't... those...
those don't go in there.

116
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,497
Get her signed confession.
First thing tomorrow morning.

117
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:45,176
Don't come back without it.

118
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:46,470
You got it, boss.

119
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:51,810
What?

120
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,688
It's just, you got to have the stuff,
be tough, know when to bluff.

121
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,899
So, I have to be a really bad poet?

122
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,526
I call my style tough-bluff.

123
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:00,360
- It's hyphenated.
- Really?

124
00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:03,698
Blowhard actually seems more
appropriate. That is not hyphenated.

125
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:10,550
You're going to convince
a woman to confess to a crime?

126
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,789
Yeah. So?

127
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,251
When's the last time you convinced
a woman to do anything?

128
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:21,548
Just last week, McGee convinced me
to lend him ten dollars.

129
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,792
Ten dollars. Murder one.

130
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:25,440
My last ten dollars.

131
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:27,805
When you asked me,
I was determined to say no.

132
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,941
But there was something
in the way you asked.

133
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:32,351
Before I knew it,
I was opening up my wallet.

134
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:33,316
Really?

135
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:35,897
There's no doubt in my mind
you will get that confession, McGee.

136
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:41,751
Thank you, Ziva.

137
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:44,906
He's toast, isn't he?

138
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:46,158
Oh, yes.

139
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:48,054
Burnt toast.

140
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:55,208
<i>The following inmates
are to report to Facility B...</i>

141
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:58,074
<i>Deborah Hoffman, Leslie Chadwick,</i>

142
00:06:58,273 --> 00:06:59,684
<i>Jessica Boswell,</i>

143
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:02,318

<i>Tiffany...</i>

145
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:06,135
<i>Report to Facility B medical line
immediately.</i>

146
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:14,079
This way, sir.

147
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,485
- Hi.
- Morning.

148
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,821
I put Celia Roberts
in our Attorney Room in back

149
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,597
to give you guys some more privacy.

150
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:27,614
Great. Thanks.

151
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:28,846
Through here.

152
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:30,546
Tim?

153
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:34,996
Brenda Carter.

154
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:36,178
Yeah.

155
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:43,005
I have not seen you since,
oh, what,

156
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:45,925
- graduation night at FLETC?
- Yeah. I remember it well.

157
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,262
Oh, those were your shoes that I...

158
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:52,598
- Italian shoes.
- Oh. Jamaican rum.

159
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:54,343
Empty stomach.

160
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,687
So, I see
you left the federal system.

161
00:07:57,906 --> 00:08:00,690
Yeah. You know,
better pay, closer to home, so...

162
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,227
Well, official visit for me.

163
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:04,318
I'm here to see Celia Roberts.

164
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,529
Oh, well, good luck with that.
Celia's a real piece of work.

165
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:08,864
Most of 'em are.

166
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:12,034
So, where are you stationed?

167
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:13,117
Navy Yard.

168
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:14,802
Well, I'm here.

169
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:16,594
Obviously.

170
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,526
Well, we should...

171
00:08:24,725 --> 00:08:27,769
you know, get together and catch up,
have a drink sometime.

172
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:29,663
Sounds great. Sounds great.
Will you call me?

173
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,555
Or I'll call you. You know,
whatever works, right? So, okay?

174
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:35,744
- Okay.
- Okay.

175
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:37,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

176
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:39,005
Okay!

177
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,305
Bye.

178
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:09,188
Vicari, you flash your boyfriend one
more time, you lose visiting privileges.

179
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:31,573
Hello.

180
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:34,784
I'm Special Agent Timothy McGee.
Thank you for seeing me.

181
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:37,745
Have a choice?

182
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:45,810
Two photos. Same guy.

183
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,693
Lieutenant Neal Poletto.

184
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:49,845
He looks better in this one.

185
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,969
Before and after shots.

186
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:57,402
This one is after
he was stabbed 23 times

187
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:59,392
and had both his middle fingers
cut off.

188
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:02,018
Looks like he's aged a bit, too.

189
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:04,343
About 11 years.

190
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,524
Guess that's why you're here.

191
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,558
You killed two other men
the same way with the same weapon.

192
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:12,243
Yours.

193
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:15,801
It would be nice for the Poletto
family to have some closure.

194
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:18,474
<i>Stop looking at him!</i>

195
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,148
<i>Why don't you shut up, Vicari?</i>

196
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,391
<i>Settle down now.</i>

197
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:25,225
<i>You want to go? Now! Get in!
I'm not gonna tell you again...</i>

198
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,441
You were convicted in Maryland.

199
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:31,365
Poletto's body was found in Virginia.
You know why that's bad for you?

200
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:34,427
Death penalty.

201
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:37,555
Virginia is very big on it.

202
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,934
Confess and this stays
a federal case,

203
00:10:43,213 --> 00:10:46,022
meaning no conviction until after
you've served your current sentence.

204
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:47,534
Meaning never.

205
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,191
Otherwise,

206
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:51,569
I hand this
to the authorities in Virginia.

207
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,668
<i>... Way back.
Way back...</i>

208
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:57,408
I don't like needles.

209
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,191
Your choice.

210
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,331
I don't believe you.

211
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,007
What is that?

212
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,300
Damn!

213
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:16,844
Everything okay out there?

214
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:23,601
Come on.

215
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:34,486
McGee is out, Abby.

216
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:36,895
Oh, yeah, I know.
He's slumming at the prison.

217
00:11:36,955 --> 00:11:40,034
We were supposed to have lunch.
I'm just returning his computer game.

218
00:11:40,643 --> 00:11:43,068
Frankly, I do not understand
the fascination with,

219
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,568
electronic games. It shortens
attention span, curbs productivity

220
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:47,874
and it kills brain cells.

221
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:51,295
Enough with the long sentences.
Who can follow all that?

222
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:53,672
Take a look at this.

223
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,716
This is McGee before he tries
to break the hooker from hell.

224
00:11:56,797 --> 00:11:58,387
And this is him

225
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:00,930
after she gets into his head.

226
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:04,809
How about a picture of you
actually working, DiNozzo?

227
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:07,103
I'm working on... on that.

228
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,523
Yeah, Gibbs.

229
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,853
Yeah.

230
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:12,191
Maryland Women's Prison.

231
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:13,742
Let's go.

232
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:16,362
Wait.
That's where McGee is.

233
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:17,822
Is everything okay?

234
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:21,075
Everything's not okay.
What's happened?

235
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:25,470
I'll call you,

236
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:26,695
all right?

237
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:40,885
They just started whaling on me.

238
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:42,554
- They started it.
- What do we do?

239
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:45,099
- But we finished it.
- No, we didn't finish anything.

240
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:47,183
This is bad.
They're not organized.

241
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:49,395
- I just defended myself.
- What happened?

242
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:51,982
Trimble came in,
bleeding like a stuck pig.

243
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:53,816
Stay put!

244
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,067
- You stay back with the others.
- Who did it?

245
00:12:56,148 --> 00:12:58,737
I didn't see anything. The time I saw
him, he was already on the ground.

246
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:01,323
- It could have been anybody.
- Somebody must have seen something.

247
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:02,710
How are you doing?

248
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:05,202
I think my arm's busted.

249
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:07,745
- What happened?
- One minute, everything's fine.

250
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,125
The next, I saw Trimble stumble
in bleeding, then he went down.

251
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:12,877
And they all just cut loose.

252
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,628
We tried to restore order, but...

253
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:17,325
Anyone see what happened to Trimble?

254
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,569
You may not care
about your family,

255
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:21,753
but I do. We got to get our families
out of here.

256
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:23,796
I say that we give up
before it's too late.

257
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:25,022
That's a good idea.

258
00:13:26,377 --> 00:13:27,182
Who's he?

259
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:28,141
A cop.

260
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,235
All right, they rush us,
you are the first to die.

261
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:35,191
I'm not a cop, I'm an NCIS agent.

262
00:13:35,593 --> 00:13:36,901
Just as dead.

263
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:38,944
Look, I got one year left.

264
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:40,607
I just want to do my time, okay?

265
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:42,986
They're gonna blame all of us
for Trimble. It doesn't matter

266
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:45,034
how much time you got left.
We're all gonna suffer.

267
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:46,159
Angela's right.

268
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:47,978
We're gonna have to protect
ourselves.

269
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,625
There are
two points of entry and an air duct.

270
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,586
Now, will an air duct
support a man's weight?

271
00:13:56,526 --> 00:13:57,549
Come on, people.

272
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,673
We need to know this!
Now, get on it.

273
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:02,384
- Who's in charge here?
- Gene Halsey, the warden.

274
00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:04,344
Gibbs, NCIS.

275
00:14:04,522 --> 00:14:06,996
- We've got an agent here. Where is he?
- Visitor center.

276
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:09,058
- Inmates have control of it.
- He is alive?

277
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:11,101
Don't know.
The cameras are out.

278
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:13,213
You plan to retake this by force?

279
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:15,004
If they don't get out of there
real soon.

280
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:17,358
Till then,
I have this entire prison on lockdown.

281
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,446
And the hostages?

282
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:20,528
This prison has a no-hostage policy,

283
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,283
meaning every man, woman and child
who comes in those gates

284
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:24,865
gives up their right to be rescued.

285
00:14:25,226 --> 00:14:27,993
But believe me, I'm gonna do everything
I can to minimize casualties.

286
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:30,441
I got men in there, too.

287
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:32,497
Now, I'm kind of busy.

288
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:34,602
You have much experience
in hostage recovery?

289
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:36,752
- I have an emergency response plan.
- Okay.

290
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:38,546
Have you ever put it into action?

291
00:14:42,588 --> 00:14:43,843
Take that as a "no".

292
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,897
The one on the left...
what's she in for?

293
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,597
Angela Lopez.

294
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:00,628
Armed robbery,

295
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,278
kidnapping and murder.

296
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:04,029
What about the one next to her?

297
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:06,884
Sharon Bellows,
she killed her boyfriend.

298
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:10,044
Claims he put her
in the hospital a few times.

299
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:12,955
She called it self-defense.
Judge called it manslaughter.

300
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,419
Judy Williams killed
her 80-year-old neighbor for her meds.

301
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,657
- Kayla Vicari. Manufacturing meth.
- What are they saying?

302
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:24,914
They want to send out an ear
or a finger to show we're serious.

303
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:26,135
That's crazy.

304
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:27,636
She's right.

305
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,410
Shouldn't be a guard.
That will really piss them off.

306
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:37,813
He screams, cut his throat.

307
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:40,065
You can watch.

308
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:41,650
- Wait, wait...
- You choose.

309
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:46,598
- This is a bad idea.
- You got a better one?

310
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:54,455
I got a bad feeling about
Bozo and his three-ring circus.

311
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:56,018
Can we go over his head?

312
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:58,066
It's his ball.

313
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,374
Inmate using a confiscated radio
says they want to make some demands.

314
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:06,115
Want to show me they're serious.

315
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:07,551
"Show you"?

316
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,123
One of them's coming out.

317
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:13,985
This is not your jurisdiction,
Agent Gibbs.

318
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,814
How often do you do
this sort of thing?

319
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,006
Open up.

320
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,554
I do the talking, you got that?

321
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:32,785
Gonna find out
who's calling the shots here.

322
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:42,096
- They let you go?
- Not exactly.

323
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:44,171
I'm the negotiator.

324
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:46,924
You're the negotiator?

325
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,748
I sort of talked them into it.

326
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:51,845
All right, what's the situation?

327
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,421
Actually, I've been told
I can only deal directly with my boss,

328
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,742
Special Agent Gibbs.

329
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:58,185
They're watching us right now.

330
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,144
Situation, McGee.

331
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:05,048
Guards handcuffed
in the southwest corner.

332
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:08,800
Inmates spread all over,
armed with batons and shards of glass.

333
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,910
Casualties?

334
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:14,535
There's one dead.
A guard, Hayden Trimble.

335
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:16,647
But he wasn't killed in the riot.

336
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:18,664
Looks like it's his death
that caused it.

337
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:20,873
Another guard injured,
Gordon Lambro.

338
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,601
- What happened?
- Trimble was stabbed.

339
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,364
The guards tried to restore order.
Inmates responded.

340
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:27,670
What do they want?

341
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,820
Assurance that only Trimble's killer
will be punished,

342
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:33,552
and amnesty for injuries
to the other guards.

343
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:35,681
They are gonna hand over
Trimble's killer?

344
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,838
Once we find out who did it.

345
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:40,644
That's where I... you... we...

346
00:17:41,104 --> 00:17:41,977
come in.

347
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:44,979
They want NCIS to figure out
who Trimble's killer is.

348
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:47,985
Which brings me
to their last condition.

349
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:50,195
No attempts to retake
the visitor center.

350
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:52,531
If we agree,

351
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:56,334
they'll release Trimble's body,
the injured guard and the visitors.

352
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,747
That will leave myself
and two other guards as hostages.

353
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:13,217
Get the doors.

354
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:15,516
This way.
Come on, folks. Come on.

355
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:19,058
Move, move!

356
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,587
Through the gate, keep moving.

357
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:21,393
Move.

358
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:23,581
- Get them on the buses.
- Right this way.

359
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:26,065
- Move them out. There we go.
- Quickly!

360
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:29,860
Head count.
22 in, 22 out.

361
00:18:32,435 --> 00:18:33,280
Okay.

362
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,617
For this to work, I'm gonna need
everyone's cooperation and trust.

363
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:39,495
Trust a cop,
that's easier said than done.

364
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:43,040
Believe me, it's no harder
than me trusting a convicted felon.

365
00:18:46,236 --> 00:18:47,294
Now, first thing...

366
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,089
we have to find a murder weapon,
so I am going to have to frisk you.

367
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:53,300
- Frisk who?
- All of you.

368
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:00,598
Who wants to go first?

369
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,052
So much for cooperation.

370
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,179
First murder, then a riot?

371
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:11,853
And we have to solve the murder.

372
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:14,731
Yeah, but it happened in a prison,
which we're not allowed into.

373
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,414
Ducky gets here, I'm going in.

374
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:17,828
If you get the chance.

375
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:18,914
Agent Gibbs.

376
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:23,288
Our guys are here.
Inmates are spread throughout,

377
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:25,457
which means we got to move
when they're grouped.

378
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:27,750
If my team figures this out,
everybody walks out of here.

379
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:30,754
As long as this lasts,
my prison population feels empowered.

380
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:33,839
One way or the other,
this ends at sundown.

381
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,294
Means...

382
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,970
you have seven hours
to end this or I will.

383
00:19:38,664 --> 00:19:40,806
- Trimble have enemies?
- You could say that.

384
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,059
Heroin's been pouring in.
Trimble was my lead investigator.

385
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:46,048
We were trying to turn off
the spigot.

386
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:48,330
Reason enough right there
to try to kill him.

387
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:50,102
Start with Trimble.

388
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,987
McGee is fine, Abby.

389
00:19:58,353 --> 00:20:01,798
Never thought I'd get the chance
to do this to you, Mr. Gibbs.

390
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:04,223
Me, neither, Celia.

391
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:09,084
Don't do anything stupid.

392
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:11,628
Same applies to you, Lopez.

393
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:16,716
I once sewed up the arm of a lion tamer,
and he said the worst thing

394
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:19,970
you can do is to let
your felines feel cornered,

395
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,097
scared or threatened.

396
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,948
You mean like this, Duck?

397
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,649
Nothing happens to him.
You hear me?

398
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:33,734
Or what?

399
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,987
Or you'll wish you'd been sentenced
to death, not life.

400
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:40,782
Okay, you guys mess with this dude,
you mess with Brenda, good to know.

401
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:47,412
From what I can tell,
this is where he fell.

402
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:49,082
The body hasn't been moved.

403
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:51,793
Single stab wound to the chest.

404
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:53,367
He bled out.

405
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:55,358
And slowly.

406
00:20:57,462 --> 00:20:58,859
Can't find the murder weapon.

407
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,734
Given the circumstances,
can't secure the crime scene.

408
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:02,855
Keep looking.

409
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:04,580
He has a head wound.

410
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:06,808
It could have rendered him
unconscious.

411
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:09,334
I followed
the blood trail out this way.

412
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,813
Thanks.

413
00:21:19,656 --> 00:21:20,664
In here.

414
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:25,201
This is the guards' bathroom,
off limits to the prisoners.

415
00:21:26,307 --> 00:21:27,650
He was stabbed in here.

416
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,792
That's where his head
was slammed against the wall.

417
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:35,097
Seat's down.

418
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:37,860
Guess he wasn't here to use it.

419
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:39,334
Figure he had company.

420
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:40,658
You think, Sherlock?

421
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,034
Women's prison, it happens.

422
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,295
Shoot even happens in men's prisons.

423
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:48,188
Look, for this to work, we really need
to treat everyone as suspects.

424
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:49,962
So please, just let us do this.

425
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,302
They're coming in before sundown.

426
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:04,449
Boss, that doesn't give us
enough time to...

427
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:07,577
S.O.P. for inmates
to use the head.

428
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,722
Guard inside the visitor center

429
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:12,717
let them out here into the corridor
where Trimble was keeping watch.

430
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:15,223
Trimble was supposed
to notify the other guards

431
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:17,250
if he needs to use
the bathroom, he never did.

432
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,486
Probably 'cause he was doing
something he shouldn't have.

433
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,088
Cost him his life.

434
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:24,678
Cameras?

435
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:26,178
Only in the visitor center.

436
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:27,361
Blood evidence.

437
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:29,538
Most of the inmates and guards
have blood on them.

438
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,394
- I'm sure some of it's Trimble's but...
- Doesn't single out anybody.

439
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:33,854
Need to find his killer.

440
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,698
Yeah, in a room full of them.

441
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:48,784
- They haven't hurt McGee, have they?
- We have not heard anything.

442
00:22:48,948 --> 00:22:50,829
Got something for you
from Trimble's apartment.

443
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:52,664
We need to figure
this out before sunset.

444
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,166
Define "before sunset".

445
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:56,168
Before the sun goes down.

446
00:22:57,874 --> 00:22:59,563
Ethan Hawke movie with Julie...

447
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:01,909
What was that for?

448
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:05,968
The sun sets at around 5:02.

449
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,304
So does that mean
we have until 5:01?

450
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:09,430
Before sunset.

451
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:10,766
That could mean now.

452
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,809
Not good enough.
I can't take this.

453
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:16,229
Every day you guys go out and I never
know if you're going to make it back.

454
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,445
It's killing me.
I can't sleep at night.

455
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,650
I'm developing
some sort of weird twitch.

456
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:22,943
Our work is sometimes dangerous,
Abby.

457
00:23:23,024 --> 00:23:24,361
Then get a safer job.

458
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:25,906
Then you wouldn't see us at all.

459
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:26,989
True.

460
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:29,575
Still... sucks.

461
00:23:34,643 --> 00:23:36,362
Fingerprints, hard drive...

462
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:37,875
bedsheets.

463
00:23:37,956 --> 00:23:40,253
Evidence
of extracurricular activities.

464
00:23:41,082 --> 00:23:42,755
McGee's going to be okay, right?

465
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:45,943
You kidding? Stuck in a women's prison.
It's every guy's fantasy.

466
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:50,388
Well, maybe not McGee.

467
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:53,694
Here. What's that?

468
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:56,403
- Check there.
- Look, can you...

469
00:23:56,463 --> 00:23:58,522
can you please just all just
give me some room here?

470
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,769
It's very difficult looking for
this murder weapon

471
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:02,566
with everyone in my way here, so...

472
00:24:03,335 --> 00:24:04,519
Come on, y'all.

473
00:24:06,193 --> 00:24:07,197
Thank you.

474
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:18,041
When's the food's coming?

475
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:19,214
Soon.

476
00:24:20,924 --> 00:24:21,753
Pizza?

477
00:24:22,526 --> 00:24:23,648
Yeah, maybe.

478
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,559
You like pizza?

479
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:28,009
Pepperoni. You?

480
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,887
Yeah, pepperoni's good.

481
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:36,768
This sort of thing happen much?

482
00:24:37,564 --> 00:24:39,271
Never in my 15 years here.

483
00:24:41,368 --> 00:24:43,560
You've known Celia
since she's been in here?

484
00:24:43,777 --> 00:24:44,519
Yeah.

485
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:46,486
She ever talk about what she did?

486
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:48,738
Just to blame the system.

487
00:24:51,361 --> 00:24:54,077
You seem to have taken
responsibility for your crimes.

488
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:55,619
It's a mixed blessing.

489
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:58,456
First few years here,
I was angry at everybody.

490
00:24:58,629 --> 00:25:01,155
Blamed the world
for my crappy childhood.

491
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:06,256
Then I got into a prison program
training seeing-eye dogs...

492
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,176
One day I'm training
this puppy and it hits me.

493
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:15,294
I killed an innocent person
who didn't do me no harm.

494
00:25:20,163 --> 00:25:22,398
Now I can't wait till the day I die,

495
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:27,861
so I can find that soul and apologize
for the terrible thing I did.

496
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,587
Look, I don't know if Celia
did the things they say.

497
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,374
And if she did,

498
00:25:37,048 --> 00:25:39,206
I don't know what it'll take
for her to face up to it.

499
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:43,313
Yeah, Abs?

500
00:25:43,443 --> 00:25:44,445
<i>How's McGee?</i>

501
00:25:44,505 --> 00:25:45,937
Well, he's fine.

502
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:48,131
- What do you got?
- Define "fine".

503
00:25:48,437 --> 00:25:50,759
He needs us to do our job
before sundown.

504
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:52,800
Okay.

505
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,472
Ducky found calcium oxalate crystals
in the dead guard's kidneys.

506
00:25:56,553 --> 00:25:57,933
<i>Well, that's a huge red flag.</i>

507
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,707
So I ran a special tox screen and,
sure enough, it turned up.

508
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:04,064
<i>- What?</i>
- Ethylene glycol.

509
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:05,314
Antifreeze.

510
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:07,900
Yeah,
someone was poisoning him, Gibbs.

511
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:10,237
He died from the stab wound,

512
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,952
but with the levels of ethylene glycol
in Trimble's system,

513
00:26:13,012 --> 00:26:14,740
he was a dead man walking anyways.

514
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:25,668
None of the visitors or the injured
guard saw Trimble get stabbed, Boss.

515
00:26:25,923 --> 00:26:28,046
<i>The DEA is cross-checking
all inmates with links</i>

516
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:29,355
to known drug dealers.

517
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:31,295
I got a feeling
that's going to be a long list.

518
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:33,717
- They're checking prison employees.
- Security footage.

519
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:34,844
Got it right here.

520
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:37,054
<i>- And?</i>
- I'll be like your closed captioning.

521
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:38,379
My what?

522
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:40,342
I'll talk. You listen.

523
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:43,104
By my count, six inmates

524
00:26:43,164 --> 00:26:45,522
entered the restroom
corridor during visiting hours.

525
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:47,524
Then we get Trimble.

526
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:49,651
He enters, obviously hurt.

527
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:51,444
Guard hurries to him.

528
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:53,446
Inmate lookie-loos hover.

529
00:26:53,527 --> 00:26:54,617
Push. Shove.

530
00:26:55,826 --> 00:26:56,993
Out comes the baton.

531
00:26:58,032 --> 00:26:59,034
Then static.

532
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:00,245
Static?

533
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,377
<i>Static.</i>

534
00:27:01,437 --> 00:27:02,663
We got the PG version.

535
00:27:02,991 --> 00:27:04,584
The Warden Halsey cut.

536
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:07,711
Maybe he did not want to show
how physical his guards got.

537
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:09,461
Or he has something else to hide.

538
00:27:09,652 --> 00:27:12,423
DiNozzo, give McGee the names
of all the women who used the head.

539
00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:13,425
<i>Done, boss.</i>

540
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:15,010
<i>I checked Trimble's phone records.</i>

541
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,387
One person called him
over 150 times last month.

542
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:20,724
It was another prison guard
by the name of...

543
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:22,642
Brenda Carter.

544
00:27:22,735 --> 00:27:23,865
Five calls a day.

545
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:26,478
I'd give her an eight on
the DiNozzo Psycho Chick Meter.

546
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,962
Ten being Glenn Close
in <i>Fatal Attraction</i>.

547
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,935
Look at those eyes, crazy eyes.

548
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:33,027
- I'll send her over.
- <i>Got it.</i>

549
00:27:34,468 --> 00:27:35,469
Crazy eyes.

550
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:44,706
Why we couldn't have done this at the
prison. This could go down at any time.

551
00:27:44,786 --> 00:27:47,973
We want to stop it from "going down",
as you say.

552
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,211
Okay, so you need to know
about these women, right?

553
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:53,965
Actually, I'd prefer to know more
about Hayden Trimble.

554
00:27:55,658 --> 00:27:56,460
Okay.

555
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,303
You knew him well?

556
00:27:58,515 --> 00:27:59,970
Yeah, sure.
We worked together.

557
00:28:00,285 --> 00:28:01,288
Come on.

558
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:03,807
It was more than just
a working relationship, was it not?

559
00:28:04,052 --> 00:28:05,052
We dated.

560
00:28:05,536 --> 00:28:08,480
- When did he break up with you?
- We broke up last month.

561
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:09,874
But it was mutual.

562
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:12,444
And since then, you have called him
more than 150 times

563
00:28:12,504 --> 00:28:14,534
and he has not called you back
even once.

564
00:28:14,941 --> 00:28:16,555
Does not sound very mutual to me.

565
00:28:16,615 --> 00:28:19,472
On our third date,
he said he loved me.

566
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,930
I didn't have to say it first.

567
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,225
But you said it last.

568
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:27,873
Men can be jerks.
I know.

569
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:29,389
You think that I...?

570
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,939
No, I was out of the building
when he was killed.

571
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:33,999
Were you?

572
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:36,633
Did you know that someone
was poisoning him?

573
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:37,803
Wha...?

574
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,303
Okay, look, I-I might've thought
about wringing his neck

575
00:28:42,363 --> 00:28:43,640
but I didn't kill him.

576
00:28:43,804 --> 00:28:46,893
Trimble was investigating
drug smuggling into the prison.

577
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,978
He was avoiding me the last month.

578
00:28:50,358 --> 00:28:52,193
I thought he was seeing another woman.

579
00:28:52,253 --> 00:28:54,109
I left him
a bunch of nasty messages.

580
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:56,653
Drug investigation?

581
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:58,655
According to Warden Halsey.

582
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,450
What?

583
00:29:04,806 --> 00:29:06,100
It's probably nothing.

584
00:29:07,306 --> 00:29:09,928
But drug screening is mandatory
for all employees.

585
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:11,166
So?

586
00:29:11,307 --> 00:29:13,253
So I'm friend
with the warden's assistant.

587
00:29:13,756 --> 00:29:16,908
She told me that the warden missed
his last mandatory drug screening.

588
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:19,058
And he faked the one before that.

589
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:46,869
What?

590
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:00,425
My experience, whenever a cop wants
to talk in an interview room,

591
00:30:01,056 --> 00:30:02,432
nothing good comes of it.

592
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:06,014
Look a bit jittery.

593
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:11,109
Coming down with something.
Mind your business.

594
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,624
Right now,
my business is investigating this crime.

595
00:30:14,866 --> 00:30:17,662
And we believe that Trimble's murder
could be drug-related.

596
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:22,015
And it looks like you're going through
some withdrawal.

597
00:30:22,944 --> 00:30:23,749
Really?

598
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:24,790
Really.

599
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,238
I don't like your tone.

600
00:30:52,562 --> 00:30:54,690
- Shut it down.
- It's my prison, Agent Gibbs.

601
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:56,064
Not for long.

602
00:30:57,604 --> 00:30:58,909
You pee in a cup lately?

603
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:02,231
I'm taking medication
for a heart condition.

604
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,312
Prison Board might think
I can't handle the stress.

605
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:08,116
Faking a drug test is a firing offense.
You shut it down. Now!

606
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:10,300
- You blackmailing me?
- I'm negotiating.

607
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,733
- You said sundown.
- I said before sundown.

608
00:31:15,171 --> 00:31:16,751
Now you have less than two hours.

609
00:31:17,328 --> 00:31:18,367
After that,

610
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,726
I'll take my chance
with the Prison Board.

611
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:23,877
Heating. Lights.

612
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:32,878
Great.

613
00:31:35,304 --> 00:31:36,363
What's going on?

614
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:38,126
That's it.

615
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:39,272
I'm finished.

616
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:40,630
I'm done, all right?

617
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,024
You want to know who killed Trimble,
figure it out yourselves.

618
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:44,071
See what you did?

619
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:46,066
Maybe you'd think differently
if I took your ear.

620
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:48,430
I've never hit a woman,
but if you come at me with that thing,

621
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,632
- I will drop you.
- I got just one year left.

622
00:31:50,692 --> 00:31:52,579
I got three kids to raise, please?

623
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,873
They come in here shooting,
you're in the firing line, same as us.

624
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:59,002
Shoot me up. Slice me up.
It doesn't matter, okay?

625
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,243
Because I'm done.

626
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:03,256
I'm done unless you tell me
the name of your supplier.

627
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,136
- Now!
- Lambro.

628
00:32:08,297 --> 00:32:09,554
The guard you let out.

629
00:32:18,954 --> 00:32:20,329
Inmates gave you up.

630
00:32:20,954 --> 00:32:23,164
Women and secrets
make a bad combination.

631
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:25,485
- What secrets?
- You're a dealer.

632
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,347
- You believe them?
- Prison guard as an inmate.

633
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:30,105
I hear they make you prom queen.

634
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:31,644
And every night is prom night.

635
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:35,946
You talk now and we'll make sure you're
not put in with the general population.

636
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:38,416
They make some crazy accusations
and you believe them?

637
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:43,503
I believe this.

638
00:32:43,585 --> 00:32:45,672
- Found it in your SUV.
- Must be a plant.

639
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:47,758
I got no time for this, Lambro!

640
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,553
- Now you've made him angry.
- Trimble was onto your operation.

641
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:52,257
- No.
- First you poisoned him.

642
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:55,433
- Then you stabbed him.
- No, you've got this so freaking wrong!

643
00:33:01,699 --> 00:33:02,885
I was dealing,

644
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:04,848
but I didn't kill him.

645
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:07,833
Trimble wasn't trying to bring down
the drug operation.

646
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:09,112
He was the head of it.

647
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,001
Thank you.

648
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:22,572
DEA says Trimble's stepbrother
is a known drug dealer.

649
00:33:22,632 --> 00:33:24,467
Could be Trimble's drug source.

650
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:27,199
Supports Lambro's story
that Trimble headed the operation.

651
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:28,762
Doesn't get Lambro off the hook.

652
00:33:28,822 --> 00:33:31,469
Well, maybe Lambro wanted
to take over the operation.

653
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:34,116
Maybe he has
a different supply source.

654
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,075
- Where does that leave us?
- With a lot of maybes.

655
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,450
- Yeah. Gibbs.
<i>- Can you come to the lab?</i>

656
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,604
I'll be right there.

657
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:49,237
What are you doing?

658
00:33:49,317 --> 00:33:52,115
Tapping into Trimble's e-mail
account on the prison network.

659
00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:53,991
And they call us criminals.

660
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:56,950
What?

661
00:33:57,598 --> 00:33:59,137
You are a criminal, Celia.

662
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:01,834
You don't know me.

663
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,929
What do you got?

664
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:18,060
I might have overstepped
my bounds here a little bit.

665
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,559
I know I'm not a field agent.

666
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,766
I called the prison and I got
Lambro's work schedule.

667
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:22,749
Okay, because?

668
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:25,189
Because I wanted to compare
Lambro's schedule

669
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:27,358
to when the antifreeze
showed up in Trimble's system.

670
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,027
I also got the urine

671
00:34:30,107 --> 00:34:31,833
from Trimble's last drug test.

672
00:34:31,893 --> 00:34:33,347
He was clean for illegal drugs,

673
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:36,034
but I was able to figure out
when he ingested the antifreeze.

674
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:38,036
24 hours before the test,

675
00:34:38,116 --> 00:34:40,788
Lambro was at a conference
in Pennsylvania for a whole week,

676
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:42,313
so it couldn't have been him.

677
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,752
By the way,
if they ask you at the prison,

678
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:47,234
I'm your boss.

679
00:34:48,209 --> 00:34:49,546
Wait, Gibbs, there's more.

680
00:34:49,627 --> 00:34:51,338
I analyzed Trimble's bedsheets.

681
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:53,550
There is no direct match
to anyone at the prison.

682
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:55,385
- Direct match?
- Exactly.

683
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:56,951
That's where it gets interesting.

684
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:59,175
The DNA on Trimble's bedsheets

685
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:01,851
belongs to a relative
of a current inmate.

686
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:04,728
Zoe Bellows.

687
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,560
Mother is Sharon Bellows.

688
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:08,899
Sentenced to ten years
for killing her boyfriend.

689
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,985
She claimed he was abusive and
had some medical history to back it up.

690
00:35:12,225 --> 00:35:14,447
- One year left on her sentence.
- The daughter.

691
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:17,291
She was not at the visitor center
when Trimble died.

692
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,411
- Sun goes down in 63 minutes, boss.
- Bring the girl in.

693
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:21,954
Find me a paper trail.

694
00:35:27,803 --> 00:35:28,910
How you doing?

695
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:30,755
Okay.

696
00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:35,217
You know this man?

697
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,262
No.

698
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:50,881
We found your DNA on his bed.

699
00:35:52,966 --> 00:35:54,677
- Where is he?
- Dead.

700
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,713
First time he saw me,
I was visiting my mom.

701
00:36:06,055 --> 00:36:08,623
The way he was looking at me
just gave me the creeps.

702
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:12,251
And then he found out
where I went to school.

703
00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:15,708
And then one day
he was waiting for me.

704
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:20,050
He said he would hurt her if I...
if I didn't...

705
00:36:21,196 --> 00:36:22,261
you know.

706
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:25,361
He said his friends
would kill my mom if I told on him.

707
00:36:26,861 --> 00:36:29,732
The first time he did it,
I was so disgusted, I threw up.

708
00:36:32,547 --> 00:36:34,254
Then he started shooting me up.

709
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,203
Between my toes.

710
00:36:40,377 --> 00:36:42,381
- You tell your mother?
- No.

711
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:45,660
So you took matters
into your own hands?

712
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:47,607
I just wanted him to stop...

713
00:36:49,189 --> 00:36:50,469
and he just wouldn't.

714
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:53,053
Spiking his drinks with antifreeze?

715
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,975
I killed him.

716
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:00,308
No, you didn't.

717
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:04,637
But you... you said he was dead.

718
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:12,880
- The car.
- On it.

719
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:13,813
Now.

720
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:20,362
Several of the inmates here
have identified the girl

721
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:22,079
in that photo as your daughter.

722
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,235
How did you find out that she and
Trimble were having a relationship?

723
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:30,282
You saw that photo.
She didn't want to be there.

724
00:37:30,684 --> 00:37:32,812
He was e-mailing it
around to the other guards.

725
00:37:32,957 --> 00:37:33,761
What?

726
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:36,321
Did one of them show you?

727
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:38,758
Or did Trimble?

728
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,137
Sharon, you found out
about it and you killed him.

729
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,376
One year that's all I have left.

730
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:51,436
Had left.

731
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:55,470
I have two other daughters.
They're ten and they're 12.

732
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,972
At least I could still be
a good mother to them.

733
00:37:58,073 --> 00:37:59,312
Not anymore, honey.

734
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,080
They're my babies.

735
00:38:04,188 --> 00:38:06,490
They're bringing dinner. On carts.

736
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:10,829
Call 'em back.

737
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:14,323
- It's too late, Agent Gibbs.
- I said call 'em back!

738
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:20,043
Sharon, if they come through that door,
people are going to get hurt.

739
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:22,753
You're going to get us all killed,
Bellows.

740
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:24,031
Come on, Sharon.

741
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:25,263
Please.

742
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:28,095
- Please.
- They stopped.

743
00:38:28,356 --> 00:38:31,379
They're not bringing in the food.
I really don't think they got any.

744
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,614
- Yeah.
- Zoe Bellows.

745
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,983
- Already on it, boss.
- Two minutes, McGee.

746
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:45,612
Got to go.

747
00:38:48,073 --> 00:38:49,209
Where is she?

748
00:39:14,402 --> 00:39:16,954
Tell the warden
he can have Trimble's killer.

749
00:39:27,468 --> 00:39:28,823
Sometimes this job sucks.

750
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:31,542
Sharon Bellows was in for killing
an abusive boyfriend.

751
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:34,957
And while she's inside, her daughter's
being abused. Trimble was scum.

752
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:36,836
Makes no difference
in the eyes of the law.

753
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,658
- Hence the word "sucks".
- Yeah.

754
00:39:38,718 --> 00:39:40,225
<i>- On my way out.</i>
- Okay.

755
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:44,079
My agent's coming out.

756
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,594
Stand by.

757
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,001
- Where is she?
- Saying good-bye.

758
00:39:59,587 --> 00:40:00,785
You okay, McGee?

759
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:02,863
Yeah.

760
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,974
Did any of them hurt you, McGee?

761
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:06,569
I will kick their ass.

762
00:40:07,795 --> 00:40:08,972
I'm fine, Ziva.

763
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,563
- She's coming out.
- Door's opening.

764
00:40:25,435 --> 00:40:27,934
That's not who I was expecting
to see, boss.

765
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,550
That's your murder weapon.

766
00:40:36,658 --> 00:40:37,912
I killed Trimble.

767
00:40:42,252 --> 00:40:43,881
- They're ready to give up.
- Move in.

768
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,256
- Let's go. Move. Go.
- Don't hurt them.

769
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,990
Trimble was raping
Sharon Bellows' daughter.

770
00:40:54,156 --> 00:40:56,639
- And smuggling drugs.
- Was Sharon in on it?

771
00:40:57,157 --> 00:40:59,409
No, all my own work.

772
00:40:59,785 --> 00:41:01,500
Sharon didn't want a part of it.

773
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,879
Just wants to get out
and be a mom again.

774
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,335
That sailor
you were asking me about.

775
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:11,136
Lieutenant Poletto.

776
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:13,235
I killed him, too.

777
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:17,604
Sorry I did.

778
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:23,266
- That a confession?
- I'll write it all down for you.

779
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,516
Do any of us really believe
that Celia killed Trimble?

780
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,914
I don't think anyone is going to lose
any sleep over it.

781
00:41:41,974 --> 00:41:43,344
You write it up, Tim.

782
00:41:44,548 --> 00:41:47,150
McGee, you're home.

783
00:41:48,058 --> 00:41:49,551
Good to see you, too, Abs.

784
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:51,738
We had total confidence in you,
McGee.

785
00:41:52,403 --> 00:41:53,429
Obviously.

786
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:57,027
Well, maybe just a moment of doubt.

787
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:07,064
You told me my car
would be ready today.

788
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:08,563
One octave or two?

789
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:13,977
Listen up because this is
what you're going to do.

790
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,865
You're going to take
the first estimate

791
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:18,160
and you're going to reduce it
by ten percent.

792
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,495
Then, you're going to find my part,
install the part,

793
00:42:22,096 --> 00:42:24,069
and have my car parked out front

794
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:27,376
and ready for me when I walk out
of this building in 32 minutes.

795
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,923
Who would guess that McGee
would grow a pair in a women's prison?

796
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:33,838
I put away killers for a living.

797
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,935
That's what I do. Now, you do

798
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:39,176
exactly as I told you
and we won't have any problems.

799
00:42:39,747 --> 00:42:40,923
Understood?

800
00:42:42,237 --> 00:42:43,269
Good.

801
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:44,997
Clock's ticking.

802
00:42:47,622 --> 00:42:50,316
Your time in the Big House
really changed you.

803
00:42:51,846 --> 00:42:53,024
I like it.
