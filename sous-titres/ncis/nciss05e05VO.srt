2
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:13,512
I've got that marketing meeting at 1:30.
You got to make this quick.

3
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:16,245
Not too quick.

4
00:00:17,547 --> 00:00:20,132
You think Anderson's secretary
saw us leaving together?

5
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:21,686
We were going to lunch.

6
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:24,677
She's been looking at me funny
the last couple weeks.

7
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:26,375
She knows my husband.

8
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:33,136
What the hell is that?

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,962
Thought you'd like it.

15
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:31,971
Your sailor's real nervous.

16
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:34,885
Tried to talk to him,
but he's not making a lot of sense.

17
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:37,841
- You get his name?
- No. Shut down.

18
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,253
Threatened to jump
if we didn't back off.

19
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:42,258
Hose jockeys want to set an airbag.

20
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:43,487
That height?

21
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:45,847
I don't think it's going to make
much of a difference.

22
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:49,083
I don't think Gibbs knows.

23
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:50,507
Not going to hear it from me.

24
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,062
Not going to hear what from you?

25
00:01:52,268 --> 00:01:54,024
Abby may have gotten a job offer.

26
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:55,839
- Big bucks.
- Allegedly.

27
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:56,894
Private sector.

28
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:58,267
Still just a rumor, Tony.

29
00:01:58,374 --> 00:02:00,780
Not anymore, probie-san.
Someone from Human Resources

30
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:03,242
told a friend of a friend that Abby
had cocktails last night

31
00:02:03,277 --> 00:02:05,377
at the Ritz-Carlton
with a corporate headhunter.

32
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:06,730
And this friend told you?

33
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,819
Not exactly.
I overheard it in the elevator.

34
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:11,311
Very reliable source.

35
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,440
Abby was probably on a date.

36
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:16,644
Abby on a date at the Ritz-Carlton?

37
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:18,443
Strictly business time, Ziva.

38
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:19,778
They say which business?

39
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:22,105
Well, the elevator reached my floor,
I had to get off.

40
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:23,938
Oh, that's a long way up.

41
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:25,417
Long way down.

42
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:33,708
Okay, so what you want to do is gain
his confidence here, boss.

43
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:36,748
He's been out there for a while.
He's obviously having second thoughts.

44
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:38,392
Stay.

45
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,476
Get away from me.

46
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:45,501
Just want to talk.

47
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:46,639
No!

48
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:49,497
Make it easier if I knew your name.

49
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:53,172
- Where you stationed?
- I said leave me alone!

50
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:03,975
Boss, you know, we could snap a picture
of him with a cell,

51
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:07,025
e-mail it to Abby, get her to run it
through photo-recognition.

52
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:08,956
If he went to the Academy,
we get a quick ID.

53
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:09,846
Do it.

54
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:11,028
Me?

55
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:12,456
It's your idea, McGee.

56
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:13,648
Right.

57
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:28,994
Boss?

58
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:33,529
I'm not very good with heights.

59
00:03:35,706 --> 00:03:37,076
Point. Point and click.

60
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,041
Don't come any closer!

61
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,152
- What are you doing?
- Wouldn't give me your name.

62
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:43,653
Want to know who you are.

63
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,780
Yeah.

64
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:55,384
Great view of the Washington Monument
from up here.

65
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,075
- Abigail?
- What's up, Doc?

66
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:02,013
Had a report for Jethro, but I...

67
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:03,320
Is that what I think it is?

68
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:07,318
If you're thinking it's a firearm,
the answer is yes.

69
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:09,274
I thought you might have seen him.

70
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:11,312
<i>He appears to be in his late 20s,</i>
<i>although,</i>

71
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:14,066
<i>from my vantage point,</i>
<i>that is very difficult to confirm.</i>

72
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:17,425
McGee, he's got a gun.

73
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:21,720
Boss, he's got a gun.

74
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,202
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:26,146
I know that, McGee.
I see that.

76
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:34,912
I'm running the image
against the last ten Academy classes.

77
00:04:34,945 --> 00:04:37,337
What could make a young man
so desperate?

78
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:40,876
I got it, McGee.

79
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:43,623
<i>Boss,</i>
<i>his name is Lieutenant Michael Arnett.</i>

80
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:45,225
<i>Stationed at the Pentagon.</i>

81
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:47,485
Academy class of '01.

82
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:49,302
He's a linguist, translator.

83
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:50,846
Married, no kids.

84
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,113
So, Michael?

85
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,416
You mind if I call you Michael?

86
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,969
You can't help.

87
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:00,843
I can try.

88
00:05:02,144 --> 00:05:02,955
Don't.

89
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:07,247
I do not have a shot.

90
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:08,638
<i>I'll hit Gibbs, too.</i>

91
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:09,834
Lean back, boss.

92
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:11,091
Just ease back.

93
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:18,143
Damn you, Gibbs!

94
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:20,095
You take too many chances.

95
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:21,835
All right, boss, his wife

96
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:24,478
works at a travel agency on K Street.

97
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:25,736
<i>Name's Dana.</i>

98
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:27,067
<i>She's at lunch.</i>

99
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:28,744
<i>Her boss has no idea where she went.</i>

100
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:31,159
Trying to get a hold of your wife.
You want to talk to her?

101
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,970
No!

102
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:35,975
She left me.

103
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:38,835
Yeah. I've been there.

104
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:41,168
That's tough.

105
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:44,964
It's not worth your life.

106
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,285
It's more complicated than that.

107
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,843
Tell me.

108
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:53,482
It's too late.

109
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,703
He's got a sister.

110
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:56,854
<i>Her name's Rachel.</i>

111
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:58,147
You want to talk to Rachel?

112
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:02,158
How old is she?

113
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:05,034
17.

114
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:07,052
17?

115
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:09,850
What does that make her...
a senior in high school?

116
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:13,475
You want Rachel to remember
this from her senior year?

117
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:18,604
I don't want to make that call, Mike.

118
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,589
Why don't we start with the gun, huh?

119
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:33,168
I really messed up.

120
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,300
I should have told someone.

121
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:37,936
You tell me.

122
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,295
I'll help you.

123
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,609
You can trust me.

124
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:46,713
Put it down.

125
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,273
I'll help you.

126
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,789
Take it really easy.

127
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:41,894
Slug is flattened.

128
00:07:41,914 --> 00:07:43,554
Not much for Abby to work with.

129
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:45,774
She had success with less.

130
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,470
Shot definitely came from the building
across from the hotel.

131
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:50,076
Door to the rooftop was picked.

132
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:52,149
No shell casings, no prints, nothing.

133
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:54,375
Several people
in the building heard the shot.

134
00:07:54,394 --> 00:07:56,094
Witnesses on the street saw the flash.

135
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:58,957
Guy's going to kill himself. When
he doesn't, someone does it for him.

136
00:07:58,958 --> 00:07:59,768
Why?

137
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:03,034
Arnett's apartment.

138
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,932
Color back now that you're on terra
firma there, probalicious?

139
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:07,805
- Hey, I would have done it...
- Only...

140
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:09,940
you didn't.

141
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:12,068
I think he's more afraid
of heights than you are.

142
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,338
Please. I rock-climbed.

143
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:15,392
Yeah.
20 feet,

144
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,258
with a harness, to impress a girl.

145
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,351
Well, it worked.

146
00:08:30,624 --> 00:08:32,494
Having an eyewitness like you makes

147
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:34,086
my job a lot easier.

148
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:40,575
Nevertheless, I will get you autopsy
results post-haste.

149
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:41,875
Thanks, Duck.

150
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,815
There's absolutely
no evidence a woman lived here.

151
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,158
Manager said she moved out a week ago.

152
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:57,246
Gibbs was right.

153
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:59,219
In a divorce, the guy gets screwed.

154
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,940
She left him diddly-squat.

155
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:02,832
Maybe she had a good reason
to leave him.

156
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,831
Poor guy's sleeping on a blow-up bed.

157
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:07,061
Good marriage needs good communication.

158
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,290
Here's another reason
he'd want to end it all:

159
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:11,636
Rejuvinator.

160
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:14,568
Arnett was losing his hair.

161
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,561
Maybe he didn't talk to her anymore.

162
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:19,453
He was younger than I am.

163
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:20,717
Or didn't listen.

164
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:24,075
She did leave him something.

165
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:27,856
A sad commentary on the state
of matrimony?

166
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,556
No. A pink toothbrush.

167
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:39,268
I'm fast, but I'm not that fast.

168
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:42,330
Something still bothering you?

169
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:44,372
Yeah.

170
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:47,252
We're investigating a homicide
and a suicide.

171
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:49,416
Was the reason the lieutenant
was out on the ledge

172
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:50,883
the same reason that he was shot?

173
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,719
I guess you wouldn't know that yet,
would you?

174
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:57,501
He was coming in.

175
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:03,213
Wanted to tell me something.

176
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,225
Confucius say:

177
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:13,417
<i>"Life's many pleasures await you."</i>

178
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:15,566
What yours say?

179
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:20,809
<i>"As you approach life's crossroads,
look both ways."</i>

180
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:23,510
I'm sure it's meaningful.

181
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,757
Just think about it and
search your inner self.

182
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:29,486
"Lisa Nerlman, Hypnotherapist."

183
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:33,348
- What is this for?
- She does wonders with phobias.

184
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:35,283
Tony, who else did you tell?

185
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:38,693
I told you it was a very
sensitive subject, Abby.

186
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:40,234
Your turn.

187
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:43,249
I refuse to make decisions
based on stupid

188
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:45,147
sayings stuffed inside stale cookies.

189
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:50,454
<i>"Welcome an invitation that change
your financial future. "</i>

190
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:53,376
Got to go.

191
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:56,984
That was incredible.

192
00:10:57,203 --> 00:10:59,241
It was fate
that Abby opened that cookie.

193
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:01,569
She's good.
She didn't blink an eye.

194
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:03,242
That's why I don't play poker with her.

195
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:04,318
No tell.

196
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:06,213
He was sleeping on an air mattress,
boss.

197
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:07,043
The wife?

198
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:09,719
Staying at Lafayette Court Hotel.
She's coming in at 5:00.

199
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,397
Wants to talk to Arnett's parents first.

200
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:13,451
Would have bet we'd find
a suicide note. No luck.

201
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,783
That'd be too easy.

202
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,490
I took his computer down to Abby.

203
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:17,848
Maybe she will get lucky.

204
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:19,877
He's a second-generation American.

205
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,187
Grandparents emigrated from Syria.

206
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:24,326
His fluency in Arabic led
to his advancement

207
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:26,206
and special assignments
in the Middle East.

208
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:29,081
Presently assigned at the Office
of the Deputy Secretary

209
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,034
of Defense for Combating Terrorism.

210
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:34,511
Other than that, I can't tell you much.
I'm getting stonewalled by the Pentagon.

211
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,494
They won't even connect me to his CO.

212
00:11:37,052 --> 00:11:38,093
Yeah, Gibbs.

213
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:40,780
On my way.

214
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:43,067
Let's go, McGee.
You're with me.

215
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:46,156
Special Agent Gibbs.

216
00:11:46,191 --> 00:11:48,544
Captain Walsh, Lieutenant Arnett's CO.

217
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:51,356
You're a hard man to reach.

218
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,244
<i>My hands were tied.</i>

219
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:55,682
<i>I had to get permission
from the Director of National</i>

220
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:56,889
<i>Intelligence to talk to you.</i>

221
00:11:56,922 --> 00:11:58,740
SecNav has to make a decision.

222
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,380
<i>Unless you can tell me Lieutenant
Arnett's murder was unrelated</i>

223
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:03,693
<i>to his Navy duties,
my unit's going into lockdown.</i>

224
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,227
I can't tell you that, Captain.

225
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,089
We're just beginning our investigation.

226
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:10,342
<i>How long is this going to take?</i>

227
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:11,532
At this point,

228
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:14,127
no one will even tell me
what Arnett does.

229
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:15,515
<i>Did.</i>

230
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:17,989
Captain Walsh just briefed me

231
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:20,497
on Lieutenant Arnett's general duties.

232
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,781
He was an Arab-speaking
intelligence officer,

233
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:25,442
working assets in the Middle East.

234
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:28,630
<i>Personally responsible
for exposing a number of Al-Qaeda ops.</i>

235
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,540
<i>I'm sure he was high on their hit list.</i>

236
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,819
What was he working on?

237
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,739
<i>Tracking down an Al-Qaeda operative.</i>

238
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:36,110
- Where?
<i>- Right here.<i>

239
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:37,173
<i>In DC.</i>

240
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:39,105
<i>What the hell happened up there?</i>

241
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,338
He was going to jump.

242
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:42,900
<i>Why?</i>

243
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:44,552
Working on it.

244
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:47,952
<i>We've got an Al-Qaeda
operative on the loose.</i>

245
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:50,683
<i>If you'd done your job
and pulled Arnett off that ledge,</i>

246
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:52,605
<i>my best man wouldn't be dead.</i>

247
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,161
<i>So, you'd better be working on it.</i>

248
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:11,210
Unit's in lockdown.
All work's been secured.

249
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,987
The section restricted to quarters.

250
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:15,982
National security's at risk,
my people are sitting on their hands.

251
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,556
How long is this going to take?

252
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,555
We're working as fast as we can.

253
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:23,241
When was the last time
you saw Lieutenant Arnett?

254
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:25,116
Two days ago.

255
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:27,141
He seemed fine.

256
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:28,625
Called in sick.

257
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:30,266
His desk.

258
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,066
He tell you anything up there?

259
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:36,350
We need to know more
about this current operation.

260
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,912
Told you as much as I can.

261
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:39,247
Don't suppose I can

262
00:13:39,287 --> 00:13:41,023
copy the contents of his hard drive?

263
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:43,667
You want answers.

264
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:49,253
Personal effects.

265
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:50,946
Best I can do.

266
00:13:55,872 --> 00:13:56,875
This his wife?

267
00:13:58,262 --> 00:13:59,265
You met her?

268
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:00,858
Married about a year.

269
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,712
Separated

270
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:03,867
last week.

271
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:06,178
Didn't know.

272
00:14:06,216 --> 00:14:08,268
Any change in Arnett's behavior lately?

273
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,543
He was always quiet.

274
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,228
Maybe more so recently.

275
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,487
He did his job.

276
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,509
Never shared anything personal.

277
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:19,745
Phenelzine.

278
00:14:20,697 --> 00:14:22,086
Strong antidepressant.

279
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:24,208
Did you know he was taking medication?

280
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,033
That all we get?

281
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:29,547
I'll go through his files.

282
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,358
See what I can give you.

283
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:40,653
Keep me in the loop,

284
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:42,235
Special Agent Gibbs.

285
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:53,231
Okay.

286
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:55,439
We'll be right there.
Thank you.

287
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:58,289
I can't believe Abby would think
of leaving without saying anything.

288
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,501
Get over it, Tony.

289
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,685
I mean, I understand
her not telling you, but me?

290
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:03,702
I mean I've known her
for a long time, you know.

291
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:05,055
Arnett's wife is here.

292
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:07,253
I am having her brought over
to the conference room.

293
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,036
Boss,
I got an address for Dr. Neil Fleming.

294
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:25,185
Prescribed Arnett the medication.

295
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:27,841
He's not military.
Has a private practice in Georgetown.

296
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,673
Guy gets free medical
care from the Navy,

297
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:32,348
goes to a shrink
who probably charges $350 an hour.

298
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,764
I'll check him out.

299
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:34,845
With him, DiNozzo.

300
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:35,880
With him, boss.

301
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:37,874
<i>Our marriage was doomed from the start.</i>

302
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:40,990
The Navy took advantage
of Michael's language skills.

303
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:43,023
They assigned, reassigned him

304
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,797
to dangerous posts in the Middle East.

305
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:46,717
The few times he was home,

306
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:48,357
he was uptight.

307
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,565
He wouldn't want to talk
about what he did.

308
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:53,472
I became more and more frustrated.

309
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,203
Did you discuss it with him?

310
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:57,729
We tried marriage counseling.

311
00:15:58,794 --> 00:15:59,797
It didn't help.

312
00:16:00,123 --> 00:16:01,357
Michael couldn't open up.

313
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,203
Did you know he was seeing
a psychiatrist?

314
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,421
No.

315
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:08,299
I...

316
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:11,508
I wanted him to get help...

317
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:14,268
I didn't think he would.

318
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:17,309
It was your idea to separate?

319
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:20,136
I thought it would force
him to face our problems.

320
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:22,935
It was a mistake.

321
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:26,918
Where did you meet?

322
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,714
The National Gallery.

323
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,394
An exhibit of Mesopotamian art.
I was...

324
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:35,165
standing, admiring a sculpture, and

325
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:36,854
Michael was behind me.

326
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:39,471
He began explaining the piece to me.

327
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:41,991
He brought it to life.

328
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:45,458
He was the most intelligent
man I'd ever met.

329
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,396
He made me laugh.

330
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,878
I haven't seen him laugh in a long time.

331
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:56,741
You're not surprised he was suicidal.

332
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,260
What does surprise
me is that he was murdered.

333
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:04,444
Why, Agent Gibbs?

334
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:07,675
Why?

335
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:21,759
Don't do that.

336
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:22,872
Do what?

337
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,298
The doctor might be in with a patient,
Tony.

338
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,219
That tells him someone's here?

339
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,410
You ever been to a therapist before?

340
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:33,919
Me? No.

341
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,311
You?

342
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:40,771
Yeah,

343
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:42,179
once, when I was young.

344
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:43,671
For your acrophobia?

345
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:45,831
You're blowing that all
out of proportion, Tony.

346
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:46,642
Well,

347
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:49,714
you showed a pathological
fear of heights earlier today.

348
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,684
I was staring down ten stories.

349
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:54,265
Getting a little disoriented,
it's a little understandable.

350
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:55,415
Disoriented?

351
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,971
You had your panties in a twist.
Tears in your eyes.

352
00:17:58,022 --> 00:18:00,742
Wait. I couldn't see your eyes 'cause
they were shut so tight.

353
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:02,836
You were hysterical like a little girl.

354
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:03,884
I was not.

355
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:05,234
You were hugging the ladder.

356
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:06,426
Ladder-hugger.

357
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:09,488
And I got the photographic evidence.

358
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,699
Let technology show you the truth.

359
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,812
My eyes are not closed.

360
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:15,981
I was blinking.

361
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,350
Is that...
is that what you're doing?

362
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,475
Let's let the people decide.

363
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:23,269
You are not gonna post that on YouTube.

364
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:24,795
I might.

365
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:26,516
You, give me that thing or I'm gonna...

366
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:28,478
What are you gonna do? Yeah!

367
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:30,984
- Slap you silly!
- You're not getting it.

368
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:36,904
You two have deeper issues
than you discussed on the phone.

369
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:38,843
On the phone?

370
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:41,587
Aren't you the couple who called
up about marriage counseling?

371
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,033
Couple?

372
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:44,075
Us? No, no.

373
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:46,785
It's okay, Timmy.
Timmy, we're in a safe place.

374
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:48,369
We can be ourselves here.

375
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:50,553
We just got back from Vermont.

376
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,884
Pretty this time of year.

377
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,833
Sorry.

378
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:56,041
NCIS.

379
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:57,737
Special Agents McGee,

380
00:18:57,874 --> 00:18:58,926
DiNozzo.

381
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:00,947
Very special agents.

382
00:19:05,031 --> 00:19:06,626
I've been seeing patients all day.

383
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:09,580
I didn't hear about Michael.

384
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,132
Why was he seeking your help?

385
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:14,472
I can't discuss that.

386
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:16,470
Doctor, we're investigating his murder.

387
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:19,830
His job at the Pentagon
makes it a matter of national security.

388
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,276
Well, I'm bound by ethics

389
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:23,644
and HIPAA laws.

390
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,013
That ended with his death.

391
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,044
Not for me.

392
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:29,426
Well, can you at least explain
to us why a Naval officer,

393
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:32,452
with free medical care,
would come to a civilian doctor?

394
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:35,678
I have several patients in the military
whose psychological problems,

395
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,685
if known,
would jeopardize their careers.

396
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:39,691
I can tell you this.

397
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:42,580
The last time I saw Michael Arnett,
he was depressed...

398
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:43,855
not suicidal.

399
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,782
Now, without a court order,

400
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:47,230
that's all I'm saying.

401
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:08,649
I heard that, DiNozzo.

402
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:10,769
Another wise-ass
comment like that I'll smack

403
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:12,948
you so hard your grand children
will feel it.

404
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,388
Think it's funny, McGee?

405
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:16,284
Wipe that smile off your face.

406
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:18,110
That goes for you, too, David.

407
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,543
Special Agent Gibbs.

408
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:30,854
You're standing behind me, aren't you?

409
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:32,092
Yup.

410
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:37,415
Feeling real secure about your job,
are you, Abs?

411
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:40,992
Not so much anymore.

412
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:48,675
You up here cause you got
something for me, Abs?

413
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:50,318
Yup.

414
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,483
Ballistics on the bullet?

415
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:55,268
It's a mangled, useless chunk of lead.

416
00:20:55,313 --> 00:20:57,702
Well, actually, only the core
is lead because the jacket

417
00:20:57,741 --> 00:21:01,001
is 95% copper and 5% zinc,
but you already knew that.

418
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:03,660
Arnett's computer?

419
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:05,880
Scrubbed clean
like the day it was born in Taiwan.

420
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:15,906
Lieutenant Arnett's cell phone.

421
00:21:16,022 --> 00:21:18,183
It was in his pocket when he fell, so

422
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:19,958
it's as squished as he is,

423
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:23,128
but I removed the CPU
and I stripped away the peripheral...

424
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:27,904
You're not gonna like who he received
his last call from, Gibbs.

425
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,011
Who?

426
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,877
Us.

427
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:35,495
NCIS.

428
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,655
Someone called Lieutenant Arnett
from inside this building.

429
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:52,969
Director Shepard.

430
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:55,116
I appreciate you getting here so fast.

431
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:56,185
No problem.

432
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:00,486
Is something wrong, Nikki?

433
00:22:01,383 --> 00:22:02,425
May I be frank?

434
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:03,697
Of course.

435
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:07,734
I know I'm only a low-level NCIS
Intel Analyst.

436
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:09,857
And I am more than happy to do

437
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,941
whatever the Agency requires of me,

438
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:13,300
but I resent

439
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:16,658
having a rude message left on my phone
by Special Agent Gibbs.

440
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:21,022
With no explanation at all, in the most
condescending and insulting manner,

441
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,076
he demanded
that I get in here immediately.

442
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:25,076
He certainly lives up to his reputation.

443
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,663
Special Agent Gibbs isn't known
for his people skills.

444
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:30,744
I'm sorry, Director Shepard, I just...

445
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:32,253
needed to vent.

446
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,623
What's this about?

447
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:34,973
You don't know?

448
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,012
I have no idea.

449
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:47,197
What about the murder
of Lieutenant Michael Arnett?

450
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:49,254
He's dead?

451
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:51,687
I just called him this morning.

452
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,719
That's why you're here.

453
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,915
Half of Washington watched him
get shot on live television.

454
00:22:57,212 --> 00:22:58,602
NCIS was on scene.

455
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,080
You work in this building
and had you "no idea"?

456
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:03,199
When did it happen?

457
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:05,103
A little before 1:00 this afternoon.

458
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:06,378
I was home...

459
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:07,412
asleep.

460
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:10,177
I've been working the Middle East desk
for the past couple days.

461
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:12,676
Everyone I had to speak
to is eight hours ahead of us.

462
00:23:12,722 --> 00:23:13,862
I was here all night.

463
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,923
Working on what?

464
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:20,126
Navy counterterrorism intel has

465
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,470
suffered leaks over the last few months.

466
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:25,799
Al-Qaeda has managed
to get a step ahead of us.

467
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,061
We suspect a mole.

468
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,992
Nikki has been analyzing data trying
to look for a common denominator.

469
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,508
I had no idea

470
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:35,225
it involved Lieutenant Arnett.

471
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,779
What's his connection?

472
00:23:37,587 --> 00:23:40,460
Well, Lieutenant Arnett had gone
outside the wire,

473
00:23:40,557 --> 00:23:42,352
working contacts in Djibouti,

474
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:43,958
gathering valuable intel,

475
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:46,141
some of which had been compromised.

476
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:49,370
I wanted to talk to him about
who he shared the information with.

477
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:50,627
Yeah, he cooperate?

478
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:53,602
When I called him,
he seemed preoccupied.

479
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,872
He said he couldn't talk.
He'd get back to me.

480
00:23:57,899 --> 00:23:59,751
Guess that's not going to happen.

481
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:01,838
This is a priority.

482
00:24:02,212 --> 00:24:04,274
Until we find out why he was killed,

483
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:06,809
you are assigned
to Special Agent Gibbs' team.

484
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:12,390
Report to the squad room at 07:30.

485
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:25,627
It's a start-up bioengineering firm.

486
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:27,023
$200,000 a year,

487
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,465
stock options

488
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,780
and a car.

489
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:31,252
A car.

490
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:33,538
What kind of car would Abby lease?

491
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:36,074
- Another hearse?
- Guys, this is Nikki Jardine.

492
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:38,636
She's an intel analyst
who had contact with Arnett.

493
00:24:38,885 --> 00:24:40,423
She's going to be working with us.

494
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,102
Yes, I am still on hold.

495
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:43,501
Hi.

496
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:45,531
I'm Ziva David.
I've seen you around.

497
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:48,822
I'm sorry. I don't shake hands.

498
00:24:51,564 --> 00:24:53,103
I guess a hug's out of the question.

499
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:54,335
Anthony DiNozzo.

500
00:24:57,815 --> 00:24:58,978
Behave yourself, Tony.

501
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,631
McGee?

502
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,721
Boss, can't find a judge
to sign the warrant.

503
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:05,388
No one wants to violate
the patient-client privilege.

504
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,696
I know we started off
on the wrong foot

505
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:09,794
- last night, and I just...
- You've got something?

506
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:13,228
I spoke with a cryptanalyst
at the Pentagon.

507
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,140
Lieutenant Arnett returned
from the Middle East two weeks ago.

508
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:19,337
He passed through the NCIS field office
in Djibouti. With your permission,

509
00:25:19,372 --> 00:25:21,581
I'd like to contact the special agent
in charge there.

510
00:25:21,677 --> 00:25:22,677
Do it.

511
00:25:23,908 --> 00:25:25,564
Where are you going, Jardine?

512
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,144
To my office to make the call.

513
00:25:31,886 --> 00:25:34,215
We have backgrounded
Lieutenant Arnett's family.

514
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,836
Arnett's grandparents lived
the American dream, boss.

515
00:25:37,088 --> 00:25:38,638
Came to this country as teenagers.

516
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:41,002
Opened a small appliance shop
in the '60s.

517
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,139
Which evolved into a chain
of electronics stores.

518
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:46,612
19, to be exact.

519
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:50,898
Grossing over $250 million last year.

520
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:52,765
We're talking big family money.

521
00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:54,585
If there's a prenup,
the soon-to-be ex-wife

522
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:56,073
stands to lose a fortune.

523
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:59,130
Think <i>Black Widow</i>,
Theresa Russell film of the same name.

524
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,013
All right, Tony. Dana Arnett,

525
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:04,138
travel agent, is a crack shot
with a sniper rifle?

526
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:05,599
Could've hired a hit man.

527
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,750
Get her in here again.

528
00:26:10,623 --> 00:26:11,986
I'm sorry.
I have allergies.

529
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:19,310
I could never wear contact lenses.

530
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,941
Just the thought of sticking
my finger in me eye...

531
00:26:23,188 --> 00:26:26,440
It conforms with Lieutenant Arnett's
medical records.

532
00:26:26,707 --> 00:26:28,668
Near-sighted, 20/80 vision

533
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:30,583
with an astigmatism.

534
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:32,733
- Here are the blood samples.
- Thanks, Jimster.

535
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,856
Expect to find Phenelzine
when you run the tox screen.

536
00:26:36,183 --> 00:26:36,983
Roger.

537
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,492
- What?
- What?

538
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:44,791
Am I unbuttoned or ripped?

539
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,145
Are my ponytails crooked?

540
00:26:46,468 --> 00:26:48,464
Why is everyone staring at me today?

541
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:49,707
I wasn't staring.

542
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,173
- I wasn't staring.
- You were staring, Mr. Palmer.

543
00:26:56,502 --> 00:26:58,075
You hear about Abby's new job?

544
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,251
Worst-kept secret at NCIS.

545
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,049
I was told she was promised
a state-of-the-art lab,

546
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:04,989
two assistants and...

547
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:06,974
her own Caf-Pow machine.

548
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:12,094
I spoke with Agent Wells in Djibouti.

549
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:15,170
She said Lieutenant Arnett stopped
by the NCIS field office

550
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:16,310
a couple of weeks ago.

551
00:27:17,481 --> 00:27:18,481
He was upset.

552
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:21,694
He was concerned
that his key local witness was missing.

553
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:23,640
They offered to help locate him, but

554
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:25,672
Arnett was so protective of his sources.

555
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,694
He wouldn't reveal
the contact's identity.

556
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:28,878
That's all?

557
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,580
Yes.

558
00:27:35,838 --> 00:27:37,541
Pentagon just sent Arnett's files.

559
00:27:42,306 --> 00:27:44,100
Is he always this...

560
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:45,911
Impatient?

561
00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:49,466
It's not exactly the word
I was looking for.

562
00:27:51,051 --> 00:27:52,787
You are not denying she's pretty.

563
00:27:53,343 --> 00:27:55,803
- Bizarre trumps pretty.
- But you would...

564
00:27:56,905 --> 00:27:59,364
- How? In a hazmat suit?
- You two would make a good couple.

565
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:01,365
- You have something in common.
- What?

566
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:02,219
Fear.

567
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,709
She's afraid of germs.
You're afraid of commitment.

568
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,176
And you're both afraid of Gibbs.

569
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,938
For the record, Ms. David,

570
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:10,734
I'm not afraid of Gibbs.

571
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,367
Thank you for coming back in,
Mrs. Arnett.

572
00:28:14,804 --> 00:28:15,804
You have news?

573
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:17,365
Sorry, no.

574
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,319
So why am I here?

575
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,567
This will not take long.
We just need to clarify something.

576
00:28:24,098 --> 00:28:26,232
The circumstances under
which you got married.

577
00:28:27,544 --> 00:28:28,624
What does that mean?

578
00:28:28,682 --> 00:28:30,592
Your husband's family is worth
a lot of money.

579
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,327
You didn't by any chance sign a prenup,
did you?

580
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:38,817
My husband attempted to take
his own life and then was murdered.

581
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,649
He hasn't even been dead 48 hours
and you have the nerve

582
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:44,679
to stand here and ask me
how much money I may or may not get?

583
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:47,527
Michael's parents are arriving and...

584
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,685
I have a funeral to arrange.

585
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:55,016
Do I need someone to escort me
out of the building?

586
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:57,394
I will escort you, Mrs. Arnett.

587
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,113
Nice, Tony.

588
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:04,346
"Black Widow".

589
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,545
Guilty.

590
00:29:05,546 --> 00:29:07,668
When there's money involved,
it's always the spouse.

591
00:29:14,094 --> 00:29:15,109
Roll call.

592
00:29:15,244 --> 00:29:17,828
Phenelzine is present and accounted for,
as predicted,

593
00:29:17,904 --> 00:29:20,354
but Timolol made a surprise appearance.

594
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:21,591
Timolol?

595
00:29:21,624 --> 00:29:23,142
A very high concentration.

596
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:25,347
- Timolol?
- It's a beta-blocker.

597
00:29:25,405 --> 00:29:27,862
Eye drops.
Used to treat glaucoma.

598
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:31,907
Which, according to his medical records,
Lieutenant Arnett never had.

599
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:34,026
Mr. Palmer,

600
00:29:34,508 --> 00:29:36,553
have the lieutenant report
back to the table.

601
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
Yes, sir.

602
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:42,947
<i>Boss,</i>

603
00:29:43,189 --> 00:29:44,539
I vetted Dr. Fleming.

604
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:51,330
Turns out he was a radical undergraduate
at Berkeley in the early '70s.

605
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:54,078
Arrested several times
for civil disobedience.

606
00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:57,692
As recently as last week, spoke
at a Get-Out-of-Gitmo rally on the Mall.

607
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:01,208
Well, bring him in. We don't need
a subpoena to interview him.

608
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,916
Captain Walsh is online in MTAC.

609
00:30:04,657 --> 00:30:05,911
Arnett's files.

610
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:08,205
Redacted to the point it's useless.

611
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:10,753
Special Agent Gibbs,
I've got something.

612
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:13,033
Yes, sir.

613
00:30:15,142 --> 00:30:16,298
Captain Walsh,

614
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:17,958
sorry to keep you waiting.

615
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:19,667
<i>My unit's still on lockdown.</i>

616
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:21,867
<i>You were supposed to keep me
in the loop, Agent Gibbs.</i>

617
00:30:21,868 --> 00:30:23,218
Lieutenant Arnett's file...

618
00:30:23,397 --> 00:30:25,363
I could've got more
reading The Washington Post.

619
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,261
<i>Blame the Director
of National Intelligence.</i>

620
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:31,057
And you forgot to mention Arnett
was questioned about leaked intel.

621
00:30:31,606 --> 00:30:34,673
<i>Didn't think I needed to. Don't you
people at NCIS talk to each other?</i>

622
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:36,541
Captain Walsh,

623
00:30:37,094 --> 00:30:40,470
in order for this agency to complete
a thorough investigation,

624
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,419
we will need your full cooperation.

625
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,753
You'll be briefed
when we think it's appropriate.

626
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:47,653
<i>I have a meeting with the Undersecretary
in half an hour.</i>

627
00:30:47,654 --> 00:30:48,713
<i>What do I tell him?</i>

628
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:51,190
Tell him the Director
of National Intelligence is

629
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:52,959
obstructing our investigation.

630
00:30:56,382 --> 00:30:57,894
Djibouti's coming online.

631
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,738
Satellite time's expensive.

632
00:31:02,646 --> 00:31:04,832
What do you have for us,
Special Agent Wells?

633
00:31:04,942 --> 00:31:06,456
<i>We've been working with Bahrain.</i>

634
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:08,129
<i>I think we've come up with something.</i>

635
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:11,645
<i>A tribal leader was beheaded for
collaborating with an American agent.</i>

636
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:14,193
<i>It's definitely the work
of Al-Qaeda operatives.</i>

637
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:15,843
<i>We have every reason to believe</i>

638
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:18,931
<i>the victim was
Lieutenant Arnett's missing contact.</i>

639
00:31:19,122 --> 00:31:20,181
When did it happen?

640
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:21,953
<i>A couple days ago, not too much longer.</i>

641
00:31:21,992 --> 00:31:24,123
<i>We're just getting into it
questioning villagers.</i>

642
00:31:24,436 --> 00:31:26,013
I want updates as you get them.

643
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:26,863
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

644
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:30,128
What've you got, Jardine?

645
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,343
I did a matrix.

646
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:33,485
Focused on the four most recent leaks.

647
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,011
Charted who generated the information,
received it,

648
00:31:36,012 --> 00:31:38,120
or had access to it,
directly or indirectly.

649
00:31:38,218 --> 00:31:39,818
The only person who had knowledge

650
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:42,733
of all the leaked intel
was Lieutenant Arnett himself.

651
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:45,654
If the beheaded tribal leader
was in fact his source

652
00:31:45,827 --> 00:31:47,466
and his identity has been leaked,

653
00:31:47,564 --> 00:31:49,571
then Arnett is the only one
who would have known.

654
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:52,508
I think Lieutenant Arnett was the mole.

655
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:01,199
Mid-Eastern ancestry.

656
00:32:01,392 --> 00:32:02,435
Arab-speaking.

657
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,112
Naval Academy graduate.

658
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,908
Intelligence officer in the Pentagon.

659
00:32:06,114 --> 00:32:08,294
He is the perfect deep cover mole.

660
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:11,244
Sort of an Arab version of Kevin Costner
in <i>No Way Out.</i>

661
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:14,355
A movie buff.
One more thing you two have in common.

662
00:32:14,404 --> 00:32:16,025
Arnett's juggling two lives.

663
00:32:16,063 --> 00:32:18,401
Things are closing in on him.
He's stressed to the max.

664
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:21,619
On antidepressants, a liability
to his Al-Qaeda handlers.

665
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:23,020
When he doesn't jump,

666
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:25,914
they terminate him
before he can expose their cell.

667
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,283
Nah, I still like the...

668
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:29,305
wife. Had him killed for the money.

669
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:30,355
There's a prenup.

670
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:32,686
He dies before they get divorced,
she gets the big check.

671
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,258
If he died after, she gets zip.

672
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:36,226
Yeah, why the suicide attempt, DiNozzo?

673
00:32:37,318 --> 00:32:38,899
I'm still working on that part, boss.

674
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,347
We know why he was suicidal.

675
00:32:40,468 --> 00:32:43,559
Abby found Timolol
in Lieutenant Arnett's blood.

676
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:45,746
It's used to treat glaucoma.

677
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:47,480
He didn't have glaucoma.

678
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:49,970
- So why'd he take it?
- Well, that's the best part.

679
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:51,391
He didn't know he was.

680
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:55,375
Someone substituted Timolol
for his contact lens solution.

681
00:32:55,588 --> 00:32:57,281
His lenses were soaking in it all night.

682
00:32:57,374 --> 00:33:00,345
It's the equivalent of wearing
nicotine patches on his eyes.

683
00:33:00,635 --> 00:33:04,243
The level of the drug was 20 times
the recommended dosage.

684
00:33:04,364 --> 00:33:06,099
I still haven't heard
why he was suicidal.

685
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,009
Because the combination
of the eye medication

686
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:12,880
and the antidepressant he was taking
has a serious side effect:

687
00:33:12,984 --> 00:33:14,951
severe clinical depression.

688
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,647
Well, I think you're overlooking
an obvious character.

689
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,030
Character?

690
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,794
This isn't one of your novels,
Mr. Gemcity.

691
00:33:23,406 --> 00:33:24,486
Dr. Fleming

692
00:33:24,892 --> 00:33:26,338
has anti-government leanings.

693
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:28,083
He prescribed the antidepressant

694
00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:30,082
and would know the combined drugs
side effects.

695
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,857
If Arnett discussed
classified information

696
00:33:31,896 --> 00:33:34,597
during their sessions,
Fleming could have passed the intel on.

697
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:36,306
There's your spy.

698
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:38,439
Yes, probie,

699
00:33:38,523 --> 00:33:40,626
but the wife had access
to the contact lenses.

700
00:33:40,664 --> 00:33:41,899
That does not prove anything.

701
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,302
McGee found a bottle of lens solution
in Arnett's Pentagon office desk.

702
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:48,678
- Your point?
- Captain Walsh had access to his desk,

703
00:33:48,716 --> 00:33:51,367
and, as Arnett's CO,
knowledge of his intel.

704
00:33:51,592 --> 00:33:54,650
- That's the weakest point of all.
- All these make more sense than Arnett.

705
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:57,567
Listen, I think I'm not missing
the point. I think...

706
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:03,226
Break up the dog pile.
This is a murder investigation.

707
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:06,218
And I am hearing a lot of theories here
and not much else.

708
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:07,569
Get on it!

709
00:34:13,882 --> 00:34:16,082
So, I'm against the war
and the Patriot Act.

710
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:17,887
Doesn't make me un-American.

711
00:34:21,868 --> 00:34:23,083
What have you got there?

712
00:34:23,754 --> 00:34:25,354
Government keeping a file on me?

713
00:34:25,568 --> 00:34:27,368
I'll ask the questions, Dr. Fleming.

714
00:34:30,382 --> 00:34:31,582
I've had enough of this.

715
00:34:32,257 --> 00:34:33,257
Sit down!

716
00:34:37,032 --> 00:34:39,212
I see McGee's got your mad act down.

717
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:40,819
Almost.

718
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,784
I heard your agents are pitted
against each other.

719
00:34:45,055 --> 00:34:48,392
Wasn't that Gibbs' rule #15:
"Always work as a team"?

720
00:34:49,322 --> 00:34:50,322
Not on this one.

721
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:57,464
No one could have saved him, Jethro.

722
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:02,186
He was dead the moment
he stepped out on that ledge.

723
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:05,984
That what I tell his sister?

724
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,310
You have any luck?

725
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,576
Might be something.

726
00:35:14,815 --> 00:35:16,897
The summer before his junior year
in high school,

727
00:35:16,963 --> 00:35:19,201
he spent two months in Damascus
with relatives.

728
00:35:19,913 --> 00:35:21,849
I'm trying to ascertain their politics.

729
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,282
- Entrapped the "Black Widow" yet?
- Minor setback.

730
00:35:25,511 --> 00:35:27,883
I thought since Dana Arnett
was married to a guy

731
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,315
with top-secret clearance,
she would have been vetted.

732
00:35:30,574 --> 00:35:31,574
Let me guess.

733
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,739
She's squeaky clean.

734
00:35:32,886 --> 00:35:35,073
Well, I don't know
because she was never checked out.

735
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:36,796
If he'd married some foreigner, then,

736
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:40,010
obviously, she would have been subjected
to a vigorous background check,

737
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:42,009
but she was born in Kansas.

738
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,635
I am having the same problem
McGee had with Captain Walsh.

739
00:35:44,636 --> 00:35:46,632
The Pentagon is rock-walling me.

740
00:35:47,383 --> 00:35:48,618
She means stonewalling.

741
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:50,104
Little quirk she has.

742
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:52,944
I guess everyone has
their little quirks,

743
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,175
 even me.

744
00:35:55,562 --> 00:35:56,551
Really?

745
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:57,835
I hadn't noticed.

746
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:06,927
Abby, please. All I'm asking
is for you to take another look

747
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:08,671
at the hard drive on Arnett's computer.

748
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:09,833
It's wiped clean.

749
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,396
Maybe you can find an embedded file,
anything.

750
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:14,587
I can't, okay?
I am too busy.

751
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:17,031
Why don't you ask McGee to do it?
Because Mr. MIT

752
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,997
claims that he's better at this stuff
anyways.

753
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,150
May I take a couple of these?

754
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,710
Sure, knock yourself out.

755
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,272
- Abs?
- McGee, I need your help.

756
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:35,450
I got Dr. Fleming's fingerprints
on this water bottle.

757
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:37,962
I need you to compare it to the prints
lifted in Arnett's flat.

758
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:40,058
Take a number,
because Tony has me running DNA

759
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:42,284
off this toothbrush
with an entire database of felons.

760
00:36:42,312 --> 00:36:44,357
- It'll only take a minute.
- I asked first.

761
00:36:45,118 --> 00:36:46,727
- I did. I've got seniority.
- Yes...

762
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:48,499
Back off!

763
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,493
All of you, okay?
I am one person!

764
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:53,096
- Easy, Abs.
- No! It's late.

765
00:36:53,097 --> 00:36:55,761
I am tired, I am overworked,
and I am taken for granted!

766
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:02,475
Maybe you should accept that job offer.

767
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:13,743
I can't believe you'd say that to me,
Gibbs.

768
00:37:14,346 --> 00:37:16,150
How could you think
that I would be leaving?

769
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:17,696
'Cause I got a little mad?

770
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:19,148
So what?

771
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:21,157
We're family. That's allowed.

772
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:23,599
I get three or four job offers
every year.

773
00:37:23,811 --> 00:37:25,354
I've never considered any of them.

774
00:37:25,987 --> 00:37:27,949
Then why'd you have dinner
with that headhunter?

775
00:37:29,523 --> 00:37:32,505
Have you ever had the Beluga caviar
at the Ritz-Carlton?

776
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:35,108
And besides,

777
00:37:35,323 --> 00:37:36,759
it was nice to feel wanted.

778
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:39,320
Now, get out of here, all of you.
I have work to do.

779
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,247
- What was that for?
- Spreading rumors.

780
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:47,216
- Thank you, boss.
- DiNozzo!

781
00:37:47,803 --> 00:37:48,896
Get back in here!

782
00:37:49,942 --> 00:37:51,293
Anyone wanna come with me?

783
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:56,157
I am meeting Captain Walsh's
former executive officer

784
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:58,691
at the Naval Amphibious Base
at Little Creek tomorrow.

785
00:37:58,895 --> 00:38:01,789
He is willing to talk to us,
off the record, but not here.

786
00:38:01,927 --> 00:38:03,432
You losers might want to follow me.

787
00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:04,647
Boss, need you in MTAC.

788
00:38:04,697 --> 00:38:07,012
Clearly, you're not one of the losers.
My hunch paid off.

789
00:38:07,013 --> 00:38:08,958
Figured the "Black Widow"
has a felony record.

790
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,638
Abby just got a DNA match from Interpol.

791
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:13,914
<i>Her real name is Najida Mamud,</i>

792
00:38:14,203 --> 00:38:16,210
<i>an agent of the Syrian Mukhabarat.</i>

793
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:18,877
<i>She's a gifted linguist,
she was educated in England,</i>

794
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:22,788
<i>and secretly trained in weaponry,
martial arts and covert operations.</i>

795
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:24,081
Ziva, she's you.

796
00:38:24,645 --> 00:38:27,506
<i>Najida Mamud was in
an Al-Qaeda camp in Sudan</i>

797
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:30,095
<i>until we lost track of her
three years ago.<i>

798
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,945
<i>We thought she was in Pakistan.</i>

799
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:33,769
She was obviously smuggled into the US

800
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:36,759
and then deep-backstopped
with impeccable American ID.

801
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,595
- Homeland Security's worst fear.
- <i>And ours.</i>

802
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:41,582
<i>Let me know if you apprehend her.</i>

803
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:45,914
Lieutenant Arnett didn't casually
meet his wife at a museum.

804
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:47,188
She set him up,

805
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,831
just like Kathleen Turner set up
William Hurt in <i>Body Heat.</i>

806
00:38:49,832 --> 00:38:51,568
Lieutenant Arnett wasn't the mole.

807
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:53,307
He was married to the mole.

808
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,401
How did she know he was going
to jump off a building?

809
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:59,241
Didn't. She was drugging him,
building a case for his depression.

810
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,402
So when she killed him...
overdose, slit his wrists,

811
00:39:01,403 --> 00:39:03,024
whatever, it would appear to be suicide.

812
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:05,104
He must have realized
he was the source of the leak

813
00:39:05,105 --> 00:39:07,434
- that got his operative killed.
- Reason enough to jump?

814
00:39:07,865 --> 00:39:09,742
Guess when we got involved,
she had no choice.

815
00:39:09,743 --> 00:39:12,969
Had to take him out. I'm gonna put out
a BOLO, notify Homeland Security.

816
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:14,744
I will call the hotel,
see if she's there.

817
00:39:14,782 --> 00:39:16,089
I'm getting the car, boss.

818
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:17,458
What can I do?

819
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:19,453
Assignment's over.

820
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:31,669
You can get me that phone number.

821
00:39:37,806 --> 00:39:40,680
Dana Arnett notified the front desk
that she is checking out.

822
00:39:45,394 --> 00:39:47,312
She left the lobby less
than a minute ago.

823
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:50,042
DiNozzo, McGee, start at the top,
work your way down.

824
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:13,529
Federal agents.

825
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,279
Keep moving.

826
00:40:29,873 --> 00:40:30,673
Boss!

827
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,127
Pull the fire alarm!

828
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:34,734
McGee, level seven.

829
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,330
Probie!

830
00:40:55,217 --> 00:40:56,760
This is not how I want it to end!

831
00:40:56,856 --> 00:40:58,438
Hang on, Tony.
I'm coming.

832
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,496
Give me an excuse.

833
00:41:28,393 --> 00:41:29,551
It's about time!

834
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,524
Come on.

835
00:41:41,381 --> 00:41:42,577
I love you, McGee.

836
00:41:45,317 --> 00:41:48,057
I promise never to give you
a hard time again.

837
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:49,776
Yeah, right.

838
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:57,031
Where's Gibbs?

839
00:41:57,589 --> 00:41:58,785
I don't know.

840
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,063
Is that what you get for turning down
the job offer?

841
00:42:01,525 --> 00:42:03,551
No. For solving the case.

842
00:42:04,218 --> 00:42:06,996
I believe those are for me,
then, because I solved the case.

843
00:42:08,024 --> 00:42:11,516
But Abby ran the photo-recognition
that ID'd Lieutenant Arnett.

844
00:42:11,651 --> 00:42:13,459
I risked my life hanging off a wall.

845
00:42:13,571 --> 00:42:17,102
She discovered the drug interaction
that made Arnett suicidal.

846
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:19,231
I suggested we run the wife's DNA.

847
00:42:19,343 --> 00:42:21,931
Against a national database of felons.

848
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,984
Dead end. Abby went the extra step and
compared it to the Interpol database.

849
00:42:26,071 --> 00:42:27,190
I don't believe this.

850
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:28,775
He still loves me.

851
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:30,969
Give it up, Tony.

852
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:32,723
She will always be the favorite, Tony.

853
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:38,910
I still love you.

854
00:42:42,857 --> 00:42:43,857
Back to work.

855
00:42:48,596 --> 00:42:49,596
Agent Gibbs?

856
00:42:50,748 --> 00:42:52,098
That phone number you wanted.

857
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:00,879
That's good work, Jardine.
Good night.

858
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:18,829
<i>Hello?</i>

859
00:43:19,476 --> 00:43:20,846
Hello. Rachel?

860
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:22,718
<i>Yes, this is Rachel.</i>

861
00:43:24,532 --> 00:43:25,532
We haven't met...

862
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,269
but I knew your brother.
