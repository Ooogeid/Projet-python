2
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:21,235
Hello?

3
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:28,612
Hello?

4
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:38,320
Alice, it's just me.

5
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:40,825
That's the third time
you've done that to me this year.

6
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:43,345
- You know I don't like surprises.
- Yeah, well...

7
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:47,174
Surprise.
It's our one-month anniversary.

8
00:00:48,498 --> 00:00:50,420
I knew there was a reason
I married you.

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,724
- I'll be right back.
- Be right here.

10
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,563
OK.

11
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:03,931
All right.
Little Barry.

12
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:25,905
Alice, what's wrong?

13
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:35,180
NCIS Season 6 Episode 6

Synchro: ¤AkaZab¤

15
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:38,224
Thanks to Bruno!

www.Team-NCIS.com

17
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:06,055
- Run for your life probie, run.
- What are you doing?

18
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:07,586
Just trying to save your life.

19
00:02:07,646 --> 00:02:09,549
- What did you do?
- Why do you assume it's me?

20
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:11,823
That's a good point,
but in this case, actually...

21
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:12,768
Too late.

22
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,344
- Why is she sitting at my...?
- You're on your own, probie.

23
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,642
McGee, get in here!

24
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:18,680
Plead temporary insanity.
It's your best bet.

25
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:20,552
What did I tell you, McGee?

26
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:22,160
About what?

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,627
I told you to destroy those... twice.

28
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:35,864
I did. I did. No. I...

29
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:37,019
I didn't...

30
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,584
- Tony must have...
- What? When you went to get coffee?

31
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:42,821
You did not erase those photos,
did you?

32
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:46,399
Admit it,
and I will spare you one...

33
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:49,778
- of your eyes.
- I did not erase those photos.

34
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:53,120
I think I know what happened.
I...

35
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,627
I just deleted my old screen saver,

36
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,053
and theoretically,
the operating system could

37
00:02:58,113 --> 00:03:00,811
have defaulted to the photo directory,
but, you know, the odds...

38
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:02,280
Today is not your lucky day.

39
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,102
It is Halloween later this week.

40
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:06,082
And I did see a black cat this morning.

41
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,842
Well, it was...
it was dark brown.

42
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:10,153
Give me your hand.

43
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:13,561
Better than losing an eye, McGee.
Let's go.

44
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,072
- What do we got, boss?
- What do we got?

45
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:17,284
We got a...

46
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:19,908
It's a good question, DiNozzo.

47
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,992
"My mother isn't quite herself today."

48
00:03:30,382 --> 00:03:33,067
- <i>Psycho</i>.
- You certainly have your moments.

49
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:34,703
The movie, Ziva.

50
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:36,921
Norman Bates.
Shower scene.

51
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,385
Looks like their night was ruined.

52
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:42,354
I am going to ruin McGee's whole year.

53
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:45,539
Don't you think you're being
a little uptight about this photo thing?

54
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:47,725
No, really.
What do you think he's doing with it?

55
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,810
I would rather shave
my eyeballs than contemplate that.

56
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:55,174
Blood is human, boss.
Not pure, but,

57
00:03:55,254 --> 00:03:57,328
enough to make Janet Leigh scream.

58
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,460
We thought it prudent to notify Ducky,
given the amount.

59
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:02,735
- Source?
- McGee's still looking for it.

60
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:04,601
"Mother!"

61
00:04:05,448 --> 00:04:07,200
"Blood! Blood!"

62
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:11,263
- Psycho.
- He has his moments.

63
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:16,048
I spoke to the colonel
in charge of base operations.

64
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,790
These outlying homes receive
their water from local aquifers.

65
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:23,222
Water's drawn into holding tanks
and distributed to these smaller nodes.

66
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:25,032
Pumped to the houses as need.

67
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,369
It's a technology as old as the hills.

68
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,447
At Skara Brae in Scotland, as I recall,

69
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:33,899
a Neolithic stone village was uncovered,
complete with plumbing.

70
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:35,765
Here we go.

71
00:04:36,869 --> 00:04:37,936
Dr. Mallard?

72
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:47,831
Sorry.
I'll go get the wrap.

73
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:50,225
- You can drain it.
- Yes, sir.

74
00:04:57,022 --> 00:05:00,206
Some bloating,
to be expected with the submersion.

75
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:03,245
However,
that man has not been in that tank

76
00:05:03,384 --> 00:05:04,891
more than 24 hours.

77
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:07,009
- That your time of death?
- Perhaps.

78
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:10,742
As to the cause,
these lacerations were made postmortem.

79
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:14,736
Note the styrofoam-ish aspect
to the wounds.

80
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:19,472
Blunt-force trauma to the head,
but I doubt that's a fatal blow.

81
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:21,729
I can also rule out drowning.

82
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:25,303
Yes, were that the case,
even with the immersion,

83
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:27,733
there would be conspicuous
amounts of

84
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:31,073
froth on his nose
and mouth.

85
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:34,628
Hello, hello, hello.
What have we here?

86
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:39,070
Mr. Palmer, get his chin.

87
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:41,950
Open wide.

88
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:52,868
The plot thickens.

89
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:55,040
What does that say?

90
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:56,808
A Web site?

91
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:07,426
Primitus-victor.com
is just a placeholder.

92
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,998
The link redirects to a CyberVid video.

93
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,342
Cyber... vid?

94
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:15,245
Anyone can upload anything,
and anyone can watch it.

95
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:17,542
You know, boss, like <i>LonelyGirl15</i>?

96
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:19,604
<i>- Evolution of Dance?
- Numa Numa Guy.</i>

97
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:23,885
Cute.

98
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,056
You got to see this.

99
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:29,197
There he goes.

100
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,434
I love this guy.

101
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:38,700
Sorry.
Back to...

102
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,148
back to our video.

103
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:41,683
We're the first viewers.

104
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,023
What is this?

105
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:50,361
That's our dead guy.

106
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,723
Don't get in the van, man.

107
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:57,335
What was that?

108
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:23,611
ID?

109
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:26,571
No hits on the victim's prints yet.
I'm still running the DNA.

110
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,655
The CyberVid account and redirect links

111
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,840
were opened at an Internet cafe
in Richmond anonymously a month ago.

112
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:33,982
- Someone might remember something.
- Go.

113
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:37,821
- Talk to security at Quantico.
- See who didn't show up for work.

114
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,966
Primitus victor.

115
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:43,460
It's Latin.
It means first victim.

116
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:45,461
Yeah. I know, Abs.

117
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:52,125
This never gets old.

118
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:02,524
Nice timing, Jethro.

119
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:05,723
I thought you'd like to see
what we've found in our scans.

120
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:08,071
Or rather, what we didn't find.

121
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:10,458
His brain is missing!

122
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:13,772
There's no need to get so excited,
Mr. Palmer.

123
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:15,910
Where did it go?

124
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,824
Well, it appears to have
been removed trans-nasally

125
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:22,041
in a manner similar to that used
by the ancient Egyptians

126
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,719
prior to mummification,

127
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,543
most likely using a tool

128
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:29,128
- similar to this.
- A missing brain,

129
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,470
and so close to Halloween.
That's enough to make you want to...

130
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:36,279
... go clean some pipettes.

131
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:38,816
Postmortem?

132
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,786
Well, judging by
the intracranial hemorrhaging,

133
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:44,297
I believe the entire cerebrum
was removed

134
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,304
when he was still alive.

135
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,850
Unconscious, of course,
but alive,

136
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:51,216
until of course, he wasn't.

137
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:53,423
Thanks, Duck.

138
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,100
At which point, he was frozen.

139
00:08:57,744 --> 00:08:58,550
Frozen?

140
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,999
Abby's tissue analysis shows massive

141
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,919
cellular ruptures that indicate
the body was frozen.

142
00:09:04,472 --> 00:09:05,554
So, time of death?

143
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:09,002
Not something that I can determine
with any degree of accuracy.

144
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:11,490
Perhaps, that was the intent.

145
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:13,392
Perhaps not.

146
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,844
There are many parts
to this puzzle, Jethro.

147
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:17,398
It's not a puzzle, Duck.

148
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:18,850
A game?

149
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:22,724
It's one that this poor fellow lost.

150
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,817
Victim's name is Billy Cole.

151
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:27,050
26, native of Virginia.

152
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,661
- Civilian?
- Yeah. Cole worked at a local car wash.

153
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:33,139
Abby got a hit off his DNA.
Two years ago, he donated his sperm.

154
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:37,050
- The things people will do for money.
- You donated your sperm.

155
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,322
Didn't do that for the money.
Just to enrich the world.

156
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,547
So, boss,
I spoke to security at Quantico.

157
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:43,685
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I interrupt?

158
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,414
Let's see who the boss likes better.

159
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:53,772
Security at Quantico insists

160
00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:56,345
no one could have gotten past
their checkpoints with a body.

161
00:09:56,405 --> 00:09:58,000
Might have used one of the rivers, but

162
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:01,176
how do you drag a dead guy
two miles through the water unless...

163
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:02,545
He was frozen.

164
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:05,627
No. I was gonna say, unless you had one
of those James Bond submersible sleds

165
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,360
from <i>Thunderball</i>, but frozen's good.

166
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:09,464
- Float him right in.
- What else you got?

167
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:10,524
Actually...

168
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:16,363
You know, actually,
I don't have anything else.

169
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:20,291
Cole had no criminal record,
and, no one reported him missing.

170
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:22,020
Any connection to the couple on base?

171
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:24,446
They were the first ones
to turn on their water.

172
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:27,130
Well, the killer did leave
a message for whoever found the body.

173
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,354
Click the click.

174
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,577
A cryptic message...

175
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,999
Could be anything.

176
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,025
But we'll figure it out.
We can do better.

177
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,218
McGee, Billy Cole's address.

178
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:44,976
On your six, Boss.

179
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:47,605
Hey, you haven't forgot about
that screen saver, have you, Ziva?

180
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:49,055
Actually, I had.

181
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:52,777
- Thanks for reminding me.
- What are friends for?

182
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,862
Nice place.
Glad I'm up on my tetanus shots.

183
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:02,656
Everything okay, boss?
You seem kind of quiet... er than usual.

184
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:04,883
You're worried this is just the first?

185
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:07,038
Worried it's not.

186
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,285
- Federal agents!
<i>- I... need love</i>

187
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:17,745
<i>Got to get me some love.</i>

188
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,357
<i>I...</i>

189
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,248
We closed the garage door!

190
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,751
Billy disappeared,
I don't know, about a week ago.

191
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:35,946
Owed me a couple months' rent.
Figured he was just skipping out on us.

192
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:37,852
I can't believe he's dead.

193
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,577
Were you and he...?

194
00:11:40,781 --> 00:11:42,495
No. My God, never.

195
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,210
No, just every other guy
in the zip code.

196
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,530
We were just roommates.

197
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,609
That's actually the name of our band,
<i>Just Roommates</i>.

198
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:54,541
Billy was our lead guitarist
until I found a new one.

199
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:56,405
The guy just didn't get it.

200
00:11:56,947 --> 00:11:57,771
"It"?

201
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,978
If you have to ask,
you obviously don't get it, either.

202
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:03,473
Need to see his room.

203
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:05,182
This is his room,

204
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:06,696
Agent...?

205
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,241
That's an interesting name.

206
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,288
So now that he's dead, Agent

207
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:24,332
Interesting Name,
if he has any money anywhere,

208
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:26,991
you know with the rent he owes us,
that would be really...

209
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:28,513
OK...

210
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:32,306
What happened?
Was it a robbery?

211
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,150
Well, that's what we're...
trying to figure, ma'am.

212
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:38,055
Should we make you a list?

213
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:40,331
You know, people he knew,
phone numbers and stuff?

214
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:41,874
I watch a lot of TV.

215
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:43,224
Whatever you got.

216
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,937
Who was the last one to see him?

217
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:49,193
I did.
He said he was going out for a beer.

218
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,870
- Never came back.
- He does that sometimes.

219
00:12:52,123 --> 00:12:54,551
The guy's got no focus, and I told him
when I let him in the band

220
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:56,443
I need a lead that I could count on.

221
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,379
You know, "no amateurs need apply".

222
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,162
Check this out.

223
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,727
You know where this was taken?

224
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:06,787
Yeah.

225
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:08,634
Why?

226
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:13,375
I hate serial killers.

227
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:16,005
Though at least this one
was kind enough

228
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:18,215
to give us
the exact location of the murder.

229
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:21,547
And the murder weapon.

230
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:25,032
You know, these things
always come in threes, boss.

231
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:26,668
He gave us the location,

232
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:28,252
the murder weapon,

233
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:31,170
and the time of death.

234
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,698
He's daring us to find him.

235
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,235
Someone wasn't hugged enough
as a child.

236
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:53,161
I guess Latin for "second victim".

237
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:00,001
What's that?

238
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:31,919
<i>And what anything, anything you want,
Please, let me go.</i>

239
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:32,997
<i>Please.</i>

240
00:14:33,517 --> 00:14:36,075
<i>Please let me go...
Where are you?</i>

241
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:41,487
<i>No, no-no, no, no, no...
No, please...</i>

242
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:04,538
Between Mother Theresa and Hitler,
I guess there's all kinds.

243
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:09,488
How does he know
who was assigned to the case?

244
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,999
- Working on it.
- Director?

245
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,997
We should've seen that coming.

246
00:15:14,057 --> 00:15:16,293
<i>Another murder has been posted
on the popular...</i>

247
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:18,749
Do I need to tell you SecNav
is already breathing down my neck?

248
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:20,316
If it'll make you feel better.

249
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:23,381
SecNav is already breathing down
my neck. Now you know.

250
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:27,068
- I'll handle him, you handle this.
<i>- ... park in rural Virginia.</i>

251
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:28,962
Just watch your back, Gibbs.

252
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:32,108
If the killer's following
the same pattern,

253
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:34,049
then each of these clues
refers to the time,

254
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:36,556
location and cause of
death of the next victim.

255
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,062
Wes Craven he's not.

256
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,468
<i>Nightmare on Elm Street.</i>

257
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:42,549
<i>Scream.
Swamp Thing.</i>

258
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,923
Plenty scary to me.
I had nightmares all night.

259
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:46,568
That's 'cause you're a lily-livered,

260
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:48,625
chicken pants who sleeps
on plastic sheets.

261
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:51,398
If you are done,
I suggest we start with cause of death.

262
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,869
Radiation poisoning.

263
00:15:54,777 --> 00:15:55,781
Drowning.

264
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,423
Killer nun.

265
00:16:01,436 --> 00:16:03,289
Maybe we should try location.

266
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,432
Some kind of a bombing range?

267
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:07,884
Anchor... age, Alaska?

268
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:10,340
Convent.

269
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:13,808
Is that
where they keep the killer nuns?

270
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:17,143
Look, all I'm saying is some of the nuns
I knew could get extremely agitated.

271
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:19,959
Tell me you got something better
than agitated nuns.

272
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:23,148
Well, we got an ID off dead guy
number two's prints, boss.

273
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,950
Bob Simms.

274
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:27,149
51, former Navy chief.

275
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,804
Current address
is Central Union Shelter in DC.

276
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,958
- He was homeless.
- Connection to the first victim?

277
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:33,785
None we could find, unless you count

278
00:16:33,845 --> 00:16:35,806
yanking his brain out
through his nostrils.

279
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,298
Video was uploaded to
another anonymous CyberVid account.

280
00:16:38,358 --> 00:16:41,384
That's McGee-speak for "we weren't
able to trace that one, either".

281
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:43,448
I might be able to help with that.

282
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,030
Those videos are all over the news.

283
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:48,737
As soon as I saw them,
I knew I had to come in.

284
00:16:49,646 --> 00:16:51,094
I think I know who made them.

285
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:57,298
It's Tommy's band, but Billy was
really the one that made things happen.

286
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:58,997
I can't believe he's dead.

287
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,088
Were you and he?

288
00:17:01,497 --> 00:17:02,691
Just friends.

289
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:05,447
I usually like guys
that are a little more mature.

290
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:07,069
Older.

291
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:11,253
- The video?
- Right,

292
00:17:12,202 --> 00:17:15,728
a while ago, Billy decided we should
start promoting ourselves a little more.

293
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:18,121
Answered an ad for
this guy who makes music videos.

294
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:19,573
This is ours.

295
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:30,267
I'm not really a professional singer.

296
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:32,068
<i>Smell so good...</i>

297
00:17:32,128 --> 00:17:33,675
Well, you have a very...

298
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:36,520
interesting way
of holding the microphone.

299
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,656
No, it's okay.

300
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:42,062
Haven't really figured
out what I am yet.

301
00:17:42,142 --> 00:17:44,621
<i>... of thing you want to drown in.</i>

302
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:46,327
<i>I need to know...</i>

303
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:47,540
Wait, this is it.

304
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,694
<i>No matter what the cost
There's no cost to high,</i>

305
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:53,033
<i>I ain't lyin'...</i>

306
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:55,872
- Name?
- Director's info is on the disc.

307
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:02,323
Sam Loomis,
Loominosity Pictures.

308
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:04,584
It's in Arlington.

309
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:06,212
Take DiNozzo.

310
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:13,641
She's pretty.

311
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,678
- She's a good agent.
- You guys hiring?

312
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,264
I wouldn't mind hanging out.

313
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:21,300
I feel safe here.

314
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:24,729
I can assign an agent to you.

315
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:26,321
You?

316
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:27,621
No.

317
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:30,670
I'll be okay, I guess.

318
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:34,764
You got a problem, give me a call.

319
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,861
Only if you have a problem.

320
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:40,288
That obvious?

321
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,162
And I was trying to hide it.

322
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:43,963
Another thing I'm not good at...

323
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:47,158
Take care of yourself, Rose.

324
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,120
I'm working on it.

325
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:58,197
Nice girl.

326
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,210
- Wasn't my type, though.
- Really?

327
00:19:01,632 --> 00:19:04,356
- She was breathing.
- Well, I have standards, Ziva.

328
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,188
Otherwise, I'd be dating you.

329
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:08,774
Hello.

330
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:14,359
- What do you want?
- NCIS.

331
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,488
Like to ask you a few questions.

332
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,317
Sorry. Been robbed once already
this month.

333
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:30,603
- We're looking for Sam Loomis.
- You're looking at him.

334
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:32,171
The music video director?

335
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:33,710
Yeah, and...

336
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:36,831
weddings and I did one bris.

337
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:39,179
Come on in.

338
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,856
Well, it's like you died
and went to probie heaven.

339
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:44,532
Sorry, this place is such a mess.

340
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:46,967
Used to be a lot neater.
I was an accountant.

341
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:50,200
Didn't even have e-mail when I retired,
and now look at me.

342
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:52,125
What can I do for you?

343
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:53,818
Do you know...?

344
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,982
Hang on a sec.
I...

345
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:59,491
I hit some tail at the assisted
living center across the street,

346
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:02,721
and, now she won't leave me alone.

347
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:04,988
Sorry...
yes.

348
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,999
- I know him. He was my first.
- "First"?

349
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:10,958
Music video. I went down
to the Apple Store to get an iPod

350
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:13,466
for my grandson,
and stayed for the free classes.

351
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:14,909
And now I pull in

352
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:18,064
five C-notes a month
shooting freelance video.

353
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:27,616
- Billy Cole is dead.
- Yeah, I know.

354
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:30,729
I saw it on the net.
What does it have to do with me?

355
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:34,342
Your video is very similar
to the one the killer left behind.

356
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:35,775
So that makes me a suspect?

357
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,225
It makes a coincidence
and I'm not a big fan of them.

358
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:42,250
Well, actually,
it makes about 300,000 coincidences.

359
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:45,763
That first video,
I didn't have a clue what I was doing.

360
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:47,955
Luckily, I had some help.

361
00:20:50,438 --> 00:20:52,331
Been working or surfing the Internet?

362
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:54,879
<i>Both. </i>Sam Loomis
used a Web site to make

363
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:57,088
<i>the </i>Just Roommates <i>video, boss.</i>

364
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:59,216
The link is to a viral ad campaign.

365
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,220
The site lets you upload your own
footage and randomly cuts in images

366
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,877
it grabs from your photo file.

367
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:07,510
<i>Right. The instant</i> music video killer
must've used it for his video.

368
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:09,040
How many...?

369
00:21:09,673 --> 00:21:10,498
Hits.

370
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:13,707
This site doesn't log IP addresses, so

371
00:21:13,787 --> 00:21:16,112
we're going to have
to go <i>through them by hand.</i>

372
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:18,432
It still doesn't let
Loomis off the hook.

373
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:20,970
<i>We're running his alibi right now
for the night of the murders.</i>

374
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,388
<i>Should we bring him in?</i>

375
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,991
Let you know.

376
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,687
<i>Aren't you going to say hello,
Agent Gibbs?</i>

377
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:37,152
Hello.

378
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,198
<i>You won't be able to trace this call.
Not where I am.</i>

379
00:21:40,474 --> 00:21:41,688
Yeah? Where's that?

380
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:44,852
<i>I'm sure you'd like to know,
but I'm not going to make it easy.</i>

381
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:46,475
<i>Not for someone like you.</i>

382
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,265
<i>A decorated Marine,</i>

383
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:51,623
<i>Six-time recipient
of the Meritorious Civilian</i>

384
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:53,136
<i>Service Award.</i>

385
00:21:53,268 --> 00:21:55,994
Yeah, I'll tell you what, after
I bring you in, it might just be seven.

386
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:58,220
<i>I know you'll do your best to find me.</i>

387
00:21:58,714 --> 00:22:01,202
<i>I've been looking for you a long time,
Agent Gibbs.</i>

388
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,081
<i>I expect no less.</i>

389
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:05,165
<i>How's the trace coming?</i>

390
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,136
It's a voice-over IP, boss.

391
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:11,227
- He's bouncing it all over the world.
<i>- So determined, so capable...</i>

392
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:13,455
<i>You know, you and I are a lot alike.</i>

393
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:14,558
Yeah.

394
00:22:15,115 --> 00:22:17,296
- How's that?
<i>- We're both going to hell.</i>

395
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:20,293
Well, I think you should speak
for yourself.

396
00:22:20,897 --> 00:22:22,867
<i>A man like you is not easy to find.</i>

397
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:27,274
<i>That's why I've something very special
planned for you, Agent Gibbs.</i>

398
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:29,653
<i>I think you're really going to like it.</i>

399
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,258
Sorry, boss.

400
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,945
- Yeah, Abs, what do you got?
- It's another video, Gibbs.

401
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,363
It just popped up.
I'm sending the URL now.

402
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:49,677
Abs, you're sure this is the killer's?
These links usually come with bodies.

403
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:50,581
Yeah.

404
00:22:50,641 --> 00:22:53,158
I was monitoring
the killer's original CyberVid account

405
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:54,765
and I caught this uploading.

406
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:56,457
Oh, my God.

407
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,770
That poster is right outside my lab.

408
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:01,224
He was here.
He walked right by my lab.

409
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:04,730
Abby, this isn't a flash code.
It's H.264.

410
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:05,774
Hey, McGee?

411
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,991
Boss, this isn't a video.
It's streaming live.

412
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:09,807
He's outside Abby's lab.

413
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:22,027
I can see him, Gibbs.
He's right outside my door.

414
00:23:22,107 --> 00:23:24,622
- Abby, we're coming, Abs.
- Lock down the entire building.

415
00:23:24,682 --> 00:23:26,333
- Almost there.
- Meet us on level one!

416
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:28,002
Intruder may be armed.

417
00:23:28,062 --> 00:23:29,136
Just hurry.

418
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:41,546
Freeze!

419
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:46,440
Hell, Harry.

420
00:23:46,702 --> 00:23:48,312
I'm just here to mop up.

421
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:54,035
Camera's in the cart.
I'll check on Abby.

422
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:56,600
It's okay. You're...

423
00:24:01,953 --> 00:24:04,759
- Again with the <i>Krazy Glue</i>.
- Consider yourself lucky.

424
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:07,082
It was either that
or hydrochloric acid.

425
00:24:07,224 --> 00:24:09,696
- Did you catch him?
- Well, we caught somebody.

426
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,639
Jani-cam.
That's a new one.

427
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,936
Do you really believe Harry's involved?

428
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:19,746
Gibbs will know soon enough.

429
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:21,846
I've never been
so scared in my whole life.

430
00:24:22,024 --> 00:24:24,392
Except when my stalker-ex
tried to kill me.

431
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:28,171
And when my insane assistant,
Chip, had me at knifepoint.

432
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:30,906
And when McGee's crazy fan
put a gun to my head...

433
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,150
We-we got it, Abs.

434
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:36,646
- How's Harry?
- He's innocent.

435
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,979
He's got an alibi for both murders.

436
00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:41,567
Does he have any idea
how the camera got in his lunch box?

437
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:43,221
He was moonlighting last month.

438
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,898
The killer could have planted
the camera while Harry was off base.

439
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,465
If he planted the camera month ago,

440
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:49,674
he couldn't have known
Gibbs's assigned to the case.

441
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:51,667
He was targeting Gibbs
from the beginning.

442
00:24:52,227 --> 00:24:53,874
You must've really
pissed somebody off.

443
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,120
It's not a short list.

444
00:24:56,592 --> 00:24:59,307
Of people that you've angered just
because you have

445
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:02,647
rock-solid principles and so it's easy
for people to misunderstand that,

446
00:25:02,727 --> 00:25:05,025
and misconstrue.
You know, people...

447
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:06,840
Why don't you quit
while you're behind.

448
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,229
- I'm trying.
- It's not about me.

449
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:12,228
Whatever it was about,
we've had a serious breach in security,

450
00:25:12,288 --> 00:25:14,570
not to mention a serial killer
still out there.

451
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:17,141
I've got a press conference in five.
How close are we?

452
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:19,691
The phone call rules out
our only suspect.

453
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:22,058
Sam Loomis was with us
when the killer called.

454
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,413
Keep me updated.

455
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:27,625
Somebody get McGee
a new pair of shoes.

456
00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:32,222
Can you trace the signal, Abs?

457
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,053
I don't even know how it was broadcast.

458
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:35,293
But I'll find out.

459
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:37,968
Just I have two questions.

460
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:41,112
This video,
it's different than the others.

461
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:43,867
- Why?
- Okay, what's the other question?

462
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,638
Can I stay with you tonight?

463
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,281
<i>That's why I've something very special
planned for you, Agent Gibbs.</i>

464
00:25:54,076 --> 00:25:56,324
What do you have planned?

465
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,269
Well, I was hoping
you could tell me, Duck.

466
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:03,875
This is a fascinating individual,
Jethro.

467
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:05,816
I can think of another word for him.

468
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:07,007
Yeah, crazy.

469
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:11,465
Well, the precise term is
narcissistic personality disorder.

470
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:13,700
Yeah, well,
I'm familiar with that, too.

471
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,698
Yes, but where Agent DiNozzo

472
00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:18,948
has an excessive need for admiration,

473
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,182
he has empathy as well.
Something our killer lacks.

474
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,702
It's all a game to him.

475
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:26,883
Yes, and one he has chosen
to play with you.

476
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:27,951
I noticed.

477
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,134
- Why?
- Like all narcissists,

478
00:26:31,213 --> 00:26:34,547
he believes himself
to be the hero of his own story.

479
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:36,665
And all heroes need a villain.

480
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:40,025
Apparently,
for that role he has cast you.

481
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:43,039
Doesn't care who he kills.

482
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:45,358
Well, he wants his 15 minutes.

483
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:47,080
He wants to be famous.

484
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,906
And, sadly, the more he kills...

485
00:26:49,977 --> 00:26:51,263
More famous he becomes.

486
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:56,118
I shudder to think what he has planned
for a grand finale.

487
00:26:56,238 --> 00:26:57,869
Perhaps some sort of doom...

488
00:27:03,192 --> 00:27:05,460
Yes, I knew I'd seen that before.

489
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,251
Duck?

490
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:08,962
The killer's last clues
were quite literal.

491
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,897
I suspect the same here.

492
00:27:13,837 --> 00:27:15,802
That countdown likely refers

493
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:18,596
to the time of the next murder.

494
00:27:18,815 --> 00:27:20,473
Need something more specific
than that.

495
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:23,634
Yeah, well,
this is the doomsday clock.

496
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:26,416
It's a symbol of how close
the human race

497
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:28,273
is to nuclear annihilation.

498
00:27:28,728 --> 00:27:31,089
The clock time changes

499
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,483
with the geopolitical situation.

500
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:36,447
It's currently set
to five minutes to midnight.

501
00:27:39,184 --> 00:27:40,877
Less than three hours from now.

502
00:27:43,564 --> 00:27:45,828
If Ducky's right,
we're already out of time.

503
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:47,667
If Ducky's right,
then the murder location

504
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:49,341
is in one of the other two clues.

505
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,296
I will send alerts
to all churches in the area.

506
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:53,657
Shipyards, harbors, and Navy.

507
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:55,091
- McGee.
- Yeah, boss?

508
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:01,282
I don't know.
Tony and Ziva got the easy ones.

509
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:03,290
- Phone call, McGee.
- Right.

510
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,441
Still working on back-tracing
the killer's call.

511
00:28:15,191 --> 00:28:16,534
Something wrong, boss?

512
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,034
He's playing with us.

513
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:19,573
He's been playing with us.

514
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:25,783
Got us doing exactly
what he wants us to do.

515
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:27,040
What choice do we have?

516
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,471
You want to evacuate the Navy Yard?

517
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:34,547
- He's coming here.
- How do you know?

518
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,221
That could mean anything.

519
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:41,470
It means his next victim
is going to be in the Navy Yard.

520
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,891
I don't know if you've noticed, but
we run the Navy out of the Navy Yard,

521
00:28:45,095 --> 00:28:47,102
and you just want
to abandon ship based on a hunch?

522
00:28:47,218 --> 00:28:48,727
The camera in Harry's cart.

523
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:51,156
Video wasn't for us.
It's for him.

524
00:28:51,908 --> 00:28:53,378
You think that was recon.

525
00:28:53,688 --> 00:28:55,271
Killer was scouting the base?

526
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,155
NCIS I get,
but why evacuate the whole Yard?

527
00:28:59,506 --> 00:29:01,991
You can't kill anybody,
Leon, if there's no one here to kill.

528
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:05,036
All right, I'll give you points
for the unexpected.

529
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:08,286
We were going to run a security
lockdown drill next week.

530
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,346
Move it up.

531
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,793
Not sure if I hope
you're right or wrong.

532
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,489
Yeah, McGee.

533
00:29:17,742 --> 00:29:20,429
<i>Boss, I was</i> running the killer's
call through a spectrum analyzer.

534
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:22,107
- And I noticed that...
<i>- McGee.</i>

535
00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:23,474
The call.

536
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:26,057
The killer wasn't actually on the line.
It was a recording.

537
00:29:26,284 --> 00:29:29,286
Recording? What do you mean a recording?
Sounded like a conversation.

538
00:29:29,346 --> 00:29:30,957
<i>He must have</i> prerecorded segments.

539
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:33,723
Used your voice to trigger
generalized <i>responses.</i>

540
00:29:33,783 --> 00:29:35,604
<i>Could have been anywhere.</i>
Anybody.

541
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:37,056
Not anybody.

542
00:29:37,116 --> 00:29:38,679
Abby's been working on the jani-cam.

543
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:40,487
She was able to get
a print off the lens.

544
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:44,783
Explains the timing
of the killer's call to you.

545
00:29:44,864 --> 00:29:47,161
Loomis had it prerecorded
in case we got too close.

546
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:48,662
What better way to look innocent

547
00:29:48,722 --> 00:29:50,903
than have the killer call
while he was in our presence?

548
00:29:52,036 --> 00:29:53,802
Alibi doesn't check out.

549
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:56,159
Boss.

550
00:29:58,081 --> 00:29:59,215
Five minutes to spare.

551
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,797
Boy, you guys must really not have
any other suspects.

552
00:30:16,204 --> 00:30:17,410
We got enough.

553
00:30:21,283 --> 00:30:23,410
- Where'd you get that?
- Look familiar?

554
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,887
Yeah, I used to shoot
time-lapse shots with it.

555
00:30:25,947 --> 00:30:28,161
It got stolen from
my place about a month ago.

556
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:29,913
- Did you report it?
- No.

557
00:30:30,225 --> 00:30:31,581
I fired my cleaning lady.

558
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:43,723
What?

559
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:46,261
It's hot in here.

560
00:30:46,771 --> 00:30:47,846
No, it's fine to me.

561
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:50,060
Man's got an uncanny ability.

562
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:51,851
Should run his own sweat lodge.

563
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:53,604
<i>- Tell me about Billy Cole.
- Look, </i>

564
00:30:53,664 --> 00:30:56,339
<i>talk to</i> Sally Hardesty
at Sunshine Retirement.

565
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,066
I was with her at the time
of the murders.

566
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:01,626
She said she doesn't remember.

567
00:31:01,978 --> 00:31:03,196
She's old.

568
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:07,283
You know, she never remembers my name.
Just...

569
00:31:10,976 --> 00:31:12,956
... You ask her about Magic Fingers.

570
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,301
Boy.

571
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,564
It's all you, probie.

572
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:20,880
I hear you're good on a computer.

573
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,883
What, is that a crime now?

574
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:27,413
Well, depends on what you're doing.

575
00:31:30,478 --> 00:31:33,049
This how you reinvented yourself, Sam?

576
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,065
You got no right to do this to me!

577
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,481
Sit down.

578
00:31:40,653 --> 00:31:41,943
I pay my taxes.

579
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:44,988
I could have my whole life
I've done what I've been told.

580
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:46,197
<i>I'm a good person!</i>

581
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:48,116
- Something's wrong.
<i>- Sit down!</i>

582
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,701
I will not sit down!

583
00:31:50,573 --> 00:31:52,119
I didn't do anything wrong!

584
00:31:56,975 --> 00:31:58,013
Help me...

585
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,115
Call Base <i>medical.</i>

586
00:32:08,216 --> 00:32:09,725
<i>EMS is on the way.</i>

587
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:30,575
The Virgin Mary he's not, Jethro.

588
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,411
He was poisoned.

589
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:35,950
Abby found traces of fludrocortisone

590
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,374
in a patch he wore
on his skin for arthritis.

591
00:32:38,545 --> 00:32:41,818
It made his blood pressure skyrocket,
which in turn...

592
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:42,917
Heart attack.

593
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,319
Well, that's putting it mildly.

594
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:46,771
His eyes?

595
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,344
That's a result of the increase
in vascular pressure.

596
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,611
No doubt done for dramatic effect.

597
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:53,640
Our killer is nothing,
if not a showman.

598
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:55,235
Nice timing.

599
00:32:55,295 --> 00:32:58,728
Yeah, well, the advantage
of a transdermal delivery system is

600
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,770
that it's remarkably precise.

601
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:05,818
Jethro, it's not every day
that you suffer a setback in a case.

602
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,279
Setback?

603
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:10,281
This man died in your custody.

604
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:12,199
Was murdered in my custody.

605
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,201
Exactly, right under your nose.

606
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:16,862
I can imagine how you must feel.

607
00:33:16,922 --> 00:33:18,002
What's your point?

608
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,953
My concern is that the killer
knows how you feel.

609
00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:24,128
He's pushing you for some reason.

610
00:33:24,342 --> 00:33:27,340
You're the arch enemy in
this narrative that he's constructed.

611
00:33:28,235 --> 00:33:30,204
One can not help but wonder:

612
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:32,428
towards what is he pushing you?

613
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:38,723
- Yeah, Gibbs.
<i>- More bad news, boss.</i>

614
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:39,861
I'll be right up.

615
00:33:42,132 --> 00:33:42,832
No.

616
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:49,242
Fourth video just appeared, boss.

617
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:50,905
He's using a proxy server in China.

618
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:53,337
I'm running a snooper now,
but I wouldn't hold your breath.

619
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:54,397
Let's see it.

620
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:58,717
<i>I guess you really must not have
any other suspects.</i>

621
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:01,624
That's the camera in
our interrogation room.

622
00:34:04,658 --> 00:34:05,670
<i>It's hot in here.</i>

623
00:34:08,152 --> 00:34:10,952
<i>You got no right to do this to me.</i>

624
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:12,190
<i>Sit down!</i>

625
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:16,320
<i>No, I will not sit down.
I did nothing wrong.</i>

626
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:19,798
<i>Help me...</i>

627
00:34:30,942 --> 00:34:32,572
Is this supposed to mean you're next?

628
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,032
The killer's never shown
the victim's face before.

629
00:34:35,764 --> 00:34:37,680
We will not let
anything happen to you, Gibbs...

630
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,895
- if you want, I can...
- What I want

631
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,621
is to know how he got that footage.

632
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:45,208
He has it because we sent it to him.

633
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:49,022
And by "we", I mean "me".

634
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:53,882
I was trying to figure out
how the killer

635
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:56,512
was broadcasting a live stream
through Harry's jani-cam,

636
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,395
and I uploaded the firmware
to try to track it, and I got herpes.

637
00:35:01,453 --> 00:35:03,808
She means a computer virus, boss.

638
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:07,565
Yeah, and the camera then uploaded
a Trojan horse to the mainframe

639
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:09,859
that hijacked
our internal security system.

640
00:35:09,992 --> 00:35:13,029
It's been cyber-casting
our interrogation room cameras for over

641
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,677
- 24 hours.
- Disable it.

642
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,579
I did. I'm just...
I'm so sorry, Gibbs.

643
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:19,076
Not your fault, Abby.

644
00:35:19,156 --> 00:35:21,412
It's your face on there, Gibbs.
You're the next victim.

645
00:35:22,282 --> 00:35:23,705
I'm not anyone's victim.

646
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:26,208
You could be dying of poison
right now.

647
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:29,796
The killer could have put
a bomb in your cell phone, Gibbs.

648
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:36,899
No bomb, but still...

649
00:35:37,508 --> 00:35:39,422
we don't know what this video means.

650
00:35:39,482 --> 00:35:42,016
We know that someone's
gonna die in less than an hour.

651
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:43,787
Trojan horse.
Can you trace it?

652
00:35:43,847 --> 00:35:44,935
I tried, Gibbs.

653
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,788
I couldn't even trace the jani-cam.

654
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:48,670
I mean, the killer is bouncing signals.

655
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,265
Did you try both together?

656
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,140
You are a God amongst men.

657
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,823
The jani-cam and the Trojan horse
are outgoing sources.

658
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:59,407
- Now we have two.
- If we turn them both on...

659
00:35:59,495 --> 00:36:01,731
We can triangulate back to the killer.

660
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:05,581
Or you could just stand there
looking at me.

661
00:36:08,748 --> 00:36:11,295
- Releasing the Trojan horse.
- Re-initializing the camera.

662
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,549
Carrier signals are broadcasting.

663
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:16,133
Trying to hide behind the Great
Firewall of China, but...

664
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:17,214
We got him.

665
00:36:17,274 --> 00:36:20,221
Video is being rerouted
to a DSL account registered to...

666
00:36:22,662 --> 00:36:24,063
Rose Woodhouse.

667
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:26,132
Local Leos are at Rose's place.

668
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:27,894
Neighbors say she just left.

669
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:29,938
Hasn't seen the roommate in two days,
and boss...

670
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:31,473
there's blood all over his room.

671
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:34,318
No recent credit card activity,
but I did find this.

672
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:38,030
Rose registered
this trademark two weeks ago.

673
00:36:38,111 --> 00:36:39,156
CyberVid Killer.

674
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,783
Smart. Imagine how much money

675
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:43,201
Manson would have made
if he owned the name, <i>Helter Skelter</i>.

676
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:45,876
Gets better:
her father was an Egyptologist.

677
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:49,406
Well, that explains the savvy
with the nose-pick from hell.

678
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:50,985
Killer's last video.

679
00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:56,191
Whatever it means, we've got less
than 30 minutes to figure it out.

680
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:58,884
If it means Gibbs is the victim,
then we should just stay right here.

681
00:36:58,944 --> 00:37:00,743
- And if I'm not?
- Someone else dies.

682
00:37:01,935 --> 00:37:02,972
Where is that?

683
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:05,391
Sears Tower.
Chicago.

684
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,162
Moscow.

685
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:09,647
Rio.

686
00:37:10,212 --> 00:37:11,272
Death by jet lag?

687
00:37:11,353 --> 00:37:12,908
The clue is not the city.

688
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,402
Clue is the snow.

689
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:21,040
Boss, I am not a God among men,
you are.

690
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:22,378
I've got it.

691
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:23,868
Now, my CPU is too small.

692
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:25,374
I'm gonna let that slide.

693
00:37:25,434 --> 00:37:27,636
I'm gonna need
a little more time to figure it out.

694
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:30,487
Well, it is the CyberVid Killer.

695
00:37:30,547 --> 00:37:32,710
If McGee wasn't meant
to do the heavy lifting, who was?

696
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:36,796
This is the only video
that's contained flash frames.

697
00:37:38,598 --> 00:37:41,378
That is radiographic static,
commonly referred to as...

698
00:37:41,438 --> 00:37:42,438
Snow.

699
00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:44,940
But it just looks like snow.
It's actually encrypted data.

700
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,099
There's another link
embedded in the snow.

701
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:50,957
It's a live video link.

702
00:37:56,265 --> 00:37:58,733
There's the roommate.
At least he's still alive.

703
00:37:58,978 --> 00:37:59,862
For now.

704
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:01,693
Got our next murder weapon.

705
00:38:01,753 --> 00:38:02,773
Shotgun.

706
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:04,963
And location:
that was Loomis' place.

707
00:38:06,189 --> 00:38:07,189
We will go.

708
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:10,062
If you are the intended victim,
this may just be a way to lure you out.

709
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,122
It's working.

710
00:38:14,882 --> 00:38:16,119
Less than two minutes.

711
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:22,218
Really wish
you'd stayed in the car.

712
00:38:22,298 --> 00:38:25,054
DiNozzo, will you shut up
or I'm gonna shoot you?

713
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:32,476
NCIS!

714
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:34,171
Drop your weapon, Rose.

715
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:35,644
I wish I could.

716
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,130
I'm sorry.

717
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:40,151
We will shoot you.

718
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:42,363
Shoot her!
She's freaking crazy!

719
00:38:42,444 --> 00:38:43,446
Drop it.

720
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:44,979
I can't...

721
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:46,815
Please just leave.

722
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:50,447
Somebody shoot her!
Please, I don't want to die.

723
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:52,289
You have three seconds
or we will shoot.

724
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:01,121
Boss?

725
00:39:02,515 --> 00:39:03,843
What the hell are you doing?

726
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,477
Put the gun down, Rose.

727
00:39:08,631 --> 00:39:09,890
He said he'd kill me.

728
00:39:10,006 --> 00:39:12,268
Are you crazy?
Shoot her. Come on!

729
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:14,478
Only one I'm gonna shoot is you.

730
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,285
It's a dead man's switch.

731
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:32,070
I've got her wired with C-4.

732
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,952
So you shoot me,

733
00:39:35,196 --> 00:39:36,292
and we all die.

734
00:39:48,004 --> 00:39:50,284
Come on,
Gibbs, do you really want to die?

735
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:51,344
Do you?

736
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,048
No, you want to be famous.

737
00:39:56,108 --> 00:39:57,480
You don't want to die.

738
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:10,367
Get this the hell off me!

739
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:15,788
All right, just hold still.

740
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:19,760
N.C.I.S.

741
00:40:20,571 --> 00:40:22,713
I knew
I should have gone with the FBI.

742
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:26,300
It's cliché, but, look what you get
for trying something different.

743
00:40:27,264 --> 00:40:28,264
Clear.

744
00:40:28,696 --> 00:40:31,371
He said if I didn't just stand there,
he'd kill me.

745
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:34,204
You said we were shooting
another music video!

746
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:35,351
I hope you fry!

747
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:38,020
Come on, Rose.
Come on, let's go.

748
00:40:38,785 --> 00:40:39,888
He set her up.

749
00:40:40,558 --> 00:40:41,583
How did you know?

750
00:40:42,903 --> 00:40:44,206
The video camera?

751
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:47,202
Yes, they had
one of those at every murder.

752
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:48,451
On the victim.

753
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:50,825
Eye was the murder weapon.

754
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:54,615
Total cliché, you know.

755
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:56,840
You ripped that off from <i>Seven</i>.

756
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,139
Wrong!

757
00:40:58,941 --> 00:41:02,935
At the end of Seven, the cops killed
the serial killer, not another victim.

758
00:41:02,995 --> 00:41:05,131
It's totally different!

759
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,830
Doesn't matter.

760
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,389
I still win.

761
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,080
You?

762
00:41:19,547 --> 00:41:23,129
You may be the famous
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

763
00:41:24,758 --> 00:41:26,093
But you're...

764
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:29,028
You're nothing but a set piece.

765
00:41:32,327 --> 00:41:33,562
Who caught Gacy, huh?

766
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:35,828
Manson?

767
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:37,578
I don't know.

768
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,579
But Tommy Doyle?

769
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:44,772
He's gonna be a household name
by the 10:00 news.

770
00:41:50,353 --> 00:41:53,694
<i>Authorities say the CyberVid Killer
is in custody.</i>

771
00:41:53,754 --> 00:41:55,789
<i>However, citing possible
links to terrorism, </i>

772
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,057
<i>officials are not releasing
his identity,</i>

773
00:41:58,117 --> 00:42:00,769
<i>and details of how they arrested him
are being kept under wraps...</i>

774
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,614
Thank you and congratulations.

775
00:42:05,443 --> 00:42:07,234
Way to go, Marie.

776
00:42:08,227 --> 00:42:10,738
<i>Our sources believe we
may never know his real name.</i>

777
00:42:11,503 --> 00:42:14,992
Yeah, that's got to hurt.
All that for a question mark.

778
00:42:15,073 --> 00:42:18,460
It's very revealing the lengths
that some men will go

779
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,080
to thrust themselves
into the limelight,

780
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:24,221
while others are content
to live quietly...

781
00:42:24,281 --> 00:42:26,240
- in solitude.
- The next award to be presented

782
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,714
is the Meritorious Civilian
Service Award

783
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:32,907
for demonstrating unusual initiative
and a pattern of excellence.

784
00:42:35,497 --> 00:42:38,194
Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
