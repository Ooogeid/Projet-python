00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:09,092
Rivkin attacked me
and I had no choice.

3
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:12,315
- It was justified.
- Rivkin is dead. Tony killed him.

4
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,674
You could have walked away,
but, no, you let him up!

5
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:16,975
- You put four in his chest!
- You loved him.

6
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:19,273
Guess I'll never know.
Gibbs.

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,648
Perhaps it is best if one of us
gets transferred to another team.

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,733
Take care of yourself.

9
00:00:25,904 --> 00:00:28,299
- She's still in Tel Aviv?
- When is she coming back?

10
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,238
She's not.
Guess she'll call when she's ready.

11
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:36,369
Tell me everything you know

12
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:37,911
about NCIS.

13
00:00:57,188 --> 00:00:58,931
You will tell me all that you know.

14
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:02,313
Who you are...

15
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:04,480
how you ended up here...

16
00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:08,281
what you are doing.

17
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:11,391
And you will talk.

18
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:18,147
I'm not going to tell you anything.

23
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:53,863
The Soviets had some success...

24
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:55,477
with pure ethanol.

25
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,411
This formula...

26
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:02,647
is of my own design.

27
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:07,043
Mixture of sodium pentothal...

28
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:09,670
and several other agents
I have found...

29
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:11,588
effective...

30
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:14,417
in extracting the truth.

31
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:17,220
It will not take long
for it to start working.

32
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:21,474
You're going to be dead soon.

33
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:25,382
Truth or not.

34
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,571
I tell ya,
I think this stuff's working already.

35
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:29,657
You know, I...

36
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,597
I have studied America.

37
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:36,750
Carefully.

38
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,114
I believe in...

39
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,452
knowing...

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,442
my enemy.

41
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,906
I believe a man is
as big as what he's seeking.

42
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,378
I believe you're a big man,
Mr. Macreedy.

43
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:53,972
My name is Saleem Ulman.

44
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:56,629
You will tell me who you are.

45
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:05,718
I'm very Special Agent
Anthony DiNozzo

46
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:07,944
of the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

47
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:12,066
You know, a few months ago, I had...

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,279
not even heard...

49
00:03:14,722 --> 00:03:15,778
of NCIS.

50
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:19,991
And that may have cost
the lives of several of my people.

51
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,951
That will not happen again.

52
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:25,886
Now please, tell me,

53
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,164
what is your mission?

54
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,216
We're...

55
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:40,121
we're tasked with pursuing crimes
that involve

56
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:43,806
the United States Navy
or Marine Corps and their families.

57
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:46,859
And our duties are...

58
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,024
expansive.

59
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,437
International terrorism,

60
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,559
espionage.

61
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:55,818
Even,

62
00:03:56,343 --> 00:03:58,279
you know,
an eight ball of methamphetamine.

63
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,573
Stand down, Petty Officer Dimarco!

64
00:04:02,197 --> 00:04:04,784
- You hit him high, I'll hit him low.
- I don't like the sound of that.

65
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,914
- You hit him low, I'll hit him high.
- <i>Our team consists of a gang of four.</i>

66
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:09,207
<i>Tight-knit.</i>

67
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:11,228
<i>My partner is Tim McGee.</i>

68
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:13,711
<i>Small muscles, big brain,
heart of a lion.</i>

69
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:15,941
<i>Together we're virtually
unstoppable.</i>

70
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:18,007
<i>- Virtually.</i>
- I got him!

71
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:19,953
Tony, he's going for the knife!

72
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,864
<i>Our team leader is...</i>

73
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:26,591
<i>the fearless Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.</i>

74
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:28,475
<i>Former Gunnery Sergeant,</i>

75
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,811
<i>Marine sniper, coffee aficionado</i>

76
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,007
<i>and functional mute.</i>

77
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,883
Piece of cake.

78
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,061
- Simple as pie.
- Yeah, smooth as silk.

79
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:42,782
And the fourth member of your team?

80
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:47,119
Lost her.

81
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:48,139
Her?

82
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,132
For the last four years,
that slot has been...

83
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:54,836
filled by...

84
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:57,974
Mossad Liaison Officer Ziva David.

85
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:00,005
Mossad.

86
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,722
Mossad.

87
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,016
And...

88
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:04,846
- NCIS...
- That's right.

89
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:09,057
The organizations...

90
00:05:10,138 --> 00:05:12,061
responsible
for the deaths of my men.

91
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:14,649
Geez!

92
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:18,359
All I can say is, if we killed them,
they must have been bad guys.

93
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:21,285
They were martyrs for the cause!

94
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:25,374
So your team is here,
then what, to finish the job?

95
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,826
To shut down my organization?

96
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:30,171
Say, can I get a glass
of chardonnay or something?

97
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:33,078
Is your team here
to finish the job?!

98
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:37,589
Not only are you wrong,

99
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:40,827
but you're wrong
at the top of your voice.

100
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:43,727
What does that mean, huh?

101
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,840
Can you imagine Nicholson
in <i>Bad Day at Black Rock</i>?

102
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:48,769
- I would have liked to see that.
- Listen,

103
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:50,633
where is the rest of your team?

104
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:53,270
I don't know.

105
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:57,029
I don't care about your team.

106
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,924
I don't care about my team.

107
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:09,620
Okay.

108
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,539
You were driving in the desert

109
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,039
without backup.

110
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:18,307
So what are you doing here?

111
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:20,963
Well, Saleem, there's
only one force on earth

112
00:06:21,254 --> 00:06:22,638
that can short-circuit

113
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,925
a man's better instincts,
put fire in his veins

114
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,012
and makes him dive headlong

115
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,581
into danger with no regard
for his own well-being.

116
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,363
Vengeance.

117
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:41,541
I'm here to kill you.

118
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:52,025
Vendetta.

119
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:57,389
DiNozzo...

120
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,294
is an Italian name.

121
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:02,301
An educated man.

122
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,656
Got my BS from Yale University.

123
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:07,260
Yale.

124
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:09,905
I got my BS on the streets.

125
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,595
Yale.

126
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,267
You guys got a lousy football team.

127
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:17,520
18 national championships.

128
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:21,023
When was the last time you won one,
a hundred years ago?

129
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,441
1927.

130
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,941
Short memories.

131
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:27,918
As a people,

132
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,524
that is my impression of you.

133
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,579
Wait, sorry, you did
an impression of me?

134
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,543
I missed it.

135
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,454
Go back, do it again, but this time

136
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:37,760
why don't you gargle with some sand?

137
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:39,903
Get that <i>basso profundo</i> going.

138
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,628
That's how you nail my essence.
It's all in the voice.

139
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:44,486
How did you choose me...

140
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:47,163
As the...

141
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:48,785
target...

142
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,010
of your blood lust?

143
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:52,309
I didn't.

144
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:56,690
Hell, a little while ago,
I didn't even know you existed.

145
00:07:58,184 --> 00:07:59,505
I was happier then.

146
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,089
 Tony, I'm not
your home theater guy.

147
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,560
Don't be redunculous.

148
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,287
Of course
you're my home theater guy.

149
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:11,203
- All right, you getting a picture?
- Yeah, it's just not crisp, you know.

150
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,324
It's not rich.

151
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,461
What's your source,
Blu-ray or satellite?

152
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:15,293
Neither.

153
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:18,164
It's the streaming HD thing from...

154
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,373
a net films account.

155
00:08:19,513 --> 00:08:21,391
The greens are blue,
the blues are green,

156
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:24,429
the oranges are pink
and the reds are sort of eggplant-y.

157
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:26,075
A problem
with your component cables.

158
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:28,032
You're streaming
through a wireless setup?

159
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,301
'Cause if it's HD,
you need wireless-n components.

160
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,126
Also, plasma, 10-80i, 10-80p?

161
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,557
- Will you just come over and fix it?
- What's in it for me?

162
00:08:37,294 --> 00:08:40,683
Digitally remastered 1955 classic,
<i>Bad Day at Black Rock</i>.

163
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,478
Spencer Tracy with the one arm.

164
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:44,071
Is that anything like money?

165
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:47,125
Because money is what is customarily
exchanged for services rendered.

166
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:48,749
It's computers.
It's your thing.

167
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:50,990
If I had a thing,
I would show it off all the time.

168
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,781
There are rules against that,
DiNozzo.

169
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:56,243
Grab your gear.
We've got a dead petty officer.

170
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,871
- Another meth overdose?
- You know as much as I do.

171
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:03,584
Tony, now?

172
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:05,544
It feels like now.

173
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:07,569
- You want to go?
- No, you go.

174
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:09,089
I got to gather my thoughts.

175
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,374
Hey, Boss?

176
00:09:12,848 --> 00:09:15,221
I think it's time
we filled the empty chair.

177
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:19,907
- You do?
- Yeah, we do.

178
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:22,026
It's the right time.
We got to get started on this.

179
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:24,369
Personnel files are starting
to stack up on your desk.

180
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:32,655
Okay.

181
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,658
You pick. After we get back.

182
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:38,410
First, got to narrow down prospective
agents. It's got to be a woman.

183
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:40,996
- Those are just the women.
- Are there photos in here?

184
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:44,320
Boss, really? Tony picks?
Because coming from anyone else,

185
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,210
that might be considered
a lapse in judgment.

186
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:48,259
Okay, you both pick.

187
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:51,642
- That makes much more sense.
- You don't trust me to be professional?

188
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:53,083
No casting couch.

189
00:09:57,021 --> 00:09:58,647
Petty Officer Kevin Wingate.

190
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:01,100
Disciplined for drug possession.
Low quantity.

191
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,269
- Personal use?
- What kind of discipline?

192
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:04,914
60 day restriction.

193
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:07,933
- He hasn't been off the boat?
- Not in two months.

194
00:10:07,993 --> 00:10:10,985
Well, he didn't get the dose on land,
he could have cooked it up himself.

195
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:12,672
Or someone brought it to him.

196
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:14,405
Shipmates thought he'd kicked.

197
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:17,309
- I guess he fell off.
- We do not guess, Timothy.

198
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,896
Nor do we assume, presume,

199
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:22,788
conjecture or prognosticate.

200
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:27,105
While not officially a member
of our field team,

201
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:31,463
Ducky is an essential element
in the investigative process.

202
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,800
<i>An encyclopedic mind
that never stops working.</i>

203
00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:38,095
<i>Sometimes his mind is connected
directly to his mouth.</i>

204
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:40,306
Dilated pupils,

205
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,975
profuse sweating.
His shirt's still damp.

206
00:10:43,556 --> 00:10:46,228
Brings to mind a classmate
of mine in medical school.

207
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:49,100
E. Landon Reginald

208
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,774
Ailsworth III.

209
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,610
- Nobody's named that.
- Except his father.

210
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,254
And his father's father.

211
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:57,549
Reggie concocted
his own amphetamines.

212
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:02,063
He liked to use the stuff to keep
himself awake while cramming for exams.

213
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:03,590
Ended up the final himself

214
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,332
when he passed out half an hour
before pencils down.

215
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,006
Reggie made it.

216
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,918
This fellow was not so fortunate.

217
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:10,836
Death...

218
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,629
about six hours ago.

219
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,935
McGee, finish sketching
an inventory of Wingate's locker.

220
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:18,761
DiNozzo, duty roster.

221
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:19,970
Prints, trace...

222
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,283
scour this ship.

223
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:24,558
So many tasks, so few hands.

224
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:28,686
Have either of you two
heard from Ziva?

225
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:30,781
No.

226
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:32,967
- You?
- No.

227
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,694
It's all so very sad.

228
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:39,530
But I supposed
the time comes to move on.

229
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:47,838
Thank you, pantsuit girl.

230
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,711
This is Claire Connell from the DEA.

231
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,763
Pleased to meet you,
Special Agent DiNozzo.

232
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,315
We don't really stand on formality here.
Why don't you have a seat.

233
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,889
Wowsers! That's some grip.

234
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,250
Yeah, I was a pack-a-day smoker.

235
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,227
Quit by occupying
my hands with power putty.

236
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:10,729
Look at that.

237
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:12,692
Demonstrates strong will.

238
00:12:12,842 --> 00:12:14,303
Excellent aptitude scores,

239
00:12:14,363 --> 00:12:16,443
high reviews from
her colleagues at the DEA.

240
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:17,621
I see that.

241
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,239
So why would you want
to leave then, Claire?

242
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,741
I was involved in a relationship
of a personal nature.

243
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:26,912
Became difficult for the other party
to control their emotions

244
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,539
in the workplace setting.

245
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,541
Yeah. Got to hate clingy guys.

246
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:34,169
- Clingy girls?
- He didn't ask.

247
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,047
- So don't tell.
- It was interfering

248
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:38,312
with my ability to perform
my duties at the highest level.

249
00:12:38,372 --> 00:12:39,849
Sure, sure.

250
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:42,359
You know those movies where
they have the really beautiful woman,

251
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,822
but they put her in the big glasses
and tie her hair back

252
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:47,307
and have her march around
in the big baggy clothes, but

253
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:50,046
then the turn comes,
the penny drops,

254
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:53,795
and the ugly duckling magically
transforms into a swan?

255
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:55,566
That won't be an issue.

256
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,205
I find that my looks...

257
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:01,092
have the tendency to prevent people
from taking me seriously.

258
00:13:01,762 --> 00:13:02,823
That's fantastic.

259
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,199
She has my vote.

260
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:06,405
- Really?
- Really.

261
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,287
All right, okay.

262
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:10,184
Let's start the on-the-job training.

263
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:12,291
Special Agent Gibbs
will make the final decision.

264
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:13,927
Let's go see him.

265
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,991
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

266
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:18,619
Right this way.

267
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:21,415
You know, it's all about chemistry,

268
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:24,143
the zing, the s... The pah!

269
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:25,975
What is "pah"?

270
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:28,303
Pah. You know?

271
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:30,659
Got to know how to zig when I zag.

272
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:33,955
Got to know how to bob when you weave,
rock when he rolls.

273
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,485
That's the pah of it all.

274
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:37,199
Pah!

275
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:39,437
She's unflappable.

276
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:41,101
She's unflappable.

277
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:47,559
Strike one.

278
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:53,222
Might be a little easier to find
a new drummer for spinal tap.

279
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:56,120
Ziva's not replaceable.

280
00:13:57,232 --> 00:13:58,124
The...

281
00:13:59,237 --> 00:14:00,319
the one you lost.

282
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:04,282
Then why aren't you looking for her?

283
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:07,370
If I could drag her back,

284
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,315
I'd do it in a heartbeat.

285
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:11,761
But that's impossible.

286
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,994
Ziva David is dead.

287
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:35,749
I've always been fascinated
by simple cause and effect reactions...

288
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:38,391
What can be done to the human body

289
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,226
just by adding or subtracting.

290
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:46,280
My own personal drug of choice
since my College days...

291
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,094
is caffeine.

292
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:50,419
Keeps me sharp,

293
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:52,391
alert.

294
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:01,562
You are probably feeling clarity,

295
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:04,409
an impulse to talk without censor.

296
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:08,308
It's a chemical process
taking place in your brain.

297
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:09,670
Now,

298
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:12,527
I understand your instinct
to resist, but

299
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:14,985
in actuality, you are speeding

300
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:17,210
the release of adrenaline,
which only serves

301
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,968
as a catalyst.

302
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:25,294
That's better.

303
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:27,821
It's less painful that way.

304
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:35,460
Who is in...

305
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:38,520
control of the flow of information?

306
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:43,470
Must be a lonely place to sit
at the top of the pyramid.

307
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:45,784
Not to mention...

308
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:48,890
wee bit uncomfortable.

309
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:53,595
<i>Leon Vance.</i>

310
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:56,340
<i>Some people don't like him,
some people don't trust him,</i>

311
00:15:57,032 --> 00:15:58,866
<i>wish someone else were in his place.</i>

312
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:01,908
<i>Show me someone who doesn't complain
about their boss,</i>

313
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,846
<i>they're either lying
or they're unemployed.</i>

314
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,265
Got an update on the meth ring?

315
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:10,529
Petty Officer Dimarco is recovering.

316
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,506
Question him today.

317
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,728
Hope he can shed some light,
at least on who put the knife in him.

318
00:16:16,134 --> 00:16:17,696
One set of prints, Leon.

319
00:16:18,974 --> 00:16:21,396
He was so out of his mind
that he stabbed himself?

320
00:16:23,226 --> 00:16:24,850
Been hitting a lot of dead ends.

321
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:26,693
Yeah, well, we've been one short.

322
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,439
How goes the search
for David's replacement?

323
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,251
DiNozzo's got a new candidate.
You heard anything about Ziva?

324
00:16:32,311 --> 00:16:33,116
No.

325
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,827
Two months in the dark now.

326
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:38,330
But Mossad tends to operate
behind a veil of secrecy.

327
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,457
You've confirmed
she's part of Mossad again?

328
00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:41,917
Yeah, I believe so.

329
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:44,127
- Field?
- Likely.

330
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,825
But you haven't heard anything?

331
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:50,572
You've got a good relationship
with Director David.

332
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:53,095
You figure the subject
of his daughter must have come up.

333
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:54,822
Man's got to have some feelings

334
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:56,556
about putting her back in the field.

335
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,299
Well, he must be sharing them
with somebody else if he does.

336
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:03,066
Eli's being tight-lipped about it.

337
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:09,584
Like you, Leon?

338
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:12,488
I don't have anything to share.

339
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,553
But you think he does.

340
00:17:14,884 --> 00:17:17,036
And I'm tap dancing
around the edges.

341
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:21,112
Yeah, I know how that goes.

342
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:25,544
Petty Officer,
I know that, physically,

343
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,818
you've been through quite an ordeal
these past few months.

344
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:31,190
We're hoping that you could tell us
where the drugs came from.

345
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:35,050
Well, I wouldn't know
what they look like, Sir.

346
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:36,894
I mean, I don't take drugs.

347
00:17:37,134 --> 00:17:39,224
Someone must have slipped them
in my orange juice.

348
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:41,395
Why would they do that?

349
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:43,478
Isn't that how you take them?

350
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:45,406
Where did you see that?

351
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,690
I think it was an episode of <i>90210</i>.

352
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,652
I never really liked that show.
Not my cup of tea.

353
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:55,865
So, how come agent McGee
is conducting the interrogation?

354
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:58,742
We prefer the word "interview".
"Interrogation"...

355
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,163
has a negative association.

356
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,208
Okay. Got it.
So what do they call these rooms?

357
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,335
Observation.

358
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:09,176
And the other side of the glass?

359
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,036
Not everything has a name.

360
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:14,968
I thought I heard
someone refer to it as interrogation.

361
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:18,049
Well, you know, maybe that's
some kind of informal shorthand.

362
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,030
- Really?
- Yeah.

363
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,894
Agent McGee's in there softening
the big guy up for the bigger guy.

364
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:25,348
Agent Gibbs is gonna crack him.

365
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:26,987
Crack him for what?

366
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,163
Buying the wrong hit of meth?

367
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,193
This guy doesn't know
anything about anything.

368
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,326
You expect him
to give up his dealer?

369
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,241
Let's see if you can figure it out.

370
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:40,785
Is this some sort of test?

371
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:43,092
You like tests?

372
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:45,808
Is that some sort of test?

373
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:48,877
No.

374
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:51,861
I mean, it's...
Everything's a test.

375
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,763
Excuse me, excuse me.

376
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,221
<i>Looks like they pulled up stakes.</i>

377
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:02,307
<i>Haven't been able to determine
where they resettled,</i>

378
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:03,855
<i> if they resettled.</i>

379
00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:05,644
- Captives?
<i>- Possibly.</i>

380
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:08,168
<i>NCIS confirmed
the presence of a woman...</i>

381
00:19:08,228 --> 00:19:10,715
<i>no ID and no idea whether or not
she's still with them.</i>

382
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,109
You're doing a bang-up job there,
Chad.

383
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,774
<i>I'm a long way from Dubai, Gibbs.</i>

384
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:19,782
<i>Our local network tends to rely
on nomads roaming the desert.</i>

385
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:21,676
<i>They don't tend
to like our faces much.</i>

386
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,745
<i>Though they'd respect mine
more than they'd yours.</i>

387
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,895
You think so, huh?

388
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,092
<i>One look at that baby-smooth skin and
they think they spotted another girl.</i>

389
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,586
Careful. Don't go getting all native
on me out there, Dunham.

390
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:35,126
Chad reporting from Chad.

391
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:39,386
Next up,
Captain Rebecca Becky Hastings,

392
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:40,989
US Air Force.

393
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,503
- Fighter jock.
- Yeah, grounded for medical.

394
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,059
Natural born thrill seeker.

395
00:19:46,655 --> 00:19:48,489
Likes to live on the edge,
take risks.

396
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:49,642
Pretty eyes.

397
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,857
Thinks NCIS might offer some...

398
00:19:52,202 --> 00:19:54,861
- new challenges. A real Daredevil.
- What do you think?

399
00:19:58,684 --> 00:19:59,597
Women.

400
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,537
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

401
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:07,722
So what was that about,

402
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:08,945
with Dunham?

403
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:14,083
Tracking terrorist training camps
in the Sahara desert.

404
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,773
And the woman you were talking about,
the captive,

405
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:20,808
any theory who she is?

406
00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:26,933
Dunham says that Mossad presence
has increased in North Africa.

407
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:29,227
Prepping an offensive?

408
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,950
Or course correction,
cleaning up a failure.

409
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:34,024
What kind of failure?

410
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,121
The kind with casualties.

411
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:38,278
Is that all you know?

412
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:43,171
That's all you can tell me.
I got it.

413
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:45,096
All right.

414
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:47,450
You know, in Arabic,
the word for "desert" is "Sahara"

415
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,765
so Sahara desert is
actually desert desert.

416
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:51,493
A lot of sand.

417
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:55,553
Duck pulled the plug
on my Dimarco interview.

418
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:56,887
Said the...

419
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:59,758
strain was too much
for his weakened heart.

420
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:01,544
Yeah.

421
00:21:03,787 --> 00:21:06,181
Gibbs signed off on the new girl...
Rebecca Hastings.

422
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:07,696
Seems like a pistol.

423
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,481
Or a firecracker.

424
00:21:09,713 --> 00:21:10,852
Maybe a spitfire.

425
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,665
I been thinking about buying
some tight red leather pants.

426
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:22,676
Something that really
cradles my butt.

427
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:25,356
- It's not normal.
- I'm kidding. I'm not gonna buy...

428
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,645
It's not normal
that we haven't heard from Ziva.

429
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,152
I mean, nothing!

430
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:31,406
Not in this much time.
It's not normal.

431
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:35,276
Well, maybe she just wants
to make a clean break of it.

432
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,664
Maybe from some of us
but not all of us.

433
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:39,798
Unless you did something to her
you're not telling me.

434
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:46,528
It's not normal.

435
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:51,543
- No, it's not.
- Thank you.

436
00:21:53,238 --> 00:21:55,233
What if she can't contact us, huh?

437
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,191
What if something's stopping her?

438
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,360
Or someone.

439
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:01,651
Yeah.

440
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,447
I'm not the only one
thinking this, am I?

441
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:07,330
- No.
- Gibbs is thinking about it, too...

442
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,953
He's not talking about it,
but he's definitely sniffing around.

443
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:12,831
- So what are you gonna do about it?
- Everything I can.

444
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:14,791
I'm gonna start digging.

445
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:16,668
Well, you can't do it alone.

446
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,878
You gonna stop me?

447
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:21,423
That's not what I said.

448
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:25,927
When he wakes up,

449
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,028
you will learn...

450
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,520
what a mistake your partner made...

451
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:32,350
following your lead.

452
00:22:47,121 --> 00:22:51,118
You believe I am responsible
for the death of this Ziva David.

453
00:22:51,976 --> 00:22:52,725
So,

454
00:22:53,477 --> 00:22:55,472
you travel halfway
around the world...

455
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,396
to kill me.

456
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,587
That is insane.

457
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
I'm insane?

458
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:05,800
You kill indiscriminately.

459
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,975
Wars are measured in body counts.

460
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:12,638
The news carries

461
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:14,021
a running tally.

462
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:16,061
You change...

463
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:19,284
the world... with rivers of blood.

464
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,515
There is no reason...

465
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:24,340
to kill just one person.

466
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:26,936
Sure there is.

467
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:31,595
How did you find me?

468
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:35,356
I'm skilled.

469
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:36,814
You did it...

470
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:38,732
by yourself?

471
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:41,216
Really?

472
00:23:41,276 --> 00:23:42,160
No.

473
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:43,797
Not really.

474
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:49,345
How did you find me?

475
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:54,206
Who are you leaving out?

476
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,890
I can't believe
you were gonna leave me out.

477
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,480
- It wasn't personal.
- Abby, it was for your own benefit.

478
00:24:02,456 --> 00:24:03,490
So which was it?

479
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:04,870
<i> Abby Sciuto,</i>

480
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,821
<i>NCIS resident
forensic scientist, heart and soul,</i>

481
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:10,453
<i>a paradox wrapped in an oxymoron,</i>

482
00:24:10,513 --> 00:24:13,484
<i>smothered in contradictions
in terms, sleeps in a coffin.</i>

483
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:16,444
<i>Really,
the happiest goth you'll ever meet.</i>

484
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:18,005
It was hubris, you know.

485
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:20,333
McGee thought he could do it
without you, and he was wrong,

486
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:21,987
- he was so wrong.
- No, no, no.

487
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:24,421
Abby, I was the one
that wanted to enlist your help.

488
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,035
Can we get past this?

489
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:27,860
Please.

490
00:24:28,142 --> 00:24:30,218
We've been tracking Ziva's movements
as best we can.

491
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:32,721
- Since when?
- Since she stayed in Israel.

492
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:35,263
And took Rivkin's place
on the Kidon unit.

493
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,809
I've been doing the same thing.

494
00:24:38,112 --> 00:24:40,687
I mean, it's weird
that Ziva hasn't contacted me.

495
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:43,189
It'd be one thing if she hadn't
picked up the phone and called me,

496
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:46,539
- but I've tried to reach her.
- Psychics, crystals or telepathy?

497
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,570
No jokes.

498
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:49,549
Okay?

499
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:51,239
Ziva is universally absent.

500
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,532
It's freaking me out.

501
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:54,742
All right, let's compare notes here.
We've got

502
00:24:54,903 --> 00:24:57,929
NCIS on the ground in Dubai trying
to figure out what Mossad is up to.

503
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:00,413
While Mossad's trying to figure out
what some terrorist is doing.

504
00:25:00,473 --> 00:25:02,667
And somewhere
in the middle of this is Ziva.

505
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,745
And we know
that Gibbs thinks the Director...

506
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:07,714
knows more than he's letting on.

507
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:09,413
And no one's telling us anything.

508
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:11,551
- So we have two options.
- And they're both illegal.

509
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,494
Hack into Mossad...

510
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,930
- Or hack into Vance.
- That's it.

511
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:19,168
I'm out of here.
I'm done.

512
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:21,802
- So much for the Daredevil.
- Forgot about her.

513
00:25:22,363 --> 00:25:23,916
Whatever.
Let's get hacking.

514
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,860
Yeah, Gibbs is in interrogation.
I'll take it.

515
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:31,070
Damocles.

516
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:32,822
Yeah, I know.
Like "the sword of".

517
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,699
Out of Aqaba.
Where is that, Jordan?

518
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,244
Nothing.

519
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,038
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to startle you.

520
00:25:40,328 --> 00:25:42,035
Are you Special Agent DiNozzo?

521
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,583
No, I am.

522
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:45,847
Who are you?

523
00:25:46,415 --> 00:25:47,754
I'm Officer Heather Kincaid.

524
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,631
I'm here about the job interview.

525
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,967
That you apparently forgot about.

526
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,170
No, I didn't.

527
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:56,493
I didn't forget.
I mean, you know...

528
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:57,722
Call you back.

529
00:25:58,915 --> 00:26:00,934
Heather Kincaid.
Let's see, Seattle PD,

530
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,490
- just like your father and your uncle.
- And two brothers.

531
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:05,772
Four-year varsity starter.
U-dub volleyball?

532
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:06,898
Go Huskies, yeah.

533
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,650
Listen, can you walk while you talk?

534
00:26:08,822 --> 00:26:10,783
You know, I've actually never
attempted something

535
00:26:10,843 --> 00:26:12,871
so complex before,
but I'm a quick learner.

536
00:26:13,128 --> 00:26:14,128
Sarcasm.

537
00:26:14,695 --> 00:26:15,712
I like sarcasm.

538
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:17,621
- Who doesn't?
- Not that much.

539
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:25,503
Like I told you last time
I was brought in, Sir,

540
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,591
someone must have slipped
the drugs to me.

541
00:26:29,928 --> 00:26:31,631
Lots of enemies on board?

542
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:33,299
No, Sir.

543
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,180
So, it's the opposite then.

544
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:36,970
Lots of friends.

545
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:38,039
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

546
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:41,079
I'm not sure what it is
you're looking for exactly, but...

547
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:43,685
- You're sure you're it?
- That's the pitch you've been getting?

548
00:26:44,297 --> 00:26:46,312
Yeah, everybody's
a perfect fit for this job.

549
00:26:46,477 --> 00:26:48,202
Sure. In this economy.

550
00:26:50,531 --> 00:26:52,184
Can't just drop someone in the mix.

551
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,987
It's a lot harder than it looks,
trust me.

552
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:56,020
I'm only asking for a shot.

553
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,557
I don't know if we need the help.

554
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,569
Frankly,
you got a pretty good gig already.

555
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:00,784
You don't need us.

556
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,477
It's not you, it's me.

557
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,985
Do you really want to do this?

558
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:09,182
It's ridiculous.

559
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,515
Look at this guy.
This guy...

560
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,528
who we've been babying and coddling

561
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:15,800
and nursing back to health
for the last 3 months.

562
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:18,553
The poor helpless drug victim
with the bad heart,

563
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:20,805
almost killed him.
He's the dealer!

564
00:27:20,984 --> 00:27:24,183
After the first overdose
of his own rotten stash,

565
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:25,977
this guy dosed himself

566
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:29,068
to draw suspicion away from the fact
that he's the pusher.

567
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:30,501
<i>We just wanted to get high.</i>

568
00:27:31,246 --> 00:27:33,443
<i>I didn't mean for Kevin
to end up dead.</i>

569
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,069
<i>You got to believe me.
I'm sorry.</i>

570
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,554
And two dead
before we figured it out.

571
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:41,003
Anyway, we're not hiring right now.
Sorry to waste your time.

572
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:53,963
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

573
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:55,941
It's the goat!

574
00:27:56,948 --> 00:27:58,801
- The goat.
- Sounds like you got something.

575
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,261
We're the two zuzim.

576
00:28:00,815 --> 00:28:03,991
Gibbs is our father,
and he used us to buy the goat.

577
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:06,167
- It all makes sense now.
- Sure.

578
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:10,197
We accessed Mossad's encrypted files.
They weren't in English,

579
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:12,857
so we had to do
a little rudimentary linguistics.

580
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,603
Hit the Hebrew school
nursery rhymes.

581
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:16,419
<i>Chad gadya</i>, Tony, <i>chad gadya</i>.

582
00:28:16,646 --> 00:28:19,697
"One little goat
that my father bought for two zuzim."

583
00:28:22,631 --> 00:28:25,111
It was originally
an Aramaic children's song.

584
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:28,790
Actually, way it goes, uh, there's
a part with god, an angel of death

585
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,003
"and the killing..."

586
00:28:30,063 --> 00:28:33,920
"That killed the butcher
that slew the ox"

587
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,214
"that drank the water
that quenched the fire"

588
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,508
"that burnt the stick
that beat the dog"

589
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:40,510
"that bit the cat that ate the goat"

590
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:43,304
"which my father bought
for two zuzim <i>chad gadya</i>..."

591
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,310
"<i>Chad gadya</i>."

592
00:28:51,248 --> 00:28:53,212
- So what's the goat?
- It's the information

593
00:28:53,272 --> 00:28:56,109
that McGee and I recovered from
the burnt laptop in Ziva's apartment.

594
00:28:56,429 --> 00:29:00,279
With the location of a camp in North
Africa run by a man named Saleem Ulman.

595
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:02,782
We gave it to Gibbs,
Gibbs gave it to Vance,

596
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,932
Vance gave it to Eli David,

597
00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:07,673
who read it,
and then he put Ziva and a team

598
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:09,747
on a Jordanian freighter
called the Damocles.

599
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:11,388
Out of Aqaba.

600
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:13,323
Yeah.

601
00:29:13,383 --> 00:29:15,795
- Bound for the Horn of Africa.
- You got a manifest?

602
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,423
It's a cargo ship.
Could be a direct supply line to Saleem.

603
00:29:19,896 --> 00:29:21,676
- Where is it now?
- Don't know.

604
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,278
- Find it.
- We tried. It's...

605
00:29:24,587 --> 00:29:26,183
No record of it appearing after may.

606
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:28,513
- Why not?
- 'Cause it was lost at sea.

607
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:31,686
Damocles went down in a storm,
28th of may.

608
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,247
Off the coast of Somalia.

609
00:29:39,683 --> 00:29:41,083
There were no survivors.

610
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,922
After that...

611
00:29:47,634 --> 00:29:49,704
business as usual lost all meaning.

612
00:29:50,345 --> 00:29:51,414
<i>Blah, blah, blah.</i>

613
00:29:51,676 --> 00:29:53,166
<i>Computer stuff, blah.</i>

614
00:29:55,046 --> 00:29:56,419
<i>Autopsy report.</i>

615
00:29:57,368 --> 00:29:58,087
<i>Words.</i>

616
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,630
<i>Just, there's so many words</i>

617
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,759
<i>and there's things
and stuff and emotions.</i>

618
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,469
<i>Thanks for listening.</i>

619
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,014
<i>Got a dead marine. Grab your gear.</i>

620
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,099
<i>Got a missing kid. Grab your gear.</i>

621
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,518
<i>Some idiot smuggled
a koala on a submarine.</i>

622
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,119
<i>Grab your gear. Grab your gear.</i>

623
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,189
<i>Grab your gear, your gear.</i>

624
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:18,276
No.

625
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:21,110
No.

626
00:30:32,735 --> 00:30:33,456
No?

627
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:36,473
We have an obligation.

628
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:40,338
Saleem Ulman's got to be stopped
before one more person dies.

629
00:30:42,992 --> 00:30:44,051
Make your case.

630
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:47,038
It's a supply chain.

631
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:48,749
Everything moving
through the area...

632
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:51,247
By ship, by truck,
by camel, by donkey.

633
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:54,852
Everything Saleem and his men need
to stay alive somewhere in the desert.

634
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,647
NCIS on the ground in Africa has tried
to track common elements.

635
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,567
Like weapons, medical supplies,
car parts, gasoline, food, drink.

636
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:04,786
We have zeroed in on items
of a more personal nature,

637
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:08,449
various batteries, electronics,
even music and entertainment.

638
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,352
Because they are human, after all.

639
00:31:10,711 --> 00:31:13,329
This is the manifest
from the lost cargo ship Damocles.

640
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,873
We know it was heading
for Saleem's camp,

641
00:31:16,228 --> 00:31:18,543
and it contains the cipher
to breaking our code.

642
00:31:19,238 --> 00:31:21,167
- And have you?
- We believe we have.

643
00:31:22,126 --> 00:31:24,340
We've isolated
the needle in the haystack...

644
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:28,357
An anomaly,
one specific characteristic.

645
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:32,558
A brand-name foreign import not
easily available in Europe or Africa.

646
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:36,602
Got it all the way from the United
States at high cost, high difficulty.

647
00:31:36,998 --> 00:31:38,271
What are we talking about?

648
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:42,336
Ta-da.

649
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:51,780
You had to have your Caf-pow,

650
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:53,632
didn't you?

651
00:31:54,405 --> 00:31:56,873
It's just a little chemical addiction,
don't worry.

652
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,292
Maybe you picked that up
at your American college!

653
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:03,601
Maybe we're not so bad!
You ought to rethink your master plan!

654
00:32:05,914 --> 00:32:07,689
You okay, McGee? You awake?

655
00:32:09,022 --> 00:32:10,595
Yeah. When do we move?

656
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:11,971
Not yet.

657
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:15,975
- He's rattled. It may be our best shot.
- No yet.

658
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:18,561
Wait for my cue.

659
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:24,233
Questions are being asked in town
about missing NCIS agents,

660
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:27,445
concern that U.S. Forces
might mobilize.

661
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:29,572
One of you will tell me
the identities

662
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,980
and locations
of all the operatives in the area

663
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:34,368
and the other one... will die.

664
00:32:39,303 --> 00:32:41,453
I'll give you a moment
to decide who lives.

665
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:54,741
How was your summer?

666
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:11,828
Out of everyone in the world
who could have found me,

667
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:13,945
it had to be you.

668
00:33:17,424 --> 00:33:18,482
You're welcome.

669
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,960
So, are you glad to see me?

670
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:25,206
You should not have come.

671
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,879
All right then.

672
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,440
Good catching up.

673
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,590
I'll be going now.

674
00:33:33,836 --> 00:33:35,168
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

675
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:38,221
Taken prisoner.

676
00:33:40,326 --> 00:33:41,947
Are you all right, McGee?

677
00:33:43,928 --> 00:33:45,840
I'm just glad you're alive.

678
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:50,861
You thought I was dead.

679
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:53,632
Oh, yeah.

680
00:33:56,865 --> 00:33:58,244
Then why are you here?

681
00:34:00,654 --> 00:34:02,788
- McGee didn't think you were dead.
- Tony.

682
00:34:03,812 --> 00:34:05,639
Why are you here?

683
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,830
Couldn't live without you, I guess.

684
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,312
So you will die with me.

685
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,350
You should have left me alone.

686
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:23,599
Okay, tried, couldn't.

687
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:27,022
Listen, you should know I've taken
some kind of truth serum, cause any...

688
00:34:27,534 --> 00:34:30,109
questions that you don't want
to know the answer to...

689
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:32,122
I did not ask for anyone

690
00:34:32,515 --> 00:34:34,504
to put themselves
in harm's way for me.

691
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,155
I do not deserve it.

692
00:34:37,978 --> 00:34:41,341
So what are you doing out here,
some kind of monastic experience?

693
00:34:41,648 --> 00:34:42,757
Doing penance?

694
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,263
It is justified.

695
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:48,877
Get over yourself.

696
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:51,404
I have.

697
00:34:53,983 --> 00:34:56,304
Now you tell Saleem
everything he wants to hear.

698
00:34:56,953 --> 00:34:58,703
And you try to save yourselves.

699
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:01,390
I am ready to die.

700
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:04,226
That's not how it works.

701
00:35:05,613 --> 00:35:07,354
How what works?

702
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:09,096
The plan.

703
00:35:10,202 --> 00:35:11,756
You have an escape plan?

704
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:18,304
They have 30 men,

705
00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:19,977
heavily armed.

706
00:35:20,628 --> 00:35:23,974
They have antitank,
antiaircraft weapons.

707
00:35:25,222 --> 00:35:26,468
What do you have?

708
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:30,762
Well, that's where things
get a little tricky.

709
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,666
- You don't have it.
- What do you mean?

710
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:36,509
That satellite photo's showing
thermal activity at this location.

711
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:39,721
We have 4x4s coming and going.
How much longer

712
00:35:39,781 --> 00:35:42,515
this guy's going to be there.
We served this up on a silver platter.

713
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,225
You don't know he's there at all.

714
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:47,757
We're not talking about kicking in
a door and dragging a guy out in cuffs.

715
00:35:47,817 --> 00:35:50,231
It's a military mission
on foreign soil.

716
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,442
- And he's a target of interest.
- And he's our only interest.

717
00:35:54,202 --> 00:35:56,975
Now I've talked with the joint chiefs,
I've talked with Mossad.

718
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:59,239
The hard truth is that we're not going
to send a seal team

719
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:01,408
into the desert, based on a theory

720
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,972
that Saleem Ulman can't live
without his daily Caf-pow!

721
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,245
Director...

722
00:36:06,305 --> 00:36:08,999
We need confirmation that he's there.
We don't have it.

723
00:36:10,664 --> 00:36:13,751
Under the present circumstances,
we just can't do it.

724
00:36:15,793 --> 00:36:17,825
I wish the circumstances
were different.

725
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:21,095
So do I.

726
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:34,898
What?

727
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:38,382
Is that it?

728
00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:40,396
Yeah, what else is there?

729
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,327
Maybe we send
a couple of agents to the region.

730
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,743
What for?

731
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:50,509
Gather some intel.

732
00:36:51,915 --> 00:36:53,895
You know,
put some eyes on the target.

733
00:36:55,377 --> 00:36:57,110
Change the circumstances.

734
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,525
Change... circumstances?

735
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:02,908
And you can sell that to Vance?

736
00:37:03,774 --> 00:37:06,266
Oh, yeah. Strictly investigatively.

737
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:08,642
- Of course.
- Of course.

738
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:12,139
You guys have a whole little thing
going on I'm not seeing, but I get it.

739
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,754
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge,
Bob's your uncle. I'm hip. I dig it.

740
00:37:14,814 --> 00:37:17,090
- Good, 'cause I need volunteers.
- I volunteer myself

741
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,744
and special agent McGee for the secret
fact-finding mission thingy,

742
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,134
that's not secret, in the Sahara.
What are you going to do?

743
00:37:22,194 --> 00:37:23,447
You don't want to know.

744
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,615
Good talk.

745
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:33,717
Thanks for volunteering me.

746
00:37:33,777 --> 00:37:35,794
Come on,
you always said you wanted to travel.

747
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:37,212
On my own time.

748
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,027
On your own dime?

749
00:37:39,087 --> 00:37:41,175
Are you crazy?
We could never afford this.

750
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:47,207
That does it
for quadrant whiskey four.

751
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,522
- There's no sighting.
- I'm going to call it in.

752
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,531
Hello, gentlemen. Hi there.
We come in peace.

753
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,781
Say the thing.

754
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,840
Say the other thing!

755
00:38:20,328 --> 00:38:21,147
Wait...

756
00:38:21,744 --> 00:38:24,593
you got captured... on purpose?

757
00:38:25,438 --> 00:38:26,331
Yeah.

758
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,765
- These men are killers, Tony.
- I know.

759
00:38:30,772 --> 00:38:33,936
That's why we have to stay alive
long enough to not get dead.

760
00:38:34,316 --> 00:38:36,313
That would involve being rescued.

761
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:38,078
Yes, it would.

762
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,612
How long will it take?

763
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:42,524
I don't know.

764
00:38:42,878 --> 00:38:45,781
- How long do you think I'm talking?
- What's the plan?

765
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,940
We fail to contact Dubai,
word gets to the carrier group

766
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,459
in the med
and they scramble F-22 raptors

767
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,514
that burn sand into glass.

768
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,805
How long that's gonna take,
I don't know.

769
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:03,683
Hours or...

770
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:06,090
days.

771
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:11,640
Can you fight?

772
00:39:15,725 --> 00:39:17,479
Hey, Saleem. What's up, man?

773
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:19,106
What's the commotion?

774
00:39:19,546 --> 00:39:20,607
We're moving out.

775
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:23,402
Good. I was getting tired
of this place.

776
00:39:23,698 --> 00:39:25,154
We're not taking prisoners.

777
00:39:27,154 --> 00:39:30,722
- Okay, it was nice talking with you.
- No, we're not done yet.

778
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:34,079
If they do not check in,
their people will come looking for them.

779
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,905
- Ziva, shut up.
- Kill me.

780
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:38,167
You'll need
the Americans for leverage.

781
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:40,443
I don't make bargains.

782
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,546
- Do you make pizza?
- What?

783
00:39:46,304 --> 00:39:47,303
Stop! Stop!

784
00:39:47,644 --> 00:39:49,505
There's something
I haven't told you yet.

785
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:52,127
- And what is that?
- Well...

786
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:56,727
I told you about the brains,
I told you about the guts,

787
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,220
I told you about the muscle,

788
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,439
the scientist,
the politician, the leader.

789
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,033
I told you about every member
of the team...

790
00:40:03,255 --> 00:40:04,365
except myself.

791
00:40:05,065 --> 00:40:07,404
- The part I play.
- Which is?

792
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:10,846
I'm the wild card.

793
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:14,570
I'm the guy who looks at the reality in
front of him and refuses to accept it.

794
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,241
Right now I should be terrified, right?
But I'm not.

795
00:40:17,301 --> 00:40:19,750
'cause I just can't stop thinking
about the movie <i>True Lies</i>,

796
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,508
where Arnie's strapped to the chair
and shot full of truth serum,

797
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,880
then he picks his cuffs
and kills everybody.

798
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:28,384
You have 30 second to live, Saleem.

799
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,198
You're still bound.

800
00:40:34,837 --> 00:40:35,912
You're lying.

801
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,414
I can't lie.

802
00:40:38,956 --> 00:40:41,184
And I didn't say I was gonna be
the one to kill you.

803
00:40:41,244 --> 00:40:43,273
Remember when I told you
my boss was a sniper?

804
00:40:54,094 --> 00:40:54,910
Go.

805
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,413
<i>Man all assault teams move out!
Get me contact!</i>

806
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,267
Okay.

807
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,460
Look out!

808
00:41:05,061 --> 00:41:05,915
Come on.

809
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,161
Here we go.

810
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,801
Come on. All right. Here we go.

811
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:38,591
Let's go home.

812
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:55,971
Just another day at the office.

813
