You tired?

00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,898
{\pos(192,220)}You can't catch me!

4
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:14,125
{\pos(192,220)}You're not getting away!

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:16,973
Give up, I got you!

6
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:17,892
Do not!

7
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,824
- You're done.
- Am not!

8
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,108
Here I come!

9
00:00:25,499 --> 00:00:26,817
Tag, you're it!

10
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:29,327
What's that?

11
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,863
It's a scarecrow, stupid.
Now, come on, you're it.

12
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:34,450
Wait, that.

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,706
Let's just get out of here.

14
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:56,222
Run, run!

{\pos(192,210)}You're not taking the elevator.

20
00:01:34,663 --> 00:01:35,896
{\pos(192,210)}Nope, took the stairs.

21
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,013
{\pos(192,210)}It's all about the cardio
these days.

22
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,225
{\pos(192,230)}You have been looking increasingly
Kate Moss-ish there, McTim.

23
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,018
{\pos(192,230)}What are you down...
Two, three pounds?

24
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,658
{\pos(192,230)}15 pounds, actually,
and thank you for noticing.

25
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,774
{\pos(192,230)}Well, that's what I do for a living.
Eagle-eyed Special Agent.

{\pos(192,230)}- Girl?
- No girl.

27
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:52,737
Come on{\, McGee}.

28
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:55,604
{\pos(192,230)}Nobody gives up the pizza
and the donuts without a good reason.

29
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,452
{\pos(192,210)}{\All right, }You want the truth? I usually gain
a few pounds during the holidays,

30
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,451
so, this year,
I thought I would counter it.

31
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:04,260
{\pos(192,210)}Well, you can resume your diet

32
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,375
{\pos(192,210)}after Thanksgiving, Timothy.

33
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,796
{\pos(192,210)}The traditional Mallard table
is not for anyone

34
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,736
{\pos(192,210)}whose body isn't
into bountiful good cheer.

35
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:18,261
{\pos(192,210)}"A Thanksgiving supper
at Mallard manor."

36
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:20,135
{\pos(192,210)}"All the fixin's."

37
00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:23,619
{\pos(192,210)}I think you misspelled "fixings".

38
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:26,996
{\pos(192,210)}Ducky, Thanksgiving is in two days.

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,997
{\pos(192,210)}Yeah, well, I'm aware of that.

40
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,524
{\pos(192,210)}{\I a}Already {\have }plans with {\I'm gonna see }my sister.

41
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:32,067
Well, bring her with you.

42
00:02:32,638 --> 00:02:34,945
{\pos(192,210)}I also have accepted an invitation

43
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,198
for Thanksgiving... a neighbor.

44
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:40,828
{\pos(192,210)}Oh, dear,
and Mr. Palmer is already out of town.

45
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,412
I also have plans.

46
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:47,474
{\pos(192,210)}Are you letting some blonde
bombshell baste your bird, Tony?

47
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,753
{\pos(192,210)}No, this bird's flying solo
to a poker tournament

48
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:52,847
{\pos(192,190)}at the big bend Indian casino.

49
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:54,718
{\pos(192,190)}They've got
an all-you-can-eat crab buffet.

50
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:57,218
{\pos(192,190)}Pilgrims and Indians
gambling together that warms the heart.

51
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,305
{\pos(192,210)}What about your mother, Ducky?

52
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:01,514
{\pos(192,210)}Mother is comfortable, thank you.

53
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,784
The staff take good care of her.

54
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:07,812
{\pos(192,210)}Poor dear.
She barely recognizes me when I visit.

55
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:09,355
{\Well }Then,

56
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:11,482
that leaves me with a 20-pound bird

57
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,063
{\pos(192,210)}and enough trimmings
to feed Coxey's army.

58
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:17,029
{\pos(192,210)}Not army... Marines.
Got a dead one in a cornfield.

59
00:03:17,952 --> 00:03:19,532
What, you waiting for an invitation?

60
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:21,075
Yes,

61
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:22,368
here's yours.

62
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:23,844
Thanksgiving.

63
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,664
Here's yours.

64
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,440
{\pos(192,210)}Cornfield.

65
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:29,881
{\pos(192,210)}Let's go!

66
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:31,921
Maybe I'm amazed.

67
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:33,840
A maze of maize.

68
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:34,884
What?

69
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,334
Maize...
it's the Indian word for corn.

70
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:39,467
The Indian word for corn is "makki".

71
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,790
Not Indians from India,
Indians from, you know, here.

72
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:45,454
If they were Indians from here,
they would be called American Indians,

73
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:46,314
you dork.

74
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:49,186
No, they'd be called native Americans,
Miss Citizenship Test.

75
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:53,440
Process this.

76
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:58,362
Several sets of footprints,
some of them very small.

77
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:00,547
A couple kids found him.

78
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:03,440
These aren't kids' footprints.

79
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:06,912
Over here, those are big ones.
Come from that direction.

80
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:08,873
Drag marks,

81
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:10,315
which means that...

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,885
when they pulled our Marine,
he was dead already.

83
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,796
Fresh corn.
That gives me an idea.

84
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,048
Why don't we have corn chowder

85
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,374
as our first course?

86
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:20,437
Poker.

87
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:21,567
Sister.

88
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:23,661
Neighbors.

89
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:26,240
Later.

90
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:28,975
Based on the viscosity
of the blood...

91
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,969
I'd say this is a recent demise.

92
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:36,805
My instinct tells me
he was not shot here.

93
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:39,862
This is Marine Lance Corporal
Trevor Lozada,

94
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,595
stationed out of Quantico, Boss.

95
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:43,580
The Corporal is missing a hand.

96
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,868
He was killed prior
to it being removed.

97
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:48,662
Otherwise the blood pooling
would be much greater.

98
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:51,066
Maybe the crows carried it off.

99
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:57,504
Sorry, I had to do it.

100
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:01,258
- Sorry, Boss.
- Time of death...

101
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,959
eight to ten hours ago,
between 3:00 and 5:00.

102
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:06,365
PCs...

103
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,697
Local gang,
big up and down the East coast.

104
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:09,934
{\Of course, }You already know that.

105
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:12,372
Maybe this is some sort
of initiation thing{\, you know}?

106
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:14,660
Kill a Marine and you're in,
no questions asked.

107
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:17,441
Lance Corporal Lozada was
a gang member before

108
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,647
he joined the Marines.
His tat was lasered off.

109
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:21,759
Why would somebody shoot him,
bring him out here,

110
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:23,405
carve him up, and cut off his hand?

111
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,607
- Get on DiNozzo's shoulders.
- Boss?

112
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,512
I would rather not.

113
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:34,208
Bend over, Tony.

114
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:35,376
Boss...

115
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,127
Come on, Tony, use those quads.

116
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,008
Oh, God, Boss.

117
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,010
West.

118
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,222
- Turn this way.
- Okay

119
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:49,765
Police cars.

120
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:50,792
North.

121
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:53,268
A farmer on a tractor.

122
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,144
East.

123
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:57,731
Barn...

124
00:05:58,122 --> 00:05:59,400
200 yards away.

125
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:01,924
I got a cramp in my neck.
I got a cramp.

126
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,787
I don't think
they meant to hide him.

127
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:06,584
I mean,
this place is not exactly isolated.

128
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,610
So, whoever put this body here...

129
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:10,694
wanted him found.

130
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,173
Marine Lance Corporal Trevor Lozada

131
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:25,634
had a spotless service record,
multiple tours.

132
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:28,747
{\pos(192,220)}Rewarded
with a very desirable duty post

133
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:32,266
{\pos(192,220)}guarding the Sattler Institute
for Strategic Studies and Analysis.

134
00:06:32,507 --> 00:06:33,976
{\pos(192,220)}R&D, government think tank.

135
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:36,853
{\pos(192,220)}Naval war College
and Marine intel units use them.

136
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,432
Lance Corporal Lozada had been there
about six months.

137
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,775
I'm gonna call them{\Sattler Institute},
{\let 'em know}to tell we're heading over.

138
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,360
Current address on Lozada.

139
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,571
McGee,
you and Ziva check out Lozada.

140
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:47,823
- DiNozzo, you're with me.
- Sattler Institute?

141
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,576
Boss, shouldn't McSmarty-pants
go to the nerd theme park?

142
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:55,414
I mean, it's got to be a nerd's paradise
with the <i>World of Warcraft</i> wallpaper and

143
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,461
the pocket protectors
and the elfin-shaped beds.

144
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:59,789
'Cause I probably shouldn't...
I'll get the car.

145
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:05,295
Hi. NCIS.
Special Agents Gibbs and DiNozzo.

146
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,513
Krista Dalton, facilities coordinator.
I spoke with someone on the phone.

147
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:12,470
Something happened
to Lance Corporal Lozada?

148
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,975
{\He Was}Found dead this morning
about 20 miles from here.

149
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,643
Oh, my god.

150
00:07:17,085 --> 00:07:19,229
- How did it happen?
- Not very nicely, Krista.

151
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:22,438
What did Lance Corporal Lozada
guard around here?

152
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:24,374
I'll show you.

153
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,280
Here.

154
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:26,904
This way.

155
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,752
- He guarded a day care center?
- This isn't a day care.

156
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:35,012
This is
our intelligence testing center.

157
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:37,394
You test the intelligence
of these kids?

158
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:38,999
No, they test ours.

159
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:41,418
Hey, Parker, how's it going?

160
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:47,287
Parker's specialty is the redeployment
of rapid response groups.

161
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:50,018
I thought we had people
at the Pentagon who do that.

162
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:50,969
We do.

163
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,181
But we've found that gifted children
have a less linear,

164
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,350
less bureaucratic way
of approaching things...

165
00:07:56,738 --> 00:07:58,184
Simpler, cleaner,

166
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,708
purer.

167
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:03,597
Where are their parents?

168
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,400
We have an arrangement
with the families.

169
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,611
The kids visit us
for a week or two at a time.

170
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:11,115
Helps maintain
a nice balance between

171
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:13,283
home and here
and keep the kids focused.

172
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:16,695
I guess it's fun.

173
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:18,622
These are just puzzles
and games to them.

174
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:22,543
So you're telling me
Lance Corporal Lozada was...

175
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:24,537
a babysitter, basically.

176
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:26,120
No, a bodyguard.

177
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,925
These kids are incredibly valuable
to us and the military.

178
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:32,508
Hey, when do I get
my mp3 player back?

179
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:35,347
When you stop wrapping the cord
around the ceiling fan, Brett.

180
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:38,895
I was testing my aerodynamic theory
of glide ratio versus inverted torque.

181
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,853
- What are you looking at?
- Val Kilmer, real genius.

182
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,023
{\Brett, }You like to break things,
which is why

183
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,993
you wrapped the cord
around the ceiling fan.

184
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:49,953
You will get your mp3 player back
after Thanksgiving.

185
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:51,813
Okay, whatever.

186
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,275
Brett's one of our prized students

187
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,552
as well as one of the oldest.

188
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,789
Yeah, he's a real smarty-pants.
Lucky you.

189
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:02,295
Any of these kids
personally close to Lozada?

190
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,043
One... Angela Kelp.

191
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:08,192
Angela had been acting
distracted lately,

192
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:10,872
so I asked Lance Corporal Lozada
to keep an eye on her.

193
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:12,313
They hit it off.

194
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,850
- She around here somewhere?
- Yes, this way.

195
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:18,686
Sorry, Boss.

196
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:23,058
<i>Get us out of here! Drive!</i>

197
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:25,075
- I'm ready, Mr. Norvell.
- What do you see?

198
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:26,648
Mistakes.

199
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:29,795
- Would you care to elaborate?
- First, the sun.

200
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:33,155
It's almost 30 degrees,
directly into our troops' eyes,

201
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:35,866
blinding them while concealing
the bad guys on the rooftop.

202
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:37,162
Go on.

203
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:39,828
They should never have been in an open
exposed area like this plaza.

204
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:43,226
It gives the enemy gunners a clear,
unobstructed angle of fire.

205
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,143
Yeah,

206
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:47,053
but they were headed
to rescue a unit under attack.

207
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,074
{\Yes. }That's why they took
the most direct route.

208
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:51,048
{\What }They should have {\done was }taken
a less direct route

209
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:54,134
on narrower streets
with more vertical protection,

210
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,677
taller buildings.

211
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:57,916
Would have saved a lot of lives.

212
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,772
Impressive.

213
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:09,733
The art, I mean.

214
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:11,408
Thanks.

215
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:14,179
- That's my cat back home.
- What's its name?

216
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,214
Kimba.

217
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:17,950
Lives with me and my mom.

218
00:10:18,554 --> 00:10:19,576
What about dad?

219
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,595
Split when I was little.

220
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,455
Kimba's good at taking out Taliban.

221
00:10:23,987 --> 00:10:25,582
You should see
what she does to mice.

222
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:27,793
Agent Gibbs, NCIS,

223
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,024
this is Gregg Norvell,
our director of youth programs.

224
00:10:31,605 --> 00:10:33,861
Whatever you need,
don't hesitate to ask.

225
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:36,426
- Thanks.
- Something happened, didn't it?

226
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:39,989
- What do you mean?
- To Lance Corporal Lozada.

227
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:42,432
Something happened to him, right?

228
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:47,104
Is there someplace {\the two of us}we could go talk?

229
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:49,687
Yeah, your room.

230
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,655
If you'd like to follow us...

231
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,408
I had a combined
S.A.T. score of 950.

232
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:02,327
Is that good?

233
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:06,511
Do you want a cupcake?
I made them.

234
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:12,372
Thanks.

235
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:21,109
So,

236
00:11:22,426 --> 00:11:25,100
what makes you think something
happened to Lance Corporal Lozada?

237
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:28,039
Well, you're here, he's not.

238
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:32,751
You want to talk to me because
Trevor and I were friends, right?

239
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,123
Did somebody...

240
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:40,866
kill him?

241
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,118
Why would you ask that?

242
00:11:44,993 --> 00:11:47,205
Because people emote more sympathy
when it's an accident.

243
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:49,708
You're searching.

244
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,820
Curious.

245
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:58,091
Do you know that a Marine
returning home from active duty

246
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:01,890
has a 38 % greater chance of being hurt
or killed than when he's deployed?

247
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:07,197
Did you make these?

248
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,204
- They're good.
- Thanks.

249
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:15,214
Krista says it's important
for me to express myself.

250
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:16,818
Yeah, I think she's right.

251
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:21,995
Just like it's important that,
if you know anything about Trevor,

252
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,017
you should call me.

253
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:31,458
Where?

254
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,623
Yeah, I'll be right there.

255
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:40,717
Thanks.

256
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,604
LEOs matched the car's registration
to Lozada.

257
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:56,950
- {\What's the }Distance from the crime scene?
- About, six miles.

258
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,296
Didn't find anything in his apartment,
but you were right.

259
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,531
He was a member
of a local gang, PCs.

260
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:07,194
Look at that.

261
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:09,968
There's one of the slugs
we didn't find in the Lance Corporal.

262
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:12,332
I patched into his on board
mapset program.

263
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,417
This was his route to
and from Sattler Institute every day.

264
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,918
And based on the time of death,
Lozada must have just left work.

265
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:23,160
Someone nicked the fuel line.
Clean cut.

266
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:25,887
Followed him till his tank ran dry,
pulled up and ambushed him?

267
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,334
Took him to the cornfield.

268
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,612
Yep, it's Lozada's.

269
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:40,193
Six incoming calls.

270
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,320
All listed to the same number.

271
00:13:42,577 --> 00:13:44,531
- Billed to the same address.
- Go.

272
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:46,518
Find our missing caller.

273
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:48,792
Got it. On it.

274
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:57,325
So, you brought me in here
for making phone calls to a friend?

275
00:13:57,606 --> 00:14:01,131
No, Eddie, because you
and Lance Corporal Lozada were <i>esses</i>.

276
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,048
The file here says that,

277
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:07,104
he broke off his gang ties years ago.
Clearly, you haven't.

278
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,034
We had our disagreements,
but me and Trev were like brothers.

279
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,683
Brothers? Really?

280
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:14,099
Metro gang division says that,

281
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:17,606
you tried to kill your brother
a few years ago, when he left the PCs.

282
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:18,814
No.

283
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:21,675
People felt betrayed,
but we worked it out.

284
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:23,341
You worked it out.

285
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,847
That doesn't smell so good to me.
Call me <i>Jaded</i>.

286
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:29,715
Lozada took an oath.
He broke it.

287
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:31,642
It pissed you off.
Admit it.

288
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:34,122
If I wanted to kill him back then,
I would have.

289
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:37,334
Look, me and Trevor grew up together,
and he burned me, so...

290
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,375
- So, it's a grudge.
- No, we just

291
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:40,920
had some unsettled business.

292
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:43,525
- Like what?
- Like you don't need to know about.

293
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:47,284
Eddie...

294
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,855
you are a real cool customer,
aren't you?

295
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:53,352
Got to give you a hand.

296
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,362
Speaking of hands...

297
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,355
why'd you cut Trevor's off?

298
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:00,274
Carve "PC" into his arm?

299
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,618
That's a nice touch, Zorro.

300
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:06,705
It's kind of like putting up a billboard
that says, "don't mess with the PCs",

301
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,033
and Eddie Castillo...

302
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:09,908
he's not afraid of anyone,

303
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,952
- including the Marines.
- I didn't do that.

304
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:14,162
You got an alibi for last night?

305
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:16,052
- "Lullaby."
- Alibi.

306
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,636
It's an after-hours club
for rich kids.

307
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,961
We handle the... refreshments there.

308
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:22,170
Really?

309
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:25,507
Well, we'll see about that.
In the meantime,

310
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:28,552
I hope you like being swabbed,
poked and pricked.

311
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:29,688
Why?

312
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:31,740
'Cause we're checking you
for gunshot residue,

313
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,765
blood and dirt from the crime scene.

314
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,874
Anything I can think of.
You know why?

315
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,769
'Cause you're messing
with my holidays.

316
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,488
And I don't like it when people mess
with my Thanksgiving.

317
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,984
You're going to want to see this.

318
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:47,946
According to security sensors,
Lance Corporal Lozada

319
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:50,159
entered the dorm wing
this morning at 6:00 a.m.

320
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:51,904
That is impossible.
He was dead.

321
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:52,951
Exactly.

322
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:56,496
Dorm access requires
a palm scan, Boss.

323
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:59,723
Well, that clears up one mystery.
Someone needed his hand.

324
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:01,712
Yeah, but here's the strange part.

325
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,521
That's Angela's room.

326
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:08,623
They take anything?

327
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:11,600
Figure walked out less
than a minute later.

328
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:13,805
All he or she was carrying
was Lozada's hand.

329
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,804
All they did was
visit Angela's room.

330
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:17,678
- Then they left.
- Empty-handed.

331
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,372
Angela, you didn't see
anybody in your room this morning?

332
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:30,415
{\pos(192,220)}No.

333
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,157
{\pos(192,220)} But I was asleep.

334
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,749
{\pos(192,220)}Nothing missing?

335
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:43,877
Two of my collages are gone.

336
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:50,062
Anything special about them?

337
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:53,460
Just collages.

338
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,971
Stuff, art.

339
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,976
Hey, would you mind
if I borrowed this?

340
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,825
So, you know that your mom knows
you're coming with us

341
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:18,244
and that you're safe, right?

342
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:22,620
Sure you didn't see anything?

343
00:17:23,652 --> 00:17:24,709
Positive.

344
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,906
Okay.
Let's go.

345
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,099
Hang on a minute.
This is important.

346
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:41,559
It's my great aunt's cranberry
sauce recipe. I lost it,

347
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,104
so I'm trying to duplicate it
before Ducky's Thanksgiving dinner.

348
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:46,481
I don't want to let Ducky's turkey down,
you know?

349
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:51,215
Today.

350
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:54,916
What can I do for you, Gibblet?
It's kind of a seasonal play on your...

351
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:57,260
- I'm ready, Sir.
- Turn this into pictures.

352
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:00,755
Thought you were going
to give me something hard.

353
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,222
So what are you bringing
to Ducky's dinner?

354
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:09,421
- Not sure I'm going.
- What do you mean, {\you're }not going?

355
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,215
Who's going to carve the turkey?
Who's going to watch the game with me?

356
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:14,304
Who's going to eat too much pie?

357
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:16,553
The photos.

358
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:20,051
What am I looking for?

359
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:21,766
Girl's room.

360
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:23,313
Panning shot.

361
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:29,315
She listens to "H Is Orange".
What a cool little chick.

362
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,113
<i>This is how geeks recreate.</i>

363
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,281
<i>Exhibit A.</i>

364
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:36,330
She's so cute.

365
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,284
All right, stop it there.

366
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:47,886
Okay, blow up that one and that one.

367
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:50,994
Those are cool. What are they?

368
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,912
- That's what you're gonna tell me.
- Well, what am I looking for?

369
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,010
I have...
absolutely no idea.

370
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,807
So it is hard.

371
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,559
More sugar.

372
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:12,264
You know
that little bakery near you?

373
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:16,228
I'd appreciate it if you could bring
a dozen of their dinner rolls.

374
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:18,907
- Got a confirmation of death, Duck?
- Gunshot wound to the head.

375
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:23,815
Well, what I presume is
the kill shot entered his head here,

376
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,239
just behind his right ear,
traveled in an upward direction.

377
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:29,083
I was just about to find out
what damage it caused.

378
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:31,085
- Before he was posted?
- Yes.

379
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:35,369
Clearly, the killer's intention was
to leave some sort of macabre message.

380
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:39,021
Yeah, and not too shy about
indicating who was sending it.

381
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,755
Easy autograph to forge.

382
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,837
I need a psych evaluation
on a 12-year-old girl.

383
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:49,066
Where do you go, Jethro?

384
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,194
What?

385
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:54,067
Over the past nine Thanksgivings,
I've called your house.

386
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,355
You're never home.

387
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,278
Sometimes I even drive by.

388
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,108
So, I shall expect you
promptly 1600 hours.

389
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:05,258
That reminds me...

390
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,872
I mustn't go home without him.

391
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,622
Avoid sourdough rolls if you can.

392
00:20:10,804 --> 00:20:13,252
Their flavor clashes
with my salad dressing.

393
00:20:13,403 --> 00:20:15,232
White bread is okay,

394
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,882
but whole wheat would be preferable.

395
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:25,125
Oh, dear.

396
00:20:28,082 --> 00:20:28,893
Thanks.

397
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,979
Can I get you something to drink,
Mrs. McKinna?

398
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:36,818
- You remembered, Agent Gibbs.
- Well, you're memorable, D'Arcy.

399
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:39,469
Holiday plans, Mrs. McKinna?

400
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,514
I'm sending a shopping list
to my husband, as we speak.

401
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:46,157
- Are you cooking for the family?
- That's the plan.

402
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:51,749
Why do I need
a Legal Youth Advocate here?

403
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,667
It's the law, sweetie.

404
00:20:57,868 --> 00:20:59,437
So, have you ever killed anybody?

405
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:01,736
Me?

406
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:04,845
No.

407
00:21:07,252 --> 00:21:08,049
David.

408
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:12,312
Okay, I will bring her up.

409
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:13,688
Mrs. McKinna?

410
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:16,357
You go on ahead, Ziva.
I'll be right there.

411
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:20,405
I got all my bars,
and I'm only up to celery stalks.

412
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,420
Ducky's waiting.

413
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:29,286
I'll take her up.

414
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,593
You take the stairs up,
but the elevator down?

415
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,929
Knees.

416
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:52,829
Got my attention.

417
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,439
You think I'm hiding something.
About Trevor.

418
00:21:57,258 --> 00:21:58,158
Are you?

419
00:22:02,276 --> 00:22:03,112
I told you.

420
00:22:03,996 --> 00:22:04,989
You're safe here.

421
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,693
I know. That's not it.

422
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:12,288
I'm not in danger.

423
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:13,972
Who is?

424
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:20,806
Nobody.

425
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:30,848
Glad we talked.

426
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:38,189
Hello, I'm Dr. Mallard.

427
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:39,400
Please.

428
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,986
And if you wish,
you can call me Ducky.

429
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,446
Hello, Ducky.

430
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,157
Dr. Mallard, you may proceed.

431
00:22:49,078 --> 00:22:50,618
I'm here if you need me, Angela.

432
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,669
Well, now, Angela.

433
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:54,633
Is this a psych evaluation?

434
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:58,155
I know there are three types:
general, emergency and clinical.

435
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:00,169
This feels clinical to me.

436
00:23:08,613 --> 00:23:10,964
- I was just coming to see you.
- You all right, Duck?

437
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:13,224
Yeah, well,
she had me talking about my first pet.

438
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:16,101
It was a guinea pig
called Hunka Munka.

439
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,551
Passed away,
about the time I was her age.

440
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:21,538
Duck, you were supposed
to find out about her past.

441
00:23:22,107 --> 00:23:23,901
Yeah, all that went extremely well.

442
00:23:24,118 --> 00:23:24,871
And?

443
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:27,733
Well,
if she is suppressing memories,

444
00:23:27,817 --> 00:23:30,992
she does a remarkably good job of it.
I didn't get anywhere there.

445
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:33,303
But I can tell you that beneath

446
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,884
that precocious bravado
there is a very sensitive little girl.

447
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,642
She may act twice her age
but inside she's anything but.

448
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:41,969
Secrets?

449
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,255
Yeah, and when she's ready,
she will reveal them.

450
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,756
But I wouldn't push her.

451
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,217
Jethro, when I did just now,
she pushed right back.

452
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:52,138
Hey, Boss, here you go.
Eddie Castillo's here again.

453
00:23:52,627 --> 00:23:54,545
- Go talk to him.
- Me?

454
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,684
Yeah, you got
something better to do?

455
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,520
- Yeah, I got travel plans.
- No, go, talk.

456
00:23:59,825 --> 00:24:00,686
Right.

457
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,069
Hey, miss me, Eddie?

458
00:24:08,153 --> 00:24:10,573
{\Look, }I've got something to say.
It's about why I was calling Trevor.

459
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:11,991
I'm all ears.

460
00:24:16,137 --> 00:24:18,277
I have a cousin.
He's nine years old.

461
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:20,632
He's already getting
into trouble and...

462
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:25,046
I wanted to have Trevor talk to him,
about that Marines stuff...

463
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,381
Help straighten him out.
Give him somebody to look up to.

464
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:29,608
Other than you?

465
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:32,623
- That warms my heart.
- I'm serious, man.

466
00:24:33,495 --> 00:24:35,031
I can't let my crew find out

467
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:37,517
that I'm trying to keep
my own blood out of this life.

468
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,769
{\Yeah}It's all about honor
and integrity with you, isn't it{\, Eddie}?

469
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:42,772
- You don't know anything about me, man!
- I know plenty about you!

470
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,314
I know you're not angry at Lozada,
you're jealous of him.

471
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:49,572
'Cause he had the brains and the guts
to get out of the gang. And you didn't.

472
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,572
And he made something of himself,

473
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,573
you didn't.

474
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:56,160
Trevor got out 'cause he had a real job
and he could take care of his family.

475
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:57,578
They were proud of him.{\, you know.}

476
00:24:57,975 --> 00:25:00,289
He earned that.
But I didn't kill him!

477
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:03,179
Look, he needed something from me,
too, okay?

478
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,588
He needed some advice.

479
00:25:04,966 --> 00:25:06,706
Something about some girl
in trouble.

480
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,424
You're telling me that a decorated
Marine calls you instead of the cops?

481
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,062
He said if he went to the cops,
the girl's life would be in danger.

482
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:14,137
I don't know why.

483
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:16,514
Girl have a name?

484
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:17,899
Angela.

485
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:23,572
Sorry,

486
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:28,023
my cousin Tetra's lime Jello
with yams, marshmallows and pecans.

487
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:30,633
Some family traditions
should not be upheld.

488
00:25:30,717 --> 00:25:31,863
That really, really,

489
00:25:32,134 --> 00:25:33,231
really sucked.

490
00:25:36,957 --> 00:25:37,972
In a jiffy, Gibbs.

491
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:40,305
Did you know that "jiffy" is
one one-hundredth of a second?

492
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:41,660
{\I mean, }It's an actual thing.

493
00:25:41,744 --> 00:25:44,876
Unlike say, lickety-split, which has
no scientific meaning whatsoever.

494
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:46,710
{\All right, }We're almost there.

495
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,838
Get there, Abs, in a jiffy.

496
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:50,798
There, okay.

497
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:54,187
I applied a biometric algorithm
recognition program so,

498
00:25:54,392 --> 00:25:56,345
the seemingly random
artistic patterns of her...

499
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,556
You don't really care
how I got there.

500
00:25:58,816 --> 00:26:00,225
Okay, let's talk turkey.

501
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:02,310
A code.

502
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:03,728
It's more than a code.

503
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,393
It's her own language.
She used 26 shades of color

504
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:08,733
to correspond
with the 26 letters of the alphabet.

505
00:26:08,994 --> 00:26:11,819
Once I figured that out, I was able
to translate her art into letters.

506
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:15,418
A poem?

507
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:16,852
Yeah.

508
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:18,849
And it's dark and...

509
00:26:19,387 --> 00:26:20,933
creepy.
Very detailed.

510
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:23,053
It's called,
"The Lady In A Fountain".

511
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:24,248
It's about death.

512
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:26,792
- It's a poem.
- Can you just

513
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:28,920
ask me about the second collage?
Please, please.

514
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:36,644
Abby, what am I looking at here?

515
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,930
It's a frequency-jamming signal,
Gibbs.

516
00:26:39,324 --> 00:26:40,479
Frequency?

517
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:42,055
For what?

518
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:44,366
It's every communication code

519
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,647
for every ship, plane and helicopter
in the United States Navy

520
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,949
and Marine Corps.

521
00:26:49,587 --> 00:26:53,567
I don't know why she was hiding military
secrets in her collages, unless...

522
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:56,155
I don't know,
she was gonna sell them?

523
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:57,870
Or someone else was for her.

524
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:00,794
Bank records for Angela's mother.

525
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:07,235
Angela's mom has called 13 times.

526
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:09,355
- She wants to see her daughter.
- Yeah, she will.

527
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:10,531
What'd you find?

528
00:27:10,937 --> 00:27:14,864
Angela's mom's average income
for the past 16 years is $43,000.

529
00:27:15,316 --> 00:27:16,509
Okay, more recently.

530
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,263
Over the last three months, her mother's
made three additional deposits

531
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,676
totaling 60 grand.

532
00:27:22,106 --> 00:27:24,060
So, either her mother's playing
the ponies...

533
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:26,102
Or she's taking advantage
of her little girl.

534
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:44,601
It's like those magic eye posters,

535
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:47,957
where you stare
at them and then, suddenly,

536
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:49,750
you see that hidden image.

537
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,292
Tony, Abby already un-hid it.

538
00:27:52,495 --> 00:27:54,547
It's frequency-jamming signals.

539
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:55,679
No, maybe if I...

540
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:57,953
{\pos(192,220)}Maybe if I try to unfocus...

541
00:27:58,233 --> 00:27:59,260
{\pos(192,220)}Focus, DiNozzo.

542
00:27:59,921 --> 00:28:01,125
{\pos(192,220)}That's it, Boss.

543
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,098
{\pos(192,220)}Out of focus.
It's dolphins!

544
00:28:04,544 --> 00:28:05,433
{\pos(192,220)}In moonlight!

545
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:08,371
- Thank you, Boss.
- Anytime.

546
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:12,302
Anytime.

547
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:16,194
Boss,
the... frequency-jamming signals

548
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,030
Abby pulled out of Angela's collages
are linked to a naval/marine

549
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,115
maneuver called ballistic winter.

550
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,660
Copies of these jamming signals
appeared on the black market

551
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,407
three months ago in China.
It's an open NCIS investigation.

552
00:28:27,491 --> 00:28:30,476
There is no way
that girl stole state secrets.

553
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,625
She is a child.

554
00:28:31,874 --> 00:28:33,716
You've clearly never seen
<i>The Bad Seed</i>.

555
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,060
Interpol have suspects?

556
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:36,047
Just one.

557
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:39,423
Just follow along here, Boss.

558
00:28:39,507 --> 00:28:41,635
C-Ten Dynamics
is a U.S. defense firm

559
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,307
that does R&D in...

560
00:28:43,726 --> 00:28:45,514
conjunction
with the Sattler Institute.

561
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:49,602
C-Ten's sales rep is a woman
named Debra Leigh Dalton.

562
00:28:50,174 --> 00:28:53,189
Dalton. Same last name as our think
tank coordinator, Krista Dalton.

563
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,316
- Sisters?
- Affirmative.

564
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,234
Debra is Krista's younger sister.

565
00:28:57,454 --> 00:28:59,820
Maybe that was Debra
sneaking into Angela's room?

566
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:01,995
I want to talk to Debra Dalton.

567
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:04,575
Boss, that's gonna be
a bit of a problem.

568
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:06,744
Miss Dalton flew into DC

569
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,909
five days ago
but never got to her house.

570
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,351
And there's no record of any credit card
or cell activity since she arrived.

571
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:15,545
A mom, a daughter and two sisters...

572
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:17,254
trading Government secrets.

573
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,840
It's like <i>Hannah and her Sisters</i>
meets <i>The 39 Steps</i>.

574
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,010
- Sorry.
- Get Krista Dalton in here.

575
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:25,369
Put Angela in a safe house.

576
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:28,682
Safe houses have been compromised...
a computer glitch.

577
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,630
Should be cleared by tomorrow.
Motel?

578
00:29:30,714 --> 00:29:32,728
Good luck finding one
right before Thanksgiving.

579
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:35,620
Ducky has an extra room.

580
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:40,170
You know, Boss, we've all got plans

581
00:29:40,254 --> 00:29:42,334
- this holiday season and...
- Cancel them.

582
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:51,981
Play again?

583
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,339
This kid's a ringer.
Watch her.

584
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,667
I know that, Ray.

585
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:03,426
That's my money.

586
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,499
So, what's the buy-in?

587
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:15,951
For you?

588
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:18,607
Two bucks.

589
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:22,570
How about we play
for different stakes?

590
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,202
What do you have in mind?

591
00:30:25,482 --> 00:30:27,658
I win, you tell me the truth.

592
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:30,504
About Lozada,

593
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:32,934
military secrets,

594
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:34,999
everything.

595
00:30:38,873 --> 00:30:41,338
Found the jamming signals
that were hidden in your artwork.

596
00:30:43,348 --> 00:30:44,592
I wasn't hiding anything.

597
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:46,926
It's just how my mind works.

598
00:30:47,902 --> 00:30:49,770
It's how I work out puzzles
they give me.

599
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:51,922
I do it through art, images.

600
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:54,387
Numbers, letters, colors and shapes.

601
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,684
You build things.

602
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:02,603
Woodwork, right?

603
00:31:03,474 --> 00:31:05,112
My father made cabinets.

604
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,533
Didn't you ever express yourself
in the things you made?

605
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:14,597
How many people
at the institute know

606
00:31:15,178 --> 00:31:16,624
what was in your artwork?

607
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,210
I'm not sure.

608
00:31:19,949 --> 00:31:21,277
Safe house is ready.

609
00:31:30,413 --> 00:31:32,312
What is going on here, Agent Gibbs?

610
00:31:32,396 --> 00:31:34,278
Why is NCIS holding my daughter?

611
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:37,155
You've been getting
a lot of money lately.

612
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:41,857
No, that is Angela's money.

613
00:31:42,427 --> 00:31:44,266
I never wanted her to go there.

614
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,771
What mother wants
to be without her child?

615
00:31:46,965 --> 00:31:49,842
But Angela thought
that it would be good for her.

616
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,863
She wanted to fit in somewhere.

617
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:54,995
You really thought she was getting
paid all that just to play video games?

618
00:31:55,857 --> 00:31:58,999
We were told Angela's work
saved soldiers' lives.

619
00:31:59,692 --> 00:32:02,169
The money didn't matter.
She felt good about helping.

620
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,256
It all goes to her college fund.
What are you suggesting?

621
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,091
How'd the dollars get to you?

622
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:12,905
The larger amounts came
from this company,

623
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:15,195
C-Ten Dynamics.

624
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:17,851
I assumed they were projects
Angela worked on.

625
00:32:23,378 --> 00:32:25,936
Payments were approved
by Debra Dalton.

626
00:32:26,517 --> 00:32:27,403
You know her?

627
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,173
No, I only ever talked
to Krista Dalton.

628
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:31,991
The checks come in the mail.

629
00:32:35,046 --> 00:32:36,036
Yeah. Gibbs.

630
00:32:38,672 --> 00:32:39,414
Where?

631
00:32:40,617 --> 00:32:41,537
All right.

632
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,622
Wait, when can I see my daughter?

633
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:48,924
Soon.

634
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:55,948
A maintenance worker
from the {\Sattler }Institute found the body.

635
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,393
That'll spoil your Thanksgiving.

636
00:33:00,356 --> 00:33:01,711
Debra Dalton, Boss.

637
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,148
Fished her out of the culvert.

638
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:08,004
Whoever put her down there must've
thought that the body would wash away.

639
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:10,487
It's a pretty public place
for a murder. I mean,

640
00:33:11,144 --> 00:33:13,066
employees, security guards...

641
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:14,631
Dorms.

642
00:33:16,123 --> 00:33:17,467
Angela's room.

643
00:33:20,402 --> 00:33:21,771
"Lady In A Fountain."

644
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,633
- Can I help?
- I don't think so. Thank you.

645
00:33:30,864 --> 00:33:32,396
Can I watch TV?

646
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:34,511
It's on the blink, I'm afraid.

647
00:33:35,386 --> 00:33:36,334
Computer?

648
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,350
That's my laptop,
and it's in my car.

649
00:33:40,814 --> 00:33:41,523
Books?

650
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,539
Yes.
The library.

651
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:45,872
Second door on the left.

652
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:50,110
Just a moment, Ziva.

653
00:33:50,506 --> 00:33:52,374
We have to start the brining.

654
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,087
- Okay, but I have to...
- No, no.

655
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:55,487
It'll only take a moment.

656
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:57,913
There we are.
Now, then.

657
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,288
You know the secret to a good stuffing
is not to get it too moist.

658
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:04,249
This is a bit awkward.

659
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,703
You know something?
I think we need a second pair of hands.

660
00:34:07,023 --> 00:34:08,238
Young lady?

661
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,914
Angela, where are you?

662
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:32,583
She isn't in the library
and she didn't go out back.

663
00:34:39,604 --> 00:34:41,109
Have you found her?

664
00:34:41,593 --> 00:34:43,088
She's gone. Call Gibbs.

665
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:56,827
{\pos(192,220)}- Agents are canvassing the neighbors.
- Amber alert. Bolos?

666
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:59,140
{\pos(192,220)}- No hits yet.
- Traffic cameras.

667
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,807
{\pos(192,220)}D.O.T's are on full capacity
for the holidays, but checking.

668
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,673
I looked everywhere.
Nothing.

669
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:07,561
Nothing?
You didn't hear anything?

670
00:35:07,991 --> 00:35:09,559
Not car tires? Not voices?

671
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:11,483
Nothing. By the time I came{\ outside},
she was gone.

672
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,942
It was all my fault.

673
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:16,098
- I was too busy preparing for tomorrow.
- No, it was my fault.

674
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:17,951
I distracted you
from doing your job.

675
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,325
It's both of your faults.
Focus on fixing it.

676
00:35:20,934 --> 00:35:21,966
Yeah. McGee.

677
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:24,955
I'll tell him.
Krista Dalton's in interrogation.

678
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,749
You stay with Ducky.
You two, with me.{\Come on.}

679
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:31,044
Are you accusing me of taking her?

680
00:35:32,137 --> 00:35:34,631
The care and safety of those kids
is my only concern.

681
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:37,551
I can see why.

682
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:39,618
Worth a lot to you.

683
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:42,765
We did some digging,
and we found your overseas accounts.

684
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:45,100
It's... it's not what you think.

685
00:35:45,617 --> 00:35:46,684
What am I thinking?

686
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:48,937
Because it sure looks

687
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:52,417
like you made money selling
government secrets, using these kids.

688
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:54,691
- They're games.
- Games?

689
00:35:54,775 --> 00:35:57,100
We sold battle scenarios
to game designers.

690
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:58,234
In China.

691
00:35:58,907 --> 00:35:59,919
They paid a lot.

692
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,700
- You and your sister Debra.
- Yes.

693
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,661
Debra made contacts through her trips
to Asia for her firm.

694
00:36:04,836 --> 00:36:06,520
C-Ten Dynamics.

695
00:36:06,604 --> 00:36:07,915
We took some of the money...

696
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,335
Debra and I...
The rest we gave to the families.

697
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,128
Sattler made a ton off those kids,
never give anything back.

698
00:36:13,732 --> 00:36:17,031
- It was old information. Useless!
- Frequency jamming signals?

699
00:36:17,115 --> 00:36:19,300
For "ballistic winter",
that system was being phased out.

700
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:20,635
It's still classified.

701
00:36:20,852 --> 00:36:22,930
- Technically, but...
- Which makes it technically

702
00:36:23,325 --> 00:36:24,271
treason.

703
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:29,791
Someone murdered
Lance Corporal Lozada,

704
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,481
and you're talking to me
about game sales?

705
00:36:32,697 --> 00:36:34,650
I had nothing to do with his death!

706
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:41,198
Oh, my god.

707
00:36:43,255 --> 00:36:44,233
That's...

708
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:46,745
that's Debra.

709
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,977
How did this...

710
00:36:50,934 --> 00:36:52,246
When did this happen?

711
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:54,494
Found her today.

712
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:56,004
Your day off.

713
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:58,301
Two dead bodies.

714
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:00,591
Both tied to you and the Institute.

715
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:03,404
You think...

716
00:37:04,888 --> 00:37:06,431
I killed my own sister?

717
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,518
Maybe to bury the trail.
Maybe to keep the money.

718
00:37:10,515 --> 00:37:13,080
Oh, my god.
Angela is missing.

719
00:37:13,726 --> 00:37:16,275
What does this dead marine and
your dead sister have to do with her?

720
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:18,510
- I don't know.
- Think!

721
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:19,486
I swear! I...

722
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,700
Debra was seeing someone.
She was afraid of him.

723
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,826
- She {\was going}wanted to break it off...
- {\Who? }Give me a name.

724
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:29,200
She never told me.
She didn't want me involved.

725
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:30,372
You are involved!

726
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:40,303
No sightings, Boss.

727
00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:42,283
Whoever's got her is keeping her
out of sight.

728
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:44,303
If anyone has seen her.

729
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:46,179
I just borrowed these from Abby.

730
00:37:46,439 --> 00:37:48,682
- I'm listening, Duck.
- Well, apart from the cat...

731
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,476
everything in her room is
from the outside world:

732
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:53,979
The posters she's chosen,
the photographs,

733
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:57,065
the things she painted,
the things she's drawn.

734
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,731
Yeah, there's nothing of herself.

735
00:37:58,815 --> 00:38:01,409
It's as if she's resisting showing
the rest of the world

736
00:38:01,493 --> 00:38:04,077
what she really cares about.
And when we talked,

737
00:38:04,393 --> 00:38:06,658
she never once mentioned her home

738
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:08,660
or the town from whence she came.

739
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,915
She was guarding it.

740
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,120
Well, deep down I think
she's just a scared little girl

741
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:14,595
trying to protect her mother.

742
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:18,224
I've been calling her mother's house
every ten minutes, like you said, but

743
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:20,672
- no answer.
- I just got a credit card hit.

744
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:23,135
One of Ducky's credit cards.

745
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:25,049
What?
She took one of mine?

746
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:26,716
Clever girl.

747
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:29,888
Just bought a map of her hometown
at a service station.

748
00:38:29,972 --> 00:38:32,351
- She's dropping bread crumbs.
- Wants us to come get her.

749
00:38:32,597 --> 00:38:34,895
If the killer is thinking
the same way we are...

750
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,897
He'll be waiting for her.
Let's go.

751
00:38:39,908 --> 00:38:41,442
Nice acceleration, Boss.

752
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:45,293
I don't think
that clam chowder was any good.

753
00:38:46,218 --> 00:38:47,691
I haven't felt this way since...

754
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:50,455
Aunt Lorraine's Thanksgiving,
back in '86.

755
00:38:51,141 --> 00:38:52,329
- Yeah, Abs.
<i>- Gibbs.</i>

756
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,480
Ducky said you were looking for
a connection between

757
00:38:54,564 --> 00:38:56,667
{\Lance }Corporal Lozada
and the woman found in the culvert.

758
00:38:56,932 --> 00:38:59,002
Talk faster, Abs.
You're breaking up.

759
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:02,130
<i>I found traces of beeswax
and bleached linseed oil</i>

760
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,854
on both Lance Corporal Lozada's body

761
00:39:03,938 --> 00:39:06,218
and on a thumb impression
on the back of Debra Dalton's head.

762
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,261
It's like she was held down
and drowned.

763
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:10,847
<i>We matched the water
in her lungs to the fountain in front of</i>

764
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,600
the think tank building.
Exact Chlorine and Alkali levels.

765
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:16,819
Both the oil and the wax are used
as base ingredients in oil-based paints.

766
00:39:16,903 --> 00:39:17,854
<i>Thanks, Abs.</i>

767
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:24,143
Nausea sort of comes in waves, Boss.
But I'm working through it.

768
00:39:24,227 --> 00:39:26,429
The paintings at Norvell's workstation
at the Institute.

769
00:39:26,513 --> 00:39:28,425
- They oil or water-based?
- Oil.

770
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:30,574
Landscape, fruit bowls...

771
00:39:30,866 --> 00:39:32,890
I really shouldn't have had
that clam chowder.

772
00:39:43,322 --> 00:39:44,798
- I'll take the back.
- Hang on.

773
00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:55,017
Baby, run.

774
00:39:56,315 --> 00:39:57,756
Run, please.

775
00:39:59,326 --> 00:40:00,851
It's going to be okay, mom.

776
00:40:01,378 --> 00:40:03,066
Why are you doing this to us?!

777
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:04,767
Tell her, Angela.

778
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:07,571
Tell her what you told
Lance Corporal Lozada.

779
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,759
What you wrote in your collages!

780
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,783
Angela, go, please.
Just let her go! Shut up!

781
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,326
Why'd you kill that woman?

782
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:16,305
She humiliated me.

783
00:40:18,193 --> 00:40:19,489
It had to be done.

784
00:40:20,644 --> 00:40:23,086
Same thing with Lozada...
once you told him.

785
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,698
I think they bought
the whole gang retribution thing.

786
00:40:26,782 --> 00:40:27,819
Don't you?

787
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:31,420
Time to take a little ride.

788
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:32,679
Let's go.

789
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,050
Move!

790
00:40:40,632 --> 00:40:41,480
Let her go.

791
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:46,401
Back off!

792
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:50,010
I'll kill her!

793
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,332
Look at me.

794
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:02,584
Move back! Now!

795
00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:05,837
Got it.

796
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:08,090
She'll miss.

797
00:41:10,445 --> 00:41:12,052
What's the probability of that?

798
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,181
Based on the temperature
and humidity.

799
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:19,223
No wind.
Half moon, good light.

800
00:41:20,298 --> 00:41:21,812
97.6 %.

801
00:41:24,228 --> 00:41:25,481
Last chance, Norvell.

802
00:41:26,142 --> 00:41:27,317
Move or I'll do it!!

803
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:28,851
Take it.

804
00:41:32,217 --> 00:41:33,779
- Mom...
- Oh, baby.

805
00:41:37,994 --> 00:41:38,787
Love you.

806
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:52,877
It is such a pleasure
to have you all here.

807
00:41:53,217 --> 00:41:54,372
Even though

808
00:41:54,587 --> 00:41:57,296
our togetherness
was not your first choice.

809
00:41:58,333 --> 00:41:59,516
It's just Indian poker,

810
00:42:00,129 --> 00:42:01,393
all-you-can-eat crab legs,

811
00:42:01,879 --> 00:42:03,395
- showgirls.
- Relax, Tony.

812
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:06,171
- Plenty of wine.
- Well, then...

813
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,609
I suppose it's time to carve.

814
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:12,251
And, apparently, we have a quorum.

815
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,444
You remembered the rolls!

816
00:42:24,874 --> 00:42:26,710
There's not a lot
available out there, Duck.

817
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:33,550
A superb selection.

818
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:35,925
A toast.

819
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:38,889
Close friends and dear family all.

820
00:42:39,206 --> 00:42:40,699
A bountiful thanks

821
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,559
and good things for fall.

822
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,769
And to all a good night!

823
00:42:47,506 --> 00:42:48,661
Wrong holiday.

824
00:42:50,272 --> 00:42:52,110
- Cheers.
- To all of us! Happy Thanksgiving.

825
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:53,874
- Cheers!
- Jolly good!
