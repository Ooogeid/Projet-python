4
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:35,961
<i>to continue to fall
for the rest of the week.</i>

5
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:40,808
What, dear?

6
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:43,635
No, I will not apologize
to your mother.

7
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:46,087
Well, good. Let her go home.

8
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:50,225
- <i>Will?! What was that?!</i>
- Can't talk.

9
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:54,762
What the hell?

10
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,884
Hold it right there!

15
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:55,948
Jethro working you so hard you have
to do your laundry at the office?

16
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:00,036
- Stepped in a puddle.
- He did not watch where he was walking.

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,078
He was texting.

18
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:03,164
Me. Tony thinks "probationary agent"

19
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:05,491
means
that I'm his personal assistant.

20
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,585
He wanted me to pick up his latte.

21
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,795
I was running late.

22
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,164
That is your problem.

23
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:11,464
I hate rain.

24
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,590
I love it.

25
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,522
I mean, rain is so invigorating,
cleansing.

26
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:18,346
It makes the air fresh
and the city sparkle.

27
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,709
Where is Jethro?

28
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:21,848
I have no idea.

29
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,810
I think he's
in the building somewhere.

30
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,324
Well, it can wait.

31
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:28,940
Does anyone have any talc?
This hurts.

32
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:32,737
Would you just take
your foot to the locker room, please?

33
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:37,020
Any of you notice
something different about Ducky?

34
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:40,958
Yeah, he has seemed
awfully chipper as of late.

35
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,542
Ducky does seem plucky.

36
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,412
No one loves rain in DC.

37
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:45,972
No. His ties.

38
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:49,532
He's been wearing tie ties,
not his bow ties.

39
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:51,779
That's very observant.

40
00:02:51,863 --> 00:02:53,856
Boss, Ducky was looking for you.

41
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,960
What does he want?

42
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:56,926
Don't know, but he left
something for you.

43
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,471
Let's go. Marine shot.
Rock Creek Park.

44
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:06,566
Thanks, Boss.
Are these clean?

45
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:07,907
Of course they are.

46
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:11,231
We searched the area.

47
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:13,677
Found a nine-millimeter.

48
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:16,535
Yeah, looky there.

49
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:26,247
The FBI ERT,

50
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:28,499
they removed
a slug from the vehicle.

51
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,334
Good luck finding any more.

52
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:33,110
Yeah, a lot of muddy footprints.
Nothing that could be lifted.

53
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:35,557
Get all the evidence.
Collect it back to our lab, will you?

54
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:38,570
That's between you and the FBI.
We're not getting in the middle of that.

55
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:40,565
When did the Bureau get involved?

56
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,097
We called them in
to assist with the ballistics.

57
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:44,974
You find anything on the victim?

58
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,145
Just what looked like a house key.
It was tied to his shoelaces.

59
00:03:49,575 --> 00:03:52,234
Really? Then how did you ID
Lieutenant Mayne?

60
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:55,921
Mobile fingerprint scanner.

61
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,347
Don't you guys use them?

62
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:00,308
Well, I mean, they...

63
00:04:00,503 --> 00:04:02,795
they're coming.
They just haven't quite been issued yet.

64
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,114
Can I give it a go?

65
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,663
Just put your thumb on the screen.

66
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:12,071
- How's he doing?
- Still in surgery.

67
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:14,951
Park police, FBI can clean up here.
Let's get to the hospital.

68
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:17,340
Timothy... no middle name... McGee.

69
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:22,946
You broke into a Metro PD
impound yard?

70
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,430
What's the matter with you?

71
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:26,763
Boss, that was supposed
to be expunged.

72
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:29,644
Run Mayne's service record.
Notify next of kin.

73
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:30,895
If you need me.

74
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,982
Wife: Leah Mayne,
lives in Woodley Park.

75
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,985
- That's strange.
- What now, McGee?

76
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,363
There must be something wrong
with your fingerprint scanner.

77
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:43,187
According to his service record,
Lieutenant Mayne is MIA.

78
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,725
Went missing in Afghanistan
six years ago.

79
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,859
<i>- Page me if there's any change.
- Yes, Doctor.</i>

80
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,822
- When can we talk with him?
- I don't know.

81
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,905
One bullet grazed his forehead.
The other went deep

82
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:12,435
into his lower left abdomen.
He's lost a lot of blood.

83
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,338
The slug is imbedded close
to his spine.

84
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,942
It would be far too dangerous
to remove at this time.

85
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:20,914
Ruth, will you keep
his IV at 75 cc per hour?

86
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,464
- Yes, Doctor.
- Thank you.

87
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,382
I'll let you know
if there's any changes, Agent Gibbs.

88
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:35,745
This is surreal.

89
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:36,840
I mean...

90
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:40,764
After all these years,
not even a word.

91
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,951
I just assumed
that my husband was dead and...

92
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:48,580
and now you're telling me
that he's alive and that he's...

93
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:51,471
living in Washington DC,
but he's been shot. I mean, are you...

94
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,374
sure that it was John?

95
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,004
We have a fingerprint match,

96
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,273
but we'd like you to make
a visual identification.

97
00:05:57,493 --> 00:05:58,690
You okay with that?

98
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,511
It looks like him.

99
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,883
The last time I saw John, he was...

100
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,762
clean-shaven and he had
a Marine buzz cut.

101
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:45,041
- He had a birthmark on his...
- Hold on. Hang on.

102
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,353
Nurse, please.

103
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:50,659
Brownish, circular?

104
00:06:58,493 --> 00:06:59,592
It's John.

105
00:07:03,896 --> 00:07:05,912
Where has he been
the last six years?

106
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,682
I don't know,
but we're going to find out.

107
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,878
You need a minute?

108
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,085
Thank you.

109
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,389
Stay here.

110
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:23,960
If he regains consciousness,
call me,

111
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:26,126
and see if you can get
any more out of her.

112
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,323
You subscribing to the DiNozzo Theory,
always suspect the wife?

113
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,017
<i>I'm at the hospital...</i>

114
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:55,933
Okay. What do we got?

115
00:07:57,922 --> 00:07:59,468
Six years ago, Lieutenant Mayne

116
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:02,982
was part of a three-man deep cover
recon mission in Afghanistan.

117
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,176
He went missing.

118
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:07,195
The other two team members were
Captain Gordon Holcomb

119
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,189
and Sergeant Matthew Gontz.

120
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:12,741
Holcomb's still in the military.
He's a Major now, stationed in Quantico.

121
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:14,535
He's coming in tomorrow morning.

122
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,131
Gontz was honorably discharged
five years ago.

123
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:19,483
Still haven't found him,

124
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:22,835
though we do know that he went through
a divorce and a series of jobs.

125
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:25,734
I think he's having a little trouble
adjusting to civilian life.

126
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:29,508
I am going to try and track him down
through Social Security Administration.

127
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:35,222
You're a thirsty little boy.

128
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:37,006
Yes, you are.

129
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:38,475
Yes, you are.

130
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:42,062
Yeah, we're gonna get you
some water and some food and love.

131
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:46,104
What's the dog doing here?

132
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,255
Gibbs, this is Mortimer.

133
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,581
What's he doing here?

134
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,408
I am an SVPR.

135
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:56,619
A Substitute Volunteer Puppy Raiser.

136
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:01,029
Mortimer here is going to be
a Seeing Eye dog one day

137
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,785
and you're going to be the smartest boy
in your whole class.

138
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:05,803
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

139
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,673
Okay, putting dog down now.

140
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,775
So, the gun.

141
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:15,179
It is...

142
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,999
unregistered, and has only
Lieutenant Mayne's prints on it.

143
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,977
As you can see,
it is a nine-millimeter.

144
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,439
There were two shots fired,
and 13 remain in the magazine.

145
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,802
The slug that FBI ERT
pulled from the vehicle?

146
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,820
It's too mangled to match,
but it's definitely bigger than a nine.

147
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,452
Ducky talked to the doctor.

148
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:35,866
Mayne's wounds
weren't self-inflicted.

149
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:39,406
- Looks like a shoot-out.
- What's going on with Ducky?

150
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,121
He's acting very un-Ducky-like.

151
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,730
Like-like every day,
he leaves during lunch.

152
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:45,167
He's never done that.

153
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,593
The Duck Man is a creature of habit.
He brings in his lunch.

154
00:09:47,677 --> 00:09:49,004
He eats at his desk.

155
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:51,673
Where is he going?

156
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:53,003
I'm sure he's fine.

157
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,100
Don't let that dog out
of your sight.

158
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:02,184
That's not your bone.

159
00:10:02,723 --> 00:10:04,452
Excuse me, Matthew Gontz?

160
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,808
Matthew Gontz?

161
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:13,946
Yeah?

162
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:16,282
NCIS. May we speak with you?

163
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:21,078
What's this about? I've been out
of the Marine Corps for years.

164
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:23,750
Yeah, we know.
You've been hard to track down.

165
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,981
We need to ask about
a reconnaissance mission.

166
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:28,252
The one where Lieutenant Mayne
went missing.

167
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,212
You know I've told
that story a hundred times?

168
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,089
We need to hear it for ourselves.

169
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:36,040
It was just the three of us.

170
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:38,304
Me, Captain Holcomb,
Lieutenant Mayne.

171
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,373
We were inserted
into a hostile environment.

172
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,975
It was a keyhole mission.
Defensive weapons only.

173
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:46,742
Am I cleared to tell
you guys this stuff?

174
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:49,315
- This was classified.
- We've been read into the program.

175
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:55,007
Our mission was to place and recover
remote target sensors in Mazar-e.

176
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:58,221
Everything went according to plan
until we made for the exit rendezvous.

177
00:10:58,305 --> 00:11:00,200
That's when Lieutenant Mayne
broke his leg.

178
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:01,650
How did it happen?

179
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,368
We were coming over a wall
in a small village just outside of town.

180
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:08,692
He snagged his KA-BAR sheath
on some barbed wire, and he fell.

181
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,260
It wasn't his day.

182
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:12,588
Did you leave him behind?

183
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:16,832
Captain Holcomb and myself stashed him
in the basement of an abandoned building

184
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,539
while we went to commandeer a vehicle.
When we came back,

185
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:21,972
he wasn't there.
We assumed he was captured.

186
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:25,217
So you and Captain Holcomb
went to the exit rendezvous?

187
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,145
We had to.
We followed mission protocol.

188
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:31,899
Look, I've never forgiven myself
for leaving a team member behind.

189
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,053
Must be tough.

190
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,082
The Marine Corps tore the country
upside down looking for Mayne.

191
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,087
Look, are we done?

192
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,342
I gotta clock in.

193
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,112
For now.

194
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,164
Wait.

195
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:52,362
Why's all this coming up again?

196
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,467
John Mayne is no longer MIA.

197
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,702
He showed up yesterday morning.

198
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:57,925
He was shot.

199
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:01,553
I don't believe it.

200
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:03,799
Where'd it happen?

201
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,803
Right here in DC.

202
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,811
You have any indication
he was alive over the past six years?

203
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,071
The last time I saw him
was in Mazar-e.

204
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:14,875
His KA-BAR sheath got snagged
on some barbwire.

205
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,157
He broke his leg.

206
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:17,986
Just wasn't his day.

207
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:25,702
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Boss, Lieutenant Mayne's awake.

208
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:27,057
Be right there.

209
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:34,043
Did you have any contact
with Sergeant Gontz since Afghanistan?

210
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,464
The mission really shook him badly.

211
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,760
I lost track with him
after he got discharged.

212
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,209
Has he been told Mayne's alive?

213
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,087
Yes, he has.

214
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,956
<i>Two milligrams of flurazepam.
Call me if there's any changes, okay?</i>

215
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,716
Just keep me posted.
Thank you.

216
00:12:52,393 --> 00:12:55,321
He's conscious, which is a good sign,
but he's incoherent.

217
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:58,299
Worst thing for him right now is
to be bombarded with questions.

218
00:12:58,498 --> 00:13:00,239
I'm gonna keep him sedated.

219
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,906
- For how long?
- It's too early to tell.

220
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:06,869
Special Agent Gibbs...

221
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,707
My name's Rachel Wells.
I was told by police to see you.

222
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,584
About what?

223
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,348
My husband.

224
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:18,860
He went jogging yesterday morning,
never returned home.

225
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:21,685
When I reported him missing
and showed his picture to police,

226
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,658
they directed me here.

227
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:31,643
You're married to John Mayne?

228
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,813
No, his name's Christian Wells.

229
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,181
No, his name is John,
and he's my husband.

230
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:51,760
I met Christian two years ago,

231
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,897
on a track at Georgetown.
Thanks.

232
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:55,125
We're both runners.

233
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,732
We smiled and nodded
for about a month,

234
00:13:58,816 --> 00:14:01,048
and then went for coffee,

235
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,133
and then started dating.

236
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:11,127
How long you been married?

237
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:13,222
Just over a year.

238
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:16,463
Last Christmas in Hawaii,

239
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:17,693
we eloped.

240
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:19,699
You met his family?

241
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:21,771
He doesn't have any family.

242
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:24,071
Christian's an only child
and both his parents are dead.

243
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:29,765
But you're probably gonna tell me
that that's not true either.

244
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:32,136
His name's John Mayne.

245
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:35,415
He went MIA in Afghanistan
six years ago.

246
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:39,840
Your husband have a job?

247
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,296
He day-trades,

248
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,843
manages his portfolio.

249
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:47,702
Christian inherited
a lot of money, so...

250
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:51,598
I mean,
that's not why I married him.

251
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:53,397
You're a runner, right?

252
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,655
How come the two of you didn't go
running yesterday morning together?

253
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:03,610
I've been nursing a hamstring.

254
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:11,374
You know, I should probably get back
upstairs to my husband.

255
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,412
You know he was meeting
someone in the park?

256
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,166
No.

257
00:15:19,176 --> 00:15:20,764
Do you know he owned a gun?

258
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:24,286
He had it with him.

259
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,880
The District does not take fingerprints
when issuing a driver's license.

260
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:38,103
That is why Christian Wells' name
does not come up on the scan.

261
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,311
The records reflect his arrival
in the Virginia-Maryland area

262
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:43,734
five years ago.
Nothing prior.

263
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,737
Lieutenant Mayne has obviously
constructed a new life.

264
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:49,147
I found a whole lot of bank
and brokerage accounts

265
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:50,731
in Christian Wells' name.

266
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:52,229
Look at that, Boss.

267
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:55,369
This one mutual account alone,
he has over $5 million in.

268
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:58,624
With what I found so far,
his net worth is over $12 million.

269
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,011
Where'd the money come from?

270
00:16:00,095 --> 00:16:02,939
Don't know yet, but we are not
the only ones checking him out.

271
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:06,590
The last two weeks, someone
ran multiple credit checks on Wells.

272
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,792
You got a name?

273
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,808
I do.

274
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:11,321
Peter Iger of Iger Investigations.

275
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,569
He's a P.I.
I got the voice mail, left a message.

276
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:15,565
Keep working
the source of the money.

277
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:17,185
Ziva, track down Iger.

278
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,776
- Can I talk to him now?
- Absolutely not.

279
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:26,985
He seems coherent.

280
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:28,654
Barely.

281
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:31,163
- Just a couple of questions, Doc.
- I'm sorry.

282
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:33,770
He's not out of the woods yet.
I don't want him upset.

283
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:36,839
Have you informed
the wife of his condition?

284
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:38,426
Which one?

285
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,030
It's quite a dilemma, isn't it?

286
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:44,961
Dr. Tallridge, I've waited long enough.
I'd like to see my husband now.

287
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,569
Ma'am, I was just telling
Agent DiNozzo that your...

288
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:50,884
husband is still
in critical condition.

289
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:53,031
- If I let you into his room...
- No.

290
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:55,225
If you let that bimbo
into my husband's room,

291
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:58,016
I will sue this hospital and you
for everything that you've got.

292
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,840
You ever been married, Doc?

293
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,005
Twice, but never at the same time.

294
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,752
- <i>Dark SUV. I'll be here...
</i>- Got it.

295
00:17:11,836 --> 00:17:14,194
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Thank you.

296
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:16,535
Iger, the P.I.?

297
00:17:21,652 --> 00:17:24,069
- Nice tie.
- Thank you.

298
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:27,295
I found it at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art store in New York.

299
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,632
Its design is based
on the Golden Hoard of Bactria,

300
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:34,094
unearthed from the tombs of
Tillya tepe in northern Afghanistan.

301
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,805
I like the flowers...
or whatever they are.

302
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,216
Gotta go.

303
00:17:40,907 --> 00:17:41,767
Duck?

304
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,353
You looking for this?

305
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:46,440
You did sign it. Thank you.

306
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:49,943
- Yeah. Where you going?
- I just need some personal time.

307
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:52,343
A long weekend will suffice.

308
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:55,698
If anything comes up,
Mr. Palmer can deal with it.

309
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:58,034
If you need me,
I'm reachable on my cell phone.

310
00:17:58,424 --> 00:17:59,870
Duck, everything okay?

311
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:03,290
Yeah, never better.
Why do you ask?

312
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:05,751
Half my team's worried about you.

313
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:07,058
Let me guess.

314
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:08,626
Which half?

315
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:10,917
Abby and Ziva.

316
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:40,757
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

317
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:43,079
How you feeling?

318
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:46,212
I've felt better.

319
00:18:48,264 --> 00:18:49,961
- Who are you?
- That's a good question.

320
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:52,778
I can see you're thinking clearly.

321
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,759
I'm Anthony DiNozzo,
Special Agent with NCIS.

322
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,536
Like to ask you a couple of questions,
Lieutenant Mayne.

323
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,101
Bet you haven't heard that name in,
what, six years?

324
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,589
Listen, I don't want
to make you uncomfortable.

325
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:12,150
Is it better if call you
"Christian Wells"?

326
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,208
That got a response.

327
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,941
- I don't know what you're talking.
- Maybe you're right.

328
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,660
Maybe I'm just a little confused.

329
00:19:21,891 --> 00:19:23,205
I wouldn't be the only one.

330
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,470
Got two women out in the waiting room.
Both of them claim to be your wife.

331
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,230
Where did you go after Afghanistan?

332
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:33,751
What are you doing here?!
You're not supposed to be here!

333
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:35,355
I was trying to fluff his pillow.


334
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,818
Out, out!

335
00:19:36,902 --> 00:19:39,371
- Listen, I didn't do anything.
- You should know better.

336
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:41,513
Everything's fine.
She just, you know, I went by...

337
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:55,703
<i>What do you mean where am I?</i>

338
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,318
<i>Yeah, well,
I'm not happy about it either.</i>

339
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,941
<i>What do you want me to do,
work miracles?</i>

340
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,206
<i>I'm still parked
in front of her place.</i>

341
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:11,242
No, he still hasn't shown.

342
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:13,879
Hold on a second.
Agent David?

343
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,167
Dav-eed.

344
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:20,802
Look, I'll call you
the second I see him.

345
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:23,369
Then e-mail it to me, Joey.
I'll take a look.

346
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:27,601
Thanks for meeting me here.

347
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,145
I haven't left
this spot in three days.

348
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:32,939
Stakeouts are brutal.

349
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:35,384
So, what do you need?

350
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,401
Why were you investigating
Christian Wells?

351
00:20:39,164 --> 00:20:41,781
Come on.
We know you ran credit checks on him.

352
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,116
Why?

353
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:46,286
Client hired me.

354
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,174
Sorry.

355
00:20:56,093 --> 00:20:56,922
Not him.

356
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,299
So who hired you
to find out about Wells?

357
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,043
Guy had an Internet photo

358
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,481
of a marathon runner
crossing the finish line,

359
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:06,722
thought it was somebody he knew.

360
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:10,679
I ran his registration number
through the marathon's database.

361
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:12,604
Runner's name was Christian Wells.

362
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,420
Not the person
the client was looking for.

363
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:16,524
I tried to check out his finances,

364
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,175
didn't get anywhere.

365
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:21,071
Took ten minutes.
The easiest 500 bucks I ever made.

366
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:24,366
You should have dug deeper.

367
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:25,450
Why?

368
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:30,095
- I need the name of your client.
- Come on.

369
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,207
- It's privileged.
- Privileged? Are you a lawyer?

370
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:35,119
'Cause we're investigating
a shooting here.

371
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:37,379
It will be no trouble
for me to get a subpoena.

372
00:21:38,484 --> 00:21:39,722
Who got shot?

373
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,425
Can't talk right now.

374
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:44,302
What happened?

375
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,553
Give me a name.

376
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:53,520
The guy who hired me
was Gordon Holcomb.

377
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,940
Major Gordon Holcomb?

378
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:00,019
Think he was a Marine.

379
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:05,320
- Doctor, he's coding.
- He's in V-fib.

380
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:07,617
- I'm going to start compressions.
- Susan, bag him.

381
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,869
- Can I get the pads?
- Charge it up to 200.

382
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:11,871
200. Get those lines open.

383
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:14,079
- Okay, everybody, clear.
- Clear.

384
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:16,459
No response.

385
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,128
Continue CPR.
I page Dr. Tallridge.

386
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:21,112
- Give epi one milligram, IV push.
- One milligram.

387
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,137
Dr. Tallridge,
please report to ICU stat.

388
00:22:28,288 --> 00:22:29,718
What happened with my husband?

389
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,111
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mayne,
but you need to stay here.

390
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,276
Everybody, clear.

391
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,498
He's not responding, Doctor.

392
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,097
- We got asystole on the monitor.
- No change.

393
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:43,706
We've lost him.

394
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,868
Last month,
Major Holcomb hires a P.I.

395
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:55,604
to track down a guy he thought might be
Lieutenant Mayne, but yesterday,

396
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:59,610
he acts completely shocked when you tell
him that Mayne is alive and here in DC.

397
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,856
As much as I was thinking
one of the wives did it,

398
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,423
this guy's looking awfully guilty.

399
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:06,176
And now that Mayne's dead,
guilty of murder.

400
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:08,762
See, Mayne went MIA in Afghanistan,
he was broke.

401
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,062
He was, in '02,
making $3,300 a month.

402
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:14,460
Six years later, he's Wells,
and he's worth over $12 million.

403
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:15,690
So,

404
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:17,640
where did it all come from?

405
00:23:18,348 --> 00:23:21,274
Unfortunately, I can only trace
the money back five years.

406
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,810
It was transferred
from an offshore account in Neevis.

407
00:23:23,894 --> 00:23:24,611
Nevis.

408
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,448
- Freeze all his accounts.
- You got it, Boss.

409
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,492
It's dealer's choice.
Some people say Nay-vis.

410
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,744
Nee-vis. Ne-vis.
It's not really important.

411
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,407
What's your gut tell you on this?

412
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,211
That there's a connection with what
went down in Afghanistan six years ago.

413
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,771
You said Holcomb and Gontz

414
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:44,098
said the exact same words
to describe what happened?

415
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,299
Like they were reading
from a script.

416
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:50,464
Check with our agents in Kabul.

417
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:52,487
- See what they can dig up.
- Got it, Boss.

418
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,327
<i>Security desk.
We have a Major Holcomb for you.</i>

419
00:23:57,411 --> 00:23:58,991
Be right down.

420
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:02,107
Major Holcomb is in the lobby.

421
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,693
- Thank you for coming in.
- No problem.

422
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:08,560
Gave up on the stakeout.

423
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:10,557
The client wouldn't pay
for any more time.

424
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:11,734
Hope I helped.

425
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,784
I didn't really tell you
anything new.

426
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,327
You guys are really devious.

427
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:30,287
Iger Investigations.

428
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,937
So, why'd you hire the P.I.?

429
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:39,500
I was surfing the Internet.

430
00:24:40,157 --> 00:24:41,599
Came across a marathon.

431
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:44,845
Thought the runner
in that picture looked like John Mayne.

432
00:24:45,122 --> 00:24:46,973
So I wondered, could he be alive?

433
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:52,141
You spent $500 of your own money
to hire a private investigator.

434
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,736
You didn't mention that yesterday.

435
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,953
The investigator told me
it wasn't him.

436
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,676
So, when you saw the photo,

437
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:02,875
why didn't you call the police?
Why didn't you call us?

438
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:06,826
Look, I never came to terms
with what happened

439
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,798
on that op in Afghanistan.

440
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:10,400
One of my men was left behind.

441
00:25:10,484 --> 00:25:13,786
I knew the chances of that runner
in the photograph being Mayne was slim,

442
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,973
so I did not want to dredge everything
up with the Marine Corps again.

443
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:18,266
Trust me.

444
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,616
If that private eye told me
Mayne was alive,

445
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:22,395
I'd have come to you in a second.

446
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:29,423
Something is amiss.

447
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:33,855
You are even more of a mystery
than before,

448
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:35,200
Lieutenant Mayne.

449
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:44,652
So, this is the little rascal
I've heard so much about.

450
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,087
Mortimer, meet Dr. Mallard.

451
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:51,070
How about we set a play date
with your mom's corgis?

452
00:25:51,154 --> 00:25:52,967
He needs to be socialized
with other dogs.

453
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,165
We'll see.

454
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:57,296
Did you match the slug
from the Lieutenant's body?

455
00:25:57,846 --> 00:25:59,578
No. It was a .45.

456
00:25:59,662 --> 00:26:01,392
The gun they found was a 9-mil.

457
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,983
There was definitely a second weapon,
like Gibbs suspected.

458
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:05,373
I have an anomaly, too.

459
00:26:05,457 --> 00:26:07,077
Gibbs told me
that I should have found

460
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:09,108
that one of his legs
had been previously broken.

461
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,395
But that's definitely not the case.

462
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:14,906
- What are you looking at?
- Your tie.

463
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:18,289
My neckwear seems to be
a source of fascination.

464
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:19,452
Do you like it?

465
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:24,499
But you're Ducky,
and Ducky wears bow ties.

466
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:26,705
Change, Abby, change.

467
00:26:26,923 --> 00:26:29,641
The species must evolve and adapt.

468
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:30,832
Tell me, Mortimer.

469
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,210
They say
that it makes me look younger.

470
00:26:33,898 --> 00:26:34,968
You look adorable.

471
00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:39,569
I'm gonna take Mortimer to lunch 'cause
he needs to be exposed to restaurants.

472
00:26:39,653 --> 00:26:41,814
I heard about this new vegan place.
You want to join us?

473
00:26:41,898 --> 00:26:43,187
Sorry. I can't.

474
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:45,768
- How about tomorrow?
- I have something planned.

475
00:26:46,282 --> 00:26:47,556
Now, if you'll excuse me,

476
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,814
I have to call Gibbs and tell him
about the lack of a broken leg.

477
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:54,757
He's up to something, Mortimer.

478
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,290
First, my husband's missing.

479
00:26:57,374 --> 00:26:59,021
Then I learn he's been shot.

480
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:02,194
You and the hospital
won't let me see him. Now he's dead.

481
00:27:02,553 --> 00:27:04,935
And you keep insisting
he's someone he's not.

482
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:06,980
I know that this is hard
for you to accept,

483
00:27:07,434 --> 00:27:10,295
but the man you married
is really Lieutenant John Mayne.

484
00:27:10,936 --> 00:27:12,099
You say that.

485
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:14,674
- I refuse to believe it.
- Before,

486
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,572
we had a fingerprint ID.

487
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:18,846
Now, we have a positive DNA match.

488
00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:22,557
Oh, don't tell me they're releasing
Christian's body to that woman.

489
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,227
Ma'am, at this point, we're not planning
to release his remains to anyone.

490
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,855
This has become a total nightmare.

491
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,307
I tried to get cash out of the ATM
this morning, and was denied.

492
00:27:31,391 --> 00:27:33,422
The bank says
they've frozen all of our accounts.

493
00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:36,654
The man you married
was leading a fraudulent life.

494
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,600
Lieutenant Mayne's parents
are still alive.

495
00:27:38,684 --> 00:27:40,154
There was no inheritance.

496
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,036
How am I supposed to live?
Do I have to get my lawyer involved?

497
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,913
I don't know. You know what?
You do whatever it is you need to do.

498
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,747
Special Agent Sanchez, please

499
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:49,709
escort Miss Wells back down
to the lobby.

500
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,816
This way, ma'am.

501
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,819
I'm not going away, Agent Gibbs.

502
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:56,246
What'd you find out?

503
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,947
About the time Mayne went MIA,

504
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:02,505
an Afghan drug lord claimed
some Americans stole millions from him.

505
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:04,409
Maybe that's
how poor Mayne became...

506
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:05,808
rich Wells.

507
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,810
His teammates were lying
about his leg.

508
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,383
- Let's get them both back in.
- Hang on. Go to the cabdriver first.

509
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:12,315
- The weak link.
- He is the weakest link.

510
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,865
And I am on it, Boss.

511
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,834
They told me John Mayne died.

512
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:41,394
Why was he killed?

513
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,138
We think it had
to do with his money.

514
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:47,240
He had money?

515
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:49,156
Millions.

516
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:52,397
Any idea how he got it?

517
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,271
No.

518
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,115
We think

519
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,878
that it was stolen
from this Afghan drug lord.

520
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:08,955
Guy's been a guest at Gitmo
for the past six years.

521
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,497
Claims that he was robbed...

522
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,245
by Americans.

523
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,659
Come on, man.

524
00:29:32,316 --> 00:29:33,896
What happened on that op?

525
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:39,644
You help me, I'll help you.

526
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:48,109
Our mission was to plant sensors.

527
00:29:48,407 --> 00:29:49,120
We did.

528
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:51,981
On the way out of the village,
we took fire...

529
00:29:52,535 --> 00:29:53,708
from his guards.

530
00:29:54,716 --> 00:29:57,275
They thought we were after their money.
We took them down.

531
00:29:58,024 --> 00:29:59,259
And then we found it.

532
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:02,143
Oil drums.

533
00:30:02,642 --> 00:30:03,715
Five of them.

534
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,552
Full of cash, U.S. bills.

535
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:09,807
We left Mayne to guard the money
while we went in search of a vehicle.

536
00:30:10,397 --> 00:30:12,059
When we came back, he was gone.

537
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:14,555
So, when you were debriefed was

538
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:16,564
when you made up
the story about the leg?

539
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:19,442
We couldn't tell
anyone about the money.

540
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:24,030
All these years,
I have felt so guilty.

541
00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:26,949
The Lieutenant got captured
because we wanted that money.

542
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:31,517
And he's alive.

543
00:31:26,473 --> 00:31:29,488
So how long have you been involved
with Major Holcomb?

544
00:31:36,003 --> 00:31:36,879
Involved?

545
00:31:39,227 --> 00:31:42,928
After Gordon
returned from Afghanistan,

546
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:46,279
he came by the house to console me
about John being MIA.

547
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:49,160
He would just check
in on me every few months.

548
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,244
And then, three or four years ago,
his marriage started to fall apart.

549
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,818
And things,
they changed between us, so...

550
00:31:56,647 --> 00:32:00,159
When you came to the hospital
to identify your husband,

551
00:32:01,013 --> 00:32:02,265
you made a phone call.

552
00:32:03,484 --> 00:32:04,774
Major Holcomb?

553
00:32:05,413 --> 00:32:08,482
Yes, Leah Mayne called me
from the hospital.

554
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:13,590
Yes, she told me John Mayne
was alive before you brought me in.

555
00:32:14,211 --> 00:32:16,615
You didn't tell us you hired
a private investigator.

556
00:32:17,364 --> 00:32:18,920
When are you going to stop lying?!

557
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,816
I was just trying to protect
my career and marriage.

558
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:25,598
Now...

559
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,193
they're both over.

560
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,606
Gordon stayed with his wife for...

561
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:32,257
his children's sake.

562
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:36,250
And you kept collecting
your husband's Marine Corps pay

563
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:37,402
and allowances?

564
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:39,665
Yes.

565
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,876
You had no idea
your husband was alive.

566
00:32:42,386 --> 00:32:45,004
No. No. Not until you people
called me to the hospital.

567
00:32:45,272 --> 00:32:46,845
Where were you that morning?

568
00:32:47,191 --> 00:32:48,291
With Gordon.

569
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:52,428
I told my wife I had to spend
the night in Quantico.

570
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:55,973
Leah and I were
in a hotel in Falls Church.

571
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,858
I know you don't have
any reason to believe me,

572
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,413
but we had no idea John Mayne was alive
until you called her to the hospital.

573
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,733
Their alibis are solid, Boss.

574
00:33:05,914 --> 00:33:09,266
This was filmed just minutes
before John Mayne was shot in the park.

575
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,864
- The Major paid in cash.
- Of course he did. He's married.

576
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,534
And cell phone records confirm
that they were both in Falls Church.

577
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:17,787
You were so quick
to suspect the wife.

578
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:20,164
Still do.
He's got two of them and two lives.

579
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,540
Which life got him killed?

580
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:23,292
The little hottie one.

581
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:26,356
Knew about her husband's former life
and stolen money.

582
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,546
Don't you think?

583
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,590
She said she wasn't going running
'cause she had a

584
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:33,033
bum hammy, but she was strutting around
pretty good last time I saw her.

585
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:34,512
Let's find out where she was.

586
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,101
What about Gontz, the cabdriver?
He was the third man in Afghanistan.

587
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,687
Maybe he found out Wells was Mayne

588
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,647
and killed him
for double-crossing them.

589
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,485
No. No more rain.

590
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,320
Weatherman said it'd miss us.

591
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,698
What do you care about?
It's not going to hurt you.

592
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,784
It's going to hurt my wallet.
I just had my car washed.

593
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,307
That is why I never wash
my car in the winter.

594
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:01,916
That's a big mistake.
You got to wash off the deicing salt.

595
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,920
Otherwise,
it'll eat through the undercarriage.

596
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,528
Can you track the cell phone number
on this car and tell me

597
00:34:16,612 --> 00:34:18,456
where it was the morning
Mayne was shot?

598
00:34:19,044 --> 00:34:21,726
Peter Iger.
Iger Investigations. Sure.

599
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:25,521
- What's the matter with you?
- He lied to me.

600
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:28,065
Iger said he had not left
the stakeout

601
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,310
for three days.

602
00:34:29,394 --> 00:34:31,952
But his car was spotless
on the outside.

603
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,637
I could see my reflection.

604
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,056
Well, sorry, Ziva. Can't help you.

605
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,930
Iger's phone was turned off
that morning.

606
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:40,730
I do not believe it.
He is always on it.

607
00:34:40,814 --> 00:34:43,038
The man practically has
a wire growing out of his ear.

608
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,545
He would never turn it off.

609
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:46,876
Unless he didn't want to leave
an electronic trail.

610
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,811
Hang on a second.
His phone on now?

611
00:34:52,888 --> 00:34:54,884
- Yes, it is.
- Where?

612
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,441
Not far from here.
1200 block of M Street Northwest.

613
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:17,198
He's not here.

614
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:21,035
He's got to be around here somewhere.
I'm gonna call Ziva.

615
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,202
- What did Iger say?
- Iger's not here.

616
00:35:28,286 --> 00:35:29,710
Listen, could you go to my desk?

617
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,296
<i>There's a cell tracker
with Iger's phone on it.</i>

618
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,899
Just tell me where he is.

619
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,259
There is a laptop
in the passenger seat there.

620
00:35:37,357 --> 00:35:38,709
I'd love to get a look.

621
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:43,057
Well, his phone is
now north of M Street on Ridge.

622
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,351
Address indicates
it is a restaurant.

623
00:35:45,695 --> 00:35:48,312
All right. He's a block up,
around the corner. He's eating.

624
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:50,355
Perfect.
I'll get the Slim Jim.

625
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:52,608
No. What?
We don't have a warrant.

626
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:55,617
And I have a record, and besides,
a Slim Jim is very...

627
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:57,696
- It's very old school.
- You got a better idea?

628
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,477
Matter of fact, I do.

629
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,785
<i>I'm gonna put you on hold for 1 second.
Stay on the line, though.</i>

630
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:07,456
I built an application for my phone.

631
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,041
Why is that important here?

632
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,147
With a vehicle's VIN number,

633
00:36:13,402 --> 00:36:16,753
you can access
all the vehicle's pertinent information,

634
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:19,152
including key and remote code.

635
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:21,812
I hack into a database,

636
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:25,169
download all the codes,
and there it is.

637
00:36:26,277 --> 00:36:29,708
Well, I'm glad that MIT education
paid off for something.

638
00:36:30,885 --> 00:36:33,190
- It is pretty super, isn't it?
- I don't believe you.

639
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,484
Yeah, I'm not gonna unlock
the door for you, Tony.

640
00:36:35,954 --> 00:36:38,245
Well, I don't think
you could unlock the door.

641
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,406
'Cause if you could,
you'd prove it to me by doing it.

642
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,532
No, it does.

643
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,269
- Mine!
- No, Tony.

644
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:48,330
You should patent that.

645
00:36:52,506 --> 00:36:53,794
Ziva, where is he now?

646
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,047
He has not moved.

647
00:36:55,453 --> 00:36:57,047
What are they up to?

648
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:59,383
How do I get into his files?

649
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:02,093
- You can't.
- You know what? You're right.

650
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,846
You could get in, in ten seconds.

651
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,294
And then we'd be out of here.

652
00:37:05,526 --> 00:37:07,141
Come on.
I'll hold the phone.

653
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:17,693
All right,
files are listed by clients' names.

654
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:19,408
Major Gordon Holcomb.

655
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,613
All right. Done.
Give me this.

656
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:30,872
- I want no more part of this.
- Thank you very much.

657
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:52,574
It's exactly what you asked for.

658
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:55,044
They called me last night...

659
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:56,806
to tell me it was here.

660
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,221
You should be very pleased.

661
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:03,781
I missed you
at the opera last night, Mother.

662
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,299
Madame Butterfly.
All those melodies.

663
00:38:08,178 --> 00:38:11,011
One after the other.
It never ceases to amaze me.

664
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:26,902
When did she die?

665
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,488
Ducky, I'm so sorry.

666
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,287
I'm so sorry.

667
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:42,178
This is interesting.

668
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,863
It's an e-mail from a private lab
in Philadelphia.

669
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,781
Listen.

670
00:38:46,084 --> 00:38:49,076
"As you suspected, we have matched
the left thumb and index finger

671
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,703
"on the water bottle you sent us

672
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,331
"to First Lieutenant John Mayne,
USMC."

673
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,667
So, the P.I. knew Wells was Mayne.

674
00:39:00,651 --> 00:39:04,068
<i>Check with the ATF database.
See if Iger has a registered .45.</i>

675
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:06,815
You're going to tell me what's going on,
or is this, like, a guy thing?

676
00:39:06,899 --> 00:39:07,969
<i>Yeah. Later.</i>

677
00:39:08,894 --> 00:39:11,098
Why would Iger withhold
that information from his client?

678
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:13,951
Because if he tells him,
he only gets the fee,

679
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:15,519
which is a couple hundred bucks.

680
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,164
But if he withholds the information,

681
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,728
uses it to blackmail Mayne,
who is worth millions?

682
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:33,858
Iger owns a Smith & Wesson .45.

683
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,623
Great. Okay. Thanks, Ziva.
Don't go away.

684
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,754
It's too bad we won't be able
to use any of this information,

685
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:44,164
'cause you broke into the car, and then
obtained it illegally from his computer.

686
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,049
Criminal.

687
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:57,770
McGee, Iger's coming your way.
You better get out of there.

688
00:39:59,904 --> 00:40:01,101
What can I tell you?

689
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:03,949
I charge $100 an hour plus expenses.

690
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,094
You got my number, Pal.

691
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:11,619
NCIS, right?

692
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,286
You're making any headway?

693
00:40:14,555 --> 00:40:17,831
Well, as a matter of fact,
we wanted to ask you a few questions.

694
00:40:18,038 --> 00:40:19,540
Sure. Whatever I can do.

695
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:23,992
According to ATF records,
you have a permit to carry a .45.

696
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:25,463
Can we see your weapon?

697
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:29,497
I haven't carried it in years.

698
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,503
I sold it at a gun show.

699
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:34,932
That's good.
How about you put the bag down...

700
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,857
- Where do you think you're going?
- All right, all right.

701
00:40:44,189 --> 00:40:46,338
Come on. You don't have to do this.

702
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:48,862
All right.

703
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:52,474
So, did you try to shake Wells down?

704
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:55,702
Meeting in the park went bad,
didn't it?

705
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,148
It was self-defense.

706
00:40:57,598 --> 00:40:59,656
He had a gun.
He shot first.

707
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,292
The guy stole millions.
I only asked for 100 grand.

708
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,764
When were you going to tell me?

709
00:41:18,438 --> 00:41:19,722
Soon.

710
00:41:22,182 --> 00:41:23,883
I thought about having a service,

711
00:41:23,967 --> 00:41:26,606
but all of Mother's friends
predeceased her.

712
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,277
I...

713
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:29,817
was all she had.

714
00:41:32,077 --> 00:41:33,740
So, why keep it to yourself?

715
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,963
I didn't want to impose.

716
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:38,908
I'm surrounded by death, Jethro.

717
00:41:38,992 --> 00:41:41,874
I wanted to deal with the...

718
00:41:42,311 --> 00:41:45,200
personal loss by myself.

719
00:41:47,943 --> 00:41:49,965
Did you know
that she was almost 100?

720
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:53,544
And she had an active,
full life, but

721
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:56,293
this last year,
she has not been herself.

722
00:41:56,377 --> 00:41:57,677
It was her time.

723
00:41:58,623 --> 00:42:01,338
The natural progression of age.

724
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:05,063
You going to stay in the house?

725
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,900
The sale is pending.
We should close next week.

726
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,110
Those wretched little dogs?

727
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:13,739
I found a good home for them
with a corgi lover in Virginia.

728
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,366
What are you going to do?

729
00:42:16,627 --> 00:42:19,854
I've put down an offer
on a brownstone in Georgetown.

730
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:22,322
It's on the Historic Registry.

731
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:25,459
I've been working
with a charming real estate agent.

732
00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:27,303
Her name is Sophie.

733
00:42:28,787 --> 00:42:29,671
She's...

734
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:31,831
quite a bit younger than myself.

735
00:42:34,746 --> 00:42:37,968
So, I take it,
Sophie's the one that...

736
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:39,916
doesn't like the bow ties?

737
