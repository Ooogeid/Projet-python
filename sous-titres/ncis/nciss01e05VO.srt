1
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:06,051
What's this guy doing?

2
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,193
Oh, my god. He's out of control.

3
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:15,992
Turn-turn him over. Help me.

4
00:01:16,517 --> 00:01:18,870
- He's not breathing.
- Open his vest.

5
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,042
He's been shot!

6
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:26,421
Call 911!

7
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:29,064
I need some help. Help!

8
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,083
.: Team UnderCovers :.

9
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:50,026
NCIS Los Angeles
1x05 - Killshot

10
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,941
I'm still looking for a place.

11
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,851
- Could live on a boat.
- I tried that.

12
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:57,480
- When?
- When I moved back from Long Beach.

13
00:01:57,855 --> 00:01:59,952
Oh, come on.
That was on a dry dock, G.

14
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,638
- It hadn't sailed for over 20 years.
- It's still a boat.

15
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:04,791
I'm talking about a real boat

16
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,252
in a marina.

17
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,859
Ocean breezes,
morning jogs on the beach.

18
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:11,608
- You know someone with a boat?
- Renko has a boat.

19
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:14,258
Renko knows nothing about boats.

20
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,135
30-footer. Ask him.

21
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:20,097
- Morning, Kensi.
- What's up?

22
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:28,981
So, you finished filming me
with your cell phone, Dom?

23
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:32,118
How did you know I wasn't texting?

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,113
'Cause you kept checking
if he was looking.

25
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,485
Dead giveaway, Dom.

26
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:37,907
I took our undercover course.

27
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,313
You pass?

28
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,286
I'm a fully-qualified NCIS agent.

29
00:02:44,476 --> 00:02:45,665
Don't worry about it.

30
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,583
Still some things you have to learn.

31
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:51,772
With a knife closely pressed
against your ear by a bad guy

32
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:53,548
who is convinced you are a cop.

33
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:58,932
No, but seriously.
What happened to the other agent?

34
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:01,764
- The guy that I replaced?
- He had a problem with the weather.

35
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,266
- Too windy.
- Too hot.

36
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:07,178
Hot and windy dry desert
air type thing. Allergies.

37
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:14,026
They're still working
on your office?

38
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,646
- Know when it's gonna be ready?
- I don't know.

39
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,333
- Who knows?
- Hetty.

40
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,379
You want to ask her?

41
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,369
You're armed. You ask her.

42
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,284
You're the psychologist.

43
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:30,835
I've been trained to profile suspects
and brief you guys operationally,

44
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,238
with 3 years of college,
2 more years to get my masters

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,543
and my doctorate,
when it comes to Hetty...

46
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:36,651
Clueless.

47
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,804
Hi, Hetty.

48
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,957
I'll send them right up.

49
00:03:48,513 --> 00:03:50,438
Ops room.
You've all been summoned.

50
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:54,859
- Do you think she heard me?
- Probably.

51
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:04,033
The man on the jet ski is Daniel Su.

52
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:08,045
Two weeks ago,
his company received funding

53
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:11,625
from the Defense
Research Projects Agency.

54
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,209
Better known, mercifully,

55
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,369
as DARPA.

56
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:20,320
Mr. Su was shot.

57
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,655
He died on the way to the hospital.

58
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,890
There is great consternation
in the Pentagon.

59
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:30,048
SECNAV has promised swift action
to determine who killed him

60
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,304
and why.

61
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:34,857
They're afraid
it could be the North Koreans.

62
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:38,569
Mr. Su defected
from there five years ago.

63
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:42,657
This is all in the file.
Let me know what you require.

64
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:49,622
This is not the beach.
This is the office.

65
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:55,317
- Epic swell this afternoon.
- Living dangerously, Eric.

66
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:58,795
- File's up.
- Thank you.

67
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:03,260
So, why would the North Koreans wait
five years before coming after this guy?

68
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,137
The DARPA contract, probably.

69
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:06,953
Made him more visible.

70
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:09,141
He was an electronics engineer.

71
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,339
Single. Just bought
a house in Koreatown.

72
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,230
One brother... Jimmy Su.

73
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:17,984
He has his doctorate
in engineering and applied sciences.

74
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,821
Working on a lightweight squad-based
communication system for the Marine.

75
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:25,957
It's interesting. He rented a jet ski
from the same place at the same time

76
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:28,202
every Monday, Thursday
and Saturday morning.

77
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,936
- Creature of habit.
- And somebody knew it.

78
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:34,359
They were waiting for him.

79
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,905
Is that a comic book you're reading?

80
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,289
No. It's a... graphic novel.

81
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,689
May I?

82
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:57,715
It's a commentary
on humanity's struggle

83
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,427
to differentiate between right
and wrong when...

84
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,740
the social fabric
of society is torn asunder

85
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:05,361
by technological change.

86
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:08,242
All that's explained in... pictures?

87
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:11,680
I would have thought
you could find something more...

88
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:15,047
stimulating to read on your break.

89
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:21,367
But personally, I'm clueless
about these things.

90
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:27,928
How is Dominic settling in?

91
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:32,641
Anxious to prove himself.

92
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,688
Aren't they all?

93
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:38,034
Does he know
the three agents before him

94
00:06:38,076 --> 00:06:39,648
didn't pass muster?

95
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,585
Best that he doesn't, I think.

96
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:12,647
- Daniel Su live alone?
- According to the file.

97
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:15,513
Home address
and the office address are the same.

98
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:16,760
It's a start-up.

99
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:18,437
Probably worked out of his garage.

100
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:19,943
No LAPD yet.

101
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,905
In and out, then.
Save the paperwork.

102
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,042
Upstairs is clear.

103
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:23,581
Clear.

104
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:26,589
Back door's locked.

105
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,720
Got a bloody lamp.

106
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,258
Got a body.

107
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:06,255
Victim is Sally Morris.
She was Daniel Su's business partner.

108
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:09,300
- Susal Technologies.
- She was the money.

109
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,556
Bankrolled Su's start-up
for a 50% stake.

110
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:13,301
Small company. Just the two of them.

111
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:16,183
With the DARPA contract,
all of that would have been changed.

112
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:20,871
Maybe it wasn't the North Koreans.
Could have been a business rival.

113
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,147
- Or a jealous lover.
- Check that. See if there was either.

114
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:27,900
Preliminary autopsy report
on Daniel Su.

115
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,192
Hot off the fax.

116
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:32,270
Bullet hit him high in the chest,
traveling right to left.

117
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,697
Missed his heart
by about a quarter of an inch.

118
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:37,910
His life jacket acted
like a compression bandage.

119
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,619
It slowed the bleeding,
but not enough.

120
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:46,607
Bullet path took
a downward trajectory.

121
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,665
Shooter was firing from above.

122
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:51,685
At a moving target on a jet ski.

123
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:55,337
Shooter's got talent.

124
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,249
A trailer park?

125
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:08,565
You want me to live
in a trailer park?

126
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,545
Talking about an RV.
One of those triple pop-outs.

127
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:13,255
It's like a mansion on wheels.

128
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:15,609
That way, if you want to move,
you can just drive away.

129
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:18,742
There have places all along the coast
where you can just camp out.

130
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:22,217
I don't know. I...
I think I like the boat idea better.

131
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,541
- I can just kind of sail off.
- Do you know how to sail?

132
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,313
That could be a problem.

133
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:34,260
This is where Daniel Su hit.

134
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:39,084
He rented the jet ski in the marina.

135
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,476
Came around
through the entrance there.

136
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:42,975
There's a speed limit.

137
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,132
Probably 5 miles an hour...
at the entrance.

138
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:48,063
- You'll need to know that if you sail.
- 5 miles an hour. Got that.

139
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,581
That's where our shooter made the shot,
while he was going slow.

140
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:54,542
He must've accelerated,
tried to make it back.

141
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:57,876
Nobody heard anything.
No gunshot on the videotape.

142
00:10:58,523 --> 00:10:59,523
Silencer.

143
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:02,287
Bullet goes right to left,
downward trajectory.

144
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:04,714
That's where I'd be.

145
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,988
Clean line of sight to the target.

146
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:10,812
Good concealment.

147
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,132
The mast is rocking.
The target's bobbing and moving.

148
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:17,460
That's a damn good shot, G.

149
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:28,007
East of the breakwater,
there's a security camera

150
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,419
overlooking the marina.

151
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,273
Going to need
to access that hard drive.

152
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:34,346
I narrowed it down
to the hour before the shooting.

153
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:37,601
Gives the shooter time
to get into position and settle in.

154
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:40,973
I would have carried the rifle
in a tackle box or a cooler.

155
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,385
Just another guy going fishing.

156
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:46,170
There's a guy
with a tackle box right there.

157
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:49,249
Walked right past the boat.
Strike one.

158
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:51,268
What about the guy in the hat?

159
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,538
He's going
in the opposite direction.

160
00:11:54,598 --> 00:11:55,716
Strike two.

161
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,304
That's him.

162
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:00,427
He's going towards the parking lot.

163
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:04,342
Watch... he's taking the long
way around, scope things out.

164
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:06,444
That's what I'd do.

165
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,310
He's in no hurry.

166
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,271
He's got another 45 minutes
before Su arrives.

167
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,565
Look at that. He's back.

168
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:17,714
All right, resolution is not good,

169
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:20,906
but now that we know
what our guy's wearing,

170
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,847
all we need to do...

171
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:26,954
All right, I got it. There's another
camera in the marina parking lot.

172
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,362
I'm accessing the hard drives
for the hour after the shooting.

173
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:33,543
You're not going to need an hour.

174
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,816
Five minutes after he made that shot,
he was in his car,

175
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:37,923
on his way home.

176
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:41,535
Good call. There he is,
three minutes after the shooting.

177
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:43,262
Zoom and enhance.

178
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:47,338
It's a woman.

179
00:12:48,044 --> 00:12:49,518
He's a woman... I mean...

180
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,993
- She's a woman.
- She looks Asian.

181
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:54,233
She is.

182
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:57,058
Her name is Lee Wuan Kai.

183
00:12:57,956 --> 00:12:59,023
And we...

184
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:01,407
are in a whole pile of trouble.

185
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:15,420
Lee Wuan Kai flew into Los Angeles
a week ago on a fake passport.

186
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:19,047
By the time her passport
was flagged by ICE, she was gone.

187
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,544
NCIS server, watch list,
Lee Wuan Kai.

188
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:31,052
These passport photos
are our best lead,

189
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:33,812
but she can
and she does change her appearance.

190
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:35,272
North Korean.

191
00:13:36,745 --> 00:13:38,753
She's a fanatical nationalist

192
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:42,196
who as far as we can tell,
hasn't been home in three decades.

193
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,781
She's an assassin in exile.

194
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:49,411
Based in Eastern Europe somewhere.
Do not underestimate this woman.

195
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:52,080
She will not give you
a second chance.

196
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:01,437
A local DARPA analyst is going
to brief you on the technical aspects

197
00:14:01,497 --> 00:14:03,366
of Daniel Su's DARPA contract.

198
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,634
Meeting is in 15 minutes at the safe
house. His name is Frank Davis.

199
00:14:06,975 --> 00:14:09,681
- Kai could be halfway home by now.
- But she isn't, is she?

200
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,975
This isn't technology that Daniel Su
started after he defected.

201
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:16,002
It started as a classified project
for the North Korean army.

202
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:18,962
Su kept a lot
of the software secrets under wraps.

203
00:14:19,022 --> 00:14:21,644
Kai will kill anybody she thinks
he shared those secrets with.

204
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:24,234
If they can't have the technology,
then nobody else is either.

205
00:14:24,294 --> 00:14:26,089
That explains
the Sally Morris murder.

206
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:28,367
DARPA's got a list of people
she might come after.

207
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:32,087
- He's got a brother.
- Jimmy Su... married, no other family.

208
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:33,972
He's refusing protection,

209
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:36,370
but he insists
on staying holed up in his house.

210
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,262
We got a couple of units out front.

211
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:40,756
This is one fight
Kai is not going to win.

212
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:46,068
I think he's met her before.

213
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:49,680
Yeah, and she won.

214
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,813
How's the lady
in charge this morning?

215
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:56,009
If I'd known you were coming, Leon,

216
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:59,477
I would have bought
some <i>Xiao Hong Pao</i> tea.

217
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:02,692
If I'd known I was coming,
Henrietta,

218
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:06,321
I would have bought you that Emilio
Pucci scarf you've always wanted.

219
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,534
You've been threatening to buy
that for me for ten years, Leon.

220
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:11,786
Eleven.

221
00:15:14,394 --> 00:15:16,590
Are you getting settled
into the new office?

222
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:21,169
I just bring it all with me.

223
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,855
It's not the outside that matters.

224
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,592
It's the inside.

225
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:32,471
That was taken
on the set for Inchon.

226
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,975
Olivier and I used to have the most

227
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:37,877
wonderful chats.

228
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:41,459
I was responsible for his uniform.

229
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,567
He played General MacArthur.

230
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,910
Korean war.

231
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,223
Funny, that...

232
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:49,990
given the current circumstances.

233
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:53,994
Is there anything you don't know?

234
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:59,405
Many, many things, I'm sure.

235
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:04,365
It's her, isn't it?

236
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:14,036
First met her in... Prague in 1984.

237
00:16:15,545 --> 00:16:17,663
Then in Tokyo seven years later.

238
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:20,246
Three times since then...

239
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,736
Sierra Leone,

240
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:25,755
Paris and New York City.

241
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,822
She left a body count every time.

242
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:32,724
I should have been
in that count in Prague.

243
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,744
I was green, I got lucky.

244
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,314
Is she your nemesis, Leon?

245
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,098
Only if she buries me.

246
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:45,863
Then we must ensure
that doesn't happen.

247
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:49,137
At least until you get your scarf.

248
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:56,223
Sally Morris arrives
at Jimmy Su's place for work.

249
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,763
She discovers Kai
turning the place over.

250
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:02,854
She tries to get away,
and Kai whacks her with the lamp.

251
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,008
It's a really odd weapon for a pro.

252
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:07,969
It was the first thing at hand.

253
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:11,113
- Crime scene analysis?
- Tomorrow at the earliest.

254
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,866
That's too long.

255
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,788
Lab.

256
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,671
<i>Ms. Sciuto, I hope
I haven't called you at a bad time.</i>

257
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:25,252
Hi, Leon. I'm just doing
an experiment.

258
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:26,906
What sort of experiment?

259
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:30,045
<i>With light... Well, dark, actually.</i>

260
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,685
<i>You know, though, technically,
darkness is the absence of light,</i>

261
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,563
so I guess it should be called
lightlessness. Don't you think?

262
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:48,692
Good luck with the experiment.
I need you to look at some spatter.

263
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,861
I love spatter.

264
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:53,545
<i>You're the expert.
That's why I'm sending it to you.</i>

265
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:57,014
<i>- Are you still in L.A.?</i>
- Yes, I am.

266
00:17:57,074 --> 00:17:58,741
<i>Would you say hi to Eric for me?</i>

267
00:17:58,971 --> 00:18:01,872
You can say hello yourself.
He'll send you the files.

268
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,622
So what am I looking for?

269
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,501
I'll be happy
with whatever you can find, Ms. Sciuto.

270
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:09,629
<i>- I need you on it right away.</i>
- I see the light.

271
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,049
That was a joke, Leon.

272
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:14,927
Here's Eric.

273
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:22,559
Is Leon in a bad mood?

274
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,062
- He wasn't, but he might be now.
<i>- Well, sometimes, he...</i>

275
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,775
grinds his teeth.
If you listen, you can hear it.

276
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,578
So the crime scene photos
are on their way.

277
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,852
So, what are the pertinent
and juicy details?

278
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:43,079
- Woman, lamp, lot of blood spatter.
<i>- Bedroom?</i>

279
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,748
Living room and hallway.

280
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:47,557
I guess you can't have everything.

281
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:50,462
All right, I will call you
as soon as I find something.

282
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:54,264
- Cool, see you, Abby.
<i>- One day, Eric, one day.</i>

283
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,512
Oh, god.

284
00:19:03,341 --> 00:19:04,909
What are we chasing now?

285
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:08,111
I'm trying to get a clearer image
of the car the killer drove

286
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:09,621
from the marina parking lot,

287
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:13,582
so I'm searching hard drives
of nearby traffic cameras.

288
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:16,530
We get her car, we get her license
plate. We get her license plate,

289
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,020
we might just be able
to figure out where she's staying.

290
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,138
- Keep at it.
- You got it, Leon.

291
00:19:21,922 --> 00:19:22,942
Director.

292
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,921
Frank Davis with DARPA.

293
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:35,574
- Are we being recorded?
- Do you like to be?

294
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:37,882
Absolutely not. Are we?

295
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:42,611
This is your safe house.
I just figured it was wired.

296
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,392
You don't want us to share?
Is that it, Frank?

297
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:49,199
This is a classified briefing.
It doesn't leave the room.

298
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,065
Shoot.

299
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,059
Daniel Su was very secretive.

300
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,863
We put it down to the fact he had
grown up in what is a police state,

301
00:19:58,923 --> 00:20:01,908
where sharing information with someone
could put their life at risk.

302
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,374
As a result, there were
certain key aspects to the technology

303
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:08,665
he was developing
that only he knew about.

304
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:10,375
He didn't share with you?

305
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:14,784
Now, that's embarrassing.

306
00:20:15,254 --> 00:20:18,216
I mean, I can see how you wouldn't
want this to leave the room, Frank.

307
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:24,343
Of course, under the terms of the DARPA
contract, that was all about to change.

308
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:26,433
Did Sally Morris know?

309
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:28,578
She told me she didn't.

310
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,559
She was a financier,
a businesswoman.

311
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:33,647
I have no reason to disbelieve her.

312
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,241
- Maybe he told his brother Jimmy Su.
- They defected together.

313
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:40,457
Jimmy married a US Citizen.
He runs an importing company.

314
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:42,843
He's not a scientist,
didn't go to college,

315
00:20:42,903 --> 00:20:44,701
says his brother
didn't tell him anything.

316
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:47,490
Daniel Su's technology
died with him.

317
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:51,372
Only problem is Kai
doesn't know that,

318
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,503
and she's going to go after anyone
associated with Daniel Su.

319
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:57,856
Why don't I trust that guy?

320
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:02,052
Because he's a bureaucrat, it stands
to reason you hate all bureaucrats.

321
00:21:02,518 --> 00:21:03,331
I do?

322
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:05,930
Yeah, all those foster homes
when you were a kid...

323
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,773
The way the people
used to push you around,

324
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,577
tell you where to go, what to do.

325
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:14,386
- You been talking to Nate?
- No, this is my theory.

326
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,276
Dr. Hanna, MD. Nice.

327
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:19,817
This is it.

328
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:29,831
Director Vance, it's Callen.

329
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,360
Director's coming online now.

330
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:38,475
Our DARPA guy thinks that Danny Su
took his technology to the grave.

331
00:21:38,535 --> 00:21:39,631
No one else knows.

332
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,435
- He's certain?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

333
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,802
Do you believe him?

334
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:46,222
He's a bureaucrat.

335
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,683
Sam thinks that I have
a deep-seated suspicion of them.

336
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:52,435
<i>I'm</i> a bureaucrat.

337
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:57,565
I don't have a-a deep-seated
suspicion of you, Director.

338
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,275
Well, I'm pleased to hear
<i>that's the case.</i>

339
00:22:00,915 --> 00:22:02,570
I think we should talk to Jimmy Su.

340
00:22:03,092 --> 00:22:05,111
G, that's his wife.

341
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,316
That's him.

342
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:10,662
We got Su on the ground.
We'll call you back.

343
00:22:21,518 --> 00:22:23,165
Gun! Roof of the mall!

344
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,468
Get down!

345
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,227
You pick up head over
to take a look?

346
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:35,719
I'm good.

347
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:55,957
Hey, Sam.

348
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,727
Yeah.
No, he just arrived.

349
00:22:58,382 --> 00:22:59,154
Thanks.

350
00:23:01,323 --> 00:23:02,505
Are they okay, G?

351
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:03,578
Yeah.

352
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:06,051
Anything?

353
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:07,422
Nothing.

354
00:23:07,994 --> 00:23:09,580
She even took her shell casings.

355
00:23:21,706 --> 00:23:23,568
Did your brother say
what he was working on?

356
00:23:24,017 --> 00:23:25,802
No, Daniel did not share things.

357
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:27,558
Everything was kept a secret.

358
00:23:32,485 --> 00:23:34,162
My country has come for me.

359
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,582
Her name is Lee Wuan Kai.

360
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:39,285
She's North Korean.

361
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,173
So, what happens now?

362
00:23:46,084 --> 00:23:47,842
We're trying
to neutralize the threat.

363
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:51,635
And... if that doesn't work?

364
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:52,764
I mean, what...

365
00:23:53,405 --> 00:23:54,557
what if this...

366
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:56,887
this woman gets away?

367
00:23:58,439 --> 00:24:00,396
The government
will offer you protection.

368
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:03,061
They have programs.

369
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:06,259
Might have to consider relocation.

370
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,547
New identity.

371
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:17,434
Daniel loved America.

372
00:24:20,288 --> 00:24:22,847
He said that one day
of happiness here was worth

373
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,397
a hundred days of sadness
in our home country.

374
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:29,563
I will not relocate.

375
00:24:30,683 --> 00:24:32,308
And I will not change my name.

376
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:34,889
Do you understand?

377
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:38,713
We get it.

378
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,801
I found Kai.

379
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,251
Traffic cam on the freeway on-ramp

380
00:24:46,293 --> 00:24:48,683
recorded her seven minutes
after the shooting.

381
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,157
She headed east. There is a nice bright
screen grab of her license plate.

382
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,712
Check it
against hotel registrations.

383
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:58,371
It's already up and running.
And we have a winner.

384
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,920
W.H. Hotel, West Hollywood.
Room 1805.

385
00:25:01,422 --> 00:25:03,174
Registered as a Kim Andrews.

386
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:05,353
Tell Callen to meet me there.

387
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,039
<i>W.H. Hotel.</i>

388
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:10,850
<i>57809 Broadhurst boulevard.</i>

389
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:12,484
<i>West Hollywood.</i>

390
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,550
- <i>Lobby.</i>
- Thanks, Eric.

391
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,185
You'll be safe here.

392
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:19,415
We'll talk some more.

393
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:24,600
Vance... We're gonna meet him.

394
00:25:30,636 --> 00:25:31,826
They find her?

395
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:33,385
Hotel, West Hollywood.

396
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:38,585
What?

397
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,663
They're going
all married couple on us.

398
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:44,171
They're kissing?

399
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:46,294
Fighting, Nate.

400
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:52,244
You're reading?

401
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:54,302
Trying to, without staring.

402
00:26:02,678 --> 00:26:06,009
And there's the catch right there.
In order to lip read, you need to stare.

403
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,931
Which is far too obvious.

404
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,525
Better?

405
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,083
She's not happy.

406
00:26:29,302 --> 00:26:30,355
He said...

407
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:31,964
"don't tell."

408
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,200
Don't tell?

409
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:40,188
He's saying that...

410
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:48,231
What? What'd he...
What'd he say? Did you get it?

411
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:49,513
Yeah, I got it.

412
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,234
What's he keeping from us?

413
00:26:51,731 --> 00:26:53,396
He knows his brother's business.

414
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:55,232
All of it.

415
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:02,287
Manager says Kai's not here.
I'm going to look in her room.

416
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:05,373
We're just pulling up
to valet. We'll be there in one minute.

417
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:07,009
Cover the foyer.

418
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:10,652
You got it.

419
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:13,425
You're right.
It is personal.

420
00:27:59,937 --> 00:28:01,179
<i>You flatter me.</i>

421
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:04,735
<i>The head of a Federal agency,
personally searching my room.</i>

422
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,186
After all these years...

423
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:13,319
<i>We finally get to speak.</i>

424
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:16,621
<i>You calling
to give yourself up, Kai?</i>

425
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,418
Eric, trace the call that's coming
into room 1805.

426
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:23,987
<i>It's Kai.</i>

427
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:27,529
All right, it's a cell phone
in the building.

428
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,329
Getting the GPS signal.

429
00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:32,293
Looks like the seventh floor,
south corridor.

430
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,512
<i>You never give up, do you, Leon?</i>

431
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:38,104
<i>Turn left now.</i>

432
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,842
Tell me I didn't pass you
in the foyer.

433
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:44,628
No, but close.

434
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,312
<i>You haven't changed much
since New-York City, Leon.</i>

435
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,273
<i>If you move to your right...</i>

436
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:54,107
<i>About 30 yards and closing.
Tell me...</i>

437
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,881
Are you calling for a reason, Kai?

438
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,860
Or just to catch up?

439
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,146
Something I need to tell you.

440
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,921
<i>What do you need to tell me?</i>

441
00:29:03,394 --> 00:29:05,481
<i>Eric, you're breaking up.
How close? Eric?</i>

442
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,444
30 yards and closing.

443
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:10,505
You're almost on her.

444
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,180
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

445
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,654
- Kai, are you still there?
- She's gone.

446
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:35,523
Why did she call?

447
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,288
To tell us she didn't kill
Sally Morris.

448
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:51,257
It's not the first time a bad guy made
a call to the investigating officer.

449
00:29:51,675 --> 00:29:53,423
The question is, do we believe her?

450
00:29:56,102 --> 00:29:57,617
I think I found something.

451
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,925
I ran a program
on Daniel Su's security system.

452
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:04,735
It was a sophisticated system

453
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:08,232
with motion sensors tracking
every corner of the house.

454
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:12,175
Now, 30 minutes leading up
to her death,

455
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,855
there was someone else
in the office with her.

456
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:18,349
I mean, the red and the blue spans,

457
00:30:18,682 --> 00:30:20,848
that indicates movement...
so, two people.

458
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,779
So, things get a little crazy...

459
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,700
as the intruder chases her
around the house. And then...

460
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,329
the intruder wins.

461
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:35,910
Which means she knew her killer.
Let him in through the front door.

462
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,755
Phone logs
for Daniel Su's home office.

463
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:42,339
Highlight calls by frequency
over the past 24 hours.

464
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:47,652
Okay.

465
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:50,878
Three numbers, all linked.

466
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:53,751
The primary number's
the home office.

467
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,061
More calls went back and forth
between it

468
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,773
and the two other numbers
more frequently than any others.

469
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,008
But he most frequent calls
were made between

470
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,954
- the two other numbers to each other.
- They have names, Eric.

471
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:05,962
Right.

472
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,330
Our friendly bureaucrat
and our victim's brother

473
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,332
have been real chatty over
the last four days.

474
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,656
- Planning something, maybe.
- Thanks, Nate.

475
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:22,487
Jimmy Su knows more about his brother's
technology than he's letting on.

476
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:24,940
Kensi read him talking to his wife.

477
00:31:25,577 --> 00:31:28,377
So, after his brother's death,
he went to visit the business partner.

478
00:31:28,456 --> 00:31:31,594
They had a...
argument over who owns the technology,

479
00:31:31,784 --> 00:31:34,183
argument gets heated, he kills her.

480
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,925
And Kai gets the blame.

481
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,436
We need him to admit
his involvement.

482
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,774
That's gonna require putting somebody
undercover that hasn't met Jimmy Su.

483
00:31:55,757 --> 00:31:56,642
Not bad.

484
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:02,262
The trousers are a little snug,
so don't plan to run anywhere.

485
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:03,999
Ear piece.

486
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:08,232
Put it in deep, we'll worry
about digging it out later.

487
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:15,412
The button on your left pocket
is a camera.

488
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:17,768
The button on your right pocket
is a microphone.

489
00:32:19,681 --> 00:32:21,230
And the duress word is...?

490
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:25,627
He who hesitates...

491
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,684
Is lost, Dominic.

492
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:30,729
In your line of work, dead.

493
00:32:31,422 --> 00:32:32,393
"Shadows."

494
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:35,134
And with the utterance
of that single word,

495
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:37,598
the cavalry will race to the rescue.

496
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:41,779
Let's hope
they don't get caught in traffic.

497
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:46,557
Sign.

498
00:32:50,112 --> 00:32:53,208
The uniform is new,
so try not to get any blood on it.

499
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:56,687
He's all yours.

500
00:33:00,076 --> 00:33:01,046
Make the call.

501
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:03,659
Dom...

502
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:05,631
You're going to be fine.

503
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,579
Sam and I will have your back.

504
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:16,548
Picture is up.
Jimmy Su has left the safe house.

505
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:19,030
She's still out there.

506
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:21,062
Yes, she is.

507
00:33:49,787 --> 00:33:50,688
That's him.

508
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:53,956
Here we go.

509
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,405
Okay.
What do you want?

510
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:04,134
Like I said on the phone.

511
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,143
I was the first unit to get
to your brother's house this morning.

512
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:08,838
Found the woman on the floor.

513
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:11,465
<i>She whispered a name
to me before she died.</i>

514
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:13,152
Thought you might like to...

515
00:34:13,778 --> 00:34:15,260
buy that information from me.

516
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:17,555
Whose name?

517
00:34:17,993 --> 00:34:18,758
Yours.

518
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:25,742
You guys, we got a problem.

519
00:34:26,662 --> 00:34:29,075
I attached an alert to Jimmy Su's
cell phone so we'd know

520
00:34:29,145 --> 00:34:31,902
if someone was trying to trace
his location. It just got tripped.

521
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:34,822
Someone else is out there.
A strong signal strength.

522
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:37,658
Abort the Mission.
<i>There's an imminent threat.</i>

523
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,536
- You don't know you're talking about!
- Dom, get him the hell out of there.

524
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:45,779
Cover me!

525
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,401
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

526
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,611
Get behind the car.

527
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,203
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

528
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,700
You believe him?

529
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:43,578
All right, sign him
into LAPD custody.

530
00:36:47,464 --> 00:36:49,066
Jimmy Su denies killing anyone.

531
00:36:51,695 --> 00:36:53,961
You're wondering
if I set him out as bait.

532
00:36:57,635 --> 00:36:59,099
He was well covered.

533
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:01,841
Yes, he was.

534
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:07,760
Ms. Sciuto.

535
00:37:07,932 --> 00:37:08,851
<i>Hey, Leon.</i>

536
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,454
Cool spatter.
But it's not all spatter.

537
00:37:11,825 --> 00:37:14,940
There are some smears
and some drag marks.

538
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,520
<i>A little bit of pooling.</i>

539
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,390
Anything revealing, Ms. Sciuto?

540
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,696
The lamp...
the lamp was revealing.

541
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,350
<i>$16.99 from Wal-mart.</i>

542
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:24,825
Made in China.

543
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,203
Not much of a lamp,
but a pretty efficient bludgeon.

544
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,123
Well, there's one more thing.
There's no prints.

545
00:37:31,465 --> 00:37:34,032
<i>Lots of smears.
There's this...</i>

546
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:36,461
this outliney thingy.

547
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:37,588
A what?

548
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,339
It's a partial outline
of the killer's hand.

549
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:44,327
Like I said, it's too smeared to get
prints off of, but there's a mark.

550
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,640
It's like the blood flowed over
and around the fingers.

551
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:51,907
There's two marks, actually,
<i>and they're really close together.</i>

552
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,957
What do you think made these marks?

553
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,070
Yes, she is.

554
00:37:58,917 --> 00:37:59,778
I will.

555
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:07,976
How long you been married?

556
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:10,279
Three years.

557
00:38:13,478 --> 00:38:15,460
Our forensics lab found
a bloody handprint

558
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,211
on the lamp used to kill Sally.

559
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,196
Our killer wore two rings.

560
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:24,576
Left hand.

561
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:26,719
Ring finger.

562
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,389
Sally knew her killer, Aimee.

563
00:38:35,477 --> 00:38:38,074
She let her in through the front door.
She stayed...

564
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,150
half an hour?

565
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,027
No...

566
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,520
You want to tell me how it happened?

567
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,571
Jimmy was the smart one.

568
00:38:56,577 --> 00:38:57,603
Not Daniel.

569
00:38:58,453 --> 00:38:59,837
Only the three of us knew.

570
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,820
Frank suspected he was signing
a deal with the wrong brother...

571
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,802
He was making a lot of phone calls
to Jimmy. He wanted to know the truth.

572
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:11,223
Jimmy doesn't care about the money.
He just...

573
00:39:11,854 --> 00:39:13,540
he just wanted to help his brother.

574
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:17,584
And I was with Sally this morning

575
00:39:18,228 --> 00:39:20,233
when she got the call about Daniel.

576
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:22,860
I told her the truth.

577
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,569
She was furious because Daniel
and Jimmy had lied to her.

578
00:39:26,746 --> 00:39:30,750
She was saying that she would have
Jimmy locked up and sent back.

579
00:39:31,756 --> 00:39:33,492
And she was shouting at me.

580
00:39:33,544 --> 00:39:35,708
She was shouting at me, and so...

581
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,735
The lamp was there.
I just picked it up.

582
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:43,261
And afterwards, you told Jimmy.

583
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,393
But they...

584
00:39:49,862 --> 00:39:51,847
they're not going
to send him back, are they?

585
00:39:53,234 --> 00:39:54,070
No.

586
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,001
No, they're not going
to send him back.

587
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:06,903
It's Vance.

588
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:14,870
Director.

589
00:40:16,253 --> 00:40:17,285
Director.

590
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:21,418
She bailed at the top of the ramp.
Half a dozen exits she could have used.

591
00:40:33,968 --> 00:40:35,428
She lost a lot of blood.

592
00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:38,642
She doesn't turn up
at a hospital by tonight...

593
00:40:39,377 --> 00:40:40,416
She's dead.

594
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:45,734
Agent Vail.

595
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,707
That's good work.

596
00:40:48,453 --> 00:40:49,530
Thank you, Director.

597
00:40:52,538 --> 00:40:53,484
Gentlemen.

598
00:40:58,046 --> 00:41:00,040
You know he doesn't believe it
for a second.

599
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:03,110
He's never going
to stop looking for her.

600
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,093
Even if he drives a stake
through her heart and buries her,

601
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:09,716
he's still going to wake up
in the middle of the night

602
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,785
wondering if she's hiding
under his bed.

603
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:14,445
Just... irrational fear, it does...

604
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:17,432
strange things to people, you know?

605
00:41:21,047 --> 00:41:21,798
Guys?

606
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:24,648
I think I lost the button.

607
00:41:24,868 --> 00:41:27,067
- You lost a button?
- The camera button.

608
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:30,345
You lost Hetty's camera button?

609
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,090
Where did you lose it?

610
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,205
If I knew, then it wouldn't be lost.

611
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,987
- It's got to be around here somewhere.
- We've got to find it.

612
00:41:43,426 --> 00:41:45,270
How could you lose
Hetty's camera button?

613
00:41:45,312 --> 00:41:47,577
- Just look under there.
- Okay, okay.

614
00:41:52,057 --> 00:41:53,488
Hetty's gonna kill me.

615
00:41:54,878 --> 00:41:57,643
