00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,141
There you are!
It's about time.

3
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,274
What took so long? You know I need
my coffee in the morning.

4
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:49,956
Well, next time, go yourself.

5
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,192
I was embarrassed ordering
a non-fat, extra-foamy,

6
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,011
added-shot hazelnut latte.

7
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:57,083
Crew's going to be here in ten minutes.
This thing going to be running?

8
00:00:57,143 --> 00:00:59,475
We're already two days behind.
We don't need anymore delays.

13
00:01:39,327 --> 00:01:41,516
Well, I don't understand.
Was something wrong?

14
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,149
Sure, Wednesday will be fine.
Can we do it earlier than later?

15
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:52,316
Great... 9:00.
Thank you.

16
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:56,756
- Strange.
- Is that for our benefit, McGee?

17
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,326
We supposed to ask what's wrong?

18
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:00,912
That was Polygraph.
I have to take another test.

19
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,747
You took your annual last week.

20
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:04,364
They want me to retake it.

21
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:07,376
You failed your polygraph?
That's not good.

22
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,314
No, I didn't fail it.
They said I have to take it again.

23
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:13,423
Why would you have to take it again?

24
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,179
Don't ask, don't tell. You didn't make
the mistake of coming out, did you?

25
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:21,431
- I don't have anything to come out.
- Stick to that story, McQueen.

26
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:26,530
It has to be some kind of mistake.
I'm sure it is nothing.

27
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:28,606
This could be a career-ender.

28
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,566
You better figure out
what you did wrong, how you screwed up.

29
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,113
Hey, boss, you ever fail
your polygraph?

30
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,281
Nope. Never took one.
Come on, got a dead body.

31
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:39,866
- Marine?
- Nope.

32
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,244
- Sailor?
- Nope.

33
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,570
Blogger.

34
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:45,289
Matt Burns.

35
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,125
Pond scum who's been kicking
our ass on Internet?

36
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:49,293
What happened?

37
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,087
Don't know,
but we're going to find out.

38
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:53,379
Duck, you need me?

39
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:55,715
It looks as if you're busy.
It can wait.

40
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:58,477
- I'll check with you when I get back.
- Anything I can do from here?

41
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,082
You still haven't been cleared
for field work?

42
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,519
I'm still waiting
for my status to be clarified.

43
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,146
Oh, sorry to hear that.

44
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:11,830
That would really make me mad.
Well, how about you?

45
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:16,362
Are you asking as a friend
or a forensic psychologist?

46
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,577
After what you've been through,
it must be really hard to readjust.

47
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,161
Especially bound to that desk.

48
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:28,708
But if you feel like talking,
you know where to find me.

49
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:31,877
Thanks, Duck.

50
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:14,301
Get all of it.

51
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:17,430
Got a print there, huh?

52
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,175
You're NCIS.

53
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,432
Nice scarf.

54
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,922
Really brings out
the color of your eyes.

55
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:34,022
Thank you.

56
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,708
Shouldn't be wearing on a crime scene.
Loose fibers contaminated the vehicle.

57
00:04:40,606 --> 00:04:42,448
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

58
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:47,369
- Detective Megan Hanley.
- It's your first crime scene?

59
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,169
Yeah, it's a rookie mistake.
We all made them.

60
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:52,624
This is Special Agent Gibbs.
This is Detective Hanley.

61
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,129
Matt Burns' death may be related
to our case. What can you tell us?

62
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:59,006
Not much at this point.

63
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,741
We know that he fell over the bridge
a little after 6:00 a.m.

64
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,886
He almost landed
on some city workers.

65
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:06,596
- He jump or was he pushed?
- They didn't see what happened,

66
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,011
but we found a shoe print
that doesn't match the victim

67
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:10,558
near the railing where he fell.

68
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:13,437
Boss, this is Detective Sportelli,
Metro Police.

69
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:15,822
- He's in charge.
- Special Agent Gibbs.

70
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,900
This is a little awkward.

71
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:21,904
Detective Hanley?
Do you know they're from NCIS?

72
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:23,997
- Yeah.
- What did you tell them?

73
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,065
I was just filling them in
on what we know so far.

74
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,327
Which doesn't sound
like much, Detective.

75
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,871
You ran the I.D. on the vic.

76
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,116
What did you say
he did for a living?

77
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:37,225
He writes the blog.
He's BeltwayBurns.

78
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:39,046
He was trashing NCIS.

79
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:42,258
Said they were involved in a cover-up
of a naval officer's death.

80
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:46,512
I wouldn't believe everything I read
on Net. We're trying to tie up a case.

81
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,099
Be nice to know
if the deaths were connected.

82
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:53,351
I have to maintain the integrity
of this crime scene, Gibbs.

83
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,395
I expect your cooperation.

84
00:05:56,747 --> 00:06:00,734
That includes investigating
the possibility of an NCIS cover-up.

85
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,029
<i>Lieutenant Rod Arnett</i>

86
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:15,624
<i>was a poster boy for the Navy.</i>

87
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:20,468
<i>A scion of New England bluebloods
and a star quarterback at Annapolis.</i>

88
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,255
<i>His tragic death at the age of 26,
in a weekend car crash,</i>

89
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,928
<i>on the Pax River
Naval Air Station was</i>

90
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:31,891
<i>investigated
by Naval Criminal Investigative Service,</i>

91
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,100
<i>which was quick...</i>

92
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,645
<i>- to declare the death an accident.</i>
- It was an accident.

93
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,146
Jackass.

94
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,523
<i>My source
from within the Pentagon says</i>

95
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,860
<i>NCIS is covering up the true story.</i>

96
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:47,697
<i>Lieutenant Arnett was involved
in insider trading from his position</i>

97
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:50,133
<i>as a public affairs officer
in the Pentagon.</i>

98
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:52,118
I can't take any more
of this whack job.

99
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,746
Go over everything
on the Arnett case.

100
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,791
There's a link between
Arnett and Burns' death?

101
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,585
You have to find out. You're not going
to get any help on this from Metro.

102
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,432
Why do get the feeling that Gibbs and
Sportelli are going to come to blows?

103
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:05,608
- Who is Sportelli?
- He's the police detective

104
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:08,322
who made the mistake of tugging
on Superman's cape.

105
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:12,098
Take a look at Burns' last post.

106
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:15,408
"I'm about to meet a source who's going
to blow the story wide open."

107
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:17,853
- Who's the source?
- I'm working on that.

108
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,022
Back-trace Burn's IP address.

109
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:24,522
This was sent through a cell tower
near the bridge at 5:45 a.m.

110
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:26,247
It's right before his death.

111
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:29,198
Do you think Burns was killed because
he was getting too close to the truth?

112
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:31,992
Maybe he was knocked off
by someone else whose life he ruined.

113
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:34,357
There's a lot of 'em.

114
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:37,477
Judge Thomas Victor... This is
the one that put Burns on the map.

115
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:41,502
Because of Burns, the judge withdrew
his Supreme Court nomination?

116
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,505
He destroyed the guy.
Think I'll pay the judge a visit.

117
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,608
You be careful.
We're investigating Lieutenant Arnett.

118
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:50,000
Burns is outside
the purview of our case.

119
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,220
"Purview."

120
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,764
Did big bad Sportelli scare you off,
McGee?

121
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,022
"Press power, then reset."

122
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:11,342
Excuse me,
that's just what I did do.

123
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:14,910
- Got a new toy, Duck?
- Digital portable X-ray machine.

124
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,292
It's going to be very useful, if
I can just get the darn thing to work.

125
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,876
I'd like to have a chat with the people
that write these instruction manuals,

126
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:24,945
but I don't believe
we have a language in common.

127
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:27,506
You wanted to see me.

128
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,341
I wanted to check up on Ziva.

129
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:32,261
She went through far more
than we suspected.

130
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:35,452
I tried to draw her out,
but she doesn't want to talk.

131
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:38,767
I was wondering,
has she said anything to you?

132
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:44,185
She will when she's ready.

133
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:46,484
Something else?

134
00:08:47,446 --> 00:08:48,611
Lieutenant Arnett.

135
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:52,406
I need you to review
your autopsy file.

136
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,617
Pressure from the director?

137
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,994
Abby's reviewing
the physical evidence.

138
00:08:57,434 --> 00:08:58,954
Got to make sure we're right.

139
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,723
- So when'd you hear about Burns?
- This morning.

140
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,337
Haven't stopped smiling since.

141
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:08,047
Yeah, I can understand that.

142
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:10,883
Before that rodent
crawled into my life,

143
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:13,635
I was a respected
Federal court judge,

144
00:09:13,982 --> 00:09:15,763
nominated to the Supreme Court.

145
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:19,433
Now, I teach business law
at community college.

146
00:09:20,536 --> 00:09:22,895
These kids can barely read,
let alone write. Look at this.

147
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,024
Who spells justice J-U-S-T-I-S-S?

148
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,487
Burns accused you of plagiarism.

149
00:09:33,461 --> 00:09:34,823
Was that charge true?

150
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,118
In preparing a speech,

151
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,537
I borrowed some phrases
from a book I read.

152
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,629
Burns called it "plagiarism".

153
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,876
And he was right.
What I did was stupid.

154
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,087
But the nomination
could've survived it.

155
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:49,499
But...?

156
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:52,716
Burns was looking
to make a name for himself.

157
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:56,178
He accused me of infidelity,
taking kickbacks,

158
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,806
even went so far as to say
I cheated in law school.

159
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,851
They were fabricated charges
from unnamed sources.

160
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:03,914
It became embarrassing to me.

161
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,320
And to the administration.

162
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,816
I withdrew my nomination.

163
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:11,443
I'm going to have to get back
to you about that. 

164
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,446
Aren't you going to ask me where I was
this morning, when Burns died?

165
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:16,740
I'll leave
that to the Metro detectives.

166
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,534
- What's his name?
- Agent DiNozzo.

167
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:21,827
What are you doing here?

168
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,552
- See ya!
- Get outta here!

169
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:28,709
The minute I heard about Matt Burns
taking the header,

170
00:10:29,057 --> 00:10:31,419
I knew you'd be calling us back in.

171
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:36,790
Well, SECNAV is all over us
to clean this mess up.

172
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:39,847
You were Arnett's CO.

173
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:41,731
You saw no hint...

174
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,340
of insider trading?

175
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:45,146
It doesn't make sense.

176
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:48,102
Why would Rod Arnett
take a chance at being caught?

177
00:10:48,305 --> 00:10:51,100
He had family money,
unlimited future.

178
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,861
He was young,
drove his sports car like a madman.

179
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:55,738
It was a car accident.

180
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:57,906
We're going to have to dig deeper.

181
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,243
Lieutenant Summers,
you were his project officer.

182
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,872
- Did you ever ride with him?
- Yes, sir.

183
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:06,471
Once.

184
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:08,834
He did drive pretty fast.

185
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:11,795
What about Arnett's future?
Was it Navy?

186
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,464
His tour was over in a few months.

187
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:17,259
He was fielding job offers
that Harvard MBAs would envy.

188
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,261
- How about his social life?
- Don't know.

189
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,518
Never saw him outside the office.

190
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:23,820
Lieutenant,
you know who he was close with?

191
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:27,603
Not... really.
We talked in the office.

192
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:30,624
But I have no idea who his friends were
or anything like that.

193
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,765
Okay, explain to me
why we're doing this again?

194
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,946
What exactly does Gibbs
expect me to find?

195
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:40,403
You know Susan Grady
in Polygraph, right?

196
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:43,006
I did a metal stress test
on the steering wheel

197
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:45,175
and the suspension mechanism.
Negative.

198
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,164
The computer analysis of the ECU,
it recorded the vehicle pushing

199
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,395
6,500 Rpms at 110 miles-an-hour
when it rolled.

200
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,013
You know Grady well enough to call
and find out why I'm retaking my test?

201
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:57,216
I already did a computer
accident reconstruction...

202
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,489
I was truthful,
I was completely relaxed...

203
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,410
based on the skid marks...

204
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,004
- I was honest. I have no reason to lie.
- And the victim's body.

205
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:05,516
You're not listening to me.

206
00:12:07,323 --> 00:12:10,152
- This was an accident.
- I guess we've determined that.

207
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:13,524
But because
of that creepy dead blogger

208
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,520
who was spreading dreadful lies
about us, we have to keep going

209
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,433
over everything
that we've already done.

210
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:23,354
Abby, I'm really worried, okay?

211
00:12:23,414 --> 00:12:26,354
I've got to find out
what's going on with this polygraph.

212
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:28,122
McGee, I'm sure it's nothing.

213
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,268
Have you ever heard of an agent
having to retake their test?

214
00:12:33,717 --> 00:12:35,504
Special Agent Kirschner.

215
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,552
He was gone before you got here.

216
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:43,696
He was...

217
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:45,217
he was let go.

218
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,686
Your hunch was right.

219
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,891
Going over Arnett's phone records,

220
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:55,774
I tracked an unusual number
of calls to and from

221
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:59,570
Lieutenant Jessica Summers. Based
on the volume and times of the calls,

222
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,846
it suggests they were more
than just coworkers.

223
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:05,918
Fraternization in the workplace,
never a good idea.

224
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:08,526
The calls stopped abruptly
about month ago.

225
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:10,664
That's curious.
Someone must have ended it.

226
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:13,167
Why'd she lie?
She said she hardly knew him.

227
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:16,077
I'll make the call.
Bringing in Lieutenant Summers.

228
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:17,958
- Tonight, DiNozzo.
- Aye, aye, Cap'n.

229
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,007
There's something else
I want to show you.

230
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,920
I had nothing else to do,
so I started going through

231
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,511
BeltwayBurns' video archives

232
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:28,516
A lot of the facts in the stories
he has run are made up.

233
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:32,102
This is from July 23rd last year.
He was doing a piece on a congressman.

234
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,757
<i>Yesterday morning, I met in Atlanta</i>

235
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:39,742
<i>with a member of the congressman's staff
who told me of the assignation.</i>

236
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,613
That is total salami.

237
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:43,619
Baloney.

238
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:47,753
At the time,
Burns claimed to be in Atlanta,

239
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,686
but his credit card records show
that he was in DC,

240
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,999
at the Willard Hotel bar,
having martinis.

241
00:13:58,658 --> 00:14:00,951
- Yeah, boss?
- Lieutenant Arnett's finances...

242
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:05,719
Well, his brokerage accounts only show
transactions from family trusts,

243
00:14:05,954 --> 00:14:08,272
and his one bank account
has the deposits

244
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:10,557
from his Navy lieutenant's salary
and nothing else.

245
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,420
If he had contact with any other
financial institution, I can't find it.

246
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:32,501
You lied.

247
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:37,768
So you know about Lieutenant and me.
What else do you want me to say?

248
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:41,213
Who... broke it off?

249
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:42,178
Me!

250
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:46,537
Rod...

251
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,282
because he was...

252
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,887
seeing other women, and I found out.

253
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:53,767
Can I go now?

254
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:54,768
Sit.

255
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:58,063
No way, honey bunny.
He's not through with you.

256
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:00,607
She knows more than she's telling.

257
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,235
- I agree with you.
- So what do you think?

258
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,233
How's he gonna break her down?
What's the style?

259
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,781
He's leading with the "Creepy Uncle",
but I think he's gonna go with

260
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,085
- the "Father Figure You Can Trust".
- No, that doesn't feel right.

261
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:12,995
I am gonna go with the classic

262
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:16,185
"In Your Face Gibbs,
The Intimidator".

263
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,673
I don't think so.

264
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,378
You should know that we're working
very closely with Metro Police.

265
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:23,854
They have...

266
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,676
given us complete access...

267
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:31,368
to their files <i>and anything
that they have on Matt Burns.</i>

268
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,673
The old
"You Lie To Me, I Lie To You".

269
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,716
Didn't see that coming.
I like it.

270
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:39,600
We found notes in Burns' office
with your name on 'em.

271
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:46,188
Are you his Pentagon source?

272
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,449
And now our little bunny rabbit
doesn't know what to say.

273
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:53,449
He swore no one would ever find out.

274
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:55,187
Yeah, well...

275
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:57,331
he lied.

276
00:16:00,061 --> 00:16:01,376
Why'd you go to Matt Burns?

277
00:16:02,718 --> 00:16:03,936
I was hurt.

278
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,327
Rod had dumped me.

279
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,719
Wasn't returning my phone calls...

280
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:12,387
Arnett was trading
on insider information?

281
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:16,812
I think so.

282
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:19,754
You think?!

283
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:22,940
<i>I re...</i>

284
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:24,900
I remember...

285
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:30,060
the day after the press release
of the McAllister Industries' contract,

286
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,240
Rod came over with champagne.

287
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:35,027
And when I asked what was going on,
he said that he had...

288
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:38,176
he had made a lot of money
in the stock market.

289
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:41,416
I could read between the lines.

290
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,671
She just connected the two cases.

291
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:48,104
Arnett's death is looking
less like an accident.

292
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:49,700
Maybe Burns was onto something.

293
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,219
Which means
we blew the investigation.

294
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:02,555
I reviewed
Lieutenant Arnett's autopsy

295
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:05,134
as if I were an objective outsider.

296
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:07,499
First the photographs,
then the X-rays.

297
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,817
I brought
in a radiological consultant

298
00:17:09,877 --> 00:17:12,614
and had Abby redo
the blood and tox tests.

299
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:14,950
- What's more...
- Duck, bottom line?

300
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:16,478
Certainly.

301
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:21,373
Lieutenant Arnett's death
was accidental.

302
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:23,875
Multiple traumas
sustained in a car accident.

303
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,742
I think you're gonna want me
to take this. It's my counterpart,

304
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:31,349
om Hubbard, the District M.E.,
returning my call.

305
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:32,481
Hello, Tom.

306
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:35,887
Well, actually,
I'm in the middle of an autopsy.

307
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:38,598
I have to say that
or he'll talk my ears off.

308
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,767
What's that?
Metropolitan Police...

309
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:44,740
have classified Burns' death
as a homicide?

310
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:47,276
Thanks, I owe you one...

311
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:49,764
no, no, no, no old boy,

312
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,667
my lips are sealed.

313
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,281
You ever lie like that to me, Duck?

314
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,115
Never.

315
00:17:56,545 --> 00:18:00,066
If the cases are connected,
does that infer

316
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:02,998
- that Arnett was also murdered?
- We got our hands full.

317
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,487
Anything else you can do?

318
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,253
Well, if I'd retained
Arnett's brain, I could

319
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,978
perform further toxicology tests.

320
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:11,242
Why didn't you?

321
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,301
At the time, it wasn't warranted.
It was a car accident.

322
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:17,304
Look, for the tests, the tissue has

323
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,098
to be prepared. It takes ten days.

324
00:18:19,158 --> 00:18:22,171
The Arnett family was putting pressure
on the Director.

325
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:25,471
They wanted the body for burial,
and they wanted it intact.

326
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:27,272
- Unbury it.
- Jethro...

327
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:28,686
We need it now.

328
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:31,720
Get the Director involved.
Use the full extent of his office

329
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,594
to get the consent of the family.

330
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:41,340
How you doing?
Special Agent Gibbs and DiNozzo.

331
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,098
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

332
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:45,373
Benjamin Franklin,
Securities and Exchange Commission.

333
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:49,806
I know, I don't look
like an SEC investigator.

334
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:51,807
Is that really your name?

335
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:56,807
Yes. And I've heard
every imaginable joke, so spare me.

336
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,971
We've been receiving
the same kind of heat

337
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,461
you guys have since
BeltwayBurns broke the story.

338
00:19:02,656 --> 00:19:04,685
I headed
the investigation of Arnett.

339
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,829
If he was inside trading,
we couldn't find any evidence of it.

340
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,351
How's it usually work?

341
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,378
When a company is awarded

342
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:14,069
a multibillion-dollar defense contract,
its stock spikes.

343
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:18,115
If anyone has advance knowledge,
like Arnett did, they'd purchase an OTM,

344
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,116
that's an "out of the money" call.

345
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,912
Taking a bet that the stock will rise,
and it only costs pennies on a share.

346
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:25,885
A penny saved is a penny earned.

347
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,914
Now, we checked out
all the defense contracts

348
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:35,684
released by CUINFO in the past 12 months
that Arnett was in the office.

349
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,927
There was only one OTM
that showed any substantial profit.

350
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:40,637
- You got a name?
- Yes.

351
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,598
Nice bifocals, Ben.

352
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:50,466
An individual named Will Sutton.

353
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:53,668
Now, he made $2 million
on McAllister Industries' stocks.

354
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:55,321
What do we know about him, Ben?

355
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:57,450
Doesn't make any sense.

356
00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:01,074
He owns a small sandwich shop
in the Adams Morgan District.

357
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:04,661
We've had the guy under a microscope,
but we can't find a connection

358
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:08,665
between him, Arnett, the Navy or
any other source of inside information.

359
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,213
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- <i>Gibbs, I need you to come down here...</i>

360
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,507
Abs, slow down.
I'll be right there.

361
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:20,719
Get the information on Sutton.

362
00:20:25,552 --> 00:20:26,433
Oh, dear.

363
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:28,771
I only take orders from one person:

364
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:31,582
Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

365
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:34,742
Unless he asks me to do it,
it doesn't get done.

366
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,110
I think that's gonna change, honey.

367
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,740
Gibbs, make this awful man go away!

368
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,433
What do you want, Sportelli?

369
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,952
All the physical evidence
from the Arnett investigation,

370
00:20:46,406 --> 00:20:47,495
including the car.

371
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:50,856
We're denied access
to your investigation,

372
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,168
and you get
all the evidence in ours?

373
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,378
Since I have a Court order...

374
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:56,748
yes.

375
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:09,509
Give it to him, Abs.

376
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:16,107
You're gonna have to sign
the chain-of-evidence, honey.

377
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:17,784
You know what? I'll take that.

378
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,532
I hope you can look your boss in the eye
and tell him you didn't blow it.

379
00:21:26,556 --> 00:21:27,861
- Hanley?
- Coming.

380
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:28,817
Here you go.

381
00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:35,835
I can understand
the SEC asking me questions.

382
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:37,504
Why the Navy?

383
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:40,311
We're looking into the death
of a Navy officer, Mr. Sutton.

384
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:42,093
What's that gotta do with me?

385
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,678
You made a killing
on McAllister Industries' stocks

386
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:48,119
right after they were awarded
a multibillion-dollar defense contract,

387
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,976
the dead officer we're investigating
may have been involved

388
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:52,481
in insider trading, so...

389
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:55,480
I get lucky on a legitimate investment,
and everybody's all over me.

390
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,191
You know, if I lost money,
nobody would give a damn.

391
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:01,069
I got a box of losing lottery tickets...
would you like to take a look at it?

392
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,406
No. So you've never met or heard
of Lieutenant Rod Arnett?

393
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:05,280
Nope.

394
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,322
Let me ask you a question.

395
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:11,329
If you made 2 million in the market,
what are you doing making sandwiches?

396
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:15,083
'Cause the SEC froze my funds

397
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,234
until after they finish
their investigation.

398
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,204
They haven't found anything,
they never will.

399
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:23,967
I tell you, I catch one lucky break,
it turns me into a nightmare.

400
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:26,819
I've had to hire a lawyer...
the guy's costing me a fortune.

401
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,139
He's gonna see more money
on this than I will.

402
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:32,795
That pastrami looks great.

403
00:22:35,341 --> 00:22:38,341
You know how many connections
I have found between Arnett and Sutton?

404
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:39,441
Zero.

405
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:43,419
I've checked everything.
I have checked e-mails, phone records...

406
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:47,331
Is that pastrami?

407
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,070
Can I have a bite?

408
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:51,828
This is my dinner.

409
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:54,998
- You can have the pickle.
- I don't like pickles.

410
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:56,291
I know.

411
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:02,464
These two guys couldn't be
more different. One was a rich kid,

412
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,249
the other dropped out
of high school to support his...

413
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:06,678
invalid mother.

414
00:23:06,738 --> 00:23:08,428
He makes a mean sandwich.

415
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:10,805
We got Arnett.

416
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:13,183
Academy graduate,

417
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:16,227
single playboy, jock,
part of the DC social scene.

418
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:18,120
Now, you've got Sutton:

419
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,899
married 15 years,
three kids, two mortgages.

420
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:23,401
Can't afford to live in the city,

421
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:26,151
so he takes the train each day...
an hour.

422
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,823
Come on, man, you know
I didn't have lunch today.

423
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,333
These two live 60 miles apart.
There is no discernable way

424
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:41,287
they have met
or have anything in common.

425
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,564
I hope you choke on that.

426
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,339
You know,
disinterment is considered...

427
00:23:52,571 --> 00:23:55,515
a sacrilege or taboo
by certain cultures,

428
00:23:55,575 --> 00:23:57,644
especially the ones
who bury their dead.

429
00:23:58,106 --> 00:24:01,145
Gibbs thinks
this is a necessary exception.

430
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,353
In Southern China, for example,

431
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,390
graves are opened
after a period of one year.

432
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,614
The bones are removed,

433
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:13,397
cleaned, dried, and put
in a ceramic pot for re-burial.

434
00:24:13,904 --> 00:24:17,144
The process is called <i>jiangu.</i>

435
00:24:17,347 --> 00:24:18,873
Exhumations are...

436
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,914
- disturbing.
- They are.

437
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:24,681
Fortunately, Lieutenant Arnett
has only been buried for two weeks.

438
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:39,876
Who would want to steal
Arnett's body?

439
00:24:40,774 --> 00:24:44,279
I don't know, but thank God, Matt Burns
isn't around to put it in his blog.

440
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,873
- Someone else'll fill the void.
- This is really gonna give

441
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:49,612
the conspiracy theorists a reason
to believe we're covering up a murder.

442
00:24:49,672 --> 00:24:51,880
It's gonna get worse
after I tell Sportelli.

443
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,404
Do you have to?

444
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,549
When was the last time
you saw Arnett's body?

445
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:57,370
The day after I did the autopsy.

446
00:24:57,989 --> 00:24:59,656
We released it to the...

447
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:02,083
Heavenly Glen Funeral Home
in Falls Church.

448
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,210
They picked it up.

449
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:06,852
On it, boss.

450
00:25:06,912 --> 00:25:09,606
Boss, I'm scheduled to retake
that polygraph at 9:00 a.m.

451
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,070
- I'll handle it.
- Thanks.

452
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:14,330
- Treat this like a crime scene, Abs.
- Right.

453
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:22,395
I'm looking for
Special Agent Timothy McGee.

454
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,564
He is out of the building
on assignment.

455
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:29,235
Tell him Agent Grady
from Polygraph wants to see him.

456
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,466
He missed his scheduled
appointment this morning.

457
00:25:31,526 --> 00:25:33,364
I will make sure
he gets the message.

458
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,707
We picked up Lieutenant Arnett's remains
from NCIS at 11:20

459
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,793
on the sixth of last month.
He was brought directly here,

460
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,713
where our mortician did a reconstruction
of the deceased's face,

461
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,965
which was severely damaged
in the accident.

462
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:54,946
We know. We worked the scene.

463
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:57,639
Well, that evening,
Arnett's immediate family had a viewing.

464
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:01,227
I thought our mortician
did a wonderful job.

465
00:26:01,444 --> 00:26:04,747
But they decided to have
the casket closed for the funeral.

466
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:08,243
It was sealed at 10:00 p.m.
The mortuary closed at 11:00

467
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:10,868
and did not open
until 7:00 the next morning.

468
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,166
How was the casket
delivered to Arlington?

469
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:16,449
In our hearse... first to the chapel,
then to the graveside service.

470
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:19,536
Any idea how the body
could have been removed?

471
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,065
- None.
- Who else has keys to the building?

472
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:26,112
Myself, my brother, who is also
my partner in the business, and...

473
00:26:26,721 --> 00:26:28,294
- our mortician.
- No one else?

474
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,093
Is there a security system?

475
00:26:35,752 --> 00:26:36,795
Of course.

476
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,636
Excuse me for a second.

477
00:26:46,056 --> 00:26:47,605
I got a text from Ziva.

478
00:26:48,027 --> 00:26:49,650
Gunmetal metal.

479
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:51,067
Nice.

480
00:26:51,582 --> 00:26:53,550
The polygraph examiner's
looking for me.

481
00:26:54,514 --> 00:26:55,726
I guess Gibbs forgot.

482
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:58,825
He's got a lot on his mind.
Hey, come over here for a second.

483
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:01,911
Come here.
I got an idea.

484
00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:11,325
What?

485
00:27:12,223 --> 00:27:13,047
Hop in.

486
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:15,093
- What are you talking about?
- Just do it.

487
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,577
- Why would I do that?
- I take your picture,

488
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:18,968
we send it to Polygraph,

489
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:21,229
they think you're dead,
you don't have to retake the test.

490
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:22,695
Tony, that is not funny.

491
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,478
They already think you're ducking them.
It's only gonna get worse.

492
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:32,229
I had totally forgotten about this,

493
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:35,446
but early on the morning of the seventh,
the security alarm went off.

494
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:38,026
I was notified at home
and met the patrol here.

495
00:27:38,086 --> 00:27:39,449
This is their report.

496
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:42,910
We searched the entire building
but found nothing missing.

497
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:45,449
Dismissed the incident
as a faulty alarm.

498
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,785
Went off at 2:10 a.m.
Security arrived on site at 2:30 a.m.

499
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,215
There's a 20-minute window where someone
could have removed Arnett's body.

500
00:27:55,983 --> 00:27:57,773
This coffin looks expensive.

501
00:27:58,266 --> 00:28:00,011
It is. It's top of the line.

502
00:28:00,237 --> 00:28:02,972
But it's, it's new.
You know, factory-made.

503
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:06,065
It has no personality.
Mine, on the other hand,

504
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,689
is like a Stradivarius...

505
00:28:07,935 --> 00:28:11,522
hand-crafted
by a Bavarian artisan <i>circa</i> 1870.

506
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,353
It never made sense to me
to spend a fortune on something

507
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:17,964
that's gonna be viewed for a couple
of hours and stuck in the ground to rot.

508
00:28:18,244 --> 00:28:21,445
Mine has and will continue
to provide me with

509
00:28:21,505 --> 00:28:24,222
hours of restful sleep and pleasure.

510
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:26,779
- Did you find anything?
- Prints? DNA?

511
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:31,179
In fact, all four plates
were meticulously cleaned with acetate.

512
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:33,190
How strange.

513
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:36,727
Why would someone take
such precautions

514
00:28:36,787 --> 00:28:39,175
if the coffin was gonna be buried
for all eternity?

515
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:41,833
Ducky, this is cosmic.

516
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:45,822
Two minds, one thought, that is exactly
what Gibbs said when I told him.

517
00:28:49,247 --> 00:28:51,551
Burns pushed for the Arnett case
to remain open

518
00:28:51,611 --> 00:28:53,564
by saying we made a mistake.

519
00:28:53,768 --> 00:28:56,361
He knew we would eventually be
forced to exhume Arnett's body

520
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:58,595
to prove his death was accidental.

521
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,305
And when it was found missing,
his blog site would explode.

522
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:04,320
And Burns would become a celebrity,
a regular on Anderson Cooper.

523
00:29:04,537 --> 00:29:07,745
And after that, Burns could say anything
he wanted to about Arnett.

524
00:29:08,153 --> 00:29:10,737
- Dead man cannot defend himself.
- You think Burns stole the body.

525
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,322
- That is what makes the most sense.
- I like it, how do we prove it?

526
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,712
Boss, I got an idea.

527
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,795
But I need to get a look
at Burns's car in police impound.

528
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:24,664
Like Sportelli's gonna
let us do that.

529
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:44,543
There it is.

530
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,326
I could take care of the video
surveillance... it's the canine patrol

531
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:52,457
- I'm worried about.
- Chillax, bro.

532
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:54,903
All these budget cuts
and economic problems,

533
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:56,627
they can't afford dogs.

534
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:57,643
Trust me.

535
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:07,638
Are you sure
that thing's gonna work?

536
00:30:07,903 --> 00:30:11,088
Yeah. It's my own personal
concoction of oatmeal,

537
00:30:11,148 --> 00:30:12,685
mayonnaise, carpenter's glue.

538
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:15,701
Perfectly simulates bird droppings.

539
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:17,586
Us grown-ups use
a different word for it.

540
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:19,021
Used it very successfully

541
00:30:19,081 --> 00:30:21,527
in the Chesapeake team paintball
finals last summer.

542
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:23,615
Paintball? Cool.
All right,

543
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,281
so that's the camera you want to hit
with your bird poop, McSniper.

544
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:34,790
Nice shot.

545
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:36,611
I'm impressed.

546
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,263
All right, let's go.

547
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,261
What's the matter?

548
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:48,971
You sure there's no dogs in here?

549
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,266
I don't see any dogs.

550
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:54,810
I don't hear any dogs.

551
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:56,831
So, no...
there are no dogs!

552
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:58,064
Come on.

553
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:02,880
Do your thing.

554
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,079
- All righty.
- Sure you're gonna fit in there?

555
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,164
There you go.

556
00:31:15,452 --> 00:31:16,249
Nice.

557
00:31:16,747 --> 00:31:18,489
That's like a yoga position.

558
00:31:18,704 --> 00:31:20,646
That's like a upside-down manatee.

559
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,888
Doin' it...

560
00:31:33,381 --> 00:31:34,517
Put this up here...

561
00:31:34,903 --> 00:31:36,269
All right, baby, come on.

562
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:39,605
This'd be a lot easier
if I could pull the nav system

563
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,118
and look at it in Abby's lab.

564
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:43,776
Been a lot easier
if Sportelli had just given us the car.

565
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,326
Okay. Downloading.

566
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,305
That sounds like a dog.

567
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:58,291
You're such an easy mark.

568
00:31:58,376 --> 00:31:59,750
You're such a child.

569
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,086
All right, we got it.

570
00:32:06,597 --> 00:32:08,801
- Get my tools...
- Dogs, McGee.

571
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:09,941
Dogs!

572
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:11,429
Yeah, right.

573
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:14,307
Real dogs! Get out of here, McGee!
Big dogs! Big dogs!

574
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,101
You said there weren't any dogs!

575
00:32:20,996 --> 00:32:22,315
Get to high ground!

576
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:31,866
It's like <i>Turner and Hooch!</i>

577
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,534
Or <i>K-9</i> with Jim Belushi!

578
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,044
Run away, McGee!

579
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,870
Down! Stay!

580
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,990
I don't have
the right shoes for this!

581
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,375
Over here!
Come to the fence!

582
00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:56,495
Come on!
Come on!

583
00:33:00,274 --> 00:33:01,956
There you go!
Come on up!

584
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,108
Got it.

585
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,489
Freeze!

586
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:12,615
Release!

587
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,117
Release!

588
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,437
So close.

589
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:17,654
I sent it to Abby.

590
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:19,163
Well done.

591
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,136
- Where'd you get those?
- Off links.

592
00:33:28,196 --> 00:33:30,115
Poor little Timmy...
he looks so scared.

593
00:33:30,338 --> 00:33:32,749
Why aren't you trying to bail
them out? I don't trust Sportelli.

594
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:36,156
- They'll be fine, Abs.
- They're probably crammed in some cell

595
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:38,432
where they're being tormented
by perverts,

596
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,348
- and addicts and murderers...
- You analyzed the data from car?

597
00:33:41,408 --> 00:33:44,230
I did.
It proves what Ziva suspected.

598
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:47,274
Burns was parked outside
the mortuary from 2:05 a.m.

599
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,747
until 2:19 a.m.

600
00:33:49,245 --> 00:33:51,454
They risked their lives
trying to get this information and

601
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:53,317
you're going to let them rot
in a jail cell?

602
00:33:53,377 --> 00:33:55,282
Where did Burns go
after the mortuary?

603
00:33:56,689 --> 00:33:58,552
Seneca Creek Park in Maryland.

604
00:33:59,566 --> 00:34:00,717
Thank you.

605
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,350
You're out!
Did you know?

606
00:34:03,637 --> 00:34:05,594
Director handled it.
Way above my pay grade.

607
00:34:05,654 --> 00:34:07,211
Don't get too comfortable, boys.

608
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,985
We got a search team to organize.

609
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:35,740
I just got a call from Tony.
After searching all afternoon,

610
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,324
They found Arnett's body.

611
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:38,909
Great.

612
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:42,325
That's all you have to say?
Your theory was right.

613
00:34:42,385 --> 00:34:43,831
Burns stole the body.

614
00:34:44,054 --> 00:34:45,992
I would be doing
cartwheels right now.

615
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,419
Let's go celebrate.
Let's get something to eat.

616
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,546
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.

617
00:34:50,893 --> 00:34:53,883
My friend's band is playing
at the Filibuster tonight in Georgetown.

618
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,219
Come on.

619
00:34:57,636 --> 00:34:59,930
Girls' night out.
It'll be fun.

620
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:04,309
I have something I have to do, Abby.

621
00:35:14,455 --> 00:35:15,252
See ya.

622
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:38,041
I'm sorry I missed
our appointment yesterday.

623
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,930
I came in early just for you.

624
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:42,063
Thanks.

625
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:44,408
I've been...

626
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,853
on a... on a case, under pressure.

627
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:51,315
You got me in trouble.

628
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:55,945
I'm a creature of habit...
I take the same train every day

629
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,239
and the regulars gave me
a hard time this morning.

630
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:01,283
They were worried
when they didn't see me yesterday.

631
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,668
I need to make an adjustment.

632
00:36:25,593 --> 00:36:27,005
That got your...

633
00:36:27,831 --> 00:36:29,058
blood pressure up.

634
00:36:32,788 --> 00:36:34,697
All right, let's begin.

635
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:39,177
I'm going to ask several questions.
Some will be for control purposes

636
00:36:39,356 --> 00:36:42,616
and appear irrelevant.
Please answer all questions

637
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,916
- with a simple yes or no.
- Yes, ma'am.

638
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:46,457
Is your name Timothy McGee?

639
00:36:49,057 --> 00:36:51,765
- Were you born in Bethesda, Maryland?
- Yes.

640
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:54,720
- Have you ever been arrested?
- No.

641
00:36:57,072 --> 00:36:58,072
Yes.

642
00:36:58,455 --> 00:37:00,458
Yesterday.
It was on the case.

643
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:03,781
- The Director...
- Yes or no?

644
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,170
Sorry.

645
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:06,826
Yes.

646
00:37:07,939 --> 00:37:09,475
Do you live alone?

647
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:10,919
Yes.

648
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,128
Are you in a committed relationship?

649
00:37:21,311 --> 00:37:22,321
Okay.

650
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:27,334
- Have you ever used...
- Hold on a second.

651
00:37:27,754 --> 00:37:28,754
What?

652
00:37:29,528 --> 00:37:31,601
You said that you take
the same train every morning?

653
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:33,614
You don't get to ask the questions.

654
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:36,449
- You ride with the same people?
- Yes.

655
00:37:37,684 --> 00:37:40,781
What are you doing?
Why-Why-Why are you taking...

656
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:42,525
You can't...
Excuse me.

657
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:44,799
We're in the middle of an exam.

658
00:37:44,867 --> 00:37:45,917
I gotta reschedule.

659
00:37:53,075 --> 00:37:55,546
So, the fibers on the uniform
Arnett was buried in

660
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,604
are consistent
with the trunk-liner carpeting

661
00:37:57,664 --> 00:37:59,456
of the make
and model of Burns' Sedan.

662
00:37:59,525 --> 00:38:02,321
Now, if I could get a look
at the actual car.

663
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:05,527
Abs, I need to see the inventory
of Arnett's personal effects.

664
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:08,980
- Got to know if he had a rail pass.
- Yes.

665
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:10,972
Did you record the serial number?

666
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
All right.

667
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:19,630
Boss, we know that Lieutenant Arnett
had inside information

668
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:22,880
on McAllister Industries' stocks,
we also know that Will Sutton

669
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:25,482
made $2 million the day
after the contract was announced.

670
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:28,009
The SEC tried to connect
both men, but they couldn't.

671
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:30,181
What if they took the same train
to work every day?

672
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,518
- They didn't live anywhere near.
- They don't.

673
00:38:33,018 --> 00:38:35,716
Sutton drives
to the Shady Grove station

674
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:38,224
every morning to take
the Red Line into the city

675
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:40,861
to his sandwich shop.
It's a 55-minute ride.

676
00:38:41,262 --> 00:38:43,166
Now, Arnett commutes
to the Pentagon by train.

677
00:38:43,226 --> 00:38:44,934
Gets on the Red Line at Bethesda.

678
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:46,722
If they were regulars
on the same train,

679
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,492
they rode to work
together every morning.

680
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:50,678
Okay. I accessed
the Metrorail data bank

681
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:52,782
and I entered Arnett's rail
pass number.

682
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:55,467
He boarded the Red Line at Bethesda

683
00:38:55,549 --> 00:38:57,581
at 7:20 every morning.

684
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,376
We need to get a look
at Will Sutton's rail pass.

685
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:21,887
You brought a friend.
Must have liked the Pastrami.

686
00:39:22,198 --> 00:39:24,932
It was delicious.
He's not my friend.

687
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,463
You take the Metrorail
to the city through Shady Grove, right?

688
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,105
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We need to see your rail pass.

689
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:35,741
- Why?
- You a Hitchcock fan?

690
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:39,540
You ever see the 1951 classic,
<i>Strangers on a Train</i>?

691
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:41,141
Farley Grainger, Robert Walker?

692
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:43,153
They meet in a club car,

693
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,264
plot to exchange murders: "you kill
my father, I'll kill your wife."

694
00:39:47,182 --> 00:39:50,782
They believed that no one be able
to connect them to each other.

695
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:53,258
You and Arnett were regulars
on the same train.

696
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:56,297
Got friendly, you came up
with the insider-trading scam.

697
00:39:56,572 --> 00:39:58,672
You knew if the SEC investigated,

698
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:02,264
they would never be able
to connect you to each other.

699
00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:08,424
After a respectable amount of time,
you'd split the $2 million profit.

700
00:40:08,964 --> 00:40:10,080
But you got lucky.

701
00:40:10,404 --> 00:40:12,288
Your partner died in a car accident

702
00:40:12,348 --> 00:40:14,554
and you got to keep
all the money to yourself.

703
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,774
You guys got quite an imagination.

704
00:40:16,842 --> 00:40:18,589
How about
you let us see your rail pass?

705
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,719
- How about I call my lawyer?
- Innocent guys always say that.

706
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:25,521
Your mistake was believing
Matt Burns' blog.

707
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:27,340
He was bluffing.

708
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:30,166
He only had a tip on Arnett.
He made the rest up.

709
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,580
But you bought it.

710
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:33,813
You panicked, you thought
Burns was on to you.

711
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:37,284
Anonymously contacted him,
said you had information,

712
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:39,170
arranged to meet at the bridge.

713
00:40:39,477 --> 00:40:41,416
- They're making all this up.
- Yeah?

714
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,650
Our good friends at Metro PD
are working very closely with us.

715
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:50,461
We've connected you to Arnett.

716
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:53,279
Once we give them your name,
they're going to connect you to Burns.

717
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,771
They're going to backtrack
every communication you ever had:

718
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,130
e-mails, phone calls, the lot.

719
00:41:04,058 --> 00:41:06,943
We wrapped the case for you,
Dan, show some appreciation.

720
00:41:07,605 --> 00:41:09,592
- I don't like the conditions.
- Come on.

721
00:41:09,672 --> 00:41:11,540
We're handing over the guy
who murdered Burns.

722
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,349
Least you could do is drop
the charges against my team.

723
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,309
If this case doesn't hold up,
deal's off.

724
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:21,021
You got it.

725
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,855
Take him.

726
00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:25,851
Hey, Hanley.
I'll escort you down.

727
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:29,191
Nice sweater.

728
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,726
Where'd you get that?
Stripes are nice.

729
00:41:32,273 --> 00:41:33,157
Boss...

730
00:41:33,363 --> 00:41:36,075
I better go down
and reschedule this polygraph test.

731
00:41:36,181 --> 00:41:38,328
Don't bother, McGee.
Nothing wrong with the first one.

732
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,319
What do you mean?

733
00:41:41,887 --> 00:41:44,160
I think you made an impression
on the examiner.

734
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,181
I think she made an excuse
to see you again.

735
00:41:51,147 --> 00:41:53,127
You want me to draw you a picture?

736
00:41:53,704 --> 00:41:54,704
No.

737
00:41:55,918 --> 00:41:57,493
I'm going to handle her, boss.

738
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,531
Being stuck at that desk has given me
a lot of time to think.

739
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,510
Being a visitor here is wrong.

740
00:42:10,587 --> 00:42:12,222
What does that mean, Ziva?

741
00:42:15,652 --> 00:42:17,158
I need your signature on this.

742
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,327
I want to be an NCIS agent.

743
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:29,060
I don't even know
if that's possible.

744
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,860
You would have
to resign from Mossad.

745
00:42:36,126 --> 00:42:38,899
Already have.
Sent my father an e-mail.

746
00:42:39,763 --> 00:42:42,740
- What's he think about that?
- Does not matter.
