00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,921
Crap!

3
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,190
Rob?

4
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,029
It's Liz, from next door.

5
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:44,522
Hello?

6
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:46,865
Rob?

00:01:35,677 --> 00:01:37,265
Thanks to Bruno !

www.Team-NCIS.com

11
00:02:03,169 --> 00:02:05,934
I don't speak Hebrew, but
I'm pretty sure you just swore.

12
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,414
What happened? Your Men of Mossad
calendar get lost in the mail?

13
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:12,487
Women of Mossad calendar
get lost in the mail?

14
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:15,820
If you must know, it was
an airline reservation that got lost.

15
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:17,509
So going to Israel?

16
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:20,059
Not if I can not get
a seat on the flight I want.

17
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,121
- What?
- Is it a what...

18
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:29,250
or a who?

19
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:34,927
Now you're speaking in a language
that I do not understand.

20
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:36,704
Weren't you just in Israel?

21
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:37,464
So?

22
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:45,372
What is it that is bothering you

23
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,459
so much, Tony?

24
00:02:46,645 --> 00:02:49,134
- Do I look troubled?
- As a matter of fact...

25
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:51,945
Are you getting so hot
and bothersome because...

26
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:54,809
you think I may be having
a little fun?

27
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:56,965
Yeah. Gibbs.

28
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:00,337
As you know,
people go on vacations all the time.

29
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:02,997
- Normal people.
- I am normal people.

30
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:06,338
You're normal people like the people
from <i>Ordinary People</i> are normal people.

31
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:07,438
Grab your gear.

32
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,461
Dead Marine.

33
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:13,168
Well, DiNozzo,
she got the bothersome part right.

34
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,664
Oh, my...

35
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:27,834
She's not evidence, Tony.

36
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:30,024
Just capturing
the scene of the crime, probie.

37
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:31,895
Poor girl does seem very upset.

38
00:03:35,243 --> 00:03:36,296
Catch or cut?

39
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:46,075
Go ahead. Cut it.

40
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,251
Glad the poor girl's not my neighbor.

41
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:51,351
Just walking in, helping herself.

42
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:54,330
That's because you're a woman,
who's on her way to Tel Aviv.

43
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,762
If you were a man...

44
00:03:56,547 --> 00:04:00,239
Well, let's just say I can understand
why the Lance Corporal was so...

45
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:02,911
generous with his...
tools.

46
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:05,717
Background, DiNozzo?

47
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:08,823
Liz Adler. 28 years old,
recently divorced...

48
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:09,883
The victim.

49
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:12,088
Sorry, I've...

50
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,862
That's Lance Corporal Rob Brewer.
I thought you meant...

51
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,734
Stationed at Quantico,
scheduled to go to Iraq in a few days,

52
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,989
has already served two tours there.

53
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:22,159
Lived alone.
According to Liz, the...

54
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:25,459
Next-door neighbor,

55
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,690
said that the house
belonged to his parents,

56
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,144
and Brewer moved in a year ago.

57
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:30,982
Nothing apparently
missing from the house.

58
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:32,372
No evidence of a break-in.

59
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:34,841
Safe to say he died of exsanguination.

60
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,966
- Bled to death.
- Four to six hours ago.

61
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,111
Somebody wanted
to make this poor fellow suffer.

62
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,919
Or talk.

63
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:49,210
Never seen anything like it before.

64
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:51,142
Rope?

65
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:52,392
Not the rope.

66
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:54,190
It's what's on the rope.

67
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,999
The mold, Gibbs.

68
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:58,576
The mold is fascinating.

69
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:01,478
Did you know there's over
100,000 species of mold,

70
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:04,688
which is why it's not very surprising
that I haven't matched it yet.

71
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,722
See these little conidiophores?

72
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:10,341
That means that the mold is
in the sexual phase of reproduction.

73
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:11,930
In a few days,

74
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,361
these little appendages will sprout out
from the center, and then...

75
00:05:16,588 --> 00:05:20,086
well, then, we all know
what happens next.

76
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:22,204
Are you enjoying yourself, Abs?

77
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:25,284
Yes...

78
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,905
But you're not.
Sorry.

79
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,471
I did better with the fingerprints.

80
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:35,269
Most of them were Brewer's.

81
00:05:35,395 --> 00:05:38,280
The bloody ones were from the next-door
neighbor that found the body.

82
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:40,950
But on the toolbox, mother lode.

83
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,037
Fingerprints belonging
to Brewer's old squad leader,

84
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:46,785
retired Marine Sergeant Jack Kale.

85
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:49,496
Guess how long he's been retired?
That's right:

86
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:51,689
three weeks.
Guess why he retired.

87
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,660
Not in a guessing mood.

88
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,538
Okay. When he got back from
his last tour of duty?

89
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:01,222
Sergeant Kale was diagnosed
with hypereosinophilic syndrome,

90
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,219
or HES.
It's a blood disease, Gibbs.

91
00:06:04,357 --> 00:06:06,514
That's why he retired
from the Marine Corps.

92
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,805
He had a bad reaction
to the medication,

93
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,332
and he got psychotic and aggressive.
I sent the info to McGee.

94
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:15,170
Thanks, Abs.

95
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,284
You can go back to your mold now.

96
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:22,420
You say the sweetest things.

97
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:23,676
Mepolizumab.

98
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:26,002
Yep.
It's spelled like it sounds.

99
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:29,161
Can you check the other store?

100
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:31,341
Spoke with Kale's company commander.

101
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:34,718
Says Kale had a reputation as volatile,
tough on his men.

102
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:37,072
- Probably even tougher on his meds.
- Where is he?

103
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:39,717
That's a good question, boss.
He booked himself into the Freemont Inn

104
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:42,061
near the base three weeks ago,
right after he was discharged.

105
00:06:42,121 --> 00:06:43,975
He stayed there six days
and then he's gone.

106
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:46,003
- Credit cards?
- Hasn't used them since.

107
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:48,330
No forwarding address,
no calls from his cell.

108
00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:50,508
Got some, boss. Kale's illness.

109
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:54,650
Well, I don't have Kale's illness,
but Kale does,

110
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,562
and he is taking a trial medication to
get rid of it, it's called mepolizumab.

111
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:01,322
It's classified as an orphan drug,
which is an FDA distinction.

112
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:03,921
It's basically created
to encourage the development...

113
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:07,838
Point is it's new.
There's only three people in

114
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:10,360
- the DC area taking part in the trial.
- Manufacturer.

115
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,253
Manufacturer ships it directly
to the users each week.

116
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:15,071
Just sent me a patient list.

117
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:17,205
And look at that, here it is.

118
00:07:17,265 --> 00:07:19,750
Jack Kale.
2388 Montague.

119
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:22,130
DiNozzo, you're with me.

120
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:26,893
On your six, boss.

121
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:42,278
No car.

122
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:44,340
Probably out on his daily torture run.

123
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,258
Two men, one armed.

124
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,442
NCIS! Freeze!

125
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:04,791
Easy, easy.

126
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:17,790
What the hell are you doing?

127
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:27,547
- There you go.
- There's gonna be payback.

128
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:28,709
Sure.

129
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,863
You lost a fight with a door.

130
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,474
I wouldn't try to get back at Gibbs.

131
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,265
Don't forget to ice that.

132
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:40,094
Because...

133
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,045
he's a key witness, the key witness
in a murder trial starts tomorrow.

134
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:45,984
- Still got to talk to him.
- Why?

135
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:48,084
Marine from his unit was murdered.

136
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:51,127
- Kale a suspect?
- I'll know after I talk to him.

137
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:53,451
- When'd it happen?
- Early this morning.

138
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:56,704
You got wrong guy. Kale been locked up
with us for two weeks, couldn't done it.

139
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:59,866
Then it won't hurt to ask why
his prints were at the crime scene.

140
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:03,629
Defense lawyers find out Kale's being
investigated, he'll be discredited.

141
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:05,346
Marine was tortured, Tobias.

142
00:09:05,564 --> 00:09:07,862
Kale might be able
to help us find out who did it.

143
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:09,758
Nothing official.

144
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:11,273
No tapes, no notes.

145
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,855
And it happens right here,
right now, in front of me.

146
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,122
Tough on a Marine?
Being cooped up like this.

147
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:39,967
Yes, sir.

148
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:44,639
I've already told
Agent Fornell everything.

149
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,463
What do you want to know?

150
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,602
How your fingerprints got
on Lance Corporal Brewer's toolbox.

151
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:55,685
My toolbox.

152
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:57,932
He's my friend.

153
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:00,132
I let him borrow it.

154
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:02,197
Why? What's going on?

155
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,522
Brewer's dead, murdered.

156
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:07,912
No.

157
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:10,904
Can't be.

158
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:14,478
Those tools, your tools,
used to torture him.

159
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,276
- Who?
- You tell me.

160
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:31,486
I have...
I have no idea.

161
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:35,157
All right, Agent Gibbs.

162
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:37,937
Interview's over.

163
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:41,761
What interview, Tobias?

164
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:44,240
Hey,
good luck with your investigation.

165
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,669
Who are you prosecuting anyway?
You never said.

166
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,107
No.
No, I didn't.

167
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:04,657
When we get back, want you to find out
about the case Fornell's working on?

168
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,047
Think he's hiding something?

169
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:10,364
I think they both are.

170
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:15,110
FBI sure has their finger
in a lot of pies.

171
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:18,687
Terrorism, drugs, organized crime...

172
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:21,057
Alec, what are

173
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:23,126
crimes that land people in jail?

174
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:26,019
No, the question is:
What are cases in court tomorrow

175
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:29,117
involving an FBI agent
by the name of Tobias Fornell?

176
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:31,442
What is...

177
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:35,604
US v. Captain Melville's
Fish and Tackle?

178
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:36,843
You are right.

179
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:39,429
The FBI does have many fingers
in many pies.

180
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:40,722
Captain Melville.

181
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:42,203
Wait a second.

182
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:43,772
Moby Dick.

183
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:46,056
Sounds fishy,
it's got to be a pseudonym.

184
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:48,110
Pseudonym?
Explain.

185
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:50,788
Sometimes the FBI will use a phony
name on a case if they're trying

186
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:53,047
to hide the identities of people
they're prosecuting.

187
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:54,805
And Fornell gave us nothing?

188
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,499
Well, wasn't in a giving mood.

189
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,811
Though he was generous enough
to give Kale an alibi.

190
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,683
You think Fornell would lie to Gibbs?

191
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:02,481
If he felt he must.

192
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:05,851
Says the woman's being evasive to her
friends about her "vacation" to Israel.

193
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:08,300
I am intrigued by how intrigued
you are by this, Tony.

194
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,683
And I am curious that you are curious
that I am intrigued. What's his name?

195
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:14,884
I do not believe I said
I was actually seeing anyone.

196
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:18,021
Although it would be very difficult to
go to Israel and not see anyone at all.

197
00:12:18,173 --> 00:12:20,637
- It is quite populated, you know.
- That's cute.

198
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:23,065
I don't see why you're having
trouble admitting this. You know

199
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,719
you were in Israel for four months.
Plenty time to hook up with someone.

200
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,754
In that amount of time, Tony would've
hooked up with several someones.

201
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,190
- What is it you really want to know?
- Depends, Ziva.

202
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,950
On?

203
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,386
On...
what it is you don't want me to know.

204
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,475
Sorry to interrupt you guys, but I
just got into the FBI's true name file.

205
00:12:38,535 --> 00:12:41,739
And look who is listed with
Captain Melville's Fish & Tackle.

206
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:44,786
- None other than Rick Azari.
- Fornell's big fish.

207
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,003
No wonder he's keeping
his cards so close to his breasts.

208
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:56,928
Torture as a device to bring about
a confession has been around since,

209
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:59,529
well, before the Middle Ages.

210
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:03,649
Back then it was considered a necessary
part of the judicial process.

211
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,292
Maybe that's how lawyers
started to get a bad reputation.

212
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:07,673
Perhaps.

213
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:10,902
But it's a nasty business,
especially for the lower classes.

214
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:12,543
A commoner

215
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,419
for example, was considered 

216
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,131
constitutionally
incapable of honesty in court

217
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:20,315
unless he or she were tortured.

218
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,362
Doesn't seem like a very reliable
method for getting at the truth.

219
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,280
Quite right, but, as you can see,

220
00:13:25,523 --> 00:13:28,017
the process persists to this day.

221
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:30,922
I had a very funny brush

222
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:33,196
with torture once in Edinburgh.

223
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,441
I performed an autopsy on a fellow

224
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,735
whose torturer had taken his entrails,

225
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:40,511
mixed them with oatmeal,
and made himself a haggis.

226
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:42,594
You done?

227
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:45,210
Yeah, well, I...

228
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,013
I now know

229
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:50,844
how Lance Corporal Brewer
spent his last hour.

230
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:54,195
Ragged cuts to his hands

231
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:56,408
and forearms.

232
00:13:56,612 --> 00:13:58,756
Probably using this half-inch chisel.

233
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:01,010
Defensive wounds.

234
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:03,879
He fought hard to get away.

235
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:06,496
Notice, however,
the pattern of these cuts.

236
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,676
Precise. Methodical.

237
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:12,270
The slashing designed to inflict
the maximum pain, but not death.

238
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:16,190
At first, I thought it was
the X-Acto knife.

239
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:18,139
I know now...

240
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:20,900
it was the trusty box cutter.

241
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:23,384
Poor lad passed out at some point.

242
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:25,870
I swabbed his nasal passages.

243
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:29,182
Abby confirmed the presence
of ammonium carbonate.

244
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:30,412
Smelling salts.

245
00:14:30,492 --> 00:14:33,137
They revived him and
then the torture continued.

246
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,621
Yeah.

247
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:36,788
This is the fatal blow.

248
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:39,065
A single deep puncture wound.

249
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,105
It breached the femoral artery.

250
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:45,425
They put the poor lad out
of his misery with a...

251
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:47,636
Phillips head screwdriver.

252
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:50,552
Torturer got what he needed.

253
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:53,109
Boss.
Found out who Fornell is going after.

254
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:57,908
Rick Azari. 53 years old.
Born in New York City.

255
00:14:58,101 --> 00:15:00,825
One of the most notorious criminals
on the East Coast.

256
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:04,769
He was a one-time protégé to Colombian
American crime boss Alonzo Torres.

257
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,878
After Torres was sent
to prison by the FBI,

258
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:09,292
Azari took over. He was 25 years old.

259
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:11,368
Lot of funerals the year
Azari took over.

260
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:13,956
And he ruled that way ever since.
Trial for murder

261
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:15,373
 twice, walked both times.

262
00:15:15,454 --> 00:15:16,875
Now the FBI has another shot.

263
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:19,009
Azari's being charged
for the murder of a drug dealer

264
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:22,141
by the name of Randall Carlson.
Kale was the only witness.

265
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:23,924
No wonder Fornell's protecting him.

266
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:26,490
Azari goes down for murder
if Kale testifies.

267
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,760
- If not...
- Azari walks. Again.

268
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:32,734
Boss, you're not gonna like this.
Just got an e-mail

269
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:34,789
from a friend
at the US Marshal's office.

270
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,226
The FBI has signed a deal with Kale.

271
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:38,314
What kind of deal?

272
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:40,115
Immediately after the trial, Kale

273
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:42,824
is going to be put into
the Witness Protection Program.

274
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:45,550
So even if he did murder Brewer,
we'll never know.

275
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,204
- Will be like he never existed.
- Just like Fornell wants it.

276
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,608
Can't believe Fornell
lied to Gibbs again.

277
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:01,670
Well, technically, he did not lie.
He just simply withheld information.

278
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:04,277
But why would one friend
withhold information from another?

279
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:07,655
Maybe that friend felt
it was the best thing for everyone.

280
00:16:08,422 --> 00:16:10,823
Best for everyone?
Or best for herself?

281
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,864
- Her?
- Or him.

282
00:16:13,457 --> 00:16:15,144
What are you doing, McProbie?

283
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,031
You writing Fornell's eulogy?

284
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:19,296
- I'm checking Kale's cell records.
- Why?

285
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:22,597
Because Gibbs is extremely pissed,
and I think that he would want me to.

286
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:25,879
What are you doing?

287
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:28,466
Whatever Gibbs would want me
to get started on doing.

288
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,769
Agent Fornell.

289
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:34,444
Where's Gibbs?

290
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:36,246
Upstairs.
Conference room. Hi!

291
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:38,916
Bye.

292
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,596
For a guy that's about
to be handed his head...

293
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:47,592
He seems to have it firmly
on his shoulders.

294
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:49,007
Calm before the storm.

295
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:52,921
Gibbs versus Fornell.
It's like Frazier-Ali or Rocky versus...

296
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:54,943
everyone.

297
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,578
Haven't seen that look
since I proposed to your ex-wife.

298
00:17:00,892 --> 00:17:03,440
- You got something to tell me?
- Spare me the drama, Jethro.

299
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:05,914
You know damn well I couldn't tell you
about Kale's immunity,

300
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:08,903
- not without risking my witness.
- Your witness may be a murderer.

301
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:11,821
Kale was in our safe house
at the time that Brewer was killed.

302
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:13,859
I'm pretty sure
we've already gone over this.

303
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:18,162
- Who was babysitting him? You?
- My men. Come on, Jethro.

304
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:22,659
Prints on an old toolbox? We both
know you don't have a leg to stand on.

305
00:17:28,076 --> 00:17:30,071
- And what's that?
- A leg.

306
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,990
Couple Marines
in Kale's former unit saw

307
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:36,174
Kale and Brewer arguing
outside a bar last month.

308
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:40,115
Two drunk Marines bumping chests,

309
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:42,001
- that's your case?
- The argument

310
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,776
was about a third Marine.

311
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:47,791
A PFC Michael Strauss.
Also in Kale's unit.

312
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,759
- You talk to him?
- Working on it.

313
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:51,428
He's on a four-day leave.

314
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:52,422
Well.

315
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:55,215
You got a medicated Marine
with an anger-management problem

316
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,830
and his prints at the murder scene.

317
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:58,672
What is it you're hoping to find,
Jethro?

318
00:17:58,805 --> 00:17:59,805
The truth.

319
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,092
What are you McDoing, McGee?

320
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,996
- - Working on Kale's phone records.
- Thought you already McDid that.

321
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,686
I did.
But as it turns out, all activity

322
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:15,221
on Kale's cell phone suddenly
stopped three weeks ago.

323
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:18,703
Well, that makes sense. That is when
he was placed into protective custody.

324
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:20,938
FBI probably gave him a clean phone.

325
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:22,107
We would have.

326
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,562
Which is why I've been trying
to breach the FBI's clean phone list.

327
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:27,779
So far, I have had no luck.

328
00:18:28,747 --> 00:18:31,153
You ever heard of a good
old-fashioned paper trail, McGoo?

329
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:33,989
'Cause that's what's
on top of your head right now.

330
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:36,683
I got Kale's phone records
of the last four years.

331
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:38,586
See that prefix right
in front of your face?

332
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,337
That is Boynton Beach,
Florida, my friend.

333
00:18:41,814 --> 00:18:42,852
Boynton Beach.

334
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:47,809
You know what they got there?
Sun, sand, old people.

335
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:49,615
What is your point?

336
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:53,799
Kale called the same number every
Sunday morning for the past four years.

337
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,197
- What do you think that means?
- His parents.

338
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,869
That's right. Mother.

339
00:18:57,942 --> 00:19:00,445
According to his file,
his only living relative.

340
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:02,988
You're right.
I will run her phone records and see

341
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:06,347
- if there's been a new number calling.
- I like to get to the bottom of things.

342
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:07,709
It's my specialty.

343
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:13,367
- I did a little research on Azari.
- School paper?

344
00:19:13,948 --> 00:19:14,951
I found out

345
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:18,161
you two go all the way back
to your probie days.

346
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,616
- 25 years.
- 26.

347
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:24,813
I knew Azari when he was only a kid,
no more than a lackey.

348
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:27,134
He was a wheel man for Alonzo Torres.

349
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:30,162
Until you brought Torres down.

350
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:33,301
That bust gave me a career.

351
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:35,321
Meanwhile,
Azari quietly took over the reins.

352
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:38,600
Killed at least five his first year.
Probably a dozen more since.

353
00:19:38,738 --> 00:19:41,665
It's nature of the job. You cut
one head off, another grows back.

354
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,026
I could have had him.

355
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:46,506
When I took down Torres, I could
have easily made a deal to get Azari,

356
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:49,853
but I underestimated him. I thought
he was a harmless little punk.

357
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,797
You made a mistake.

358
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:52,984
No.

359
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:56,395
Marrying your second wife
was a mistake.

360
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:57,504
This...

361
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:06,732
Azari's long overdue, Jethro.
I want this son of a bitch.

362
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:08,695
Yeah.

363
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:11,449
Even if it means giving
your key witness a free pass?

364
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:13,317
Do me a favor,
Jethro.

365
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,550
Stop digging.

366
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:21,979
I give my word Kale was not involved
in Brewer's death.

367
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,768
Is that what you know, Tobias?

368
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:27,840
Or is that what you want to believe?

369
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:31,648
I got it!

370
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,959
A new cell number's been calling
Mama Kale the last three weeks.

371
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:37,040
Okay, call the number back,
trace it, and...

372
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,604
Done and done.
It's registered to the FBI.

373
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:40,856
You have his call list?

374
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,717
I got something better.
I got his location.

375
00:20:42,777 --> 00:20:46,060
According to the GPS in Kale's cell,
he's not at the FBI safe house.

376
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,041
- He's in Arlington.
- The hell he is!

377
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:49,262
Put it up, McGee.

378
00:20:50,452 --> 00:20:53,608
Kale is where I put him. In our safe
house. Safe. He is not in Arlington.

379
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,929
That safe house on wheels, Tobias?

380
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:59,672
What the hell is going on?
Where's Kale?

381
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:02,417
<i>- In the bathroom.</i>
- No, he's not. I am watching him!

382
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:04,416
<i>- He went out the window.</i>
- Damn it!

383
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,315
- He's stopped. 109 Kent Road.
- PFC Strauss' apartment, Gibbs.

384
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:13,699
Let me know if he moves.

385
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:19,695
- It's probably best if we hang back.
- Same thing I was thinking.

386
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:21,089
Couldn't agree more.

387
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,387
<i>- Signal's still there.</i>
- Okay, got it.

388
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:33,467
Signal hasn't moved.
Kale's still here.

389
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:36,808
Don't even say it.

390
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:38,841
What? Through the bathroom window?

391
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:41,533
You never lost a witness?
Don't answer that.

392
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:45,861
Kale!

393
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:48,923
Stop!

394
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,519
Kale, what the hell are you doing?

395
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:07,880
Don't move.

396
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:11,669
I'm getting too old for this crap.

397
00:22:14,052 --> 00:22:15,318
I didn't do it.

398
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:17,625
You didn't do what?

399
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,283
In the bedroom.

400
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,511
Nothing like a good manicure, probie.

401
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,693
- This was nothing like a good manicure.
- Looks like he's pointing at something.

402
00:22:53,753 --> 00:22:56,728
Yeah, same thing. Everything else
in this room is pointing at.

403
00:22:56,788 --> 00:23:00,352
That his good buddy, Kale,
tortured and murdered him.

404
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,544
Why is Kale so intent
on killing his friends?

405
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:06,663
Maybe the meds he was taking
sent him into a psychotic rage.

406
00:23:06,805 --> 00:23:10,491
Or maybe his friends lied
to him about a romantic attachment.

407
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:14,437
Torture appears to be
the order of the day.

408
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,202
Looking for these, Doctor?

409
00:23:21,256 --> 00:23:23,812
Traumatic removal
of the fingernails from the...

410
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,478
first, second and third digits
of the left hand

411
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,464
and the second and third of the right.

412
00:23:28,712 --> 00:23:30,744
- That is just wrong.
- Yes.

413
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:32,318
In some countries,

414
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:36,160
fingernail pulling is a routine
interrogation technique.

415
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:39,249
Perhaps someone brought
the technique home with them.

416
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,333
Yes, well, it's not what killed him.

417
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:44,814
- He has a fractured cervical vertebra.
- Snapped his neck.

418
00:23:44,893 --> 00:23:47,882
Which no doubt interrupted
his central nervous system.

419
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:50,971
Try to close his mouth.

420
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,660
- Yeah, too much resistance.
- First stages of rigor.

421
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:59,501
Smallest muscles first.
Hands, feet, jaw.

422
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:03,659
Yes, it appears this Marine
is trying to tell us something.

423
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:05,607
But what?

424
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:10,163
Are you still sure this guy was in your
custody the night of Brewer's murder?

425
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:11,592
I stand by the word of my men.

426
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:13,655
Maybe you should stand
by the open bathroom window.

427
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:16,180
- Azari's trial begins tomorrow.
- That's a red-letter day.

428
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,972
The whole case hinges
on Kale's testimony.

429
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:19,906
- You can't have him.
- You want Azari to walk?

430
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:21,880
What's the prosecution's
closing argument?

431
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,707
It takes one murderer to know another?

432
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,639
Kale's not a murderer, boss. At least he
didn't kill Strauss. He couldn't have.

433
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,597
Strauss died at least four hours ago.

434
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,858
That's one hour before
Kale arrived at the apartment.

435
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:36,918
- I'm taking Kale.
- You can have him.

436
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:39,039
After I interrogate him.

437
00:24:40,753 --> 00:24:42,927
- Got that look, boss.
- Take him in.

438
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,818
- Got it.
- And don't let him out of your sight.

439
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:49,162
Told you to ice that, baby.

440
00:24:52,221 --> 00:24:53,607
- Here you go.
- What's that?

441
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:56,426
My locksmith.
He's really good with bathroom windows.

442
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:06,908
Move.

443
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:08,015
Now.

444
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,724
It's okay, Stefano.
He's a Fed.

445
00:25:11,263 --> 00:25:13,937
Harmless.
So, you're one of Fornell's boys?

446
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:15,715
Boys?

447
00:25:17,112 --> 00:25:18,114
NCIS.

448
00:25:21,572 --> 00:25:23,835
You won't have protection
like this in prison.

449
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:26,420
So, what brings you down here,
Mr. NCIS?

450
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:30,309
- Two dead Marines.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

451
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,763
- Yeah, you will be.
- Must be frustrating?

452
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:36,248
I mean, a whole army of suits like you
can't take down one guy like me.

453
00:25:42,522 --> 00:25:43,982
Back up.

454
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:48,420
- Am I intimidating you?
- No only one guy's ever intimidated me.

455
00:25:49,552 --> 00:25:52,693
- He's been in prison for 26 years.
- Well, you're gonna see him soon.

456
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:56,504
What, this case?

457
00:25:57,136 --> 00:25:58,601
There is no case.

458
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,779
I don't care what those witnesses saw.

459
00:26:01,087 --> 00:26:02,102
You got nothing.

460
00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:14,017
Yeah, boss. The preliminary
police report. I'm on it.

461
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:15,508
Right, okay.

462
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:42,131
You lose something there, Tony?

463
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,702
Just my ability to snoop around Ziva's
desk without anyone noticing anything.

464
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:50,280
Did she say anything specific
to you about taking a trip to Tel Aviv?

465
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:51,707
Yeah.

466
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:53,964
She did?

467
00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:00,387
So, what did she say?

468
00:27:03,524 --> 00:27:05,083
That she's taking a trip to Tel Aviv.

469
00:27:08,184 --> 00:27:09,831
Thanks for bringing me up to speed.

470
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,881
By the way, boss wants you to take

471
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:14,426
a look at the preliminary police
report of Azari's murder case.

472
00:27:14,821 --> 00:27:17,549
The slaying of that drug dealer,
Randall Carlson?

473
00:27:18,227 --> 00:27:20,934
- Why can't we ask Fornell?
- Because the case didn't originate...

474
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:22,646
... with the FBI.

475
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:26,085
Local Leos handled
the preliminary investigation.

476
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,461
Gibbs asked you to get that file,
didn't he?

477
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
Fine, McGee.

478
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:33,695
I was trying to delegate,

479
00:27:33,775 --> 00:27:36,058
but if you're gonna be too lazy
to take this responsibility,

480
00:27:36,118 --> 00:27:37,490
I guess I will do it myself,

481
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,916
as soon as I finish doing
what you're no longer seeing me do.

482
00:27:40,195 --> 00:27:41,076
Okay.

483
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,079
But you know
Ziva will kill you if she finds

484
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,653
out you're doing what I am
no longer seeing you do.

485
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:51,360
Then it's a good thing
you're not seeing me do it.

486
00:27:53,347 --> 00:27:55,258
- Hey, Abby-Normal.
- You got to see this.

487
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:58,845
I would love to,
but listen, I'm kind of busy, and I...

488
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:00,929
Look.

489
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:05,236
- Rope.
- It's not just any rope.

490
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:07,979
It's moldy rope.
And it's not just any moldy rope.

491
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:11,024
This moldy rope that was used
to tie up Strauss

492
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:14,611
is the same moldy rope
that was used to tie up Brewer.

493
00:28:15,035 --> 00:28:16,191
I'm sure of it.

494
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:18,503
Major Mass Spec is still chewing on it,

495
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:20,303
but I know he's gonna agree with me.

496
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,579
I just have to identify
the strain of mold.

497
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:24,579
That's pretty interesting.
Listen, I just have...

498
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,248
I'm pretty sure that it's a relative

499
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:29,292
of stachybotrys chartarum.

500
00:28:29,372 --> 00:28:30,940
I mean, relatively

501
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,505
sure it's a relative,
but you know how relatives can be.

502
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,633
I mean, I still can't believe
that my adorable little niece

503
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:39,844
is related in any way
to my stinky little brother.

504
00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:42,265
You need to put the mold on hold,
give the rope a little slack.

505
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:45,038
Boss wants us to take a look
at the original crime involving Azari.

506
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,517
The one Kale witnessed?

507
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,104
The one
Fornell is desperate to reel in.

508
00:28:50,466 --> 00:28:52,594
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know.

509
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,900
Phosphor? That's weird.

510
00:28:55,998 --> 00:28:59,563
Why would the dead drug dealer
have phosphor on the soles of his shoes?

511
00:29:02,548 --> 00:29:05,342
Why did you sneak away from
the safe house to visit Strauss?

512
00:29:05,402 --> 00:29:06,579
Could have just called.

513
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:08,749
I did.

514
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:11,888
- Didn't get an answer.
- Neither have we.

515
00:29:11,948 --> 00:29:13,169
Why did you go see him?

516
00:29:13,747 --> 00:29:15,130
- I was worried.
- Why?

517
00:29:16,827 --> 00:29:18,802
News of Brewer's death
would have hit him...

518
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,552
- pretty hard.
- They were tight?

519
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:22,470
- Like brothers.
- But you

520
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,165
and Brewer were a different story.

521
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:27,809
A couple of Marines overheard
a violent argument between you two.

522
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:33,561
It was nothing.

523
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:36,651
- Just a disagreement.
- About what?

524
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:37,777
Money?

525
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:39,468
Girls?

526
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:41,605
Iraqi war policy?

527
00:29:49,085 --> 00:29:50,085
Drugs.

528
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:51,385
Buying or selling?

529
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:54,752
Using.

530
00:29:56,145 --> 00:29:58,423
- Strauss had a problem.
- Strauss?

531
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,133
Then why fight with Brewer?

532
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:02,969
I tried to keep the lid on Strauss,

533
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:04,846
when I was his squad leader.

534
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,561
When I was retired,

535
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:08,183
that job fell to Brewer.

536
00:30:08,263 --> 00:30:10,393
You thought he was dropping the ball.

537
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:18,863
It's not easy walking away
from your unit, is it, Sergeant?

538
00:30:25,428 --> 00:30:26,428
No, sir.

539
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:28,661
You're still looking out for your men.

540
00:30:31,986 --> 00:30:34,355
Tell me what you saw the night
Randall Carlson was murdered.

541
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,877
Don't answer that.
Excuse me.

542
00:30:39,822 --> 00:30:42,382
This is an official interrogation.

543
00:30:42,463 --> 00:30:43,801
I'm aware of that, Tobias.

544
00:30:43,882 --> 00:30:46,703
Asking him
about the Azari case is off-limits.

545
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,224
If this guy's testimony
doesn't match up word

546
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,518
- word...
- Well, then, he better get it right.

547
00:30:55,012 --> 00:30:57,990
What did you see
the night of the murder, Sergeant?

548
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:02,205
I was walking out of the Red Arrow
Diner, walking west on High Street.

549
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:06,343
Where Randall Carlson, scum-sucking
drug dealer, is parked down the street.

550
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:08,659
Probie.

551
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,266
Sit.
Under that street lamp.

552
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,766
Why do I have to be the lowlife
scum-sucking drug dealer?

553
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:14,582
If the shoe containing phosphor fits...

554
00:31:14,662 --> 00:31:17,210
Then a car containing Azari and an

555
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,419
associate pulled onto Atchison.

556
00:31:19,653 --> 00:31:20,701
My ninja.

557
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:22,391
I'm Azari.

558
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,218
- Why you?
- Azari's got swagger, flair, panache.

559
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:27,578
But I'm the assassin.

560
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:29,689
Style over substance.

561
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:33,859
Thank you.
That's very understanding.

562
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:37,477
The Beemer pulled up
to a late-model Caddy. Azari got out.

563
00:31:37,764 --> 00:31:39,454
The other guy got out of his car.

564
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:41,062
- Carlson.
- Yeah.

565
00:31:41,893 --> 00:31:43,178
Azari approaches him.

566
00:31:43,454 --> 00:31:45,489
Says a couple of words,
makes a couple of gestures.

567
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:47,907
A moment later, Azari pulls out a gun.

568
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:51,285
Azari unloads his pistol into Carlson.

569
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,153
Then Kale saw it all from here.

570
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:55,052
No, back, far corner.

571
00:32:01,914 --> 00:32:02,914
Good view.

572
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:04,274
What else did you see?

573
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:06,843
I saw that lowlife take another life
without even batting

574
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:08,176
an eye. Isn't that enough?

575
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,761
You feel...

576
00:32:09,842 --> 00:32:13,136
so strongly about it, why did you wait
until morning to report it?

577
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:17,019
I was scared.

578
00:32:19,414 --> 00:32:20,645
Decorated Marine.

579
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,959
Three tours in Iraq.

580
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:25,236
Battled Taliban insurgents
in Afghanistan

581
00:32:25,317 --> 00:32:26,778
before that, and you were scared?

582
00:32:26,838 --> 00:32:29,489
You're 30 feet away.
Assuming a two-to-one scale...

583
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:33,118
Then Kale positively identified
Azari from 60 feet away.

584
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:35,380
Assuming he had 20/20 vision,
it's possible.

585
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,497
Not possible.

586
00:32:36,577 --> 00:32:38,673
It is anything but possible.
It is impossible,

587
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:40,678
which is what "not possible" means.

588
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:43,896
Kale...

589
00:32:43,956 --> 00:32:47,717
would have had to have had more
than 20/20 vision to identify Azari.

590
00:32:47,887 --> 00:32:49,427
He would have need night vision.

591
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:56,309
The phosphor on Carlson's shoes

592
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:59,395
- was from a broken streetlight.
- You could have just turned it off.

593
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:02,430
Yeah. Sorry.

594
00:33:02,956 --> 00:33:04,651
A punk like Azari shows you a handgun,

595
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,611
and all of a sudden,
you turn into a coward?

596
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:09,585
Yeah, you weren't scared.

597
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:11,991
You were protecting someone.
Who were you protecting, Sergeant?

598
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:17,239
Are you sure
the streetlight was busted?

599
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:20,195
I confirmed it with the City
Street and Sanitation Department.

600
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:22,460
There is no way Kale
could have seen anything.

601
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:25,338
Unless he was much closer.

602
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:28,299
Much, much closer.

603
00:33:30,729 --> 00:33:31,836
Damn you, Kale.

604
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:35,223
Tell him what you saw.

605
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,233
The truth,

606
00:33:38,293 --> 00:33:39,293
Marine.

607
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:44,616
Started with Strauss.

608
00:33:47,007 --> 00:33:48,381
He went to score some coke.

609
00:33:49,885 --> 00:33:52,914
Brewer went with him,
but it was just to stop him.

610
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:57,787
All these guys wanted to do
was deploy to Iraq.

611
00:33:58,468 --> 00:33:59,908
To back up their buddies.

612
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:02,835
They would've been court-martialed
if they were linked to a coke deal.

613
00:34:02,895 --> 00:34:05,586
They lived to be Marines!
You know what that's like!

614
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:08,755
You weren't there.

615
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:10,806
If they said they saw it,
then they saw it.

616
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:13,635
- You lied. You weren't there.
- I was protecting my men!

617
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:14,887
Protecting?!

618
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:16,472
That's some protection, Sergeant!

619
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:20,054
Your men are both dead,
and you just set their killer free!

620
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:35,027
I understand.
Yes, sir.

621
00:34:36,715 --> 00:34:38,909
- Get him back to the safe house.
- Yes, sir.

622
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:41,661
He's promoting me, to head monkey.

623
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:42,721
Kale?

624
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:44,415
Director wants him on ice.

625
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:46,381
Case isn't about him.
It's about Azari.

626
00:34:46,441 --> 00:34:47,698
What case?

627
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:50,017
Are you quitting?

628
00:34:50,077 --> 00:34:52,066
Sometimes it's good to know
when you're beaten.

629
00:34:53,462 --> 00:34:54,969
What do you want me to say, Tobias?

630
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:57,221
You made a mistake.

631
00:34:57,398 --> 00:34:59,599
It's not the first.
It certainly won't be the last.

632
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,642
Forget about it.

633
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:02,903
What's next?

634
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,189
Okay, McGee, what do you see?

635
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:10,067
Crunch Berries cereal.

636
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:11,861
Okay, now what do you see?

637
00:35:14,318 --> 00:35:17,200
French vanilla ice cream
with chocolate sprinkles.

638
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:18,798
Interesting.

639
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:21,711
All right, how about now?

640
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,630
Come on, McGee, say it.

641
00:35:32,003 --> 00:35:33,048
We're grown up.

642
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,383
Sex. Say it.

643
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:37,260
- Sex.
- Mold sex.

644
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:39,095
I mean, it's practically mold porn.

645
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,474
Why are you showing me mold porn?

646
00:35:41,554 --> 00:35:44,766
Because,
this stachybotrys chartarum...

647
00:35:45,157 --> 00:35:46,211
was on...

648
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:47,532
the rope.

649
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:50,858
The same rope that was used to kill
two Marines in the past two days.

650
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:54,153
Particularly when you consider
just how rare this mold is.

651
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:55,911
It's okay, McGee.

652
00:35:56,243 --> 00:35:58,120
It's deadly, but it's sealed.

653
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:00,743
Now, all I have to do is match it.

654
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:16,133
Give the guys a little privacy.

655
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:23,413
Azari has three witnesses
that put him in the park

656
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,560
playing horseshoes
at the time of Strauss' murder.

657
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,114
I got four at a bar playing darts

658
00:36:27,174 --> 00:36:29,145
with Azari at the time
Brewer was ceiling surfing.

659
00:36:29,226 --> 00:36:30,606
Seven witnesses.

660
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,220
All bought and paid for.

661
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:35,111
He doesn't need to buy anybody.
Gets what he wants through intimidation.

662
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:38,613
They found Kale's FBI guard
unconscious in the garage.

663
00:36:38,694 --> 00:36:40,365
His gun and his car are missing.

664
00:36:40,446 --> 00:36:42,519
- You got to be kidding me!
- DiNozzo.

665
00:36:42,738 --> 00:36:45,162
Contacting Base Security.
Putting the yard on full lock down.

666
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:47,330
Ziva.

667
00:36:47,629 --> 00:36:49,165
Security breach at gate six.

668
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,662
FBI car just rammed
through the barrier.

669
00:36:52,165 --> 00:36:54,062
How the hell did
he get off a military base?!

670
00:36:54,122 --> 00:36:55,631
Ask Rivers when he wakes up.

671
00:36:56,656 --> 00:36:58,758
Base Security's designed
to keep people out, not in.

672
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:00,641
You mean like a bathroom window,
DiNozzo?

673
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:02,846
Putting a BOLO out on the car, boss.

674
00:37:02,927 --> 00:37:04,804
- Don't need a BOLO.
- We don't need a BOLO.

675
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:06,517
Get units over to the courthouse.

676
00:37:06,828 --> 00:37:10,242
He has eluded prosecution
from two previous murder cases.

677
00:37:10,302 --> 00:37:12,585
No sign yet of the high-priced
defense team,

678
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:15,614
but we are still awaiting
the arrival of Rick Azari.

679
00:37:15,674 --> 00:37:17,695
There are more whispers of mistrial
from sources...

680
00:37:17,775 --> 00:37:19,111
I don't see Kale.

681
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:22,408
... which could mean,
this is Azari's lucky day.

682
00:37:22,638 --> 00:37:23,658
Or his last.

683
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:25,889
While Azari is actually most known

684
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:28,349
for his alleged participation
in the expanding

685
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:30,270
cocaine trade on the East Coast,

686
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,335
- this trial is about murder.
- Yeah, Gibbs.

687
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,251
Gibbs, you're not gonna believe this.

688
00:37:34,311 --> 00:37:36,809
Azari filed a lawsuit
against the contractor

689
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:38,471
who built his house in Virginia Beach.

690
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:40,254
- Guess why?
- Mold problem.

691
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:42,510
<i>An independent lab
ran tests for the lawsuit.</i>

692
00:37:42,591 --> 00:37:44,852
The rare mold
found in Azari's basement.

693
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:48,224
It matches the moldy
rope used in both murders.

694
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:52,066
This trial for the murder of Randall
Carlson has been pending for weeks.

695
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:54,148
He was a Virginia resident with two...

696
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:55,747
Gibbs, there's Azari.

697
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:58,450
... for the sale and
distribution of narcotics.

698
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,972
He was killed in a late-night...

699
00:38:00,476 --> 00:38:01,536
Go watch it.

700
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,995
Better get out of here by 5:00.
Got reservations at The Palm.

701
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
Azari!

702
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:12,415
You killed my men.

703
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:14,418
He has a gun!

704
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:21,050
Don't bother, Stefano.

705
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,221
If he had the balls to pull
the trigger, I'd already be dead.

706
00:38:25,612 --> 00:38:26,612
No!

707
00:38:27,928 --> 00:38:30,034
- Put your weapon down, Jack.
- Listen to him.

708
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:31,435
Son of a bitch killed my men.

709
00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:33,443
We know that.
We got evidence to prove it.

710
00:38:33,503 --> 00:38:35,041
He'll pay. Not like this.

711
00:38:36,145 --> 00:38:38,484
Come on. Don't get
the kid's hopes up, Toby.

712
00:38:38,802 --> 00:38:40,569
You and I both know
how this is gonna end.

713
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:43,196
He's right.

714
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:45,586
- He's gonna walk.
- Trust us, Sergeant.

715
00:38:45,646 --> 00:38:47,945
Yeah, trust them, Sarge.
They got a great track record.

716
00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:49,848
Yeah, keep talking,
and get yourself killed.

717
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:50,955
By who? Him?

718
00:38:52,657 --> 00:38:54,682
He came here to honor his men, right?

719
00:38:54,742 --> 00:38:56,335
Then have you talk him down.

720
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:02,362
Put your hands behind your back.

721
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:15,231
???

722
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:31,369
I did it for Brewer and Strauss, sir.

723
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:35,814
Yeah, I know why you did it.

724
00:39:38,953 --> 00:39:42,872
<i>It was here in front of the US
District Courthouse that Rick Azari</i>

725
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:46,009
<i>the alleged crime boss,
was shot and killed yesterday.</i>

726
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:49,329
<i>It was just moments before
his murder trial was about to...</i>

727
00:39:54,845 --> 00:39:56,547
Picked a hell of a time to leave.

728
00:39:57,546 --> 00:39:59,296
I will make it up to you.

729
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,540
Hey.
Almost forgot.

730
00:40:02,832 --> 00:40:04,733
It's a long flight to Tel Aviv.

731
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:08,190
If you want, you can borrow this thing.
You know...

732
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,012
Helps you sleep on the plane.

733
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:11,493
I am flying first class.

734
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,644
Never mind.

735
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,512
Nesi'a tova.

736
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,302
See you next week.

737
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Yeah.

738
00:40:45,629 --> 00:40:48,213
<i>Retired Marine Sergeant Jack Kale</i>

739
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,381
<i>shot Mr. Azari in broad daylight
and in front of our cameras.</i>

740
00:40:53,086 --> 00:40:56,105
<i>Azari and his defense team
had just arrived at the courthouse</i>

741
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:58,610
<i>when Kale approached, gun in hand.</i>

742
00:40:58,762 --> 00:41:01,126
<i>- A gun we understand...</i>
- You didn't take the shot.

743
00:41:02,286 --> 00:41:03,673
Was too quick for me.

744
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:05,892
<i>Rivers had been entrusted
with the protection of Kale.</i>

745
00:41:05,952 --> 00:41:07,729
Director want to see you, too?

746
00:41:08,463 --> 00:41:09,928
I invited myself.

747
00:41:11,996 --> 00:41:13,244
You'd do the same.

748
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:18,434
She said you'd be here.

749
00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:20,371
Who?

750
00:41:21,203 --> 00:41:22,490
Our ex-wife.

751
00:41:25,491 --> 00:41:28,764
- What are you going to tell him?
- Whatever he needs to hear.

752
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:31,529
Agent Fornell,
the director will see you now.

753
00:41:31,816 --> 00:41:32,747
Thanks.

754
00:41:41,189 --> 00:41:42,694
I should have seen it.

755
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:44,841
Kale.

756
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,885
Too much detail
about the wrong things.

757
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,141
Too much left out
about the right things.

758
00:41:52,752 --> 00:41:54,573
Maybe I just didn't want to know.

759
00:41:55,018 --> 00:41:58,503
- You gonna tell your boss that?
- I got a kid looking at life sentence.

760
00:41:59,488 --> 00:42:01,557
The director's gonna want to know why.

761
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:04,555
Yeah, Kale made his decision, Tobias.

762
00:42:04,634 --> 00:42:06,399
Now he's got to live with it.

763
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:07,834
We all will.

764
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:10,449
<i>A power struggle is already underway</i>

765
00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:12,944
<i>among those eager
to fill Azari's shoes.</i>

766
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:15,249
<i>Two of Azari's lieutenants were gunned</i>

767
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:17,497
<i>down in Southeast DC late last night.</i>

768
00:42:17,654 --> 00:42:21,159
<i>Underworld sources believe
that Azari's former bodyguard,</i>

769
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:24,301
<i>28-year-old Stefano DelMar,
has already emerged</i>

770
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:25,984
<i>as Azari's heir apparent.</i>
