00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,845
- My corps.
- My corps.

3
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:19,375
- Your corps.
- Your corps.

4
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:20,937
- Our corps.
- Our corps.

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,563
- Marine Corps.
- Marine Corps.

6
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:29,185
Four miles to go, Marines.

7
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:32,699
Back in formation, Fricker.

8
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:34,504
Platoon, halt.

9
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:35,795
At ease.

10
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:37,434
Marine,

11
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:39,743
what part of "fall in"
don't you understand?

12
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:42,531
- Sergeant, we got a problem.
- Shut yourself, Fricker.

13
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,365
Don't answer me.
Don't even look at me.

14
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:46,963
What do you think you're doing?

15
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:49,549
Over there, Sergeant.

16
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:21,080
NCIS Season 7 Episode 18
Jurisdiction 1.0 LOL

17
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,125
Synchro: Gaillots.

00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,086
Rereading: Bruno & Magic Turtle.

00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,618
www.Team-NCIS.com

20
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:50,193
Come on.

21
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:51,796
Come on.

22
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:53,731
I got gum.
I got...

23
00:01:56,265 --> 00:01:57,754
spare change,

24
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,110
old lip balm.

25
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:01,036
They're not in here.

26
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,456
Found candy left over
from Valentine's Day.

27
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,228
- Candy from who?
- Why does it matter?

28
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:07,099
It matters
because you didn't eat it.

29
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:10,124
And so that person must not mean
very much to you.

30
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:12,613
- It means something.
- It means nothing.

31
00:02:15,298 --> 00:02:16,761
I'm glad I wasn't your Valentine.

32
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:17,812
So am I.

33
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:23,091
Here you go, McGee.
I found this.

34
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:25,632
One of my motivational CDs.
I've been looking for this.

35
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:27,318
Yeah, you should've looked harder.

36
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:29,629
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't think
to look in your desk.

37
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:30,936
You know what?

38
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,611
Whoever drove the van last
probably has the keys.

39
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:35,035
Yeah!

40
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:41,043
I went and got pizza yesterday
'cause I was hungry.

41
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,703
Then what did you do with the keys?

42
00:02:43,092 --> 00:02:45,412
Well, I drove back.
I ate the pizza.

43
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:47,084
I threw out the box, and...

44
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:50,967
You know what?
Today is garbage day.

45
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:53,673
- You'd better... you'd better hurry.
- Where is the dumpster?

46
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,116
- In the basement.
- Did you lose something, David?

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,593
Not I.
Tony did.

48
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:00,888
What'd you lose? Your watch?

49
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,206
Driver's license?

50
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:04,757
- Neither.
- Got a dead body.

51
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:05,935
Navy diver.

52
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:07,252
Who's driving?

53
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:09,747
There's a little problem.

54
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,495
No, the problem

55
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:13,931
is that I found these
on the elevator floor.

56
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,452
That's my bad.

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,822
Won't happen.

58
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:20,575
I doubt that.
Meet you all downstairs.

59
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,281
"I do like to be beside the seaside"

60
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:29,339
"I do like to be beside the sea..."

61
00:03:29,423 --> 00:03:32,398
You know, strolling on a beach
like this at this time of year

62
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,928
reminds me of weekends
we used to spend with Mother

63
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:38,307
and some friends in Brighton.

64
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:41,095
They made us eat winkles.

65
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,407
To this day,

66
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:45,608
I shudder at the thought
of eating any kind of snail.

67
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:47,518
I've always preferred
oysters myself.

68
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:50,396
Of course you do, Jimbo.

69
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,228
Oysters, nature's aphrodisiac.

70
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:57,185
Surprised Blondie doesn't have you
shucking night and day.

71
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,743
That's pretty cute.

72
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:00,573
Shucks.

73
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,492
- So how is Bryn anyway?
- Excellent.

74
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:06,659
She just became a union rep
for her embalmer's local.

75
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:10,142
- She must have quite a pair of hands.
- Her talents never cease to amaze me.

76
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:17,757
Navy diver.

77
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,257
What are you thinking?

78
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:21,385
Well, he didn't run out of air.

79
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:24,744
However,
I can't rule out nitrox poisoning.

80
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,755
The fishes sure did a number on him.

81
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,200
As did a propeller. See?

82
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:31,523
The blade sliced through and

83
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:36,067
removed his entire left forearm, but

84
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,859
almost certainly after he was dead.

85
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:40,947
"This was no boating accident!"

86
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:47,248
Richard Dreyfuss in <i>Jaws</i>,
you know, when he finds the arm?

87
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:49,163
- The medical ex...
- I love that part.

88
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:50,647
<i>Jaws</i> is classic.

89
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:54,032
I estimate the time of death
to be between three and five days ago,

90
00:04:54,116 --> 00:04:56,033
based on the degree
of decomposition.

91
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:59,674
A Navy diver doesn't go out alone.
A long time not to be reported missing.

92
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:01,758
Unless he wasn't supposed
to be found.

93
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:02,819
McGee, details.

94
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,502
Lieutenant Michael Jensen, age 36.

95
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,688
Prior enlisted.

96
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:09,853
U.S. Navy master diver
based out of the...

97
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:13,582
Experimental Diving Unit in Panama City,
then detailed to Little Creek.

98
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:15,655
Also says here he was on leave.

99
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,487
C.O. wouldn't have reported him U.A.

100
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,229
Diving on his day off.

101
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:20,640
Yeah, or moonlighting.

102
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:22,868
Hello, hello.
What have we here?

103
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:25,866
There's a puncture wound
through his wet suit.

104
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:27,994
Swordfish?

105
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:29,375
Doubtful.

106
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:30,813
Speargun?

107
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:33,208
It's difficult to tell
till I get him back.

108
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,466
Blood loss from this would
accelerate the feeding frenzy.

109
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,796
You were right, Jethro.
Lieutenant Jensen was not diving alone.

110
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,765
Whoever was with him stabbed him

111
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,842
and then left him
in the water to die.

112
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,559
- Any family?
- Owned a home in Portsmith.

113
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:48,889
No wife, no kids.

114
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:50,484
No accident.

115
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,484
Could have sent McGee.

116
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:01,695
Yeah, could have.

117
00:06:02,715 --> 00:06:04,530
I wanted to see how Jensen lived.

118
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:07,205
It says a lot about a man.

119
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,464
Take your house, for instance.

120
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:11,704
Clean, no nonsense, stoic.

121
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:12,762
Stoic?

122
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:15,000
My house is stoic?

123
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:17,293
Understated, then?

124
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:19,804
I planted some roses last weekend.

125
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:20,979
Red ones.

126
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:22,452
Red roses are stoic?

127
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:24,977
- Yeah, prickly and thorny like...
- Door.

128
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,244
Clear, boss.

129
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:03,876
Maybe not totally clear.

130
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,811
Toss the gun.
Do it now.

131
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:08,552
Take it easy, sweetheart.
Who are you?

132
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:10,492
I'm not the one
breaking and entering.

133
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:11,807
No, the door was open.

134
00:07:12,421 --> 00:07:13,553
Ladies first.

135
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:15,782
It's turning into a party
around here.

136
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:19,849
Looks a little like <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>.

137
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:21,578
Except you're cuter
than Harvey Keitel.

138
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:22,853
We're federal agents.

139
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:24,790
Get his I.D.

140
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:26,725
Look. Don't touch.

141
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:32,121
Come on, really?

142
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:36,080
Who are you guys?
DEA? FBI?

143
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,437
CGIS.

144
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,269
Coast Guard, Boss.

145
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:42,670
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

146
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:46,215
Put the weapon away, Kyle.

147
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,166
Yes, ma'am.

148
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:48,801
That's a nice head slap.

149
00:07:57,702 --> 00:07:59,128
What is CGIS?

150
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:01,099
Coast Guard Investigative Service.

151
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:03,771
The Coast Guard has
an investigative branch?

152
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:07,608
Well, they're smaller than us,
but with a wider law enforcement reach.

153
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:09,493
But it is the Coast Guard.

154
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:11,782
No need to get all uppity.

155
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,742
Yes, Virginia, there is a CGIS.

156
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,537
They may not have our track record,

157
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,997
or our <i>je ne sais quoi</i>,

158
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:20,583
but they are a legitimate sibling.

159
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:22,366
Like Corky in <i>Life Goes On</i>.

160
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:23,460
Who?

161
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,089
We ran into Borin
and her probie at Jensen's house.

162
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,592
She remind you of anyone?

163
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,030
Like who, exactly?

164
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:34,610
Come on in.
Get you a cup of coffee?

165
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,773
That'd be fine, Agent Gibbs.

166
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,500
So this is NCIS.

167
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:44,701
Sorry to disappoint you.

168
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:51,238
Of course, I'm going to need
to talk to your director right away.

169
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:54,950
Well, my case, my questions.

170
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:56,869
Jensen's Navy.

171
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,997
- The case belongs to NCIS.
- That depends on his involvement.

172
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:02,081
How's him being dead?

173
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,670
He still could be my killer.

174
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:15,095
Whose murder are you investigating?

175
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,380
About a week ago,
one of our recon flights

176
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:26,065
spotted a salvage boat adrift
about 8 miles off the coast of Virginia.

177
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,019
Only one on board was the Captain...

178
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,442
a guy named Martin Lime.

179
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,154
Found him bludgeoned to death.
Case fell in my lap.

180
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,347
How's Jensen fit?

181
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:35,366
I found some security video
of Jensen

182
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,442
and Captain Lime talking
at the marina.

183
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:39,440
My gut said
he might be worth questioning.

184
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:40,412
Your gut?

185
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:43,832
I like to conduct
my own investigation.

186
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:45,744
Right there with you.

187
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:49,338
Any death on a U.S. registered
vessel is FBI or

188
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,736
- Coast Guard jurisdiction.
- So where's the FBI?

189
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:55,427
They told us to call
if we get close on anything.

190
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,369
I got your number.

191
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,016
No, you don't.

192
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:04,008
So, what's your beef, Gibbs?

193
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:06,917
That I'm Coast Guard?
That I'm a woman?

194
00:10:07,603 --> 00:10:10,234
Or that I managed to get
the drop on you in that house?

195
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:15,050
I don't know you.

196
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:18,826
That's it?

197
00:10:21,394 --> 00:10:24,563
It was a maxim of Captain Swosser...

198
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:27,501
speaking
in his naval figurative manner,

199
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:30,313
that "If you only have
a plank to swab,

200
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:34,008
"you should swab it
as if Davy Jones were after you."

201
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:36,851
He was certainly
after this poor fellow.

202
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:38,590
You quoting Jack Sparrow?

203
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,597
No, no, no, Mr. Palmer.

204
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:43,224
Charles Dickens...

205
00:10:43,798 --> 00:10:45,223
<i>Bleak House</i>.

206
00:10:46,158 --> 00:10:47,479
I prefer <i>Treasure Island</i>.

207
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,203
Robert Louis Stevenson.

208
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,130
One of my favorites, too.

209
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:54,850
I used to jump up on my bed,
pretend I was Jim Hawkins

210
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,628
- sailing with Long John Silver.
- Magnificent.

211
00:10:57,712 --> 00:10:59,575
How old were you, ten, nine?

212
00:11:00,228 --> 00:11:00,937
23.

213
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,924
"For the boy's story is the best
that is ever told."

214
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:07,312
Dickens.

215
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,126
And what's his story, Duck?

216
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,113
But, unfortunately,
much of this poor lad's demise...

217
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:14,923
It must remain a mystery.

218
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:17,634
Dead men do tell tales,
and some better than others.

219
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,077
I mean, he's the same height
and build as Lieutenant Jensen,

220
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:24,808
but the only way
to confirm his identity is by DNA

221
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,780
- and dental records.
- Cause of death?

222
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,923
Being shanked
by a screwdriver didn't help.

223
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:32,024
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:34,902
Sea lice in his esophagus,

225
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,661
the cyanosis and nasal hemorrhage,

226
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:39,448
all point to death by drowning.

227
00:11:40,642 --> 00:11:43,556
Master diver drowns
swimming to shore?

228
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:45,114
May I remind you, uh...

229
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,851
an injured diver.

230
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:49,295
Even the best of us meet our match.

231
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:53,430
Abby is processing
his diving equipment.

232
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:54,848
Thank you.

233
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:56,423
Tread softly, Jethro.

234
00:11:56,806 --> 00:11:59,968
Ms. Sciuto, for some unexplained reason,
is not herself today.

235
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,330
I was just cleaning Jensen's laptop.

236
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:31,834
- Everything all right?
- No, it's not. What are you doing here?

237
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:33,049
I work here.

238
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,778
I know what you're doing "here",

239
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:37,048
but I always know
when you're coming here, and I didn't.

240
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:39,479
- You don't have anything?
- I've got nothing.

241
00:12:39,563 --> 00:12:40,799
Okay, Jensen drowned,

242
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:43,272
but he still had plenty
of nitrox in his tanks.

243
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:45,956
I'm still processing
these little rubber things in his teeth.

244
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,542
I think they're from the regulator.

245
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:50,582
And I have no idea
how to get into Jensen's laptop.

246
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,859
He's got a code built in here
that would make the NSA proud.

247
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:56,673
I'm just... I'm off my game.

248
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,445
- Maybe this will help.
- You think I didn't try this already?

249
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,904
I had 2 this morning.

250
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,867
That's kind of
when things started going south.

251
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:05,173
I just... I don't know what's wrong.

252
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:07,643
- Abs, I need what's in that laptop.
- I know you do.

253
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:09,482
Maybe a hug would help.

254
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:16,670
Didn't help.

255
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,273
I guess I'm just going
to keep banging my head.

256
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:22,342
Don't do that.

257
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:24,887
I need what's in that head.

258
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,148
Special Agent Abigail Borin.

259
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,408
She's 34.

260
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:40,807
Served a tour of duty
in Iraq as a sergeant.

261
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:43,784
No spouse. No little Borins.

262
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:46,074
It's uncanny, isn't it?

263
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:47,795
What?

264
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:51,149
A former Marine turned
surly investigative agent who...

265
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:55,000
- flies by the seat of her gut.
- How do you know that?

266
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,713
He was eavesdropping
outside the conference room.

267
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,296
It's called research, McTattle.

268
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:02,772
Anyway, I think
a law of nature's being violated here.

269
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,664
Like matter and antimatter
colliding or something.

270
00:14:05,748 --> 00:14:07,429
That would be bad.
You read comic books.

271
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:11,476
Are you obsessed with this woman
because she reminds you of Gibbs

272
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,519
or because she is quite attractive?

273
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:18,538
- Gosh, I hadn't even noticed.
- Noticed what?

274
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,779
We're just talking
about the case, and

275
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:27,407
the complexities
and the deeply layered... Where's Gibbs?

276
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,742
He's avoiding me,

277
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,969
but I am not going anywhere.

278
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:32,871
So, what do you got?

279
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:36,959
"What do you got?" She says.

280
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,090
What we have is
Lieutenant Michael Jensen.

281
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:48,053
He was in the service 12 years,
last eight as a master diver.

282
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,888
His record was spotless:

283
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,690
several commendations,
two Purple Hearts.

284
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:55,124
Video shows him
at the marina with Lime.

285
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,678
So any other connections?

286
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,269
Nothing in Jensen's finances.

287
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:01,501
There was an odd charge, though.

288
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:05,170
Payment to a storage facility
in Alexandria...

289
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:07,364
three years, paid in full.

290
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,950
That's a long time to keep
something in a locker, huh?

291
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:12,202
Unless you want people
to forget about it.

292
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,703
So when can we have access?

293
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:16,400
We?

294
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:20,423
Well, first thing tomorrow morning.

295
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,004
Great.

296
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:28,834
Is there a problem?

297
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:30,846
No, it's just...

298
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:35,248
Do you have any siblings?

299
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:36,630
None. Only child.

300
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:38,186
Small town in Ohio.

301
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,295
Tell Gibbs I'll wait for him
outside MTAC.

302
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:50,866
Nice comm.

303
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:52,743
Must have set
the Navy back a few bucks.

304
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,738
The Coast Guard does not have
capabilities like this?

305
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,205
We're still capable of plenty.

306
00:15:57,421 --> 00:16:00,780
Just because CGIS is small,
it doesn't mean we're impotent.

307
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:03,786
- Jensen and the boat connected?
- Quantico, please.

308
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:04,921
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:08,634
- <i>Hi.</i>
- That one of yours?

310
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:10,389
Outsourced.

311
00:16:10,773 --> 00:16:12,040
Down sizing's rough.

312
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,097
We make it work.
Ms. Choi,

313
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,405
could you tell Special Agent Gibbs
your findings, please?

314
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:20,051
<i>We dusted Martin Lime's boat,</i>

315
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:22,522
<i>and Lieutenant Jensen's prints
were all over it.</i>

316
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:23,940
- Blood?
- <i>Some.</i>

317
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,942
<i>The type matched
the Lieutenant as well.</i>

318
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:27,878
<i>Still waiting for DNA.</i>

319
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,125
<i>We think you have
a double homicide on your hands:</i>

320
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,596
<i>Captain Lime and Lieutenant Jensen.</i>

321
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:34,951
<i>One civilian,</i>

322
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:36,578
<i>- one Navy.</i>
- Thank you.

323
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:37,796
<i>Thank you.</i>

324
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,073
Do we keep chasing
each other in circles,

325
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:43,043
or do we work together
to find a killer?

326
00:16:43,246 --> 00:16:46,170
- We have everything we need right here.
- I'm willing to try.

327
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:50,650
Welcome aboard.

328
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:02,223
Our recon flight spotted
Captain Lime's vessel the Delilah here.

329
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:03,989
Did the boat have a GPS on it?

330
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,108
Yeah, which indicated
it'd been trolling back and

331
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,010
- forth in a grid pattern for a week.
- He was looking for something.

332
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,993
It stopped in this location, and
presumably the murders took place there.

333
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,325
So once the killer found
what he was looking for,

334
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,250
he kills Captain Lime,

335
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,955
tosses Lieutenant Jensen overboard
and abandons ship.

336
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,998
It's miles to shore.
No way he could swim it.

337
00:17:22,227 --> 00:17:22,992
Maybe.

338
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,335
You have satellite photos
of other ships in the area?

339
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,146
- My people are already working on it.
- What about my people?

340
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:31,884
Yes, we...

341
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:35,868
tracked several large deposits recently
made to the Captain's bank account.

342
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:38,570
And we've got a recurring phone number
on Jensen's cell

343
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:40,429
to a Missy Dawkins out of Reston.

344
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:41,977
She's coming in.
I'll take it.

345
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:42,941
And?

346
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:44,839
And I have...

347
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:49,901
the warrant for the storage unit
Jensen rented.

348
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,565
- Get Ziva to check out the storage...
- Gibbs and I take....

349
00:17:53,383 --> 00:17:54,780
Sorry. It's your house.

350
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:01,621
Get Ziva, check out the storage unit.
On it, Boss.

351
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:04,508
Agent Borin, you want to walk me
through your evidence log?

352
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:06,986
Yeah, no problem.
You can call me Abby.

353
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:09,882
No, no, that's not going to happen.

354
00:18:10,897 --> 00:18:11,749
Oh, my God.

355
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,550
I can't believe he's dead.

356
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,179
What was your relationship
with the deceased?

357
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,890
You mean he's deceased, too?

358
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:25,744
How did you know Lieutenant Jensen?

359
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,112
We dated on and off
for the last six months.

360
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:31,887
He was a fun guy.

361
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:35,697
He just didn't have much...

362
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:37,741
Money.

363
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:42,215
I was runner-up Miss Biloxi.

364
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:45,123
I'm accustomed
to a certain lifestyle.

365
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:47,083
I bet you are.

366
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,878
When was the last time you saw him?

367
00:18:50,706 --> 00:18:52,283
About two weeks ago.

368
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:55,465
Michael said he was going off
on some hush-hush Navy thing.

369
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,291
Told me when he came back,
he'd have a lot of money to burn.

370
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,055
Did he say exactly how much?

371
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:03,021
Enough to make
all my dreams come true.

372
00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:09,486
According to the log, the last time
Jensen accessed his unit was

373
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:11,216
two weeks ago.
Was he alone?

374
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,640
I couldn't say.

375
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:14,335
What do the cameras say?

376
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:16,620
Not much.
They haven't worked for years.

377
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:18,573
Security's pretty tight
around here, huh?

378
00:19:18,943 --> 00:19:20,824
Do I tell you how to do your job?

379
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,578
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Act like a jerk?

380
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,415
I can walk, you know,
and kick your Navy ass.

381
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,387
All right,

382
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,795
this is Jensen's unit.

383
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,799
I have a bigger unit
if you'd prefer to see that.

384
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:38,547
Keys.

385
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:42,210
I'll be in my office if you need me.

386
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:53,440
Smells musty.

387
00:19:56,744 --> 00:19:58,132
What do we have here?

388
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,897
Look at all this stuff.

389
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:06,037
These are ocean charts.

390
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,541
This is
where the Delilah was abandoned.

391
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:11,710
Calafuego.

392
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,575
Treasure hunters.

393
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:16,236
Is that what this is all about,

394
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,215
treasure?

395
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:19,179
Pirate treasure.

396
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,769
This looks like David Jones' locker.

397
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,148
Davy Jones.

398
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:26,485
He used to sing with The Monkees.

399
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,232
Real monkeys?

400
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,757
I envy your brain sometimes.

401
00:20:40,477 --> 00:20:42,319
Gold <i>reales</i>
and a sunken treasure, Gibbs.

402
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:44,566
All taken
from Jensen's storage locker.

403
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,088
Pretty cool.
Almost makes up for the way I feel.

404
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:49,681
Although I hear you're having
your own personal problems...

405
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,910
Special Agent Abigail Borin.

406
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:01,068
So, Abby, what do you got?

407
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,909
What do you got, Abs?

408
00:21:04,993 --> 00:21:07,460
Other than
like a five-alarm migraine...

409
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:10,212
I was finally able
to decrypt Jensen's laptop.

410
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:11,999
The most interesting thing on here

411
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,940
is a nested folder containing e-mails
between Jensen

412
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,870
and a Dr. Joseph Mavrey.

413
00:21:16,954 --> 00:21:18,442
He's a big surgeon in DC.

414
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:19,636
What were they about?

415
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,027
It seems
like they're talking about sports,

416
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:24,812
'cause they keep using
the term "a cage foul".

417
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:27,210
But that is an anagram for...

418
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:31,585
- Calafuego.
- It's the ship Jensen was researching.

419
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:34,668
- Maybe it's a coincidence.
- Don't believe in them.

420
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,368
Of course not.
Okay, so according to the history books,

421
00:21:37,452 --> 00:21:40,674
the Calafuego went down off the East
Coast. Maybe Jensen was looking for it.

422
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,093
- Or found it.
- Maybe he had a partner.

423
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:45,760
It costs a lot to recover a ship.

424
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:47,617
They'd have to be rich.

425
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:48,736
Very.

426
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:50,227
Thanks, Abs.

427
00:21:56,454 --> 00:21:58,479
Are you sure
I can't get you anything?

428
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,073
Yeah, I'm sure.

429
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:03,418
Mrs. Mavrey, we actually need
to speak with your husband.

430
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:06,120
I'm afraid that's impossible.
He's out of the country.

431
00:22:06,432 --> 00:22:09,054
Another International Doctor's Group
crisis in South America.

432
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:10,413
He won't be back for weeks.

433
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,163
Is there any way to reach him?

434
00:22:12,718 --> 00:22:15,588
No. Joe turns everything off
when he travels.

435
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:17,835
He says it distracts him
from the work.

436
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:20,422
Does the name
Michael Jensen ring a bell?

437
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:22,450
Is he a patient of my husband's?

438
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,705
He's a Navy diver.

439
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:27,591
He's dead.

440
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:30,533
I'm so sorry.

441
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,932
Apparently, you husband,
Dr. Mavrey, contacted him

442
00:22:34,328 --> 00:22:35,804
multiple times.

443
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,998
Look, because
of the success of Joe's work,

444
00:22:39,082 --> 00:22:40,670
he is constantly meeting new people.

445
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,730
There's no way I could possibly keep
track of them all.

446
00:22:44,013 --> 00:22:45,913
When he checks in,
I'll be happy to mention it.

447
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,783
- But then it might be too late.
- When you do hear from him,

448
00:22:50,298 --> 00:22:51,828
if you could let us know,

449
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,612
- we'd appreciate it.
- I will, absolutely.

450
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,515
- She's covering for her husband.
- Maybe.

451
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,512
We should bring her in
for questioning.

452
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:04,197
- Push her harder.
- Based on what?

453
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:06,299
Based on... my gut.

454
00:23:06,537 --> 00:23:08,636
Right, right, yeah,
I've heard that before.

455
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,489
We're just supposed
to sit around and wait?

456
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:11,598
Yeah, for now.

457
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:13,120
Is that the Navy way?

458
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:15,445
It's the smart way.

459
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:18,521
SECNAV has pull
with the Attorney General.

460
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:20,234
Doctors' charity...

461
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,067
A.G.'s on the board.

462
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:23,377
So we'll get him.

463
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,736
I know that.

464
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,275
Look at all
of these swashbuckling movies.

465
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:31,915
And Errol Flynn.

466
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:34,913
<i>Captain Blood</i>!

467
00:23:36,105 --> 00:23:37,622
And Douglas Fairbanks.

468
00:23:39,189 --> 00:23:40,293
<i>The Black Pirate</i>.

469
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,316
Imagine Gibbs as a pirate?

470
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:44,703
A little eye patch and the peg leg?

471
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,192
A parrot on his shoulder?

472
00:23:46,276 --> 00:23:48,426
We're not talking about pirate movies.
Look at this.

473
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:50,641
Mel Fisher found the Atochain 1985.

474
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:53,162
Made almost 450 million bucks.

475
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:56,485
The Real Calafuego went down
in 1647 loaded

476
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,353
with gifts
for the Spanish government.

477
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,440
If this really turns out
to be the Calafuego,

478
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:02,649
no telling how much money's
at stake here.

479
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,991
- Give me a ballpark, McGee.
- $250 million easy, Boss.

480
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:08,238
Jensen must have isolated
the wreck site

481
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,886
and went looking for a backer
to fund the recovery mission.

482
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,785
- Why Mavrey?
- He was more than just a good surgeon.

483
00:24:14,006 --> 00:24:15,458
He had 16 patents pending.

484
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,632
So he could afford
to play treasure hunter.

485
00:24:17,938 --> 00:24:21,289
So Mavrey killed him
to avoid splitting the loot.

486
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,473
It's very
<i>Treasure of the Sierra Madre</i>.

487
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:26,069
So Mavrey doesn't need the money,
though.

488
00:24:26,462 --> 00:24:27,697
No, actually he does.

489
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,562
Apparently,
one of the stents is flawed.

490
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:32,726
Thousands of lawsuits
flying around now,

491
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,265
so he needs as many high-priced
lawyers as he can afford.

492
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:39,894
Just got a call from
the Attorney General's office.

493
00:24:40,317 --> 00:24:42,575
Mavrey's doctor group
never left the country.

494
00:24:42,811 --> 00:24:44,086
He's been here all along.

495
00:24:44,621 --> 00:24:46,651
- BOLO, McGee. Find him.
- Already on it.

496
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:51,244
Okay, Dr. Mavrey just logged in
to his own Web site

497
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:52,821
to perform a bypass surgery.

498
00:24:53,387 --> 00:24:56,619
Look, you can watch it live
if you click here and pay $19.99.

499
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,496
- Where is he?
- His own facility...

500
00:24:58,601 --> 00:24:59,664
Northwest D.C.

501
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,000
That's 1200 Meadowlark Ave, Boss.

502
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,689
Click there.
Click it.

503
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,693
Hell of a place to hide.

504
00:25:05,777 --> 00:25:07,762
His own clinic...
not real bright.

505
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:10,433
Dr. Mavrey...
where is he?

506
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:12,485
I'm sorry.
I'm not at liberty to say.

507
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,490
- Dr. Mavrey's gone.
- He just signed in online surgery.

508
00:25:15,574 --> 00:25:17,776
- We need to see him, federal agents.
- He isn't here.

509
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,418
He hasn't been for days.

510
00:25:19,502 --> 00:25:21,019
They're getting ready for surgery.

511
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,385
You can't go in there.

512
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,181
Dr. Mavrey, we need to talk.

513
00:25:28,455 --> 00:25:29,485
What is this?

514
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:30,528
Who are you?

515
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,629
Victor Kalsa.
I'm Dr. Mavrey's associate.

516
00:25:32,713 --> 00:25:34,449
I fill in for him
when he isn't available.

517
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,079
We start a surgery here.

518
00:25:36,163 --> 00:25:37,701
I know that.
Where's Mavrey?

519
00:25:37,785 --> 00:25:40,538
Well, to be honest, we haven't heard
from him in over a week.

520
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,467
This is what I'm talking about.
It's like one down...

521
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:57,180
- Was he there?
- No,

522
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,231
not exactly.

523
00:25:58,315 --> 00:26:01,651
Dr. Mavrey has his partners do
his online surgeries for him.

524
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:05,146
Well, a flag just went up on one
of Mavrey's credit cards here.

525
00:26:05,555 --> 00:26:08,839
Hired a private jet earlier today
to fly him to the Mariana Islands.

526
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,777
- The Marianas?
- Where is that exactly?

527
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:13,070
Guam. U.S. Commonwealth.

528
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,957
Now it's my turn.
Muggy.

529
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:16,366
Talk to me, Boss.

530
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,191
If this plane hasn't landed yet,

531
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:20,535
why don't we have
a Coast Guard aircraft intercept it

532
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,997
and suggest to his pilots
they may be abetting a fugitive.

533
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:24,983
On it.

534
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:27,560
Nice. You can do that?

535
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:29,291
Just scratching the surface.

536
00:26:30,452 --> 00:26:32,249
- Yeah. Gibbs.
<i>- Can I see you?</i>

537
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:34,408
Yeah, Duck, on my way.

538
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,472
You're alone.

539
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:41,225
Who were you expecting?

540
00:26:41,428 --> 00:26:42,665
Her, of course.

541
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:46,710
The whole building is talking
about your Coast Guard friend.

542
00:26:47,548 --> 00:26:50,398
I'm feeling particularly alone
and depressed tonight.

543
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:54,440
First, Mother moves into the next world,
and then last night...

544
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,509
You broke up with Sophie?

545
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:58,034
You noticed.

546
00:26:59,468 --> 00:27:02,345
She was so anxious
to change yours truly.

547
00:27:02,776 --> 00:27:05,311
I was beginning
to question my own identity.

548
00:27:05,395 --> 00:27:07,584
Yeah, I know
how protective you are of that.

549
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:09,415
She also

550
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:12,255
put some of Mother's silver
in the dishwasher.

551
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:14,592
Really?

552
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:22,682
Did you call me down here
to tell me something?

553
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:29,524
Jensen's medical records
are on the way over.

554
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:32,047
But in preparing this mold,

555
00:27:32,557 --> 00:27:34,455
I made an interesting discovery.

556
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:36,982
Well, the guy had an overbite.

557
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:39,851
Yes, but he also has several

558
00:27:40,654 --> 00:27:43,438
sub-fractures on three incisors.

559
00:27:43,522 --> 00:27:45,125
Broken teeth from struggling?

560
00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:46,558
No, I don't think so.

561
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:50,497
I think they were self-inflicted
from some kind of seizure.

562
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:52,062
I mean, take a look.

563
00:27:54,193 --> 00:27:55,902
The jaw was clamped.

564
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:57,592
So tightly shut

565
00:27:58,005 --> 00:27:59,638
that he quite literally

566
00:27:59,722 --> 00:28:01,804
detached the masseter muscle

567
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:03,453
from the mandible bone.

568
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,653
Bit right through the mouthpiece.

569
00:28:05,737 --> 00:28:08,843
Which explains the pieces of rubber
we found in his mouth.

570
00:28:09,294 --> 00:28:11,854
I mean, in a dazed panic
and unable to breathe,

571
00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:13,954
he rips off his mask and drowns.

572
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:16,946
Duck, why would a guy who's been diving
his whole life react like that?

573
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,674
I also...

574
00:28:19,835 --> 00:28:22,266
found a history of hemochromatosis:

575
00:28:22,738 --> 00:28:24,747
in his case, congenital.

576
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:27,955
It's a retention of iron,
to be precise.

577
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:32,476
I believe that this condition
would have precluded diver training,

578
00:28:33,684 --> 00:28:36,016
unless, of course,
someone expunged his records.

579
00:28:37,438 --> 00:28:39,967
Unbelievable. How they think
they can get away with this.

580
00:28:40,181 --> 00:28:41,248
Who's they?

581
00:28:41,617 --> 00:28:43,882
They, you know, the ubiquitous them.

582
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:46,036
You found something
in Jensen's blood?

583
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:49,198
No.
That's not Jensen's blood.

584
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:51,997
That's the spectrographic
analysis of Caf-POW.

585
00:28:52,162 --> 00:28:55,024
Or so they'd like you to think.
They changed the formula, Gibbs.

586
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,693
And not to improve the flavor,
but to save money.

587
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,904
I mean,
no wonder I've been a total freak.

588
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,759
This is like New Coke
all over again.

589
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:04,356
I'm going to start a letter-writing
campaign. You help me?

590
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,785
You've got nothing on Jensen?

591
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:09,372
Actually, when Ducky said
that Jensen had a seizure...

592
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:13,955
I reran his blood and I found exactly
what I found before, which was nothing.

593
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:17,584
Jensen was using nitrox because
on deep dives, it's beneficial.

594
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:20,923
But he was headed into shallow water,
so why didn't he adjust?

595
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:22,659
A master diver would know that.

596
00:29:22,743 --> 00:29:25,096
That's why I think
there's something rotten in Denmark.

597
00:29:26,776 --> 00:29:28,285
Hang on a sec, Gibbs.

598
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:30,641
I might have something
sooner than later.

599
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,172
Fishermen just found
a punctured Zodiac

600
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:36,858
floating not too far
from where Jensen's body washed up.

601
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,693
- It's how they got back.
- Had to be.

602
00:29:38,969 --> 00:29:39,967
And get this:

603
00:29:40,184 --> 00:29:42,789
the Coast Guard
intercepted Mavrey's plane.

604
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,251
He wasn't on it.

605
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:46,868
Pilots were paid cash to fly
an empty plane to the Marianas.

606
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:48,954
- Empty?
- No, decoy.

607
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,184
We're being played.
Where's DiNozzo?

608
00:29:51,268 --> 00:29:53,176
We need to bring in
that doctor's wife.

609
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:01,343
Nice pad.

610
00:30:01,743 --> 00:30:03,873
Early American colossal.

611
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,384
Hello.

612
00:30:06,735 --> 00:30:08,429
You must be Agent DiNozzo.

613
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:10,269
Mrs. Mavrey?

614
00:30:10,695 --> 00:30:11,715
Impressive.

615
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:15,092
I got your message.

616
00:30:15,284 --> 00:30:17,448
What's this about Joe
chartering a plane?

617
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:18,691
I don't understand.

618
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:22,003
Yeah, one-way.

619
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:24,099
Usually not a good indication.

620
00:30:24,332 --> 00:30:26,518
- We have a few questions.
- Of course.

621
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:27,791
So do I.

622
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:29,994
We need your help in finding him.

623
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,706
If I knew anything,
I would tell you.

624
00:30:34,817 --> 00:30:37,793
Please,
I will help you in any way I can.

625
00:30:41,961 --> 00:30:43,257
That's not good.

626
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:46,664
Doc's having
some legal trouble, huh?

627
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:52,299
We've had a rough time lately.

628
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:54,742
Joe's been upset,

629
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:56,365
distracted.

630
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:59,584
But I never expected him to...

631
00:30:59,668 --> 00:31:00,733
If you lie to us,

632
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,170
- you're aiding a fugitive.
- I keep telling you,

633
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:06,531
I don't know where he is.

634
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:10,535
Look,

635
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:12,951
I got this e-mail over a week ago.

636
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:16,082
Joe said that he was leaving
the country...

637
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:17,898
for work,

638
00:31:18,247 --> 00:31:20,872
and that the lawsuits would be dealt
with when he got back,

639
00:31:22,468 --> 00:31:24,233
that things would be better for us.

640
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:26,027
Joe's a good husband,

641
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:28,987
and a dedicated doctor.

642
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:32,101
And I love him.

643
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:37,103
Even if he murdered two people?

644
00:31:40,114 --> 00:31:41,482
That's not possible.

645
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:43,682
Joe could never do that.

646
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:47,530
Let's look at a few pictures.

647
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,701
Lieutenant Michael Jensen,
U.S. Navy diver.

648
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:52,591
Dead.

649
00:31:54,126 --> 00:31:55,153
Martin Lime.

650
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,583
Captain of a salvage ship.

651
00:31:59,105 --> 00:32:00,526
Civilian. He's also dead.

652
00:32:01,598 --> 00:32:03,334
As you can see, Andrea...

653
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:07,932
he's not only capable,
he's actually quite good at killing.

654
00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:10,928
Now, we need you
to help us find him,

655
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,681
or we're going to have to charge you
as an accessory.

656
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,637
I didn't do

657
00:32:20,515 --> 00:32:22,083
anything wrong.

658
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:28,313
Why is this happening?

659
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,035
Lieutenant Jensen's
medical records arrived.

660
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,210
As expected,

661
00:32:34,294 --> 00:32:37,909
the Navy has no indication
of any liver condition.

662
00:32:37,993 --> 00:32:39,597
Records could have been falsified.

663
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:43,461
Yes, sometimes the desire to serve
can override better judgment.

664
00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:45,838
Right. But you don't think
that happened.

665
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:50,933
No, I spoke to the staff physician
at the Experimental Diving Unit.

666
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:55,348
He examined Jensen dozens
of times over the years.

667
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:59,185
And he saw absolutely
no indicators whatsoever

668
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,144
of hemochromatosis, whereas...

669
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:04,514
this gentleman...

670
00:33:05,953 --> 00:33:08,486
shows absolutely every sign.

671
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,698
So this isn't Jensen.

672
00:33:13,298 --> 00:33:14,626
I'm afraid not.

673
00:33:25,093 --> 00:33:26,898
If this isn't Lieutenant Jensen,

674
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:28,313
who's in autopsy?

675
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:30,732
- First question.
- And the second?

676
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:32,802
Where is Lieutenant Jensen?

677
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:34,887
Got a BOLO out.

678
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,689
He's got a pretty good head start
on us, though.

679
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:39,686
Abby finished running
the John Doe's DNA.

680
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,221
- Any hits?
- Any hits?

681
00:33:42,515 --> 00:33:44,576
No, and without a name
to compare it to,

682
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,440
- Ducky's dental mold is useless.
- Find Jensen.

683
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:49,235
We got to I.D. that body.

684
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:52,602
Talk to Metro.
Get a list of missing persons.

685
00:33:52,895 --> 00:33:55,772
- Getting a list of missing persons.
- Time to call the FBI.

686
00:33:55,856 --> 00:33:57,717
Ziva, security footage
at the marina.

687
00:33:58,458 --> 00:33:59,879
I.D. everybody there.

688
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:03,791
Mavrey's personal
medical records, pull them all.

689
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:06,085
- Got it, Boss.
- Medical records?

690
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:09,389
All right, nothing too exciting.

691
00:34:09,473 --> 00:34:11,197
Elevated blood sugar level.

692
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,954
Got good cholesterol.

693
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:15,967
Look at this.
Something interesting here.

694
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:20,099
He had epileptic seizures as a boy
and has a congenital liver disorder.

695
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:40,784
You found my husband.

696
00:34:41,921 --> 00:34:43,917
Where is he at?
I need to see him.

697
00:34:45,964 --> 00:34:47,257
Well, he's...

698
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:49,903
he's here, Andrea.
He's...

699
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:54,249
He's been here all along.

700
00:34:55,775 --> 00:34:57,102
I don't understand.

701
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,143
The dead body
in the wet suit wasn't Jensen.

702
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:04,750
I'm very sorry.

703
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,117
No, that's not possible.

704
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:14,522
The e-mail that he sent me.

705
00:35:15,394 --> 00:35:18,113
Anyone could have accessed
his e-mail.

706
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:20,882
Who?

707
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:23,522
We're working on that.

708
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:27,249
The diving,

709
00:35:27,823 --> 00:35:29,585
the treasure hunting,
that's supposed to be

710
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,129
a hobby, and now you're telling me
he's dead because of it?

711
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,891
Let us help you.

712
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:39,672
Is there anything
you haven't told us?

713
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,220
Because of the...

714
00:35:49,136 --> 00:35:50,259
the lawsuits,

715
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,318
Joe started...

716
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:57,022
taking money out
of his corporate accounts.

717
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,199
Cash.

718
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:02,135
A lot of it.

719
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:05,524
I think that...

720
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:09,867
I think that he was putting it all
into some ridiculous treasure hunt.

721
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:13,782
Hoping that whatever

722
00:36:14,387 --> 00:36:16,058
he found would pay for it all.

723
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:17,575
Well, that's risky.

724
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,619
Yeah, well, Joe was desperate.

725
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:32,064
So Mavrey finances the recovery

726
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,594
of the Calafuego, hires a boat
and pays Jensen to recover the gold.

727
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:36,219
It's a big payday: $200 million.

728
00:36:36,303 --> 00:36:38,962
While Jensen fakes his own death,
kills them, and keeps all the treasure.

729
00:36:39,046 --> 00:36:41,528
- It is like <i>The Sierra Madre</i>.
- Yeah, but who's Bogie?

730
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:45,015
Miss Biloxi, Missy Dawkins...

731
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,261
She just bought
two one-way tickets to Mexico.

732
00:36:48,345 --> 00:36:51,110
The first is in her name:
the second is Michael Jensen.

733
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:54,879
Am I in trouble?

734
00:36:55,895 --> 00:36:56,795
Depends.

735
00:36:57,541 --> 00:36:58,289
On?

736
00:36:58,373 --> 00:36:59,924
On whether you cooperate.

737
00:37:00,449 --> 00:37:03,470
Why don't you tell us where you were
supposed to meet Michael Jensen.

738
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,556
I can't do that.

739
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:07,600
I mean,

740
00:37:08,116 --> 00:37:10,785
I wasn't supposed to meet him.
He said he'd come to me.

741
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,620
You spoke to him?

742
00:37:12,993 --> 00:37:13,993
We texted.

743
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,038
He said his ship had come in,

744
00:37:16,122 --> 00:37:18,956
and I was supposed to buy
two tickets to Mexico, get packed, and

745
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:20,877
be ready to go, but...

746
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,240
He never showed.

747
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:28,662
I knew it was too good to be true.

748
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:31,332
He was using me, huh?

749
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:32,939
You're another decoy.

750
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,472
You buy the ticket, we chase you,

751
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:37,087
buys Jensen time.

752
00:37:39,577 --> 00:37:41,890
I should have known
this was never going to work.

753
00:37:42,258 --> 00:37:44,428
It's not like we really had
anything in common.

754
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:49,133
I mean, besides, he spent all his time
with that rich doctor

755
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:50,976
and his wife.

756
00:37:58,841 --> 00:37:59,767
Yeah. Gibbs.

757
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,330
- <i>Gibbs, I've got something</i>.
- Abs, Abs, can't hear you.

758
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,002
- <i>What? What?</i>
- What's all the noise?

759
00:38:04,086 --> 00:38:05,287
The noise!

760
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,884
- What do you got, Abs?
- Good news.

761
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:11,067
They decided to stick
with the original formula.

762
00:38:11,151 --> 00:38:14,261
So everything in my Caf-POW
universe is okay again.

763
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:15,793
Congratulations.
Anything else?

764
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,651
Okay, so I got to thinking.

765
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:21,741
Why keep a bunch
of museum-quality Spanish coins

766
00:38:21,825 --> 00:38:24,385
in a storage unit that has
no security? Stupid, right?

767
00:38:24,562 --> 00:38:27,290
- Unless they're not museum-quality.
- Is that what you're tumbling?

768
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:31,341
Okay, in theory,
we have $250,000 worth of gold <i>reales</i>.

769
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,726
But look at this.

770
00:38:36,283 --> 00:38:38,077
I added simple boric acid.

771
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,036
It ate away the gold plating.

772
00:38:41,414 --> 00:38:42,364
Not real.

773
00:38:42,477 --> 00:38:45,447
All of this stuff
from Jensen's storage unit,

774
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,862
it's worthless.

775
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:49,233
Jensen's been scamming everybody.

776
00:38:49,317 --> 00:38:51,110
There's no Calafuego treasure.

777
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:54,510
He has been conning Dr. Mavrey
for months, bilking him dry.

778
00:38:54,594 --> 00:38:56,577
He took advantage
of a desperate man.

779
00:38:56,936 --> 00:38:59,610
So, then what was still
worth killing for?

780
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:01,922
A different kind of treasure.

781
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:04,404
Thanks, Abs.

782
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:10,065
- Mrs Mavrey said she never met Jensen.
- She was lying.

783
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,911
Jensen got into it to con the doctor,
but it turned into something else...

784
00:39:12,995 --> 00:39:14,370
something with Mrs. Mavrey.

785
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:17,554
The real treasure's the millions
Mavrey took out of the bank.

786
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:18,605
Wait a minute.

787
00:39:19,074 --> 00:39:20,919
You're saying the widow
and the stud diver...

788
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:22,151
did it together?

789
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,652
Did you hear that?

790
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:26,352
- Yes, what?
- Yes, I heard the wife did it.

791
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:28,072
Yes, you are a genius.

792
00:39:28,316 --> 00:39:30,597
Okay, question.
Where would you hide a lot of money

793
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:32,536
if you were afraid
your house could be seized?

794
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:33,912
Not in my house.

795
00:39:34,112 --> 00:39:35,789
Get over to the clinic, sweep it.

796
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,541
- Meet you at Mavrey's.
- On it, Boss.

797
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:46,050
Look, Michael, the money's not
in the safe or any of the cabinets.

798
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,959
Andrea, it is not
that easy to hide $10 million.

799
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:50,554
We've gone through the whole house.

800
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,875
- Think.
- I am.

801
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:54,496
- Well, we're running out of time.
- You guys looking for something?

802
00:39:55,554 --> 00:39:58,062
- Who the hell are you?
- Came to see the grieving widow.

803
00:39:59,177 --> 00:40:00,952
Guess she's not grieving anymore,
huh?

804
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:04,331
Well, Jensen, I knew
a Navy diver was too smart to drown.

805
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,381
You almost had us.

806
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:09,842
<i>Body Heat.</i>

807
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:12,201
William Hurt, Kathleen Turner.

808
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,996
Hire the stud to kill the husband.
Didn't really work out so well, did it?

809
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:18,230
So, guys, where's the money?

810
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:20,099
I don't know.

811
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,061
We do.

812
00:40:21,612 --> 00:40:24,501
It is amazing the things
people keep in their work lockers.

813
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:27,201
Me, it's just dirty socks
and a Live Aid T-shirt.

814
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:28,300
Geldof signed it.

815
00:40:29,656 --> 00:40:30,803
Mavrey's locker.

816
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:36,433
Did you really think that Jensen
there was going...

817
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,296
to take you with him?

818
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,106
He planned the whole thing.

819
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:44,233
He forced me.
He said he'd kill me if...

820
00:40:44,557 --> 00:40:46,465
- if I didn't go along.
- She's lying.

821
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:50,447
You are under arrest for the murders
of Joseph Mavrey and Martin Lime.

822
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:52,569
It's time to walk the plank, matey.

823
00:40:55,949 --> 00:40:57,875
Agent Borin,
I want to thank you personally

824
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:00,037
for working
so proficiently with NCIS.

825
00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:03,132
Thank you, Director.

826
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,192
Agent Gibbs?

827
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,109
Yeah.

828
00:41:09,146 --> 00:41:09,911
Thanks.

829
00:41:11,331 --> 00:41:13,112
I just got off
the phone with SECNAV.

830
00:41:13,196 --> 00:41:15,519
Now I know turf wars
are unavoidable,

831
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:18,682
but I find that cooperating
with our sister agencies

832
00:41:18,766 --> 00:41:20,227
provides excellent results.

833
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:22,956
Don't you agree, Agent Gibbs?

834
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:25,674
Yeah, sure.

835
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:30,679
Well, hopefully,
we can do it again soon.

836
00:41:31,111 --> 00:41:32,114
Anytime.

837
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,635
You know where to find me.

838
00:41:40,643 --> 00:41:41,502
Likewise.

839
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:46,555
Are you ready
for the adventure of a lifetime?

840
00:41:47,899 --> 00:41:49,369
It is just a movie, Tony.

841
00:41:51,086 --> 00:41:52,134
How dare you.

842
00:41:52,726 --> 00:41:54,243
Is Mickey just a mouse?

843
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:56,182
Ringling Brothers just a circus?

844
00:41:56,755 --> 00:41:57,539
Yes.

845
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:02,110
Well, you see,
that's why you don't have any friends.

846
00:42:02,742 --> 00:42:03,937
I do have friends.

847
00:42:05,518 --> 00:42:08,233
Really, then,
what are you doing with me,

848
00:42:08,581 --> 00:42:11,234
watching a movie
on a Friday night at work, huh?

849
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,698
You are my friend.

850
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:16,285
Really?

851
00:42:19,347 --> 00:42:20,056
No.

852
00:42:22,717 --> 00:42:23,898
My date cancelled.

853
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:27,252
Mine, too.
