00:00:02,612 --> 00:00:03,821
Code name Domino.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,357
Langer was in possession of Domino
when Lee killed him.

4
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:08,133
We're gonna steal it.
Nobody gets hurt.

5
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,101
It was a trap.
There's a mole at NCIS.

6
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:14,515
- You mean, Langer was not alone?
- Do you know who it is?

7
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,141
- Langer!
- He wasn't part of it.

8
00:00:16,223 --> 00:00:18,001
- Who are they?!
- I don't know!

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,266
This is Amanda.
She's my daughter.

10
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:24,474
If I don't deliver what they want,
they will kill her.

11
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:26,026
What am I supposed to do?

12
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:28,437
Looks like we're working together.

13
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:48,960
Hey, stop!
Come back!

14
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:50,344
Hey...

15
00:00:56,249 --> 00:00:57,011
Hey!

16
00:00:58,918 --> 00:00:59,993
All right.

Thanks.

23
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:49,900
- You know what I hate?
- Women with discriminating taste?

24
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:52,040
Coffee shops without restrooms.

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,101
You're not actually drinking that,
are you? We're on a stakeout.

26
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:57,072
I was up late last night.
I'm tired.

27
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:59,614
- What?
- This is Probie 101 stuff.

28
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:02,253
You don't actually drink.
I call it the Gibb-sip.

29
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:07,066
- See that?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,630
- Looks like I'm drinking?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:10,357
Not actually drinking.

32
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:11,993
And I've been...

33
00:02:12,815 --> 00:02:15,213
Come to think of it,
it always looks like Gibbs is drinking,

34
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:18,076
- but he never has to take a...
- <i>DiNozzo, change</i> the subject.

35
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:20,330
<i>Gonna have to change more
than the subject</i>

36
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,458
<i>if I don't get a bathroom break soon,
boss.</i>

37
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:24,019
Hold it.

38
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:26,786
Lee's on your ten, DiNozzo.

39
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:31,026
Got her on my crosshairs.
Finger on the trigger.

40
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:34,923
Show some sympathy, Tony.
Her daughter's out there somewhere.

41
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,614
She lied about killing two men,
lied about stealing secrets,

42
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:40,998
how do we know she's not lying about
her daughter, who nobody's ever seen?

43
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,703
The pickup man shows, she's not lying.

44
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:46,547
Here you go. Coffee drip.

45
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:47,934
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

46
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:00,623
Either Lee is very anal,
or she's sending someone a signal.

47
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:04,681
I smell a non-fat soy
double-cross latte.

48
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:22,120
Here we go.

49
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:25,244
Boss, we got a guy in a scarf,
sunglasses and a hat.

50
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,832
<i>That's him.
On his tail,</i> DiNozzo.

51
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:29,418
<i>Got him.</i>

52
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:36,434
Oh, my God!
I am so sorry.

53
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:39,636
<i>- Lost visual. Get on him.</i>
- I know. No.

54
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:41,266
- Get out of my way.
- Sorry, sir.

55
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:43,355
- I got him. Where is he?
- Parking structure.

56
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:44,932
Just let me get that. I'm so...

57
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:53,329
Boss, we lost him.

58
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:56,472
- Lee, what the hell were you thinking?
- You were too close.

59
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:59,020
- He could have made you.
- My show. My call.

60
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:00,437
My car. Now.

61
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:04,949
- Heard you had a little accident.
- Wasn't an accident.

62
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,622
Any news about my daughter?

63
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,396
NSA got a hit.
They're downloading the footage now.

64
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:11,400
NSA?

65
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,745
- Does Gibbs know?
- Know about what?

66
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:15,989
Do they have something?

67
00:04:16,342 --> 00:04:17,589
We had something.

68
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:20,788
The pickup man in perfect position
before you blew it with the brew.

69
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:22,039
He knows my routine.

70
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:24,056
I felt I may have been compromised.

71
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:26,156
Look, I did my part. I made the drop.

72
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:28,519
But I couldn't risk him seeing
anything unusual.

73
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:30,352
- What do you know about him?
- Nothing.

74
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:32,912
I only see him when
he's expecting a drop at the cafe.

75
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:35,842
- Always the same guy?
- He hides his face. I try not to stare.

76
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:38,206
- Yeah?
<i>- Footage coming in.</i>

77
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,407
O.K. On our way.
McGee's ready for us in MTAC, boss.

78
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:43,361
It's a restricted area.
You're not invited.

79
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:46,109
No. She is invited.
We need confirmation.

80
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,351
You got eyes on her, right?

81
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,304
- What about this morning?
- Her rope got shorter.

82
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,396
- Lucky she's not hanging by it.
<i>- It's online now, Agent McGee.</i>

83
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:10,944
Working off what Abby gave us,
an NSA satellite came up

84
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:14,506
with this thermal footage early this
morning over Hickory Grove, Virginia.

85
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,358
Found unusual activity.

86
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,019
We convinced NSA
to give us a look at photos

87
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,149
from one of
their keyhole imaging satellites.

88
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:25,458
This is 4:14:46 AM.

89
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:27,712
No facial recognition on the man.

90
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,539
He never looked up.

91
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,463
We had better luck
with the girl, though.

92
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,875
You recognize her?

93
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:35,377
Amanda.

94
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:47,803
Looks like Lee was telling the truth.

95
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:49,534
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

96
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:52,602
It is a little girl
being chased into a field.

97
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:54,710
- Maybe that's the plan.
- What plan?

98
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:55,870
Exactly.

99
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:58,511
All right.
Coordinates are done programming.

100
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,412
GPS will take you to the spot
where the girl was last seen.

101
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:03,727
There's a built-in compass in there
so you don't get lost.

102
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,032
Don't worry, McScout.

103
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,939
We got our Mossad hunting dog.

104
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:08,118
Bark once for yes.

105
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:11,930
- I'm going with you.
- You're not going anywhere.

106
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:15,752
Sit.

107
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,336
- Sir?
- You still talking?

108
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:19,968
Why are you still here?

109
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:22,211
McGee, photos.

110
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:26,689
Okay. Now, we can't see their...

111
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:30,811
Sorry, boss.

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,009
Can't see their faces,
but based on height and build relative

113
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:37,436
to Agent Lee and the little girl, we
are looking at two very different guys.

114
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:40,585
I only get text-message instructions
from one person.

115
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:42,735
- It could be either one.
- Or neither one.

116
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:44,844
Someone else
could be pulling the strings.

117
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,491
Take her to the conference room.

118
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:47,899
- And do what?
- Watch her.

119
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,190
Shouldn't I at least take a laptop?
At least get an ID?

120
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,955
Let Abby do that.
Your eyes are gonna be on her.

121
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,256
- Are we looking for three people?
- Don't know.

122
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,745
Someone's taken the bait.

123
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:05,079
Thinks he's gotten away
with a sample of Domino

124
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,964
that details how
our military will respond

125
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:10,492
to an attack on
a communications link in Israel.

126
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:11,705
And he'll test it.

127
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,372
Then wait and see if
our response matches his info.

128
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,053
It's the only way to prove to him
Lee has access to the complete Domino.

129
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,833
SECNAV doesn't share your enthusiasm.

130
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:25,261
Lee is the only way to get
to the top of that pyramid.

131
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:27,345
And to get her daughter back.

132
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:31,890
SECNAV wants the pickup man
picked up at the next opportunity.

133
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:33,281
That's a bad idea.

134
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:35,219
Maybe. But it's an order.

135
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:47,164
Were you able to trace
any of the text messages from him?

136
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:53,621
Because of the level of
SMS encryption he was using,

137
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:55,428
along with the fact that he

138
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:58,582
masked the signal by bouncing
it halfway around the world, no.

139
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:02,806
Whoever this guy is,
he knows how to hide.

140
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:05,408
Well, what about
the messages I sent him?

141
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:06,558
Sorry.

142
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:11,158
You have a sister, don't you, McGee?

143
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:17,386
You once withheld evidence in
a murder investigation to protect her.

144
00:08:17,653 --> 00:08:19,085
She was eventually cleared.

145
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:21,625
Yeah, but you didn't know that
at the time.

146
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:28,605
You did what you had to do...

147
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,520
to save someone close to you...

148
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:34,540
because you were scared for her.

149
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,460
I know I'm going to have to pay
for what I did.

150
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:44,616
I'm just saying, don't judge me without
remembering who I was scared for.

151
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,503
How can you work with somebody for
3 years and not know they have a kid?

152
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,103
Just because you work with somebody
every day does not mean you know

153
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:02,500
everything about them.

154
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:06,593
Really? Then I shouldn't know about
that tattoo on the inside of your...

155
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:09,927
I meant, I can understand someone
wanting to keep their personal

156
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,819
and professional lives separate.
As should you.

157
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:17,110
Did not end well when you fell in love
while you were undercover, did it?

158
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:20,824
Thanks for the memory.

159
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,217
Trail starts here,
continues off northwest.

160
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,348
<i>North by northwest.</i>

161
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,231
I'm talking about espionage,
"Judy, Judy, Judy".

162
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:34,174
Cary Grant, Leo G. Carroll.
Sound familiar?

163
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:35,242
Ready for a hike?

164
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:37,156
Can't we drive?

165
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,324
If we end up hanging off Lincoln's nose,
this is really gonna suck.

166
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:48,029
How'd it go?

167
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:51,099
That's an inappropriate question,
McGee. Tag! You're it.

168
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,225
She wouldn't say a word to me
in there.

169
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,510
She's usually
the sympathetic one, right?

170
00:09:56,615 --> 00:09:58,474
Abby has her own code.

171
00:09:58,727 --> 00:09:59,695
Stand here.

172
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,738
- In the doorway?
- Yeah, in the doorway.

173
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:04,835
- Any hits on the pickup man?
- Nothing yet.

174
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:08,158
Like most things, it would go faster
if there were two people working on it.

175
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:11,338
But since you're baby-sitting
the P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R...

176
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,309
- I can spell, Abby.
- Really?

177
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:17,435
Okay, how about T-R-U-S-T?

178
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:20,265
Look,

179
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,474
McGee told me you had
something to do with the satellites

180
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:26,376
that helped find my daughter,
and I just wanted to thank you.

181
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:28,186
How did you do it?

182
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,613
I analyzed your daughter's hair
using the samples

183
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:35,891
the blackmailer
sent as proof of life.

184
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:40,082
As far as a person's diet goes,
hair is like a time machine.

185
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:42,475
The longer the hair,
the further back we can travel.

186
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:44,946
We can find out what
she's been eating, drinking,

187
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:47,809
- the vitamins and nutrients.
- Is she healthy?

188
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:50,965
Yeah. She is.

189
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:54,154
Hair grows about
a half an inch a month.

190
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:57,988
I cut a strand into equal sections,
and I analyzed each portion.

191
00:10:58,235 --> 00:11:00,941
After she was kidnapped,
your daughter's drinking habits changed.

192
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:03,414
Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios,

193
00:11:03,493 --> 00:11:05,105
they vary by region.

194
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,750
But since most water supplies
are tested by law, we could

195
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:10,658
pinpoint a general location.

196
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:13,478
The water she was drinking
was from eastern Prince William County.

197
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:15,250
NSA kept an eye out for her.

198
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,481
It's like a spot in the dark,
a hot spot.

199
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,932
- Two, as it turned out.
- That was then.

200
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:23,119
Yesterday's news, Gibbs.

201
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:26,466
Just got to hop back in the DeLorean
and get back to today's problems.

202
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:29,583
- Can I have McGee back, please?
- Tony needs me to call him.

203
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,342
- Probably got lost.
- Yeah, go.

204
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,044
Thank you, Abby.

205
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:37,319
I mean it.

206
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:43,064
Okay, listen.
So what I didn't tell her is,

207
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,395
until we get the full DNA
test results back,

208
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,057
we don't even know if
that hair belongs to her daughter.

209
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:54,232
<i>Define lost, McGee.
I know exactly where we are.</i>

210
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:57,406
<i>We're between a tree and a bush.
Directly underneath the earth's sun.</i>

211
00:11:57,706 --> 00:12:00,133
You're not showing up on the map.
Let me restart the scan.

212
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:01,632
<i>You might want to hurry.</i>

213
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:03,394
Ziva's turning in circles.

214
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,945
Either the trail's gone cold
or she's about to mark her territory.

215
00:12:07,456 --> 00:12:09,020
Got it. Locating.

216
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:12,630
Tony, you're about six miles
from where you started.

217
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:16,235
Kid must have been scared out
of her mind.

218
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:19,513
<i>McGPS, are we close to anything?</i>

219
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,451
All right, Tony, there's a structure
on the other side of those woods.

220
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:26,873
It's 200 yards northwest.
It's the only building around for miles.

221
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,125
I got it.

222
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:31,251
That way. 200 yards.

223
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:41,820
Someone
has been coming here regularly.

224
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:51,548
Clear.

225
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:56,370
This is not right.

226
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,822
Yeah, we're gonna have to walk
all the way back to the car.

227
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:01,409
No. This room
is smaller than it should be.

228
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,462
Did look bigger from the outside.

229
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,436
Creepy.

230
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:36,619
She has been moved.

231
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,481
Looks like the help's been fired.

232
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:58,815
Boss, we found something.
It's not good.

233
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:00,583
- Yeah, go.
<i>- The dead body.</i>

234
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:01,717
Our kidnapper.

235
00:14:03,048 --> 00:14:03,889
Full rigor.

236
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:07,192
I'd say he was killed shortly after
we saw him grab the girl on satellite.

237
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,633
Gunshot to the head.
Execution-style.

238
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:12,743
- Should keep<i> Ducky busy.</i>
- No, he won't.

239
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,558
- He won't?
<i>- No.</i>

240
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:18,117
- We're not coming.
- <i>Boss</i>, this is a crime scene.

241
00:14:18,177 --> 00:14:20,819
<i>Yeah, I know.</i> Document everything.
Get the hell out of there.

242
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:22,836
<i>Whoever's behind this
could come back.</i>

243
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:24,107
Got it.

244
00:14:25,353 --> 00:14:27,073
All right.
Wrap it up, shutterbug.

245
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:28,881
- We're bailing.
- We're leaving?

246
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:30,329
Yeah. We are leaving.

247
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,686
He is staying. Gibbs doesn't want
any lights, cameras action.

248
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,603
In case the guy who shot him
comes back.

249
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:35,458
Wait.

250
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:39,471
No refrigerator. No food storage.

251
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:41,335
He must have brought in supplies.

252
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:44,641
The little girl realizes the routine.
She makes a run for it. He catches her.

253
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,387
And when the boss hears
that she got away...

254
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:50,360
He can't trust him or the safe house.
Kills the guy, moves the girl.

255
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,822
- Speaking of moving, let's go.
- Here.

256
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:55,638
Hairs from her hairbrush.

257
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,113
- Were you able to lift any prints?
- I got the prints off the dead guy.

258
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:00,998
The rest of the place is wiped clean.

259
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:04,351
- What is this?
- Blood. Come on. Let's go.

260
00:15:04,597 --> 00:15:05,604
Ketchup.

261
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:16,415
She was counting
the days with her lunch.

262
00:15:17,971 --> 00:15:19,018
Brave girl.

263
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:22,793
Forensic evidence
requires some evidence.

264
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:27,885
Of late I have had too many bodies
or none at all.

265
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:29,835
I'm not here about a dead body.

266
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:32,922
Yes, well, I hope you didn't come down
to ask for more patience.

267
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:34,831
I am not a patient man.

268
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,122
Which led me to realize
that our blackmailer is.

269
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,895
- Patient.
- He's had the girl for eight months.

270
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:44,276
He's also methodical, calculating,

271
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,854
confident in his ability
to plan and execute.

272
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:48,981
To wit.

273
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:54,543
Everything from tank tops
to winter coats.

274
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:57,248
From summer through winter
and back again.

275
00:15:57,552 --> 00:16:00,537
And even when Domino
was first compromised

276
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:03,160
and Agent Langer was killed,
he didn't alter his plans.

277
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,874
He merely extended his contingencies.

278
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:08,879
So? Lee lays low for two months.

279
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:12,764
Our blackmailer works slowly,
deliberately.

280
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:14,436
And yet,

281
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:17,714
he killed this man
and moved the girl within hours

282
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:20,536
of her near-escape.
Fast and slow.

283
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,620
The man is a contradiction.

284
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:26,007
He only has compassion
when it suits him,

285
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,226
cruelty when it's called for.

286
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,335
I believe the poker term
is "grinder".

287
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:33,790
Okay.
Go on.

288
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:36,730
Well, the only way to get at him is

289
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,138
to make him believe
he has the winning hand.

290
00:16:39,811 --> 00:16:41,204
He needs to feel safe

291
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:44,055
so that he can show all his cards.
Otherwise...

292
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:47,232
- He folds.
- Goes back to waiting.

293
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:49,259
What about the girl?

294
00:16:50,915 --> 00:16:52,159
Unfortunately,

295
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,640
he no longer will see her
as his victim, but

296
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:58,085
more as a witness to be disposed of.

297
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:07,940
Did you find her?

298
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,716
I'm here to relieve you.

299
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:10,953
Thanks.

300
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:14,635
Have fun.

301
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:17,134
Sit down.

302
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:26,043
No, we didn't find her.
Just where she's been held.

303
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:29,868
Okay, what did you find exactly?

304
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:33,341
He moved her.
That's all we know.

305
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:36,653
And if he moved her,
it means she's alive.

306
00:17:36,976 --> 00:17:37,932
Anything else?

307
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,872
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't want you to say anything.

308
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:45,500
Had enough of your lies.

309
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:50,591
This has never been about me.

310
00:17:51,018 --> 00:17:53,119
They had Amanda. I had no choice.

311
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:57,825
This is for your drop tomorrow.

312
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,204
Same routine?

313
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:01,998
Except we're gonna grab
your pickup man.

314
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,861
And this time you're not gonna
burn us or me with your coffee.

315
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:07,239
You can't arrest him.
He could lead us to my daughter.

316
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:08,682
We should be following him.

317
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:13,077
Only person
I'm gonna be following is you.

318
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:18,470
Home. Now.
Get your things.

319
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:22,727
Thank you, sir.

320
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,704
Hi, what can I get you?

321
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:29,799
- Large drip and a paper.
- No problem.

322
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,863
- Your eighty-five.
- Thank you.

323
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,512
Same routine.

324
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:42,629
- I'm having a splash back.
- She must be nervous.

325
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,248
You're so naive, McGullible.

326
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:48,562
Tony, I spent the morning with her.
I think I gained a little insight.

327
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:50,980
Really?

328
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:53,554
Hey, let me get that for you.

329
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:55,564
What are you doing?

330
00:18:55,794 --> 00:18:58,620
Removing the wool she's pulled
over your eyes.

331
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:01,587
Got a little more.

332
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:03,295
Hey, come-come on!

333
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:05,868
I'm not saying I trust her.
Okay?

334
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:07,913
I'm just saying I understand her.

335
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:09,191
A little.

336
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,419
<i>Boss. Lipstick.</i> Off routine.
She could be sending <i>a signal.</i>

337
00:19:16,504 --> 00:19:17,379
Hold.

338
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:21,473
<i>Hi, good. How are you?</i>

339
00:19:27,268 --> 00:19:29,580
Who would be low enough
to kidnap a little girl?

340
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,795
It's a good question.

341
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,328
- Answer?
- My gosh.

342
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,558
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, sir.

343
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,990
It's just that you've never been
down here. Before. Alone.

344
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,849
It's just weird.
I mean, not like kissing-your-brother

345
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:44,392
weird, but more like new weird.
Like the first time you put your feet in

346
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:46,100
- Jell-O weird.
- What do you got?

347
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,504
It's Abs. Gibbs calls me Abs.
"What do you got, Abs?"

348
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:53,043
You're doing a Gibbs impression?

349
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,258
No, I'm doing Vance.
What do you got, Abs?

350
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,029
See, now that's better. It needs work.

351
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,775
Like a little more swagger.
A little gravitas.

352
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,935
But you still weren't doing
a Gibbs impression.

353
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,885
Sciuto.

354
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:07,637
Extra weird.

355
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Okay...

356
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,463
I matched six points
on the dead man's fingerprints,

357
00:20:12,627 --> 00:20:13,866
but there's no data.

358
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:17,358
There's no banking records,
no address, no credit history.

359
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:19,517
The information's been deleted.

360
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,989
- His identity's erased.
- A spy?

361
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:29,587
What?

362
00:20:29,652 --> 00:20:30,995
It's the test results

363
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:34,229
found on the hairs in the little girl's
bedroom/prison.

364
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,840
Okay, most of them
match the little girl.

365
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,989
But there's one different strand here.
Based on the amount

366
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,256
of hair spray around the cortex,
I'd say it comes from an unknown female.

367
00:20:43,316 --> 00:20:44,679
Blackmailer is a woman?

368
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:48,819
Well, women can be criminals, too.
Like Agent Lee.

369
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:55,129
Heard about your techie mojo.

370
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,589
Not that we talk about you
behind your back.

371
00:20:57,664 --> 00:20:58,798
Appreciate that.

372
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:02,476
It's the final DNA analysis
of Lee's daughter's hair.

373
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:05,231
Leon...

374
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:10,159
Too soon for the Leon?

375
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:13,825
Sorry.

376
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:15,458
This is bad.

377
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:20,687
<i>Heads up. The invisible man is back.</i>

378
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:32,654
Something's wrong, boss.

379
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:34,170
<i>She's not leaving.</i>

380
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,972
- We got a problem.
- What?

381
00:21:43,283 --> 00:21:45,323
DNA came back
on the little girl's hair.

382
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:47,149
She is not Lee's daughter.

383
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:48,701
No relation.

384
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,424
Lee's lying.

385
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:00,444
- Tell me where my daughter is.
- Put it down.

386
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,989
- Give me the paper.
- Drop it! Let go!

387
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:05,440
Give me the paper!
No, you're screwing everything up!

388
00:22:05,515 --> 00:22:07,107
Now what if he's watching?

389
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:10,609
- He'll kill her!
- Who, Amanda?

390
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,731
My wife!

391
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:29,865
Not your damn daughter.

392
00:22:31,286 --> 00:22:34,007
- DNA tests, they don't lie.
- She's my sister.

393
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,133
I raised her from the time
she was six months old.

394
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:39,065
I'm the only mother
she's ever known.

395
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,201
Who is she?

396
00:22:40,972 --> 00:22:42,226
My parents adopted her.

397
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:44,894
And when then they died, I promised

398
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:47,200
that I would look after her,
protect her.

399
00:22:47,297 --> 00:22:48,949
By killing two innocent people?

400
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,819
To save her life.

401
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:55,167
Every night I went to bed
praying for this to be over.

402
00:22:55,247 --> 00:22:58,767
And every morning,
I wake up knowing that it wouldn't be.

403
00:22:59,717 --> 00:23:01,886
Don't tell me
you don't know what this is.

404
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:04,725
Thought I'd care more
if she was your daughter?

405
00:23:05,396 --> 00:23:07,724
You wouldn't do what I did
to save your daughter's life?

406
00:23:09,982 --> 00:23:11,773
This time you tell the truth.

407
00:23:13,956 --> 00:23:16,304
You should have come to me
as soon as it happened!

408
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:22,224
Before you murdered two men.

409
00:23:30,362 --> 00:23:31,703
Ted Bankston.

410
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,580
Former NSA analyst.

411
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:35,123
Yes.

412
00:23:35,204 --> 00:23:37,209
Says you left NSA 12 months ago,

413
00:23:38,275 --> 00:23:40,879
accused of mishandling
classified information.

414
00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:42,651
Yes.

415
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:45,967
Did you?

416
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,083
Yes.

417
00:23:47,787 --> 00:23:49,290
I stole information.

418
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,058
When you lost your security clearance,
you need to find a new source.

419
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:54,850
What?
No.

420
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:57,729
You hired this guy to grab the girl,
you blackmailed Lee.

421
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:00,065
No, I've never seen him.

422
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:01,399
Where's the girl?

423
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,567
You're getting everything wrong!

424
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:05,281
I don't have anybody.

425
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:07,623
He has my wife,

426
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,989
and if I don't deliver
the rest of Domino...

427
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:12,989
he will kill her.

428
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,746
How do you know he has your wife?

429
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:21,211
He sends these

430
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:24,423
in little envelopes.

431
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:29,469
How long?

432
00:24:30,348 --> 00:24:31,488
Almost a year.

433
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:34,603
I thought when I left the NSA,

434
00:24:34,885 --> 00:24:35,767
it would end.

435
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:38,812
But now he uses me
as a drop man for Lee.

436
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:43,358
I will tell you whatever
you want to know,

437
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,415
go wherever you want me to go.

438
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,876
Just tell me that
you won't let my wife die.

439
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:57,831
What do you do with
the information Lee passes you?

440
00:24:57,944 --> 00:24:59,151
He texts me.

441
00:24:59,996 --> 00:25:02,251
Then he sends me different
places to make a drop.

442
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,365
You ever seen him?

443
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:05,046
No, not in person.

444
00:25:05,228 --> 00:25:06,481
But you've spoken to him?

445
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,586
A few times.

446
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:09,230
Via computer.

447
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,836
He calls himself "The Weather Man".

448
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:17,392
Like he can predict the future,
tomorrow's weather, you know?

449
00:25:17,657 --> 00:25:20,080
He wants to access Domino

450
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,038
to predict US military responses,

451
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,193
troop movements. Why?

452
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,485
Money.

453
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:32,741
A pipeline is targeted in Israel.

454
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,244
The Pentagon moves the US Sixth Fleet
to the Middle East.

455
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,621
World market

456
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,707
flinches.

457
00:25:40,326 --> 00:25:43,382
The price of everything
changes right overnight.

458
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:46,509
Oil, commodities, airlines,

459
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:48,381
real estate, currency.

460
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,591
Buys and sells stocks.

461
00:25:50,673 --> 00:25:53,178
And he makes millions every day

462
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,191
simply by knowing one thing:

463
00:25:56,698 --> 00:25:59,417
what's going to happen tomorrow.

464
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:07,241
And I don't know if my wife's
even going to be alive tomorrow.

465
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,323
Boss, NSA report you requested.

466
00:26:13,663 --> 00:26:16,277
- Bankston?
- Back story checks out.

467
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:18,828
Dates, reason he left the NSA,
everything.

468
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:20,997
- Yeah, Gibbs.
<i>- My office.</i>

469
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,499
On my way.

470
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,102
What do you got, Abs?

471
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:29,005
Okay.

472
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:32,292
Hair on the left
is from the cabin in Virginia.

473
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:34,675
Hair on the right
is from Bankston's wife.

474
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:36,096
They match.

475
00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:38,890
Bankston's wife was kept there, too?

476
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:40,642
Oh, it gets worse.

477
00:26:40,744 --> 00:26:44,621
Both hairs are missing a cellular
protein sheath that's called...

478
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,071
No difference what it's called.

479
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:49,191
What really matters
is that it's missing.

480
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:50,273
Missing what?

481
00:26:50,495 --> 00:26:52,599
Well, hair and fingernail roots,

482
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:55,058
they can show of decomposition,
just like a body.

483
00:26:55,118 --> 00:26:57,115
Proteins break down
and moisture is lost.

484
00:26:57,175 --> 00:26:59,995
- Things that will only happen...
- After death.

485
00:27:00,293 --> 00:27:02,747
Bankston's proof of life
was actually proof of death.

486
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:06,376
His wife is already dead, Gibbs.

487
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:11,318
<i>Communications tower
was destroyed this morning...</i>

488
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:13,940
We've got the world
jumping through hoops.

489
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,761
Blackmailer knows that Domino's real,

490
00:27:16,994 --> 00:27:18,691
least the part we gave him.

491
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:19,751
So now what?

492
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:21,766
Bankston's gonna tell him the truth.

493
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:23,080
Lee's got him.

494
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:27,136
He refuses to hand over the complete
Domino until he hands over the girl.

495
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:28,846
It's risky.

496
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:33,292
Oh, you haven't heard
the risky part yet, Leon.

497
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,448
Going to need the real Domino.

498
00:27:37,827 --> 00:27:39,242
That's not gonna happen.

499
00:27:39,461 --> 00:27:42,120
He finds out it's a fake,
that girl dies.

500
00:27:45,215 --> 00:27:48,389
Paperwork authorizing use
of the real Domino.

501
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:49,753
Needs your signature.

502
00:27:52,576 --> 00:27:54,758
We're not risking
our government's military playbook.

503
00:27:54,912 --> 00:27:57,010
You are authorized to use a decoy.

504
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:58,266
That's it.

505
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:02,557
Good luck.

506
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,820
He should have contacted me by now.
What if he got spooked?

507
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:17,906
And what about my wife?

508
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:21,384
Domino's the bait.

509
00:28:21,678 --> 00:28:23,540
Girl's the ploy.
We're keeping it simple.

510
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:26,948
That's him.

511
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:33,338
Tell him Lee has Domino.

512
00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:46,226
She has a gun on him.

513
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:49,072
Tell him he gets Domino
when she gets her girl.

514
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:55,860
I'm just going to type what you say.

515
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,158
- Deal?
- Deal.

516
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:06,953
Tell McGee Adam's Tavern
is the dead drop.

517
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:08,665
Unmarked units
patrolling a five-block

518
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:10,958
radius around the bar,
additional agents on the inside.

519
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,607
Evidence garage, five minutes.
You got him.

520
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:18,273
- Do I get one of those?
- No.

521
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:20,921
Sorry.

522
00:29:21,597 --> 00:29:22,569
Me, too.

523
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:26,709
You've pled
your case with everyone else.

524
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,101
Why not me?

525
00:29:28,254 --> 00:29:30,854
I'm done trying to explain.
No one understands.

526
00:29:32,098 --> 00:29:33,021
I do.

527
00:29:37,707 --> 00:29:38,945
You would do what I did?

528
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:45,158
Is that too tight?

529
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:47,421
It's fine.

530
00:29:48,738 --> 00:29:49,738
Thank you.

531
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,940
I'm never going to see
my daughter again, am I?

532
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,091
Probably not.

533
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:02,384
<i>Agent DiNozzo,
we're ready for audio check.</i>

534
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,179
Audio check, one, two, three.

535
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:06,623
Agents at each exit.

536
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:09,142
Nobody gets made.
This guy is going to be watching.

537
00:30:09,223 --> 00:30:10,543
Agent Gibbs.

538
00:30:10,897 --> 00:30:11,948
Yeah, I got it.

539
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:13,888
- Go.
- All right, people, let's move out.

540
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:15,230
You're going to need this.

541
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,787
The Pentagon let you
have the real Domino?

542
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:27,827
They just arrived at the rendezvous,
Director.

543
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:30,291
Thank you.

544
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:36,481
- Yes, Mr. Sec...
<i>- Domino's been...</i>

545
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:37,420
When did...?

546
00:30:38,543 --> 00:30:41,241
<i>It was downloaded from your office.
Special Agent...</i>

547
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:42,231
I assure you...

548
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,051
<i>An element of your plan
you opted not to...</i>

549
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,914
- Our plan is...
<i>- Do I come down there</i>

550
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:48,301
<i>and personally oversee
every decision that you make?!</i>

551
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:50,417
I'll deal with it immediately, Sir.

552
00:30:50,477 --> 00:30:51,477
<i>Do that.</i>

553
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:56,939
- Something wrong, Director?
- SECNAV.

554
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,401
Somebody hacked into
the Defense Intelligence computer,

555
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:03,692
downloaded Domino, the real Domino.

556
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,574
They traced it back
to your computer, McGee.

557
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:10,411
You and Gibbs
have just committed treason.

558
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:45,669
<i>We're live, Boss.</i>

559
00:31:46,058 --> 00:31:47,949
Look at him. Man's an artist.

560
00:31:49,512 --> 00:31:50,864
Fake stakeout drinking.

561
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:52,620
Watch the Adam's apple move.

562
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,789
Yet, no actual consumption.

563
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,323
We've got a lot to learn, Ziva.

564
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,658
Okay, I'll be right back
with your drinks.

565
00:32:12,827 --> 00:32:13,641
Yeah?

566
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,184
- Shut it down.
- Well, it's a little late for that.

567
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:19,564
I know you downloaded the real Domino.
Damn it. Shut it down!

568
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:22,423
Hold on a second, Leon?

569
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:29,028
I'm a little busy here.
Call you back.

570
00:32:43,214 --> 00:32:44,338
<i>Okay, we're up.</i>

571
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,843
Ready to order?

572
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:53,068
I said I'd call you back.

573
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,224
- You did?
- What, Abs?

574
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,268
- I figured it out, Gibbs.
- What?

575
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:00,855
<i>Our dead kidnapper's identity...
or, actually it's his </i>non-identity.

576
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,815
Very busy here, Abby.

577
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,555
- <i>Do you want to call me back?</i>
- No, I want you to talk <i>faster</i>.

578
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:06,819
Faster, okay.

579
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:09,794
<i>NSA finally returned my call, which is
good, because I was starting to think </i>

580
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:13,054
that their cooperation on the satellite
<i>thing was just a one-night stand.</i>

581
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,703
And I wouldn't want NCIS to get
the reputation of being easy...

582
00:33:16,548 --> 00:33:19,562
<i>Our dead kidnapper's real name
is Paul Winton,</i>

583
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,202
<i>witness in an </i>NSA/FBI
joint investigation,

584
00:33:22,262 --> 00:33:25,504
<i>put into FBI witness protection.
New identity, new location.</i>

585
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,299
<i>Lived in a safe house, which
is four blocks from where you are now.</i>

586
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,967
- Address.
- <i>1815 </i>Longview.

587
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:33,888
<i>I ran the power records.</i>
There's some massive juice use.

588
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:35,916
Take a breath, Abs.
<i>You've earned it.</i>

589
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:40,728
Ziva. FBI safe house,
1815 Longview.

590
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,473
<i>Take the agent from the south exit.</i>

591
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:46,105
You stay put.

592
00:33:56,624 --> 00:33:57,624
Boss, I'll go.

593
00:33:58,459 --> 00:33:59,459
Do it.

594
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,980
DiNozzo, David...
where are they going?

595
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,432
North, fast.

596
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,019
- I want to talk to them.
- Already dialing.

597
00:34:25,294 --> 00:34:26,588
They're not answering.

598
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,079
Clear.

599
00:34:37,406 --> 00:34:38,578
What the hell is this?

600
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:42,331
Computers.

601
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:44,381
I'm glad you're here.

602
00:35:18,151 --> 00:35:20,464
Hey, probie, what am I looking at?

603
00:35:20,524 --> 00:35:22,246
<i>A career in</i> the fast food industry.

604
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:23,873
Director Vance, how are you, sir?

605
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,501
It looks like
sequentially linked network racks.

606
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:29,003
I'd say he's developed
his own Internet hub.

607
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:32,256
That's how he covered
his stock purchases.

608
00:35:32,378 --> 00:35:35,634
Could make it look like 500 different
sellers when it was just one: him.

609
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,007
He's using an auto-response program.

610
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,181
Doesn't have to be here
to send text messages.

611
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,725
I have to call you back.

612
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:44,807
DiNozzo...

613
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:58,783
Still breathing.

614
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:01,326
Sleeping pills.

615
00:36:06,654 --> 00:36:07,973
This is not good.

616
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:15,011
Be careful, Tony.

617
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,051
There's some kind of pressure plate.

618
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:18,010
A bomb?

619
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,366
Electrical circuit.
Hardwired

620
00:36:21,803 --> 00:36:24,308
into the grid.
Powers the computers.

621
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:26,018
She's part of the circuit.

622
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,260
Cut the power?

623
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,104
No, no, no.
May cause a surge.

624
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:32,275
Cooks the computers,
destroys the evidence

625
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,277
and her.

626
00:36:33,474 --> 00:36:35,486
Backup plan in case
he didn't make it.

627
00:36:36,046 --> 00:36:39,030
She wakes up, shifts her weight off
the pressure plate.

628
00:36:39,112 --> 00:36:40,093
Same result.

629
00:36:42,237 --> 00:36:43,995
You ever seen <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?

630
00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:47,431
How much do you think she weighs?

631
00:36:48,798 --> 00:36:52,111
- How much does a gallon of water weigh?
- Eight pounds.

632
00:36:56,604 --> 00:36:58,122
Cover the exits.

633
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:01,085
Shut down the alarm.

634
00:37:01,145 --> 00:37:02,407
Lock it down.

635
00:37:07,462 --> 00:37:09,270
Search everyone.
No one leaves.

636
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,729
I'm gonna say 43 pounds.

637
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:11,689
More.

638
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:16,000
Too late, got to move her.

639
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,697
Now.

640
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,877
Everyone, please stay where you are.

641
00:37:32,356 --> 00:37:33,961
Gibbs, you got to let me go, please.

642
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:35,116
No one leaves.

643
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:42,982
Listen up, everyone.

644
00:37:43,236 --> 00:37:44,764
It's not here.

645
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:47,516
It never was.

646
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,829
There's no cause for alarm.

647
00:37:50,254 --> 00:37:51,724
Please, everyone, stay...

648
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,155
Keep everyone inside.

649
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:13,072
Drive now!

650
00:38:23,591 --> 00:38:24,804
Hey, pal, you can't...

651
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:57,086
<i>Boss, Tony's got Amanda.
She's safe.</i>

652
00:39:57,805 --> 00:39:58,897
Thank you.

653
00:40:03,054 --> 00:40:04,348
Found Bankston's wife.

654
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:06,822
Buried in back of
an old rental property.

655
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,272
He killed her 12 months ago.

656
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,952
He planted her hair
in the cabin as insurance

657
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:14,038
in case he got caught.

658
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:17,291
Thought he was gonna walk out
of that bar with Domino in his pocket.

659
00:40:17,776 --> 00:40:19,502
This guy thought of everything.

660
00:40:20,805 --> 00:40:21,805
Not everything.

661
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:26,100
It's probably the best way
for it to end.

662
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,512
Treason, double murder.

663
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,444
She was headed for a life sentence.

664
00:40:32,504 --> 00:40:33,504
Or worse.

665
00:40:34,342 --> 00:40:36,519
She was never gonna see
her sister again.

666
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:43,150
SECNAV wants Domino back.

667
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:55,830
It never left the building, Leon.

668
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:06,134
I need everyone to think it was real.

669
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:09,008
Even me.

670
00:41:13,148 --> 00:41:15,206
So, what are you going to tell her?

671
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,369
Lee a hero or a villain?

672
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:23,334
Both.

673
00:41:28,075 --> 00:41:29,209
Red apples.

674
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,948
That's good, Amanda.

675
00:41:32,398 --> 00:41:34,743
Breakfast is served, my lady.

676
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:37,088
- A chocolate chip cookie.
- Thank you.

677
00:41:37,148 --> 00:41:38,330
And some hot cocoa.

678
00:41:39,587 --> 00:41:41,625
Your aunt will be
here soon to pick you up.

679
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:47,293
Thank you for helping me
with my drawing, Ziva.

680
00:41:51,307 --> 00:41:53,220
You are one brave little girl.

681
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:55,347
Where's Michy?

682
00:42:12,383 --> 00:42:14,199
What happened to your hand?

683
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:28,936
Michy would want you to have that.
