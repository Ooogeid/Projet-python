2
00:00:02,556 --> 00:00:04,218
We can get arrested for this.

3
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:06,901
Oh, come on.
It's one little Christmas tree.

4
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:08,577
Why pay
when we can just cut it down?

5
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:10,258
Because this is a park.

6
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,503
- It's Christmas.
- It's illegal.

7
00:00:14,027 --> 00:00:15,712
It's what
our grandparents used to do.

8
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:17,725
Hey, Lara.

9
00:00:18,062 --> 00:00:20,010
- What?
- I like this whole...

10
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:21,312
criminal sexy thing.

11
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:25,168
- Stop it!
- So what's it gonna be this Christmas?

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,292
A little naughty or nice?

13
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,881
Dean, wait! Wait!

14
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:31,822
- Wait.
- What?

15
00:00:34,103 --> 00:00:35,325
Oh, my gosh.

16
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:36,951
What's he doing?

17
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:38,495
Hey, mister.

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,474
You all right?

19
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:42,244
Must be freezing.

20
00:00:43,428 --> 00:00:44,137
Sir?

21
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:47,071
Sir?

22
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,306
Call the police.

Merry Christmas, everybody!

28
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:32,249
Loretta, thanks for the ride.

29
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,293
- Bye-bye.
- You drive careful now.

30
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,978
Hey, Dad.

31
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,825
I didn't expect you till tonight.

32
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,198
Well, I like my pilots
caffeinated and fresh.

33
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:49,567
I caught an earlier flight.

34
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,636
Yeah, but you should have called.
I would have picked you up.

35
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,970
No matter. I made it.

36
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:57,107
Yeah, you did.

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,709
Too many years
since I was here last.

38
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,233
Yeah. Whose fault is that, huh?

39
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:12,548
We gonna do this again, son?

40
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:16,870
Come on in.

41
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,578
Old place looks pretty good.

42
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:22,588
Yeah, well,
it could use a coat of paint.

43
00:02:22,986 --> 00:02:24,286
Couldn't we all?

44
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:31,827
Well, look at this.

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,737
Hope you didn't get
all decked out on my account.

46
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:39,199
Plenty of comfortable hotels nearby.

47
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:42,697
I'll be fine just as long
as I have a working clicker.

48
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:45,052
There's the clicker.

49
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,081
No cable.

50
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:48,405
Color?

51
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:51,128
I'll manage.

52
00:02:55,124 --> 00:02:56,159
That's your bed.

53
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,513
- What happened to the guest room?
- It's not a guest room anymore.

54
00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:04,641
The...
the cupboard's not totally empty.

55
00:03:05,808 --> 00:03:07,144
Maybe I'll cook us something.

56
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,105
As long as it's not your Stroganoff,
knock yourself out.

57
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,233
What's wrong with my Stroganoff?

58
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:16,403
I'm still surprised you came, Dad.

59
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:19,615
It's good to be
with family at Christmas.

60
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:24,020
You gonna be okay here alone?

61
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,246
I'll be fine, yeah.

62
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,699
You go to work.

63
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:28,748
Death doesn't take a holiday.

64
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,029
I'll be fine.

65
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,414
Leave my number right here
by the phone.

66
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:38,384
You need anything, Ericson family

67
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,010
two doors down same side of the street,
they're always home.

68
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:42,262
Leroy...

69
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,468
I'm glad to be here.

70
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,839
- It's freezing this morning.
- Man up, Chilly Willy.

71
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:59,643
Feel that warm blood
coursing through your veins.

72
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:01,740
Get in touch
with your inner McGrizzly Adams.

73
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:03,382
I got hand warmers.

74
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,433
Give me one.

75
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:06,661
- No.
- I'm not cold at all.

76
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,082
That's because you're cold-blooded,
David, like a lady Komodo dragon.

77
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,726
Ice queen, frigid and deadly.

78
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,920
And I remembered to wear
my thermal underwear.

79
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:16,969
I'll give you 50 bucks
for it right now.

80
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:19,167
- It wouldn't fit. You're too big.
- They'll stretch.

81
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:20,989
- Hand them over.
- Crime scene gloves.

82
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:22,386
Triple bag for insulation.

83
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:24,913
God, there's got to be
a better way to avoid frostbite.

84
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,355
- There is. Get to work.
- Right. On it, Boss.

85
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:32,771
Marine First Lieutenant
Thomas Ellis.

86
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:35,810
Married, decorated,
third generation Marine.

87
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:38,571
Father's a retired Marine Colonel,
George Ellis,

88
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,158
- who is now an ordained minister.
- Second career.

89
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:42,826
Second calling.

90
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,838
Well, his son experienced
the call of the wild.

91
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:49,725
Going barefoot and without gloves
in this weather

92
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,726
is ill-conceived, to say the least.

93
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,597
Was not a robbery.
Money and credit cards are still here.

94
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:57,087
Not much in the backpack
except for a towel

95
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,153
and what I think is
some soapy water.

96
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:01,846
Frozen soap residue
under his fingernails

97
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:03,469
confirms your discovery.

98
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,220
It's an odd place to take a bath.

99
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,481
Could have at least turned around,
enjoy the view.

100
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:09,600
Yeah, if he had,
it might have saved his life.

101
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:11,729
Recent footprints here

102
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,558
indicate the attacker came
from this direction.

103
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,649
Used a compass.

104
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:17,872
It's facing east.

105
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:20,110
Why would a Marine not even attempt
to fight back?

106
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:22,529
Lift him up, Duck.

107
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,407
Look under his knees.

108
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,182
Agent McGee,
if you would be so kind.

109
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:43,960
It is called a <i>sajada</i>.

110
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:45,551
An Islamic prayer rug.

111
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,424
Well, son of a preacher man was...

112
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:50,432
- Muslim.
- He was praying when he was killed.

113
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:02,486
As a Marine, Ellis officially changed
his religious status eight months ago

114
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,882
from Christian to Muslim.

115
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:07,366
- That was not just a passing interest.
- Fruit of the Month might be good.

116
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,851
Maybe a foot massager.

117
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:12,135
Gee, Tony,
never pegged you as a catalog shopper.

118
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:13,664
That's 'cause I'm not, Tiny Tim,

119
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,666
but desperate times call
for desperate measures.

120
00:06:16,353 --> 00:06:18,090
I took these
from my neighbor's doorstep.

121
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:19,294
You stole them?

122
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,956
Doorstep's considered a common area.

123
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,148
I would never steal mail.
That's a federal offense.

124
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:26,010
Hold the phone, Malone.

125
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:27,677
Little bit of lingerie.

126
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,973
Nice. What do you get
for the shrew who has everything?

127
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,807
Is this for the Secret Santa?

128
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:35,560
How did I end up with Delores Bromstead
in Human Resources?

129
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:38,801
- She's a Grinch of a woman.
- Can't argue with you there.

130
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:41,483
Once wished her a happy Valentine's Day,
she claimed sexual harassment.

131
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:43,359
- You ever seen her smile?
- No.

132
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,674
Stop it, both of you. She is a single,
middle-aged, lonely woman.

133
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,495
- Have some compassion.
- Must be tough

134
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:50,034
living up there on Mount Crumpit.

135
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,953
Scheming to take Christmas
away from poor Cindy Lou Who.

136
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,620
Why do I bother?

137
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,498
Careful,
or I'll take your present back.

138
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,292
We have a rule, remember?
No presents.

139
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,544
But if I had gotten you one,
you'd be sorry.

140
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:03,566
DiNozzo desk.

141
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,618
- Hey, boss.
- <i>You know where the Ellis live?</i>

142
00:07:05,702 --> 00:07:06,884
- <i>Find out.</i>
- No. Yes.

143
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,135
I'll meet you there.

144
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,887
- <i>Now.</i>
- Right away.

145
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:15,676
Yeah, he wants me to meet him
over at Colonel Ellis' house.

146
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:17,623
Don't touch my catalogs.

147
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:21,982
Was it a hate crime?

148
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:23,484
Don't know yet.

149
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,734
It's a possibility.

150
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,112
How long were you
and the lieutenant married, Mrs. Ellis?

151
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:29,865
Two years.

152
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:33,160
Thom had just gotten back
from his second tour, so we...

153
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:35,687
hadn't really spent
any real time together.

154
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:37,811
Nothing tests
a marriage like the Corps.

155
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,093
Nature of the beast.

156
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:43,420
I forgot you were a Marine,
Agent Gibbs.

157
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:44,922
I remember you, Colonel.

158
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:46,714
It's Reverend now.

159
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,760
- Why the change?
- When my wife died,

160
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:51,884
I wanted to be closer to God.

161
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:55,390
Now he's taken my son, as well.

162
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,965
If you don't mind my asking,
Mrs. Ellis,

163
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:00,203
when did you and Thom meet?

164
00:08:00,432 --> 00:08:01,313
In College.

165
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,032
Here in Maryland.

166
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:07,027
He swam, and I played softball.

167
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:10,457
After he joined the Corps,
things changed.

168
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:12,199
He...

169
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:14,284
He started studying the Koran,

170
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,450
and he said it would make him
a better Marine.

171
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:20,874
Within the first year, though, he was...
he was reciting prayers, and

172
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,502
he was thinking about converting.

173
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:27,317
I blame myself for this.

174
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:31,875
Did I push my beliefs on Thomas?

175
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,547
Was all this Islamic study
just to spite me?

176
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:36,932
I asked a friend of mine,

177
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,675
a Muslim Navy Chaplain,

178
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:41,395
to reach out to him.

179
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:44,168
Maybe he can make
some sense of all this.

180
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,483
Merry Christmas, everyone.

181
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:52,322
This is my younger son, Patrick.

182
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:55,909
What happened?
What's wrong?

183
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:03,333
Thomas is dead, Pat.

184
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,699
Your brother's gone.

185
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,661
Come here.

186
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:13,404
Lieutenant, when you knelt
to commune with your maker,

187
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:16,180
did you have any idea
you'd be seeing him so soon?

188
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:18,848
I think not.

189
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:22,451
Is it true that Muslims
pray five times a day?

190
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:24,161
To be called Muslim, yes.

191
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,522
It is one of the Five Pillars
of Islam.

192
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:28,358
I don't do anything
five times a day.

193
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,755
<i>Salaat</i>, as it is called,

194
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:32,669
certainly takes dedication.

195
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,658
Yeah, perhaps if humanity focused

196
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:40,301
less on what separates us
from one another,

197
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:43,040
and more on what we could learn
from our differences,

198
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:45,255
we would stop killing one another.

199
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:47,286
That is what I pray for.

200
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,525
You're not the only one, Duck.
What do you got?

201
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,121
Well, I'm waiting for the Cleric
until I begin the autopsy proper,

202
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:55,010
but cursory examination

203
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,377
indicates blunt force trauma
to the parietal lobe,

204
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,743
and multiple lacerations
to his shoulders and neck.

205
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:04,193
- It's deep.
- Yeah, and oddly angled.

206
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,148
The blow was delivered
in a downward slicing motion.

207
00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:10,651
- Delivered with what?
- Ah, good question.

208
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,694
Whatever it was, was cylindrical.

209
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:16,365
We found paint residue
and some kind of thread in the wound.

210
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:19,534
Yeah, well, we'll have to wait
until Abby is done with her analysis.

211
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:22,329
However,
there is still much to surmise.

212
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:26,792
The Lieutenant has minor scratches
on the soles of his feet.

213
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:31,171
And due to soap traces
on his lower appendages,

214
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:34,216
it appears that Lieutenant Ellis
cleansed his feet again

215
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,056
before returning to prayer.

216
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:39,680
Which means
he most likely knew his attacker.

217
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,974
Trusted 'em enough to turn
his back on them.

218
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,137
And paid for that misplaced trust
with his life.

219
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:49,876
These chocolates are delicious!

220
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,375
- Hey, Dad.
- Love chocolate.

221
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,419
- Stop making my team fat.
- I'd like another one.

222
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:55,362
Why didn't you tell us
your father was coming?

223
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:57,823
I didn't think he'd actually show.

224
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,951
Go ahead.
Have another one, Bubble Butt.

225
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:03,328
My metabolism is slowing with age.

226
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,569
It's nothing
a post-holiday cleanse won't cure.

227
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:08,123
Come on,
it's just candy for the holidays.

228
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,721
Homemade.

229
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,684
Best in Stillwater.

230
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:14,224
Ms. Hannigan, huh?

231
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,550
She's been after you
ever since mom died.

232
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,203
She means well.

233
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:20,304
Been cooking for me lately.

234
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,854
She does put together
a hell of a care package...

235
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,686
when people are hurting.

236
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,358
Our instincts were right, Boss.

237
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,954
The widow did have a fling
while the Lieutenant was overseas

238
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:38,577
with a banker named James Hanlin,
from Chevy Chase, Maryland.

239
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:40,725
- Any recent contact?
- Not that I can tell.

240
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,699
Called it off
when the husband found out.

241
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,782
<i>- Assalamu alikum.
- Wa alikum assalam.</i>

242
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,792
I'm Chaplain El-Sayed.
I'm looking for Special Agent Gibbs.

243
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:53,920
Thank you.

244
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:56,347
Most people don't know
that the Marine code

245
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:59,163
is not unlike the code of Islam,
as written in the Holy Koran.

246
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:01,154
Honor, courage, commitment.

247
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,231
Same three philosophies
that Islam teaches.

248
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:06,224
Yet, ignorance and bigotry remain
a problem in the military.

249
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:10,062
Well, ignorance isn't unique
to any one group, Agent David.

250
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:14,194
All we can do is try our best to educate
and pray for acceptance as a whole.

251
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:16,344
Lieutenant Ellis...
he find acceptance?

252
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:21,573
Like many of the Islamic Marines
I counsel, Thomas tried, but

253
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:24,477
opposition can be overwhelming.

254
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:26,912
Yet, he stuck with it,
determined to become a Muslim.

255
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,998
Because, I think, he found something
that was missing in his life.

256
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:34,336
Thomas referred to his awakening
as a devout Epiphany.

257
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,922
That's when he became Tareef Bashir.

258
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,924
Yes.

259
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:41,331
And how did the rest of his unit
react to his conversion?

260
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:44,612
Well, some were open to it.
Others not so much.

261
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:48,433
They found his need to pray multiple
times a day inopportune and dangerous.

262
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:51,561
Was any one Marine more vocal
about it than any other?

263
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:56,379
Thomas did ask me to personally speak
to a First Sergeant Louis Tibbens.

264
00:12:56,932 --> 00:12:57,871
Successful?

265
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,516
Well, let's just say
that some battles can never be won.

266
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:05,909
Spoke to Ellis' C.O.
He was on vacation with his family, but

267
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:09,215
he did confirm that Tibbens
and Ellis did not get along.

268
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,957
Louis Tibbens, home on leave.

269
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,418
Athens, West Virginia.
Population: 900.

270
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,960
Bigger than Stillwater.

271
00:13:16,469 --> 00:13:17,754
But does it have the charm?

272
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:19,677
Or the perpetual smell of coal.

273
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:21,206
I always liked that smell.

274
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:29,599
Keep going.

275
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:30,741
Yes...

276
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,978
no criminal priors, Boss,

277
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:37,149
but Tibbens does have two NJPs for being
disrespectful to a superior officer.

278
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,902
Tony, you and Ziva find Tibbens.
McGee,

279
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:43,357
look into Ellis' Muslim life.

280
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:45,198
As Tareef Bashir?

281
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,451
Let's see if two names means
he's leading two lives.

282
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,253
How the hell can you sit
like this all day?

283
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,178
No, I'm serious.

284
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:54,896
You'd think, after all these years,
they'd give you a couple of walls,

285
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:56,509
- some privacy.
- Come on.

286
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:58,455
- Got a job for you.
- Where are we going?

287
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,032
It's a surprise.

288
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,590
Here.

289
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:03,729
You're building toys.

290
00:14:06,294 --> 00:14:07,476
We're building toys.

291
00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:11,578
So, when did you get
into the spirit?

292
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:14,787
I don't know.

293
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:17,829
For me, it's more about the wood,

294
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:20,650
though having that deadline
of the 24th has been good.

295
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,113
You don't believe in Santa,
but you believe in hobbies.

296
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,408
As long as you believe in something,
I guess.

297
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,996
It settles my mind, Dad.
Keeps my hands busy.

298
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:38,575
So, you want me to finish all this,
paint it and put it together, huh?

299
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,619
If you want.
It's up to you.

300
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:43,673
If it settles my mind.

301
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:47,135
You want to let those kids down at
the children's hospital, go right ahead.

302
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,597
You're trying to Tom Sawyer me
into whitewashing a fence for you.

303
00:14:51,997 --> 00:14:53,479
No, not for me.

304
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,142
With me.

305
00:14:59,592 --> 00:15:00,950
If you feel up to it.

306
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:03,817
Go to work.

307
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:08,782
There's a steak in the fridge.
We'll talk when I get back.

308
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:13,082
Hey, Dad.

309
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:17,538
I mean that.

310
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:35,100
If Santa's looking for Rudolph,
I think I know what happened.

311
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,512
Tibbens' sister described
this place perfectly.

312
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:41,188
So, this is where
a "red throat" would hang out

313
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,233
after being overseas for months.

314
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:45,402
It's not red throat, it's redneck.

315
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,363
And I think we found
the entire cast of <i>Hee Haw</i>.

316
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,949
Over there.
That's him.

317
00:15:51,746 --> 00:15:54,160
With his brother, Darryl,
and his other brother, Darryl?

318
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,166
First Sergeant Tibbens.

319
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:04,712
Call me Tibbs.

320
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,715
They call you Mr. Tibbs?

321
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:08,592
- Who the hell are you?
- NCIS.

322
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,762
I'm Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
This is my probationary sidekick,

323
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:14,764
Agent Ziva David.

324
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,976
- What's the problem?
- Thomas Ellis. He's dead.

325
00:16:18,254 --> 00:16:19,644
Allah didn't save his ass, huh?

326
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:22,982
Guess he should have gone back
to Iraq where he belonged.

327
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:25,846
Where were you at dawn this morning?

328
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,910
- Why, do I need an alibi?
- Couldn't hurt.

329
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:29,988
I was in a hunting blind.

330
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,044
With these two.

331
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:34,101
Can you prove it?

332
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:37,388
Got a six-point buck
in the bed of my pickup.

333
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,574
How is that for proof?

334
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:43,960
But I bet a pretty little thing like
you never killed nothing before, huh?

335
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:47,810
- I'll never tell.
- Oh, boy.

336
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:50,175
You're going to have to come down
to NCIS with us. Come on.

337
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,062
I got a better idea.

338
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,419
How about this one comes
back to my place and...

339
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:57,682
decorates my tree.

340
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,394
Happy <i>Hanukkah</i>.
Now, let's go.

341
00:17:05,643 --> 00:17:07,123
Easy, easy. Heel.

342
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:18,578
Sit down.

343
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,206
My turn.

344
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,922
Red throats.

345
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:31,091
Rednecks.

346
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:32,300
Whatever.

347
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:47,846
What people believe in
is their own business,

348
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:51,480
but the brass knows having
a devout Muslim

349
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:53,697
riding patrols
could blow up in our faces.

350
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:57,219
Really? Why?

351
00:17:57,965 --> 00:18:01,961
Hajis think when a white Marine starts
reciting the <i>Fatiha</i>, he's mocking them,

352
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,873
and they hate him for it.

353
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:06,106
And they hate us even more,

354
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:07,877
so we get concerned.

355
00:18:08,323 --> 00:18:10,714
You get concerned...
enough to kill?

356
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:12,132
Wasn't me.

357
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:15,111
<i>So, if it wasn't you,
who was it, then?</i>

358
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,387
He knows something.

359
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:19,160
Could be anyone.

360
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:20,724
Who?

361
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:23,810
Look, somebody out there felt
strong enough to offer us money...

362
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:25,523
good money...

363
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,647
to get Ellis to quit
the Corps for good.

364
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:31,408
So, someone paid
you guys to be bigots?

365
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:34,032
It was for the safety of the unit.

366
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:36,558
So, somebody offered you money.

367
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:38,173
Who?

368
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:42,572
Don't know.

369
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,165
Traveled word of mouth.

370
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:47,897
We answered to a PO box,
got wired the money.

371
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:50,086
No questions asked.

372
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:54,790
Oh, my God.
Remember freshman year...

373
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,271
Ms. Santa?

374
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:03,475
McGee, you're here.

375
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:07,004
Hey, got any, uh, specifics on
the metal we pulled from Ellis' wound?

376
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:09,883
Mass Spec's working on it as we speak.
But there's someone you have to meet.

377
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,170
This is one of my very bestest friends
in the whole world.

378
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:14,828
We went to College together, and she's
the lab tech over at the VA now.

379
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:16,849
Carol Wilson, Special Agent McGee.

380
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:19,324
- How goes it, McGee?
- Goes great.

381
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,265
Much better than this guy.

382
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,197
Santa... I don't know why he did
the lap band. I told him not to.

383
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,868
Well, you know, Santa...
can't have a lap band, you know.

384
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:31,023
He's got to be...

385
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,421
Doesn't work.
What are you drinking?

386
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,132
Caf-nog.
It's an old family recipe.

387
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:38,413
Speaking of families...

388
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,797
tell him.

389
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:45,950
This is my nephew, Fisher.

390
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,477
How cute is he?

391
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:52,190
His mother, my sister, is stationed on
a naval destroyer in the Indian Ocean.

392
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:54,818
Fisher has been staying
with Carol until she gets back.

393
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:56,528
I took Fisher to the mall today.

394
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:59,906
Watched as kid after kid sat
on some lame-ass Santa's lap

395
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,950
and asked for toys, video games.

396
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,534
But not Fisher.

397
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:07,747
All Fisher asked for was
to see his mom on Christmas Eve.

398
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,570
On a destroyer?

399
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,294
So...
we thought you could help.

400
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,216
Look, I sympathize, okay,

401
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:21,295
but satellite feeds
to the Indian Ocean are restricted

402
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:23,513
to all but the highest
priority communications.

403
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:26,432
What's a higher priority

404
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,768
than a little boy that wants
to see his mom on Christmas?

405
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:32,076
He's like...

406
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:33,857
a miracle worker.

407
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:35,733
If anyone can do this,

408
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,027
he can.
Right, McGee?

409
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,553
Boss, I've been running bank records
on each Marine in Ellis' unit.

410
00:20:45,637 --> 00:20:48,985
So far, only two Marines, including
First Sergeant Tibbens,

411
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:50,668
accepted a bribe four grand apiece.

412
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:52,000
Merry Christmas.

413
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,440
All the money was drawn
from the same overseas account

414
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:56,045
and deposited around the same time.

415
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,423
- It's a dummy corp.
- Interpol is checking into it.

416
00:20:58,553 --> 00:20:59,799
Tell them to check faster.

417
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:01,258
You do it.

418
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,179
Not you, Boss. You.

419
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,181
How many languages
do you speak, anyway?

420
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,183
Including the language of love, ten.

421
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,402
- Yeah. Gibbs.
<i>- Leroy, you have to come home.</i>

422
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:14,243
- Dad, I can't.
- <i>I need you here.</i>

423
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:16,489
-<i> I almost burned your house down.</i>
- You did what?!

424
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:24,024
Sir, everything's okay.

425
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:25,886
- Hey, guys. Thanks.
- No problem.

426
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:29,162
Dad... you okay?

427
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,009
When was the last time you...
you cleaned that flue?

428
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:33,875
The damn fireplace was all clogged.

429
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:42,492
- What is all this?
- Boxes.

430
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,658
- Decorations?
- They're your mom's stuff.

431
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:50,600
No use leaving 'em at home, I...

432
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,393
had 'em shipped...

433
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:53,686
for the tree.

434
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:56,325
It's a beauty, isn't it?

435
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:58,912
Yeah, yeah, it's good,

436
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,236
- it's fine.
- Will you please stop patronizing me?

437
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,447
If you don't like what I'm doing,
speak up.

438
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,326
I am trying to make this work.

439
00:22:08,752 --> 00:22:09,852
And I'm not?

440
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,232
Will you please put
that box in another room?

441
00:22:20,316 --> 00:22:22,298
I don't like being
around what's in it.

442
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,926
- It's secure.
- It's dangerous.

443
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,430
Why won't you do what I ask?

444
00:22:29,754 --> 00:22:33,171
How come everything with you
ends up in an argument?

445
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,144
For just once,

446
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:38,214
will you listen
to what I'm asking you?!

447
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,983
All right,

448
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:42,026
all right, I'll move it.

449
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,407
I'm going for a walk.

450
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,118
You want some company?

451
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,535
I'm all right. I'm fine.

452
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:58,776
Spoke to Interpol, Boss.

453
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,466
Got the account that was paying
those guys to pressure Ellis.

454
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,215
-<i> You got a name?</i>
- Colonel George Ellis.

455
00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:06,460
His father?

456
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,226
How dare you guys come in here
and accuse a decorated Marine...

457
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,895
a reverend, no less...

458
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:20,398
- of hurting his own son.
- It's a fact.

459
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:22,738
- It's a lie.
- Not according to the bank.

460
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:24,610
People do things
for such misguided reasons.

461
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,530
Well, Marines aren't
just people, Sir.

462
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:30,575
You're right, Pat, they're not,
but they abide by the same laws.

463
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:31,804
Your father didn't.

464
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:35,538
We need to get in touch with Mr. Hanlin.
You have his number, right?

465
00:23:35,787 --> 00:23:39,125
I understand. You need a shoulder
to cry on and he was happy to talk,

466
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,376
among other things.

467
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:43,046
- Where were you when Thom was killed?
- With friends

468
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,374
and Patrick was at school.
Why are you doing this?

469
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,383
Because you're not being
straight with us.

470
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:49,218
It's okay, Tina.

471
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,929
They have a right
to know everything.

472
00:23:58,065 --> 00:23:59,479
You're correct, Agent DiNozzo,

473
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,272
but I didn't want him discharged.

474
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,192
I just wanted
this Muslim nonsense to end.

475
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:07,145
You paid off the men
he trusted with his life.

476
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:10,130
Because I thought if Thom knew
he was putting them in danger,

477
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:12,700
he would stop being selfish.

478
00:24:16,283 --> 00:24:17,830
What I did was wrong

479
00:24:18,703 --> 00:24:20,039
but well-intentioned.

480
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:24,466
And if it led to my son's death,
then God forgive me,

481
00:24:25,562 --> 00:24:26,910
and Thom's God, too.

482
00:24:27,897 --> 00:24:29,467
One and the same, Colonel.

483
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,013
Do you really think the Colonel
was involved in his son's death?

484
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:36,793
Well, he has a congregation.

485
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:39,227
Humiliation can do
irrational things to people.

486
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,190
- <i>This is Delores Bromstead.</i>
- It's her.

487
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:46,942
Hi, Delores.

488
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,625
- <i>Is something wrong?</i>
- I just... I have a cold.

489
00:24:50,993 --> 00:24:51,847
Delores.

490
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,966
Human resources, the Grinch.

491
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,118
Watch, watch, watch.
This is going to be really good.

492
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,587
- You crack me up.
- <i>Not funny. My office...</i>

493
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:00,915
No, it's not... That's not funny.
Of course I'll be there.

494
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,455
With bells on.
Big silver bells.

495
00:25:07,164 --> 00:25:08,339
Someone broke my cover.

496
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,316
She knows I'm her Secret Santa.

497
00:25:13,243 --> 00:25:15,263
McGee, you wouldn't do that.

498
00:25:18,915 --> 00:25:21,602
She wants me to meet her
at 6:00 on Christmas Eve.

499
00:25:21,883 --> 00:25:24,892
- To exchange gifts?
- To wrap me in a coon of ivy

500
00:25:25,193 --> 00:25:26,953
and suck the Christmas joy
out of me.

501
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,662
I'm going to say this again.

502
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:32,465
She is probably someone who just
lacks social skills, so be nice,

503
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,241
get her something special,
kill her with kindness.

504
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,242
Or with a stake of holly
through the heart.

505
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,578
What should I get her?

506
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,624
<i>Ziva, meet me in Abby's lab.</i>

507
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:42,708
All right.

508
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,502
Any of these things could kill,
but none of them did.

509
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,296
Any luck ID'ing the murder weapon?

510
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,062
This job is not about luck.
It's about the keen eye of science.

511
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,773
Would I have called you down here
if I didn't have something?

512
00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:56,973
Hold that thought.

513
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,110
Go ahead,

514
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:08,733
taste one.

515
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:11,152
I'm sorry, Abby,
I could never eat you.

516
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,146
I'll take one to go...

517
00:26:15,253 --> 00:26:16,312
for my dad.

518
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,535
Abs, I hope you have something
more than a gingerbread cookie.

519
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,788
Yeah, I have aluminum and titanium.

520
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:25,867
I found minute particles
in Lieutenant Ellis' head wound.

521
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,127
- How about a baseball bat?
- That's a very good guess.

522
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,132
So I used the angle of impact,
the depth of the wound,

523
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,260
and the density of bone to work
my way backwards to simulate the kill.

524
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:39,847
- What's that?
- <i>On Dasher...</i>

525
00:26:40,145 --> 00:26:42,099
You weren't supposed...
to see that.

526
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:45,818
Okay, here, so,
check out the death blow.

527
00:26:45,902 --> 00:26:49,732
It's the speed at which it impacts
Ellis' skull that's what's impressive.

528
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,716
Watch this.

529
00:26:51,454 --> 00:26:54,174
Whoever killed Lieutenant Ellis
was definitely athletic

530
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:56,155
and knew how to generate
some serious momentum.

531
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:04,103
Mrs. Ellis,
your father-in-law said you were here.

532
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:06,215
I wanted to see where it happened.

533
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:09,377
I am Agent David from NCIS.
I hope you don't mind. Can we talk?

534
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:12,288
What could you possibly ask me
that your friends don't already know?

535
00:27:12,372 --> 00:27:14,423
Look, I know we have brought up
some personal issues.

536
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:17,301
The affair you had
while your husband was overseas...

537
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,004
did he know about it?

538
00:27:20,297 --> 00:27:21,432
Eventually.

539
00:27:21,657 --> 00:27:23,463
He knew that James
and I were good friends.

540
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,226
You are in excellent shape, yes?

541
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:28,062
Agent David,
what is the purpose of this?

542
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:30,481
Do you still play softball?

543
00:27:30,825 --> 00:27:32,233
- I'm sorry?
- Your husband...

544
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,588
he was killed by a blow to the head,
possibly by a bat.

545
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:36,570
The angle of the blow was unique.

546
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:38,816
And you think that I did it?

547
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,492
Well, you returned
to the crime scene.

548
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,343
Look...

549
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:44,870
I have a funeral to plan,

550
00:27:45,617 --> 00:27:47,915
a military funeral for a hero

551
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,893
and a husband
that I loved very deeply.

552
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:54,429
If you'll excuse me.

553
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,553
And by... by the time I got there,

554
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,763
Leroy had fallen asleep,

555
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:05,057
he left the gate unlocked.

556
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,608
I don't remember what happened next.

557
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:21,731
Well, I spent the next 25 hours
trying to round up 26 missing sheep.

558
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:25,536
- That's right.
- Hello, Jethro.

559
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:29,402
Your father has been regaling me
with stories of his youth.

560
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,004
We have a lot in common.

561
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:32,554
Naive heartbreak,

562
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,295
tales of adolescent...

563
00:28:34,642 --> 00:28:35,976
chivalry.

564
00:28:38,304 --> 00:28:42,276
And fond memories
of skinny-dipping as children.

565
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,558
Come on, getting late.

566
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,602
Time to go.

567
00:28:50,118 --> 00:28:53,689
Yes, there is Christmas shopping
to be done and a roose to be goasted.

568
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:57,026
A goose to be roasted.

569
00:28:57,818 --> 00:28:59,518
A pleasure to finally meet you.

570
00:28:59,602 --> 00:29:00,913
Pleasure is all mine.

571
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,135
Where's my coat?

572
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:13,188
What a sweet, lovely man, Jethro,

573
00:29:13,272 --> 00:29:15,701
and certainly much warmer
than you depicted him,

574
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:18,842
and in many ways
more accessible than you are.

575
00:29:20,888 --> 00:29:22,176
Please.
My dad?

576
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:25,188
You understand I cannot make
a firm diagnosis

577
00:29:25,272 --> 00:29:27,498
on the basis
of such a short meeting,

578
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:32,051
but there is most
definitely something wrong.

579
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,147
Well, how bad?

580
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:37,066
That's an interesting question.

581
00:29:37,648 --> 00:29:41,217
I doubt what you experienced
was any kind of dementia.

582
00:29:42,034 --> 00:29:44,824
I mean, despite his disorientation,
your father shows

583
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,544
no signs of impaired recognition,

584
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:50,287
has no trouble solving problems.

585
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,771
He certainly doesn't have
any symptoms of motor aphasia.

586
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:55,334
What the hell is wrong with him?

587
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,338
Something far more old-fashioned,
I believe.

588
00:30:00,818 --> 00:30:02,018
Your father...

589
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:06,504
is under
significant emotional distress,

590
00:30:06,964 --> 00:30:10,219
the kind one sees
when one loses a loved one or...

591
00:30:10,303 --> 00:30:13,538
I mean, has he experienced
any kind of trauma recently?

592
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,622
Well, it's nothing personal, Jethro,

593
00:30:15,706 --> 00:30:19,205
but I don't think he came here
for your uplifting holiday cheer.

594
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:21,122
Martha Stewart, you are not.

595
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:23,829
Why'd he come?

596
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,866
Well, the answer to that question
is not in my purview.

597
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:30,661
You are, when all is said and done,
the investigator.

598
00:30:30,935 --> 00:30:33,280
I prescribe some phone calls

599
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,749
back home, on your father's behalf.

600
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:39,385
They just might prove enlightening.

601
00:30:44,185 --> 00:30:47,315
Okay, so you're telling me that
Ensign Blake cannot be reached on board?

602
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,279
You know what?
This is an emergency.

603
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:52,666
I have direct orders from Admiral...

604
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:54,678
Nicholas Whitebeard.

605
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,021
Yes, yes, that is his name.

606
00:30:57,148 --> 00:31:00,274
He's the Admiral that oversees
the northern polar regions.

607
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:01,801
Great.

608
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:04,797
Get back to me as soon as possible,
please. Thank you.

609
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:08,010
Misplaced tidings of joy, McScrooge?

610
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:11,952
I'm donating my time to a very,
very worthy charity this year.

611
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:13,204
How worthy?

612
00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:15,956
- Very.
- Who are you doing this favor for?

613
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:19,143
Abby, her friend, and the big man.

614
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,462
- Gibbs?
- Nope.

615
00:31:21,627 --> 00:31:24,048
- Director Vance?
- Bigger... and rounder.

616
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,493
DiNozzo.

617
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:28,881
Yes, Sir.

618
00:31:32,178 --> 00:31:33,390
Got it, yeah.

619
00:31:34,854 --> 00:31:37,570
That was Director Vance,
he just spoke with SECNAV.

620
00:31:37,835 --> 00:31:40,029
Colonel Ellis was visiting
his Chesapeake Bay home

621
00:31:40,113 --> 00:31:41,774
at the time
the lieutenant was killed.

622
00:31:42,342 --> 00:31:43,525
SECNAV's house?

623
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,915
- And the daughter-in-law?
- She drove him.

624
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:49,395
Thom stayed home.

625
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,367
Well, that is an airtight alibi.

626
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:52,945
So we have nothing.

627
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,955
In a manner of speaking. All I want
for Christmas is a clue trail.

628
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,123
I must see Special Agent Gibbs.

629
00:31:58,874 --> 00:32:01,168
- Chaplain El-Sayed.
- We have a problem.

630
00:32:01,845 --> 00:32:03,462
I just got this in the mail.

631
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:22,284
The letter came
through the military postal service.

632
00:32:22,663 --> 00:32:24,608
So it could've been dropped
in a box on any base.

633
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,610
By someone who has
easy access to you.

634
00:32:26,932 --> 00:32:28,362
So you think the threat is real?

635
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:31,198
Or a distraction,
if we're getting too close.

636
00:32:31,478 --> 00:32:33,157
NCIS will provide protection.

637
00:32:34,414 --> 00:32:37,037
- That won't be necessary.
- You have a wife and a daughter.

638
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:39,915
Whom I love very much,
but I am also a Navy Chaplain.

639
00:32:40,271 --> 00:32:41,625
A man of honor and pride.

640
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,168
Bullheaded stubbornness.

641
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,713
Look, as much as I am here to pray
for the injured and the dying,

642
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:49,008
I am also here
to open the minds of people.

643
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:52,261
To help them to understand
the beauty and strength of Islam.

644
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:54,470
- You talk to teenagers, Chaplain?
- Yes.

645
00:32:54,615 --> 00:32:57,516
Before society dictates for them
what is and isn't moral.

646
00:32:57,864 --> 00:32:59,660
You see, in the Muslim religion,

647
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:03,108
the most immoral thing
a person can do is to not accept someone

648
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,306
who lives by the Pillars
of Islamic Belief.

649
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,986
A while back, Thomas asked me to speak
to his brother's prep school class.

650
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:11,284
So you spoke with Patrick Ellis?

651
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:12,533
I did.

652
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:15,183
And let me just say, it is amazing

653
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:17,829
how two siblings can be
so very different.

654
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,490
How fun would it be to have
a totally impromptu Christmas party,

655
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:25,856
like, right now?

656
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,648
We could decorate my test-tube tree,

657
00:33:27,866 --> 00:33:30,090
we could warm up
dumplings in the incubator.

658
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:32,925
I know. Typing.

659
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:36,130
I feel like Scrooge being visited
by three grumpy ghosts.

660
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:38,919
- You want to see the attack again?
- The point of impact.

661
00:33:40,796 --> 00:33:42,332
Like I said, whoever did this

662
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,830
had agility, speed
and power on their side.

663
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:48,819
Well, if I don't mind saying so,
I have many of those qualities myself.

664
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:52,863
Where's that generous holiday spirit,
probette?

665
00:33:53,326 --> 00:33:55,491
- Bah Hum-Bog.
- Bah what?

666
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:59,203
- Here's another angle, Gibbs.
- Freeze it right there.

667
00:34:00,003 --> 00:34:01,580
Patrick Ellis played lacrosse?

668
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:02,981
Yeah, Team Captain.

669
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:04,500
Abby, try lacrosse.

670
00:34:05,482 --> 00:34:06,393
Checking.

671
00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:13,049
Today's lacrosse sticks are
a composite of aluminum and titanium,

672
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,385
and the head is made out
of nylon and leather mesh.

673
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:18,389
The exact same breakdown
found in the wound.

674
00:34:21,163 --> 00:34:22,225
Abel and Cain.

675
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:24,372
He killed his own brother.

676
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:31,697
What's going on?

677
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:36,844
We know that you were at the park
the other morning with Thomas.

678
00:34:37,734 --> 00:34:39,910
I was at school.
What are you talking about?

679
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:43,497
You went there to confront him
about being Muslim.

680
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,410
You argued, you lost your temper.

681
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,836
Most lacrosse players like to run
with their sticks. Where's yours?

682
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:53,215
Dad, I just went on a run.

683
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,926
Is it broken,
or did you destroy the evidence?

684
00:34:56,642 --> 00:34:58,334
I like the letter to the Chaplain.

685
00:34:58,418 --> 00:35:00,431
The cut-and-paste letters...
very Zodiac.

686
00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:02,932
Dad, you got to believe me.

687
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:05,936
Thom was embarrassing us.

688
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,273
People were laughing at him.
I did this for you.

689
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:15,598
Thomas just wanted
to find the good in people.

690
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:21,326
He found his God, that humiliated me,
but he was still my son.

691
00:35:21,563 --> 00:35:23,308
But I'm your son, too.

692
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,851
You taught us to be proud, you know.

693
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:28,813
Proud of this family.

694
00:35:29,489 --> 00:35:32,526
And when Thom changed,
everything changed,

695
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,157
because the one thing
this family always had

696
00:35:36,503 --> 00:35:37,547
was honor,

697
00:35:38,195 --> 00:35:39,973
and he ruined that.

698
00:35:42,055 --> 00:35:45,235
I loved him so much,
and he turned his back on us.

699
00:35:48,651 --> 00:35:50,943
I don't know.
Maybe we turned our back on him.

700
00:36:15,544 --> 00:36:16,946
Not very traditional.

701
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:20,005
Yeah, it is.

702
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:25,992
Let's talk.

703
00:36:32,466 --> 00:36:35,538
- You called Betty Hannigan?
- She told me to call the sheriff.

704
00:36:37,035 --> 00:36:38,236
Ed sent you the report?

705
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:48,740
How about you fill in
some of the details?

706
00:36:59,269 --> 00:37:01,315
He rumbled up in an old fastback.

707
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,830
Whole town could hear him.

708
00:37:04,437 --> 00:37:06,793
- Dirt-kicker looking for trouble.
- I guess.

709
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,147
The Dobson girl was in the store.

710
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:12,853
She had a friend visiting.
I never got her name.

711
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,775
He said he come there to rob me.

712
00:37:17,674 --> 00:37:18,956
He had a gun, Leroy.

713
00:37:20,954 --> 00:37:23,615
I told him to take anything
he wanted from the register,

714
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:25,254
but...

715
00:37:26,483 --> 00:37:27,932
the girls were in the corner,

716
00:37:28,424 --> 00:37:30,419
crouching, terrified.

717
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,813
He turned after them and...

718
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:40,412
Well, that's not the first time
you've fired that Winchester.

719
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:44,584
It's not the first time
I killed somebody, either.

720
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,098
But it's the first time
I saw the face.

721
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:52,691
Twenty-three.

722
00:37:55,297 --> 00:37:57,509
Had a kid, somebody told me.

723
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:04,369
Looks different from up there
in the cockpit, huh?

724
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:09,175
From up there,
it doesn't look like much of anything.

725
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:11,701
You pull the trigger,

726
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,970
feel the release, nothing.

727
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,995
I never even thought about it much.

728
00:38:21,555 --> 00:38:23,267
Now, that's all I think about.

729
00:38:28,855 --> 00:38:31,081
How did you do it
all these years, son?

730
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:33,764
I need to know.

731
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,414
This why you came?

732
00:38:38,302 --> 00:38:40,285
That and because it's Christmas.

733
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,785
It's not supposed to be easy.

734
00:38:50,757 --> 00:38:52,462
Nobody said it would be, huh?

735
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:16,520
Attention on deck!

736
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:30,659
- I can't. I can't.
- Of course you can. Go back. Go back.

737
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,856
I don't want to. I don't want to.
Come on, Tony. Go back.

738
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,288
I can't.

739
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:37,272
Special Agent DiNozzo?

740
00:39:44,275 --> 00:39:45,716
Merry Christmas, Delores.

741
00:39:50,642 --> 00:39:51,740
I got this for you.

742
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:54,182
I looked in your personnel file.

743
00:39:55,716 --> 00:39:58,418
Which is legal, 'cause I have
that security clearance, but I saw that

744
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,976
that when you were...
eight years old,

745
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:03,430
all the little girls
in your neighborhood,

746
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:05,569
they all got this incredible...

747
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:09,114
doll, the Knee-High Cherry Pie doll.

748
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:11,569
And you didn't get one.

749
00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:15,304
I guess Santa didn't make
enough that year, so...

750
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:19,748
I got this for you.

751
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:51,611
All right, Fisher.
Right this way, my friend.

752
00:40:52,524 --> 00:40:54,026
What is this place?

753
00:40:56,014 --> 00:40:59,829
This is a very special room
that only a few people know about.

754
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:02,639
It's a magic room called MTAC.

755
00:41:03,365 --> 00:41:05,201
- Aunt...?
- Don't look at me.

756
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:11,860
See, Santa told me
very specifically to bring you here.

757
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:14,375
Why? What's gonna happen?

758
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:15,607
Well...

759
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:19,226
Let's make a Christmas wish
and see if it comes true.

760
00:41:20,768 --> 00:41:21,810
How about that?

761
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:25,241
Want you to shut
your eyes good and tight.

762
00:41:25,927 --> 00:41:26,975
Got 'em closed?

763
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:28,671
All right.

764
00:41:28,984 --> 00:41:29,750
Now.

765
00:41:31,832 --> 00:41:34,708
I want you to think of the one thing
you want for Christmas

766
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,202
more than anything else
in the entire world.

767
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:38,403
You ready?

768
00:41:42,387 --> 00:41:44,543
<i>Fisher, baby, is that you?</i>

769
00:41:45,011 --> 00:41:46,002
Mom!

770
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:48,547
<i>I love you, sweetheart.
Merry Christmas.</i>

771
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,750
<i>Look at you.
You are getting so big.</i>

772
00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:54,719
<i>I got all the mail you sent,
all your artwork.</i>

773
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:57,305
- <i>Your pictures.</i>
- I'll make you more.

774
00:41:58,084 --> 00:41:59,093
<i>I can't wait.</i>

775
00:41:59,177 --> 00:42:01,647
<i>I have told everybody here
all about you</i>

776
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:03,478
<i>about how proud I am of you.</i>

777
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:05,897
<i>We're going to have
a big Christmas dinner here tonight.</i>

778
00:42:07,406 --> 00:42:09,333
<i>But I'd rather be there instead.</i>

779
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,488
I wish you were, too.

780
00:42:12,137 --> 00:42:13,491
Well, not bad, huh?

781
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:14,905
Pulled it off.

782
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:21,274
You would make a great Santa.

783
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,174
I guess you just got to believe.

784
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,632
I do believe.

785
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,033
I'll go warm up the sleigh.

786
