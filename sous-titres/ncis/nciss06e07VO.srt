2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:06,016
So I tell this guy
there are 3 rules for married men.

3
00:00:06,076 --> 00:00:06,797
Just 3?

4
00:00:06,857 --> 00:00:09,444
Yeah. One: pretend to listen,
even when you're not.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,951
Two: pretend to care,
even when you don't.

6
00:00:12,086 --> 00:00:15,269
And three: pretend to be generous with
the things that you don't care about.

7
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:18,857
I tell this guy,
"Do you want to have a happy marriage?"

8
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:21,083
"You stick to those rules,
no matter what."

9
00:00:21,448 --> 00:00:23,016
How is your ex-wife, Eddie?

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,016
She's pretending to hate my guts.

11
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:28,123
Tommy, hold on.
Tommy, careful! Not so fast.

12
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:31,039
I'm so sorry. I...

13
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:33,898
- I said, be careful.
- Sorry, mister.

14
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:35,841
It's okay, kid.

15
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:38,520
- I'm sorry.
- Ma'am.

16
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,937
Tommy, I told you to slow down.
I need you to be more careful.

17
00:00:41,997 --> 00:00:43,002
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:57,316
"Beautiful dreamer,"

19
00:00:57,665 --> 00:00:59,825
"wake on to me."

20
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,240
"Beautiful dreamer..."

21
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:20,283
I said, stay down!

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,478
Don't move!

23
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:30,216

Thanks to Bruno and Magic Turtle!

www.Team-NCIS.com

27
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:00,514
I'm very impressed. Gymnastics?

28
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:03,027
- Yeah. For years.
- Where?

29
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:05,598
In Japan, Germany,
all across the country.

30
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:06,692
Really?

31
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:09,964
I've traveled extensively, too...

32
00:02:10,107 --> 00:02:11,930
Tony's still hitting on
the new recruits?

33
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,983
Ignorant, hopeful and eager to please.

34
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:16,519
Yeah. What recruit isn't?

35
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,252
- I was not talking about the recruit.
- Sounds great.

36
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:22,137
Gymnastics.

37
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:24,603
What?

38
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,813
You know, there are rules
about harassment, Tony.

39
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,048
Well, then, maybe I should

40
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:32,309
keep the number that she just gave me
in case I want to file a claim?

41
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:35,260
You are fortunate recruits
are not allowed to carry guns, Tony.

42
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:37,360
I don't know if you've noticed,
Ziva, but she

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,408
and they don't exactly want
to shoot me.

44
00:02:39,553 --> 00:02:40,557
Give 'em time.

45
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:44,331
Look, one more week, they're out of our
hair and off to FLETC for three months.

46
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:47,530
Why don't you let them focus
on learning how to be an NCIS agent?

47
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:50,859
Well, you see, since "Team Gibbs"
was not assigned a recruit,

48
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:54,282
I am just doing my best
to teach and inspire where I can,

49
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:56,031
when I can, McKilljoy.

50
00:02:56,153 --> 00:02:58,113
It is curious
we were not assigned any recruit.

51
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:00,630
It's the one-probie rule,
and we've got ours.

52
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:03,309
Well, I, for one,
feel that we dodged a bullet.

53
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,781
We don't want to let some
newbie get in our way, you know?

54
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,812
I heard rumors that
Gibbs refuses to take one.

55
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:10,171
Wrong. They won't give him one.
Think about it.

56
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,029
You take a date back
to your family's house,

57
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:14,396
you want to make a good impression,
you want them to like you.

58
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:16,484
You don't introduce them
to your weird Uncle Jethro

59
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:17,912
until, like, the fifth date.

60
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:20,002
Since when you an expert
on fifth dates, DiNozzo?

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,494
You're very right about that.

62
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:23,919
- Bank guard shot dead in Quantico.
- Quantico?

63
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:26,117
Yeah, you heard right, McGee.
Let's go.

64
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:38,987
There you go.

65
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:41,736
- Appreciate it, Tommy.
- Thank you, Agent Gibbs.

66
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:49,348
Ray Vittorio, bank guard.

67
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:54,080
- Weapon is still holstered.
- Never gave him a chance.

68
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:55,234
To shoot?

69
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:56,820
Surrender.

70
00:03:57,493 --> 00:03:59,152
It's no mystery what killed him.

71
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:03,111
You know, when I was younger, I used to
take solace when the victim was elderly.

72
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:05,509
I thought, well,
at least he's had a full life,

73
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:09,942
but now that I am older,
I don't get the same solace.

74
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,277
Apparently, no one actually
saw the guard get shot.

75
00:04:13,632 --> 00:04:15,652
They all had their faces
buried in the carpet.

76
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,669
Bank manager saw him walk
into the bathroom before the robbery.

77
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,180
Steps back out, and bam, falls here.

78
00:04:21,342 --> 00:04:22,391
How much they take?

79
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,712
This branch just received
the money delivery.

80
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:26,726
Paul Harris, corporate security.

81
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:28,978
They took $27,000.

82
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:30,971
Could have been worse.

83
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,483
- Not for him.
- Sorry. Of course.

84
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:35,797
- I didn't mean that.
- This bank ever been hit before?

85
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:37,687
No, no. Never.
This is Quantico.

86
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:39,639
I mean, come on.

87
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:43,073
It's a freaking Marine base
that houses the FBI Academy.

88
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,473
Security cameras?

89
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:46,864
I'll get the footage
to your office right away.

90
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:49,787
- Ziva, DiNozzo, witness statements.
- On it, boss.

91
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,015
I thought they were going
to kill us all.

92
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:58,306
I mean, they train us for this,
but...

93
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:01,365
Two guys.

94
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:03,432
Ski masks, automatic weapons.

95
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,793
Maybe Glocks, sir.

96
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:07,650
They were barking orders.
All business.

97
00:05:08,952 --> 00:05:11,126
Definitely three of them.
Big guys.

98
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:12,459
Guns?

99
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:13,705
Big guns.

100
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,303
I only saw one.
There could have been more.

101
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:18,272
Car?

102
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:22,614
- dark Sedan?
- I think it was a pickup.

103
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:24,476
It was a red pickup.

104
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:27,078
Or orange, maybe.

105
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:30,227
It was a white SUV.
I got a good look at it.

106
00:05:31,588 --> 00:05:33,768
You ever shoot anybody, mister?

107
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:47,240
Thanks, Jethro.

108
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,930
Best guess two bad guys in the bank,
a third one driving, boss.

109
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:56,137
Possibly a white SUV.
I put out a BOLO.

110
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:58,440
There's two gates leading
in and out of Quantico.

111
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:00,894
Both of them were closed down
within minutes of the robbery.

112
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:03,978
- Not enough time to make it out.
- What kind of idiots rob a bank with

113
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:06,102
thousands of Marines and
half the FBI around?

114
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,711
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- <i>White Chevy Suburban.</i>

115
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,223
- Where?
<i>- Main gate.</i>

116
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:14,187
White Chevy Suburban,
east of the main gate, perimeter road.

117
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:15,568
You two, go.

118
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:21,445
The suspects may be on the move.

119
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,666
Getaway car didn't leave the base.

120
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:36,554
Not idiots.

121
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:38,933
Pros.

122
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:49,427
I do not understand.

123
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:51,776
If witnesses do not get
a good look at something,

124
00:06:51,863 --> 00:06:53,735
why do they talk out of their ass?

125
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,422
Talking out of one's ass.

126
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,312
That would be
your area of expertise, Tony.

127
00:06:57,392 --> 00:06:59,641
- I'm gonna let you answer that query.
- The general public

128
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:03,422
is about as observant as your average
probie or new recruit.

129
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:05,289
I'm a trained eye.

130
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:07,089
I know
every inch of my environment.

131
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,762
- Is that a fact?
- That's a fact,

132
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:11,182
Jack.

133
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,518
What do we know?

134
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:18,355
Bank robbery occurred moments
after an armored car delivery.

135
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,606
- What does that suggest?
- Perfect timing.

136
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:23,220
A little too perfect.
Denzel Washington, Clive Owen.

137
00:07:23,563 --> 00:07:25,627
<i>Inside Man</i> did an inside job.

138
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,821
Director Vance, I was just...

139
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,090
Explaining your theory of theft
in the workplace,

140
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,742
which is certainly an epidemic.

141
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:36,937
And very wrong.

142
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:41,459
This is Agent Dwayne Wilson,
one of the new recruits.

143
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,445
He was assigned to the fraud unit
for his two-week visit,

144
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,040
but he's a former Marine,
stationed at Quantico.

145
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,649
Thought he might be helpful.

146
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:51,055
So I've temporarily reassigned him
to your team.

147
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:53,235
That's great.

148
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:55,663
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.

149
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:03,584
Thank you.

150
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:08,572
So, Dwayne,
have you been briefed on this case?

151
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,622
Director Vance gave me
some of the particulars.

152
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:12,806
And you heard
Tony's inside-job theory.

153
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:14,691
The problem with Tony's theory

154
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:17,384
is they only got $27,000.

155
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,922
It seems like a lot of effort
for such a little reward.

156
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:23,587
Maybe that's as much as the bank
holds in cash. Did you think to ask?

157
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:25,038
- Did you? You?
- You?

158
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:27,693
If they waited three days,
it would have made a big difference.

159
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:29,978
Holiday weekend for the base.

160
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:32,963
Lot of Marines withdraw
cash for a weekend getaway.

161
00:08:33,602 --> 00:08:35,917
We're talking hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

162
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,388
Well, you'd think
an insider would've known that.

163
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,466
Dwayne, crime scene photos.
Abby's lab.

164
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:47,973
Go. Now!

165
00:08:48,685 --> 00:08:49,750
Yes, sir.

166
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:54,728
Where is Abby's lab?

167
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:08,180
Boss, got the security footage
of the bank robbery.

168
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,235
- Put it up.
- You're looking at it.

169
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:15,118
- What? That's it?
- Digital artifacts.

170
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:18,413
I've tried to reconstruct the image,
but it's too far gone. Watch.

171
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:23,188
Starts here.

172
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:26,441
Ends here.

173
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:28,843
They were extremely fast.

174
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:32,177
Knew how to disable the cameras, were
in and out of the bank in 93 seconds.

175
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,554
- Fix it, McGee.
- I can't. It's gone.

176
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,286
What?
What do you mean, it's gone?

177
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:40,018
The bank uses cameras that transmit
their signals through

178
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:42,110
a computer network
to a central security company.

179
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,279
I searched through access logs.
I searched through keystroke logs.

180
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:49,819
No one accessed the security
system at the time it went down.

181
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:53,532
Owner of the getaway car
was a 64-year-old

182
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:55,626
secretary by the name of Patsy Kipp.

183
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:57,869
She reported the SUV
stolen five days ago.

184
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,948
Long time to hang on to a stolen car.

185
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:02,456
I'm thinking this is not
an inside job, boss.

186
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:05,095
If these guys had waited another
three days, they would've gotten away

187
00:10:05,228 --> 00:10:07,548
with the big weekend cash
delivery over 600 grand.

188
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:10,006
Gee, where have I heard that before?
Yeah, Dwayne.

189
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:12,634
Come on, Tony.
Grabbing credit from a recruit?

190
00:10:12,802 --> 00:10:14,963
I followed up and
checked with the branch manager.

191
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:17,271
That's what an experienced
special agent does.

192
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,420
Dwayne?

193
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:20,795
Agent Dwayne Wilson.

194
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:24,684
The new recruit the director
assigned to us, to you.

195
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:29,370
You didn't know?

196
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:34,545
He didn't know.

197
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,293
I just found out
I've been assigned a rookie.

198
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:44,855
- Only for a few days.
- I don't need him.

199
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,627
You need all the help you can get.

200
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:52,181
A bank robbery in Quantico
is highly embarrassing.

201
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:55,433
If we can't protect our own house,
how can we protect the nation?

202
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:58,849
FBI wants to take over.

203
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:03,099
I asserted that Quantico is first
and foremost a Marine base

204
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:05,514
and, as such,
falls under our jurisdiction.

205
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:07,307
SECNAV backed me.

206
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:11,035
That argument is holding for now, but
I'm going to need a quick resolution.

207
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:13,006
I prefer to choose my own team.

208
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:16,846
Just like you chose
Special Agent Langer?

209
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:21,197
That didn't work out very well,
did it?

210
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,164
Want to hear me say
I made a mistake about Langer?

211
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:28,044
Lot of people
made a mistake about him.

212
00:11:28,718 --> 00:11:29,689
It's history.

213
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,186
Is it, Leon?

214
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:36,248
Let me know
what you think about the rookie.

215
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:50,466
So Major Mass Spec, or Big Daddy,

216
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:53,411
like he sometimes likes to be called,
analyzes solids,

217
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:55,324
liquids, vapors, and solutions,

218
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:57,019
and then an ionizer

219
00:11:57,194 --> 00:12:00,571
converts these substances
into a gaseous state.

220
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,005
Then the ions they're sorted
according to their M/Z ratio.

221
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:05,705
Hey, no touching.

222
00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:07,549
Sorry.

223
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:11,169
This is from the getaway car.
Are you following all this, Dwayne?

224
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:14,653
We give you evidence and
you tell us what it is.

225
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:16,963
Yeah, I guess that's basically it.

226
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:20,303
Hey, Gibbs. I was just giving
Agent Wilson a tour of Abbyville.

227
00:12:22,998 --> 00:12:24,966
- You're Dwayne.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:28,007
You two haven't met?

229
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,334
Awkward.

230
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,479
- What have you got, Abs?
- Lots of burned out ash from the SUV.

231
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:37,000
No touching.
What is it with you two?

232
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,220
Sorry.

233
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,023
I also found traces of an accelerant.

234
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:44,050
Somebody really wanted
this baby to burn.

235
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:46,558
- Destroying evidence.
- Not just any evidence, Gibbs.

236
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,903
Wait till you see
what Big Daddy found.

237
00:12:49,662 --> 00:12:52,247
Traces of magnetic ink and a blend.

238
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:56,042
- A blend?
- 25% cotton and 75% linen.

239
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:58,383
You know what makes
that blend so special?

240
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:02,010
Only the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing is allowed to use it.

241
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:05,531
- Money.
- Technically they call it rag paper.

242
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:07,572
- It's hard to burn.
- Exactly,

243
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:10,395
- which explains the accelerant.
- How much did they barbecue?

244
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:13,731
Based on the amount of trace rag paper
and magnetic ink,

245
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:16,897
I would say all $27,000.

246
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:32,612
This was a sophisticated operation
that took time and money to plan.

247
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:34,985
And after all that,
they burn the proceeds.

248
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:39,524
Time, money, futility.
Sounds like one of McGee's date nights.

249
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:41,765
It was not futility, Tony.
It was by design.

250
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,261
Where have I heard that before?

251
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:44,955
All right, give me some theories.

252
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:47,339
Maybe they could not get off
the base because of the lockdown,

253
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:49,131
so they destroyed all the evidence.

254
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:51,328
They could have stolen
a second car to get out.

255
00:13:52,328 --> 00:13:54,689
- Maybe they wanted embarrass the FBI.
- Already did that.

256
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:57,609
We could be looking for a recently
paroled felon with an ax to grind.

257
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:02,397
Why'd you call on me last, boss? I was
going to say what they said, honest.

258
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:05,072
I have a theory,
but it's not flushed out. Never mind.

259
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:06,344
Agent Wilson.

260
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:09,389
I don't have a theory, sir,

261
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,208
Agent Gibbs, but
if we had access to FBI files,

262
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:15,369
I'd search other unsolved robberies
that knocked out security cameras.

263
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,527
- Follow up on our theories.
- And bank security footage know it.

264
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
On it.

265
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:24,004
Got it.

266
00:14:25,974 --> 00:14:27,132
Got it, boss.

267
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:35,829
Since you do not have a theory,
how about you help Agent Wilson

268
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:36,930
with his?

269
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:38,604
Agent...?

270
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:47,666
- Got it.
- Where do we start?

271
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:49,854
FBI.

272
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:51,969
Let's go, smarty-pants.

273
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:05,722
<i>Agent Langer.</i>

274
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:07,808
<i>One of them
is betraying their country.</i>

275
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:11,286
<i>Langer made the jump to NCIS
eight months ago from the FBI.</i>

276
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:13,914
- <i>He got no special treatment.
- But you did recommend him.</i>

277
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,374
<i>Am I under investigation?</i>

278
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,981
- <i>Should you be?
- I'd like a straight yes or no, sir.</i>

279
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:18,836
<i>Lee?</i>

280
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:21,814
<i>- It's Langer.
- Betraying their country.</i>

281
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,331
<i>- It's Langer.
- You did recommend him.</i>

282
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:35,045
Sign this, please.

283
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,307
Could you have suggested something
that would require more paperwork?

284
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:40,568
I thought the FBI had
this kind of stuff on computer.

285
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:42,371
- They do.
- Here's your copy.

286
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:44,931
They want to take the case.
They're trying to

287
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,574
paper us into submission.

288
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:50,248
Five years of unsolved cases.

289
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:59,630
Interagency transfer.
Means legal's going to be involved,

290
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:03,295
which means you've been here one day
you've already broken Gibbs' rule #13.

291
00:16:04,145 --> 00:16:05,937
- Rule #13?
- Yeah, rule #13:

292
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:09,180
"Never, ever involve lawyers."
Things are bound to turn nasty.

293
00:16:10,476 --> 00:16:12,695
- I'll remember that.
- You should.

294
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:15,387
Gibbs has been divorced three times.

295
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:18,455
He has seven rules that involve lawyers,
none of them pretty.

296
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:21,328
You don't need to know 'em all,
just #13. It's the...

297
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:22,720
umbrella one.

298
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:25,363
What?

299
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:29,261
- How's Gibbs to work for?
- What have you heard?

300
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:33,877
That bad guys would rather confess
than be interrogated by him?

301
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:36,658
That his steely gaze can cool
a room by five degrees?

302
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:39,505
That he can only be killed
by a silver bullet, like a werewolf?

303
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,658
They're all true,
except for the silver bullet part.

304
00:16:41,738 --> 00:16:43,668
Might give him indigestion
or heartburn, but...

305
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:46,027
I don't think it'd kill him.
Any other questions?

306
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:48,176
Just one.

307
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,401
What's Gibbs got against me?

308
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,803
You?

309
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:55,178
Nothing.

310
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:57,696
Don't exactly get
a welcome feeling from him.

311
00:16:57,827 --> 00:17:00,380
Well, he's not exactly
the Mr. Rogers type.

312
00:17:01,115 --> 00:17:03,053
I just got a gut feeling
he doesn't like me.

313
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:04,701
Oh, you have a gut feeling?

314
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,356
Like he's got something against me,
maybe against all outsiders.

315
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,080
Am I right?

316
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:11,740
Long story to that one.

317
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:13,772
What's the short version?

318
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:17,861
Last outsider he let in turned out
to be a bad apple.

319
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,580
How bad?

320
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:24,428
That bad.

321
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:33,761
Here we go.

322
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:36,197
The start of a very bad day
for Mr. Vittorio.

323
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:39,036
The start of his last day, you mean.

324
00:17:39,678 --> 00:17:42,195
- Kid running with ice cream.
- Never ends well.

325
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:43,439
Mom apologizes.

326
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:45,949
And Vittorio heads to the bathroom.

327
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:48,152
That's it.
Cameras go down.

328
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:50,612
Check the security footage
the last three days.

329
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:52,618
Because?

330
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:55,253
Because they're pros, and pros plan.

331
00:17:55,313 --> 00:17:57,369
They would have watched
the bank before they hit it.

332
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:01,289
Come in.

333
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:08,529
Agent Lee, I need a legal opinion.

334
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:10,449
Of course.

335
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:11,724
It's rather sensitive.

336
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,668
How hard is it to terminate agents?

337
00:18:17,141 --> 00:18:18,141
Terminate?

338
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:20,225
Specifically new agents.

339
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:24,701
This pile I'm sold on,
this pile not so much.

340
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:27,649
And you want to terminate
those in the "not so much" pile?

341
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:29,610
I just want to know my legal options.

342
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:34,038
All these agents were signed on
under the old administration.

343
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:37,065
Now, I'm not saying that
there are not some fine people here.

344
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,203
But you'd prefer to be able to choose.

345
00:18:39,989 --> 00:18:41,747
Like I said, options.

346
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:43,351
I understand.

347
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:47,343
Well, new agents are probationary.

348
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,879
I know. Do I need cause
to terminate them?

349
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:53,091
No. If you can articulate
a substantive reason

350
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:54,759
to terminate, that's all you need.

351
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,345
Even before they go to FLETC?

352
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:57,683
Absolutely.

353
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:00,307
That's all I need to know.
Thank you.

354
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,171
You're welcome, sir.

355
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:29,675
Agent Gibbs, I'm so sorry, I...

356
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,686
- Okay.
- I can be such a klutz sometimes.

357
00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:32,746
That's okay.

358
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:37,386
Now you're all settled back into Legal?

359
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:39,058
Yeah, kind of.

360
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:41,508
You know, I was...

361
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:44,685
a little shaken up for a while after
what happened with Langer, but...

362
00:19:45,408 --> 00:19:46,408
I'm okay now.

363
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,473
Missing the fieldwork.

364
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:51,941
You know.

365
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:57,187
I should get back.

366
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:20,273
Yeah. Gibbs.

367
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,598
I'm trying to weed out
the good from the bad.

368
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:26,239
I need you to do a written evaluation
on Agent Wilson.

369
00:20:26,614 --> 00:20:28,395
- Why?
- He's borderline.

370
00:20:29,468 --> 00:20:30,975
Why stick him with me then?

371
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:32,900
He had to go somewhere.

372
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:35,485
I'm going to need that evaluation.

373
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:36,987
Won't be with me long enough.

374
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,159
Bachelor's degree from an online
school only recently accredited.

375
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,076
GPA mediocre at best.

376
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:45,953
Doesn't speak a foreign language.

377
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:47,956
Computer skills barely existent.

378
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:51,083
Putting your stamp on this agency,
are you, Leon?

379
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:54,046
Our agents should look more like
McGee than they do DiNozzo.

380
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,439
More like...

381
00:20:56,618 --> 00:20:57,764
you than like me.

382
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:10,131
- What have we got, Duck?
- Not much.

383
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:13,950
Our old friend here, Ray Vittorio,
was shot at close range.

384
00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:15,535
Under three feet.

385
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:18,862
I extracted this from
what was left of the back of his head.

386
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:20,239
Hollow point.

387
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:26,953
This crew had no qualms about
what they might have to do, and

388
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:28,647
they came armed to do it.

389
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:31,145
You're dealing with
cold-blooded people, Jethro.

390
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:31,905
Yeah.

391
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:34,671
And to rob a bank
on a Marine secure facility,

392
00:21:34,731 --> 00:21:37,459
these individuals must be
extremely desperate or

393
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,937
supremely arrogant.

394
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:39,997
Or both.

395
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,053
Dwayne Wilson.

396
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:44,471
He's a baby agent.

397
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:46,348
And I am looking at his

398
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:48,058
personnel report because?

399
00:21:49,678 --> 00:21:50,686
It's your thing.

400
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:52,511
My thing?

401
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:54,956
I take it that Agent Wilson is alive?

402
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:57,818
- Oh, yeah.
- You don't want me to do an autopsy,

403
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,238
which leaves my other thing.
Psychological profile?

404
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,743
Aptitude tests, psychological reports,

405
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:09,396
academic studies.
Yes, I can work up something.

406
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:12,955
May I ask why you need it?

407
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,333
What kind of man is he, Duck?

408
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:24,434
Surely you, of all people,

409
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,847
don't need me to tell you that.

410
00:22:29,004 --> 00:22:30,004
I appreciate it.

411
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:35,923
No.
You went back too far.

412
00:22:36,317 --> 00:22:37,317
I got it.

413
00:22:37,377 --> 00:22:38,840
No, you went back too far.

414
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:41,069
That's why
I'm going fast forward now.

415
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,655
All right, just let me do it.
Let me do it, please, okay?

416
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:45,814
You handle this like
you handle your car.

417
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:49,753
And if you want to handle anything ever
again, remove your hand from my mouse.

418
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:53,123
Got something.

419
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:55,125
- On the bank security cameras.
- Put it up.

420
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:57,878
I am almost...

421
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,547
- there.
- There it is.

422
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:05,052
- You passed it.
- These controls are too sensitive.

423
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:07,804
Boss...

424
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:10,390
Fine.

425
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,430
All right.

426
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:15,604
Three days prior to the bank robbery.

427
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:17,678
Here it comes.

428
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:20,918
Watch outside the bank.

429
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,153
It's a '99 white Suburban.

430
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,157
Then, 4 minutes 23 seconds later.

431
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,757
Same Suburban.

432
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:32,120
Definitely casing the bank.

433
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,942
Question is, why did they wait
another three days before they hit it?

434
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:37,331
The other question is, why did
they burn the money afterwards?

435
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:38,543
Stop it right there.

436
00:23:42,065 --> 00:23:43,829
That's a different bank guard.

437
00:23:44,517 --> 00:23:46,093
That's why they burned the money.

438
00:23:46,377 --> 00:23:48,338
Because
they were not after the money.

439
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:50,972
No, they were after Vittorio.

440
00:23:51,755 --> 00:23:52,755
This was a hit.

441
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,317
The bank manager
says Ray Vittorio was

442
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:05,112
out sick three days prior
to the bank robbery.

443
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:06,488
Confirms your theory.

444
00:24:06,568 --> 00:24:08,414
I do not understand.
If you want someone dead,

445
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:10,965
you knock on the door.
They answer, you shoot them. Easy.

446
00:24:11,698 --> 00:24:12,536
For some.

447
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:15,580
Ziva's right, though.
Why rob a bank just to kill someone?

448
00:24:16,229 --> 00:24:17,329
Collateral damage.

449
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:21,419
So, they wanted Vittorio's death
to look like collateral damage.

450
00:24:21,803 --> 00:24:24,046
Murder investigation's
different than a bank robbery.

451
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:25,966
And we've been investigating
a bank robbery.

452
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,634
Not anymore. Ziva.

453
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:30,287
I will do a full background
check on Ray Vittorio.

454
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:33,219
And I'm just checking
to see if he has a criminal record.

455
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:37,737
Look at that. Bingo. 1978,

456
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:40,020
felony conviction
for handling stolen property.

457
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:41,702
And he was allowed to carry a gun?

458
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,400
Non-violent offender.

459
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:45,610
Granted a restoration
of rights certificate

460
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:47,237
'cause he served only two years.

461
00:24:47,578 --> 00:24:49,490
30 years ago.
Been clean ever since.

462
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:52,477
Or he hasn't been caught.

463
00:24:55,322 --> 00:24:56,913
So why an NCIS agent?

464
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:01,251
To protect and serve my country.

465
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:04,862
Come on.

466
00:25:05,256 --> 00:25:06,256
Dwayne,

467
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:09,926
I'm trained in the art of extracting
the truth. You can't snow me.

468
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,136
- I can't?
- No.

469
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:13,218
You can't.

470
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:14,972
- For the travel?
- No.

471
00:25:15,202 --> 00:25:16,318
- The babes?
- No.

472
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:17,601
- Carry a gun?
- No.

473
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:18,789
Retirement plan?

474
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:20,697
- No.
- No.

475
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:23,931
To make a difference?

476
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,154
That was a placebo question.

477
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,197
Whatever you say.

478
00:25:33,435 --> 00:25:34,409
Are you serious?

479
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,721
I mean, make a profound difference
in a man's life,

480
00:25:39,293 --> 00:25:40,123
like...

481
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:41,449
Like what?

482
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,629
My dad was an enlisted Marine
in Vietnam.

483
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,641
Accused of murdering an officer.

484
00:25:49,676 --> 00:25:53,052
Said everyone made him for the murder,
except one NIS agent.

485
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:57,140
That agent kept investigating,
even after his boss told him to stop.

486
00:25:58,512 --> 00:26:00,159
Ended up exonerating my dad.

487
00:26:01,132 --> 00:26:04,063
If not for that agent,
Dad never would've married Mom,

488
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,815
never would've had me.

489
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
Dad never forgot.

490
00:26:08,326 --> 00:26:10,808
Told us to always include him
in our prayers.

491
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,170
I wanted to be NCIS...

492
00:26:14,788 --> 00:26:16,764
to make that kind of a difference.

493
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:19,220
Okay, I buy that.

494
00:26:22,072 --> 00:26:23,667
Why did you become an NCIS agent?

495
00:26:23,912 --> 00:26:25,293
For the guns and the babes.

496
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:27,045
You're kidding, right?

497
00:26:27,262 --> 00:26:28,479
I got something.

498
00:26:29,953 --> 00:26:33,093
Klaasson's Diamond Boutique
in Maryland six months ago.

499
00:26:33,704 --> 00:26:35,136
It's a regular day, right?

500
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:36,703
And then...

501
00:26:36,968 --> 00:26:37,968
Wait for it.

502
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,434
And finally.

503
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:43,186
97 seconds later.

504
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:47,795
Four million dollars
in diamonds out the door.

505
00:26:47,855 --> 00:26:49,755
None of which have turned up
since the robbery.

506
00:26:49,815 --> 00:26:52,331
Witnesses claimed
they saw two men in ski masks.

507
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:54,078
- Getaway driver.
- Makes three.

508
00:26:54,138 --> 00:26:55,269
These are our guys.

509
00:26:55,465 --> 00:26:57,241
- They're good.
- And they know it.

510
00:26:57,327 --> 00:27:00,003
- That's their weakness.
- Are we back to robbery as a motive?

511
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,947
That's the robbery.

512
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:04,249
Vittorio's the murder.

513
00:27:05,078 --> 00:27:06,418
Money, commonalities,

514
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:07,836
employees, relatives.

515
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,252
You chase everything.

516
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:10,835
Now!

517
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:16,123
- Yeah, Duck.
<i>- I have the Wilson assessment.</i>

518
00:27:16,183 --> 00:27:17,330
On my way.

519
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,307
Robbery-Homicide, please.

520
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,032
I'll hold.

521
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:23,829
Can I help?

522
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:24,893
Certainly can.

523
00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:25,854
Long night.

524
00:27:26,307 --> 00:27:27,377
Coffee.

525
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,072
Finished.

526
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:38,700
You know, Jethro, the more time
I spend with someone,

527
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:41,568
the more accurate
I can make my evaluation.

528
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:43,578
Working from
other people's assessments

529
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:46,156
and reports is far from satisfactory.

530
00:27:46,768 --> 00:27:48,628
But I'll give it a shot.

531
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:53,506
This agent is more
street-smart than book-smart.

532
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:56,769
He possesses great inner strength.

533
00:27:57,257 --> 00:27:58,472
He's very focused.

534
00:27:59,048 --> 00:28:02,274
He has a strong sense
of justice that drives him.

535
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:06,227
He is unrelenting
to the point of obsession.

536
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,688
We're not talking about

537
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:11,232
a good agent here.
We're talking about

538
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:13,735
an exceptional investigator.

539
00:28:14,147 --> 00:28:17,538
But such dedication comes at a cost.

540
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:20,334
- Married?
- Married four times,

541
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:21,868
divorced three.

542
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:27,098
That's a nice try, Duck.

543
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,272
I'm not finished, Jethro.

544
00:28:30,147 --> 00:28:33,900
We're talking about a man
who acts on his gut instinct.

545
00:28:34,307 --> 00:28:37,050
Who relies on his ability
to judge people,

546
00:28:37,473 --> 00:28:38,898
and he's rarely wrong.

547
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,364
As a result,

548
00:28:40,842 --> 00:28:44,370
he's a man who never suffers
from self-doubt.

549
00:28:45,968 --> 00:28:47,022
Until now?

550
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,344
You don't have all the answers.

551
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:55,839
You recommended that Agent Langer
be brought into the agency.

552
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,214
Now, as a result of his actions,

553
00:28:58,274 --> 00:29:01,533
you're having difficulty trusting
your judgment about this young man.

554
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,703
You're simply

555
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:06,488
feeling vulnerable, Jethro.

556
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:13,615
Appreciate the assessment.

557
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:19,649
What's that?

558
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:22,762
It is a test program to check
the bank's wireless Internet connection.

559
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:23,744
Why?

560
00:29:24,003 --> 00:29:26,581
Because I have already checked
the security system.

561
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:28,142
Process of elimination.

562
00:29:28,223 --> 00:29:30,478
Then, it's always nice
to look busy when the boss walks in.

563
00:29:30,714 --> 00:29:32,076
Hit pay dirt, boss.

564
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:35,525
The security company that was protecting
Klaasson's Diamond Boutique

565
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:38,193
is the same security company
the bank uses in Quantico.

566
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:41,739
Which is owned by Paul Harris.
His company is maxed-out on its

567
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,155
credit line, and is two months
in arrears on its rent.

568
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,280
Had a bad feeling about that guy.
His teeth sparkled.

569
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,760
- Meaning?
- Meaning...

570
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:50,501
no one has teeth that white unless
they have something to hide.

571
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:52,204
Maybe the bank cameras were not jammed.

572
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:54,334
Maybe they were switched off
from Harris' office.

573
00:29:54,415 --> 00:29:56,588
Wasn't the cameras.
It was the Internet connection.

574
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:57,843
Take a look, boss.

575
00:29:57,903 --> 00:29:59,592
I was checking the bank's broadband.

576
00:29:59,652 --> 00:30:01,904
For the 93 seconds
those cameras went down,

577
00:30:01,964 --> 00:30:04,721
bank's network was overloaded
with three million simultaneous

578
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,514
hits, all from a single source.

579
00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:09,673
It slowed down the system so much, it
couldn't transmit the security footage.

580
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:11,978
There are system protocols that
should've prevented this.

581
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:15,148
Who better to beat the system
than the guy who installed it?

582
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:18,473
I know a little about suits,
and that one's pretty expensive, huh?

583
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:22,113
You brought me here
to compliment me on my suit?

584
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,657
How do you get those teeth so white?

585
00:30:24,737 --> 00:30:26,340
You, uh, cap 'em?

586
00:30:26,777 --> 00:30:28,578
You like to use
those whitening strips?

587
00:30:29,154 --> 00:30:31,468
How about the mouth guard
with the gunky gel in it?

588
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:33,189
You use one of those?
How do you do it?

589
00:30:34,652 --> 00:30:35,919
Tony has his own style.

590
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:38,463
Sort of <i>Dirty Harry</i> meets

591
00:30:38,543 --> 00:30:39,680
<i>Keystone Cop</i>.

592
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:41,942
<i>You got a serious question for me,</i>

593
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:43,316
Agent DiNozzo?

594
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:44,965
Yeah.

595
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:47,576
How's business, Paul?

596
00:30:48,656 --> 00:30:49,656
It's fine.

597
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:57,941
That was a big one.

598
00:30:58,342 --> 00:31:00,145
Lies make my ears itch.

599
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,532
You should know that.

600
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:03,021
So let me ask again.

601
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:05,436
How's business, Paul?

602
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:10,286
I've been going through
a rough patch, actually.

603
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,159
Yeah, that sounds like the truth.

604
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,309
And yet, you've got the expensive
clothes and the...

605
00:31:16,912 --> 00:31:18,977
nice bright white teeth,

606
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:22,445
expensive boat, super-expensive house.

607
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:25,845
How do you reconcile all those things?

608
00:31:25,905 --> 00:31:27,914
Maybe by robbing a bank and
a diamond dealer?

609
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:29,286
I'm sorry. What?

610
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:32,809
Klaasson's Diamond Boutique,
same MO, same security company:

611
00:31:33,168 --> 00:31:34,168
yours.

612
00:31:34,908 --> 00:31:36,143
Klaasson's was a...

613
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,299
some time ago.

614
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:42,819
Did you run out of money?

615
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:45,989
I wasn't involved with that.

616
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:48,198
Your security cameras, Paul.

617
00:31:49,987 --> 00:31:52,077
I don't know...
how they did it. Okay?

618
00:31:54,531 --> 00:31:55,455
Unbearable.

619
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,968
You're gonna push me a little bit,
aren't you?

620
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:03,134
We have a McGnome in our office.
He never gets out. He smells like

621
00:32:03,194 --> 00:32:04,507
an overheated computer chip.

622
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:08,062
<i>But, boy, man alive,
does he know computers, inside and out.</i>

623
00:32:08,122 --> 00:32:09,721
<i>And he explained to me</i>

624
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,537
that there was this network, right,

625
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:14,266
and it got bombarded
with all these hits,

626
00:32:14,347 --> 00:32:18,146
and it slowed it way down,
and disabled the camera.

627
00:32:18,382 --> 00:32:19,534
It's kind of crazy.

628
00:32:19,594 --> 00:32:22,956
And he also said,
protocol should have prevented it,

629
00:32:23,314 --> 00:32:25,444
protocols that
you could've gotten around.

630
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:29,720
Okay.

631
00:32:30,004 --> 00:32:31,826
It was a flaw in the system.
All right?

632
00:32:32,295 --> 00:32:33,295
A flaw?

633
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:36,915
I learned about it
after the diamond robbery.

634
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:38,498
That's convenient.

635
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,711
Look, I'll show you my records.
I've been...

636
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:42,461
fixing it on site.

637
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,041
And I didn't get around
to Quantico because...

638
00:32:45,101 --> 00:32:46,841
come on, who robs Quantico?

639
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:49,426
Without a cash influx, you're
gonna be out of business in two months.

640
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:52,084
I told you, I'll show you my records.

641
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:54,307
You'll see,
I've been fixing the problem.

642
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:56,029
I'm gonna track down

643
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:58,803
every move you've made
in the last six months,

644
00:32:58,863 --> 00:33:02,042
and I'm gonna have a little chat
with every person you know.

645
00:33:02,102 --> 00:33:03,278
Don't do that, okay?

646
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:06,291
Why?

647
00:33:07,013 --> 00:33:08,583
'Cause you'll ruin it.

648
00:33:11,217 --> 00:33:11,949
"It"?

649
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,917
My wedding plans.

650
00:33:14,532 --> 00:33:16,253
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

651
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,832
They say a picture's
worth a thousand words.

652
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:26,750
Her name's Stella Rawlings.

653
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,257
And?

654
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:31,642
And she's heir to one of the largest
wine distributorships

655
00:33:32,591 --> 00:33:33,752
on the East Coast.

656
00:33:35,386 --> 00:33:37,139
See, I don't need to rob a bank.

657
00:33:38,993 --> 00:33:40,832
I'm about to marry one.

658
00:33:53,222 --> 00:33:54,534
That is gonna leave a mark.

659
00:33:54,896 --> 00:33:56,162
Look at that.

660
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,499
I scratched myself in the line
of duty, boss. I'll live.

661
00:34:03,297 --> 00:34:06,044
Ray Vittorio was a widower
with a 28-year-old son.

662
00:34:06,104 --> 00:34:08,088
- And?
- And that son has a record too,

663
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,924
- handling stolen property.
- Daddy passed the baton.

664
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:13,720
Except his son has dealt
in higher-end items:

665
00:34:13,856 --> 00:34:15,929
- paintings, artifacts.
- Where is he?

666
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,100
Last known address was in Maryland. But
his former landlord said he disappeared

667
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:21,561
six months ago.
I cannot track him anywhere.

668
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,478
The diamond robbery
was six months ago.

669
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,732
It's not a coincidence.
Keep looking.

670
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:32,613
Wait. Go back.

671
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:36,951
Stop.

672
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:41,706
This guy,
right here, with his back to us.

673
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:43,541
Zoom in on his right arm.

674
00:34:46,874 --> 00:34:47,587
More.

675
00:34:50,793 --> 00:34:53,536
Where have I seen that tattoo before?

676
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,926
What are you doing?

677
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,323
I'm arranging my thoughts.

678
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:09,567
Pull up the bank robbery footage.

679
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:12,111
- Why?
- Just do it... McGee.

680
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:15,990
Move.

681
00:35:20,029 --> 00:35:21,111
I saw this earlier.

682
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:24,290
I wondered why someone would be
covering up such a nice piece of artwork

683
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:26,542
on a warm day. Very strange.

684
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,152
Watch.

685
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,256
When we interviewed him
outside the bank,

686
00:35:37,316 --> 00:35:39,430
tattoo man said
his name was Curtis Ranier,

687
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:41,674
- had a driver's license to prove it.
- Which was fake.

688
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:43,252
His real name is James Meyers.

689
00:35:43,312 --> 00:35:45,519
He's an ex-con,
did time for electronic theft.

690
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,861
That's four bank robbers.

691
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:50,023
Two men in ski masks,
one getaway driver, and...

692
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:52,592
- him.
- Known associates, McGee. Find them.

693
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:53,402
On it.

694
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:54,917
There's more.

695
00:35:54,977 --> 00:35:56,531
Guess who his cellmate was.

696
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,575
Joey Vittorio,

697
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:00,827
the dead guard's son.

698
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:03,371
Before the diamond heist,
Vittorio served

699
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,623
four years in the Maryland
Correctional Institution

700
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:06,752
in Hagerstown.

701
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:08,333
Meyers served seven.

702
00:36:08,414 --> 00:36:09,414
Duck.

703
00:36:09,474 --> 00:36:11,129
Has Ray Vittorio's body
been collected?

704
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:13,589
Joey Vittorio is missing.

705
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,218
Meyers and his crew killed
his dad as part of the bank robbery.

706
00:36:17,453 --> 00:36:19,171
- Why?
- Collateral damage.

707
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,347
Ziva,
find out when he's being buried.

708
00:36:21,427 --> 00:36:23,244
Because money wasn't the object.

709
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,565
They wanted to lure Joey
out of hiding.

710
00:36:25,776 --> 00:36:29,031
He must've been their fence. He kept
the diamonds, so they never turned up.

711
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:31,877
- He must've gone underground with 'em.
- But he'll go to his dad's funeral...

712
00:36:31,937 --> 00:36:34,428
If he thinks it has something
to do with the stolen diamonds.

713
00:36:34,488 --> 00:36:35,736
Known associates, boss.

714
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:40,032
They've all done time.

715
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:42,201
Gibbs, the funeral is happening now.

716
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:43,536
Let's go.

717
00:36:48,302 --> 00:36:50,115
... reception at the Parrish Hall.

718
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,939
Thank you for your attendance.

719
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:02,637
- Ray Vittorio was a popular man.
- Italian, what do you expect?

720
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,930
The service is ending.

721
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:05,615
Let's move.

722
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:06,967
Stay.

723
00:37:07,173 --> 00:37:09,614
- I'm an agent.
- Without a weapon. Guard the car.

724
00:37:10,302 --> 00:37:11,302
Spread out.

725
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:13,218
Look for Meyers and his crew.

726
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,579
- Anybody, anything?
- That's a negative, boss.

727
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:28,042
Negative.

728
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:29,178
No.

729
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:34,420
Maybe they're not here.

730
00:37:34,618 --> 00:37:35,618
They're here.

731
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:42,428
- Let go!
- We can talk.

732
00:37:42,509 --> 00:37:45,389
- We can work this out!
- On the road, black SUV, eastern side.

733
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:47,225
Move it. Go! Go! Go! Go!

734
00:37:48,274 --> 00:37:49,837
Get in the car, Joey.

735
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:55,660
Get us out of here.

736
00:37:56,744 --> 00:37:58,096
He's got us blocked in.

737
00:37:59,178 --> 00:38:00,154
Hey, Nana.

738
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:03,115
- Time to go.
- Hey, buddy, move your car.

739
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,826
Sure, no problem.
Just have to get my grandma here.

740
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,107
Nana, are you ready to go?

741
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:09,664
Go?

742
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:11,082
Come on.

743
00:38:16,918 --> 00:38:17,918
Cops!

744
00:38:18,865 --> 00:38:20,258
Get down.

745
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:22,307
Federal agents!

746
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:30,226
NCIS! Drop your weapons!

747
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,440
Don't shoot!

748
00:38:37,786 --> 00:38:39,318
Don't shoot!

749
00:38:39,574 --> 00:38:41,651
Get out of the car!
Put your hands on the ground.

750
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:43,777
All right. We're coming out!

751
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,838
- On the ground!
- Please, don't shoot.

752
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,875
- Get down on the ground.
- Now!

753
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,694
You're not my grandson.

754
00:39:10,937 --> 00:39:12,018
For a job well done.

755
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:15,229
It might mean more if you paid for it.

756
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:17,773
We're government employees.
Get used to disappointment.

757
00:39:18,393 --> 00:39:19,567
Good luck at FLETC.

758
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:22,319
Yes, and a word of advice.
The ATF girls

759
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,489
are smokin' hot. They're a little crazy,
but they're really hot.

760
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:27,283
I'm married, Tony.

761
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,676
Only talk to the Bureau
of Prisons girls.

762
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,877
That'll keep you celibate,
unless you're like McGee.

763
00:39:34,465 --> 00:39:36,542
Just don't mouth off
to the instructors...

764
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,627
Or the Bureau of Prisons Girls.

765
00:39:38,936 --> 00:39:40,463
... And you'll be fine.

766
00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:37,895
Your assessment of Agent Wilson?

767
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:43,276
You didn't write anything.

768
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:46,819
"Recommended."

769
00:40:47,308 --> 00:40:48,334
Write that.

770
00:40:55,628 --> 00:40:56,821
- Wilson.
- Sir?

771
00:40:56,881 --> 00:40:57,969
Good luck.

772
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:15,724
Bourbon, neat.

773
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,181
On your own tonight?

774
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:28,945
No.
