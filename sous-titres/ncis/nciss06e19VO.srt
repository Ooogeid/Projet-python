00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:05,370
<i>If you're going to go on the attack,</i>

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,686
<i>you have to be prepared
for a proportionate response.</i>

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,513
<i>There are times when restraint is a far
better option than engaging the enemy.</i>

5
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:12,973
Dad.

6
00:00:15,398 --> 00:00:17,894
<i>I know your mother can be a challenge
to deal with it, honey.</i>

7
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,355
I heard that, Mike.

8
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:25,971
Bye, Daddy.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,153
Miss you.

10
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:29,293
<i>Bye, sweetie.
I miss you, too.</i>

11
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:36,546
What do you know?

12
00:00:36,882 --> 00:00:38,539
We finally have a moment...

13
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:41,183
alone.

14
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,094
Noah!

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,384
What did your father say
to you not two minutes ago?

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,311
Go and clean your room.

17
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:04,280
Fine.

18
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,606
If the prince won't do it unless
the king is home, the evil queen will.

19
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:10,594
No, wait!

20
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:13,818
You know what? We cannot go through
this every time your father deploys.

21
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:16,298
- Stop! No! I'll do it.
- You're 12 years old.

22
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:18,140
Should not have to do this for you.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,832
You should be able to do
this sort of thing for yourself.

24
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:22,609
I said I'll do it.

25
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:26,421
What are you hiding in here?

26
00:01:26,632 --> 00:01:28,241
Nothing... it's just my stuff.

27
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:33,595
It's just Pokemon cards.

28
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:35,836
Really?

29
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:40,812
And what special powers
does Miss February have?

30
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:42,546
It's Eddie Kemp's.

31
00:01:43,765 --> 00:01:44,860
He wants it back.

32
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:49,818
Honey, real women do not look
this way.

33
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:52,094
They airbrush out every single...

34
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,439
pimple and scar and anything else
that they don't want you to see.

39
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:36,034
I do not know, Tony.
It is a miracle of science.

40
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,284
It is.

41
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,108
I mean, it's the weirdest thing.

42
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,213
Why doesn't the glue stick
to the inside of the bottle?

43
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:43,743
You must know this.

44
00:02:43,803 --> 00:02:44,903
 McGeek, why?

45
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:45,875
Not now.

46
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:47,210
If not now, when?

47
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:49,003
Two minutes, 29 seconds.

48
00:02:50,115 --> 00:02:51,820
What are you up to, McSneaky?

49
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:57,387
Robert Forgan hickory-shafted
hand-forged irons.

50
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,237
Aren't those the same clubs
that Ducky has?

51
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:00,014
Had.

52
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:01,599
I borrowed them and

53
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,144
accidentally backed over them
with a golf cart before I made it

54
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,311
to the first tee.

55
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:07,605
- Did you tell Ducky?
- Are you kidding?

56
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:10,112
He told Ducky, he'd end up
on one of his autopsy tables.

57
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:11,359
I am going to tell Ducky

58
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,436
once I successfully win
a replacement set.

59
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,308
Perhaps if you just explained...

60
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:19,325
That you destroyed a set of handmade
clubs given to Ducky by some

61
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:20,793
Scottish nobleman?

62
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,285
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

63
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:24,379
I am in the crucial final moments
of this auction,

64
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,845
so if you don't mind, please...

65
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,177
- Sorry.
- Of course.

66
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:31,843
Aren't you supposed to make a bid?

67
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:34,090
You don't place your bid
until the very last moment

68
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,884
so that no one has
a chance to outbid you.

69
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:38,303
It is called sniping

70
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:39,278
and...

71
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:41,973
You didn't win.

72
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,483
- I've been out-sniped.
- Speaking of snipers,

73
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:46,185
has anyone seen Gibbs?

74
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:47,437
Gear up.

75
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:49,689
You're not Gibbs.

76
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:52,204
There was a gun found
in navy base housing.

77
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,295
Abby, that doesn't warrant
a team call-out.

78
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:56,654
A) There are thousands
of guns on a navy base...

79
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:58,364
And B) you're not Gibbs.

80
00:03:58,682 --> 00:04:01,993
Okay, what if I told you that the base
MPs gave me the gun to test?

81
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:03,769
Doesn't warrant a team call-out.

82
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:06,080
And the gun was found
under a kid's bed,

83
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:08,214
and it was loaded.

84
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:10,001
Still does not warrant a call-out.

85
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:14,379
And it was recently fired.

86
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:16,174
It's not a call-out.

87
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,675
You heard the lady, gear up.

88
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:20,266
They only listen
to their master, Gibbs.

89
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:22,295
Only you can crack the whip.

90
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:24,766
Only you can drink this swill.

91
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,749
It's just a gun
on a navy base, boss.

92
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,711
There's brain matter on the barrel,
DiNozzo.

93
00:04:28,771 --> 00:04:30,772
Somebody shot someone
in the head with that weapon.

94
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,877
You left that part out, Abby.

95
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,895
That's right, people.

96
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:36,351
Mush.

97
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:40,126
Hi.

98
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,033
NCIS, Special Agent Gibbs.

99
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:43,475
Mrs. Taffet?

100
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:44,572
Yes.

101
00:04:44,748 --> 00:04:47,163
We need to talk to your son,
Noah, about the gun he found.

102
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:50,908
Yes, of course.
Come on in.

103
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:54,251
Excuse me.

104
00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:55,421
Home by 11:00.

105
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:57,658
That's not what Dad and I agreed to.

106
00:04:57,718 --> 00:05:00,593
In case you haven't noticed,
there has been a regime change.

107
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,589
Next time, I'm going to Iraq.

108
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,727
So, where did you find the gun?

109
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,254
I found it at the playground.

110
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:13,773
Just lying there?

111
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,149
On the ground?

112
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:17,317
In the storm drain.

113
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:19,153
Why did you take it?

114
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:24,951
- Because he's obsessed with guns.
- I'm not obsessed with guns.

115
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:26,710
It's all he
and his friends talk about:

116
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,872
M4s and Tec-9s and AK-47s.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,801
Sorry.

118
00:05:37,256 --> 00:05:38,589
Why did you take the gun?

119
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:41,003
I guess...

120
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,044
I thought it was cool.

121
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:46,100
Would you still think it was cool

122
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,266
if I told you this gun was used
to kill somebody?

123
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:52,469
Naked girls and guns.

124
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:55,273
That's
what childhood dreams are made of.

125
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,817
Guessing we experienced
very different childhoods.

126
00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:00,716
You're going to tell me
that little Timmy never had a magazine

127
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:02,049
with pictures of girls?

128
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,115
Little Timmy never had
a magazine with pictures of girls.

129
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:06,617
Pictures of boys?

130
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:08,318
As a matter of fact, yes.

131
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,038
It was called "Scouting Life".

132
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:14,666
I suppose you had a subscription
to Playpen by age 12?

133
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:15,530
Ten.

134
00:06:15,764 --> 00:06:16,875
We all chipped in.

135
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:20,346
Playpen was practically required
reading back in boarding school.

136
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:24,894
You know what my father would've done
to me if he found this in my room?

137
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:26,471
Stolen it back?

138
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:28,931
Slap me on the side
of the head with it.

139
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:30,885
That sounds vaguely familiar.

140
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:34,216
Come on.

141
00:06:44,677 --> 00:06:46,407
You sure this is
where you found the gun?

142
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,628
Yeah.
It was right in there.

143
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:51,999
Do you remember which way
the barrel was pointing?

144
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:57,429
That way.

145
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:02,031
He's a good boy.

146
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:05,665
He just wants
so badly to be grown up.

147
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,582
Yeah.

148
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:09,305
Well, it's always hard
when their dads deploy.

149
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,568
It wasn't that easy before
Mike deployed.

150
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:14,477
I've got one entering puberty
and another entering the house

151
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:15,845
at 5:00 in the morning.

152
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:23,945
These friends of Noah's?

153
00:07:24,506 --> 00:07:26,894
Yeah, that's Zane Wilson
and Travis Buckley.

154
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:28,390
They're Noah's best friends.

155
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:30,187
Excuse me a second.

156
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,452
Hey, guys... Travis.

157
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:33,708
Zane.

158
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:36,707
You got a minute?

159
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:44,757
So, Zane, your dad deployed, too?

160
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,558
He talk to you
about telling the truth?

161
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:00,795
Is this where Noah found the gun?

162
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:04,882
He didn't find it.

163
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:07,247
Travis did.

164
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:10,349
Is this an official interrogation?

165
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:11,324
No.

166
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:13,452
'Cause if it is,
I should have a lawyer present.

167
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:15,204
Why, you do something wrong, Travis?

168
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:16,622
That's called entrapment.

169
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:17,832
Says who?

170
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,876
My mom.
She's a lawyer.

171
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,374
- Your friends ever show you the gun?
- No.

172
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:24,881
- Never told you about it?
- No.

173
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,796
Never showed you
the bullets in the magazine?

174
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,509
It didn't have a magazine.

175
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:34,461
So, you see, the thing is, Noah,

176
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,306
that our lab...

177
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,038
found this...

178
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:40,292
sediment inside
the barrel of the gun,

179
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,229
but it doesn't match the sandy...

180
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:44,564
residue that...

181
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:47,278
that we found inside
the storm drain.

182
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:51,043
Guess somebody must have moved it.

183
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:53,117
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.

184
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,300
Travis?

185
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:55,088
Maybe.

186
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:56,206
Zane?

187
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,010
I don't know.

188
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,450
Maybe you?

189
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:04,761
So, where was the gun really found?

190
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:10,989
Where did Travis find the gun?

191
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,754
Next to the dead body.

192
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,861
This reminds me of the forests
I used to have fun in as a child.

193
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:30,613
Find that hard to believe.

194
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:32,518
What, that Israel had forests?

195
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,541
No, that you had fun as a child.

196
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:35,713
Oh, sure.

197
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:39,696
My father used to blindfold us
and take us into the middle...

198
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:43,734
of the forest, and then we had to find
our way out, by ourselves.

199
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:46,450
I stand corrected.

200
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:48,839
I thought it was around here.

201
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,529
This is where you found the body?

202
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:51,928
Yeah, but...

203
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:56,389
It looks different
with all the grass.

204
00:09:58,308 --> 00:09:59,892
How many of you boys are Scouts?

205
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:02,436
No Scouts?

206
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:04,897
Anyone remember
the position of the sun?

207
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:07,521
Landmarks?

208
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,113
Streams?

209
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:10,508
Fallen trees?

210
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,208
Unusual-looking rocks?

211
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:16,993
Yeah, it was right next to that tree
that Travis said looked like a naked

212
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,244
- woman.
- I did not.

213
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:19,539
- Did so.
- Did not.

214
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,997
- You totally did, Trav.
- I didn't say naked.

215
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:25,014
We're not going to spend the night
dodging trains

216
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,929
and pulling leeches out
of our underwear.

217
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:27,992
Got me?

218
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,464
<i>Stand by Me</i>.
Little movie reference.

219
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:31,757
Kiefer's best work.

220
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,051
All right, you guys
can rent that movie

221
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:36,637
after you show us
where you found the body.

222
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:41,352
- Their moms are on the way.
- Thanks.

223
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,771
Their moms are going
to help us find the body?

224
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:49,441
They're not coming
to help them find the body.

225
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,694
They're coming to be
with them when they do.

226
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,779
Oh, right.

227
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:58,334
- Yeah, Abs?
<i>- I got something on the gun.</i>

228
00:10:58,394 --> 00:10:59,413
Be right there.

229
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,526
- Ziva, you're with me.
- Lucky you.

230
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:03,789
DiNozzo, you're in charge.
Find the body.

231
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,845
Lucky me.

232
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:08,304
O.K.
Boys. Focus.

233
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:11,849
Show us where you found the body.

234
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,036
We didn't keep the gun now.

235
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,229
You were the one
who told them about the body.

236
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:18,930
What was I supposed to do, lie?

237
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,750
Yes.

238
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:25,803
Do you have any idea
what world of pain

239
00:11:25,863 --> 00:11:27,772
these kids will be in
when their dads get home?

240
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:29,713
You ever see <i>The Great Santini</i>?

241
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,484
Don't need to see it.
I lived it.

242
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,774
Yeah, I forgot old man.
McGee was navy, wasn't he?

243
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:35,728
That's right.

244
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,158
Yeah, this was my childhood.
I was just like these kids.

245
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:40,651
Which one were you?

246
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:43,147
The skinny one, the quiet one
or the one with the hot mom?

247
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:51,166
Boys!

248
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:59,786
I've been running the DNA
from the brain matter on the gun.

249
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:02,485
No matches yet. As a matter fact,
I don't have any test results back yet.

250
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,494
I didn't say I didn't have anything.

251
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:06,769
This gun was used to commit...

252
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,638
Murder.

253
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,503
Yeah, I already know that, Abs.

254
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,898
Do you know who was shot?

255
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:13,776
I can do better than that.
I can tell you who fired the weapon.

256
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:19,706
Wrong window.

257
00:12:20,177 --> 00:12:21,826
McGee has me babysitting
his auctions.

258
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:24,165
Okay.

259
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:26,747
Victim. Leonard Caswell.
Postal worker.

260
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,500
He was shot at point-blank range
by Robert Perry.

261
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:31,059
His neighbor.
It's kind of funny.

262
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,462
Non postal worker going postal
on a postal worker?

263
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:37,465
Not funny like ha-ha funny,
but funny like

264
00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:40,971
comically, absurdly, amusing funny.
Like ironic.

265
00:12:42,402 --> 00:12:43,931
Comedy is... is very subjective.

266
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:46,016
That is a four-year-old case, Abby.

267
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:49,002
- You said the weapon was recently used.
- It was.

268
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:51,480
It just picked up
some experience before that.

269
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,399
Four years ago,

270
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:56,163
the gun was introduced as evidence
in Robert Perry's murder trial.

271
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:57,443
It was the murder weapon.

272
00:12:57,503 --> 00:13:00,197
Somehow the gun got out of evidence
and into the hands of a 12-year-old.

273
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:01,490
Who held the evidence?

274
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,492
We did.

275
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:06,552
It was an NCIS case.

276
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:12,501
You know, Noah, I got my first merit
badge when I was about your age.

277
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:13,429
Oh! Yeah!

278
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:16,051
Do a lot of very cool stuff
as a scout.

279
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:17,548
Camping...

280
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:18,766
tracking...

281
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:21,343
even get to wear a special uniform.

282
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:24,972
You trying to talk him
into or out of it, McGee?

283
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:26,974
Hey, you poke fun
all you want, Tony.

284
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:29,482
Scouting teaches you skills.

285
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,730
For example, did you kids know

286
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,688
that when something dies in the woods,
it affects animal behavior?

287
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:38,360
That's right.

288
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:40,237
Mountain lions, for example,

289
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:43,402
kick up piles of pine needles
to mark their find.

290
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,807
Bears...

291
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:49,048
will leave
their bite marks on trees.

292
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:52,248
- Hold on.
- What do you got there, McRanger Rick?

293
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:56,670
Some animals mark their territory
by regurgitating their food.

294
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:58,964
That's where Zane barfed
when we found the body.

295
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,383
And there's Travis' naked woman!

296
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:03,928
- Where?
- This way, over here!

297
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:06,931
- That's where the body is!
- Travis, be careful!

298
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,307
The body's right over here.

299
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:11,727
It was here.

300
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:18,609
Is anything where you say it is?

301
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,613
<i>Seven Years in Tibet</i>,
and we got nothing.

302
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,821
I wouldn't say nothing.

303
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,661
What is it?

304
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,455
Maggots.

305
00:14:36,357 --> 00:14:38,058
Looks like piece of an ear.

306
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,577
Holy <i>Blue Velvet</i>, McGee.

307
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:45,755
There was definitely a body here.

308
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:49,306
Where's the rest of it?

309
00:14:58,062 --> 00:15:00,196
Crime scene's about a quarter mile
from the playground.

310
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:03,153
Only sign of a victim we got is...
an ear.

311
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,863
- The boys?
<i>- Sent them home.</i>

312
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:06,818
Daniel McBoone's doing
his best tracker thing,

313
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:08,734
but I think we should send in
the cadaver dogs

314
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:10,911
<i>Your call.</i>
You just find the body, DiNozzo.

315
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:12,162
All right.

316
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:15,795
Body was dragged, then vanished.

317
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:19,044
Tire tracks.

318
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,907
Body didn't vanish,
it was wheeled away.

319
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:25,328
Tread's pretty narrow.

320
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:26,385
Kind of waffle-y.

321
00:15:27,346 --> 00:15:28,289
Ziva...

322
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:29,722
gets to go home.

323
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,670
We're stuck out here
with the maggots.

324
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,934
I love the outdoors.

325
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,064
I checked our evidence log,
pulled the NCIS file on the murder case.

326
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:40,441
Agent Cassidy's case.

327
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,366
The killer, Robert Perry,
worked for the Navy.

328
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:47,394
He stole the gun from its legal owner,
then used it to commit murder.

329
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,860
After the trial was over
and appeals were exhausted...

330
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:52,745
Gun was returned
to its original owner.

331
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:54,109
Yes.

332
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:55,164
To this man,

333
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,124
Peter Draper,

334
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:59,288
who claims
that his wife did not want him to keep

335
00:15:59,348 --> 00:16:00,752
a gun associated with murder,

336
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,838
and so he sold it to a pawnshop.

337
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,917
It didn't stay there long. I finished
running ballistics on the gun.

338
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:08,417
I matched it to two other crimes
in the last two months.

339
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:10,050
The gun was fired both times.

340
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:11,639
Pawnshop owner sold the gun.

341
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:14,755
Or pawnshop held up
two convenience stores.

342
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:16,018
Unlikely.

343
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,452
Ziva, pull case files
from Norfolk P.D.

344
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,009
Find out who bought that gun.

345
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:25,861
You heard her.

346
00:16:33,377 --> 00:16:34,947
I could get used to this.

347
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:36,052
Don't.

348
00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:41,198
I thought Scouts helped
little old ladies...

349
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:42,606
and sold cookies.

350
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,901
I didn't know they trained you
to track dead bodies.

351
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,994
You learn to read changes
to the terrain, Tony.

352
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:54,815
Oh, God.

353
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:57,059
Lost the trail on the asphalt.

354
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,529
Really.

355
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:03,357
Admit defeat, McGee.

356
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:05,818
I'm going to call 1-800-CADAVER-DOG.

357
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:10,864
Bird feces.

358
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:15,357
Birds circling.

359
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:18,038
- You think there's a connection?
- Buzzards.

360
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:20,165
Body's not far.

361
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:22,736
It's probably
within about 300 yards.

362
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:25,360
Tony, we're going to find our body.

363
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,559
I can feel it.

364
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,549
I can smell it.

365
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:29,811
I can see it.

366
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:38,458
All right, you know what?
Call the dogs.

367
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:40,602
Call the trackers.
Call whoever you want.

368
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:42,688
I'm calling
the Rescue Response Team.

369
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,273
No one needs rescuing.

370
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:47,651
Well, how else are we going to get
that dead body up from down there?

371
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:58,370
You need to be more observant,
McGee.

372
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:02,204
Did you see <i>The Lion King</i>?

373
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:03,619
Mother loved it.

374
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,117
It's not Mozart or Verdi,
but it does have a certain...

375
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:08,695
charm nonetheless.

376
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,382
And you, dear boy, are a prime

377
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:13,903
example as to why the story
resonated with me.

378
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:16,639
The circle of life.

379
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:21,226
Well, in your death,
you fed several animals.

380
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:24,646
Yes, I think it's safe to say that
you made a mammal or two quite happy.

381
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,694
And a whole lot of others miserable.

382
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:29,401
Dylan Bates. 19.

383
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:30,802
Criminal record,

384
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:33,437
whole laundry list of complaints
filed against him.

385
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:35,239
Made a lot of enemies in 19 years.

386
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:36,545
Including himself.

387
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:40,238
Based upon the abuse
he inflicted upon his own body.

388
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:43,846
Vasoconstriction, precancerous spots
on his lungs,

389
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:46,675
scar tissue
at the antecubital fossa.

390
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:48,353
The tox screen will give us
specifics,

391
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:51,381
but I think it's safe to say
that whatever his chosen

392
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:54,134
poisons were,
he was smoking, drinking,

393
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:56,363
and shooting to excess.

394
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:57,769
- Not what killed him.
- No.

395
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:00,147
His attempt
to abuse himself to death

396
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,142
was interrupted by a single gunshot

397
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:03,991
- to the head.
- .38-caliber.

398
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:07,689
Consistent with the revolver
that your young lad found.

399
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,927
Abby has the bullet.

400
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:11,904
She also has the maggot larvae

401
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:14,367
- that McGee found at the crime scene.
- Time of death?

402
00:19:14,427 --> 00:19:16,428
Taking a liver temp was
out of the question.

403
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:18,652
- Too much time.
- Well, not enough liver.

404
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,609
I suspect coyotes.

405
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:23,660
You know, when I was a child,
I used to love liver.

406
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:26,140
Mother would cook
the liver of almost anything...

407
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:29,486
Well, that was her favorite.
I preferred calves' liver.

408
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,803
You know,
<i>alla Veneziana</i> with the onions...

409
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:33,782
- Time of death.
- Time of death. Time of death.

410
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:36,243
Two, possibly three weeks.

411
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:38,932
He was exposed to the elements
and animals too long

412
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:41,135
to determine
a more precise time of death.

413
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:45,922
I'll be able to narrow it down
to within a 24-hours period

414
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:48,810
when the larvae hatch into flies

415
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:54,642
Aren't they just
the cutest little things?

416
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:59,680
That's Bob, that's Norman,
that's George.

417
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,495
The wiggly one over here,
he's Butch.

418
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:04,149
And that is Charlie and Xavier.

419
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,737
They all boys?

420
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:08,709
Let's hope so.
Little girls can be such a pain.

421
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,205
Well, so can the big ones.

422
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,762
I have more bugs from McGee.

423
00:20:15,418 --> 00:20:16,873
You want to meet the beetles?

424
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:19,490
I am more interested in the slugs.

425
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:22,771
Like the one Ducky
pulled from Dylan Bates?

426
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:26,494
I haven't run
the ballistics yet, Gibbs.

427
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:27,730
I'm starting it now.

428
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,327
I've tested a lot of guns.

429
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:32,867
But there's something
wicked about this one. It's like...

430
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,725
- it's like possessed or something.
- Is something on fire?

431
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:38,572
No, I'm just burning sage
to take the hex off the gun.

432
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:39,977
It's got some bad mojo.

433
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:42,868
And I want to get rid of it
before the babies are born.

434
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:45,495
It's an evil gun, Gibbs.

435
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:49,041
This gun...
kills people.

436
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:51,773
I know what you're going to say.

437
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,995
Guns don't kill people,
people kill people.

438
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:55,305
But this gun...

439
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:56,673
it kills people.

440
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:00,635
I can find an H-waffle
double zigzag waffle.

441
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:03,293
I can find a double zigzag H-waffle
double zigzag,

442
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:06,048
but not a zigzag
double H-waffle zigzag.

443
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:08,570
I see a fish riding a unicorn.

444
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:11,623
Even worse, it's got
a tread like a mini-ATV

445
00:21:11,683 --> 00:21:13,446
but a wheelbase like a hand truck.

446
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,332
Still trying to get
those clubs, huh?

447
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:20,030
Yeah, well, every time I'm about
to close in on a set.

448
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,615
I end up getting interrupted.

449
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:26,196
Matching up tire impressions
from the crime scene, boss.

450
00:21:26,256 --> 00:21:28,413
Ziva, tough time at the pawnshop?

451
00:21:28,736 --> 00:21:29,790
I hit a stone wall.

452
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:30,916
Brick wall.

453
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:32,459
No, it was a stone wall.

454
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,752
I backed up too quickly.

455
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:36,222
I found the record of the sale.
The gun was sold to a...

456
00:21:36,282 --> 00:21:37,464
man by the name of...

457
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:38,636
Eddie Felson.

458
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:41,260
Fast Eddie Felson?

459
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,594
You know him?

460
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,930
Well, yeah.

461
00:21:45,184 --> 00:21:48,141
Former pool player forced
into retirement by gangsters.

462
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:50,560
He was a con man, he was a boozer.

463
00:21:52,495 --> 00:21:55,107
He was a character
Paul Newman played in <i>The Hustler</i>.

464
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:56,727
And his hair was perfect.

465
00:21:56,912 --> 00:22:00,585
Apparently, the gun was bought
by using a false identity.

466
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:02,281
Case files, Norfolk P.D.?

467
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:04,557
Two unsolved robberies.

468
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:06,156
Five suspects.

469
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,413
One,

470
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,784
duo,

471
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:12,874
tres, cuatro...

472
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:13,959
five.

473
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,044
Name does not match
any of our suspects.

474
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:18,975
No, but the face does.

475
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,230
Morning, Ronald. Ronnie.

476
00:22:23,753 --> 00:22:24,491
Ron.

477
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:25,721
Fast Eddie.

478
00:22:26,284 --> 00:22:27,682
Recognize this bad boy?

479
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:29,516
You should.

480
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:32,644
You bought it, then you used it once
at a Kwik Stop, then again

481
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:34,771
at an E-Z Mart.

482
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:37,274
Slugs you left
as souvenirs match the gun.

483
00:22:38,161 --> 00:22:39,803
Case loads must be light.

484
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:42,449
I didn't think you guys
bothered with small-time crooks.

485
00:22:42,756 --> 00:22:44,740
Only when they become
big-time murderers.

486
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,715
We found a slug from that same gun

487
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:51,570
in Dylan Bates.

488
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:57,293
Finally got what he deserved.

489
00:22:57,885 --> 00:22:58,795
Wasn't me.

490
00:22:59,023 --> 00:22:59,955
You knew him?

491
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,650
You couldn't drive through Norfolk
without knowing Dylan Bates.

492
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,718
The guy was like
a one-man menace to society.

493
00:23:05,274 --> 00:23:06,268
He menace you?

494
00:23:07,274 --> 00:23:09,419
He stole my car and my girlfriend.

495
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:11,767
Nice car?

496
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:18,406
That gives you a motive
and a murder weapon.

497
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:20,232
I wouldn't waste a bullet on Bates.

498
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:22,257
Okay, why don't you save it
for the jury?

499
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,557
I'm sure they'll be just as moved
by your touching story as we were.

500
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:27,365
Wait.

501
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:39,975
I hit those convenience stores,
okay?

502
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,924
But I'm not going down
for some murder that I didn't commit.

503
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:45,842
And we should believe you
because...?

504
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,223
Because I ditched
the gun a month ago.

505
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:52,390
Where?

506
00:23:53,372 --> 00:23:56,395
A dumpster behind a safeway
on West Franklin.

507
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:01,274
Hold on.
There's our Fast Eddie.

508
00:24:01,504 --> 00:24:04,027
Dates and time match up with
when he claims to have ditched the gun.

509
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:08,467
He may be tossing it right there.

510
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:11,785
Keep going.

511
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:17,457
Hold on.

512
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:21,545
Something got his attention.

513
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,766
Zoom it in.

514
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:27,551
Let's see what Chicken Man's up to.

515
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,513
Find Joey.

516
00:24:43,838 --> 00:24:44,942
Abs? Music?

517
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:46,039
I know.

518
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,655
I can barely stand it.

519
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:49,746
I can't focus,

520
00:24:49,806 --> 00:24:52,123
it's affecting my cognitive function,
I'm getting agitated.

521
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:54,369
It's not for me, it's for them.

522
00:24:54,815 --> 00:24:57,998
Playing classical music for babies
is supposed to increase

523
00:24:58,078 --> 00:25:00,348
their spatio-temporal reasoning and

524
00:25:00,543 --> 00:25:02,080
increase intelligence.

525
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:05,649
If I keep listening to this,

526
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,883
I'm going to turn
into a psycho killer.

527
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:18,226
Our killer?

528
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:23,815
The slug that Ducky pulled
from Dylan Bates' body

529
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:26,418
matches the gun, but...

530
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:29,196
the brain matter
on the tip of the gun

531
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:31,511
does not match Bates.

532
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:34,191
- Which means...
- There's a second victim.

533
00:25:34,591 --> 00:25:36,322
Gibbs, that gun...

534
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:38,587
it's bad news.

535
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:51,344
We've got a second victim.

536
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:53,660
DNA on the gun didn't match Bates.

537
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,890
I'll contact local LEOs. Maybe they
already found our missing murder victim.

538
00:25:56,971 --> 00:25:59,033
We talked to the manager
at the Chirping Chicken.

539
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:01,436
He wouldn't divulge
the secret recipe, but

540
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:03,476
he did identify our dumpster-diver.

541
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:05,231
Joseph K. Ellis,

542
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:06,816
a.k.a. Joey.

543
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,402
Hasn't shown up
for work for two weeks.

544
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,145
Joseph K. Ellis.

545
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:15,526
Navy brat. Spent the majority
of his childhood at Norfolk.

546
00:26:16,253 --> 00:26:19,204
Recently tried to enlist
in the Navy himself, but was denied.

547
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,248
And here's why.

548
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:22,624
Criminal record.

549
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,043
Charged with armed robbery
as a juvenile.

550
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,754
And he had an accomplice.

551
00:26:27,383 --> 00:26:28,296
Dylan Bates.

552
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,714
Our neighborhood bully.

553
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:31,169
Our bad penny.

554
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:33,161
Bring in Ellis.

555
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:40,222
That's it!

556
00:26:41,411 --> 00:26:42,519
Guys, I have...

557
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,067
got a match.

558
00:26:53,588 --> 00:26:54,684
So, what, McGee?

559
00:26:54,744 --> 00:26:57,574
Is there a... wagon derby in town?

560
00:26:58,022 --> 00:26:59,536
Abby, these aren't just any wagons.

561
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,705
These are Wagon-Boy
All-Terrain wagons.

562
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:04,207
Look at the size of those wheels.

563
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:06,584
Bigger isn't always better, McGee.

564
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:09,796
Those are cool tires.

565
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:10,719
Yeah!

566
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:11,923
You see the...

567
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,135
the zigzag double H waffle
zigzag tread on those tires?

568
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:17,220
It's a Wagon-Boy exclusive.

569
00:27:18,745 --> 00:27:20,821
McGee, you're like
a little kid on Christmas.

570
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:22,726
I canvassed
the base housing at Norfolk.

571
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,352
Collected as many as I could find.

572
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,813
Doesn't seem to be
any obvious signs of blood.

573
00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:29,566
Well, let's check
for the not so obvious.

574
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:31,022
Let's.

575
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:37,599
You know,
I always wanted one of these.

576
00:27:38,376 --> 00:27:39,728
What, you never had a wagon?

577
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:41,911
Nope.
We had a tortoise.

578
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:44,737
Okay.

579
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:47,292
We used to ride Herman everywhere.

580
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:49,419
Well, except
to Grammy Sciuto's house,

581
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:52,047
because he ate
her prize-winning petunias.

582
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:54,959
Dad always said that we could get
a wagon after Herman died.

583
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:56,524
But those tortoises...

584
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:58,511
they live, like, forever.

585
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,098
So...

586
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,026
whose wagon is it, McGee?

587
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:17,191
The one
who is not getting theirs back.

588
00:28:20,994 --> 00:28:22,336
He doesn't know I'm here?

589
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,490
No.

590
00:28:28,816 --> 00:28:29,834
Not thirsty.

591
00:28:30,035 --> 00:28:31,285
<i>Well, it's not for you.</i>

592
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:35,948
<i>Orange.</i>

593
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,094
You remember, Agent Gibbs.

594
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,881
<i>I remember what's important.</i>

595
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:47,773
You understand
you are not under arrest here.

596
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:50,320
This is just an interview.

597
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,942
You don't have to answer any questions.
Do you understand?

598
00:28:56,593 --> 00:28:57,379
Okay.

599
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,917
So, Noah,

600
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:07,499
do you know what forensics are?

601
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:10,583
Fingerprints and stuff.

602
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:15,270
Yeah, an example...

603
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,134
we found your fingerprints
on your wagon.

604
00:29:20,923 --> 00:29:22,058
It's no big deal.

605
00:29:22,472 --> 00:29:23,763
It's your wagon.

606
00:29:24,204 --> 00:29:25,439
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

607
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:28,518
Yeah, but we also
found some other stuff.

608
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:33,273
Found blood that matches
the body you found.

609
00:29:35,477 --> 00:29:36,717
<i>You know what that means?</i>

610
00:29:41,245 --> 00:29:43,158
Noah, it means you lied to me.

611
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,375
You remember at first when you didn't
tell me the truth about the body?

612
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:55,517
You remember how we found out?

613
00:29:58,305 --> 00:29:59,545
I will get the truth.

614
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:03,985
The thing is,

615
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:08,474
the longer it takes,
the farther away the killer gets.

616
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,397
Who are you trying to protect?

617
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:20,724
<i>- We're going to take a break here.
- No!?</i>

618
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:30,986
I killed him.
I did it.

619
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:32,392
<i>It was me.</i>

620
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:34,909
Why would you do that?

621
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,834
He picked on me and my friends.

622
00:30:39,065 --> 00:30:41,147
He beat us up, he stole our money.

623
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:45,127
- Somebody had to stand up to him!
- Where'd you get the gun?

624
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:48,033
- I found it.
- Where?

625
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:51,935
I don't remember.

626
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:54,632
Do you remember what Dylan said...

627
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,646
just before you shot him?

628
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,856
People always say something.

629
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:03,197
"Don't shoot!"

630
00:31:12,657 --> 00:31:13,815
What did Dylan say?

631
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,419
I don't remember.

632
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:24,578
I don't believe you.

633
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:28,344
You don't forget
something like that.

634
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:36,383
You must really love
whoever it is you're trying to protect.

635
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:42,263
But I can't help them
unless you tell me who it is.

636
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,011
He did it to protect me.

637
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:58,861
It... it was my dad.

638
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:03,078
My dad killed him.

639
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,719
Come on, baby!

640
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:18,958
Push!

641
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:21,981
That's right, come on.
Squeeze!

642
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:25,090
Ducky, it's happening.
Look!

643
00:32:28,658 --> 00:32:29,989
I think it's a boy.

644
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,177
The miracle of birth.

645
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,340
Okay...

646
00:32:38,952 --> 00:32:39,792
Gently.

647
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,460
Got him.

648
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:42,708
Okay.

649
00:32:44,252 --> 00:32:45,173
Hold "George".

650
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,123
Hello, George.

651
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,989
Their first baby pictures.

652
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:53,803
All right.
Smile.

653
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,128
- I am smiling.
- No, George.

654
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,157
I think it's a variety
of Calliphoridae.

655
00:33:05,186 --> 00:33:08,158
You might want to rename
George "Georgina".

656
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:10,349
Well, as long as they're healthy.

657
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,035
You're right, Ducky.

658
00:33:14,796 --> 00:33:15,626
Blow-fly.

659
00:33:16,846 --> 00:33:18,450
Phormia regina.

660
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:20,568
I like that.

661
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:25,001
Welcome to the world, Regina.

662
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:28,340
You did not care much
for Dylan Bates.

663
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:29,594
<i>Nobody did.</i>

664
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:31,045
<i>Kid was bad news.</i>

665
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:32,855
Your son says you killed him.

666
00:33:33,592 --> 00:33:35,572
He was so scared you'd be arrested,

667
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,767
he tried to cover up your crime.

668
00:33:38,302 --> 00:33:40,938
Yeah, when that didn't work,
he took credit for it.

669
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,860
<i>You're basing your investigation
on the word of a 12-year-old kid.</i>

670
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,838
He overheard you
threaten Dylan Bates.

671
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:50,528
Two weeks before
he was found murdered.

672
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:54,538
"You touch a hair on my son,
I will hunt you down and kill you."

673
00:33:55,277 --> 00:33:56,716
Strong words.

674
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,304
<i>Yeah, okay. So,</i>

675
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,249
<i>I threatened him, yeah.</i>

676
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:03,265
You're a man of your word, Mike?

677
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,044
Noah thinks you are.

678
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,282
He thinks you'll protect him.

679
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,693
Whatever it takes.

680
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:13,010
<i>You don't know what it's like.</i>

681
00:34:13,874 --> 00:34:16,388
<i>Going off to the other side
of the world to protect your country.</i>

682
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,264
<i>But then you can't be there
to protect your own family.</i>

683
00:34:21,136 --> 00:34:23,832
You want to protect your family?
You tell the truth.

684
00:34:25,426 --> 00:34:26,467
Did you kill him?

685
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,327
<i>He was a bully.
He had it coming.</i>

686
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,644
<i>But I didn't do it.</i>

687
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:34,924
Why'd you leave town so quick?

688
00:34:37,051 --> 00:34:38,329
<i>Scheduled to deploy.</i>

689
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:42,549
No, you were scheduled
to deploy in May.

690
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:45,245
You requested an earlier deployment.
Why?

691
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:51,343
<i>Family needed the money, okay?</i>

692
00:34:52,863 --> 00:34:54,977
<i>So, I moved up
to take a Haz-Duty slot.</i>

693
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:57,267
Prison's pretty hazardous,
too, Mike.

694
00:34:57,904 --> 00:34:59,502
You know, if I killed somebody,

695
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,350
I'd want to get as far away
from the investigation as I could.

696
00:35:02,457 --> 00:35:04,186
You got pretty far, pretty fast.

697
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,083
You stand by, Commander.

698
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:13,366
They've hatched.

699
00:35:13,426 --> 00:35:16,272
We were able to tabulate
the post-mortem time interval.

700
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:19,319
Bates was shot
and killed 15 days ago.

701
00:35:19,955 --> 00:35:23,389
Yeah, well, that's three days after
Commander Taffet deployed to Iraq.

702
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:26,650
I'm afraid you'll have to hatch a new
theory as to who killed Dylan Bates.

703
00:35:31,947 --> 00:35:34,582
Hey, Boss. No luck tracking down
Chicken Man.

704
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:39,167
Joey Ellis, the dumpster diver.

705
00:35:39,793 --> 00:35:42,467
- Not answering his cell phone.
- And no one's at his apartment.

706
00:35:42,782 --> 00:35:45,413
Waiting on a warrant,
but the car's nowhere to be found.

707
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:47,534
Coworkers have not seen him
in two weeks.

708
00:35:47,594 --> 00:35:50,591
Looks like he murdered Dylan Bates
and someone else, and then skipped town.

709
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:52,489
Just spoke with Ellis' mother.

710
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:56,317
She's got a house on base but has been
deployed overseas in Yokohama.

711
00:35:56,378 --> 00:35:58,486
Hasn't spoken to her son
in nearly a month.

712
00:35:58,548 --> 00:35:59,260
Father?

713
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,153
Died in combat
when Ellis was a child.

714
00:36:01,217 --> 00:36:03,526
- Second victim, McGee?
- Checked with Norfolk P.D.

715
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:06,438
No unsolved murders with victims shot
in the head in the last month.

716
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:10,399
I've also tried to match the DNA taken
from the brain matter

717
00:36:10,473 --> 00:36:13,472
found on the gun with DNA collected
for missing persons.

718
00:36:13,532 --> 00:36:15,831
- Long shot.
- Yeah, could take a couple weeks.

719
00:36:16,227 --> 00:36:17,992
Dig deeper into Ellis' history.

720
00:36:18,697 --> 00:36:20,785
Until otherwise, he's our primary.

721
00:36:21,837 --> 00:36:24,660
A local base resident gave us this.

722
00:36:26,891 --> 00:36:29,244
Bates and Ellis obviously knew
each other for years

723
00:36:29,304 --> 00:36:31,177
before something came between them.

724
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,521
Hey, boss?
Found something here.

725
00:36:34,316 --> 00:36:36,841
Joey's mother has been deployed
for the past three months,

726
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:38,464
but according to her phone records,

727
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:42,177
there were outgoing calls made from her
house as recently as a couple weeks ago.

728
00:36:44,432 --> 00:36:45,510
Norfolk, go.

729
00:37:01,716 --> 00:37:03,514
Come on, Scout boy. You're with me.

730
00:37:18,993 --> 00:37:20,287
You smell what I smell?

731
00:37:27,323 --> 00:37:30,333
I'm sorry, you can't talk to him.
He's upset. He's had enough.

732
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,700
We're not here to see Noah.

733
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,722
Is your daughter Rebecca home?

734
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:56,149
Clear.

735
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:19,033
Found Joey Ellis, boss.

736
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:22,697
Looks and smells
like he's been dead for a while.

737
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,211
Gunshot, left temple.

738
00:38:26,196 --> 00:38:27,556
Yeah, how'd you know that?

739
00:38:28,094 --> 00:38:29,642
Yearbook, he's a southpaw.

740
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,060
What difference does that make
if he was murdered?

741
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,179
Not murder.

742
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,022
Suicide.

743
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:40,561
There's no gun here, boss.

744
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:42,473
Didn't expect one.

745
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:51,163
You got something you want
to tell me about Joey Ellis?

746
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,160
Joey Ellis?

747
00:38:57,618 --> 00:38:59,145
Yeah, he's dead.

748
00:39:03,095 --> 00:39:04,195
Joey's dead?

749
00:39:06,683 --> 00:39:09,133
You found his body
after he killed himself?

750
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,455
He was my best friend.

751
00:39:17,366 --> 00:39:19,107
Dylan tortured Joey all his life.

752
00:39:20,737 --> 00:39:22,278
Got him into drugs,

753
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,363
convinced him
to commit that robbery.

754
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:27,052
He didn't even want to do it.

755
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:28,822
So stupid.

756
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:32,550
That's what prevented Joey
from getting into the Navy.

757
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,178
Dylan ruined Joey's life
and threw it back in his face.

758
00:39:39,162 --> 00:39:41,823
Taunted him about it.
Made fun of him every day.

759
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:44,482
Joey couldn't take it anymore.

760
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:47,539
I tried to talk to him about it,
but he couldn't see a way out.

761
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,158
You blame Dylan for Joey's suicide?

762
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,237
So you took the gun,
decided to do...

763
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:14,046
what Joey couldn't bring
himself to do.

764
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,479
- You killed Dylan Bates.
- No.

765
00:40:16,938 --> 00:40:19,077
I just wanted him to know
what he had done.

766
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:20,771
I wanted to show him.

767
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:23,581
This is the gun
Joey used to kill himself.

768
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,800
He tried to grab it.

769
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:27,664
It just went off.

770
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:31,828
I'm so sorry, Mommy.

771
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:35,910
Oh, honey...

772
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:45,432
Why is it always the case that
when two people struggle over a gun,

773
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:47,368
one person never shoots the other?

774
00:40:47,521 --> 00:40:50,343
The gun miraculously just goes off?

775
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,575
Abby said, it was an evil gun.

776
00:40:53,945 --> 00:40:56,390
Legal said Rebecca Taffet's got
a pretty strong case

777
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,989
for involuntary manslaughter.

778
00:40:58,246 --> 00:40:59,750
Yeah, she'll need a good lawyer.

779
00:40:59,812 --> 00:41:02,554
It's taken care of.
Travis' mother is gonna represent her.

780
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:04,537
Was she the mom you were hot for?

781
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:10,553
In a sec.
Securely hidden in the shadows,

782
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:13,993
the cunning marksman waits patiently
for the perfect time to strike.

783
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,109
You are looking at the proud owner

784
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,610
of a vintage set

785
00:41:27,061 --> 00:41:30,642
of Robert Forgan handcrafted
mint condition golf clubs.

786
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,910
That's impossible.

787
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,419
No, nothing is impossible.

788
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,162
I'm a sniper.

789
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:37,888
Same exact set Ducky had?

790
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,481
1,200 for the clubs.

791
00:41:40,308 --> 00:41:42,596
Let's say a 100-dollar
finder's fee, McGee.

792
00:41:43,972 --> 00:41:45,389
Except Ducky's a righty.

793
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,422
These are left-handed clubs, Tony.

794
00:41:51,694 --> 00:41:53,262
You just wasted 1,200 bucks.

795
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:00,018
Maybe Ducky swings both ways?

796
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:03,231
A thousand bucks, and they're yours.

797
00:42:03,392 --> 00:42:06,563
Why would I buy a set of clubs
that Ducky could not use?

798
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,690
Why?

799
00:42:07,852 --> 00:42:11,113
Gee, let me think. I don't know,
maybe because if you don't buy them,

800
00:42:11,173 --> 00:42:13,782
I will tell Ducky that you destroyed
his one-of-a-kind,

801
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:16,955
handcrafted hickory-shafted,
vintage golf clubs.

802
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:18,714
I think you just did.

803
00:42:27,606 --> 00:42:29,728
Let's call it even, Timothy.

804
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:31,809
That...

805
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:35,222
jazz guitar album
that I borrowed from you?

806
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:39,307
My original vinyl pressing
of Django Reinhardt's Crazy Rhythm?

807
00:42:39,394 --> 00:42:40,832
Yeah, you were right.

808
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,090
It was unique, it was original.

809
00:42:44,276 --> 00:42:45,569
It was autographed.

810
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:47,315
What happened to it?

811
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,347
Good question.
