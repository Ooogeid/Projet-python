00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:12,429
Sir,

3
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:14,682
- you find your friend?
- Yes, I did, thanks.

4
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:50,385
- Checking out.
- Name, sir?

5
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:53,269
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

6
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:57,934
NCIS Season 6 Episode 16

www.Team-NCIS.com

10
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:31,826
Good morning, Tony.

11
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:36,887
No.

12
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,095
I haven't seen
that bad boy in a while.

13
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:40,393
You had a rough night?

14
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:44,935
- Yes.
- Yes, the people from Tokyo.

15
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,995
A few of our counterparts
were visiting from Japan.

16
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:50,487
Director Vance had
Tony show them around.

17
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:51,858
Sake bombs.

18
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:53,558
I see.

19
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:55,715
I barely made it out of there alive.

20
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,539
And now you hope to finish the job.

21
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,746
McGee, say words.

22
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,209
What you see before you, Ziva,
is the "DiNozzo Defibrillator".

23
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:07,064
It's been passed down
through six generations.

24
00:02:07,124 --> 00:02:09,359
My family also has
a hangover remedy...

25
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:11,370
jasmine tea with lime.

26
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,383
That's disgusting.

27
00:02:13,924 --> 00:02:16,100
Remind me never to have
a hangover in Israel.

28
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,251
Not that I have
a hangover now, boss.

29
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:21,185
You know I would never drink
on a school night.

30
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:23,770
- Where were you last night?
- Drinking.

31
00:02:24,175 --> 00:02:26,105
- You alone?
- Of course not.

32
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:29,739
Not that there's anything wrong

33
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:32,403
with drinking bourbon alone
in your basement... with a boat.

34
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:36,589
What were we talking about?

35
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,800
Your alibi.

36
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,705
My alibi?
For what?

37
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:46,359
Who would want to impersonate Tony?

38
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:48,418
Perhaps Jack Nicholson.

39
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,921
You know, impersonation revenge.

40
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:54,368
Or it's a frame-up.

41
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:55,552
Jeanne Benoit?

42
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:59,264
Overseas.
Maybe it was Trent Kort.

43
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:01,015
Are you detecting a trend here?

44
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,934
Tony does have a way with people.

45
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:06,312
The seam split.

46
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:07,744
I can't believe it.

47
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:15,711
I know.
Discarded like a piece of trash.

48
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:17,323
No, I meant the duffel bag.

49
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:18,908
I just bought the same one.

50
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:22,130
Should have listened to the reviews.
They said the seams were a problem.

51
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,079
McGee, the man is folded in half.

52
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,103
I know.

53
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:28,160
No, that... it...
that's, you know, a shame, too.

54
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:31,671
Maybe I've been doing this too long.

55
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:42,629
Well, that's my name. It's not
my signature, but that's my name.

56
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:44,224
And to think,

57
00:03:44,284 --> 00:03:47,562
I almost made it an entire year
without being accused of murder.

58
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:49,521
The guy did look a lot like you.

59
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:51,149
Not helping.

60
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:53,192
Was a little more fit, though.

61
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,112
- We're gonna need...
- Security tapes.

62
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:58,491
- And...
- Key to Room 742. Here you go.

63
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,883
- In a bit of a rush?
- Actually, yes.

64
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:03,548
I'd like to move this off the floor.

65
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,828
The Rosewood has
a reputation to uphold.

66
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:07,739
If there's anything else you need,

67
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,083
please let me know.

68
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:11,691
Yeah. We will.

69
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:14,843
Come on.

70
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,578
Funny, when I woke up
this morning, those...

71
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:20,572
last four shots seemed
like a bad idea.

72
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:23,060
Don't need an alibi with me,
DiNozzo.

73
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:26,643
- I'm glad you got one, though.
- Makes two of us.

74
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,227
Haven't seen anything quite
like this since...

75
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,860
Vegas, '99.

76
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:33,223
<i>Cirque du Soleil.</i>

77
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:36,514
Mother and I caught
two shows in one evening.

78
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:39,404
She's an admirer, to say the least.

79
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:41,701
- Aren't we all?
- Not like my mother.

80
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,055
She had an infatuation
for one of the tumblers

81
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:46,258
for quite some time.

82
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:47,618
Marc or Ignacio?

83
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:53,044
Yeah, I've followed Ignacio's
career for some time, and...

84
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:55,253
Why don't you quit
while you're behind, Palmer?

85
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,385
Quitting, sir.
I will go get the gurney.

86
00:04:57,445 --> 00:04:58,967
Victim's Lieutenant Justin Grady.

87
00:04:59,193 --> 00:05:01,487
Works out
of the Department of Defense.

88
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,420
Grady?!

89
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:03,805
You know him?

90
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:05,515
Sounds familiar.

91
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:08,184
Now that you mention it,
he kind of looks familiar.

92
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,479
- What did he do?
- Currently stationed as

93
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,482
an Adjunct Supervisor
in DoD's International Mail Gateway.

94
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:16,693
So he's a mailman?

95
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:18,031
Was a mailman.

96
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:21,989
- You got a cause of death, Duck?
- This cyanosis indicates...

97
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,981
lack of oxygen. That, combined
with this ligature mark...

98
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,164
- Strangled?
- Yeah. With a wire or a cord.

99
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,620
And then...

100
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:34,460
to finish him off,
they stabbed him through the heart.

101
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:38,131
Preliminary measurement shows
a three to four inch blade.

102
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,215
Nothing in the alley.

103
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:41,526
Room is clear, too.

104
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:43,477
Well, you would know.
It is your room.

105
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:46,305
Way to kick a man when he's down,
McBackstabber.

106
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,010
Ziva, witnesses?

107
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:51,728
Two. A maid and a businessman
who was rather inebriated.

108
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:54,480
They both got clear looks
at the occupant of the room.

109
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:56,722
Matches Tony's description.

110
00:05:56,947 --> 00:05:57,950
Okay, that's it.

111
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,119
I'm out of here.

112
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:02,958
Maybe we should go easy on him.

113
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:04,995
Think he'd go easy on us?

114
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:07,122
Excellent point.

115
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,099
Remember me?

116
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,772
Renny Grant.

117
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:31,190
Civilian.
Worked out of the Pentagon.

118
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,139
My first collar as boss,
three years ago,

119
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,063
when you took
your Mexican sabbatical.

120
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:38,499
Intermission?

121
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:40,576
It was a <i>hiatus</i> really.

122
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:41,913
Embezzlement.

123
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:43,171
Right.

124
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:47,617
Renny was accused of stealing
over a million bucks

125
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:51,245
from a Navy credit union.
Got a witness to testify against him.

126
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:52,997
Open-and-shut case.

127
00:06:58,221 --> 00:06:59,121
Sort of.

128
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:02,277
- Well, the only thing is, we never...
- Found the money.

129
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:04,092
Not so open and shut.

130
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,329
- Not really.
- No.

131
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,557
That happens sometimes.

132
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:10,906
To the rest of us.

133
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:14,644
Judge sentenced Renny to five years.

134
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:17,063
Got supervised release
three months ago.

135
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:19,690
And that coworker who testified...

136
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:21,510
Lieutenant Justin Grady.

137
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,153
- Yeah.
- Our dead guy.

138
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:26,322
Well, nothing like a good revenge
killing to kick off the week.

139
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:32,838
You miss me, Ren?
Is that it?

140
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:34,511
Just couldn't stay away?

141
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:36,076
Missed a lot of things.

142
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:37,291
My family...

143
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:38,601
my girl...

144
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:40,837
a nice prime rib Madeira.

145
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,286
You, not so much.

146
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:45,299
Yeah.
Well, here you are.

147
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,011
And nothing's changed,
except for the gray hair.

148
00:07:49,714 --> 00:07:50,930
Show a little respect.

149
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:52,431
His name's Special Agent Gibbs.

150
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:54,976
Actually, I was talking about you.

151
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:57,145
I think I see a few sprouting.

152
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,228
I got a few gray hairs myself.

153
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:00,481
Three years.

154
00:08:01,434 --> 00:08:02,543
It's a long time.

155
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:05,838
Of course, in an eight-by-ten cell,
feels more like 30.

156
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:07,893
That why you killed the guy
who put you there?

157
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:10,396
- Looking for payback?
- I didn't kill anybody.

158
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:14,230
So, Lieutenant Grady stuffed himself
into a duffel bag.

159
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,985
I want to talk to Agent DiNozzo.

160
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:18,242
Alone.

161
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:21,711
Doesn't work that way.

162
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,427
I came to you.

163
00:08:23,994 --> 00:08:25,341
And I didn't have to.

164
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:28,897
Coffee.

165
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:33,139
Coffee machine in
the next room there?

166
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:35,433
He's gone. Talk.

167
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,310
- I'm innocent.
- You said that.

168
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,931
Of the embezzlement charges.

169
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,908
- You said that, too.
- I can prove it.

170
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:42,980
I'm more interested
in why the star witness

171
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,266
from your case showed up
in your duffel bag.

172
00:08:47,298 --> 00:08:48,718
He wouldn't fit in my Samsonite.

173
00:08:49,118 --> 00:08:51,215
Keep it up.
Juries love a smart-ass.

174
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:53,242
But of course,
you must remember that.

175
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,573
I didn't kill Lieutenant Grady.

176
00:08:58,419 --> 00:08:59,832
I just wanted to talk to him.

177
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:01,584
Really? About what?

178
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:03,760
We were friends,

179
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:05,637
and he testified against me.

180
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:07,797
I had to find out why.

181
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:10,964
Grady wouldn't see me,

182
00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:13,107
but I knew he'd agree
to see Agent DiNozzo,

183
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,805
lead investigator on the case.

184
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:17,466
So I set up a meeting
at the Rosewood.

185
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,416
I checked in early,

186
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,110
went out to eat...

187
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:25,024
and when I got back,
Grady was dead on my floor.

188
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:27,909
I don't know what happened.
I swear to God.

189
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,153
I panicked.

190
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:32,198
I hid the body and got the hell
out of there. I screwed up.

191
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:33,908
That's why I'm here.

192
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,744
You know, the last time
you told a story that thin,

193
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:39,142
the judge sentenced you
to five years for embezzlement.

194
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,595
Yeah.
I remember.

195
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:44,487
Too bad I didn't have this.

196
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:48,522
What's that, a good luck charm?

197
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:52,051
It's a USB drive with a paper trail
that proves I was innocent.

198
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:55,012
Took me three years
to dig it all up.

199
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:57,122
Thanks to you, I had the time.

200
00:09:57,457 --> 00:09:59,809
The appeals court
won't even look at it.

201
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:02,270
I figured you might be able
to help me.

202
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:04,198
It is the least you can do.

203
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:05,940
Well,

204
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:09,034
I'll see if I can get around to it.
I don't know if you've heard,

205
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:11,028
but I am in the middle
of a murder investigation.

206
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:16,802
Don't believe a word he says.

207
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:18,517
We got motive.
We got opportunity.

208
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:21,455
I know. Why'd he come back?

209
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:23,503
That's a good question, boss.

210
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:24,934
Boss?

211
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:28,081
Was your case, wasn't it?

212
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:31,841
Yeah.

213
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:36,178
You're not going back to Mexico,
are you?

214
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:38,546
Your case, you're lead.

215
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:41,161
- Really?
- Yeah.

216
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:42,935
I think it's even a rule.

217
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:46,688
There.

218
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:49,899
All right, zooming in.

219
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:52,319
That's Renny Grant.

220
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:55,191
But he didn't check out of the hotel
till three hours later.

221
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:56,866
So, where is he going?

222
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:57,810
Dinner.

223
00:10:58,318 --> 00:10:59,530
Or so he says.

224
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:01,370
- What have we got?
- Our suspect.

225
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,476
All over Rosewood's
surveillance video.

226
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:05,791
- But no sign yet of our victim.
- Keep looking.

227
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:08,200
What?

228
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:11,172
Victim's background.
Credit cards, bank statements.

229
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:15,343
Take a look at Renny's appeal.
Use it to catch yourself up

230
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,969
on the original embezzlement case,
then work with McGee.

231
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:20,884
On it, boss.

232
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:24,560
Are you going back to Mexico?

233
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:25,852
No.

234
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,855
Rule number 38.

235
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:32,902
Yeah. Gibbs.

236
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:39,391
Yeah.

237
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:41,452
On my way, Abs.

238
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:47,792
Caf-POW!
Right.

239
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:54,118
Talk to me, Abs.

240
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:55,220
Here you go.

241
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,644
Thank you, Gibbs.

242
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:01,806
I was just examining the evidence
from the murder scene, Gibbs.

243
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,822
The room was luckily really clean,
because, you know,

244
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:09,271
hotel rooms, they can be a forensic
scientist's biggest nightmare, Gibbs.

245
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:11,690
I'm not Gibbs.

246
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,633
Yes, you are. Because,
if you're not, there's a problem.

247
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:19,550
And after Sister Rosita spraining
her ankle in the sixth frame

248
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,367
and Mr. Giggles escaping...

249
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,493
- Mr. Giggles?
- Stay on topic, Gibbs.

250
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:24,817
Not Gibbs.

251
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:27,289
Tell me. I can take it.

252
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,792
- Well, he's just upstairs...
- Wait.

253
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:32,219
I can't.

254
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:33,593
Rule 38.

255
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:40,051
So, I processed the evidence
from the crime scene...

256
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:42,888
Tony... and nothing contradicts
your initial assessment.

257
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:45,693
Lieutenant Grady entered Renny's room.
There was a short struggle.

258
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:47,337
- Broken lamp.
- During the scuffle,

259
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:49,422
- they fell onto the bed.
- Bloody pillow.

260
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:52,637
Where Lieutenant Grady was strangled
and stabbed to death.

261
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:55,192
I found Grady's blood
on the comforter.

262
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,194
I don't want to tell you
what else I found.

263
00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:58,863
Yeah, you do.

264
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,615
You know me so well.
But that's gonna have to wait for later,

265
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:04,160
because I am cooking up
some awesomeness.

266
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:05,435
Awesome me.

267
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,164
I ran the swabs
that you took from the sink,

268
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,750
and I found traces of sodium tallowate,
water and fragrance.

269
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:14,985
Soap!

270
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:16,547
Gibbs would have known that.

271
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:17,704
Right.

272
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:20,340
I can also tell
by the chemical decomposition

273
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,595
that the sink was used
after Grady was murdered.

274
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:24,798
Killer washed his hands.

275
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:26,585
And...

276
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:29,446
left a partial fingerprint.

277
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:33,746
It's degraded by the soap,
so I can't run it through any databases,

278
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:36,748
but I should be able to pull enough
from it to incriminate a suspect.

279
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:39,616
Well, we got one of those. Let me know
as soon as you're done. Now...

280
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,975
who is Mr. Giggles?

281
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:45,534
Back to work!

282
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:49,896
I hope I don't have
to train him all over again.

283
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,678
So Tony is in charge again.

284
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:54,898
Yes.

285
00:13:56,306 --> 00:13:57,635
How do you feel about it?

286
00:13:58,386 --> 00:14:01,453
Tony is a competent,
capable investigator and...

287
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:02,927
a good leader.

288
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:06,557
You do not agree?

289
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:07,923
No, I agree.

290
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:09,058
It's just...

291
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,353
he's kind of irritating
when he's not the boss.

292
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:16,731
When he is, he walks around
with that peacock strut, that smirk.

293
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:18,526
It's like...

294
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:21,984
He's behind me, isn't he?

295
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:23,339
Smirking.

296
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:26,954
That's good timing, how long
were you waiting?

297
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:28,114
Two minutes.

298
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:29,768
Any luck
with the surveillance video?

299
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:33,541
I finally found our victim, Lieutenant
Grady. He entered through a...

300
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,356
- Service entrance.
- Yes.

301
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,205
Nearly two hours
before he was killed.

302
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:38,921
I spoke again to the floor maid

303
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:40,838
and she admits letting him
into Renny's room.

304
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,466
Claimed he lost his key?

305
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,677
McGee, stroke my plumage.

306
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,932
Well, nothing unusual
in Lieutenant Grady's bank statements,

307
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:51,976
but I did find a sealed file
in his records.

308
00:14:52,574 --> 00:14:54,750
Well, some of his testimony
in Renny's embezzlement case

309
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,313
did involve classified information.

310
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,941
Just to be sure,
I'm petitioning the judge for access.

311
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:00,776
Nice work, team.

312
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,272
- I'm proud of you.
- We're sitting pretty.

313
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,859
Pretty as a...

314
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,658
Peacock?

315
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:09,587
Hey, boss.

316
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:11,904
Jethro.

317
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,394
Did you catch up
on Renny's embezzlement case?

318
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,222
Yes.

319
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,294
- And I went through his appeal.
- Let me guess.

320
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:20,508
Wasted three years of his life.

321
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:21,589
No, you did.

322
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:24,079
Kid was innocent.

323
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:37,062
The original case
hinged on computer logs.

324
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:40,204
Showed Renny embezzling
from a base credit union.

325
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:41,930
First National.

326
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:44,822
Using the latest
open source forensic software,

327
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:48,270
Renny dug up evidence
that those logs were falsified.

328
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,326
But it turns out Renny wasn't even in
the country when the money was stolen.

329
00:15:52,238 --> 00:15:53,046
Where?

330
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:54,657
Iraq.

331
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:57,333
Since the computer Renny supposedly

332
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,340
did the embezzling
with was on base...

333
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,024
I get it, McGee.
The guy didn't do it.

334
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:04,089
He raises bunnies and grew rainbows,
and I put him in prison.

335
00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:07,801
Come on.

336
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,637
Think.

337
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:11,280
Campfire.

338
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:20,968
Huddle up.

339
00:16:24,407 --> 00:16:25,194
Thank you.

340
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:30,625
Okay...

341
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,368
Renny didn't steal the money.

342
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,560
That's my bad.

343
00:16:34,897 --> 00:16:36,747
But it doesn't let him off the hook

344
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:38,123
killing Lieutenant Grady.

345
00:16:38,353 --> 00:16:39,343
Not at all.

346
00:16:39,403 --> 00:16:41,335
It was Grady's testimony
that put him away.

347
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:42,795
False testimony.

348
00:16:43,056 --> 00:16:44,358
Insult to injury.

349
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,050
So, if anything, Renny's motive
for murder just got stronger.

350
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:50,427
What is our dead guy's motive?

351
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,989
Lied on the witness
stand three years ago.

352
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,138
Why?

353
00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:55,683
Maybe he was the real embezzler.

354
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,351
Used Renny as his fall guy.

355
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:58,746
Sounds like a theory.

356
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,511
Now we just need to prove it.

357
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:09,005
- Yes?
<i>- Jethro, come down a moment.</i>

358
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:10,598
- Hey, Ducky.
- <i>Tony?</i>

359
00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:12,032
Yeah, I'll be right down.

360
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:16,912
Keep it.

361
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:22,710
Ziva, I want all the transcripts
from Renny's embezzlement trial.

362
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,836
McGee, interviews.

363
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,163
If he worked with him,
you're talking to him.

364
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:35,347
Good campfire.

365
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:40,168
Congratulations
on your promotion, Anthony,

366
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:42,271
fleeting as it may be.

367
00:17:42,618 --> 00:17:43,634
Thanks, Ducky.

368
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:48,409
Actually, I'm... off to a rough start.
Hope you got something good for me.

369
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:51,862
Yes, well, I found some anomalies
on Lieutenant Grady's body.

370
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:55,701
First, note this pernicious rash
on his lower extremities.

371
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:56,567
Lovely.

372
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:59,872
It continues up his back,
erupting into blisters.

373
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:01,957
Some nasty blisters.

374
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,969
I have a sample for you to see,
if you like.

375
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:06,466
I'll take your word for it.

376
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:08,395
Agent Gibbs...

377
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:12,301
never passes up the opportunity
of enjoying the fruits of my labor.

378
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:21,864
Yeah, his X-rays showed...

379
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:24,913
nodules on both
his upper and lower lobes.

380
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:28,436
At first, I thought they might be
cancerous lesions, but...

381
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:30,219
combined with the rash...

382
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,429
Valley fever.

383
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,971
Very good, Anthony.

384
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,574
- How did you know...
- Long story.

385
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:38,269
Let's just say I'm not going back
to Arizona anytime soon.

386
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:41,872
Yes, I feel the same way
about Stronachlachar.

387
00:18:42,072 --> 00:18:43,457
As you are no doubt aware,

388
00:18:43,713 --> 00:18:45,012
valley fever...

389
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:47,810
is native to the southwest
of the United States.

390
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,756
The lieutenant must have spent
some time there, and recently.

391
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:52,424
Thanks, Ducky.

392
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:55,016
That's not
why I called you down here.

393
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:57,774
Valley fever is aptly named.

394
00:18:58,022 --> 00:18:59,297
Lieutenant Grady...

395
00:18:59,357 --> 00:19:02,835
would have had a slight fever
when he died... most assuredly...

396
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:05,813
which would alter
my initial time of death.

397
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,980
By how much?

398
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,084
Two hours prior.

399
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:12,152
That would put time of death
around 8:30 pm?

400
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:13,570
Is that a problem?

401
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,114
Yeah, it is,

402
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:18,033
because Renny Grant
was having dinner at 8:30 pm,

403
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,561
and I've got a dozen witnesses
to prove it.

404
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:23,288
Then your murder suspect
is no longer a suspect.

405
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:34,383
Give us a minute.

406
00:19:40,364 --> 00:19:41,390
I am sorry.

407
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:43,958
Just so I'm straight,
what's that for?

408
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:46,301
Putting me in prison...

409
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:48,605
or accusing me of murder?

410
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:49,574
Prison.

411
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,977
I think we're even
on the murder thing.

412
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:53,902
You did drop a body
down a trash chute.

413
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:57,057
Good thing my probation's up.

414
00:19:57,617 --> 00:20:00,267
What am I looking at anyway
for tampering with a crime scene?

415
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:02,895
Well, it's gonna be up to the judge.
If you're lucky,

416
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,498
time served.

417
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,998
And my appeal?

418
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:12,253
- I'll write you a letter.
- Better be a hell of a letter.

419
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:18,705
I promise it will be.

420
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:22,236
Who set you up, Renny?

421
00:20:22,296 --> 00:20:24,141
Can you prove
that it was Lieutenant Grady?

422
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:27,300
Already proved I didn't do it.

423
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,557
And now you expect me
to find the guy who did.

424
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:33,245
What exactly are you gonna do?

425
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:36,852
- Renny.
- Yeah, yeah.

426
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:37,991
Don't leave town.

427
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:39,320
I know the drill.

428
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,231
- <i>You answered the wrong phone?</i>
- What, McGee?

429
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,981
<i>- Wilkins is here. </i>
- Tell him you handle the interviews.

430
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,393
<i>Well, he asked for you.</i>

431
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:02,155
Do I have to do everything?
All right, I'll be right up.

432
00:21:07,732 --> 00:21:08,810
Told you so.

433
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:13,398
I've been waiting
three years to say that.

434
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:17,109
How's life in the Pentagon, Mitch?

435
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,193
You pulled the Shawshank.

436
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:21,044
You put the wrong guy away.

437
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:23,992
We put the wrong guy away.
As I recall, you were his supervisor.

438
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:26,346
Hey, I just discovered
the money was missing.

439
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:29,231
Told you from the beginning
Renny was framed.

440
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,212
He didn't have
the computer skills...

441
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:34,199
He does now.

442
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:37,547
Worked on his appeal in the can.

443
00:21:38,837 --> 00:21:40,028
How's Ziva?

444
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:41,928
Ziva?

445
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:45,764
Why?

446
00:21:45,844 --> 00:21:47,432
I haven't seen her in a while.

447
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,770
Three years.

448
00:21:50,023 --> 00:21:52,494
- Yeah, right, of course.
- Closer to two.

449
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:54,856
When she added me
as a friend on Facebook.

450
00:21:54,936 --> 00:21:56,160
Ziva's on Facebook?

451
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:59,444
You ever see her knife collection?
Hurrah!

452
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:02,823
You've been to her place?

453
00:22:03,097 --> 00:22:04,449
It was a double-team.

454
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,542
The embezzlement.

455
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:10,080
Never could figure how it was done.

456
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:11,527
Looks like Renny did.

457
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:14,375
Access logs were faked.

458
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:17,295
And with our security systems,
that's no easy task.

459
00:22:17,982 --> 00:22:19,734
Would have needed
at least two people...

460
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:22,676
one to open the server port,
the other to falsify the logs.

461
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:24,553
Lieutenant Grady had a partner.

462
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:26,722
Had to be someone in-house.

463
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,182
Which rules Renny out... again.

464
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,701
It's a big list.

465
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:34,104
Our department employs
over 2,000 people.

466
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,185
It is a lot of work,
isn't it, Mitch?

467
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:38,908
I'm gonna need the updated addresses
and contact info.

468
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:39,956
Thanks.

469
00:22:40,143 --> 00:22:41,111
You got it.

470
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:42,738
Tell Ziva I'll poke her.

471
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,498
You know...

472
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:46,825
Facebook.

473
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:55,709
- What are you doing?
- I'm waiting for you.

474
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,835
You're late.

475
00:22:56,915 --> 00:22:58,086
You got something?

476
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,838
I had something four minutes ago.

477
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,466
- Why didn't you call?
- Because that's not how it works.

478
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:05,305
When I find something, Gibbs
immediately walks through the door.

479
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:07,054
Have you forgotten
all of your training?

480
00:23:07,488 --> 00:23:09,208
I remembered your Caf-POW!

481
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:13,894
Horse shoes and hand grenades,
DiNozzo.

482
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:21,127
Now that that's settled,

483
00:23:21,187 --> 00:23:24,019
I lifted our partial fingerprint
from the soap dispenser.

484
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:26,573
It's still not enough to get a match
from a database, but it is

485
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:29,291
definitely enough to incriminate someone
if we have a suspect...

486
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:31,263
Suspect, I know.
Got a list of 'em.

487
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:33,452
2,000 of Renny's former coworkers.

488
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,702
Check your inbox.

489
00:23:41,469 --> 00:23:42,339
Got it.

490
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,217
Now, this time, if I find something,
you better already know.

491
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,720
What's this?

492
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:50,733
For Sister Rosita's ankle.

493
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,431
I stopped by the NCIS gym.

494
00:23:52,678 --> 00:23:54,101
It took me about

495
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:55,375
four minutes.

496
00:23:57,017 --> 00:23:58,396
And you found something.

497
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,940
We've got two embezzlers,
and one of 'em gets trashed, literally.

498
00:24:12,893 --> 00:24:13,593
Why?

499
00:24:13,783 --> 00:24:16,894
Maybe his partner got greedy,
decided he wanted all the money.

500
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,938
But the theft was three years ago.
What took him so long?

501
00:24:20,144 --> 00:24:20,994
Well...

502
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:24,293
Maybe...

503
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,507
He got scared.

504
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,792
He found out his partner was going
to meet with the agent

505
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:31,267
from the original case.
It wasn't DiNozzo,

506
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:33,305
but the killer didn't know that,

507
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:36,226
so if I'm him,
I'm wondering why my buddy

508
00:24:36,603 --> 00:24:38,395
is meeting with a federal agent.

509
00:24:39,393 --> 00:24:41,086
Maybe he's going to flip on me.

510
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,749
He can't if he's dead.

511
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:46,236
There's our motive.
We just need our killer.

512
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,158
May have just found him.

513
00:24:49,394 --> 00:24:52,896
Abby matched a print from Renny's hotel
room to one of his former coworkers,

514
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:54,411
a Commander Carl Davis.

515
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:55,933
Gear up.

516
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:00,651
What?

517
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:03,062
We've just never heard you
say that much at one time.

518
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,404
Or in a week.

519
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,007
Wasn't my job before.
Come on.

520
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:20,060
So, listen, boss, I just wanted to talk
to you about this before we go in.

521
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,132
I was just thinking,
'cause I'm the boss on this case,

522
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:27,176
I thought maybe I'd drive on the way
back, just for appearances' sake.

523
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:28,750
It's not that important, but...

524
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,589
never mind.

525
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:35,029
Here we go.

526
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,182
I'm the boss. Right.

527
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:39,739
Federal agents.

528
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:43,292
Yes?

529
00:25:43,505 --> 00:25:45,378
NCIS.
Is Commander Davis here?

530
00:25:46,749 --> 00:25:49,238
Well, he is gone for the week.

531
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:50,685
I'm sorry.

532
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:55,146
Look, I said he's not here.

533
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,932
- We have a warrant.
- Wait, what...

534
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,123
McGee, around back.

535
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,390
- I said he's not here!
- Then we won't have a problem...

536
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,269
- What do you think...?
- Just calm down...

537
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:04,356
You have no right! He's not here!

538
00:26:08,898 --> 00:26:09,945
Wait!

539
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:27,641
You guys have got this all wrong.
He likes to be handcuffed.

540
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:29,552
And the broken nose?

541
00:26:30,001 --> 00:26:30,924
He slipped.

542
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:32,259
And the lighter fluid?

543
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,429
Look, after what he did,
it was either that or my garden shears.

544
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,390
Guess it was his lucky day then.

545
00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:39,599
Not yours.

546
00:26:41,139 --> 00:26:42,531
<i>The Burning Bed</i>,

547
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:45,021
1984, Farrah Fawcett.

548
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:47,107
Torched her husband
while he was sleeping.

549
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,734
Second wife's favorite movie.

550
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,738
Maybe Commander Davis' wife
is going for a sequel.

551
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:55,490
<i>Hell hath no fury...</i>

552
00:26:55,942 --> 00:26:57,532
<i>Like a woman scorned.</i>

553
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,830
Third wife's favorite quote.

554
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,879
Here, McGee.

555
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:06,459
Commander Davis' wife received this
in the mail yesterday.

556
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,205
Postmarked from Hawaii.

557
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,668
Over here.

558
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,387
Photos of her husband on a beach,
and he is not alone.

559
00:27:17,822 --> 00:27:19,529
Obviously not the missus.

560
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:21,331
Who sent it?

561
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:24,475
<i>Paid a private investigator
to follow my wife.</i>

562
00:27:24,535 --> 00:27:26,354
<i>Just thought you should know
what he found.</i>

563
00:27:26,587 --> 00:27:28,549
The other husband...
how kind of him.

564
00:27:28,795 --> 00:27:29,795
What do they say?

565
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:31,457
Misery loves company.

566
00:27:32,557 --> 00:27:34,482
Where'd you get that...
your fourth wife?

567
00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:38,139
Hold this against your jaw.

568
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,284
Give us a second.

569
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:44,956
I thought waking up
to General Quarters was tough.

570
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,626
Thank God you came when you did.

571
00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:51,430
Yeah, would have been a bummer
to find my prime suspect dead.

572
00:27:52,091 --> 00:27:53,615
- Prime...?
- Suspect.

573
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:56,158
For what,

574
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,761
cheating on my wife?

575
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:59,623
Embezzling from the Navy.

576
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,475
You don't play much poker, do you?

577
00:28:03,718 --> 00:28:05,518
Murder of Lieutenant Justin Grady.

578
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,640
Jay's dead?

579
00:28:08,716 --> 00:28:09,416
When?

580
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,115
- How?
- There you go.

581
00:28:12,282 --> 00:28:14,110
Now he's got his game face on.

582
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:16,529
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Really?

583
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:19,448
You left your fingerprint
at the crime scene last night.

584
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:21,159
The lieutenant was in Hawaii?

585
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:24,621
Because I was, all last week.

586
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:30,043
And my wife has
the pictures to prove it.

587
00:28:32,736 --> 00:28:34,873
I take full responsibility
for making you think

588
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:36,465
that Commander Davis was the killer.

589
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:37,778
That being said...

590
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:40,261
it's not my fault.

591
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,096
Apology accepted. I think.

592
00:28:44,078 --> 00:28:46,931
Exhibit A, from the murder scene,

593
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,187
where I found
Commander Davis' fingerprint.

594
00:28:49,268 --> 00:28:51,981
Except that Commander Davis was
5,000 miles away at the time.

595
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:55,692
So how did his fingerprint
get in Renny's hotel room?

596
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:58,346
I ran every test
that I could on the dispenser

597
00:28:58,406 --> 00:29:01,157
and I found an interesting
chemical compound on the exterior.

598
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,431
Ammonia, arsenic
and hydrogen cyanide.

599
00:29:08,632 --> 00:29:09,868
Broken thumb.

600
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,987
Cigar?

601
00:29:14,195 --> 00:29:15,797
Cigar-ette...

602
00:29:15,878 --> 00:29:17,359
- smoke.
- Ding!

603
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,381
Except it was a non-smoking room
and the smoke detector never went off.

604
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:24,139
Where did the smoke come from?

605
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:27,877
I called the hotel to get
another dispenser for comparison.

606
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:29,561
Turns out this...

607
00:29:29,696 --> 00:29:31,872
is the model
they use in their hotel.

608
00:29:33,227 --> 00:29:34,554
No one's ever seen...

609
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:36,526
this before.

610
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:38,068
Where'd it come from?

611
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:41,197
Gibbs could have done that with
just a look. You're such a pushover.

612
00:29:41,577 --> 00:29:43,519
It came from here.

613
00:29:45,194 --> 00:29:46,832
Commander Davis' bathroom.

614
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:49,173
Part... of a matching set.

615
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:55,331
Someone stole it from Davis' house
and planted it at the murder scene.

616
00:29:56,584 --> 00:29:58,006
Commander Davis was set up.

617
00:29:58,758 --> 00:30:01,301
The soap dispenser was planted
at the crime scene.

618
00:30:01,494 --> 00:30:03,011
There was a third embezzler.

619
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:05,323
Looks that way, my friend.

620
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:07,249
No, Tony,
there was a third embezzler.

621
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:09,503
I'm looking at Commander
Davis' computer logs.

622
00:30:09,563 --> 00:30:12,386
He transferred the missing money
to an internal account that he created.

623
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:14,637
Then a third user moved it
to an external one.

624
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:18,038
- Can we trace it?
- I'm working on it, but I doubt it.

625
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:21,654
Okay, pretend I'm Gibbs
and try answering again.

626
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:25,325
I am working on it,
but I doubt it, boss.

627
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:27,160
That's all I'm gonna get
out of you, huh?

628
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:30,413
I traced the account to the Caymans,
but that's as far as I could get.

629
00:30:30,494 --> 00:30:33,166
- I'm sorry.
- Okay, give me something to hold.

630
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:34,250
I don't...

631
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:35,763
Thank you.

632
00:30:35,823 --> 00:30:38,130
Whoever that third user is,
he covered his tracks pretty well.

633
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,014
Any chance it could be
my doppel-friend?

634
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:42,710
Renny?
No, that much I'm sure of, but...

635
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:45,981
given his research, you know, he may
be able to provide a little insight.

636
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,766
- We can find our own insight.
- But...

637
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:51,050
Trust me, McGee, if we ask for
a life vest, he's throwing an anchor.

638
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:54,354
Any luck with Commander Davis?

639
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:56,940
Gibbs and Ziva have been
interrogating him for over an hour

640
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,449
and he's not talking.
So, if they can't get him to talk...

641
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:02,610
- Interrogation's that way.
- I know!

642
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,124
You're late, Palmer.

643
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:22,103
Sorry. Had to wait for Dr. Mallard
to leave for his Pilates class.

644
00:31:22,741 --> 00:31:24,012
Jamaican mocha.

645
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:26,345
I heard you were boss again,
I stocked up.

646
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,302
Thanks.

647
00:31:27,383 --> 00:31:28,536
Just in case.

648
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:30,908
All right,

649
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,824
talk to me.

650
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:36,437
I got three guys who embezzled
a cool mil from a Navy base.

651
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,752
And Renny Grant was their fall guy.

652
00:31:39,657 --> 00:31:40,820
I did my homework.

653
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:47,031
First embezzler was found dead,
second was framed for his murder.

654
00:31:47,631 --> 00:31:49,117
So you think the third guy did it?

655
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:50,654
What do you need me for?

656
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:53,368
Can't find him.

657
00:31:54,488 --> 00:31:55,832
Did you follow the money?

658
00:31:56,286 --> 00:31:57,733
Can't find that either.

659
00:31:57,793 --> 00:31:58,894
Not surprised.

660
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:02,391
It's common for embezzlers to sit
on the money for a year or two,

661
00:32:02,451 --> 00:32:04,048
at least until the heat wears off.

662
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,676
Killer might finally be
ready for a withdrawal.

663
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:08,984
And doesn't want to share.

664
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:12,904
- What'd Renny say?
- About?

665
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,316
The third embezzler.

666
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,145
Renny knows his case
better than anybody.

667
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:22,198
You haven't talked to him.

668
00:32:22,598 --> 00:32:24,253
Trust me, if I ask for a life vest,

669
00:32:24,313 --> 00:32:26,155
- he's throwing me an...
- An anchor.

670
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:27,179
Yeah.

671
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:29,483
Yeah...

672
00:32:29,543 --> 00:32:32,482
I guess if I put
an innocent man in prison,

673
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:35,849
the last thing that I would want
to do is go ask him for help.

674
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:39,310
But I'd do it, anyway.

675
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:42,629
Thanks, Palmer.

676
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:43,779
Again.

677
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:48,732
That's...

678
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:50,413
"Agent" Palmer.

679
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:43,697
Is there anybody here?

680
00:33:59,744 --> 00:34:01,332
Pot roast looks a little well done.

681
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:02,723
Prime rib...

682
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:04,127
Madeira.

683
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,671
Fire department says
it's been cooking for hours.

684
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:09,590
I guess we know Renny
wasn't expecting company.

685
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,301
Well, he got it anyway.

686
00:34:13,466 --> 00:34:15,012
Point of entry was from here.

687
00:34:15,384 --> 00:34:16,639
There were security bars,

688
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,350
but it appears Renny removed them.

689
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,144
Guess I would, too,
if I had just spent...

690
00:34:23,905 --> 00:34:24,973
Never mind.

691
00:34:27,336 --> 00:34:28,484
Window's been jimmied.

692
00:34:28,924 --> 00:34:30,528
Yes, possibly with this.

693
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,655
I found it behind the bookshelf.

694
00:34:33,562 --> 00:34:34,906
There is blood on it.

695
00:34:35,603 --> 00:34:37,744
Intruder must've dropped it
in the struggle.

696
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:43,916
Looks like Renny put up
one hell of a fight.

697
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,503
Well, only one thing
seems to be missing.

698
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:49,421
Renny.

699
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,717
Third embezzler knows Renny
might be able to I.D. him.

700
00:34:53,182 --> 00:34:55,594
Yeah, well,
he's tying up loose ends.

701
00:35:06,379 --> 00:35:07,387
McGee, BOLO.

702
00:35:07,447 --> 00:35:09,387
- Checked it four minutes ago.
- Check it again.

703
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:11,350
Ziva, status on the traffic cams.

704
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,363
- You'll know when I get to my desk.
- Gibbs, coordinate with highway patrol.

705
00:35:14,443 --> 00:35:16,458
I want checkpoints
at every on and off ramp.

706
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,617
- No hits yet.
- Widen the search.

707
00:35:19,677 --> 00:35:21,537
The whole county.
No, the whole state.

708
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:24,123
- This a waste of resources!
- Just do it! Now!

709
00:35:25,204 --> 00:35:26,176
DiNozzo.

710
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:26,993
What?

711
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:29,128
Campfire.

712
00:35:41,354 --> 00:35:43,814
- Problems?
- No. Everything's peachy.

713
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:46,180
Nothing I like more than putting
an innocent man in prison.

714
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,439
Except, of course,
for getting him killed.

715
00:35:49,603 --> 00:35:50,525
Renny's dead?

716
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:52,693
I hadn't heard that.

717
00:35:53,825 --> 00:35:56,112
Save the pep talk.
We both know I screwed up.

718
00:35:56,327 --> 00:35:58,241
Yeah.
Three years ago.

719
00:36:01,088 --> 00:36:02,651
But now you're making it right.

720
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:07,453
And me proud.

721
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:12,607
You've been doing...

722
00:36:14,764 --> 00:36:16,217
a hell of a job, Anthony.

723
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:20,540
Until about three minutes ago.

724
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:23,468
Get your head on right.

725
00:36:23,804 --> 00:36:26,435
- What would you like me to do?
- Trust your gut.

726
00:36:26,676 --> 00:36:27,441
Yeah.

727
00:36:29,717 --> 00:36:31,524
I think
I'd rather trust yours right now.

728
00:36:31,604 --> 00:36:34,110
Then give me my damn phone back.

729
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:40,106
Hope I'm not interrupting something

730
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,451
and if I am, I hope somebody's
gonna tell me about it.

731
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:48,195
What do you got, Abs?

732
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,193
Checking the roadblocks, boss.

733
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:53,817
So...

734
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:56,011
I was interrupting something.

735
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,676
Abs, what do you got?

736
00:36:59,793 --> 00:37:02,034
The knife from Renny's house.
I identified the blood on it,

737
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,473
- the good news is it's not Renny's.
- The bad news?

738
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,373
You're such a cynic.
There is no bad news.

739
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:09,353
Only better news.
The blood belongs to...

740
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:12,023
our murder victim
from the Rosewood Suites.

741
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,692
- It's our missing murder weapon.
- Our messy murder weapon.

742
00:37:14,772 --> 00:37:17,320
Which is weird, 'cause most killers,
they'd rinse before they repeat.

743
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,603
- Why didn't ours?
- Why don't you ask him.

744
00:37:22,995 --> 00:37:24,759
He left his DNA on the handle.

745
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:38,557
<i>NCIS handling parking tickets now?</i>

746
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,118
- Where's Renny?
- How should I know?

747
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:42,544
You abducted him.

748
00:37:45,645 --> 00:37:46,849
Why would I do that?

749
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,775
You could almost hear
the band playing in Tony's head.

750
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:51,756
He really does love this part.

751
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:53,022
He's earned it.

752
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,775
Larry, Moe and Curly.

753
00:37:56,246 --> 00:37:57,759
The Three Stooges.

754
00:37:58,497 --> 00:38:01,072
Figured out how to embezzle
a cool mil from the U.S. Navy.

755
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:03,324
But they needed a fall guy,
didn't they?

756
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:05,284
And that was Renny.

757
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,533
I'm the one who told you
I thought Renny was framed.

758
00:38:09,593 --> 00:38:12,122
Yeah, it was a neat trick.
I'm going to have to remember that one

759
00:38:12,305 --> 00:38:15,169
for the next time I want someone
to think I'm a complete moron.

760
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,301
Betcha five bucks
Tony does the chair-toss technique.

761
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,007
Ten he switches
to strong and silent.

762
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:27,598
Nah, 20 bucks he's gonna do
the picture tear.

763
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,376
You thought suitcase stuffed Curly
was going to flip.

764
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,255
So you killed him.

765
00:38:34,737 --> 00:38:37,358
<i>I'm not sure
what you've been smoking but...</i>

766
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:39,777
And then our friend Moe
got framed for the murder.

767
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:43,447
And then you went after Renny,

768
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,450
because you figured he was the only one
who could still implicate you.

769
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,780
And with him dead,

770
00:38:49,044 --> 00:38:50,699
you guys were home free.

771
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,066
Recognize this?

772
00:38:56,028 --> 00:38:57,487
We got your DNA.

773
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,377
You should've stuck with embezzling,

774
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,382
because you're going
to get life for murder.

775
00:39:04,312 --> 00:39:05,917
Okay, look...

776
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:08,809
I did follow Lieutenant Grady
to the Rosewood.

777
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:10,932
But it was just to talk him
out of meeting with you.

778
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:12,601
And the part where you killed him?

779
00:39:13,063 --> 00:39:14,103
He attacked me.

780
00:39:15,685 --> 00:39:16,926
It was self-defense.

781
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:22,338
Self-defense.

782
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,333
- Where's Renny?!
- I don't know!

783
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,198
I don't even know where he lives!

784
00:39:27,317 --> 00:39:29,910
You left the murder weapon
at his house.

785
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:32,413
No, I left it at the Rosewood.

786
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:35,884
I don't know who took it to Renny's,
but it sure as hell wasn't me.

787
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:39,492
I can prove it, too.

788
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:42,609
I was in court yesterday, all day.

789
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:45,051
Court?

790
00:39:45,689 --> 00:39:46,553
Court.

791
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:48,155
Court?

792
00:39:50,832 --> 00:39:54,013
Metro busted Wilkins a week ago for drug
possession. Arraignment was yesterday.

793
00:39:54,073 --> 00:39:55,928
- Which means...
- He didn't grab Renny.

794
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:58,508
Wilkins isn't the only one
with legal problems.

795
00:39:58,568 --> 00:40:01,317
Lieutenant Grady's sealed file
just got unsealed.

796
00:40:02,046 --> 00:40:05,551
If he wasn't lying in our morgue,
he'd be under indictment for mail fraud.

797
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:09,950
Grady was put under investigation
3 weeks ago after the Navy received...

798
00:40:10,165 --> 00:40:11,410
An anonymous tip.

799
00:40:11,754 --> 00:40:13,133
Yeah, how did you know?

800
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:16,432
Metro said Wilkins was busted
after an anonymous tip, too.

801
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:17,508
It gets better.

802
00:40:17,568 --> 00:40:19,251
Abby says the postmark
on the envelope

803
00:40:19,332 --> 00:40:22,088
sent to Commander Davis' wife
was fake.

804
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,945
- Photos weren't sent from Hawaii.
- No.

805
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:26,299
It was hand-delivered.

806
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:27,820
It was all Renny.

807
00:40:27,988 --> 00:40:29,192
He knew who framed him.

808
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:31,429
Yeah, getting his payback.

809
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:33,858
If Renny knew who set him up,
why not turn 'em in?

810
00:40:34,157 --> 00:40:35,309
He was buying time.

811
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:37,147
For what?

812
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:55,579
Remember me?

813
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:04,946
Found Sergeant Wilkins' knife?

814
00:41:05,006 --> 00:41:07,348
Yeah. Right where you left it.
He's in custody.

815
00:41:07,408 --> 00:41:08,801
Looking at life.

816
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:12,457
Wasn't part of the plan,
but I'll take it.

817
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,974
They got what they deserved,
no thanks to you.

818
00:41:15,194 --> 00:41:16,770
What do you think you deserve?

819
00:41:17,669 --> 00:41:19,558
Three years of my life back,

820
00:41:20,118 --> 00:41:21,438
but that's not gonna happen.

821
00:41:21,638 --> 00:41:23,524
Thought I told you
to stay in town, Ren.

822
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:26,235
Those tampering charges
are still pending.

823
00:41:26,746 --> 00:41:28,119
That why you're here?

824
00:41:31,195 --> 00:41:34,115
- I think you know why I'm here.
- You still haven't found the money?

825
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:36,575
I figured, you know,
with all that research that you did,

826
00:41:36,635 --> 00:41:38,146
you might know where they hid it.

827
00:41:39,136 --> 00:41:41,333
It'd be
a hell of a consolation prize.

828
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:42,709
Yeah.

829
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:51,897
Sorry.

830
00:41:53,156 --> 00:41:54,264
Wish I could help.

831
00:42:00,596 --> 00:42:02,583
- Heading south?
- I don't know.

832
00:42:04,016 --> 00:42:05,038
Am I?

833
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:13,407
How'd it go?

834
00:42:15,465 --> 00:42:16,577
I guess I missed him.

835
00:42:17,948 --> 00:42:18,752
Yeah.

836
00:42:19,768 --> 00:42:21,127
Well, I figured.

837
00:42:23,364 --> 00:42:24,875
Boat. Bourbon.

838
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,513
Basement.

839
00:42:27,272 --> 00:42:28,372
I get it.

840
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:44,767
There you go, boss.
