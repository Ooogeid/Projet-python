2
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,013
<i>Ziva, you recognize him?</i>

3
00:00:04,165 --> 00:00:06,216
Yes, I know him.
His name is Michael Rivkin.

4
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,402
- He's with the Mossad.
- Anything you want to tell me?

5
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:11,388
Two members of the terrorist cell
are dead after Rivkin paid them a visit.

6
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:13,153
<i>Do you think
there is any chance Ziva...</i>

7
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,100
Don't ask that question.
Leave it to me.

8
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,894
- Interfering? How is he interfering?
- He's already killed two suspects.

9
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:20,397
Well, in my country,
that would be cause for celebration.

10
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:22,565
You're not in your country,
and neither is he!

11
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:23,775
Michael Rivkin.

12
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:26,152
Guy on the left?
Director of Mossad.

13
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:28,279
- Ziva's father.
- Your father sends his love.

14
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:29,823
What else does my father send?

15
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:30,615
Me.

16
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:32,117
How well do I know him?

17
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:34,244
Well, you saw him
when he was in DC three days ago.

18
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:37,663
She works for me.

19
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:43,594
It's to you, Hutch.

20
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:45,338
Director Hutchins.

21
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:58,059
Did you hear that?

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,478
Can't hear anything with you
splashing the pot.

23
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:02,981
Len, who's your girl on point?
Foster-Yates?

24
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:04,334
Yeah.

25
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:08,611
- Agent Foster-Yates,<i> come in.
</i>- Yes, Sir. Is there a problem?

26
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:10,655
<i>We just heard a noise on the patio.</i>

27
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,119
<i>- Foster-Yates!
- I'm on my way, sir.</i>

28
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:21,332
Get back inside!
Stay inside, Director.

29
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:23,241
- 1 through 4, secure all.
- What's going on?

30
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:25,712
5 through 8,
converge on SecNav's residence.

31
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:28,474
- We got an agent down!
- Lock down the perimeter.

32
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:29,731
Secure the doors.

33
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:30,981
Get an ambulance...

34
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,177
now!

35
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,255
NCIS Season 6 Episode 24
Semper Fidelis V1.0 LOL

36
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:38,767
Synchro: Gaillots.

37
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,478
Rereading: Bruno & Magic Turtle.

38
00:01:58,074 --> 00:02:00,550
www.Team-NCIS.com

39
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:07,714
- Dead man is ICE.
- That's cold.

40
00:02:08,273 --> 00:02:10,215
Immigration Customs Enforcement.

41
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:13,109
- This is turning into a circus.
- Here come the clowns.

42
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,178
FBI does have jurisdiction
on the death of a federal agent.

43
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:17,761
Well, I like our chances,

44
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:20,433
with Gibbs in there waving
a chair like Gunther Gebel-Williams.

45
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:21,793
Lion tamer.

46
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:23,895
My second favorite hero
after Steve McQueen.

47
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:27,234
Sure, because riding a motorcycle
looks cool and all, but...

48
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:29,326
But no one messes
with a man driving an elephant.

49
00:02:29,386 --> 00:02:31,482
A game of cards
between the agency chiefs

50
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:33,451
at the Secretary
of the Navy's house.

51
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,073
Love to be a fly on that wall.

52
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,033
To buzz and irritate the big bosses?

53
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:39,452
No, to eavesdrop
on their conversation.

54
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:41,698
That is an invasion
of privacy, McGee.

55
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:43,540
Mind your backs there, please.

56
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:48,125
Ladies and gentlemen,
the amazing Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard,

57
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:51,479
the first and only M.E.

58
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,716
under the big top.

59
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:55,477
Not to slight your penchant
for theatrics,

60
00:02:55,537 --> 00:02:57,428
Anthony,
but, where is our ringmaster?

61
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,140
Duking it out for the job
with Fornell and some girl from ICE.

62
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:02,725
Excuse me.

63
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,243
A murder investigation?

64
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:06,688
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

65
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:10,195
Agent Sherman could've had
a heart attack, for all we know.

66
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:11,484
Medical examiner is here.

67
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:13,279
Great.

68
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:15,405
NCIS takes the lead,

69
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:17,145
supported by FBI,

70
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:18,666
ICE.

71
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:20,272
CIA can go home.

72
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,745
My house, my rules.

73
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:23,997
Good luck.

74
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:25,707
All yours.

75
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:30,253
Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

76
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:33,468
Agent Julia Foster-Yates.
So...

77
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,132
cards on the table.

78
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:39,547
Four high-profile targets
in the same room.

79
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:41,841
We were tasked with protection.

80
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:43,850
For a poker game.

81
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:47,998
We take even the simplest assignments
very seriously.

82
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:49,440
Not seriously enough.

83
00:03:56,224 --> 00:03:58,239
Looks like someone dropped
a cocktail wienie.

84
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,616
I have a riddle for you.

85
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:02,221
What... is not food,

86
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:05,330
but tastes... very well?

87
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:07,173
I'll give you a hint.

88
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:10,313
And you should come up
with the answer before Officer David,

89
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,378
since it's right on the...

90
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:13,630
Tip of your tongue.

91
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,257
- He bit it off.
- He was flailing,

92
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:18,343
losing control of his limbs.

93
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:23,306
Was he poisoned?

94
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:24,754
No, I don't think so.

95
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:27,810
He has this severe bruise
on his neck.

96
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:30,246
No, this man was attacked.

97
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:31,935
Are you certain?

98
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:34,203
Are you the one that performed CPR?

99
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:35,955
Unsuccessfully.

100
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:37,466
Well, it was the right instinct.

101
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,697
This man was oxygen-deprived.

102
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:42,971
See, he has petechial hemorrhaging
in his eyes.

103
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:44,327
He was strangled.

104
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:49,624
That would suggest someone penetrated
our security web unseen.

105
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,498
And why is that so unlikely?

106
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,128
Because I designed it.
It was airtight.

107
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:56,960
Apparently not.

108
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:01,809
Downloaded all the footage

109
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,962
from the surveillance cams
covering the grounds.

110
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:05,551
Patio's a blind spot.

111
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,977
Bosses get together
couple times a year.

112
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:11,820
Locations
and responsibilities rotate.

113
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:14,705
SecNav's place, ICE's people.

114
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:17,880
CIA brought the chips and dip.

115
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:19,487
The Bureau...

116
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:22,489
- The booze.
- Little early for a drink, Jethro.

117
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,732
Yeah, I might need it.

118
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:25,143
To settle your gut?

119
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:27,996
Something here bother you?

120
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:30,163
No.

121
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:32,375
Nothing here.

122
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:36,598
Not here.

123
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:41,897
Heads of the CIA, FBI, ICE.

124
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:44,512
That's a full bowl
of alphabet soup, huh?

125
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:45,596
Not all of them.

126
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,598
Which letters you got
on your badge, McGee?

127
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,021
Oils from his face
when he pressed against the glass.

128
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,525
Powder is sticking.
Might be adhesive.

129
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:58,317
Agent DiNozzo,

130
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,349
Officer David...

131
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:08,591
A fly.

132
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:10,315
Bug.

133
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:12,408
On the wall.

134
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:15,488
Boss, we found a listening device.
Looks like it was stuck to the glass.

135
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,830
Agent Sherman flails
against the door.

136
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:20,085
It gets dislodged.

137
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,466
Falls under his body.

138
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,059
Whatever happened here...

139
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:25,302
Is still happening.

140
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:26,902
Is it functional?

141
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,639
Damaged.

142
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,058
Best not to take any chances.

143
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:32,398
No!

144
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,859
I mean, it's not like
he left no trace behind.

145
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:42,306
He left exactly one trace.

146
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,670
The bug.

147
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,914
But someone,
in their infinite wisdom, decided

148
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:49,452
to stomp it into a hundred pieces.
It might've still been transmitting.

149
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,870
It was not transmitting.

150
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:54,207
We could have tracked the signal,
you know, maybe gotten a lead.

151
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:56,376
The bug stomp.

152
00:06:57,342 --> 00:06:58,738
It's a classic movie move.

153
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:00,004
Sounds like a Tony.

154
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:01,756
Nah, it was a Jules.

155
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:04,306
A Jules?

156
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:06,511
What is a Jules?

157
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:10,841
I'm going to have to have
a word with this Jules

158
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:12,887
if we ever have
the good fortune of meeting.

159
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:14,811
I'd like to be here for that.

160
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:19,463
What you're holding,
aces and eights there, McGee?

161
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,526
- Dead man's hand?
- What?

162
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,529
No, no, this is what was on the table
when the game ended.

163
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:29,206
The pot's not right.

164
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,160
What do you mean?

165
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:32,756
Well...

166
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:36,958
at a quick glance, it looks like,
uh, five-card draw, 50-buck ante.

167
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:40,628
ICE starts the action with two bills,
three callers. Family pot.

168
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:44,278
SecNav draws one to fill in an inside
straight and misses... figures.

169
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:47,843
CIA keeps the cowboys,
mucks the rags, pulls a second pair.

170
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,138
Hutch misses the flush,
but won't bow out.

171
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:53,057
ICE is the clear leader,
standing pat at the wheel.

172
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,852
I have no idea what you just said.

173
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,104
You got to be an idiot
to still be in this hand.

174
00:07:58,185 --> 00:08:01,219
Are these guys not paying attention?
They're not playing very well.

175
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:03,154
Well, obviously not as well as you.

176
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:08,836
Someone was spying on the card game.

177
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:11,161
Dead agent got in the way.

178
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:12,632
In previous games,

179
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,927
Davenport and his buddies have always
threatened to play till someone dropped.

180
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:18,462
- I guess we should have believed them.
- You've played with them.

181
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:21,712
But not last night.

182
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,589
Last time I played, I cleaned Hutch out.
I cleaned them all out.

183
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:28,339
That's probably
why they didn't invite you back.

184
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,179
Got a hell of a poker face.

185
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:35,028
Ducky has the body.

186
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:37,552
McGee's processing the scene.

187
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:39,437
DiNozzo and David?

188
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:41,939
Reviewing ICE's protection detail.

189
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:45,892
Scouring the grounds
with Agent Foster-Yates.

190
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:47,486
Keep me updated.

191
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,360
Sir.

192
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,857
Heavy footfalls on the lawn,

193
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:55,870
directed towards the patio.

194
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,046
Agents stationed at the perimeter
converged on the house

195
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,918
- after Sherman went down.
- They did not catch his attacker.

196
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:05,588
He did not get out this way.

197
00:09:07,018 --> 00:09:10,217
Unless he could cross a lawn
without bending a blade of grass.

198
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,637
Well, not impossible
with the proper training.

199
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:16,148
She can also do
that trick where you...

200
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,518
put your ear to a rail
and you can hear a train coming.

201
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:21,474
You get this same training?

202
00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:22,480
Me? No.

203
00:09:22,977 --> 00:09:25,720
But I can eat a bucket of chicken
in one sitting and,

204
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:27,151
I have X-ray vision.

205
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,581
Complementary skill sets...

206
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:31,791
make for a stronger team dynamic.

207
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:35,493
I was always trying to explain
that concept to Sherman.

208
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:37,577
Bit of a maverick, huh?

209
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:39,652
He was a good agent.

210
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:43,719
I'm sure the two of you
don't always agree on everything.

211
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,217
No, not everything.

212
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:48,506
Healthy debate breeds...

213
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:50,174
creative solutions.

214
00:09:51,246 --> 00:09:52,530
Isn't that right, Ziva?

215
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:56,430
- Where did she go?
- A few branches are missing up here.

216
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,725
A clear view of the property.
He could study the patrol pattern.

217
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:03,492
They go in, he goes up,
and then he goes out...

218
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,981
that gate.

219
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:09,610
It's McGee.

220
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,737
Hey, Gibbs wants you guys
to come back.

221
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:14,448
- I'm up a tree.
- This might only confuse you further.

222
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,242
Well, who said I was confused?

223
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:18,077
- You said you're up a tree.
- I am.

224
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:20,454
Why is he calling you and not me?
I'm the senior field agent.

225
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,498
I don't know
why he's not calling you.

226
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:24,500
<i>- I did call Tony.</i>
- He's not making any sense.

227
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,210
And you're the one not making sense.

228
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,669
He said he called you.

229
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:32,341
I'm not getting a signal. How come
you're getting a signal and I'm not?

230
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:33,967
Because I'm up a tree.

231
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:38,402
We solve cases
all the time like this.

232
00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:42,351
What did McGee have to say?

233
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:43,838
That it is time to go.

234
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,910
Using his forearm and biceps,
the attacker...

235
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:52,611
puts pressure
on both sides of the neck,

236
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:55,839
cutting off the blood supply
through the carotid arteries.

237
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,100
Here.
Cradled in the crook of his arm...

238
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,705
The trachea and larynx

239
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,672
remain unharmed.

240
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:07,168
Tobias, Tobi...
you, you push up

241
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,504
on a rear choke, not down, and
you turn your chin into your shoulder.

242
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:11,749
Yeah.

243
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,717
After a few moments
in the aptly named

244
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:17,428
sleeper hold,
and the victim loses consciousness.

245
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:19,305
Failure to release the pressure

246
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,266
causes a complete
systematic shutdown.

247
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:24,727
The bladder and bowels release.

248
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:26,016
Hey, Duck?

249
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:31,650
Continue the pressure
and the result is inevitable.

250
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:32,777
Death.

251
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:35,614
By asphyxiation.

252
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,742
Well, that's what I was anticipating
but not what I discovered.

253
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:42,474
Agent Sherman's medical records.

254
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,372
He had warning signs...

255
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:47,375
of atherosclerotic disease.

256
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:51,462
Aggravated by the temporary deprivation
of blood to the brain and...

257
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:53,255
He suffered a fatal stroke.

258
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:55,994
Yeah, but
if the attacker's intent was to kill,

259
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:59,053
he would have held
the choke hold long enough

260
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:01,340
- until the lungs failed.
- I'm good.

261
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,838
But he didn't.

262
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:05,768
Attack wasn't meant to be lethal.

263
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,029
Well, that's what I think.

264
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:10,314
So the intruder makes
his way quickly

265
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:12,312
through a secure perimeter,

266
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:14,819
subdues the only guard
he encounters silently,

267
00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:17,697
- and leaves a listening device behind.
- And vanishes.

268
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:19,546
We're dealing with a pro,

269
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,520
which eliminates the neighbor kid
retrieving a lost Frisbee.

270
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:26,283
I'll have
the Bureau compile profiles.

271
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:38,042
Using your X- ray vision?

272
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:40,761
Black lace, matching set.

273
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:42,012
Really?

274
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:43,389
On the job?

275
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:48,978
SecNav usually has an NCIS agent tasked
to guard him at all times,

276
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,688
but ICE was assigned the detail.

277
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:53,538
Ten men in total, huh?

278
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:55,828
For a poker game
they were not even playing.

279
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,323
Why don't you tell us
what's really going on?

280
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:04,705
The game was just a cover.

281
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:05,915
Wasn't it?

282
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:11,816
I was instructed not
to reveal any details.

283
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,004
I think you should disregard
that instruction.

284
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:18,888
Four agencies...

285
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,844
filled with people who specialize
in finding out information.

286
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:25,972
It was an intelligence summit.

287
00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:29,684
What was the subject?

288
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:32,438
I wish I knew.

289
00:13:34,724 --> 00:13:37,943
Whatever it was, someone was willing
to kill to find out.

290
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,706
"Intelligence summit"?

291
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:52,286
Seems like
your classic contradiction in terms.

292
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:54,237
Don't give me the look,
I didn't know.

293
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:56,424
- You had suspicions.
- Because you had suspicions.

294
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:58,196
I'm riding shotgun here, Gibbs.

295
00:13:58,256 --> 00:14:00,352
- Yeah, can I borrow it?
- Go easy, Hoss.

296
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:02,200
She was just doing
what she was told.

297
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,138
You do not get to determine
what is worth sharing and what is not.

298
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:09,630
- I don't answer to you, Agent Gibbs.
- Yes, you do.

299
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:11,878
Yes... you... do.

300
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:16,273
What else have you left out?

301
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:20,819
Perimeter!

302
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:24,552
Solid design, boss.
Effective.

303
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:26,115
Barring human error.

304
00:14:26,978 --> 00:14:30,287
Are you suggesting I'm incompetent
or that this was an inside job?

305
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:31,902
Dealer's choice.

306
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:36,752
Boss, you know,
I could use the footage to...

307
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:40,547
build an animated model and recreate
the movements of all the players,

308
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:42,919
see if there was
any possible path of entry.

309
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:45,203
All I would need is
the position reports.

310
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:47,221
You got that.
Help him out.

311
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:54,895
Starting to doubt
the invisible man theory, boss?

312
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:58,325
Backgrounds.

313
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:00,150
Every agent on the detail
last night...

314
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:02,069
personal and professional histories.

315
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:04,736
Possible suspects
with the necessary skills,

316
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:05,755
starting with...

317
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:07,754
known foreign operatives
in the area.

318
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,248
FBI profiles.

319
00:15:11,722 --> 00:15:14,090
Really help narrow it down
if we knew what the summit was about.

320
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,750
- Yeah. You got another one of those?
- Triplicate.

321
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:20,070
We need to know
what they were discussing.

322
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,678
Please, come right in.

323
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:24,300
It's crucial to the investigation.

324
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:26,352
Suppose it goes to motive.

325
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,810
Yes, it does, Mr. Secretary.

326
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,230
Sit down, gentlemen.

327
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:52,744
First year of a new president's term,
he's tested.

328
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,581
Check your time line.
June, July, eight years ago,

329
00:15:56,452 --> 00:15:58,208
Al-Qaeda showed themselves.

330
00:15:58,369 --> 00:15:59,566
In flight schools,

331
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,560
where no one was interested
in learning how to take off or land.

332
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,214
Our opportunity was missed

333
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:07,801
because agencies weren't
in the habit of sharing information.

334
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:11,055
There've been far too many foreign
nationals being far too comfortable

335
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,341
on American soil...

336
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:14,516
gun runners, terror cells,

337
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,005
even Israeli Mossad.

338
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,418
You mean like Rivkin.

339
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:20,689
Slipping through our borders
like 9/11 never happened.

340
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,108
Came to a head in L.A. with OSP.

341
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:25,819
Mossad's operative still hasn't been
called home since then.

342
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:28,992
That's Director Eli David's
not too subtle message

343
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:32,326
that we're not doing a strong enough job
of policing our own backyard.

344
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,411
The pretext of a poker game

345
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:37,373
was meant to cut down
on the chatter leading up to the summit,

346
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:40,034
and the informal setting
serves to loosen...

347
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:43,212
stubborn lips accustomed to secrecy.

348
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:46,757
NCIS wasn't represented.

349
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:48,133
I was there.

350
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:58,214
Was one surviving member
of the cell in California Haziq Khaleel?

351
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,728
He's in custody.

352
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:02,147
Macy and Hanna...
they conducted the interrogation.

353
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,983
- Did he spill?
- Haziq gave up his handler...

354
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,527
Abin Tabal.

355
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:10,489
He give up anything
on Callen's shooter?

356
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:11,614
No.

357
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:13,158
How's Callen doing?

358
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:15,744
He's still critical.

359
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:18,269
He's hanging in there.

360
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,668
We got a guy
on our watch list using the alias

361
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:23,836
Abin Tabal...

362
00:17:24,163 --> 00:17:25,958
believed to be here in Washington.

363
00:17:26,993 --> 00:17:27,923
Chase him down.

364
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:34,304
Abin Tabal,

365
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:38,200
aka Adolfo Ruiz,
aka Hikmet Gillersoy, aka, like,

366
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,767
nine other made-up names.

367
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:42,830
Over the course of the last three years,
he has hit the watch list with Spanish,

368
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,062
Russian, Chechnyan, Greek
and Cypriot passports.

369
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:46,691
Doesn't keep the same one very long.

370
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:50,306
The United States is the only common
destination among all the passports.

371
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:52,322
Under various identities,
he's landed

372
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:55,293
in Egypt, Algeria, Libya and Niger.

373
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:57,786
So the guy's got a fondness
for Northern Africa.

374
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:00,497
Excuse me.

375
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,624
Officer David.

376
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:03,787
<i>Shalom.</i>

377
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:07,834
What do you think?

378
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:09,922
- Training center?
- He's the handler.

379
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,009
Goes back and forth
between headquarters and

380
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:13,961
activating sleeper cells
in the States.

381
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,188
I'll catch Gibbs up.
Find the guy.

382
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,647
I like taking orders
from just about anybody, I guess.

383
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,489
Especially the guy
who framed me for murder.

384
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:26,471
One minute he's framing me
for murder, the next

385
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:28,620
he's treating me
like a perfectly capable agent.

386
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,485
The nerve.

387
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:39,072
I have to run out for a few minutes.

388
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:40,681
I'll be right back.

389
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:43,421
I will be right here.

390
00:18:52,863 --> 00:18:55,408
Full digitization would take
all day.

391
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,685
Quick-scan the access road footage?

392
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:00,182
Exactly what I was thinking, Jules.

393
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:04,269
Thanks for coming
to my rescue up there.

394
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,105
I appreciate it, Tim.

395
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:08,353
My pleasure.

396
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:14,295
Are you often in the habit
of destroying evidence, Jules?

397
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:16,824
- Beg your pardon?
- You should...

398
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:18,576
actually...

399
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:21,442
because I'm the one responsible
for reconnecting

400
00:19:21,502 --> 00:19:25,458
and reactivating all of those extremely
delicate pieces of electronics.

401
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:28,335
- You can do that?
- Of course I can.

402
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:29,978
Then what's the problem?

403
00:19:32,044 --> 00:19:33,959
You probably know some kind of...

404
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,676
martial arts or something, huh?

405
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:40,222
When I was in high school,
my mother was the ambassador to Bangkok.

406
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:42,895
I fell in love with Muay Thai.

407
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:46,251
So if I tried to scratch
your eyes out,

408
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,068
you could probably break my fingers?

409
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:49,539
That would be a mistake.

410
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:52,741
You need your fingers
to fix that bug.

411
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:57,062
And in my own lab.

412
00:20:00,945 --> 00:20:02,508
Rewind that security footage.

413
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,987
It's the same car.

414
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:07,166
Second time it's passed by.

415
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,869
Casing the place.
Can you I.D. the driver?

416
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:11,772
No, but I can pull the plate.

417
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:15,673
Let's pull up the registration.

418
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:23,195
Someone you know?

419
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:25,001
I got to get Gibbs.

420
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:33,734
Jules,
you should probably come with me.

421
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,131
A vehicle.

422
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:38,779
Pulled off surveillance
approaching SecNav's house.

423
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:41,115
That doesn't belong to Abin Tabal.

424
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:44,322
Come on, Leon, you should be able
to recognize your own car.

425
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:46,617
What were you doing
outside the house?

426
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:49,295
I wasn't invited inside.

427
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,909
I'm getting very tired
of information being withheld.

428
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,432
I know what you mean.

429
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:56,673
Curiosity can make you do
some funny things.

430
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:57,758
Like what?

431
00:20:58,396 --> 00:20:59,842
Cruise a secret meeting?

432
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,970
Just to confirm it took place.

433
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,921
Director Hutchins let it slip
a week ago.

434
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,708
Before he realized
you were being excluded?

435
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,185
It's a tough town, Gibbs.

436
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,530
Believe it or not,
I'm still trying to get the hang of it.

437
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:13,659
Relationships are delicate.

438
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:16,227
Why weren't you invited?

439
00:21:19,522 --> 00:21:21,848
Because they were there
to talk about me.

440
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:26,328
I wish I could stay for lunch,
Michael.

441
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:28,455
That's okay.
Join me for a drink.

442
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:32,846
Another vodka,
just a splash of soda this time, please.

443
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:34,344
Nothing for me, thanks.

444
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:36,913
I'm working on a case.

445
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,260
Tell me.

446
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:47,127
This is
what a relationship looks like.

447
00:21:47,187 --> 00:21:48,675
How was your day, dear?

448
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:53,313
I'll tell you when it's over.

449
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:04,199
- I thought I told you I would...
<i>- Shut up.</i>

450
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,117
<i>You gotta get back here right now.</i>

451
00:22:06,663 --> 00:22:07,460
<i>Now!</i>

452
00:22:10,994 --> 00:22:12,248
You have to go already?

453
00:22:12,308 --> 00:22:15,289
Well, we're looking for a terrorist,
and Tony says we just found him, so...

454
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:16,878
I'll see you later?

455
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:33,448
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

456
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:37,007
Is this seat taken?

457
00:22:44,828 --> 00:22:47,162
This is a little like
that scene in <i>Heat</i>,

458
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:49,220
when Pacino and DeNiro finally meet.

459
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,455
I'm DeNiro in this scene?

460
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:54,688
You think you're DeNiro
in this scene.

461
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:57,002
Okay. You can call me Al.

462
00:22:57,462 --> 00:22:58,754
I'll spare you the singing.

463
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,089
You've come
to chase her away from me.

464
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:03,603
Mikey Israel.

465
00:23:04,204 --> 00:23:06,516
In the very tan flesh.
Trip to L.A. did you good.

466
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:08,597
Ziva prefers darker skin.

467
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:10,557
How does she like being played?

468
00:23:12,472 --> 00:23:14,342
'Cause I think we both know this...

469
00:23:15,232 --> 00:23:17,092
romance isn't kosher.

470
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:21,731
I can understand your suspicions, given
what we have about you in your dossier,

471
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:23,445
Agent Meatball.

472
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:25,659
There's an El Al flight tonight

473
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:28,450
out of Ronald Reagan at 8:25 p.m.

474
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:31,110
Lands at Ben-Gurion
tomorrow evening.

475
00:23:34,124 --> 00:23:36,041
I'm not finished spending time
with Ziva.

476
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:37,876
NCIS says you are.

477
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:40,712
Ziva's very lucky
to have a man like you

478
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:41,679
in her life.

479
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,903
Like a...

480
00:23:44,414 --> 00:23:45,444
big brother.

481
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:48,665
I've got some work to do,
and you clearly have some...

482
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,747
drinking to finish, and after that,

483
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:52,945
I think you should start packing.

484
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:00,941
You can question my feelings
for Ziva all you want.

485
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,568
Unfortunately,

486
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,038
you can't question
her feelings for me.

487
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,025
Can you?

488
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:09,927
Say good-bye, Mikey.

489
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:11,993
Get on the flight.

490
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:22,723
We've reconstructed everyone's
movements from last night on this

491
00:24:22,783 --> 00:24:25,424
wire frame representation
of the SecNav's residence.

492
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,943
These blue figures represent
the agents on patrol.

493
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:33,864
The units moved in overlapping
sweeping patterns on the outer layer.

494
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:35,642
The inner layer was stationary.

495
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:37,099
Sophisticated.

496
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,021
Even if someone managed
to get through the outer ring unseen,

497
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,324
their path would be limited.
They'd be funneled into plain sight.

498
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:45,631
So, what went wrong?

499
00:24:46,561 --> 00:24:48,261
Well, there's a hole in the net.

500
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:51,295
When Sherman leaves to take
the position on the patio,

501
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:53,571
leaves this avenue wide open.

502
00:24:55,065 --> 00:24:56,215
Yes, it does.

503
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:58,162
Well, you got an explanation?

504
00:25:02,098 --> 00:25:03,170
It's an error.

505
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:10,245
Nobody's perfect, Jules.
Not you and not this guy.

506
00:25:10,305 --> 00:25:11,470
We'll find him.

507
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:14,389
You got those backgrounds?

508
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,210
Almost finished.

509
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,060
These are what we have so far.

510
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:20,979
- Got to check in with my boss.
- Sure.

511
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,857
Abby needs my help with the bug.

512
00:25:23,937 --> 00:25:24,641
Go.

513
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:28,071
This idea of friendly relations
between agencies, full disclosure...

514
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:29,836
Flies in the face of history.

515
00:25:30,757 --> 00:25:32,580
You vouch for the ICE princess?

516
00:25:32,828 --> 00:25:35,396
She's cool on the outside,
but when she opens up, she's...

517
00:25:36,449 --> 00:25:39,844
she's full of beans, molten cheese,
like a microwave burrito.

518
00:25:40,197 --> 00:25:41,208
What? I'm hungry.

519
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:05,273
So when the bug is working properly,

520
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:09,611
it emits a signal that can piggyback
on any available Internet connection,

521
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:11,530
and then, it can upload the audio

522
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,518
to a live stream
on a private Web site.

523
00:26:14,694 --> 00:26:16,591
So, basically, it's a fancy tin can.

524
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:18,958
We follow the string
to the can on the other end.

525
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:22,249
What, you never camped out
in the backyard as a kid?

526
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:23,416
Are you crazy?

527
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:25,293
There were alligators
in my backyard.

528
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:32,592
You know,
you don't really need my help with this.

529
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,024
Second set of hands can't hurt.

530
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,681
You feeling neglected?

531
00:26:39,752 --> 00:26:40,809
Neglected?

532
00:26:41,385 --> 00:26:42,952
More like nauseous.

533
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:46,734
Having to watch you flirt
with that Jules.

534
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:49,357
Come on.
I wasn't flirting.

535
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:53,095
Your hands...

536
00:26:53,476 --> 00:26:55,474
drifting across the keyboard.

537
00:26:56,237 --> 00:26:58,947
Pinkies accidentally
grazing each other.

538
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:01,496
Please. I know.

539
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,318
She's out of my league, anyway, Abs.

540
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:06,251
No, she's not.

541
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:16,636
We have not found Tabal yet.

542
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:18,347
We really should be working harder.

543
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:21,648
I came back here quickly because
you said we had found Abin Tabal.

544
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:23,967
Where were you?

545
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:27,397
Where were you?

546
00:27:30,545 --> 00:27:33,695
He was in L.A. on business
just like he's in D.C. on business.

547
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:34,924
I cannot believe you.

548
00:27:34,984 --> 00:27:37,073
If you wanted to meet him,
I could introduce you.

549
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:39,701
I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't check on him.

550
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,889
Gibbs told him to clock out.

551
00:27:44,949 --> 00:27:46,706
I told him to clock out.

552
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:49,294
Perhaps it would carry
some more weight if it came from you.

553
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:50,953
Michael is here to see me.

554
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:52,206
He is not working.

555
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:53,381
He is on vacation.

556
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:55,175
Well,
he certainly is drinking like it.

557
00:28:03,592 --> 00:28:04,976
Conference room's this way?

558
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:07,687
I'll show you.

559
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:22,032
CPB hasn't gotten a hit yet

560
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:24,583
on any of Abin Tabal's
known aliases.

561
00:28:24,643 --> 00:28:26,584
Likely he's still in the country.

562
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:29,893
The invisible man.

563
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:36,091
The results of interviews...

564
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,030
with every member
of your team last night.

565
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,805
There were
some bad feelings circulating.

566
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:45,677
Inevitable with any team, I imagine.

567
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:48,977
Performance reviews...

568
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:50,772
Agent Sherman's and yours.

569
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:53,608
He had four more years
of service than you did,

570
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:56,308
but you were promoted over him.

571
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,836
With good cause. You'll notice my evals
and recs were consistently higher.

572
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:01,658
He openly objected

573
00:29:01,937 --> 00:29:03,493
to taking orders from a woman...

574
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:05,662
with less seniority.

575
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:07,956
You can't have appreciated that.

576
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:13,002
Agent Sherman was very passionate
about his duty.

577
00:29:16,151 --> 00:29:17,889
He was a thorn in your side.

578
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:23,997
Let's just stop right here,
before you embarrass yourselves

579
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:26,683
by actually accusing me
of killing Agent Sherman!

580
00:29:28,264 --> 00:29:30,276
I lost an agent last night.

581
00:29:30,808 --> 00:29:33,481
Maybe that gets easier with time,
but for me, it's...

582
00:29:40,018 --> 00:29:42,157
I've been trying not to kick dirt
on a dead man's grave.

583
00:29:42,444 --> 00:29:43,930
That's my mistake.

584
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:46,327
His death is not...

585
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:50,358
He wasn't supposed
to be on the patio.

586
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:53,160
He was out of position.

587
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,046
He disregarded his assignment.

588
00:29:58,558 --> 00:29:59,258
Why?

589
00:29:59,725 --> 00:30:01,186
I don't know.
Spite.

590
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:02,330
Jealousy.

591
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,605
He was never concerned
about making me look bad.

592
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:12,831
There was a hole in the net
because he moved.

593
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:17,650
He's dead for the same reason
he never got the promotion.

594
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:22,322
He didn't operate as part of a team.

595
00:30:23,811 --> 00:30:24,699
And you do?

596
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:27,785
Yeah.

597
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:30,663
Yeah. All right.

598
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,750
Abby's got a link to Tabal.

599
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:46,382
You're coming?

600
00:30:55,477 --> 00:30:57,356
Schematics of SecNav's house.

601
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:01,485
Looks like our guy.

602
00:31:01,748 --> 00:31:02,898
So does this.

603
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,451
Abin Tabal.

604
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:11,780
Well, at least now
we know he really existed.

605
00:31:20,126 --> 00:31:22,180
Potassium cyanide poisoning.

606
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,433
We found a residue of silica and...

607
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,633
polyisoprene between his first
and second premolars.

608
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:29,556
He bit down on a suicide pill.

609
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:31,924
Just a few hours ago.

610
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,013
Yeah.

611
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:36,646
No signs of forced entry
at the motel.

612
00:31:37,388 --> 00:31:39,029
No indication of any struggle.

613
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:42,193
Abin Tabal killed himself.

614
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:45,738
This guy's supposed to be invisible.

615
00:31:45,924 --> 00:31:48,032
That's his primary asset
as an operative.

616
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:51,452
He loses that when he accidentally kills
an American agent.

617
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:53,246
His usefulness is gone.

618
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:55,145
We close off all exit routes.

619
00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:58,835
So he decides to take
the only other way out.

620
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:02,380
You back this psychology?

621
00:32:03,262 --> 00:32:04,079
Yeah.

622
00:32:04,504 --> 00:32:06,130
If-If he was a true believer.

623
00:32:06,318 --> 00:32:08,553
If he believed himself a threat
to the cause,

624
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:11,598
then exposure becomes his enemy.

625
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:14,225
If he removes himself,
he removes the problem.

626
00:32:14,305 --> 00:32:17,145
After he's passed on all the intel
he's managed to accumulate.

627
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:18,813
He wiped his computer.

628
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,356
Abby's sifting through it.

629
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,860
She already connected the laptop to the
electronics and the listening device?

630
00:32:27,943 --> 00:32:28,823
Smoking gun.

631
00:32:32,237 --> 00:32:33,953
Case closed.
Write it up.

632
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:36,331
I think
you're already packed up, McGee.

633
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:40,460
He's delaying his departure
to coincide with someone else.

634
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,382
It was nice working with you guys.

635
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:46,758
Thank you for everything.

636
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,760
- Yeah, you, too.
- You, too.

637
00:32:49,524 --> 00:32:50,784
I'll walk out with you.

638
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:53,518
So what did Gibbs
and Fornell have to say?

639
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:57,610
They were just apologizing
for implying I might be a murderer.

640
00:32:59,197 --> 00:33:00,540
You're kidding.
They were?

641
00:33:00,696 --> 00:33:01,396
Yes.

642
00:33:01,956 --> 00:33:03,008
The both of them?

643
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:04,430
That's so shocking?

644
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:12,722
You know, it might take a while
to fully grasp the significance of that.

645
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:16,671
Explain it to me. I've got no plans.

646
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:18,757
All right.

647
00:33:19,395 --> 00:33:21,762
Did Gibbs actually say the words,
"I'm sorry"?

648
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:27,622
Good night.

649
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:28,766
Night.

650
00:33:37,063 --> 00:33:38,514
Rule Number 11, DiNozzo.

651
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,808
I would never date
a co-worker, boss.

652
00:33:42,177 --> 00:33:44,232
Trust me.
I mean, why would you even...

653
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:47,290
That's 12.

654
00:33:47,623 --> 00:33:48,420
11.

655
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:51,667
When the job is done, walk away.

656
00:33:52,288 --> 00:33:54,170
The case is wrapped up, DiNozzo.

657
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:56,115
In a nice little bow.

658
00:33:56,352 --> 00:33:58,416
And, and that works for you,
Fornell?

659
00:33:58,476 --> 00:34:00,123
Crazy terrorist kills himself.

660
00:34:00,611 --> 00:34:02,958
Can't really understand
that mentality.

661
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:04,711
Doesn't mean I can't accept it.

662
00:34:13,222 --> 00:34:15,136
So what's on your mind?

663
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,224
Rivkin's been in town.

664
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:20,044
I know.

665
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:22,480
With Ziva.

666
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:24,783
Guy doesn't listen.

667
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:28,142
Does that bother you on
a professional level or a personal one?

668
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:29,277
I tell you what...

669
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,244
I'm having
a little trouble untangling the two.

670
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:33,969
So you are bothered.

671
00:34:34,946 --> 00:34:35,804
Oh, yeah.

672
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,931
It bothers me.

673
00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:43,379
You stay on it.

674
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:45,127
Yep.

675
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:50,883
How'd you know
what I like to drink, Gibbs?

676
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:55,779
My older brother gave me
my first bourbon,

677
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:58,019
before I was even a teenager.

678
00:35:01,044 --> 00:35:02,808
He liked to mess with my head.

679
00:35:04,976 --> 00:35:06,382
My grandfather had a still.

680
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,789
It blew up once...

681
00:35:10,421 --> 00:35:13,070
and he ran back inside
to rescue his sour mash.

682
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:15,698
It is a living thing.

683
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:21,645
It's safe to talk here?

684
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:23,164
Safer than your house.

685
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:30,378
It was a point of pride
with my brother, though.

686
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,673
"I never hit you" he'd say.

687
00:35:32,926 --> 00:35:35,384
Preferred psychological warfare.

688
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:39,676
You're an only child,
aren't you, Gibbs?

689
00:35:39,736 --> 00:35:40,734
The Corps.

690
00:35:43,484 --> 00:35:44,477
Strangers...

691
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,065
become brothers in a foxhole.

692
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:50,714
That why you've been digging dirt?

693
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:53,249
Trying to get closer to Leon?

694
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:55,873
No.

695
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,774
I never asked for this.

696
00:36:02,234 --> 00:36:03,534
Never opened it.

697
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,130
Well...

698
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:15,089
let's see what the CIA's got
on Leon Vance.

699
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:22,849
I thought we shredded all these.

700
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:27,353
How does this thing keep finding
its way into the open?

701
00:36:27,545 --> 00:36:28,646
It's not even real.

702
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:32,780
Lucky you didn't read this.

703
00:36:33,506 --> 00:36:35,563
Wouldn't give you
the whole picture anyway.

704
00:36:38,736 --> 00:36:39,886
And you will?

705
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:43,910
- Is that Tabal's laptop?
- Yeah. Before

706
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:46,998
Tabal killed himself,
he wiped all the sensitive information.

707
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:49,051
So there's
nothing useful on it, huh?

708
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:52,546
He did fail to erase
the laptop's network location memory.

709
00:36:52,606 --> 00:36:55,926
It's a log that records
all previous network connections,

710
00:36:56,128 --> 00:36:58,217
so you can access them
easily in the future.

711
00:36:58,612 --> 00:37:01,399
All that's going to tell us is
where he's used the Internet before.

712
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:02,388
Bring that up.

713
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,916
- I know that address.
- Yeah.

714
00:37:08,303 --> 00:37:09,103
Me, too.

715
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:11,847
It's Ziva's.

716
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:27,955
Lot of black bars
covering Leon's career.

717
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:30,625
Man was born
for counter intelligence.

718
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:35,922
You didn't peg him
for a lifelong bureaucrat?

719
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:38,396
Nah.

720
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,288
Figured he'd worn a few hats.

721
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:42,822
Heard a whisper or two.

722
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:47,558
There's not a second
of his life I can't account for.

723
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:51,312
I might hit him with a stick
every now and then, but,

724
00:37:52,391 --> 00:37:55,903
I did not leave him out of that poker
game because I don't trust him.

725
00:37:57,906 --> 00:37:59,820
You were discussing how to use him.

726
00:38:01,908 --> 00:38:02,782
Yeah, I know.

727
00:38:03,844 --> 00:38:06,285
Since Director Shepard's death,

728
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:09,538
you've been concerned
with the danger

729
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:13,209
in having
the wrong person at the top.

730
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,574
Well, you're not alone.

731
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,507
You're not the only one looking out
for the integrity of NCIS.

732
00:38:23,656 --> 00:38:26,305
Leon's going to be point man
in a major operation.

733
00:38:28,783 --> 00:38:30,481
- Who's the enemy?
- That's the problem.

734
00:38:30,848 --> 00:38:31,932
It's our friends.

735
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,036
The Israelis.

736
00:38:35,096 --> 00:38:36,190
Top priority.

737
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,997
Ever since Shepard created
that unorthodox position of...

738
00:38:40,723 --> 00:38:42,278
"liaison officer".

739
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,410
You're talking about Ziva David.

740
00:38:48,383 --> 00:38:52,379
Father's the director of Mossad,
half-brother was a rogue operative.

741
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:55,792
He died in this room, didn't he?

742
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:57,497
At your hand.

743
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:02,725
And she works with you every day.

744
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,610
What a family.

745
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:13,399
Ziva, it's Tony.

746
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:23,014
You're here.

747
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,864
Ziva is not.

748
00:39:25,288 --> 00:39:26,464
She'll be back soon.

749
00:39:27,226 --> 00:39:29,178
You're welcome to come in
and wait for her.

750
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,069
Did you really expect me to leave her
because you threaten me?

751
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:40,337
I had my hopes.

752
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:44,842
Did they include
you coming here late at night?

753
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,720
Maybe finding Ziva
in an emotional state?

754
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,899
You help her pick up the pieces?

755
00:39:51,492 --> 00:39:54,393
I'm here about a case.
An American agent was killed last night.

756
00:39:54,732 --> 00:39:55,993
All the evidence...

757
00:39:56,053 --> 00:39:59,231
points to a terrorist named Abin Tabal.
I think you're familiar with him.

758
00:40:01,962 --> 00:40:03,027
Of course...

759
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:05,529
he killed himself
before we could catch up to him.

760
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:06,739
Zealot.

761
00:40:06,996 --> 00:40:08,224
That's the theory.

762
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:10,451
It's a little too clean for me.

763
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:12,154
Does not sound clean at all.

764
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,667
Sounds like the further you dig,
the messier it gets.

765
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:15,962
Well, what can I say?

766
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:19,210
The events of the past year have
made me a little suspicious.

767
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:20,961
Even to the people closest to you?

768
00:40:21,102 --> 00:40:22,278
Especially them.

769
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,049
We pulled information
from Tabal's computer.

770
00:40:25,582 --> 00:40:28,507
Says that, at some point,
the Internet was connected...

771
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:30,374
here.

772
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:32,264
Ziva's account.

773
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:34,310
She is tied to this dead man?

774
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:36,268
Who is obviously duplicitous.

775
00:40:36,596 --> 00:40:38,433
Practiced in the art
of misinformation.

776
00:40:38,493 --> 00:40:40,205
That appears to be
the shape of things.

777
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,558
You're here to question Ziva?

778
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:47,113
All because a series of numbers
on a terrorist's computer?

779
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:48,117
I was.

780
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:50,490
Until you opened the door.

781
00:40:53,714 --> 00:40:54,746
Semper Fi.

782
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:02,962
You and Leon gotta play nice.

783
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,248
You ordering me to trust him?

784
00:41:10,174 --> 00:41:11,350
Just to follow him.

785
00:41:14,731 --> 00:41:16,260
We don't hit our brothers.

786
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:23,483
Soon as you're done with your drink,
Michael,

787
00:41:23,543 --> 00:41:24,692
you're under arrest...

788
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:27,190
for the murders of Abin Tabal

789
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,904
and Federal Agent Tom Sherman.

790
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:30,823
Good luck with that.

791
00:42:15,001 --> 00:42:15,743
Enough!

792
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,336
Don't do it.

793
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,171
No. Don't!

794
