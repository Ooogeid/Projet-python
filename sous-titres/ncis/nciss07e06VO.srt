2
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:04,978
Always get this much excitement
before you've left port?

3
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:07,459
What can I say?
We like to keep on our toes.

4
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:09,551
<i>This is your final warning!</i>

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,763
<i>Identify yourself immediately!</i>

6
00:00:12,306 --> 00:00:14,134
<i>This is your final warning!</i>

7
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:15,971
Put a light on 'em.

8
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:21,646
It's just a small sailboat. It must
have slipped around the curtain.

9
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,856
Looks like a hand-built Amigo kit,

10
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:26,734
but I don't think we have to worry
about it being an attack.

11
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:29,696
Unless they suicided a little early.

12
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:33,792
Two bodies.

13
00:00:34,347 --> 00:00:35,405
It's a bloodbath.

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,834
Get divers in the water,
wrangle that craft.

15
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:39,751
It's a crime scene now.

16
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:42,127
Looks like it's got your name on it,
Agent Cortez.

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,640
It's not my name, but it is labeled.

22
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:20,747
You do realize this is a trap?

23
00:01:21,309 --> 00:01:23,868
She's practically inviting us
to mess with her.

24
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:26,097
What kind of a man would I be

25
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:28,046
if I turned down
such an enticing invitation?

26
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,186
Well, you wouldn't be a sucker.

27
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,027
Touch me and die.

28
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,599
Good, you're awake.

29
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,274
Sleeping on the job isn't going
to help you shed that "probie" tag.

30
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:46,439
I have been on the job
since 1:00 in the morning

31
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,332
when Gibbs called me in to cover.

32
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:50,859
He flew out late last night
with Vance and Ducky...

33
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:53,863
Some case in the San Diego harbor.

34
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:55,840
Ducky means bodies.

35
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,776
They called you to cover?

36
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,003
I believe you call this hazing.

37
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:05,652
We call this the Bill of Rights.

38
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:08,795
Are you studying to become
a naturalized American citizen?

39
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:11,509
I have to if I want
to become an agent.

40
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:13,649
- Good for you, Ziva.
- Wait a second.

41
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,301
Who says we want her as an American?

42
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,636
Who says you have a say?

43
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,444
A little thing called
the Constitution.

44
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:20,889
Oh, really?
Where?

45
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:22,934
It's in there, and it talks about...

46
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:26,598
dangerous foreign aliens
stealing our precious bodily fluids.

47
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,203
That's <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>.

48
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:32,006
Yes, but it's also, I think,
the 16th amendment.

49
00:02:32,177 --> 00:02:34,195
"Congress shall have
the power to lay and collect

50
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,197
taxes on incomes,
from whatever source derived,

51
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,558
without apportionment..."

52
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,408
Are you learning
this stuff through osmosis?

53
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,204
We'll be lucky to have you, Ziva.
The more the merrier.

54
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:47,713
<i>Laissez-faire</i>, immigration policy like
that is what Rush Limbaugh

55
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:51,302
says led to the greatest economic crisis
in the history of our fantastic nation.

56
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:53,249
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

57
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:56,075
You bet your ass I do.
I'm talking about the American dream.

58
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,990
What do you know about
the American dream?

59
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,179
Well, let's see,
I'm a white male between

60
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:03,099
the ages of 18 and 49
with a loud mouth and a gun.

61
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,824
I am the American dream.

62
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:08,962
Thank God.

63
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:12,358
- Agent McGee.
<i>- Two dead bodies, McGee.</i>

64
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:14,789
Photos coming your way.
Tell Abby to clear the decks.

65
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:16,679
<i>Okay, what are we looking at, Boss?</i>

66
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:19,584
- I don't know yet.
- I secured the crime scene, Director,

67
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:21,175
and began to process it.

68
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,160
I ran the VIN and found
the boat was registered

69
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,186
to an NCIS Agent Gibbs.

70
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,459
That's you, right? So what's the deal?
What's with the dead guys?

71
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,680
- Shell casings, Izzy?
- Bagged and tagged, Sir.

72
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:34,505
I take it you didn't

73
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,329
move the bodies.

74
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,619
No, Doctor.
I was trained better than that.

75
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:42,305
There's no identification
in their pockets, Jethro, only cash.

76
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,360
Dollars and Pesos.

77
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,434
Agent Cortez,
if you didn't know that this boat,

78
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:50,229
loaded with dead bodies,
belonged to an NCIS Agent,

79
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,773
how do you think it ended up
rolling into a naval base?

80
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,525
I'd speculate, given the currents,

81
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:56,422
it came from the south,

82
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,321
somewhere in Mexico possibly.

83
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:00,785
As for who might have set it
on its course,

84
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:02,304
I wouldn't think to guess.

85
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:05,417
You usually light the thing
on fire for a Viking funeral.

86
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,658
You know any Vikings
who live in Mexico?

87
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:11,603
This does have more of a...

88
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,962
- wild west feel to it.
- Solved it already?

89
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:17,878
Glad I made the trip.

90
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:21,563
You've only taken
one vacation this year, Jethro.

91
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,346
Sailed the gulf route to Mexico?

92
00:04:23,748 --> 00:04:25,348
One-way plane ticket back.

93
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:28,267
Did I have the fish
or did I have the lasagna?

94
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:31,938
I left him with the boat.

95
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:34,559
He trailered it to the West Coast.

96
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:36,776
It was a gift for my goddaughter.

97
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:40,029
- This is how he repays you.
- I got no idea what's going on here.

98
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:42,031
You guys already know
who the killer is?

99
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,211
Agent Cortez,
use your contacts with the Federales.

100
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:46,701
Clear a path for us.

101
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,035
We're headed South to the border.

102
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:56,814
It's not going to be necessary.

103
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:58,089
Are you sure?

104
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:41,640
Nobody's home.

105
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:44,028
So where is he?

106
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:47,582
Where the hell is Mike Franks?

107
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,343
That's...?

108
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,353
It's no longer in...?

109
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:12,522
- This is Gibbs' boat?
- This...

110
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:15,084
is the crime scene.

111
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:17,706
It was flown here
in a C-130 cargo plane

112
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:20,003
along with two bodies
and all the evidence.

113
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:21,982
And now it is mine.

114
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,091
It is all mine...

115
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:27,375
So I can figure out the mystery.

116
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,251
What mystery...
Who the dead guys were?

117
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:30,654
Or who killed them?

118
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:33,017
- Or how they ended up on the boat?
- Sure,

119
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:34,727
you guys should work on that,

120
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,315
while I figure out...

121
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,399
how he got it out of the basement.

122
00:06:43,798 --> 00:06:46,604
Flagged all of Franks' known aliases.
No hits yet.

123
00:06:46,897 --> 00:06:48,677
God knows he's got
a head start on us.

124
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:51,681
Ducky says that those bodies have been
floating around for at least three days.

125
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:53,923
AFIS kick out any I.D.s yet?

126
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:57,416
Calvin Blanchard, Roy Keenan.

127
00:06:57,777 --> 00:06:59,835
They both have military backgrounds.

128
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:02,625
They were both
dishonorably discharged.

129
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:05,674
Blanchard was Army. Keenan washed out
of the Navy a couple years ago.

130
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,719
- Mike Franks was already retired.
- So no professional connection.

131
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,462
Cortez has got a contact in Mexico,
says these two guys were...

132
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:14,767
going around asking
about Mike Franks last week.

133
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:18,020
You sifted through family members,
common friends in the service?

134
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,737
Couldn't find anyone with a grudge.

135
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:21,982
Is that where your gut's
leading you, Gibbs?

136
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,844
We got two guys looking for Franks,
who really doesn't want to be found.

137
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,057
They find him on the boat,
he gets the drop.

138
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:29,824
Shoved 'em off and disappeared.

139
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:32,660
That last part's the part
I really don't like.

140
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:35,740
If he's gone to ground,
that means this isn't over yet.

141
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,748
You got any idea where he might be?

142
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:40,452
No, your guess is
as good as mine, Leon.

143
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,253
For some reason,
I doubt that's true,

144
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:44,469
But I'm gonna give you
some leeway on this, Gibbs,

145
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:47,341
since it is your friend,
your boat, your mess.

146
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,208
My patience will evaporate quickly

147
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:54,606
if another body shows up
before Franks does.

148
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:06,289
I've only just begun, Jethro.
I'm afraid you've jumped the gun.

149
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:08,424
That's an interesting choice
of words, Duck.

150
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,672
How positively Freudian of me.

151
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:12,408
Well, I was going
to say "deliberate".

152
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,160
I can tell you they were shot

153
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,164
over and over and over again...
a total of six in one

154
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:22,042
and five in the other at close range
with a large-caliber weapon.

155
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:25,571
Reminiscent of the death
of Billy Clanton

156
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:28,302
- at the O.K. Corral.
- Got something against cowboys, Duck?

157
00:08:28,815 --> 00:08:30,352
Although I've always been

158
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,846
fond of the way that element
manifests itself in you, Jethro,

159
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,589
I have never been
entirely comfortable

160
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,426
with the psychological makeup
of your mentor.

161
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:43,063
But Wyatt Earp was friends with
Doc Holliday, and as they would attest,

162
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,293
there is a fine line between...

163
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:48,819
- cowboy and outlaw.
- And with the level of overkill here,

164
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,446
your conclusion is...

165
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,073
Mike Franks has crossed that line.

166
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:57,828
Too soon to accuse him
of being an unthinking killer, Ducky.

167
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:00,456
No, that's not what I'm saying at all.
It's quite the opposite.

168
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:03,893
I think a great deal of thought
went into these killings

169
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:07,129
and the staging of the crime scene.

170
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,202
Staging?

171
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,255
Wood splinters
taken from their backsides.

172
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:17,014
They were dragged
onto the Kelly intentionally.

173
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:20,111
I'd be surprised if anything
about her discovery

174
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,102
was not intentional.

175
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:34,599
I assure you I am using the utmost care
processing your beautiful craftsmanship.

176
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:36,825
It's a craftsman's ship.

177
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,400
- The bodies were moved?
- I have blood trails on the rail and

178
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,263
the deck that suggest
they were at least...

179
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:43,722
slid.
"Slidden"?

180
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,585
Ducky said
that they had been "slud".

181
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,089
- If Ducky said they "slad" them...
- The firefight, Abby, was it on-board?

182
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:53,135
At first glance,
I have a lot of downward vectors.

183
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,327
Downward, meaning standing
over the top.

184
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,856
Execution style, yeah.

185
00:09:58,427 --> 00:10:01,976
So I'm trying to find corresponding
slugs for all the spent .45 casings.

186
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:05,729
I would say that it ended here,
but it may not be where it started.

187
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,775
Another bullet grazed the port side.
It's smaller caliber than the others.

188
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:13,779
- .22.
- Could be.

189
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:16,976
. 22s deteriorate significantly
on impact,

190
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:19,034
so there's no slug
and it's below the waterline.

191
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:23,038
Boat wasn't in the water
during the shoot-out.

192
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:26,706
Maybe, or maybe somebody
was using it for target practice.

193
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:29,935
It's one of many inconsistencies
that have to be addressed.

194
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:32,972
There's the angles
of trajectory to calculate,

195
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:34,806
And all
of the unaccounted-for slugs...

196
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,767
I still have to dig them out
of the woodwork...

197
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:39,096
I mean, I have to carefully

198
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,634
- extract them from the woodwork.
- Take it apart.

199
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:44,245
Are you sure?

200
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:49,356
Similar-size deposits
on roughly the same dates

201
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,458
suggest that Blanchard and Keenan
worked together,

202
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,152
but the receipts are all cash.

203
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,159
Can't make a financial link
to Franks.

204
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:59,378
Now, why would two bad guys
go after Mike Franks?

205
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:01,923
Well, clearly,
they don't know him very well.

206
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:04,997
Interesting theory, McGee.

207
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:06,844
I meant that more as a joke.

208
00:11:07,158 --> 00:11:10,085
Some of the greatest ideas
in history started out as jokes.

209
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:13,041
I mean, look,
you got your mood ring, pet rock,

210
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:14,182
spork.

211
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:15,841
Those were all terrible ideas.

212
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,010
Yes.

213
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,802
Terrible ideas

214
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,305
that turned their inventors
into drillionaires.

215
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,098
And that is
the American dream, Ziva.

216
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,229
And that's why you're never going
to pass that test.

217
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:28,412
The heart of America is
that any idiot can become a success?

218
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,088
That is exactly right 'cause we don't
live in an aristocracy or a meritocracy.

219
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,444
- Neither does Israel.
- We just have our capitalist democracy.

220
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:37,856
Which means that you might be
a pauper today,

221
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,783
you might be living a life
of wall-to-wall desperation.

222
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:42,513
You might have no friends,

223
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:45,079
no prospects, no brain, no hope.

224
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:46,376
But tomorrow?

225
00:11:47,342 --> 00:11:49,566
Tomorrow, you might win the lottery.

226
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:52,220
You might slip
on the right driveway.

227
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:55,005
Tomorrow.
Just like Annie sang.

228
00:11:56,036 --> 00:11:58,180
The Comic Strip.
<i>Little orphan Annie</i>.

229
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:01,762
Curly red hair, no eyeballs.
Adopted by Daddy Warbucks.

230
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:03,806
And that's
the American dream right there.

231
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,517
<i>Little orphan Annie</i>.
And me.

232
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:09,367
Isn't there an essay section
on this citizenship exam?

233
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:11,855
You should be writing
this stuff down. It's good.

234
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:15,364
Shame.
My pencil broke.

235
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:17,269
Destruction
of U.S. Government property.

236
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,135
That's not going to look
too good on the...

237
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,156
Boss, we've been researching
the dead guys.

238
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:24,118
- McGee had an interesting idea.
- What was that exactly?

239
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,820
Because you just started talking
bunch of nonsense and never actually

240
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,205
- said what you were thinking.
- What I was thinking, Boss,

241
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,667
is maybe they didn't know
Franks... at all.

242
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:32,632
You know?

243
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,260
- Find the connection.
- But maybe they...

244
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,599
It's okay.

245
00:12:56,813 --> 00:12:57,640
We're here.

246
00:12:58,824 --> 00:12:59,749
Look, Amira.

247
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,853
It's your godfather.
Can you say hi?

248
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,906
Hello, Amira.

249
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:04,677
Welcome to my home.

250
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:09,705
He's right behind us.

251
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:14,793
You can put her down in there.

252
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:19,453
Thank you.

253
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:31,625
You going to stand there
glaring at me, probie,

254
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,520
or you going to give me
a hand with the bags?

255
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:35,647
Or you going to shoot me?

256
00:13:36,177 --> 00:13:38,108
No, I thought I'd ask you
a few questions first.

257
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,169
- Then, I may shoot you.
- All right.

258
00:13:40,378 --> 00:13:42,237
- Need some answers, Mike.
- All right!

259
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:45,111
Keep your voice down.

260
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,493
Those two men you killed...

261
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,244
Why were they after you?

262
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:51,163
Damn, probie.

263
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,281
I was hoping you could tell me.

264
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:04,082
Saturday, I popped
in the cantina for a mescal.

265
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:07,548
The bartender, Eddie, tells me

266
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,875
a couple of guys
had been asking around.

267
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:13,770
Looking for a gringo and two girls.

268
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:18,482
Claims he did his best...
to lead them astray.

269
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:20,457
You didn't know them.

270
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:23,113
I'd never seen either of their faces
before they showed up

271
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:24,655
on my beach Monday afternoon.

272
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:26,613
But you were ready for them.

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,675
I knew what they wanted.

274
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,036
I could see the cannons
tucked in their backs.

275
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:32,609
Don't even think about it.

276
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:40,254
I didn't feel great using
Amira's boat like that.

277
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:44,351
But I couldn't risk
being investigated by strangers...

278
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:46,760
Or worse even, the Federales.

279
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:50,889
So, you steered them at the Navy.

280
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:54,810
If you're going to be investigated,
better it be by a friend.

281
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:56,654
Thanks for the honor.

282
00:14:56,714 --> 00:14:58,188
You don't sound too grateful.

283
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:00,332
You know, Mike...

284
00:15:02,963 --> 00:15:06,953
I'm used to shells and bodies
and cover-ups as your big finale.

285
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:10,993
Something starts off like this, I don't
even want to think about the count.

286
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:14,634
You can't pin all them
past capers on me, probie.

287
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,873
Not all them messes were mine.

288
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:19,376
Where was Leyla and Amira?

289
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,915
You don't think I'd...

290
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,392
start throwing shots
with my daughter-in-law

291
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:27,004
and my granddaughter not
safely tucked away, do you?

292
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:30,661
- I'm not a child.
- No, you definitely are not.

293
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,014
Calling me old?

294
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,516
I'm saying there comes a time
to hang up your spurs.

295
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,022
I won't need you or anybody
to tell me when that is I'll know

296
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,669
'cause I'll be dead.

297
00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:43,859
I hate when you talk like that.

298
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,157
I wouldn't do anything...

299
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,407
to put my girls in danger.

300
00:15:50,945 --> 00:15:52,451
That's why I brought them here.

301
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,620
And if you can't find out

302
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,581
who's after me and why,
then I've got no choice, but to...

303
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:01,001
- Do not say it.
- Ain't I allowed to say anything?

304
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:04,184
He's threatening to leave us.

305
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,269
He says it is the only way
to keep us safe to stay away.

306
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:12,537
When Liam died...

307
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:15,542
I made a promise

308
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,605
to my son and to myself.

309
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:20,562
I protect my family.

310
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:25,359
Well, from here on,
you leave it to the professionals.

311
00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:28,862
These two guys are professionals.

312
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,311
Or were.

313
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:32,991
PMCs...
private military contractors.

314
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:35,035
According to a Captain Hazelton

315
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,119
we spoke to, one of his former
classmates, Blanchard, cracked up.

316
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:40,374
Before he could get his act together,
he was out the door.

317
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:43,110
- Keenan?
- Lot of problems with authority.

318
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:45,768
Well, at least according
to every authority...

319
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,756
- we spoke to.
- They both got kicked out

320
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,921
of their respective services,
but they both found new homes in...

321
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:52,251
Oh, new homes.

322
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:54,865
"Give me your tired,
your poor, your huddled masses

323
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:56,306
yearning to breathe free..."

324
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,436
The wretched refuse ended up
on a different teeming shore.

325
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:03,689
Working for this man, Chief...

326
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:06,430
Operating Officer
of first defense PMC,

327
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,585
Colonel Merton Bell.

328
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:11,613
Bell's based out of Virginia.
He's a former tank Commander.

329
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,199
Runs the largest PMC operating
in the Middle East.

330
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:16,993
Armed security forces protecting
mostly corporate employers.

331
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:20,868
He also has governmental contracts,
American and otherwise.

332
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:23,709
- Securing reconstruction projects.
- Bring him in.

333
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:25,043
Hold up a second.

334
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:28,213
You guys got a location
on Mike Franks?

335
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:31,717
No. They don't.

336
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,900
Franks wasn't living
alone on that beach.

337
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,599
He's been with a young woman
for almost three years now.

338
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:42,115
His daughter-in-law, Leyla Shakarji.

339
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,438
And her daughter, Amira.

340
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:48,087
You telling me we can't find
a fugitive on the run

341
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:50,109
with an Iraqi woman and a child?

342
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,584
I'm saying we've kept
our attention on the dead men.

343
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:57,909
And now you want to drag
in Colonel Merton Bell.

344
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,050
- And that's not all right with you.
- No.

345
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:03,331
Do I need to explain my problem?

346
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:08,912
I thought that you were going
to give me some room on this.

347
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:10,347
I was, and I am.

348
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:13,550
But I know Colonel Bell.
We have friends in common on the Hill.

349
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,480
Then, this is about politics.

350
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,888
Your approach lacks finesse.

351
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:18,949
Finesse.

352
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:21,818
You could show him the same courtesy
I showed you when this case began.

353
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,020
- You mean rub his nose in it?
- You can go heavy if you want,

354
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,604
but we're talking about the man
with the largest private collection

355
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:29,863
of legally obtained hardware
in the United States.

356
00:18:30,294 --> 00:18:32,319
He's got Black Hawks
in his front yard.

357
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,398
Are you worried I'm too blunt, Leon?

358
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:38,046
You are transparent. Two of his men
are dead. You know who killed them.

359
00:18:38,106 --> 00:18:40,702
I don't want Bell to get the impression
that we're harboring a murderer.

360
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,385
Why would he jump
to that conclusion?

361
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:45,332
You don't appear to be devoting too much
time in tracking down his killer.

362
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:47,840
If I were Bell,
that might make me nervous.

363
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:50,165
Hell, if I were me,
that might make me nervous.

364
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:55,564
Mike Franks and his family
are at my house.

365
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:00,263
And you were about to send your agents
over there to keep an eye on them.

366
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:04,083
Sure... while I find
a more delicate way

367
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,727
to approach Colonel Bell.

368
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:09,856
That be anything you want
to help me with, maybe?

369
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:13,405
It's like we were reading
each other's minds.

370
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:16,725
Hello?

371
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:20,849
- Should have told me you were coming.
- I called, and you didn't pick up.

372
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,817
Not going to answer the phone...
I'm a fugitive.

373
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:24,493
- What do you want me to do?
- Knock.

374
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,249
Why would I knock?
There's no lock on that door.

375
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:29,501
Someone may be
on the other side with a gun.

376
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,253
Why would one be standing
with a gun?

377
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,043
Because there's no lock on the door.

378
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:35,121
This has been very educational,
gentlemen.

379
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:37,092
Lady Ziva, glad you're here.

380
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,330
Gibbs send you?

381
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,428
We have been instructed
to sit on the baby.

382
00:19:41,094 --> 00:19:43,723
Going to be fine, Mike,
and it's good to see you. Have a mint.

383
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,130
Got your marching orders, too.

384
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,728
McGee is waiting outside
to drive you to NCIS.

385
00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:50,105
Are you leaving?

386
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:52,529
You heard the man.

387
00:19:53,597 --> 00:19:54,895
It's going to be fine.

388
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:57,779
This is for the best.

389
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:06,175
Why don't you put something
in front of the door.

390
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:08,665
No, I'll just stand here
with my gun.

391
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:15,505
That guy.

392
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:18,434
I'm back and forth to Iraq
and Afghanistan so much,

393
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:20,434
it's practically
my office now, Leon.

394
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:23,090
- Thank you.
- Sure.

395
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:26,850
Keenan and Blanchard
were over there?

396
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:29,019
Public interface, mainly.

397
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:32,329
We meet with the local tribal leaders
on a weekly basis,

398
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:33,815
get a sense of what's going on.

399
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,443
- Threats to look out for.
- No, it's not all negative.

400
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,957
Sometimes, the chatter
is a little more innocuous.

401
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:41,686
People talk about a need
to build a new school.

402
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,817
Gives us an opportunity
to combine our efforts.

403
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,848
Increases our odds of success.

404
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:48,716
They were good at their jobs?

405
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,350
I'm sure I don't detect
a note of surprise in your voice,

406
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,576
Special Agent Gibbs.

407
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,377
All my men are outstanding.

408
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,630
United States Armed Forces
disagrees.

409
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,712
My company may not adhere
to the same...

410
00:21:02,151 --> 00:21:04,350
some might say punitive...
restrictions.

411
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,690
Nevertheless, we seem to be picking up
more and more of their responsibilities.

412
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:12,012
Every time the U.S. reduces
the number of troops deployed,

413
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:14,893
- you have to increase your hires.
- Gibbs.

414
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:16,944
It's understandable, Director.

415
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:20,111
Jarheads and Mercs
are like oil and water.

416
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:24,288
Although, I've got some of my best men
off the Marine Corps scrap heap.

417
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:27,869
The men you hire have histories
of violence, insubordination,

418
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:29,219
mental problems.

419
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,357
What do you have to do
to be disqualified?

420
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:34,858
If you intend to cast aspersions
on the names of two dead men...

421
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,070
two of my men...

422
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,214
I'd prefer you just cut to the chase
and ask the real question.

423
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:41,879
Okay. Did you know two
of your men were in Mexico

424
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:43,732
carrying weapons you furnished?

425
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:46,680
Of course I did. They informed me
when they accepted the contract.

426
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,268
They were carrying out
a contract on Mike Franks?

427
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:53,228
Who the hell is Mike Franks?

428
00:21:59,158 --> 00:22:01,189
Well, thank you
for your cooperation, Colonel Bell.

429
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,989
I expect you'll keep me apprised,
Director.

430
00:22:04,552 --> 00:22:06,282
Justice needs to be done here.

431
00:22:10,142 --> 00:22:11,347
Is that the bad guy?

432
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:16,001
Hey, probie, is that the guy
that put the hit on me?

433
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:22,048
No one was after you.

434
00:22:22,997 --> 00:22:23,751
What?

435
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,094
You were just
the only lead they had.

436
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:30,681
- Who's they?
- Leyla and Amira's family from Iraq.

437
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:32,851
They hired those two PMCs
to find them.

438
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:35,770
And you killed 'em.

439
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,101
You want to know...

440
00:22:38,347 --> 00:22:40,150
who the real bad guy is here, Mike?

441
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:44,096
Go look in the damn mirror.

442
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:53,356
You don't look very remorseful.

443
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:55,890
- About what?
- These two men were hired

444
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,084
by your daughter-in-law's family
to find her.

445
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,048
There's no reason to believe
that they meant her or you any harm.

446
00:23:02,968 --> 00:23:04,130
It appears...

447
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:06,384
you killed them in cold blood.

448
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,075
That how it appears to you?

449
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,684
I can't say how it went, Mike.
I wasn't there.

450
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,770
You were there
when Leyla first came over.

451
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:19,481
You know a thing
or two about her family.

452
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:23,109
- They disowned her.
- Disowned her.

453
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:26,654
Because she got pregnant
by my son, Liam.

454
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:28,443
That's not family.

455
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:31,217
Those two guys were doing
Shada Shakarji's bidding.

456
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,814
Don't expect me to cry for them.

457
00:23:33,151 --> 00:23:35,538
- Shada Shakarji is Leyla's family?
- Her mother.

458
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,985
Hard-as-nails matriarch of one
of the most prominent tribes in Iraq.

459
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,879
It's unorthodox for a woman to be
in that position of prominence.

460
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,840
Didn't exactly run for the office.

461
00:23:46,387 --> 00:23:47,884
Shada buried her father,

462
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:50,261
her brothers and her husband

463
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:51,873
in the war with Iran.

464
00:23:52,593 --> 00:23:54,766
Lost her oldest son to Saddam,

465
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,685
- and a couple of more since.
- Family was about out of men.

466
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,562
But not memory.

467
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,798
She's a vindictive old sow.

468
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,359
And when Amty Shada cuts you off,

469
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:07,338
you're not supposed
to get a happily-ever-after

470
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:08,696
on a beach in Mexico.

471
00:24:09,678 --> 00:24:12,259
She's willing to pay
to drag 'em back home?

472
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:15,620
She's not gonna flinch
at a couple of dead guns for hire.

473
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,673
- What did you use?
- What?

474
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:23,746
What did you use?!

475
00:24:24,908 --> 00:24:26,798
- .45.
- How many shots?

476
00:24:30,332 --> 00:24:32,064
I used the boat as a decoy.

477
00:24:32,124 --> 00:24:34,264
Left the radio on the deck
and an open beer.

478
00:24:34,854 --> 00:24:36,349
They went for it with guns drawn.

479
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:39,894
Emptied my mag from the porch, put two
in the big guy and three in the other.

480
00:24:40,215 --> 00:24:42,330
Reloaded, dragged 'em on-board,

481
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,560
and gave 'em each three more
for good measure.

482
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,152
It was self-defense.

483
00:24:56,557 --> 00:24:57,735
Take his statement.

484
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:07,213
The evidence better confirm
every bit of it.

485
00:25:19,982 --> 00:25:21,311
Abby, what are you doing?

486
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:28,109
- What are you doing?
- He told me to do it.

487
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:31,112
I had to do it. But I'm trying
to do it like an archaeologist.

488
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,473
I'm keeping careful notes
of where everything came from,

489
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,932
And I'm sure I can put it back
together again when I'm done.

490
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,535
You're using a chainsaw!

491
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,787
Well, it's not like
there was a zipper.

492
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,539
I mean, I was hoping for a zipper,

493
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,417
or some sort of system
of... dowels and slots.

494
00:25:44,702 --> 00:25:46,127
Please tell me it was worth it.

495
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:48,882
I found a secret stash box.

496
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:51,515
Grease residue suggests
that Franks kept a gun in there.

497
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:53,221
The guy keeps a gun everywhere.

498
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:55,107
Took us 15 minutes
to get through security.

499
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:56,930
Franks was smuggling a piece?

500
00:25:57,204 --> 00:25:58,667
- Was it a .22?
- No.

501
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:01,977
It was a... saw blade curled
in the hollowed-out heel of his boot.

502
00:26:02,037 --> 00:26:04,103
.22? I don't think he carries
anything that small.

503
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:08,039
I found this mangled piece of lead

504
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,692
embedded deep in the floorboards.

505
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,045
I think it's two slugs smashed together.
Like boom-boom.

506
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,275
- One bullet hit another bullet?
- Yeah.

507
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:18,122
- It's an impossible shot.
- Yeah,

508
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,578
if they were both
in the air at the same time.

509
00:26:24,864 --> 00:26:26,209
It's a bullet in a bullet?

510
00:26:26,623 --> 00:26:28,002
Abby's analyzing it now,

511
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,838
but if it is a piece
of a .22 in a .45, then...

512
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:34,105
<i>You broke up there.</i>
What are you saying?

513
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:36,344
I can't hear you, McGee.
I'm in the basement.

514
00:26:36,824 --> 00:26:37,644
Why?

515
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,921
'cause I don't want to talk about
the case in front of Leyla and the kid.

516
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:43,881
<i>Listen, Tony,</i>
this is really important.

517
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,104
I need you to check
the seams of the walls.

518
00:26:46,724 --> 00:26:47,540
The walls?

519
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,530
<i>Well, do they appear
to be removable?</i>

520
00:26:51,673 --> 00:26:52,777
Or a tunnel maybe.

521
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,900
<i>Could be hidden underneath
something on the floor.</i>

522
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,019
<i>Something that looks like
it doesn't belong.</i>

523
00:26:58,314 --> 00:27:02,300
Actually, I think Colonel Hogan
has got a radio in the coffee pot,

524
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,510
but the tunnel
might have been filled in.

525
00:27:04,688 --> 00:27:06,708
<i>I saw </i>a video on the Internet
once where this guy...

526
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,835
he built a Lamborghini
in his basement,

527
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,880
they had to pull off half
the house to get it out.

528
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,673
Was that a ding?

529
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,915
I think we've got another shooter.

530
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,015
You have very peaceful eyes, Amira.

531
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,517
- Do you know that?
- Yes, she does.

532
00:27:26,508 --> 00:27:29,417
I left Iraq because I didn't want
to expose her

533
00:27:29,477 --> 00:27:31,107
to the violence I saw as a child.

534
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:35,705
I want that peace
to last in her eyes forever.

535
00:27:36,218 --> 00:27:38,573
You made difficult choices
for both of you.

536
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:42,281
Sometimes the most significant...

537
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:44,620
moments happen in your life
without any choice at all.

538
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:48,432
Like your father.

539
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,951
I knew the cost of even talking
to Liam, but I couldn't help it.

540
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:55,835
The feeling was irresistible.

541
00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:57,175
It was love at first sight.

542
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,053
Maybe.

543
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:02,680
Do you miss your homeland?

544
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:07,435
It was difficult
to leave it all behind.

545
00:28:08,783 --> 00:28:10,951
But the right reasons
made it easier.

546
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:13,349
Ziva's trying to pick up
and start over again.

547
00:28:13,957 --> 00:28:16,152
Rebuild... again.

548
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:25,578
What's your place like in Mexico?

549
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,329
It is simple.

550
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,917
Just enough room
for the three of us.

551
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,107
Were you inside when the...

552
00:28:36,055 --> 00:28:37,277
When it started?

553
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:41,681
What did you do?

554
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,155
I did what any mother would do.

555
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:47,850
I ran to my daughter.

556
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,395
Where was she?

557
00:28:57,644 --> 00:28:58,431
Leyla,

558
00:28:58,932 --> 00:28:59,926
where was Amira?

559
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:09,455
Shada Shakarji has become
one of the most outspoken voices

560
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,833
of the Iraqi tribes
during the past few years.

561
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,927
And she's suffered for it.
Lots of enemies among the old guard.

562
00:29:15,608 --> 00:29:17,463
- I can tell you all of this.
- Keep writing.

563
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:21,544
Bombing last year.
Killed 40, including her oldest son,

564
00:29:21,604 --> 00:29:24,911
believed to be the target. Increased
security considerably since then.

565
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,855
That's where she came in contact
with first defense PMC.

566
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:29,366
And Colonel Bell.

567
00:29:31,785 --> 00:29:32,687
Gibbs' desk.

568
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,376
Ducky, for you.

569
00:29:35,436 --> 00:29:36,993
<i>Is he around? It's rather important.</i>

570
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:39,359
Yeah, Duck.

571
00:29:39,907 --> 00:29:41,560
<i>Would you come down please?</i>

572
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,419
All right.

573
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:50,105
Ah, Jethro.

574
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:53,162
You know we have enormous
respect for you,

575
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:55,497
and for the loyalty

576
00:29:55,557 --> 00:29:58,171
that you exhibit
towards your friends.

577
00:30:00,293 --> 00:30:02,133
We love you very,

578
00:30:02,627 --> 00:30:03,537
very much.

579
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:05,261
What the hell is this?

580
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,971
This is an intervention.

581
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:09,348
Your own history with Mike Franks

582
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,826
is having a blinding effect

583
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,224
on your skill as an investigator.

584
00:30:14,284 --> 00:30:16,115
It's too much for any man to take.

585
00:30:16,175 --> 00:30:19,192
I mean... I mean, he busted the gut.
The guy's a gut-buster.

586
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:22,361
He's like a six-foot hero, like...
like, like the sandwich,

587
00:30:22,675 --> 00:30:24,947
not... he's not six foot,
and he's-he's not a hero.

588
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,125
He's lying to us.

589
00:30:27,185 --> 00:30:29,972
It's insulting enough when people
that we don't know try this stuff.

590
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,035
But a colleague, I mean,
a supposed friend... it's...

591
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:35,373
Well, it's-it's simply a betrayal.

592
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,505
.45 slug, .45 slug,

593
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:39,862
.45 slug, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

594
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,839
The pathways they took...

595
00:30:42,077 --> 00:30:43,411
through the bodies...

596
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:46,391
all of them straight downwards.

597
00:30:46,863 --> 00:30:48,726
Yes, incredibly destructive.

598
00:30:48,978 --> 00:30:50,217
We also found this.

599
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:51,766
Partial .22 slug.

600
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:53,017
And there's more.

601
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:56,521
We believe
that what happened was this.

602
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:59,250
Somebody else shot them...
with a rifle.

603
00:30:59,803 --> 00:31:00,775
A .22 long.

604
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:03,487
And then Franks shot
through the gunshot wounds

605
00:31:03,547 --> 00:31:05,738
of the already-dead men
to destroy the evidence.

606
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:08,287
Mike Franks...

607
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:10,581
did not kill these guys.

608
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:23,150
Careful. I've been writing
on this thing all day.

609
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,454
I was just about to sign it.

610
00:31:28,702 --> 00:31:30,818
My second year,
we caught a case, you and I.

611
00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:34,176
A Sergeant and his best friend...

612
00:31:35,002 --> 00:31:37,061
took his little boy Duck-hunting
for the first time.

613
00:31:37,697 --> 00:31:40,189
Geese. They were chasing wild geese.

614
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,442
I know, Mike.
You made that joke a few times.

615
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:44,863
You laughed each time.

616
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:46,737
Well, I had to,
I worked for you then.

617
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:48,573
Not anymore.

618
00:31:50,565 --> 00:31:53,514
That Sergeant dragged
his friend home that day...

619
00:31:53,574 --> 00:31:54,745
missing half his chest.

620
00:31:55,925 --> 00:31:56,716
Dead.

621
00:31:57,326 --> 00:31:58,759
Birdshot everywhere.

622
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:01,984
Shotgun blast, close range.

623
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:05,397
Nothing accidental about it.
But you wouldn't charge him.

624
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:09,670
It was accidental.

625
00:32:10,504 --> 00:32:12,448
Little boy's gun went off.

626
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:14,943
Shot that guy
right through the heart.

627
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:20,229
And I've been thinking
about that a lot lately.

628
00:32:21,612 --> 00:32:22,753
That Sergeant...

629
00:32:23,392 --> 00:32:25,926
standing over the body
of his best friend.

630
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:29,329
His ten-year-old son's
just killed him.

631
00:32:29,612 --> 00:32:32,450
He's feeling like it's his fault.

632
00:32:33,104 --> 00:32:34,895
Like he failed them both.

633
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,331
Only one thing left for him to do.

634
00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:42,168
And that's to protect his son
from what's coming next.

635
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:46,437
Put his shotgun into the wound.
And fires.

636
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,975
He's thinkin' he'll take
the bullet himself.

637
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:00,270
This ain't going to work.

638
00:33:07,874 --> 00:33:09,016
When'd you figure it?

639
00:33:10,995 --> 00:33:11,832
Boss?

640
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:13,950
You wanted me to let you know

641
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:17,027
if I found anything interesting
about Shada Shakarji.

642
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:19,543
According
to this flight information,

643
00:33:19,603 --> 00:33:21,773
she's on a commercial plane
right now.

644
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:24,585
Grandma's on her way to D.C.

645
00:33:35,437 --> 00:33:37,175
I am Shada Shakarji.

646
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,290
Welcome to Washington.

647
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:43,854
Car's right out front.

648
00:33:46,054 --> 00:33:47,232
What is she doing here?

649
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:49,485
Just taking a hands-on approach
with her daughter.

650
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:51,949
Her first attempt lacked in finesse.

651
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:56,905
How's the statement coming, Mike?

652
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:00,454
It was a load of crap.

653
00:34:00,682 --> 00:34:02,999
- Probie called me on it.
- You lied to us?

654
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,161
I'm sure you're shocked
and appalled, Director.

655
00:34:06,221 --> 00:34:07,253
I'm relieved.

656
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,220
Of all your unsavory character traits,
I find that one the most palatable.

657
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,222
At least there aren't
anymore bodies.

658
00:34:13,282 --> 00:34:14,470
There might be.

659
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,845
If you turn her loose.

660
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,967
What are we going to hold her on, Mike?
She hasn't committed a crime.

661
00:34:20,596 --> 00:34:21,892
Conspiracy to be a bitch?

662
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:25,320
It's one thing
he told the truth about.

663
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,677
He is protecting his family.

664
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:31,902
Well, I guess that's what this is.

665
00:34:32,692 --> 00:34:34,315
It's a family thing.

666
00:34:37,172 --> 00:34:40,763
Why don't you get in there and see
if you can work it out with the in-laws.

667
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,539
You do still know your way
around the room, don't you?

668
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:09,565
You know who I am.

669
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,890
The Greeks would call you Charon.

670
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:16,551
Your boat conducts the dead to hell.

671
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,602
Leaving a trail of misery
in your wake.

672
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:21,744
Yeah, Lady.

673
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:25,611
And you're all smiles and sunshine.

674
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:29,876
I've been tracking your every move

675
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,779
since the day your accursed offspring
ruined my daughter.

676
00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:38,384
<i>- I have never hit a woman, but...
- I find that</i>

677
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,013
- hard to believe.
- I'm finding it hard to believe

678
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,391
you're actually a woman.

679
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,768
You manipulative, stubborn hag!

680
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,982
You hide my family from me.

681
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:53,943
You disowned them.

682
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:55,528
So?

683
00:35:59,613 --> 00:36:00,658
Things change.

684
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:05,123
I have lost too much...

685
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:07,615
family that I can never get back.

686
00:36:09,372 --> 00:36:11,539
She is my child.

687
00:36:12,189 --> 00:36:14,377
And the little girl
is my granddaughter.

688
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:17,049
My blood.

689
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:27,058
<i>You sent gunmen to abduct Leyla</i>

690
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:29,728
and Amira. What were your intentions?
To punish them?

691
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,040
To rescue.

692
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:33,941
From you.

693
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:39,637
If there is a chance to reconcile,

694
00:36:39,815 --> 00:36:41,344
I am willing to...

695
00:36:42,726 --> 00:36:44,368
travel the distance.

696
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,873
You put them in jeopardy.

697
00:36:50,114 --> 00:36:53,512
It would never have turned violent...
I was assured of it...

698
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,964
If not for you.

699
00:36:56,024 --> 00:36:57,506
I got news for you, Lady.

700
00:36:58,524 --> 00:37:00,259
I didn't pull a gun on them.

701
00:37:01,257 --> 00:37:02,887
<i>I didn't fire the first shot.</i>

702
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:06,157
Shut up.

703
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:08,017
I don't believe you.

704
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,629
I'm not proud to cop to this.

705
00:37:12,943 --> 00:37:14,283
I wasn't ready for them.

706
00:37:14,343 --> 00:37:17,151
I didn't get tipped off.
Hell, I never even heard them coming.

707
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:20,826
Your... defenses were down?

708
00:37:23,053 --> 00:37:26,327
I was playing with my granddaughter.

709
00:37:27,598 --> 00:37:29,074
We were up in the boat,

710
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:32,086
She wanted to paint
her name on the side.

711
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:35,544
Then these two guys
are standing there.

712
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,498
Pointing guns up at me.

713
00:37:38,566 --> 00:37:40,049
Leyla noticed 'em from the house.

714
00:37:41,655 --> 00:37:42,676
My Leyla?

715
00:37:43,885 --> 00:37:46,221
My meek, quiet, little girl?

716
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:49,670
Unloaded six shots rapid-fire
from a .22 huntin' rifle.

717
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:51,227
Five hits.

718
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,563
She knows to shoot?

719
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,565
<i>I taught her.</i>

720
00:37:57,258 --> 00:38:00,819
Never underestimate a mama bear
when her cub's in danger.

721
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,001
That I believe.

722
00:38:09,063 --> 00:38:11,063
They're safer with me

723
00:38:11,513 --> 00:38:12,706
than they are with you.

724
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:14,864
I can't

725
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,544
let you pull them back
into the fold.

726
00:38:19,945 --> 00:38:21,516
What? What is it?

727
00:38:25,132 --> 00:38:26,595
I made payment already.

728
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:32,017
Colonel Bell assures me
that the contract will be completed.

729
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:39,668
She went up the ladder
after the first guys failed.

730
00:38:39,728 --> 00:38:41,974
Directly to Bell.
Guy's got nothing but his name.

731
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:45,103
He takes the hit if he takes a job,
can't get it done.

732
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,951
With that chip on his shoulder,
not even she can call him off.

733
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:51,704
- Got it, Gibbs.
- Trouble brewing?

734
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,223
- Where's Amira?
- She's upstairs, sleeping.

735
00:38:55,442 --> 00:38:56,311
All right.

736
00:38:58,141 --> 00:38:59,321
Take her downstairs.

737
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,156
Wait.
You know how to shoot?

738
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:02,789
Yes, she does.

739
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,846
Look out!

740
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:13,933
Go, go!
Get down on the floor!

741
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:16,353
Hands where I can see 'em!

742
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,897
- Get eyes on...
- Stay down!

743
00:39:19,076 --> 00:39:21,296
Don't move!
Keep looking at the floor!

744
00:39:22,762 --> 00:39:24,528
- We're secure.
- Ziva?

745
00:39:24,914 --> 00:39:26,655
- Is that you?
- Damon?

746
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,532
Wait a second, you know this guy?

747
00:39:29,554 --> 00:39:32,828
Corporal Damon Werth.
USMC. Dishonorably discharged.

748
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:37,288
- Give me your hands!
- What are you doing here?

749
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,977
- This is Gibbs' living room.
- What are you doing here?

750
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:42,546
Rescuing a kidnapped little girl
and her mother.

751
00:39:42,996 --> 00:39:44,318
I'm sorry to tell you,

752
00:39:44,378 --> 00:39:46,842
but you're actually abducting them.

753
00:39:46,962 --> 00:39:49,476
Hey, Werth. Cut the chitchat,
just secure the prisoner.

754
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,929
We're making a mistake.

755
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,724
Bell's got a lotta money riding
on this job. We're gonna finish it...

756
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,741
I think we should hear them out.
Don't you?

757
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,505
You get the girls, Corporal?
You finish the job?

758
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,048
I'm finished with the job, Sir.

759
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,761
- What have you done, son?
- I quit.

760
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:34,316
And that's a shame,
because he's a pretty loyal guy, too.

761
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:38,018
Made a mess out of my house. Somebody's
going to have to clean that up.

762
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,994
You want to go punch for punch
with me, Gibbs?

763
00:40:41,062 --> 00:40:43,150
Keep in mind,
I got a big arsenal behind me.

764
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,275
I wouldn't worry,
your suit covers it up very nicely.

765
00:40:46,138 --> 00:40:49,393
Sorry, I'm a little wacky, 'cause
of the flash-bang your boys threw at us.

766
00:40:49,676 --> 00:40:52,658
Perhaps my men were over exuberant
in the pursuit of their task.

767
00:40:53,265 --> 00:40:56,375
Personally, however,
I have not broken any laws.

768
00:40:56,615 --> 00:40:57,673
U.S. Laws.

769
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,124
But the Federales
want to talk to you.

770
00:41:00,897 --> 00:41:03,252
Yeah, turns out bounty hunting
is illegal South of the border.

771
00:41:03,568 --> 00:41:04,837
God bless Mexico.

772
00:41:07,075 --> 00:41:08,917
I tell my men, you take a swing,

773
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,802
make sure you connect hard enough
to put the other guy down.

774
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,414
Good advice.
Put your hands behind your back.

775
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,918
Should also tell 'em
to get a haircut.

776
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:30,529
You... think the grandparents
can work this out?

777
00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:37,217
My dad told me a story once,

778
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,474
dates back maybe...

779
00:41:41,538 --> 00:41:43,000
30 years after the civil war.

780
00:41:43,758 --> 00:41:44,512
My...

781
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:46,962
great-great-grandmother
and grandfather

782
00:41:47,477 --> 00:41:49,756
had fathers that fought
on either side.

783
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:53,217
These two old warriors,

784
00:41:53,836 --> 00:41:56,104
they probably shot
at each other on the battlefield.

785
00:41:57,287 --> 00:41:58,390
They couldn't even...

786
00:41:59,563 --> 00:42:01,647
look at each other
at their own kids' wedding.

787
00:42:02,243 --> 00:42:03,050
But...

788
00:42:04,003 --> 00:42:06,400
they did come to live
with each other in the same house.

789
00:42:08,154 --> 00:42:09,151
And they spent...

790
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:12,421
every day
for the rest of their lives...

791
00:42:14,027 --> 00:42:15,431
on the front porch,

792
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,786
in a couple of wicker rocking chairs
rocking back and forth.

793
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:22,623
Here's hoping.

794
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:31,182
We got better things to do
than be the Franks' family counselor.

795
00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:37,554
I guess they worked out
their differences? Your relatives?

796
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,066
- They mellowed with time, right?
- Way I heard it,

797
00:42:42,658 --> 00:42:44,364
those two never said a word.
