2
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:06,258
<i>Agent Afloat, report to the fantail.</i>

3
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:08,462
<i>Agent Afloat,
to the fantail on the double.</i>

4
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:12,791
Coming through.

5
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:14,847
Make a hole.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,526
Look out.

7
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:47,632
Anyone see him jump?

8
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:49,880
- No.
- Anyone?

9
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,288
Nice morning.

10
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:19,295
Beautiful morning.

11
00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:22,181
How's... how's your tea?

12
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:23,462
Fine.

13
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:24,838
Your coffee?

14
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:26,973
It's good.
Good coffee.

15
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,413
- Quiet day?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:35,955
- Quiet week.
- Got a call from DiNozzo.

17
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:37,460
- Tony?
- When?

18
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:40,925
Navy Lieutenant did
a half gainer off the USS Seahawk.

19
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:44,019
- Talk to his wife.
- Does she know?

20
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:45,186
She will.

21
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:49,398
- Shouldn't the Navy send a chaplain?
- Chaplains don't investigate, McGee.

22
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:50,929
Right.

23
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:53,686
Going to need a...
address.

24
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,872
It's going to be tough.

25
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,553
You think it's hard for us?
Imagine what it feels like to be him.

26
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:14,908
- Who him?
- Tony!

27
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:17,124
We're all here and he's still stuck
on that ship.

28
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:18,345
Not Tony, I meant...

29
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,392
Completely alone, away from
all those who care about him.

30
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:26,547
- Wait, you weren't talking about Tony?
- No, I meant it's going to be tough

31
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,521
telling Lyndi Evans
her husband's missing.

32
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:41,071
Her truck's here.

33
00:02:44,577 --> 00:02:45,720
So is she.

34
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:50,840
NCIS Season 6 Episode 2
Agent Afloat Version LOL 1.0

35
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:54,052
Synchro: ¤AkaZab¤ 

36
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:58,139
Thanks Kasius, Bruno and Magic Turtle.

37
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,433
www.Team-NCIS.com

38
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:21,704
It's freezing in here.

39
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:25,206
After four months in the subbasement,
this is cozy.

40
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:27,287
It's like March of The Penguins
down there.

41
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,738
It's a nice place.

42
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,063
Well, I mean, considering...

43
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:37,078
Sorry, Ducky, it's... been a while.

44
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:38,427
Yes, it has.

45
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:41,630
Nasopharyngeal mucosal secretion.

46
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,750
It's snot?

47
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,916
In her hair?

48
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:47,711
Yes, well, perhaps it's a souvenir
left behind by her killer.

49
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:54,190
Looks like we found the murder weapon.
Toy guitar?

50
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:55,769
That is not a toy guitar.

51
00:03:56,378 --> 00:03:58,439
That is a guitar controller

52
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,996
used to play

53
00:04:00,248 --> 00:04:03,370
Lords of Rock video game.
That particular model is called an ax.

54
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:06,140
So our killer is an ax murderer?

55
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:07,417
Unlikely.

56
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,124
This young woman's demise
was caused by blunt force trauma.

57
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:13,342
For Abby, please.

58
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:16,073
Thermostat was set to 40.

59
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:18,876
Yes, and the chilled air
slowed decomposition.

60
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:22,653
I'd estimate this young lady's
been dead for at least five days.

61
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,639
Husband deployed five days ago.

62
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,017
Battle on the home front
before going off to war?

63
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:28,354
Room's a mess.

64
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:30,902
Looks like a violent fight
to the death.

65
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:32,897
What tells you that, McGee?

66
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:35,919
Broken stuff everywhere and
a badly beaten corpse, boss.

67
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:39,447
No broken furniture,
no broken glass underneath the body.

68
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,874
She died where she fell, then the room
was methodically trashed around her.

69
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:46,313
Crime scene was staged to make it
look like a violent fight.

70
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:48,830
Air conditioning was set on low
to slow decomposition

71
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:51,268
in an attempt to disguise
the time of death.

72
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:53,931
I'm sure
I would have figured that out.

73
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,275
Eventually.

74
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,843
You spent way too much time
in the cyber unit.

75
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:01,812
Your crime scene skills
are getting a bit... dusty.

76
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:03,055
Rusty.

77
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:06,357
Here, McGee, see if you
can find something useful on that.

78
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:08,692
That's odd.

79
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:12,181
With the exception of
the severe trauma to the nose,

80
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,643
the swellings on the facial wounds

81
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:16,515
are uncharacteristically low

82
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:19,435
for this type of violent beating,

83
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:23,446
suggesting that the blows
were delivered...

84
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,670
Postmortem.

85
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:29,379
Right?

86
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:42,779
- You need something, Abs?
- Nope,

87
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:45,389
I'm just prepping Tony's desk
for his big return.

88
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:47,347
Do you know something we don't?

89
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:49,340
I just know he's coming back.

90
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:52,529
I don't know how and
I don't know when, but Tony...

91
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:55,711
... is coming back.

92
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:59,124
Hey, get ahold of DiNozzo.

93
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:01,914
Tell him I want to see the records of
the guy who jumped overboard.

94
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:03,504
Pull his service file.

95
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:04,951
Got it, boss.

96
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:09,730
Don't worry, Abs.
Tony's deployment will be over soon.

97
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,443
Maybe they'll transfer him back.

98
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:13,239
Not maybe, McGee.

99
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:15,718
Definitely.

100
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:24,958
Husband overboard, wife murdered.

101
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,992
- That's a big coincidence.
- Not why you called me up here.

102
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:29,808
You're a man down.

103
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:32,782
- Noticed.
- And you want DiNozzo back.

104
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:35,985
Agent DiNozzo has three
more months on the Seahawk.

105
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:39,134
After that,
we'll look for the right fit.

106
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,625
Fits right here.

107
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:46,607
Two San Diego agents.

108
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:49,513
- Both good men.
- I'm sure they are.

109
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:56,223
You decide.

110
00:06:57,437 --> 00:06:58,983
Or if you like, I will.

111
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:14,777
Zilch.
Not even a toothbrush.

112
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:16,898
You looking for something specific,
sir?

113
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:20,098
The reason Lieutenant Evans
didn't bother to unpack.

114
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:22,359
Guess he wasn't planning
on sticking around.

115
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,766
Yet he flew all the way from D.C.
to Cartagena to join the ship.

116
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:30,029
That make sense to you, Lieutenant?

117
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:33,158
- The guy was a head case.
- Thought you never met him.

118
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:34,592
I didn't.

119
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,903
Like I said,
we stood different watches.

120
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,545
But anybody who throws himself
off a ship has got to be crazy.

121
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:41,288
What about your other bunkmate?

122
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,694
Kaplan?

123
00:07:43,986 --> 00:07:46,260
Think he's got a touch of OCD,
but other than that...

124
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,043
- Did he ever meet Lieutenant Evans?
- I never asked.

125
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:52,180
His watch is over.

126
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:54,737
Where is he?

127
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:56,556
Baby!

128
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:59,761
Vaya con Dios, fellas.
I'm out.

129
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:02,365
- OK, call. What do you got?
- 3 seconds until the Agent

130
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:04,570
Afloat sees you're playing for stakes.

131
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:08,073
- Very subtle, Almeida.
- Agent DiNozzo.

132
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:09,980
You want to sit in?

133
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:12,308
Who's Lieutenant Kaplan?

134
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:14,826
Here he is, the guy whose
straight just got flushed...

135
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:17,180
I need to chat with you
about your bunkmate.

136
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:19,057
The mama's boy or Louganis?

137
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,254
Tell me...

138
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:28,436
Tell me about Lieutenant Evans.

139
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:31,711
Only met him once. Logged into
the COM Room during my watch.

140
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:33,835
- You talk to him?
- Didn't get a chance to.

141
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:36,310
- Left an hour later.
- Notice anything odd?

142
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:38,533
Yeah.

143
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:40,924
Evans.
Guy was a nut job.

144
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:43,562
Had that thousand-yard stare.

145
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,637
Look, the guy called it quits, took
a header. What is there to investigate?

146
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:53,661
Message for you, DiNozzo, from D.C.

147
00:08:57,251 --> 00:08:59,519
- Need that D5W, Henley.
- On its way.

148
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:02,212
Dr. Feelgood, how goes it?

149
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:03,731
What now, DiNozzo?

150
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:06,336
Found another sailor you
think's faking their chronic pain?

151
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:09,132
At ease, Nguyen.
I've suspended that investigation...

152
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,722
- for now.
- Because of you, I have fill out

153
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:14,785
a report every time
I dispense an aspirin.

154
00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:16,403
That must be quite a headache.

155
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,519
- I can open up a line.
- I've got it, Henley.

156
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,344
I'd love to sit and chat with you
about your highly questionable

157
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:23,018
prescription-writing practices, but

158
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:25,324
I am here for
Lieutenant Evans' medical records.

159
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:27,849
- Guy who went overboard?
- Yeah, that'd be him, genius.

160
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:30,273
You've already seen his records.

161
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:32,808
And that's the wacky nature
of these cases.

162
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:35,789
They're sort of like cheap luggage:
you think they're close, and then bam!

163
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:39,211
You hit a curb, lose a wheel and
they open up all over again.

164
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:43,238
Maybe you'll get lucky, Doc, and
your little dope-dispensing caper will

165
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:45,520
stay locked up tight like a Samsonite.

166
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,808
Have a good day, gentlemen.

167
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,251
- McGee.
- Trying, boss.

168
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:53,386
Just pull up his service record.

169
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,241
Keating changed all my macros.
My keyboard short...

170
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:59,322
All right,
I'm pulling it up on the plasma.

171
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:02,507
Should we have Keating
sent up from the cyber unit?

172
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:09,532
Lieutenant Chad Evans.
Information Systems Officer.

173
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,531
Completed security systems
training at Fort Mead, Maryland.

174
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,704
Maybe if I reset
the native resolution...

175
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:16,600
Just forget about it, all right?

176
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,903
Received a Navy Commendation
Joint Service Achievement medal.

177
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:22,519
- Good officer.
- Bad saver.

178
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:25,877
Five-star vacations,
brand-new truck, custom furniture.

179
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,043
All charged by his wife.
Pushed his plastic to the limit.

180
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:31,050
Which may have lead to
marital problems.

181
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:34,025
Or murder. Gonna talk to DiNozzo
on the Seahawk.

182
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:37,205
Tony?! When?
Now? Can I talk to him? Please, Gibbs,

183
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:39,932
I just want to tell him that Sister
Rosita, she bowled a 260 last month.

184
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:42,639
- And I finally saw...
- Abby, It's not a social call.

185
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:48,727
- Ziva.
- Want me to join you?

186
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:55,468
Yes! Boss?

187
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:58,369
I got it. I got it, boss.

188
00:10:58,767 --> 00:10:59,782
I got...

189
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:04,851
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,445
<i>Hey, boss, you talk to Vance?</i>

191
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,541
No, I'm talking to you.

192
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,207
<i>Well, come on,
you got to get me off this ship.</i>

193
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:17,742
<i>You have any idea what it's like to be
the only cop aboard a city of 5,000?</i>

194
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:23,067
<i>Well, of course, you do,
but just in case you forgot, it sucks.</i>

195
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:25,845
Tell me about Lieutenant Evans,
DiNozzo.

196
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,213
<i>It's all in the preliminary report
I filed.</i>

197
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,503
<i>You just have to open up your e-mail.
I sent it...</i>

198
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,272
<i>But you'd like me to... to tell you.</i>

199
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,804
<i>Evans boarded in Cartagena
five days ago at 0630.</i>

200
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:40,931
<i>We were underway by 0800. He
reported for duty at 1900 that night.</i>

201
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:44,323
<i>But left an hour later,
claiming he was sick.</i>

202
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:48,332
<i>Found his khakis and his I.D.
on the fantail the next morning.</i>

203
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,939
- No body recovered?
<i>- Not for lack of trying.</i>

204
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:53,459
<i>There was an extensive search.
Nothing.</i>

205
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:55,181
Medical records?

206
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:58,988
<i>Nothing that screams: "I'm gonna kill
my wife and then throw myself overboard"</i>

207
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:02,391
<i>but, uh, it's pretty obvious
what happened, right?</i>

208
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:05,580
<i>Evans kills his wife before he leaves.
Then he joins the ship.</i>

209
00:12:05,763 --> 00:12:07,582
<i>Feels that he can't live
with what he's done.</i>

210
00:12:07,702 --> 00:12:09,005
<i>And then he jumps overboard.</i>

211
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,401
<i>Which is what I'm gonna do
if I don't get off this ship soon.</i>

212
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,488
<i>- McGoo?</i>
- Hey, Tony.

213
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,891
Abby wanted me to tell you
Sister Rosita bowled a two...

214
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:23,454
We ran a check of
Lieutenant Evans' credit card charges.

215
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:26,431
His card was used at
a bar in Cartagena, Colombia.

216
00:12:26,785 --> 00:12:28,289
<i>That's where he boarded the ship?</i>

217
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:31,587
Yeah, only the card was used
three days after the Seahawk departed.

218
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,339
<i>I can hop a COD,
be in Cartagena in two hours, boss.</i>

219
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:43,578
- Two good men.
- Two of my best.

220
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:47,435
I put in a call to the Colombian
National Police in Cartagena.

221
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:50,313
They're looking into
Lieutenant Evans' credit card charges.

222
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:53,399
He could have lost the card. Could
have had it stolen before he boarded.

223
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,339
Or Lieutenant Evans is still alive.

224
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:58,540
That's hard to imagine. They were 100
miles off shore when he went overboard.

225
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,833
DiNozzo spent two weeks in
Cartagena doing threat assessments.

226
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:03,244
He knows the city.

227
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:11,306
One day.

228
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:13,218
Then he flies back to the carrier.

229
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:15,228
You didn't read these files, did you?

230
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:18,133
- Like I said, two good men.
- Your choice?

231
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,171
You sent Ziva to Israel
to follow up on a lead.

232
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,084
You sent McGee to
the basement to crack a code.

233
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:28,495
There is no reason
to assign DiNozzo to a carrier.

234
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:31,923
Seven years as an agent,
I figured it was about time.

235
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,592
You think he screwed
the pooch in L.A.? That it?

236
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:38,175
You sent him to sea to punish him,

237
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:39,992
Leon?

238
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,017
Your choice is noted.

239
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,503
- Hey, Hector!
- Tony!

240
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,850
So, how's the Juan Valdez of
sugar cane?

241
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:06,584
Better when I see a ship
with USS come into port.

242
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:08,811
- It's good to have you back.
- Well,

243
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:10,435
it's just a quickie.

244
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,480
Lorena, she's not singing today.

245
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:17,892
You ever see this guy?

246
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:22,372
Used his credit card
here last week.

247
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,545
You know how many sailors
come into port last week?

248
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:27,858
5,221.

249
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,043
Yes, my friend, and half,
they come here.

250
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,587
Lieutenant Evans, Hector?

251
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,795
You could put his picture on the big
billboard, it makes no difference.

252
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,243
$100 tip on a $50 tab.

253
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:44,054
I think that would be kind of memorable.

254
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,643
I could always tell the <i>policia</i> you
were an accomplice to credit card fraud.

255
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:51,031
- Now, what are they gonna do?
- I saw <i>Romancing the Stone</i>.

256
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,125
Throw you in an alligator pit.

257
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:55,524
Work with me.

258
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,192
He was no sailor.

259
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:01,903
Some matón paid me to use
his credit card.

260
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:03,384
Matón have a name?

261
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:10,166
I'd hate to see the Banana Moon
put on the Navy no-go list.

262
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:11,644
Come on, Tony.

263
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:13,833
I mean, a few hundred less cervezas
a night

264
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:16,351
that's really gonna cut
into your bottom line.

265
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,808
Think about it.

266
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,025
Are we good?

267
00:15:57,469 --> 00:15:58,469
We're good.

268
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:01,911
Where'd you steal the credit card?

269
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:06,447
Tarjeta de credito,
matón.

270
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:08,951
- I find it.
- Where?

271
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:12,780
Over there.

272
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,843
Come on, man.

273
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:43,856
Look, man,
I just took the card.

274
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:45,775
He was already dead.

275
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:08,102
- Boss?
- DiNozzo.

276
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,865
Found Lieutenant Evans.

277
00:17:10,123 --> 00:17:12,034
<i>He didn't fall overboard.
He couldn't have.</i>

278
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:16,080
Judging by the smell, he was dead
before the Seahawk even sailed.

279
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,663
Killer impersonated a Navy Officer

280
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:21,250
to get on board
a United States aircraft carrier.

281
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:24,209
<i>Yeah.</i>
We got a major security breach, boss.

282
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:35,012
Lieutenant Evans was killed
in Cartagena, Captain.

283
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:37,363
<i>Then who the hell boarded my ship?</i>

284
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:39,494
- His killer.
- <i>That's impossible.</i>

285
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:42,193
He used Lieutenant Evans' I.D.
to get on the Seahawk.

286
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:45,062
Then he faked Evans' suicide
once he was onboard.

287
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:47,707
<i>Which means, he's still on the ship.</i>

288
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:51,384
Captain, someone went to a lot
of trouble to become Lieutenant Evans.

289
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:52,313
Why?

290
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:54,458
What were his assigned duties,
Captain?

291
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:57,078
<i>As an IT, Lieutenant Evans' area
of responsibility</i>

292
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,595
<i>was to perform routine tests
on the ship's security.</i>

293
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:01,688
But there has been
no reported breaches.

294
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:02,826
Not yet.

295
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:05,631
<i>I'll increase security on
our weapons systems and the reactor,</i>

296
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,983
<i>and if the son of a bitch
is still on the ship,</i>

297
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:10,502
<i>- we'll find him.</i>
- This will not be a manhunt, Captain.

298
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,353
Last thing you want
to do is to panic him.

299
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:14,292
Dinozzo will conduct his investigation

300
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:15,718
when he returns to the ship.

301
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:19,265
In the meantime, you might want to start
verifying your personnel... discreetly.

302
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:21,123
<i>Consider it done.</i>

303
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:27,889
Pack your bags, Agent Gibbs.
Your boy's going to need some help.

304
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:46,001
<i>Good morning, Agent Keating.</i>

305
00:18:58,366 --> 00:18:59,521
Agent Gibbs' desk.

306
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:02,561
- Back on dry land?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

307
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:04,461
It's a tropical paradise, really.

308
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:06,838
Just like The Blue Lagoon,
except no white sand beaches,

309
00:19:06,975 --> 00:19:09,863
magical waterfalls,
and definitely no Brooke Shields.

310
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:12,488
- I've got some good news for you.
- <i>You're</i> coming to relieve me?

311
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,602
- No, but Vance sent...
<i>- Tequila?</i>

312
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:17,506
I'm going to need at least a case to get
through the next three months here.

313
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:19,087
Is that DiNozzo?

314
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:24,534
<i>Everyone hates me.
You know what?</i>

315
00:19:25,662 --> 00:19:28,289
You better make it two cases.
With<i> Director Vance running things,</i>

316
00:19:28,438 --> 00:19:30,838
<i>I'm going to be Agent Afloating
into my sixties.</i>

317
00:19:31,022 --> 00:19:34,440
- How's it going with him, anyway?
- Couldn't be better, DiNozzo.

318
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:37,339
<i>Director Vance.
I was just...</i>

319
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:39,549
just telling McGee
how much I missed <i>everyone.</i>

320
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:40,695
Sit-rep.

321
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:44,460
<i>Federales</i> turned Lieutenant Evans' body
over to the Cartagena <i>morgue.</i>

322
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,939
<i>I just paid a visit </i>to the coroner. He's
insisting on doing the autopsy himself.

323
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:49,449
We need that report.

324
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:51,753
Well, that's easier said than done.

325
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,633
This guy... doesn't care much
for Americans.

326
00:19:57,325 --> 00:20:00,124
- Unless it's just me.
- We'll find out soon enough.

327
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:02,980
- Gibbs and Ziva flew out last night.
- To Cartagena?

328
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:05,563
<i>Yeah, </i>Tony. That's what I was trying
to tell you before.

329
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:08,430
- Well, when do they get here?
- Already have.

330
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:12,304
Nice tan.

331
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:17,024
Denied. Again.

332
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,284
Didn't they teach you anything
down there in Cyberville?

333
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,908
No cyber jokes. Got it.

334
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:27,142
Extended firewalls,
two mirrored hard drives.

335
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,752
Whatever Lieutenant Evans
was into he worked hard to cover up.

336
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:32,543
Mirrored hard drives?

337
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:34,720
Hope you didn't make plans tonight.

338
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,392
Well, Ducky was right.

339
00:20:41,831 --> 00:20:43,350
- It's snot.
- It's not what?

340
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:44,797
It's snot.

341
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:47,792
- It's not?
- Yeah. It is.

342
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,165
It's what?

343
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:52,654
Snot! The substance found
in Lyndi Evans' hair!

344
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:53,783
It's snot.

345
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,355
Why didn't you just say that?

346
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:01,125
That's odd.

347
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,519
Major Mass Spec has found

348
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:08,341
a rare spore buried
in the killer's mucus.

349
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:10,314
All I need to do now
is find its origin.

350
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:11,845
Yes!

351
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,766
- I am in.
- Already?

352
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,855
All I had to do is
tear down the firewalls

353
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,680
and align the virtual images
with their true counterparts.

354
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:21,063
Timmy got new skills.

355
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:23,521
It was a long four months.

356
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,309
It still is, McGee.

357
00:21:31,697 --> 00:21:33,505
So, let me guess.
You guys caught a bad case

358
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,324
of DiNozzoitis,
had Vance to send you down south.

359
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:37,652
DiNozzoitis?

360
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,878
- Sounds venereal.
- Okay, don't admit it.

361
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:41,858
I know you missed me.
I missed you boss.

362
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:43,653
Yeah, I know, DiNozzo.

363
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:45,628
Yeah, Gibbs.

364
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,630
At work now.

365
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,293
I understand...

366
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:54,892
- What?
- You seem...

367
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:57,231
- different.
- Taller?

368
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,777
- Hotter?
- Older.

369
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:01,440
Well, it's been...

370
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,367
over four months.

371
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,864
You still beating yourself up
over Jenny?

372
00:22:07,984 --> 00:22:10,183
- Not as much as I used to.
- Drinking?

373
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:12,724
Not as much as I used to.

374
00:22:15,276 --> 00:22:16,629
You could have called.

375
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:21,161
COD's on the way from the Seahawk.
You got an hour, DiNozzo.

376
00:22:21,597 --> 00:22:25,314
Okay. Listen, I was thinking maybe
we should let Ziva handle the coroner.

377
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:27,765
I got a hunch.

378
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:33,621
<i>No, no, no, senorita,
no puede irse sin ver Cartagena.</i>

379
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:35,844
<i>Hay muchas partes que son muy bonitas.</i>

380
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:38,199
<i>Casi casi tan bonita como usted.</i>

381
00:22:38,464 --> 00:22:41,974
<i>Ojala pueda volver a Cartagena,
cuando tenga mas tiempo para conocer.</i>

382
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:50,024
- Got a hunch?
- The powers of observation.

383
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:56,776
This kid took a hell of a hit.

384
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,190
<i>"Trauma embotado de fuerza".</i>

385
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,280
Blunt force trauma resulting in
the nasal bone penetrating the brain.

386
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:08,303
According to Ducky, Lyndi Evans
was killed exactly the same way.

387
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,019
The same killer.

388
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:11,805
The guy gets around.

389
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:15,309
First he kills Evans' wife,
in Washington D.C.,

390
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,169
then Evans in Cartagena a day later?

391
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,899
- Yeah, Gibbs.
<i>- We got big news, boss.</i>

392
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,768
Huge news.
Ginormous news.

393
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,925
Like, maybe
you should be sitting <i>down.</i>

394
00:23:28,747 --> 00:23:30,429
<i>Sorry.</i>
Speak, McGee.

395
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,706
We ran through Lieutenant
Evans' email account,

396
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:35,291
found an ongoing correspondence
with someone in Singapore.

397
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:37,332
- Name?
- <i>We're working on it, </i>Gibbs.

398
00:23:37,452 --> 00:23:40,570
The e-mail's full of code words
and jumbled ciphers, the whole shebang.

399
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,796
They haven't stopped.

400
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:45,106
Someone posing as Lieutenant Evans
sent another e-mail a couple hours ago.

401
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:48,286
<i>And it contained references to both</i>
the USS Seahawk

402
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:51,599
and ciprofloxacin,
the antibiotic used to combat...

403
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:53,248
Anthrax.

404
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:01,809
<i>All inbound flight decks,
stand by to recover.</i>

405
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:03,903
<i>All inbound flight decks stand by.</i>

406
00:24:29,504 --> 00:24:32,441
- Welcome to the Bird Farm.
- It's great to be back.

407
00:24:32,643 --> 00:24:34,726
Completed the verification
of your crew, Captain?

408
00:24:34,963 --> 00:24:36,880
Matching FSRs against

409
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,250
5,000 souls is not an easy task,
Agent Gibbs.

410
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:43,238
We're doing it discreetly.
Damn near impossible.

411
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,158
- You get used to it.
- No, you don't.

412
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,001
Status on security systems?

413
00:24:50,232 --> 00:24:53,453
A handpicked team of ITs is filtering
through any possible breaches

414
00:24:53,613 --> 00:24:56,586
in the ship's electronic data and
control areas.

415
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:58,449
Are there other vulnerable areas?

416
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,422
Water supply, ventilation.

417
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:03,769
We believe Lieutenant Evans' killer
may be carrying ciprofloxacin.

418
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:06,270
To protect himself from the anthrax.

419
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,716
Are you telling me

420
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:15,973
this guy might be planning
a biological attack on my carrier?

421
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:17,945
That's what we're here to find out.

422
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:24,102
This is the Captain.
Get me the XO.

423
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:26,138
This is where you have been
the last month?

424
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,722
Yeah, it's just like the squad room,
only I'm the squad and there's no room.

425
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,855
Captain, we need to talk
to the officer of the deck

426
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:33,785
who let Lieutenant Evans' killer
on board.

427
00:25:33,953 --> 00:25:34,972
Whatever you need.

428
00:25:35,092 --> 00:25:37,801
Officer of the deck cannot be
the only sailor who has had contact.

429
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:41,082
She's not. Lieutenant Jonah Kaplan
works in the communications room where

430
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:43,276
Bizarro Evans clocked in for an hour.

431
00:25:43,412 --> 00:25:45,353
- Talk to him.
- I already did, boss.

432
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:48,383
- I'll talk to him again.
- Keep this as quiet as possible.

433
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,937
- What are those doing on your wall?
- How did those get there?

434
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:58,962
Safety is our primary concern.

435
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:04,143
I've ordered guards posted at the
vulnerable areas you're concerned about.

436
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,356
I know you want to play this down,
but my first priority

437
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:10,499
is the safety of this ship.
You've got 12 hours.

438
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,290
Then this becomes my investigation.

439
00:26:17,906 --> 00:26:20,310
McGee was specifically
told to destroy those photos.

440
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,750
- I guess he forgot.
- Then perhaps I should remind him.

441
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:24,880
Go easy on the lad.
He's had a rough summer.

442
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,093
We all have.

443
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:28,506
I think it was especially
difficult for McGeek.

444
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,706
He doesn't handle change well.
Never has.

445
00:26:30,878 --> 00:26:31,955
He seems fine.

446
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:35,150
Please. Cooped up in that techno
basement for four months?

447
00:26:35,518 --> 00:26:39,190
You know how much he loves pounding the
pavement, working leads, interrogating.

448
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,671
McGee?

449
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:43,722
Yeah, not to mention Gibbs, Duckster,

450
00:26:43,988 --> 00:26:47,614
you and me, Abs. I mean, everyone
knows how close those two are.

451
00:26:47,811 --> 00:26:50,695
McGee was in the subbasement, Tony.
They had lunch every week.

452
00:26:50,855 --> 00:26:53,115
It's not the same. You get used
to seeing someone every day,

453
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:55,935
talking to them, relying on them,
and suddenly they're not there.

454
00:26:56,056 --> 00:26:58,397
- It's all part of the job.
- Excuse me.

455
00:26:58,614 --> 00:27:01,115
Doesn't make it any easier for McGee.

456
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:05,609
As officer of the deck,
I check in thousands of sailors, sir.

457
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:07,719
I don't recall encountering
Lieutenant Evans.

458
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,625
You didn't. The man you let on
the carrier wasn't Evans.

459
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:11,803
Then who was it?

460
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:14,522
You tell me.

461
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:19,679
Lieutenant Evans never left Cartagena,

462
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,683
but you signed him in.

463
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:26,272
I check every sailor's orders,
every Navy I.D.

464
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:28,795
Whoever I let on had
the necessary credentials.

465
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:30,069
They were stolen.

466
00:27:30,223 --> 00:27:32,625
I match every face to every photo.

467
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:36,757
And one squid looks
just like every other squid.

468
00:27:39,815 --> 00:27:42,568
I've been an officer of the deck
for two years now, sir.

469
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:46,014
I know how sailors talk, walk, smell.

470
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,332
I know exactly how
they carry their damn bags.

471
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:51,831
There is no way in hell
I let a civilian on this ship.

472
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:57,510
- Hey.
- Agent DiNozzo.

473
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,397
Almeida, this is Officer David.

474
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:01,499
Officer.

475
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:03,864
Where's Lieutenant Kaplan?

476
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,029
Late for his watch. He should
have relieved me at 1200 hours.

477
00:28:07,223 --> 00:28:09,527
You did not see the man
who logged in as Lieutenant Evans?

478
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,016
Kaplan was on duty, not me.

479
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,829
So you do not know what station
Lieutenant Evans worked at?

480
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:17,457
3-F.
The class-three IT's

481
00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:20,035
have a higher security clearance
than anyone else in the unit.

482
00:28:20,418 --> 00:28:22,822
You can't touch that without
a key card and pass code.

483
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:24,473
Who are you calling?

484
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:27,041
I'm having the card shark paged.

485
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,527
<i>USS Seahawk, cyclone 127</i>

486
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:32,629
<i> scat-hotel-fox-five-niner.</i>

487
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,459
<i>2-7, USS Seahawk...</i>

488
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:37,116
What can I do for you, McGee?

489
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,673
Well, actually...

490
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,281
it's more what I can do for you.

491
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:46,554
The Seahawk's online security system

492
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:48,771
has a mirror on the NMCI server.

493
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,482
I'm pretty sure that I could

494
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:53,522
get into it.

495
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:58,455
Security specialists on the Seahawk
are already looking for a breach.

496
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:01,817
Why should I risk catching
heat from SecNav if you get caught?

497
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:04,870
For one, I can do it better and faster.

498
00:29:05,165 --> 00:29:06,550
Two: someone on that team

499
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,249
of Navy security specialists
could be colluding with the killer.

500
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:10,667
And the third?

501
00:29:12,106 --> 00:29:14,951
- How'd you know there was a third?
- There's always a third.

502
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:17,986
I won't get caught.

503
00:29:22,015 --> 00:29:25,492
Director, in the past four months,
I haven't worked any crime scenes,

504
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,511
pursued any leads or followed the trail
of a single piece of physical evidence.

505
00:29:29,823 --> 00:29:33,029
Are you trying to talk me into
or out of this, McGee?

506
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:34,880
What I have done

507
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:38,620
is crack some of the toughest encryption
this side of the browser wars.

508
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,667
You know that I can do this.

509
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,898
Okay, understood.

510
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,530
Yeah, as soon as I know more.

511
00:29:56,928 --> 00:30:00,488
Ship's crew has been verified. Everybody
that's supposed to be here is here.

512
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:01,685
Looking for a ghost.

513
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:03,920
Kaplan skipped his watch,
not answering pages.

514
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:05,880
He was in D.C. before
he joined the ship.

515
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,830
Conveniently. He's the only one who's
seen Lieutenant Evans' killer.

516
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,464
Claims to have seen him.

517
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,731
You think Kaplan may be conspiring
with the killer?

518
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:15,237
Or Kaplan is the killer.

519
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:17,634
Kaplan could have checked on twice,

520
00:30:17,754 --> 00:30:20,399
first as himself then slipped away,
checked on again as Lieutenant Evans.

521
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,445
Evans had a higher-level
security clearance than Kaplan.

522
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:26,676
Which Kaplan would have needed to gain
access to secure areas of the ship.

523
00:30:26,813 --> 00:30:28,643
- Find him.
- Already on it.

524
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:32,071
<i>Agent DiNozzo here
with an urgent request.</i>

525
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:34,899
<i>This is Lieutenant Jonah Kaplan.</i>

526
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:38,238
<i>If you have seen him or have
any information as to his whereabouts,</i>

527
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:40,377
- <i>please notify me immediately...</i>
- On a loop.

528
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,648
You got a B plan, DiNozzo?

529
00:30:43,694 --> 00:30:46,888
B... B plan?
This is Plan B. Be prepared.

530
00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:48,895
B? Of course, I got a plan B.

531
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:51,629
What kind of Agent Afloat
would I be if I didn't have a plan B?

532
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,876
You gotta, you gotta have a plan B.
I'm all about the plan B.

533
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:57,311
Agent DiNozzo.

534
00:30:58,179 --> 00:30:59,735
Plan A: they found him.

535
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:03,460
Lieutenant Kaplan?

536
00:31:03,824 --> 00:31:06,643
ICU.
Dr. Nguyen is examining him now.

537
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:10,078
Couple of his bunkmates found
him collapsed, rushed him in.

538
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:13,107
His vital signs were weak,
but we've been able to stabilize him.

539
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:17,528
- Hey! You can't...
- Criminal investigation.

540
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:22,776
What's wrong?

541
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:27,996
We had to induce a coma. He had
brain swelling. Lungs were collapsing.

542
00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:29,708
- Caused by?
- It's too soon to say.

543
00:31:29,828 --> 00:31:33,148
Could be a drug reaction.
Severe bacterial infection.

544
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,066
Could that be caused by anthrax?

545
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:37,674
He would have to have been

546
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:40,310
exposed to anthrax,
which is highly improbable.

547
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:43,314
Well, let's say he was.
How would you treat it?

548
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,954
I'd...
I'd administer Cipro.

549
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,370
Should I be administering Cipro,
Agent Gibbs?

550
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:53,601
And then what?

551
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:56,450
And then I'd send my advisories
and my instructions

552
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,929
along with his chart. He's going
to be medevaced off the ship.

553
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:01,111
If he ever wakes up,
it'll be in Leavenworth.

554
00:32:01,248 --> 00:32:04,200
I don't think so.
According to his file, Kaplan left D.C.

555
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:06,329
two days before Lyndi Evans
was killed.

556
00:32:09,904 --> 00:32:11,303
Kaplan did not do it.

557
00:32:32,904 --> 00:32:33,783
That.

558
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:37,627
I hate it when you don't know what
you're looking for but

559
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,128
- it might kill you if you find it.
- Morphine.

560
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:44,216
Kaplan's the only one who can
identify Lieutenant Evans' killer.

561
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,643
- And he overdoses.
- Hell of a cowinkidink.

562
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:50,068
- What's a cowinkidink?
- Coincidence.

563
00:32:51,611 --> 00:32:53,432
You believe this is a dowinkyquink?

564
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:56,476
Sarcasm, Ziva. You're back in America.
Flip the switch.

565
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:00,098
- Technically, we are not...
- American ship. American soil.

566
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:02,921
American soil.

567
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:06,594
Enough already. You have three more
months. What's the big deal?

568
00:33:06,714 --> 00:33:09,354
- Easy for you to say.
- What's that supposed to mean?

569
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,047
You're back in D.C.,
which is what you wanted.

570
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:15,037
Isn't it?

571
00:33:15,764 --> 00:33:17,371
You get orders, Tony.

572
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:19,666
You may not like them,
but you follow them.

573
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:21,815
That's why they're called orders.

574
00:33:22,562 --> 00:33:24,122
That's not what I asked.

575
00:33:24,827 --> 00:33:26,860
Something happened in Israel,
didn't it?

576
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:30,402
You'll say you don't want to talk
about it, but your eyes won't shut up.

577
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,644
Something you left behind maybe?

578
00:33:36,478 --> 00:33:38,424
- Or someone?
- You're right.

579
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,979
I don't want to talk about it.

580
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:44,597
Doc tested Lieutenant Kaplan.

581
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:47,142
- No anthrax. Just...
- Morphine.

582
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,884
He was drugged.

583
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:51,785
- Killer's tying up loose ends.
- Nowhere to run.

584
00:33:55,448 --> 00:33:56,458
Yeah. Go.

585
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,152
Okay,
after a whiny little temper tantrum,

586
00:33:59,272 --> 00:34:01,291
Major Mass Spec
finally got his act together.

587
00:34:01,452 --> 00:34:04,889
Scored an I.D. on the spore from
the mucus found in Lyndi Evans' do.

588
00:34:05,123 --> 00:34:06,755
- And?
- It's Samoan.

589
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:08,383
- A what?
- Samoan.

590
00:34:08,689 --> 00:34:11,385
Our little spore is actually
a strain of influenza.

591
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:14,595
- Killer had the flu.
- Yeah. But not just any flu, Gibbs.

592
00:34:14,715 --> 00:34:16,683
This strain is particular
to the American

593
00:34:16,843 --> 00:34:18,964
Samoan region of the South Pacific.

594
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:21,187
Abby, that's good work.

595
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:26,845
I don't want to hear it.

596
00:34:27,342 --> 00:34:29,728
Need to access the
ship's sick bay records.

597
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:35,174
McGee isn't here.

598
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:38,254
You.

599
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:44,012
Come on.

600
00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:46,337
So much for better and faster.

601
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:52,384
What the hell is going on? I heard Vance
sent you back to the subbasement.

602
00:34:52,705 --> 00:34:55,753
- No. I sent myself to the subbasement.
- So what's next?

603
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:57,724
Sending Ziva back to Israel?

604
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,582
I can't breach the firewalls
to the Seahawk's maintenance network.

605
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:03,542
Why would you do this?

606
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:06,441
It's preposterous,
deplorable, absolutely illogical.

607
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:08,082
Are you listening to me, McGee?

608
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:10,403
Yes. It is illogical.

609
00:35:11,158 --> 00:35:12,313
No, no, no, no.

610
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:14,699
It's logical.

611
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:18,244
- It's a logic bomb!
- Yes, Abby. It's a logic bomb.

612
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:24,731
You can use a logic bomb
to infiltrate the server.

613
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:26,256
Abs, that is fantastic.

614
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:31,234
You're not the only one
with skills, McGee.

615
00:35:32,322 --> 00:35:33,384
Almost there, boss.

616
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:35,562
That's what you said
ten minutes ago, Dinozzo.

617
00:35:35,682 --> 00:35:38,069
- What is the problem, Tony?
- There is no problem, Ziva.

618
00:35:38,189 --> 00:35:41,476
- I've seen McGee do it a million times.
- And a million times faster.

619
00:35:42,205 --> 00:35:43,219
McGee who?

620
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:47,314
In the last week, 49 sailors
reported to sick bay with the flu.

621
00:35:47,643 --> 00:35:49,568
None of them joined
the ship in Cartagena.

622
00:35:49,688 --> 00:35:51,808
Perhaps the killer did not
report his illness.

623
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:53,192
American Samoa.

624
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,249
All sailors deployed
in the past month.

625
00:35:58,402 --> 00:36:00,109
Personnel deployments.

626
00:36:00,874 --> 00:36:02,960
- Where the hell are they?
- Should I call McGee?

627
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,584
Only if you want to be bored to death
by him explaining what I have just done!

628
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:09,670
There. Right there.

629
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:11,122
I'm trying.

630
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,799
Just waiting for my insult now.

631
00:36:13,191 --> 00:36:14,694
Takes McGee only seconds.

632
00:36:14,814 --> 00:36:17,320
A lot of things take
McGee seconds. Got it!

633
00:36:18,938 --> 00:36:21,339
Six sailors joined the ship
from American Samoa.

634
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:23,341
Only three boarded in Cartagena.

635
00:36:23,702 --> 00:36:25,228
But only one via D.C.

636
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:27,105
Sick bay.

637
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:31,612
- Yeah.
- Boss,

638
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:34,719
Just found a breach on the Seahawk's
Requisitions and Accounting system.

639
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:38,762
There was an order placed
for 100 cases of ciprofloxacin.

640
00:36:38,882 --> 00:36:41,119
It's worth, <i>like
half a million bucks.</i>

641
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:44,831
Only half the order ever made it to the
Seahawk. The rest is en route to Pulau

642
00:36:44,991 --> 00:36:46,624
<i>- Tekong.</i>
- Singapore.

643
00:36:46,744 --> 00:36:49,710
<i>Most likely </i>a black-market
distributor, boss. Not terrorism.

644
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,870
Money.

645
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:55,458
Agent Gibbs?

646
00:36:56,144 --> 00:36:58,399
- Where's Henley?
- He called in sick with the flu.

647
00:36:58,629 --> 00:37:00,589
Made sure
he gave it to me first though.

648
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,950
Ziva, Officer of the Deck.
Alert the captain.

649
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:05,142
- Security alert.
- It is just the flu, no?

650
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:06,456
Kaplan, Where's Kaplan?

651
00:37:06,576 --> 00:37:08,486
He was transferred to the flight deck
20 mn ago.

652
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:10,260
Like I said,
he's being medevac to D.C.

653
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:17,321
- It's Kaplan.
- Crash cart!

654
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:19,028
- Right away!
- He's alive.

655
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:21,623
Four milligrams Alasone stat!

656
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:24,461
Medevac.

657
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:26,189
It's leaving right now.

658
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:27,603
Hold that launch.

659
00:37:28,243 --> 00:37:29,792
We have to hold the medevac launch.

660
00:37:46,427 --> 00:37:49,763
<i>Medevac flight 3569, change of status.
You are now holding.</i>

661
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:53,107
Copy that. Medevac 3569 standing by.

662
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,282
I said hurry up!

663
00:38:02,066 --> 00:38:03,791
We need to launch now!

664
00:38:03,911 --> 00:38:05,150
I can't.

665
00:38:06,457 --> 00:38:08,128
Drop your weapon, Corpsman!

666
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:12,001
Get off the plane or,
I swear, I will put

667
00:38:12,162 --> 00:38:14,042
- a bullet in his head!
- No, you won't.

668
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:15,504
He's your ride out of here.

669
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:18,966
I said get off this damn plane!

670
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:22,510
Hurry the hell up!

671
00:38:22,824 --> 00:38:25,431
Lieutenant Evans was buried in debt.
You were his way out.

672
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:28,476
He bought the drugs,
you forged the documents,

673
00:38:28,636 --> 00:38:31,562
- until the wife found out.
- She should have stayed out of it!

674
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:34,148
You killed her after he deployed.

675
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:37,443
You got to him before he boarded,
you tried to talk him around it.

676
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:39,817
That didn't work out well, did it?

677
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,489
I didn't need him anyway.

678
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,116
Just needed his I.D.

679
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,911
You are not stopping
this plane from taking off!

680
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,538
You want to fly?

681
00:38:51,992 --> 00:38:53,376
Do you want to fly?!

682
00:38:55,395 --> 00:38:56,395
Let's fly.

683
00:38:57,742 --> 00:38:59,377
Not cleared, sir!

684
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,927
Tell them Special Agent Gibbs said,
"Launch".

685
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,179
Medevac to Flight Control.

686
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:09,183
Captain, the medevac pilot's requesting
clearance on Agent Gibbs' orders.

687
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:10,601
Launch the plane.

688
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:13,100
I've got an armed man
aboard that aircraft.

689
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,161
So have I and he said launch it.

690
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,984
<i>Flight 3569,
you are now cleared for launch.</i>

691
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,403
What the hell are you waiting for?

692
00:39:22,038 --> 00:39:23,739
<i>3569, acknowledge.</i>

693
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:25,324
- Go!
- Copy that.

694
00:39:25,484 --> 00:39:26,993
Go to positive thrust.

695
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,370
<i>Clear forward.
Launch.</i>

696
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,179
Nice flight?

697
00:39:52,447 --> 00:39:53,869
Seems like old times.

698
00:39:54,562 --> 00:39:56,662
Chevy Chase,
Goldie Hawn, 1980, actually.

699
00:39:56,782 --> 00:39:58,311
I meant you, me and Gibbs.

700
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:00,139
I know what you meant.

701
00:40:01,581 --> 00:40:03,715
Keep your head straight. Don't move.

702
00:40:06,222 --> 00:40:07,849
COD's launching in ten, boss.

703
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:09,432
- Grab your gear.
- My gear?

704
00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:11,953
Your collar.
You ride him home.

705
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:15,124
- Home?
- Home, DiNozzo.

706
00:40:15,643 --> 00:40:16,643
Home.

707
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,672
Make a hole! Coming through!

708
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:23,581
Make a hole!

709
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,164
Owens wants to know if he's getting
his Agent Afloat back.

710
00:40:36,284 --> 00:40:37,980
Request hit my desk today.

711
00:40:38,722 --> 00:40:40,728
The team needs him, Leon.

712
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,902
I've already made my decision, Gibbs.

713
00:40:45,272 --> 00:40:46,989
And, in answer to your question...

714
00:40:48,786 --> 00:40:50,659
... it was never a punishment.

715
00:40:55,897 --> 00:40:58,291
So this nut job is running
through the mess hall,

716
00:40:58,452 --> 00:41:01,266
and he's completely naked,
which is weird.

717
00:41:01,386 --> 00:41:02,973
Hey, boss. Talk to Vance?

718
00:41:03,451 --> 00:41:05,352
Yeah. Yeah. He was...

719
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,302
You're back!

720
00:41:10,419 --> 00:41:11,514
In the flesh.

721
00:41:12,434 --> 00:41:14,166
For reals?
Like total reals?

722
00:41:14,468 --> 00:41:16,435
Like... pinky promise
permanent reals?

723
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:18,562
Reassigned to D.C.
effective immediately.

724
00:41:20,987 --> 00:41:22,149
Director just told me.

725
00:41:25,388 --> 00:41:28,247
Never thought I'd say this,
Tony, but it is nice to have you back.

726
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:30,282
Nice? It's like spectacular.

727
00:41:30,402 --> 00:41:33,673
I kept every one of your postcards and
I have a whole DiNozzo wall in my lab.

728
00:41:33,793 --> 00:41:36,236
It was a long four months.
I've got to say it's great to be home.

729
00:41:36,356 --> 00:41:38,889
Not that I didn't think I
wouldn't be coming back because...

730
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:42,358
So, anyway, Sister Rosita,
she bowled a 260 last month.

731
00:41:42,478 --> 00:41:44,838
And I watched Titanic finally.
It sinks at the end. Very weird

732
