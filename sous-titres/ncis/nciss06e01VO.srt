<i>Previously on NCIS...</i>

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,848
<i>The funeral was held this morning
for NCIS Director, Jenny Shepard.</i>

4
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:11,140
<i>Assistant Director Leon Vance
has been named to succeed her.</i>

5
00:00:12,154 --> 00:00:13,301
Officer David,

6
00:00:13,886 --> 00:00:17,244
the liaison position with NCIS
is being terminated.

7
00:00:17,597 --> 00:00:18,601
McGee...

8
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:21,379
I'm moving you across
to the cyber crimes unit.

9
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:23,825
DiNozzo... you've been reassigned.

10
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:26,679
Agent afloat, USS Ronald Reagan.

11
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,097
Pack your bags.
You fly out tomorrow.

12
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:30,754
Agent Gibbs...

13
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:33,921
... meet your new team.

You want to get that?

19
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:50,756
Hello.

20
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:55,656
No, Special Agent DiNozzo's
been reassigned.

21
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:58,148
Special Agent Langer. Maybe I can,

22
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:00,952
I don't know, several months ago.

23
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,659
I'm not authorized to say, but you could
try the personnel department and...

24
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:05,771
Hello?

25
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,776
Four months, I've been sitting here
fielding calls for DiNozzo.

26
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,154
And I swear, they're all women.

27
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,500
And that surprises you?

28
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:18,541
Have you seen
my Oman threat assessment?

29
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:21,119
Is that what this is?

30
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,391
And I thought it was copy
for a travel brochure.

31
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:27,751
- "Come see sunny Oman".
- Give me the file, Langer.

32
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,919
- Give her the file, Langer.
- Give her the file, Langer.

33
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,649
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, sir.

34
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:33,930
Morning, sir.

35
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:37,882
So glad we all agree on something.
Agent Lee, Oman threat assessment.

36
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,221
Right here, sir.

37
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:44,792
Sorry, sir.

38
00:03:45,655 --> 00:03:47,680
Told you about calling me sir.

39
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,930
A call came in for you.

40
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:02,844
I took the message, sir...

41
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,616
Yes, I can see right here
in the "message taken by" box

42
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:09,745
- Keating.
- He said it was...

43
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:10,862
Urgent.

44
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:16,311
Special Agent Gibbs,
for Detective Reynolds.

45
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:17,613
It'll get better.

46
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:19,927
Yeah... when he retires.

47
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:21,836
All right.

48
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,948
Grab your gear.

49
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:37,946
Sorry.

50
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,802
My God, my fault, sir.
Gibbs, I was pressing the wrong thing.

51
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:01,928
She was.

52
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:10,268
Sorry... didn't mean to ruin your shot.

53
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:11,555
It's okay.

54
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:20,697
That's why they get
the cheap rates, you see.

55
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:22,526
It's far away from everything.

56
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,664
Didn't worry him.
Paid cash up front, 18 weeks.

57
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,936
Not curious you didn't see him
all that time?

58
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:32,049
Life in the park bleeds
the curiosity out of you.

59
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:33,669
Live and let live.

60
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:36,368
I only came to see him
'cause his rent was due.

61
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:40,748
Body's been in that trailer
at least four and a half months.

62
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:42,966
Explains why no one
complained about the smell.

63
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:45,606
Agent Lee?

64
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:50,574
Found his stash.

65
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:54,427
Must be at least $5,000 here.

66
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:57,792
- He's lucky it wasn't stolen.
- Keating, he's not lucky, he's dead.

67
00:05:58,644 --> 00:05:59,980
I'll tag and bag it.

68
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:01,120
Langer.

69
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:07,574
Deceased is Petty Officer
Steven Nicholas Vargo.

70
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:10,620
Failed to report for duty back in May,
four and a half months ago.

71
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,075
- Where?
- Navy yard.

72
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:15,739
Lived in auxiliary housing, left work,
didn't return to his room.

73
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,853
I guess he found this little piece
of paradise more appealing.

74
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:20,813
- What sort of job?
- Strategic planning,

75
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:23,093
- building right next door to ours.
- Security clearance?

76
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:25,642
- As high as they go.
- Okay. Get a statement.

77
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:32,749
Mr. Palmer, tell Agent Gibbs
he can send in the B team.

78
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:35,747
That implies there's an A team, Duck.

79
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:36,971
Isn't there?

80
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,094
They're all A teams.

81
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:41,105
Perhaps some even A-plus.

82
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:43,428
Sleeping?

83
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:47,146
There are other reasons why men take
their clothes off to go to bed, Jethro.

84
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:50,083
- Any evidence of that?
- I did come to a sticky end.

85
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:55,717
I'll go get the gurney.

86
00:06:57,443 --> 00:07:01,324
Single gunshot wound to the upper
temporal area, probably while asleep.

87
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:04,265
The pillow was held against his head
to muffle the shot.

88
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,408
Nothing to suggest a struggle.

89
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:09,830
You know, the stench in here
must have been unbearable.

90
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,950
Isn't anybody curious anymore?

91
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:13,230
Bled out.

92
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:15,757
Like him.

93
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:25,317
I need a hearing test.
I'm going deaf. Am I talking loud?

94
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:27,408
'Cause sometimes people
that don't hear very well,

95
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:29,177
they talk too loud, except sometimes,

96
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:32,689
when I get water in my ears, I talk so
softly that people tell me to speak up,

97
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,718
I have that weird, you know,
gurgling, swishing

98
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:38,017
sound in my head. Has that ever happened
to you? Why didn't I hear the elevator?

99
00:07:38,222 --> 00:07:40,484
- The stairs.
- You don't take the stairs.

100
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:43,839
You

101
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:45,826
are taking the stairs

102
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:48,088
because you associate the elevator

103
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,005
with people you're trying to forget.

104
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:53,365
I'm not trying to forget anybody.

105
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:55,186
What do you got?

106
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,504
Nine-millimeter casing and

107
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,473
a 147-grain LE hollow-point slug.

108
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:05,723
We use LE hollow points,

109
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,185
and so do the FBI,

110
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:10,187
Secret Service, Navy SEALS and
a bunch of other law enforcement,

111
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:13,561
but it's not the kind of slug
that Joe Public can get his mitts on.

112
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:14,999
What else?

113
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,178
A number.

114
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,011
One, two, six?

115
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:29,840
One hundred and twenty-six.

116
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:32,108
That is the number of days

117
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:34,718
that Tony, McGee
and Ziva have been gone.

118
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:37,657
I really didn't think you'd let it
get into triple digits, Gibbs,

119
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,647
but now it's way more.
It's like

120
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:41,524
the third of a whole year.

121
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:44,401
I miss them.

122
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:48,306
- You had lunch with McGee yesterday.
- It's not the same.

123
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,306
I miss them collectively...
as a group.

124
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,090
My three musketeers.

125
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:54,950
Tim is the only one I've seen.

126
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,754
No Tony, no Ziva.
I get postcards from Tony.

127
00:08:59,244 --> 00:09:01,970
I want them back, Gibbs.
Please get them back.

128
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:11,359
You have ten days. Okay,
I don't want to pressure you,

129
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,679
so 12...

130
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:15,591
but no more than two weeks.

131
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:23,602
And stop taking the stairs.

132
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:28,037
Agent Gibbs, I think I have something.

133
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:30,642
I have a connection between
our murder victim, Petty Officer Vargo,

134
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:33,113
and former Navy Petty Officer
Brian Roberts.

135
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:35,499
- He and the victim served together.
- Put it up.

136
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:39,080
On the plasma, Keating.

137
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,462
That's Roberts on the left and our
murder victim, Vargo, is on the right.

138
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:46,568
Roberts got out six months ago,
but here's the kicker:

139
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:49,591
Roberts was killed by a bomb blast
at a bar in Morocco overnight.

140
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:52,013
- Terrorist attack?
- Trying to get more now.

141
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:54,888
Got a link to the raw feed out of ZNN.

142
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,293
- Unlucky coincidence.
- Must be.

143
00:09:57,786 --> 00:09:59,442
That's a hell of a bomb blast.

144
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,836
Casualties?

145
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,236
Four killed, including Roberts.
13 injured.

146
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:10,129
Oh, my God.

147
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:11,719
Isn't that...?

148
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,407
<i>The number you are
calling is not available.</i>

149
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,134
- Langer.
- Trying to reach an Israeli contact.

150
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,262
He's got connections
in the intelligence community.

151
00:10:30,382 --> 00:10:32,169
Mossad wants us
to put it through channels.

152
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:34,660
- They're not being very helpful.
- Leave it. Roberts and Vargo.

153
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,005
I want everything. Phone records,
bank accounts, e-mails,

154
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,329
last time they saw each other, last time
they spoke with each other. Got it?

155
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:41,222
Got it.

156
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:44,395
- You find her, now.
- I'll do my best...

157
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:48,514
Hey, boss?

158
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:50,131
Boss?

159
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:51,195
Yeah.

160
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:54,428
The logarithm of the quotient
is the excess of

161
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:57,632
the logarithm of the dividend
over that of the divisor.

162
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:59,799
High school math, Pringle.
What's your point?

163
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,423
I put the wrong divisor.

164
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:02,975
Recalculate. Dallas.

165
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:05,164
- Boss?
- Still need that encryption key.

166
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,893
Still working on it, boss.

167
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:09,215
Boss?

168
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,062
Boss.

169
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,171
I'm not really their boss.

170
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,461
They just...
call me that because I'm a

171
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:30,623
field agent, you know,
I carry the handgun.

172
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:33,071
It's good to see you, boss.

173
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,280
You heard from Ziva?

174
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,335
Yeah.

175
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:38,186
An e-mail every week, until

176
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:40,742
about three weeks ago.
I thought maybe she went on vacation.

177
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,362
No. Try undercover, McGee.

178
00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:45,073
Undercover would make sense,
her being Mossad and all.

179
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:46,963
Know how to contact her?

180
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,431
- Cell phone?
- No longer connected.

181
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,303
- Yeah. Gibbs.
<i>- I found her.</i>

182
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,216
Had to call in a favor from a friend

183
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:01,872
at Pine Gap. You know, the big
communications base we've got down...

184
00:12:01,992 --> 00:12:02,992
<i>Put her on.</i>

185
00:12:03,112 --> 00:12:04,482
Done. You're connected.

186
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:07,645
<i>You okay?</i>

187
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:10,652
- You heard.
<i>- Yeah, raw feed out of ZNN.</i>

188
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,232
<i>You might want to call them.</i>

189
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:14,905
- Thanks for the tip.
- What can you tell me?

190
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,073
<i>Not much.</i> I was undercover.

191
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:19,943
Trying to win the trust of a man
showing an unhealthy interest in

192
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,660
Chechnyan terrorist group.

193
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,387
<i>Brian Roberts?</i>

194
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:27,597
Perhaps you should tell me
what you know.

195
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:30,126
<i>Old Navy</i> friend of Roberts
was found murdered this morning.

196
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:33,791
Steve Vargo. Worked strategic
planning, top secret clearance.

197
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:37,550
Who was the target?

198
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:40,804
Roberts was meeting
a Chechnyan terrorist

199
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,680
by the name of Milaana Shishani.

200
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,502
By sheer luck, she escaped the blast.

201
00:12:44,622 --> 00:12:46,764
But Mossad does not believe
she was the target.

202
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:48,674
- Roberts was.
- Why?

203
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:50,527
<i>We can only</i> speculate.

204
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:54,141
But from what you've told me, it appears
that someone wanted them both dead.

205
00:12:54,383 --> 00:12:56,070
- Cleaning house?
- Possibly.

206
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,095
Who tipped you off about Roberts?

207
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:05,078
Director Vance.

208
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,986
We miss you, Ziva.

209
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:14,672
I miss you, too.

210
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:15,882
All of you.

211
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,042
Even, Tony.

212
00:13:19,294 --> 00:13:20,295
<i>Gotta go.</i>

213
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,725
- Take care, Gibbs.
- Yeah, you take care, too.

214
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:31,725
Go home,

215
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:32,981
rest.

216
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:37,079
A kiss for your father.

217
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:52,323
Good night, Papa.

218
00:14:03,502 --> 00:14:05,854
Steve Vargo.
What do you know about him?

219
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:08,804
Boss, I'm not sure I can exactly
tell you what I know.

220
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,580
Orders.

221
00:14:12,724 --> 00:14:13,724
Yeah, him.

222
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,741
You okay, boss?

223
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,985
- Get back to work.
- Yes, Boss.

224
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:31,153
People say this is one of the greatest
sports photos ever taken.

225
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:33,527
Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston.

226
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:36,474
May 25, 1965.

227
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:38,410
First round, first minute.

228
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:40,807
Ali hit him, Sonny went down,

229
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:44,222
stayed down.
Then all hell broke loose.

230
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:47,950
Lot of people thought it was fixed,
thought Sonny took a dive.

231
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:51,092
That what you think?

232
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:55,186
I think it's easy to jump to the wrong
conclusions without all the facts.

233
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,122
Swing away.

234
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:01,748
You didn't break up my team because
of Jenny's death.

235
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:04,937
Five months ago,
I got a series of anonymous calls

236
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:06,448
from a Navy Petty Officer.

237
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:10,187
Eventually, he identified himself
as Steve Vargo.

238
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,275
Said he had gambling debts
and that he was being blackmailed

239
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:17,067
into supplying highly classified
data to someone.

240
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:18,526
What sort of data?

241
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:19,927
He wouldn't tell me.

242
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,621
But Vargo was a specialist
in the Middle East.

243
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:25,709
He said he'd downloaded
a critical file,

244
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:27,267
but he hadn't passed it on.

245
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:29,556
- Change of heart.
- I believed him.

246
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:32,818
On the director's orders,
I flew to DC.

247
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:35,624
I arranged to meet him. He was gonna
give me the name of that contact,

248
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:37,126
but he didn't turn up.

249
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,190
Next day, he didn't report for duty.

250
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,832
Now I know why.

251
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,483
You didn't answer the question, Leon.

252
00:15:43,603 --> 00:15:45,371
The reason I broke up your team,
Gibbs,

253
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:49,198
was because whoever was blackmailing
Vargo was an NCIS agent.

254
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:50,533
Not one of mine.

255
00:15:51,196 --> 00:15:51,906
No.

256
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:55,832
From what Vargo told me,
I narrowed it down to three agents.

257
00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:01,139
Only reason I broke up your team
was so I could form a new one.

258
00:16:02,824 --> 00:16:05,716
So you can help me find out
which one of these three...

259
00:16:07,855 --> 00:16:09,489
is betraying their country.

260
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:20,214
You were gonna get around
to telling me?

261
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:22,134
Had no evidence.

262
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:25,002
I figured I put you with them,
your radar would go off,

263
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:27,752
and one day you'd come to me and say
you had a doubt about one of them.

264
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:31,243
A doubt? A doubt, Leon?!
I got a doubt about every one of them.

265
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:35,485
Got a former FBI guy who doesn't listen.
Got a boy genius who doesn't drive.

266
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,475
Got a lawyer who doesn't shoot.

267
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,499
Made the jump to NCIS
eight months ago from the FBI.

268
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:44,201
- He got no special treatment.
- But you did recommend him.

269
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:46,474
- He called me.
- And you endorsed him.

270
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:48,536
Now you're having second thoughts.

271
00:16:48,656 --> 00:16:50,714
Not the agent you thought
you were getting.

272
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,434
Why don't you just say it?

273
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:56,392
- He used you to get inside the agency.
- Doesn't make him guilty.

274
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:57,611
Just clever.

275
00:16:59,837 --> 00:17:01,690
Pentagon knows there's
a security breach.

276
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:03,650
They don't know how bad.

277
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,416
I've seized all of Vargo's
computers and his hard drives.

278
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:07,820
We've been working on them.

279
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:11,618
That's why I moved him down there.

280
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:14,224
Seven levels of encryption, so far.

281
00:17:14,514 --> 00:17:16,746
Every level harder to crack
than the last.

282
00:17:17,575 --> 00:17:19,757
I wasn't the only one
who Vargo contacted.

283
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:22,943
Confided in his old Navy buddy,
Brian Roberts.

284
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,709
Then a week ago,
Roberts turned up in Tel Aviv.

285
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,891
- Vargo was a specialist in Israel.
- And that's why you sent Ziva back.

286
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,629
Mossad mounted an operation.
They were gonna pick up Roberts

287
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:36,352
last night in Morocco,
but they weren't quick enough.

288
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:39,267
Someone is tying up a loose end.

289
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:42,691
I think Vargo told Roberts
the name of the NCIS agent.

290
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,755
And I'm guessing Roberts
was trying to sell that

291
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,727
name to anybody
who was willing to pay.

292
00:17:46,896 --> 00:17:47,896
So, what?

293
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:50,064
Four months, you got nothing.

294
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,020
We got nothing.

295
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,851
Vargo's computers have been seized.

296
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,565
Standard operating procedure.
It's in the agents' manual,

297
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:07,318
section 35, sub-section two, clause E:

298
00:18:07,698 --> 00:18:09,903
- "Seizure of evidence".
- You're making that up.

299
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:13,042
- And this matters why?
- They were seized four months ago.

300
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:16,014
After he failed to report to duty.
Makes perfect sense.

301
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:18,775
- Who seized them?
- Us. This agency.

302
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:20,162
NCIS.

303
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:22,545
Then it would've been logged.

304
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,802
Wasn't logged.

305
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:28,266
Legally, that could cause
a chain of evidence problem.

306
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:31,063
- Got to be in the building somewhere.
- Evidence locker maybe?

307
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,405
Down with the geeks.

308
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,952
What?

309
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:39,438
Okay. Talk to me.

310
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,542
Update.

311
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:44,773
Anyone?!

312
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:48,342
Sorry. Go, you go. Sir.

313
00:18:48,775 --> 00:18:52,090
Keating. Vargo closed out two bank
accounts the day before he disappeared,

314
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:56,099
withdrawing a total of $11,350.
No credit card transactions since.

315
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:58,167
- Agent Lee.
- Vargo's commanding officer

316
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:00,753
is refusing to see us
without legal representation.

317
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,359
- Covering his butt.
- I'm having trouble finding a JAG

318
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,446
officer with the appropriate
security clearance.

319
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:07,575
You got anything, Special Agent?

320
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:10,307
We seized Vargo's computers
the day after he disappeared,

321
00:19:10,427 --> 00:19:12,646
but they were never logged
into evidence.

322
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:15,324
Probably down in the basement
with the rest of the...

323
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:18,232
I'll handle it.

324
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:21,056
- Witness statements.
- Yes, sir.

325
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:40,411
This is Agent Lee, NCIS.
Is Major Clay available?

326
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,685
I'll hold.

327
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:51,365
- Night, boss.
- See you tomorrow, boss.

328
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:52,921
Night, boss. Good night.

329
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:54,746
- Night, boss.
- Good night, boss.

330
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:59,438
- You call him?
- Director's on his way down.

331
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:01,543
You like working down here, McGee?

332
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:05,295
Boss, I'm sorry.
He made it very clear to me that

333
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:07,198
I couldn't talk to anyone
except for him.

334
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,101
Wouldn't have stopped you in the past.

335
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:11,212
Well, it's not the same.
We were a team.

336
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:14,177
I would give this up in a heartbeat to
be back working with you and Ziva again.

337
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,346
And DiNozzo?

338
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:17,526
Yeah, him, too.

339
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:21,449
You can tell him.

340
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:23,404
We cracked the eighth level
of encryption.

341
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:25,929
Which is not actually accurate
because they're not really levels

342
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:28,707
of encryption so much as packets
of information all

343
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:31,035
encrypted with a new layer of
protection that...

344
00:20:31,786 --> 00:20:33,892
... that you really
don't need to know about.

345
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:36,472
Now,
this next series of packets contained

346
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:40,631
system archives, logging information,
time-stamped data transfer reports...

347
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:44,964
I really have been down here too long,
haven't I?

348
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:48,871
The day before he disappeared, Vargo
connected a thumb drive about this size

349
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:52,832
to a classified computer
and downloaded a 2.75 gigabyte file.

350
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,047
What sort of data?

351
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:56,275
Don't know. Haven't cracked
that level of encryption.

352
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:57,925
Something he could easily hide.

353
00:20:58,327 --> 00:20:59,709
Probably took it with him.

354
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:01,328
Or put it some place safe.

355
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:03,790
Maybe.

356
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:05,527
Thank you, McGee.

357
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:07,184
Keep Agent Gibbs in the loop.

358
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:08,436
Will do.

359
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:11,981
Good night, Director.

360
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,659
- Good night, boss.
- Night.

361
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,756
- Solve this first, then we'll talk.
- Ziva, too.

362
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:27,083
Good morning, Dr. Gibbs.

363
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,811
Hey, Duck, what's this shadow here?

364
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:30,522
This area right here.

365
00:21:31,162 --> 00:21:34,562
It's a clearly marked fracture
of the ramus mandibulae.

366
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:35,545
Broken jaw.

367
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:38,142
Caused by a blunt instrument.

368
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:39,800
Possibly the butt of the gun.

369
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:42,062
No signs of a fight at the scene.

370
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:44,430
Already in the bed, possibly asleep.

371
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:46,724
Something disturbs him, a noise.

372
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:49,067
Before he can get up,
the assailant strikes.

373
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:51,687
- Unconscious?
- Or dazed, certainly.

374
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:54,429
Allowing the assailant time
to pick up a pillow

375
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:56,923
to silence the fatal gunshot.

376
00:21:57,264 --> 00:21:58,624
No surprises, Jethro.

377
00:21:58,754 --> 00:22:02,657
No tell tale marks or bruises
to help you with your investigation.

378
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,362
Just a rather unrevealing death,
I'm sorry to say.

379
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:09,997
Did I miss something?

380
00:22:10,552 --> 00:22:11,678
The pillow.

381
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:14,896
- The pillow?
- Yeah. The pillow.

382
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:18,646
The pillow.

383
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:26,660
Abs, the pillow.

384
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:28,892
- Good morning, Gibbs.
- Morning.

385
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:31,787
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. The pillow.

386
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,976
The one with the bullet hole or the
one with the blood and the bullet hole?

387
00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:36,741
The one the killer fired through.

388
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:43,496
- Powder burns?
- Some.

389
00:22:43,817 --> 00:22:44,817
Problem?

390
00:22:44,937 --> 00:22:47,675
There's just not as much
as I would have expected,

391
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:50,551
and if you jam a gun into a pillow

392
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:54,500
to suppress the noise of a gunshot,
there would be more powder burns.

393
00:22:54,662 --> 00:22:57,558
They would leave a distinct pattern
in the creases of the pillow.

394
00:22:59,506 --> 00:23:00,214
See?

395
00:23:00,397 --> 00:23:02,219
It's barely even scrunched up at all.

396
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,004
As a means of silencing a gunshot,
this wouldn't be very effective.

397
00:23:06,257 --> 00:23:08,222
Wasn't trying to silence the gunshot.

398
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:11,066
Just wanted to cover
the victim's face.

399
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:15,437
Squeamish shooter.
Sounds like something I would do.

400
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:18,095
I mean, if I were to do it.
Not that I would ever do it,

401
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:20,203
- but if I were to do it.
<i>- I got something here.</i>

402
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:22,931
- Be right down.
- But if I did, I would shut my eyes.

403
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:25,846
Or... Or use a pillow.

404
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,751
Yeah.

405
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:31,047
Got something here, boss.

406
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:32,581
Want to call Vance?

407
00:23:33,438 --> 00:23:35,140
No, he can wait.

408
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:37,789
We did an extensive search
through Vargo's phone records.

409
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:39,570
Home, office, cell.

410
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:41,249
No unusual flagged numbers.

411
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:44,758
McGee, you did not get me down here
to tell me something you didn't find.

412
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:46,901
The trailer park has a pay phone,

413
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,842
Searched through the phone records.
The day after Vargo moved in,

414
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:53,171
there were three calls placed
from that pay phone to NCIS.

415
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:53,924
Who?

416
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:56,590
Main switchboard.
But by crosschecking the phone log

417
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,790
on the main server against all
incoming calls at the time reference...

418
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:01,567
the legal department.

419
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:04,371
Special Agent Lee.

420
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:17,448
Is this something
I should be seeking advice on?

421
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:18,979
You're the lawyer.

422
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,181
You feel you need counsel,
by all means, call someone.

423
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:25,200
I never knowingly had any contact
with Petty Officer Steve Vargo.

424
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:27,552
He called you three times

425
00:24:27,672 --> 00:24:30,463
from a pay phone at the trailer park
just before he was murdered.

426
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:34,996
Oh, my God. That was him.

427
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,353
- You remember talking to him?
- The timing's right.

428
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,811
And, four months ago,

429
00:24:40,065 --> 00:24:43,480
I received three calls from a man who
refused to identify himself.

430
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,385
It was from a pay phone,
I could hear him feeding the coins.

431
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:48,437
- He wanted legal advice.
- About what?

432
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:51,862
He said he'd been stealing from
the Pentagon. He wouldn't say what.

433
00:24:51,982 --> 00:24:55,025
I figured it was siphoning off money
from a Pentagon account.

434
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:56,578
He refused to say, and

435
00:24:56,764 --> 00:24:59,237
- then he just stopped calling.
- And you didn't tell anyone?

436
00:24:59,412 --> 00:25:01,399
I filed a report and
I put it in the system.

437
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:03,322
It was very thin. Nothing to go on.

438
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:05,385
Nobody ever asked me about it.

439
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,898
If you check my report filings
for that week, you'll find them.

440
00:25:11,665 --> 00:25:13,200
Shouldn't be a problem then.

441
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:17,673
Thank you, Agent Lee. Would you ask
McGee to step in on your way out please?

442
00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:19,349
Yes, sir.

443
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,037
Sir...

444
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:26,883
Sounds credible.

445
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:30,378
That's what Vargo said to me.

446
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:32,378
Maybe.

447
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:38,565
Check Lee's files

448
00:25:38,685 --> 00:25:41,550
on the days that Vargo called and
see if she logged in a report.

449
00:25:41,855 --> 00:25:44,533
Full background checks on
all of them Lee, Keating, Langer.

450
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:46,478
Phone records, bank cards,
credit cards.

451
00:25:46,598 --> 00:25:48,674
- Got it.
- Any update with the hard drive?

452
00:25:48,844 --> 00:25:51,506
Well, we're still trying
to crack the encryption, but

453
00:25:51,626 --> 00:25:53,335
there may be another way.

454
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:56,036
See, I think that we can find out

455
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,258
what classified material Vargo
was downloading.

456
00:25:58,637 --> 00:25:59,457
Go on.

457
00:25:59,577 --> 00:26:02,311
The only information we have is
the file's hash number.

458
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:04,940
- Every file has one.
- And no two are the same.

459
00:26:05,102 --> 00:26:08,450
If we can access the Pentagon's system,
we can scan for that hash number,

460
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,177
and it should lead us
to the file Vargo downloaded.

461
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:13,752
Of course, we would have
to go through some channels.

462
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:15,162
That the fastest way?

463
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:18,534
I was worried you might ask me that.

464
00:26:21,837 --> 00:26:23,626
We didn't have this conversation.

465
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,703
<i>McGoo, it's true.</i>

466
00:26:30,211 --> 00:26:31,592
<i>TV really does add ten pounds.</i>

467
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:33,819
<i>You been hitting
the jelly donuts again? How do I look?</i>

468
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:36,958
I never thought I'd say it and truly
mean it, but it's good to see you, Tony.

469
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:38,846
I miss you, too, probie.

470
00:26:38,978 --> 00:26:41,932
First the USS Ronald Reagan, now
the Seahawk. How's life afloat?

471
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:44,771
Life on the ocean blue, me hearties.

472
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:46,975
<i>The scurvy doesn't get you,
then the pox will.</i>

473
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,220
<i>And tell me this,
me little McShipmate.</i>

474
00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:52,339
<i>How is that scurrilous, black-hearted</i>

475
00:26:52,553 --> 00:26:55,556
<i>pirate king of
ours Captain One-Shot Gibbs?</i>

476
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:57,307
I'm just fine, DiNozzo.

477
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:04,799
<i>There you go, boss. Welcome aboard.</i>

478
00:27:04,974 --> 00:27:06,036
Got work to do.

479
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:07,951
<i>I'm on it, boss. What am I on, McGee?</i>

480
00:27:08,124 --> 00:27:09,441
Are you alone?

481
00:27:09,703 --> 00:27:10,487
Yeah.

482
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,326
Just me and 5,000 of
my closest friends. <i>I am never alone.</i>

483
00:27:17,058 --> 00:27:19,516
- <i>I really need to come home, boss.</i>
- I'm working on it.

484
00:27:19,636 --> 00:27:22,143
The only way that we're gonna access
this information

485
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:25,435
is from a secure naval
communications room, so you are it.

486
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:28,077
Now here it is I'm gonna give you
a code. You're gonna enter it

487
00:27:28,197 --> 00:27:30,091
into the keyboard. When you do,

488
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:33,233
it's going to ask you for a password
and an authorization key.

489
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:35,152
Dad!

490
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,511
<i>This is why I don't want Tim
driving my car.</i>

491
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:42,630
<i>You know, I told Tim that's my car,
and I... it's not a family car,</i>

492
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,234
<i>it's my car. I don't like the cut of
your jib, McGee.</i>

493
00:27:45,354 --> 00:27:47,826
<i>This sounds suspiciously
like illegal activity, and, well,</i>

494
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:52,237
<i>a man of my delicate disposition
is not suited to that kind of thing.</i>

495
00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:54,070
Don't be such a girl, all right?

496
00:27:55,428 --> 00:27:59,033

00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:23,207
<i>But it is illegal, right?
Don't answer that. I know it's illegal.</i>

00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:53,018
<i>A short life, McGee.</i>
Yours, if I get caught.

517
00:28:53,736 --> 00:28:54,462
Great.

518
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,236
Next stop, Gitmo. I got a hit.

519
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,558
Download the summary file
and e-mail it to me.

520
00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:09,339
Well, it's been great talking
with you, Pa. <i>Thanks, Tim.</i>

521
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:13,410
<i>You know I love you guys.</i> It's just
that Tim always messes my stuff up.

522
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:15,924
<i>He doesn't know how to shift gears,
he doesn't change the oil.</i>

523
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,833
Make sure you feed the chickens.
<i>Say hi to Mom.</i>

524
00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:20,714
He's insane.

525
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:23,264
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you, Tony.

526
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:25,943
Look after yourself.
Don't fall overboard, okay?

527
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:27,267
<i>More likely to jump.</i>

528
00:29:29,452 --> 00:29:31,385
- Pa?
- You take care of yourself.

529
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,239
<i>Miss you, too, Dad.</i>

530
00:29:38,134 --> 00:29:39,713
All right, got the e-mail.

531
00:29:44,495 --> 00:29:45,495
Oh, boy!

532
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,953
Now we know what Vargo downloaded.

533
00:29:50,451 --> 00:29:53,421
It's the Joint Chiefs' battle plans
in the event of an attack on Israel.

534
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:55,913
I'm going to have to brief SECNAV.

535
00:29:59,317 --> 00:30:01,426
Our ability to respond
to any threat or attack

536
00:30:01,547 --> 00:30:03,623
in the Middle East
has been compromised.

537
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,403
If this gets in the wrong hands, every
ship in the Gulf will be in danger.

538
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:10,903
Found something. Agent Lee

539
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:14,249
logged into the strategic planning
office at the same time every Friday,

540
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:16,919
for a six-month period
prior to Vargo disappearing.

541
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,798
Logged in at the same time,
logged out 30 minutes later.

542
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:22,378
- Like clockwork.
- She was meeting someone.

543
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:26,834
I wasn't meeting Vargo.

544
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:31,429
You logged in through
the service area.

545
00:30:33,294 --> 00:30:35,044
You never stayed more than 30 minutes.

546
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,795
I never even met Vargo.

547
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:39,534
The first time I saw him was
his dead body at the trailer park.

548
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:41,639
Then who were you meeting
in that building?

549
00:30:42,196 --> 00:30:43,664
Not Vargo.

550
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:46,026
So you were meeting someone,
Agent Lee.

551
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:47,737
Who?

552
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:49,558
Who?

553
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:57,917
Agent Gibbs. You startled me.

554
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,027
- Director Vance.
- Mr. Palmer.

555
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:05,908
You've been seeing Agent Lee, Jimmy?

556
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:08,441
No.

557
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,029
Yes.

558
00:31:15,704 --> 00:31:18,248
I mean... I mean, no.
I mean... I mean, yes,

559
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:20,815
I was seeing her, and no,
I'm not seeing her anymore.

560
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:22,290
Where and when?

561
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:26,803
Here...

562
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:29,158
and there.

563
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:31,444
Here and there. Mostly here.

564
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:35,741
Until Dr. Mallard almost caught us,
and then, we had to change our...

565
00:31:40,404 --> 00:31:41,707
... where we did it.

566
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:42,798
Where?

567
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:44,660
- Building next door.
- When?

568
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:46,700
Every Friday morning.

569
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:49,350
She'd log in, and then...

570
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:51,928
she would open the...

571
00:31:54,128 --> 00:31:56,148
Service door on the parking garage,

572
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,290
and we used the paint locker
in the basement.

573
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:00,879
Paint locker.

574
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,941
- Think she got off on the fumes.
- You still seeing her?

575
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:07,875
- No, sir. Ended a few months ago.
- She end it?

576
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,980
No, I ended it.

577
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:11,538
Sir.

578
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:14,826
Felt I was... being used.

579
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,502
Am I gonna be fired?

580
00:32:24,364 --> 00:32:25,073
No.

581
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:28,737
- And it will not happen again.
- No, sir. It will not happen.

582
00:32:28,971 --> 00:32:31,069
With anyone. Anywhere.

583
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:34,313
I... I mean,
it will happen again. It...

584
00:32:34,547 --> 00:32:37,162
But not with anyone here on the...

585
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:38,935
Thank you.

586
00:32:39,396 --> 00:32:40,202
Sir.

587
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:43,202
I got it, thanks.

588
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:47,342
It was McGee.

589
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:50,042
He found the report that Lee filed
on the anonymous

590
00:32:50,162 --> 00:32:53,392
calls she received from Vargo
while she was in the legal department.

591
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,767
Just like she said.

592
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:57,894
She's in the clear.

593
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,177
One down, two to go.

594
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:04,766
Langer or Keating.

595
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,646
Someone want to tell me
what's going on?

596
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,884
- Anyone?
- Isn't it your turn to get the coffee?

597
00:33:18,223 --> 00:33:20,132
Someone been running
a check on my bank records.

598
00:33:20,254 --> 00:33:21,700
- Ex-wife?
- Internal.

599
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:23,397
- Cyber unit.
- How do you know?

600
00:33:23,517 --> 00:33:25,891
Little security program I wrote
to guard against identity theft.

601
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:28,061
- It just alerted me.
- They can't do that.

602
00:33:28,182 --> 00:33:29,945
It's illegal without a warrant.

603
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:32,567
You might want to write a letter
to your congressman about that one.

604
00:33:32,688 --> 00:33:35,322
So should you. They've been through
your records, too.

605
00:33:35,442 --> 00:33:36,716
How do you know that?

606
00:33:36,836 --> 00:33:39,133
Because I checked. They've been
through your records as well.

607
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:40,902
Yeah, I guessed that already.

608
00:33:41,094 --> 00:33:42,571
So someone in Cyber Unit

609
00:33:42,691 --> 00:33:45,693
is checking for irregularities
in agents' banking records?

610
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:47,963
Not every agent. Just ours.

611
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,817
"We few, we happy few.

612
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:51,479
We band of brothers."

613
00:33:54,235 --> 00:33:55,703
Am I under investigation?

614
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,447
- Should you be?
- I'd like a straight yes or no, sir.

615
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,681
- Keating.
- Sir?

616
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,393
Interrogation room, now.

617
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:11,664
You stay on base.

618
00:34:16,342 --> 00:34:17,738
What the hell's going on?

619
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,269
They think one of us is a spy.

620
00:34:23,383 --> 00:34:25,088
Somebody want to tell me...

621
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:29,737
I have rights.

622
00:34:30,406 --> 00:34:31,406
What was that?

623
00:34:31,692 --> 00:34:33,115
I said that I have rights.

624
00:34:33,661 --> 00:34:35,811
Agent Gibbs, does he have rights?

625
00:34:36,095 --> 00:34:37,845
Yeah, he's got the right
to remain silent.

626
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:40,570
Might make us think he's got
something to hide, though.

627
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:43,209
These are impressive
computer skills, Daniel.

628
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:46,462
MIT grad. Programming.

629
00:34:46,623 --> 00:34:47,640
Encryption.

630
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:50,216
I bet there's not much
you don't know about computers.

631
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:52,055
No. Sir.

632
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,179
So tell me, you ever hacked
into the Pentagon's database?

633
00:34:57,335 --> 00:35:00,268
You might want to take a moment
before you answer that one.

634
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:03,270
Computer stuff, right?

635
00:35:03,673 --> 00:35:04,772
Gotta be Keating.

636
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,449
Brett, don't.

637
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,756
Just looking.

638
00:35:16,036 --> 00:35:16,736
No.

639
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:27,174
Wait.

640
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:28,979
What?

641
00:35:30,398 --> 00:35:32,132
This is a military access card.

642
00:35:32,386 --> 00:35:33,925
Keating's a civilian like us.

643
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:37,430
It's for the computer archives
in Building Three.

644
00:35:37,824 --> 00:35:38,825
Vargo's.

645
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,781
This was evidence. He must have
taken it from the crime scene.

646
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:43,460
And this looks like a password.

647
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:45,035
We should tell Gibbs.

648
00:35:45,155 --> 00:35:47,388
Let's take a look first.

649
00:35:47,683 --> 00:35:50,693
- He said not to leave the building.
- No, he said the base not the building.

650
00:35:50,854 --> 00:35:52,110
Don't go there.

651
00:35:52,272 --> 00:35:54,695
I don't have access to Building Three.

652
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:57,700
But you do.

653
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:09,932
No one home.

654
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:12,917
No one ever is.
It's computer controlled.

655
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,538
We shouldn't be here.

656
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:46,999
If we get caught,
they'll think it's one of us.

657
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:02,390
What?

658
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,980
It's a simple question, Agent Keating.
You've either met him or you haven't.

659
00:37:09,787 --> 00:37:11,439
<i>Excuse me, Director Vance.</i>

660
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:12,831
<i>You need to hear this.</i>

661
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:17,978
We set up an alert system for
all of Vargo's electronic information:

662
00:37:18,098 --> 00:37:20,501
credit cards, toll cards, I.D.
Everything.

663
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:23,037
If anyone tries to use them,
the system sends us an alert.

664
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:24,372
It just did.

665
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,728
Someone is using Vargo's access card

666
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:29,667
to get into the computer archive
section in Building Three next door.

667
00:37:35,124 --> 00:37:37,425
Hell, it's Langer. You watch him.

668
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:44,646
Agent Lee?

669
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:46,867
Lee?

670
00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:11,600
I got it.

671
00:38:13,703 --> 00:38:14,786
It's okay.

672
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,233
It was him.

673
00:38:28,763 --> 00:38:29,998
All the time.

674
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:32,013
It was him.

675
00:38:33,015 --> 00:38:34,857
He's got Vargo's access card.

676
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:43,282
<i>Shalom alaikum, Eli.</i>

677
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,003
<i>Leon Vance.</i>

678
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,424
Leon, shalom.

679
00:38:47,316 --> 00:38:49,245
It is good to hear your voice again,
my friend.

680
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:52,248
- <i>How is your family?</i>
- Complain they don't see enough of me.

681
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,790
The work of intrigue, yes?

682
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,753
It keeps us all away
from our loved ones.

683
00:38:56,828 --> 00:38:57,904
<i>Leon, thank you.</i>

684
00:38:58,024 --> 00:38:59,674
<i>For sending my daughter home to me.</i>

685
00:39:00,614 --> 00:39:02,292
Though I think you...

686
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,131
perhaps had other motives?

687
00:39:04,251 --> 00:39:05,719
Ziva's greatly missed here.

688
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:08,644
She has many friends.

689
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:11,085
<i>Yes, and many </i>talents.

690
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:13,562
You have a daughter?

691
00:39:14,424 --> 00:39:15,424
Yes.

692
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,525
Yeah. Kayla.

693
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:20,820
<i>You know, Leon,
sometimes those who know</i>

694
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:23,697
ask me directly.
The brave among them.

695
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:27,012
<i>But most of the time, the others,
I can feel them looking at me</i>

696
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:29,078
<i>and silently wondering</i>

697
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,134
how can a father possibly

698
00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:33,916
raise his daughter
to be a professional killer.

699
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:36,793
A question that I've never asked you,
because I know the answer.

700
00:39:37,527 --> 00:39:39,504
Every day is a fight to survive.

701
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:41,882
<i>It is my dream that
my daughter will not have</i>

702
00:39:42,043 --> 00:39:44,946
to make that decision
with her sons and her daughters.

703
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:48,276
I would like my grandchildren
to be doctors and architects,

704
00:39:48,396 --> 00:39:49,835
to live a happy life.

705
00:39:50,673 --> 00:39:52,219
To grow fats...

706
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:53,644
and old.

707
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:59,190
You want her back, don't you?

708
00:39:59,988 --> 00:40:01,901
Yes, Eli, I want her back.

709
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:04,654
Tell me, Leon, are we winning?

710
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:12,163
I don't know, Eli.

711
00:40:13,595 --> 00:40:15,245
I like to think we are.

712
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:17,465
And then...

713
00:40:18,775 --> 00:40:20,212
there's something else: a bomb,

714
00:40:20,372 --> 00:40:21,833
<i>a kidnapping, an atrocity.</i>

715
00:40:24,403 --> 00:40:25,932
Use her well, Leon.

716
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,608
Ziva

717
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:31,223
is the sharp end of the spear.

718
00:40:32,815 --> 00:40:33,976
Thank you, Eli.

719
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,518
Shalom, my friend.

720
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:36,684
Shalom to you.

721
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:01,618
- Done?
- Done.

722
00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:04,172
Look... I

723
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:07,843
know you never thought
much of me as a field agent.

724
00:41:08,196 --> 00:41:11,138
You probably never thought
much of me as a lawyer.

725
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:13,349
That's more the profession
than the person.

726
00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:15,893
But if you ever need... I mean...

727
00:41:16,743 --> 00:41:18,979
If the chance ever comes up again...

728
00:41:24,926 --> 00:41:26,153
Might be important.

729
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:29,728
It can wait.

730
00:41:34,196 --> 00:41:35,196
I got it.

731
00:41:35,572 --> 00:41:36,572
Thank you.

732
00:41:41,713 --> 00:41:42,978
Do we know why he did it?

733
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,256
Money, probably.

734
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,804
Well,

735
00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:49,257
thanks.

736
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,053
Be seeing you.

737
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:59,337
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.
McGee, I can't believe it. Pinch me.

738
00:42:01,244 --> 00:42:02,244
Thank you.

739
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:12,426
Hi.

740
00:42:13,361 --> 00:42:14,511
Michelle. Hi.

741
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,914
There she is!

742
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:20,624
Welcome back.

743
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:22,917
It's good to be back.

744
00:42:24,403 --> 00:42:25,997
You're back! You're back!
