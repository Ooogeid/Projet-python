2
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:16,841
I know, come on.

3
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,152
Sit down.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,666
- Why are you hiding?
- 'Cause we weren't invited, Lucas.

5
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:39,398
It's the after party.
It belongs to all of us.

6
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:41,729
An invitation
would have been redundant.

7
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:43,318
It would have been polite.

8
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,666
Come on. They're all going
to be happy to see us.

9
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:48,762
They're never happy to see us at lunch.
Why would it be so different now?

10
00:00:50,164 --> 00:00:50,968
Because.

11
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:53,983
- Come on.
- Okay.

12
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,282
Hey, guys.

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,675
Look what we brought.

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,566
They don't look so happy.

15
00:01:07,405 --> 00:01:09,896
Help. Help, help...

16
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:17,328

20
00:01:55,836 --> 00:01:57,910
- I'm not even going to ask.
- Allow me.

21
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,234
- What are you doing, Tony?
- Best deep-in-thought face.

22
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:03,098
I guess there's a first
time for everything.

23
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:08,379
Nailed it.
All right, strawdawg24, beat this one.

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Yeah, baby.

25
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,217
Ibeatyou.com.

26
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:15,046
The place to compete online
with anyone in anything.

27
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:17,680
Yeah, it's very fun.
It's very addictive. Look at this guy.

28
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:19,848
Best air guitar.
Look at that guy.

29
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,099
Best do the Hustle.

30
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:23,265
I mean, you name it, they got it.

31
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:25,897
- "The Hustle"?
- The Hustle. <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>?

32
00:02:26,108 --> 00:02:27,108
Travolta.

33
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:28,733
You know.

34
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:32,796
- What is the point?
- What is the point of any dance?

35
00:02:32,856 --> 00:02:35,162
It's about letting loose.
It's, you know, having a good time.

36
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:37,158
I meant the Web site, Tony.

37
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:38,609
It's fun.

38
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:39,902
It is...

39
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:41,746
amusement,
light-hearted pleasure.

40
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:43,831
I know what you're doing.

41
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:45,250
I know how to have fun.

42
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:47,252
Really? Do tell.

43
00:02:47,422 --> 00:02:49,161
The hustling and
the deep-thinking photos,

44
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:52,257
those are all just, you know,
child's play. Tell him, McGee.

45
00:02:56,332 --> 00:02:57,332
McGee?

46
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,762
I'm working on
my best psycho face here.

47
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:02,228
That's not bad, probie.

48
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:04,519
Just need to work it
a little bit at the eyebrow.

49
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,025
See what I'm saying?

50
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,437
See how that reads?

51
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,274
See that?
That's what you want.

52
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,475
Would you two like
some time alone together?

53
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:13,132
No, boss. We were just...

54
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,620
- Acting like children.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,782
Got a dead petty officer
in the woods, let's go.

56
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:20,932
- Check out the air guitarists yet?
- I'm in third place right now.

57
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:25,100
Petty Officer Greg Collins.

58
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,290
Twenty-six.

59
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:27,792
Worked as a boatswain's mate

60
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,377
on the USS Shenandoah.

61
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:31,859
On 30-day leave.

62
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:33,384
Lives alone in Norfolk.

63
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:34,972
Gibbs.

64
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:37,529
Found a blood trail, goes this way.

65
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:39,452
Leads back to the car.

66
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:40,659
Run off the road.

67
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,604
You know that just by looking?

68
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:45,941
Listening, DiNozzo.
The sheriff told me.

69
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:51,441
Gonna follow the blood trail.

70
00:03:51,824 --> 00:03:53,071
Wait for me, Pocahontas.

71
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:56,571
Well, this fellow didn't come here
to roast marshmallows.

72
00:03:58,286 --> 00:03:59,638
Blunt force trauma.

73
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:03,661
Glass fragment cuts
on the exposed skin.

74
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:06,331
Seatbelt restraint contusions,
all consistent

75
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,731
- with a...
- Car accident.

76
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,125
Stumbles in looking for help.

77
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:10,793
Yeah, well, he certainly needed it.

78
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:13,591
However, what is strange is that

79
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:16,818
these minor abrasions were tended to,

80
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:20,178
whereas
his most serious injuries were not.

81
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:25,660
This explains it.

82
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:29,311
These wounds are older.
They show signs of primary hemostasis.

83
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:32,859
First stages of scab formation.

84
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:37,862
It appears our deceased
had an unfortunate accident

85
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:40,589
before
he had his unfortunate accident.

86
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:53,941
Someone didn't know
how to parallel park.

87
00:04:54,116 --> 00:04:56,790
I have always found it hard to park
when someone is shooting at you.

88
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,716
Found the slug
in the passenger headrest.

89
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:01,139
Missed its target, huh?

90
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:02,387
Got the job done.

91
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:04,415
Talk to me.

92
00:05:04,727 --> 00:05:07,141
Well, it looks like Collins' car
was shot at, boss.

93
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:10,311
Several partial fingerprints
on the driver's side window here.

94
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:14,533
Time of crash?

95
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:17,402
Well, the kids didn't hear any gunshots
or the crash, so it must've been...

96
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,694
Wasn't a question.

97
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:24,635
The clock on the dash is broken.

98
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,780
Right.

99
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:30,320
7:22 P.M.

100
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:32,819
- Hour before the party started.
- Shoe print.

101
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,876
The victim's?

102
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:38,547
That's not a Chuck.

103
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,272
Collins was wearing "Chuck Taylor"

104
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:43,177
"Converse All-Stars".

105
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:46,096
You know, basketball shoes.
That's not a Chuck.

106
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,518
Somebody else was here.

107
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:49,600
Passenger?

108
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:50,915
Yeah.

109
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:52,521
Or shooter.

110
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:57,094
This is getting like a Greek tragedy.

111
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:01,742
Did you know that legend
has it that in 456 B.C.,

112
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:04,904
a vulture mistook a man's bald head

113
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,978
for its prey
and dropped a stone on it?

114
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:08,713
Killed him instantly.

115
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:11,468
Yeah, the unfortunate fellow
became known as...

116
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,306
The father of Greek tragedy.

117
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:17,086
I had no idea you were familiar
with the classics, Jethro.

118
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,955
Perhaps it's only the tragedies?

119
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:23,301
What do you got for me?

120
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:25,298
Well, like Aeschylus,

121
00:06:25,358 --> 00:06:28,984
our petty officer's death
is both tragic and unique.

122
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:31,546
He suffered two types of injury:

123
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:33,478
those sustained in the car crash

124
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,981
and those inflicted
on him prior to it, see?

125
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:39,984
This fist-shaped bruise
on his forehead,

126
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:42,982
the gouges on his cheek
by the broken jaw.

127
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:44,065
He was beaten.

128
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,490
Savagely.

129
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:48,177
And he fought back as well.

130
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:51,412
See, the knuckles on his right hand
are skinned raw.

131
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:55,333
However, Abby performed a DNA test

132
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,450
on some skin fragments
I found under Collins' fingernails.

133
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,963
Presumably,
they belong to his attacker.

134
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:04,064
Our brilliant forensic scientist

135
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:07,564
has now come up
with something most interesting.

136
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:11,432
The same DNA on Collins' bandages.

137
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:12,893
Same person.

138
00:07:12,953 --> 00:07:16,937
The hands that pummeled the petty
officer also bandaged his wounds.

139
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:20,323
Whoever did this,
Jethro, is both savage

140
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:22,971
and a Samaritan.

141
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:35,748
Do you have the crime scene photos?
I need to cue them up for Gibbs.

142
00:07:35,992 --> 00:07:37,583
Tony was supposed to upload them.

143
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:38,877
Where is he?

144
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:40,047
Big Wong's.

145
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:41,462
It's his turn for takeout.

146
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,817
So this is air guitaring?

147
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:03,767
Yeah.

148
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:07,106
You know,
you pretend to play the guitar.

149
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,198
Why not actually play the guitar?

150
00:08:09,393 --> 00:08:11,284
Because it is called air guitaring.

151
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,428
Right.
I got that part.

152
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:14,928
I still do not understand...

153
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:16,706
Ziva, photos. Plasma.

154
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,545
There are two sets of tire tracks
on the road near the crash.

155
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,714
Based on the vectoring
of the skids, both cars

156
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,497
were traveling
in the same direction.

157
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:29,249
Bullet through the back window.

158
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,344
I smell road rage.

159
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:31,721
And I smell Big Wong.

160
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:35,850
Collins swerves,
rolls down the embankment.

161
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:37,810
The other driver
goes down looking for him.

162
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,811
Finds a corpse and bails,
hit-and-run.

163
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:41,147
Shoot and run.

164
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:47,904
My God, I'm so sorry.
I just...

165
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,077
Shooter could have known Collins.
Ran him off the road on purpose.

166
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:57,359
Well, we'll know soon enough.

167
00:08:57,665 --> 00:09:00,993
Abby's running the prints from
the driver's side window through AFIS.

168
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:04,544
Boss, I've been monitoring Collins' cell
phone activity. He just received a call.

169
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,421
From who?

170
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:07,095
Home security service.

171
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:08,948
Collins' alarm is going off.

172
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,261
I see you like going through
my photos, huh?

173
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:13,740
Yeah, I like reading.

174
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:16,021
Hemingway, Dostoevsky,
guess what he wrote?

175
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:17,512
The Idiot.

176
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:26,442
Clear.

177
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:29,970
Clear inside.

178
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:31,926
But we got something.

179
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,882
Found it in a laundry basket.

180
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:35,698
Maybe the laundromat
was out of quarters.

181
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:37,285
Looks like six, $700 there.

182
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:39,631
They forced the latch
on the back door open.

183
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:40,747
Forgot the money.

184
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:41,882
Gibbs.

185
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:44,543
Blood's dry.
At least a day old.

186
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,214
Looks like
the Tooth Fairy missed one.

187
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,049
A couple more here. Bag 'em.

188
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:53,928
Damn. Neighbors.

189
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:56,006
Come on.

190
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,811
I'm Bruce Solomon.
I live across the street.

191
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:04,397
I'm, Adam Parker,
the duplex with the English ivy.

192
00:10:04,713 --> 00:10:08,095
We... we heard the alarm.
It's been going off for 46 minutes.

193
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:10,474
We did a quick patrol.

194
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:12,405
No signs of any suspicious activity.

195
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:14,073
Let me guess, Neighborhood Watch.

196
00:10:14,662 --> 00:10:15,574
Is Greg okay?

197
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:17,827
Petty Officer Collins is dead.

198
00:10:18,257 --> 00:10:19,930
Car accident, last night.

199
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:22,164
- Oh, my God.
- Was it on Route Ten?

200
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:25,334
'Cause we've petitioned the city for
a turn lane there for a long time.

201
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,087
Collins was murdered.
Run off the road.

202
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:34,044
You don't look surprised.

203
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:36,012
You have a lot of murders here
on Wisteria Lane?

204
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:39,598
Well, it's a, it's a very quiet area,
but ever since Greg moved in...

205
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:40,761
Not so quiet.

206
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:42,713
There's music, parties...

207
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,221
lots of drinking.

208
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:45,271
Last week,

209
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:47,746
it got completely out of hand.
There was this whole gang of them.

210
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:50,579
And then a fight broke out,
but nobody tried to break it up.

211
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,321
They were just standing around cheering.
It was weird. It reminded me of...

212
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:54,509
Tyler Durden.

213
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,157
Yeah, exactly.

214
00:10:56,403 --> 00:10:57,116
Who?

215
00:10:57,387 --> 00:10:59,035
Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, <i>Fight Club</i>.

216
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,163
Sorry, Ziva,
we don't talk about fight club.

217
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:05,766
In your case, I'll make an exception,
boss.

218
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:07,767
Underground backyard brawls.

219
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:10,338
No rules, no gloves, no mercy.

220
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:14,615
There's a huge black market
for underground fight videos.

221
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,010
It starts in the backyard...

222
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:17,813
Ends on the back road.

223
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,482
No match on the partials
from Collins' car.

224
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,182
And this is the best of them.

225
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,953
Partials are a little tougher.

226
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:25,907
But that hasn't stopped me,
nor will it ever,

227
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,641
because I am the Energizer Bunny
of forensic science.

228
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:30,562
I never sleep and I never give up.

229
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:35,988
Help, I'm losing power.

230
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:38,611
Shoe print.

231
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,743
We couldn't match it
to any known brand.

232
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,516
Even Tony didn't recognize it.

233
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,204
You know his shoe collection.

234
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:45,890
We think the shoe was custom-made.

235
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,166
And very pricey.

236
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:49,826
Sweet.

237
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:51,379
I heart the VODD.

238
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,356
Virginia Offender DNA Databank.

239
00:11:55,702 --> 00:11:58,711
Abby ran the DNA from
Collins' bandages and hit the jackpot.

240
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,684
Name?

241
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:05,600
Patience, fearless leader,
I'm just uploading the data right now.

242
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,105
And the winner is...

243
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,166
Sam Bennett.

244
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:13,775
Civilian. Rap sheet includes petty
theft, B and E, disorderly conduct.

245
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:15,625
Doesn't appear to have
a permanent address.

246
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:16,685
Work?

247
00:12:21,947 --> 00:12:23,244
Shiver me timbers,

248
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:26,455
looks like Bennett was part of
a salvage crew on a ship.

249
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:27,982
Navy frigate, boss.

250
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:29,698
USS Rubicon.

251
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,920
You know
how a ship is decommissioned?

252
00:12:34,043 --> 00:12:35,043
Yep.

253
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:38,592
First the military removes all the,
uh, classified material,

254
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:41,137
the electronics, weapons.

255
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:42,852
Yes.

256
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,291
I know.

257
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:49,829
The hull of the ship
is striped for scrap.

258
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:53,495
And if a ship has a history,
it may be turned into a maritime museum.

259
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:55,150
You guys the Navy cops?

260
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,325
Yeah, my seahorse
is double-parked outside.

261
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:59,738
You ought to see the lights.
We're here to talk to Sam Bennett.

262
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:01,949
- Not here.
- Come again?

263
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,861
Bennett,
he's not on the ship.

264
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:06,895
Are you the foreman
that I spoke to earlier,

265
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:08,670
said that Sam Bennett was here?

266
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,376
Yeah, was.

267
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,925
He clocked in earlier today.

268
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,754
He's wanted in connection
with a murder.

269
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:21,519
We're here to speak with him.

270
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:23,345
Look, I can't find him, okay?

271
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,202
I had my crew look everywhere.

272
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:26,782
After I told him

273
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,852
you were coming, he told the guys
he was going out for a smoke.

274
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,439
- He never came back.
- Do you know where he's staying?

275
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:36,236
I don't really ask a lot of questions.

276
00:13:36,753 --> 00:13:39,553
You know, these-these salvage guys,
they're not exactly...

277
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:41,363
Employee of the Month material.
We got it.

278
00:13:41,943 --> 00:13:43,180
Here you go. Sorry.

279
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:48,580
Bennett's on the run.

280
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:51,938
I need a BOLO.

281
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,930
Sam Bennett.
Caucasian male, 23.

282
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:56,938
Go, McGee.

283
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:59,190
Well, Bennett doesn't have a cell.

284
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,216
No e-mail.
No driver's license.

285
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:02,428
No living relatives.

286
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:03,916
Not even a library card.

287
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,136
No. Bennett.

288
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:06,218
As in Tony.

289
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,193
B-E-N-N-E-T-T.

290
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:10,256
He's gotta exist somewhere.
Keep looking.

291
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,689
With an "S".

292
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:13,062
- <i>Sam?</i>
- Yeah.

293
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:15,759
As in Sam I am. Sam.
"Play it again, Sam."

294
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:17,394
- Sam with an "S".
- <i>OK, got it.</i>

295
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:18,422
Oh, my gosh.

296
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,366
He's 23, six foot three, 210 pounds,

297
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:22,738
light brown hair, blue eyes,

298
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:25,331
and a barbwire tattoo
on his left bicep.

299
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:26,994
He was last seen...

300
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:28,577
Standing right behind you.

301
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:42,967
I love it
when they turn themselves in.

302
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:58,194
You want to tell me about Greg?

303
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:07,058
Stood by me
when everyone else bailed.

304
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:13,640
Taught me how to look out for
something else besides just myself.

305
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:16,133
Four-oh sailor.

306
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:19,800
He was my best friend.

307
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:22,644
I made a lot of mistakes.

308
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,762
And he-he turned my life around.

309
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:27,511
I owe him everything.

310
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,598
He got me
the welding gig on the ship.

311
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,345
I'm-I'm good with my hands.

312
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:35,201
Greg's face said the same thing.

313
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,274
Tell me about the fights.

314
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:44,991
Not supposed to.

315
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,071
<i>Fight club.</i>

316
00:15:47,152 --> 00:15:49,572
Told you.
You should look into it sometime.

317
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:52,118
- I'm sure you'd enjoy yourself.
- I remember my first fight.

318
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:53,258
I was eight.

319
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:54,720
Shmuel Rubinstein.

320
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:56,957
Sounds like a real stud.

321
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:59,000
One punch and it was over.

322
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:02,880
What did Shmuel Rubinstein
do to deserve the wrath of Ziva?

323
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:05,061
He said he liked me.

324
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,259
<i>I keep my promises.
He was my buddy.</i>

325
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:09,016
<i>Your buddy's dead.</i>

326
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,954
The locations move around a lot.

327
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:22,337
Last week the fights
went down at Greg's place.

328
00:16:23,825 --> 00:16:25,380
He cleaned up,

329
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:26,945
won some cash.

330
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,239
And the fights yesterday?

331
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,441
Vacant lot in Chesapeake.

332
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:36,914
So you and, Collins,
you fought each other.

333
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:40,417
We didn't want to,
but we didn't have a choice.

334
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:44,257
The-the fights are random draw.

335
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,429
When it was over,
I fixed him up as best I could.

336
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:57,184
Then I killed him.

337
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,641
Wait a minute,
that was way too easy.

338
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,759
He didn't even get the Gibbs glare.

339
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:06,651
- Could be covering for someone.
<i>- ... with my own bare hands.</i>

340
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,823
<i>When my foreman told me that you guys
were looking for me, I freaked out.</i>

341
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:12,866
But I'm done running.

342
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,478
I owe it to Greg to do the right thing
and to turn myself in.

343
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:19,160
You didn't kill him.

344
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:23,544
He's dead because of me.

345
00:17:24,204 --> 00:17:25,545
You in the car with him?

346
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:30,732
No, his-his eyes
were practically swollen

347
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,553
shut from the fight.

348
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,180
I told him that
it wasn't safe to drive.

349
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:37,612
He wouldn't listen.

350
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:43,230
I tried to stop him,
and he just got in his car and he left.

351
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:46,191
Well, 20 minutes later,
somebody shot up his car.

352
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:48,861
What?

353
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:50,988
Crash wasn't an accident.

354
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:53,031
Wait, somebody killed him?

355
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:54,706
Sit down.

356
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:03,167
Who shot at him?

357
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:06,419
- Any fighters have a grudge?
- I don't know.

358
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,128
I don't know any of them.

359
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:11,216
Greg would just bring me in to make some
extra dough when I was tight on cash.

360
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:12,050
Names?

361
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,071
Reaper,

362
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,556
- Wild Dog...
- No, their real names.

363
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,224
I don't know their real names.

364
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:22,037
But when I find out who did this
to Greg, they're gonna know mine.

365
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:25,394
And that is the last thing
they're ever gonna know!

366
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,945
Think one of those backyard brawlers
whacked Collins?

367
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:34,352
Well, I doubt they're
the most stable kind of people.

368
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:37,451
Big, hairy, sweaty Neanderthals
pounding the pudding out

369
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,668
- of each other for giggles?
- For green.

370
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,206
One of those fighters
make a lot of money.

371
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:43,873
I'd pay to see the right bout.

372
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,668
Like Leroy Jethro Gibbs

373
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:48,962
- versus...
- Ziva.

374
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:51,131
McGee,
I was thinking like Terminator.

375
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,550
Which model?
T-X? T-1000?

376
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:54,705
All of them.

377
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:56,271
Gibbs terminates.

378
00:18:56,331 --> 00:18:59,556
All right,
how about Gibbs versus <i>Godzilla</i>.

379
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:00,962
<i>King of the Monsters</i>...

380
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:02,142
toast.

381
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:03,476
Mothra.

382
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:05,395
Wingless in a nanosecond.

383
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,607
Come on,
McGee, give me something fierce.

384
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,334
Boss man's got mad skills.

385
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:11,394
All right.

386
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:15,489
Okay. Gibbs versus...

387
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:18,826
Gibbs.

388
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:20,953
That's good.

389
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:24,032
Okay, so, evil twin or a clone?

390
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,336
Good timing.
I have something to show you.

391
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:33,704
We found three layers of paint
on the left rear quarter panel,

392
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:35,732
silver and then brown,

393
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:38,178
and then silver again
over the original gold.

394
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:40,666
This is old-fashioned bumper cars.

395
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:43,517
By using the tire skids on the road,

396
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:45,510
we were able to recreate
the accident.

397
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:47,461
The first layer of paint is silver.

398
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,348
It came from the evil mystery car.

399
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:52,150
It rams Collins' car.

400
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,360
He swerves.

401
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,924
Pumps the brakes, and
he leaves this tire skid on the road.

402
00:20:00,614 --> 00:20:01,994
Then Collins' was shot at.

403
00:20:02,223 --> 00:20:04,009
The bullet hole in the back window?

404
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,963
And there's
two more slugs in the car.

405
00:20:06,023 --> 00:20:07,590
So, Collins hits the gas,

406
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,294
he burns rubber,
and then fishtails into a barricade.

407
00:20:11,774 --> 00:20:12,893
A brown barricade!

408
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,715
The second layer of paint.

409
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:16,072
Then another, bam!

410
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:18,609
As the evil car hits Collins' car
one last time,

411
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:21,619
sends him off the road
and giving us the final layer

412
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,431
of silver paint,
and confirming its evilosity.

413
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:27,518
The silver base coat,
it contains three properties:

414
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,231
methyl ethyl ketone,
xylene and titanium dioxide.

415
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:34,028
Now,
the first two are common solvents.

416
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:36,284
Titanium dioxide, not so much.

417
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,071
So, we should be able to trace it.

418
00:20:38,151 --> 00:20:39,698
- Then do it.
- Hey, boss.

419
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:41,284
Yes, McGee?

420
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:47,852
Have you ever lost a fight?

421
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,710
Not sure I even ever won one.

422
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,615
Definitely a Gibbs clone.

423
00:20:57,206 --> 00:21:00,148
I'm cross-referencing the paint
against a database of automakers.

424
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,274
Got a match here,
Maserati Quattroporte, 2009.

425
00:21:03,334 --> 00:21:05,264
Need some serious coin
to roll in one of those.

426
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:06,849
- Find it.
- Several registered

427
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:10,524
in the tri-state area.
Two belong to Muhammad Al-Qazir.

428
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:13,106
Unfortunately,
these are both Baltic Black Metallic.

429
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,442
Argenta Silver. Oh.

430
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:16,860
Got it.

431
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,111
Tabitha Summers.

432
00:21:18,747 --> 00:21:19,753
Looks rich.

433
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:21,024
Is rich.

434
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:23,892
Father died three years ago,
left her the family's import business.

435
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:25,785
She's worth over 50 million.

436
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:26,896
Bring her in.

437
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:28,328
I'll send the limo.

438
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:35,773
You're on.

439
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,297
You owe me.

440
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:39,248
Hello.

441
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:44,652
Afternoon.

442
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:48,141
Dale Kapp,
Mrs. Summers' personal attorney.

443
00:21:48,494 --> 00:21:49,768
Can we get this over with?

444
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,674
Sure. This way, please.

445
00:21:57,731 --> 00:22:01,142
That is what they call
the eye of the cougar, probie.

446
00:22:01,401 --> 00:22:02,607
Isn't she married?

447
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:04,658
She's a hunt jungle cat.

448
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:06,618
The cougar is always on the hunt.

449
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,217
It's the nature of the beast.

450
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:12,416
I always thought
cougars like young guys.

451
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:22,509
This is extremely mortifying
for my client.

452
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:24,838
And while she has nothing to hide,

453
00:22:24,898 --> 00:22:26,906
she certainly wouldn't want it
implied in the press

454
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:30,385
that she has anything to do
with your ongoing investigation.

455
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:31,476
You recognize him?

456
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:36,284
No.

457
00:22:38,438 --> 00:22:40,328
Do you recognize this?

458
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:43,188
My car.

459
00:22:43,818 --> 00:22:44,819
Or one of them.

460
00:22:44,945 --> 00:22:47,784
It was involved in
a hit-and-run accident last night.

461
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,395
But my husband and I were both
in to the evening hug

462
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,555
getting massages.

463
00:22:52,615 --> 00:22:54,524
Then we'll need
to talk to your husband.

464
00:22:54,786 --> 00:22:55,667
You are.

465
00:22:58,037 --> 00:23:00,047
Dale is my current husband.

466
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:01,159
Current?

467
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:05,177
Right.
Husband number...

468
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:07,454
three.

469
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:09,514
Four.

470
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,292
Dale handled my previous divorce.

471
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:14,099
<i>Mazel tov</i>.

472
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,432
We never left our home.

473
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:17,022
Car drove itself then?

474
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:18,802
We have a dozen house employees

475
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:20,851
who could have possibly accessed
the motor pool,

476
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:22,694
cooks, gardeners, pool staff.

477
00:23:22,774 --> 00:23:23,539
Names?

478
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,072
And we need to see the car.

479
00:23:25,328 --> 00:23:26,352
Oh, I'm sorry.

480
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:28,575
It's being taken this afternoon
to our home in Nantucket.

481
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:30,827
Actually,
it's going to the Hamptons cottage.

482
00:23:32,604 --> 00:23:33,785
I thought I told you

483
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:36,931
we're spending Christmas in Nantucket.
Don't you ever listen?

484
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,957
Still, we need to see the car.

485
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:41,084
I'll take care of it.

486
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:44,004
Are we done with these people?

487
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:48,013
- Any other questions for my client?
- Need a DNA sample.

488
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:54,035
Is my wife being charged,
Agent Gibbs?

489
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,116
Not yet.

490
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,551
Then we're leaving. Thank you.

491
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:08,298
The old fingerprint-off-the-glass trick.
Who needs DNA.

492
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:11,490
You're right. I need DNA.
It's my lifeblood.

493
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:13,452
Okay, well,

494
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:16,826
doesn't match the partial from the car.
It wasn't Tabitha.

495
00:24:16,951 --> 00:24:19,748
I will start rounding up their house
employees for questioning.

496
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:23,606
I thought you said
her prints didn't match.

497
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,088
That's not from Tabitha's glass.

498
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:27,826
It's from her husband's,

499
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:29,972
- Dale Kapp.
- Get him back here.

500
00:24:30,097 --> 00:24:32,029
He's probably already
off the base by now.

501
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:33,945
- I'll put out a BOLO.
- Cell phone.

502
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,704
I'm already triangulating
for a signal, Gibbs.

503
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:39,217
You've got to be faster than that.
Got him.

504
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:42,826
He's on the phone right now,
and he's still on the base.

505
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:45,797
As a matter of fact,
he is right in front of the building.

506
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,843
That's weird.
Looks like he's driving into the lobby.

507
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,037
DiNozzo, front gate, shut it down.

508
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:54,273
Who are we stopping?
Everyone, I guess.

509
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,628
This is
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

510
00:24:56,688 --> 00:24:59,116
We need to shut down the front gate.
Lock it down.

511
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,716
- Where's your husband?
- I don't know.

512
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:07,045
Spending his last few hours
as a married man?

513
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:09,898
He went to get the car,
and then just drove off.

514
00:25:10,502 --> 00:25:11,557
Left me.

515
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:14,622
First Bennett runs, and now Kapp.

516
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:25,303
Maybe the only thing Kapp's running
from is his wife.

517
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,442
Dangerous.

518
00:25:27,098 --> 00:25:29,542
- You know how fast a cougar can run?
- Not fast enough.

519
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:31,072
She could not catch his car.

520
00:25:31,132 --> 00:25:33,008
Kapp must have known
we were closing in.

521
00:25:34,037 --> 00:25:36,859
- He's running for a reason.
- But she has no idea why.

522
00:25:36,984 --> 00:25:38,767
Says she has never heard of Collins.

523
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:40,564
Well, Kapp obviously has.

524
00:25:40,783 --> 00:25:43,228
Oh, hey, boss. We got his laptop.
It's down with Abby.

525
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:46,751
Spoke with the Summers' masseuse.
Kapp canceled his Shiatsu.

526
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,235
When he was supposedly at home,
a traffic camera

527
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,103
a mile away shows him running
a red light in the Maserati.

528
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:54,551
It time-stamped yesterday, 7:16 PM,

529
00:25:54,676 --> 00:25:56,885
six minutes before Collins
was run off the road.

530
00:25:57,057 --> 00:26:00,892
That's gonna be 400 bucks for a traffic
violation, and 50 years for murder.

531
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:01,978
Motive?

532
00:26:02,656 --> 00:26:04,328
Motive. There's a question.

533
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:10,416
We cross-referenced Kapp and Collins'
cell phone records and credit cards.

534
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:13,195
- We got nothing.
- No apparent connection.

535
00:26:13,465 --> 00:26:14,465
Collins' CO?

536
00:26:14,654 --> 00:26:17,159
Never heard of Kapp.
Neither have any of Collins' shipmates.

537
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,549
Gold-digging
society lawyer and a squid

538
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:23,371
who spends his spare time beating guys
to a pulp. Next, on an all-new <i>Maury</i>.

539
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:26,885
- Yeah, Abs.
<i>- Gibbs, can you come to the lab?</i>

540
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:28,367
Be right down.

541
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:29,711
McGee. Find him.

542
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:32,852
I'm checking to see if there's
any hits on the BOLO. Still nothing.

543
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,758
But my current rank
in the air guitar competition

544
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:41,845
is up with a bullet to second.

545
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,908
You must be so proud.

546
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:46,855
- You're jealous.
- Because you can air guitar?

547
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:48,180
Because you can't.

548
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,378
Tony, I've told you.
I like to have fun in more...

549
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:53,256
adult ways.

550
00:26:53,982 --> 00:26:54,820
Reading.

551
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:56,143
Yes.

552
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:57,322
Reading.

553
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:01,660
Look, everybody
enjoys a good book, but

554
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:05,684
don't you ever have the urge
to just act a little...

555
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:06,749
Childish?

556
00:27:07,344 --> 00:27:09,076
Silly. Stupid.

557
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,331
- Brainless.
- Like you?

558
00:27:11,636 --> 00:27:12,544
Exactly.

559
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:15,786
Tony, you and I come from
two totally different places.

560
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,591
In my world, you grow up, fast.

561
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:20,330
You have no choice.

562
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:21,930
Now you do.

563
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:29,057
I found a series of encrypted files in
a hidden partition in Kapp's computer.

564
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:31,524
A lot of e-mails and
chat room conversations.

565
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,192
Over 20 in the last month,
all from the same screen name.

566
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:36,839
- J-Digg19.
- Plasma.

567
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,365
Decrypt it.

568
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:45,483
We already did, boss. It's...
well, you know, it's a chat room.

569
00:27:46,352 --> 00:27:47,645
It's IM-speak.

570
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:52,419
You wouldn't know. It starts off with,
"Hey, how are you today?",

571
00:27:52,544 --> 00:27:55,952
"fine, thank you."
Gets interesting further down.

572
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,674
He wants to know what she's wearing.

573
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:00,208
Says he wants to take
her shopping for lingerie.

574
00:28:00,332 --> 00:28:03,400
- Then he says...
- Yeah, I get the picture. Who is she?

575
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:06,723
Not his wife.
There's an embedded hyperlink.

576
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:10,211
He's chatting with a Jodi,
and here's her MySpace page.

577
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:13,821
Blink, McGee. It's just a girl.

578
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:15,861
- What? I'm just...
- Gawking?

579
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:17,283
No. Pinging.

580
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:19,738
Boss,
by pinging the site's DNS cache,

581
00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:22,359
we can see what computer
last logged in to Jodi's page.

582
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:25,885
And get the IP address,
which is registered to...

583
00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:27,663
205 Wilcox.

584
00:28:30,684 --> 00:28:32,083
Going by yourself, boss?

585
00:28:32,612 --> 00:28:33,546
Need...

586
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:34,627
backup?

587
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:41,051
Reminds me of
my first apartment in college.

588
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,113
You can almost smell the Ikea.

589
00:28:43,238 --> 00:28:45,361
Come on in! Door's open.

590
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:48,855
NCIS.

591
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:52,227
I'll be right there.
Grab a drink if you want.

592
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,690
Think she was expecting someone.

593
00:28:58,751 --> 00:28:59,736
Want a drink?

594
00:29:00,687 --> 00:29:01,687
Just kidding.

595
00:29:03,297 --> 00:29:05,242
Federal agents.
We need to talk with you.

596
00:29:05,302 --> 00:29:07,797
Did I mention my roommate
went home for the weekend?

597
00:29:08,298 --> 00:29:09,588
Nice timing?

598
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:12,988
We're federal agents. We'd like
to ask you a few questions, ma'am.

599
00:29:13,113 --> 00:29:15,316
You know what? I got an idea.

600
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:18,906
Why don't you strip down
and jump in the shower with me?

601
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,953
No, it's not what you think.
Check it out, boss.

602
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,514
Lipstick camera.

603
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:29,557
We're being watched.

604
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:38,566
There's another one.

605
00:29:42,587 --> 00:29:44,155
Federal agents. We're coming in.

606
00:29:57,764 --> 00:29:58,779
Peekaboo.

607
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:04,423
You see,
things are not what they seem.

608
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:06,665
Jodi's voice was prerecorded.

609
00:30:08,095 --> 00:30:09,809
Maybe it's
one of those voice-activated,

610
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:12,358
motion-activated,
sensor thing-a-ma-jobs.

611
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:13,935
You know, gets her talking.

612
00:30:15,087 --> 00:30:17,440
- Where's McGeek when you need him?
- I got another one.

613
00:30:21,672 --> 00:30:24,907
It's getting kind of lonely in here.
How long you gonna keep me waiting?

614
00:30:31,074 --> 00:30:32,706
Careful, boss, it might be rigged.

615
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:38,505
Or not.

616
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:43,493
Like a sort of a computer
storage megagiga thingy.

617
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:45,165
We're not being watched.

618
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:47,790
We're being recorded.

619
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:54,131
It's kind of like that TV show,
<i>To Catch a Predator</i>.

620
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,978
Yeah. Only,
this is more like "To Catch a Sucka".

621
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:58,522
Here's how the scam works.

622
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,900
Jodi hangs out in chat rooms,
looking for unhappily married men.

623
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:04,412
Unfortunately,
when the men show up, there is no Jodi.

624
00:31:04,537 --> 00:31:05,711
Just video cameras.

625
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:07,587
Yep. Recording everything.

626
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:09,657
Then the mark
gets e-mailed a threat,

627
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,801
saying if they want that videotape
to disappear, they got to pay.

628
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:13,957
Ten Gs.

629
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:16,292
I'm trying to find
the owner of the Web site now.

630
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:19,387
- Lot of cash for Joe Blow.
- Blackmailer isn't targeting Joe Blow.

631
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:20,296
No.

632
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,046
He is targeting...

633
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:24,434
men with rich wives.

634
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:26,215
Suckas like this guy.

635
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,013
- Dale Kapp.
- If he gets naked, I'm out of here.

636
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:34,573
Video footage on this server
going back almost two years.

637
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:36,950
Well, wherever Jodi is,
she's making a killing.

638
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:39,668
She isn't anywhere.
She doesn't exist.

639
00:31:40,372 --> 00:31:42,561
I ran facial-recognition
software on Jodi.

640
00:31:42,686 --> 00:31:46,194
I traced the face back to a modeling
Web site in the Ukraine.

641
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:48,258
- The image was stolen.
- So,

642
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:51,159
who's the man
behind the shower curtain?

643
00:31:51,438 --> 00:31:54,436
And we have a winner.
The e-mail account is registered to...

644
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,380
Petty Officer Collins.

645
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:00,561
Got our motive.

646
00:32:00,812 --> 00:32:02,907
Kapp didn't want to pay
and killed Collins.

647
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:06,812
BOLO came back on Kapp's town car.
It is parked outside Collins' house.

648
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:17,805
Kapp's ride.

649
00:32:18,992 --> 00:32:20,117
Why did he come here?

650
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:21,850
Probably
looking for any backup copies

651
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:24,143
Collins had
of the incriminating footage.

652
00:32:25,322 --> 00:32:27,819
- Hood's still warm.
- Boss, I got the front.

653
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:53,613
Looks like we missed another fight.

654
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:03,688
Somebody just murdered our murderer.

655
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,693
Our man has been murdered,
our killer killed.

656
00:33:18,924 --> 00:33:20,058
Kapp capped.

657
00:33:21,005 --> 00:33:23,124
He has a possible fractured skull.

658
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,365
And there's multiple contusions
to his head.

659
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:27,533
Beaten to death?

660
00:33:27,593 --> 00:33:31,489
The usual disclaimer until I do
a thorough examination.

661
00:33:31,873 --> 00:33:33,783
- Fists?
- Something harder.

662
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:37,122
- With an edge.
- Boss.

663
00:33:40,032 --> 00:33:41,346
Like a length of wood.

664
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:42,894
Got a witness, boss.

665
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:45,336
There was someone here today
after lunch.

666
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:48,149
One of Collins' friends:
big guy with fair hair.

667
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,902
I got a really good look at him.

668
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:53,790
Sam Bennett.

669
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,407
Got a BOLO out in every homeless shelter
in Norfolk, boss.

670
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,159
Coordinate with Norfolk PD.

671
00:33:58,636 --> 00:33:59,641
Already done.

672
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:01,693
Bennett must have known
something we didn't.

673
00:34:02,452 --> 00:34:04,091
Found out Kapp was the killer.

674
00:34:05,514 --> 00:34:07,837
- He did say he would get payback.
- And he did.

675
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:11,161
Beat Kapp to a pulp with a 2x4
after we released him.

676
00:34:11,357 --> 00:34:13,188
- Where is he going?
- Well,

677
00:34:13,788 --> 00:34:15,599
doesn't have any family. No money.

678
00:34:15,816 --> 00:34:18,164
BOLO doesn't come back soon,
he's gonna disappear.

679
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:21,099
You need to unplug yourself
from <i>the Matrix</i>,

680
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:23,508
do some old-school sleuthing,
Pinkerton.

681
00:34:24,202 --> 00:34:26,078
It's all about asking
the right question.

682
00:34:26,203 --> 00:34:27,606
Well, ask away, DiNozzo.

683
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:30,746
Why did Kapp rabbit out of here,
leaving his wife behind?

684
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:32,616
Why did he go straight to
Collins' house?

685
00:34:32,676 --> 00:34:34,946
And how did Bennett
know to find him there?

686
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,948
- He didn't find him.
- He lured him.

687
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:39,783
Easy enough all Bennett had to do
was phone Kapp,

688
00:34:39,908 --> 00:34:42,913
tell him he had a couple of photos
of him showing up to Jodi's apartment.

689
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:46,721
Running Kapp's cell phone records.

690
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,224
There.

691
00:34:51,238 --> 00:34:53,589
Got a call after
he left us and dumped his wife.

692
00:34:54,412 --> 00:34:56,800
- Bennett.
- Tracing the call.

693
00:34:57,814 --> 00:35:00,504
Came from Collins' house.
Bennett must have been there.

694
00:35:00,629 --> 00:35:02,002
Left before we arrived.

695
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:06,363
Got it. Collins' phone records.

696
00:35:06,602 --> 00:35:09,016
Five calls to his house
from a pay phone located at...

697
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:12,483
Western Dock. Where the USS Rubicon
is being decommissioned.

698
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:13,892
Gear up.

699
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:18,943
- How's that for old-school slothing?
- Sleuthing, having fun yet?

700
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:26,414
No one home.
Salvage guys have called it a day.

701
00:35:27,462 --> 00:35:28,636
Hey, keep it down.

702
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:34,588
Sorry.

703
00:35:47,816 --> 00:35:50,051
- Lost the lights.
<i>- Knows we're here.</i>

704
00:36:01,143 --> 00:36:03,432
Found Bennett's crash pad, boss.

705
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,543
Why does it always
have to be rats and boats?

706
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,107
McGee, heading your way.

707
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,221
Federal agent, stay where you are.

708
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:38,071
Boss, C-deck,
heading towards the bow.

709
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:54,590
Status, McGee.

710
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:02,259
- Anybody got eyes on McGee?
<i>- Negative.</i>

711
00:37:02,658 --> 00:37:04,095
No sign of him, boss.

712
00:37:09,195 --> 00:37:09,937
Got him.

713
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:13,901
Way to go, McGee.

714
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:17,446
Taking down the fight club champ.
I'm almost impressed.

715
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:20,135
Well, I would be, too, except

716
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,806
he fell over and hit his head
while he was trying to get away.

717
00:37:27,147 --> 00:37:29,209
You killed him. You killed Kapp.

718
00:37:29,303 --> 00:37:30,003
No.

719
00:37:30,063 --> 00:37:32,737
You beat him to death with
a lump of wood, not your fists.

720
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:33,825
No!

721
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:36,249
Perhaps not the fighter
you think you are.

722
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:40,358
It wasn't me.
It wasn't.

723
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:49,933
McGee, I'm busy.

724
00:37:50,278 --> 00:37:52,560
If I find anything,
you will be the second to know.

725
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,937
I'm up to my choker collar
in dried blood

726
00:37:55,062 --> 00:37:57,398
and partial fingerprints
and wood splinters.

727
00:37:57,601 --> 00:38:00,108
Gibbs wants anything
I can find to pressure Bennett.

728
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,469
Then, why are you running
a WHO-IS search?

729
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,152
I found some anomalies in
the extortion e-mails Kapp received.

730
00:38:06,277 --> 00:38:08,826
I'm trying to track down
the source of a header mismatch.

731
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:13,180
I got a ding.

732
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,103
Now, that's a ding.

733
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:19,837
That's not a ding.

734
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:21,778
That's a leech.

735
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:23,911
I told you, it wasn't me.

736
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:34,852
You told Agent Gibbs
you would kill whoever

737
00:38:35,071 --> 00:38:38,175
was responsible
for Petty Officer Collins' death.

738
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:40,716
When you found out it was Kapp,

739
00:38:40,966 --> 00:38:42,613
you called him from Collins' house.

740
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:45,533
- I wasn't at the house.
- Yes, you were.

741
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,034
- No, I wasn't.
- We have a witness who saw you there.

742
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,702
I didn't do it.

743
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:03,384
Do you know what a lineup is, Sam?

744
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,272
All right, thank you.

745
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:13,580
Hey, thanks for coming, Mr. Parker.

746
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:15,664
Just doing my civic duty,
Agent Gibbs.

747
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:28,658
That's him.

748
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:31,104
That's the man I saw.

749
00:39:37,357 --> 00:39:41,158
That's him, that's the guy,
<i>the one I saw at Greg's house.</i>

750
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:44,978
What is this?

751
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:48,331
Well, you've just been identified
by an <i>eyewitness who</i>

752
00:39:48,456 --> 00:39:50,716
<i>saw you beat Dale Kapp</i>
to death this afternoon.

753
00:39:50,841 --> 00:39:52,074
You believe him?

754
00:39:52,786 --> 00:39:54,557
No, no, not just him.

755
00:39:54,752 --> 00:39:57,637
Collins' Wi-Fi signal
wasn't password-protected.

756
00:39:58,392 --> 00:40:01,218
As a result,
anyone could use it, and you did.

757
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,847
Called leeching.

758
00:40:03,696 --> 00:40:07,347
They traced the sender, they would have
ended up at Collins' house, not yours.

759
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:08,918
You were the leech.

760
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:12,328
<i>Guess Kapp didn't want to pay up,</i>
came looking for you.

761
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:15,260
- Found Collins.
- I'm not saying anything.

762
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:19,562
You don't have to.
We got enough on you anyway.

763
00:40:28,186 --> 00:40:29,539
You can shut it off.

764
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:39,017
<i>I was gonna stay at Greg's house.</i>

765
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,871
<i>Look after his stuff, you know?</i>

766
00:40:43,478 --> 00:40:44,732
<i>I was in the bedroom...</i>

767
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:49,015
<i>... and I heard the back door open,</i>

768
00:40:50,636 --> 00:40:53,402
<i>so I hid.
Didn't want to get in trouble.</i>

769
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:56,547
<i>It was that guy,</i> Parker.

770
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:01,546
<i>Used the phone, made a call.</i>

771
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,642
<i>The man that killed Greg.</i>

772
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:10,038
<i>Pay up or else.</i>

773
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:13,291
<i>So, I waited.</i>

774
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,627
<i>I wanted to see who he was.</i>

775
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,912
<i>And then, when he got there,
Parker hit him with a piece of wood.</i>

776
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:23,976
<i>And hit him.</i>

777
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,590
<i>And...
I just stood there...</i>

778
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,700
<i>watching from the window,
and I didn't...</i>

779
00:41:38,702 --> 00:41:40,076
<i>... I didn't stop him.</i>

780
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:46,016
<i>Because I wanted him dead, too.</i>

781
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:02,771
Midnight screening of <i>GoodFellas</i> tonight
at the multiplex you want to come?

782
00:42:03,012 --> 00:42:05,440
No, not tonight.

783
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:07,898
All right, enjoy the book.
