2
00:00:02,778 --> 00:00:03,781
It got ugly.

3
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:05,691
Didn't think I was going
to get out of there.

4
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:07,164
No, he still hasn't checked in.

5
00:00:07,283 --> 00:00:09,253
I'll let you know as soon as I know.

6
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:15,002
Tell me you have it.

7
00:00:15,412 --> 00:00:17,149
How much time have you had?

8
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:19,029
Dude, it's a keg!

9
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,359
You go to the liquor store,
pick it up.

10
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:24,569
Here's the thing about surprise parties,
okay?

11
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:26,505
They're supposed tobe a surp...

12
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:45,154
<i>Dude, what was that?</i>

13
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:46,606
<i>Chris, man, talk to me.<i>

14
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:49,260
<i>What's up, dude, are you there?</i>

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,882
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- I got into an accident.

16
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:53,348
<i>- Accident?</i>
- I'll call you back.

17
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:54,757
Don't worry.
I'm fine.

22
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,500
It was a simple question, McGee.

23
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:50,693
Yeah, one I would expect from Tony,
not you.

24
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:52,220
I'm just being curious.

25
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:53,769
About when I lost my virginity?

26
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,862
No, you misunderstood.

27
00:01:54,863 --> 00:01:57,451
I'm not asking when you lost
your virginity but if...

28
00:01:57,716 --> 00:01:58,900
you lost it.

29
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:04,462
What's wrong with this picture?

30
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:07,226
You mean, aside from
Tony being here before us?

31
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,632
And actually working?

32
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:10,206
I can hear you, you know?

33
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:21,093
I am here if you would like to talk.

34
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:22,445
About what?

35
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:24,712
I know how much you cared about her.

36
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:26,664
I'm fine, Ziva.

37
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:30,056
All right, but I thought maybe
you need a little cheering up?

38
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:33,825
If needed to be cheered up, I would've
put superglue on McGee's keyboard.

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,123
You put superglue on my keyboard.

40
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:40,936
- You got me.
- Come on.

41
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:42,961
I was sort of saving it
for a rainy day.

42
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:44,057
Did it help?

43
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,695
- Didn't hurt.
- You know...

44
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,042
- Boss, Tony...
- I know.

45
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:00,102
Are you ever going to learn, McGee?

46
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:04,263
Grab your gear, we got
a petty officer in a hit-and-run.

47
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,378
Guys...

48
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:12,834
Little help, please.

49
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:18,279
Hit-and-run.

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,053
it's a felony now, but in DiNozzo's
Guide to Women, a way of life.

51
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,420
In this case, death.

52
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:25,821
How did he end up over here?

53
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,122
Good question, DiNozzo.

54
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:28,959
At least he went out looking sharp.

55
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,532
But when he dressed this morning,

56
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:33,632
I doubt he was aware
that the end was nigh.

57
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:36,369
When people choose not
to wear their seat belts,

58
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,983
they rarely consider
their own mortality.

59
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:42,878
If they did, they would definitely
wear their seat belts.

60
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:44,948
You know, I would've thought
with that kind of

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,334
damage he would be
all the way down there.

62
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,278
Did you move my body, Jethro?

63
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,375
Someone did.

64
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:53,682
Well, the state police said they didn't
touch the body after they ID'd him.

65
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:56,318
Report indicated he blew
that stop sign over there.

66
00:03:56,426 --> 00:03:58,308
Swerved to avoid another car.

67
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,158
Then he went through the windshield
when he hit the bridge?

68
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:03,499
Hello.

69
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:04,988
This just keeps getting better.

70
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,492
I'm going with stripper.

71
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:12,567
This is not an uncommon way for young
servicemen to...

72
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:14,687
complement their incomes.

73
00:04:14,944 --> 00:04:17,570
In fact, when I was young,
I used to...

74
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:22,245
Used to what?

75
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:23,761
Oh, my...

76
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:25,390
Shotgun, close range.

77
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:27,882
Our hit-and-run just
became shoot-and-scoot.

78
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:32,310
But there's no visible
damage to the head.

79
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:35,107
I do not believe
that this gentleman...

80
00:04:36,178 --> 00:04:37,797
made that hole.

81
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:40,112
And if he didn't make it, who did?

82
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:44,634
The more I think about it,
the more I can't believe we fell for it.

83
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,121
Tony with a girlfriend?

84
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:48,738
I believe he had real
feelings for her, McGee.

85
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:51,925
I don't doubt that...
see what she looks like?

86
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:54,469
Sounds like you wish
you had the assignment.

87
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,306
Yeah, I don't know why the director
didn't give it to me to begin with.

88
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,001
Still talking about the little
probie losing his virginity?

89
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:02,364
Down here!

90
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:07,182
There.

91
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:10,422
This is more like it.

92
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,109
She has a smashed cranium,

93
00:05:13,177 --> 00:05:16,334
lacerations and possible
multiple fractures.

94
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:19,151
I think we've found our
human cannonball.

95
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,971
I think the state police
definitely had it wrong, boss.

96
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,410
Petty Officer Munoz didn't
blow off that stop sign.

97
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:25,714
Nah, he was in the other car.

98
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:27,752
He got run off the road
by the guy who did.

99
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,540
Then got shot for his trouble.

100
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:30,899
No footprints.

101
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:35,139
Her companion took off in Munoz's
vehicle and left her here to die.

102
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,391
Who does that?

103
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:39,170
Clearly, someone in a terrible rush.

104
00:05:39,568 --> 00:05:40,745
Rush to where?

105
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:44,315
Well, we know where Petty
Officer Munoz was in a rush to.

106
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:47,176
We spoke to his roommate.
Munoz was throwing a surprise

107
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:49,844
party for one of his friends
who just arrived from Iraq.

108
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,166
But he was late coming back from...

109
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,680
the Chelsea Girls School
Class of '57 50 year reunion.

110
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:58,537
And I got the pictures to prove it.

111
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:07,531
My God.

112
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:10,015
It's like Cocoon meets
Dirty Dancing.

113
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:12,391
I wonder if Ducky
has dreams like this.

114
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,765
Gibbs probably isn't too far behind.

115
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:19,449
He's standing right behind me,
sorry about that, boss?

116
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:23,069
Going to be your dreams one day,
too, DiNozzo.

117
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,653
Well, maybe Petty Officer Munoz
danced with the wrong woman.

118
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:29,252
And was run off the road
by a jealous husband.

119
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:31,965
What, in his motorized wheelchair?

120
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:34,244
Come on, guys, this is pretty simple.

121
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:37,566
We're looking for a bad guy who got into
an accident, and then he carjacked Munoz

122
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,468
cause he wanted to get
the hell out of Dodge.

123
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,173
Put out a BOLO on Munoz's truck.

124
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:43,772
We got a few more leads to follow,
but... my gut

125
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:47,539
tells me that Munoz had a terminal
case of wrong place, wrong time.

126
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:50,472
Unless your gut...

127
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,953
told you something else, boss.

128
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:54,522
- The girl.
- Yeah, we got a hit on the prints.

129
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:59,249
Heidi Campisano, 25. Though
this picture's three years old.

130
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:02,186
Pyramid schemes, Internet fraud,
bogus rare coins.

131
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:03,689
She is a con artist.

132
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:04,808
Was.

133
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:06,613
Dropped off the radar
three years ago.

134
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,438
I'm guessing since she's laying
in our morgue it wasn't to go legit.

135
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
The car hers?

136
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:13,121
No.
Car is registered to Nicholas Barnes.

137
00:07:15,073 --> 00:07:16,115
DiNozzo!

138
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:17,547
Here.

139
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:24,021
Nicky!

140
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,448
Get your ass out here!

141
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:31,570
Run in the bathroom like a little
girl when he saw you guys pull up.

142
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,331
This is about Tiffany, right?

143
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:36,065
Tiffany?

144
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:37,263
Yeah, his girl.

145
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:38,598
Nicky!

146
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,678
The name's not Tiffany.

147
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:42,941
Oh, really.

148
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:44,606
You don't say.

149
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:47,134
I told him that girl was no good.

150
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,504
He didn't listen to me.

151
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:54,299
Well, there's some Navy cops here
want to ask you a few questions.

152
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:56,908
Now, you remember what I told
you about telling lies.

153
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:05,684
Something wrong?

154
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:06,652
Nope.

155
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,250
Just had to pee all of a sudden?

156
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:12,453
Figured you want to ask me about Tiff,
didn't really want to talk about her.

157
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:13,579
Is that a crime?

158
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:14,455
No.

159
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:15,576
But murder is.

160
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:18,132
Oh, murder!
Perfect!

161
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:19,325
You know this guy?

162
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:21,381
Nope.

163
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:24,942
He was shot and killed today.

164
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:28,041
Your car was found at the scene
wrapped around a bridge.

165
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:29,742
Not my car.

166
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,711
I gave it to Tiff.

167
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:36,156
She said hers was stolen.

168
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:38,296
Oh, tell 'em what else you gave her.

169
00:08:39,224 --> 00:08:40,554
A thousand bucks.

170
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:41,722
Tell 'em why.

171
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:43,314
Oh, for an operation.

172
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:45,155
What kind?
He didn't even ask.

173
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,273
You also didn't ask how she was.

174
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,688
Car wrapped around a tree and all.

175
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,116
I hope she's dead.

176
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,660
She is.

177
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:01,858
If you'd like us to arrest you now,
Nicky, that can be arranged.

178
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:03,535
Hey, now, wait a second.

179
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,013
Just hold on right there.

180
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,400
My boy ain't guilty of anything
except for being an idiot.

181
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,016
Now, that girl Tiffany,

182
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:12,987
or whoever she was, she was playing
him and a couple of other guys.

183
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:16,264
He spoke up to her about it, and she
run off, that was about a week ago.

184
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,022
She said she loved me.

185
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:21,941
You don't lie to somebody you love.

186
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,393
<i>Do you know how
wonderful it is to be with</i>

187
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:27,536
<i>someone who doesn't even
lie about the little things?</i>

188
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:30,713
<i>How can I ever trust you again?
Why? Why? Why?</i>

189
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:31,768
DiNozzo.

190
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:35,823
Sorry, boss.

191
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:37,655
I ain't seen her since she left.

192
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:39,893
Anybody seen you this morning?

193
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:42,652
Oh, he was here with me, all day.

194
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:45,507
I got about a half a dozen
customers who can vouch for that.

195
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,554
- Names.
- Sure.

196
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:51,829
Like I said, my boy's an idiot,
but he ain't a killer.

197
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,995
Now, a girl like that,
playing with people's hearts,

198
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,360
you track down some
of them jilted lovers.

199
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,794
I guarantee you'll find out
who done her in.

200
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:01,645
I can't wait to make those calls.

201
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:04,751
The demise of someone as young as

202
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:06,310
you is always a tragedy,

203
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:09,160
but someone in your chosen...

204
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:11,123
profession, it's to be expected.

205
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:13,499
Yeah, for example,
did you know that the...

206
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,665
infamous confidence man,

207
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:17,167
Victor Lustig,

208
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:20,736
sold the Eiffel Tower, almost twice,

209
00:10:21,044 --> 00:10:23,493
but then he convinced Al Capone

210
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:26,735
to buy $50,000 of bogus shares.

211
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:32,643
What do we have here?

212
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:46,585
You're late.

213
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:50,272
- We have an appointment, Duck?
- No, we have a crisis.

214
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:52,837
I apologize for not seeing it sooner.

215
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,646
You know how I feel about apologies.

216
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,164
Yes, well, you may want to make
an exception in this case.

217
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:00,981
I now know

218
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:05,473
why the driver of the Chevy didn't
bother to check on his companion.

219
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:06,844
She was dead...

220
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:08,979
before she was put in the car.

221
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:12,069
All her vehicular injuries
are postmortem.

222
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,280
How?

223
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:15,074
Extensive blunt force trauma.

224
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,297
She had a subdermal hematoma that would
almost certainly have proved fatal.

225
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,664
Poor girl was beaten to death.

226
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:26,784
Thanks, Duck.

227
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,246
Well, I knew all that an hour ago.

228
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:31,810
What I just learned was

229
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:34,148
that she had been pregnant.

230
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,629
She gave birth?

231
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:36,940
Yeah.

232
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,988
Right before she was murdered.

233
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,937
Hey, Abs, hope you don't mind,
but I need to use one of your computers.

234
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:53,622
Hard to concentrate while Tony's
calling Heidi's former victims.

235
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,354
He's become very sensitive
to the word "liar" these days.

236
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:01,161
Thought you quit.

237
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,810
McGee, there is a baby missing
that might need medical attention.

238
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:07,484
I need to be at the top of my game.

239
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:09,537
Going to spend most of
your game in the bathroom.

240
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:10,701
I already thought of that.

241
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:14,122
I'm upping my salt intake
to increase my body's water retentions.

242
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:15,398
Of course you are.

243
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:22,167
So what do you have for Gibbs?

244
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:23,810
Nothing.

245
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,135
Why, is he on his way down here?

246
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,371
No, he's here.

247
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,832
And he's talking about
himself in the third person.

248
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:31,998
I like it.

249
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:33,430
Ducky said you had something.

250
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,740
Don't you want to see
what McGee has first?

251
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:37,681
I came down to see you.

252
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:43,255
Abby was able to recover amniotic fluid
from the dead woman's clothing.

253
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:44,608
You got the baby's DNA?

254
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:46,251
Abby's running it now.

255
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,584
You can't use it to find the father,
but when you have a suspect,

256
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:53,109
Abby can test it and
see if he is the father.

257
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:54,194
Nicholas Barnes.

258
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,746
Abby already ruled him out.

259
00:12:55,815 --> 00:12:57,025
Not the same blood type.

260
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:58,438
Good work, Abby.

261
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,327
McGee is going through
Heidi's records now.

262
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:09,946
Problem is, because she had
so many fake identities,

263
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:12,608
there's about ten times
the amount of normal data.

264
00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:16,043
Plus, most of the activity
is over three years old.

265
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:22,151
But luckily, a snooper program I was
running did find one, two, three,

266
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:26,382
four sizable deposits made
to her account recently

267
00:13:26,577 --> 00:13:29,586
from a man named...
Adrian Nelson.

268
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:31,611
Maybe that's another
boyfriend she conned.

269
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:33,388
We'll let you know when we get back.

270
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,121
Abby has to pee.

271
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:46,518
Heidi Campisano.

272
00:13:47,248 --> 00:13:49,165
No, I'm sorry,
I don't recognize the name.

273
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:51,849
Well, she's got a lot of them,
Mr. Nelson.

274
00:13:52,502 --> 00:13:53,505
Maybe.

275
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:54,974
I travel a lot.

276
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:56,040
Travel where?

277
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:58,810
Trade shows.
My husband's a computer programmer.

278
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,529
Well, I work in domotics.

279
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,790
It's home automation.

280
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:04,682
The application of...

281
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:08,193
Automated techniques for the comfort
and security of the home resident.

282
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:10,911
I can control the entire house.

283
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:12,767
Lights...

284
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:15,364
media...

285
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:18,195
fireplace...

286
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:23,067
even turn on the lawn sprinklers
if someone isn't supposed to be here.

287
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:25,721
- Who is she?
- Who was she.

288
00:14:25,722 --> 00:14:26,837
She's dead, murdered.

289
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,341
And her newborn is missing.

290
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:30,854
Why are you telling us this?

291
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:32,610
We've traced several recent

292
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:35,400
deposits made to her account
from your husband.

293
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,780
From me?

294
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,777
Well, there's...
there's got to be some mistake.

295
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:41,523
You said that she uses
a lot of names, right?

296
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:43,340
Maybe she's stolen my identity.

297
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:45,841
Like I said, I travel a lot.
It wouldn't be hard to do.

298
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,631
I can settle this.

299
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,091
Feel free to look around.

300
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:52,868
But if my husband says he doesn't
know her, he doesn't know her.

301
00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:54,380
Right?

302
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:55,657
That's right, honey.

303
00:14:57,848 --> 00:14:59,391
Well, that isn't supposed to happen.

304
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:01,109
I'm going to have to reset the breaker.

305
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,943
- Excuse me.
- Here, I'll give you some help.

306
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:06,572
Reset switch is just in here.

307
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,468
How long you been seeing Heidi?

308
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:15,668
I told you, I don't know anything...

309
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:16,930
No, you told your wife.

310
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:18,340
And I let you.

311
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:19,673
But now I get the truth.

312
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,212
Just a few months.

313
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:28,542
Till I found out she was
stealing money from me.

314
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,729
She was forging my
signature on my checks.

315
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,881
We barely saw each other
and we never slept together.

316
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,880
- Baby's not yours.
- No, it's not.

317
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:36,943
I need your DNA to verify that.

318
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,342
Forget it. I'm not going on record that
I was ever involved with that woman.

319
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:42,783
You need DNA, you're going
to have to talk to my lawyer.

320
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:44,652
Maybe I'll just talk to your wife.

321
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:47,820
Is your evidence that flimsy
that you have to resort to threats?

322
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:50,480
I had nothing to do with
Heidi's murder, okay?

323
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:54,028
But if you got something that says
I did, you should go get a warrant.

324
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:55,905
Far enough?

325
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:58,151
Oh, yeah.

326
00:15:58,246 --> 00:15:59,963
Yeah, I guess it'll have to be.

327
00:16:02,472 --> 00:16:03,475
Adrian.

328
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:08,440
<i>Everything's fine, honey.
They're going to show themselves out.</i>

329
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:10,316
- Everything's not fine.
- Got it?

330
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:15,061
Fingernails clippings,
toothbrush swabs and Q-tips.

331
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,057
He lied to us.

332
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:20,049
This is a check to Heidi Campisano
from Adrian Nelson's account.

333
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:22,737
This is a known sample
of his handwriting.

334
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,083
The signature's real.

335
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:25,291
Four checks.

336
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:26,509
$10,000 total.

337
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:28,091
Heidi didn't steal anything.

338
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,742
Adrian sent her the money himself.

339
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:30,935
Did more than that, McGee.

340
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:32,154
Tried to hide it from us.

341
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:32,976
DNA?

342
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:34,314
Abby's still working on it.

343
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,205
Come on, that's not what I'm saying.

344
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,107
Boss, since we got
a pretty strong lead here,

345
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,017
can Tony stop calling Heidi's
other marks looking for suspects?

346
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:44,496
Listen, I am simply saying just
because she was lying to you,

347
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:46,876
doesn't mean that she
didn't really love you.

348
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:48,389
Hello?

349
00:16:54,118 --> 00:16:55,118
What?

350
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:57,265
Let him call a few more.

351
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,408
We have two theories
to explain the dishonesty.

352
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,340
- Theory number one:
- Heidi Campisano seduced Adrian Nelson.

353
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:04,775
Then blackmailed him
threatening to tell his wife.

354
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,195
She had done it before plus,
it would explain the payments.

355
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:08,913
And the fact she is now dead.

356
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:12,392
Theory two: Adrian found out that
Heidi was pregnant with his baby.

357
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:13,729
Also explain the payments.

358
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,067
And the fact she is now dead.

359
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,783
With those options,
I would've lied, too.

360
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:18,477
But no doubt, more effectively.

361
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:20,560
But thinking more optimistically,

362
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,239
I took the liberty of going
out and getting this

363
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:26,775
- for when you find our missing newborn.
- Any word?

364
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,806
Yeah, I checked all the hospitals
in the area and beyond.

365
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:32,526
No babies on any doorsteps.

366
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,871
But you weren't expecting any,
were you?

367
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:36,517
Killer's got the baby, Ducky.

368
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:39,098
Only way we're going to find
that kid is to find the killer.

369
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:41,110
Okay, I'm on my way.

370
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:43,748
You got something, DiNozzo?

371
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:45,656
Yeah, dentist appointment.

372
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:50,369
No...

373
00:17:51,494 --> 00:17:52,864
This is for real, guys.

374
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,561
I... remember I chipped my tooth
and I got the...

375
00:17:56,747 --> 00:18:00,252
I'd sent you an e-mail for a
leave request, like, two days ago...

376
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:01,464
about this.

377
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,733
You don't check your e-mail.

378
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:05,381
Never mind.

379
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:16,846
Very Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo, Boy
Who Cried Wolf And Who Must Now Suffer

380
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:19,298
Periodontal Disease For It.
How may I help you?

381
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:20,494
<i>I've got something.</i>

382
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:21,573
Get down here.

383
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:23,690
Okay. It's Abby.
She's got something.

384
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,287
Hi, Gibbs.

385
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,712
Abby, I think you might need
to lay off the caffeine again.

386
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:39,077
Maybe I need a little more,
McGee, you ever think of that?

387
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:40,292
Baby missing.

388
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,147
You said you had something.

389
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,366
I do.
That's what I'm so excited about.

390
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,034
Actually, everything's
really exciting to me today.

391
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:52,672
I was able to get the Nelsons'DNA
off the toothbrushes that McGee swabbed.

392
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:56,802
I compared the husband's DNA to the
fetal DNA from the missing child.

393
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:57,948
Adrian Nelson?

394
00:18:58,108 --> 00:18:59,265
Definitely the father.

395
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,769
There's no shocker there.

396
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:01,952
Well, I'm not done.

397
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,824
Heidi Campisano?

398
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:06,154
Definitely not the mother.

399
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:09,397
She gave birth to a
child who is not hers?

400
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:11,340
It's called gestational surrogacy,

401
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:13,721
where the sperm and the
egg come from third parties

402
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,741
and then the surrogate acts as a host.

403
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,940
- Abs, did you check...?
- Sara Nelson's DNA?

404
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:21,122
Sara Nelson is definitely the mother.

405
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,694
That's what the payments were for.

406
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:25,684
The Nelsons hired Heidi
Campisano as their surrogate.

407
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:28,117
Perhaps she changed her mind
about giving up the baby.

408
00:19:28,118 --> 00:19:29,259
That's not the question.

409
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:31,034
Did the Nelsons kill her for it?

410
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:48,684
Clear.

411
00:19:48,717 --> 00:19:49,527
Clear.

412
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,285
Clear.

413
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:53,086
Looks like they left in a hurry.

414
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:54,938
Place is a mess.

415
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:56,192
Not all of it.

416
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:20,270
I do not understand what
the Nelsons' plan was.

417
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,702
To have a baby.

418
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,191
That part I understand.

419
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:27,028
That is why they hired Heidi
Campisano as a surrogate.

420
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:29,848
But if she refused to
turn over the baby,

421
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:33,814
I'm sure the Nelsons would've had
other options besides killing her.

422
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,104
I mean, after all,
they were the biological parents.

423
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:37,201
I'm not a lawyer.

424
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:39,905
But you were a parent.

425
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:45,325
You want to have children, Ziva?

426
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:48,699
- Well...
- It's a simple question.

427
00:20:51,242 --> 00:20:53,114
I do not have a simple answer.

428
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:57,397
Once you have kids,
you'll understand.

429
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:02,104
If the Nelsons were really
willing to do anything

430
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:03,256
for their child,

431
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:05,158
they would be getting it
medical attention.

432
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:07,718
Yeah, well, maybe they are.
Safe was cleaned out.

433
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:10,263
Plus, I found the box to
an infant car seat in the garage.

434
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:13,243
- There going somewhere with the kid.
- You go for a swim, DiNozzo?

435
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:14,796
Oh, yeah.

436
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:17,823
Sprinklers went off when I was digging
through the trash outside.

437
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,241
Nice timing.

438
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,475
Actually,
it's part of their security system.

439
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:24,757
Forgot to warn you about that. Boss,
found something on their computer.

440
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:28,182
Thanks for the heads up, probie.
I owe you one.

441
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:35,748
I love you.

442
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,517
Now you need to figure out
if you feel the same way.

443
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:40,890
I don't want to hurt you.
I can't live a lie.

444
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:46,028
Tony, I...

445
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:54,738
Adrian Nelson is covering his tracks.

446
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:56,772
He erased his entire hard drive.

447
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,182
So we can't see
what he's been doing.

448
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:01,301
I thought you said
you found something.

449
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,659
Yeah, the root directory's
still intact.

450
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,368
There's no personal data, but I did find
an API he had written to interface

451
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:10,933
his home automation system to his
car's onboard navigation computer.

452
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:16,044
Pretend you're talking to someone who
actually has sex with other humans.

453
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,444
All I have to do is hack the API

454
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:20,682
and I can use it to get the
GPS coordinates on his car.

455
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:21,772
Yeah, do it, do it.

456
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:25,021
This is great. It means I can
stop calling Heidi's marks.

457
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:29,771
I mean, of course, I will look
for those other guys, but...

458
00:22:30,468 --> 00:22:32,397
Sorry.
Sorry.

459
00:22:36,715 --> 00:22:38,972
They haven't moved
in the last 20 minutes.

460
00:22:39,172 --> 00:22:40,523
Might have dumped the car.

461
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:43,423
Gibbs and the state police
will know soon enough.

462
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:46,480
What are you still typing?

463
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,101
I'm refreshing the tracker.

464
00:22:48,444 --> 00:22:51,184
Forget it I don't want to know.
It's good to have a geek on the team

465
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:53,352
but I prefer good old-fashioned
police work.

466
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:55,581
Well, it's not an
old-fashioned world, Tony.

467
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:56,794
Tell that to Gibbs.

468
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,085
What was it like?

469
00:23:10,846 --> 00:23:12,744
Sex?
Losing your virginity?

470
00:23:12,952 --> 00:23:13,952
It's good.

471
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:15,839
Pretending to be someone else.

472
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:18,199
I don't know, Elf Lord.

473
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:24,138
You were really in love with her,
weren't you?

474
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:31,345
Don't you have some more
typing to do or something?

475
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:32,422
Yeah, he does.

476
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:34,547
Car wasn't there.

477
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,291
What?
What...

478
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:38,686
I double-checked the...

479
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:41,404
All right, I think I know
what happened here.

480
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:45,202
20 bucks says McGee's about to say
something nobody understands again.

481
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:48,656
The GPS coordinates came
bundled in a proprietary packet.

482
00:23:48,657 --> 00:23:49,785
Since it was a beta...

483
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:52,431
I'm starting to think you
can't help yourself, McGee.

484
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:56,069
The code must have alerted
Adrian Nelson that I was tracking him.

485
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,122
He reprogrammed his car
to send us back false coordinates.

486
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:00,967
Can you deprogram it, McGee?

487
00:24:01,214 --> 00:24:02,214
I can try.

488
00:24:02,294 --> 00:24:04,234
Well, while he tries,
I'm going to resort

489
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:05,915
to some good old-fashioned
police work.

490
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:06,919
Look.

491
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,530
What's that?

492
00:24:15,426 --> 00:24:16,548
Who are you calling?

493
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,378
Donny.

494
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,963
- Hey. DiNozzo.
- <i>Hey, man.</i>

495
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:22,241
Yeah, man, what's going on?

496
00:24:22,242 --> 00:24:24,182
Listen, I got an update on a BOLO.
Missing kid.

497
00:24:24,224 --> 00:24:25,800
- <i>Give it to me.</i>
- Dead Head sticker.

498
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:27,074
<i>Excellent. Where?</i>

499
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:28,483
Left rear window.

500
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:30,322
<i>Nice.
Remember Saturday night</i>

501
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:32,328
I know, man...
That was good times.

502
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:34,547
I got another call, I really got to go.

503
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:35,844
Hang tough, Donny.

504
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:40,508
Old-fashion police work deserves
an old-fashion reward.

505
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:11,265
Interrogation got a little out of hand.
I had to...

506
00:25:13,754 --> 00:25:14,939
I can't explain that.

507
00:25:18,138 --> 00:25:18,938
Hello.

508
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:22,134
Again.

509
00:25:27,954 --> 00:25:30,211
You know, I saw this on...
Cinemax once.

510
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,551
So, what happens now?

511
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:33,779
They play some funky music,
and then you say

512
00:25:34,027 --> 00:25:36,122
"I have been watching you from afar."

513
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:38,407
Well, I've been watching you
from afar,

514
00:25:38,426 --> 00:25:40,741
which is why I know
how much you cared for Jeanne.

515
00:25:44,655 --> 00:25:46,295
Your timing is impeccable.

516
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,456
And how much it hurt when she left.

517
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,070
So,

518
00:25:51,562 --> 00:25:52,585
what happens now?

519
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,159
I said I'm fine.

520
00:26:04,454 --> 00:26:05,454
You are not fine.

521
00:26:06,451 --> 00:26:08,139
You are still deeply troubled.

522
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:09,584
Even if I was,

523
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:11,823
this bothers you because...?

524
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:13,362
Because you are my partner.

525
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,997
And because you made
a grave error in judgment

526
00:26:17,998 --> 00:26:19,367
falling in love with that girl.

527
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:21,548
If this is a pep talk,
I give you a D-minus.

528
00:26:21,683 --> 00:26:24,497
And right now, it is very clear
you are still hanging on to her.

529
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:25,775
I see the confusion.

530
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:27,852
These are called feelings, Ziva.

531
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:29,324
Feelings you need to let go.

532
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:31,348
That easy?

533
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:35,714
Even if by some miracle
Jeanne did forgive you,

534
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:38,049
would you be willing
to be Tony DiNardo full-time?

535
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:40,115
To leave your entire life
behind for her?

536
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:45,189
You did not think this through.

537
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:48,410
Didn't you tell me the heart wants
what it wants.

538
00:26:48,444 --> 00:26:49,244
No.

539
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:51,497
Actually, I didn't.

540
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:54,355
Well, it does.

541
00:26:56,609 --> 00:26:57,731
Well, it shouldn't.

542
00:26:58,426 --> 00:26:59,426
Really.

543
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,087
This coming from the woman

544
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:04,301
who fell in love
with the dead man walking.

545
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:14,463
You crossed the line, Tony.

546
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:16,392
I crossed the line?

547
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:20,479
Don't ask.

548
00:27:20,964 --> 00:27:21,968
Wasn't going to.

549
00:27:23,444 --> 00:27:24,597
BOLO just came in,

550
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:26,126
they found the car.

551
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:29,089
Jelly Donut, one.

552
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,672
Inspector Gadget, zero.

553
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:32,979
Not the BOLO on the Nelsons' car.

554
00:27:33,037 --> 00:27:34,946
The BOLO on the dead petty officer's.

555
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,644
Nothing here.
The truck's been wiped clean.

556
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:42,074
And someone's stolen
our petty officer's blood stain.

557
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:43,492
It was also cleaned.

558
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:46,347
Or we're wrong
about where Munoz was shot.

559
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:49,517
Witnesses.

560
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:51,025
No witnesses.

561
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,945
Local LEOs found the truck
abandoned near a forest preserve.

562
00:27:53,946 --> 00:27:55,334
It couldn't have been there long.

563
00:27:55,335 --> 00:27:56,457
How would you know that?

564
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,576
Wait. I forgot...

565
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:01,272
you know everything about everybody.

566
00:28:01,311 --> 00:28:03,569
Sap. Ziva there'd be
more sap on the roof.

567
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:06,212
Except for the fact
it rained last night.

568
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,428
Do I need to send you two
back to the men's room?

569
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:09,926
She followed me in there!

570
00:28:09,963 --> 00:28:11,699
Only because you wouldn't talk to me.

571
00:28:15,513 --> 00:28:16,620
Shutting up, boss.

572
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:18,227
Ready?

573
00:28:36,741 --> 00:28:40,081
So much for being wrong about
where Petty Officer Munoz was shot.

574
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:44,383
We got footprints.

575
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,996
Yeah, question is, whose?

576
00:28:46,062 --> 00:28:47,952
Petty Officer Munoz was a size 13.

577
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,422
Those look like a size 13 to you?

578
00:28:50,515 --> 00:28:51,715
Send them up to Abby.

579
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:54,882
The prints were made by a residue
of polysaccharide dust

580
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:56,189
derived from beta-glucose.

581
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,811
What makes it interesting is
the backbone of D-xylopyranose,

582
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:02,241
linked with eight xylose units.
Panda poop.

583
00:29:03,573 --> 00:29:04,759
- Panda...
- Poop.

584
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,078
Which is why it fluoresces,
like all other poop does.

585
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,077
What makes it really,
really, interesting...

586
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:11,465
is the sodium hypochlorite.

587
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:13,269
Aka Chlorine bleach.

588
00:29:16,284 --> 00:29:17,474
I lost you at poop?

589
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:19,674
Paper, Gibbs.

590
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,510
A while ago, a group
of Chinese researchers decided to try

591
00:29:23,568 --> 00:29:25,941
to recycle panda poop
into high-quality paper.

592
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:29,474
They contracted several U.S. paper mills
to develop the research.

593
00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:31,596
Killer must have gone to
one after he shot Munoz.

594
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:34,071
The dust from the mill would've been
impossible to avoid.

595
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:36,088
There's one within a hundred miles.

596
00:29:36,353 --> 00:29:37,646
Closed down six months ago.

597
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,482
I love my job!

598
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,467
You're telling me I'm the only who has

599
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:54,166
a problem with the panda poop paper?

600
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:56,803
Actually, animal dung's used
for a variety of things:

601
00:29:56,978 --> 00:29:58,579
paper, fuel, mud bricks.

602
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,842
It's very useful.

603
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,936
Not for them, it wasn't.

604
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,876
This place is abandoned.

605
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:06,789
Not quiet, Ziva.

606
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:18,843
Honey, let me get it.

607
00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:20,809
- DiNozzo.
- <i>In position, boss.</i>

608
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:22,689
Federal agents!

609
00:30:23,013 --> 00:30:24,904
NCIS! Hands in the air!

610
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:27,539
Agent Gibbs, please, you have to leave!

611
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,398
My God, you'll ruin everything!

612
00:30:33,404 --> 00:30:34,601
You've got to stop him.

613
00:30:34,693 --> 00:30:35,693
My baby!

614
00:30:36,313 --> 00:30:37,664
They've got my baby!

615
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,069
It's okay. Honey.

616
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:54,857
At least probie has an idea
for his next book.

617
00:30:54,973 --> 00:30:57,249
Baby kidnapped,
cops screw up ransom drop.

618
00:30:57,674 --> 00:30:59,805
Let me know asap
if the situation changes.

619
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,497
The Nelsons hid the kidnapping from us,

620
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:03,616
Agent DiNozzo, the mistake was theirs.

621
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,761
Well, you should point that out
to Gibbs, Officer David.

622
00:31:06,762 --> 00:31:07,916
I'll be in the next zip code.

623
00:31:08,918 --> 00:31:10,372
Agents are still out canvassing.

624
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:12,354
No one saw the Honda,
much less who was driving.

625
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:13,409
Keep looking. DiNozzo.

626
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,721
Taps on the Nelsons' phones,
I'm on it, boss, right now.

627
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:19,252
And I still have a...

628
00:31:19,696 --> 00:31:21,896
a few more of Heidi's marks
that I have to track down.

629
00:31:22,218 --> 00:31:23,742
That's next. That's right after...

630
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:24,819
I'm on it.

631
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:28,227
Coordinate with state police,
see if we can widen the search.

632
00:31:28,575 --> 00:31:29,906
<i>Hi, this is Special Agent...</i>

633
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:34,247
You think the kidnappers will call
to arrange another ransom?

634
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,790
What's the option, McGee?

635
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:38,557
I'll see about getting more agents
on the canvass.

636
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:40,763
We already have the entire department.

637
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,245
All I know is, we got a call
saying that Heidi was dead,

638
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:49,019
and that if we ever want
to see our baby,

639
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,231
we needed to come up with $50,000.

640
00:31:51,354 --> 00:31:53,630
Which we did, until you ruined it.

641
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:56,698
How much longer do we have
to sit here?

642
00:31:56,852 --> 00:31:58,723
- That depends.
- On what?

643
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:01,887
Whether or not
I get the truth this time.

644
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:03,847
Don't you have something
you could be doing?

645
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,089
Like...

646
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:06,829
finding my child?

647
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,832
My wife had a partial hysterectomy
four years ago.

648
00:32:14,345 --> 00:32:15,589
We tried to adopt and...

649
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,586
Went all the way to Southeast Asia
and back.

650
00:32:17,788 --> 00:32:19,035
And then we met Heidi.

651
00:32:19,786 --> 00:32:21,077
My exact opposite.

652
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:23,124
She had a womb but no eggs.

653
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:25,987
She was a life-saver,

654
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,072
- it was almost...
- Too good to be true?

655
00:32:29,229 --> 00:32:30,560
Then it usually is.

656
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:33,657
We already knew her background,
Agent Gibbs.

657
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:35,722
You still think she was trying
to con us?

658
00:32:35,723 --> 00:32:36,723
You paid her.

659
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:40,380
Paid surrogacy's illegal in Virginia.

660
00:32:40,478 --> 00:32:42,060
That why you didn't go to the police?

661
00:32:45,378 --> 00:32:47,828
Look, I got all day.
Your kid is missing.

662
00:32:48,156 --> 00:32:50,857
We didn't go to the police because
we knew they'd screw things up.

663
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:52,564
And you've still got it wrong.

664
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:54,204
Heidi was our friend.

665
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:55,728
We were happy to pay.

666
00:32:56,056 --> 00:32:57,291
And she needed the money.

667
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,985
Then she decided she wanted more.

668
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,737
This may have been her,
but not anymore.

669
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:03,307
She was trying to start over.

670
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:05,258
Someone wouldn't let her.
Who?!

671
00:33:05,355 --> 00:33:08,635
I have no idea!
I don't know who has my child!

672
00:33:10,853 --> 00:33:12,271
But as far as I'm concerned,

673
00:33:12,581 --> 00:33:14,568
if anything happens to my child,

674
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:16,497
you're the one
who better run for cover.

675
00:33:19,449 --> 00:33:21,282
No satellite coverage
of the paper mill.

676
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,694
Nothing on the traffic cams.

677
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:23,781
All right, send it over.

678
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,559
Careful over there.
Wouldn't want to break a finger.

679
00:33:34,434 --> 00:33:36,156
Gibbs does not accept apologies,

680
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,047
but I do.

681
00:33:46,806 --> 00:33:48,966
I'm sorry, Ziva.
I know you were trying to help.

682
00:33:49,718 --> 00:33:50,601
Did I?

683
00:33:53,743 --> 00:33:55,021
I'll get back to you

684
00:33:55,943 --> 00:33:57,389
after I shame McGee.

685
00:33:57,775 --> 00:33:58,935
Did you find something?

686
00:34:01,017 --> 00:34:03,574
I've been compiling a list
of Heidi's former marks.

687
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:04,629
We've noticed.

688
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:07,784
Any one of them could have
a score to settle.

689
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,972
The problem is they all have
solid alibis for the day

690
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:12,153
that Heidi was killed,
except this guy.

691
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:13,947
Scott Berks.

692
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:16,494
Filed a complaint over
a pyramid scheme Heidi was running.

693
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,806
Where does he say he was?

694
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:19,947
Well, he doesn't.

695
00:34:20,574 --> 00:34:21,721
I haven't found him yet.

696
00:34:21,722 --> 00:34:24,844
Does not exactly look like
a score settler to me.

697
00:34:25,318 --> 00:34:26,746
No. How about now?

698
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:29,852
A buddy at Baltimore PD just sent
this over.

699
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:32,495
Turns out this guy also filed
a complaint against Heidi.

700
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:35,193
- It is the same person.
- It's called a shill.

701
00:34:35,194 --> 00:34:37,314
They're part of the con,
but they pose as a customer

702
00:34:37,315 --> 00:34:39,592
to try to convince the other marks
to jump in.

703
00:34:39,862 --> 00:34:42,486
If the con goes bad,
they'll often file a complaint

704
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:44,415
so it builds credibility
with the other marks.

705
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,730
Then they can move in
for a secondary con.

706
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:50,144
I used to date this guy once...

707
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:52,749
He was Heidi's partner.

708
00:34:53,536 --> 00:34:54,790
Yeah, might still be.

709
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:57,414
High five for the traditional
police work.

710
00:34:58,127 --> 00:34:59,127
Tony, he's dead.

711
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:01,426
Killed a year ago by one of his marks.

712
00:35:01,696 --> 00:35:04,200
You might want to brush up
on the traditional police work.

713
00:35:05,664 --> 00:35:07,846
Do you know where my killer is?!

714
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,333
I don't know where the killer is,
but I know

715
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:12,294
what he was planning
on doing with Heidi's body.

716
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:18,898
Since the Chevy didn't leave any
skid marks at the site of the accident

717
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:20,673
the first thing I did was
check the brakes.

718
00:35:21,773 --> 00:35:22,868
The line were intact

719
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:24,933
and the fluids were topped off.

720
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:27,441
The pads were bad.
They needed to be replaced.

721
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:29,062
I know, but here's the thing.

722
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:30,736
This is so good,
I can hardly take it.

723
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:33,272
The brakes were replaced
about two weeks ago.

724
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,447
I found metallic shavings
in the brake drum and the caliper.

725
00:35:36,562 --> 00:35:38,549
It only could have come
from new pads and shoes.

726
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,996
Brakes were replaced and then
the old ones were put back on?

727
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:43,427
Yes, the accident
was not an accident.

728
00:35:43,736 --> 00:35:46,023
Well, actually, it was,
it just happened too soon.

729
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:47,690
It was the perfect cover-up.

730
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:50,942
The killer probably planned on putting
Heidi's body behind the wheel of the car

731
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:52,080
and sending it over a cliff.

732
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:55,346
- It'd have covered up the murder.
- It'd have been blamed on worn brakes.

733
00:35:55,481 --> 00:35:57,507
The only problem is
the killer cut it too close.

734
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:59,026
The brakes went out and ka-bam.

735
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:02,171
So who would rely
on the mechanical failure

736
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:06,069
of a break pad compressed
against a disc rotor to hide a body?

737
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:22,221
What did my loser son do now?

738
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:23,842
He killed Heidi Campisano.

739
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:27,025
Then tried to ransom her baby back
to the biological parents.

740
00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:29,532
My boy ain't that clever.

741
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:31,231
Guess that's why he needed your help.

742
00:36:33,134 --> 00:36:35,545
Look, I told you he was here
with me all day.

743
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:37,706
Yeah, and your customers
confirmed that.

744
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,921
But nobody we spoke to saw you.

745
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:42,235
A witness did see you in this Honda

746
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,177
near the Stern Paper Mill
this afternoon.

747
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:47,619
Seems you two are more
than just father-and-son mechanics.

748
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:48,991
Nice shotgun.

749
00:36:49,647 --> 00:36:51,653
Shoot any naval petty officers lately?

750
00:36:53,563 --> 00:36:54,563
Where's the baby?

751
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,482
I don't know what you're talking about.
I was at a paper mill.

752
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,165
What's that, some kind of a crime?

753
00:37:05,586 --> 00:37:06,386
Baby!

754
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:10,196
The baby's with Nicky.

755
00:37:10,216 --> 00:37:11,216
And Nicky?

756
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,916
I told him to wait here
for me to call,

757
00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:16,038
but my moron son never does
what he's told!

758
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,909
BOLO on it, boss.

759
00:37:18,315 --> 00:37:20,649
That girl of his was never going
to give up that baby.

760
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,308
I was doing those parents a favor!

761
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:25,041
You're under arrest for the murder
of Heidi Campisano.

762
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,211
Come on! That was an accident!

763
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,873
Petty Officer Munoz,
that an accident, too?

764
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,053
Because his murder is also
in our warrant.

765
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,125
- Look, when my brakes gave out...
- You mean

766
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:36,977
when you rigged them to go out.

767
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,879
You replaced Heidi's brakes
with a set that were about to fail,

768
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,674
and make it look like
she died in a crash.

769
00:37:45,761 --> 00:37:47,343
That little son of a bitch!

770
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,597
I'm going to kill him!

771
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:50,739
After all I've done
for that little bastard!

772
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,310
He didn't know the brakes were rigged?

773
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,203
No, he didn't.
Cancel that BOLO, DiNozzo.

774
00:37:59,214 --> 00:38:01,864
<i>London Bridge is falling down,</i>

775
00:38:02,316 --> 00:38:03,578
<i>falling down,</i>

776
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:05,910
<i>falling down,</i>

777
00:38:07,173 --> 00:38:09,666
<i>London Bridge is falling down,</i>

778
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,889
<i>my fair baby.</i>

779
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:21,658
You got my pa?

780
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:26,135
He killed Heidi,
made me lie to you about her.

781
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:27,826
I know.

782
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:32,325
She didn't cheat on me.

783
00:38:33,212 --> 00:38:34,490
She wasn't bad no more.

784
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:39,255
We were even going
to start a family together.

785
00:38:40,504 --> 00:38:42,756
Except Heidi couldn't have
no kids of her own.

786
00:38:45,996 --> 00:38:47,188
She was smart, though.

787
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:49,002
Figured out a way to get one.

788
00:38:50,024 --> 00:38:51,317
Guess that part was bad.

789
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:53,574
Wish I could tell you it wasn't.

790
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,403
I would have raised my own boy right.

791
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,180
When the baby was born,

792
00:39:04,432 --> 00:39:06,130
we were planning to run away,

793
00:39:07,771 --> 00:39:10,928
but my pa wanted the rest
of the money we were going to get.

794
00:39:12,822 --> 00:39:14,191
Heidi and him fought,

795
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:16,680
then she had the baby...

796
00:39:23,283 --> 00:39:27,103
My pa took it, she was screaming.

797
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,292
And you didn't do a thing.

798
00:39:32,507 --> 00:39:33,437
I did.

799
00:39:34,842 --> 00:39:36,545
It was just too late to matter.

800
00:39:37,176 --> 00:39:38,179
The brakes.

801
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:42,036
Am I in trouble?

802
00:39:42,537 --> 00:39:44,585
Prosecution's going to call it
"attempted murder".

803
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:46,473
Your lawyer's going to call it
"self-defense".

804
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:48,577
What do you call it?

805
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:51,719
Family.

806
00:39:59,616 --> 00:40:00,816
Is everything okay?

807
00:40:01,062 --> 00:40:02,374
It's the sprinkler again.

808
00:40:02,593 --> 00:40:03,917
Parents are waiting outside.

809
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:29,637
You think I'm crazy?

810
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:39,438
Here's your baby.

811
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,620
Oh, my God!

812
00:40:45,438 --> 00:40:46,438
Thank you.

813
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:48,799
Thank you.

814
00:40:52,773 --> 00:40:53,773
It's a boy.

815
00:41:10,366 --> 00:41:11,459
Here you go, Tony.

816
00:41:28,592 --> 00:41:29,592
<i>Look at him.</i>

817
00:41:50,656 --> 00:41:53,945
<i>Tony, I'm not coming back.
You need to choose, Jeanne.</i>
