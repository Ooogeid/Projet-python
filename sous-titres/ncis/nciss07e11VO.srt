2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:06,491
Really something, isn't it?

3
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:08,023
It's absolutely...

4
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,225
horrible.

5
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:12,305
It's not, though.
Fire's a miracle.

6
00:00:13,244 --> 00:00:14,597
Naturally clears the forest,

7
00:00:15,387 --> 00:00:17,141
recycles nutrients into the soil

8
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:19,176
and stimulates new plant growth.

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,853
That is a load of hippie,
tree-hugging nonsense.

10
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:24,955
How'd you become a forest Ranger
if you don't love the outdoors?

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,686
Because I hate the indoors.

12
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:30,989
I got nothing against nature.
But it can be argued that

13
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,892
it was a good thing a meteor hit Earth
and wiped out all the dinosaurs,

14
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:36,049
so they weren't here to eat us
when we came along.

15
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:38,454
But I think we'd all agree
it'd be a bad thing,

16
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:41,145
however natural,
if a meteor were to hit us now.

17
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,283
Jake?

18
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:44,794
What the hell?

19
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:48,079
Oh, my God! He's all burned up.

20
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:49,924
He must have gotten caught
in the blaze.

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,426
What was he doing up here?

22
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,014
Don't touch him!

23
00:00:57,361 --> 00:01:00,393
He's only burned on one side.
How could that possibly happen?

24
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:03,521
Miracle of fire?

25
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:09,485

29
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:38,890
There is nothing good
on the Internet.

30
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,707
I think that Internet thing
has just about run its course.

31
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:43,852
Pop-up ads, banner ads, video ads...

32
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,730
I think
this whole page may be an ad.

33
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:47,134
Ad for what?

34
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,274
Hair loss pills?

35
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:52,070
This is a pill that makes
people lose their hair?

36
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,739
- It's for growing hair.
- Why would I need more hair?

37
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:56,783
Not you. Men.

38
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,242
Like I need more men?

39
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:02,422
Men need more hair.
Women need less.

40
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:05,232
Must be an industry
if you put those together.

41
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:07,585
Take the hair from the women.
Put it on the men.

42
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:10,552
This is a prescription eyelash wand.

43
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,925
I think your morning Internet
routine needs a little bit of tweaking.

44
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,345
That's that thing. That thing
where people tell complete strangers

45
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:20,210
whether they started
their day putting on both socks

46
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,601
and then both shoes
or one sock and one shoe or

47
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,186
the other sock or the other shoe.

48
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,771
Tweaking, not tweeting.

49
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:29,930
- Tweeting.
- There's one on there

50
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:32,169
that's really good.
Guy's talking his roommate's

51
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:34,111
doing and the roommate
doesn't know about it.

52
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:36,322
It's highly entertaining.
I'll send you the link.

53
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,228
I got a link for you.

54
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:40,034
No more links.

55
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,737
I've spent my entire morning
sifting through all of this nonsense,

56
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:44,328
looking for something that matters.

57
00:02:44,412 --> 00:02:46,958
How hard is it for someone to tell me
the news and bring it to me?

58
00:02:47,142 --> 00:02:48,584
There must be a better way.

59
00:02:57,656 --> 00:02:58,386
What?

60
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,264
I got an article here
that you may want to read.

61
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,393
I can send the link to your email
or text the link to your phone.

62
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:10,148
Or I can just print it out on paper
and give it to you in your hand.

63
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:12,275
It's a revolutionary concept, McGee.

64
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:15,111
- Where're we going, boss?
- West Virginia. The Appalachians.

65
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,864
Got a dead Navy pilot.
Pack your hiking boots.

66
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,408
Breathtaking.

67
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:24,492
Yeah, it was for Lieutenant Commander
Brad "Hondo" Sayers, U.S. Navy.

68
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:27,415
Granted extended leave
from Pax a week ago.

69
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,050
- Fighter jock.
- He's a test pilot.

70
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:33,045
Can't believe
I'm getting a signal out here.

71
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,062
Rangers flipped him over
to identify him.

72
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,508
Who's going to identify them
when Ducky gets through with them?

73
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:39,644
You're not supposed
to touch the body.

74
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:43,306
What do you think, McGee?
This guy eject out of a plane or what?

75
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:45,725
Carbon fiber helmet's designed
for skydiving,

76
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,351
but the suit is flame-retardant.

77
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,751
It only did half the job.

78
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:52,565
Other half of him's crispy.
McDLT.

79
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:55,401
- I don't get that one.
- That's not a McNickname.

80
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:57,823
The McDonald's McDLT.

81
00:03:58,323 --> 00:04:01,032
- Hot side hot. Cold side cold.
- That's very tasteful.

82
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:03,671
Forest Rangers say
this area has been off-limits

83
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:06,495
to hikers since it burned a month ago.
Winter fire season.

84
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:09,599
- Now, forest fire didn't kill him.
- Some fire did.

85
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,376
A high-temperature explosion
blew his arm right off.

86
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:15,296
Animals could have pulled that off.

87
00:04:26,623 --> 00:04:29,334
You are awfully close to that body,
Timothy.

88
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:31,479
I'm just trying to get
a look at what's on his back.

89
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:33,647
Look with your eyes, McGee,

90
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:35,168
not your hands.

91
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,818
You have a long ride
coming up here, Palmer?

92
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,571
He wouldn't let me drive.
I begged and begged.

93
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:43,480
What is it that makes you
so anxious?

94
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:44,533
Flight suit.

95
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,410
Helmet.
Dead man's a pilot.

96
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,508
And this doesn't look like
a parachute on his back.

97
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:51,264
You think he fell from the sky?
Without a parachute.

98
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:54,317
Well, there should be a lot
more metal pieces around here.

99
00:04:54,623 --> 00:04:55,670
Okay. Look around.

100
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:04,053
- Got an arm over here.
- The flesh kind or the metal kind?

101
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,241
Metal.

102
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:09,361
Got a nozzle.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,188
I got another body.

104
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,483
Don't move it.
Here I come.

105
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:26,925
Bag it up, Palmer.

106
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,081
Mother lode.

107
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:39,693
- Fuel tank?
- Yes, that is a fuel tank.

108
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,006
Interesting reading, Jethro?

109
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,745
McGee seems to have
an instinct for this one.

110
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,642
Perhaps baby bird is ready
to leave the nest.

111
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:55,849
Well, Boss, we're a few fingers
short of a hand,

112
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:59,056
- but we got some good stuff here.
- Guy pulled a scarecrow.

113
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:01,736
Pieces of him everywhere.
Here you go, Ducky.

114
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:04,962
Hey, look at you, Palmer.
You bagged yourself a flying monkey.

115
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:06,496
It's a squirrel.

116
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,630
Fuel tank.
Control arm. Joystick.

117
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:13,831
So, McGee, do you know what killed
Lieutenant Commander Sayers?

118
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:16,617
- Yeah, I think I do.
- You think?

119
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,419
Or you know?

120
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:21,933
I know one thing.

121
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:23,866
His jet pack exploded.

122
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:27,815
Jet packs.

123
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:31,348
Yeah.
It's gonna be a weird one.

124
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,297
Lieutenant Commander Brad Sayers.

125
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:48,324
Naval Academy grad,
primary aviation training at Pensacola.

126
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:51,464
Advanced at Lemoore,
Top Gun at Fallon.

127
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:52,912
Unmarried, no kids.

128
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,619
Call sign "Hondo"<i> à la John Wayne</i>.

129
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:57,932
I thought he was "The Duke".

130
00:06:58,258 --> 00:06:59,036
He is.

131
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,134
He was. Always will be.

132
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:03,570
Sayers was part of a squadron
of test pilots

133
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:05,628
at Patuxent River Air Base.

134
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:09,011
- The first to fly experimental planes.
- Military experiments with jet packs?

135
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:13,949
I wouldn't... well, yeah.
They did, but...

136
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,564
After years

137
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,672
of testing various designs,
ultimately they decided helicopters

138
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:26,278
were more practical
for earth-atmosphere flight.

139
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,531
Although NASA's
compressed gas-powered

140
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,354
Manned Maneuvering Unit evolved from
Bell Systems' rocket belt technology.

141
00:07:32,544 --> 00:07:35,493
"Rocket belt"
being the original terminology

142
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:37,790
rather than the more colloquial
"jet pack".

143
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:40,073
McGee's very passionate
about the subject.

144
00:07:40,157 --> 00:07:42,586
We spend a lot of time here,
just the three of us.

145
00:07:42,902 --> 00:07:45,323
I was telling him about the bonus
features on the <i>Thunderball</i> DVD,

146
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,492
which were pretty interesting,
and he says,

147
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:50,344
"Tony,
bonus features aren't science,"

148
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,257
and so he...

149
00:07:52,762 --> 00:07:54,722
- He schooled you.
- Yep.

150
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:57,420
- Where is he now?
- He's down with Abby.

151
00:07:57,504 --> 00:07:59,645
We cannot tear him away
from the evidence.

152
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:03,750
Well, I'll see you both there
when you get back from Pax River.

153
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,154
The August 1928 issue
of Amazing Stories

154
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,422
first stirred
the national imagination.

155
00:08:10,717 --> 00:08:12,771
It featured the "Skylark of Space"
on the cover.

156
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:15,824
- And then you got Buck Rogers.
- What's really amazing...

157
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:18,971
is how much more fascinating
jet pack trivia gets

158
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:20,798
the 11th time you've heard it.

159
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:23,913
Did you know that the original
rocket belt was propelled

160
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:26,577
by a chemical reaction
and not traditional jet fuel?

161
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:28,340
I know!

162
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:33,012
You showed me your PowerPoint
presentation, like, five years ago.

163
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:34,465
But I've updated it.

164
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:37,682
To include recent breakthroughs
in single-man flight.

165
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,228
Good.

166
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:45,250
Yeah, the Swiss pilot and engineer
Yves Rossy and his four-engine glider.

167
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,902
And the Kiwis. Everyone thinks
that they are going to be the ones

168
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:51,030
to crack the commercially viable
prototype with the Martin.

169
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,150
What do you got?

170
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:00,206
It's residue from the flame suit.

171
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:03,250
- Hydrogen peroxide...
- That makes sense.

172
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,169
And kerosene.

173
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:07,532
Kerosene?

174
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:11,239
Strange to use
those two in combination.

175
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:14,428
Doesn't sound like any prototype
I've studied. Maybe they got...

176
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:17,737
What do you got now?

177
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:21,722
That's the elevator.

178
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:30,833
I thought you'd want to see that.

179
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:33,876
I can't believe the Mexican authorities
dropped the charges

180
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,585
against Colonel Bell.

181
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,759
Colonel Bell. Wonder if there's
relationship to Bell Labs.

182
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:39,889
Bell Labs...

183
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:43,875
inventors of the rocket belt.
Rocket belt's an amazing model.

184
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,491
It's a catalyst that decomposes

185
00:09:46,575 --> 00:09:48,943
hydrogen peroxide
into pressurized steam and oxygen.

186
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:52,216
You get significant thrust from
lightweight rockets for about 30 sec...

187
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:55,803
I got it, McGee.
You know a lot about jet packs.

188
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:59,096
Boss, when I was a kid,
stationed in Alameda,

189
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:01,630
my parents took me
to the opening ceremonies

190
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:04,085
- of the '84 Olympics in Los Angeles.
- Right.

191
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,837
- And the guy flew over the crowd.
- Bill Suitor.

192
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Flew right over my head, I swear.

193
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:11,691
All right.

194
00:10:12,469 --> 00:10:13,737
I believe you.

195
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:16,064
You got the lead on this one.

196
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,211
I knew it. I mean, Hondo'd never go
a week without getting up in the air.

197
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:31,463
Off base, against Navy regulations.

198
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:34,800
Your men are subject to the same
restrictions as the average pilot?

199
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:39,054
I don't know exactly
what an average pilot is, Agent David.

200
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:41,015
None of them are naval aviators.

201
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:43,655
These boys...
they operate under extreme stress.

202
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:46,306
Some of them find relief
in taking jobs outside the squadron.

203
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,354
We allow that.

204
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:49,898
As long as it doesn't interfere
with combat readiness.

205
00:10:50,354 --> 00:10:53,697
Hondo... man, he was a rare breed.
He'd drink six or seven cups a coffee,

206
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:55,904
and he'd strap himself
to anything that goes fast.

207
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,156
Who was he closest to?

208
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,826
Commander Peter Sheridan.
Hey, Banshee!

209
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:01,732
Sir.

210
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:03,426
I'll catch up with you.

211
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:04,997
Yes, sir?

212
00:11:07,152 --> 00:11:08,917
Banshee, we got some bad news.

213
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:10,336
Hondo?

214
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:12,338
Yes, sorry, Commander.

215
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:14,673
He died in some sort
of explosion or crash.

216
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:20,137
- What did he crash?
- You assume he was at the stick?

217
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:23,015
Hondo never takes
a backseat to anyone.

218
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,600
Control freak.

219
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:27,169
I think it'd be more accurate
to say he was careful.

220
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,301
He's got to be.

221
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,580
With these machines
and their power and speed,

222
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:32,874
slight movements have
major consequences.

223
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:36,445
We try not to think about it too hard,
but it happens. So, what did he crash?

224
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:38,572
Believe it was some sort
of jet pack.

225
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:43,293
Crap.

226
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,581
Victor Tillman. That's who you want
to talk to. Came to me first.

227
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:49,250
Aerospace engineer.

228
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,043
Company's called Tillman Air.

229
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:53,093
Banshee went up
the ladder for a waiver,

230
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:55,255
Navy rejected it.
Didn't want to support his research.

231
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:57,706
Tillman must've gone to Hondo next

232
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,717
and convinced him
it was worth ignoring regulations

233
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:02,922
in order to have the chance
to fly something like that.

234
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,308
Thank you.

235
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,439
Was there anything left of him?

236
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:17,469
If you're sure I'm ready, Doctor.

237
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,406
Mr. Palmer,
the time has come for you to fly solo.

238
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:23,645
The body is all yours.

239
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:28,069
Dr. Mallard,

240
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:31,417
I am suddenly overcome
with the desire to share a story

241
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,210
of only a peripherally
relevant nature.

242
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:36,953
- It's a hazard of the profession.
- So, you'd advise I refrain

243
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:39,158
under the "gotta learn to walk
before you run" column?

244
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:41,510
Not at all.
As long as it doesn't impede your focus.

245
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:43,979
Think of it as spreading your wings.

246
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:47,325
Though, bear in mind,
the fate of young Icarus,

247
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:51,409
who disregarded the warnings of
his father, Daedalus, and flew too high.

248
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:54,189
And the wax that held his feathers
on was melted by the sun.

249
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:57,753
- And he fell to his death.
- Fall was the cause of death?

250
00:12:57,837 --> 00:12:59,695
Jethro, for once, you have failed

251
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,697
to pick up the threads
of our conversation.

252
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:05,096
I was not speaking of our...
dear departed...

253
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:07,119
Lieutenant Commander Sayers.

254
00:13:08,191 --> 00:13:09,580
Fall wasn't the cause of death?

255
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,708
- Yet to be determined.
- What were you guys just talking about?

256
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:15,966
Mr. Palmer was about
to regale me with a tale

257
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,882
that is only tangentially connected
to his first solo autopsy.

258
00:13:21,423 --> 00:13:22,623
Of a squirrel.

259
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:28,618
Work through your fear, Mr. Palmer.

260
00:13:31,222 --> 00:13:34,625
This reminds me
of my junior year abroad.

261
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:37,162
I was staying with a family
outside of Lyon

262
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:40,274
who spoke only French,
and my French was...

263
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:41,695
okay at best.

264
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:44,156
And whatever you might think
of the people of France,

265
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,986
these squirrels are
extraordinarily friendly.

266
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,258
So, I had to explain to them
my fear of squirrels.

267
00:13:49,342 --> 00:13:52,331
You see, in D.C. there are brown
squirrels and there are black squirrels

268
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,474
and at the time,
black squirrels carried rabies.

269
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:58,566
So, my mother used to bait traps
with peanut butter,

270
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:01,466
capture the squirrels and release them
on the other side of the river,

271
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,175
so they wouldn't bite
any of the kids.

272
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,806
But... I... confused the words...

273
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:13,779
<i>écureuil</i>, which means squirrel,
with the much less accurate...

274
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:16,522
<i>requin</i> which means... shark.

275
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:20,359
How they must have pictured your strange
homeland with your shark-hunting mother.

276
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:27,591
What's the point of the squirrel?

277
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:31,583
We believe his cause
of death may be related to Sayers.

278
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:33,770
In desperate situations

279
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,668
when the food supplies are scarce,

280
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:38,919
squirrels will eat almost anything,
including human flesh.

281
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,157
Fire eliminated
all the other options.

282
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:43,215
And we have to inventory
"Rocket J's" stomach

283
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,413
to confirm its contents,

284
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,959
but initial dental impressions...

285
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:50,788
suggest that his last meal...

286
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:52,808
was Sayers' soft tissues.

287
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:54,560
Yes, hypovolemic shock.

288
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:57,001
Massive internal bleeding.

289
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:59,295
This squirrel was likely poisoned.

290
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:00,858
Secondary poisoning.

291
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:03,944
This squirrel died
from eating Sayers' toxic organs.

292
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:05,946
Sayers was poisoned?

293
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,908
Then we can't yet say if it contributed
to his fall to Earth, but...

294
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:11,941
Somebody was trying to kill him.

295
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,839
<i>Since the dawn of time,
man has dreamed of flight.</i>

296
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:26,926
<i>Is it gravity or nature,</i>

297
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,046
<i>or merely the limitations
of our imagination</i>

298
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,509
<i>that has kept us grounded?</i>

299
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:33,140
<i>This is a public
demonstration in 1961.</i>

300
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:37,460
<i>Functional technology
nearly half a century ago.</i>

301
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:40,504
<i>Measure that against progress
in other arenas.</i>

302
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:44,735
<i>Internal combustion engine,
radio, television, the Internet.</i>

303
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:48,572
<i>In 50 years, they go from impossible
to practical, to ubiquitous.</i>

304
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:50,497
<i>Meanwhile, they....</i>

305
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:53,774
<i>keep the jet pack relegated
to the world of science fiction</i>

306
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:55,700
They?

307
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,958
The jet pack conspiracy?

308
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,242
Boss, if you look at it, it's really
the only logical explanation.

309
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:06,131
<i>The primary obstacles
to a commercially viable model</i>

310
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:09,384
<i>are weight, flight time,
distance and simple controls.</i>

311
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,506
Did we miss the part
about the motorcycle parking spaces?

312
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,891
<i>Imagine a jet pack landing
and refueling area at your office.</i>

313
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:18,369
Apparently not.

314
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:21,110
<i>The average daily commute
is 16 miles one-way,</i>

315
00:16:21,194 --> 00:16:23,208
<i>but the variance
in travel time is huge,</i>

316
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,734
<i>because of roadway congestion.</i>

317
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:27,957
- Slow drivers.
- Bad drivers.

318
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:29,976
What is so hard?
Fast as possible.

319
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,874
When something gets in your way,
you turn.

320
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,159
You're quoting <i>Better Off Dead</i>.
I told you to watch that.

321
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,457
<i>Thirty-mile radius.</i>

322
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,539
<i>Simple enough that you don't need
to be a helicopter pilot to fly it.</i>

323
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:42,709
<i>Patent that,
and we are all living like</i> the Jetsons.

324
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,505
Or dying like burnt-out
bottle rockets.

325
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:50,578
There is
a thin margin for error, yes.

326
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:54,429
Sayers had rat poison in his system.
Abby confirmed it.

327
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,206
He was impaired while he was flying.
In Commander Cody's brave new world,

328
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,616
we're gonna be pulling people
out of the sky for Fuis.

329
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,685
F.U.Is.

330
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:03,018
So, the crash did not kill him?

331
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,440
Well, it didn't help.
What'd you guys find?

332
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:09,194
Uh, Sayers was test flying
on the side for a Victor Tillman.

333
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:12,728
Tillman Air. Put out a press release
a couple months ago,

334
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:14,700
saying they're getting close
to an unveiling.

335
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:18,159
Sayers' death in one of those jet packs
would not be good for business.

336
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:19,774
Smacks of a cover-up.

337
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:24,803
All right,

338
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:27,862
gonna need to get
a look at Tillman's financials.

339
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,757
I'm gonna stay here,
you two go out and talk to him.

340
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:34,094
So, McGee is not coming?
To the jet pack factory?

341
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,515
Well, you get your homework done,

342
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,851
and then you can go out and play
with the neighbor kids.

343
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:43,395
Good boy.

344
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:49,015
The price of being in charge.

345
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:54,855
It's gotta be a punishment.

346
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:57,200
Some kind of motivational technique.

347
00:17:58,107 --> 00:18:00,537
McGee staying behind?
I don't get it.

348
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,875
It's like the carrot. You know,
the carrot in front of the horse?

349
00:18:08,528 --> 00:18:10,630
Israeli drivers Ed
must really be something.

350
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,840
He's still there.

351
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,215
Who is?

352
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:14,426
I got a tail.

353
00:18:18,352 --> 00:18:20,515
I can't believe he bit it.
But I can.

354
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,017
You know? It's like those guys

355
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,352
who raise bears and then you find out
they get eaten by one

356
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,013
and you say, "Oh, yes, of course".
But Hondo...

357
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,535
Fireball is exactly
how he would've wanted it.

358
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:30,826
Oh, man...

359
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:33,904
you know,
it just doesn't make any sense.

360
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,531
- Why's that?
- You said you found a pack.

361
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:38,742
Where did he get the pack?

362
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,369
That's why we're here, Vic.

363
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:43,914
Right, right.

364
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,500
- We're going this way.
- She's fine.

365
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,148
This is a secure area.

366
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:55,528
The card's in my pocket.

367
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:58,946
I'm not touching you.

368
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:02,576
I got it.

369
00:19:06,352 --> 00:19:07,229
After you.

370
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:09,411
Thank you.

371
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:21,336
Smile!

372
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:27,560
Safety...

373
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:29,573
is my primary concern.

374
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:33,155
I try to stay away
from the more combustible fuel sources.

375
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:36,176
Makes it a challenge to manufacture
sufficient vertical thrust

376
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,587
while keeping it compact.

377
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:39,160
Yeah, how's that coming?

378
00:19:40,243 --> 00:19:42,968
We've maintained level flight
at an altitude of seven to ten meters

379
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:44,294
for up to nine minutes.

380
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,870
As you can see,

381
00:19:47,214 --> 00:19:50,537
controls are extremely sophisticated.
These are my babies.

382
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,883
Bravo, Juliet...

383
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:55,036
and Oscar.

384
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,051
My bologna has a first name.
Sounds like you're missing some letters.

385
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:03,785
Not every model makes it
to the final testing phase.

386
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,018
Some of them never even
get off the ground.

387
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,709
Seeing a few similarities
to our model here, Vic.

388
00:20:13,668 --> 00:20:15,881
Each piece is extensively logged,

389
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,212
branded, patented
and kept under lock and key.

390
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:20,677
Believe me,
no one is taking anything from me.

391
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:22,554
- Again.
- Excuse me?

392
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:25,822
Sounded like you cut yourself off
before you could say "again".

393
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:27,934
Who stole from you, Vic?

394
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:33,982
This is your area
of expertise, McGee.

395
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,769
<i>I'm down here trying to put together
a jet pack jigsaw puzzle,</i>

396
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:38,423
<i>I don't know what it's look like.</i>

397
00:20:38,507 --> 00:20:41,455
You know that's what I'd rather be doing
but I gotta go right now.

398
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:48,076
What, McGee,
Tillman's financials not thrilling you?

399
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,811
Not at all, Boss.

400
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:52,810
As an individual,
the guy's got $47 to his name,

401
00:20:53,075 --> 00:20:55,837
but he has corporations
inside of corporations,

402
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,090
hiding cash since his divorce
from Vanessa Tillman.

403
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:02,133
That the ex-wife?

404
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:04,638
And former chief financial officer.

405
00:21:04,993 --> 00:21:07,891
They split, he fires her,
turns into a messy fight over

406
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,251
everything from the house
to the company's proprietary technology.

407
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:12,380
Where's his money?

408
00:21:12,464 --> 00:21:14,635
I cross-referenced payments
from his corporate account

409
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,441
against the time Sayers
wasn't at Pax.

410
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:19,310
Tillman was paying Sayers
five figures a pop.

411
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:20,862
He was up to his elbows in it.

412
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,131
He wasn't the only one.

413
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:25,221
Sayers wasn't just collecting checks
from Uncle Sam and Victor Tillman.

414
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:27,927
For some reason, Vanessa Tillman
had him on the payroll as well.

415
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:32,460
Come on!

416
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,579
I don't know
what you think happened here.

417
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,079
Talk to him.

418
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,672
We think your test pilot is dead,

419
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:44,841
and we think
that you had motive to kill him.

420
00:21:46,926 --> 00:21:48,979
I liked Sayers. He was a great guy.

421
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:50,930
What motive
would I have had to kill him?

422
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:52,269
It wasn't even my pack.

423
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,601
He was being paid by your ex-wife.

424
00:21:56,075 --> 00:21:57,941
That son of a bitch!

425
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,753
So, you didn't know?

426
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:02,273
No, I didn't know.

427
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:04,698
Of course I didn't know.
If I had known, I would have...

428
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:10,219
I would have fired him.

429
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:11,997
She was my top competitor.

430
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:13,252
Locally.

431
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:16,001
- The Kiwis got a big jump on me.
- And the Swiss.

432
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:18,128
Oh, come on. A collapsible wing?

433
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,592
It's great for distance...

434
00:22:19,676 --> 00:22:22,716
But without hover capability,
it'll always be for professionals.

435
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,683
This is a patent
for a mixed-fuel propulsion system.

436
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,019
It's a hybrid of H²O² and kerosene.

437
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,944
Lab tests show that mixture
was found on Sayers' body.

438
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:39,607
Has your name on it.

439
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:41,530
Is it yours?

440
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:42,800
Yes.

441
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:47,117
No.

442
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,826
Can't have it both ways.

443
00:22:52,697 --> 00:22:54,539
Vanessa got it in the divorce.

444
00:22:59,314 --> 00:23:00,356
Nice candid.

445
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:02,711
- You got a plate?
- Of course.

446
00:23:04,456 --> 00:23:05,860
Lanny Carothers.

447
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,780
Maryland P.I. license.

448
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:10,722
Somebody hired
a investigator to follow us.

449
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:12,647
Maybe it is not us. Maybe it's you.

450
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,100
Maybe it is you.

451
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,101
Hello.

452
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,405
I believe you're holding my client.

453
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:21,900
I'd be happy to hold...
anything you need.

454
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,102
Charming, Mr. DiNozzo.

455
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:26,988
Please take me
to see Victor Tillman.

456
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:31,242
M. Allison Hart,
attorney for Victor Tillman.

457
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,746
This looks cozy.

458
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:36,917
Have you read my client his rights?

459
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,627
He hasn't been charged with a crime.

460
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:43,939
Then release him.

461
00:23:45,527 --> 00:23:48,009
Charge him or release him.
What's the confusion?

462
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,429
Were you planning to interrogate him

463
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,224
without an attorney present until

464
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,969
he incriminated himself in some way

465
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:58,686
<i>that you find beneficial
for your investigation?</i>

466
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,356
Man, what a car wreck.

467
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,442
- He didn't ask for a lawyer.
- <i>And you didn't offer.</i>

468
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:07,016
Chick's mowing McGee down,
he doesn't even know it.

469
00:24:07,675 --> 00:24:09,030
She seems to be enjoying it.

470
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:13,701
You've already violated
my client's right to his privacy.

471
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:17,622
His financial records were accessed
today without proper authorization.

472
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:20,838
And I have reason to believe
that you were the source.

473
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:23,974
Maybe you're the one
who should be charged with a crime.

474
00:24:35,402 --> 00:24:36,433
Let's go, Tillman.

475
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:46,361
Miss Hart...

476
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:49,298
your client...

477
00:24:49,764 --> 00:24:51,072
hiding behind a lawyer...

478
00:24:51,995 --> 00:24:53,241
it makes me wonder why.

479
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:57,003
I can see your mind is spinning,
Mr. Gibbs,

480
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:01,388
but once the hamster gains
some traction on the wheel,

481
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:03,974
and you figure out the questions
you want to ask,

482
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:06,986
you feel free
to contact me directly.

483
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:08,563
Not my client.

484
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:10,587
Were you ever a redhead?

485
00:25:11,057 --> 00:25:12,594
'Cause it feels like I know you.

486
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:13,651
No.

487
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:16,171
But I know you.

488
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:20,011
I know you take
any shortcut to a conviction.

489
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:22,061
Really? Doesn't sound like me.

490
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:25,425
You look the other way when your team
hacks privileged information,

491
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:28,443
when they break into a police
impound lot and steal evidence,

492
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,959
when they start a bar fight.

493
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:33,850
Just out of curiosity...

494
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:39,329
... do you have any respect at all
for the law?

495
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:49,009
You and your client are free to go,
Miss... Hart.

496
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:51,841
I know.

497
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:08,026
What kind of name is Mallison?

498
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:09,875
It's M. Allison Hart.

499
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,823
I think they're missing
some punctuation.

500
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:14,527
So, a guy dies
in a jet pack explosion,

501
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:17,641
and she won't let us talk to the guy
that manufactures jet packs?

502
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:19,675
That's just mean.

503
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,751
We don't know that he died
in the explosion.

504
00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:23,451
He was poisoned. I found that.

505
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:25,923
But you didn't determine
whether he was poisoned to death

506
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:27,679
or just to some level of discomfort.

507
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,880
Well, the thing about poison
is that the human body doesn't want it,

508
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:33,879
so when it's ingested,
it does its best to expel it.

509
00:26:34,181 --> 00:26:36,592
See, there was a high level of warfarin
in Sayers' system,

510
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,516
but his organs are so destroyed, it's
impossible to tell the cause of death.

511
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,768
You don't see the flaw
in this logic, Palmer?

512
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:46,601
You mean the part about
how he strapped himself to a jet pack

513
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:49,357
and flew around and blew up and done
all of that while already being dead?

514
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:52,026
Yeah, I don't know.

515
00:26:52,535 --> 00:26:53,877
It's a neat trick, though.

516
00:26:56,274 --> 00:26:57,227
"Ooh", what?

517
00:26:58,803 --> 00:26:59,755
"Ooh", this.

518
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:01,661
We know the fuel source.

519
00:27:02,223 --> 00:27:04,726
Combination of hydrogen
peroxide and kerosene.

520
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,458
Definitely combustible,
but what was the source of ignition?

521
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,043
What causes a catalytic reaction?

522
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,714
You mix them together the wrong way.

523
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:13,829
Bingo.

524
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:16,169
Redirect the flow of kerosene

525
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,136
from the exit port of the motor.

526
00:27:18,494 --> 00:27:20,751
Back into the H²O² tank, and...

527
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:21,662
Kaboom.

528
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,922
All you'd need is a movable valve,

529
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,357
and this rocket belt
would self-destruct.

530
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:30,214
So, how does this valve
get reversed?

531
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:34,820
- This isn't a valve, Palmer.
- Right.

532
00:27:35,748 --> 00:27:39,501
It's our smoking gun,
and whoever made it is our killer.

533
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:42,726
I'm just getting settled in.

534
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,122
Victor dragged his feet as long
as possible through the divorce.

535
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:47,915
You split everything equally?

536
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,117
We split.

537
00:27:49,506 --> 00:27:51,114
There was nothing equal about it.

538
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,640
We shared a home,
an office, ambition...

539
00:27:56,714 --> 00:27:59,346
Whenever two people try to extricate
their lives from each other,

540
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,678
friction is inevitable.

541
00:28:01,794 --> 00:28:02,918
Is that true, boss?

542
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,351
These are Victor's designs?

543
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:08,561
Victor's a genius, sure.

544
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:12,215
Great. Do you have any idea
how annoying it can be to spend

545
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,776
all your time
with a quote, "brilliant man"?

546
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,199
What is that like?

547
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:20,290
He could never listen
to an idea that wasn't his.

548
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:21,240
So stubborn.

549
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,266
I do know what that is like.

550
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:28,193
He ever get violent with you?

551
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:31,376
- No.
- You ever get violent with him?

552
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:35,296
It wasn't like that.

553
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:38,205
I wanted to experiment with fuels.

554
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:41,129
Victor was myopic.
Tunnel vision on his prototype.

555
00:28:41,746 --> 00:28:43,135
Just so we're clear,

556
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:46,557
your marriage fell apart
because of jet packs?

557
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:48,476
Because of communication.

558
00:28:49,131 --> 00:28:50,812
We could no longer communicate.

559
00:28:51,407 --> 00:28:53,231
You hired Sayers
to test your version.

560
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:55,983
Yes,
and I know what that looks like,

561
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,194
but the last test flight
was over a month ago.

562
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:01,781
I can show you the records
if I could find them.

563
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,033
He also kept you informed
on what Victor was up to.

564
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,745
Since you could
no longer communicate.

565
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,271
Sayers had experience.

566
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,391
He was skilled.

567
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:12,709
These are complicated machines,
whatever the design.

568
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:14,263
They all look the same.

569
00:29:14,347 --> 00:29:16,337
There are a myriad of differences,
believe me.

570
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,090
This one uses the same fuel source
that killed Sayers.

571
00:29:20,582 --> 00:29:23,344
I didn't give him the pack,
if that is what you're implying.

572
00:29:23,954 --> 00:29:26,055
Is that what you were implying,
Mr. Gibbs?

573
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:31,382
Don't say another word, Ms. Tillman.
You are entitled to legal counsel.

574
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:34,833
- She's your client, too?
- If she wishes to be.

575
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:39,091
And I would advise her at this time
to refrain from speaking to you.

576
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,325
You also represent her ex-husband.

577
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:43,531
That's not a conflict of interest?

578
00:29:43,942 --> 00:29:46,135
My interest is justice, Mr. Gibbs.

579
00:29:46,394 --> 00:29:47,201
Mine, too.

580
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,609
Then we should get along just fine.

581
00:29:49,693 --> 00:29:52,790
If you have any other inquiries for...
either of my clients,

582
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:56,627
- feel free to contact me.
- No, thanks. I already got one.

583
00:30:02,311 --> 00:30:04,469
Lone samurai playing both sides
against the middle.

584
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,708
It's like <i>Yojimbo</i>,
or <i>A Fistful of Dollars</i>,

585
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:09,554
which is the Western remake
of <i>Yojimbo</i>, so it's really like <i>Yojimbo</i>.

586
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:12,010
Sayers was test flying
for both camps.

587
00:30:12,094 --> 00:30:15,317
And the pack that kills him is made
of pieces of both of their designs.

588
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:17,001
Oh, yeah, you're right.

589
00:30:17,705 --> 00:30:19,562
Why do you sound surprised?
You said the same.

590
00:30:19,646 --> 00:30:21,758
I was talking about the lawyer,
not the pilot.

591
00:30:21,842 --> 00:30:24,367
She must have represented
the Tillmans as a couple.

592
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:26,111
That's not the connection here.

593
00:30:26,195 --> 00:30:28,654
Figure it out.
I want to know the endgame.

594
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:31,471
- Which one, the lawyer or the pilot?
- Both of them.

595
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,623
I'm confused.

596
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:35,422
Time of death, Duck?

597
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:39,348
I'm trying to determine
the sequence of events...

598
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:40,963
that ended Sayers' life.

599
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:43,586
There are so many threads
left to disentangle.

600
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:45,199
You got no time of death?

601
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,304
You haven't even given me
a definitive cause of death.

602
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:54,769
It is a frustrating case.

603
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,399
That lawyer woman, Ducky.

604
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:05,096
She's trying to keep me
from talking to anybody that matters.

605
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,366
If I didn't know better,
I would say she's getting to you.

606
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:11,976
She acts like she hates me, but...

607
00:31:12,907 --> 00:31:15,248
she talks like she... likes me.

608
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:17,041
Ever been married to her?

609
00:31:17,304 --> 00:31:19,110
Yeah, that would explain it,
wouldn't it?

610
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:22,338
Come on, tell me you got something.

611
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:23,531
Well...

612
00:31:24,977 --> 00:31:28,803
Sayers' helmet shielded his face
from the burst of

613
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,955
the explosion and the subsequent
attention his corpse...

614
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,042
drew from the native wildlife.

615
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:37,333
However, I found
acidic erosion inside his throat

616
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:39,137
and inside his nasal cavities.

617
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:41,398
It appears to be stomach acid.

618
00:31:42,264 --> 00:31:44,675
- He vomited.
- Violently. Profusely.

619
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,759
However,

620
00:31:45,843 --> 00:31:49,699
Abby found no corresponding acid
on the inside of his face shield.

621
00:31:51,665 --> 00:31:53,019
What does that mean?

622
00:31:53,668 --> 00:31:56,095
Somebody cleaned him up
and then put the helmet back on him?

623
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:57,015
Likely.

624
00:31:57,489 --> 00:32:00,876
I strongly doubt that he was conscious
when he was strapped into the harness.

625
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,060
He was...

626
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,547
Well, it's possible he was...

627
00:32:06,411 --> 00:32:07,511
He was what?

628
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,380
Flying dead?

629
00:32:13,153 --> 00:32:14,520
Well, explain that.

630
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:21,679
It's a remote control receiver?

631
00:32:21,763 --> 00:32:22,930
Yes, it is.

632
00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:24,274
What is the range?

633
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:25,818
Almost a kilometer.

634
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:29,041
I don't speak Canadian.
How far is that?

635
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:32,199
Sayers' pack could be remotely operated
or remotely detonated.

636
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:36,030
We did not see anything like this
in either of the Tillman designs.

637
00:32:36,114 --> 00:32:37,622
It has to be one of them.

638
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,783
Does it? Maybe we're looking for
a completely different fabricator here.

639
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:42,575
Maybe it's neither of the Tillmans'.

640
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:44,950
<i>I want the Tillmans
and that lawyer there.</i>

641
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:46,222
Okay, right away.

642
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:48,414
Let's find out.

643
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,994
We recovered this RF receiver
from the wreckage.

644
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:54,013
I want to know which one
of you this belongs to.

645
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,891
An RF receiver.
What a stupid idea.

646
00:32:57,164 --> 00:32:59,894
- Oh, because you didn't think of it?
- Oh, this is your dumb idea?

647
00:33:00,262 --> 00:33:01,896
No, it's not mine,
but it's not dumb.

648
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:04,523
Mr. Tillman, Ms. Tillman, please.

649
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,826
We're gonna need to see
your inventory lists and blueprints

650
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,160
so that we can confirm
that neither of you manufactured it.

651
00:33:16,517 --> 00:33:17,995
I will consider your request.

652
00:33:19,172 --> 00:33:20,289
It's not a request.

653
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:23,918
Well, look at that.
A court order.

654
00:33:24,764 --> 00:33:25,962
Was that so hard?

655
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:29,256
Wait a minute. Does he still think
one of us murdered Sayers?

656
00:33:29,614 --> 00:33:32,385
- He was working both of you.
- Well, you insist that...

657
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,221
you didn't provide him with
the equipment, he must've stolen it.

658
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:38,307
Well, then he was very good at it,
because that's news to me.

659
00:33:38,826 --> 00:33:41,102
You knew he was stealing
from your husband.

660
00:33:43,507 --> 00:33:44,438
You...

661
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:52,989
Clearly, your intention here is

662
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,283
to stir up some animosity
in the hopes that an emotional outburst

663
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,490
will reveal some insight
into your investigation.

664
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,918
Or...

665
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:04,514
have you uncovered some facts
that need corroboration?

666
00:34:04,598 --> 00:34:07,885
I'd hate to think that you brought us
in here under false pretenses.

667
00:34:09,778 --> 00:34:12,007
Time of death was 13 days ago.

668
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:14,794
I was in the Bahamas.

669
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:17,221
That's your idea
of a traditional winter vacation?

670
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:19,640
No, it was Steve Bennett's idea.

671
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,504
Where were you?

672
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:25,061
- New Hampshire.
- With that slut, Laura Truftin?

673
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,907
- At least she likes sex!
- I like sex!

674
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:29,191
- I just don't like sex with you!
- Enough!

675
00:34:37,732 --> 00:34:39,896
- I assume that's all.
- That's all?

676
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:41,454
Fantastic.

677
00:34:44,598 --> 00:34:46,374
- Jerk.
- After you.

678
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:50,005
Well, one of them ends up dead,
we won't have far to look.

679
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,488
Would it be impossible for you

680
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:55,977
to apologize for implicating them
in Sayers' death?

681
00:34:57,326 --> 00:34:58,711
Yeah, they're off the hook.

682
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,385
I expect we've seen the last of each
other as far as this case goes.

683
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:02,683
I don't know.

684
00:35:03,441 --> 00:35:05,384
I might have to keep my eye on you.

685
00:35:05,985 --> 00:35:06,729
Why?

686
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:10,601
It doesn't seem like you have
a clue what you're doing.

687
00:35:23,687 --> 00:35:25,635
I think he's about
to have a thought.

688
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:28,457
I think blood is about
to come out of his eyeballs.

689
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:31,629
No, this is gonna be impressive.

690
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:33,747
All right,
this is a remote control jet pack.

691
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,341
That is what we're looking at here.

692
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:39,269
Okay, that wasn't very impressive.

693
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:42,181
Excuse me, it's very impressive.

694
00:35:42,872 --> 00:35:45,004
Do you understand
the countless tiny adjustments

695
00:35:45,088 --> 00:35:47,686
have to be made manually
in order to maintain level flight?

696
00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:50,130
It's an art flying a jet pack.

697
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:52,942
That's why both the Tillmans
hired an expert pilot.

698
00:35:53,112 --> 00:35:54,733
- But...
- Wait,

699
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:57,070
let him go.
He's building up to something.

700
00:35:57,231 --> 00:35:59,914
See, without a pilot you'd need
a modified fly-by-wire system

701
00:35:59,998 --> 00:36:02,284
with computer assisted
stabilization. But to build that,

702
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,494
you would have to be
an expert engineer.

703
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:09,291
So, are we looking for a pilot
or are we looking for an engineer?

704
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,246
There's a lightbulb.

705
00:36:13,426 --> 00:36:16,298
We're looking for both.
Palmer, hand me those blueprints.

706
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:19,988
Yeah, that's right, Boss.

707
00:36:20,072 --> 00:36:21,866
- It's everything we found on her.
- <i>Got it.</i>

708
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,722
- It was his!
- What was?

709
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:24,955
The pack.

710
00:36:25,165 --> 00:36:27,852
It didn't belong to either
of the Tillmans. It belonged to Sayers.

711
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:29,519
He built his own jet pack?

712
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,731
The pack uses fighter jet engineering.
That's the missing piece.

713
00:36:33,198 --> 00:36:37,069
Sayers ripped off the technology
from both of the Tillmans and...

714
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:39,995
He borrowed from the Navy, as well,
to build his own version,

715
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:41,878
which used the best of all three.

716
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:45,310
- But it crashed.
- So, it was not very good.

717
00:36:45,656 --> 00:36:47,872
That was the intention.
The intention was to crash.

718
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,000
To dispose of the body
where it wouldn't be discovered.

719
00:36:51,238 --> 00:36:52,877
It was pretty far off
the beaten path.

720
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,834
Any decent pilot could've flown it.

721
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,672
How about a great pilot?

722
00:36:57,246 --> 00:37:00,121
Sheridan wanted the job with Tillman.
He petitioned the Navy for it.

723
00:37:00,205 --> 00:37:02,261
But Sayers took that,
then picked up a second one.

724
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:05,723
Sheridan loses out twice,
probably doesn't respond well to that.

725
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:07,683
Gonna pull
the squadron's psych profiles.

726
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:12,188
Let's double-check their paperwork, scan
their files for engineering backgrounds.

727
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:13,896
I need to talk to Gibbs.

728
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:15,858
Where is Gibbs?

729
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,694
<i>Right here, Elf Lord.</i>

730
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:34,043
You're following me?

731
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:38,148
- You had my people followed.
- So you had to even the score?

732
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:41,050
No, I do my own legwork.

733
00:37:42,003 --> 00:37:43,344
So, what'd you find?

734
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:45,346
A patent filing.

735
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,558
Five years ago,
you billed Victor Tillman $400 an hour.

736
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:53,048
- My rates have gone up since then.
- I bet, but on this case,

737
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:55,229
you waived your fees.
You took them both pro bono.

738
00:37:56,478 --> 00:37:58,115
In my experience,

739
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:02,321
the money is a by-product of doing
the right thing and doing it quite well.

740
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:05,073
You know what, you weren't looking
for a big payday at all.

741
00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:07,657
No, you were looking for me.

742
00:38:09,325 --> 00:38:11,807
- Egocentric.
- You were looking to pick a fight.

743
00:38:11,891 --> 00:38:13,165
I didn't pick this fight.

744
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:14,875
But now that I met you,

745
00:38:17,236 --> 00:38:18,628
I'm glad to be in it.

746
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,218
I just can't believe it,
Agent Gibbs.

747
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,513
There was money to be made.

748
00:38:28,303 --> 00:38:30,659
Sheridan wanted the job,
and Sayers took it from him.

749
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,978
There was another job to be had as well.
Sayers got that one, too.

750
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:37,355
I knew Banshee was competitive, but
I never imagined it'd turn violent.

751
00:38:38,095 --> 00:38:38,941
Might not.

752
00:38:39,285 --> 00:38:41,857
Yeah.
Sayers was killed with poison.

753
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,319
Likely slipped
into his food or drink.

754
00:38:44,403 --> 00:38:47,057
- It's really not all that violent.
- More common with female killers,

755
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:48,534
- actually.
- Really?

756
00:38:49,081 --> 00:38:50,202
Yeah, really.

757
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:53,553
We got a court order to search
the base for evidence,

758
00:38:53,637 --> 00:38:55,229
starting with Sheridan's locker.

759
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:56,500
You sure?

760
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:04,493
Commander, a word.

761
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:08,262
- I got a hop in ten.
- You're not gonna make that.

762
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,963
You're proficient
with fly-by-wire technology?

763
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:12,383
'Course I am.

764
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:15,728
Is this about Hondo?
You know what happened to him?

765
00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:18,938
He was stealing tech secrets
from the Tillmans and the Navy.

766
00:39:19,284 --> 00:39:22,149
Using pieces of all three
to build his own prototype.

767
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:24,303
Complete with fly-by-wire.

768
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:27,050
Could be controlled
with a remote like this one.

769
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:30,517
He built this?
That's impossible.

770
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:33,786
Hondo, he was a great flyboy, but...

771
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:35,073
Better than you?

772
00:39:36,194 --> 00:39:37,344
In some ways.

773
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:39,609
But that's all he was.

774
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:41,378
He couldn't build
a soapbox derby racer.

775
00:39:41,697 --> 00:39:43,464
Right, no engineering background.

776
00:39:43,683 --> 00:39:45,965
That's why he needed a partner.
That's who killed him.

777
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:49,137
You were saying I was his competition.
Now you're saying I'm his partner?

778
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:55,429
If the guy partnered up
with Sayers to build a prototype,

779
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:58,562
he wouldn't have destroyed the only one.
There's another one somewhere.

780
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:00,003
Here he comes.

781
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:03,054
We just need it to look like
you're our man, Banshee.

782
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:08,444
He is going for it.

783
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:25,630
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

784
00:40:25,971 --> 00:40:27,367
This is the only way out.

785
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:36,848
This is unbelievable!

786
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,156
- McGee, you got him?!
- I'm scanning frequencies.

787
00:40:52,437 --> 00:40:53,699
All right, I'm locked on.

788
00:40:55,805 --> 00:40:56,829
Got him.

789
00:40:59,608 --> 00:41:01,004
Bringing him back, Boss.

790
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:04,461
Here he comes.
It works!

791
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:05,461
This is sweet.

792
00:41:08,754 --> 00:41:10,969
He's like a hummingbird.
I want to fly him!

793
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,947
- Tony, stop it!
- You're gonna break it!

794
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:16,305
- Get him down!
- I'm bringing him down, Boss.

795
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:19,935
He's coming.

796
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:25,565
Hands in the air!

797
00:41:30,627 --> 00:41:31,988
Let's go, Rocket Man.

798
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:40,204
- Hey, where's McGee?
- Hey, Boss.

799
00:41:41,484 --> 00:41:44,373
He's... resting his fried circuits.
I don't know what the big deal is.

800
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:46,295
Just a little rocket science.

801
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,139
Yeah,
it's not like it's brain surgery.

802
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:52,217
- I want to see more pictures of her.
- Yeah, me, too.

803
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:54,778
All right.

804
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:58,973
I get your fascination, boss.
She's a spellbinder.

805
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:02,051
You could get lost
in those icy blue eyes.

806
00:42:06,873 --> 00:42:08,650
You know what was a little weird,
though?

807
00:42:08,897 --> 00:42:10,652
How she seemed
to know me before we met.

808
00:42:11,134 --> 00:42:12,570
Not just me, either.
You.

809
00:42:13,006 --> 00:42:14,524
- Us.
- That one right there.

810
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:17,993
Is that her and Colonel Bell?

811
00:42:24,176 --> 00:42:25,376
Bell sent her.

812
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,403
- How did you know?
- Her hand,

813
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:30,112
his shoulder.

814
00:42:31,865 --> 00:42:33,049
Photo's been cropped.

815
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:42,861
You got that off a pinkie?

816
00:42:44,992 --> 00:42:46,641
What do you think they're up to?

817
00:42:47,494 --> 00:42:49,697

Happy new year and best wishes!
