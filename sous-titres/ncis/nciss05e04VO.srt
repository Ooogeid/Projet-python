2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:05,826
Every body has a story to tell.

3
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:09,971
Now although this gentleman
died a natural death,

4
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:11,197
he gave his cadaver

5
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:13,501
to further your education,

6
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:17,553
so pay careful attention
to what he has to tell us.

7
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,097
Now, the brain.

8
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:22,396
Inside,

9
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:26,148
you will see
the delicate structures and pathways

10
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:30,501
that determine memories,
emotions, basic motor functions.

11
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:32,273
In sum,

12
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:34,374
who we are.

13
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:36,128
Mr. Palmer would you

14
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:39,066
cradle the brain while I sever this...?

15
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:41,057
Lieutenant Greer, the four...

16
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:42,936
lobes of the cerebrum?

17
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:44,639
It's the frontal,

18
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:45,956
the parietal,

19
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:47,421
occipital

20
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:48,945
and temporal.

21
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:55,884
The adult human brain
weighs approximately three pounds.

22
00:00:55,995 --> 00:00:57,866
Feels like a soggy grapefruit.

23
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:00,824
Yes. Well, pass it around.

24
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,864
Now, don't let its small size fool you.

25
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:07,428
The cerebral cortex contains one

26
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:10,009
billion neurons and one

27
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:12,778
million billion connections,
or synapses.

28
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,449
If you were to count
one synapse per second,

29
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:20,037
you wouldn't finish counting
for 32 million years.

30
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:21,711
Doctor,

31
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:23,931
is this natural?

32
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:30,317
Certainly not.

33
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,395
What the hell is that?

34
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:34,474
This, my dear lieutenant...

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,498
is murder.

36
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:41,780
Team-NCIS presents:

37
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:45,738
NCIS Season 5 Episode 4
Identity Crisis  (Version LOL V1.0)

38
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,653
Capture: Swsub.com
Synchro: Akazab, Kasius and Gaillots.

39
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:51,539
Corrections : Kom1dune and Magic Turtle.

40
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,429
Not bad.

41
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:26,185
And look at this one.
You're going to love this guy.

42
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,927
Yeah, he would not be safe with me.
I would eat him.

43
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:32,750
He's so adorable.
How can you say no to that face?

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,387
Please tell me you're looking
for a man for Ziva.

45
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:37,429
Not me.

46
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:40,166
McGoo, is there something
you want to tell me?

47
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:42,423
Looking at animal rescue sites.

48
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:44,312
McGee's thinking about getting a puppy.

49
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:45,639
Puppy's a lot of work.

50
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:47,710
You got to feed it, walk it, train it.

51
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:50,045
Yeah. I'm not 12, all right?

52
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:52,323
I work hard.
I deserve someone who will

53
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:54,706
jump up all excited when I get home,
you know?

54
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,623
Lay on the couch, watch TV.

55
00:02:56,624 --> 00:02:58,043
Maybe lick my face a little bit.

56
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:01,508
Might be easier getting a girlfriend.

57
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,734
Which might even be easier with a puppy.

58
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,350
Even for you.

59
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:10,285
I'm not ready to start taking
tips from you on this yet, probie.

60
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:13,489
Tony, I think it's time
you get back on that horse.

61
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,500
- Are you getting a pony?
- It's an adage.

62
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:19,029
I am not familiar with that breed.

63
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:20,925
Yeah, well, they are quite rare.

64
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:23,935
Sort of a cross between
a Pegasus and a unicorn.

65
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,533
- So, who's the favorite?
- The Pit Bull.

66
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:32,764
Yeah, that makes sense for you,
actually.

67
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,310
Not really for McGee.

68
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,043
He's more of a...

69
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,232
Spaniel kind of guy.

70
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,696
Cocker, maybe?

71
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,426
How about an Australian Shepherd?

72
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:46,830
They're working dogs.

73
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:50,035
- Pick it up, DiNozzo.
- On it, boss.

74
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:51,840
A.F.I.P. Smooth things over.

75
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:54,340
Please hold.

76
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:57,927
What did we do to incur the wrath of
the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology?

77
00:03:57,928 --> 00:03:59,709
Ducky kept one of their cadavers.

78
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:01,389
Ducky stole a cadaver?

79
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:02,834
I'm sure he had a good reason.

80
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:03,857
I hope so.

81
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:06,743
Sit.

82
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,266
Stay.

83
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:13,535
Roll over.

84
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:22,560
It's absolutely ridiculous, Jethro.

85
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:25,710
This man's body should
never have been donated to science.

86
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,372
Too late for a refund.

87
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:28,967
He was murdered, Jethro,

88
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:32,273
with an injection of mercury
into his brain. A liquid bullet.

89
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:35,407
Mr. Palmer is presently
endeavoring to reach

90
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:38,706
the M.E. who made
such a grievous oversight.

91
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,859
- Still no answer, Doctor.
- Then redial, Mr. Palmer.

92
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:44,266
Yes.

93
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:46,631
Unidentified African-American male,

94
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,415
approximately 50 years old

95
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:51,416
blood-alcohol level zero point one-two.

96
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,815
Official cause of death: asphyxiation
from the deceased's own vomit.

97
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,435
However, here's the kicker.

98
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:59,622
They elected not to perform an autopsy.

99
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:02,760
But it would be pretty hard to find
a pinprick hole in the base of a skull.

100
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,651
And heavy metals
wouldn't show on a tox screen

101
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,042
unless you're looking for them,

102
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:07,123
specifically.

103
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:11,415
Mr. Palmer, do not defend
the inefficiency of others.

104
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,320
I'm not sure you can just
take control of a body, Duck.

105
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,419
Well, someone has to.

106
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,787
I mean, based on preliminary findings,
County Police

107
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,261
determined that he was
a nameless drifter.

108
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:23,457
A John Doe.

109
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,962
Had too much to drink
and died in his sleep.

110
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:28,599
Some people live their
whole lives off the grid.

111
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:29,879
No, not our man.

112
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:32,866
I'd wager that he spent
several years in prison.

113
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,571
Yeah, it's elementary, my dear Jethro.

114
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:39,740
The proliferation of
scar tissue on his body.

115
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:42,088
Cigarette-sized burns.

116
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:44,139
Our John Doe led a violent life.

117
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:48,416
Yes, well, this long scar
on his left leg is surgical.

118
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:50,484
However, it healed poorly.

119
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:52,818
Suggests prison-caliber
medical treatment.

120
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:54,559
Especially post-operative.

121
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:56,469
And the tattooing.

122
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,925
Pen ink.
Jailhouse style.

123
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:02,750
Yes. Perhaps we can get Abby
to shed some light on this pattern.

124
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:04,515
It's her area of expertise.

125
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,641
A John Doe.
I mean, it's ridiculous.

126
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:10,812
It can't be that difficult
to locate a prison record.

127
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,716
Somebody must actually
care that this man is dead

128
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:15,102
Well?

129
00:06:15,862 --> 00:06:17,463
Did you locate the M.E.?

130
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,543
No. I gave up.

131
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:21,746
There in lies the problem.

132
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:25,270
People are just not willing
to do the legwork.

133
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:30,183
He had a murder victim
right in front of him,

134
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:32,786
classroom full of military students.

135
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,068
I think he might be a bit embarrassed.

136
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,880
Excellent detective work.

137
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:46,004
I hope your opinion of me doesn't
waver after I've given this fellow

138
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,382
- a piece of my mind.
- Never.

139
00:06:47,383 --> 00:06:49,502
I warn you, this might get ugly.

140
00:06:50,882 --> 00:06:53,699
I'm looking for Dr. Jordan Hampton.

141
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,532
You found her.

142
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:01,288
Is there something wrong
with your telephone?

143
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:04,034
Wouldn't know.
I don't answer it.

144
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:06,150
Too many bodies, and not enough time.

145
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:09,358
Special Agent Gibbs,

146
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,548
Dr. Donald Mallard. NCIS.

147
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:14,877
Pleasure. I assume you're not
here to check on my phone.

148
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:17,664
Perhaps you'd have a moment
to discuss a John Doe that

149
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:19,729
crossed your table nine days ago.

150
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:22,156
Remember the body?

151
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:23,636
Yeah, I remember every body.

152
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:26,484
50 something, black male found

153
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:29,360
DOA on Highland Pier.
Aspirated on his own vomit.

154
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:32,958
I assume you kept him
the requisite 72 hours.

155
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,976
No one made any inquiries.

156
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:38,941
Day two of his stay,
I caught a priority triple homicide.

157
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:41,454
Day four, Anatomy Board picked him up.

158
00:07:41,924 --> 00:07:43,062
You needed the space.

159
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:44,864
Not a whole lot of elbow room.

160
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:46,998
Where he went after that, I can't say.

161
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:50,707
A.F.I.P., and then, our autopsy suite.

162
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,490
We're investigating his
death as a homicide.

163
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,086
Damn it.

164
00:07:56,992 --> 00:07:58,208
I missed something.

165
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:00,502
An injection of mercury into his brain

166
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,146
in between the first vertebrae
and the occipital bone.

167
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,945
Police tried

168
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,677
and failed to ID him.

169
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:12,061
AFIS database and dental
record searches: they came up empty.

170
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,299
- DNA?
- I'm not sure how it goes at NCIS,

171
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,267
around here,
that takes about six months.

172
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,956
Never canvassed the scene.

173
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:20,167
Sadly, most cops I know,
they prefer to hear,

174
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:22,598
"case closed" than look for
a reason to open one.

175
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:24,517
It's not the first time

176
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:26,677
someone's slipped through the cracks.

177
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:28,994
Well, I'm glad you caught him,
Dr. Mallard.

178
00:08:29,804 --> 00:08:30,807
As am I.

179
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:40,072
Yeah, I hope she recovers
from that tongue-lashing.

180
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,451
What do you find under the pier?

181
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:49,650
85 cents, two batteries
and a bottle cap.

182
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,244
- No mercury, no needle.
- Keep looking.

183
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:54,532
Got to find someone who knew him.

184
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:57,644
Highland Beach in October.

185
00:08:57,888 --> 00:08:59,219
How much of a tourist draw.

186
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:01,101
Soft-shell crab season's almost over.

187
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,891
People really like boats that much?

188
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:04,665
You work for the Navy, DiNozzo.

189
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:14,548
Maybe we should start
with this waitress.

190
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:21,993
Eating or asking questions?

191
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:26,669
If you were hoping for subtle,
you could have lost the guns.

192
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:28,252
Or least the hats.

193
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,306
Excuse me.

194
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,913
I'd just like to show you a photo,
see if you recognize this man.

195
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:37,538
Okay.

196
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:39,318
You trying to build suspense?

197
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:40,454
No.

198
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,188
It's just that the man
in the photo is dead, and...

199
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:48,131
some people find that shocking.

200
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:50,603
Thanks for being gentle.

201
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,205
I'm a gentle man.

202
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:55,987
<i>- Seen him?</i>
- Never seen him.

203
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:04,253
So, the waitress, Miss Shannon O'Hara,
remembers our guy.

204
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:07,087
Never got a name,
paid cash, big tipper.

205
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,963
- How about your biker gang there?
- They're just passing through.

206
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:12,552
- That's it?
- Yeah, they don't like cops much.

207
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,235
Check out the brunette at the table.

208
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:18,760
Good eye, boss.

209
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:21,637
I'll tell you, my radar is just
totally shot. She's smokin'.

210
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,036
That's not what you meant.

211
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:25,654
You were suggesting that she seems
interested in our presence,

212
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:28,173
maybe a little too interested,
and that should question her.

213
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:29,267
Not a problem.

214
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:32,228
That's a problem.

215
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,093
- Oh, excuse me.
- No, excuse me.

216
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,265
Mind if we ask where you're
going in such a hurry?

217
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,369
What business is it of NCIS?

218
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,744
We're looking for anyone
who might have known this man.

219
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,287
He's dead?

220
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,311
You know him?

221
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:56,215
His name's Marvin Hinton.
He was with me.

222
00:10:56,243 --> 00:10:57,398
And you are?

223
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,462
Careful.

224
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:00,186
I was just reaching for my ID.

225
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:06,792
Special Agent Courtney Krieger.

226
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,940
Hinton was working for the FBI.

227
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:21,453
Hey, Gibbs, need a refill?
I'm going.

228
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:23,575
We, yeah, Betro.
Thanks, make it a double.

229
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,633
You got it.

230
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,070
Still can't find any record
of Marvin Hinton.

231
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:31,827
And you won't.
Marvin Hinton doesn't exist anymore.

232
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:33,087
"Anymore"?

233
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,214
His cellmates swear Marvin Hinton
served six years at Cumberland,

234
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,061
although any record of it vanished
when he was released last month.

235
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:42,780
We had to reassemble his history
by hand, it's not complete.

236
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:45,851
He once went by the name
Frederick LeClair.

237
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:49,446
Hinton aka LeClair.

238
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:52,905
Bootlegging, false IDs,
resisting arrest, theft.

239
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:54,752
The guy's a career felon.

240
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:56,512
Interstate trafficking, primarily.

241
00:11:56,563 --> 00:11:58,025
How did he show up on your radar?

242
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,298
Was a routine tip.

243
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:02,023
Picked him up offloading
stolen cargo containers.

244
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:05,652
At which point, you discover a nameless
man whose entire history's been erased.

245
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:08,915
- No fingerprints, no criminal record.
- Not even a high school transcript.

246
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:11,761
That's impossible, you'd need
first person access to

247
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,732
a federal mainframe, credit ratings,
countless private companies.

248
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,528
That'd be like taking
spit out of the ocean.

249
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:17,534
How did he do it?

250
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:18,762
Claimed he didn't.

251
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:21,710
Said he was contacted by
someone offering the service.

252
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,032
"The Eraser".

253
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:24,820
What movie is that from?

254
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,978
I don't know, Flashdance?

255
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:28,843
Why was Hinton not back in prison?

256
00:12:28,906 --> 00:12:31,241
He was a small fish, but The Eraser...

257
00:12:31,374 --> 00:12:32,706
he's our real target.

258
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,612
We hoped he would contact Hinton,

259
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:36,683
get paid off and finish the job.

260
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,778
Provide Hinton with a new identity.

261
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,212
Exactly.

262
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:41,814
I was left to baby-sit.

263
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,614
It was my first field assignment.

264
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:46,147
Never expected him to be killed.

265
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,930
That is what happens to bait.

266
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:51,204
Hey, it's not your fault.

267
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:55,824
So why didn't Hinton skip town
when he had the opportunity?

268
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,406
He was having too good a time
on the government expense account.

269
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,589
But we did have him under
24-hour monitoring, three-team shifts.

270
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,977
- What changed?
- The Eraser didn't make contact.

271
00:13:04,058 --> 00:13:06,604
They pulled my surveillance team
to chase other leads.

272
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:08,140
You notify your boss.

273
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:10,272
We need to know everything you know.

274
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,954
The Bureau set Hinton up here?

275
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:16,852
It's maintain the appearance
he was flush.

276
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:18,522
Anyone else have their own key?

277
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,068
No, we met here weekly
so no one would see us together.

278
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:23,349
He agreed to play along
in exchange for leniency.

279
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,109
But he knew it could be dangerous.

280
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:26,839
Forget the puppy, McGee.

281
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:30,279
A place like this is what
you need to score with the chicks.

282
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:36,788
Here.

283
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:43,557
Boss, this could be the murder weapon:

284
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:44,607
mercury.

285
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:58,006
Positive for blood.

286
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:07,864
Fluids.

287
00:14:07,865 --> 00:14:09,175
Lots of them.

288
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,110
No surprise there.

289
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,462
Six years in prison.

290
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:18,334
The Eraser made the initial
contact at the Crab Shack.

291
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:19,534
Not face to face.

292
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:20,931
No, slipped him a note.

293
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:23,668
So, you sent Hinton back,
hoping for another one.

294
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,155
Hinton was supposed to keep a record
of anyone he came in contact with.

295
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:30,320
I was running background checks,
chasing down his leads

296
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:32,039
I was waiting for anything new.

297
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:33,386
You got your wish.

298
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,878
Your first crime scene.

299
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:37,809
He was killed in that room.

300
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:41,846
This is why I love you guys.

301
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:44,666
You bring me hair, you bring me blood,
you bring me fluids.

302
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:45,805
And mercury.

303
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:48,906
Predictable, yet constantly surprising.

304
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,082
We try.

305
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:51,692
Of course, mercury is toxic,

306
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:54,886
so you shouldn't let kids break open
thermometers and play with it.

307
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,577
Speaking from personal experience, Abb?

308
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:57,790
Actually explains a lot.

309
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,449
You want it, but it kills you.

310
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:00,839
It's like a metaphor.

311
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:03,246
- It's a cigarette.
- Or chocolate for dogs.

312
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:05,485
By the way,
I like the dachshund for you.

313
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:07,959
- You could name him Mercury.
- This mercury, Abby.

314
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,333
Industrial grade,
commonly used in heavy machinery,

315
00:15:10,373 --> 00:15:12,822
although it's fallen out of favor
because of the fear factor.

316
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:15,204
A lot of it's being dropped on
developing nations like India.

317
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,138
Where exporting/dumping
has become a major revenue stream.

318
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:20,914
Anyways, um,
this is what killed our painted man.

319
00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:22,375
Speaking of which...

320
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,575
I've seen a lot of great skin art
done with a ballpoint pen and a needle.

321
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,215
Like this and this.

322
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:30,289
Very nice.

323
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:32,572
But this guy's tattoo it's,

324
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:35,490
It's a mess. The symbols are gibberish,

325
00:15:35,491 --> 00:15:37,749
the pattern's haphazard.
It's a puzzle.

326
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,138
It puzzles me, Gibbs.

327
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:40,399
I'm determined to solve it.

328
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,421
Hair samples.

329
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:43,096
Not nearly as interesting.

330
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:44,452
Six different women.

331
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:46,270
Hinton had a lot of girlfriends.

332
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,956
One's a bleach blonde.
One's auburn from a bottle,

333
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:50,248
if you want to know anything else,

334
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,201
you have to find something
to match it against.

335
00:15:58,012 --> 00:15:59,189
Delivery for Tony.

336
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:00,787
I got it, I got it.

337
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:01,887
Thank you.

338
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:05,691
- Hey, how are you?
- Good, thanks.

339
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:09,421
Here you go.

340
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,366
Thank you.
Have a good night.

341
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:14,739
Keep the change.

342
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:20,660
Portobello mushroom, no tomato.

343
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:25,370
Philly cheese steak,
extra steak, extra cheese.

344
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:31,206
These are all Hinton's contacts.

345
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:33,761
Can't help but notice they're all women.

346
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,620
What made him think
The Eraser was a woman?

347
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:39,202
I don't know that he did.

348
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:41,395
Well...
Cause you know,

349
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:43,836
you said he was enjoying himself.

350
00:16:45,982 --> 00:16:47,081
You, you...

351
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,268
You have mushroom in your teeth.

352
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:54,006
Where's your bathroom?

353
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,957
I will show you

354
00:16:57,134 --> 00:16:58,584
where it is.

355
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:05,274
Hey, so I've been thinking
about the murder.

356
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,547
Why kill him that way?

357
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:11,071
I mean an injection into the brain,

358
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,914
definitely not the most common method.

359
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,411
To find out "why,"
you must ask "who."

360
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:17,173
Someone tidy.

361
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:19,200
Someone who doesn't like messes.

362
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:21,809
- You have a theory?
- Someone

363
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:24,705
who needs to be in constant
control of the situation.

364
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:28,176
Someone who does not like
to lose control of their emotions.

365
00:17:30,597 --> 00:17:32,104
Ziva, what are you doing?

366
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:35,159
I'm not an expert here,

367
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,100
but I'm pretty sure what you're
doing now is a violation of the code.

368
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:39,576
It is not against the law.

369
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:41,524
The woman's code.

370
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,849
McGee, I bet you
if we take a strand of her hair,

371
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:47,446
it will match the sample
from Hinton's condo.

372
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:50,495
Well, of course it would. She's already
said she been there every week.

373
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,886
This woman is uptight.

374
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:54,821
Not even a single strand.

375
00:17:59,598 --> 00:18:01,566
We will have to go to the source.

376
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:03,013
Ziva, no hair pulling.

377
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:05,643
She's the only one
that was in contact with Hinton.

378
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:08,653
It would have been easy for her
to just sweep him under the rug.

379
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,160
Motive?

380
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,638
She's ambitious.
He became too much of a complication.

381
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:15,725
When someone's that uptight, it's only
a matter of time before they...

382
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:16,909
snap.

383
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:17,935
Okay.

384
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:20,349
You don't like her.

385
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:21,824
Do you?

386
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:23,954
I understand what she's going through.

387
00:18:23,955 --> 00:18:26,905
I remember what it was like to be green,
afraid you're going to mess up.

388
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:29,462
- Which she did.
- So what, you want to rub it in?

389
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,763
Come on, Ziva, I think
she deserves a little sympathy.

390
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:35,972
Tony seems to like her.

391
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:41,492
I do not think Gibbs does.

392
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:58,856
Who do you work for, Tobias?
Homeland Security or the FBI?

393
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,560
The world's on my shoulders, Gibbs.

394
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:03,446
World made of paper.

395
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,413
Just throw that anywhere.

396
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:13,480
Kind of defeats the purpose
of e-mail when you have to

397
00:19:13,513 --> 00:19:15,244
print it all out for the fire anyway.

398
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:17,133
Yeah. That's why I don't use it.

399
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:19,743
Really? Not because you
can't figure out how to work it?

400
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,007
I spend most of my time now
coordinating the flow of information.

401
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:29,794
What can I give you?

402
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:32,178
Your opinion on Special Agent

403
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:34,250
Courtney Krieger.

404
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:39,062
Promising.

405
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:43,449
Does everything by the book, the
book doesn't show very much imagination.

406
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:46,765
Definitely a child
of the electronic age.

407
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:49,817
Currently running a low-level
asset in Highland Beach.

408
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:52,066
Asset named Hinton.

409
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:55,449
Okay, what am I missing?

410
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:57,190
Fact he was murdered.

411
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:00,373
Marvin Hinton is dead?

412
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:02,449
I told her to notify you.

413
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:11,119
You've got to be kidding me.

414
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:12,798
She sent an e-mail.

415
00:20:13,455 --> 00:20:15,133
It went in my spam folder.

416
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,253
This is serious, Gibbs.

417
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:21,399
Alive, Hinton was just an ex-con
who made a deal with the devil.

418
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,784
Dead means the devil came to collect.

419
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:24,961
Devil have a name?

420
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:27,212
That's just about all he's got.

421
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:29,823
You ever heard of Kamal Konkani?

422
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:33,748
Built his reputation in
the early '90s manufacturing

423
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,276
false IDs for IRA bombers.

424
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:39,819
Moved around Europe one step ahead of
the authorities for the next ten years.

425
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,874
Where he went, death followed.

426
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:43,658
Been invisible since the millennium.

427
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:45,665
He made a fortune
working for terrorists.

428
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,255
Hinton wasn't a terrorist.

429
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,344
Game has changed in a decade.

430
00:20:49,863 --> 00:20:53,874
Documents are more sophisticated,
electronic tracking, facial recognition.

431
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,809
We think Kamal was
using Hinton as a test.

432
00:20:57,946 --> 00:20:59,149
A test?
For what?

433
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,259
Homeland

434
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:05,002
picked up chatter from
a training facility in Libya.

435
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:06,809
A terrorist cell

436
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:10,148
with assurances of clean
entry onto U.S. soil.

437
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:12,411
Assurances from Kamal Konkani.

438
00:21:12,484 --> 00:21:13,873
And with Hinton dead...

439
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:16,819
The only eyes on Kamal
have been closed for a week.

440
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:27,686
You're telling me that there
are terrorists on the way here

441
00:21:27,716 --> 00:21:29,809
and they could be anyone?
How did this start?

442
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:32,916
With a dead man named
Marvin Hinton aka Frederick LeClair.

443
00:21:32,954 --> 00:21:34,768
An ex-con looking for a new identity.

444
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:37,948
A wish your Eraser was more
than happy to accommodate.

445
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:41,448
My boss looks mad.

446
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:43,566
He's going to chew you up.

447
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,467
Out. Chew you out.

448
00:21:45,717 --> 00:21:48,711
Maybe not, maybe he's one
of those silent killer types.

449
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:51,633
- What do you know about this Eraser?
- McGee.

450
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:56,248
Believed to be a Pakistani national
raised in India and England.

451
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:58,989
Made his name working with terrorists.

452
00:21:59,065 --> 00:22:00,725
Clean IDs, easy transit.

453
00:22:01,092 --> 00:22:04,945
Facilitated Basque terror attacks
in Spain, IRA bombings in England.

454
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,635
The GIA bombing in France in 1995.

455
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:11,079
Killed eight, wounded hundreds,
led by Khaled Kelkal.

456
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:15,071
French authorities identified the man
who made it possible as Kamal Konkani.

457
00:22:15,194 --> 00:22:16,564
That's a lot of "K's."

458
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:17,717
"K's" are funny.

459
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:19,220
Agent Krieger.

460
00:22:19,262 --> 00:22:20,990
You ever see The Sunshine Boys?

461
00:22:21,057 --> 00:22:22,909
But they weren't able to put a face

462
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:25,002
to the name before he
disappeared off the radar.

463
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:27,797
Apparently, he's relocated to Maryland.

464
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,896
Upgraded his system
for taking people off the grid.

465
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:33,786
We were tipped off to Hinton.
So it's possible that Kamal

466
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:36,000
dropped the dime
himself to test his work.

467
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:38,793
- His work seems impeccable.
- Now he's covering his tracks.

468
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:41,395
And shopping the service
to terrorists overseas.

469
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:43,990
I'll monitor the situation
in the training camps,

470
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:45,913
watch closely for any movement.

471
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:48,820
I suggest you pick up
Kamal's trail on this end.

472
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,362
No trace. No face.

473
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:51,739
This ought to be easy.

474
00:22:53,557 --> 00:22:54,847
Special Agent Krieger.

475
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:55,927
A word.

476
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:58,231
According to his Interpol bio,

477
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,084
Kamal rarely ventures out of his
safe house once it is established.

478
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:04,906
Style's cloak-and-dagger. Low-tech.
No cell phone, no electronic messages.

479
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,826
- Smart.
- He prefers to pass notes.

480
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:10,211
The Bureau provided several intercepted
by the French 12 years ago, coded.

481
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:12,416
- Abby has them now.
- I don't give a flying crap

482
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,214
what it states in the handbook!

483
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,532
You don't know enough
to make a decision on your own!

484
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,738
That was long overdue.

485
00:23:19,196 --> 00:23:20,700
What have you got against her?

486
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:23,294
I do not like cleaning up
after other people.

487
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:25,774
It is very clear what you
would like to have against her.

488
00:23:26,256 --> 00:23:27,337
Excuse me?

489
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:29,594
You want to sleep with her.

490
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:30,654
I...

491
00:23:31,474 --> 00:23:32,660
Well, so...

492
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:34,888
What if I do?

493
00:23:36,017 --> 00:23:37,213
Same old Tony.

494
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:39,705
I thought the new Tony
wanted something more.

495
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:41,200
A real relationship.

496
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:44,566
I was pretending to be someone else.

497
00:23:44,577 --> 00:23:46,905
Yeah, you could have fooled me.
I thought you had grown.

498
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,955
I'm not particularly
interested in outgrowing sex.

499
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,655
Sure it would be nice, Tony.
But it would be meaningless.

500
00:23:51,656 --> 00:23:53,533
Empty.
It would be wrong for you.

501
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,574
She's a pretty girl,
but she's just a girl.

502
00:23:58,364 --> 00:24:00,598
The man you were becoming needs a woman.

503
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:02,955
At least I thought he did.

504
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:06,838
You believe that?
An e-mail!

505
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,657
<i>Perhaps we're looking at this tattoo
from the wrong angle.</i>

506
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:16,592
I've manipulated the image
every way I can.

507
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,880
I've inverted it. I've shrunk it.
I've stretched it.

508
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:20,020
I can't figure it out.

509
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:22,315
Gonna have to mute you Duck.

510
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:24,981
- Nothing personal.
- <i>No, wait. It's very pecu...</i>

511
00:24:26,308 --> 00:24:27,783
You got something on the tattoo?

512
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:29,177
It's a work in progress, but...

513
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:32,532
I did find out something about the notes
that the FBI got from Kamal.

514
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:35,237
FBI code-breakers couldn't make
anything of the language.

515
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:36,415
No, neither could I.

516
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,213
But the paper the notes are written on,

517
00:24:38,504 --> 00:24:40,992
it has a curve,
so it came off of some sort of spool.

518
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:42,431
Cash register receipt.

519
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:46,573
And Major Mass Spec had
a field day with these smudges,

520
00:24:46,805 --> 00:24:50,336
decided that it's <i>Makki Ki Roti</i>
and <i>Sarson Ka Saag</i>.

521
00:24:51,377 --> 00:24:53,365
Maize-flour bread
and mustard-leaf sauce,

522
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,999
which goes nice with a glass of <i>lassi</i>.

523
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:57,097
Indian food.

524
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:58,730
Punjab, to be specific.

525
00:24:59,016 --> 00:25:00,629
Kamal likes his home cooking.

526
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,976
Might add to his profile.

527
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:04,615
- It's good work.
- Gonna have to mute you.

528
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:06,065
Don't say "good work".

529
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:08,033
Not till I figure out
the riddle of the tattoo.

530
00:25:15,468 --> 00:25:17,099
Ziva, can I ask you a question?

531
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:22,416
Isn't it hard being the only woman
on the team?

532
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:23,278
No.

533
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,394
God, I wish I had your confidence.

534
00:25:28,013 --> 00:25:29,896
Well, it comes from experience.

535
00:25:31,324 --> 00:25:33,465
The way I'm going,
that's something I'll never get.

536
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:35,583
Look, Courtney,

537
00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:40,058
they obviously saw something
valuable in you,

538
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:41,942
otherwise you would not have
made it this far.

539
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,740
Thank you.

540
00:25:43,898 --> 00:25:44,698
But...

541
00:25:45,113 --> 00:25:47,756
stop trying to be perfect.

542
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:51,990
You will mess up. And occasionally,
you will take a beating.

543
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:55,729
- And then what?
- Then, you know the expression

544
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,059
"you get back on the horse"?

545
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,328
I competed in equestrian.

546
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:02,397
Show jumping mostly.

547
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:07,018
My uncle bred Arabians.

548
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:11,144
Do we hug now?

549
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,523
Assuming he still likes home cooking,

550
00:26:13,568 --> 00:26:17,235
there are 15 Indian restaurants within
a ten-mile radius of Highland Beach.

551
00:26:17,236 --> 00:26:18,479
Kamal doesn't travel.

552
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,140
Confine the search to walking distance.

553
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:25,091
There's only one in the vicinity...

554
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:26,763
<i>Punjab Tandoori.</i>

555
00:26:27,357 --> 00:26:29,421
Man's gotta eat.
We know he's been in the area.

556
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:31,417
If he's using the same MO,

557
00:26:31,418 --> 00:26:33,089
passing notes. Who's he handing 'em to?

558
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:35,085
Any chance he's got people
from the old country

559
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:36,337
workin' on this side?

560
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:38,953
Makes that restaurant the perfect place
to hang out if he does.

561
00:26:38,971 --> 00:26:40,831
Slim chance he'd be
at the restaurant himself.

562
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,119
Let's keep this one low-key
when we go to scope it out.

563
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:44,768
Have to go in undercover.

564
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,129
Hi. Table for two, please.

565
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:49,507
Right this way.

566
00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:51,598
Looks like a nice place,
doesn't it, honey?

567
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:53,354
Sure does, sweet cheeks.

568
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:55,208
Hold it steady, I'm gonna zoom in here.

569
00:26:57,556 --> 00:26:58,971
On the waiter, DiNozzo.

570
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:01,499
Our specials this evening are the...

571
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:02,674
<i>Masala Chops</i>

572
00:27:02,808 --> 00:27:04,062
and the <i>Lobia Curry.</i>

573
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:06,650
- The <i>Lobia</i> is my personal favorite.
- And freeze.

574
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:08,151
<i>Here are the menus,</i>

575
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:11,531
- <i>I'll be right back to take your order.</i>
- Facial ID should take a second here.

576
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:13,046
Unless he has been erased.

577
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,134
Ashwin Romji.

578
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:18,101
Married, father of three.

579
00:27:18,217 --> 00:27:22,142
Resident since 1987,
legal citizen since 1999.

580
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,492
Seems clean. Courtney, can you get
an angle on the kitchen staff.

581
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:29,334
She looks tense.
Think maybe it should be you in there?

582
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:31,339
I think she'll do fine.

583
00:27:35,745 --> 00:27:38,133
Act natural.
Just a normal date.

584
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:41,809
Can I tell you a secret?

585
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:44,662
It's been a while.

586
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,531
<i>Yeah.
Me, too.</i>

587
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:50,963
Work comes first.

588
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:53,408
Just pretend you like me.

589
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:55,710
It's not too hard to do.

590
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,130
<i>You have really soft hands.</i>

591
00:28:02,156 --> 00:28:03,310
How is it going, Tony?

592
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:07,478
- I'm so sorry.
- You know, I...

593
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:09,073
It's okay.

594
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:11,047
Good thing we didn't put
the mic in his pants.

595
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,039
I'm just gonna go clean this up.

596
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:19,654
Not quite how I remember dating.

597
00:28:20,803 --> 00:28:22,429
<i>Feels about par for the course.</i>

598
00:28:25,793 --> 00:28:27,200
Sorry. Sorry, man.

599
00:28:27,316 --> 00:28:28,319
Excuse me.

600
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:30,677
Didn't get a good look
at the delivery boy.

601
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:35,684
- <i>Well, looks like they keep him busy.</i>
- Maybe Kamal gets take-out.

602
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:37,550
Cross-checking the addresses.

603
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:46,023
<i>Can I help you, sir?</i>

604
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:48,818
Yeah.

605
00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:51,849
Can we get our food to go?

606
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,491
Because my girlfriend and...

607
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:57,165
I understand.

608
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,864
It's very naughty.

609
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:05,668
Stop. Third on the list.

610
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,508
It's a rented apartment.

611
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,804
Look at the name on the lease, McGee.

612
00:29:14,482 --> 00:29:16,507
- Yeah. I see him.
- <i>Check the delivery boy.</i>

613
00:29:17,663 --> 00:29:20,593
Regular dinner delivery
to a Frederick LeClair.

614
00:29:20,702 --> 00:29:22,425
That's a name
our dead guy's used before.

615
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,670
Dead guys don't eat.

616
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:26,143
So who's using it now?

617
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:42,629
We can't be this lucky.

618
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:46,481
Let him make the drop first, Ziva.

619
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:47,862
<i>Yes, Gibbs. Standing by.</i>

620
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:50,017
- Okay, take him.
- <i>Moving in.</i>

621
00:29:58,018 --> 00:29:59,771
I was wondering if you could help us.

622
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:01,179
I'm a bit lost.

623
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:02,650
Where are you...

624
00:30:04,695 --> 00:30:05,695
What the...

625
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,885
What the hell's going on?

626
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:21,444
Just dinner.

627
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,114
The door?

628
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,238
Allow me.

629
00:30:34,226 --> 00:30:35,026
Clear.

630
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,660
Clear.

631
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:39,582
Nobody here.

632
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:41,799
This is Kamal's place.

633
00:30:42,197 --> 00:30:43,314
Yeah, or it was.

634
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,651
Can't have gone far.

635
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:48,947
Where's the guy who lives here?

636
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,863
How would I know?
I just deliver the food.

637
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:52,560
How's he going to eat if he's not home?

638
00:30:52,698 --> 00:30:54,211
It's a standing dinner order.

639
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:57,537
I drop off his meal every afternoon,
and he pays two weeks in advance.

640
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:00,109
- So you've seen him?
- Yeah.

641
00:31:00,536 --> 00:31:01,336
Once.

642
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:03,913
Gave me a big wad of cash
and a good tip.

643
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:05,829
Can you describe him?

644
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:07,758
Okay, I guess.

645
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:10,681
Older black guy,

646
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,051
about my height, maybe a little taller.

647
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:14,786
What about this guy you seen him before?

648
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:16,889
Is this a trick question?

649
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:19,889
That is the guy who lives here.

650
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,311
Frederick LeClair.

651
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:23,455
Marvin Hinton.

652
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:24,772
Kamal Konkani.

653
00:31:25,055 --> 00:31:26,425
Our dead guy's our bad guy.

654
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:27,906
Then who killed him?

655
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:37,815
Robert Graves.

656
00:31:38,472 --> 00:31:39,610
25 years old.

657
00:31:39,994 --> 00:31:41,854
No aliases, no priors.

658
00:31:41,855 --> 00:31:42,984
No passport.

659
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:45,982
According to his W4, he's been working
at the restaurant six months.

660
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:47,813
If you believe everything on paper.

661
00:31:50,837 --> 00:31:52,487
How much longer are we going to do this?

662
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:53,886
Anxious to get out?

663
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:56,394
Wasn't planning on spending the night
in custody.

664
00:31:56,578 --> 00:31:58,044
I have a term paper due tomorrow.

665
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:00,653
Grad student in electrical engineering.

666
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,804
Solid B-minus average.

667
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,702
<i>You grew up in Hagerstown.</i>

668
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:08,509
Nice neighborhood?

669
00:32:09,956 --> 00:32:11,636
My parents were working class.

670
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,810
I've had jobs since I was 13 and...

671
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,033
I've had to work twice as hard
as the silver spoons to get where I am.

672
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:18,830
The delivery boy.

673
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:21,320
What did I do wrong?

674
00:32:21,624 --> 00:32:23,133
Was there something in the package?

675
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,541
Drugs?

676
00:32:32,236 --> 00:32:34,165
He could still be a courier
and not know it.

677
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:36,636
He delivers information into go-boxes.

678
00:32:37,012 --> 00:32:38,941
Returns with cash
that contains the reply.

679
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:41,745
And someone else at the restaurant
sends on instructions

680
00:32:41,825 --> 00:32:43,116
to prospective clients,

681
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:44,638
tucked in a meal.

682
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,288
It doesn't matter how he did it.

683
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:49,219
Hinton played you.

684
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:53,313
He was The Eraser all along.

685
00:32:55,235 --> 00:32:56,603
Hinton was Kamal...

686
00:32:57,915 --> 00:32:59,647
that explains
his so-called retirement.

687
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:01,876
- He was in prison.
- Spending his time improving

688
00:33:01,956 --> 00:33:03,962
the technique for eliminating
a person's history.

689
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:07,994
- Which means.
- He was testing it on himself.

690
00:33:08,873 --> 00:33:11,064
- So, why...
- Let himself be caught

691
00:33:11,219 --> 00:33:12,550
on the trafficking charge?

692
00:33:14,274 --> 00:33:16,011
- And who...
- Killed him?

693
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:18,210
That... was clearly not part
of the plan.

694
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:20,942
We were working under the assumption
The Eraser killed his client

695
00:33:21,022 --> 00:33:22,400
to cover his tracks.

696
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,662
What if it was the other way around?

697
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:26,896
The Eraser was killed
by one of his clients?

698
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:29,121
Terrorists?

699
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:30,852
We don't know
if they've arrived yet.

700
00:33:30,913 --> 00:33:32,053
Another client, then.

701
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:36,444
Someone... with a past
they needed to forget.

702
00:33:36,793 --> 00:33:38,672
And once the client's past
had been erased,

703
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,898
he kills Kamal.

704
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:42,791
To eliminate the only person
who knows his true identity.

705
00:33:43,344 --> 00:33:44,344
Almost.

706
00:33:44,657 --> 00:33:46,295
Not a him, a her.

707
00:33:46,468 --> 00:33:48,593
- One of his girlfriends...
- Was actually a client.

708
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:49,698
Cute.

709
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,288
She was erased,

710
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:53,417
- so we don't know anything about her.
- Wrong.

711
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,645
We do know how she kills.

712
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,731
Where is Dr. Mallard?

713
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:06,347
With our forensic scientist.

714
00:34:06,973 --> 00:34:09,693
I don't think he's ready
to release the body, though.

715
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,277
He really gets into his work.

716
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:14,100
Yeah, he's turned himself inside out

717
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:16,566
trying to unscramble the meaning
behind this tattoo.

718
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:19,944
Dr. Mallard hates to leave
anything unfinished.

719
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:21,466
Yeah.

720
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:23,589
Me, too.

721
00:34:37,937 --> 00:34:38,937
Dr. Hampton?

722
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:41,236
What are you doing?

723
00:34:41,237 --> 00:34:44,131
I would never cut into your body
without your permission, but...

724
00:34:44,556 --> 00:34:46,948
I would appreciate the opportunity to...

725
00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:48,990
perhaps level the scales.

726
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:51,481
Of course.

727
00:34:51,482 --> 00:34:53,004
You could have come into my lab

728
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:55,387
flapping and quacking about miracles
I failed to weave.

729
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,841
I assure you that's not in my character.

730
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,837
Shall we...

731
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,367
do this together?

732
00:35:05,768 --> 00:35:08,127
I could only hope
that this makes us even.

733
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:11,684
I might even owe you one...

734
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:15,879
Doctor.

735
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,452
The girls have a theory.

736
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,596
The murder does not have
anything to do with terrorism.

737
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,732
It's one of The Eraser's other clients.

738
00:35:24,928 --> 00:35:27,021
So the killer could be anyone
from anywhere?

739
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,792
We have been sifting
through instances involving mercury.

740
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:31,635
Did not find similar murder, but...

741
00:35:32,175 --> 00:35:33,832
Idaho. Three years ago.

742
00:35:33,912 --> 00:35:37,012
George Barney dies in his sleep
after having a few too many drinks.

743
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,621
Choked to death on his own vomit.

744
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:40,565
He's buried on his family farm.

745
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:42,869
Last month, the Barneys are digging
a new well.

746
00:35:42,984 --> 00:35:45,142
It turns out, the groundwater
had been contaminated.

747
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,687
EPA was called in,

748
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:49,143
traced the source
of the contamination back to a leak

749
00:35:49,144 --> 00:35:50,461
in George Barney's casket.

750
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:51,821
Mercury.

751
00:35:52,189 --> 00:35:54,871
His young widow had been
the high school science teacher.

752
00:35:54,977 --> 00:35:56,009
She moved on

753
00:35:56,075 --> 00:35:57,363
after his untimely death.

754
00:35:57,518 --> 00:35:59,161
Local cops couldn't track her down.

755
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:00,482
She killed her husband.

756
00:36:00,885 --> 00:36:02,640
Here's a picture of the grieving wife.

757
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,050
Look familiar?

758
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:19,125
Do you need me to identify
another photo?

759
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:22,556
Recognize this person?

760
00:36:25,578 --> 00:36:28,066
Her hair matches one
of the samples from Hinton's condo.

761
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:30,511
- And the murder has her signature.
- <i>All right, look.</i>

762
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:32,494
It was a tragedy when my husband died.

763
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,396
The entire town thought so.

764
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:38,572
Doesn't sound like
you share their sentiments.

765
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:42,176
They didn't know what he was like
when he was drunk,

766
00:36:42,712 --> 00:36:44,056
which was all the time.

767
00:36:44,486 --> 00:36:47,459
So when the opportunity presented itself
to start a new life,

768
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:48,942
you took it.

769
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:50,854
Wouldn't you?

770
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,277
How did Marvin Hinton know
you were on the run?

771
00:36:58,028 --> 00:36:59,935
<i>He knew everything about me
in one look,</i>

772
00:37:00,602 --> 00:37:01,846
<i>everything that matters.</i>

773
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:04,887
He knew how I'd gotten my new name.

774
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:08,187
He said he'd been contacted
the same way.

775
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:10,941
So you went home with him?

776
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,920
Did it occur to you

777
00:37:13,384 --> 00:37:15,533
that he was the one
who set up your new identity?

778
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:16,925
That he was toying with you?

779
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,565
'Cause he was the only one
who knew about your past.

780
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:21,734
Right?

781
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:25,700
I didn't kill him.

782
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:30,668
I suppose it wouldn't be any fun
if she just admitted it.

783
00:37:31,348 --> 00:37:32,348
Yes, sir.

784
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:34,112
Delivery boy still here?

785
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:35,781
Waiting in the conference room.

786
00:37:35,782 --> 00:37:37,027
Make sure he gets home.

787
00:37:38,027 --> 00:37:39,184
Special Agent Krieger.

788
00:37:42,332 --> 00:37:43,332
Nice work today.

789
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,665
She killed once for a new life.

790
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:54,748
Why not twice?

791
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:56,491
Did us a favor... Kamal is dead.

792
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,261
It doesn't seem to bother
his international clients.

793
00:38:00,262 --> 00:38:01,401
The terrorist training camp?

794
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:02,963
Marine task force just went in.

795
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:04,155
And?

796
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,278
One terrorist killed.

797
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:07,367
They found an American passport
on his body.

798
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,752
It went through squeaky clean.

799
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,516
Kamal had completed the job.

800
00:38:10,517 --> 00:38:11,945
What about the rest of the cell?

801
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:13,939
Too late.
Already gone.

802
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,133
They're on their way here.

803
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:17,866
And the only man who knows
who they are is past telling us.

804
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:19,891
That's not certain, Tony.

805
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:23,052
Our dead man may have
one thing left to say.

806
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:27,576
We cracked it, Gibbs, me and Ducky.

807
00:38:27,577 --> 00:38:29,765
We solved the puzzle.
We were just looking at it wrong.

808
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,193
Yeah, it was Jordan...

809
00:38:33,212 --> 00:38:34,292
Dr. Hampton

810
00:38:34,426 --> 00:38:38,177
who had the idea of excising
the section of inked flesh.

811
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:39,611
That is so gross.

812
00:38:39,691 --> 00:38:41,522
But what we found is so cool.

813
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:43,996
The blotchy thick,
blue jailhouse dye...

814
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,640
that's just a camouflage.

815
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,768
Yes, the real clue is underneath,

816
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:50,895
hidden like a painted-over Monet canvas.

817
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:54,621
All I had to do was eliminate
the blue to clarify it.

818
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:56,829
This...

819
00:38:58,013 --> 00:38:59,537
is the original tattoo.

820
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,650
It's beautiful, with deeper needling.

821
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,020
Professional work.

822
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:08,101
It's a masterpiece,
it's a Blaine Parker.

823
00:39:08,294 --> 00:39:10,339
He's something of a legend,
Boston artist.

824
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:12,877
A man like Hinton trying
to shed his past...

825
00:39:12,878 --> 00:39:14,330
So I talked to Parker's assistant,

826
00:39:14,331 --> 00:39:16,617
and she was able to determine
the exact dates

827
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:18,353
when Hinton got the original tattoo.

828
00:39:18,678 --> 00:39:20,658
Over a period of several days,

829
00:39:21,217 --> 00:39:22,414
ten years ago.

830
00:39:23,046 --> 00:39:25,650
Interpol's timeline, puts Kamal
in London ten years ago.

831
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:27,038
Hinton's not Kamal.

832
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,803
Delivery boy lied to us.

833
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:32,062
He did more than that, he set us up.
He wanted us to believe it was Hinton.

834
00:39:32,276 --> 00:39:33,625
You think the kid's Kamal?

835
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:35,866
He'd have had to start
when he was 8years old.

836
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:37,275
Not if he's the new

837
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:39,376
Dread Pirate Roberts.

838
00:39:39,565 --> 00:39:40,829
I love <i>The Princess Bride.</i>

839
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,419
No one would ever surrender
to the Dread Pirate Westley.

840
00:39:49,246 --> 00:39:51,764
The Dread Pirate Roberts
picks a successor,

841
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:54,696
then trains him,
starts calling him Roberts and then

842
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,329
settles into a cushy retirement.

843
00:39:57,665 --> 00:39:59,865
It's the name "Kamal"
that sells the business.

844
00:40:01,797 --> 00:40:03,144
You can let me off up here.

845
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:14,374
Sorry for the inconvenience.

846
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,973
Just a case of mistaken identity.

847
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:19,078
- Good luck on your term paper.
- Thanks.

848
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,448
<i>Ziva, where are you?</i>

849
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:23,912
Dropping off Graves, Gibbs.

850
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:25,003
<i>Don't!</i>

851
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:42,111
Can we hug now?

852
00:40:53,113 --> 00:40:54,212
From your closet.

853
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:57,994
Special delivery.

854
00:41:00,516 --> 00:41:01,621
How'd you find Kamal?

855
00:41:03,013 --> 00:41:04,118
You don't find Kamal.

856
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:05,696
Kamal finds you.

857
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:08,247
He tempts you with the money
or the power?

858
00:41:08,691 --> 00:41:10,574
Or just the chance to become
somebody else?

859
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:12,683
Kamal could tell you needed him.

860
00:41:14,326 --> 00:41:15,326
He needed me.

861
00:41:16,365 --> 00:41:18,738
He can't even work his own computer.
Man's a dinosaur.

862
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:21,127
He knows how to read people.

863
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,359
Cover his tracks.

864
00:41:23,728 --> 00:41:25,220
But you don't have the discipline.

865
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:27,684
Hinton figured you out.

866
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,209
He would've led the FBI right to you.

867
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,366
So you killed him
before he got the chance.

868
00:41:33,401 --> 00:41:34,822
Made us think he was Kamal.

869
00:41:35,521 --> 00:41:37,836
Then you framed another client
for his murder.

870
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:40,905
Shannon O'Hara, aka Karen Barney.

871
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,705
You knew how she'd killed in the past.
She was your first client.

872
00:41:47,134 --> 00:41:48,134
Good for you.

873
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:50,797
You've got the whole story.

874
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,895
The worst mistake you made...

875
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:58,128
You tried to shoot our agents.

876
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:04,344
Hey, let me hang that up
for you, Tobias.

877
00:42:09,139 --> 00:42:10,139
Sit down!

878
00:42:15,084 --> 00:42:17,166
- What do you want?
- The rest of your client list.

879
00:42:17,608 --> 00:42:19,421
Tell us where to find the real Kamal!

880
00:42:20,843 --> 00:42:21,643
Now!

881
00:42:28,126 --> 00:42:29,647
I was at an embassy party once...

882
00:42:30,043 --> 00:42:32,599
gated, razor wire, surveillance system,
the whole deal

883
00:42:32,994 --> 00:42:35,675
and this guy just walks
in the front door, wearing T-shirt

884
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,216
that says "Liquor Store."

885
00:42:37,466 --> 00:42:38,836
Holds up a brown paper bag,

886
00:42:39,492 --> 00:42:40,492
and he goes

887
00:42:40,707 --> 00:42:43,254
"Did anybody order a bottle of vodka?"

888
00:42:44,717 --> 00:42:46,878
The places you can access
when you look the part.

889
00:42:47,919 --> 00:42:50,368
- This thing starts kind of slow.
- I'm sure it gets better.

890
00:42:52,026 --> 00:42:53,236
The picture's up, boss.

891
00:42:54,521 --> 00:42:56,140
An NCIS production.

892
00:42:56,768 --> 00:42:58,715
Brought to you by Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

893
00:42:59,515 --> 00:43:01,452
Starring, as usual, the FBI,

894
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,672
and the elusive Kamal Konkani.

895
00:43:04,968 --> 00:43:05,968
Freeze it.

896
00:43:07,928 --> 00:43:10,042
The Dread Pirate Roberts, I presume.

897
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,704
Did you get her number?

898
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:14,792
Who, Courtney? No.

899
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:17,847
I did.

900
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,610
She wants to learn how to fight.

901
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:37,398
