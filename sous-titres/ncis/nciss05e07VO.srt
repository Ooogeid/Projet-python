00:01:50,182 --> 00:01:51,610
Don't do this to me, boss.

3
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:53,591
Come on, don't do this to me.

4
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:55,932
Don't make me kiss you, boss.

5
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:07,556
Come on, boss!

6
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:08,861
Come on!

7
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,108
Boss, come on.

12
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:17,937
No.

13
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,111
- Please, please, please, Gibbs.
- No.

14
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:21,744
Okay,

15
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,666
I'll never ask you for
anything again, ever.

16
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:25,025
- Abby...
- I promise.

17
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,332
Come on, ever?

18
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:27,734
Well, okay, maybe not ever,

19
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:30,420
but I won't ask for anything else for
at least like...

20
00:03:30,863 --> 00:03:31,877
a week.

21
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:33,809
Sure. Where and when?

22
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,417
Here and now.

23
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:37,115
Boss...

24
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:39,828
There is a young women
here waiting to see you.

25
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:41,127
I sent her to the lounge.

26
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:42,438
- Name?
- Maddie Tyler?

27
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,599
About?

28
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:45,151
Twenty-two, twenty-three.

29
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:48,811
Sorry.
Personal.

30
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:49,970
She wouldn't say.

31
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:51,310
Gibbs!

32
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:57,264
It's for my cell phone,
so when Gibbs calls,

33
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:58,602
his face will appear,

34
00:03:58,649 --> 00:03:59,964
and I'll know it's him. See?

35
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:02,876
Nice... print.

36
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:15,231
Hi.

37
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:17,917
Special Agent Gibbs.

38
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:19,837
I know.

39
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:21,959
I- I mean, I remember.

40
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:25,108
But you...

41
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,750
probably don't.
I'm...

42
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:27,887
Maddie.

43
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:28,989
Maddie Tyler.

44
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:31,718
It's been a long time.

45
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:34,735
I used to come over to your house.

46
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,178
I was Kelly's best friend.

47
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,362
Or, I mean, at least I remember myself

48
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,845
being her best friend.

49
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:46,594
I like to think she thought so, too.

50
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:48,873
You lived on base?

51
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:50,172
Marine brat.

52
00:04:50,362 --> 00:04:51,494
My dad was an Officer.

53
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,002
I remember.

54
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:56,569
A good man.

55
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:58,926
He retired.

56
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:00,203
Moved back to Oakland.

57
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:01,934
Died a couple years ago.

58
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:06,535
I'm finishing my degree at Georgetown.

59
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:07,681
Science.

60
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:10,068
I guess you're

61
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:11,358
wondering...

62
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:12,480
why I'm here.

63
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,773
This is going to sound so stupid.

64
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:15,922
I can't believe,

65
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:19,209
I need some help,

66
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:22,046
and you're the only person I know

67
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:23,879
who...

68
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,890
Problems?

69
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:26,547
Guy problems.

70
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:29,272
Crazy guy problems.

71
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:31,757
I went on a couple dates with him,

72
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:33,552
about 18 months ago.

73
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:34,963
He's a Marine.

74
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:36,774
Went to Iraq.

75
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:38,476
Just got back a week ago.

76
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:41,089
He came to see me, you know, wanted

77
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:42,780
to get things started again.

78
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:45,925
But I mean, there was...

79
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,201
there was nothing to start because
nothing had ever gotten started.

80
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:51,004
I tried to explain that, but,

81
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:52,870
kept insisting.

82
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:54,134
He was

83
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,943
desperate to move in with me,

84
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:58,109
and, when I said no,

85
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:01,867
it wasn't what he wanted to hear.

86
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,013
He stalking you?

87
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:05,873
Did you report him to the police?

88
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:07,552
They said there's nothing they can do.

89
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,931
It's only been a week.

90
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:10,018
He threaten you?

91
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:12,198
He hurt you?

92
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,047
I don't think he meant to.

93
00:06:17,563 --> 00:06:19,105
He just kind of grabbed me, but...

94
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,712
He's really freaking me out.

95
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:22,782
What's this Marine's name?

96
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:24,056
Rudi Haas.

97
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,274
Where would I find him?

98
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:26,881
Outside my house.

99
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,505
Cute!

100
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,098
Pretty!

101
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:40,174
Tony.

102
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:42,157
That's the best yet.

103
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:43,059
Boss!

104
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,412
I didn't know you were...

105
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:50,409
Sorry, Gibbs.

106
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:58,270
We need to talk about the latest East
African threat assessments.

107
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:05,944
When you've got a moment.

108
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,894
Know her?

109
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:13,085
Wish I could say I did.

110
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:14,160
Maddie Tyler.

111
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:15,570
- Who is?
- Ask McGee.

112
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:17,355
- Said it was personal.
- New girlfriend?

113
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:19,165
Too young.
Not a redhead.

114
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:20,195
Niece?

115
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:22,216
Nice. McGeek called McGoogle,

116
00:07:22,378 --> 00:07:23,483
her name.

117
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:24,779
I can do you one better.

118
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:25,892
MySpace.

119
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:31,155
Well,
she has an eclectic taste in music.

120
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:33,588
Everything from Yo-Yo Ma to Metallica.

121
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,667
Lots of friends, college kids mainly.

122
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:38,270
And one from her childhood.

123
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:41,008
"My first and still my best friend,
Kelly.

124
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,587
Forever in my memory."

125
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:45,516
Gibbs' daughter was named Kelly.

126
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:46,846
One and the same.

127
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:48,872
Mystery solved.

128
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,074
That's his car.

129
00:08:11,505 --> 00:08:13,608
Hey, Madds,
I was just looking for you, babe.

130
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:14,669
Look. Hey...

131
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:15,674
Hey!

132
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:18,053
Who are you?!

133
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:19,419
This your old man?!

134
00:08:20,405 --> 00:08:22,321
She does not want to see you.

135
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:24,343
It means you're not going to come back.

136
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:25,907
You're not going to call her.

137
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:28,637
You're not going to drive
down her street.

138
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,456
Do I need to say it again?

139
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,282
No.

140
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:59,103
OK. It's around here somewhe.

141
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:00,667
Do you want some more coffee?

142
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:04,631
Nope.
Fine.

143
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:08,324
As soon as I graduate,
I am moving back to Oakland.

144
00:09:08,444 --> 00:09:10,209
This place is such a pig sty.

145
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:12,813
There's this really great
animal hospital there.

146
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,332
They offered me a job in the lab.

147
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:18,136
It's just a general practice.

148
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:21,119
Eventually, I have plan
to specialize in horses.

149
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,433
Kelly and I were
both crazy about horses.

150
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:25,780
Here it is.

151
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:30,136
Can't remember who took that photo.

152
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:49,417
I did.

153
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:52,892
I never did find out what was so funny.

154
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,424
She never told you?

155
00:09:58,901 --> 00:09:59,708
Sorry.

156
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:03,005
I shipped out to Iraq that month.

157
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:05,874
They followed me all
the way to Pendleton.

158
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:08,677
Last time I saw them.

159
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:12,956
It was a time capsule.

160
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,730
We've filled this

161
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,130
toy suitcase with all of our...

162
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,363
treasures.

163
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,555
Kelly's mostly,

164
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,406
and...

165
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,374
buried it in your backyard.

166
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,098
We were sitting on it.

167
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:36,064
I never stopped crying.

168
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:41,578
Still think about her,
after all these years.

169
00:10:43,763 --> 00:10:45,041
Wonder what she'd be like.

170
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,088
Like you.

171
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:57,713
Here, you should.

172
00:10:58,494 --> 00:10:59,608
You should have this.

173
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,123
No. No, that's your memory.

174
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:03,546
Our memory.

175
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:12,383
I should be going.

176
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:13,994
Thanks for the coffee.

177
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:17,115
That bad?

178
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:20,939
I really can't thank you enough.

179
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:24,035
You got my number.
He comes back...

180
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:25,511
call me.

181
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:32,002
And you keep this locked.

182
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:40,365
<i>I just...</i>

183
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:42,252
<i>I- I gotta go.</i>

184
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:50,256
Marine Sergeant Rudi M. Haas.

185
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,549
Works in logistics,
currently on a 30-day

186
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:55,181
leave after returning from Iraq
eight days ago.

187
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:56,672
- Service record?
- Clean.

188
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:57,771
Eight years in.

189
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:59,330
Prior to that, grew up in Chicago.

190
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,386
State and local police.
See if he's got a record.

191
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,600
Why do we need to know?

192
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,696
Are we opening an investigation
into Sergeant Haas?

193
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:07,069
Background check.

194
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,100
On what grounds?

195
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:09,185
Stalking.

196
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,103
The young woman
that was in this afternoon?

197
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:13,843
Did she file a complaint?

198
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:14,796
No.

199
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:18,991
Is this personal, Jethro?

200
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:21,873
If you're asking do I know her,
the answer is yes.

201
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,050
Is it personal?

202
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:25,225
No.

203
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:33,720
Do it.

204
00:12:36,897 --> 00:12:37,917
She knew.

205
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:39,169
Reads Gibbs like a book.

206
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,621
Short read, not a lot of dialogue.

207
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:41,628
Your kind of book.

208
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:42,999
You suggesting I don't read?

209
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,625
I think she's suggesting
you only look at the pictures, Tony.

210
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,478
A picture paints a thousand words,
McGee.

211
00:12:47,515 --> 00:12:50,529
And in your case, most are the names
of female body parts.

212
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,120
I'll have you know that since 1981,

213
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:56,162
I've been a loyal subscriber
to National Geographic magazine.

214
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:59,087
That's some serious
picture-gazing right there.

215
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,231
So how did she know?

216
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,599
Woman's intuition.

217
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,730
Do you have that?

218
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:04,435
Forget I asked that question.

219
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:07,547
The Director could see
Gibbs was preoccupied with something,

220
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,816
and she saw him with the girl.

221
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:12,065
Sounds more like male logic
than woman's intuition.

222
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,888
Either way,
I think she's worried about him.

223
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:15,205
Question is, should we be?

224
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:05,115
<i>Hush, little baby, don't say a word.</i>

225
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:08,895
<i>Papa's gonna buy you a mocking bird.</i>

226
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:09,989
Pony!<i></i>

227
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:31,842
<i>And if that mocking bird don't sing.</i>

228
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:35,298
<i>Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.</i>

229
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:38,692
<i>If that diamond ring turns brass.</i>

230
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:42,017
<i>Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass.</i>

231
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:57,286
<i>Don't go daddy, please don't go.</i>

232
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:05,879
<i>If that cart and bull break down,</i>

233
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:08,058
<i>you're still the prettiest...</i>

234
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:10,595
<i>little baby in town.</i>

235
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:17,952
Yeah. Gibbs.

236
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:19,341
<i>Jethro, he's back!</i>

237
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,274
- No!
- Get in the car!

238
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:39,826
Let go of me!

239
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:40,833
Get in the car!

240
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:42,696
- Shut up and get in!
- No! Somebody help!

241
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:44,459
<i>Help me!</i>

242
00:15:58,616 --> 00:15:59,621
DiNozzo!

243
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:01,125
BOLO's out on Haas's car.

244
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,039
His photograph and details
are on their way to Metro Police.

245
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:05,129
Need her photo, too.

246
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:06,282
Abby's got one.

247
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,915
From when she was trying to take yours,

248
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:11,069
earlier. Ziva, you want to call Abby.

249
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:12,436
Haas's current address.

250
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,767
Assigned to Quantico
as an enlisted trainer,

251
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:17,540
but he hasn't reported in there
since he got back from Iraq.

252
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,952
Got to be staying somewhere.

253
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:20,631
No known relatives in the DC area.

254
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:21,707
Friends then.

255
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:23,886
I want the address
of every place he's ever lived.

256
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,538
I'm working on it, boss.

257
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:27,553
Her cell phone?

258
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:28,759
- Switched off.
- His?

259
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:31,582
Also switched off, I'm trying
to access his recent calls now.

260
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:32,664
And?

261
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:35,679
And I've...
well, I've only just started.

262
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,936
You were going to brief me,
weren't you?

263
00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:41,226
She called me.

264
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:43,615
I got there, place was trashed.

265
00:16:44,406 --> 00:16:46,468
Saw her being pushed into Haas's SUV.

266
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:47,563
You identified him?

267
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:49,016
I identified his car.

268
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:51,869
So you didn't actually see

269
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:53,769
Sergeant Haas abducting her?

270
00:16:54,203 --> 00:16:55,559
Maybe it was someone else?

271
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,252
Well, it must have been Haas driving.

272
00:16:57,386 --> 00:16:59,078
Could have been driving.

273
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:01,531
Best guess.

274
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,443
What else do we know about him?

275
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,729
Haas turned down Uncle Sam's
offer to reenlist last month.

276
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:08,756
In 60 days, he'll be a former Marine.

277
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:10,023
Last deployment?

278
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:13,361
Logistics, worked out of the Green Zone
in Baghdad.

279
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:14,918
Everything Marine going to or

280
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,020
coming from Iraq
channeled through his department.

281
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,107
Desk jockey.

282
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,701
Got his phone records.

283
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:23,125
Moderate usage.

284
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:24,272
Recurring numbers?

285
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:25,392
There's a few.

286
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:27,505
15 calls in the last eight days

287
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,702
to a landline in the name
of Maddie Tyler.

288
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:31,393
Others?

289
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:33,971
Five incoming from a company here in DC.

290
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:36,369
It's the first call he received
when he got back from Iraq,

291
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:38,917
and the last call he got before
he switched off his phone.

292
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:41,199
"Bordais Security Solutions."

293
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:42,737
BSS,

294
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:44,503
a small sized security firm.

295
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,788
With a contract in Iraq, Marine today,
mercenary tomorrow.

296
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:49,589
Filthy rich the day after.

297
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:51,167
Looks like Haas was being headhunted.

298
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,472
I need a name, McGee.

299
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:55,950
CEO is a retired Army Major,
Max Bordais.

300
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,315
Ours is a small company,

301
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:00,689
Agent Gibbs. Less than 100 employees,

302
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:02,778
the majority of whom were in Iraq.

303
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:04,189
Doing what?

304
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:07,062
Protection details for various VIPs.

305
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:08,552
Haas doesn't seem like

306
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,200
the highly trained
soldier your company would hire.

307
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:12,383
He's a paper pusher.

308
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:13,921
And from what I've been told,

309
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:15,573
no one pushes paper better.

310
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:17,060
Signed him up?

311
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,376
Made him a generous offer.

312
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:19,964
- And?
- He passed.

313
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:21,831
- He say why?
- No.

314
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:24,894
Evidently a thousand dollars a day
wasn't enough.

315
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:27,146
A lot of money for a clerk.

316
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,379
I guess he didn't need the money.

317
00:18:30,647 --> 00:18:31,487
Look,

318
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:33,094
I did my homework.

319
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:36,043
Haas is considered one of the best
logistics people in Iraq.

320
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:37,474
You want it, he'll find it.

321
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,018
"You can't get it through channels,
you get it through Haas."

322
00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:41,434
That's what they say about him.

323
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:42,695
A guy like that

324
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:45,009
is worth a dozen of my highly
trained soldiers.

325
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:46,035
Where is he?

326
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:47,073
I don't know.

327
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:48,523
You're lying.

328
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:50,266
I only have his cell phone number.

329
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,581
Am I under arrest?

330
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,334
No.

331
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:01,594
Where is he?

332
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:02,709
Agent Gibbs...

333
00:19:06,116 --> 00:19:07,632
I only talked to him

334
00:19:07,678 --> 00:19:08,919
on the phone.

335
00:19:09,402 --> 00:19:10,790
He didn't want to meet me.

336
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:12,385
He made it clear

337
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:14,397
he wasn't looking for a job.

338
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,211
Now,

339
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,545
if you're not going to arrest me,

340
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,856
I'm walking out of here.

341
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:39,692
Nicely handled, Jethro.

342
00:19:41,187 --> 00:19:42,187
You're right.

343
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:43,984
He's holding something back.

344
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:46,714
Then again,
he's not the only one, is he?

345
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,022
You said you knew her.

346
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:49,237
Family friend.

347
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,294
- When?
- Long time ago.

348
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:53,694
- How long? Five years, ten years?
- Fifteen.

349
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:58,161
Are we done here?

350
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:10,392
I e-mailed Maddie's photo to state
and local police.

351
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:12,597
I printed you one, too.

352
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:14,886
Of course, I cropped you out
of the one that I e-mailed.

353
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:18,251
I just thought that maybe you
would want a copy of the original.

354
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:21,368
She was Kelly's friend, wasn't she?

355
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:27,265
We're going to find her, Gibbs.

356
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:28,482
I know it.

357
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:30,955
<i>Boss, you might want to see this.</i>

358
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:32,970
McGee got something.

359
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:34,716
I plotted all the cell phone calls

360
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:36,899
Haas received
or made in the last eight days.

361
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:39,598
Most were made from his car
as he was driving.

362
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:41,920
The signal passed
from tower to tower, which

363
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:43,984
doesn't help us, but three of the calls

364
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:47,499
were made from the same location,
using the same tower each time.

365
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:49,457
Now given the range and signal strength,

366
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:51,941
they could only have been
made from this four-block radius.

367
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:53,123
A lot of real estate,

368
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:54,856
Until you add what I found.

369
00:20:55,193 --> 00:20:56,727
Only job Haas ever had in DC

370
00:20:56,737 --> 00:20:58,810
was in the six months before
he joined the Marines.

371
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,949
He worked as a night watchman
at a clothing factory, lived on-site.

372
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:03,928
The factory closed three years ago.

373
00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:05,360
Puts him right in the zone.

374
00:21:31,153 --> 00:21:32,286
Hear that?

375
00:21:37,073 --> 00:21:38,060
Flies.

376
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,088
Guess we found Haas.

377
00:22:18,992 --> 00:22:21,092
Not quite a stairway to heaven.

378
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:24,397
Perhaps an elevator
to a less compelling place.

379
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:27,154
This is he, I take it?

380
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,249
Yup.

381
00:22:28,364 --> 00:22:29,458
Rudi Haas.

382
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:31,946
Yes, well,
when we're confronted with crucifixion,

383
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:33,431
we immediately think of the Romans,

384
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:35,316
but it was used as a form of execution

385
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:38,017
long before them
by the Egyptians and the Greeks,

386
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:40,255
and after them, by the Persians,

387
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,775
and then, of course,

388
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:43,430
- the Japanese.
- Duck,

389
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:44,712
I don't got a whole
lot of time on this one.

390
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:46,434
Yes, I understand, Jethro.

391
00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:48,664
Obviously at first blush,

392
00:22:48,727 --> 00:22:51,417
the uninitiated would pounce
upon the theory

393
00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:54,104
that he was involved
in some sort of macabre

394
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,282
or perhaps demonic ritual,

395
00:22:57,403 --> 00:22:58,298
but we

396
00:22:58,663 --> 00:23:00,848
are not so quick to draw

397
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:03,577
such an easy conclusion,
are we, Timothy?

398
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:09,034
Numerous cuts and nicks
on his torso and face.

399
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,874
Significant bruising of the left arm.

400
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,126
Coloration indicates that this bruise

401
00:23:15,163 --> 00:23:17,775
predates these more recent wounds.

402
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,145
Yeah, someone

403
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:22,269
gripped him, vicelike, and squeezed.

404
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:24,967
Yeah, that would have been me, Duck.

405
00:23:30,363 --> 00:23:32,310
I'll go see how the others are doing.

406
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:35,256
No, Jethro,

407
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:37,082
I think

408
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:40,262
in this case,
there is a totally mundane,

409
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:42,606
though no-less-sickening reason

410
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,441
that he was nailed to the floor.

411
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:48,310
They didn't want him to struggle
while they tortured him.

412
00:23:49,868 --> 00:23:50,872
Time of death?

413
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,067
Well, now,

414
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:55,362
that is another problem.

415
00:23:55,492 --> 00:23:57,264
Well, not for me, but for you.

416
00:23:57,691 --> 00:23:59,351
Rigor is fully set.

417
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,270
He's as stiff as the boards
to which he is nailed,

418
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,969
indicating a time of death at least

419
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,620
12 hours ago.

420
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:12,060
I'm afraid Sergeant Haas
was already long dead

421
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,679
when Maddie Tyler was abducted.

422
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:19,869
Guy comes back from Iraq,

423
00:24:19,884 --> 00:24:22,342
starts stalking a girl he barely knows,

424
00:24:22,402 --> 00:24:24,515
trashes her apartment,
and then abducts her?

425
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,604
Didn't abduct her.

426
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,077
Didn't abduct her?

427
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:28,207
Already dead.

428
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,766
Tortured first.

429
00:24:30,175 --> 00:24:31,581
He gave them Maddie's address.

430
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:33,059
They trashed her apartment.

431
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:35,380
Apparently, they did not find
what they were looking for.

432
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,583
So they abducted her.

433
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:37,834
Whoever they are.

434
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:39,255
She must know something.

435
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:41,791
Or have something they want.

436
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,629
McGee.

437
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:47,415
It's a GPS locator, boss.

438
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:49,152
Real time, wired into the radio.

439
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:53,206
Our stalker was being stalked.

440
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,478
You're always welcome down here, Jethro,

441
00:25:02,497 --> 00:25:04,847
- but I've barely started.
- I'll take whatever you got.

442
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,580
Well...

443
00:25:07,515 --> 00:25:09,650
nothing confirmed at this point.

444
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,701
No fatal wounds.

445
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:14,345
And there was very little blood loss
at the scene.

446
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:18,061
So we can rule out stabbing,
bludgeoning and gunshots.

447
00:25:18,121 --> 00:25:19,934
No signs of strangulation.

448
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:23,478
There does appear to be some

449
00:25:23,543 --> 00:25:25,086
petechial hemorrhaging,

450
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:27,807
which suggests asphyxia.

451
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Someone...

452
00:25:29,305 --> 00:25:31,593
could have smothered him with a pillow

453
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:34,610
or clamped a hand
over his nose and mouth.

454
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:42,313
She was abducted
more than six hours ago.

455
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:43,342
Your point?

456
00:25:44,782 --> 00:25:46,692
Well, there's a strong
possibility that...

457
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,902
Look, if I have to explain it,

458
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,274
perhaps you are too close to this.

459
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,470
What else?

460
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:58,978
Swelling of his face.

461
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,375
And then there are these
lumps and bumps.

462
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,410
Could be hives.

463
00:26:02,468 --> 00:26:03,523
Allergic reaction?

464
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:05,894
Wait a minute.

465
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:08,667
It could be anaphylactic shock.

466
00:26:09,852 --> 00:26:13,614
Yes, the most severe form
of anaphylaxis occurs

467
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:15,717
when an allergic response

468
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:18,084
triggers the release of large
quantities of

469
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:20,463
immunological mediators.

470
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:23,125
This leads to systemic

471
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,711
vasodilation.

472
00:26:24,907 --> 00:26:27,338
Yes, my suspicions were correct.

473
00:26:27,824 --> 00:26:29,941
His air passages are all closed up.

474
00:26:31,068 --> 00:26:32,699
Probably dead within minutes.

475
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:34,129
Allergic to what?

476
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:35,625
Seafood.

477
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:38,990
And he wouldn't have to have
eaten any of it.

478
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,052
Merely coming into contact
with it would have

479
00:26:42,197 --> 00:26:43,856
caused his demise.

480
00:26:44,884 --> 00:26:45,907
Jethro,

481
00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:48,974
just who are you trying to save?

482
00:26:57,379 --> 00:26:59,076
I look at her, I see Kelly, Duck.

483
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,462
How it should have been.

484
00:27:03,096 --> 00:27:04,813
Jethro, be careful.

485
00:27:05,995 --> 00:27:07,288
Don't let your...

486
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,324
Some things...

487
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:12,937
just can't be undone.

488
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:15,336
I wasn't there then.

489
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:17,774
I am now.

490
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,913
I don't want to see you,
cause I don't have anything yet.

491
00:27:22,914 --> 00:27:24,194
Working on it as fast as I can,

492
00:27:24,195 --> 00:27:25,502
you know how fast that is nobody's

493
00:27:25,503 --> 00:27:28,027
faster than me.
I am the master of faster, normally,

494
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:29,951
but there's nothing normal about this.

495
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:31,127
Do you have my things?

496
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:33,372
Yes, his clothes and the nails.

497
00:27:35,227 --> 00:27:36,693
We're going to find her, Gibbs.

498
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:39,247
We're going to find her.
You believe that, right?

499
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,336
Don't answer that.

500
00:27:40,707 --> 00:27:41,883
Forget I asked.

501
00:27:42,054 --> 00:27:42,918
Just...

502
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:46,959
Okay.

503
00:27:48,682 --> 00:27:51,074
I need all of you to get out of my lab.

504
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:52,193
Let me do my thing.

505
00:27:52,251 --> 00:27:54,518
I have all these samples
to test and Major Mass Spec

506
00:27:54,562 --> 00:27:57,160
is going to blow up
in protest if I don't blow up first.

507
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:05,107
Sorry.

508
00:28:05,746 --> 00:28:06,979
This isn't my lab.

509
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:09,976
I'm going to go.

510
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,208
A high-end item like a GPS locator

511
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:32,055
I figured the manufacturer would
keep a record of who it was sold to.

512
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,740
Cross-checked the serial number
against their records.

513
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:35,885
Look who I found.

514
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,914
Makes Maxie Bordais a big fat liar.

515
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,537
And a suspect.

516
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:42,922
Bring him in.

517
00:28:43,794 --> 00:28:45,610
Soldier of fortune is about to become

518
00:28:45,658 --> 00:28:46,851
soldier of misfortune.

519
00:28:46,898 --> 00:28:49,811
Dogs of war are about to taste
the hair of the dogs.

520
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,663
Think she's alive?

521
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:56,138
After what they did to Haas,

522
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,823
maybe it'd be best if she was not.

523
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:02,428
Showtime.

524
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:05,534
This your subtle way
of sending me a message, Director?

525
00:29:05,763 --> 00:29:07,461
Nothing subtle about it, Mr. Bordais.

526
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:10,364
You are now officially a suspect
in this murder investigation.

527
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:13,100
Want to explain that?

528
00:29:13,158 --> 00:29:16,130
GPS locator.
Real-time tracking of target vehicles.

529
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:17,359
Bought by your company.

530
00:29:17,397 --> 00:29:18,916
Found in Sergeant Haas's car.

531
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:20,053
Operational.

532
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,910
Wait for it.

533
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:25,418
Wait for it.

534
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:28,650
I need to make a phone call.

535
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:30,389
Some of these guys are so predictable.

536
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,978
First sign of pressure, and they cave.

537
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,496
See that coming a mile way.

538
00:29:34,032 --> 00:29:36,212
A lawyer is not going to help you now.

539
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:38,167
I'm not calling a lawyer.

540
00:29:40,327 --> 00:29:41,497
Calling the Pentagon.

541
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,172
Like I said,

542
00:29:48,314 --> 00:29:49,703
hair of the dogs.

543
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:52,592
I was assigned
as a special investigator with SIGIR.

544
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:54,192
I take it you've heard of us?

545
00:29:54,231 --> 00:29:57,549
Special Inspector General
for Iraqi Reconstruction.

546
00:29:57,682 --> 00:29:58,917
As I'm sure you're aware,

547
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:00,817
SIGIR was established to audit

548
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,063
funds allocated
to the rebuilding of Iraq.

549
00:30:03,355 --> 00:30:04,418
Unfortunately,

550
00:30:04,437 --> 00:30:07,292
substantial amounts of that money
are unaccounted for.

551
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:10,026
I heard $8 billion in cash.

552
00:30:10,283 --> 00:30:11,863
$100 notes.

553
00:30:12,105 --> 00:30:13,340
Plane loads of them.

554
00:30:14,593 --> 00:30:17,037
No one denies mistakes were made,
Director.

555
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:19,623
We're doing the best we can
to recover the money

556
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:21,271
to return it back to the Iraqi people.

557
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:22,750
What's that got to do with Haas?

558
00:30:22,824 --> 00:30:24,182
Two of my employees

559
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:26,356
were suspected of stealing $4 million

560
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:28,754
from a vault in Baghdad three years ago.

561
00:30:29,618 --> 00:30:30,622
Names?

562
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:34,038
Danny Coyle, Brian Judd.

563
00:30:34,072 --> 00:30:35,364
Both ex-Army.

564
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:37,256
<i>- Let go of me!
- Get in the car!</i>

565
00:30:37,286 --> 00:30:39,205
<i>- Shut up and get in!
- Somebody help!</i>

566
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:41,181
<i>Help me! Help!</i>

567
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:42,996
While we suspected them,

568
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,796
we never found the money.

569
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:46,332
Until two weeks ago.

570
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:47,979
It had never left Iraq.

571
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,150
Couldn't move it.

572
00:30:49,188 --> 00:30:50,963
Finally, they approached Sergeant Haas.

573
00:30:50,993 --> 00:30:53,275
He found a way to smuggle
the money out of the country.

574
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:55,317
But it appears he got greedy.

575
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,092
No honor among thieves.

576
00:30:57,191 --> 00:31:00,285
Sergeant Haas is the only one who knows
how the money's being shipped.

577
00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:01,491
His tour was up.

578
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,698
He didn't have a lot of time
to organize it.

579
00:31:03,724 --> 00:31:04,971
We think just a few days.

580
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:07,864
You were tracking him via GPS?

581
00:31:07,895 --> 00:31:08,705
Yes.

582
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,210
And Coyle and Judd?

583
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:13,002
Until they switched cars 24 hours ago.

584
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,209
We know the money has arrived.

585
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:17,601
We just have no idea how or where Haas

586
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:18,909
is planning to collect it.

587
00:31:19,234 --> 00:31:20,497
You know where they are?

588
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:21,599
No.

589
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:24,039
- Said you were tracking them.
- We're tracking them.

590
00:31:24,141 --> 00:31:26,016
As I said, we lost them.

591
00:31:26,037 --> 00:31:27,116
Compromised?

592
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:28,899
We don't believe so.

593
00:31:29,044 --> 00:31:31,397
They're very good at what they do.

594
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:33,578
Taking counter measures, changing cars,

595
00:31:33,711 --> 00:31:36,001
only turning on cell phones
to check messages.

596
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,837
They abducted a girl this morning.

597
00:31:37,886 --> 00:31:38,922
We know.

598
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:40,355
You know?

599
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:42,906
Our surveillance was breaking down,

600
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:44,900
and we were waiting for more manpower.

601
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,167
You saw it happen.

602
00:31:46,255 --> 00:31:47,957
We couldn't have stopped it,
Agent Gibbs,

603
00:31:47,976 --> 00:31:49,748
and I resent the suggestion

604
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:52,529
that we placed this operation
ahead of the life of that young woman.

605
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,235
- Where did you lose them?
- I don't have to share that information

606
00:31:54,236 --> 00:31:55,270
- with you.
- Where?

607
00:31:56,043 --> 00:31:57,664
In her apartment, in the street?

608
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,961
The next block? The next suburb?
Where exactly

609
00:31:59,977 --> 00:32:02,627
- did you lose them, Colonel?
- Enough, Agent Gibbs!

610
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:11,232
- I think we're done here.
- The hell we are!

611
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,902
NCIS is conducting an investigation

612
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:19,921
into the murder
of a United States Marine,

613
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:21,419
and I can assure you,

614
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,098
I will bring down
the full weight of this service

615
00:32:24,113 --> 00:32:27,184
if you do not give me
your utmost cooperation.

616
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:29,171
Do I make myself understood?

617
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:32,208
Yes, ma'am.

618
00:32:33,448 --> 00:32:34,259
Now...

619
00:32:35,147 --> 00:32:37,519
where exactly did you lose them,
Colonel?

620
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,033
- Hey, DiNozzo.
- Boss.

621
00:32:40,052 --> 00:32:41,605
Abby gets something, you handle it.

622
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,186
No problem, call you right away.

623
00:32:43,741 --> 00:32:45,216
That what I said, DiNozzo?

624
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:46,659
I'll handle it.

625
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:03,757
Jethro...

626
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,763
They think Coyle and Judd

627
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:10,260
might be somewhere down
in the old dock district.

628
00:33:10,395 --> 00:33:11,398
Tell DiNozzo.

629
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:16,481
Tony...

630
00:33:16,817 --> 00:33:17,862
Director?

631
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,313
Any idea where he's going?

632
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:20,184
No.

633
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:21,391
Hazard a guess?

634
00:33:21,452 --> 00:33:24,233
Well, he took his badge and his gun.
Maybe he's gonna shoot someone.

635
00:33:25,132 --> 00:33:26,212
Oh, boy.

636
00:33:37,378 --> 00:33:39,586
<i>This is Coyle. Leave a message.</i>

637
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:41,837
You want your money,

638
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:43,870
call me back.

639
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,632
<i>This is ground control to Major McTom.</i>

640
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:53,523
<i>This is ground control to Major Tom.</i>

641
00:33:53,603 --> 00:33:54,780
<i>Is anybody out there?</i>

642
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:56,502
What?

643
00:33:57,949 --> 00:33:58,991
I'm just checking.

644
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:02,161
You've been staring into space
for the last hour.

645
00:34:02,162 --> 00:34:04,718
Even on the McGeeko scale
that's cause for concern.

646
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:07,724
It's been five minutes, not an hour,
and I'm not staring into space,

647
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,088
I'm staring at the plasma.

648
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,960
- Calling Gibbs?
- He did not pick up.

649
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:12,771
- Worried about him?
- Are you?

650
00:34:13,222 --> 00:34:14,450
You be worried about him.

651
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,045
I'll be tentatively troubled.

652
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,723
Privately perturbed.

653
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:19,372
Fleetingly flustered.

654
00:34:19,509 --> 00:34:20,594
Have you called him?

655
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:24,638
I would have to be deeply
discombobulated to even

656
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:28,106
think of calling him. Okay, McTim,
you win. What are we looking at?

657
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:29,993
What do you see?

658
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:35,149
It's an iceberg,
and we're headed right for it.

659
00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:39,236
More like the $4 million tip
of an $8 billion iceberg.

660
00:34:39,602 --> 00:34:42,391
Forget the $4 million,
I'd settle for finding Maddie.

661
00:34:43,096 --> 00:34:45,517
I've been trying to figure out
where she fits.

662
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,084
- She doesn't.
- For her to have been abducted,

663
00:34:48,482 --> 00:34:49,987
they must think she has the money.

664
00:34:50,209 --> 00:34:51,665
Or can lead them to the money.

665
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:54,016
If she can, she doesn't know.
She would have told Gibbs.

666
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:55,814
Maybe she doesn't know she knows.

667
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,344
Sergeant Haas comes back from Iraq,

668
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,451
the first thing he does is try
to move in with a girl he's dated twice.

669
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:03,060
- Why?
- He's a man.

670
00:35:03,379 --> 00:35:05,273
What does she have that he does not?

671
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:07,640
- A bed.
- A room.

672
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,253
A place for Haas to stay.

673
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:10,998
He had a room at Quantico.

674
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:13,328
So, what does her apartment have
that Quantico doesn't?

675
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:14,750
Privacy.

676
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:15,850
No guardhouse.

677
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:16,982
No car searches.

678
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:18,605
A street address.

679
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,442
Her apartment has a street address.

680
00:35:21,798 --> 00:35:23,215
Which means mail delivery.

681
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:25,317
How long takes a letter
to get here from Iraq?

682
00:35:25,404 --> 00:35:27,666
A week.
Give or take a day or two.

683
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:29,773
He's from Chicago.
No family here.

684
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:31,209
No delivery address.

685
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:34,697
He wasn't stalking her.
He was hanging out to check the mail.

686
00:35:35,274 --> 00:35:36,643
Get down to her apartment.

687
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,823
Find the mailman.

688
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:45,811
He figured it out.

689
00:35:45,948 --> 00:35:47,218
And he didn't tell us.

690
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:48,681
You call him?

691
00:35:50,476 --> 00:35:51,479
You?

692
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,110
He didn't pick up.

693
00:36:12,326 --> 00:36:15,769
<i>If that diamond ring turns brass.</i>

694
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,958
<i>Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass.</i>

695
00:36:22,198 --> 00:36:23,203
<i>Don't go, Daddy.</i>

696
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:25,747
<i>Please, please don't go.</i>

697
00:36:27,557 --> 00:36:30,181
<i>I still think about her,
after all these years.</i>

698
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,291
<i>Wonder what she'd be like.</i>

699
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:34,982
Like you.

700
00:36:38,097 --> 00:36:39,349
Excuse me.

701
00:36:43,071 --> 00:36:45,019
Got a registered letter for Rudi Haas.

702
00:36:45,526 --> 00:36:46,914
I need to see some ID.

703
00:36:53,184 --> 00:36:54,263
Don't want to know.

704
00:37:13,212 --> 00:37:14,213
There he is.

705
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:17,530
Excuse me!

706
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,527
NCIS. We're trying to locate a letter
addressed to Sergeant Rudi Haas.

707
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:23,219
<i>Just delivered it.</i>

708
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,590
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

709
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:27,308
- How long?
<i>- Five minutes.</i>

710
00:37:27,415 --> 00:37:29,516
<i>He signed for a letter.
It appears Haas</i>

711
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,522
shipped the money out of Iraq as
the personal effects of a dead Marine.

712
00:37:32,577 --> 00:37:34,050
Gibbs must have the receipt.

713
00:37:34,076 --> 00:37:35,181
Gone to collect them.

714
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:36,445
Find him, Ziva.

715
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,864
He beat us to it.

716
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,669
Abby... she's caught a fish.

717
00:37:41,988 --> 00:37:43,200
Atlantic bluefin tuna.

718
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:45,564
These pallet nails were sticky with it.

719
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,876
The fish oil gets caught
in the spiral shank of the nails,

720
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:50,207
it dries, it gets gucky.

721
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:51,865
The more oil, the more gucky.

722
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:55,221
So they're just layer after layer
after layer of guck.

723
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:58,526
When they whacked these into his hands,

724
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:00,320
they were like poison darts.

725
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:01,931
How common is bluefin tuna?

726
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:03,956
I checked with the fishing authorities.

727
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:06,565
There's very few places
that handle it in DC.

728
00:38:06,933 --> 00:38:08,882
Most are
at the Maine Avenue Fish Market.

729
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:10,371
That's too crowded.

730
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:11,729
That leaves us with...

731
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:13,894
Southwestern Marine.

732
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:15,347
It's down by the old dock.

733
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:17,276
There was an exporting company there.

734
00:38:17,442 --> 00:38:19,111
It closed down a couple years ago.

735
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:20,238
Exporting what?

736
00:38:20,718 --> 00:38:21,546
Guck.

737
00:38:22,618 --> 00:38:24,817
I'll get McGee and Ziva
to meet you there.

738
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,318
Has anybody heard from Gibbs?

739
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:39,982
I called him and he didn't pick up.
He always picks up.

740
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,054
Good work, Abby.

741
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:51,513
All right.

742
00:38:57,985 --> 00:38:59,414
<i>- You got it?</i>
- I got it.

743
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,795
<i>- All right, then bring it to us.</i>
- Where?

744
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,643
<i>Southwestern Marine,
main storage building.</i>

745
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:06,505
<i>And make sure it's just you.</i>

746
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,617
On my way.

747
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:43,150
You okay?

748
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:44,368
I'm so sorry.

749
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:46,144
You're her father?

750
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:47,714
It make a difference if I am?

751
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:51,661
Not to me.
Arms up.

752
00:39:54,662 --> 00:39:55,662
Spread 'em.

753
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:00,279
He's clean.

754
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,380
Haas said there were two bags.

755
00:40:05,162 --> 00:40:06,705
Other one is in the trunk of my car.

756
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:08,017
Yeah, it's good.

757
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:13,263
You get the keys, I get Maddie.

758
00:40:14,817 --> 00:40:15,817
Where's the car?

759
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:17,731
Downtown parking lot.

760
00:40:18,935 --> 00:40:19,935
I caught a cab.

761
00:40:23,618 --> 00:40:25,780
Then you better find another cab
and go get it.

762
00:40:29,232 --> 00:40:30,232
Get it yourself.

763
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:37,588
Run!

764
00:40:38,294 --> 00:40:39,228
In the car!

765
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:40,263
Car!

766
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:41,785
<i>It's okay, Daddy.</i>

767
00:41:44,427 --> 00:41:45,486
<i>It's okay.</i>

768
00:41:47,484 --> 00:41:48,484
<i>Go back, Daddy.</i>

769
00:41:48,916 --> 00:41:49,916
<i>Go back.</i>

770
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:51,166
<i>It's okay.</i>

771
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:52,543
<i>I love you, Daddy.</i>

772
00:41:53,284 --> 00:41:54,284
<i>Love you.</i>

773
00:41:54,499 --> 00:41:55,569
<i>I love you, Daddy.</i>

774
