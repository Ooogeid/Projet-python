2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,920
The evidence in my report

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,955
says that you killed
Pedro Hernandez.

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,511
People around me are dying.
People I care about.

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,636
Bell is after me.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,306
- Because you threw him in jail.
- He's a criminal!

7
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:16,786
First Macy...

8
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,643
Then you kill Mike Franks.

9
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,935
That ain't Franks.

10
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,105
- Who is it?
- Colonel Merton Bell.

11
00:00:22,662 --> 00:00:24,093
Who do you really work for?

12
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:37,592
Thank you, Lieutenant.

13
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:41,919
You know who I am?

14
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,793
Paloma Reynosa.

15
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:49,126
Head of the Reynosa Cartel.

16
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,264
What else do you know?

17
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:56,481
That the drug trade
is recession-proof.

18
00:00:57,226 --> 00:00:58,558
Tennessee Williams said,

19
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,161
"We are all sentenced
to solitary confinement

20
00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:04,063
inside our own skins for life."

21
00:01:04,937 --> 00:01:07,603
Surrounded by men with guns,
I think of this often.

22
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:10,780
Beautiful, sad, but frank.

23
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:15,921
Do you consider yourself
a frank man?

24
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:22,957
He also said all cruel people describe
themselves as paragons of frankness.

25
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:26,878
I would expect nothing less
from the man who murdered my father.

26
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:39,640
I see you choose your words carefully,
Agent Gibbs. That is good.

27
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:43,482
Your life depends on them.

28
00:01:46,122 --> 00:01:47,899
I don't usually drink Scotch.

33
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,016
This can't be happening.

34
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,609
It cannot be happening.

35
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,184
- How could they let you in?
- I passed the exams.

36
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:30,895
I will officially become a citizen
of the United States of America.

37
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:33,486
I've never been more disappointed
in my government.

38
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:36,405
- That is my government now.
- Not till Friday.

39
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:38,873
And I expect to see you there,
and...

40
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,087
you, too, McGee.

41
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:41,773
Of course, I'm gonna be there.

42
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:43,445
Everyone is gonna be there.

43
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:45,331
Even...

44
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:48,709
Gibbs, I bet,
once he comes back from his...

45
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,115
Let's call it a vacation.

46
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,254
It is not the first time
he has run off on his own.

47
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,250
Not the first time
he's run off to Mexico.

48
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,093
Certainly not the first time
he's gone without telling us anything.

49
00:02:57,574 --> 00:02:59,595
Nope, nothing new to see here.

50
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:01,597
Not a poker player among you.

51
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:04,100
Terrible, terrible bluffs.

52
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,562
We're all used to how Gibbs operates,
for better, for worse.

53
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,273
Let's just stay focused
on what we're good at without him.

54
00:03:12,028 --> 00:03:13,484
What would that be, Director?

55
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,070
If you don't know, Agent DiNozzo,
I'm not gonna tell you.

56
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:18,836
Agent McGee, I need you.

57
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,062
On my way, Director.

58
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:25,733
That was a pretty tasty and cryptic
bit of rejection right there.

59
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:27,886
Did you see that?
The director just slammed me.

60
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,822
I saw.

61
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,044
You must be feeling
like the redheaded stepchild.

62
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,938
Now, how would you get
that idiom right?

63
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,019
- Because I'm an American now.
- Not yet.

64
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:38,801
I think I'm gonna call
my congressman.

65
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:44,360
You were friendly with Rivera
when you and Ms. Sciuto were in Mexico?

66
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:47,405
Well, in the broadest definition,
I suppose.

67
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,076
We have an awkward
situation brewing already.

68
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,641
You want to complicate it further?

69
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:55,610
I want all his information going through
this office directly, not to Ms. Hart.

70
00:03:56,548 --> 00:03:59,768
I've asked him to enlist the <i>Federales</i>
in tracking down Colonel Bell

71
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:01,735
and his men south of the border.

72
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,244
And Margaret Allison Hart, Esq.
is under the employ of Colonel Bell.

73
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:07,330
All right, I won't let you down.

74
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:09,914
- Bring him online, please.
- Yes, Director.

75
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,554
<i>Señor</i> Rivera,
any update on Bell's plane?

76
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:19,842
<i>No, Director Vance, but we may
have found Colonel Bell himself.</i>

77
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:24,188
<i>My men recovered a partially dismembered
body fitting his description.</i>

78
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:28,093
<i>It was not far from the massacre
at the home of an American expatriate</i>

79
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:29,602
<i>by the name of Mike Franks.</i>

80
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:32,098
<i>Technicians
are still processing that scene,</i>

81
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:33,967
<i>employing lessons learned
from Ms. Sciuto.</i>

82
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:35,407
Well, they learned well.

83
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:37,234
We received the fingerprint scans.

84
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:41,059
Already identified several
of the deceased from military databases

85
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:43,169
as known associates of Colonel Bell.

86
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,757
<i>The others are suspected
members of the Reynosa Cartel.</i>

87
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:48,955
<i>A laundry list of charges
against each of them.</i>

88
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,720
I'm tasking my agents from the San Diego
office to assist you on the ground.

89
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,546
If you have no objections,

90
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,968
our Navy transport will retrieve
the evidence and the bodies.

91
00:04:58,052 --> 00:04:59,860
<i>I believe the presence
of American agents</i>

92
00:04:59,944 --> 00:05:01,990
<i>may help calm the violence,
because...</i>

93
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,335
<i>this cartel is afraid
of nothing in Mexico.</i>

94
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:07,703
If I'm unavailable, you'll communicate
directly with Special Agent McGee.

95
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:09,054
<i>Understood.</i>

96
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:10,305
All yours.

97
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:14,230
<i>Questions for me, Agent McGee?</i>

98
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:17,650
Sir, any sign of Gibbs
or Franks on that beach?

99
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:20,552
<i>Of Gibbs?</i>

100
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,154
<i>He's in Mexico?</i>

101
00:05:24,943 --> 00:05:26,858
You solve crimes for a living.

102
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,099
Is there such a thing
as a perfect murder?

103
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:32,039
I've never seen one.

104
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,458
But how would it work?

105
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:39,380
It's not the method,
it's the victim.

106
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:41,048
Kill someone no one will miss.

107
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:44,093
You don't need tips
on how to kill me.

108
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:48,847
I am not opposed to killing
or torture when it suits my needs.

109
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:51,057
That is part of my business.

110
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:56,178
The late Colonel Bell wanted to prove
he was a better man than you.

111
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,313
He and his men made
for a useful ally, but...

112
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:02,370
they were a means to an end.

113
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:04,708
Namely you.

114
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:07,491
I don't know what you're after,

115
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,245
but you might as well put a bullet
in my head right now, because

116
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,875
you're not gonna get anything.

117
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,959
It's never easy to turn someone,
to change them.

118
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:20,101
A federal agent in Washington DC?

119
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,423
You have value.

120
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:25,325
I don't want your death.

121
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:28,491
I want your life.

122
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:46,756
You gonna make me suffer?

123
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:52,036
Threat of a murder charge
force me to work with you?

124
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:56,100
Thing about being a cop
called burden of proof.

125
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:57,450
You want evidence?

126
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,624
An investigation performed
by your own people

127
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,836
that conclusively puts
your signature on the crime.

128
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,758
Show me.

129
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:08,021
Prove to me I'm guilty of a crime.

130
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:10,429
Bring it out in the open.

131
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:12,930
I know something about convictions.

132
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:15,643
I get 'em and I got 'em.

133
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:22,313
I don't care to put you
on trial, Gibbs.

134
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,111
It may not suit
my needs to kill you.

135
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:31,272
But it might be useful to kill
everyone you ever met.

136
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:39,542
Starting with your friend Mike.

137
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:45,977
Your former
mother-in-law comes next.

138
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,362
Doing me favors now?

139
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,637
And then your coworkers.

140
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:55,675
If I must,

141
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,457
I promise
to personally visit Pennsylvania

142
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:01,345
and shoot your father in the head.

143
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:05,233
That would complete the circle.

144
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,644
We will start small.

145
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:14,068
Just make sure
this package is delivered.

146
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,107
How many more lives
are your convictions worth?

147
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,815
Thank you, Captain.

148
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:26,810
- They're on their way.
- G-5 out of Dulles?

149
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:29,183
C-130 fueling at Pax River.

150
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:31,553
- I want you two on board.
- Where is it going?

151
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:32,948
Ride-along to Mexico.

152
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,056
Ms. Sciuto and Dr. Mallard
are done with the cold case.

153
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:38,092
Return Hernandez's body,

154
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:40,825
escort the new bodies back
to Andrews and then here.

155
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,600
Assure an unbroken
chain of evidence.

156
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:45,811
Tell Rivera the airlift is en route.

157
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:48,813
He's got news, too,
no word on Franks,

158
00:08:48,897 --> 00:08:52,156
but apparently, he thinks
they have tracked Gibbs' location.

159
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:55,662
I never mentioned Gibbs to them.

160
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,786
Who told them to look for Gibbs?

161
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,911
Well, I may have mentioned it.
Was that not supposed to happen?

162
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,308
You want us to bring Gibbs back,
too, Director?

163
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:13,254
Plane's only gonna be on the ground long
enough to load... couple of hours, tops.

164
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,761
You really think you can locate
and retrieve him in that period of time?

165
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,738
- Did you see that?
- See what?

166
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:25,575
The wink.

167
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:28,074
- Director Vance winked?
- I think he winked.

168
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:30,437
Unless he was prepping
his eye for the scanner, but...

169
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:33,392
- Why would it matter if he winked?
- 'Cause that's what he and Gibbs do.

170
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:36,676
They have this whole
wink-wink-nudge- nudge language.

171
00:09:37,514 --> 00:09:39,938
If Vance can't green-light an op,

172
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:43,430
he expects us to pick up
the slack when we see it.

173
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:47,438
- You see slack?
- I don't know. Did you see a wink?

174
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:01,371
Very well.

175
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:13,393
<i>Buenos dias, Señor Rivera.</i>

176
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,364
<i>Es policia.</i>

177
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,241
<i>Es Americano!</i>

178
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:19,451
<i>Hay algún problema?</i>

179
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,620
We are just having a drink.

180
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:26,391
Has this woman
made threats against you?

181
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:28,794
Do you want to file
charges for abduction?

182
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,816
Remember my advice.

183
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:35,240
Choose your words carefully.

184
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,161
No threat...

185
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,791
against me personally.

186
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:43,490
You are reaching.

187
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:45,163
So are you.

188
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:56,947
Come with me.

189
00:10:59,214 --> 00:11:00,534
Say <i>adios</i>.

190
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,754
How'd you find me?

191
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,511
I follow her moves very closely.

192
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:17,391
She is never reckless.

193
00:11:18,392 --> 00:11:20,846
Difficult,
almost impossible to prosecute.

194
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:24,261
I nearly had her when a private
investigator from America

195
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:25,934
came digging
into her father's death.

196
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:27,840
She had the PI killed.

197
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,328
You had your task force
investigate the cold case,

198
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:32,987
Pedro Hernandez.

199
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,539
Or was that just coincidence?

200
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:37,238
The report Ms. Sciuto prepared?

201
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,073
I still have not seen it.

202
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:42,159
Paloma must have
someone on the inside.

203
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,481
She hadn't seen it yet, either.

204
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:46,856
What happened to it?
Someone must have stopped it.

205
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,126
Ms. Sciuto?

206
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:50,964
You are certain?

207
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:54,760
I'm dead certain.

208
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:56,673
I wouldn't allow it.

209
00:11:58,077 --> 00:11:59,485
I believe this.

210
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:00,929
That's all I needed to know.

211
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,019
Someone took
a bullet for you, Gibbs,

212
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:07,034
but you will take the next one.

213
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,097
Surprise.

214
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:19,113
Well, <i>hermano</i>,

215
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,031
does he have your precious report?

216
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,035
<i>Hermano.</i>

217
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:28,690
Brother and sister.

218
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:32,315
I guess she never had to turn you.

219
00:12:35,098 --> 00:12:37,162
You should hear the words
to the oath I have to take.

220
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:40,094
I basically have to renounce
all my ties to Israel.

221
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,626
You will still be you, Ziva,
and I'll be there to hear it, I promise.

222
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,684
You guys are going to Mexico.
What's the plan?

223
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:49,580
What do you know, Abs?

224
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,571
Gibbs mentioned rule 40.

225
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:56,955
If you think someone's out to get you,
they are?

226
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:59,189
I have never heard
a rule in the 40s.

227
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:02,311
- They don't come up very often.
- And that's a good thing.

228
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,992
How many times have I told Gibbs
to write these things down?

229
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,578
You don't have to write 'em down,
they're for daily use...

230
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,972
- but the 40s...
- The 40s are for emergency use only.

231
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,703
If the 40s are in play,
something unspeakably bad is going down.

232
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,220
We have to get him back.

233
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,555
Your sister wants
to make me her pet.

234
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:27,680
And you?

235
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,092
What do you want?
You want to put me on trial?

236
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,359
I cannot.

237
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,540
Without that report,

238
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:37,193
it will be her way.

239
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:39,943
Or she kills everyone you love.

240
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:41,989
There is no other option.

241
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:45,186
I've had this before.

242
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,121
There's no way out.

243
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,882
And that riddle.

244
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,903
Guy trapped in a room...

245
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,638
no doors, no windows.

246
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:00,873
Then how did he get there?

247
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:02,423
Was built around him,

248
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:05,177
but there's nothing
there except a mirror and a table.

249
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:07,054
How does he get out?

250
00:14:09,602 --> 00:14:10,871
Here's a hint.

251
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:12,976
It won't work in Spanish.

252
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:18,580
Look in the mirror,
see what you saw,

253
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:22,819
take the saw, cut the table in half,

254
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,139
two halves make a whole,

255
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,013
climb out the hole.

256
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:30,077
Most retarded riddle
I've ever heard.

257
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,912
My father told it to me.

258
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:35,372
My dad.

259
00:14:37,305 --> 00:14:38,689
Never an easy guy.

260
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:42,612
But it takes a man
to make a man, right?

261
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:46,968
<i>Hermano.</i>

262
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:49,888
When things get rough,

263
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,683
I can still go talk to him.

264
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,683
You know so much, Gibbs.

265
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:00,690
Well, tell me this.

266
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,068
How will this feel to me?

267
00:15:04,298 --> 00:15:06,363
What will it feel like
to pull this trigger?

268
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:13,328
Don't let him make you into a killer.
You are more powerful in the government.

269
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,830
<i>Bastante, Paloma!</i>

270
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:17,726
I'm gonna shoot him
with his own gun.

271
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,252
You've never done this before.

272
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,543
I have.

273
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:27,036
I've killed men and women

274
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:30,260
in combat, in the line, and in life,

275
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:33,332
and some of them still haunt me.

276
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:37,142
But I never lost a night's sleep

277
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:39,146
over your father.

278
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:44,693
You want to know what it feels
like to be the hand of justice?

279
00:15:46,348 --> 00:15:49,239
Then pull the damn trigger yourself
and find out. Go on.

280
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,306
Do it!

281
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,021
All right, we gotta move fast.

282
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:04,205
And quietly.

283
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:06,952
No authority,
no jurisdiction, no time.

284
00:16:07,036 --> 00:16:09,217
We do not get back
on this plane without Gibbs.

285
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,092
Agreed.

286
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,621
You didn't find Franks?

287
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:43,341
- I said, you didn't find Mike Franks?
- I heard you.

288
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:45,533
So you just don't want
to talk about it?

289
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:51,958
Bartender said that Franks' family
left town the day before.

290
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,762
So he knew something was coming.

291
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,218
What else did you find out?

292
00:16:58,243 --> 00:17:00,921
<i>Federales</i> got tired
of me asking questions.

293
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:03,175
Why didn't you tell them
you're with the task force?

294
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,435
Because I wasn't!

295
00:17:06,077 --> 00:17:09,476
Still, I would've thought it'd take
the whole Mexican army to kick you out.

296
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,640
<i>Hey, back there,
we got some turbulence coming up.</i>

297
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:14,212
<i>Still a couple hours
from Andrews... hang on.</i>

298
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:26,015
You get held up at customs,
use my name.

299
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:28,046
Where are you gonna be?

300
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:30,295
Left a mess I got to clean up.

301
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:35,085
That's 45.

302
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:36,702
Basically.

303
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:43,907
This one.
That's the right model.

304
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:47,728
- You picked up an extra passenger.
- Yeah. Funny that.

305
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:49,959
Gibbs was just waiting
for us at the airport.

306
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:52,257
Alejandro called us
while you were in the air.

307
00:17:52,341 --> 00:17:53,488
Your new best buddy?

308
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,574
You said
he had to run Gibbs out of town.

309
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:59,709
Tempers running high already. Last thing
you needed was another cowboy.

310
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:03,049
Maybe he should've asked your permission
before he went down there.

311
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:04,841
He doesn't need my permission.

312
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:07,002
But without it,
he doesn't get your protection.

313
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:10,964
Fit it for a GPS and a bug.

314
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:13,564
Where's Gibbs?

315
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:15,621
He went home for a shower
and change of clothes.

316
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:17,853
Got some enchilada
and dust on his shirt.

317
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:19,806
When he gets in,
tell him I'd like to see him.

318
00:18:29,964 --> 00:18:33,195
Mr. Palmer, do you mind doing
that a little more quietly?

319
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,187
I can hardly hear myself think.

320
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,186
Sorry, Doctor.

321
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,385
What are you thinking about?

322
00:18:40,258 --> 00:18:41,904
- My God.
- What is it?

323
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,788
My mind's a complete blank.

324
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,541
Has that ever happened before?

325
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:51,129
Perhaps this reminds you
of a time when...

326
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:55,440
Or maybe you were just a lad, and...

327
00:18:56,513 --> 00:18:58,305
What is it you're doing, Mr. Palmer?

328
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,612
I thought maybe if I teed
the ball up properly...

329
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:02,097
I might find the fairway.

330
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:05,977
Yes, that does remind me of a caddy

331
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,412
on a golf course
just north of Glasgow.

332
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:10,908
He kept giving me unasked-for tips.

333
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:13,762
Every time I'd hit the ball,
he'd say, "No, no, no".

334
00:19:14,114 --> 00:19:15,569
He drove me crazy.

335
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:18,166
Finally, on the 18th, I am sitting

336
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,199
218 from the pin.

337
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:21,700
He hands me a five iron.

338
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,791
"Lay up", he says,
"and you'll be on in two".

339
00:19:25,345 --> 00:19:27,282
I stared at the man, and then,

340
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,052
for a moment,
my mind went completely blank.

341
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,462
Then I held out my hand.

342
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:34,685
"Three wood", I said calmly.

343
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,279
"I'm going for it."

344
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:39,350
"You", he says.
"Impossible".

345
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,450
So, I take my stance...

346
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,225
a day's frustration behind me.

347
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,678
And I uncork the shot of a lifetime.

348
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:53,024
As the ball flew away,
I screamed out

349
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:55,861
a dreadful obscenity at the man.

350
00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:59,643
Yeah, but you made the green.
No, no, I overshot it by 15 yards.

351
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:01,111
Took a triple bogey.

352
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,467
But, Mr. Palmer, I learned a lesson.

353
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:06,621
Being correct does not excuse

354
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,832
a violation of form.

355
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,787
Now... take those slugs
from Bell's body up to Abby,

356
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:15,422
and then finish opening your crates,

357
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,222
as quietly as possible.

358
00:20:24,252 --> 00:20:26,291
Hey, Dad.
How you feeling?

359
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:28,794
No. I'm good. I'm good.

360
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:32,107
Listen, is there anybody
you could stay with for a few days?

361
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,447
What's the status on the evidence?

362
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:39,542
I'm running the slug through the system
now that came from Bell's body,

363
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:41,040
but I don't expect to get a...

364
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,759
Match.
Weird. Okay.

365
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,064
That means the murder weapon's
already in the system.

366
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:48,690
Oh, no. Not again.

367
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:49,905
What again?

368
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,770
Do you think there's any chance that's
Gibbs went down to Mexico to kill Bell?

369
00:20:56,325 --> 00:20:58,048
Why would you think
something like that?

370
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:00,457
Because...

371
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:05,126
the slugs came from Gibbs' SIG.

372
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:12,622
<i>What would you say if we told you
that the slugs removed from Bell's torso</i>

373
00:21:13,111 --> 00:21:14,731
<i>came from Gibbs' gun?</i>

374
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,383
I would say that someone
is trying to present Gibbs...

375
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,194
as a murderer.

376
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:21,200
When he clearly is not?

377
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:24,883
Well, as friend and a colleague,
I think the best of Jethro, so,

378
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:28,036
yes, I would like to believe
that he did not kill this man.

379
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:29,955
But as a scientist,

380
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:32,495
I know that he did not.

381
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:35,661
- How can you be certain?
- The fatal injury was to the head,

382
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:40,058
and I would speculate that there are
defensive wounds to the hands.

383
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,636
This dismemberment
was intended to cloud

384
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:47,221
not only the identity of the victim,
but also of his killer.

385
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:48,890
Additionally,

386
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,477
Gibbs has always told us not
to believe in coincidence, so

387
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:55,819
when I see this serrated pattern,

388
00:21:55,903 --> 00:21:59,217
so similar to the KA-BAR nick
on Agent Macy's neck...

389
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:01,076
It's the same knife.

390
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,319
- Same killer.
- Most likely.

391
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:05,907
Bell's Lieutenant turned on him.

392
00:22:06,706 --> 00:22:08,245
And we know where Dean is.

393
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,120
He's with the cartel.

394
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,705
How did he get Gibbs' gun?

395
00:22:12,142 --> 00:22:14,582
Gibbs has always said
there's only one way to do that.

396
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:19,087
Pry it from his dead, cold hand.

397
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,133
Since Gibbs is not dead,
then we have to assume he met Dean...

398
00:22:24,808 --> 00:22:25,785
in Mexico.

399
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:27,969
I am busy here, tracking Dean.

400
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:31,589
Tony, why would Gibbs ever
let him walk away alive?

401
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:34,564
I mean, I'm tracing cell phones,
e-mails, credit card transactions...

402
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:36,857
- this is McGeek work.
- He's still in MTAC.

403
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,762
Gleefully chasing scraps of opportunity
that Director drops in front of him.

404
00:22:40,846 --> 00:22:43,795
He's like one of those fish that swims
around inside of a shark's mouth,

405
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:45,739
- picking stuff out of their teeth.
- Pilot.

406
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,866
- Yeah, pilot fish.
- No! The pilot.

407
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,156
Bell's corporate jet.

408
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,120
This charge at the Hacienda Grotto...
he has checked out.

409
00:22:52,315 --> 00:22:54,014
Plane's gonna be moving soon.

410
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:56,666
And here,
Bell's personal cell phone.

411
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,002
Look at the time stamps
on these calls.

412
00:22:59,355 --> 00:23:00,958
Dead men don't make phone calls.

413
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:05,126
Someone else is using his phone.
Perhaps the elusive J.P. Dean.

414
00:23:05,521 --> 00:23:08,059
I will do that McGee thing
to make sure it is active.

415
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,145
Look at us... doing it without him.

416
00:23:10,229 --> 00:23:11,586
- Without who?
- Hey, Boss.

417
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:13,247
Not you, Boss...

418
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:16,462
I mean, not that we would ever do
anything without you, because...

419
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,324
Within you or without you...
it's like a U2 song.

420
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:20,790
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

421
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:22,734
Director Vance
would like to see you.

422
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,622
I did it!

423
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,194
The phone is active.

424
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:32,748
Dean is making a call right now.

425
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,950
Can you find out who he's calling?

426
00:23:36,452 --> 00:23:37,732
I think so. Just a...

427
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:45,299
He's calling Gibbs.

428
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,334
You need to get that?

429
00:24:03,878 --> 00:24:05,189
It's a voice mail.

430
00:24:05,273 --> 00:24:08,254
What are the chances it's a message
from Lieutenant J.P. Dean...

431
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,117
The man who murdered Agent Macy
and possibly his own boss, Colonel Bell?

432
00:24:12,574 --> 00:24:14,244
I don't know.
I'd have to check.

433
00:24:27,112 --> 00:24:30,885
I spent a lot of time in Los Angeles,
getting that office up and running.

434
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:32,356
I noticed.

435
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,888
Hetty Lange, out there,

436
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,266
she's got a friend at Warner Bros.

437
00:24:36,702 --> 00:24:39,144
Took us on an inside studio tour.

438
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,300
Lot of old props,

439
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,954
costumes,
all the way back to <i>Casablanca</i>.

440
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:47,193
- You should tell DiNozzo.
- When I started here,

441
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,696
with our different philosophies,

442
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:53,283
it took me a minute to figure out
how we were going to get along.

443
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,807
I thought about Rick
and Louis from<i> Casablanca</i>.

444
00:24:56,691 --> 00:24:57,808
What, and I'm Rick?

445
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,916
In so many ways.

446
00:25:00,872 --> 00:25:01,872
The problem's me.

447
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:03,706
I'm sick of being Louis.

448
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,263
I'm sick of having to look the other way
when you're sneaking around

449
00:25:07,347 --> 00:25:09,209
behind my back.
That doesn't work for me.

450
00:25:09,582 --> 00:25:11,092
Maybe I shouldn't work for you.

451
00:25:12,654 --> 00:25:14,750
You tell me what the hell
you're into right now.

452
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:15,805
That's an order.

453
00:25:21,712 --> 00:25:22,816
You're benched.

454
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,939
- Took you long enough, Leon.
- You want to try me? Come on.

455
00:25:26,081 --> 00:25:29,066
- What stopped you day one?
- My job, my life,

456
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,802
does not revolve around you,
you egocentric son of a bitch.

457
00:25:31,886 --> 00:25:34,949
- You sure make it sound like it does.
- One word and you're done.

458
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:37,345
And you hate me
because I can make that call.

459
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:38,369
Right,

460
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:41,155
because my life revolves around you.

461
00:25:43,368 --> 00:25:44,208
What?

462
00:25:47,758 --> 00:25:50,423
Bell's jet just cleared
Mexican airspace.

463
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:53,843
Alejandro couldn't stop it.
Filed a flight plan for Virginia.

464
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,067
- How long?
- Five hours.

465
00:25:56,151 --> 00:25:58,473
And since the entire case
seems to be headed here,

466
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,683
Alejandro's gonna follow
on the next available flight.

467
00:26:02,182 --> 00:26:03,435
I'll be taking that.

468
00:26:17,188 --> 00:26:18,618
Have you met Darren?

469
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:20,662
Darren's an armed security guard.

470
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:22,914
He's recently been reassigned
to guard me.

471
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,958
Although I have no idea
why that might be.

472
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,811
Except when I look at you,

473
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:33,383
I know exactly why.

474
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,305
- I'm sorry...
- Gibbs,

475
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,247
why would you say that to me?

476
00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:40,650
It terrifies me
when you break your own rules.

477
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:42,849
You see what I'm doing there?

478
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:45,676
Wagging my finger
to stop you from talking?

479
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,773
It's something that Franks is probably
never going to be able to do again.

480
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:51,025
It is his finger, right?

481
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,232
Right index, to be specific.

482
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:57,949
Also known as the forefinger,
the digitus secundus,

483
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,449
pointer finger
and the trigger finger.

484
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:04,651
It's something else Mike Franks will
probably never be able to do again.

485
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:06,587
He was alive when it was severed,
though?

486
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:07,971
Ducky thinks so.

487
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:09,967
And it was shot off.

488
00:27:10,102 --> 00:27:11,513
For whatever it's worth.

489
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,217
Do they have him?
Do they have Mike?

490
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,925
Can you,
can you at least tell me who they are?

491
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:33,497
I guess that's why superheroes
have secret identities.

492
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,037
Despite his reputation
in this building,

493
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:47,749
I considered Bell a good man.

494
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:52,128
I imagine you wouldn't have worked
for him if you'd believed otherwise.

495
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,690
Thank you, Doctor,
for that consideration.

496
00:27:56,736 --> 00:27:57,880
Forgive me.

497
00:27:57,964 --> 00:28:01,240
I forget sometimes the effect
this room has on people.

498
00:28:02,939 --> 00:28:06,085
It does lend itself
to a measure of introspection.

499
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,535
What is it you want to know,
Dr. Mallard?

500
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:16,236
It was the Colonel who had
an axe to grind with Gibbs, not you.

501
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:18,821
You were carrying out orders.

502
00:28:19,305 --> 00:28:20,554
It was a request.

503
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:23,659
One I was free to decline.

504
00:28:24,054 --> 00:28:27,163
But you were interested
in learning more about Gibbs.

505
00:28:29,826 --> 00:28:30,676
I was.

506
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,169
And now you're feeling
you backed the wrong man.

507
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:35,629
Now...

508
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:41,256
I'm remembering you have
some sort of psychological degree.

509
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:47,712
It's a small airfield not far
from Bell's residence.

510
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:49,058
Keeps a hanger here.

511
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:50,929
Alejandro's sure Dean is on board?

512
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:53,745
Eyewitness confirms Dean was traveling
with at least four other men.

513
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:55,380
Including the pilot and copilot.

514
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,135
You three meet the plane.

515
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,407
Grab Dean as soon as he steps off.
Bring him back.

516
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,242
Any questions?

517
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,102
One.

518
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,754
Who's gonna lead?

519
00:29:07,616 --> 00:29:09,295
Agent DiNozzo's got point.

520
00:29:20,273 --> 00:29:21,822
All right, this is our bird.

521
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,237
In position.

522
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:27,784
Set.

523
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:48,953
You got a visual <i>on our guy?</i>

524
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,324
Target acquired.

525
00:29:53,451 --> 00:29:54,250
Let's go.

526
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,025
Ziva, switch out of night vision,
this is gonna get bright.

527
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:04,135
Copy.

528
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,264
<i>Put down your weapons.</i>

529
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,603
<i>J.P. Dean, you are under arrest.</i>

530
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,668
Double-crossing son of a...!

531
00:31:03,022 --> 00:31:05,154
So what do you think, Director?

532
00:31:06,136 --> 00:31:07,622
Dean here killed Macy,

533
00:31:08,143 --> 00:31:09,171
killed Bell,

534
00:31:09,707 --> 00:31:12,299
played some part in the shootout
between the cartel members

535
00:31:12,383 --> 00:31:13,555
and Bell's men.

536
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:15,512
Maybe killed Mike Franks.

537
00:31:15,596 --> 00:31:16,756
Dead or alive,

538
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:19,335
are his whereabouts
still undetermined?

539
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:24,549
I did retrieve .45 caliber slugs
from that shootout

540
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,899
in Mexico.

541
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:27,969
It's Mike Franks' weapon of choice.

542
00:31:29,535 --> 00:31:31,707
Yeah, I'm gonna go
double stack the drawers.

543
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:43,153
I fly out to resolve the situation,
only to find it already resolved.

544
00:31:43,428 --> 00:31:45,027
You tell Dean he was in the clear?

545
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:49,115
You tell him that your guy in DC
is going to take care of him?

546
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:50,878
Turns out to be true.

547
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:55,998
If you have bad intentions, Washington
airspace certainly becomes treacherous.

548
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,677
All those bodies.

549
00:31:58,936 --> 00:32:00,398
Dean takes the fall...

550
00:32:02,282 --> 00:32:03,086
Smart.

551
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:04,630
You thought me otherwise?

552
00:32:05,603 --> 00:32:07,792
Never underestimate your opponent.

553
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:09,135
Should write that down.

554
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,082
Except you and I are
on the same side.

555
00:32:13,985 --> 00:32:15,317
You hold the cards.

556
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,426
You and Paloma have Frank, so...

557
00:32:19,627 --> 00:32:21,146
You have your delivery.

558
00:32:21,378 --> 00:32:22,440
You didn't open it?

559
00:32:24,012 --> 00:32:25,276
I didn't need to.

560
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,489
"We have to distrust each other

561
00:32:30,943 --> 00:32:33,187
as our only defense
against betrayal."

562
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:37,048
My sister and her quotes.

563
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,204
You guys have a way of making
a man feel left out.

564
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:41,927
Director Vance.

565
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:45,557
Just trying to soothe
some fractured egos.

566
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:48,183
With Agent Gibbs,
that could be dangerous.

567
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,952
Always a politician?

568
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:52,181
You, of all people,
would understand.

569
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,296
That something from home?

570
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,521
Yes, to sweeten any sour feelings.

571
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:05,900
- What is this?
- Candy.

572
00:33:06,222 --> 00:33:07,234
Handmade.

573
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,405
I'll be on my way.

574
00:33:16,803 --> 00:33:18,873
Unless you have that report for me.

575
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:20,831
You should already have it.

576
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,084
Ms. Sciuto sent it
straight to the task force.

577
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:39,100
<i>If you have bad intentions,</i>

578
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,586
<i>Washington airspace
certainly becomes treacherous.</i>

579
00:33:45,178 --> 00:33:48,321
He's cagey... Alejandro.
Doesn't give anything away.

580
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:49,443
Neither did you.

581
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:51,195
New battery.

582
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:55,819
Here you go.

583
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:01,715
You made it obvious that your hands
were tied without saying.

584
00:34:07,068 --> 00:34:08,087
Couldn't.

585
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,508
I knew this delivery was just a test.
I figured I could buy time.

586
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,386
Put a lot of trust
to that follow-your-lead, Gibbs.

587
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,805
Every day, Leon.

588
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:20,422
You think Mike Franks
is still alive?

589
00:34:21,868 --> 00:34:24,445
I think Mike Franks left
that beach shootout in pieces.

590
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:27,783
Alejandro's lying about something,
I just don't know what.

591
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:28,983
He showed his hand.

592
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:34,139
I've seen enemies
with vendettas, Leon.

593
00:34:34,603 --> 00:34:36,355
Seen people lose
their lives to them.

594
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,903
People that matter.

595
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,011
Worst enemies are the ones
that hide in plain sight.

596
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,191
The ones we can't arrest.

597
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:46,579
You know, there's a story
about Humphrey Bogart on that tour.

598
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:49,148
Might be apocryphal,
but I hope it's true.

599
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:52,415
So he finishes early,
he walks across the street to a bar,

600
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:54,369
still wearing his costume
and his makeup.

601
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:58,218
Couple hours later the director realizes
he needs Bogie for one more shot,

602
00:34:58,903 --> 00:35:01,034
so he sends a production assistant.

603
00:35:01,118 --> 00:35:02,117
Sends a kid

604
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:05,060
to drag Bogie
back onto the cafe set.

605
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:08,101
The director somehow gets him
to the top of the stairs and says,

606
00:35:08,185 --> 00:35:11,692
"All I need you to do
is look over here and nod."

607
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:13,722
- That's it?
- That's it.

608
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:17,990
Bogie nods. One take, he's done.
It's in the movie.

609
00:35:18,406 --> 00:35:21,159
When Victor Laszlo wants the bandleader
to play "La Marseillaise",

610
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:22,953
he looks to Rick for the okay.

611
00:35:25,301 --> 00:35:27,819
It's only the turning point
for the entire character,

612
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,155
where he actually makes a commitment.
He joins the cause.

613
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:33,192
All he had to do was nod.

614
00:35:33,276 --> 00:35:35,132
And that started everything.

615
00:35:36,472 --> 00:35:38,455
You didn't get a copy
of Abby's report.

616
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:39,804
I never saw it.

617
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:43,599
Decades-old cold case in Mexico...
that's not really my business, is it?

618
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,643
Gibbs, if something has
to happen with Alejandro...

619
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:52,817
you don't have to say a word.

620
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:16,583
Your ceremony?

621
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:19,760
- First thing in the morning.
- Then we'll debrief second thing.

622
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,662
It's late.
Go get some rest.

623
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,183
I need a minute.

624
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,069
Sharp suit.

625
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,865
You're clearly supposed
to be somewhere in that sharp suit.

626
00:36:43,563 --> 00:36:44,635
It's all right.

627
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,700
Never known you to hang
around the house dressed like that.

628
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:56,171
What's on your mind?

629
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,386
Do you really believe
in right and wrong?

630
00:37:01,798 --> 00:37:03,043
And enforcing the law?

631
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,593
Putting the bad guys behind bars?

632
00:37:05,677 --> 00:37:07,099
Protecting and serving?

633
00:37:08,886 --> 00:37:10,927
Why, of all things...

634
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:14,006
are you a cop?

635
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:19,612
I hereby...

636
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,974
declare on oath, that I absolutely

637
00:37:23,058 --> 00:37:24,575
and entirely renounce

638
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,868
and abjure

639
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,995
all allegiance and fidelity

640
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:29,955
to any foreign prince...

641
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:36,669
We're both sworn
representatives of the law.

642
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:40,841
And we're both supposed
to uphold the code.

643
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,009
The Constitution and laws

644
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:45,426
of the United States of America,

645
00:37:45,962 --> 00:37:48,641
against all enemies, foreign

646
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,087
and domestic.

647
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,854
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance

648
00:37:54,465 --> 00:37:55,522
to the same.

649
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,358
That I will bear arms on behalf

650
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,443
of the United States when required

651
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,686
by the law.

652
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,987
That I will perform

653
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,906
noncombatant service

654
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,992
in the Armed Forces
of the United States...

655
00:38:07,976 --> 00:38:09,409
I've got my own code.

656
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:12,706
That doesn't work.

657
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,001
This is the bullet
that should end you.

658
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,162
Do you think I want that?

659
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:22,073
I didn't ask you to stop it.

660
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:25,163
What do you want, Allison?

661
00:38:27,187 --> 00:38:28,214
Thank you?

662
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:30,391
An apology?

663
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:33,017
Why the hell not?

664
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:35,277
Because I've got a...

665
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:36,981
rule against it.

666
00:38:38,064 --> 00:38:39,692
Well, it's a stupid rule.

667
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:42,211
Maybe it is.

668
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:44,321
And that I take this obligation

669
00:38:44,904 --> 00:38:47,995
freely,
without any mental reservation

670
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:50,147
or purpose of evasion,

671
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:51,787
so help me God.

672
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,794
I wanted to know who you were.

673
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:01,107
Who you are.

674
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,173
As a person.

675
00:39:12,612 --> 00:39:14,684
Speaking as an officer of the law...

676
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:19,145
I think we could beat it.

677
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,384
<i>Holà.</i>

678
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,503
What's your assignment here?

679
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:42,319
Director's orders...
observe and report.

680
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,601
I'll take it from here, probie.

681
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,809
I can pull
the trigger with my thumb.

682
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:03,123
<i>"Number 44.</i>

683
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:04,735
<i>"First things first.</i>

684
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,570
<i>Hide the women and children."</i>

685
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:08,117
<i>What is this?</i>

686
00:40:09,601 --> 00:40:10,614
<i>Your idea.</i>

687
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:13,705
<i>You're actually writing them down?</i>

688
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:16,390
<i>Why didn't you start
with number one?</i>

689
00:40:17,554 --> 00:40:18,958
<i>Can't I get anything right?</i>

690
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:21,810
<i>Sometimes. I guess.</i>

691
00:40:38,498 --> 00:40:40,062
<i>Back again, Marine?</i>

692
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,055
<i>Not anymore.</i>

693
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,786
<i>It's done.</i>

694
00:40:45,411 --> 00:40:46,656
<i>Not what I heard.</i>

695
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,847
<i>No such thing as an ex-Marine.</i>

696
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,949
<i>That's forever.</i>

697
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:53,820
<i>Right.</i>

698
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,502
<i>Not even gonna ask
where you've been.</i>

699
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:01,610
<i>Guess the question is:</i>

700
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,535
<i>where you going?</i>

701
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:05,832
<i>I don't know.</i>

702

<i>Look at you...</i>

703
00:41:10,689 --> 00:41:13,541
<i>All self-loathing and misery.</i>

704
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,343
<i>You make me sick.</i>

00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:19,136
<i>Come here to mope?</i>

<i>Came for a job.</i>

707
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:24,466
<i>My God.</i>

<i>you got to let
a lot of old stuff go,</i>

710
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,912
<i>learn a lot of new stuff
to take its place.</i>

Can I help you?

714
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,281
Yes, Mr. Gibbs.
