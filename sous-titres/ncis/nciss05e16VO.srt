11
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:37,699
Elvis has left the building.

12
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:38,849
<i>Yeah, we got it.</i>

13
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:40,543
Get in there, DiNozzo.

14
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:45,691
<i>On my way, boss.</i>

15
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:51,699
<i>So where are we going on this...
mystery date?</i>

16
00:01:51,974 --> 00:01:54,865
Well, it wouldn't be
a mystery if I told you, Gina.

17
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:58,318
Should I have brought my toothbrush?

18
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:02,886
Going right on Connecticut.

19
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:05,677
- You left the bar early last night.
- Yes.

20
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:08,374
My husband was calling from Fallujah.

21
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:12,453
- What did you do when I left?
- Nothing.

22
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:14,424
Went home, went to bed.

23
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:16,138
Should I get on the expressway?

24
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,532
Nope.

25
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:21,318
I like a man who keeps secrets.

26
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:27,470
- What's the gap?
<i>- Almost two blocks.</i>

27
00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:57,675
<i>- Boss...</i>
- You done?

28
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,099
Don't need the bugs, boss,
got Hoffman's latest victim.

29
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:01,461
<i>Number five.</i>

30
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,117
<i>Female Caucasian,
mid to late twenties.</i>

31
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:06,066
Dead on the living room floor.

32
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:07,571
<i>What about the finger?</i>

33
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:11,055
<i>Yep, missing a finger.</i>

34
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,779
Call Ziva... give her the distress code.
Tell her we're taking Hoffman down now.

35
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,359
Hello.

36
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,683
Bernard?

37
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,621
No, you've got the wrong number.

38
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,075
If you're not
going to tell me where we are going,

39
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:36,889
I'm gonna need a ladies' room.

40
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,905
- What are you doing?
- Who's Gibbs?

41
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:44,859
Wrong number.

42
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:46,973
His name's number
<i>two on your speed dial.</i>

43
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,035
He was an ex-boyfriend, okay?

44
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:51,911
Can I have my phone back, please?

45
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:55,003
Drive.

46
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:01,254
<i>They just turned west.</i>

47
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:15,142
<i>All right, the car is stopped
two blocks ahead.</i>

48
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:28,738
You're a cop, aren't you?

49
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,815
Why did you kill those women, Andy?

50
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:33,327
For their husbands.

51
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:34,846
<i>Save them the humiliation</i>

52
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,448
<i>of finding out that their wives
were screwing around on them</i>

53
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,444
while they were serving their country.

54
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,604
Is that what happened to you?

55
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:44,146
You don't need to know
what happened to me.

56
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:47,976
Walk.

57
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:04,346
Get in there.

58
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:45,699
<i>Ziva!</i>

59
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:49,393
<i>Ziva.</i>

60
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:54,079
<i>Come on.</i>

61
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,379
You all right?

62
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,354
Sorry.

63
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:20,337
She should go for X-ray.

64
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:21,680
I am fine.

65
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:23,438
You don't look fine.

66
00:06:23,562 --> 00:06:26,104
Well, don't stand there,
Mr. Palmer, get the gurney.

67
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:28,355
<i>- Yes, doctor.</i>
- He did not hurt me.

68
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:31,883
Need your clothes.

69
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:33,092
Get changed,

70
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:34,427
<i>get an X-ray</i>,

71
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,327
go home.

72
00:06:36,316 --> 00:06:38,299
I don't need to see you again today.

73
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:57,622
<i>Where the hell are you, McTardy?</i>
I'm still here alone with the dead body.

74
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,882
We're still processing our own, Tony.
We'll be there soon <i>as we can</i>.

75
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:01,884
How's Ziva?

76
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,088
Pretty shaken up.

77
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:07,652
- <i>Keep me updated.</i>
- I will.

78
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,134
Finally got the dirtbag.

79
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:13,857
<i>His name's Andrew Hoffman.</i>
You heard of him?

80
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:15,763
No.

81
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:17,726
But I hear you've got another body.

82
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:19,311
Victim number five.

83
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:20,687
Military wife?

84
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:21,939
Don't know yet.

85
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:25,647
- How'd you get on to Hoffman?
<i>- Officer David</i>

86
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,770
was working undercover in the bar
where two of the victims were last seen.

87
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:32,701
Planning to do the same thing ourselves
if you guys hadn't taken over the case.

88
00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:35,418
You know, Rosetti,
I don't think Hoffman is your type.

89
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,274
Nice work, David.

90
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,847
I'll get someone to take
you to the hospital.

91
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,467
I can give you a lift.

92
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:56,932
No, I'm fine, Detective.

93
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:01,355
I'm fine, really, thank you.

94
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,205
I told you to go home.

95
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,232
<i>My statement is on your desk.</i>

96
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:28,966
Have you identified the last victim?

97
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:30,358
No.

98
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:38,495
I thought I would go back
to the bar where I met Hoffman,

99
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:39,897
<i>show the victim's photo.</i>

100
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,043
Do you have a face shot?

101
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:45,311
Yeah, I'll print one.

102
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:50,942
You stay with her, DiNozzo.

103
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:52,696
<i>Okay.</i>

104
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:57,982
What?

105
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,457
You don't look so bad.

106
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:02,080
McGee said you were a wreck.

107
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:07,800
I was just gonna tussle your hair.

108
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:10,847
Sometimes it makes you smile.

109
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:14,684
Sorry.

110
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:17,314
<i>A fifth, still unidentified victim</i>

111
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:20,185
<i>was found this afternoon
inside Hoffman's home.</i>

112
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:23,440
<i>His shooting death by an
undercover NCIS agent</i>

113
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:26,366
<i>ends the series of brutal murders
of military wives</i>

114
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,915
<i>found in war memorials around DC.</i>

115
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,406
<i>The murders have been taking
place over the last two months...</i>

116
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:36,583
<i>- I'll take the bartender.</i>
- Her name is Heidi.

117
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,277
Hidey-ho.

118
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:42,456
Gina, you hear about Andy Hoffman,

119
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,984
- guy that sits at the end of the bar?
- Yes.

120
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:46,939
You were just talking
to him the other night.

121
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,674
- Can you believe he would...
- Michael.

122
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:51,135
My name is, not Gina.

123
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:53,192
<i>My name is Ziva.</i>

124
00:09:55,363 --> 00:09:57,458
You're an undercover cop?
<i>That... that was you?</i>

125
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,125
I'm a federal agent, actually.

126
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:02,075
Holy crap... You never...

127
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,973
<i>So when you were chatting me up,</i>
you were...

128
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,460
I mean, you thought I might be...

129
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:09,503
- Michael, I was doing my job.
- Sure,

130
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:11,946
just doing your job.

131
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:13,774
<i>Have you ever seen this woman before?</i>

132
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:14,971
<i>She's dead?</i>

133
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:18,405
She was never in here on my shift.

134
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:20,498
She's the one they found
at Hoffman's house?

135
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,234
Yes, she is.

136
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:24,686
- Did you ever talk to him?
- All the time.

137
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,310
Actually gives me the creeps
thinking about it.

138
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:30,266
There's a couple of guys in here
I would've suspected before him.

139
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:31,946
He ever mentioned his ex-wife?

140
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:34,412
- I didn't know he was married.
- Interesting...

141
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,052
You know who that guy
is over there<i> in the corner?</i>

142
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:38,308
<i>With Gina?</i>

143
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:40,006
His name is Michael.

144
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,369
<i>What's his story?</i>

145
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:44,956
<i>Michael used to come in here
all the time with his girlfriend.</i>

146
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,176
She walked out on him a few weeks ago,
and he hasn't been able to find her.

147
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:51,778
<i>This girl's name is Julie.</i>

148
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:54,816
I don't know her surname.
<i>I talked to her once or twice.</i>

149
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:57,929
I thought maybe she knew Devon,
my girlfriend... ex.

150
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:02,260
I still haven't found her...
it's been three weeks.

151
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,823
You don't think Hoffman...

152
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,682
I mean, you think they're
gonna find more bodies?

153
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:11,432
I hope not.

154
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:13,429
I'm worried.

155
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:16,160
She used to be married to a Navy SEAL...
it fits the profile.

156
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,044
Did he do that?

157
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:28,468
<i>Name's Julie Ann Smight.</i>

158
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:31,411
Employer filed a missing person
with the Chevy Chase PD this morning.

159
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:33,196
- She married?
<i>- Yeah, to...</i>

160
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:35,436
<i>Petty Officer First Class Donald Smight.</i>

161
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,175
<i>He's aboard the U.S.S. Eisenhower.</i>

162
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:40,517
She was last seen two nights ago,
<i>leaving a lounge on U Street...</i>

163
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:41,777
alone.

164
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,643
Petty Officer Massey's here <i>to pick up
his wife's personal belongings.</i>

165
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:56,321
How you holding up?

166
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:57,959
I'm all right, I guess.

167
00:11:58,722 --> 00:11:59,995
Hope you don't mind, ma'am,

168
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:02,175
<i>but I asked Special Agent DiNozzo
to bring me up here.</i>

169
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:06,473
I wanted to thank you personally
for killing that bastard.

170
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:10,145
I hope you made him
suffer for what he did.

171
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:14,039
DiNozzo,

172
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:17,019
take Petty Officer Massey
down to the evidence locker.

173
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,380
Will do. This way.

174
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,332
<i>Hey.</i>

175
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:38,572
- What do you want, Duck?
- Jethro.

176
00:12:38,731 --> 00:12:42,159
I've reviewed the autopsies
of the first four victims,

177
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:44,947
and I'm currently examining the fifth.

178
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:46,573
All four were stabbed

179
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,801
in the same manner with the same knife.

180
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:51,197
In all five, tox screens show

181
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,982
large amounts of Rohypnol
<i>and alcohol.</i>

182
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:54,985
<i>But</i>

183
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:58,563
<i>in regard to the fingers,
or lack thereof...</i>

184
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:04,171
<i>... I found a curious inconsistency.</i>

185
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:05,905
Four of the five

186
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:07,781
were severed postmortem.

187
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:09,899
Based on lividity <i>and blood flow,</i>

188
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,575
I'd estimate several hours after death.

189
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:16,251
<i>But the finger of fourth victim...</i>

190
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:19,536
was cut off almost immediately.

191
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:22,450
Maybe someone interrupted
him so he had to rush to finish it.

192
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:30,254
<i>Abby, what are you doing?</i>

193
00:13:30,484 --> 00:13:31,789
Efficiency, Gibbs.

194
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:35,347
I took off 14 and a half seconds from
what it usually takes me to get here.

195
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:38,631
So, I estimate that I could gain
17 minutes a day.

196
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:41,797
<i>That would be 85 minutes in a week.</i>

197
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:44,638
382 minutes in a month.
So, in a year...

198
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:45,493
Abs.

199
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:47,082
Yes, Gibbs?

200
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,155
Is that knife gonna tell me something?

201
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:51,673
<i>Yes and no.</i>

202
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:55,765
I mean, it definitely is the serrated
knife that severed the victims' fingers.

203
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:56,774
But?

204
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:58,882
But, I found a

205
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,420
partial print in blood on the handle.

206
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:03,765
It doesn't match Hoffman
or the other victims.

207
00:14:04,488 --> 00:14:06,666
I don't think Hoffman was working alone.

208
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,209
Die, you stupid machine!

209
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,195
<i>She seems unfazed.</i>

210
00:14:17,474 --> 00:14:20,982
Those are standard Mossad style
copy machine assault tactics, McGee.

211
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:22,329
<i>She's fine.</i>

212
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,071
Hey, McGee thinks you're
raging against the machine

213
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:27,568
'cause you had to take down
your serial killer boyfriend.

214
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:31,178
Thanks for that.

215
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,946
Ziva, I was just concerned...

216
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:36,326
- I am fine.
<i>- See?</i> McGee?

217
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,410
She's a steely-eyed killer.

218
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:39,673
Sheket bevakasha!

219
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:41,524
I don't know him.
Borscht-belt comedian?

220
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:43,115
It is Hebrew. For shut up.

221
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:44,683
Really did affect you?

222
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:47,094
Have you had your mandatory
session with the shrink?

223
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:49,979
Yes.

224
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,450
Still crazy, then?

225
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:55,035
Getting off your case.

226
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:56,972
Well, you can stay on this one.

227
00:14:57,092 --> 00:15:00,336
Abby found a partial print on the murder
weapon<i> that does not match our killer.</i>

228
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:02,176
Hoffman had an accomplice?

229
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:04,753
- That's one explanation.
- Could be a copycat killer.

230
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:06,992
Copycats copy.
They don't use the same weapon.

231
00:15:07,998 --> 00:15:10,953
<i>Re-examine the crime scene,
canvass Hoffman's neighborhood,</i>

232
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:13,450
<i>take another look
at the surveillance video.</i>

233
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:14,688
Tomorrow.

234
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:17,309
Go home.

235
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:18,744
Been a long day.

236
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,457
Get some rest.

237
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:22,579
You.

238
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:26,767
I do not need to see you here tomorrow.

239
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:33,707
<i>Anyone want to, get a drink?</i>

240
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:38,651
Drink?

241
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,247
Not tonight, Tony.

242
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:45,542
<i>Listen.</i>

243
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:48,365
I wasn't trying to make light
of what you went through.

244
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:51,186
Just trying to snap you out
of your head space, you know?

245
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:53,750
I have perfectly good space in my head.

246
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:54,863
Great.

247
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:56,265
Then let's get a drink.

248
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,753
You talk, I'll listen.

249
00:15:58,012 --> 00:15:59,416
I don't want a drink.

250
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:00,679
Okay.

251
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:04,174
One drink. I'll talk, you listen.

252
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,218
Tony.

253
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:06,557
No.

254
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:18,164
Let me buy you the next one.

255
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:21,117
<i>- You working?</i>
- No.

256
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:24,695
No, really. I'm not working.

257
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:25,954
<i>Just...</i>

258
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:27,031
drinking.

259
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:28,308
<i>Heidi!</i>

260
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:29,694
Uno más, s'il vous plaît.

261
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:31,562
- <i>Coming up!</i>
- You're mixing your languages.

262
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:32,850
And my liquors.

263
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:35,790
Not exactly the place to
come if you're not on the case.

264
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,499
<i>There's a thousand bars in this town.</i>

265
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:40,302
I like the atmosphere. And Heidi...

266
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:43,016
makes one killer mojito.

267
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:45,879
I thought maybe you took
a shine to one of the patrons.

268
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:50,161
And you?

269
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:51,792
You are here, no doubt,

270
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:53,577
in search of Debbie?

271
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:54,954
Devon.

272
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,486
Potato, potahto.

273
00:16:57,721 --> 00:17:00,117
Yeah, well, not searching.
Just drinking.

274
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:10,445
<i>So, tell me about Debbie.</i>

275
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:11,757
Just kidding.

276
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:13,187
Devon.

277
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,348
Very pretty.

278
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,480
And smart.

279
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:17,482
Funny.

280
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:19,861
Terrible sense of direction.

281
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:23,130
Drive you insane with
her incessant movie references.

282
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:27,190
Worries about others more than herself.
Generous to a fault.

283
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,021
No wonder you're looking for her.

284
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:30,641
She sounds <i>amazing.</i>

285
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:34,699
Other than the fact that we were totally
incompatible, Devon was perfect for me.

286
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,616
You miss her?

287
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:39,108
I'm not looking to get back
with her. I just...

288
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:40,540
want to know she's okay.

289
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,318
I'm going to help you.

290
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:44,890
You already have.

291
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,010
How so?

292
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:47,884
By killing Hoffman.

293
00:17:48,122 --> 00:17:49,547
<i>One less nightmare.</i>

294
00:17:55,303 --> 00:17:56,460
You okay?

295
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,040
Never better.

296
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,407
- Thought you were taking the day.
- Gibbs' idea. Not mine.

297
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:22,518
That Hoffman?

298
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,756
Yeah, I'm reviewing the tapes.

299
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:28,601
Victim number three?

300
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:30,825
<i>Monica Bishop, judging by the dress.</i>

301
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:32,489
Look at this guy here.

302
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,970
<i>He's watching 'em.</i>

303
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:37,887
If Hoffman had an accomplice,
he could very well be him.

304
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:41,181
Or he could just be a passerby.

305
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:43,674
<i>There he goes.</i>

306
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:50,026
<i>Look, he's heading in the same direction
Hoffman took the girl.</i>

307
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:52,092
Or he could be going to a bar.

308
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,849
Or he was checking to make
sure no one was following them,

309
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:57,369
before joining Hoffman
and killing the woman.

310
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:00,100
That's got to be Hoffman's accomplice.

311
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:04,742
Man without a face.

312
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:07,232
<i>Spoke to the neighbors.
They barely knew Hoffman.</i>

313
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:09,630
- Guy was an enigma.
- Well, he still is.

314
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,693
Found a stack of photos, too.
Not a woman in any of them. Just

315
00:19:12,864 --> 00:19:15,053
Hoffman and his Marine buddies.

316
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:17,279
Any one of 'em a potential accomplice.

317
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,815
Good a place to start as any.

318
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:20,972
Gibbs, I thought we closed the case
on this one.

319
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:24,829
Yeah, found a partial print on Hoffman's
knife that doesn't belong to him.

320
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:26,903
Most serial killers work alone.

321
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:28,728
Yeah. Most.

322
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:31,379
<i>Wouldn't be the first time
a killer worked with a partner.</i>

323
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,395
<i>You got the Cook brothers,</i>
Eric and Lyle Menendez...

324
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,684
<i>I wouldn't get too excited</i>

325
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:38,082
about a partial print on a knife...
it could be anything.

326
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:40,404
<i>I need to review all
the evidence you have.</i>

327
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:42,597
<i>I already given you everything
I think is relevant.</i>

328
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:45,027
Well, then give me everything
you think isn't.

329
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:48,445
Gibbs, you've got your killer,
you've got all your bodies...

330
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:51,349
Most of the bodies.{\ We're still missing } Five of the fingers
that he cut off the victims are missing.

331
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,093
Doesn't mean that
there's a second killer.

332
00:19:53,176 --> 00:19:55,426
Well, maybe Hoffman
kept the bodies as a prize,

333
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:57,696
and his accomplice
got to keep the fingers.

334
00:19:57,855 --> 00:19:58,960
<i>DiNozzo.</i>

335
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:00,482
You were a cop.

336
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:03,653
Tell your boss what it's like to have
20 open case files on your desk.

337
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:06,366
You know what, Rosetti?
I don't care if you've got a hundred.

338
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:08,763
There could still be a killer out there.

339
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:31,163
Well, I hope you weren't looking for me.

340
00:20:31,283 --> 00:20:33,016
Is that really what you are hoping?

341
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,306
Not even close.

342
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:37,296
You know, I could,
buy you a drink, or...

343
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:38,553
Or what?

344
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:40,142
You could come home with me.

345
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:42,494
Why would I do that?

346
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:44,997
Because you feel guilty
about lying to me.

347
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:47,496
Or because you just
killed somebody and...

348
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:48,953
<i>need someone to hug.</i>

349
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:52,666
Why do I have the feeling that you
are angling for more than just a hug?

350
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,191
Angling? No.

351
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:56,081
Hoping?

352
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:01,106
Have you been telling me the truth
about your girlfriend?

353
00:21:01,238 --> 00:21:04,306
Or are you just
taking advantage of my raw

354
00:21:04,522 --> 00:21:05,803
emotional state?

355
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:06,966
Yes.

356
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:08,421
And...

357
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:10,303
yes.

358
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:34,491
<i>No, easy. Easy.</i>
Just reaching for my glasses.

359
00:21:37,155 --> 00:21:38,745
You should not do that to me.

360
00:21:51,494 --> 00:21:52,535
<i>Look...</i>

361
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:56,235
... I don't usually
do this kind of thing.

362
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:57,904
Neither do I.

363
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,971
Is that the gun you shot Hoffman with?

364
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,347
No.

365
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:08,469
We struggled and then I...

366
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:10,399
No, it's not the gun.

367
00:22:11,811 --> 00:22:12,782
So,

368
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:16,045
what's it like to shoot someone?

369
00:22:17,014 --> 00:22:18,268
It is what it is.

370
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:20,824
It is what you have to do.

371
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,833
These are not things I dwell upon.

372
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:32,060
Were you scared?

373
00:22:34,157 --> 00:22:35,097
No.

374
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,873
Sorry. That's a...
That's a dumb question.

375
00:22:37,918 --> 00:22:40,872
I guess you wouldn't be an NCIS
agent if you had a problem with it.

376
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:43,209
I'm not an NCIS agent.

377
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:46,231
I am Israeli Mossad.

378
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,849
Guessing Hoffman's not
the first guy you've...

379
00:22:57,863 --> 00:23:00,775
Why does everyone think
all Mossad agents are assassins?

380
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:03,197
Are you?

381
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,762
You know,

382
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:09,681
I've never handled a gun before.

383
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:12,553
Well, you're not
going to handle one now.

384
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:17,439
Well, I guess I'll just
have to handle something else.

385
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,930
I've re-sampled the image
as many times as I can, McGee.

386
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:39,072
<i>Try removing compression artifacts.</i>

387
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:41,029
It's too pixelated.

388
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:43,246
Did you try detecting edges?

389
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:46,192
I am detecting an edge.

390
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:48,867
I'm good,
McGee, but I can't work miracles.

391
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:50,038
<i>This is impossible.</i>

392
00:23:50,071 --> 00:23:52,212
<i>I've told you once,</i>
I've told you a thousand times...

393
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:54,808
There is no substitute
for quality source imagery. I know.

394
00:23:56,557 --> 00:23:57,899
Where are you going?

395
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,555
I am going back to work.

396
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,642
Well, you think I'm going to give up
that easily? You think I'm a quitter?

397
00:24:02,704 --> 00:24:05,989
You, of all people should know
that I thrive in the face of adversity.

398
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,998
You're making the face of adversity.

399
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:18,258
I found each of the victim's
blood on the murder weapon.

400
00:24:18,838 --> 00:24:20,842
Hoffman didn't clean
the knife after each murder?

401
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,199
No, he did meticulously.

402
00:24:23,437 --> 00:24:26,472
But I found trace evidence
where the blade goes into the handle.

403
00:24:26,741 --> 00:24:30,593
<i>Okay, look, four of the victims
have blood type O-positive.</i>

404
00:24:31,023 --> 00:24:33,733
The fifth victim <i>has
blood type A- positive</i>.

405
00:24:33,781 --> 00:24:34,968
That's not that strange.

406
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:37,379
Most killers don't chose
their victims by blood type.

407
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:39,304
No, no, that's not what's strange.

408
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:41,863
I also found traces <i>of a B-positive</i>.

409
00:24:42,077 --> 00:24:43,667
Then it must be Hoffman's blood.

410
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:45,465
No.

411
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:47,184
He's O-negative.

412
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:48,335
Not a match.

413
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:50,398
There's a sixth victim, McGee.

414
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,450
Whose body hasn't been found yet.

415
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,612
<i>Did she leave any forwarding
number or address?</i>

416
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:01,480
<i>- No, I'm afraid she didn't.</i>
- Okay.

417
00:25:02,108 --> 00:25:03,969
<i>Well, if she makes contact,</i>

418
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,799
will you please notify me?

419
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,192
- Thank you.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

420
00:25:09,646 --> 00:25:10,700
What are you doing?

421
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,062
Checking into Locke's
missing girlfriend.<i> You?</i>

422
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:14,515
Same.

423
00:25:14,635 --> 00:25:15,459
What?

424
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:16,776
Why?

425
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:19,313
Devon Linden Katz.

426
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:21,318
Yeah, not like the musical.

427
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:23,064
Starts with a K, ends with a Z.

428
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:24,757
Thanks. All right.

429
00:25:25,472 --> 00:25:26,807
Checking her medical records.

430
00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:29,673
What, you think she's been lying
in some hospital, unable to communicate?

431
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:32,549
No. I think she's been lying in a
shallow grave, unable to communicate.

432
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:34,669
Medical records are
privileged information.

433
00:25:34,722 --> 00:25:35,858
You need a subpoena.

434
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:37,097
Not if you have an IOU.

435
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:40,188
from a county clerk <i>with
a very expressive poker face. Hey.</i>

436
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,282
There it is.
Thanks, Laramie. I owe you.

437
00:25:43,402 --> 00:25:45,380
Well, not as much as you owe me,
of course.

438
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,344
Right.

439
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,978
Guess what Locke's
girlfriend's blood type is?

440
00:25:49,205 --> 00:25:51,621
The same blood type Abby
found on the knife... B-positive.

441
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:54,535
Although it's hard to be positive
when the news is so negative.

442
00:25:55,007 --> 00:25:56,381
Millions have that blood type.

443
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:58,436
Only ten percent of Americans
have that blood type.

444
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:01,607
So you have narrowed it down to what,
millions?

445
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:04,383
Narrows it down a lot further
when you consider that she was a regular

446
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:07,020
at the bar frequented
by two other victims.

447
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:09,458
She could easily be victim number six.

448
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:12,371
And your pal Locke could be her killer.

449
00:26:12,668 --> 00:26:14,731
- He is not a killer.
- Okay.

450
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:18,139
Co-killer,
<i>assistant killer, killer's apprentice.</i>

451
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,163
Michael was not involved in the murders.

452
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:21,469
Michael?

453
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,783
That is his name.

454
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:25,806
That is his first name.

455
00:26:28,332 --> 00:26:29,333
You didn't.

456
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:31,274
Don't tell me.

457
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:36,692
- Okay, tell me.
<i>- What I did</i>

458
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:39,926
or did not do is none of your business.

459
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,893
Detective Rosetti, morning.

460
00:26:57,836 --> 00:27:00,997
Here are the case files
your boss wanted.

461
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,711
Sorry.

462
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,966
- Hoffman's car.
<i>- Yep.</i>

463
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:14,388
<i>All 786 square feet of</i>
dustable surface.

464
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:16,012
You find anything?

465
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:20,180
$3.50 in change.
An impressive gum wrapper collection.

466
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,187
<i>All right.</i>
Thanks for the files, Detective.

467
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:24,502
You want the rest?

468
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,894
You guys wanted everything.

469
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,616
<i>Here's everything.</i>

470
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,076
You didn't happen to make a digital
catalogue of all the evidence, did you?

471
00:27:39,161 --> 00:27:40,342
Digital catalogue?

472
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:42,770
<i>- That's a good one.</i>
- Okay.

473
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:44,390
<i>Four boxes,</i>

474
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:47,229
<i>four bags of evidence,
four bags of personal effects.</i>

475
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,007
I am going to be here forever.

476
00:27:49,048 --> 00:27:51,280
This one has your
name written all over it.

477
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:52,502
Thank you.

478
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,048
<i>Got an address book.</i>

479
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:57,791
That's great.

480
00:27:57,911 --> 00:28:00,906
So far, <i>all of the prints from the car
they match Hoffman.</i>

481
00:28:01,198 --> 00:28:03,077
<i>There's just no sign of an accomplice.</i>

482
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:04,511
What about the video still?

483
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:06,380
I have tried everything.

484
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:08,308
I just... I can't get an ID.

485
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,911
You're admitting defeat?

486
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:11,091
No.

487
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:14,177
I have a new tactical plan.

488
00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:19,866
By triangulating <i>the heights
of the landmarks.</i>

489
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,665
<i>Like the street lights
and cars and stuff.</i>

490
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,883
I think I can figure out an
approximate height and weight

491
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,029
of Hoffman's alleged accomplice.

492
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:28,098
<i>It's great.</i>

493
00:28:28,218 --> 00:28:29,445
There's a page missing.

494
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:31,153
Torn out.

495
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:33,841
That's why the pages fell.
Someone tore out the binding.

496
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:36,167
Why would someone tear out a page?

497
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,725
How tall is your buddy Locke?

498
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:46,495
About six-one, six-two.

499
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,057
How much do you think he weighs?

500
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:50,020
Why do you ask?

501
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:51,486
Why don't you answer?

502
00:28:51,536 --> 00:28:53,229
170, 180.

503
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,545
Abby calculated
the height and the weight

504
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:59,326
of the mystery man on the surveillance
video. Six-one, 180, just like Locke.

505
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,390
Well, the only thing that
proves is that you are jealous.

506
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,833
<i>I'm concerned.</i>

507
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,551
<i>Slim build, just like Locke.</i>

508
00:29:06,532 --> 00:29:09,981
Of course, with your hands-on experience
last night, maybe you could elaborate.

509
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,290
Saw you two leaving the bar together.

510
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,478
- You followed me?
- Don't flatter yourself.

511
00:29:15,683 --> 00:29:17,872
You do look good <i>on the
surveillance video, though.</i>

512
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:19,593
Adds about ten pounds.

513
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:26,475
<i>Come with me My love...</i>

514
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:29,370
<i>Address book belonged to Monica Bishop,
victim number three.</i>

515
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:32,380
- Missing page is from the Rs.
- Pull up her phone records.

516
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:36,716
<i>I want to tell you.
Just how much I...</i>

517
00:29:36,865 --> 00:29:39,113
"Sea of Love", boss.
<i>Remember that movie?</i>

518
00:29:39,305 --> 00:29:42,464
<i>Al Pacino plays a cop, sleeps with
a serial killer played by Ellen Barkin?</i>

519
00:29:42,608 --> 00:29:45,412
But the zany twist here is,
Ziva's Pacino, and Locke is Barkin.

520
00:29:45,532 --> 00:29:47,721
- Might even be biting.
- Shut your trap, DiNozzo!

521
00:29:47,841 --> 00:29:49,499
Am I missing something here?

522
00:29:51,768 --> 00:29:53,146
<i>Boss, I got it.</i>

523
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:56,991
<i>Matching calls Bishop sent or received</i>
over the past year against the letter R.

524
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:59,497
<i>Reeves, Rexon, Richards.</i>

525
00:29:59,704 --> 00:30:00,706
Rosetti.

526
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:04,248
<i>Over a two-week period last year,
Rosetti called Bishop five times.</i>

527
00:30:04,258 --> 00:30:06,441
Rosetti never said boo
about knowing the third victim.

528
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:08,400
He's covering for something.
Bring him in.

529
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:12,472
You know the ramifications
of tampering with evidence?

530
00:30:13,088 --> 00:30:15,718
- What are you talking about?
- Belonged to Monica Bishop.

531
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:17,872
Victim number three.

532
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:21,933
You forget?

533
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,665
Nobody knows this case
better than me, Gibbs.

534
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:28,822
Well,<i> I'm guessing</i>

535
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,588
<i>you knew Monica</i> more than a little bit.

536
00:30:32,235 --> 00:30:36,088
That why you <i>tore the page out of
this with your name and address on it?</i>

537
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,869
How did it go down, Chris?

538
00:30:41,568 --> 00:30:44,799
Did you meet Hoffman in the same bar
where you met Monica Bishop?

539
00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:48,518
What was your beef?

540
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:50,805
<i>Rejection?</i>

541
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:53,116
Jealousy?

542
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:55,492
Impotency?

543
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,919
I had an affair with Monica Bishop.

544
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:01,148
End of story.

545
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:03,980
Feels more like the middle,
actually.

546
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,039
Did you help Hoffman, or you just watch?

547
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:10,744
Go to hell, Gibbs.

548
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,811
<i>You got the wrong story.</i>

549
00:31:14,054 --> 00:31:15,143
Put me straight.

550
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:18,380
I met her at that bar<i> six months ago.</i>

551
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,276
<i>She was a fixture there.</i>

552
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,983
You could drag a dozen guys in here
who slept with her.

553
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:24,442
She had it coming?

554
00:31:24,562 --> 00:31:26,112
<i>It was just an affair.</i>

555
00:31:26,246 --> 00:31:27,246
No big deal.

556
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,164
Yeah? Then why'd you hide it?

557
00:31:30,823 --> 00:31:32,641
She was married, I was married.

558
00:31:33,031 --> 00:31:36,501
You don't tamper with evidence because
your afraid your wife's gonna see it.

559
00:31:39,787 --> 00:31:42,473
If my captain found out
I slept with her,

560
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:46,237
- he would have taken me off the case.
- Well, he should have.

561
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:48,216
I wanted to catch this guy.

562
00:31:48,336 --> 00:31:49,824
You were getting laid.

563
00:31:50,271 --> 00:31:53,020
- You wanted to protect your ass.
- No.

564
00:31:53,451 --> 00:31:55,218
I wanted the scumbag dead!

565
00:31:55,823 --> 00:31:57,889
<i>I was investigating
the first two murders</i>

566
00:31:58,197 --> 00:32:00,615
before she turned up
as the third victim.

567
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:03,374
<i>If you guys hadn't taken over this case,</i>

568
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:06,675
I would have caught Hoffman,
and I would have popped him.

569
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:07,879
Gladly.

570
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,669
<i>Gibbs doesn't think
Rosetti's the killer.</i>

571
00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:23,724
Neither do I.

572
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:25,982
Guess that just leaves your boyfriend.

573
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:23,923
You got to stop staring
at this one, Ziva.

574
00:33:36,523 --> 00:33:37,952
Put it behind you.

575
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,368
- You seeing Locke?
- You have a problem with that?

576
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:50,765
I do if he's a suspect.

577
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:52,579
- Is he?
- You tell me.

578
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:58,441
Look, if you're going to give
me a lecture on my bad judgment,

579
00:33:58,492 --> 00:34:00,092
I don't need to hear it.

580
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:01,754
Is that what this is about?

581
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,724
You doubting your judgment?

582
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:05,437
I should've moved earlier.

583
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:07,156
You would've if you could've.

584
00:34:07,616 --> 00:34:10,108
- I left it too late.
<i>- You still took him out.</i>

585
00:34:12,543 --> 00:34:13,838
I almost died.

586
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,148
But you didn't.

587
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:20,618
You've got to trust your judgment, Ziva.

588
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,040
<i>Moment you don't...</i>

589
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,897
... it won't be "almost".

590
00:34:38,332 --> 00:34:39,568
<i>Devon, it's me.</i>

591
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,381
<i>Did you tell Michael about us yet?</i>

592
00:34:41,597 --> 00:34:44,502
<i>'Cause if you meant what you said
last night, it's over between you two.</i>

593
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,155
<i>You've got to tell him about us.</i>

594
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:47,869
<i>'Cause if you don't, I will.</i>

595
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,566
- Who is he?
<i>- Don't know yet.</i>

596
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,789
It's a deleted message
from Devon Katz's phone.

597
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:53,946
Locke's missing girlfriend.

598
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,932
<i>Mystery voice was obviously</i>
begging her to dump Locke.

599
00:34:57,348 --> 00:34:59,801
- How did we get the recording?
- Tell him, McSneaky.

600
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:01,614
Accessed the phone provider's mainframe.

601
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:02,833
What we got on him?

602
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,645
<i>He's been hanging out at the bar</i>
where two of the victims were last seen.

603
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:08,197
We can tie him to Hoffman.
Bartender says they were friendly.

604
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:10,864
Locke reported Devon
Katz missing two weeks ago.

605
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,087
- Covering his tracks.
- No trace of her.

606
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,948
Her blood type was B-positive.

607
00:35:14,992 --> 00:35:17,553
Same as the blood type
Abby found on the knife.

608
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,907
Victim six?

609
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:21,045
My guess is Locke found
out she was bouncy-bouncy

610
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:23,701
- with some other guy and he killed her.
- You're wrong.

611
00:35:24,427 --> 00:35:26,287
You've got to look
at this objectively, Ziva.

612
00:35:26,328 --> 00:35:27,710
Evidence says he's guilty.

613
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,122
All circumcised.

614
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:30,552
Circumstantial.

615
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,803
I think she knows
what she's talking about.

616
00:35:38,128 --> 00:35:39,615
His print is on the barrel.

617
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:43,258
- What are you doing?
- Trusting my judgment.

618
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:50,672
<i>Come on, you big band of belted butyl.</i>

619
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,577
Good.

620
00:35:58,985 --> 00:36:00,472
I could use some help here.

621
00:36:01,717 --> 00:36:03,245
Not tired of those things yet?

622
00:36:05,738 --> 00:36:07,240
Hold this, carefully.

623
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:08,851
Locke's fingerprint's on it.

624
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:10,028
Roll aside.

625
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:12,705
Man's work.

626
00:36:17,246 --> 00:36:18,221
Heavy.

627
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:26,371
Thank you.

628
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,602
<i>Oh my...</i>

629
00:36:31,987 --> 00:36:32,813
What?

630
00:36:44,543 --> 00:36:46,484
<i>You brought me here for a reason.</i>

631
00:36:48,886 --> 00:36:50,238
I need some answers.

632
00:36:51,727 --> 00:36:54,048
I thought you said you
wanted to put this behind you.

633
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:09,666
- How long is this gonna take?
- Just a few minutes.

634
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:11,444
You match the fingers
to the victims yet?

635
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:13,033
I'm working on it, Gibbs.

636
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:15,444
Did you call Ziva?

637
00:37:15,564 --> 00:37:17,014
<i>Not answering, boss.</i>

638
00:37:17,284 --> 00:37:19,328
<i>Okay. So this one...</i>

639
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,370
No-brainer, easy to match.

640
00:37:21,493 --> 00:37:24,252
<i>I've always really liked this color.</i>
It's called Arctic Blue.

641
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:25,708
And the rest?

642
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:27,938
Well, I'll give you a hand, Abby.

643
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:29,595
It shouldn't take us long.

644
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,990
So what went wrong?

645
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,082
<i>Waited too long.</i>

646
00:37:35,146 --> 00:37:36,861
I should have moved faster.

647
00:37:40,756 --> 00:37:42,248
Right about here...

648
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:47,383
There was nowhere left to go.

649
00:37:51,784 --> 00:37:53,436
And we fell onto the floor.

650
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:57,837
We struggled, and then I pushed him off.

651
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:00,459
<i>Jethro, based on blood type,</i>

652
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:03,512
skin tone, angle of cut,
I am 95% certain

653
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:06,958
that these belong to victims
<i>one, two, three and five.</i>

654
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:09,598
As you recall,
victim number four's finger,

655
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,440
<i>unlike the others,
was severed immediately after death.</i>

656
00:38:13,596 --> 00:38:15,506
<i>Copycat theory sounding
pretty good, boss.</i>

657
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,776
Whoever killed number four
knew to cut off the finger,

658
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:19,855
but didn't know Hoffman
was keeping them as souvenirs.

659
00:38:19,876 --> 00:38:21,587
Or where he stashed them.

660
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:24,315
I crawled.

661
00:38:30,697 --> 00:38:32,047
I grabbed the gun.

662
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:34,775
I rolled over...

663
00:38:40,347 --> 00:38:41,875
... and there he was.

664
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:43,286
And you shot him.

665
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:51,788
I shot him.

666
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:54,039
I don't understand.

667
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:57,279
- Why didn't you shoot him earlier?
- I was undercover.

668
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,282
I didn't have my gun.

669
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,671
Just like now.

670
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:08,945
<i>Locke was all whorls.</i>

671
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:10,759
Bad guy, loops and arches.

672
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:12,547
<i>Locke is not the killer.</i>

673
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,355
You owe Ziva an apology.

674
00:39:14,863 --> 00:39:18,617
<i>Yes, but we still have to account
for victim number four's finger,</i>

675
00:39:18,768 --> 00:39:20,400
<i>cut off right </i>after death.

676
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,323
Patricia Massey, military wife.

677
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:25,503
Copycat hides her murder
among Hoffman's victims.

678
00:39:25,611 --> 00:39:26,612
Husband?

679
00:39:27,043 --> 00:39:28,451
Always suspect the spouse.

680
00:39:28,924 --> 00:39:31,284
Speaking from personal
experience, Jethro?

681
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,794
That's why I'm never getting married.

682
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:35,919
<i>Petty Officer Massey's build</i> does match

683
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,331
the guy following Hoffman
on the surveillance video.

684
00:39:38,915 --> 00:39:40,010
Call her.

685
00:39:43,593 --> 00:39:44,646
Abs.

686
00:39:44,897 --> 00:39:46,755
- Yes, Gibbs?
<i>- Lose the wheels.</i>

687
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,660
- What do you want, Tony?
<i>- Locke print doesn't match the partial.</i>

688
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,275
- His print is not a match?
<i>- Right.</i>

689
00:39:58,402 --> 00:40:00,653
Well, next time we should
both listen to my instincts.

690
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,785
<i>Yeah.</i>

691
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:06,456
Was that about me?

692
00:40:08,384 --> 00:40:11,193
Was this about me, still a suspect?

693
00:40:13,392 --> 00:40:14,541
I never believed it.

694
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,043
How'd you get my print?

695
00:40:16,393 --> 00:40:17,670
You touched my gun.

696
00:40:19,022 --> 00:40:21,169
So you took my fingerprint, ran it.

697
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:24,928
I didn't match up, and now you're
telling me you never believed it was me?

698
00:40:25,462 --> 00:40:26,470
Look...

699
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:29,046
I tried to stop this, okay?

700
00:40:31,076 --> 00:40:32,351
I'm sorry, Michael.

701
00:40:32,725 --> 00:40:34,480
I wish I could believe you,

702
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:36,308
Ziva, Gina...

703
00:40:37,397 --> 00:40:38,399
whatever.

704
00:40:57,934 --> 00:40:58,962
Something wrong?

705
00:40:58,963 --> 00:41:00,826
Like to talk to you.
Need you to come with us.

706
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,394
Yeah, we're a man short today.
<i>Can it wait?</i>

707
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,885
- No.
- What's the problem?

708
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:06,819
Got some theories on your wife's murder.

709
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:08,470
Yeah, you got the guy, he's dead.

710
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,632
We don't think Andy Hoffman killed her.

711
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:13,839
<i>Sure you want to do this here, Massey?</i>

712
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,269
I got nothing to hide.

713
00:41:16,214 --> 00:41:19,043
Hoffman was killing women
who were cheating on their husbands.

714
00:41:19,249 --> 00:41:20,859
You saying my wife was cheating on me?

715
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:23,070
Probably why you were
drinking at your favorite bar.

716
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:24,854
Same bar Hoffman frequented.

717
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:27,033
<i>Same bar where he picked
up two of his victims.</i>

718
00:41:27,095 --> 00:41:28,179
<i>You noticed him,</i>

719
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:30,744
heard about the killings in the news.
Put two and two together.

720
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:33,044
<i>The night Hoffman picked up</i>
his third victim at the bar,

721
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:34,537
you watched them leave.

722
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:35,611
Not me.

723
00:41:35,712 --> 00:41:37,505
<i>You followed them</i>
back to Hoffman's house.

724
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:39,525
When he left and she didn't,
you broke in.

725
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:40,895
<i>It's pretty neat.</i>

726
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:44,474
Copycat killing using the same knife
and MO as the original killer.

727
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:46,868
You guys got a wild imagination.

728
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,469
Yeah, well, the mistake you made,
the thing you didn't know,

729
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:52,598
is that Hoffman kept the fingers,
except your wife's.

730
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:54,204
Well, that looks deep.

731
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,350
Working on the engine.

732
00:41:56,523 --> 00:41:59,512
No. I think it's from cutting
off your wife's finger.

733
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,864
<i>We found a partial print and traces
of blood</i> on the murder weapon

734
00:42:02,865 --> 00:42:04,610
that don't match Hoffman or the victims.

735
00:42:05,118 --> 00:42:07,266
DNA's going to narrow it down to you.

736
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:30,940
Hi.

737
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:33,001
What do you want?

738
00:42:36,193 --> 00:42:37,329
Telephone number.

739
00:42:37,716 --> 00:42:38,728
I found Devon.

740
00:42:42,608 --> 00:42:44,366
I thought I owed you that much.

741
00:42:45,786 --> 00:42:47,536
She wants to talk to you.

742
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,091
Ziva.

743
00:42:55,814 --> 00:42:56,819
Thanks.
