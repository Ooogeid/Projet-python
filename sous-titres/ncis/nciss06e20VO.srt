<i>- Gibbs.</i>
- Hello, Gibbs.

3
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:56,812
How about that favor you owe me...

4
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:01,563
NCIS Season 6 Episode 20
Dead Reckoning V1.0 LOL

5
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:04,107
Synchro: Gaillots.

00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:08,194
Rereading: Bruno & Magic Turtle

www.Team-NCIS.com

8
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:06,961
Got here fast?

9
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,593
I thought you were riding a desk
at the agency,

10
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:15,152
trying to stay out of trouble.

11
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,846
Guess that didn't work out.

12
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:21,357
Afraid if I gave you too many details,
you wouldn't have shown.

13
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:24,353
Think they shot each other.

14
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:27,148
That the best story you got?

15
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:28,608
One I'm sticking to.

16
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:30,819
Don't know who he is.

17
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:33,780
This one is Andre Vogel.

18
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:37,359
High up in the organization
of Jonathan Siravo.

19
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:39,536
You've heard of him. Kidnapping,

20
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:41,955
smuggling, piracy.

21
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:45,458
See Siravo's picture every day
on our most wanted wall.

22
00:02:45,518 --> 00:02:47,252
Then I guess I'm doing you
another favor.

23
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:49,170
Source in

24
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:53,036
Malta tipped me
Siravo is back operating in the States.

25
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,969
Supposed to show
for a meet here today.

26
00:02:56,786 --> 00:02:59,026
Unfortunately, CIA has no...

27
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:01,649
criminal jurisdiction domestically.

28
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,875
It never seems to stop you.

29
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:07,180
You legally can take him down,
Gibbs.

30
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:12,902
Okay, so...

31
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:15,947
you got here early
to check out the place?

32
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:17,027
Yeah.

33
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,555
Guess they had the same idea.

34
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:22,729
Lucky for you,
they both shot each other.

35
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:24,528
Yeah.

36
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:27,165
.45.

37
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:28,915
Your own weapon of choice.

38
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,421
Carry a nine-millimeter these days.

39
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:36,007
Any chance Siravo will still show?

40
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:38,395
Call it a gut feeling.

41
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:50,064
Glad you could join us, McTardy.

42
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:53,169
Where's the boss, man?
I need a superior to sign off on this.

43
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:55,904
Hand it over. I'm clearly superior
to you in so many ways.

44
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:59,170
- Where is Gibbs?
- We thought he might be with you.

45
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,514
No, I've been at the range
doing my annual qualifications.

46
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,329
He has not been in this morning.
No empty coffee cup in his trash.

47
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:07,040
Maybe he had an appointment.
Doctor, dentist.

48
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:08,541
Check his calendar, McGee.

49
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:12,711
No, soon as I start going
through his stuff,

50
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:14,659
he is going to walk in and catch me.
Forget it.

51
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,132
I cannot believe this.

52
00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:17,657
I'll do it.

53
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:24,015
Watch the elevator.
McGee, the stairs. Now.

54
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:34,514
Nothing... I don't even think
he knows how to use this thing.

55
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,569
He lives alone, maybe something
happened to him.

56
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:37,931
No one would know.

57
00:04:39,438 --> 00:04:43,117
In a tragic story
of obsessive hobbying turned deadly,

58
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:45,912
an NCIS agent was discovered
in his basement,

59
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:48,314
crushed between a large
homemade boat

60
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:50,362
and an even larger
bottle of bourbon.

61
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:52,182
Film at 11:00.

62
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:54,231
- McGee, call him.
- And say what?

63
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,839
"Hey, boss, we're just calling
to check up on you." No, you call him.

64
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:00,927
- Not me.
- See if his cell phone's on.

65
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,310
- Phone's on.
- Where is he?

66
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:11,985
- Forget it... he's going to know.
- How would he know?

67
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,066
- Because he knows everything.
- Do it. We need to know he's okay.

68
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:22,541
He's in a two-block area
of Anacostia.

69
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:25,660
- It's him.
- We're dead.

70
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,154
What do you mean, "we"?
You're the one who tracked him down.

71
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:30,251
Tony, pick it up, pick it up.

72
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:34,671
- Hello?
- Saddle up.

73
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:35,670
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

74
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:37,046
Where we going?

75
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,489
Construction site,
625 East Rosewood.

76
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:40,466
<i>East Rosewood.</i>

77
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:42,564
Hey, isn't that in Anacostia?

78
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:44,428
<i>That's a good guess, DiNozzo.</i>

79
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,662
Got a tip.

80
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:46,846
No sirens.

81
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,474
Jonathan Siravo is en route.

82
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,472
Jonathan Siravo?

83
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:00,903
We're taking tips from Trent Kort.

84
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:02,739
Why don't we just run
with scissors or

85
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,489
talk to strangers?
Maybe they've got some candy.

86
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:07,243
Go to hell, DiNozzo.

87
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,398
Feels like we're halfway there.

88
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,290
Didn't realize
we were processing a crime scene.

89
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,958
We're not... yet.

90
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:17,128
- What happened?
- Got the tip about Siravo.

91
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:19,424
I called Gibbs.

92
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:21,340
We got here and found the bodies.

93
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:23,252
Looks like they killed each other.

94
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:26,220
Sounds like crap.
Boss?

95
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:28,097
Siravo is our main concern.

96
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,667
Set up a perimeter.

97
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:31,142
Kort and I are down here.

98
00:06:31,222 --> 00:06:32,151
Go.

99
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:36,355
We do what Gibbs tells us.

100
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:38,691
You don't really think
those two guys shot each other?

101
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:41,253
Look, I dislike Kort as much as you do,
but the truth is...

102
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:43,179
Really?
You dislike him as much as me?

103
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,742
He tried to kill me.

104
00:06:44,802 --> 00:06:46,440
He blew up my car.

105
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:48,326
I'm sure he had his reasons.

106
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:05,493
There's a sedan turning in.

107
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:07,220
- Occupants?
- Just the driver.

108
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:09,461
Got a visual.

109
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:13,434
Car is stopping.

110
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,365
Federal agents!

111
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,547
Don't move.

112
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:39,459
Who the hell are you?

113
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:47,686
Perry Sterling,

114
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:50,287
49. CPA, certified in Maryland.

115
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:51,924
Currently resides in Virginia.

116
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,225
No record.
Graduated <i>cum laude</i> from Princeton.

117
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,811
Is there any connection
between Perry and Siravo?

118
00:07:57,054 --> 00:07:58,465
None that we have found.

119
00:07:58,642 --> 00:07:59,856
Jonathan Siravo,

120
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,066
insurance salesman, no record,
suffered a head trauma

121
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,442
from a motorcycle accident
six years ago.

122
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:06,571
Disappeared from the recovery room
following surgery.

123
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:09,879
Reappeared one year later
as a major crime lord.

124
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:11,701
A severe personality shift.

125
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,619
Well, according to NSA and Interpol,

126
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,622
Siravo's enterprise has spread
to drug smuggling

127
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:19,208
in Mexico, kidnapping in Bolivia and

128
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:21,056
an interest in a Ukraine pipeline.

129
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:22,552
His finger is in many eyes.

130
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:23,378
Pies.

131
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:26,132
Guy moving that much money should be
leaving a paper trail, but he doesn't.

132
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,009
Guess that's
why he's still in business.

133
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,632
NSG intercepts show

134
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:32,889
Siravo's hired a gang of Somalian
fishermen to hijack ships at sea,

135
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:35,850
and most recently a cargo
vessel by the name of

136
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:37,935
Borealis.
Panamanian register.

137
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:39,922
Went missing this morning
in the Gulf of Aden.

138
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:42,106
Carrying military parts
and a crew of 27.

139
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:43,649
Siravo having more weapons...

140
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,971
not a good thing.
We need this guy now.

141
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:48,203
Then, Gibbs better get
Perry talking.

142
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,486
Director Vance.

143
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:01,959
I heard you were our tip
on this double homicide.

144
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:03,916
Just sharing intel.

145
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:05,503
On a CIA op?

146
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:08,029
On American soil?

147
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:10,301
There is no op.

148
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:12,178
Hence my call to Gibbs.

149
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,597
By the book now?

150
00:09:14,184 --> 00:09:15,348
It's a new day.

151
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:16,922
"Yes, we can."

152
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:20,603
And you two just happened to show up
at the end of the gun battle.

153
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,395
Timing is everything.

154
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:47,080
Look, it's my busy season,
and I'm...

155
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,298
running around like a chicken
with its head cut off.

156
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,801
And all I'm thinking...

157
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:52,718
would be thinking
if my head wasn't cut off...

158
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:56,970
is how to account for...

159
00:09:57,739 --> 00:09:59,846
overflow expenditures.

160
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:04,950
I'm...

161
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:07,775
looking for Arlington.
I take Anacostia...

162
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,401
<i>obviously a mistake...</i>

163
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,322
<i>but my cell takes a dump,
and then my car navigational</i>

164
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:16,373
system is whining
to make an illegal U-turn,

165
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,635
and I don't even think
she knows where we're going.

166
00:10:22,386 --> 00:10:23,381
I was...

167
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:25,793
asking for directions.

168
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:27,851
Jonathan Siravo.

169
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:32,633
I'm his accountant.

170
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:33,926
You launder his money.

171
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:36,762
Yeah.

172
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,104
He responds to my creativity.

173
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:41,045
I respond to his...

174
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,101
terrifying demeanor.

175
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:48,618
I divert cash through

176
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,234
monetary exchanges,

177
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,683
take profits from stolen goods,

178
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:56,720
form shell companies, resell the stuff,
then make it look legit.

179
00:10:57,219 --> 00:10:59,083
We meet when he's in the States,

180
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:01,829
strategize on investments.

181
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:04,915
Like the cargo ship Borealis.

182
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:07,943
Not one of his holdings.

183
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:10,838
It's missing,
along with its entire crew.

184
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:12,548
I don't know anything about that.

185
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:17,053
Siravo hires Somalian fishermen
to hijack ships.

186
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,348
They'll gut the crew.
Throw them overboard.

187
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,144
27 lives...

188
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:24,101
are in your hands.

189
00:11:27,024 --> 00:11:30,061
I want to help you, I really do,
but I can't give you Siravo.

190
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:31,302
I do and I'm dead.

191
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:33,904
He can get to anybody,
any time, anywhere.

192
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:38,419
I need immunity.

193
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:43,829
Stay here.

194
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:54,692
I'll contact the U.S. Attorney.

195
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:57,093
They won't let him walk
without a full polygraph.

196
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,664
It's gonna take time.

197
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:01,742
Okay, I'll keep Perry on ice.
Check out his story.

198
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,420
And Kort's?

199
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:06,519
He calls you, you pull up,
shots ring out.

200
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:07,982
Not quite, Leon.

201
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,855
It was already over
when we got there.

202
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,440
You didn't take your team.

203
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,697
I didn't know what it was yet.

204
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:16,070
It was Kort.

205
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:22,200
<i>Abby, it did not fall out
when I removed their clothes.</i>

206
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,369
Then it's a disappearing act, Ducky.

207
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,247
You have two bodies down there.

208
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:28,958
<i>- Last time I checked.</i>
- From which you have extracted...

209
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:30,263
<i>Three slugs!</i>

210
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:33,504
Kill-shot on the first man
came from a .45.

211
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:37,716
Double-tap on the second came
from the first man's Scorpion 380.

212
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:40,010
But I have half a dozen

213
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:43,668
shell casings down here from a third gun
which seems to be nowhere...

214
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:45,375
Bye, Ducky.

215
00:12:45,435 --> 00:12:48,614
Crime scene's not a priority.
The link to Siravo is.

216
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:51,188
Okay.

217
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:54,191
I recovered cell phones
from both the dead guys,

218
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:57,068
and a Blackberry, and a laptop
from Perry Sterling.

219
00:12:57,128 --> 00:13:00,197
So far, nothing on the phones
has given us anything to track Siravo.

220
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,800
- Laptop.
- No.

221
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:04,910
Perry's no fool. He'd keep all
the important information in his head.

222
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:06,786
He is a killer gamer, though.

223
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:08,650
And he plays a boatload of Sims.

224
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:11,066
Translation: video games.

225
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:14,044
The rest of it is mostly spreadsheets,
bank accounts and porn.

226
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:17,032
Spreadsheets and porn...
that's two totally different things.

227
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:19,706
- I already know that.
- I was just checking.

228
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,385
So, basically, you've got nothing.

229
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:23,362
Nothing?

230
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:26,599
Gibbs, I have the mystery
of the missing gun.

231
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:29,977
A third gun suggests
a third shooter.

232
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:34,023
This is Caf-POW! country,
but yet there's no Caf-POW! anywhere.

233
00:13:34,486 --> 00:13:35,566
Looks inconclusive.

234
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,338
Inconclusive?

235
00:13:38,502 --> 00:13:39,736
Gibbs, I just told you

236
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:42,808
that there was a third shooter
at the construction site.

237
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:47,203
But I could always go
double-check that.

238
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:48,871
Very...

239
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:50,427
slowly.

240
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:52,791
Yeah. Gibbs.

241
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,463
Status on the Borealis.

242
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:59,632
It's a boat, and it's missing.

243
00:13:59,993 --> 00:14:02,635
Status on you is, you're really
irritating and I wish you were missing.

244
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,468
DiNozzo, like it or not...

245
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:06,864
It's "not".

246
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:09,032
We're on the same side.

247
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,379
I see your lips moving,
but all I hear is "lie, lie, lie".

248
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:15,624
And I don't know what's more insulting.
The fact that you're trying to use us,

249
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:17,898
or you think we're dumb enough
to actually buy it.

250
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,252
Someone's buying.

251
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:21,028
I'm in the building.

252
00:14:28,397 --> 00:14:29,327
Oh no.

253
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:33,457
That visitor's badge only gets you
in the lobby. It's not a backstage pass.

254
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,292
I'll tell you what, though.

255
00:14:35,372 --> 00:14:38,754
What you can do is run downstairs to the
gift shop, get yourself something nice.

256
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:42,049
Like a mug or a T-shirt,
or a personality.

257
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:51,016
International Maritime Bureau
confirmed a location for the Borealis.

258
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,318
- Where?
- Indian Ocean.

259
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:56,755
Captain spotted Siravo's vessel
approaching, and he took evasive action.

260
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:59,273
- Lost his comms in a firefight.
- They were boarded?

261
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:01,735
No, the pirates never made it
on board.

262
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:03,720
Then what are we looking at?

263
00:15:03,962 --> 00:15:04,864
Rewind.

264
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:08,460
That's the pirate steamer.

265
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:10,468
Crew of the Borealis is fine.

266
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,880
No survivors
from the steamer's explosion.

267
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,583
Salvage crew says it looks like
remote detonated ordnance.

268
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:18,294
So, this morning,
two of Siravo's men

269
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,574
supposedly gun each other down
at the construction site.

270
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:24,008
And now,
someone plants a bomb on his ship.

271
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:27,789
Someone is taking out
Siravo's entire crew.

272
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:41,817
I should ask for the tops
that aren't childproof.

273
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:49,198
- "Masalamine."
- For collagenous colitis.

274
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:52,828
Tried Prevacid for GERD.
Gastroesophageal reflux disorder.

275
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:57,542
Apparently, I need an upper-bowel
study done to know what it is for sure.

276
00:15:57,754 --> 00:16:01,503
They thought it was celiac disease and
told me to stop eating so much gluten.

277
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:04,173
I didn't even know
I was eating any gluten.

278
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,526
Stress can't help much.

279
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,055
Two bodies this morning
in Anacostia.

280
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:15,392
Nine more of his crew
in the Indian Ocean.

281
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:19,647
He's liquidating.

282
00:16:19,964 --> 00:16:20,856
Who?

283
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:22,483
Siravo.

284
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:28,113
I should have seen it.
He had me consolidate his funds.

285
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:31,075
Almost 300 million.
He's made his fortune.

286
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,322
Closing up shop.

287
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:34,113
Leaves no use for you.

288
00:16:37,926 --> 00:16:39,375
He was gonna kill me, wasn't he?

289
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:41,510
He still might.

290
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:46,298
Last one.
Can I have some water?

291
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:48,175
First immunity, now water?

292
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:49,760
No more demands.

293
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,721
- I hate to dry swallow.
- Siravo, account numbers.

294
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:54,264
Not without immunity.

295
00:16:57,102 --> 00:16:58,227
I'll give you a name.

296
00:16:58,511 --> 00:17:00,798
Victor Flores.
Flores is Siravo's number two.

297
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:02,121
I already know that.

298
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,572
I know how to get a hold of him!

299
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:11,997
How?

300
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,413
Have you ever played
"Captains of Industry 3"?

301
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:19,331
"Captains of Industry 3"...

302
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:22,251
the completely unnecessary
third installment

303
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:24,280
of the not-so-popular sequel.

304
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:26,171
Capturing all the fun

305
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:29,595
of being a corporate CEO and building
your very own business empire.

306
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,010
Not playtime, Elf Lord.

307
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:33,637
You got that right.

308
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,808
COI3 was universally panned
as '08's worst MMORPG.

309
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:39,935
It sucks.

310
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,813
So why was Perry spending up

311
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:45,174
to seven hours
a day playing it online?

312
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:46,939
He sucks?

313
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:48,062
Maybe.

314
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:50,821
Still,
what would he get from COI3...

315
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:53,115
a game that nobody plays?

316
00:17:54,937 --> 00:17:58,454
Real-time communications
in uncrowded chat rooms.

317
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,873
You can message people
to discuss game strategy,

318
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,096
talk trash...

319
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:06,146
Or send
their fellow criminals messages.

320
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:07,838
Coded messages.

321
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,383
We have all of Perry's account
information. We can read his chats.

322
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:13,343
That's a lot of chatter to decode.

323
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,684
It's playtime.

324
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,893
According to Perry,
Victor Flores is in the number-two slot.

325
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,667
Flores is a munitions expert,
likely the button man.

326
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,813
Contacting him may be
the only way to get to Siravo.

327
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:29,109
- Not that he'll be too willing to talk.
- Been a lot of internal bloodshed.

328
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:35,073
We're still kicking around theories
about Killian and Vogel.

329
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:36,853
Would you care to chime in?

330
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,421
Double-suicide pact.

331
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:42,414
Secret lovers couldn't stand
to live a lie any longer.

332
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:45,954
Too many question marks.
DiNozzo, safe house for Perry.

333
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:47,131
Take Ziva with you.

334
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,093
Secret lovers...

335
00:18:54,553 --> 00:18:55,886
Don't touch any of my stuff.

336
00:18:56,394 --> 00:18:57,262
Yeah.

337
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,976
Keeping me on a short leash, Gibbs?

338
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:05,023
Yeah, and a muzzle if I have to.

339
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:07,981
I thought we'd turned
a corner in our relationship.

340
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:11,652
You ask me for something,
I ask you for something.

341
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:15,665
I didn't ask you
to dig up dirt on Vance.

342
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:18,242
But you read the file anyway.

343
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:20,793
No, I don't waste time on fiction.

344
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:27,388
What motivation would I ever have
to mislead you?

345
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,504
I respect that you're suspicious.

346
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:34,591
Caution is an asset
in our line of work.

347
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:38,553
Trust is elusive at best.

348
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:41,473
No, it's not, not between us.
It's impossible.

349
00:19:43,408 --> 00:19:44,754
But I honor my debts.

350
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:49,489
Such nobility.

351
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:53,148
Somewhat hollow given
your fallback position.

352
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,909
You're not really sticking
your neck out for me.

353
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:00,826
Vance comes down on you, you're already
thinking you've got the goods on him.

354
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:02,004
Words are cheap.

355
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,121
Actions speak louder.

356
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:07,035
Or to put it in parlance
you'd understand:

357
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:09,877
measure twice, cut once.

358
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:17,155
Doesn't look that safe to me.
Why aren't we in a hotel?

359
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,582
Haven't you ever seen <i>Bullitt</i>?

360
00:20:18,642 --> 00:20:20,928
Bellhops, maids, room service...
it's all a bad idea.

361
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:22,346
No one knows we're here.

362
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,960
- This all smells.
- God.

363
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,730
It's musty.

364
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:31,532
How about some fresh air?

365
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:33,404
Stay away
from the windows and the door.

366
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:34,989
And the wet bar.

367
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:36,818
This is going to be a lot of fun.

368
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:41,825
Place is a mess.
Whoever was here last didn't clean up.

369
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:43,243
That would be me and McGee.

370
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:45,704
Let me guess.
Basic cable.

371
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:47,289
Uncle Sam's dime.

372
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:49,791
I'm a very light sleeper.

373
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:52,158
I can't share a room
with anyone else.

374
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,378
Was not an option.

375
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:01,794
I haven't eaten all day.

376
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:03,957
Any chance we can arrange
an early dinner?

377
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:10,167
Local cuisine.

378
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:14,816
I have a very delicate stomach.

379
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,779
I'm on a strict macrobiotic diet.

380
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:20,739
Can't wait to see what happens.

381
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:24,531
I'm gonna kill this guy
before Siravo does.

382
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,871
McGee, that's a terrible place
to put a railroad spur.

383
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:31,203
You're never going to get clearance
from the city officials.

384
00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:33,961
I made a six-figure charitable
contribution to the councilman's fund,

385
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:35,871
so he's going to cut me
a pretty sweet deal.

386
00:21:35,931 --> 00:21:37,881
Not with the price
of iron skyrocketing.

387
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:41,385
You should have taken the deal
with the guy from Singapore.

388
00:21:41,872 --> 00:21:43,577
It's all part of the process.

389
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:44,936
Right?

390
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:48,225
Yeah. Messaging with people from around
the world, that's how you play the game.

391
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:51,434
Perry looks like he's playing, but
he's actually communicating with Flores.

392
00:21:51,494 --> 00:21:53,670
Sending and receiving
coded messages.

393
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,941
Perry told us where to find
the cipher key on his laptop.

394
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:59,277
Now, they use terms from the game.
For instance, steel means guns.

395
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:02,871
Hospitals are for emergencies.

396
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:05,742
Or a deal gone bad,
or a problem with law enforcement.

397
00:22:05,978 --> 00:22:06,910
Cabbage is...

398
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:09,130
Money. You know
how to communicate with Flores?

399
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,437
Yeah.
We have been.

400
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,187
We're trying to set up a meet now.

401
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,998
We can't track this guy,
his character?

402
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:17,887
Well, Flores uses any of a dozen
characters in scattered locations.

403
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:21,313
- It's the Wild West in here, Gibbs.
- But, you are looking at the sheriff.

404
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:26,506
We got a response.

405
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,391
Flores wants to meet Perry
at the Stone Basin Hospital.

406
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:33,520
Which, according to the cipher key,
means emergency meeting, Rock Creek.

407
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,730
- The park.
- In an hour.

408
00:22:39,515 --> 00:22:40,736
Pork bellies are falling.

409
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:45,698
School was never fun as a kid.

410
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:47,451
I wasn't into sports.

411
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,769
And I was always nervous
around girls.

412
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:52,132
I didn't have a lot of friends.

413
00:22:52,411 --> 00:22:53,832
My parents thought...

414
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:56,251
if I got a pet,
maybe that would help.

415
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:57,715
Sounds like a good idea.

416
00:22:58,437 --> 00:23:00,589
That's when we found out
about my allergies.

417
00:23:00,853 --> 00:23:02,633
Had to give Buttons to a cousin.

418
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,677
You know,
you're not a bad-looking guy.

419
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,689
You're being kind.

420
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:12,601
No. Actually, I cannot believe
you never had a girlfriend.

421
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:17,564
There was a girl I kind of dated for
a semester, sophomore year of college.

422
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:18,986
Yeah?

423
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:21,480
She was just using me.

424
00:23:21,785 --> 00:23:24,707
Soon as she passed
Econ Statistics Analysis 340,

425
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:26,145
I never heard from her again.

426
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:28,504
Ironically, I thought...

427
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:31,151
earning a lot of money
would help me with women.

428
00:23:31,473 --> 00:23:33,753
Now it turns out, all it's going
to get me is prison...

429
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:36,193
or murdered.

430
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:42,297
Danger is a turn-on for women,
right?

431
00:23:44,062 --> 00:23:45,112
Some women.

432
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:47,927
Yeah.

433
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:56,978
Come on, open up.
Food's getting cold.

434
00:23:58,917 --> 00:23:59,981
How are you?

435
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:04,111
Any word on my immunity?

436
00:24:04,784 --> 00:24:08,064
I hear zinc lozenges help. You might
want to try some vitamin C or echinacea.

437
00:24:08,124 --> 00:24:09,905
You mean your immunity? No.

438
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:14,621
I need to take one with every meal.

439
00:24:15,071 --> 00:24:16,456
You can skip a meal, Perry.

440
00:24:16,628 --> 00:24:19,554
Trust me. You don't want to be
in this small apartment

441
00:24:19,614 --> 00:24:22,546
with me if I haven't had
my medicine.

442
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,863
Flores got here early.

443
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:38,895
Maybe we read the codes wrong.

444
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:47,737
It's clear.

445
00:25:05,752 --> 00:25:06,715
Found Flores!

446
00:25:08,697 --> 00:25:09,759
Then who is this?!

447
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:23,190
Guess we're not gonna be talking
to Siravo's number two.

448
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,947
- So much for Perry's hot tip, huh?
- On the contrary, McGee.

449
00:25:27,007 --> 00:25:28,590
Flores is still warm.

450
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:31,323
97.8, to be exact.

451
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:35,322
This man was killed less
than half an hour ago.

452
00:25:35,615 --> 00:25:37,453
97.7 on this body, Doctor.

453
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:40,450
Yeah, both men were killed
at approximately the same time.

454
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:42,833
We've seen that before, Jethro.

455
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:45,477
What is it you say
about coincidence?

456
00:25:48,342 --> 00:25:49,798
Care to dance, Gibbs?

457
00:25:52,035 --> 00:25:53,929
Flores is smoking, here.

458
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,118
First shot...

459
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:56,972
hits him in the leg.

460
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:58,834
He goes to take cover.

461
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:00,435
Draws his weapon.

462
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:02,119
Wounded,

463
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:03,605
he takes a shot.

464
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,148
More than one.

465
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,202
Two bullets hit this tree,

466
00:26:07,262 --> 00:26:09,092
plus one
in our second dead man's gut.

467
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,279
Now we're both wounded.

468
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,615
But I step out to take another shot.

469
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:14,658
I'm hit,

470
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:16,284
but you're hit worse.

471
00:26:17,318 --> 00:26:19,829
I step up,
and I put one right in your heart.

472
00:26:24,822 --> 00:26:27,428
Considering you're about to die,
that was a hell of a shot.

473
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:30,423
Boss, second body is Luther Rake.

474
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:32,953
Found his car down the road.

475
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:36,604
According to our intel,
he's low-level muscle for Siravo.

476
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:38,390
He and Flores worked
for the same guy.

477
00:26:38,652 --> 00:26:39,848
Not a coincidence.

478
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:42,602
Siravo hired Rake to hit Flores.

479
00:26:43,563 --> 00:26:44,729
Flores hit back.

480
00:26:45,347 --> 00:26:46,981
Body count's rising fast.

481
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:51,695
You're expecting one living guy.
Instead, you find two dead guys.

482
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:53,863
Both Siravo's.

483
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:57,690
He sent Rake after Flores
before we could pick him up.

484
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:00,829
Only one way Siravo gets
that kind of heads-up.

485
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,038
We got a leak.

486
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:04,541
Means Siravo knows we got Perry.

487
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:06,226
I want to know who told him.

488
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:08,420
Maybe we should start
with your buddy Kort.

489
00:27:09,346 --> 00:27:10,463
He's not my buddy.

490
00:27:10,544 --> 00:27:11,889
Could have fooled me.

491
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:14,843
I made some phone calls.

492
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,617
Trent Kort's been benched.

493
00:27:17,524 --> 00:27:20,432
Siravo hasn't been
on the CIA's radar in six months.

494
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:23,435
What's Kort doing digging
around in the trash?

495
00:27:24,024 --> 00:27:25,082
He's got his uses.

496
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:32,777
Kort gave you my file.

497
00:27:34,148 --> 00:27:36,030
I'm only concerned about Siravo.

498
00:27:36,598 --> 00:27:37,927
What's Kort interested in?

499
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:40,561
God and country.

500
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,109
Trent Kort...

501
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:46,750
shows up bearing gifts.

502
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:48,668
I want to know what's in it for him.

503
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,105
Trent Kort...

504
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:54,257
does not gain anything
by leaking information, Leon.

505
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:56,217
Then I want to know who does.

506
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:58,886
Find the leak.
Find Siravo.

507
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:01,848
I want the CIA out of my house.

508
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:11,691
Must have hard water here.

509
00:28:13,044 --> 00:28:15,653
What are you looking at?
Eat your free-range banana muffin.

510
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:20,945
If Siravo could get to Flores,
he'll be able to get to me.

511
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:22,882
I'm a dead man for sure.

512
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:24,549
Cool your jets, Perry.

513
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:27,680
U.S. Marshals are on their way over
to get you right now anyway.

514
00:28:28,738 --> 00:28:30,258
My immunity came through?

515
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:32,379
Yeah. I wouldn't get too excited.

516
00:28:33,386 --> 00:28:36,257
You are gonna have to spill
your guts to the U.S. attorney.

517
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,437
Not a problem.

518
00:28:38,062 --> 00:28:38,802
Really?

519
00:28:39,304 --> 00:28:40,929
You're gonna have
to pass a polygraph.

520
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,913
There's gonna be a trial.

521
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,325
You'll have to testify.

522
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:46,981
You're going
to be shuttling back and forth

523
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:49,437
between these lousy safe houses
for the next year.

524
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:51,781
I've got an idea.

525
00:28:52,253 --> 00:28:55,529
Why don't you just tell us
Siravo's account numbers?

526
00:28:57,864 --> 00:28:59,972
What do you mean lousy safe houses?

527
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:04,035
Four bodies
with a total of seven wounds.

528
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:05,227
From seven bullets.

529
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:06,912
Fired from four guns.

530
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:09,079
All of which are in evidence.

531
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:11,631
We have the means and the murderers.

532
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:12,576
Each...

533
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:16,350
body sings a different harmony
to the same song.

534
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:18,915
Yeah, like a barbershop quartet.

535
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,428
Case closed.

536
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,494
No, no. I was thinking more of...

537
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:29,165
"Let the punishment fit the crime."

538
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,604
Gilbert and Sullivan.

539
00:29:30,808 --> 00:29:33,648
Opera doesn't exactly translate
to barbershop quartet.

540
00:29:35,622 --> 00:29:38,486
Of course, you would know that,
being a lover of opera.

541
00:29:38,841 --> 00:29:41,349
And you a lover
of the barbershop quartet?

542
00:29:42,637 --> 00:29:43,731
It was college.

543
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:44,981
I was a tenor.

544
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:48,913
We were known as the PB & Js.
I was one of the Js.

545
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,033
Yeah, really?

546
00:29:50,093 --> 00:29:53,233
Yeah, we modeled our look
after the Dapper Dans of Disneyland.

547
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:56,116
We had the vests,
the sleeve garters.

548
00:29:56,251 --> 00:29:58,548
Yeah, the... the straw boater hats.
Still have them at home.

549
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:02,760
- We were good.
- Well, the element...

550
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:06,724
that makes barbershop music unique
is called the fifth note.

551
00:30:06,784 --> 00:30:09,684
Yeah, a specific acoustical effect
found in the harmony,

552
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:12,187
also known as a ringing chord.

553
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:15,190
Something you can only hear
when all four voices sing together.

554
00:30:15,402 --> 00:30:18,359
Yeah. Something our quartet lacks.

555
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:21,820
Something that only
all four bodies could tell us in unison.

556
00:30:22,674 --> 00:30:24,157
We need a connection.

557
00:30:24,603 --> 00:30:25,608
Horse manure.

558
00:30:25,972 --> 00:30:27,307
Horse manure?

559
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:29,903
Yes.

560
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:33,653
We did find traces of a substance
on their hands

561
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:36,503
and under the fingernails
of our dearly departed.

562
00:30:36,683 --> 00:30:38,755
Yeah. So did Abby, on their shoes.

563
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:40,798
Well, perhaps that's our connection.

564
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:43,718
Yeah, traces of horse manure
on every one of them,

565
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,585
suggesting all four were
on a farm or ranch.

566
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:49,044
According to the chemical breakdown
of the manure...

567
00:30:49,104 --> 00:30:49,933
Same ranch.

568
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:53,060
If all four men worked for Siravo,

569
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,939
then it's safe to say that that ranch
was a meeting place

570
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,607
for his employees.

571
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,901
Maybe even Siravo himself.

572
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:01,469
Yeah, Duck, maybe.

573
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:03,797
Thank you, gentlemen.

574
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:04,697
<i>Perfect...</i>

575
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:07,172
<i>harmony.</i>

576
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:21,297
Tony, we have been compromised.

577
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,466
What are you talking about?
Is this a drill?

578
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:24,825
Did she get my medicine?

579
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:26,585
I'm going in the back.

580
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:29,672
- Come here. Let's go.
- What?

581
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:31,516
What are you doing?

582
00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:33,799
Let's go, Perry!

583
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,482
We got to go?

584
00:31:39,562 --> 00:31:41,401
We're more vulnerable in transit.
Take cover.

585
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,403
- What's she gonna do?
- I don't really know.

586
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:45,738
Bathroom now!

587
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:51,675
Yeah. Gibbs.

588
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:53,584
We have a situation
at the safe house.

589
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:55,971
<i>Yeah, Ziva.
What is it?</i>

590
00:31:57,186 --> 00:31:58,459
Just a second.

591
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:15,189
<i>Ziva, talk to me!</i>

592
00:32:16,307 --> 00:32:17,456
Under control.

593
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:24,196
You okay?

594
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,363
Your medicine.
You look like you need it.

595
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:30,074
Stand down!

596
00:32:30,424 --> 00:32:31,624
U.S. Marshals!

597
00:32:34,743 --> 00:32:35,622
NCIS!

598
00:32:38,443 --> 00:32:39,789
Coming out!

599
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,212
Here you go, gentlemen.

600
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,923
He's all yours.

601
00:32:46,951 --> 00:32:48,725
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

602
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:56,965
That's a job well done.

603
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:04,317
Abby, no one was hurt.
Tony and Ziva are fine.

604
00:33:04,804 --> 00:33:05,804
They're not fine!

605
00:33:05,988 --> 00:33:08,154
Not as long as someone is leaking
information.

606
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,658
I mean, how else would Siravo have known
about our meeting with Flores

607
00:33:11,738 --> 00:33:13,076
and that we had Perry?

608
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:15,615
See?

609
00:33:15,823 --> 00:33:18,081
No one is safe
until I find this leak.

610
00:33:18,422 --> 00:33:20,166
- Any luck?
- No!

611
00:33:20,497 --> 00:33:23,961
There were no unusual outgoing calls
from the NCIS switchboard.

612
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:27,799
I ran all the phone numbers for everyone
with knowledge of the crime: Gibbs,

613
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,801
Tony, Ziva, you, me...

614
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:31,686
home, cell and office.

615
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:33,562
You ran your own home phone records?

616
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:35,390
Yeah. Gibbs' orders.

617
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:40,392
What about the Internet? There could be
a virus or Trojan horse on the network.

618
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:43,563
I already checked all incoming
and outgoing network communications.

619
00:33:43,644 --> 00:33:45,400
All the firewalls are in place.

620
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,942
The TCP servers are secure.

621
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:49,458
If there's a leak, it's not coming
from this building,

622
00:33:49,518 --> 00:33:51,783
- and I don't know where else to look.
- Try this.

623
00:33:52,524 --> 00:33:53,865
Whose number is this?

624
00:33:53,946 --> 00:33:55,618
- Kort?
- Run it.

625
00:33:57,004 --> 00:33:58,078
What do you got?

626
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:02,291
Dashboard navigation systems
from the two vehicles at the park.

627
00:34:02,371 --> 00:34:05,618
Tracking where Siravo's men have been.
See if there was any common location.

628
00:34:05,678 --> 00:34:07,630
You mean,
other than where they both died.

629
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:08,840
Okay.

630
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:12,093
Now, there's only one other location
shows up in both nav systems.

631
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:12,991
Put it up.

632
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:17,849
1314 Walnut Forest Road
in Stafford County.

633
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,183
That looks like stables.

634
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,519
- It's a horse ranch.
- Siravo's hideout.

635
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,769
Grab DiNozzo, Ziva.

636
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,313
Evidence garage in five.

637
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:29,569
Looking for a fight, Gibbs?

638
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,351
- We're looking for Siravo's crew.
- What happened to the wiggler?

639
00:34:32,411 --> 00:34:34,115
Sterling's federal
marshals' problem now.

640
00:34:34,737 --> 00:34:35,825
Need another gun?

641
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:38,665
Actually, we're out of vests,
but you can go commando if you want.

642
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:40,955
- DiNozzo, get in the damn car!
- Getting in the car, boss.

643
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:46,332
Where are you going, Gibbs?

644
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:24,929
Federal agents!

645
00:35:28,784 --> 00:35:30,254
Not much of the headquarters.

646
00:35:32,815 --> 00:35:33,737
Who is he?

647
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:36,972
Face does look familiar.

648
00:35:37,758 --> 00:35:38,614
It should.

649
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:40,264
Because it's on our wall.

650
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:44,645
It's our criminal mastermind,
Jonathan Siravo.

651
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:52,765
In a topsy-turvy world
where nothing is

652
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:56,044
as it seems, the one place
you can turn to is The Wall.

653
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:59,505
Ran his prints, the coma man is,
indeed, Jonathan Siravo.

654
00:35:59,565 --> 00:36:01,245
Yes, the Master of Pirates...

655
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:04,705
Can't change his diapers, but running
an international crime syndicate?

656
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:07,416
That he can do in his sleep.
You lied to me, Wall!

657
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,677
We have half-a-dozen bodies
downstairs,

658
00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:12,314
another nine floating
on the other side of the world.

659
00:36:12,374 --> 00:36:14,256
Someone is responsible for them.

660
00:36:14,316 --> 00:36:16,065
You're responsible
for a some of them.

661
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:18,261
Someone else is responsible
for the rest.

662
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,930
Someone has built an empire
using the name "Siravo"

663
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,006
as a front.

664
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:24,825
Yeah, to the tune
of 300 million in illicit proceeds.

665
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,692
That guy ever wakes up, he's going
to be in for one hell of a surprise.

666
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:31,977
Yeah, the best we can figure,
Siravo never woke up from his coma

667
00:36:32,037 --> 00:36:34,485
- after his motorcycle accident.
- Who's keeping him alive?

668
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:36,843
- Who's paying the bills?
- That's what I'm working on here.

669
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,865
Private nursing care,
medical equipment, horse ranch...

670
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,159
Everything was well-funded
until a couple days ago.

671
00:36:42,727 --> 00:36:44,453
When the first account was closed,

672
00:36:44,513 --> 00:36:47,248
its contents were funneled
into various offshore accounts.

673
00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:50,042
It's like Perry said,
"Consolidation and liquidation".

674
00:36:50,128 --> 00:36:52,772
Like everyone else involved,
the money's also being taken out.

675
00:36:52,832 --> 00:36:55,415
All Siravo's accounts have been drained
in the past 24 hours,

676
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:57,800
but the transfers aren't being made
from outside the banks.

677
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,802
No passwords or serial numbers used,

678
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,680
no requests for withdrawals came
via any net portal...

679
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:04,350
Someone's stealing
the pirate's gold.

680
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,502
It's not stealing.

681
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:06,559
Seizing.

682
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:08,945
Well, there's only a couple agencies
that can do that:

683
00:37:09,005 --> 00:37:10,416
Homeland Security and...

684
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:12,639
CIA.

685
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:14,275
International banking laws.

686
00:37:14,503 --> 00:37:17,959
CIA can seize the assets
of any suspected criminal or terrorist.

687
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:20,323
Please don't tell me we're making
Trent Kort a very rich man.

688
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:24,006
<i>- I need to see you.</i>
- All right, Abs.

689
00:37:24,512 --> 00:37:25,743
Be right there.

690
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:27,556
Find Kort.

691
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:46,586
Please, don't fire me, Gibbs.

692
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:48,684
Or... or send me to jail.

693
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:53,426
If I have a choice,

694
00:37:53,598 --> 00:37:54,898
I'd rather be fired.

695
00:37:55,071 --> 00:37:55,816
I think.

696
00:37:56,427 --> 00:37:57,234
For what?

697
00:37:58,007 --> 00:38:00,154
Aiding and abetting in a homicide.

698
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:03,120
They played us like a fiddle, Gibbs.

699
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:05,686
We were... fiddled.

700
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:07,912
We didn't know what we were saying.

701
00:38:07,993 --> 00:38:09,497
The message went out to Flores,

702
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:11,499
only it was in an open forum.

703
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:13,709
So all Rake had to do
was monitor it.

704
00:38:14,111 --> 00:38:15,044
The code.

705
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:16,255
We got it wrong.

706
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,255
"Hospital"

707
00:38:18,335 --> 00:38:19,966
didn't mean "emergency".

708
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:22,146
It meant "send someone there".

709
00:38:22,422 --> 00:38:24,988
So, as far as Flores goes...

710
00:38:25,048 --> 00:38:26,313
We put out the hit.

711
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,102
Hey, DiNozzo, tell me you got Kort.

712
00:38:31,182 --> 00:38:33,229
Well, didn't get far,
less than three miles...

713
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,967
- You're not going to like it.
- Where?

714
00:38:35,027 --> 00:38:37,047
<i>He just made a call.
Triangulation shows him</i>

715
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,714
<i>at the U.S. Marshal's office
at 500, Indiana.</i>

716
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:42,449
<i>Protection detail's</i> transporting
Perry <i>to the U.S. Attorney's office</i>.

717
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:44,699
Start the car.
Perry's the last loose end.

718
00:38:44,966 --> 00:38:46,742
- Kort's going to kill Perry?
<i>- No...</i>

719
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:47,900
No, he is not.

720
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,048
- Hello, Gibbs.
- <i>He drained</i> all of his accounts!

721
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:02,341
Who, Siravo?

722
00:39:02,536 --> 00:39:05,678
There is no Siravo!
He's been out of commission for years!

723
00:39:06,201 --> 00:39:08,723
Someone else must be running
his operations.

724
00:39:08,886 --> 00:39:11,225
Yeah, and you know damn well
who that is, don't you?!

725
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:13,102
There's just two of us
left in this mess.

726
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:14,612
You listen to me, Kort!

727
00:39:14,975 --> 00:39:16,939
Nobody else dies today!

728
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,942
Never expected you to turn him
over to the marshals.

729
00:39:30,241 --> 00:39:31,746
All right, let's move.

730
00:39:34,245 --> 00:39:35,124
Stow him.

731
00:39:36,956 --> 00:39:38,209
Stop.

732
00:39:39,214 --> 00:39:40,796
Trent Kort, CIA.

733
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:43,132
- The man you're transp...
- The man is in our protection.

734
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:45,092
We will use force if you don't stop.

735
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,927
There's been a mistake.

736
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:48,888
This man cannot be allowed to...

737
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:56,145
CIA stole my money.

738
00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:00,232
I want it back, Mr. Kort.

739
00:40:00,312 --> 00:40:01,317
Every cent.

740
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:06,515
Give me my money!

741
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:09,505
You heard him, Kort.

742
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:11,497
Give him his money.

743
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:12,912
Come on, Perry.

744
00:40:13,684 --> 00:40:15,062
You're a numbers guy.

745
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:18,965
How do you like these odds?

746
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:30,674
You don't just drop a gun
that's been recently fired.

747
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:31,806
It could go off.

748
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:33,682
- You okay?
- Yeah.

749
00:40:33,804 --> 00:40:35,207
You really are a madman.

750
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:37,812
You knew it was Perry?

751
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,420
Well, I knew it wasn't me.

752
00:40:44,337 --> 00:40:46,237
So Perry was Siravo's accountant.

753
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,199
Set up his living will
after the motorcycle accident.

754
00:40:49,259 --> 00:40:50,408
Used power of attorney

755
00:40:50,468 --> 00:40:52,783
to access his holdings,
and began building his network.

756
00:40:52,843 --> 00:40:54,495
All the while, the public face

757
00:40:54,575 --> 00:40:57,039
of the criminal empire
would never be seen anywhere...

758
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,722
but here,

759
00:40:58,782 --> 00:40:59,791
on The Wall.

760
00:41:05,335 --> 00:41:07,360
You're the real victim here,
aren't you, Wall?

761
00:41:08,914 --> 00:41:10,583
You weren't after the pirate.

762
00:41:10,643 --> 00:41:11,960
You were after his treasure.

763
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,301
Found his phony health fund
and cleared it out.

764
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:17,315
I didn't know he would take it
so personally,

765
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,437
but it seemed like an opportune time
to cash in a favor.

766
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:23,047
$300 million,
I'd say you got your money's worth.

767
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:24,483
CIA keeps it.

768
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:26,715
And you get Siravo as promised.

769
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:29,974
A major threat has been neutralized.

770
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,161
You thought I was going
to shoot him?

771
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:38,577
Just there to get him back,
that's all.

772
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:42,793
Couldn't have him hide
behind immunity now, could we?

773
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:44,837
Bank robberies from bad guys.

774
00:41:46,335 --> 00:41:48,674
Is that how the CIA finances
their operations?

775
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:53,311
I'm just trying to get back
in the starting lineup.

776
00:41:53,371 --> 00:41:56,348
It's possible you're even
more dangerous behind a desk.

777
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:07,598
Makes you feel any better,
Gibbs, I owe you one.

778
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:10,029
No. We're even.

779
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:16,989
You know,
the hardest part about coaching?

780
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,622
It's watching from the sidelines.

781
00:42:19,981 --> 00:42:22,512
Yeah, it looks a little different
from over there, doesn't it, Leon?

782
00:42:24,606 --> 00:42:25,400
What?

783
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,838
You would have done
things differently?

784
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,109
I would.

785
00:42:29,604 --> 00:42:30,506
I do.

786
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:35,035
But...

787
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:39,004
in the last two minutes, you got
to let your quarterback call the plays.

788
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:40,513
Nice win.

789
