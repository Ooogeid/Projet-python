2
00:00:02,662 --> 00:00:05,030
In the land of forensic
science technology,

3
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:07,456
the mass spectrometer is king.

4
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:10,581
It uses the basic magnetic force
of a charged particle

5
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:12,968
<i>to measure the mass and relative</i>

6
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:15,265
concentration of atoms and molecules.

7
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:16,464
Pretty cool, huh?

8
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:17,867
Are those tattoos real?

9
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:22,372
Yes.
Any other questions?

10
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:23,741
How many do you have?

11
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:25,404
A lot.

12
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:27,420
That's all I'm gonna say about that.

13
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:29,605
A lot?
I only counted five.

14
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:31,464
The rest of 'em are...

15
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:33,147
<i>hidden.</i>

16
00:00:33,215 --> 00:00:34,241
Hidden where?

17
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:36,556
They're...

18
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:37,807
- <i>Hi, guys.</i>
- Hi.

19
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:39,266
- What'd I miss?
- Nothing yet.

20
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:40,899
Abby was just about to show us her...

21
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:42,889
AFIS...
program.

22
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:44,131
Right...

23
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:45,650
Carson?

24
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:46,472
Right.

25
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:50,235
So, if the mass spectrometer
is the king of the land,

26
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:52,460
this little darling
is definitely the queen.

27
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,394
In the last four years,
we've made over 200 arrests

28
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,237
<i>thanks to AFIS fingerprint matches.</i>

29
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:58,058
We?

30
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:01,463
- It's a team effort.
- So this is an L SCAN.

31
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:02,553
All you do...

32
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:05,190
is put your index finger on the glass
and...

33
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:07,221
<i>voilà</i>, you're in the system.

34
00:01:07,236 --> 00:01:08,538
<i>- I want to try it.</i>
- Cool.

35
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:10,872
As we speak,
the program is filtering through

36
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:13,007
<i>a database filled
with millions of prints.</i>

37
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:15,561
The majority of them were recorded
after somebody's arrest.

38
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,816
So, assuming that you haven't served
any hard time,

39
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:20,290
I doubt we're gonna get a...

44
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,852
Where is Gibbs?

45
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:09,179
It's been like 20 minutes.

46
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,540
Abby, it's been like four minutes.

47
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:13,580
In little kid time, that's like 20.

48
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,183
Gibbs will be here any second.

49
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:19,513
Look at him.

50
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:20,770
He looks so scared.

51
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:25,087
Seems fine.

52
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:27,791
If you're gonna be heartless,
that's on you, McGee.

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,241
- I'm going in.
- To say what?

54
00:02:32,472 --> 00:02:34,868
Exactly.
Like I said, we need to wait for Gibbs.

55
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:35,925
Who's Gibbs?

56
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:40,377
Agent Gibbs, he's our boss.

57
00:02:41,284 --> 00:02:42,559
Am I in trouble?

58
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:45,377
No, no, no, Carson. Not at all.

59
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:47,781
What about the AMIS thing?

60
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:48,797
AFIS.

61
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:50,489
Sorry.

62
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,243
You know what? I'm...
I'm just gonna go back to work.

63
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,281
Where are the other kids?

64
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:05,857
The tour ended early.

65
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:07,288
How am I gonna get home?

66
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:09,979
We're gonna figure that out.

67
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:14,038
The computer said I was abducted.

68
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:17,024
That's like kidnapped, right?

69
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:18,854
Kidnapped, as in...

70
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:20,164
stolen?

71
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:22,764
I'm sure there's
some sort of explanation.

72
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:23,804
There is.

73
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:24,994
You guys messed up.

74
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:26,447
Wouldn't be the first time.

75
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:27,577
Hey.

76
00:03:27,722 --> 00:03:28,802
Special Agent Gibbs.

77
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,094
The boss.

78
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:31,480
To some people.

79
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,224
Thought you might be thirsty.

80
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,620
I'm not supposed to drink
soda after 3:00.

81
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:44,117
Given the situation,

82
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:46,115
I think my mom would understand.

83
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:48,142
Moms usually do.

84
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,209
So...

85
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:51,839
you guys figure this thing out yet?

86
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:53,238
Working on it.

87
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:56,194
It's been a long day.

88
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:58,901
I know you're looking
to get out of here.

89
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,692
You're right.
Who's driving?

90
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,617
Hold on.

91
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:04,013
We're gonna talk first.

92
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:05,688
Knew that'd be too easy.

93
00:04:06,974 --> 00:04:09,311
Before we start,
can I ask you guys a question?

94
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:11,043
Yeah. Shoot.

95
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,439
Do I look like a missing kid?

96
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,244
I mean, come on. I'm a Youth Ranger.

97
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:18,427
He's got a good point.

98
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:21,662
And I'm from Franklin,
which means I can't be missing,

99
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:23,486
'cause nothing cool ever happens there.

100
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:24,766
That bad, huh?

101
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:25,821
Worse.

102
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:28,175
We only live there
'cause it's close to the woods.

103
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,948
My dad goes most weekends.

104
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,708
Hunting or camping?

105
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,869
Teaching.

106
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:34,583
He shows people how to live without

107
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:36,432
phones, lights, that kind of stuff.

108
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:38,622
He's super tough like...

109
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:40,732
Russell Crowe in <i>"Gladiator"</i>.

110
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:42,407
Sounds like a cool dad.

111
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:43,804
Coolest.

112
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,482
He's taught me pretty much
everything he knows.

113
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:49,953
That explains all the badges.

114
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:52,305
Eighteen.
Second most in my troop.

115
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:54,684
Took me close to three years.

116
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,848
I bet your dad's real proud of you.

117
00:04:58,402 --> 00:04:59,402
Yeah.

118
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:00,653
My mom, too.

119
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:10,980
Is it okay if I ask one more question?

120
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,569
When can I go home?

121
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,596
This is exactly like
"<i>The Deep End of the Ocean</i>".

122
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:30,739
Michelle Pfeiffer movie.
Infant son...

123
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:32,911
Kidnapped. Reunited with the
mother ten years later.

124
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:34,044
It's very <i>"Lifetime"</i>.

125
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:35,219
<i>"Lifetime"</i>?

126
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:37,990
The cable Network.

127
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,153
Geared towards women.

128
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:41,668
You'd hate it.

129
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:44,167
Seriously Probie,
I don't make enough fun of you?

130
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,329
Knock it off, DiNozzo.

131
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:48,178
All roads lead to the father, boss.

132
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:50,324
<i>Brian Matthews, native of DC,</i>

133
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:52,890
married his high school sweetheart,
Lisa, at 19.

134
00:05:52,905 --> 00:05:54,576
Two months later, Carson was born.

135
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:55,996
Good old shotgun wedding.

136
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,267
Six weeks after giving birth,
Lisa Drowned.

137
00:05:58,282 --> 00:05:59,788
Death was ruled accidental.

138
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:01,649
Brian Matthews took it bad,
lost his job,

139
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,240
started hanging with the wrong crowd.

140
00:06:03,277 --> 00:06:04,614
The dead wife's mother

141
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:07,065
sued him for full custody of Carson
and won.

142
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:09,197
Explains why he took Carson and ran.

143
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:11,576
Somebody just earned
their detective badge.

144
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:12,934
You talk to the grandmother?

145
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:15,509
No. Died a year ago.

146
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:16,531
Heart attack.

147
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:19,472
Brian Matthews became Brian Taylor,
ended up living in Franklin.

148
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:21,218
He and Carson started a new life.

149
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:22,624
- Remarried?
- Yes.

150
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,826
Lieutenant Elaine Taylor.

151
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:26,740
Works anti-fraud for Naval Procurement.

152
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:27,901
Think she knows?

153
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,648
Well, there's only one way to find out.

154
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:31,379
McGee.

155
00:06:32,937 --> 00:06:33,999
Lose the uni.

156
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:37,189
- Where's the kid?
- Abby's got him.

157
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:39,059
- Our Abby?
- Alone with a minor?

158
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:40,211
He'll be fine.

159
00:06:55,675 --> 00:06:56,675
Can I help you?

160
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:58,734
NCIS.

161
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:00,163
Oh, my God,

162
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:01,710
Carson?
Wha-What happened?

163
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:02,725
Carson's fine.

164
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:03,786
He's still in DC.

165
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:06,623
I don't understand.
What's this about?

166
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:08,440
Your husband.

167
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:09,947
He's wanted for kidnapping.

168
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:14,414
Be better if we came inside, Lieutenant.

169
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:21,005
This is all a big misunderstanding.

170
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:23,109
I'd rather hear that from Brian.

171
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:25,436
You will, on Tuesday,
when he gets back.

172
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:26,693
Gets back?

173
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:28,708
<i>He's away, teaching a class.</i>

174
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:29,779
Where?

175
00:07:29,842 --> 00:07:30,940
Black Ridge Woods.

176
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:32,322
Survival class.

177
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:34,586
<i>Carson mentioned it.</i>

178
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:36,383
Of course he did.

179
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,498
He's very proud of his father.

180
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:40,565
Is there any way to contact
your husband?

181
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:42,385
First rule of survivalism: no phones,

182
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,030
no radios, so if you want to talk to

183
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:46,378
Brian before Tuesday,
you're gonna have to go find him.

184
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,008
Processed Taylor's office, his files,

185
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:54,908
computer, maps of Black Ridge,

186
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:56,518
What?

187
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:57,888
Look around, Tony.

188
00:07:58,014 --> 00:07:59,240
Tell me what you see.

189
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:01,684
I...

190
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:03,439
see...

191
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:05,549
<i>"Zero-Hour"</i>. It's a great flick.

192
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:13,119
Swimsuit editions.

193
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,730
Bet his dad's been looking for these.

194
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:18,792
Wait a second.

195
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:22,096
No. Ho, oh, oh!

196
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:24,052
No!

197
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:25,936
You know what this is?
This is a red

198
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:27,427
Ferrari G. T.

199
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:28,576
Just like <i>Magnum</i>!

200
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:29,660
Yes!

201
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,836
Just like <i>Magnum</i>.

202
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:31,843
I can't...

203
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,440
Even the rims are the same.

204
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:35,825
You're missing the point.

205
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,848
Which is?

206
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,136
The room, Tony.

207
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:41,149
Does it remind you of someone?

208
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:42,878
No. Not really.

209
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:45,694
You think this comes in a king?

210
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:49,327
<i>How much do you know about Brian's past?</i>

211
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,322
I know that he had it rough.

212
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,479
He didn't know his dad
and his mom died when he was 16.

213
00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:55,724
Carson's mother?

214
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:57,660
You're looking at her.

215
00:08:58,321 --> 00:08:59,330
Biological?

216
00:09:01,902 --> 00:09:03,567
She drowned.
That's all I know.

217
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:05,847
Never been curious?

218
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:07,639
Brian is a very private person.

219
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:09,138
He's your husband.

220
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:11,788
And I'm his wife, not his therapist,
Agent McGee.

221
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,403
How'd you two meet?

222
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:17,487
I took his class...

223
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:19,264
and hated it.

224
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:21,679
I thought some time in the woods
would do me good

225
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:24,365
sleeping under the stars,
relieve some stress.

226
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,380
Didn't work, huh?

227
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,295
I got poison ivy. Everywhere.

228
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,435
<i>Brian rushed me home and</i>

229
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,974
a couple of months later,
I moved in with him and Carson.

230
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:33,842
I want my son.

231
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:34,927
Stepson.

232
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,368
You never legally adopted him.

233
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:37,877
- So?
- So,

234
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:39,627
legally, we can't release him to you.

235
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,032
This is completely ridiculous.
You can't do this.

236
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:45,654
What have you done with him?
Where is he?

237
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,206
He's at NCIS, for now.

238
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,147
Legal or not, he's my child.

239
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:52,304
You can't possibly expect for me
to let him stay with some stranger.

240
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:54,055
That or Social Services.

241
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,466
Your choice, Lieutenant.

242
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,810
I need to see him.

243
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:01,990
Okay.

244
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,718
Soon.

245
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,962
You have kids, Agent Gibbs?

246
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,107
No.
I don't.

247
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,517
I didn't think so.

248
00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:22,154
24-hours surveillance on the house.

249
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,517
If she makes a phone call, McGee,
I want to know about it.

250
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:25,606
What about Carson?

251
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,219
Hands are tied, Ziva.

252
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:29,408
Untie them.
You can't just keep him from his mother.

253
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:31,138
- Not his mother.
- She raised him.

254
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:33,251
You want a family reunion, Ziva?

255
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:34,791
Prove she wasn't involved.

256
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:39,211
<i>This 2001 animated film</i>

257
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:41,754
starred Mike Myers
and spawned two sequels.

258
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:43,321
What is... <i>"Shrek"</i>?

259
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,561
Also starring Cameron Diaz
and Eddie Murphy.

260
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:47,301
<i>Correct. Okay.</i>

261
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,656
Oscars?

262
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,715
Best Animated Feature.

263
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,564
Nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay,

264
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:56,058
but lost to a Beautiful Mind.

265
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:57,139
Yes!

266
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:02,087
Amazing.

267
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:03,125
What's amazing?

268
00:11:03,216 --> 00:11:06,579
I'm playing Box Office Trivia
with Carson, and he's got mad skills.

269
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:11,859
1,500 points!

270
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:13,014
New high score.

271
00:11:13,044 --> 00:11:14,838
DiNozzo's reign is over.

272
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:17,168
What are you?
Some kind of little savant?

273
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:20,968
Whenever my dad leaves, my mom
and I stay up late and watch movies.

274
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:22,870
Tony's record stood for over two years.

275
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:24,671
My dad leaves a lot.

276
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:30,480
Is that my dad's computer?

277
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:34,244
Yeah.

278
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:37,082
We had to borrow it for a little bit.

279
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:39,582
How come?

280
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:41,833
I just have to look through his stuff.

281
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:43,596
You know, to try to help sort this out.

282
00:11:43,696 --> 00:11:45,519
And while she is doing that, you and I

283
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:46,876
are gonna hang.

284
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:49,225
How does that sound, man?
We'll get some pizza,

285
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,170
play some video games, maybe a movie.

286
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,517
Your mom packed that for you.

287
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:56,384
It looked to me like she put
some pretty nice stuff in there.

288
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:01,156
That is a very nice DVD player.

289
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:06,501
My mom wouldn't let me bring it on

290
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:07,900
the bus when I left.

291
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,138
We got in a huge fight.

292
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,368
I left without kissing her good-bye.

293
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:19,018
You know the great

294
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:21,037
thing about moms is that

295
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:22,920
whatever you do or say,

296
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:24,987
they always forgive you.

297
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:31,335
Okay.

298
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:35,199
Ready.

299
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:36,436
Come on.

300
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,218
<i>All right, so,
what kind of pizza are we going to get?</i>

301
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:00,043
I need a signature.

302
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:02,510
For?

303
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:04,727
Carson Taylor.
Turning him over to Social Services.

304
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:06,889
What about his stepmother?

305
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:07,880
No,

306
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:10,702
not his legal guardian,
and way too many unanswered questions.

307
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:14,031
Problem?

308
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,443
No, I...

309
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:17,913
I'm just surprised
that you're not trying

310
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:20,681
to talk me into letting him stay
with someone from here.

311
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:22,725
Not an option.
We're not babysitters.

312
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,031
So you're turning him over
to Child Welfare?

313
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:26,093
No. You are.

314
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,273
You are.

315
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:28,601
Soon as you sign it.

316
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:34,530
It's late on Friday night.

317
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:37,176
I mean, who's still hanging around
in Social Services?

318
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,984
Have you got a better idea?

319
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,236
He can stay with me.

320
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:43,983
Are you sure?

321
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:44,906
No.

322
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:48,782
But given my options,
it's the decision I'm making.

323
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:52,598
Okay,
you should meet your new houseguest.

324
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:55,700
Guarantee he's better than the last.

325
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,343
Jethro...

326
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:02,492
this is a case report.

327
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:05,521
Not a custody transfer.

328
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:08,446
Must've grabbed the wrong folder.

329
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:10,730
Go figure.

330
00:14:19,922 --> 00:14:21,444
Looks like we missed the party.

331
00:14:21,618 --> 00:14:24,025
At his age, the party never ends.

332
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,518
Could be a long night.

333
00:14:25,687 --> 00:14:27,227
Not just for you, Director.

334
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:30,567
I lifted Brian Taylor's prints
off his computer and his files.

335
00:14:30,597 --> 00:14:31,889
AFIS got another hit.

336
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,804
They were all over a Beretta

337
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,900
used in an unsolved shooting
in May of '98.

338
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,229
The same month Brian
and Carson disappeared.

339
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:41,510
He's not running
because he kidnapped Carson.

340
00:14:41,992 --> 00:14:43,892
He's running
because he's wanted for murder.

341
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,715
Black Ridge Woods are closed off.

342
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,474
DC Metro's cold case files

343
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:00,843
are already <i>en route</i>.

344
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:02,091
<i>En route?</i>

345
00:15:02,462 --> 00:15:03,677
Offered to hand deliver.

346
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:04,831
And you agreed?

347
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:07,009
That's one of the oldest
tricks in the book,

348
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:08,685
the hand delivery, Ziva.

349
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,321
It's Metro's way of making
sure they stay involved in the case.

350
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:12,396
You think?

351
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,486
Why else would they personally
deliver the files?

352
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:16,617
To see your pretty face, DiNozzo.

353
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,442
It's been a long time.

354
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,992
Not long enough, Collins.

355
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:26,188
Old friends?

356
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:28,652
Detective Collins
is on Metro's cold case squad.

357
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,544
He and I worked a couple homicides
back when I was on Baltimore P. D.

358
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:33,077
And, unfortunately, we're

359
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,367
0-for-2.

360
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:35,515
Third time's a charm.

361
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:37,740
Catch a break we'll have
this case closed by Monday.

362
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:39,661
"We"?

363
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:40,914
Danielle Hamilton.

364
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:42,586
I'm looking forward to working with you.

365
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:47,243
Hey, DiNozzo,
think you could rustle up some coffee?

366
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,448
Sure thing.

367
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:53,359
This is not my fault.

368
00:15:53,374 --> 00:15:54,566
Tell that to Gibbs.

369
00:15:55,676 --> 00:15:56,809
<i>Here's the other one.</i>

370
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,674
Maybe you could turn it off now!

371
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:04,341
What?!

372
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:07,062
I said maybe you could turn
off the siren now!

373
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:10,889
You need to turn off the damn siren!

374
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:18,088
You think that's funny?

375
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:19,364
Very.

376
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:20,763
Where to next?

377
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:24,597
Let's see.

378
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:26,678
You've seen autopsy,

379
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,934
and you've seen my lab...

380
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:30,782
You've seen everything.

381
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:33,473
Not... everything.

382
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:36,162
Forget about the tattoos, okay?

383
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,266
It is not happening.

384
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:39,924
<i>Come on, not even a little peek?</i>

385
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:41,119
Hey, big man.

386
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:42,924
What's that?

387
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:48,015
Come to take me home, Agent Gibbs?

388
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,088
I'm not going home, am I?

389
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:55,071
Not tonight.

390
00:16:58,037 --> 00:16:59,135
I want my mom.

391
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:01,657
I mean...

392
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,257
she must be worried.

393
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:06,019
She misses you.

394
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,562
It's Friday night.

395
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:09,013
Fright Night.

396
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:13,249
We make double-fudge <i>S'Mores</i>
and watch scary movies.

397
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:14,998
It sounds nice.

398
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:16,683
Here.

399
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:18,983
You want to call her?
Make sure she's doing okay.

400
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:21,102
She'd like that.

401
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:28,273
Hi, Mom.

402
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:29,570
It's me.

403
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,507
<i>Hello. How are you doing?</i>

404
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:32,747
Yeah, I'm okay.

405
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:33,833
Are you okay?

406
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:36,050
<i>Yeah, I'm okay, but I miss you.</i>

407
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:38,305
<i>You know I love you, don't you?</i>

408
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:40,039
Miss you. I love you, too.

409
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:42,935
Hey, have you started the <i>S'Mores</i> yet?

410
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:44,032
<i>No, not yet.</i>

411
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:45,422
Make sure to save some for me.

412
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:46,697
<i>Of course I will.</i>

413
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:50,114
<i>May second of '98, two assailants
enter the</i> Stop 'N Go Mart,

414
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:52,597
our witnesses describe
them both as Caucasian,

415
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:54,148
about six foot, a buck-seventy.

416
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,791
Description matches Brian Taylor.

417
00:17:55,812 --> 00:17:57,214
Matches a lot of people.

418
00:17:57,229 --> 00:17:58,416
Including you, Collins.

419
00:17:58,514 --> 00:18:00,143
Give or take five pounds, maybe ten.

420
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:03,807
Clerk hands over the cash
without any argument or struggle.

421
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,220
<i>But that wasn't enough.</i>

422
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:08,051
<i>- Dead before he hit the floor.</i>
- Motive?

423
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:09,535
Thrill, Officer David.

424
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:11,790
We believe we're dealing
with two cold-blooded killers.

425
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,115
We've been over this case
a thousand times, it's textbook.

426
00:18:14,116 --> 00:18:15,252
You haven't solved it.

427
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:16,368
<i>Some cases take time.</i>

428
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,614
Nine years?

429
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,208
We've been looking for a lead.

430
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,409
And now we've found it.

431
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,567
We found it.

432
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:24,236
We have boxes of DNA
evidence from the scene.

433
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:26,758
- We'll find a match.
- All we need is Brian Taylor.

434
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,335
Good luck finding him,
he's teaching a class in Black Ridge.

435
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,895
Okay, so we send out a search party.

436
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,328
If he hears us coming,
his students become hostages.

437
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,370
So we just wait?

438
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,422
Yeah, you never were very good at that,
were you, Collins?

439
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:40,099
You still have the highest arrest rate
in your precinct?

440
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,527
- Yeah.
- Still bucking for that Captain's job.

441
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:43,643
One day.

442
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:44,894
<i>Found something.</i>

443
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:47,308
Filtered through Brian Taylor's
electronic maps.

444
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:49,593
He keeps a log of all his locations:

445
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:52,802
training exercises,
rest areas, and most importantly...

446
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:54,041
His base camp.

447
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:56,314
- <i>Seven miles from Highway 9.</i>
- If we leave now,

448
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:58,062
- we can be there by morning.
- Take Ziva.

449
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:00,670
- We'll follow.
- No, I don't think so, Detective.

450
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:02,383
Here to help, Agent Gibbs.

451
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:04,813
Good. Let's go over all
that evidence you have.

452
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,657
And then?

453
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:08,238
And then...
you can help...

454
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:10,157
when I ask.

455
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:16,283
Yeah, Gibbs.

456
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:18,677
Sorry to call so late, Agent Gibbs.

457
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:20,505
Hey, Carson, you okay?

458
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:23,808
I just remembered a couple things
I thought you should know.

459
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,356
About my dad.

460
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:26,946
I'll be right there.

461
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,342
Well, looks like it's just you and me,
David.

462
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:33,911
Nothing more relaxing
than a long road trip.

463
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:35,442
I'm driving.

464
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:36,502
I'm dead.

465
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:41,934
Surprised it took you so long.

466
00:19:42,118 --> 00:19:43,428
To check up on me.

467
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,562
Except that's not
why you're here, is it?

468
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:57,139
Which explains where my cell phone went.

469
00:19:57,673 --> 00:19:58,487
Kids.

470
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:01,009
Jazz.

471
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:03,319
His favorite.

472
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:05,943
<i>Ziva was right.</i>

473
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:08,187
DiNozzo.

474
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:17,783
You get lost, Agent Gibbs?

475
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:20,579
<i>I called almost an hour ago.</i>

476
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:22,184
Well, I'm here now.

477
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:23,477
You want to tell me why?

478
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:27,178
You get mad easily?

479
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:29,386
Depends on who you ask.

480
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:34,238
I lied...

481
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,913
about my dad.

482
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,289
I just wanted you to come over.

483
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:41,156
Why?

484
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:43,315
To talk.

485
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:45,378
Okay.

486
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:47,531
Want me to start?

487
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:51,411
You're the one with the questions.

488
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:52,794
Good point.

489
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:58,457
Why can't I go home?

490
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:02,408
Because we need time to do our job.

491
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,742
You mean to find my dad?

492
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:09,630
You think he did something wrong?

493
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:11,273
Not sure yet.

494
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,561
My dad never breaks the rules.

495
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:14,884
Ever.

496
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:17,981
This is all my fault.

497
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:20,451
Me and my stupid field trip...

498
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:21,468
Carson...

499
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:22,967
this is not your fault.

500
00:21:24,502 --> 00:21:25,900
It was my fingerprint.

501
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:30,351
What are you going to do
when you find him?

502
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:31,493
Talk.

503
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:33,734
He'll tell you the truth, Agent Gibbs.

504
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,906
He says telling the truth
is his number one rule.

505
00:21:39,218 --> 00:21:40,900
Well, he sounds like my kind of guy.

506
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:43,244
Mine, too.

507
00:21:45,531 --> 00:21:46,615
Time for <i>Letterman</i>.

508
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:48,402
Time for bed.

509
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:50,294
But I'm not even tired.

510
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:53,898
Can I finish my hot chocolate first?

511
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:55,744
Sure.

512
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:00,904
I forgot.

513
00:22:02,117 --> 00:22:02,931
What?

514
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:04,867
How good you are with kids.

515
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:08,755
You think he knows more
than he's letting on?

516
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:12,489
Think he's worried about his dad, that's
why he doesn't want to go to sleep.

517
00:22:16,853 --> 00:22:18,748
Guess he's not worried anymore.

518
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:28,093
He'll be fine.

519
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:31,531
It's been a long time.

520
00:22:32,723 --> 00:22:33,572
Us.

521
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,146
Together outside of the office.

522
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:37,823
Paris.

523
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,950
If you don't count hospitals
and car chases.

524
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:43,438
I don't.

525
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:47,107
Yeah, once upon a time,
I would have asked you to stay.

526
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:50,205
And I wouldn't have taken
no for an answer.

527
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:52,869
No.

528
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,902
What happened, Jethro?

529
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:58,540
You made a choice.

530
00:22:59,453 --> 00:23:01,347
I had to do what was best for me.

531
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:04,103
I still do.

532
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,836
This is gonna suck.

533
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,178
Stop complaining.

534
00:23:18,193 --> 00:23:20,564
Sorry.
No sleep tends to do that to me.

535
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:23,013
I drove, Tony. You could
have slept all night if you wanted.

536
00:23:23,023 --> 00:23:26,426
I tried, but the orchestra
of blaring car horns kept me awake.

537
00:23:26,857 --> 00:23:27,947
We made good time.

538
00:23:27,962 --> 00:23:30,003
Going 95 miles an hour on a dirt road

539
00:23:30,018 --> 00:23:31,408
I couldn't even see.

540
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:33,229
Then it's a good thing I was driving.

541
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:37,455
I am a trained navigator, Tony.

542
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,357
Yeah? Well, I got an A in Geography.

543
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:41,781
Plus, I'm Senior Field Agent.
I'm pulling rank.

544
00:23:42,694 --> 00:23:44,092
I'm also a trained assassin.

545
00:23:46,276 --> 00:23:47,459
We'll shoot for it.

546
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:48,695
Best two out of three.

547
00:23:55,742 --> 00:23:56,875
Snip, snip.

548
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,958
I'll take that.

549
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:00,438
Okay. All right.

550
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:04,683
<i>All right. Topographic.</i>

551
00:24:04,754 --> 00:24:06,027
It speaks my language.

552
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:08,223
Follow me.
I got it.

553
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:14,346
- What?!
- The trail...

554
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:16,613
It's this way.

555
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:23,233
<i>Would you ever share
your personal computer with someone?</i>

556
00:24:23,526 --> 00:24:25,803
No, McGee. That's worse
than sharing your toothbrush.

557
00:24:26,106 --> 00:24:27,907
- Why?
- I found a user account

558
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:30,166
for Lieutenant Taylor
on Brian Taylor's hard drive.

559
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:31,971
At least you found something.

560
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:35,020
I have been looking for the same
hair sample for, like, 20 minutes.

561
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:38,909
You know what my biggest pet peeve is,
McGee?

562
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,107
People saying they're vegetarians
but eat chicken.

563
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:44,566
Okay, yes.
Then what's my second biggest pet peeve?

564
00:24:44,886 --> 00:24:46,914
- Mishandled evidence.
- Yes, again.

565
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:48,917
I mean, there's absolutely...

566
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,042
- No excuse for it.
- Exactly.

567
00:24:51,384 --> 00:24:52,424
<i>Nine years ago,</i>

568
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:53,870
Metro's so-called

569
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:55,510
forensic scientist...

570
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,131
Carolyn Watson...
She just goes through the motions,

571
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:01,544
assuming that one day,
somebody like me...

572
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:03,144
Will clean up her mess.

573
00:25:03,145 --> 00:25:04,145
It's so...

574
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:07,415
Why do I feel
we've had this conversation before?

575
00:25:07,643 --> 00:25:10,528
Because we have. Just about every time
you get assigned a cold case.

576
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:14,752
I am not the only one that complains
around here, McGee.

577
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:17,931
You should see yourself when you're
filtering through a perp's computer.

578
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,781
"Who formatted this thing?"

579
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:22,756
"And they used clusters instead
of physical sectors for allocations,"

580
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:26,431
and then your face does this whole
weird annoyed/confused deal, like...

581
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:29,998
That's it!
You're doing it right now.

582
00:25:30,524 --> 00:25:31,524
She lied.

583
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:33,006
Who lied?

584
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:34,790
Elaine Taylor. She lied.

585
00:25:35,252 --> 00:25:36,389
Lied about what?

586
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:38,074
Lied about what, McGee?

587
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,264
Agent Gibbs.

588
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:45,139
Where's Carson?

589
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,888
Is he okay?

590
00:25:47,698 --> 00:25:48,698
Yeah, he's fine.

591
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,420
You're not.

592
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,780
Look familiar, Lieutenant?

593
00:25:56,636 --> 00:25:59,266
It's a background check
you ran on your husband two years ago.

594
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:04,187
These are e-mails you sent to
a private investigator asking him

595
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,285
<i>to look into your husband's past.</i>

596
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:08,121
Said you trusted him.

597
00:26:10,253 --> 00:26:11,783
I was trying to protect him.

598
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:13,321
From what?

599
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:16,733
From whatever Brian did
that made him run nine years ago.

600
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:19,835
How long have you known?

601
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:24,209
Since before we were married.

602
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:27,411
I always asked questions about...

603
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:30,190
his parents, Carson's mother,

604
00:26:30,383 --> 00:26:31,958
and he never gave a straight answer.

605
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,270
Started researching.

606
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:35,792
I found hundreds of Brian Taylors
from the DC area.

607
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,696
- But you never found your husband?
- No, I found him.

608
00:26:39,523 --> 00:26:41,773
In a picture
of his high school tennis team.

609
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:47,385
- That one?
- I saw the caption said that

610
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:49,720
his surname was Matthews, but...

611
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:54,134
I never had any doubt.
I knew it was him.

612
00:26:54,744 --> 00:26:56,130
<i>And when you confronted him?</i>

613
00:26:56,587 --> 00:26:57,587
She didn't.

614
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:00,670
I was afraid of losing him.

615
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:06,790
My husband ran for a reason,
and I'm sure it was a damn good one.

616
00:27:06,843 --> 00:27:07,914
It was.

617
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:09,548
Murder.

618
00:27:11,692 --> 00:27:12,873
Killed a store clerk.

619
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:16,389
No, Brian could never hurt anyone.

620
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:18,948
- Brian Taylor or Brian Matthews?
- They're the same person.

621
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,262
People change, Lieutenant.

622
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,849
My husband is a good man,

623
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:25,794
and an even better father.

624
00:27:25,795 --> 00:27:27,586
He coaches Little League,
he's in the PTA,

625
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,641
and no matter where he is
or what he's doing,

626
00:27:29,711 --> 00:27:31,861
he always calls his son
to say good night.

627
00:27:33,116 --> 00:27:34,195
Always?

628
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,459
It's going to be all blues
in the ice bucket.

629
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,048
- Ready?
- Ready and go.

630
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,450
Hey, where's your cell phone?

631
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,360
- Excuse me?
- Give me your cell phone.

632
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:55,368
<i>- What's he doing?
- Not sure.</i>

633
00:27:55,432 --> 00:27:57,451
Satellite phone number.
Called last night, 11:30.

634
00:27:58,023 --> 00:27:59,142
<i>Can you locate it?</i>

635
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:01,037
If the phone's still on,

636
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:02,505
- I can triangulate it.
- Do it.

637
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,204
Want to share, Agent Gibbs?

638
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:06,462
Your phone bill just got bigger.

639
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,440
What?

640
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,511
<i>- A couple more minutes.
- Come on, survivor man,</i>

641
00:28:22,512 --> 00:28:23,936
<i>if I wasn't freezing to death...</i>

642
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:25,740
<i>- Federal Agent!
- Do not move!</i>

643
00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:27,092
Where is Taylor?

644
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,697
I don't know.

645
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:30,171
Is this part of the training?

646
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,601
- DiNozzo.
- Hey, give me some good news.

647
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:36,434
We're at the base camp.

648
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:37,853
Taylor's not.

649
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:39,945
He got tipped off.

650
00:28:40,138 --> 00:28:41,197
<i>Yeah. By who?</i>

651
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:45,329
Does this mean I'm going to jail?

652
00:28:55,056 --> 00:28:56,793
<i>When did you realize Taylor was gone?</i>

653
00:28:57,132 --> 00:28:58,987
This morning, around 5:00 a.m.

654
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:01,462
And we've been out here alone
ever since.

655
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:03,160
Heartbreaking.

656
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:06,279
You stop that!

657
00:29:12,248 --> 00:29:14,459
- Did you see which way he went?
- I heard a noise.

658
00:29:14,864 --> 00:29:16,314
Middle of the night.

659
00:29:16,728 --> 00:29:18,513
- Behind us.
- A noise?

660
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:20,257
Like... Like running.

661
00:29:20,873 --> 00:29:22,301
I took a look to check it out.

662
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:24,093
It was just a deer.

663
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:26,506
A deer?

664
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,141
A big one.

665
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:29,528
Big, big deer.

666
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:33,107
Whatever you think is best, Director.

667
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:36,047
City slickers saw something.

668
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:39,167
A deer. It was a big one.

669
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,091
Director Shepard wants us
to hold our position

670
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:43,362
while McGee attempts
to locate Taylor's signal.

671
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:44,410
If he doesn't?

672
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:46,448
A search team
is on its way to assist us.

673
00:29:46,904 --> 00:29:48,776
What about our courageous frontiersmen?

674
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:51,654
They will be escorted out
when the search team arrives.

675
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,218
Lucky them.

676
00:29:53,716 --> 00:29:55,412
I've got to tell you, Agent Gibbs,

677
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:57,073
you're full of surprises.

678
00:29:57,828 --> 00:29:58,832
That right?

679
00:29:59,474 --> 00:30:00,954
Ice cream as a punishment?

680
00:30:02,597 --> 00:30:04,247
There's no way I saw that coming.

681
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,218
What makes you think
you're being punished?

682
00:30:09,103 --> 00:30:10,278
I messed up.

683
00:30:10,863 --> 00:30:11,903
You did?

684
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:13,842
I called my dad.

685
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:16,292
Told him you guys were looking for him.

686
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,729
You just told the truth.

687
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:20,302
Yeah, but...

688
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:23,235
No buts.

689
00:30:24,118 --> 00:30:26,079
You were trying to protect your dad.

690
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,882
He said he's gonna be gone for a while.

691
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:34,903
I told him all about you.

692
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:37,404
Said he'd like to meet you one day.

693
00:30:41,534 --> 00:30:43,318
I told him you were on our side.

694
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:49,030
Everyone's been really great to me here.

695
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,564
Agent Gibbs,

696
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:52,586
between you and me...

697
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:56,474
I'm ready for this to be over.

698
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:02,869
<i>Study those photographs, Mr. Palmer.</i>

699
00:31:03,384 --> 00:31:05,024
<i>Tell me what you see.</i>

700
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:07,642
Brian Taylor and his son...

701
00:31:07,972 --> 00:31:09,649
- fishing.
- Yeah, and that one?

702
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:11,778
Father and son hiking.

703
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:13,066
What about those?

704
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:14,715
Father and son...

705
00:31:14,796 --> 00:31:17,246
They're all the same, Doctor.
Carson and his dad

706
00:31:17,256 --> 00:31:18,689
- hanging out.
- Precisely.

707
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,828
Abby printed over a hundred photographs
from Brian Taylor's computer.

708
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,253
And all of them are similar
in nature to these.

709
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,090
I see.

710
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:31,475
Actually, I don't think I see as clearly
as I think you see.

711
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:34,989
Mr. Palmer, when conducting
a psychological analysis,

712
00:31:35,028 --> 00:31:37,671
the first thing you have to do
is establish patterns.

713
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:40,375
Because patterns are the most
efficient gateway into the mind.

714
00:31:40,618 --> 00:31:42,296
You read your study material.

715
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:43,531
I'm impressed.

716
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,965
But it seems like the only patterns
we see here

717
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,580
are that Brian Taylor enjoyed
spending time with his son.

718
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,390
And?

719
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:54,125
In pursuits devoid
of typical human contact.

720
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,864
And that's bad, because...

721
00:31:56,391 --> 00:31:57,838
Your job is not to judge,

722
00:31:57,876 --> 00:31:59,179
but to understand.

723
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,837
The father's pursuit

724
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:04,073
of solitude is indicative
of a far deeper problem.

725
00:32:04,195 --> 00:32:05,676
- Which would be...?
- Trust...

726
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:09,190
- Lack of it.
- The evidence is all here, Jethro.

727
00:32:09,723 --> 00:32:11,498
Separate bank accounts from his wife.

728
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:14,990
A date book that shows
very little social interaction.

729
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:16,497
And, of course...

730
00:32:17,865 --> 00:32:19,904
- His job.
- Survivalist training.

731
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:22,378
It's a field which typically

732
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:25,535
lures a very specific type
of personality.

733
00:32:25,603 --> 00:32:26,627
Loners.

734
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:29,301
And that leads us to his diary.

735
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:33,501
It shows that he has very few social
engagements other than with his son.

736
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:36,620
He had led a troubled life
that is full of pain.

737
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,771
And Mr. Palmer, someone
who's experienced this much pain

738
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,858
often finds release in the form of rage.

739
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:45,876
Or murder.

740
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:47,511
And to think,

741
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:50,027
they never gave him study material.

742
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:56,204
<i>God, these are new boots.</i>

743
00:32:56,492 --> 00:32:58,416
<i>This is not the time
for sightseeing, Tony.</i>

744
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:00,378
<i>The only sight I see is your big,
black...</i>

745
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,818
<i>- Hey!
- backpack</i>

746
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:03,342
<i>walking faster.</i>

747
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,265
<i>- Are you injured or something?
- No.</i>

748
00:33:06,513 --> 00:33:07,905
<i>I did stop for a water break.</i>

749
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:09,777
<i>Humans do that sometimes.</i>

750
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:16,193
Taylor's phone was just activated, Tony.

751
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:17,541
We're tracking it now.

752
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:18,893
<i>Yeah, welcome to the club.</i>

753
00:33:19,151 --> 00:33:20,715
I wish I could say it's a fun one.

754
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:22,356
You sound tired, DiNozzo.

755
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,732
<i>Following Ziva.</i>

756
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:25,126
Even the dogs are tired.

757
00:33:26,582 --> 00:33:29,125
<i>Tony, Taylor's heading
right towards you. Keep your course.</i>

758
00:33:29,236 --> 00:33:30,256
<i>How far?</i>

759
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:32,160
A hundred yards, give or take.

760
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:34,747
Looks like he's passing
through some sort of clearing.

761
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:36,418
- Maybe a...
<i>- Dirt road?</i>

762
00:33:36,677 --> 00:33:38,104
Yeah. How'd you...?

763
00:33:38,105 --> 00:33:39,784
<i>Well, we're staring at it, McGee.</i>

764
00:33:40,817 --> 00:33:42,187
<i>Talk to me, DiNozzo.</i>

765
00:33:43,157 --> 00:33:44,157
<i>Got a visual.</i>

766
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:53,315
<i>Stop! Federal Agents!</i>

767
00:33:58,481 --> 00:33:59,841
Problem, sweetheart?

768
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:01,302
Do not move.

769
00:34:02,293 --> 00:34:03,293
Cab is clear.

770
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:14,128
Looks like this is gonna be
a long night.

771
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,637
<i>A casino?</i>

772
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:18,930
A hotel?

773
00:34:20,064 --> 00:34:21,181
Spring break?

774
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:23,369
A mansion?

775
00:34:25,384 --> 00:34:26,834
I got it, I got it.

776
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:28,989
<i>"The Playboy Mansion"</i>.

777
00:34:29,326 --> 00:34:30,482
Playboy...

778
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:32,407
It's a school, Carson.

779
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,584
Sure you don't know Anthony DiNozzo?

780
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:40,409
Guys.

781
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:48,411
Are you okay, Abby?

782
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:50,351
I'm with child.

783
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:53,883
The director asked me
to watch Carson this morning,

784
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:56,208
so I enlisted Palmer's help.
Turns out...

785
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,024
he's a pretty good babysitter.

786
00:34:58,025 --> 00:35:00,301
Why exactly are you standing
by the elevator?

787
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,572
For privacy.

788
00:35:01,823 --> 00:35:04,133
I don't want <i>You-Know-Who</i> to hear.
Come on.

789
00:35:07,557 --> 00:35:09,485
So, I hacked the Globalstar database,

790
00:35:09,495 --> 00:35:12,172
and I accessed the call log
from Brian Taylor's sat-phone.

791
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:12,982
How?

792
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:14,532
Was not easy.

793
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:18,750
First, I exploited a weakness I found
in the network's packet filter...

794
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:19,586
Abby.

795
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:21,710
Sorry. Right.
Anyway, so,

796
00:35:22,214 --> 00:35:23,214
Taylor...

797
00:35:24,025 --> 00:35:25,202
made one phone call.

798
00:35:25,697 --> 00:35:26,700
<i>Ronald Keenan.</i>

799
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,667
That's good work.

800
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:32,792
Palmer, no gestures.

801
00:35:57,517 --> 00:35:59,109
<i>I repeat, this is 911.</i>

802
00:35:59,184 --> 00:36:00,573
<i>Please state your emergency.</i>

803
00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:03,718
<i>Officers have been dispatched
to your location...</i>

804
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,427
This young man never stood
a fighting chance,

805
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:24,582
<i>because, unfortunately, for him...</i>

806
00:36:24,752 --> 00:36:25,752
He didn't fight.

807
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:28,859
- Sorry, Doctor.
- <i>No, you're right.</i>

808
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:32,054
Note the lack of defensive wounds
on his forearms

809
00:36:32,421 --> 00:36:34,299
- and hands.
- He knew his attacker.

810
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:38,484
But judging by that hunting knife
in his chest,

811
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:42,271
I think we can presume that
their relationship had soured somewhat.

812
00:36:42,438 --> 00:36:45,477
Boss, I spoke with 911 dispatch.
Keenan didn't say a word.

813
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:48,264
Yes, well, given the circumstances,

814
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:51,163
<i>even dialing the phone was quite a feat.</i>

815
00:36:51,284 --> 00:36:53,966
It's amazing what a person can do
when their life depends on it.

816
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,573
We found a Taurus on Maple, Agent Gibbs.

817
00:36:59,828 --> 00:37:02,100
Stolen from Black Ridge parking lot
early this morning.

818
00:37:02,151 --> 00:37:03,151
Maple Street.

819
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,701
Any sign of Taylor?

820
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:06,832
Zip. Been combing the area
for over an hour.

821
00:37:07,344 --> 00:37:09,081
<i>My gut says he found another ride.</i>

822
00:37:09,256 --> 00:37:10,258
That's not all.

823
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:13,040
Blood on the door handle
and the steering wheel.

824
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:15,977
Maple Street, three blocks away.

825
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:20,697
<i>Ronald Keenan born
and raised in the DC area.</i>

826
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:23,302
Also happened to be one
of Brian Taylor's high school buddies.

827
00:37:23,398 --> 00:37:25,016
Metro interviewed him nine years ago.

828
00:37:25,017 --> 00:37:26,639
Said he didn't know why Taylor ran.

829
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:27,867
Maybe he didn't.

830
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,578
There's a reason he's dead.

831
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,947
Murder.

832
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,646
He's five-ten, 180 pounds.

833
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:34,415
He matches our witnesses' description.

834
00:37:34,646 --> 00:37:36,460
I think we just found
Taylor's accomplice.

835
00:37:36,649 --> 00:37:38,076
NCIS. Agent McGee.

836
00:37:38,136 --> 00:37:39,895
Taylor knows we have the murder weapon.

837
00:37:40,036 --> 00:37:42,772
Last thing he need was his accomplice
getting nervous and flipping.

838
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:45,345
Agent Gibbs...
Sure, I'll just get him for you now.

839
00:37:45,755 --> 00:37:47,598
Boss, Brian Taylor asking for you
by name.

840
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,704
Starting the trace.

841
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:55,830
Ready.

842
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:57,822
Special Agent Gibbs.

843
00:37:58,285 --> 00:37:59,754
<i>How's my son, Agent Gibbs?</i>

844
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,808
Scared. Confused.

845
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,300
That makes two of us.

846
00:38:05,644 --> 00:38:06,703
<i>You want sympathy?</i>

847
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:08,500
I want my life back.

848
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:11,205
<i>Which life, Brian Matthews'
or Brian Taylor's?</i>

849
00:38:11,918 --> 00:38:13,712
I ran because
I didn't wanna lose my son.

850
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:15,509
<i>I was naive.</i>

851
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:18,803
<i>I was a 20-year-old
who made a lot of mistakes.</i>

852
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:19,773
Murder.

853
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:21,365
I never killed anyone.

854
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:22,955
<i>Tell that to Keenan.</i>

855
00:38:23,778 --> 00:38:24,940
Keenan was my friend.

856
00:38:26,552 --> 00:38:28,230
<i>I'd hate to see your enemies.</i>

857
00:38:28,954 --> 00:38:30,403
Carson says you're good.

858
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,892
He says you're on our side.

859
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:36,237
Yeah, well, he's a smart kid.

860
00:38:37,094 --> 00:38:38,099
Are you?

861
00:38:38,812 --> 00:38:40,182
You on our side, Agent Gibbs?

862
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,540
<i>Come in.</i>

863
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,571
Tell me what happened.

864
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,322
I do that, my life's over.

865
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:48,745
- Not if you're innocent.
- <i>It's not that simple.</i>

866
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:51,627
You've got this all wrong.

867
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:57,141
Pay phone, north end of Rock Creek Park.

868
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:00,126
Call DiNozzo.

869
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:10,766
Pair up, spread out.

870
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,333
We'll take east of the creek,
the rest is yours.

871
00:39:13,343 --> 00:39:14,143
On it.

872
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,764
- <i>The north or the south?
- The south.</i>

873
00:39:19,836 --> 00:39:21,572
- <i>Yeah, Gibbs.</i>
- Big news, Gibbs.

874
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:23,164
The bloody fingerprints we found

875
00:39:23,305 --> 00:39:25,284
<i>on Keenan's phone,
they didn't belong to Keenan.</i>

876
00:39:25,433 --> 00:39:26,742
They were Brian Taylor's.

877
00:39:26,743 --> 00:39:29,347
- Means Taylor called 911.
- <i>And that's not all.</i>

878
00:39:29,622 --> 00:39:32,130
I've been looking at the evidence
from the <i>Stop 'N Go</i>,

879
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,302
- really sloppy police work.
- What have you got, Abby?

880
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:36,896
A strand of hair

881
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:39,673
- that has titanium dioxide.
- <i>English, Abby.</i>

882
00:39:40,065 --> 00:39:43,615
It's a synthetic gel,
but it didn't hit stores until 2002,

883
00:39:43,687 --> 00:39:45,114
which is strange because...

884
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:46,615
The murder happened in '98.

885
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:49,870
- Someone tampered with the evidence.
- According to the chain of evidence,

886
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,098
there were only two officers
that had access.

887
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,095
- You go that way.
- Got it.

888
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:09,266
- He wants us here.
- Why?

889
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:10,948
Pay phone number.

890
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:21,614
Hey, you were framed.

891
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:24,276
<i>I guess Carson was right,
you are on our side.</i>

892
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,243
Stay where you are.
I'll come to you.

893
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:28,131
<i>Not a chance.
I'm coming to you,</i>

894
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:29,715
<i>and only you.</i>

895
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,987
What are you doing, boss?

896
00:40:35,595 --> 00:40:36,598
My job.

897
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:44,640
<i>Don't move, Taylor!</i>

898
00:40:48,386 --> 00:40:49,638
<i>You armed?</i>

899
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,461
<i>Hold on to it.</i>

900
00:40:57,817 --> 00:40:59,468
Less for me to explain.

901
00:40:59,803 --> 00:41:01,972
- You killed Keenan.
<i>- Should have done it years ago.</i>

902
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:03,939
He was going to tell.

903
00:41:05,328 --> 00:41:06,426
From killer to cop.

904
00:41:07,419 --> 00:41:08,646
Funny how life works out.

905
00:41:09,129 --> 00:41:10,266
Why did you set me up?

906
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:12,002
I didn't. Spur of the moment.

907
00:41:13,173 --> 00:41:16,337
Just needed a gun, that's all.
Keenan said he knew a guy who had one.

908
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:17,700
Now I've got my own.

909
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:19,843
Government-issued.

910
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:21,202
<i>So is mine.</i>

911
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:24,326
Put it down.

912
00:41:29,499 --> 00:41:32,065
He's got a knife, Agent Gibbs.
I was just protecting myself.

913
00:41:35,213 --> 00:41:36,235
So was I.

914
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,507
<i>I should have done it years ago.</i>

915
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,480
<i>He was going to tell.</i>

916
00:41:46,992 --> 00:41:47,995
You set me up?

917
00:41:51,796 --> 00:41:52,838
Kind of ironic!

918
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:54,896
Looks like we're one for three, Collins.

919
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:02,748
One more answer correct, and...

920
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,632
I win my title back.

921
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,614
- From a ten-year-old.
- Who has just been through hell.

922
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:09,263
You mess with the bull...

923
00:42:09,942 --> 00:42:11,137
you get the horns.

924
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:13,059
No exceptions.

925
00:42:13,972 --> 00:42:14,819
All right.

926
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,949
<i>"In the 1985 film </i>Back to the Future,

927
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,841
<i>this device makes time travel possible."</i>

928
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:25,275
<i>Come on, baby, I'm back.</i>

929
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:28,301
What is the flux capaciter?

930
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:35,226
Wait, what happened?

931
00:42:35,295 --> 00:42:36,723
You spelled "capacitor" wrong.

932
00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:43,293
Tough break.

933
00:42:43,613 --> 00:42:44,800
I bow to the champion.

934
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:46,818
Handshake will do.

935
00:43:02,575 --> 00:43:04,725
<i>- There he is.
- My God, Carson!</i>

936
00:43:05,504 --> 00:43:06,720
<i>So glad you're okay.</i>

937
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,087
I'm really gonna miss him.

938
00:43:11,817 --> 00:43:13,270
There's something about that kid.

939
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:15,394
<i>I missed you so much.</i>

940
00:43:15,588 --> 00:43:16,606
<i>I missed you, too.</i>
