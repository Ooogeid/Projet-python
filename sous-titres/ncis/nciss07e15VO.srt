1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:05,505
Corporal Werth is your poster boy
for the Marine Corps.

2
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:08,508
Rapid improvement in every facet
since he enlisted four years ago:

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:12,136
strength, speed, stamina,
mental acuity, everything.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,388
McGee, back off!

5
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:18,225
Damon, what are you doing?

6
00:00:24,553 --> 00:00:25,733
Stay down.

7
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,586
Oh, man, my head.

8
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,349
Heatherton.

9
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:53,261
Yo, Heatherton.

10
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:55,931
Man, was that a party or what?

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,892
Step to it, Marine.

12
00:01:17,138 --> 00:01:19,257
All right. Home again, home again.

13
00:01:19,815 --> 00:01:21,756
Let's get some lights on in here.

14
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:25,036
Look at that.
You got rid of the piles of magazines.

15
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,502
Looks nice. Homey.

16
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,464
Not "homie" as, in,
you know, "You're my homie" I meant

17
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,466
the place.

18
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,711
I'm gonna check
your fridge for some food.

19
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:34,778
I just asked you to drive me, McGee.

20
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,668
Always happy to drive you, Boss.

21
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,439
But there's nothing in here
but fish food.

22
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,675
Well, you know what I could do?
I could feed the fish,

23
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,103
and if you get hungry,
you could eat the fish.

24
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:47,273
Sorry. It's a bad joke.

25
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:49,400
You need help with your shoes, or...

26
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:54,075
All right.

27
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:01,910
- Got a new lock on the front door.
- That's to keep out unwanted guests.

28
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,833
All right.
Pick you up in the morning.

29
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:19,767
I know my goldfish
didn't eat a T-bone.

30
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:25,696
Payback, Agent Gibbs.

31
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,152
NCIS Season 7 Episode 15
Jack-Knife 1.0 LOL

32
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,452
Synchro: Gaillots.

33
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,288
Rereading: Magic Turtle.

34
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,425
www.Team-NCIS.com

35
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:01,973
Friends are welcome.

36
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:04,193
You're not a friend.

37
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:05,585
I need your help.

38
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:07,808
I didn't want anyone
to see us talking.

39
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:09,192
You're paranoid.

40
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,107
I'm clean.

41
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,943
- I'm off the juice.
- Who do you think's watching you?

42
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:16,918
Guy named Aaron Szwed.
He's got a trucking company.

43
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:19,115
A friend from the Corps'
been doing work for him.

44
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:21,409
Questionable work.

45
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:25,454
Go on.

46
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,334
This is...

47
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,307
This is Heatherton and me.

48
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:34,425
After we got shipped stateside.

49
00:03:35,646 --> 00:03:37,609
Wife and kid left him.
He had some

50
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,094
trouble making
the transition back to civilian.

51
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,826
- Unlike you?
- I didn't carry him out of the desert

52
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,010
so he could wind up dead
in some alley tonight.

53
00:03:51,884 --> 00:03:53,236
He came by for a drink.

54
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:54,983
Partied.
He was upset.

55
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,666
He wanted to tell me something
about the last job, and I...

56
00:03:58,652 --> 00:03:59,572
You what?

57
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,033
I blacked out again.

58
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:04,368
Is your head straight?

59
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:06,911
I only had a couple of beers,
I swear.

60
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:09,373
You only had a couple you remember.

61
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:13,027
He's still laying out there, Gunny.

62
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:25,008
- Hey, McGee.
<i>- Yeah, Boss?</i>

63
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,266
Day's not over.

64
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,158
Well, it's...
It's the District.

65
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:48,120
So, technically,
it's Metro's jurisdiction.

66
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,713
But we can take it
if we find a reason.

67
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:52,037
Cooperating witness.

68
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,418
Heatherton's not active service.

69
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,879
Hasn't been
since he was wounded in Iraq.

70
00:04:58,875 --> 00:04:59,966
I'll call Metro.

71
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,957
If they can kick it to the Bureau's
violent crimes task force,

72
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:05,113
they can hand it off to us.

73
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,181
Get Ziva and DiNozzo out of bed.

74
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:08,683
What?

75
00:05:10,488 --> 00:05:11,671
Wake 'em up.

76
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:14,657
Right...

77
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:17,706
Get them out of bed, because it's
the middle of the night, they're asleep.

78
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:19,178
Yes.

79
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:21,845
Individual beds.
Get them out of individual beds.

80
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:23,406
I was confused. I thought...

81
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,533
Need some sleep yourself,
do you, McGee?

82
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,287
You got bags under your eyes.

83
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,624
It's a look that I'm going for.

84
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:36,033
Believe me now?

85
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:40,207
What was Heatherton doing for Szwed?

86
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:41,625
Driving a truck.

87
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,358
Like, serious driving.

88
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:45,761
Last run was cross country
and back in less than a week.

89
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:47,634
He...

90
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:49,662
he said he messed up, but he had to.

91
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:52,329
Something about being a human first.

92
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:56,939
Heatherton was recruiting me
for the next run.

93
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:58,254
And...

94
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,443
Szwed offered it to me.

95
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,686
When?

96
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:03,507
Before I came to see you.

97
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:07,616
I went to see Szwed
at his warehouse out in Manassas.

98
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:14,290
- You Lucas?
- Where's Heatherton?

99
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:16,292
Expecting two of you.

100
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:19,003
- You guys haven't seen him?
- Is this the wheelman?

101
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:20,282
Yeah.

102
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,840
But our boy Heatherton's
gone missing.

103
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:25,676
- That guy's unreliable.
- I'm not.

104
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:29,747
Your friend told me you can drive.

105
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:31,665
If the money's right.

106
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,823
Really?

107
00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:34,810
It's a two-man job.

108
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:36,491
We'll roll tomorrow.

109
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:38,938
I've got someone in mind.

110
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,952
This is a murder investigation.

111
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:44,487
Szwed's body man, Lucas,
he carries a jack knife.

112
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:47,405
- I think they killed him.
- You're not getting involved.

113
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,075
What do I tell his wife, Gibbs?

114
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:51,735
- What do I tell his little girl?
- I'll tell you.

115
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:53,609
You're just a witness here.

116
00:06:54,703 --> 00:06:56,526
And you're not a very good one.

117
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:02,129
I'm the guy taking
a dead man's place behind the wheel.

118
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:05,429
You need me, Gibbs.

119
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,693
- What happened to your face?
- What happened to your arm?

120
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:26,403
The job.

121
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,486
Same.

122
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:38,374
Office said you just got home
a few hours ago.

123
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:40,570
RICO case.

124
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,310
Couple of mob hits.

125
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:44,046
Deep cover.

126
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:46,048
No sugar?

127
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:53,200
Try not to look so chipper.

128
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:11,282
All right, go.

129
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,669
I'm taking your crime scene.

130
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,294
Let me hop in the shower.

131
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:19,957
Tobias.

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,200
Nice slippers.

133
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,299
Oh, sorry.

134
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:35,981
It's okay.

135
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:37,850
You were sleeping.

136
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,957
I know.

137
00:08:41,846 --> 00:08:45,704
It's kind of like being in a cave
with a hibernating bear, you know?

138
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,150
Makes me nervous.

139
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:49,850
I'll fall right back to sleep.

140
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:51,322
You can do that?

141
00:08:51,954 --> 00:08:53,104
Wish I could.

142
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:55,883
My brain.
Once I'm awoken, just...

143
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:59,694
keeps going.
Starts spinning. I can't stop it.

144
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:03,810
That would get irritating.

145
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:06,837
Yeah. I wish my brain had
an on/off switch, you know?

146
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,988
In the Corps, you learn to get
your sleep wherever you can.

147
00:09:12,205 --> 00:09:13,723
Well, that makes sense.

148
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:16,926
You never know what's going
to happen next, right?

149
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,262
Any time, Alice.

150
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:36,999
Boss. I wasn't sleeping.

151
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,411
Werth and I were just talking
about how...

152
00:09:40,134 --> 00:09:42,289
All right.
Let's go process the scene.

153
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:46,882
You're already doing it, aren't you?

154
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,930
This time of year,
gaining weight, I got knots.

155
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:01,568
- That's because you sleep in a chair.
- It's not a chair.

156
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,103
It's a not-chair?

157
00:10:04,618 --> 00:10:07,564
It's a top-of-the-line Comfortastic
brand gentlemen's reclining chaise

158
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:10,734
with a pretty terrific
massage feature and

159
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:12,736
pretty fantastic cup holder.

160
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,656
It is a massage chair
that gives you knots.

161
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:17,585
It is not healthy.

162
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,892
I can assure you, dear boy,
with the passing years,

163
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:24,455
the knots do not get any looser.

164
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:26,959
For the sake of your health,

165
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:28,755
give up the chair.

166
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:30,746
Can we just not...

167
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:34,842
not say "knot" anymore?
Thank you.

168
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:38,525
So, what are we...
What are we looking at here, Ducky?

169
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:42,182
Well, his throat's been slit with
what appears to be a serrated blade.

170
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,316
Blood loss would have been
extreme and immediate.

171
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,818
So, I would give you odds
that he did not...

172
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:52,853
It would have been quick.

173
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:59,281
Bureau's case file on Aaron Szwed

174
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:00,993
for interstate trafficking.

175
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:03,662
It's just allegations.

176
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,248
He runs a fleet of trucks
moving product overland.

177
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:07,652
That's legit.

178
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:09,793
His delivery rate is higher
than industry average.

179
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,159
Prices are higher, too.

180
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:14,342
He uses two drivers per rig,
alternating.

181
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:16,133
Heatherton told me
one's always armed.

182
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,511
Came across our radar last year,

183
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,719
when one of his drivers shot
a would-be highjacker.

184
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:23,682
The firearm was legally registered.

185
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:25,601
Szwed didn't take any flack.

186
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:29,813
Gerald Lucas is listed
as his head of security.

187
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:32,690
But I couldn't find
any employment records for Heatherton.

188
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:33,945
He was off the books.

189
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:36,153
Why don't we bring him in
and ask him about it?

190
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:37,778
Three reasons.

191
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,238
What's he moving?
Where's he moving it?

192
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:41,701
Who's he moving it for?

193
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,869
Tough to run an interrogation
if you don't know the...

194
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:46,442
who, what, why, where and how.

195
00:11:47,057 --> 00:11:48,207
We know the when.

196
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,626
Yeah, Duck?

197
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:53,253
About two minutes.

198
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:57,674
No, stay.

199
00:11:59,177 --> 00:11:59,938
Eat.

200
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:02,513
Drink.

201
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,244
No, I'm good.

202
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,103
You're good when I say you're good.

203
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:12,665
And the lab says you're good.

204
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:31,169
Cooperating witness, Jethro?

205
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:34,554
Come on, what's the real story?

206
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:37,548
He was a Marine.

207
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,567
He saved his friend's life.

208
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:41,883
A couple other guys, too.

209
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,890
Corps didn't work out?

210
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:47,224
Seems like a team guy.

211
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,369
He's a Marine who broke the rules.

212
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:50,644
You didn't lock him up?

213
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:56,316
I gave him a medal.

214
00:12:58,346 --> 00:12:59,903
I had one just lying around.

215
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:04,910
You know,
it's not like he's wearing your pin.

216
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:06,660
You're not going steady
with the guy.

217
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,245
Tobias, it didn't mean anything.

218
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:10,467
I think it meant something to him.

219
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,869
We can use the information he's got,
gives us the inside track.

220
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:24,627
But it doesn't go further than that.

221
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:27,060
It doesn't matter
what he thinks he owes his friend.

222
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:29,231
In some Eastern cultures,

223
00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:31,306
it is believed that
if you save a man's life,

224
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,730
you become responsible for him.

225
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,565
I can imagine the pain
the poor boy must be

226
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,562
experiencing at the loss.

227
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:40,976
Assuming he's part of one
of those Eastern cultures.

228
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,884
East, West, the mutual saving
of a life is a...

229
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:45,574
powerful bond.

230
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:49,288
As evidenced by the two of you.

231
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:51,915
- Is that why we're friends?
- It's more like shared misery.

232
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,707
God knows you've got enough
to go around.

233
00:13:54,044 --> 00:13:56,083
Hey, I'm a happy guy.

234
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,219
Since when?

235
00:13:58,358 --> 00:14:00,257
You don't know.
I haven't seen you in months.

236
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,642
Whose fault is that?
You only call when you need something.

237
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:04,645
Apparently when I need grief.

238
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,056
Staying on that subject
for a moment, if we could,

239
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,101
and the sad discoveries
I've made of the departed.

240
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,812
I've found severe fractures
of the first, second,

241
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,481
and third metacarpals.

242
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:19,983
- Recently?
- I just found them.

243
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:23,153
Very recent.

244
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,737
Yeah, it appears the bones have been
systematically crushed.

245
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:29,511
Someone tried to get him to talk.

246
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,783
I wonder what he had to say.

247
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:40,879
I'm awake.

248
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,278
We didn't say anything, McGee.

249
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:48,637
But you did something, didn't you?

250
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:50,681
What'd you do?

251
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:54,629
Did you try
and put my hand in this water?

252
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,321
- That's a little juvenile.
- You drew on my face, didn't you?

253
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,924
You drew on my face.

254
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:03,860
I suggested stripping you naked,
putting a tag on your toe

255
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,822
and dragging you down to Autopsy so when
you woke up you'd think you were dead.

256
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:08,824
But Ziva thought
it was in poor taste.

257
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:10,867
Thank you, Ziva.

258
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,036
I did not agree.

259
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:15,747
I think there are a lot of people
who'd like to see you naked.

260
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,049
Anything in Heatherton's apartment?

261
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,212
Nothing out of the ordinary,
Sleeping Beauty.

262
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:24,282
Szwed.

263
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,237
Couple of speeding tickets

264
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:28,995
two weeks ago.
One in Texas, one in New Mexico.

265
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:31,888
He gets around.

266
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:34,654
So, who's this confidential witness

267
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:37,274
that's got Gibbs so gung-ho
about taking this guy down?

268
00:15:38,028 --> 00:15:39,318
Confidential.

269
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:43,438
I see.
Well, in that case,

270
00:15:43,522 --> 00:15:46,363
I'm not gonna tell you what Ziva
did to you while you were napping.

271
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:48,983
Please,
Ziva didn't do anything to me.

272
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,532
Whatever you say, McGee.

273
00:15:57,654 --> 00:15:59,875
I was just peeing in a cup.

274
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,421
Yeah, Damon, let's...
let's head on down. Right this way.

275
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:06,413
Szwed's truck rolls in six hours.

276
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:07,598
What do you got?

277
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:10,052
- We got nothing.
- I don't like the sound of that.

278
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,554
We got nothing!

279
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,665
Szwed's a trafficker
who has escalated to murder.

280
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,518
- We gotta stop the truck.
- Or we can put someone on it.

281
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,192
We talking about letting Johnny Rambo
go all first blood again?

282
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,234
Gee, I hope not.

283
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,111
Putting way too much
trust in this guy.

284
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:30,218
Sounds like a big gamble, Jethro.

285
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:34,867
Let it ride.

286
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,228
- You told me to wake you up at 2:00.
- What?

287
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:01,399
It's 2:00.

288
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:03,996
Thanks.

289
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,694
Hey, remember
when you went to Africa?

290
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:10,809
Yeah, it left an impression.

291
00:17:10,893 --> 00:17:12,409
You think there's...

292
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:15,701
any chance that maybe
you came in contact with

293
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,580
a Tsetse fly that was carrying

294
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:21,739
the protozoan trypanosoma brucei?

295
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,248
Abby, I don't have sleeping sickness.
I'm just exhausted.

296
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,456
I had no idea how hard Gibbs works.

297
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,590
I mean, keeping up
with his schedule's gonna kill me.

298
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,314
McGee, you can't do that, okay?

299
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:34,335
He's been practicing this for,
like, years.

300
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,530
- Abby, I owe him.
- For saving your life?

301
00:17:36,742 --> 00:17:38,376
That's part of his job description.

302
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,584
He pushed me out of the way
of a speeding car.

303
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,811
Pushing people is really rude.

304
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,571
Seriously.

305
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:49,672
He's up at the crack of dawn,
if he goes to bed at all.

306
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:52,702
What exactly is running
through that guy's veins?

307
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:53,931
Coffee, McGee.

308
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,659
- Right, Boss.
- No, get me some.

309
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:00,746
On it, Boss.

310
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:04,287
And get everyone ready.

311
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,442
You're enjoying having a valet.

312
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:09,129
You done?

313
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:13,467
And the tox screen?

314
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,846
Positive for flunitrazepam.

315
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:19,473
Werth was roofied.

316
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,631
Is there anything else you need?

317
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:26,605
If there is, McGee'll do it.

318
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,491
Last one to use the van
should have to clean it out.

319
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:35,185
- There should be a rule.
- There is.

320
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:37,865
Who was the last one to use it?

321
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:39,034
You were.

322
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,643
I don't think so.

323
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:44,843
'Cause it smells like falafels.

324
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:46,417
And I know a certain

325
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,551
backup probie agent
that smells a little falafely.

326
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,046
You want to help?

327
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,382
Sure.

328
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:56,040
Thank you.

329
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:01,553
Probie?

330
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,343
Yeah, I'm in the process
of becoming a sworn NCIS agent.

331
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:08,294
Thought you had to be an American
citizen to join a federal agency.

332
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:10,547
I'm also in the process of becoming
an American citizen.

333
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:13,550
I thought you had to be
a legal resident for, you know...

334
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,799
There are a few strings
being tugged.

335
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:16,675
Pulled.

336
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:18,441
You pull strings.

337
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,825
You tug heart strings.

338
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:22,286
- The heart has strings?
- According to the poets.

339
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,537
Don't confuse the girl.

340
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,664
It's taken a lot of marionetting
to get her this far.

341
00:19:25,928 --> 00:19:27,415
And who's the puppet master?

342
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,456
Well, it's probably best
if we table the issue of qualifications

343
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,800
in case someone asks
how you're qualified to be on this op.

344
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:40,446
- Not my first rodeo.
- I know that, cowboy.

345
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,204
Okay, ready to roll here.

346
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,751
Yeah, Boss,
let's get this guy out of here.

347
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:47,394
- He needs to be wired.
- Yeah, we gotta get him in first.

348
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,145
Then we wire him?

349
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,437
We got a plan for that.

350
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,587
McGee, go.

351
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:56,233
These are aerial photos of Szwed's
distribution hub in Manassas.

352
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,041
That's the loading dock,

353
00:19:58,343 --> 00:20:01,283
access road
which leads to Route 409.

354
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,661
Now, this is Gerald Lucas,
Aaron Szwed.

355
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,333
I pulled PrePass tracking numbers
on all of their rigs.

356
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,968
- Somehow I doubt that'll help.
- Well, maybe we'll get lucky.

357
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,254
The less we leave to luck, the better
with a civilian on the inside.

358
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:18,049
Putting a lot of faith in you, son.

359
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:20,213
Observe only.

360
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:22,441
Understood.

361
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,376
One of ours goes with you
as your partner.

362
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,268
Find out what's in the truck
and take it to the other end.

363
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,728
We'll be following,
then we'll bust both sides.

364
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,613
- Two ways to follow.
- Rule number 27.

365
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,716
- First way, they never notice you.
- Second way, they only notice you.

366
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,372
One team inside, two teams trailing.

367
00:20:42,022 --> 00:20:43,176
Fornell's with me.

368
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:45,941
Then where are we?

369
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:53,851
They're on their way in, Boss.

370
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:04,387
You made it.

371
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,945
My partner.

372
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,687
What, no comment
about me being a woman?

373
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:11,058
You're kidding.

374
00:21:11,696 --> 00:21:14,439
Like if I had a choice I'd hang around
with more dudes, huh?

375
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,355
And it'll make patting you down
more enjoyable.

376
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:19,200
Try not to enjoy it too much.

377
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,172
Good luck with that.

378
00:21:27,191 --> 00:21:28,485
All right.

379
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:31,331
Got the telescopic mic up.
Check it out.

380
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:34,111
- Pretty cool.
- Nothing yet.

381
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,801
A lot of big heavy walls in there.
I gave them the blueprints.

382
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:38,171
They'll find a sweet spot.

383
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,257
That's a lot of Joe you got.

384
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:43,938
Double-fisting it, huh?

385
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:48,936
I'd be careful
with that much caffeine...

386
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:52,461
That is sugar.

387
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:55,212
That's a lot of sugar.

388
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:04,531
There we go.

389
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:11,328
What's pretty boy
mumbling about now?

390
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:14,000
Can you hold a grudge.

391
00:22:14,283 --> 00:22:17,227
- He broke my nose.
- He dislocated my shoulder, okay?

392
00:22:17,345 --> 00:22:18,603
You have another shoulder.

393
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:20,565
I only have one nose
and it's on my face.

394
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:23,060
- I mean, it's on my face, McGee!
- Look, it was two years ago.

395
00:22:23,144 --> 00:22:24,294
Just drop it.

396
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:27,722
That would be fine,

397
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:29,902
but he keeps coming back.

398
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:33,648
Gibbs should tell him to just...
be on his way.

399
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,820
Go live his own life.

400
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:39,199
Actually, Ducky thinks
that Gibbs feels a connection to Werth

401
00:22:39,283 --> 00:22:40,437
since we saved him.

402
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:44,050
Two schools of thought
on the lifesaving/responsibility issue:

403
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:45,530
you got <i>Robin Hood:</i>

404
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,583
<i>Prince of Thieves</i> versus
<i>The World's Greatest Athlete</i>.

405
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,917
I saw that one.

406
00:22:50,397 --> 00:22:52,452
The blonde white guy
with the African tribe.

407
00:22:52,536 --> 00:22:54,317
It's the young Jan-Michael Vincent.

408
00:22:55,094 --> 00:22:56,438
Loved him on <i>Airwolf</i>.

409
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,491
Stringfellow Hawke...

410
00:22:58,873 --> 00:23:00,919
that may be
the best character name ever.

411
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:04,433
The tribe believed that the lifesaver
had to take care of the savee.

412
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:08,432
Versus <i>Prince of Thieves</i> where Costner
saved Morgan Freeman's life, so

413
00:23:08,815 --> 00:23:10,953
Azeem follows Robin Hood all around

414
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:13,266
trying to save his life
to relieve the debt.

415
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:15,913
Well, Werth served his country.

416
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:19,132
I don't know what it is exactly
we owe him, but we do owe him something.

417
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,066
Do me a favor.

418
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:22,817
Pace yourself with that stuff.

419
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:31,242
What is that sound?

420
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:35,287
- You came prepared.
- Yeah, I was a Boy Scout.

421
00:23:36,063 --> 00:23:38,666
- Not what I heard.
- What are you looking for anyway?

422
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:40,798
Privacy.

423
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,840
I'm holding on to your cell phone.
You can have 'em back after we're done.

424
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:47,467
You know how to handle a CB?

425
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:51,438
Collect your gear.

426
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,227
- I'm sure you got a lot of questions.
- Just one.

427
00:23:57,633 --> 00:23:58,453
Shoot.

428
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:00,855
Where's the truck?

429
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,207
You hire a cleaning lady
or something?

430
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,101
Nope.

431
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:11,156
Looks different in here.

432
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:18,123
You want a hand?

433
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:23,557
<i>Yeah. Gibbs.</i>

434
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:25,836
Hey, Boss.
We got a truck pulling in.

435
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,966
Looks like
it might be getting close to kickoff.

436
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,218
- What's your 20?
- Switching cars. We'll be on the road.

437
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:34,040
This really is a big deal for you,
isn't it, letting me drive your car?

438
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:36,463
Yeah, whatever.
You already slept with my wife.

439
00:24:52,843 --> 00:24:54,784
Hey, swap the plates,
strip the markings.

440
00:24:55,838 --> 00:24:57,314
Your partner's nice to look at.

441
00:24:57,398 --> 00:24:59,375
- She double-clutch?
- Hey, I navigate.

442
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:01,707
And men are terrible
with maps anyway, right?

443
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:02,884
Where are we going?

444
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,162
- Not far.
- And what are we taking?

445
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,472
What's in the truck?

446
00:25:18,698 --> 00:25:20,103
What's in the truck?

447
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:23,848
What's in the truck?

448
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:28,997
Melons?

449
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:30,885
Did she say "melons"?

450
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:33,071
Melons in the truck.

451
00:25:33,343 --> 00:25:34,461
Melons...

452
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:37,118
What are in these melons?

453
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,438
We're moving melons?

454
00:25:42,396 --> 00:25:45,210
You're moving them out of the truck.
Now.

455
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:46,425
Empty it.

456
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:48,504
We are driving
a truck full of nothing?

457
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:50,591
Not for long.

458
00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:57,222
I don't think this is
a trafficking job at all.

459
00:25:57,537 --> 00:26:00,227
- It's a hijacking.
- And we are the hijackers.

460
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:20,496
All right,
she's a triple-digit ride.

461
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,963
Big ol'pumpkins in there,
but don't get tempted.

462
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:25,623
If we gotta get on the big slab,
you stay to the granny lane and

463
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:28,336
you keep it under the double nickel
even while you're running deadhead.

464
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,044
Bird-dog on the dash, so you don't get
shot in the back by bears.

465
00:26:31,128 --> 00:26:32,464
- You got it?
- 10-4.

466
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,551
- All right, let's roll.
- Hey, we got to pit stop.

467
00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:38,890
Three-quarters of a tank.
I don't like to take chances.

468
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:42,074
GPS tracking puts 'em
in Front Royal in a few hours.

469
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,500
Let's make it quick.

470
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:48,701
What language was that?

471
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,985
He says she's fast, but not to push her
even when we're driving empty,

472
00:26:52,521 --> 00:26:54,793
and to watch out for cops.

473
00:26:55,385 --> 00:26:56,664
So the truck is a she?

474
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,272
Let's go rob someone.

475
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:05,164
That's them.

476
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:08,584
Ferrari.

477
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:11,170
I had a hamster named Ferrari.

478
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:14,632
And here's the truck.

479
00:27:14,828 --> 00:27:17,379
The markings are stripped,
new plates.

480
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:20,536
That explains
why Szwed's not driving the truck.

481
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:24,781
Let's look for the sign.

482
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,675
Looks like our guy's having
a little bit of trouble.

483
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,762
How hard is it to drive
one of those things?

484
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:33,035
I know cars, not trucks.

485
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,237
Well, it's a six-speed.

486
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,594
Plus, the half step

487
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:41,010
makes it a 12. You gotta clutch
to get in, clutch to get out.

488
00:27:41,624 --> 00:27:43,433
Can't keep his foot off the brake.

489
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,523
Hey, will you stop tapping
your fingers?!

490
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:48,517
I'm not just tapping my fingers,
I'm watching his taillights,

491
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:49,751
it's Morse code.

492
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:50,835
F, U...!

493
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,908
E... L.

494
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,198
"Fuel."
Tony, they're stopping for fuel.

495
00:27:57,282 --> 00:27:59,052
Yeah, you're done with the coffee.

496
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:03,055
It's empty anyway.

497
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,433
Can we stop at the gas station, too?
I need a refill.

498
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,588
Well, we're the invisible tail car,
not the visible one.

499
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,438
Your teeth are chattering.

500
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:16,194
<i>Near a service station on 409.</i>

501
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,407
<i>Possible rendezvous spot.
Where are you at?</i>

502
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:19,675
We just passed it.

503
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:43,249
Slow down.

504
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:47,266
It was a mistake
to let you drive this car.

505
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,192
Don't get your underpants
in a twist. I know what I'm doing.

506
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:53,810
- Don't you believe me?
- No! No, I don't.

507
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:56,442
I don't believe any of it!
You drive like a maniac!

508
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,906
My impression of you!

509
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,029
Use the 91, moron.

510
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:01,948
Nice car.

511
00:29:02,046 --> 00:29:04,412
- How are you guys doing?
- I'm doing. Nice ride.

512
00:29:04,737 --> 00:29:06,267
If you go for the Mopar.

513
00:29:08,477 --> 00:29:10,013
I'm getting a Slim Jim!

514
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:12,707
- I don't want a Slim Jim!
- I wasn't askin' ya!

515
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:16,796
Ma'am.

516
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:19,197
Cash for the diesel.

517
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:22,510
- What you got in there?
- Under the hood?

518
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:25,138
- Bring me the change.
- Pushing 500 horse.

519
00:29:25,743 --> 00:29:27,360
Got about a hundred grand in her.

520
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:28,933
'72?

521
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:30,210
'71.

522
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:32,286
Got a 426 Hemi.

523
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:35,148
- She'll eat you up.
- Real power is torque.

524
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,819
I thought it was against the rules
to have your girl ride along.

525
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:42,864
No markings on the truck.

526
00:29:43,088 --> 00:29:44,574
What are you, gypsy or something?

527
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,909
Step away from the truck.

528
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:50,037
Please?

529
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,845
My mistake.
You win.

530
00:30:09,905 --> 00:30:10,955
Let's roll.

531
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:19,150
Well, Werth was very convincing.

532
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,654
What exactly are the skeletons
you didn't want to tell me about?

533
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:28,230
Small about
of steroid-induced psychosis.

534
00:30:29,108 --> 00:30:30,161
Oh, great.

535
00:30:44,172 --> 00:30:45,468
Can you hear me, McGee?

536
00:30:45,658 --> 00:30:48,459
Roger that.
10-2, you are loud and proud. Come back.

537
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,473
- Are you okay, McGee?
- <i>Yeah, I'm good.</i>

538
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,767
Tony's driving,
I've been studying up on the lingo.

539
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,074
- How are you?
- <i>We are... </i>

540
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:57,992
fine.

541
00:30:58,076 --> 00:30:59,481
<i>So where's the drop stop?</i>

542
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,983
- Where are you taking the cargo?
- <i>The truck is empty now.</i>

543
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,170
We believe they have a heist planned
and the target is in transit.

544
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:07,323
Destination: Front Royal.

545
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:08,991
Estimated time of arrival:

546
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,137
10:00 p.m.

547
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:12,248
<i>Assuming it's something big
and on the</i> road,

548
00:31:12,332 --> 00:31:13,717
it's gotta be a cargo vehicle.

549
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:16,442
I'm gonna check the national registry,
compile<i> bills of lading,</i>

550
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:17,917
check the weigh stations.

551
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:19,424
See, we've got...

552
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:22,060
government agencies
that keep track of that stuff.

553
00:31:22,144 --> 00:31:25,425
Hey, did you know the brotherhood
of truckers is the lifeblood<i> of America?</i>

554
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,884
<i>It's true. Over.</i>

555
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:28,886
Well, I'm glad that is over.

556
00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:31,389
Ziva, you there?

557
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:42,383
Relax.

558
00:31:47,062 --> 00:31:49,519
Heatherton drove
the lead Hummer in our convoy

559
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:51,534
when we were hit.

560
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:56,205
My friends who know
about these things

561
00:31:57,827 --> 00:31:59,250
tell me it is a science.

562
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:01,335
Trauma intensifies memory,

563
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,504
which can make it feel ever present.

564
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:06,132
There a reason for that?

565
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,740
Perhaps to teach you,

566
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:12,300
so you do not allow it
to happen again.

567
00:32:12,845 --> 00:32:14,640
I keep getting stuck
in my own history.

568
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:20,813
Look, the last time we saw each other,
you were in control.

569
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,269
You helped us.

570
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:25,800
Even after everything
you have gone through, you can...

571
00:32:26,032 --> 00:32:27,695
move forward.

572
00:32:30,076 --> 00:32:32,139
You can find the right path, Damon.

573
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,666
- Slow down. Slow down!
- What?!

574
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,219
- Not you. McGee.
- Right.

575
00:32:43,303 --> 00:32:44,598
<i>Sorry about that, Boss.</i>

576
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:48,674
He got an I.D.
on the shipment they're gonna hijack?

577
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:51,034
I got an address in Alexandria.

578
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:54,012
Garage owned by a David Devoisier.

579
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:57,240
Truck cleared a weigh station
in Roanoke, 40 minutes ago.

580
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,513
Bill of lading?

581
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,101
Assorted machinery.

582
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:01,959
Put the pedal to the metal, Tobias.

583
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:05,403
Still won't make it before dark.

584
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:09,195
I was expecting a delivery,
not federal agents.

585
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:12,650
You receive a lot of specialty machine
parts in the middle of the night?

586
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:14,893
When a project gets my attention,

587
00:33:14,977 --> 00:33:17,662
it gets all my attention,
no matter what time it is.

588
00:33:19,102 --> 00:33:21,825
So why does this particular
shipment raise the red flag?

589
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:24,669
We believe there's an attempt
about to be made to hijack it.

590
00:33:25,091 --> 00:33:26,639
An attempt by whom?

591
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:28,464
That's part
of an ongoing investigation.

592
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:29,871
We can't reveal that.

593
00:33:29,955 --> 00:33:32,008
The truck originated in San Diego.

594
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:35,763
Then it's Aaron Szwed.

595
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,192
You can bleach a blue color,
but that doesn't make it white.

596
00:33:40,276 --> 00:33:41,894
What makes you think of him?

597
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:44,539
He has a vested interest
in stealing what's in that truck.

598
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:45,485
Why?

599
00:33:45,995 --> 00:33:47,775
Because it is his.

600
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:50,719
A true gentleman...
which clearly he is not...

601
00:33:50,803 --> 00:33:52,146
honors a wager.

602
00:33:52,486 --> 00:33:55,032
- What kind of wager?
- Well, the kind that I won.

603
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:57,827
And that he lost.

604
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,448
This is all about a bet?

605
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:21,016
Do come in.

606
00:34:22,713 --> 00:34:24,244
Szwed was in over his head.

607
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,480
He was throwing away money
he couldn't afford to lose.

608
00:34:28,055 --> 00:34:31,215
He wanted to prove
that he could run with the faster crowd.

609
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:33,068
- Want a drink?
- No.

610
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,333
What exactly was on the table?

611
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,887
His best car...

612
00:34:37,306 --> 00:34:38,558
versus mine.

613
00:34:39,323 --> 00:34:40,286
A race?

614
00:34:41,657 --> 00:34:43,706
- Cross-country.
- Winner takes pink slips.

615
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:45,590
Precisely.

616
00:34:46,512 --> 00:34:48,502
Yes, I know it's dangerous.

617
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,805
You'll have to forgive an idle man
his reckless indulgence.

618
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,718
Sure... speed limits,
they're really just suggestions.

619
00:34:56,944 --> 00:34:59,171
I've already cleared the space out
for my trophy,

620
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:01,556
- it's on my truck now.
- Just the two of you?

621
00:35:02,051 --> 00:35:04,560
Support teams trailing
in case of emergency.

622
00:35:05,464 --> 00:35:08,468
- Spare tires, what have you.
- That would be Heatherton.

623
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:12,484
I heard Szwed cursing that name
at the finish line in San Diego.

624
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:15,262
He was furious that he was nowhere
to be found when he...

625
00:35:15,587 --> 00:35:17,573
overheated outside Barstow.

626
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:21,051
- Red-lining through the desert.
- Heatherton cost him the race.

627
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:24,038
- So he claimed.
- He's dead, you know.

628
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,359
Pardon?

629
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:27,541
Who's dead?

630
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,627
Heatherton... he was murdered.

631
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:32,129
I hadn't heard.

632
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,256
That's terrible.

633
00:35:34,698 --> 00:35:36,462
That does give Szwed a motive.

634
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,220
Can you get ahold of your driver?

635
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:40,321
Sure.

636
00:35:41,436 --> 00:35:43,389
Why? Do you want to stop my truck?

637
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,356
All of his movements, McGee.

638
00:35:52,357 --> 00:35:54,292
I've got Devoisier
on a commercial flight,

639
00:35:54,376 --> 00:35:56,773
San Diego to Dulles.
It was a week ago.

640
00:35:57,283 --> 00:36:00,282
I'm also seeing his speeding tickets.
Seems to be a lot of those going around.

641
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:03,996
Szwed had two... Amarillo, Texas,
and Tucumcari, New Mexico.

642
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:05,996
Get your kicks on Route 66.

643
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,191
Actually shows up here
as Interstate 40.

644
00:36:08,275 --> 00:36:10,868
Look for any unsolved incident
reports off that route.

645
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:13,587
- <i>Absolutely, Boss.</i>
- Worried we're missing a fender bender?

646
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,793
- McGee, gonna lose you.
<i>- Yeah, Boss, I was just about...</i>

647
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,671
Wait, Boss, Boss...

648
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:25,492
Get this...
their cars are in the back of the truck.

649
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:28,028
What kind of cars are
worth killing for?

650
00:36:28,112 --> 00:36:29,347
I can think of a few.

651
00:36:30,176 --> 00:36:32,518
Szwed was driving a Maybach.

652
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:34,207
Are you kidding me?

653
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,974
It's worth like
a quarter of a million.

654
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,863
And Devoisier... a 1970 Plymouth

655
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,573
Barracuda convertible.

656
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,402
Barracuda.

657
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:44,132
Gibbs would like that.

658
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:45,069
Hemi?

659
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:52,918
Pull over here. The truck's going
to be coming down the road on your left.

660
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,317
Use the trailer to block the road.

661
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:00,803
<i>Wait for my signal.</i>

662
00:37:02,994 --> 00:37:04,983
Copy. Good plan.

663
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:11,896
- McGee, what's our plan?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

664
00:37:12,278 --> 00:37:14,331
I lost connection with Gibbs.
He went dark.

665
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,423
Hang on, McGee!

666
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,408
Nuts!

667
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,419
That's him.

668
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:37,880
Werth, pull out.

669
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:39,910
Pull out now!
<i>Block the road.</i>

670
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:40,925
What do we do?

671
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:42,509
We stop the truck.

672
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:44,970
It's too late to go back now anyway.

673
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:53,774
What the...?

674
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,656
Come on, get out of there.

675
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,930
And you people think I'm crazy.

676
00:38:30,983 --> 00:38:32,309
Put a gun on the driver!

677
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:37,642
Please do not resist.

678
00:38:37,726 --> 00:38:39,315
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

679
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:40,983
Come on, come on, open up!

680
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:45,197
Do I even have to tell you?

681
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,865
You're under arrest.

682
00:38:56,757 --> 00:38:57,696
Thank you.

683
00:38:58,033 --> 00:38:59,911
Thank you for returning them.

684
00:39:00,996 --> 00:39:02,427
Boys and their cars.

685
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:04,979
I'm a hot-rod girl myself.

686
00:39:06,237 --> 00:39:07,391
So...

687
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,556
how much does
something like this go for, anyway?

688
00:39:11,102 --> 00:39:13,350
I paid $1.2 million.

689
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:15,686
What?!
Are you...

690
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,187
stupid?

691
00:39:19,914 --> 00:39:21,233
Stock Hemi...

692
00:39:21,782 --> 00:39:23,707
'Cuda convertible.

693
00:39:24,518 --> 00:39:26,037
From 1970.

694
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:28,573
Only 18 made, Abs.

695
00:39:30,466 --> 00:39:32,553
An actual Hemi 'Cuda.

696
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:34,329
That's like...

697
00:39:34,628 --> 00:39:37,123
the holy Grail of muscle cars, huh?

698
00:39:37,248 --> 00:39:38,654
Perfectly restored.

699
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,683
- Not perfect.
- How do you mean?

700
00:39:42,054 --> 00:39:44,673
Always take a magnet
when you look at used cars.

701
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:49,055
The magnet sticks to metal.

702
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:51,847
It does not stick...

703
00:39:55,281 --> 00:39:56,371
to Bondo.

704
00:39:57,947 --> 00:40:00,397
Quick repair job.
You have a little accident?

705
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:03,873
We already got Szwed and Lucas
for the attempted hijacking,

706
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:06,361
but they swear
that they didn't kill anybody.

707
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,488
And we believe 'em.

708
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,907
So, we went looking
for another motive.

709
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,366
Followed your path out West

710
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,971
to a report of a hit-and-run
in Weatherford, Oklahoma.

711
00:40:16,812 --> 00:40:18,986
18-year-old girl
crossing the street.

712
00:40:19,368 --> 00:40:21,530
We sent Heatherton's picture
to the hospital.

713
00:40:21,614 --> 00:40:22,669
He brought her in,

714
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,232
and he stayed with her
until she died.

715
00:40:25,316 --> 00:40:26,999
You'd stop at nothing to win.

716
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:29,218
Including red lights.

717
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:31,958
But you could not destroy
this machine.

718
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,431
So you killed Nick Heatherton...
the only witness.

719
00:40:36,162 --> 00:40:37,810
You want to bet I find traces of...

720
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,020
blood and hair...

721
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,981
when I start taking
this whole thing apart

722
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,584
piece by piece?

723
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:03,303
I'm not looking forward
to this next conversation.

724
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:04,950
It is better to do it in person.

725
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,155
Tell Heatherton's wife
that her husband...

726
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,844
died for being a Good Samaritan.
That he was... a good man.

727
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:15,472
And that Devoisier is not.

728
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:18,392
See you later.

729
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:20,698
See you later.

730
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:24,148
Heatherton's wife lives
in Cleveland, huh?

731
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,984
I went to school in Columbus.
I've got some friends.

732
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,027
Could make some calls
if you're looking for work.

733
00:41:29,428 --> 00:41:30,487
I'd appreciate it.

734
00:41:31,352 --> 00:41:32,447
Need a lift?

735
00:41:33,063 --> 00:41:33,907
I'll walk.

736
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:47,880
So was that, like,

737
00:41:48,164 --> 00:41:50,299
"see you later", like good-bye, or

738
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:52,164
"see you later", like,

739
00:41:53,757 --> 00:41:55,804
"I'm gonna see you at a later date"?

740
00:41:57,653 --> 00:42:01,120
Are you having trouble
understanding simple English?

741
00:42:01,848 --> 00:42:03,332
Just answer the question.
