00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:23,648
You're under arrest!
You bad, bad boy.

7
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:05,971
Morning, Agent Filmore.

8
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:08,986
Ten-hut.
Like the army greens.

9
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:11,029
We do investigate crimes
of the Navy here, though.

10
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,282
Nice smile. Good thing I have a strong
ego, or I'd think you didn't like me.

11
00:01:18,198 --> 00:01:20,163
- What?
- Ziva, did she call?

12
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:22,080
You haven't spoken
to her either, huh?

13
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,111
Tried talking to her
on the plane, but...

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,612
I don't know.
Things got...

15
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:31,466
These details are classified.
Thank you.

16
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,385
- They're not.
- They should be.

17
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,703
What's going on around here? I'd to sign
an autograph going through security.

18
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,391
I know what you mean.
You know Janice in psych services?

19
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,809
Man hands?
Great eyes.

20
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,020
Yeah. She asked me out
for drinks tomorrow night.

21
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,987
That's not bad for a guy who spent half
the last mission sleeping on the floor.

22
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:49,317
- I wasn't sleeping on the floor.
- Could have fooled me.

23
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:51,041
She'll call when she's ready.

24
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:53,904
Last time I said that, I ended up
tied to a chair in North Africa.

25
00:01:54,326 --> 00:01:57,242
She's coming back, right?
She's coming back.

26
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,602
Course I don't know
where she's gonna sit.

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,791
20 bucks says that desk gonna be empty
by the end of next month.

28
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,627
Hate to disappoint you.
My letter of resignation.

29
00:02:09,432 --> 00:02:11,085
Well, that's... very long.

30
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:13,132
I had a hard time choosing
the right adjectives.

31
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,884
I couldn't decide between childish,

32
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:17,762
juvenile,
and just plain old annoying.

33
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:20,640
- It's true.
- And you...

34
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,851
you know better, but you're so busy
playing the faithful sidekick,

35
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,393
you just go along for the ride.

36
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,479
I've had enough.

37
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,023
Make sure
that Agent Gibbs gets that.

38
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,026
Annoying.

39
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:33,444
Sidekick?

40
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:37,573
Hello, Gibbs.

41
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:39,070
Your door was open.

42
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:41,035
Usually is.

43
00:02:43,252 --> 00:02:45,113
I apologize for being late.

44
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:47,742
The Navy lodge I was staying at
ran a surprise drill this morning,

45
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:48,711
so I just...

46
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:51,819
It's not important.

47
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:56,801
How are you?

48
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:01,347
I am fine... Gibbs.

49
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:05,017
That is what I wished to speak
to you about, among...

50
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:07,576
other things. First of all, I...

51
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,854
wanted to say...

52
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:13,234
thank you.

53
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:17,083
Which... hardly seems sufficient.

54
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:20,658
Considering so, I...
It's called...

55
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:22,535
It's an old buck mortise chisel.

56
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:25,496
That is not for rescuing me.
That is for leaving me in Israel.

57
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,040
You're probably wondering,

58
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,459
perhaps I rigged it to explode...

59
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:31,718
No.

60
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:34,589
I was thinking
this is a really nice chisel.

61
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:39,093
When...

62
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:42,638
you left me in Israel, I...

63
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:45,515
I felt betrayed.

64
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:51,393
But I...

65
00:03:52,454 --> 00:03:54,191
I had a long time
to think about things.

66
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,444
Very, very, very...

67
00:03:56,756 --> 00:03:57,737
long time.

68
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:04,035
And you were right
to leave me there.

69
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:05,328
I know.

70
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,705
Well, the point is, now I do, too.

71
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:11,972
I had forgotten...

72
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,711
who I could trust.

73
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:15,838
We were a team,

74
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:17,715
and I would like that again.

75
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:23,554
You need to talk to the Director.

76
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:25,223
It is your blessing I came for.

77
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:35,547
Yeah. DiNozzo.
What have you got?

78
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,674
Where?

79
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:39,460
Meet you there.

80
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:43,157
Triple homicide.

81
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,659
You need to talk to Leon Vance.

82
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,454
I already told him to expect you.

83
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,882
And he's not the only one
you need to talk to.

84
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,432
Hey, you missed a shot there,
Sidekick.

85
00:05:08,657 --> 00:05:11,752
- I'm not your sidekick, Tony.
- And yet, you are.

86
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,708
No, I am not because
you're not the Boss.

87
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:16,571
When Gibbs isn't here, I'm the Boss.

88
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,147
Gibbs is here.

89
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,214
Hey, Boss.

90
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:21,445
Marine Staff Sergeant Jeff Ross.

91
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:24,892
He's the one who booked the room. Said
it was for a buddy's bachelor party.

92
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:27,261
Local Leos identified him.
Then they called us.

93
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:29,954
- Haven't identified the other two yet.
- Still waiting on the duck man.

94
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:32,415
Who found him?

95
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,872
That would be the stripper.

96
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:35,626
She's in the next room
with her manager.

97
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:41,757
Where is Filmore?

98
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:51,759
Finally.
I've been here since 3:00 a.m.

99
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:54,228
You have someplace else
you have to be?

100
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,730
Not me, but her.

101
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:57,523
Scorpio's my best dancer.

102
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:59,191
I got here as soon as I heard.

103
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:01,257
Hector Stuckey.

104
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,862
I'm in show biz.

105
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,383
Okay.

106
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:14,418
Let me hear it.
Start at the beginning. Take your time.

107
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:16,584
Hector gave me the address.

108
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:20,923
- These guys regular customers?
- No. First-timers.

109
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:23,174
I do a lot of business here.
I got a deal with the hotel.

110
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:24,467
Look.

111
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,971
My own Cologne.
It's got my number.

112
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,056
Keep it.

113
00:06:30,465 --> 00:06:31,962
Yeah, it's okay.
I'm gonna pass.

114
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:35,656
I met with him in the lobby
in the afternoon.

115
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:39,622
He said he wanted
to surprise his friends, so...

116
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:41,609
so he gave me a key.

117
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:47,573
I came in through that door
and spotted them the way they are now,

118
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:48,672
except...

119
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:53,829
Except what?

120
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:59,126
I'm pretty sure he had hair
when I first met him.

121
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,207
Take it off.

122
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:17,523
Even the sharpest of razors,
on a shave this close...

123
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,224
would cause
pseudofolliculitis barbae,

124
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:23,107
- A.K.A...
- Razor burn.

125
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:28,114
However, note the complete lack
of dermabrasive disruption.

126
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,967
Whoever did this...

127
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,327
did so after they were dead.

128
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:44,390
Bachelor #1 is
Marine Staff Sergeant Jeff Ross,

129
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,258
a mechanic on leave
from Camp Muchuk in South Korea.

130
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,219
Second victim:
Eric Jurel, a civilian.

131
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,120
Runs an auctioneering school in DC.

132
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,306
Guest of honor:

133
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,017
Alan Sandich, a low-level file clerk

134
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,150
at the pentagon.

135
00:07:58,653 --> 00:07:59,936
Talk to the fiancée?

136
00:08:01,043 --> 00:08:03,524
She's out of town, but we are working
on getting a hold of her now.

137
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:08,612
No criminal records across the board,
unless you count

138
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:11,525
egging a church freshman year
of high school.

139
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:13,409
These guys have known
each other for a while.

140
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,312
Why would you egg a church?

141
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:16,452
Find out.

142
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,831
You got it, Boss.

143
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:22,410
Tony, let's go.
Follow me.

144
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:24,503
Nah. Nah. Nah. You follow me.

145
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:27,745
Don't fight your inner sidekick, McGee.
It's unbecoming.

146
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,519
I could say the same thing to you.

147
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:31,104
No, you can't because...

148
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:34,387
everyone knows
that sidekicks are shorter, and you...

149
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,016
Are exactly the same height as you.

150
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,189
Look, you're not gonna make me say it,
are you?

151
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:45,774
You think you're too good-looking
to be the sidekick?

152
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,236
No. People think I'm too good-looking.
Specifically the women people.

153
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:51,672
Actually,
I find McGee to be the more handsome.

154
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,099
Nothing personal.

155
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:56,209
Hi.

156
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,370
Hello.

157
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,539
So, what are you doing here?

158
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:03,375
David... with me.

159
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,625
- That answers that question.
- I have to go.

160
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,101
Agent Gibbs already briefed me.
You want back.

161
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:13,165
Is that right?

162
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:15,497
That is correct.

163
00:09:15,557 --> 00:09:17,438
Have you discussed this
with your father?

164
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,136
I am not sure
how his opinion is relevant.

165
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:24,665
We rescued you.

166
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:26,774
Not Mossad, not your father.

167
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:29,227
I think it would be very relevant.

168
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:31,589
Have I not been
a valuable asset to NCIS?

169
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:32,696
Without question.

170
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,532
- Then what is the problem?
- David, you were never an Agent.

171
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,118
You were the Mossad Liaison Officer,

172
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:41,622
which, by definition, requires you
to have a relationship with Mossad.

173
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:45,345
Have you even spoken to your father?

174
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:47,605
No.

175
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:51,006
You're damaged goods.

176
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:52,907
How damaged...

177
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,303
I need to know before I can even begin
to figure out what to do with you.

178
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,225
You pass a psych evaluation battery,
and we'll talk.

179
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:05,582
- Thank you.
- David?

180
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:08,228
No promises.

181
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:13,908
The auction chant...

182
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:16,534
to most of the public,
it's gibberish.

183
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:18,951
But it's actually carefully
crafted to avoid

184
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,152
giving people time to think.

185
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:25,374
Thoughtful people spend less,

186
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:28,328
and spending is the name
of the proverbial game.

187
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:30,963
- Any questions?
- Yeah. I have some.

188
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:32,958
I have a question, as well.

189
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:37,203
Break down
into teams of two and practice.

190
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:41,599
Is this about Eric Jurel?

191
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:44,707
I already heard.
Good news travels fast.

192
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:45,936
Good news?

193
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:47,438
He's dead, isn't he?

194
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:49,411
Did you wake up
this morning wanting to be

195
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,449
the prime suspect
in a murder investigation?

196
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:54,389
If wishing Eric Jurel dead
makes me a suspect,

197
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,181
then so is every employee
of this auction school.

198
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,409
Eric took pleasure
in making others miserable.

199
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,762
No one is shedding
any tears for that man.

200
00:11:05,202 --> 00:11:06,596
You sure about that?

201
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:10,919
That's Elena,
our miscellaneous items broker.

202
00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:12,983
She could sell sand to a Bedouin

203
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:15,461
and then bore him
to death about her latest crush.

204
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:18,530
- Pay her no heed.
- It's our job to heed.

205
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,255
You agreed to the purchase price.

206
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,766
Fine, if you don't want it,
I know 20 people who will,

207
00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:25,821
and a lawyer
who will have your head.

208
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:29,762
Can I help you?

209
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:31,208
Yes...

210
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:36,149
we'd like to ask you a few questions
about your boss. You're Elena, right?

211
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:39,732
- I assume you've heard the news?
- Yes...

212
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:42,373
It's terrible.

213
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:45,358
Were you two...

214
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:49,234
No. I mean,

215
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:51,627
I was...

216
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:54,429
He wasn't...

217
00:11:56,668 --> 00:11:57,799
No, we weren't.

218
00:11:58,554 --> 00:12:01,220
You know, it's not that there wasn't
a spark. It's just that he...

219
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:06,308
Any reason that you can think of
why someone would want him dead?

220
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:09,443
Well, a lot of people...

221
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:10,938
misunderstood him.

222
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:14,316
But Eric was a good man, deep down.

223
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:17,531
I can't see anyone
wanting to hurt him.

224
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:19,217
But...

225
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,447
But what?

226
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:23,273
I...

227
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:26,370
overheard him...

228
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:28,621
on the phone in the office.

229
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,366
That he said he thought
someone was following him.

230
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:36,554
I have never been
to a bachelor party.

231
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:38,688
Really?
How sad.

232
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:40,298
Well, I've been invited.

233
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:43,525
It's just, one time I was sick
and then another time I had a...

234
00:12:43,902 --> 00:12:44,990
broken leg.

235
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,806
I could tell you stories
that would make your hair curl.

236
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,201
- Well, go on.
- No.

237
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:51,056
It's better he doesn't, Duck.

238
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:53,037
Can't I tell him
about the time when...

239
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:55,302
Better I don't.

240
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:59,027
I called you down here
because liver pathology suggested,

241
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:01,739
and Abby later confirmed,

242
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:04,462
that all three men were drugged
prior to their deaths.

243
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:07,327
The champagne.
And while semi-conscious,

244
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,663
one was drowned,

245
00:13:10,128 --> 00:13:11,602
one suffocated,

246
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:14,743
and Sergeant Ross here

247
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:16,962
died of a massive alcohol poisoning.

248
00:13:17,802 --> 00:13:20,174
Likely ingested under duress.

249
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:23,667
- Semi-conscious?
- Very astute, Jethro.

250
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:25,738
- The killer...
- Wanted them...

251
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,907
awake when they died.

252
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,196
Which implies a deeper meaning to
the ritualistic manner of their deaths.

253
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:34,558
Mr. Palmer here
discovered something.

254
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:37,441
I found an inconsistency
in Ross' military file.

255
00:13:37,743 --> 00:13:40,312
The record states
that he sustained an injury

256
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:43,254
during a work-related accident
on base in Korea,

257
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:45,991
but Dr. Mallard found evidence
of a gunshot wound.

258
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:49,525
Not something I'd expect to see

259
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,764
in a work-related injury.

260
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:54,249
Falsified the report.

261
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:56,168
A good assumption.

262
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,007
Hey, Boss...

263
00:14:20,268 --> 00:14:23,278
ATM and traffic cameras, we got a tip
that one of our victims...

264
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:25,463
was being followed.

265
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:27,520
Thought I'd check on some
of the routes he was on.

266
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,035
See if we could find out who the tail
was. The swiping thing was...

267
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,762
Need to talk to Sergeant Ross' CO
in South Korea.

268
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,707
- I'll set it up and...
- Where's DiNozzo?

269
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:37,042
On an interview.
Alan Sandich's fiancée is back in town.

270
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:40,428
And she's already reengaged.
Does it remind you of anyone, Boss?

271
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:43,233
How long are you gonna keep
making those jokes, DiNozzo?

272
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:46,203
I think that was actually the last time
I'm ever gonna make that joke.

273
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:47,147
Sorry.

274
00:14:47,498 --> 00:14:49,555
She's engaged already?
It's only been 24 hours.

275
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:51,988
Not exactly.

276
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:53,767
Check this out.

277
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,027
That's illegal in most states.
There's parts of Europe you can...

278
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,241
It's bad behavior.

279
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:10,617
- This is from Sandich's bachelor party.
- Turn it off.

280
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,147
Yeah, it's his real bachelor party.

281
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:17,916
Five months ago.

282
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,479
When Sandich's fiancée found the tape,
she called off the engagement.

283
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:23,510
- She hasn't seen him since.
- Which means...

284
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:25,913
They were all still single.

285
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:27,676
Second bachelor party
was just a cover.

286
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,810
Cover for what?

287
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,307
I've heard of a cover story
for a bachelor party,

288
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:41,722
but I've never heard of one
being the cover story.

289
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,441
What do you think
they were really up to?

290
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:45,888
The usual.

291
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:47,757
No good.

292
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:54,286
Any luck on who ever's following
Eric Jurel, our auction house owner?

293
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:56,788
No, and it was over a week ago.

294
00:15:57,077 --> 00:15:59,166
You could try to recreate
your victim's daily route

295
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,627
by using his cell's GPS history.

296
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:05,130
Then see if there are
any other cell phones consistently

297
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:07,424
in the same area.
If so...

298
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:08,967
We've got Jurel's tail.

299
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:12,319
I'm sorry.
I overheard you two talking.

300
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,182
No, thank you,
'cause that is extremely helpful.

301
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,893
We can pull the GPS history
and look at the logs.

302
00:16:22,884 --> 00:16:25,609
And I'm gonna go do
that after I get...

303
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:27,432
a nutter butter.

304
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:34,910
Taking the tour?

305
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:38,538
I have my first psych evaluation.

306
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,248
Oh yeah, I always love those.

307
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,054
I'm sure.

308
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,670
You get to talk about yourself
the entire time.

309
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:46,728
I'm sorry, I meant...

310
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,357
No, no, no, that's okay.

311
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:51,051
No one's ever accused you
of having tact.

312
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:54,262
Sorry.

313
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:59,267
Sorry, I gotta take this.
It's work.

314
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,819
Listen, I've got...

315
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:04,459
For you.

316
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:07,887
Hello.

317
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:09,889
<i>Ziva, you said
you were coming down to the lab.</i>

318
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:12,035
Yes, sorry, Abby.
I know I said I would.

319
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:12,845
<i>Now!</i>

320
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,599
All right, I will be right down.

321
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:20,284
Haven't had your private
Abby welcome yet, huh?

322
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:22,435
Careful,
she might give you a 21-gun salute.

323
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:24,973
I will...

324
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:28,026
see you later.

325
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,423
I will be right here.

326
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:40,046
Hello, Abby.

327
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,736
What the hell is wrong with you?

328
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:53,238
How could you have doubted Tony after
everything you've been through together?

329
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:56,783
You really think that Tony killed
Rivkin because he was jealous?

330
00:17:57,113 --> 00:17:58,182
Please calm...

331
00:17:58,242 --> 00:18:00,537
You weren't thinking.
That's right. You weren't thinking.

332
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:04,443
Although I suppose I could understand
your initial reaction.

333
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:07,789
You were in an emotional time for you,
and people act rashly.

334
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:10,380
But to tell Gibbs
that you didn't trust Tony?

335
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:13,592
Which I guess I also could understand,
you know. I mean, he did just...

336
00:18:14,456 --> 00:18:15,799
shoot your boyfriend.

337
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,375
In your living room.

338
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,432
To death.
All right, I'll give you that one.

339
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,266
But this is Tony
we're talking about here!

340
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:26,144
All, all soft and goofy on the outside
and 100% rock on the inside.

341
00:18:26,204 --> 00:18:30,154
And after everything you accused him of,
he risked his life to go save you!

342
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:32,277
You should be ashamed of yourself!

343
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:35,821
Even though in hindsight it is starting
to make a little bit more sense now.

344
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,326
But either way,
the ball is in your court.

345
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:41,166
It is Tony one and Ziva zilch.

346
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:42,913
This is your move.

347
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,706
And it better be a good one.

348
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:49,503
God, I was so worried about you.

349
00:18:52,301 --> 00:18:53,391
I know.

350
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:03,767
<i>Nice to speak to you in person,
Agent Gibbs.</i>

351
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:05,977
<i>I'm sure I'm not the first to say,
"Ooh Rah".</i>

352
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:08,480
<i>Quite a feat your team
pulled off in North Africa.</i>

353
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,233
<i>Love to hear the details.</i>

354
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,694
<i>Come on, gunny.</i>

355
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:16,739
<i>We don't get
a lot of action in South Korea.</i>

356
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,845
Sergeant Ross, you know him?

357
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:23,594
<i>He's a good man.
How can I help?</i>

358
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,081
Accident report you signed
said he hurt himself on base?

359
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:30,252
<i>He was a flight mechanic.
Got his arm caught in a hydraulic.</i>

360
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:31,393
Really?

361
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:34,839
My M.E. here says it was
a gunshot wound. He's pretty smart.

362
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:38,776
You care to revise your report?

363
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,195
<i>Guess I have to.</i>

364
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,933
<i>Starting with the fact Ross was actually
the biggest bastard I'd ever met.</i>

365
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:46,852
Why would you falsify a report?

366
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:49,271
<i>Was trying to avoid
an international incident.</i>

367
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:52,566
<i>Ross took two days of leave.
Said he was visiting his girl in Seoul.</i>

368
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:54,839
<i>When he came back, he'd been shot.</i>

369
00:19:55,405 --> 00:19:56,194
Husband?

370
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:57,823
<i>That's what he said.</i>

371
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,532
<i>I gave him a verbal reprimand
and buried it.</i>

372
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:02,986
<i>Geopolitics here are dicey.</i>

373
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:06,211
<i>Not gonna win hearts and minds
going after another man's tail.</i>

374
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,289
I'm gonna need a revised report.

375
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:10,709
I'll have it on your desk
at 0800 tomorrow.

376
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,211
I got something for you to sign.

377
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,546
Ziva's reinstatement.

378
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,716
She passed her first psych eval?

379
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,967
She didn't fail.
Let's put it that way.

380
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,721
Saleem's men put a world of hurt on her,
but I think she's viable.

381
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,311
What's Eli David think?

382
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,031
I got some details to work out.

383
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:30,547
Not gonna try...

384
00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:32,314
if you don't want her.

385
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:35,289
Or were you hoping
that I couldn't work out the details

386
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:37,569
so you wouldn't even have
to make that call?

387
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:39,396
I already told you, Leon.

388
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,111
We need Ziva.

389
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,337
Yeah,

390
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,578
I remember.

391
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:50,277
That should make it easy for you.

392
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,591
Sergeant Ross went MIA during
a two-day leave last month.

393
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:58,506
- Find out where he went.
- In South Korea?

394
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:01,841
Okay, I'll just make
some phone calls.

395
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:03,220
Order me some Berlitz CDs.

396
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:06,640
We've got a way to find out who was
tailing Jurel, the auction house guy.

397
00:21:07,337 --> 00:21:09,623
The red line was Jurel's daily drive
before he died.

398
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:11,978
We're looking for cell signals
that were shadowing him.

399
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:13,899
It was actually Ziva's idea.

400
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:17,915
We weren't discussing the case.
She just walked by.

401
00:21:20,054 --> 00:21:21,071
I got a hit.

402
00:21:22,463 --> 00:21:23,521
It's a cell phone.

403
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:25,840
It shows up close
to Jurel's car several times.

404
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,150
- You got a name?
- That is odd.

405
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:30,464
That cell doesn't have
a valid ESN number.

406
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,916
It's not registered with any carrier.
Could be black market.

407
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,249
It's a burn phone, Tim.

408
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:36,086
- Just say burn phone.
- Can you trace it?

409
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,004
I can do better,
I can take you right to it.

410
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,027
It's inside.

411
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:52,107
With me, McGee.

412
00:21:56,387 --> 00:21:57,487
In position.

413
00:21:57,904 --> 00:21:58,904
<i>On my mark.</i>

414
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:00,776
<i>Go.</i>

415
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:04,609
Baltimore police.
Got two suspects.

416
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,120
Got a call: shots fired.
Partner's got one suspect in the alley.

417
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:15,721
Shelley.

418
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,711
Guessing he's in charge now.

419
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,880
Good guess.

420
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:29,619
- Is Friendly still on the force?
- Retired last year.

421
00:22:30,965 --> 00:22:33,151
DiNozzo, wait, are you Tony DiNozzo?

422
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:35,813
- Only if I don't owe you money.
- You don't.

423
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,016
Just glad to have you
at my back, Sir.

424
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:45,271
Clear.

425
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,075
Clear.

426
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:50,635
Jurel's tail was here.
He's gone now.

427
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:54,622
Officer Shelley?

428
00:22:58,264 --> 00:22:59,358
It's locked.

429
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:13,683
There's nothing in back.
Alley was empty.

430
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,145
- Couldn't find the partner.
- That's because he was never here.

431
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,359
This is Shelley's house.

432
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,102
There are three men murdered
at a fake bachelor party.

433
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:34,223
What were they really doing there?

434
00:23:34,283 --> 00:23:35,288
No one knows.

435
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:37,874
This is definitely the cell
that was tailing Jurel.

436
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,052
If Shelley was working a case,
Baltimore PD doesn't know about it.

437
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:42,461
Still, no one knows.

438
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,335
What we do know is
that Shelley was tailing...

439
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:47,756
the victims.

440
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,470
- Found those under his bed.
- Not tailing...

441
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:51,429
targeting.

442
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:53,473
Spending a lot of time at airports.

443
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:55,934
There's nothing useful
on the cell itself, but the model...

444
00:23:56,307 --> 00:23:58,057
- retails for over a grand.
- Yeah.

445
00:23:58,388 --> 00:24:01,684
- That's not bad on a cop's salary.
- We found this on his computer.

446
00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:07,487
- Suicide note.
- Rambling.

447
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:10,073
Says, he's sorry, doesn't say why.

448
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,534
We interrupted the second half
of a murder-suicide?

449
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:14,928
Well, let's not hang around
and find out. DiNozzo.

450
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:18,081
I will contact my buddies
at the Baltimore PD, see

451
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,833
if they know
where Shelley was heading.

452
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,782
I'll look into his background,

453
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:23,920
if there's any connection
between him and the victims.

454
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:30,935
Thanks.

455
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,277
- You taking a break?
- I was on my way to the office,

456
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,363
came to get a coffee, saw you sitting
here, thought I'd come say hello.

457
00:24:52,303 --> 00:24:53,950
I was actually coming
to look for you.

458
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,120
I wanted to say...

459
00:24:59,033 --> 00:24:59,873
thank you.

460
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:06,651
Did you come to the Navy Yard
just to say thanks or...?

461
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:09,921
I am finishing my psych
evaluation with...

462
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:11,972
Dr. Bracco today.

463
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:15,096
Janice Bracco, with the...?

464
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,877
Man hands and...

465
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:18,638
the pretty eyes, yes.

466
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:20,268
Why?

467
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:22,613
Nothing, no.

468
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:26,398
So how's it going?

469
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,263
I will not deny
these past three months have been...

470
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:40,497
a challenge.

471
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,959
But that was all in the past,
and the past is the past.

472
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:47,787
Is it?

473
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:51,343
Yes.

474
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:57,472
So why are you avoiding Tony?

475
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:06,064
Hey, boss, when did you get back?

476
00:26:06,836 --> 00:26:07,857
Ten minutes ago.

477
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,068
- Just taking a...
- Coffee break?

478
00:26:11,377 --> 00:26:12,128
Yeah.

479
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:15,370
I found a connection between
officer Shelley and our dead guys.

480
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,784
- They went to the same high school.
- Yeah, how'd you know?

481
00:26:19,736 --> 00:26:20,956
There is more.

482
00:26:21,283 --> 00:26:23,915
The records say that our dead guys
had a history of bullying.

483
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:26,960
- Shelley was their favorite target.
- They brutalized him.

484
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:30,128
Gives us motive, assuming
that he held a grudge all these years.

485
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,040
If he didn't,
it recently got a refresh,

486
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,634
and I'm going to explain
that after I hit the head.

487
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:36,636
It can wait.

488
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:39,810
I spoke to a buddy
from homicide, and he said that...

489
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,627
Shelley pulled over Sergeant Ross

490
00:26:41,898 --> 00:26:43,882
about a month ago
and gave him a ticket...

491
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:46,722
and ended up giving him three tickets
once he realized it was his old...

492
00:26:47,225 --> 00:26:49,399
- high school tormentor.
- I bet that felt good.

493
00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:51,075
You would think that.

494
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:54,079
Fun didn't last long.
Why don't you check your e-mail?

495
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:57,740
Ross got payback.

496
00:26:58,022 --> 00:27:01,411
E-mailed an old high school video
of Shelley to everyone in his precinct.

497
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,247
<i>Turn that off!
Turn that off!</i>

498
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,483
Not the sort of thing
you want your buddies to see.

499
00:27:07,116 --> 00:27:09,043
<i>Fresh hair-cut
by your big boy buddy.</i>

500
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:10,301
<i>Yeah!</i>

501
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,217
<i>Smile for the camera, baby.</i>

502
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,730
<i>He looks like a monk.</i>

503
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,638
- I've seen that before.
- Yeah, at our murder scene.

504
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:23,641
Boss, I think Shelley was recreating
incidents from his past.

505
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:25,977
Look at our dead guy
with the head in the toilet.

506
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:28,313
- Toilet.
- Was a weekly occurrence for Shelley.

507
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:32,066
Jurel and his buddies at prom
forced Shelley to drink

508
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,943
until he got sick,
same as Sergeant Ross.

509
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:37,923
But their favorite pastime was stuffing
Shelley's head into his backpack.

510
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:38,976
Yeah.

511
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,243
I'd say Shelley held
a grudge all these years.

512
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,037
- We got motive.
- And opportunity.

513
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,638
Be nice to have Shelley.

514
00:27:45,913 --> 00:27:47,802
McGee, bank statements,
credit cards.

515
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,120
- DiNozzo.
- Yes, boss.

516
00:27:58,402 --> 00:28:00,352
- Shake it.
- Thank you, Boss.

517
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,130
"Which my father bought"

518
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,010
"for two zuzim"

519
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:10,639
"chad gadya"...

520
00:28:15,214 --> 00:28:16,779
How long you been standing there?

521
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,199
Long enough to see that you are well
hydrated after your time in the desert.

522
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:23,576
And the thinking
behind surprising me?

523
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,431
I was not sure what to say.

524
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:28,059
But you were sure it had
to be said in the men's room.

525
00:28:31,341 --> 00:28:32,876
I'm sure it had to be said.

526
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:39,422
When you shot Michael,

527
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,344
I almost killed you where you stood.

528
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,032
I wasn't standing.

529
00:28:43,447 --> 00:28:44,717
No, you weren't.

530
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:47,051
You were lying on the ground

531
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:50,142
without adequate backup,
completely violating protocol.

532
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:51,229
And double-parked.

533
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,193
Yes,

534
00:28:52,973 --> 00:28:53,773
I noticed.

535
00:28:57,756 --> 00:28:59,226
But that does not matter.

536
00:29:00,816 --> 00:29:04,450
Just like it does not matter
how it worked out for Michael.

537
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:08,121
So what does?

538
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:15,426
That you had my back.

539
00:29:19,047 --> 00:29:20,550
That you have always

540
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:22,355
had my back

541
00:29:23,248 --> 00:29:24,481
and that I was...

542
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:26,493
wrong...

543
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,361
to question your motives.

544
00:29:31,631 --> 00:29:32,682
So why did you?

545
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:35,851
I trusted my brother Ari.

546
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:38,317
I trusted Michael.

547
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:40,464
I could not afford to trust you.

548
00:29:47,974 --> 00:29:49,620
I thought you weren't sure
what to say.

549
00:29:50,943 --> 00:29:53,345
Guess I had a long time
to think about things.

550
00:29:59,062 --> 00:30:00,609
- I'm sorry, Ziva.
- No.

551
00:30:04,056 --> 00:30:05,179
It is I...

552
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,877
who am sorry.

553
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:18,435
Your instincts were right.

554
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,487
You were a cop, and I should have never
faulted you for thinking like one.

555
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,605
I'm a cop.

556
00:30:27,383 --> 00:30:28,626
I think like a cop.

557
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:31,507
Genius.

558
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,041
I know how to find Officer Shelley.

559
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:38,544
Track his burn phone.

560
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:41,130
We already know where it is.
It's in the evidence garage.

561
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:42,507
He's got another one.

562
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:45,294
That's great,
but without the cells' ESN numbers,

563
00:30:45,354 --> 00:30:47,303
- we can't track any of 'em.
- Think, McSidekick.

564
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:49,934
Use the leading man.
Harness those powers.

565
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:52,153
Okay.

566
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:54,769
It was an unregistered phone.

567
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,898
- It was pricey for a cop.
- Bingo.

568
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:02,369
- Shelley took it from a bust.
- Happens all the time.

569
00:31:02,823 --> 00:31:05,844
An extra Rolex or laptop disappears
from the evidence locker,

570
00:31:05,904 --> 00:31:07,762
not that I've ever done
anything like that.

571
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:11,803
Officer Shelley busted a black-market
cell phone ring last year, and...

572
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,263
the impounded cells' ESN numbers
are all logged.

573
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:19,669
- If he's got one, we can track it.
- See if any are active.

574
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:25,569
We got one of 'em.

575
00:31:28,193 --> 00:31:29,673
Making a call right now.

576
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:37,643
Boss, you may want to answer that.

577
00:31:40,687 --> 00:31:41,695
Yeah. Gibbs.

578
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:43,428
<i>Let me talk to DiNozzo.</i>

579
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:45,611
I'm here.

580
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,188
I know how it looks.

581
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,949
I shouldn't have run,
but I-I didn't kill those guys.

582
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,220
You draw the line
at criminal stalking?

583
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,536
<i>I was following him.</i>

584
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,955
Some kind of deal was going down,
I wanted the details.

585
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,248
You wanted payback.

586
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,792
It was just to take their pot
of gold, hit 'em where it hurts.

587
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:01,529
I didn't kill anybody.

588
00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:03,503
- I was set up.
<i>- Well, then,</i>

589
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,506
why don't you come on in?
I'm a good listener.

590
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,384
I assume you got my location<i> by now.</i>

591
00:32:10,947 --> 00:32:11,679
Yeah.

592
00:32:13,623 --> 00:32:15,391
Phone <i>booth
by the news stand on K street.</i>

593
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:17,420
Come alone.

594
00:32:27,222 --> 00:32:28,578
Thing belongs in a museum.

595
00:32:30,203 --> 00:32:31,389
<i>Yeah, ready.</i>

596
00:32:36,895 --> 00:32:39,113
All right, hop out of there.
I gotta use the phone.

597
00:32:50,082 --> 00:32:51,468
Here he comes, DiNozzo.

598
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,456
Yeah, I see him.

599
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,479
Come on!
We gotta go.

600
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,607
Here we go.
Now!

601
00:33:08,939 --> 00:33:10,071
- You okay?
- Yeah.

602
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:12,782
I got something wet in my hands
but I don't want to think about it.

603
00:33:35,082 --> 00:33:37,568
Shooter was pretty close.
Point-blank range.

604
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:41,109
Witness saw someone approach the car,
heard the shot, shooter took off.

605
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:43,896
Which suggests that Officer Shelley
knew his attacker.

606
00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:45,935
Said he was set up.

607
00:33:46,132 --> 00:33:48,352
Well, his presence here
would tend to confirm that.

608
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:50,879
- But setup by who?
- Someone who knew his past.

609
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:52,863
Making it appear...

610
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:56,200
that he stalked
and murdered his tormentors.

611
00:33:57,761 --> 00:33:59,995
We got a lead on the mystery deal
Shelley was tracking.

612
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:02,352
It's from
Sergeant Ross' CO in Korea.

613
00:34:02,412 --> 00:34:06,255
It's a report of a shooting near the DMZ
at an airstrip used by smugglers.

614
00:34:07,008 --> 00:34:09,588
CO thinks that's where Ross
went on his two-day leave.

615
00:34:09,695 --> 00:34:13,134
After the shooting, Sat-Com tracked
the plane leaving, lost contact.

616
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:15,571
- Think Ross'd a package on that plane?
- He had something.

617
00:34:16,282 --> 00:34:19,886
We want to find out what, we need
to find out who killed officer...

618
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,400
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

619
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:24,478
Shelley. Officer Shelley.

620
00:34:25,698 --> 00:34:28,011
- I think it's something on the body.
- Yes. Cologne.

621
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:30,791
He must have come into contact
recently with an...

622
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:32,194
"overcologner".

623
00:34:32,562 --> 00:34:36,073
I was just about to take
a sample up to Abby for analysis.

624
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,495
<i>So I advertise on Cologne bottles.
Is that a crime?</i>

625
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,143
- Should be.
- <i>Can't believe this. Amateur hour here.</i>

626
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:48,753
I looked into Hector's records.
Turns out he's a man of many...

627
00:34:50,874 --> 00:34:52,421
man of many talents.

628
00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:53,762
Sorry, Boss.

629
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,677
Strippers are just his cover.
He's actually a fence.

630
00:34:56,823 --> 00:35:00,723
Never been convicted, but suspected
of fencing everything from bootleg DVDs

631
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,391
to scud missile parts.

632
00:35:02,513 --> 00:35:03,930
What's he fencing now?

633
00:35:09,511 --> 00:35:10,981
How'd you get the shiner?

634
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:12,940
I cut myself shaving.

635
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,198
Your DNA underneath his fingernails.

636
00:35:19,693 --> 00:35:22,161
He came by this morning.
Then he left. End of story.

637
00:35:23,453 --> 00:35:25,352
One body not good enough for you,
tough guy?

638
00:35:25,412 --> 00:35:27,041
'cause I got 3 more right here!

639
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,212
I had nothing to do with this
and I told the cop the same thing.

640
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:32,719
Why was he asking you?

641
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,927
You've got the right
to remain silent.

642
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:41,140
Anything you say will be used
against you in a court...

643
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,259
Hold on. Hold on.

644
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:47,381
Jurel came to me with something big.

645
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:52,024
The plane. Out of Korea.
It had a package on it.

646
00:35:52,766 --> 00:35:54,318
The package was the plane.

647
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:58,623
Jurel's buddies fudged
some paperwork,

648
00:35:58,683 --> 00:36:01,742
got their hands on a military cargo
plane scheduled for decommissioning.

649
00:36:02,016 --> 00:36:04,719
Jurel wanted me to fence it.
Worth a couple million.

650
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:06,747
They went to the hotel to celebrate.

651
00:36:07,016 --> 00:36:09,524
My girl shows up.
She's only supposed to do her dance,

652
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,873
as a token of my appreciation,

653
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:13,337
and pick up a package.

654
00:36:13,844 --> 00:36:15,673
The lock codes for the plane.

655
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:18,680
And then you know
what she found instead.

656
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:21,554
Officer Shelley.

657
00:36:22,001 --> 00:36:24,390
Next thing I know,
cop shows up at my door.

658
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,601
Roughs me up and accuses me
of setting him up for murder.

659
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:29,603
And he just lets you go?

660
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,454
Yeah, after I told him exactly
what I'm telling you.

661
00:36:32,655 --> 00:36:33,983
He got the wrong guy.

662
00:36:35,347 --> 00:36:37,436
And I got about 50 people...

663
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:39,948
at club Pubis
that can testify to that.

664
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:44,451
Well, it's not quite 50,
but... close enough.

665
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:47,791
Club Pubis is a strip club.
Hector MC's there on Thursday nights.

666
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:49,248
There's at least a dozen people

667
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,500
that can put him there
at the time of the murders.

668
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,586
So we are back to
who killed the cop.

669
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:59,008
And... why they used an antique
percussion cap pistol to do it.

670
00:36:59,771 --> 00:37:02,590
I ran ballistics on the bullet
that killed Officer Shelley.

671
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,722
It was a new bullet
fired from an old gun.

672
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:05,681
How old?

673
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:10,311
It was from a 19th century
VR Tower pistol.

674
00:37:20,784 --> 00:37:23,727
I know a shooting range nearby
where you can take that for a spin.

675
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:25,149
What? Spin?

676
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,744
This is a fine antique.

677
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:28,495
Not some cheap revolver.

678
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:30,664
Keep all your fine antiques
in the trunk?

679
00:37:31,689 --> 00:37:32,398
No.

680
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,733
I recently discovered it
missing from inventory.

681
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:36,485
I suspected it was stolen.

682
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:38,631
And... I've been looking for it.

683
00:37:38,818 --> 00:37:40,090
And there it is.

684
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,510
And worked so nicely for us
since that gun was used in a murder.

685
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:47,306
- This isn't my car.
- We know that.

686
00:37:47,776 --> 00:37:50,567
- It's Elena's. Where is she?
- I just called her.

687
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,454
I said to meet me out here

688
00:37:52,781 --> 00:37:53,854
to explain this.

689
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:56,273
She hasn't had time to dump it yet.

690
00:37:58,244 --> 00:37:59,818
Look who's here, boss.

691
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:06,012
See, you run away like that, kind of
makes you look guilty, Miss Marcus.

692
00:38:06,524 --> 00:38:07,660
Guilty of what?

693
00:38:07,983 --> 00:38:09,787
- Murder.
- Always said she was trouble.

694
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,790
She found out about a deal
your boss had going down.

695
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:16,961
You partnered with Officer Shelley.

696
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,463
Then you double-crossed him,
and kept the payday for yourself.

697
00:38:21,335 --> 00:38:22,799
Set Shelley up for murder.

698
00:38:25,156 --> 00:38:26,136
What's so funny?

699
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:28,527
You haven't arrested me.

700
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:31,392
- Means you don't have any proof.
- McProof.

701
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:34,089
Fake suicide note we found
on Shelley's computer...

702
00:38:34,149 --> 00:38:36,776
We traced the worm that planted
that back to your laptop.

703
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,316
Proves you killed Jurel,
his buddies and Shelley.

704
00:38:40,605 --> 00:38:42,051
You know what that means.

705
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:46,031
- You're under arrest.
- You're under arrest.

706
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,326
You're a bad little putty tat.

707
00:38:51,982 --> 00:38:54,317
- Where'd boss go?
- I don't know.

708
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:00,577
We need to talk.

709
00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:13,152
Sit down.

710
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:22,099
When I came to see you
and said I wanted back...

711
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,769
You said it was the Director's call.

712
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:31,744
But I sensed your hesitation.

713
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:35,531
I sense it now.

714
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:38,464
Even though I...

715
00:39:39,215 --> 00:39:41,535
thought I made myself clear.

716
00:39:43,656 --> 00:39:46,101
I understand
what you did in Israel...

717
00:39:46,353 --> 00:39:47,812
Your brother, Ari.

718
00:39:53,113 --> 00:39:54,975
You know what happened that night.

719
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:01,781
It was here.

720
00:40:02,811 --> 00:40:04,276
I want to hear it from you.

721
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:10,647
You had orders to kill
your brother to earn my trust?

722
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:14,789
Yes.

723
00:40:17,388 --> 00:40:18,457
That's a problem.

724
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:20,250
You don't understand.

725
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,979
You're damn right
I don't understand!

726
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:25,422
- When I volunteered for that mission...
- You killed your own brother, Ziva!

727
00:40:25,638 --> 00:40:28,292
It was because I hoped
my father was wrong about Ari.

728
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:31,123
And I did not want someone else
blindly following orders.

729
00:40:31,183 --> 00:40:32,721
I volunteered to protect him, Gibbs.

730
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:34,723
- You lied to me.
- No, when I told you

731
00:40:35,211 --> 00:40:36,850
Ari was innocent, I believed it.

732
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,639
But, yes.

733
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,259
I would've lied to you.

734
00:40:44,588 --> 00:40:46,274
He was my brother.

735
00:40:49,192 --> 00:40:50,450
And you were nothing.

736
00:40:55,096 --> 00:40:56,625
But I was wrong about Ari.

737
00:40:58,201 --> 00:40:59,206
And you.

738
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,001
When I pulled the trigger
to save your life,

739
00:41:03,248 --> 00:41:05,336
I was not following orders.

740
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,756
How could you even think...

741
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,968
He was my brother.

742
00:41:16,178 --> 00:41:17,663
And now he is gone.

743
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,127
Eli is all but dead to me.

744
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,152
And the closest thing I have...

745
00:41:25,378 --> 00:41:26,485
to a father...

746
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:30,922
is accusing me.

747
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,538
Okay.

748
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,050
Headed straight to the airport.

749
00:41:44,723 --> 00:41:46,644
Yeah, that's why they call it
a Go Bag, Honey,

750
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,538
and I keep it
in the trunk of my car.

751
00:41:49,818 --> 00:41:52,627
Yeah, all right.
I'll call you as soon as I land.

752
00:41:57,042 --> 00:41:58,098
I love you, too.

753
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:00,932
All right.

754
00:42:03,206 --> 00:42:04,237
Moving on.

755
00:42:04,664 --> 00:42:07,103
So, how was your date
with the shrink last night, McRomeo?

756
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:08,501
Think I'm going to tell you?

757
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:11,306
- Tells me everything I need to know.
- It's actually pretty complicated.

758
00:42:11,366 --> 00:42:12,991
Dr. Bracco is Ziva's...

759
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,425
Ziva's what?

760
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,411
Ziva's here.
