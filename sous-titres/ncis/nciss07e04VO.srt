2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,229
Eli David put Ziva and a team

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,506
on a Jordanian freighter
called the Damocles.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,841
Damocles went down
in a storm 28th of May

5
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,052
off the coast of Somalia.
There were no survivors.

6
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:15,598
You're damaged goods.

7
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:16,686
How damaged?

8
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:19,811
I need to know before I can even begin
to figure out what to do with you.

9
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:23,125
- I want to be a NCIS Agent.
- I don't even know if that's possible.

10
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:30,606
Here we go.

11
00:00:31,187 --> 00:00:32,123
Bring it down.

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,784
Four damn shrimp?

13
00:00:34,978 --> 00:00:36,772
A couple more,
we'll have enough for dinner.

14
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:38,294
Come on, man.

15
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:39,706
Where's your sense of humor?

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,125
I left it at the laser-tag arena.

17
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,544
- Now, that was a dumb idea of yours.
- Here we go.

18
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:47,505
But the only thing dumber than your idea
to become shrimp fisherman

19
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:49,340
in the Indian Ocean

20
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,092
is me for coming with you.

21
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,637
There's a bag caught up in the net.

22
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:56,463
Maybe it's a big bag of shrimp.

23
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,015
Oh, my god, I'm going to kill you.

24
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:00,643
And I'm going to leave
your corpse out here to rot.

25
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,437
When they find you, you're gonna...

26
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:04,659
What is that?

27
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,492
NCIS Season 7 Episode 04
Good Cop, Bad Cop V1.0 FQM

28
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,747
Synchro: Gaillots.

29
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,711
Rereading: Bruno & Magic Turtle.

30
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,629
www.Team-NCIS.com

31
00:01:49,517 --> 00:01:53,112
Tony, I know that I am on a deadline
with these investigation reports, so

32
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,362
the clock is redundant.

33
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:56,159
When was the last time
you had late paper?

34
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,618
I bet you were a wee probie, probie.

35
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,661
Last time was never.

36
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,581
No PC-wiping macro virus
is going to blemish my streak.

37
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:05,705
Do you hear that?
Listen.

38
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,587
Stop it with the ticktock!

39
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:12,778
I'm sorry, Captain Hook.

40
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,010
I didn't see any crocodiles.
Maybe it's in your head.

41
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:17,876
Or your heart.

42
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:19,680
It's an Edgar Allan Poe reference.

43
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:21,119
That's right. I read.

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,851
Maybe you got a body buried
under your floorboards?

45
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:27,078
- Well, the day is young.
- You need a body buried, McGee?

46
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:31,335
You want to make your deadline,
and I...

47
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:34,195
I am waiting on the status
of my application to become an agent.

48
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,785
Those applications
take forever to vet.

49
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:39,909
Even then, it's conditional
upon you becoming an official citizen.

50
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:43,184
But teamwork is still possible
even though I am...

51
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:45,732
not an official member of the team.

52
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:47,255
You catch my grift?

53
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:48,049
Drift.

54
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:50,327
I got heart palpitations.
You really scared me.

55
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,573
Someone dial nine-one, and wait-wait
for me to tell you to dial the last one.

56
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,884
You know, I could access the employment
database, put a rush on your file.

57
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,398
And I could finish your R.O.Is.

58
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,758
You got to dial nine
to get out of the building,

59
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:05,638
so dial 9-9-1, and then wait for me
to tell you to dial the last one.

60
00:03:05,698 --> 00:03:07,794
You also got to do
Tony's paperwork for the week.

61
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,395
It's a long story.
Tony bet me that he could...

62
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:12,231
erase this virus off my computer.

63
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:14,481
He cheated.
I know he cheated.

64
00:03:14,722 --> 00:03:15,953
Just don't know how yet.

65
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:18,481
Why do you find it so hard to believe
I could hack that sucker out?

66
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,140
You cannot even work
your e-mail properly.

67
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:25,140
You always reply "to all".
It drives me absolutely nuts.

68
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:28,249
You know, when it comes to computers,
you are almost as incompetent as Gib...

69
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:33,365
You thought Gibbs was behind you.
You know why?

70
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,055
'Cause sneaky people
expect sneakiness.

71
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:37,466
It's a vicious circle.

72
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,410
Boss is in MTAC with Vance.

73
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,927
Shrimping boat netted a Marine's body
off the coast of Tanzania.

74
00:03:45,764 --> 00:03:49,662
Apparently, all they found was, bones,
soupy flesh and a mangled dog tag.

75
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:59,390
Somebody like to light a fire
under Special Agent Dunham in Tanzania?

76
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,482
Yes, Sir.

77
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:03,027
You out of toothpicks?

78
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:05,330
I pulled one earlier.
I got a splinter in my cheek.

79
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,272
Cut myself shaving this morning.

80
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:09,079
These things come in threes.

81
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,250
- You superstitious?
- I'm a little stitious.

82
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,335
We have contact.

83
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:14,377
<i>Director Vance, Gibbs,</i>

84
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,581
<i>sorry for the delay.
It's the damn satellites.</i>

85
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:18,581
You working on anything other
than that beard?

86
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,131
<i>Yeah, boys and I got a pool going
to whoever grows it the thickest.</i>

87
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:23,051
<i>It looks like
a damn teen wolf convention.</i>

88
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:25,206
We saw your crime scene photos.
It's a hell of a mess.

89
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,010
<i>Dental records confirmed the Marine
as Staff Sergeant Daniel Cryer.</i>

90
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,518
<i>I talked to his former C.O.</i>

91
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:32,605
<i>Said Cryer was sharp, had experience
infiltrating terrorist cells.</i>

92
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:34,015
Past tense?

93
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:36,206
<i>He's a deserter.
Went U.A. six months back.</i>

94
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:39,069
<i>There was a short investigation,
but he was never caught.</i>

95
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:42,156
<i>- Always a step ahead.</i>
- Not surprised. Trained to disappear.

96
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:44,158
<i>Got a tip
he'd been spotted in Jordan.</i>

97
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,408
Who was your source?

98
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:46,957
<i>Former Israeli Officer.</i>

99
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:49,330
<i>Does security consulting
along the Red Sea.</i>

100
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,770
<i>Claims Cryer was hanging
his own shingle.</i>

101
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,976
What was he selling?

102
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:57,059
<i>Connections, and not sure of the why
or the how, but Cryer was spotted</i>

103
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,939
<i>boarding a small freighter
bound for East Africa.</i>

104
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,592
<i>The name of that freighter was...</i>

105
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:03,006
The Damocles.

106
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,887
<i>Yes, Sir, that's the one.</i>

107
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:08,041
<i>Was lost at sea, and salvage vessels
never recovered any wreckage.</i>

108
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,977
- <i>Guess Cryer went down with the ship.</i>
- That would account for him being dead.

109
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:13,271
Doesn't explain
why he was wrapped in plastic.

110
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:16,187
<i>There's no way to know what went down
on board. There were no survivors.</i>

111
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:18,901
I saw the official report.
You stay close, Chad.

112
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,596
We know someone
who lived through that shipwreck.

113
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:26,158
You saw this coming.

114
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:27,368
You didn't?

115
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,370
You know her better than I do.

116
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:31,122
Closer to her than anyone.

117
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,707
Your relationship with her father
doesn't tie your hands?

118
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,348
No. It absolutely does.

119
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:36,919
So, good cop, bad cop?

120
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:39,281
Plenty of other ways
to break someone, Leon.

121
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:41,029
I figure she's been broken enough.

122
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,758
Okay, good cop, bad cop.

123
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:44,811
Which one are you?

124
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,885
- How's my agent application coming?
- I am working my magic.

125
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,303
Trust me, Ziva,
when I'm through, you will be...

126
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,311
Code blue?

127
00:05:54,976 --> 00:05:57,815
- Someone's been blackballed.
- They gave you the red flag.

128
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:01,670
What is blue, black and red?

129
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:04,280
- Zebra in a blender.
- That's black, white and red all over.

130
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,157
- Newspaper.
- Penguin with a sunburn.

131
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:07,640
Nuns falling down stairs.

132
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:10,911
Why have I been rejected?!

133
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,815
Seems we have a problem.

134
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:25,591
Give me everything
on Staff Sergeant Daniel Cryer.

135
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,843
<i>You got it, boss.</i>

136
00:06:35,971 --> 00:06:37,670
You red-flagged my application?

137
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:41,025
There are inconsistencies
that need to be addressed.

138
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:43,444
- My psych evaluation?
- Yes.

139
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:46,405
Inconsistencies
in my psychological profile?

140
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:47,907
Somewhat troubling.

141
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:49,703
But expected.

142
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:51,911
You were held
in a prison camp for months.

143
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:53,204
But you survived it.

144
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:56,290
You didn't talk about that
with the counselor.

145
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:59,127
So now I'm going
to talk about it with you.

146
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:03,973
You've been in the service
of two masters for too long.

147
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,426
Your loyalty to your father
and Mossad predates anything else.

148
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:09,136
<i>My father is not an issue.</i>

149
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:11,597
<i>Okay. You want to stay...</i>

150
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:15,750
here at NCIS, let's talk.
That's the price of admission.

151
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:24,568
Let's start with the events
that led you to the camp.

152
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,515
Running a diagnostic on the virus
you removed from my computer.

153
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:30,908
Gone, probie.
Get over it.

154
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,349
I can't even figure out
how the virus got in the system.

155
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,829
Wasn't an attachment.
Wasn't a Trojan horse.

156
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:38,249
- Did you quarantine the file?
- Hey, I'm a hacker.

157
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:40,501
I hack.
We got bigger issues.

158
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:43,598
Ziva's in with Principal Vance, getting
paddled or up a creek without one.

159
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:45,797
We got a dead Marine, right?

160
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:48,038
- What do we got?
- I'll tell you what we got.

161
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:49,725
We got Marine Staff Sergeant

162
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,972
Daniel Cryer.
Recruited right out of high school.

163
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,165
Talk faster. Eliminate the dead air
between your words.

164
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,767
I can absorb things very quickly.

165
00:07:58,974 --> 00:08:01,564
Received training at Camp Pendleton,
then shipped out on multiple tours

166
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,319
in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Specialized in counterintelligence.

167
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,026
Immaculate record
until six months ago.

168
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:09,989
Unauthorized absence failed to report
back to his fire base outside Kandahar.

169
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,537
- Stopped communicating...
- Take a breath, have a keyboard.

170
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:15,411
Well done.
What about the Damocles?

171
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:18,442
Lost at sea about a hundred miles
off the coast of Tanzania,

172
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:21,500
which was a couple hundred miles
off its charted course.

173
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,102
They got lost at sea
before they got lost at sea.

174
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,934
So we got Ziva on a ship that went down
somewhere it wasn't supposed to be,

175
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:30,676
and body bag filled with goo from a dead
that wasn't supposed to be there.

176
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:33,166
And nothing is
what it's supposed to be.

177
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:35,764
Gibbs tosses us,
the investigation disappears.

178
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:37,490
It's like <i>Alien</i>,

179
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,060
the Ridley Scott classic.
The creepy one.

180
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,667
As opposed to the non-creepy ones?

181
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:45,441
Cameron's was more actiony than creepy,
and Fincher's was more sleepy.

182
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:48,903
Jeunet was sort of a french fried...
I don't know what to call it.

183
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:51,197
Anyway,
I hear skittering through the air ducts.

184
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,757
Ziva hasn't been Ziva
since we brought her home.

185
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,792
Something happened to her out there.

186
00:08:57,852 --> 00:09:00,229
Now we're all waiting to see
if something pops out of her chest.

187
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,025
You're speaking
metaphorically, right?

188
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,023
You're not supposed
to leave the bridge.

189
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,373
I'm gonna go see Abby.

190
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:09,855
We should stay in pairs.

191
00:09:17,962 --> 00:09:19,225
Soothing.

192
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:20,596
Are you kidding me?

193
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,270
This is horrible.
It's terrible.

194
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:24,813
I don't like it at all.

195
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,857
I don't like it, either.

196
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:29,422
What? I'm agreeing with you.

197
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:31,345
Do you have any idea
what you're agreeing to?

198
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,489
No. 'Cause if you did,
you wouldn't agree.

199
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:37,326
These are thermal images
of weather patterns.

200
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,794
What we have here is a close-up
of a high-pressure system

201
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:41,438
pushing into a low-pressure area.

202
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,749
The new air becomes warm and moist,

203
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:47,044
so while the warm air continues to rise,
the surrounding air

204
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,671
has to swirl in and take its place,
which gives you...?

205
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,092
- Snow?
- Tropical storms.

206
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,635
Tropical storms.

207
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:59,515
Horn of Africa?
This is about the Damocles.

208
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,433
What have you been working on?

209
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,728
Ziva's said in her report
that the ship went down in a storm.

210
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,854
Based on the date,

211
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:09,312
this would have been
the only weather pattern violent enough.

212
00:10:10,797 --> 00:10:13,487
But Cryer's body
was found way over here.

213
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:16,643
Stop agreeing with me, McGee.

214
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:20,536
Cryer's body must have been carried

215
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,080
by the Agulhas Current
along the coast of Africa.

216
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:24,488
But the storm...

217
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:26,040
It never went that far South.

218
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,210
It stayed in
the Equatorial Counter Current.

219
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:30,239
So if Cryer went down
with the ship...

220
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,133
As far as the ship is concerned,

221
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:35,634
in my purely scientific
fact-based opinion,

222
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:38,707
that ship was never
anywhere near that storm.

223
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:42,363
- Tell me I'm wrong, McGee.
- Abby, I don't like it, either, but...

224
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,249
- Don't say it.
- Abby.

225
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:48,903
I got it. Using your calculations
of where the body was found,

226
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:50,733
we can backtrack
the ocean current to find

227
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,984
the exact location
where the Damocles went down.

228
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,571
We can tell the salvage ship
where to look for the wreckage.

229
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:59,033
They should already be there by now.
I called it in like an hour ago.

230
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:01,748
What's with the Sushi bar?

231
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:04,079
Staff Sergeant Cryer's body
was not alone

232
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:06,736
on its considerable time adrift.

233
00:11:07,524 --> 00:11:10,919
Yeah, that's probably what they thought
when they were feeding on his flesh.

234
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,838
Much like insects on land,

235
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,674
creatures of the sea have
a cyclical feeding pattern.

236
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,385
A pattern that can help confirm
how long a body has been dead.

237
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:22,888
In the case of Staff Sergeant Cryer,
approximately 16 weeks.

238
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:25,678
Fits with the time frame
of the Damocles' sinking.

239
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:26,814
However,

240
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,021
drowning was not the cause of death.

241
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:32,761
Gunshot penetrated
above the left ear.

242
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:34,668
Yeah, look at that.

243
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:38,781
No exit.

244
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:41,554
The missing jaw,
the occipital fractures...

245
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:43,329
That is the exit wound.

246
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:45,788
Unfortunately,
we were unable to find a slug.

247
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:48,165
Yes, McGee.
What is the good news?

248
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:50,455
That's bad.

249
00:11:51,306 --> 00:11:53,399
That's really bad.
Yeah. All right.

250
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,695
Yeah, Ducky, I'll let you know
if there's anything else you can do.

251
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:05,849
Your father, Eli David, offered you
the vacant slot in the Kidon unit,

252
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:07,869
previously held by Michael Rivkin.

253
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,105
That is correct.

254
00:12:09,347 --> 00:12:11,535
Director David had intel

255
00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:14,028
that could be used to track
the terrorist, Saleem Ulman...

256
00:12:14,552 --> 00:12:18,367
Responsible for the deaths of Americans
and Israelis, including a Mossad agent.

257
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:21,205
- I cannot comment on Mossad operations.
- I know this to be true

258
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:23,283
because I'm the one
who provided Eli with the intel.

259
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:25,742
You are no longer
in the employ of Mossad.

260
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:27,430
That does not change anything.

261
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,901
That's what concerns me.

262
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,988
Let's stick to geography.

263
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:37,934
You crossed the Israeli border at Eilat.
You booked passage somehow...

264
00:12:38,243 --> 00:12:40,259
on a cargo ship out of Aqaba.

265
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,804
You set out through the Red Sea
towards the coast of Somalia.

266
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,306
But the Damocles never
made it to port.

267
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:49,053
No, it did not.

268
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:51,979
Which brings me to the first question
I actually need an answer to.

269
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:55,642
We recovered a body
from the Damocles, wrapped in plastic.

270
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:58,266
He was already dead
before the ship went down.

271
00:12:59,368 --> 00:13:01,478
- The question.
- Can you explain that?

272
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:06,184
Occasionally, people die on board,
on a ship in transit.

273
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,461
In most cases,

274
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:10,289
the corpse is wrapped
and then stored in a freezer.

275
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,332
This body had a bullet hole in it.

276
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:18,199
I want to know
how Staff Sergeant Daniel Cryer died.

277
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:26,113
What do we got?

278
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,016
Salvage ships finally
located the Damocles.

279
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:31,101
Found 18 more bodies.

280
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:33,020
In a cargo space.

281
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:36,356
Looks like the entire crew
was executed.

282
00:13:58,728 --> 00:14:00,577
Aren't you on the wrong side?

283
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:03,481
Of the glass.

284
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:06,625
Look at her.
Look at the state she's in.

285
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:09,669
I would have thought you'd have wanted
to be in there yourself,

286
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,975
rather than having Vance
interrogate her.

287
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:14,770
Don't you have some bodies
to attend to?

288
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:18,557
The evidence from the Damocles
is being unloaded as we speak.

289
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,318
Isn't this punishing her?

290
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,215
I mean, you're not concerned
that she might lie to you?

291
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,668
Maybe it's tough love.

292
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:30,953
You do know there are other kinds.

293
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:44,679
- You're charging me with a crime.
- Seems like one's been committed.

294
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:49,471
Ship looks like a war zone.

295
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:51,452
Jordanian flagship.

296
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,267
It is not your jurisdiction.

297
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:55,213
You are my jurisdiction.

298
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,634
At least, you want to be.
Have a seat.

299
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,611
For the record,

300
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:06,480
the US Marine among the dead,

301
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,115
that makes it my business.

302
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:11,254
For the record,
I have not yet charged you with a crime.

303
00:15:11,314 --> 00:15:13,534
- Then why am I in here?
- For the record.

304
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,914
<i>Start recording.</i>

305
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:21,962
I should remind you that there is
such a thing as a crime of omission.

306
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:27,919
Take me to the Damocles.

307
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,534
That is no way
to begin a relationship.

308
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:37,037
Cup of tea?

309
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:39,486
Thank you.

310
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:42,334
My own blend.
A family tradition.

311
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,164
You are a woman.

312
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:48,590
You're a genius.

313
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:50,848
I have no problem with women.

314
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:55,389
But I cannot vouch for my men.

315
00:16:57,569 --> 00:16:59,309
I am not paying you
to assure my safety.

316
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:01,376
What are you paying me for?

317
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,882
Passage.

318
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:04,585
And discretion.

319
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:08,920
The second I can guarantee.

320
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:10,444
As for the first...

321
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:12,864
To Somalia.

322
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:17,910
You have been misinformed.

323
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:19,788
The Damocles is headed for Masqat.

324
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:21,199
That is not true.

325
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,416
You lie.

326
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:28,243
To protect his crew, of course.

327
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,587
Shalev, my friend,

328
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:32,426
what offense have I done
that you would send me such people?

329
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:33,936
Their money is good.

330
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,380
All money is good.

331
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:44,979
Welcome aboard.

332
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,398
We leave tonight.

333
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,201
The crew is sitting down to eat.

334
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,660
Ziva, you are coming?

335
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:01,580
Not hungry.

336
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:05,845
Aviv, you go ahead.
We're right behind you.

337
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:11,173
We do not need to make friends
with the crew.

338
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,466
We need their trust.

339
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:15,051
And breaking bread
will ease their nerves?

340
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:17,514
At the moment,
it is not their nerves which concern me.

341
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,719
Have you ever seen
a snake shed its skin,

342
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:21,429
and then try to crawl back into it?

343
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:23,810
It is not natural.

344
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,697
You don't need your old skin.

345
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:27,564
It is who you are inside.

346
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:28,889
Just relax.

347
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:30,330
Let it grow back.

348
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,510
The Americans left you, Ziva.

349
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,807
Your family never has.

350
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:22,612
What are you looking for?

351
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,568
Hey. All right, all right.

352
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:27,310
I just thought this was the head.

353
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:28,866
Tell the truth.

354
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:30,774
Or I shoot you.

355
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,339
In the head.

356
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:34,638
I made a mistake.
It was just a mistake.

357
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:39,010
I cannot help but question.
You say you are going to Somalia?

358
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:40,971
Why?

359
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:42,373
I don't know.

360
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:43,807
No one goes to Somalia

361
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,252
without a reason.

362
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,667
Very few go with a reason.

363
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:48,949
He tells the truth.

364
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:51,690
He does not know.
He just works for me.

365
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,817
He opens doors
he should not be opening.

366
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:57,404
- I feel I should shoot him!
- I would rather you did not.

367
00:19:57,891 --> 00:19:59,457
I asked him to find us some...

368
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:00,836
privacy.

369
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,690
He works for you.

370
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:12,838
Good night.

371
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:19,878
- I didn't mean to...
- Not another word.

372
00:20:19,938 --> 00:20:21,553
You should not be snooping around.

373
00:20:22,496 --> 00:20:23,835
That's how I make my living.

374
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:26,058
Not if you do anything
to jeopardize this mission.

375
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:28,044
I will kill you myself.

376
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:32,775
And the man you saved that night,
who was he?

377
00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:35,982
He was a private contractor
we hired to put us on the ship.

378
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:39,029
He said his name was Daniel Shalev.

379
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:43,283
<i>- But you know otherwise.
- That was the name he used in Jordan.</i>

380
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:46,620
He went by Daniel Cryer
when he was a US Marine.

381
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,455
Did you know he was a Marine?

382
00:20:49,021 --> 00:20:52,548
In a ship filled
with smugglers and thieves,

383
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:55,170
he did not fit in.

384
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:56,760
So, you trusted him?

385
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:00,216
Do you know the word, <i>mishpacha</i>?

386
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:01,586
It's family.

387
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:03,585
He was not.

388
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:07,647
You cannot trust a man...

389
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:09,802
whose loyalty has a price.

390
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,235
Nice bedside manner.

391
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,817
You're lucky you're not dead.

392
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:25,126
That's true for anyone.

393
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,964
The others are up
at the breakfast buffet.

394
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:29,996
Malachi wanted
to let you get some rest.

395
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,356
Past couple of weeks
have been trying.

396
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:36,962
Who are you exactly, Mr. Shalev?

397
00:21:42,713 --> 00:21:44,344
Your Hebrew name does not fit.

398
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:46,346
Well, I was just bar mitzvahed.

399
00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:48,348
Late-life awakening?

400
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:49,926
Not too late.

401
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:51,885
I'm 31 years old.

402
00:21:52,183 --> 00:21:54,631
And adept at dodging questions.

403
00:21:54,838 --> 00:21:55,814
Who am I?

404
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:59,429
Does anybody really like
answering that question?

405
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:01,697
How do you define yourself?

406
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:04,027
You are...

407
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:07,763
what you say.

408
00:22:09,777 --> 00:22:11,012
You are what you eat.

409
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:14,275
You are what you do.

410
00:22:17,028 --> 00:22:18,180
You are reckless.

411
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,342
You mean last night
with that psycho Numas?

412
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:27,302
I've talked my way out
of worse situations.

413
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,211
I'm sure you have.

414
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,273
If you don't want
to give yourself away,

415
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,733
lose the jewelry.

416
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:42,391
I would sooner die
than take this necklace off.

417
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:48,775
You ought to know.

418
00:22:58,597 --> 00:23:00,754
- Get it.
- You, you're the senior field agent.

419
00:23:00,987 --> 00:23:03,470
So it's my responsibility
to answer Gibbs' phone in his absence?

420
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:06,874
- Then you have to get it.
- How do you figure that?

421
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:09,334
Because you're supposed to do
all my work because of the bet.

422
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:16,061
This is Special Agent McGee.

423
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,520
<i>We have a Mossad Officer.</i>

424
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,522
- Okay, I'll escort him up.
- Escort who?

425
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:21,524
Someone named Ben-Gidon.

426
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:24,552
Get him.
I'll get Gibbs.

427
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:28,531
<i>The ship was supposed
to resupply Saleem.</i>

428
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:30,742
You greased
Cryer's palm to book passage.

429
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,660
That sounds
like something he wasn't.

430
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:35,138
- He cashed out of the corps.
- Look,

431
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:38,221
I have learned
many things from Gibbs.

432
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,749
One of the first lessons...

433
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:43,004
There is no such thing
as an ex-Marine.

434
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:45,644
<i>Regardless of who Cryer had become.</i>

435
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:48,884
Boss, we got a problem.

436
00:23:52,721 --> 00:23:55,191
What can we do for you,
Officer Ben-Gidon?

437
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,290
I have come for Ziva David.

438
00:23:57,456 --> 00:23:59,479
You're holding a member
of my team hostage in there.

439
00:23:59,761 --> 00:24:01,106
Your team's had a rough year.

440
00:24:01,784 --> 00:24:04,133
I think you already missed
your chance to rescue Ziva.

441
00:24:05,221 --> 00:24:07,737
Then I hope I have arrived
in time to rescue her from you.

442
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:17,622
- Hostage?
- Yeah.

443
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:20,847
That's the word of
Officer Malachi Ben-Gidon.

444
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,418
I'm keeping Ziva hostage?

445
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:24,254
Leon, she's got
no connection to NCIS.

446
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,589
Except we pulled her out
of the desert and they didn't.

447
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:28,779
- Why didn't they?
- We found her first.

448
00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:32,886
Eli didn't send his cleaner.
He sent the Kidon team leader.

449
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,556
Ziva's commanding Officer.

450
00:24:34,797 --> 00:24:37,392
He says if we force Ziva
to talk about Mossad operations,

451
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,246
she'll be in violation
of Israeli law.

452
00:24:39,786 --> 00:24:42,564
- She's not at liberty to speak to us.
- No, he doesn't want her to talk.

453
00:24:43,027 --> 00:24:46,109
He's got to put something on the table.
Why don't we see how much rope he's got?

454
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:48,463
Probably just enough
to hang himself.

455
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:52,282
There's coasters in the cabinet.

456
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:55,941
Ice water.

457
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:58,489
I keep the top shelf on the bottom.

458
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,048
Everything...

459
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:02,934
is upside-down.

460
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:09,025
You should have told me
you were coming.

461
00:25:09,085 --> 00:25:11,441
I would have picked you up
at the airport, returned the favor.

462
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:13,928
Good to see you.

463
00:25:14,704 --> 00:25:16,888
So... I am really sorry

464
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,818
that we haven't stayed
in touch since Israel.

465
00:25:19,303 --> 00:25:20,914
Not even so much as an e-card.

466
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,281
Modern times...
Everyone's so busy.

467
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,544
I hope we're showing you
the same hospitality you guys showed me.

468
00:25:27,604 --> 00:25:29,015
I had a blast in Israel.

469
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,863
Anyone offer you tea or coffee?
We're out of gefilte fish.

470
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,236
Do you truly enjoy
jellied balls of carp

471
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:37,577
or are you merely
being anti-semitic?

472
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:41,163
Hold on one second.
Yeah, boss.

473
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,893
<i>DiNozzo, bring our guest downstairs.
Now.</i>

474
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:45,669
Will do.

475
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,063
Manners... Where are mine?

476
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:51,298
Let me take you to Ziva.

477
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:57,889
Where is she?

478
00:25:58,263 --> 00:26:01,980
You worried we buried her in a deep,
dark hole someplace, left her to rot?

479
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:03,937
That's not our style.

480
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:05,917
You have had
adequate time for debriefing.

481
00:26:05,977 --> 00:26:08,524
Cease your interrogation
and return her immediately.

482
00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:10,419
The thanks of a grateful nation.

483
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,304
These are
Director David's instructions.

484
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,613
You're just the messenger.

485
00:26:14,228 --> 00:26:17,636
I respect Director David's intentions,
but I got a dead Marine downstairs.

486
00:26:19,618 --> 00:26:22,664
I can't release her until I find out
what happened on that ship.

487
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,293
I was there, too.

488
00:26:30,273 --> 00:26:31,651
I tell you what happened,

489
00:26:32,556 --> 00:26:34,199
and Ziva goes free.

490
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:48,146
Who are they cheering for?

491
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,017
The favorite.
They are fickle.

492
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,235
We make landfall in two days.

493
00:26:53,227 --> 00:26:54,404
That's the schedule.

494
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:56,633
There have been no changes?

495
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,188
I have Aviv monitoring
all on-board transmissions.

496
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:05,548
Too far at sea for radio to land.

497
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:06,795
Satellite phones.

498
00:27:07,227 --> 00:27:08,584
You do not trust the Captain?

499
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,841
I do not trust anyone.

500
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:15,883
Yosef has been in contact
with Saleem's courier.

501
00:27:16,196 --> 00:27:17,677
To alert him of their arrival.

502
00:27:17,921 --> 00:27:20,332
- You think he suspects us?
- I think there is too much talk.

503
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:21,639
We need silence.

504
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:25,397
You are contemplating
a change to the plan.

505
00:27:25,594 --> 00:27:27,475
Tomorrow the ship'll be
in range of the coast.

506
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:28,980
We cannot do anything until then.

507
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,568
Your father says
any means necessary.

508
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,776
I haven't seen
this many soggy electronics

509
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,565
since wet Monday at science camp.

510
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:20,429
We used to build water guns,
water cannons, water balloon launchers.

511
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:22,575
Actually,
it's a terrible idea in retrospect.

512
00:28:22,817 --> 00:28:23,826
Forensic triage.

513
00:28:23,926 --> 00:28:26,409
These phones and radios
are going to need repair.

514
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:28,834
All these weapons
are a ballistics nightmare.

515
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:31,250
We're going to need
a plan of attack here.

516
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:32,960
That would violate my philosophy.

517
00:28:33,414 --> 00:28:34,295
A philosophy?

518
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:37,298
I have many philosophies, but
I'm talking about one that's relevant

519
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:39,592
to now, when dealing
with large amounts of evidence.

520
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,551
Which is?

521
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,056
No plan... just go.
Find along the way.

522
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:46,516
- If you look for something specific...
- Then there's only one right answer.

523
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:48,616
High five, McGee.

524
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,146
- What was that for?
- Positive energy.

525
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:55,130
The collision of two life forces
in solidarity.

526
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:57,933
The reverberations will be felt
by the rest of team Ziva,

527
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,570
wherever they may be hiding.

528
00:29:00,117 --> 00:29:02,913
- Gibbs isn't hiding.
- He isn't acting like he's on her team.

529
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,373
One more.

530
00:29:05,992 --> 00:29:07,120
Come on, for Ziva.

531
00:29:18,616 --> 00:29:20,591
I am in need of clarification

532
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,320
that perhaps you could provide.
Anthony, if you wouldn't mind...

533
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,744
Believe me, I wouldn't mind.

534
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,362
Director Vance will not permit me
to be without an escort.

535
00:29:27,957 --> 00:29:29,700
Well, in that case...

536
00:29:30,241 --> 00:29:31,834
After you, my dear.

537
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,440
Wait, Ducky.

538
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:43,076
Complex situations often call for...

539
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:44,907
creative solutions.

540
00:29:47,697 --> 00:29:49,120
The crew of the Damocles,

541
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:52,540
removed from their watery graves.

542
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:55,957
Sit down.

543
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,371
I do not know what games
they are playing upstairs,

544
00:30:02,431 --> 00:30:04,510
but I have had enough.

545
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:10,060
First and foremost
you are our friend.

546
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,455
I want to be a friend, Ziva.

547
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,778
Bahir Numas,

548
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,859
Quadir Nawaf,

549
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:21,947
Kassib Yosef,

550
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,635
Emir Aza,

551
00:30:23,695 --> 00:30:25,865
- Bilal...
- I do not need to know their names.

552
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:29,750
And yet you carry the weight
of their deaths around with you,

553
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,622
and there's no need to.

554
00:30:32,926 --> 00:30:34,528
I mean, trust us

555
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,445
as we trust you.

556
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:39,433
Let them go.

557
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,798
There is only one name.

558
00:30:45,272 --> 00:30:47,467
Staff Sergeant Daniel Cryer.

559
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:49,974
Yeah, that's him there.

560
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,518
I knew him as Daniel Shalev.

561
00:30:55,747 --> 00:30:58,940
The truth, Ziva, may set you free.

562
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,685
And it may not.

563
00:31:04,803 --> 00:31:07,157
Some bodies are not meant
to stay buried.

564
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,671
What happened to him?

565
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:15,449
Cabin fever.

566
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,894
Paranoia.

567
00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:19,606
Maybe we just underestimated them.

568
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,424
As it turns out,
we were not the only ones

569
00:31:22,484 --> 00:31:24,502
monitoring outgoing transmissions.

570
00:31:24,562 --> 00:31:26,851
You cannot be certain that Shalev
has told the crew anything.

571
00:31:26,911 --> 00:31:28,258
I will not take that chance.

572
00:31:28,318 --> 00:31:30,530
We may have already been delivered
like rats to the trap.

573
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,139
If we have been compromised, Ziva...

574
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,078
Our contingency plan...

575
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,168
Was to...

576
00:31:55,918 --> 00:31:56,872
take everyone.

577
00:32:19,664 --> 00:32:21,230
Idiot, hold your fire.

578
00:32:21,428 --> 00:32:23,024
Numas, I thought you were them.

579
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:25,443
Who, the Mossad
that you let on board?

580
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:49,300
You should keep your distance.

581
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:53,498
The ones who get too close...

582
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:54,965
always end up dead.

583
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:02,697
She knew that Cryer was a Marine.

584
00:33:02,944 --> 00:33:05,232
Doesn't matter if he changed his name
and become a mercenary,

585
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,984
that's it, she's done here.

586
00:33:07,754 --> 00:33:08,672
If it's true.

587
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:10,636
You want to give her
a chance to deny it?

588
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:13,741
She can't even speak on the subject.
On the record.

589
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,368
Malachi's more than willing.

590
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,371
All right.
Pass the baton.

591
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,872
You ready to play bad cop?

592
00:33:20,783 --> 00:33:22,908
You've been playing good cop
all this time, Leon?

593
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:26,467
Put them together.

594
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:35,971
Say nothing, Ziva.
I'm handling this.

595
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,430
I have nothing to say to you.

596
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,822
Just dropped Ziva in the lion's den.
Any second that door's going to open

597
00:33:47,882 --> 00:33:50,277
and Gibbs is going to ask us
what do we got. So what do we got?

598
00:33:50,474 --> 00:33:52,405
Abby and I are drowning
in ballistics.

599
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,479
We have no time
to process everything,

600
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:58,201
though we were able to nail the location
of the final battle and ID the players.

601
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,371
That's good.
Since Malachi told us exactly that.

602
00:34:00,853 --> 00:34:03,001
- Well, we can confirm it.
- Including the part

603
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:05,501
where he says Ziva killed the Marine?
We need something else.

604
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:09,120
Ducky's got something.
Ducky's got a folder.

605
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,425
Yes, and a growing sensation
in the bursa sac of my left knee.

606
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:13,979
Hence the elevator,

607
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:15,644
rather than the stairs,

608
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:17,263
- which would be...
- Ducky. Folder.

609
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,890
Yes. Well, all I have
is cause of death forms.

610
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:23,189
Multiple bodies
with nine-millimeter gunshot wounds.

611
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:26,825
An abundance with 5.7 by 28
in the chest and abdomen.

612
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,105
A single large-caliber
gunshot wound to the head.

613
00:34:30,165 --> 00:34:32,017
- That's Cryer.
- You found the slug?

614
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,667
We've got smashed .45 titanium-tipped
hollow-point slugs that were recovered

615
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:38,200
- from the maintenance bay.
- And the one that killed Cryer?

616
00:34:38,438 --> 00:34:40,453
I hate these words.
Lost at sea.

617
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:42,121
How many .45 slugs do we have?

618
00:34:42,695 --> 00:34:43,512
Three.

619
00:34:45,844 --> 00:34:47,201
But they're all smushed.

620
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:49,909
Any organic matter
on those three slugs?

621
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:52,631
- Residue of human tissue or blood?
- Negative.

622
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:53,832
I got that far.

623
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:57,970
- Then they were misses.
- Total misses.

624
00:34:58,235 --> 00:34:59,180
At close range.

625
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,973
Doesn't sound like the Ziva I know.

626
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:02,933
Does it sound like Ben-Gidon?

627
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,392
Not unless something threw
his shot off.

628
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:08,439
How quick can you get me
an unsmushed .45 slug?

629
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,798
- Hey, boss.
- What have you got?

630
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:21,335
- We're going to leave now.
- You're half right, half wrong.

631
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:23,155
- My patience is at...
- Sit down!

632
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:26,123
Shut up! There something wrong
with your shoulder?

633
00:35:26,598 --> 00:35:27,792
Broken clavicle.

634
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:31,569
Slow to heal.

635
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:36,801
You, too. Sit down.

636
00:35:42,669 --> 00:35:44,201
He says you killed Cryer.

637
00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:48,231
- Of course she is gonna deny it.
- Shut up!

638
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,689
Both of you are done telling stories.
It's my turn.

639
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:56,362
Put it down!

640
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:57,907
You put it down.

641
00:35:58,883 --> 00:36:00,241
I do not want to kill you.

642
00:36:00,734 --> 00:36:02,785
That's good.
'cause I do not want to die.

643
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:05,666
Did you betray us?

644
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:08,875
If I had,

645
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:12,086
what would stop me
from pulling the trigger right now?

646
00:36:30,296 --> 00:36:32,167
- This is your story?
- No, it's the truth.

647
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,858
Those are your misses on the wall.

648
00:36:34,638 --> 00:36:36,061
Gives you the smoking gun.

649
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:38,027
This is the kill shot.

650
00:36:38,252 --> 00:36:41,115
The slug you put in
United States Marine Daniel Cryer.

651
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:49,381
This is the way your boss operates?

652
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:52,130
Sends you to try to burn her?

653
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:53,969
She's on my team.

654
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:55,811
Didn't say you were happy about it.

655
00:36:58,598 --> 00:36:59,679
Are you...

656
00:37:01,025 --> 00:37:02,139
following orders?

657
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:10,688
Your father, Ziva.

658
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:13,474
He's not a good guy.

659
00:37:15,112 --> 00:37:16,112
He's dirty.

660
00:37:19,824 --> 00:37:21,322
You could not say no to him.

661
00:37:24,362 --> 00:37:25,453
Not a second time.

662
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:26,872
Go.

663
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:28,954
Get out of here. Run!

664
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,988
You tell Eli David to stay away.
She's off-limits.

665
00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:39,792
I failed you, Ziva.

666
00:37:41,374 --> 00:37:42,259
I'm sorry.

667
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:44,164
Never apologize.

668
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:46,611
It's a sign of weakness.

669
00:38:00,307 --> 00:38:01,487
Shut it down.

670
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:16,740
We're not done.

671
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,091
Finish it.

672
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:21,612
You know everything that happened.

673
00:38:22,615 --> 00:38:23,865
After the ship.

674
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,597
After you scuttled it.

675
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,103
Made it to land.

676
00:38:29,252 --> 00:38:30,354
We had a mission.

677
00:38:32,617 --> 00:38:33,775
He wanted it done.

678
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:35,618
Your father.

679
00:38:37,754 --> 00:38:38,735
At any cost.

680
00:38:45,915 --> 00:38:47,294
Don't bury it, Ziva.

681
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,014
Understood, Director.

682
00:38:59,194 --> 00:39:00,658
What did my father say?

683
00:39:02,095 --> 00:39:03,243
To proceed.

684
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:07,251
We are to follow the courier
to Saleem and kill him.

685
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:10,009
Did you tell him Aviv is dead
and you, too, are wounded?

686
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,936
He thinks this is
the best chance we have.

687
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,478
Then we have nothing.

688
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:19,844
- Who was Shalev calling?
- It doesn't matter.

689
00:39:21,697 --> 00:39:23,594
He was a leak
that needed to be plugged.

690
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:26,780
- No one could know we were coming.
- And no one does.

691
00:39:28,305 --> 00:39:30,048
- I will go alone.
- Forget it.

692
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:32,870
- We cannot disobey a direct order.
- Ziva, it is suicide.

693
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:34,586
It is what it is!

694
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:41,433
Good-bye.

695
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:56,558
It was...

696
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,350
my choice.

697
00:40:04,707 --> 00:40:06,164
I killed the courier...

698
00:40:06,873 --> 00:40:07,873
and his gunman...

699
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:12,157
after I forced them
to take me to Saleem's camp.

700
00:40:13,436 --> 00:40:15,532
I fought my way
through his defenses.

701
00:40:15,592 --> 00:40:16,613
I got within...

702
00:40:17,172 --> 00:40:18,707
a fingernail...

703
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,558
of Saleem before I was...

704
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,665
overpowered.

705
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,630
I had nothing but death in my heart.

706
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,391
You never had a choice.

707
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,222
He didn't give you a choice.

708
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:44,801
He raised you to be
a ruthless, soulless...

709
00:40:45,474 --> 00:40:46,224
killer.

710
00:40:49,028 --> 00:40:51,028
I did not mean to live through it.

711
00:40:52,278 --> 00:40:54,922
You didn't.
That part of you died out there.

712
00:40:58,495 --> 00:41:00,391
I am... sorry.

713
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:29,916
- I'm not happy about it either, Eli.
<i>- Self-serving, manipulative...</i>

714
00:41:29,976 --> 00:41:31,494
Gibbs is an awful son of a bitch.

715
00:41:31,554 --> 00:41:33,977
You might think he's a thorn
in your side, he's a pain in my ass.

716
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:36,294
<i>He is a thief, stealing my daughter.</i>

717
00:41:36,354 --> 00:41:38,535
I know, I know you're upset,
I know she's your daughter.

718
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:40,774
- <i>My flesh and blood...</i>
- I will continue to deal with it

719
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:41,877
but you have to...

720
00:41:42,271 --> 00:41:44,576
You have to believe
I am your ally here.

721
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:45,609
<i>Then show me.</i>

722
00:41:46,106 --> 00:41:47,473
I will deal with Gibbs,

723
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:50,595
- but she has chosen to deal with him.
<i>- Let the issue rest for the moment.</i>

724
00:41:50,655 --> 00:41:53,096
<i>This is not the last conversation
we'll have on the subject.</i>

725
00:41:53,156 --> 00:41:54,156
Shalom, Eli.

726
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,892
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

727
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,913
How'd you come up with the idea
to bluff the slug so quickly?

728
00:42:14,973 --> 00:42:17,145
- That's how I think, quickly.
- No.

729
00:42:17,205 --> 00:42:18,618
You already had the idea.

730
00:42:18,678 --> 00:42:21,205
You created the virus
on my computer.

731
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:23,974
So, you can accept the fact
that I can create a virus,

732
00:42:24,034 --> 00:42:26,919
but not that I can get rid of one?
And that makes sense to you.

733
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:29,503
- You brought in a ringer.
- Well, that's interesting.

734
00:42:29,785 --> 00:42:31,726
That would've been one way
for me to win the bet.

735
00:42:31,786 --> 00:42:32,895
Now, do my work.

736
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:34,468
You didn't win.

737
00:42:34,828 --> 00:42:36,880
The bet was
who could remove the virus faster.

738
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,014
You or I, not a third person.

739
00:42:39,436 --> 00:42:43,241
You violated the terms of the wager.
Therefore, I win and you do my work.

740
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:46,647
- I'm not doing it.
- Well, I'm not doing it either.

741
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:53,820
Get to work...

742
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:56,991
Probie.

743
