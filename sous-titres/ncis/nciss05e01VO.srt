00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:04,727
Where the hell is DiNozzo?

3
00:00:04,823 --> 00:00:06,386
Find him now!

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,639
I love you, Jeanne.

5
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:16,138
You're very resourceful, Kort.

6
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:17,368
I try.

7
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:18,526
Trent Kort.

8
00:00:18,623 --> 00:00:21,077
He's on the FBI arms dealer watch list.

9
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:23,447
- Believed to have recently join...
- La Grenouille.

10
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:26,063
Your favorite international
arms dealer and mine.

11
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:28,140
- This is good.
- And it's bad.

12
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:29,614
I had to lie to Gibbs.

13
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:30,848
You leave him to me.

14
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:32,852
What were you doing out here alone?

15
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:35,108
I can take care of myself, Jethro.

16
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:39,101
- FBI being polygraphed?
- No.

17
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:41,675
This net is being cast
strictly over NCIS.

18
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:43,112
Who are they after, Tobias?

19
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:44,227
Your boss.

20
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:46,828
So you're the overzealous Fed who nearly

21
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:49,752
mucked up 18 months of undercover work.

22
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,048
I prefer to think of it as doing my job.

23
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,084
Is she hot after all arms dealers

24
00:00:54,142 --> 00:00:56,548
or is there something
about this one in particular?

25
00:00:56,644 --> 00:00:58,991
How far are you willing
to go to get this guy, Jen?

26
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,434
As far as you went to get Ari.

27
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:02,752
I know what you're hiding from.

28
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:05,672
It's not just me that I'm
worrying about hurting, Ziva.

29
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:09,355
You okay?

30
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:10,701
Who's this?

31
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:13,399
Director's father,
Colonel Jasper Shepherd.

32
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:15,525
He committed suicide 12 years ago.

33
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:18,780
<i>No, he stood where you stand...</i>

34
00:01:18,822 --> 00:01:20,501
<i>three weeks ago.</i>

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,438
I want to know whose
fingerprints are on these.

36
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:25,328
Chain of evidence is not important.

37
00:01:25,364 --> 00:01:27,943
- You have children?
- Sadly, no.

38
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,024
I have three.

39
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:30,535
What's this?

40
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:32,911
My secret.

41
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,537
Welcome to the family.

42
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,516
Professor DiNardo.

My father knows everything about you.

50
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:13,490
- Only what my daughter tells me.
- And I tell him everything.

51
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:16,468
That's great.

52
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:17,747
So...

53
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:21,950
here we all are
on our way to, um...

54
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:23,823
Where exactly are we headed?

55
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:26,211
I don't know.
Breakfast?

56
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:29,723
A chance for us to get
to know each other.

57
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,117
I'm sure you've lots of questions.

58
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:34,155
I know I do.

59
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,788
My apartment first, Papa.

60
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,898
You wouldn't believe the night
we've had. It was very frightening.

61
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:43,287
Yes, your daughter is very impressive
with a scalpel, Mr. Benoit.

62
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:44,584
Please, Rene.

63
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,439
You never told me you could shoot.

64
00:03:47,513 --> 00:03:50,035
Well, I can't,
clearly.

65
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:52,069
- I missed.
- On purpose.

66
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,144
There was a shooting at the hospital?

67
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:56,116
It's a long story, Rene.

68
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:58,488
We have all weekend.

69
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:01,821
Well, it's really more of
Jeanne's long story than mine.

70
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:05,429
There was this crazy young guy

71
00:04:05,473 --> 00:04:08,749
who tried to smuggle heroin into
the country and he got hit by a car.

72
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:11,105
One of the bags in
his stomach burst, but

73
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,980
we didn't know until it
was too late, and then...

74
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:21,078
I forgot to sign the death
certificate to release the body.

75
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:22,785
Sorry, Papa.

76
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,395
Henri,
back to the hospital.

77
00:04:25,452 --> 00:04:26,452
Yes, sir.

78
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,315
Well,
I guess breakfast is gonna have to wait.

79
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,336
And all those intriguing questions.

80
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:40,392
What are you doing here?

81
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,632
I asked first.

82
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,846
Well, technically, Ziva, I think that
if we were to put that to the test,

83
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,635
you'd find that it was
too close to call.

84
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:50,840
But since my parents

85
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,328
raised a gentleman
and yours raised a killer,

86
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:55,933
I was defragging my computers.

87
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:57,951
Liar.

88
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:01,508
Have you heard from Tony?

89
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,488
You came into the office on a Saturday

90
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:05,262
morning because you're
worried about Tony?

91
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,742
You have been here all night.

92
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,006
Is that a question or a statement?

93
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:11,371
Question.

94
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:13,751
- Sounded more like a statement.
- Demands an answer.

95
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:16,218
Yes,
I was here all night.

96
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:18,363
Fragging the computers.

97
00:05:18,553 --> 00:05:19,553
Defragging.

98
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:21,257
You need to work on those inflections

99
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:23,506
when you're asking a question.
For example,

100
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,477
why are you worried about Tony?

101
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,333
Well, he was supposed to
meet us at the bar last night.

102
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,350
He did not arrive,
did not call.

103
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:35,128
He's not answering his home
phone or his cell phone.

104
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:38,461
Do you have the number
to his second cell phone?

105
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:40,626
- The one he uses for his private calls?
- Yes!

106
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:42,029
No.

107
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:46,296
Gibbs was here all night, too?

108
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:49,775
Are we a team, McGee?

109
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:51,335
Morning, Ziva.

110
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:53,558
Nothing better to do
on a Saturday morning?

111
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,534
Teams do not have secrets, Gibbs.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,917
And if you do not tell me what you
were both doing here last night...

113
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:03,389
McGee knows he will...

114
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:05,937
eventually.

115
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:14,763
- Won't be long.
- I can come with you if you want.

116
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:16,587
No need.
He won't bite.

117
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:19,362
Coffee?

118
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:21,358
Coffee would be great.

119
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:22,765
Good.

120
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,035
While we wait you can tell me how...

121
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:27,856
you stole my daughter's heart.

122
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:51,742
I'll get it!

123
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:53,092
I'll get it.

124
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:55,150
Director.

125
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:57,639
I'm sorry for keeping
you here all night, Abby.

126
00:06:57,669 --> 00:06:58,748
That's okay.

127
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:02,393
It's not the first time I've woken
up on the floor. Not just this floor.

128
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:05,520
Not that I make it a habit of
passing out on floors and not that

129
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,474
this is a really comfortable floor.
If I had to...

130
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:10,145
I'm awake now.

131
00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:19,797
Thanks, Abby.

132
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:20,870
You can go now.

133
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:22,101
Did we get a match?

134
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:25,976
No.

135
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:31,656
Poor guys.

136
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:34,701
Humming away all night and for nothing.

137
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,235
What search result?

138
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,610
This is not good.

139
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:48,043
Why would the CIA
come after the Director?

140
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:49,189
You tell me.

141
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:51,271
Protecting their asset.

142
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:52,685
La Grenouille.

143
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,485
Does the Director know?

144
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:55,498
Know what?

145
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:00,057
That it's Saturday and we're all

146
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,037
here on our day off
because we love our jobs.

147
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,473
Except for Tony who is missing.

148
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:07,658
McGee, I want you to
triangulate a cell number.

149
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:11,547
- Sure.
- 202-555-0177.

150
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,073
DiNozzo in trouble?

151
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,474
I knew it.

152
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:17,768
The woman Tony has been seeing,

153
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:19,548
Jeanne Benoit,

154
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,397
is La Grenouille's daughter.

155
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:25,458
He's been on assignment?

156
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:27,799
You did

157
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:30,002
plan to tell us at some point?

158
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:32,694
If it led us to her father, yes.

159
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:34,744
- Yeah, did it?
- I don't know.

160
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:37,550
You want to tell us what
you do know, Director?

161
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:41,588
Tony just contacted me
using his alias' cell.

162
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:45,256
It was a prearranged signal
used only in emergency

163
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:46,945
if he thought his cover had been blown.

164
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:48,026
Triangulating.

165
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:52,663
- Tony DiNardo.
- Cute.

166
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:55,999
I want this fed to MTAC and
I want satellite coverage.

167
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:57,148
On its way.

168
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:05,185
Merci beaucoup.

169
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,279
So,

170
00:09:11,504 --> 00:09:13,491
what did Jeanne tell you about me?

171
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:15,171
Oh, everything.

172
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:17,296
The world's greatest dad.

173
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:21,083
Children want to believe the best,
huh, of their parents.

174
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:24,418
I'm sure you believe your
father is a good man, hmm?

175
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:26,846
He was.

176
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,027
Still love has a way of blinding us, no?
Of the imperfections?

177
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:33,466
It's still love.

178
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:34,580
True.

179
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:36,969
And we both love Jeanne.

180
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,142
Yes, we do.

181
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:43,918
Are you going to break
my daughter's heart?

182
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:47,512
No, sir, not if I can help it.

183
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:49,762
Sometimes we lie to the people we love

184
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:52,313
in order to protect them.

185
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:54,211
You've lied to Jeanne?

186
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:56,176
Well, have you?

187
00:09:57,982 --> 00:09:58,982
Here she comes.

188
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:00,137
Done!

189
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,285
Now let's get out of here before
they remember something else.

190
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:06,238
- I have to move my car because...
- They'll tow you for sure.

191
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:07,653
They're murder around here.

192
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,023
We wouldn't want that.

193
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:10,772
Stay close.

194
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:12,978
Wouldn't want to lose you.

195
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,599
No chance of that.

196
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,407
He's on 22nd Street North West,

197
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,041
outside Monroe University Hospital.

198
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:24,595
He's on the move.

199
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:26,038
Must be in a car.

200
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,140
How long until we
get satellite coverage?

201
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:29,761
At least 15 minutes.

202
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:33,304
Or we could patch into
D. C.'s traffic-cam system.

203
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:35,585
See if we can locate him on
the traffic-cam management.

204
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:36,589
Do it.

205
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:39,798
- Anything?
- Still not answering.

206
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:41,536
Shall I try his undercover cell phone?

207
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,140
Put it on speaker.

208
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:51,604
<i>Hi. You've reached
Professor Tony DiNardo.</i>

209
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:53,917
<i>Leave a message and
I will get back to you.</i>

210
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:55,142
<i>I promise.</i>

211
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:59,758
His cover is teaching film
online at American University.

212
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:01,430
Tony a teacher?

213
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:04,001
No wonder he's been compromised.

214
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:05,486
Whose bright idea was that?

215
00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:06,924
Mine.

216
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:10,087
We're in.

217
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,142
Bring it up.

218
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:15,735
Got it.

219
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:18,324
I'm relaying the cell phone signal.

220
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,289
Tony's car.

221
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:29,504
Tony DiNardo's car.

222
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:31,047
How deep is this cover?

223
00:11:31,146 --> 00:11:32,760
Deep enough to withstand the sort of

224
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:35,251
scrutiny La Grenouille
can bring to bear.

225
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:36,576
You better hope so.

226
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:40,433
West on M Street.

227
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,906
No one else is in the car with him.

228
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:49,205
He's turning north onto 29th Street.

229
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,492
Traffic speed.
No signs of duress.

230
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,557
Cell phone's still off.

231
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:55,241
No one seems to be tailing him.

232
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:57,179
Maybe he's the one doing the tailing.

233
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,570
Still on 29th.

234
00:12:03,186 --> 00:12:04,324
Oh, my God.

235
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,094
Tony.

236
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:57,561
McGee.

237
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:00,958
McGee!

238
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:48,107
Hey.

239
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:54,621
That some sort of timer device?

240
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:58,465
Ten bucks at most electrical stores.

241
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:01,446
Probably activated when
the ignition turned on.

242
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:03,508
Counts down however long you need it to.

243
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:06,585
When it reaches zero...

244
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,487
Shockwave would've
killed him before the fire.

245
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:15,951
Death would've been instantaneous.

246
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:21,204
Small mercies, my dear boy.

247
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,120
Identification?

248
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:29,411
General build, height,
weight are about right.

249
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:31,398
Most of the

250
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:34,928
epidermis and dermis on the
hands and fingers have been

251
00:14:35,045 --> 00:14:37,326
burned off, so no fingerprints.

252
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,106
We'll need to get his

253
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:44,926
dental records for
positive identification.

254
00:14:46,415 --> 00:14:49,078
And is there any chance
that it's not Tony?

255
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:53,104
None that I can think of.

256
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,973
She blames herself.

257
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:02,997
Should she?

258
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,997
Let me know when you're finished, Duck.

259
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:16,661
You believe in miracles, Ziva?

260
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:18,442
Not part of my traing.

261
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,115
It might not be Tony.

262
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,579
Tony is not dead, Gibbs.

263
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:39,910
Not until Ducky says it's him.

264
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:41,892
Until then, he's just...

265
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:43,363
he's not here.

266
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:46,543
And I don't care what the evidence says.

267
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,657
Even if everything here belongs to Tony,

268
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:51,830
it's still not him until Ducky
says that it's him. And don't

269
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,629
try to tell me anything different
because I'm not gonna believe you.

270
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:59,169
Tell me it's not him, Gibbs.

271
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,414
Tell me it's not him.

272
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:08,578
I wish I could, Ab.

273
00:16:11,652 --> 00:16:13,446
I need to be alone right
now with the gang.

274
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:14,751
I've got work to do.

275
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:21,747
Abby...

276
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:26,416
How did these get here?

277
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:32,983
Director Shepard swore me to secrecy
when she brought those in and asked

278
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,258
me to run them for prints,
so I can't tell you.

279
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,323
Any other secrets you can't tell me?

280
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:43,161
No, just that one.

281
00:16:43,353 --> 00:16:46,645
Because when Director Shepard
said that there wasn't an AFIS match

282
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,888
and then tried to hide
the results from me,

283
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:52,678
she actually didn't swear me to secrecy.
So that is not a secret.

284
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:53,993
Who was the match?

285
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:55,941
Her father.

286
00:16:57,329 --> 00:16:58,418
Her father

287
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:00,512
has been dead for 12 years, Abby.

288
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:02,528
No, not according to AFIS.

289
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:08,999
That is a ten-point match, Gibbs.

290
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,462
These are new prints.

291
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:13,685
There's no way Director
Shepard's father is dead.

292
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,240
I buried my father, Jethro.

293
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:19,093
I know he's not coming back.

294
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:22,751
But someone is going
to great lengths trying

295
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:24,852
to convince me he's alive.

296
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,498
We've got a polygraph test Monday.

297
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:29,747
- Routine.
- They're targeting someone.

298
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,047
- Me?
- So I've been told.

299
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:35,469
I've never failed a polygraph,
I'm not about to start.

300
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:38,426
And if they ask you about your father?

301
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:40,245
He's dead.

302
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,384
Any doubt, any hesitation
will raise a red flag.

303
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:47,621
- There is no doubt.
- I saw his fingerprints.

304
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:48,759
My father's dead.

305
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:51,864
Subject displayed emotional
instability suggesting

306
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:55,125
delusional belief her father isn't dead.
Next question.

307
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:58,324
We just put her on medical
leave or we fire her?

308
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,521
Operation Lodestone.
You know it?

309
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:03,007
- Should I?
- Black op.

310
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:06,425
Focused on weapons control
and arms proliferation.

311
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,388
- Not one of ours.
- CIA.

312
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:10,138
My father's job

313
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:12,939
at the Pentagon was in the field
of arms control.

314
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:16,597
He was under investigation for
accepting a bribe when he was killed.

315
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:18,970
- Coroner said he took his own life.
- He was murdered.

316
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:20,419
- Proof?
- None.

317
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:22,100
But I know who's responsible.

318
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:24,515
The same guy you sent
one of my agents after.

319
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,829
One of my agents.

320
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:29,186
A deep undercover operation that

321
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:31,800
I ran on a need-to-know basis.

322
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:36,408
And, Jethro...

323
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:40,391
if you think I'm obsessed
with La Grenouille because of

324
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:42,280
what happened to my father,

325
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,943
you're wrong.

326
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:50,155
You may want to skip that
polygraph test Monday.

327
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,749
Must you keep doing that?

328
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:02,255
Just checking something Gibbs said.

329
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:05,200
Tony wouldn't have carried
it with him, you know?

330
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,871
His shield and ID,
not if he was undercover.

331
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:10,261
He would've

332
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,213
stashed it in the car,
maybe under the seat.

333
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:16,232
Just because we found his ID
doesn't mean it's Tony.

334
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:17,795
His car,

335
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:19,193
his ID,

336
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:20,727
his weapon...

337
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:22,391
both of his cell phones, McGee?

338
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:33,369
What was it that Gibbs said that
you thought need checking?

339
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,156
That he thought Tony
might be tailing someone.

340
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:42,023
Stop it there.

341
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,743
Take it back.

342
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:47,528
The limousine.

343
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,089
It was on the previous camera.

344
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:51,754
It's on every camera.

345
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:53,278
He was following the limousine.

346
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:55,209
Where is Gibbs?

347
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:00,645
Another shrapnel.

348
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,583
Lower left lobe.

349
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:09,620
Blood tests are back.

350
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,248
What type?

351
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:17,349
A- positive.

352
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:20,803
And Tony's?

353
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:25,231
A- positive.

354
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:31,481
Yes, well...

355
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,912
34 percent of the nation's population

356
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,937
share the same blood group.

357
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:41,095
So let's not go drawing any conclusions.

358
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:44,783
We'll await the dental records
before making positive ID.

359
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:47,020
In the meantime...

360
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:49,944
The lungs.

361
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:53,514
Penetrative shrapnel damage,

362
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:55,584
middle and lower left lobes.

363
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,984
Otherwise healthy tissue,
non-smoker, minimal scarring.

364
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,419
Minimal scarring.

365
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:05,394
Minimal scarring.

366
00:21:05,604 --> 00:21:07,377
I got that, Doctor.

367
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,492
Yes, but...
Mr. Palmer, how could he?

368
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,202
How could he what, sir?

369
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:16,119
Have minimal scarring

370
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:19,042
in both lungs?

371
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:20,209
Healthy living.

372
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,602
Yersinia pestis.

373
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:24,283
Y- pestis.

374
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:25,803
The pneumonic plague?

375
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,386
Yes, the plague, Mr. Palmer.

376
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:32,508
This man has never had the plague.

377
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:36,890
He's never had the plague.

378
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:39,031
Sohehas never had the plague.

379
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:42,302
He never had the damn plague!

380
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,184
The limousine is leased
to a shell company.

381
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,304
The parent company is EuroFreight.

382
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:51,016
Head office is in Luxembourg.

383
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:53,557
The principal behind the
company is Rene Benoit.

384
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,160
Tony could've been
following La Grenouille.

385
00:21:57,195 --> 00:21:59,607
I'm sorry to differ,
Timothy, but he wasn't.

386
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,619
Look, Tony contracted pneumonic plague,

387
00:22:03,678 --> 00:22:05,434
as I'm sure everyone can remember.

388
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:06,508
Before my time.

389
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:09,515
- He almost died.
- From severe pneumonia.

390
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,413
As a result, his lungs would've
been extensively scarred.

391
00:22:13,587 --> 00:22:16,386
Unlike the almost pristine lung

392
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:18,856
of the man currently in autopsy.

393
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,923
The body on which I am
performing an autopsy

394
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:25,392
is not Tony's.

395
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:28,912
If it's not Tony...

396
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:31,033
Then who is it?

397
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:32,883
And where is DiNozzo?

398
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:41,206
I want to know every thing
of this compagny.

399
00:22:41,515 --> 00:22:44,332
Banks, statement,
telephone, records personal.

400
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,927
Hard drive's spinning up now.

401
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:47,091
Everything, Tim.

402
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,168
If La Grenouille is in DC,
this could lead us to him.

403
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:51,268
Or DiNozzo.

404
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:54,080
Well, obviously,
DiNozzo is our first priority.

405
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,743
Start with the hospital. Find out
when DiNozzo left and with who.

406
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:59,110
And who was driving his car. Got it.

407
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:01,462
Director Shepard.

408
00:23:01,928 --> 00:23:03,336
Mr. Kort.

409
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,629
An unannounced visit by the CIA

410
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,497
usually means someone's in trouble.

411
00:23:08,606 --> 00:23:09,976
I trust it isn't you.

412
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,050
Where is he?

413
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:15,411
It depends on who "he" is.

414
00:23:15,465 --> 00:23:16,465
DiNozzo.

415
00:23:16,547 --> 00:23:20,240
I honestly don't know,
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you

416
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,432
until you explained to me why
you're looking for him so urgently.

417
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:27,444
La Grenouille
flew to DC this morning.

418
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:29,273
He didn't arrive at his
safe house and his

419
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:31,492
satellite phone has
stopped transmitting.

420
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:34,254
Mislaid your arms dealer...
that's got to be embarrassing.

421
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,286
I don't know what NCIS is up to,

422
00:23:37,325 --> 00:23:40,065
but I want a private
briefing in your office now.

423
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:44,424
I'll decide what briefing you get,
and where you get it, Mr. Kort.

424
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:46,228
And if you have a problem with that,

425
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:48,804
why don't you have your
director give me a call.

426
00:23:49,287 --> 00:23:52,559
You're jeopardizing one of
the most important long-term

427
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,484
covert operations the agency
has ever conducted.

428
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:56,906
Operation Lodestone.

429
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,159
You're not read-in on Lodestone.

430
00:24:00,217 --> 00:24:01,491
Okay, so read us in.

431
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:04,292
Unless the CIA just believes
in one-way traffic.

432
00:24:05,385 --> 00:24:07,385
This is not going to end well for you.

433
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:14,252
Special Agent DiNozzo's car was bombed
this morning,

434
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,843
but I guess you knew that.

435
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,900
He wasn't in it.

436
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:20,696
Thanks for sharing.

437
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:23,243
The Agency had nothing to do with it.

438
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:26,425
Is that when you mislaid your Frog
in all that confusion?

439
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,637
My car blew up this morning.
Did you do that?

440
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:36,921
Where did you go with La Grenouille?

441
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:50,311
Actually, he prefers Rene.

442
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,974
Arms dealers get very touchy
about their code names.

443
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:55,561
The Frog has a kind
of slimy overtone to it.

444
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:57,481
You should keep that in mind
for next time.

445
00:24:57,588 --> 00:24:59,339
You could use it yourself.

446
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:02,217
We will find him, DiNozzo.

447
00:25:03,162 --> 00:25:04,744
You might want to take the stairs.

448
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:06,882
I have a little upset tummy
this morning.

449
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:10,740
Happy Frog hunting.

450
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:13,397
What?

451
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:14,644
No balloons?

452
00:25:19,244 --> 00:25:20,568
That was more exciting live.

453
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:24,819
You saw it? You were there?

454
00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:26,012
Saw it...

455
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,319
heard it,

456
00:25:27,858 --> 00:25:28,858
felt it.

457
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:32,682
You can start whenever you're ready.

458
00:25:38,431 --> 00:25:41,595
He was waiting when I left the hospital
this morning with Jeanne.

459
00:25:42,795 --> 00:25:44,145
She'd arranged it.

460
00:25:44,894 --> 00:25:46,881
It was her little surprise, I guess.

461
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:48,406
"Meet the parents"...

462
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,644
part two.

463
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:53,418
I hate sequels.

464
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:56,795
Figured my cover was blown
as soon as I saw him.

465
00:25:57,145 --> 00:25:59,296
Turned out he'd known for months.

466
00:25:59,955 --> 00:26:00,955
Probably.

467
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:03,249
I tried talking my way out of it.

468
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:05,410
<i>Made it as far as my car.</i>

469
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:08,455
<i>Crap.</i>

470
00:26:08,752 --> 00:26:10,903
<i>There's no need to take your car.</i>

471
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,510
<i>Henri will drive it.</i>

472
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:14,708
<i>You come with Jeanne and me.</i>

473
00:26:14,711 --> 00:26:16,582
<i>That's really nice of you.</i>

474
00:26:16,988 --> 00:26:18,759
<i>I got to go. I really...</i>

475
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,421
<i>- I need to go home, change because...
- I will have to insist...</i>

476
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:23,602
<i>Agent DiNozzo.</i>

477
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,174
<i>Careful in second,
it tends to stick a little.</i>

478
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:30,795
<i>And your cell phone.</i>

479
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:34,154
<i>Both of them.</i>

480
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,967
Did La Grenouille tell Jeanne
who you were?

481
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:43,349
They didn't miss a beat.

482
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,328
Pretended everything was fine.

483
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,597
That didn't last long.

484
00:26:48,071 --> 00:26:51,003
I could see his guy
driving my car a few...

485
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:53,569
car lengths behind us, when...

486
00:26:58,673 --> 00:27:00,878
<i>Stay down!
Allez! Allez!</i>

487
00:27:03,096 --> 00:27:05,238
What was La Grenouille's first reaction?

488
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:08,007
That he was the target.

489
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:10,606
I'm not so sure.

490
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:12,592
You think it was you?

491
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:13,789
It was my car, boss.

492
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:17,204
And we have certainly pissed off
the Agency a lot lately.

493
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:21,095
The Director and I have pissed off
the Agency a lot lately.

494
00:27:21,134 --> 00:27:22,388
Although, mainly me.

495
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:25,744
For what it's worth,
Kort denied Agency involvement.

496
00:27:26,107 --> 00:27:29,097
That's because Kort doesn't play
by agency rules.

497
00:27:29,435 --> 00:27:30,750
Guy's got a hair trigger.

498
00:27:31,245 --> 00:27:32,981
Where did La Grenouille take you?

499
00:27:34,223 --> 00:27:36,230
Kind of blew away the breakfast plans.

500
00:27:37,236 --> 00:27:38,986
Blew away a lot of things.

501
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:42,544
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

502
00:27:42,664 --> 00:27:45,874
You never really thought it could end
any other way, did you?

503
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:49,585
You mean other than badly?

504
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:51,504
You're not supposed to fall in love
with them.

505
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:53,269
Thank you so much for that, Director.

506
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,198
I'm going to keep that in mind
for next time.

507
00:27:55,393 --> 00:27:58,073
Wait a second...
there's not going to be a next time.

508
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,584
What did Jeanne say?

509
00:28:02,568 --> 00:28:04,518
Nothing I'm going to tell you.

510
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:06,846
Nothing you need to know, Director.

511
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:16,839
- Where is La Grenouille?
- I don't know.

512
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:19,550
He dropped me off at the main gate.

513
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:20,669
Drove west.

514
00:28:20,728 --> 00:28:23,162
Probably heading to California.
He was driving pretty fast.

515
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,762
He could even be there now.

516
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,689
Talked about his future.

517
00:28:29,683 --> 00:28:30,956
Yeah? About what?

518
00:28:32,062 --> 00:28:33,400
Doesn't think he has one.

519
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:35,606
- He probably doesn't.
- He wants out.

520
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:37,019
Kort knows.

521
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:39,550
It would explain
why he's so desperate to find him.

522
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,536
The CIA's about to lose one of its...

523
00:28:41,826 --> 00:28:43,351
most prized assets.

524
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:45,495
What exactly does he mean by "out"?

525
00:28:45,816 --> 00:28:48,640
Well, he's going to call
and arrange a meeting

526
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,280
and give himself up.

527
00:28:50,932 --> 00:28:54,231
Because he says NCIS is
the only agency he trusts.

528
00:28:57,607 --> 00:28:58,607
What time?

529
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:01,119
Did she say how long she would be gone?

530
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:04,653
No, no, I understand.

531
00:29:04,971 --> 00:29:05,971
Thank you.

532
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,064
What was that for?

533
00:29:10,421 --> 00:29:11,961
Believing I was dead.

534
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,838
I never believed that you were dead.

535
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,610
Ziva was the one that gave up on you.

536
00:29:17,076 --> 00:29:19,426
Don't even think about the head slap.

537
00:29:19,797 --> 00:29:21,717
Is everything cool with
the Director and Gibbs?

538
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,130
Beyond cool.

539
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:24,192
Almost icy.

540
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:26,064
You seem anxious.

541
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:28,872
I'm fine.

542
00:29:30,414 --> 00:29:31,865
Anyone call for me?

543
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,139
If you're calling the hospital,
she's not there.

544
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,214
She called the ER to let them know
she was going away for a few days.

545
00:29:40,854 --> 00:29:41,854
Going where?

546
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:43,755
She did not tell them.

547
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,390
She knows?

548
00:29:49,744 --> 00:29:50,774
She knows.

549
00:29:53,004 --> 00:29:54,334
What are you going to do?

550
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:57,261
I am going to wait until the morning
and then talk to her.

551
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:01,022
I knew you'd be all right!

552
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,991
Everybody else gave you up for dead,
even Ziva.

553
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,502
so I may have acted a little hastily.

554
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:12,151
- That's my letter opener.
- Excellent balance and weight.

555
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:15,354
The edge is a little dull,
but I have always admired it.

556
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:20,776
Where's my American Pie coffee mug?

557
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,076
Mighty Mouse stapler?

558
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,220
My dear fellow,

559
00:30:31,452 --> 00:30:33,748
I never believed it for a moment.

560
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:36,021
Welcome home.

561
00:30:36,777 --> 00:30:38,629
It's not every day people think
you're dead.

562
00:30:40,513 --> 00:30:41,920
I know who blew up Tony's car.

563
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,624
Not Tony's car, but his alias' car.

564
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:46,263
And not exactly who,
but more like how and why.

565
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:47,747
Do you have a motive?

566
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:48,870
Me? No.

567
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:50,679
But they do.

568
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:53,378
Every bomb maker has a signature.

569
00:30:53,802 --> 00:30:55,457
The components, the way it's assembled.

570
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:58,390
Sometimes right down to the color tape
they use to bind it all together.

571
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,017
In this case, the components are common
to at least nine other bombs

572
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:03,754
that have gone off
in the last four years.

573
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:05,868
I made the match on Interpol.

574
00:31:06,152 --> 00:31:08,409
The bombs have gone off
all over the world.

575
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:10,202
Algeria, Indonesia,

576
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:11,978
the Middle East, Chechnya.

577
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:13,386
Anything linking the victims?

578
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:14,775
They were all arms dealers.

579
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,972
The only problem is,
Tony's not an arms dealer.

580
00:31:17,146 --> 00:31:18,959
His girlfriend's father's
an arms dealer.

581
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:20,502
She's been working nights.

582
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:23,122
I pick her up every morning
for breakfast.

583
00:31:23,242 --> 00:31:24,377
You parked the car...

584
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:25,880
they strap on the bomb,

585
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:27,367
set the timer...

586
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,563
and walk away.

587
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,295
You weren't the target, she was.

588
00:31:30,415 --> 00:31:31,476
Maybe she still is.

589
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:32,711
Take Ziva.

590
00:31:35,438 --> 00:31:36,238
Good.

591
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,731
Hello.

592
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:45,075
<i>Good evening, Madam Director.</i>

593
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,212
Good evening.

594
00:31:49,887 --> 00:31:51,450
I've been told you want to meet me.

595
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:53,954
i>Long overdue...

596
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:55,887
<i>I'm sure.</i>

597
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:58,763
Just tell me where and when.

598
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:02,073
Now...

599
00:32:03,684 --> 00:32:04,707
in your study.

600
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:11,763
Hello Jenny.

601
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:33,036
So here we are at last.

602
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,466
Face to face.

603
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:40,080
Not quite the way I expected to meet.

604
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:41,800
Nor I.

605
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:45,926
I must compliment you on your pursuit.

606
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:48,183
I actually liked your agent...

607
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,116
DiNozzo.

608
00:32:51,546 --> 00:32:52,703
So does your daughter.

609
00:32:54,162 --> 00:32:55,898
Very much. Yes.

610
00:32:57,414 --> 00:32:58,729
What do you want from us?

611
00:32:59,473 --> 00:33:02,355
Well, sanctuary, asylum,
call it what you will.

612
00:33:03,964 --> 00:33:08,016
In return for my extensive knowledge
of the arms market, I want protection...

613
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,780
for my daughter.

614
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:11,966
Protection from whom?

615
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,416
Whoever tried to kill
his daughter this morning.

616
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:20,802
Agent Gibbs, I believe.

617
00:33:22,185 --> 00:33:23,185
Well, it's true.

618
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,433
My enemies come for my daughter,
they will see me suffer.

619
00:33:27,064 --> 00:33:28,068
She is safe.

620
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:31,622
For the time being.

621
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:33,046
Which enemies?

622
00:33:34,357 --> 00:33:35,357
I have many.

623
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:37,913
Why now?

624
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:40,770
This have something to do
with Operation Lodestone?

625
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,699
He's well-informed.

626
00:33:42,911 --> 00:33:43,911
Read us in.

627
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,155
On what?

628
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:47,936
The arrogance of the CIA?

629
00:33:48,082 --> 00:33:49,082
To do what?

630
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:51,332
Make me the biggest arms dealer
in the world?

631
00:33:52,393 --> 00:33:55,511
You control the illegal arms trade.
The CIA controls you.

632
00:33:56,264 --> 00:33:57,266
That was the idea

633
00:33:58,193 --> 00:33:59,720
till you came along.

634
00:33:59,775 --> 00:34:00,952
And someone found out.

635
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:04,170
Another arme dealer.

636
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,459
Perhaps.

637
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:09,243
And I'm running out of time.

638
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:12,118
I can no longer trust Kort.

639
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,134
Did you ever?

640
00:34:18,362 --> 00:34:20,648
This isn't the first time
you were in this study.

641
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,824
I met your father here on occasion...

642
00:34:29,274 --> 00:34:30,335
many years ago.

643
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,547
Tell me about him.

644
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:39,101
He was a fine man.

645
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:40,836
He had a conscience.

646
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:42,892
One day,

647
00:34:44,073 --> 00:34:45,482
it got the better of him.

648
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:50,663
You believe the story
that my father took a bribe

649
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:53,190
while overseeing
an arms reduction treaty?

650
00:34:53,415 --> 00:34:55,274
Sadly, that's not a story.
That's fact.

651
00:34:55,724 --> 00:34:56,724
How do you know?

652
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,036
Because I paid him that bribe.

653
00:35:07,945 --> 00:35:08,986
You killed him

654
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,726
because he wouldn't take it.

655
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:17,163
I can understand how hard it is

656
00:35:17,508 --> 00:35:18,512
to accept.

657
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,195
My daughter is...

658
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,259
She's facing the same...

659
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:25,224
same struggle.

660
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:28,673
It's not loaded.

661
00:35:29,607 --> 00:35:31,148
I guess he beat you to it.

662
00:35:34,273 --> 00:35:36,940
I didn't want you to do anything rash
before I had a chance to...

663
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:38,919
explain myself.

664
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:41,862
I need your protection.

665
00:35:44,301 --> 00:35:45,821
You have the bullets.

666
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,291
Take the damn gun!

667
00:35:47,577 --> 00:35:48,911
Protect yourself.

668
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:51,921
You are signing my death warrant.

669
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,988
12 years overdue.

670
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:00,623
Here's my number.

671
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,421
In case you change your mind.

672
00:36:03,749 --> 00:36:05,328
You better leave before I do.

673
00:36:13,224 --> 00:36:16,303
I hope my daughter is
as loyal to her father

674
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:18,913
as you are to yours.

675
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,783
You just let your own personal obsession
get in the way

676
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:32,756
of your professional responsibility.

677
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,546
That's a lot of crap, and you know it.

678
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,380
There are no deals for men like him.

679
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:40,680
You want to chase after him right now
and arrest him without a warrant,

680
00:36:40,737 --> 00:36:43,708
you go right ahead, but we both know
that Kort will have him out

681
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:45,598
- before breakfast.
- Then get a damn warrant!

682
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:46,910
You get a warrant.

683
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,017
But you'd better do it fast
before his friends get him first.

684
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:55,879
If the weapon was loaded,
and I wasn't here,

685
00:36:57,677 --> 00:36:59,828
would you have pulled the trigger?

686
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,081
I guess we'll never know.

687
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:26,422
On the table.

688
00:37:52,942 --> 00:37:54,659
You ever lie to someone you love?

689
00:37:59,019 --> 00:37:59,819
Yes.

690
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,020
They ever forgive you?

691
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:07,573
They never found out.

692
00:38:09,171 --> 00:38:10,171
Mine found out.

693
00:38:12,354 --> 00:38:13,354
He told her?

694
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:17,959
I did.

695
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:20,441
<i>I don't understand what's happening.</i>

696
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:22,909
<i>Tony, that was your car.</i>

697
00:38:22,954 --> 00:38:24,685
<i>Your car that just...</i>

698
00:38:24,878 --> 00:38:26,840
<i>It could have been you.
It should have been you.</i>

699
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,659
<i>Tell me that you love me.</i>

700
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:30,161
<i>Tell me.</i>

701
00:38:31,317 --> 00:38:33,551
<i>I do. It's just...
just everything that's happened...</i>

702
00:38:34,232 --> 00:38:35,274
<i>happened today.</i>

703
00:38:35,461 --> 00:38:37,236
<i>Last night, the way you handled things.</i>

704
00:38:37,296 --> 00:38:38,489
<i>The gun...
The gun.</i>

705
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,284
<i>Firing it the way you did.
And now this.</i>

706
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:42,381
<i>It's like you're someone else.
Someone else.</i>

707
00:38:42,423 --> 00:38:43,528
<i>Someone I don't know.</i>

708
00:38:44,706 --> 00:38:45,709
<i>What is it?</i>

709
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,200
<i>You are, aren't you?</i>

710
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,860
<i>Aren't you?
Someone else. Who?</i>

711
00:38:51,477 --> 00:38:52,477
<i>Who are you?</i>

712
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:57,480
<i>I'm a Federal Agent. My name isn't
Tony DiNardo. It's Anthony DiNozzo</i>

713
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,892
<i>and I work for the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.</i>

714
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,966
<i>This has all been a lie.
A lie.</i>

715
00:39:03,016 --> 00:39:05,339
<i>Jeanne, listen to me.
Not all of it. Not everything.</i>

716
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:07,288
<i>Just some things.
Not the important things.</i>

717
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:09,603
<i>Why? Just tell me
why it is you'd do this.</i>

718
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:11,322
<i>What it is I'm supposed to have done?</i>

719
00:39:11,928 --> 00:39:12,928
<i>Tell me.</i>

720
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:14,259
<i>Tell me.</i>

721
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:16,828
<i>It's not you.</i>

722
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:22,879
<i>What?</i>

723
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:26,729
<i>- What?
- You should ask him.</i>

724
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:42,077
He said she'd come back
after she calmed down.

725
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:43,183
I guess he was wrong.

726
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:46,249
I will put out a BOLO.

727
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,487
- We will find her.
- She doesn't want to be found.

728
00:40:03,952 --> 00:40:04,952
No luck?

729
00:40:05,476 --> 00:40:06,478
Not at home.

730
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,285
He has not replaced his cellphone yet.

731
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:10,730
- Maybe he took the day off.
- Gibbs would have told us.

732
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:12,789
Gibbs would have told you what?

733
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,193
If Tony was taking some time off.

734
00:40:16,524 --> 00:40:17,524
You're right.

735
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:20,476
There's always more work to be done
when you're a man down on the shift.

736
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:22,906
Think I've got something here, boss.

737
00:40:23,325 --> 00:40:25,570
I found another one
of La Grenouille's shell companies.

738
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:28,067
It's similar to the one that leased
the stretch limo,

739
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:31,056
only this one leases a yacht down
at the Gangplank Marina.

740
00:40:31,169 --> 00:40:33,021
- Called the Mauretania.
- How big?

741
00:40:33,716 --> 00:40:35,877
80 feet. Three staterooms.

742
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:37,509
Ziva checked with the marina management.

743
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,319
Someone's been staying there
since saturday.

744
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:41,847
Older guy with an accent.
They think he's French.

745
00:40:41,885 --> 00:40:43,931
- And a younger woman?
- No. He said he was alone.

746
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:45,991
- Warrant?
- Just arrived from legal.

747
00:40:46,002 --> 00:40:48,505
It is all in order, but they couldn't
guarantee it wouldn't stop

748
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:50,709
a concerted legal challenge
from the Agency.

749
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,388
Let them try.
Let's go.

750
00:41:34,843 --> 00:41:35,730
Clear!

751
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:37,507
Clear!

752
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:39,312
Clear!

753
00:41:42,496 --> 00:41:43,496
He's gone.

754
00:41:44,386 --> 00:41:45,647
Maybe he was never here.

755
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:49,689
He was here.

756
00:41:57,979 --> 00:41:59,634
We'll catch up with him eventually.

757
00:42:00,295 --> 00:42:01,295
Or someone will.

758
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:03,292
One day.

759
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:33,238
