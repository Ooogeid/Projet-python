<i>Shalom, Officer David.</i>

6
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:16,559
We need a forced extraction, now.

7
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:17,691
<i>Target?</i>

8
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:20,054
- Michael.
<i>- Rivkin?</i>

9
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,781
<i>- Have you notified your father?</i>
- I'm notifying you.

10
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:24,155
Who do we have in the area?

11
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:25,568
<i>- How bad?</i>
- Who do we have?

12
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:27,827
<i>- I will handle it.</i>
- He is at my apartment.

13
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:30,085
- I will make sure he stays there.
<i>- Someone will be sent.</i>

14
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:03,524
Oh, my God.

15
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:05,400
Come on, Michael.

16
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:11,156
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:15,702
Call an ambulance!

18
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,795
Now!

19
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:20,582
Stay with me.
Come on.

20
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:26,296
Come on!

25
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,160
Excuse me, Ms. David?

26
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,981
Yes.

27
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:34,431
I'm okay.

28
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:37,715
Got a fractured radius
and a couple of bruises, but...

29
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:40,830
I had new intel.

30
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:43,010
I went to talk to Ziva.

31
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:45,083
Question Ziva.

32
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:48,752
When I got there,
Rivkin attacked me.

33
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:49,921
And I had no choice.

34
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:54,300
It was justified.

35
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,277
Go write it up.

36
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,858
There's gonna have a lot
of people wanting answers.

37
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:02,684
Rivkin is dead.

38
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:03,852
Tony killed him.

39
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:07,522
- You saw it?
- I saw enough.

40
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,858
Ziva, you have
to tell me everything.

41
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:13,299
You'll have my I-A report
on your desk before lunch.

42
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,992
I'm sorry for your loss.

43
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:29,105
I can't believe I'm finally going
to get to see Ziva's new apartment.

44
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:35,508
Well, obviously, I wish it was
under better circumstances.

45
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,540
Though it is Ziva's place.

46
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:38,682
And...

47
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:40,555
she's Ziva.

48
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:42,056
So McGee,

49
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,308
Rivkin, Tony,

50
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:45,445
Ziva...

51
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,062
- what do you know?
- Nothing.

52
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:53,127
I saw Tony snooping
around Ziva's desk.

53
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:56,404
It was the day before
she went back to Tel Aviv.

54
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:57,902
He answered the phone.

55
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:00,199
I think he talked to Rivkin.

56
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:07,722
I can't believe I'm telling you this.
Tony's going to kill me.

57
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:09,459
Not if Mossad gets to him first.

58
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,794
You don't think the Director's
going to just hand him over.

59
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:16,966
Boss, Rivkin tried to kill him.

60
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,177
Tony's word against a dead guy's.

61
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:21,096
Yeah, but Ziva will back him, right?

62
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:23,348
Tony doesn't just murder people,
you know.

63
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:25,184
Obviously,
the shooting was self-defense.

64
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:26,392
All we've go to do...

65
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:50,083
- Got a problem, McGee?
- You mean apart from...

66
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:51,918
Tony killing Ziva's friend and

67
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:54,420
Ziva's apartment blowing up?
No, no problem at all.

68
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,630
Good. Then shoot.

69
00:05:09,752 --> 00:05:10,710
Laptop.

70
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:11,980
Kind of.

71
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,649
Floor underneath's
barely been touched.

72
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,769
It must have been there
when the fire started.

73
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,820
Under a drawer... a strange place
to keep a laptop.

74
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:20,405
Not if you're hiding it.

75
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:25,203
It gives a whole new meaning
to "fried hard drive", huh?

76
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,481
You know, "fried hard drive",
is a computer term.

77
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,882
Yeah, McGee, I got it.

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,045
Three cuts in the gas line.

79
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:39,267
The fire chief said it must have been
leaking for at least an hour.

80
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:40,675
No one smelled gas.

81
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:43,420
Which is odd, considering most
of the neighbors were home.

82
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,637
These look clean.

83
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,097
Looks like a pro job.

84
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:53,438
Boss, could be the trigger.

85
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:57,149
- Bag it.
- Yup.

86
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:29,974
Would you like a moment?

87
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:31,441
Not necessary.

88
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:33,209
While you're here,

89
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:36,272
perhaps you could shed
some light on Officer Rivkin's beliefs.

90
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:38,962
I've already contacted
a rabbi friend of mine

91
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:41,527
and asked him to be present
when I perform the autopsy.

92
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:43,171
Also not necessary.

93
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,907
Michael was Jewish by birth,
not practice.

94
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,045
Traditions can be a comfort.

95
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:52,914
Like the periods
of <i>aninut</i> and <i>avelut</i>.

96
00:06:53,117 --> 00:06:54,371
Ancient rites.

97
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:55,998
Very appropriate today.

98
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,384
They not only show
respect for the dead,

99
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:03,821
but they also bring a sense
of comfort to those who are left behind.

100
00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:06,328
Rituals only work
for those who need them.

101
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:19,565
I need you to run
a back-trace on a cell phone.

102
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:21,344
Sure, I just need the...

103
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:22,717
number.

104
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,952
Boss, this is Ziva's cell.

105
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:34,399
You already knew that.

106
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:36,017
Okay, back-trace on it.

107
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:03,359
- I know what you're going to say.
- No, I don't think you do.

108
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:17,039
I know you think I lied to you
about Rivkin, but I did not.

109
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,508
You asked me if I knew him.
You asked me if he worked for Mossad.

110
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:21,795
- Not if I was seeing him, not...
- Sit down.

111
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:30,970
Your apartment's been destroyed.

112
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:34,974
Gas fire... earlier this morning.

113
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:38,889
Perhaps the line was damaged
during the fight.

114
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:42,190
- I would talk to Tony.
- No, this was no accident.

115
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:45,568
The gas lines were cut.

116
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:47,987
- Any idea...?
- No.

117
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:52,415
- That was a quick answer.
- Simple question.

118
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:56,036
Ziva...

119
00:08:58,572 --> 00:08:59,582
that's your home.

120
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:01,651
No, it's not.

121
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,341
This is a thorough report.

122
00:09:09,137 --> 00:09:11,135
You only left out
a few little things.

123
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:13,010
Like why you broke protocol,

124
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,265
why you went alone
and why the hell didn't you inform me.

125
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,935
My gut told me that it was Rivkin,
not Ziva.

126
00:09:20,056 --> 00:09:21,393
And sometimes my gut...

127
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:23,940
just sucks.

128
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,093
But if Ziva knew something,
I wanted to give her the chance

129
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,612
to explain it to me.

130
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:31,364
You wanted to protect her.

131
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:33,574
If she needed it.

132
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:38,996
Tony's left radius was fractured
during this brawl.

133
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:42,776
But he and Officer Rivkin suffered
a whole assortment of other injuries.

134
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:44,126
All of them consistent...

135
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:46,298
with Tony's version of the story.

136
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:47,939
Tony told the truth.

137
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:53,626
This is good news, Jethro.

138
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:55,160
Doesn't add up.

139
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,858
DiNozzo's more a brawler.

140
00:09:58,415 --> 00:09:59,684
Rivkin was <i>Kidon</i>.

141
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:03,350
I thought you'd never ask.

142
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:12,196
Putting the "why" aside,
Agent DiNozzo,

143
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:14,782
I am curious
how you got out of there alive.

144
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,512
Well, I've always been a...

145
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:19,617
pretty decent fighter,
if I do say so myself.

146
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:20,814
Scrappy.

147
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:24,542
You telling me you offed
a Mossad assassin by being scrappy?

148
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:28,400
- What do you want from me, Director?
- Honesty in detail.

149
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,298
Well,
that is what I'm trying to do here.

150
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,983
And maybe you're right,
maybe Rivkin should have won.

151
00:10:33,872 --> 00:10:35,022
But he didn't.

152
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:38,014
He's dead and I'm not,
and I don't have a concrete reason why.

153
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:41,617
What's this?

154
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,219
Concrete.

155
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,104
Rivkin was hammered.

156
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:48,359
He might have had
a couple of cocktails, but,

157
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,820
I mean, he was doing
a pretty good job hammering me.

158
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,321
There's no way he was drunk.

159
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:55,906
Blood alcohol level was .16.

160
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:58,590
Twice the legal limit to drive.

161
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:05,703
- Maybe I should have called him a cab.
- You went off grid.

162
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,333
You killed an officer of the Mossad.

163
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:11,881
And to make things worse, the entire
crime scene has been blown to hell.

164
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:15,718
People are going to have some questions.
You'd better have some good answers.

165
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:21,682
Understood.

166
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:33,395
Think your boy can handle
the meat grinder that's coming?

167
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,246
He'll manage.

168
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:38,830
Good, because he's going to have
to step up, take one for the team.

169
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,535
What's the end game?

170
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,787
Diplomacy.

171
00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:48,334
<i>- Leon.</i>
- Eli.

172
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:49,954
Shalom, my friend.

173
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,810
Gives a whole new meaning
to "fried hard drive", huh?

174
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,636
How many times have you told
that joke today?

175
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,137
None.

176
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:02,639
Maybe once or twice.

177
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:05,214
Newsflash, McGee.
Now is not the time for ha-ha's, okay?

178
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:05,981
Sorry.

179
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,160
Somebody just tried
to kill Tony and Ziva.

180
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:10,259
Ziva's apartment was targeted.

181
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:11,816
Doesn't mean she was a target.

182
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,097
She could have been.
And what about Tony?

183
00:12:14,157 --> 00:12:15,694
- He almost died.
- He didn't.

184
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,779
He could have.

185
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,572
Sorry.

186
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:20,825
What have you got, McGee?

187
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,463
Rivkin's prints.

188
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:24,829
All over this laptop.
At least, what is left of it.

189
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,948
Were you able to get
any intel off the hard drive?

190
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:28,212
No, it's fried.

191
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,209
Sorry. Dead.

192
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:32,336
We may be able to partially retrieve

193
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,566
some of the lost data,
but it's going to take a while.

194
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:36,132
- Couple days.
- You got one.

195
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:37,675
Boss, that's not even...

196
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:41,804
That's a very reasonable request.

197
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,766
Major Mass Spec is
still processing that.

198
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,601
I was thinking it's probably a...

199
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:50,271
salami roll, wrapped in s'mores.

200
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:53,663
- Do you have a better idea?
- I do.

201
00:12:55,394 --> 00:12:57,903
I know I was told not to involve
myself in the investigation.

202
00:12:57,984 --> 00:12:59,124
Yet here you are.

203
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:01,002
Since it is my apartment,

204
00:13:01,062 --> 00:13:03,909
I thought I should at least take
a look at the crime scene photographs.

205
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,432
- No, not going to happen.
- Not a chance.

206
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:08,995
Perhaps I should have made
myself more clear.

207
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:11,041
I have already scanned
through the photos.

208
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:15,171
McGee left them running
on his computer.

209
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:20,343
That being said, I feel obliged

210
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,595
- to tell you what I have found.
- Talk.

211
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,040
That is actually
an activated charcoal filter

212
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,864
which has been doused
in ethanethiol.

213
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,272
We plant them on cut gas lines
to mask the smell.

214
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:35,232
A fire can be triggered
without warning.

215
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:36,066
We?

216
00:13:36,444 --> 00:13:38,527
It is a technique used
by many agencies.

217
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:41,614
Including Mossad.

218
00:13:48,183 --> 00:13:49,174
Pack your bags.

219
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:54,834
You and DiNozzo, too.

220
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:58,175
I've been asked a favor.
I've just decided to grant it.

221
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:00,784
We're on the next flight
to Tel Aviv.

222
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:02,319
Director Vance.

223
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:06,448
Director David will see you shortly.
He's anxious to speak with you.

224
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:08,156
As am I.

225
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:11,583
Officer David.

226
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:13,296
It's been far too long.

227
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:17,725
Thank you for coming.

228
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:20,138
There's no reason to thank me.

229
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:22,214
My visit has nothing to do with you.

230
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:25,933
Always full of fire.

231
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:29,054
Shall I introduce myself?

232
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:33,601
Officer Amit Hadar,

233
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,102
Special Agent Gibbs.

234
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:37,800
Special Agent DiNozzo.

235
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:40,202
Shalom.

236
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:41,859
Shalom.

237
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:43,819
Agent DiNozzo,

238
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:46,113
please, ride with me.

239
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:49,700
I insist.

240
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:54,455
It will allow us a chance
to get to know one another.

241
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,714
I am going to see him again,

242
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:04,995
right, Leon?

243
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:07,558
Officer Hadar will not harm him.

244
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:10,262
Only two people have
the authority to do that.

245
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:12,264
Your father is one. Second?

246
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:14,099
Me.

247
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,354
When did you start wearing
so much makeup?

248
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,064
Nice to see you, too.

249
00:17:04,243 --> 00:17:06,527
With traffic,
I wasn't expecting you for another hour.

250
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:07,809
I drove.

251
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:09,154
Enough said.

252
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:10,110
Sit.

253
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,658
Sit.

254
00:17:19,193 --> 00:17:20,416
So, tell me, how are you?

255
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:21,978
I have been better.

256
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,419
Michael was a good man.

257
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,543
- Loyal.
- Loyal to whom?

258
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,174
To all of us.

259
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,092
I'm not certain that is true.

260
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:32,761
You're angry.

261
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:35,806
I am confused.

262
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:38,183
That is why I asked you here.

263
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,160
- To find answers?
- No, my dear.

264
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,228
To find solace.

265
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:45,342
You leave finding the answers to me.

266
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:02,958
My daughter speaks
very highly of you.

267
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,060
- She's a good agent.
- Liaison officer.

268
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,423
She's one of us.

269
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,341
So she tells me.

270
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:14,957
So's the guy in there.

271
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:29,568
My sincere apologies for your wait.

272
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,774
That's okay.

273
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,238
I dig hanging out
in concrete bunkers.

274
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:37,267
Especially after 12-hour plane rides
in cramped quarters.

275
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,827
Your sarcasm is noted.

276
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:40,954
So's your shirt.

277
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:42,414
Nice style.
What is it?

278
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:44,106
Zegna? Cavalli?

279
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,292
You got good taste.

280
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:48,754
I'm not certain
how my apparel applies to your visit.

281
00:18:48,855 --> 00:18:51,339
And I am not certain
how you can classify my visit...

282
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:52,841
as a visit.

283
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:56,025
All right.

284
00:18:56,714 --> 00:18:58,180
Just so we understand,

285
00:18:58,425 --> 00:19:00,025
this is what I do for a living.

286
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:01,892
I interrogate people...

287
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:04,421
all day long.
So I know all the tricks of the trade.

288
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,528
And nothing that you do...

289
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:07,940
is going to intimidate me.

290
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:09,549
Interrogate?

291
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,194
This is an Assembly Room.
It's a place for mutual discussion.

292
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:20,869
You have yet to see
our Interrogation Room.

293
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:25,224
But if you continue with childish
arrogance, I promise that you will.

294
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:29,545
Son of a bitch.

295
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:33,257
How many times did I tell DiNozzo to
leave his smart-ass attitude back in DC?

296
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,259
You should have checked his bags.

297
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:36,844
You said your boy was up for this.

298
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:39,141
You're the one who threw him
to the wolves, Leon.

299
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:41,014
Let him fight his own way.

300
00:19:41,094 --> 00:19:43,475
You call this a fight?
He'd better start showing me something.

301
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:45,210
Taking one for the team?

302
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,647
He already has.

303
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:53,152
<i>No, Agent DiNozzo,
what you need to understand...</i>

304
00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:55,337
is that I am very aware
of who you are.

305
00:19:57,755 --> 00:19:58,868
Your achievements

306
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:00,552
and your misjudgments.

307
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:03,124
Stop right there.

308
00:20:03,722 --> 00:20:06,081
If this is about my "Twitter" page,
I just want to clarify.

309
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:08,230
I had a couple of cocktails, and,

310
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,252
what can I say?
Sometimes I get a little chatty.

311
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:13,338
Do you know who I am?

312
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,549
You're the Director of Mossad.

313
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:18,593
And Ziva's father.

314
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:21,096
Although I'm not sure
which one's asking the questions.

315
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:24,301
<i>Sometimes it is hard to separate.</i>

316
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,069
And it appears
that you have had difficulty

317
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:29,104
separating your work
from your emotions, as well.

318
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:34,276
You believed Officer Rivkin was bad?

319
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,612
He killed an American agent.

320
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:37,988
An accident.

321
00:20:38,294 --> 00:20:40,760
Unlike his death,
which was intentional.

322
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:46,521
But what...
was behind that intent?

323
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,796
Retribution...

324
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:52,463
for an agent you had never even met?

325
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:57,695
You knew that Officer Rivkin
would be at Ziva's apartment.

326
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:01,432
You went there to confront him,

327
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:04,042
to provoke him.

328
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:07,760
And once again,
you blurred the lines, Agent DiNozzo,

329
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,646
between your professional duty
and your personal desires.

330
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:14,872
You wanted Rivkin out
of my daughter's life,

331
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:16,193
so you killed him.

332
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:20,124
<i>Isn't that the truth, Agent DiNozzo?</i>

333
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:22,282
<i>It's like I told you Director.</i>

334
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:24,534
I went to Officer David's apartment,

335
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:27,371
at which time
Officer Rivkin attacked me.

336
00:21:29,494 --> 00:21:30,916
It was kill or be killed.

337
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:37,714
If that were true, my friend,

338
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,500
you would be dead.

339
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:42,177
You wouldn't mind that, would you?

340
00:21:42,408 --> 00:21:44,559
You send
all your rogue agents to DC?

341
00:21:45,026 --> 00:21:46,635
Make it our mess? Huh?

342
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:50,171
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
about Rivkin,

343
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:52,104
considering you did
the same thing with Ari,

344
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,592
and he was your son.

345
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,482
Speaking of family,

346
00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:57,022
what kind of a father would throw

347
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,360
an out-of-control assassin
at his own daughter?

348
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:01,905
What kind of business
are you running here, huh?

349
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:04,616
Everyone just runs around doing
whatever the hell they want?

350
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:06,725
They do as I say.

351
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,370
- Rivkin?
- Always.

352
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:23,969
Well, I'll be damned.

353
00:22:32,593 --> 00:22:33,453
Yeah. Gibbs.

354
00:22:33,513 --> 00:22:34,936
<i>Hey, boss. </i>How's Tel Aviv?

355
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:36,857
Forget Tel Aviv.
How's Tony? How's Ziva?

356
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:38,355
<i>Are they talking yet?</i>

357
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:39,638
They're fine, Abby.

358
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:42,320
I'll take that as a no.
<i>So, how is Israel?</i>

359
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,532
What? He said they're fine.
It's magical, right?

360
00:22:45,612 --> 00:22:48,031
<i>I mean, I've been wanting
to go there for years...</i>

361
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:50,245
<i>it's, like, third on my list.
The Galapagos Islands and,</i>

362
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:51,913
Dollywood. Gibbs?

363
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:53,662
The case, Abby.

364
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:54,875
McGee and I,

365
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:57,737
we've been working
on Rivkin's computer, and...

366
00:22:58,205 --> 00:22:59,629
we're doing fairly well.

367
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:04,004
<i>With a little luck,
I think we'll make our 24-hour deadline.</i>

368
00:23:04,064 --> 00:23:06,221
<i>Boss, I ran</i>
the back-trace on Ziva's cell.

369
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:07,846
<i>Most of the calls check out.</i>

370
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:08,875
Most?

371
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:11,600
<i>Well, she did make</i>
one call from her car two nights ago

372
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,143
to a highly encrypted phone,
Israeli registered.

373
00:23:14,224 --> 00:23:15,937
Call was placed just after midnight.

374
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:17,606
Six hours before the bombing.

375
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,359
<i>Which means either Ziva
really upset someone or...</i>

376
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:22,069
Don't say it.

377
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:26,031
- She was somehow involved.
- What'd I just say?

378
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:29,395
<i>I traced the Israeli phone.</i>

379
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,449
<i>- It's registered to...</i>
- Officer Amit Hadar.

380
00:23:42,283 --> 00:23:44,367
- Now talk.
- Ziva, what is this?

381
00:23:44,427 --> 00:23:46,642
- I said talk.
- You called me, remember?

382
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:49,458
To remove Rivkin from harm.

383
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:51,056
- Harm from whom?
- Himself.

384
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:53,683
- Circumstances had changed.
- And this was your answer?

385
00:23:53,863 --> 00:23:55,143
I protect the Mossad.

386
00:23:55,224 --> 00:23:56,603
There was nothing to protect!

387
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,524
- I should have known not to trust you.
- As if it was my decision.

388
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,942
You have my father's ear!

389
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:03,360
Rivkin was in chaos.

390
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,444
You knew.

391
00:24:05,115 --> 00:24:07,155
And yet you decided not
to tell your father.

392
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:10,625
You tried to protect Rivkin,
but in truth,

393
00:24:11,037 --> 00:24:12,494
you are the reason he's dead.

394
00:24:17,078 --> 00:24:18,750
Rivkin killed that American agent.

395
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:19,835
You knew this!

396
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:21,670
And still you did not report him!

397
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,672
I called you
and I told you to remove him!

398
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,631
Too late!

399
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:26,851
By then, we could not get him out
of the country.

400
00:24:27,206 --> 00:24:29,136
All we could do was clean up
after him.

401
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:31,517
And you.

402
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:38,695
There is no one left to blame.

403
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,355
Stop looking.

404
00:24:56,682 --> 00:24:57,870
Hadar set the fire.

405
00:24:58,476 --> 00:24:59,583
Covering for Rivkin.

406
00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:01,434
I was betrayed...

407
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:03,435
by Mossad, by my father, by Tony.

408
00:25:04,308 --> 00:25:05,370
Who's next?

409
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:07,340
You?

410
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:21,423
Pardon me, Director.

411
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:36,054
Your Agent Gibbs is making
my people very nervous.

412
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:38,635
He slipped through security.

413
00:25:38,695 --> 00:25:40,290
Any idea where he might be going?

414
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,792
Knowing Gibbs, a coffee run?

415
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,430
Man practically mainlines caffeine.

416
00:25:51,564 --> 00:25:52,385
Thank you.

417
00:25:55,165 --> 00:25:57,307
- It's been a long time, my friend.
- Amsterdam.

418
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,436
How did it get this far?

419
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:02,672
Simple.

420
00:26:03,258 --> 00:26:05,022
One of your agents killed
one of my agents.

421
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,192
We both know
that's not where this started.

422
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:09,152
I notified you of the sleeper cell.

423
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:11,009
Your guy was already
knee-deep in it.

424
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:14,086
You don't trust we can police
our own backyard.

425
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:17,118
The view
from where I sit is quite different.

426
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:19,556
The threats are...

427
00:26:20,502 --> 00:26:21,414
immediate.

428
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,960
Unfortunately,
I do not have the luxury of patience.

429
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:26,962
Sometimes patience is a necessity.

430
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:30,840
Otherwise you end up making
an enemy out of your friend.

431
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:34,875
And then we end up
with a dead American and a dead Israeli.

432
00:26:35,212 --> 00:26:37,347
And I know that's the last thing
either one of us wants.

433
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:44,595
Rivkin wasn't a rogue agent.

434
00:26:44,995 --> 00:26:47,107
He was following
your orders... you said so yourself.

435
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:50,585
I underestimated Agent DiNozzo.

436
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,196
You sent him in there to rile me up.

437
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:54,749
I learned from the best.

438
00:26:57,948 --> 00:27:00,954
There's a terrorist training camp
somewhere in North Africa.

439
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:02,998
We have not been able to pinpoint...

440
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:04,791
anything exact,

441
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:08,920
but we managed to identify one
of their sleeper cells in Los Angeles.

442
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:10,505
So you sent Rivkin to L.A.?

443
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:12,624
He was on an end run.

444
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,267
Find the leader of the cell,
he gives up the handler,

445
00:27:17,327 --> 00:27:19,931
find the handler, he gives up
the location of the training camp.

446
00:27:20,213 --> 00:27:21,641
And he kills them along the way.

447
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,580
Including the handler.

448
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,187
You can hardly leave
those people behind to come after you.

449
00:27:26,453 --> 00:27:27,661
Oh, I understand, Eli.

450
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:29,466
I don't judge you.

451
00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:31,109
I never have.

452
00:27:32,272 --> 00:27:34,640
Unfortunately, I cannot trust...

453
00:27:34,924 --> 00:27:38,138
everyone in your intelligence community
to be as understanding as you.

454
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,954
So you had Rivkin spy on them.

455
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:46,900
The death of the American
agent was an accident.

456
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:54,758
Rivkin never got the intel
about the training camp, did he?

457
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,553
All this to find a camp
that's probably already been moved.

458
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,617
It's not about the camp.

459
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:02,682
It's the man who runs it.

460
00:28:02,952 --> 00:28:04,768
Well, he must be
very important to you.

461
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,437
He killed one of my people.

462
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:23,370
- I had no choice.
- That's a lie.

463
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,788
Why would I lie to you, Ziva?

464
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:26,539
To save your worthless ass.

465
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,409
From who?

466
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:28,644
Vance?

467
00:28:28,893 --> 00:28:29,626
Mossad?

468
00:28:30,345 --> 00:28:32,504
You jeopardized your entire career,
and for what?

469
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:34,381
For you.

470
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:37,384
He was playing you, Ziva.

471
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:40,303
For some reason,
you felt it was your job to protect me?

472
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:42,806
- I did what I had to do.
- You killed him.

473
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:45,642
If I hadn't, you'd be having
this conversation with him.

474
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:47,352
Maybe that's
the way you'd prefer it.

475
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:48,883
Perhaps I would!

476
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:50,563
Why don't you just get this out.

477
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,709
You want to take a punch,
take a swing?

478
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:54,021
Get it out of your system!

479
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:55,318
Go ahead, do it!

480
00:28:57,618 --> 00:28:58,655
Be careful, Tony,

481
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:01,991
because, much like Michael,
I only need one.

482
00:29:03,203 --> 00:29:05,229
And that's what you're
really angry about, isn't it?

483
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:06,705
That's what's bothering you.

484
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:08,331
It's not that he's dead.

485
00:29:08,803 --> 00:29:12,293
It's that your Mossad boyfriend got
his ass kicked by a chump like me.

486
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:13,753
You took advantage of him.

487
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:15,714
He attacked me.
What was I supposed...

488
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:20,635
You saw a glass table, you pushed
him back, you dropped him on it,

489
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:22,838
He was impaled in the side
by a shard of glass...

490
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:24,147
bloody,

491
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:25,390
gasping for air!

492
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:26,913
I guess you read my report.

493
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,178
I memorized it!

494
00:29:28,238 --> 00:29:30,400
You could have left it at that,
you could've walked away,

495
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,712
but no, you let him up!

496
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:34,232
- You put a bullet in his chest!
- You weren't there.

497
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:36,491
You could've put one in his leg!

498
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:39,042
You... weren't...

499
00:29:39,425 --> 00:29:40,989
- there.
- But I should've been!

500
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:45,118
You loved him.

501
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:48,444
I guess I'll never know.

502
00:29:56,405 --> 00:29:58,370
- What do you got, Abs?
<i>- Hey, Gibbs.</i>

503
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,633
<i>Wow, it's my</i> first trans-global
"What do you got, Abs?"

504
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:03,883
Think maybe I could get
a trans-global Caf-POW <i>delivery?</i>

505
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,346
Depends on what you have.

506
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:08,952
We did a postmortem Humpty
Dumpty on Rivkin's laptop.

507
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,103
And we were able to reconstruct most
of the data from his hard drive.

508
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:15,148
<i>He used a specialized algorithm
to generate a well-harbored</i>

509
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:16,715
short key for most of his files.

510
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:20,153
But we managed to crack both
the algorithm and the ISP protocols.

511
00:30:20,311 --> 00:30:22,154
- What's the point, McGee?
- <i>Basically,</i>

512
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:25,158
we put his hard drive back together,
and as it turns out...

513
00:30:25,238 --> 00:30:26,869
It's not Rivkin's laptop.

514
00:30:27,532 --> 00:30:29,369
- So we got nothing.
- <i>No, actually,</i>

515
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,817
boss, we have everything.

516
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:34,334
This laptop belonged to Abin Tabal.

517
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,654
Our dead handler?

518
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:36,877
<i>Yep, that's the one.</i>

519
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:39,923
Rivkin probably switched
laptops after he killed him.

520
00:30:40,095 --> 00:30:42,674
Throws us off and gives Rivkin
all the intel he needed.

521
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:45,450
We've got serial numbers,
names and cell phone numbers,

522
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,014
all linked to various locations
in North Africa.

523
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:50,099
<i>And that's not all, Gibbs.</i>

524
00:30:50,545 --> 00:30:53,228
We were able to decrypt
Rivkin's e-mail accounts.

525
00:30:54,392 --> 00:30:57,844
Which was only half the battle,
because it was in Hebrew and...

526
00:30:58,321 --> 00:30:59,359
Hebrew is hard.

527
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:02,830
Apparently, Rivkin was in DC working
with Mossad contacts

528
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,948
to gather intel
on a terrorist <i>training camp</i>.

529
00:31:05,476 --> 00:31:06,658
Who were his contacts?

530
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:12,677
We traced several e-mails to...

531
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:16,137
a restricted account.

532
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:17,377
A very...

533
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:18,878
very restricted account.

534
00:31:19,288 --> 00:31:20,380
Restricted by who?

535
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,841
Us, <i>Gibbs.</i>

536
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:29,556
Rivkin was e-mailing Ziva...

537
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:31,022
At NCIS.

538
00:31:31,596 --> 00:31:33,351
You know
that this means Ziva knew...

539
00:31:33,432 --> 00:31:34,561
Yeah, I got it, McGee.

540
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,813
It means Ziva was withholding...

541
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:39,009
- <i>vital...</i>
- I said I got it, Abby!

542
00:31:48,661 --> 00:31:50,743
You told Michael
to stay with me in DC. Why?

543
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,955
- That is none of your concern.
- I have made it my concern.

544
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,165
Do not question me, Ziva.

545
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:57,625
Was any of it real?

546
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:01,879
Does it matter?
Michael is gone. You must move on.

547
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,506
It's no longer about him.

548
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,801
- Agent DiNozzo?
- I need to know if he was right.

549
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:08,028
He was jealous.

550
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,000
Even if that were true, that does not
make him wrong. Now, answer me!

551
00:32:11,282 --> 00:32:12,382
Was it real?

552
00:32:12,608 --> 00:32:13,932
I don't know.

553
00:32:14,376 --> 00:32:15,184
Perhaps.

554
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:17,283
Why was I not told
the details of his mission?

555
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:18,498
Why was I excluded?

556
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:21,831
Because, Ziva,
I don't know who you answer to anymore.

557
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:23,610
NCIS or Mossad?

558
00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:25,445
What is it you expect from me?

559
00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:27,348
I expect your loyalty.

560
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:29,407
To me and only me!

561
00:32:30,138 --> 00:32:31,784
You want to know
Michael's assignment?

562
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:33,138
Make this your Aliyah.

563
00:32:33,505 --> 00:32:35,235
You return to me, to us.

564
00:32:35,478 --> 00:32:37,290
You finish what Michael started.

565
00:32:43,098 --> 00:32:44,482
So, that's it, right?

566
00:32:44,856 --> 00:32:46,044
I'm done with Israel?

567
00:32:46,104 --> 00:32:48,452
- We're not coming back here?
- Get on the plane, DiNozzo.

568
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:50,160
All right, you got it, boss.

569
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,420
Take her easy.

570
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:55,551
Our people...

571
00:32:56,034 --> 00:32:58,010
pulled this off the laptop
Rivkin was using.

572
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,722
Should answer a lot
of your questions.

573
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:01,356
Thank you.

574
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,316
And thank Miss Sciuto, as well.

575
00:33:03,836 --> 00:33:05,610
Is there anything you don't know?

576
00:33:06,908 --> 00:33:07,904
Not anymore.

577
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:11,032
- Happy hunting, Eli.
- Shalom, my friend.

578
00:33:29,783 --> 00:33:32,553
- Plane leaves in five minutes, Ziva.
- Not without us, it doesn't.

579
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,640
I think it is best
if I simply speak from the heart.

580
00:33:36,238 --> 00:33:37,713
Well, yeah, it usually is.

581
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:38,910
It's Tony.

582
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:41,351
I am still not convinced

583
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,082
that he has been entirely truthful
about Michael's...

584
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:46,526
Rivkin's shooting.

585
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,362
He gave you his word.

586
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:52,031
I am not sure we can work together.

587
00:33:52,617 --> 00:33:54,132
Perhaps it is best if...

588
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:57,328
one of us gets transferred
to another team.

589
00:33:58,507 --> 00:33:59,372
Transferred?

590
00:34:01,444 --> 00:34:03,668
I need to be able to trust
the people that I work with.

591
00:34:04,147 --> 00:34:06,393
I know you, more than anyone,
understand that.

592
00:34:23,491 --> 00:34:25,006
Take care of yourself.

593
00:34:41,135 --> 00:34:41,956
One short?

594
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:45,835
Good to go.

595
00:35:25,114 --> 00:35:26,292
Are they here yet?!

596
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:30,361
Abs, I told you, I'll call you
as soon as they show up. Scout's honor.

597
00:35:30,669 --> 00:35:33,424
That's too late, McGee.
It's not an official "Welcome Back".

598
00:35:33,741 --> 00:35:37,303
I mean, if I'm here and they walk in,
I get to say: "Yay, welcome back!"

599
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:40,219
If they're already here and I come in
like Miss Tardy to the party,

600
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:42,517
then technically it's like them
welcoming me back.

601
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:43,726
Tell him, Palmer.

602
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,646
She... she makes a good point.

603
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:50,154
I saw that, Palmer!

604
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:55,863
Okay, their flight's arrived.
Where are they?

605
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:56,906
Behind you.

606
00:35:58,362 --> 00:35:59,833
- Welcome back!
- Watch the...

607
00:35:59,893 --> 00:36:01,669
- We missed you! Sorry.
- That's all right.

608
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:03,621
- Missed you too, Abs.
- Tony, I...

609
00:36:06,394 --> 00:36:08,042
So, Ziva's getting her stuff or...?

610
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:08,835
No.

611
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:10,253
She parking her car?

612
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:11,671
No.

613
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:14,048
What is she doing?

614
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:17,426
Well, considering the time difference,
probably eating breakfast.

615
00:36:18,352 --> 00:36:19,830
- She's still in Tel Aviv?
- Yep.

616
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:21,889
When is she coming back?

617
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:23,266
She's not.

618
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,148
No! This cannot happen!

619
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,895
Vance cannot do this again!

620
00:36:27,975 --> 00:36:29,262
Wasn't Vance's call.

621
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:35,319
Well, if it wasn't Vance, then who?

622
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:39,289
Forgive the intrusion.

623
00:36:41,552 --> 00:36:43,526
How did you possibly manage to...

624
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:46,547
Geez, Duck,
you gonna ask me that every time?

625
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,315
How was your flight?

626
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,502
One short.

627
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:57,251
Yeah, I know this decision must...

628
00:36:57,463 --> 00:36:58,869
not have come easily.

629
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,261
It wasn't my decision.

630
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,241
- But Tony said...
- No.

631
00:37:03,427 --> 00:37:04,421
Ziva's.

632
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:06,809
The moment she asked me to choose.

633
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,651
So this is not about loyalty,

634
00:37:09,885 --> 00:37:13,065
it's about an unreasonable demand.

635
00:37:13,224 --> 00:37:14,864
She withheld information.

636
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:16,360
To protect Rivkin.

637
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,406
Someone she obviously cared about.

638
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:23,600
Ziva has always remained
an officer of Mossad.

639
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:25,912
I certainly don't envy

640
00:37:25,992 --> 00:37:28,331
the position
that she just found herself in.

641
00:37:28,518 --> 00:37:31,709
Considering her less-than-conspicuous
background,

642
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,337
it's amazing
she ever had your trust.

643
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,633
No, she earned it.

644
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:43,434
But you took to Ziva more quickly
than any other agent before her.

645
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,015
Timothy, Caitlin, even DiNozzo.

646
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:48,999
I've always sensed that there's...

647
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,562
a strong bond
between the two of you.

648
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:55,524
Something shared, perhaps.

649
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,689
No.

650
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:10,480
She proved herself.

651
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:14,543
Whatever it was
that Ziva did to prove her loyalty,

652
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:17,755
well, it was not nearly
as momentous as you believed.

653
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:21,259
Or was it?

654
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:07,263
Went over the personnel files,
like you asked.

655
00:39:07,468 --> 00:39:08,973
There's a couple that stood out.

656
00:39:10,376 --> 00:39:12,537
- Both would be a good fit.
- Take your pick.

657
00:39:14,723 --> 00:39:17,940
- I'll let you know in a few months.
- Yeah, I knew it couldn't be that easy.

658
00:39:19,812 --> 00:39:21,527
You think she might ask
to come back?

659
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:24,155
I'm just giving her time.
That's all.

660
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:25,364
Time to what?

661
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:27,132
Remember...

662
00:39:27,814 --> 00:39:28,909
who she can trust.

663
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:30,536
Let me make it easy for you.

664
00:39:31,217 --> 00:39:32,496
You made the right call.

665
00:39:32,772 --> 00:39:34,790
I wasn't asking
for your opinion, Leon.

666
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,500
Just who you think
you're talking to?

667
00:39:36,966 --> 00:39:38,377
That's a good damn question.

668
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,129
I've been wondering
that for a while.

669
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:42,221
You spend half
your time second-guessing me.

670
00:39:42,537 --> 00:39:45,342
- Studying me, testing me.
- I'm looking for answers.

671
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,344
It'd help if you'd ask
the damn questions.

672
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:52,307
There's the rub.
You don't have a clue what to ask.

673
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:54,185
You don't trust me,
but you don't know why.

674
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,728
You want to talk about trust?

675
00:39:55,974 --> 00:39:57,950
What about tearing
apart my team last year?

676
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,940
There was no warning,
there was no discussion.

677
00:40:00,021 --> 00:40:02,561
Is that what this is about?
You want to sit in the big chair.

678
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:05,404
No, I don't. I want to trust
whoever does sit there!

679
00:40:06,096 --> 00:40:07,615
I want to protect my team.

680
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,532
Like Ziva?

681
00:40:08,957 --> 00:40:09,825
Okay, fine.

682
00:40:10,669 --> 00:40:12,558
You made the decision
to leave her in Tel Aviv.

683
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,918
I supported you.

684
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,050
And now you might want
to let her back. Why?

685
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,000
Because
whatever she might have done,

686
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,425
I trust her...

687
00:40:19,744 --> 00:40:20,961
for what I know she did.

688
00:40:24,784 --> 00:40:26,801
- Four years ago...
- She saved your life.

689
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,346
By shooting and killing
her half-brother, Ari.

690
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:33,599
I told you the chair was big.

691
00:40:35,806 --> 00:40:37,536
Ari was out of control.

692
00:40:37,921 --> 00:40:40,397
So, Ziva's father sent her
to eliminate him.

693
00:40:42,271 --> 00:40:44,902
She kills Ari, earns your trust.

694
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,363
Two birds, one bullet.

695
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:49,240
Eli played you.

696
00:40:49,537 --> 00:40:53,527
But regardless, Gibbs, up until now,
Ziva's always been loyal to this agency.

697
00:40:55,164 --> 00:40:56,943
I know you don't want
to hear this, Gibbs.

698
00:40:58,412 --> 00:40:59,861
But now you have to trust me.

699
00:41:01,264 --> 00:41:03,295
And if you're right
about Ziva's allegiance to you,

700
00:41:03,676 --> 00:41:05,464
she'll serve us well at Mossad.

701
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,435
Yeah,

702
00:41:07,071 --> 00:41:09,166
and if you're right,
about her father...

703
00:41:11,065 --> 00:41:12,411
