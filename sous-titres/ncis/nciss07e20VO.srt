Help! Help me!

3
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,846
I'm gonna die!
Help! Please!

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,687
Help me!

5
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,105
I'm coming! Hang on!

6
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:23,182
I'm coming!

NCIS Season 7 Episode 20

Synchro: Gaillots.

www.Team-NCIS.com

11
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:06,531
I thought you said 27,000 kills.

12
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:07,832
28,000 kills.

13
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:10,332
But, yesterday,
you said 27,000 kills.

14
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,588
That was yesterday.

15
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,324
You killed a thousand people
in a day?

16
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:15,455
I was hot. Super hot.
I was cappin' fools.

17
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:18,676
It's not a cause for pride, McGee,
it's a cause for concern.

18
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:20,872
Speaking of causes for concern.

19
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:22,248
Autopsy Gremlin.

20
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:24,167
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,508
You know what happens
if the direct sunlight hits your skin.

22
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:28,920
I was just showing Ziva
pictures of me and Breena.

23
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:31,243
Things are getting pretty serious
with the girlfriend, huh?

24
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:32,579
I don't know...

25
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:34,093
Matching tattoos.

26
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,471
It's just henna.
It's just... it's just henna.

27
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,963
- It's gonna be gone in a few days.
- Let me just see.

28
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:42,101
You got commitment issues, Palmer?

29
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:44,744
I get a little nervous about...
permanent things.

30
00:01:45,054 --> 00:01:47,398
Actually, I can't even put
a bumper sticker on my car.

31
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,777
Where is this?
Looks like the Baltimore Street Scene.

32
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:52,748
McGee, didn't you say
you wanted to go to that?

33
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:54,447
I decided not to.

34
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:58,576
Did you really make that decision,
McGee, or was it made for you

35
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,746
by your addiction to killing?
He killed a thousand people yesterday.

36
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,040
That is not the record.

37
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,291
On his video game.

38
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:08,336
Is that a record?

39
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,244
- That's pretty good.
- Thank you, Palmer.

40
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:13,466
We're not encouraging
this kind of behavior.

41
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:15,824
You spent, like,
six hours online last night.

42
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:18,541
You need to unplug,
talk to real people.

43
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,164
These are real people, Tony.

44
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:24,259
Living, breathing people with lungs and
skin, you can touch and interact with

45
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:27,605
- we got to find you one of those.
- Yeah, I got one of the other kind.

46
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:29,649
Petty officer washed up
on a Maryland beach.

47
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,436
- Grab your stuff.
- All right!

48
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:36,762
That is not an appropriate reaction,
is it?

49
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:40,711
I know, Boss, I'm as shocked as you are,
but Ziva invited the Gremlin up here.

50
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:43,459
Don't get him wet.

51
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,358
Mind your step, Mr. Palmer.

52
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:49,752
- Minding my step, Sir.
- It's slippery.

53
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:58,541
- Where's the burrito wrap?
- Got it right here, Doctor.

54
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,846
- And here is the body bag.
- Let's lay it out here.

55
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,627
It's gnarly, dude.

56
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:03,930
Man!

57
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,227
Yeah! For real!

58
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:07,384
Words.

59
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,312
Use 'em. Helpful words.

60
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,457
We were sleeping in a van,
yo, right?

61
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,942
And we heard Bam! Bam!

62
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,360
Boom! Boom! Crack! Crack!

63
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,429
Gunshots, dude.

64
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:17,699
That's what I said, I was,
like, "Dude, gunshots", right?

65
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:20,283
So you're saying
there were six gunshots?

66
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:24,078
No, two gunshots.
But, there was, like, a echo.

67
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,758
He was like, "Dude, don't look",
and I was like, "Dude, we're looking".

68
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:29,360
Yeah, and then we, like,
peeked through the windows,

69
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:32,586
and we saw two dudes drive off
in a black Lincoln.

70
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:35,172
Two? You sure it was two?
It wasn't an echo?

71
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,490
Yeah, two dudes.

72
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:39,124
Two dudes.

73
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,158
Right there.

74
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:48,949
All right,
fingerprint scan matches his Navy I.D.

75
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:50,722
Petty Officer Scott Roebuck.

76
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:53,316
Lived within walking distance
from here.

77
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:55,637
Actually,
within jogging distance, I'd say.

78
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:59,215
Does your new magical machine
tell you how he died, Timothy?

79
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,267
Well, it's not much
of a noodle-scratcher there, Duck,

80
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:05,232
but I'm gonna say GSW to the head.

81
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,414
McGee would know...
head shots are his specialty.

82
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,659
What?

83
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,251
Referring to a video game
he's been playing way too much.

84
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:15,348
That's a surprising bit
of editorializing coming

85
00:04:15,432 --> 00:04:17,381
from the once
and future king of Dorkland.

86
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,768
Hey, I now have a girlfriend.

87
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:21,743
The king is dead.

88
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:23,833
Long live the king.

89
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:27,558
What do you got?

90
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:30,853
We...

91
00:04:31,423 --> 00:04:35,358
found Petty Officer Roebuck's MP3
down at the end of the dock.

92
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:38,861
Must have fallen off
before he went in the water.

93
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,507
With his shoes on?

94
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:42,966
Well, either he was shot first
and thrown in, or

95
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,700
he went in
after something important.

96
00:04:45,082 --> 00:04:46,132
Or someone.

97
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:48,940
How about the tides?

98
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:50,122
See...

99
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,626
at this latitude,
high tide was at 11:00 p.m.

100
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,500
So we're still going down.

101
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:58,374
Special Agent Gibbs...
found something!

102
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,652
This is terrible.

103
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:06,664
All right, Tony, let's hook him.

104
00:05:06,904 --> 00:05:09,237
I believe it's called a gaff.
What is?

105
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,082
- The hook.
- You don't seem to be gaffing well,

106
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,901
- so try hooking.
- I used to like spending time with you.

107
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:16,440
Got him?

108
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,276
I'll get another body bag.

109
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:22,093
He's been beaten about the face.

110
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,873
His hands and legs are bound.

111
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,200
The chains must have snagged
when the tides went down.

112
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,035
McGee, put the scanner on.

113
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,246
Yes, Boss.

114
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:34,000
There we go.

115
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:37,765
No, no names coming up on AFIS.

116
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,881
No, wait a second, Boss,
we got a red flag here.

117
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,652
It says contact the FBI.

118
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,584
I think I recognize this guy...

119
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,055
Stefano Delmar.

120
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,347
Who?

121
00:05:49,618 --> 00:05:51,875
Organized crime.
Up-and-comer.

122
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:55,290
Our petty officer
stumbled onto a hit.

123
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:03,614
You sure it's Delmar?

124
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:06,073
Can't be sure.
The file just said contact the FBI.

125
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,160
Saves me a trip to the rooftop
to flash the Gibbs Signal.

126
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:10,511
You...

127
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:12,955
still investigating those Mob hits?

128
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,166
Hence the undercover beard.

129
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,503
I'm worried.
It gets a little bigger...

130
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:21,756
People are gonna start thinking
you're Kenny Rogers.

131
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,762
- The hits...
- I'm gonna start calling you

132
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:25,468
- The Gambler.
- Not the beard.

133
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:30,848
What is this?

134
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:34,861
A small portion of Stefano Delmar's
sworn testimony to the Grand Jury.

135
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,368
- He turned State's evidence.
- He was trying to consolidate power,

136
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:40,409
till we caught him cold
on a murder charge and

137
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:42,318
he decided
to give everyone else up instead.

138
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,501
He's done a whole lot of talking.

139
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:46,781
He was supposed to be
on his way into witness protection.

140
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:48,540
But now he's dead.

141
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:51,461
And he's not the first.

142
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:54,872
Someone is not doing a very good job

143
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:57,345
of protecting witnesses.

144
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:06,996
There is cortisone cream in the far
cabinet, Mr. Palmer, for your itching.

145
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:10,638
- I think it's in my head, Doctor.
- Yeah, but you're scratching your back.

146
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:14,194
No, sometimes when I get around sand,
I just start itching.

147
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,195
Well, if you care to explore the origins
of this psychological affliction,

148
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,309
I can offer
my professional services.

149
00:07:21,393 --> 00:07:23,776
What's the first thing
that springs to mind?

150
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:26,238
Well, I really liked to play
in the sand when I was a kid.

151
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:29,698
I used to bury my toys,
play amateur archaeologist.

152
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,910
Our neighbors, I remember,
did some remodeling once, and

153
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,677
- they had a big pile of sand out front.
- To mix with cement.

154
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:39,364
Yeah, yeah, but it wasn't sand-sand,
like the good sand... it was bad sand,

155
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:42,155
very bad sand.
Made me break out in red welts.

156
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:45,330
It wasn't the sand, Mr. Palmer,
but the sand mite.

157
00:07:46,352 --> 00:07:48,759
- The sand might what?
- The sand mite bit you.

158
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,014
Sand bites?

159
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,804
Sand mites might bite.

160
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:54,007
I'm grammatically lost.

161
00:07:54,856 --> 00:07:56,350
But medically found.

162
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:58,853
The tiny crustacean
known as the mite.

163
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:01,438
M-I-T-E.

164
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:06,251
I believe a simple allergy is
the solution to this problem.

165
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,596
That's your conclusion, Doctor?

166
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,239
Delmar was allergic to seawater?

167
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,913
Well, to breathing it, perhaps.

168
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:14,349
His lungs were full.

169
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:16,834
Cause of death was,
in fact, drowning.

170
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:19,403
He was thrown in alive.

171
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:21,584
Petty Officer was trying
to be a good Samaritan.

172
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,627
No good deed goes unpunished.

173
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:28,712
Yeah...

174
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,551
That's Delmar, all right.

175
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,061
It's the first body
that's actually turned up.

176
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:36,056
- Confirms the word on the street.
- What about the other two hits?

177
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:38,122
Disappeared.

178
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,811
Presumably with extreme prejudice.

179
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,876
FBI recently...

180
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:45,691
lost a few witnesses.

181
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:46,716
"Lost"?

182
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,636
Well, we advise against it,

183
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,406
but it's not uncommon for witnesses
to reject the protection program.

184
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:55,409
Try to return to their own lives.

185
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:57,912
But Delmar never even
got to his new home.

186
00:08:58,144 --> 00:08:59,079
You got a leak?

187
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:00,071
Maybe.

188
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,081
The Bureau's hands-on
until the testimony's complete.

189
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:05,812
Then the Marshals take over.

190
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:08,181
We varied protocols, just in case.

191
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:10,948
Whoever killed him took
the job personally.

192
00:09:11,032 --> 00:09:13,067
He was not only beaten
around the face, but...

193
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:15,527
the torso, as well,
before being drowned.

194
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:17,135
Like a rat.

195
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:20,662
Yeah, well,
I did find one unexplained wound.

196
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:23,248
Here... there's also an infection.

197
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:24,857
I suspect tetanus.

198
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,398
What, those little scabs?

199
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,806
Yeah, they're some sort
of punctures.

200
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:31,421
About a week old, maybe two.

201
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:34,283
He was in FBI custody last week?

202
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,433
And the week before that.

203
00:09:37,362 --> 00:09:39,479
Yeah, Tobias, you've got a leak.

204
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:45,854
All right, let's get moving.

205
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:50,422
Okay, "FBI witness profile
and sequestering schedule".

206
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:52,186
Reminds me of middle school,

207
00:09:52,577 --> 00:09:55,261
when you get the smart kids
to check the dumb kids' homework.

208
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,956
Yeah, which one were you?

209
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:01,087
And that's because I anointed you,
king of Dorkland?

210
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:04,614
Fair enough.
Let's start with the safe houses.

211
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:06,772
- I got a Motel Six.
- Freemont Inn.

212
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:07,857
Got a Hyatt.

213
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,900
Must be nice
to have a budget for hotels.

214
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
Moving on.

215
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:13,885
Special agent in charge...

216
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,698
Look, there's my old buddy,
Rick Sacks.

217
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:19,493
- Kind of hope he's the leak.
- Robertson.

218
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:21,787
- Van Horn.
- Moving on.

219
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:26,000
Appointment with a company
called "Cooper's Hawk Security".

220
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:27,623
Me, too.

221
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:28,961
Yeah, me, three.

222
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:32,194
All right, Cooper's,
you go to the top of the "maybe" pile.

223
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:34,987
Cooper's Hawk Security?

224
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:38,621
Outside contractor...
background checks, securities.

225
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:41,574
They specialize
in polygraph investigations.

226
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:43,767
Lie detectors are inadmissible.

227
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:47,521
We occasionally use them to verify
statements before we get to court.

228
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:51,400
Really? You can't just take
what career criminals say at face value?

229
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:54,959
Even after agreeing to full disclosure,
some witnesses try to hold back,

230
00:10:55,043 --> 00:10:57,448
but with a skilled technician,
the polygraph will catch them.

231
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:00,632
Son of a bitch.

232
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,495
That's explaining Delmar's foot.

233
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,995
Old tack in the shoe routine.

234
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:07,384
Pain messes up the baseline
reading when you tell the truth.

235
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:09,752
It makes it difficult to get
an accurate read on a lie.

236
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:11,962
If the wounds are self-inflicted,

237
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,308
- the leak might be outside the Bureau.
- Link could be in that company.

238
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:17,869
Common link to all witnesses.

239
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:19,806
We'd put someone there,
see how they operate.

240
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,358
Enough undercover work.
Let's do this the easy way.

241
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:25,794
We get the judge off the last trial to
issue a court order for their internals.

242
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:28,187
Find the name of anyone
who interacted with all three.

243
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,054
We'll do it your way.
Let's go.

244
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,780
There are two kinds
of people in the world:

245
00:11:33,964 --> 00:11:36,803
the kind that actually believes
there's only two kinds of people,

246
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,700
and the kind
that ain't total idiots.

247
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:41,241
Your Honor,

248
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:44,246
if you'd review my request,
you'd see that

249
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,747
I'm not asking to violate
client confidentiality.

250
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:51,109
Not in those words, Agent Fornell,
but that would be the effect.

251
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,253
If I granted the court order.

252
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:56,131
- So much for the easy way.
- How is that?

253
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,174
Ignore him.

254
00:11:57,364 --> 00:11:59,718
"Evelyn" is fine
when I'm not in the robe.

255
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,345
Why can't we just have them all?

256
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:04,765
Cooper's handles sensitive information,
Agent Gibbs.

257
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,804
They're a reputable firm with
a very large private clientele base,

258
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:09,561
not to mention
the Federal Government.

259
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,523
A two-man hit team took
down Stefano Delmar.

260
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:16,235
You think his people knew he was talking
because someone at Cooper's let it slip?

261
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:19,271
Tobias, that was one
of the worst-kept secrets in town.

262
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,199
The same team that killed Petty Officer
Roebuck just for being there.

263
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,862
I share your frustration

264
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,163
with the occasional inequities
of the legal system,

265
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:32,365
but I cannot sign off
on blanket violations of privacy.

266
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:38,210
In the hopes of serving justice,

267
00:12:38,294 --> 00:12:41,520
however, I could release
Delmar's full testimony to you.

268
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,440
Least you could find out
what names he named.

269
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,560
Would help narrow down
our search for the killers.

270
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:51,452
Thank you...

271
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,153
And I could buy you both a coffee.

272
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:57,045
Pick your poison.

273
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:00,921
You had a cup this morning,
didn't you?

274
00:13:01,226 --> 00:13:02,633
Yeah. Every morning.

275
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:05,059
And Judge Wallace bought you one.

276
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:08,059
What is that, your fifth?

277
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,305
It's not even 4:00 yet.

278
00:13:11,512 --> 00:13:14,877
I might have found a way
into Cooper's Hawk Security.

279
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:20,973
I didn't know you were looking.

280
00:13:21,674 --> 00:13:23,044
Well, it's not illegal.

281
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:25,069
- I'm not hacking or anything.
- Right.

282
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:27,347
Did you start looking

283
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,299
after we saw the judge?

284
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:32,335
Or before?

285
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:37,357
Before.

286
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,312
Right.

287
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,704
- Thanks for doing it my way.
- Don't mention it.

288
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,572
- I was being facetious.
- Me, too.

289
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,764
Cooper's personnel files.

290
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:50,245
Susan Grady?
That's the polygraph lady.

291
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,580
You know her?

292
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:53,828
Says she's one of their specialists.

293
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,872
Yeah, she's one
of our specialists, too.

294
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:57,289
More precisely...

295
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:01,006
one of McGee's specialists,
meaning she specializes in McGee.

296
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:03,091
And polygraphs.

297
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,067
Employment histories overlapped.

298
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:07,054
Looks like she was moonlighting.

299
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,657
I'm an 080 security specialist,
not a full-time agent.

300
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:14,777
I got clearance from the Director
before I started freelancing.

301
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:18,188
- Wait. Director Vance knows?
- No, this was Director Shepard.

302
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:21,109
This was, I think, February 08.

303
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:23,674
- Susan, you're not in trouble.
- I know I'm not in trouble.

304
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:25,538
I haven't broken any regulations.

305
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:27,819
- Then stop acting defensive.
- I'm not acting.

306
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:29,566
I'm genuinely feeling
on the defensive.

307
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,517
You have a very off-putting way
of putting people...

308
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:34,517
you know, off.

309
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:38,669
- I'm not the first one to say it.
- It's not my fault you feel guilty.

310
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:42,732
Sure, I guess I could have reminded
Director Vance when he took the desk,

311
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:46,670
and I could have told them "no" when
they offered me a more regular job.

312
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:49,263
- Or told them you already have a job.
- It's still part-time.

313
00:14:49,618 --> 00:14:51,940
Two days a week, usually,
unless they have a...

314
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,848
unusually heavy caseload or...

315
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,903
Stay down! Stay down!

316
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,926
<i>All noncombustible items
on the left.</i>

317
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:18,282
<i>If it's fried, on the right.</i>

318
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,044
<i>And mark a big "O"
on anything organic.</i>

319
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:23,965
Abby, do you really need that thing?

320
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:25,340
<i>Need, McGee?</i>

321
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,009
<i>Reason not the need, McGee.</i>

322
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:28,885
<i>Don't be so limited.</i>

323
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:31,142
<i>If it smells,</i>

324
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:33,751
- <i>bring it directly to my lab, pronto.</i>
- Noncombustible.

325
00:15:34,144 --> 00:15:35,475
McGee, we got a cause yet?

326
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,895
Well, I called the Fire Marshal.

327
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,265
He is still not ready to sign off
on the cause of the explosion,

328
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:43,947
but he is willing to admit
that it probably wasn't an accident.

329
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:45,985
- You think?
- Where's DiNozzo and David?

330
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:48,196
Still out canvassing.
How is Susan?

331
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,574
In the conference room...
go find out.

332
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,806
- What, you want me to go question her?
- She's in shock, Tim.

333
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,371
We're going to need a gentle touch,
and based on your past relationship...

334
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,695
Relationship?
There was no relationship.

335
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:01,126
That's not how I remember it.

336
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:03,587
Boss, she practically
sexually harassed me.

337
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:07,466
I get chills just thinking about
the EKG that she was sticking up...

338
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:11,178
Conference room.

339
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:21,938
You okay?

340
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,049
- Maybe I can...
- Thank you. I was so scared!

341
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:35,302
You have a surveillance camera
in the conference room now?

342
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,403
Hope you don't have
one in the elevator.

343
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:39,915
We don't.

344
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:42,319
Not yet, at least, Agent Fornell.

345
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:44,740
How can I help you?

346
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:47,221
- Need to borrow your TV.
- And my copy of Emily Post.

347
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,770
Door was closed.

348
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:52,009
I thought you were in MTAC.

349
00:16:52,172 --> 00:16:55,138
Well, we all make mistakes.
That's why God invented knocking.

350
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,557
McGee is interviewing Susan Grady?

351
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:00,352
You sure you don't have
a camera in the elevator?

352
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:03,605
When I do, you'll be the first to know,
Agent Fornell.

353
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:05,402
TV's all yours.

354
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:09,528
<i>Let go. Let go.
Thank you. Thank you.</i>

355
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,864
Now, I know it's hard, okay?
But I'm going to need you to focus.

356
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:14,933
Can you do that for me?

357
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:18,537
All right, so I'm going to have
to ask you a few questions.

358
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:20,653
That's funny.

359
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:22,999
I'm usually the one
who asks the questions.

360
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,627
Yeah, I remember.

361
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:29,005
You know,
we never really got a chance

362
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:32,609
to talk about the...

363
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:35,720
You know, the... remember...?

364
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,787
The time that you had me retake
my polygraph test,

365
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:39,975
because you wanted to see
if I had a girlfriend?

366
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,810
<i>I know it was wrong and I'm sorry...</i>

367
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,228
I took care of that.

368
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:46,440
<i>I think you're really cute and I...</i>

369
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:49,591
Don't worry about it, Susan.
It's okay, all right?

370
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:52,738
Just water under the bridge.
Let's just forget it ever happened.

371
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:58,378
All right, now, you've been working
at Cooper's Hawk Security about 2 years?

372
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:01,105
And you help them run
their background checks?

373
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:03,498
No, I just administer polygraphs.

374
00:18:04,122 --> 00:18:05,122
So, same as here.

375
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:06,710
No, not the same.

376
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,024
Here, everyone treats me like a leper.
I walk into a room, they walk out.

377
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:14,476
Like, like everyone's afraid I'm going
to find out their deepest,

378
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,635
darkest secrets.

379
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:19,354
But, Cooper's specializes in...

380
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:22,376
giving polygraphs.
There, I was just...

381
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:25,145
one of the guys, which was nice.

382
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:29,273
I can't believe they're all dead.

383
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:36,902
This man...

384
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:39,117
You ever given him a polygraph?

385
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:44,164
You aware of any threats
against Cooper's Hawk?

386
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,167
Anything unusual
in the office this morning?

387
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:51,097
No, the Internet was down for a bit,
but nothing unusual about that.

388
00:18:51,607 --> 00:18:55,217
The techs came
and it was working about an hour later.

389
00:18:56,722 --> 00:18:59,054
All right.
Think I've got enough for now.

390
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:01,181
How'd I do?

391
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,589
Just fine.
Just fine.

392
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,479
I'll admit, the,
the Q-and-A is a little nerve-racking.

393
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:10,523
I see what everyone's talking about.

394
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:13,985
But I'm glad it was you.

395
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,146
It's, it's almost like...

396
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:20,997
fate...

397
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,829
brought us together again.

398
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,461
Maybe I'll have
a little talk with her.

399
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,584
I don't think she knows anything.
If she can be trusted.

400
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:36,967
Sure the leak
came from Cooper's Hawk?

401
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:40,303
- The explosion wasn't an accident.
- There was something to find there.

402
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:42,520
Somebody didn't want you to find it.

403
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:45,559
And she's the only one
that made it out alive.

404
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,023
Either
she's extraordinarily lucky...

405
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:49,187
Or she's involved.

406
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:53,184
Until we know which is which,
let's not let her out of our sight.

407
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:57,670
I need help, Doctor.

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,973
I can't tell whether this is
a metacarpal or a metatarsal bone.

409
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:06,361
Neither. No, it's the lower
extremity of a Lepus cuniculus.

410
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:08,622
A rabbit's foot?

411
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:10,959
Yeah. Look at the markings here
on the end.

412
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:13,993
It's where the metal
keychain cap was attached.

413
00:20:15,554 --> 00:20:17,716
Someone must've been carrying this
for good luck.

414
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,509
Wonder if they can get
their money back.

415
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:23,434
I am so sorry.
That was just a joke.

416
00:20:23,518 --> 00:20:25,373
It was not a good joke.

417
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,100
I realize that now.

418
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:29,317
DNA! I need more.

419
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:31,239
I finished I.D.'ing
the first four victims.

420
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,798
And, I'm ready for a new batch.

421
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:38,445
Mr. Palmer, if you've finished
your multispecies insensitivity...

422
00:20:38,957 --> 00:20:40,267
Here are two more.

423
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,918
It's going slow.

424
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,774
We've been having trouble separating out
the unique DNA strands.

425
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:47,899
I have faith.

426
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:50,182
If anyone can dig
through burnt-out remains and

427
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:52,626
find uncooked cellular material,
it's you two.

428
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:55,587
Remind me not to let you
give a speech at my wedding.

429
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,037
Ducky, Gibbs would like to know,

430
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:00,300
what the update is with the bodies
that we discovered.

431
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,424
There are still some spare parts,
but we've...

432
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:07,722
been able to reconstruct
enough of the

433
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:09,816
remains to get a firm count.

434
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,729
There are ten victims,
not counting the rabbit.

435
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,154
Are you sure?

436
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:17,359
You were expecting
something different?

437
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:21,561
I don't know what the rabbit is about,
but according to the personnel records,

438
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:24,008
there should've been 11 people
in the building when it blew up.

439
00:21:24,092 --> 00:21:27,353
I can assure you
our count is accurate...

440
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:28,836
Ten.

441
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,418
Susan Grady was not the only person
who made it out alive.

442
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:34,108
So who's lucky 11?

443
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:38,421
Well, wouldn't Susan know?
She was there, right?

444
00:21:38,904 --> 00:21:41,212
Are you guys sure that we can trust her?
Because I am not.

445
00:21:41,522 --> 00:21:43,529
And why, may I ask, is that?

446
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:45,145
Come on, Ducky.

447
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,931
Everybody know Susan's taken
a little shine to McGee.

448
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:50,308
That has nothing to do with it.

449
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,962
I mean, McGee... he's...

450
00:21:52,215 --> 00:21:55,772
a capable investigator, but when
it comes to matters of the heart,

451
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,774
he can be a bit naive.

452
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:01,100
Are you talking from experience?

453
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,631
That's classified.

454
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,219
Just think about his last girlfriend.
She tried to kill him.

455
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,609
I get it.

456
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:12,038
You're trying to cover McGee,
like a protective hen.

457
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,541
Or an over-protective panther.

458
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:19,587
If Susan can't tell you
who lucky number 11 is, I can.

459
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:21,855
Just keep her out of my hair.

460
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,349
- Should we tell her?
- No way.

461
00:22:25,765 --> 00:22:26,965
Tell her what?

462
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:29,805
<i>Keep pumping.</i>

463
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:31,187
<i>How firm do you like it?</i>

464
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,524
<i>A little harder.</i>

465
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:34,771
<i>Don't want to get a stiff back.</i>

466
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:36,954
<i>You're pretty good at this.</i>

467
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:38,115
<i>Top of the line.</i>

468
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:40,918
Any more, I'd think it's gonna pop.

469
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:47,120
And in my lab.

470
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:48,877
What?

471
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:53,246
Listen, Abby, I volunteered

472
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,195
your lab for Susan to crash in.

473
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,516
If it's that big of a problem,
I can...

474
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,895
have her stay at my place, I guess.

475
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:03,193
No problem.

476
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,825
No problem, and there's pillows
in the ballistics room.

477
00:23:07,882 --> 00:23:09,721
Already got them.
Thank you.

478
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,925
Great.

479
00:23:11,881 --> 00:23:13,850
Well, if you need anything,

480
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,984
I'll be closing in
on the killer in the next room.

481
00:23:20,302 --> 00:23:22,089
I don't think she likes me.

482
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,920
Well, I wouldn't read too much into it.
Abby sometimes...

483
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:29,779
One second.

484
00:23:30,107 --> 00:23:31,826
Need to check something.

485
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:39,556
I just wouldn't read
too much into it.

486
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:43,463
Are you guys really closing in
on the killer?

487
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,174
Well, unfortunately, all of...

488
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,829
Cooper's internal records
were destroyed in the explosion.

489
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:49,420
It was likely the point.

490
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:51,799
What? Something wrong?

491
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:55,975
What if I told you not

492
00:23:56,712 --> 00:23:58,804
all of the records were destroyed?

493
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,277
Then, I'd ask you to explain.

494
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:05,985
You know, I took copies
of polygraph interviews

495
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:07,919
and background data home.

496
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:10,615
I know it was
a serious breach of protocol.

497
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,470
- Then why'd you do it?
- I was studying the data,

498
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:16,079
hoping to improve
my people-reading skills.

499
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,706
I'm really good at what I do.

500
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:22,524
I can read anyone like a book
with my machines.

501
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:24,831
When it comes to doing it blind,

502
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:26,755
I'm, you know, blind.

503
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,142
It's probably why I've had
such bad luck with men.

504
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:33,429
I was actually voted "Least Likely
to Take a Hint" in high school.

505
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,307
Really? I can't imagine.
Listen...

506
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,157
the data at your house...

507
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:39,217
it's important evidence.
We need to go get it now.

508
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:42,028
We don't have to.
Actually, it's on my desktop computer.

509
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:44,243
We can tunnel in from here.
All we need...

510
00:24:44,327 --> 00:24:47,484
An open port through our firewall
and an external IP address.

511
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:49,320
I'm already locked and loaded.

512
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:52,679
I just need your log-in information.

513
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:59,247
So, um, the interviews are
digitized by date, but...

514
00:25:00,593 --> 00:25:01,916
What's going on?

515
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,054
You're not mirroring this
in the other room, are you?

516
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:05,378
This is not me.

517
00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:07,255
Someone else is accessing my files.

518
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,507
- Do you have a webcam?
- Yeah.

519
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,766
All right. Remote-activating it.

520
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:16,430
Oh, my God!
Someone's in my house.

521
00:25:18,426 --> 00:25:19,726
Try and block access here.

522
00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:26,953
He's taking the computer, McGee.

523
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:37,271
Abby's working on enhancing the image,
but I wouldn't hold your breath.

524
00:25:37,524 --> 00:25:40,497
Whoever was after Susan...
they disappeared before we got there.

525
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,928
The door was forced,
and the place was ransacked.

526
00:25:43,012 --> 00:25:45,299
You said you were still able
to download some of the data?

527
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,546
Managed to capture a portion
of Cooper's client directory,

528
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,257
but was unable to get
any actual polygraph files.

529
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:54,469
We're reconstructing what we have,
but it's not much.

530
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:56,180
Witnesses?

531
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:59,307
Well, the neighbor
did report seeing someone lurking,

532
00:25:59,703 --> 00:26:01,646
but couldn't give
a useful description.

533
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,687
Said the suspect seemed
to be waiting for Susan.

534
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,397
- Eventually got tired of waiting.
- Susan have any idea who?

535
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,986
Come on. She's the sole survivor.
She must know something.

536
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,948
If she does, she doesn't know what it's.
I spent the night up with her.

537
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:17,693
We know one thing.
Whatever she knows...

538
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:19,710
It was worth killing for.

539
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:21,984
Abs. What do you got?

540
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:24,249
<i>The missing employee was Gus Templeton,
the janitor.</i>

541
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,441
Nice work.

542
00:26:26,942 --> 00:26:29,087
Abby's got an I.D.
on the missing employee.

543
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:31,788
Gus Templeton.
The janitor?

544
00:26:31,872 --> 00:26:33,753
Why was he not at work
during the explosion?

545
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:35,176
I don't know. Find out.

546
00:26:36,447 --> 00:26:38,763
I've got to update
all the interested parties.

547
00:26:42,732 --> 00:26:44,846
Boss, can I go with Tony
instead of Ziva?

548
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:47,264
I'm sorry, it's just,
I've been here all night.

549
00:26:47,348 --> 00:26:49,237
I got...
I'm fighting the cabin fever.

550
00:26:55,971 --> 00:26:57,365
Go on, get out of here.

551
00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:04,330
Can I give you some lady advice?

552
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,780
I'd rather get
a lap dance from a nun, Tony.

553
00:27:10,706 --> 00:27:12,958
Listen,
when Jimmy Palmer's out-girling you,

554
00:27:13,487 --> 00:27:15,165
trust me, you need my advice.

555
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:17,372
I think you should give
the girl a chance.

556
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,650
You never have.
Maybe you should.

557
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:20,886
She's a nice girl.

558
00:27:21,978 --> 00:27:23,748
That's very adult of you.

559
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:27,049
It's not me.
It's her.

560
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:29,639
Something about her.
I can't put my finger on it,

561
00:27:29,723 --> 00:27:32,396
but I think she's got a really nice butt
underneath those blouses.

562
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,673
That is more like it.

563
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:41,326
NCIS. We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

564
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:43,201
Mind if we come inside?

565
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,270
Actually,
we can do this out here. That's fine.

566
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:52,795
Where were you last night?

567
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,673
In my bathroom...

568
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:56,719
throwing up.

569
00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:58,217
Bad sushi.

570
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,054
Been there the last two days.

571
00:28:03,906 --> 00:28:05,695
You hear about the fire at Cooper's?

572
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,254
I'm the janitor.

573
00:28:07,338 --> 00:28:10,669
If someone wanted to torch the place,
how would I know anything about it?

574
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:12,341
Well, the thing is,

575
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:15,755
we told the media to report
the fire as an accident.

576
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:17,300
Never mentioned arson.

577
00:28:19,863 --> 00:28:22,992
That's the janitor, but I don't
remember him looking quite so green.

578
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,349
<i>I told your agents
I don't know nothin'.</i>

579
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:26,329
<i>I know that.</i>

580
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:28,121
I got an issue with it.

581
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,530
What's that?

582
00:28:32,048 --> 00:28:33,198
You're lying.

583
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:35,607
That's it?

584
00:28:37,604 --> 00:28:39,049
I must have missed something.

585
00:28:39,287 --> 00:28:41,486
There are many subtle tells

586
00:28:41,774 --> 00:28:43,388
to indicate a person is lying.

587
00:28:43,841 --> 00:28:46,974
Eye contact, body positioning,
micro-expressions.

588
00:28:48,023 --> 00:28:50,190
But with Gibbs, it is all "gut",

589
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:51,562
as you say.

590
00:28:52,391 --> 00:28:53,692
Is he ever wrong?

591
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:56,524
Not that I remember.

592
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,153
I don't have much of a gut.
I never have.

593
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:06,411
I actually thought

594
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,920
Tim really liked me,
and he was just...

595
00:29:10,575 --> 00:29:12,417
playing hard to get.

596
00:29:12,654 --> 00:29:15,896
Perhaps he is...
and just doesn't know it.

597
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:19,752
You definitely provoke
a strong response in him.

598
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:22,148
Yeah.
The response to run.

599
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:26,097
<i>Why would I lie?</i>

600
00:29:29,764 --> 00:29:31,537
I got ten reasons right here.

601
00:29:32,517 --> 00:29:33,741
Look at 'em.

602
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:36,232
'Cause somebody's
going down for this.

603
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:37,466
Please.

604
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,318
You know what my problem is?

605
00:29:39,635 --> 00:29:42,738
My only suspect
makes 30 grand a year,

606
00:29:42,922 --> 00:29:46,033
and he just spent $40,000
on a damn new fishing boat.

607
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:49,976
They'll kill me.

608
00:29:50,232 --> 00:29:52,025
They already killed
everyone at Cooper's.

609
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,332
No, you killed 'em.

610
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:56,002
And that's exactly
what the jury's gonna see. Look at 'em!

611
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,612
I had some gambling debts.

612
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,358
These guys...
they show up at my place and...

613
00:30:16,335 --> 00:30:17,815
they agree to wipe it all out.

614
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,209
What it cost you?

615
00:30:28,615 --> 00:30:29,978
My access card.

616
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:34,178
<i>Said they were gonna pose
as computer technicians,</i>

617
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:38,896
<i>and my I.D. would give
them access</i> to every room.

618
00:30:39,657 --> 00:30:41,264
I don't know what they wanted.

619
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,052
And they didn't say nothing
about killing anyone.

620
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,982
I would never have helped them
otherwise.

621
00:30:51,165 --> 00:30:52,225
I want names.

622
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:57,108
Lifted prints
from the janitor's place.

623
00:30:57,192 --> 00:30:59,189
This is Peter and Arnold Rafferty.

624
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:03,569
Started with petty theft as teens.
Moved on to boosting cars.

625
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,909
Graduated to muscle
for organized crime.

626
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:07,155
Familiar?

627
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:09,575
Those are the guys
who came in to fix the computers.

628
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:11,458
Probably the ones that disabled it.

629
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:14,429
Their names were mentioned 127 times

630
00:31:14,513 --> 00:31:16,832
in Stefano Delmar's testimony.

631
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:20,757
I'm guessing they found out where he was
hiding and went and got some payback.

632
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:23,339
Then broke into my house
to destroy my files.

633
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:24,815
You have to catch them.

634
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,331
Now. Like, right now.

635
00:31:27,981 --> 00:31:30,011
- We're working on it.
- We have hit a Shamu.

636
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:32,932
- Does she mean snafu?
- Roll with it.

637
00:31:33,153 --> 00:31:35,266
We were able to track
the Rafferty brothers' movements

638
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,076
prior to them destroying
Cooper's Hawk security.

639
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,564
- Then what?
- Nothing.

640
00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:42,900
Fornell and his beard are running
contacts, but they've gone underground.

641
00:31:43,128 --> 00:31:44,944
Must've knew an indictment
was coming soon.

642
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:45,783
Maybe.

643
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:48,401
But I don't think
that's why they disappeared.

644
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:50,367
<i>Monsieur Gibbs, s'il vous plait.</i>

645
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:53,286
There's foulness afoot.

646
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,605
First things first, Gibbs:

647
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:59,083
the Rafferty definitely killed Delmar
and the petty officer.

648
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:01,043
I found their DNA on both victims.

649
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:04,775
Second, the Fire Marshal
finally issued his report.

650
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,135
He's some sort of frustrated novelist or
something, but it's a pretty good read.

651
00:32:11,574 --> 00:32:12,524
Nutshell.

652
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:17,810
The murder scene is not the only place
that I found the Rafferty's DNA.

653
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,062
They never made it out
of Cooper's alive.

654
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:23,463
- All the bodies were accounted for?
- And... they were.

655
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,610
The Fire Marshal scraped this

656
00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:27,695
at the source of the explosion.

657
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:29,585
It's ash, Gibbs.

658
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:30,919
It's human ash.

659
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,990
The Rafferty brothers
left no bodies,

660
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:35,411
because they were literally incinerated
by the explosion.

661
00:32:35,795 --> 00:32:37,370
So who broke into Susan's house?

662
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,587
It gets better.

663
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:40,934
The Fire Marshal traced
the source of the explosion

664
00:32:41,018 --> 00:32:42,939
to Cooper's computer room
in the basement.

665
00:32:43,023 --> 00:32:45,337
And the explosive was very small.

666
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:46,454
Didn't look small.

667
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:47,817
But it was.

668
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:51,052
The explosive was designed
to fry the servers

669
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,012
that were holding computer records,
not to kill anyone.

670
00:32:54,131 --> 00:32:57,933
But the explosion penetrated the gas
main of the building, and kaboom.

671
00:32:58,165 --> 00:32:59,602
Only the records are targeted?

672
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:01,187
I know what you're thinking.

673
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,823
Delmar's testimony
ratting out the Rafferty

674
00:33:03,907 --> 00:33:05,316
is already on the record, so?

675
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:08,657
So, what were they trying to hide?

676
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:20,681
They went to a lot of trouble
to destroy Cooper's records.

677
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:21,574
Why?

678
00:33:21,658 --> 00:33:23,374
Not to cover
their connection to Delmar.

679
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:26,796
- His testimony's already on record.
- What else was in those computers?

680
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:30,488
Just spoke with the company
that handles Cooper's I.T.

681
00:33:30,572 --> 00:33:32,385
The server
that they specifically downloaded

682
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:35,346
houses Cooper's polygraph files.

683
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:40,908
What?

684
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:42,669
What was in those files?

685
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:48,350
Audio recordings
of the polygraph examinees.

686
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:51,980
Their physiological data,
post-test analysis...

687
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,405
Questions, answers.

688
00:33:54,693 --> 00:33:55,991
Wavy lines next to them.

689
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,661
Questions, you know,
involving each case,

690
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:02,143
and the standard ones we start with.
You've pretty much heard them already.

691
00:34:02,227 --> 00:34:04,667
They're almost identical
to the ones we do here.

692
00:34:06,107 --> 00:34:08,927
Agent Gibbs has never taken
a polygraph exam.

693
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:12,792
Ever?

694
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,250
This won't hurt a bit.

695
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,257
Wouldn't miss this
for the world, huh?

696
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:24,556
He's been dodging this for years.

697
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:31,152
If you could just make some room.

698
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:37,283
Where are you thinking
of clipping that thing?

699
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,453
It's for the sphincter sensor.

700
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,067
I usually set this up beforehand.

701
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:57,720
All you need now is a buzzer.

702
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,390
No, nothing like that.
That'd make the testee too nervous.

703
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,803
All right, let's begin.

704
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:17,794
Is your name Leroy Jethro Gibbs?

705
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,569
Were you born in Stillwater,
Pennsylvania?

706
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,880
Have you ever stolen more
than a hundred dollars in cash

707
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,815
or property from an employer?

708
00:35:36,422 --> 00:35:38,223
That one gets me every time.

709
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:41,741
Have you ever committed espionage
for a foreign country?

710
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:47,934
Have you ever divulged
classified information?

711
00:35:50,926 --> 00:35:52,816
Have you ever committed a felony?

712
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,662
Could you answer
the question please?

713
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:12,310
That's enough.

714
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,636
Something wrong, Agent Gibbs?

715
00:36:17,034 --> 00:36:18,259
What happens if you fail?

716
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:20,920
At NCIS,
you lose your security clearance.

717
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:23,164
- Usually your job.
- Same at FBI.

718
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,641
The CEO of Cooper's Hawk
was pushing for

719
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,743
its use in more areas
of federal employment.

720
00:36:28,054 --> 00:36:30,965
He even convinced several congressional
committees to give them a test run.

721
00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:34,024
I finally decoded the data fragment
that McGee pulled from the computer.

722
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:36,068
It's a list
of the past year's clients.

723
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,071
It's a veritable who's who
of Senate confirmation appointees.

724
00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:45,405
Well, how about that?

725
00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:47,426
Thanks, Curt.

726
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:51,601
Boys.

727
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,418
I didn't realize we were making this
a regular thing.

728
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:58,132
You were a Cooper's client.

729
00:36:59,068 --> 00:37:00,342
Skipping the small talk?

730
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,928
We need an explanation, Your Honor.

731
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,806
This is the big leagues.

732
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:07,850
Judge?

733
00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:10,820
Two years ago,

734
00:37:10,904 --> 00:37:14,110
I sat on a circuit court bench
in a small town in Illinois

735
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,949
when I was hand-picked
for a federal spot.

736
00:37:17,225 --> 00:37:20,529
Do you know how much combing
and sifting takes place

737
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,535
during judicial
confirmation hearings?

738
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,530
I wanted to make sure
nothing embarrassing

739
00:37:24,614 --> 00:37:26,619
would surface before the nomination.

740
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,758
- Personally embarrassing?
- Maybe.

741
00:37:29,172 --> 00:37:31,248
You want someone digging up
your skeletons?

742
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:35,736
So, that's why you went to them?

743
00:37:36,851 --> 00:37:38,130
As a dry run.

744
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,799
Take a dry run
at that polygraph machine?

745
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:43,037
Learn how to beat it?

746
00:37:43,121 --> 00:37:45,804
To get accustomed to it.
I had never taken one before.

747
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:49,976
The committee was just experimenting
with polygraphs as part of the vetting.

748
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:53,710
And my nervousness
could have derailed the confirmation.

749
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,648
Not nervous
around the machine anymore?

750
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:56,986
Nope.

751
00:37:58,851 --> 00:37:59,599
Good.

752
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,862
Then you won't mind taking
another one.

753
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,991
What exactly do you think she knows?

754
00:38:06,522 --> 00:38:07,992
With her clearance level?

755
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:10,345
Everything.

756
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:13,874
Can't just accuse a sitting judge
of being part of a criminal conspiracy.

757
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,460
I'm just going to ask her
a few questions, Leon.

758
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:20,547
As a judge
in Skokie County, Illinois,

759
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,090
did you preside over the case
of People vs Perkins?

760
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:24,080
Yes.

761
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:27,554
The outcome was Perkins' conviction
on three counts of murder?

762
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:29,431
Yes, you have the file.

763
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:39,288
After the trial, primary witness
against Perkins went missing.

764
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:41,991
You know what happened to him?

765
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,946
Sorry about that. I forgot to mention
I had one of my agents,

766
00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:55,082
rig up all the bells and whistles.

767
00:38:58,357 --> 00:39:00,379
FBI never found the witness.

768
00:39:02,093 --> 00:39:06,093
Similar to the missing witnesses
in the recent string of RICO cases.

769
00:39:07,737 --> 00:39:09,806
Last one ended up in your court.

770
00:39:10,288 --> 00:39:12,425
Stefano Delmar was granted immunity

771
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:14,690
after confessing
to multiple murders.

772
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,730
You know what happened to him?

773
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:19,772
<i>Yes.</i>

774
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:24,283
Can you tolerate
watching bad guys walk,

775
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:27,719
because their testimony
convicts even worse guys?

776
00:39:31,975 --> 00:39:33,365
Is that what you call

777
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:36,331
the "occasional inequities
of the system"?

778
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:39,827
Did you leak identities
of protected witnesses

779
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,068
to people
who had grudges against them?

780
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:46,717
Did you use Cooper
to become a better liar

781
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,054
in order to mete out vigilante justice
from a higher bench?

782
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,560
You accuse me of what?

783
00:39:56,846 --> 00:40:00,773
Of targeting rats
who bail out of a sinking ship?

784
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:04,251
Without a shred
of admissible evidence...

785
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,987
I'll have your badges.

786
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,530
She is right.

787
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:17,677
Was murder by proxy.

788
00:40:19,747 --> 00:40:22,158
The Rafferty Brothers
did her dirty work.

789
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:25,713
Their little mistake took out
more than she intended,

790
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,569
but it also means

791
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:31,762
that everyone connected
with those murders is dead.

792
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,100
No evidence she was involved
in any crime.

793
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:38,519
Just the break-in.

794
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:42,399
That was the first...

795
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,362
actual boots-on-the-ground crime

796
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,861
that you committed yourself.

797
00:40:48,264 --> 00:40:51,612
Did the Rafferty alert you
that those files were copied?

798
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:54,045
Or did you just lift that
from my own update?

799
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:56,305
Very few people had
that information.

800
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:59,890
You really think you're such a natural
that you didn't leave behind

801
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:02,835
a single red hair?

802
00:41:03,617 --> 00:41:05,462
You never faced your victims,

803
00:41:05,778 --> 00:41:07,295
but you still murdered them.

804
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,342
You know, it doesn't matter
that you think they had it coming.

805
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:12,801
You were appointed judge.

806
00:41:13,286 --> 00:41:14,939
Not jury and executioner.

807
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,500
We did find a hair at your place.

808
00:41:22,584 --> 00:41:24,000
There might have been a red one.

809
00:41:24,084 --> 00:41:26,681
So was he bluffing or not?
I just couldn't tell.

810
00:41:26,765 --> 00:41:29,300
Hey, Susan,
start in the shallow end.

811
00:41:29,384 --> 00:41:31,947
Reading Gibbs' mind is...
it's like re...

812
00:41:35,058 --> 00:41:36,008
Dear God...

813
00:41:36,284 --> 00:41:38,065
someone fed him after midnight.

814
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:40,054
Jimmy, what happened to you?

815
00:41:40,307 --> 00:41:42,291
Turns out
I am really allergic to henna.

816
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,513
But...

817
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,078
I can't reach back there, so,
so do you think you guys could...?

818
00:41:46,162 --> 00:41:48,473
- Late for a squash game.
- I get the hell out of here.

819
00:41:48,557 --> 00:41:51,032
- Please, guys, it really itches!
- That's what girlfriends are for.

820
00:41:51,116 --> 00:41:53,618
- Okay, I can get the top part...
- Stay, Stay!

821
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:56,343
- It maybe be actually very contagious.
- I need help.

822
00:41:56,427 --> 00:41:59,433
- I may have to hurt you massively.
- She'll do it.

823
00:42:01,334 --> 00:42:03,103
Susan, you want to get some dinner?

824
00:42:03,748 --> 00:42:05,886
You're asking me to dinner?

825
00:42:07,794 --> 00:42:10,104
Yeah, seeing you in action,

826
00:42:10,188 --> 00:42:12,311
you know,
you doing what you do, it's...

827
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,656
It's interesting to me.
I'd like to know more.

828
00:42:14,937 --> 00:42:15,937
You would?

829
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,492
Yes, I would.

830
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,759
Yeah, but...

831
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:23,081
I don't think you really would.

832
00:42:26,107 --> 00:42:28,731
But it's, it's sweet of you to say.

833
00:42:33,597 --> 00:42:35,609
No, I actually would.

834
00:42:36,706 --> 00:42:38,090
I really would.

835
00:42:40,459 --> 00:42:41,359
I would!
