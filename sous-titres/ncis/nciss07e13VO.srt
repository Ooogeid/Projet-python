<i>Ay, Dios mio.</i>

3
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,449
Mr. Parsons,
this time it's going to cost you extra.

4
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:29,784
Hello?

5
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,559
Mr. Parsons?

6
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:39,979
<i>Maldiga gato!</i>

7
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:41,850
What are you doing in there?

8
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,977
Mr. Parsons.

www.Team-NCIS.com

13
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,803
Hello, Director.

14
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,417
Agents DiNozzo and David.

15
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:40,099
They were supposed to contact me
before they left with our witness.

16
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:43,728
- I should have gotten a call by now.
- Yeah, their flight was delayed.

17
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:46,217
Are you sure about that?

18
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:48,477
Paris can be very hard to leave.

19
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,941
Not for them. No.

20
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,028
Tony and Ziva don't like
traveling together much.

21
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:55,123
Actually, they don't like doing
much of anything together.

22
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:56,474
I think it's safe to say

23
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,784
that they're not enjoying
themselves very much.

24
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,848
SECNAV wants that witness here
by tomorrow morning.

25
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,124
Where the hell are they?

26
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:13,973
<i>Bonjour</i>, McGee.

27
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:15,519
Everything's fine.

28
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:19,472
We are leaving for the airport as soon
as Tony returns from seeing the sights.

29
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:20,740
Here.

30
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:21,891
Finally.

31
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,559
Okay, McGee. <i>Au revoir.</i>

32
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,144
Tell McGee I love Paree!

33
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:27,647
Why don't you tell him yourself
when we get back.

34
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:30,067
We must pick up our witness
at the embassy. Come on.

35
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,943
Hold your horses.

36
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,418
One day...

37
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:36,656
just isn't enough
in this town, is it?

38
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,651
I get why artists love it.
Something about the light.

39
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,422
Picasso, Rodin.

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,632
Cancan girls at the Moulin Rouge.

41
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:47,625
This is not a vacation, Tony.

42
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:51,041
But it is a beautiful day.

43
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:54,924
Why are you in such a pleasant mood?

44
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:56,804
What's wrong with you?

45
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:58,599
I slept well last night.

46
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:00,157
Why, didn't you?

47
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:03,955
You certainly looked...
comfy enough.

48
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,365
Paris.

49
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:11,688
France.

50
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:13,693
It's really not
what I thought it would be.

51
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:15,403
You know?

52
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,239
Of course, all I had to go on was
a French arms dealer and his...

53
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:20,462
rather fetching daughter.

54
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:23,494
<i>C'est la vie.</i>
That's French for something.

55
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:26,581
"That's life". Let's go.

56
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,983
<i>Vite, vite.
Après vous.</i>

57
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:35,798
Here we go. Hop on.

58
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,594
I'm getting pretty good at this.

59
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:51,004
Flight is scheduled
to depart Paris at 16:30.

60
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,189
Keep me posted.

61
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,233
Grab your stuff.
We're going on a trip of our own.

62
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,193
Someplace exotic?

63
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:58,529
Oh, yeah...
Downtown.

64
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,907
- Just the two of us, Boss?
- Nope.

65
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:03,324
You, me, Ducky,

66
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:04,678
and a dead Marine.

67
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,332
Sergeant Mark Parsons.

68
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:11,866
Marine... Special Ops Command.

69
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,855
I feel it only appropriate,
that in Agent DiNozzo's absence,

70
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:19,467
I make an observation
about this unique crime scene.

71
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:21,385
Go for it, Duck.

72
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,747
A terrified Janet Leigh.

73
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:26,515
And the inability to enter
the shower for several weeks.

74
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:30,186
It's a reference to the film <i>Psycho</i>.

75
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:32,646
- There, feel better now?
- Yeah.

76
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,484
Yes,
apart from these feline scratches,

77
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:38,486
I see no obvious signs of trauma.

78
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,029
Got a time of death?

79
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,949
Rigor has resolved itself.

80
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,166
Postmortem lividity is fixed,

81
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,161
and I see several

82
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,693
fly ova in his nostrils and ears.

83
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,376
Ergo, this man succumbed

84
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,170
between 36 and 48 hours ago.

85
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:57,697
Killer got a head start.

86
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,632
No doubt that was the intention.

87
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,594
The sodium silicate
in crystal-based kitty litter is

88
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,512
a very effective odor absorber,

89
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:08,140
thereby preventing the smell

90
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,013
from alerting the neighbors.

91
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:13,396
Apart from the housekeeper,
he might have lain there,

92
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,147
undiscovered, for days.

93
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,250
Time to change the box.

94
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,763
I finished processing
the rest of the condo.

95
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:23,114
No signs of a struggle.

96
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,033
And there were quite a few high-dollar
items left out in plain sight.

97
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,328
- Not a robbery.
- Which begs another mystery.

98
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:32,557
Yeah, how does an E-5 Marine
making three grand a month

99
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:33,916
managed to live like this?

100
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:35,501
Precisely.

101
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:41,032
You know, I did find a safe bolted
inside a living room cabinet.

102
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:42,565
Let's go. Let's open it.

103
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,517
Seat 9-A.

104
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:51,350
Finally,
I'll get to catch up on my reading.

105
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,604
For a whistle-blower on a major defense
fraud scam, you seem awfully relaxed.

106
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,898
I have faith in you to protect me.

107
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,355
Most of our material witnesses
are frightened parasites.

108
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,736
I wish all the people we dealt with
were as nice as you.

109
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:06,499
I'm nice.

110
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,092
I just came across a wrong
in the world that

111
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,371
I could help make right.

112
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,000
We're protecting <i>Hayley Mills</i>.

113
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,348
You know, <i>Pollyanna</i>.

114
00:06:19,432 --> 00:06:21,047
Disney classic with a happy ending.

115
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:22,423
I like those.

116
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:24,036
Tony prefers <i>Bambi</i>,

117
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:25,676
where the mother dies.

118
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,345
And I'm not the nice one?

119
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,825
That must be him.

120
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,270
Excuse me?

121
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,816
NCIS.
Been looking for you.

122
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,510
I'm Agent David.

123
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:46,739
That is Agent DiNozzo.
And she is our witness.

124
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:49,212
Federal Air Marshal Art Neeley.

125
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:52,328
I already got a head count
and I cross-checked the passenger list

126
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:54,651
with federal offender databases.

127
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:56,582
All clear for takeoff.

128
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:59,060
<i>We've been cleared
to leave the gate.</i>

129
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:01,622
<i>We'll be getting under way just as soon
as everyone's in their seat,</i>

130
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:03,455
<i>with their seat belt fastened.
Thank you.</i>

131
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,286
If you wouldn't mind taking
your seat,

132
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,257
- we're ready to pull away.
- I'm also ready for my hot towel.

133
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:10,549
First class only, sir.
Sorry.

134
00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:14,933
And they say
the stimulus is working.

135
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,756
Real friendly.

136
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,695
Up here in first class.
Oh, sorry, business.

137
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,153
Business class.

138
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,788
All right, I think we're ready.

139
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,248
What do we got?

140
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,669
Watches.
Beautiful ones.

141
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:43,693
These look very expensive, Boss.

142
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:45,291
The folders, McGee.

143
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,510
Ah, yes.

144
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:53,527
Newspaper clippings.

145
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:56,642
All pertaining to a murder
investigation in New York City.

146
00:07:57,116 --> 00:08:01,105
The death of real estate mogul
Sam Thoresen six months ago.

147
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,245
Home invasion, nothing was stolen.

148
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,900
NYPD suspected a professional hit.
Case is still unsolved.

149
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:09,724
He was tracking the investigation.

150
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:13,200
Why? And why keep it locked
in the safe?

151
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,039
Making sure he got away clean.

152
00:08:16,193 --> 00:08:17,653
NYPD was right.

153
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:20,166
You thinking our dead Marine
was moonlighting as a hit man?

154
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:22,293
Or he had a new assignment.

155
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:28,096
Passport information.
Employment records.

156
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,618
Bank statements.

157
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,136
Unused round-trip ticket to Paris.

158
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,635
Same flight Tony and Ziva are on.

159
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,819
This isn't a scrapbook,
it's a <i>dossier</i>.

160
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:39,268
On his new target.

161
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:41,720
Nora Williams.

162
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:43,321
Our whistle-blower.

163
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:45,608
Our dead guy was going to kill her.

164
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,451
Sergeant Mark Parsons.

165
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,758
Members of his Special Ops team all said
that he was a good Marine, but a loner.

166
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,206
No family.
No close friends.

167
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,036
Apparently, our Marine-turned-hit man
really kept to himself.

168
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:06,698
The nature of the business.

169
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:10,181
Parsons was on leave when the real
estate mogul was shot in New York.

170
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:13,385
If ballistics match the gun
we found in his safe,

171
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:15,483
we've solved that case.

172
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:17,016
Too bad it's not ours.

173
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,824
Well, Abby's processing
his prepaid burn phone.

174
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:22,019
Could lead us to whoever hired him
to kill our witness.

175
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:23,818
Or who killed him.

176
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:27,501
Parsons' <i>dossier</i> on Nora Williams.

177
00:09:27,872 --> 00:09:29,276
He knew she was living in Paris

178
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,597
and that we were sent
to escort her back here.

179
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,096
Guy did his homework.

180
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,033
He had all of Nora's medical records,
phone records, info on family, friends.

181
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:37,826
Fiancé.

182
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,164
Daniel Sturgis. They are supposed
to be married in three months.

183
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:43,964
I'm going to need to talk to him.

184
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:45,539
He's already on his way.

185
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,303
It's the Paris case file
on Nora's testimony.

186
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:55,803
I tried to talk Nora out
of testifying against Beringer,

187
00:09:56,313 --> 00:10:00,015
but she has this,
infectious outlook on life that...

188
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:02,051
Ray Beringer's her boss.

189
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:04,071
Owner of Beringer Marine
Incorporated.

190
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:06,566
I told her...
not a guy you want to cross.

191
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:09,803
- You also work for him.
- At our DC headquarters,

192
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:11,184
here on the Navy Yard.

193
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:14,113
Nora and I met
in the accounting department,

194
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,654
before she was transferred
to the Paris branch.

195
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:19,887
Where she found the evidence
that Beringer was bilking the Navy.

196
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,161
For millions.

197
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,040
When a Navy fleet makes port
in a foreign country,

198
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:26,959
any needed repairs

199
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,738
are done
by a local maintenance company.

200
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,922
Beringer Marine is
a major port presence.

201
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:34,395
At the receiving end
of a lot of contracts.

202
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,136
Navy was paying for repairs
that weren't even requested.

203
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:39,359
Until Nora found documents

204
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,765
proving that Beringer was behind
the whole thing.

205
00:10:42,218 --> 00:10:44,952
Unfortunately,
those documents disappeared.

206
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,980
The only evidence
that we have is Nora's good memory.

207
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,065
Risking something coming here.

208
00:10:52,097 --> 00:10:54,111
We got nothing on Beringer
without her testimony.

209
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:56,905
Which is why we'll make sure
that nothing happens to her.

210
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:59,477
Well, can't you just arrest him now?

211
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:01,777
For hiring someone to kill her.

212
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,868
Beringer doesn't know anything
about Nora's testimony

213
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:06,415
or the case against him.

214
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:09,414
It's still under wraps
until she meets with the U.S. Attorney.

215
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:10,919
He must have found out somehow.

216
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,035
That's difficult to prove.

217
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,049
Our best agents are with her.

218
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:18,225
I hope so.

219
00:11:19,408 --> 00:11:21,387
She just wants to do what's right.

220
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:27,423
Just sort of feel like
you can use negative space to...

221
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:29,187
push the image, you know?

222
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,482
Sort of like a geometrical

223
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,335
thing with the light coming across.

224
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:37,069
I was trying to use
these sort of geometric lines

225
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:38,339
and spacing.

226
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:42,294
Sometimes I think maybe
I should have done something more...

227
00:11:42,696 --> 00:11:44,119
creative with my life.

228
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:47,398
No, I think you're
in the right profession.

229
00:11:48,613 --> 00:11:50,252
All right, <i>Annie Leibovitz</i>.

230
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,410
- What's wrong with my pictures?
- Okay, McGee, got it. Bye.

231
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,320
Well, they're sort of soulless,

232
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:58,092
analytical.
They look like...

233
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,469
- postcards or...
- Crime scene photos.

234
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,253
You just need people in them.

235
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,264
Happy people.

236
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,723
Living people.

237
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,900
Otherwise, they're just buildings.

238
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:10,918
Didn't you and Ziva go
sightseeing together?

239
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,790
We had enough "together".

240
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:16,312
We shared a flight and a hotel room.

241
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,588
It was the only one available.

242
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:26,501
That's how me and my fiancé met.

243
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:29,288
On the job, traveling on business.

244
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:30,808
Rule #12.

245
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,278
What's rule #12?

246
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:33,937
Our boss... he has a list of rules.

247
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,338
Rule #12 says
you should never date a coworker.

248
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,049
- My understanding can't be done.
- Should not be done.

249
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,192
How do you and your fiancé
make it work?

250
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:42,678
You two looking for advice?

251
00:12:44,017 --> 00:12:44,826
No way.

252
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,890
We do not always get along.

253
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:47,818
Ever.

254
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,981
So, what was
the phone call all about?

255
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,858
Gibbs and McGee are working
on a case.

256
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:57,666
Why are they calling us?

257
00:12:58,687 --> 00:12:59,528
In the air?

258
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,758
Does it have to do with me?

259
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,484
Is something wrong?

260
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,086
Not anymore.

261
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:11,540
Basilica of the Sacred Heart.

262
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:13,634
That's where Daniel proposed to me.

263
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:18,380
I'm gonna miss Paris, but at least
going to DC means I get to see him.

264
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,882
Gaston Leroux came up with the idea
for <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>

265
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,197
when the counterweight of the great
chandelier came crashing down

266
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:31,895
and crushed a female patron.

267
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,720
The grand and noble facade
of the Paris Opera House,

268
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:39,478
hiding a dark
and ignoble secret within.

269
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:43,304
Not unlike this fellow, Jethro.

270
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:47,178
Honorable Marine
masquerading as a hit man.

271
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,711
Other way around, Duck.

272
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:52,039
- You got any more metaphors?
- Well, Leroux's book is full of them.

273
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,334
He explores the dichotomy
between life and death,

274
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,044
truth and falsehood.

275
00:13:57,593 --> 00:13:59,997
- You got one.
- Well, like the phantom,

276
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:03,341
this man's body also masks
a deformation.

277
00:14:03,798 --> 00:14:05,886
- You found the cause of death?
- Indeed.

278
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:08,096
A fractured C-1 and 2 vertebrae.

279
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:09,681
Broke his neck?

280
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:12,984
There's an absence
of defensive wounds.

281
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:18,690
These fractures were caused by a single,
deliberate move.

282
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:20,317
Killer was precise?

283
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:21,697
And practiced.

284
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:24,905
Whoever killed
our Marine hit man was also

285
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,543
a trained professional.

286
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:28,286
Thanks, Duck.

287
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,910
Yeah, it's a long time
since I visited Paris.

288
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,205
Or went to the theater,
for that matter.

289
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:37,041
You asking me on a date, Duck?

290
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,365
<i>Can I come, too?</i>

291
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:40,754
- I'm on my way, Abs.
- <i>I know, I know,</i>

292
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,013
<i>but this couldn't wait.</i>

293
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:44,638
<i>After processing everything
from our dead guy's condo,</i>

294
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:46,307
<i>I found extra nothing.</i>

295
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:48,762
<i>All totally wiped down.
Almost like it was...</i>

296
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:50,297
A pro job? Yeah, I know.

297
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:53,035
<i>But I ran the burn phone
from Parsons' safe.</i>

298
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:55,921
<i>He only received one call
from one number.</i>

299
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,976
<i>I traced it to a residence
in Bethesda.</i>

300
00:14:58,318 --> 00:14:59,287
Give me a name.

301
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,286
<i>That's what I couldn't wait
to tell you.</i>

302
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:04,570
<i>The number belongs to Holly Snow.</i>

303
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:06,247
<i>The Holly Snow.</i>

304
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:07,980
<i>Hello?</i>

305
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:13,662
So you've heard of me, Agent McGee?

306
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,583
Yes, yes, I have.

307
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,627
By reputation and a few headlines.

308
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:23,088
You are DC madam
to the rich and powerful.

309
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,464
Talented, too.
At avoiding arrest.

310
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:26,967
You flatter me.

311
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:32,553
When did the love business
turn into the death business?

312
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:37,085
Excuse me?

313
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,355
Four days ago, you made
a call to Sergeant Mark Parsons.

314
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,638
- It was right before he was murdered.
- A hit.

315
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,318
Killed by a pro.

316
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:46,862
I had nothing to do with his death.

317
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,290
Yeah, we know that, but you did hire him
to kill Nora Williams.

318
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,366
Got a search warrant
for your office.

319
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,162
We found an online pay account
linking you

320
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:57,664
to several known
or suspected hit men.

321
00:15:57,931 --> 00:15:59,916
This time,
you were paying for their services.

322
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,047
To kill.

323
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,679
- Once a contractor...
- Listen,

324
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:04,880
I'm a matchmaker.

325
00:16:06,346 --> 00:16:07,984
I connect people online.

326
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,734
I never know what service
is being provided.

327
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:12,804
I never ask.

328
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,598
You think
a jury's gonna believe that?

329
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:18,303
- All this money for sex.
- It's not my money.

330
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:20,284
I'm not responsible for...

331
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:21,901
You're an accessory to murder.

332
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,524
You're providing a service.

333
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:26,526
You're more than responsible.

334
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,196
Who wanted Nora Williams dead?

335
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:32,866
Look, I don't know names.

336
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:39,286
But I can give you the account
that they used to wire me the money.

337
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,837
Half a million dollars.

338
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:49,848
The numbers.

339
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:55,251
I don't give it away, Agent Gibbs.

340
00:16:57,807 --> 00:16:59,226
My services cost.

341
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:04,904
- I'll take a plea deal.
- I didn't offer one.

342
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:06,968
Well, I suggest you do.

343
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:09,403
You might want to be quick about it.

344
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:10,949
Why is that?

345
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:13,800
You said Parsons was killed
by another pro.

346
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,283
I can think of 500,000 reasons
why that might be.

347
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:21,603
These contracts...

348
00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:23,272
are not exclusive.

349
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:26,259
Render the service,

350
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:28,043
reap the reward.

351
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:29,912
And,

352
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:32,988
people can be...

353
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,409
competitive.

354
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,808
A hit man killed a hit man.

355
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,429
So, whoever gets the kill

356
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:43,646
gets the cash.

357
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,273
Okay, understood.

358
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:56,226
Thank you, Gibbs.

359
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,078
Homeland Security officers
will be waiting for us when we land.

360
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:03,623
Outside the terminal,
an NCIS security detail will take over.

361
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,356
Not taking any chances,

362
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,794
in case your new hit man
tries something on the ground?

363
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,335
Which is why we must consider
the possibility that

364
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:13,326
they may try something on the plane,
where Nora's more vulnerable.

365
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,218
Any reason
to believe they're on board?

366
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:17,779
Stationary target.
Close quarters.

367
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:20,474
Modern-day Orient Express.

368
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,493
The killer would just need
an inconspicuous weapon.

369
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:24,895
Like what?

370
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,026
I've been doing this for a while,
and I doubt there's anything...

371
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,087
Headphone cables make
for a perfect garrote.

372
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:32,933
And plastic silverware is
not as safe as you may think.

373
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,611
I once killed a man
using a credit card.

374
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:39,743
I have been watching a guy.

375
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,863
Row 16.

376
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,779
Couple of rows
behind that girl knitting.

377
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:47,542
Aisle seat,
he's got his earphones on.

378
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:50,253
Manifest listed him as Steven Baker.

379
00:18:50,514 --> 00:18:54,092
He's been ignoring the flight attendants
and refused anything to eat or drink,

380
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:57,042
but he's gone to the lavatory
four times already.

381
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,471
It might be nothing, but...

382
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:01,161
We cannot take any chances.

383
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,222
Watch him.

384
00:19:04,237 --> 00:19:05,393
Come on!

385
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:06,878
I just got up.

386
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:13,860
- You all right?
- Yeah.

387
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:15,695
Look, a Slanket.

388
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,364
She looks comfortable.

389
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:19,612
Something I am not.

390
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,414
How much longer till we get there?

391
00:19:27,587 --> 00:19:28,792
Hours and hours.

392
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,469
Drink, ma'am?

393
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:34,714
No, I don't think so, Mr. Spock.

394
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:36,424
Is there a problem, sir?

395
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,927
Then can I have some water?

396
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:40,419
That is what this is.

397
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,809
- Bring us some new water.
- Excuse me?

398
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,922
I would like you to bring us
a fresh bottle of new water,

399
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:47,686
and open it in front of us.

400
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:51,793
Sorry.

401
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,944
- Got another one for the watch list.
- That one?

402
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:57,729
He's already on it.

403
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:04,077
Well, <i>merci beaucoup</i>.
Live long and prosper.

404
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,234
Of course.

405
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:12,210
You think someone's really trying
to kill me, don't you?

406
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,380
Is that a little bit of rain
in your sunny worldview, Mary Poppins?

407
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:20,174
Revealing the true nature
of the world isn't going to change

408
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,137
who I am, Agent DiNozzo.

409
00:20:23,743 --> 00:20:26,391
Maybe it's 'cause I'm in love, but
I don't think people are bad at heart.

410
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:33,651
U.S. Attorney's Office is dragging
their feet on a Holly Snow deal.

411
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:34,444
Why?

412
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:37,596
Higher-ups don't like being get into bed
with someone who keeps a black book.

413
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,126
- Might be opening up a can of worms.
- Let's talk about murder.

414
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,492
We'll get it. She's asking
for the world, and they'll get it.

415
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:43,992
- It takes time.
- Out of time.

416
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,854
That flight lands, I want to know
who we're looking for. McGee, go.

417
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:48,985
Well, assuming that our new hit man

418
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:51,458
has the same flight information
our dead hit man had,

419
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,778
been running background
on every passenger on the plane.

420
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:54,751
And?

421
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:56,922
No red flags,
but there is one problem.

422
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:00,310
- Air Marshal.
- Art Neeley.

423
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:02,552
He was not originally
assigned to the flight.

424
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,869
Requested an earlier
departure from Paris.

425
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:08,642
TSA denied the request, so he switched
duty assignments with someone else.

426
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:10,789
Really wanted to be
on this particular flight.

427
00:21:10,873 --> 00:21:12,854
- Four days ago, where was he?
- According to

428
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,324
his flight schedule,
Air Marshal Neeley was in DC

429
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:18,006
- when Sergeant Parsons was murdered.
- Get Ziva on the phone.

430
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,352
If Neeley is involved,

431
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:22,405
we don't want to spook the only other
guy on that plane that's got a gun.

432
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:34,695
I think you got the wrong bag.

433
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,027
You have a good eye.

434
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,862
Ziva, I found your book.

435
00:21:42,397 --> 00:21:43,261
Thank you.

436
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,178
Still studying American history?

437
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,932
I just finished The Twilight Saga.

438
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,518
I've been suggesting it to her.
It's very romantic.

439
00:21:52,993 --> 00:21:54,020
Excuse me.

440
00:21:55,473 --> 00:21:57,783
I just finished book four
if you want to borrow it.

441
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,233
Team Edward.

442
00:22:05,795 --> 00:22:07,003
Everything okay?

443
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:08,730
Not really.

444
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:10,709
She picked his pocket.

445
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:13,516
One of the good guys might not be.

446
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,461
Honey.

447
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,008
Call Abby, ask her to run
Neeley's incoming and outgoing calls.

448
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:24,843
On it, bossy.

449
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:31,290
What?

450
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:34,983
You guys say you don't get along,
but you make a great team.

451
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:37,334
It is not always so smooth,
believe me.

452
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,592
She's usually much snarkier.

453
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,719
I think Paris changed her.

454
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:50,386
Boss, I just got a call
from Navy Yard security.

455
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,337
There's been an incident
at Beringer Marine.

456
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:53,326
What happened?

457
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,035
Nora's fiancé Daniel
attacked Ray Beringer.

458
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:58,701
I lost my temper.

459
00:22:58,785 --> 00:23:01,075
You took some candy-cane cheap shot
at our prime suspect.

460
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:03,046
- It wasn't smart.
- I'm sorry.

461
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:05,592
After a staff meeting,

462
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:08,674
Beringer pulled me aside
and made a crack about Nora,

463
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:10,972
about her taking vacation time.

464
00:23:11,498 --> 00:23:13,516
- He's taunting me, Agent Gibbs.
- Maybe.

465
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:16,811
It proves that he knows about Nora,
right? This should help you.

466
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,522
He's the one

467
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,399
who hired someone to kill her.

468
00:23:22,186 --> 00:23:23,545
You need to go home

469
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:25,141
and let us do our job.

470
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:28,877
It's just I...

471
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:31,910
I feel helpless.

472
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:43,129
Kid's lucky I don't kick
his ass to the curb.

473
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:45,972
Base security already
handled the situation.

474
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:47,300
Why is NCIS here?

475
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:48,909
Nora Williams.

476
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:53,056
What about her?

477
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:55,486
You tell me.

478
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:59,409
I know she's a great employee

479
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:02,737
and that she's sleeping with that naive
jerk who just clocked me.

480
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:05,110
Like I told security,
it was just a joke.

481
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,640
I like jokes.

482
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:11,596
Nora works for me
at our Paris office.

483
00:24:11,797 --> 00:24:13,690
I heard she was taking some...

484
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:15,578
vacation time.

485
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:18,682
Now, accountants are supposed
to be good with figures, right?

486
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,125
So I asked Daniel
if he was going to get a chance

487
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,078
to use hers while she was in town.

488
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,481
I didn't mean anything by it.

489
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:28,299
Unless I'm missing something here.

490
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:31,367
The kid's still angry
Nora took the transfer to Paris,

491
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:32,637
took it out on me.

492
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:37,102
Are we done?
I got a company to run.

493
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:49,106
What did Abby find?

494
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,073
No connection between our Air Marshal
and our dead marine.

495
00:24:52,248 --> 00:24:54,771
I still do not trust him.
We should at least take his weapon.

496
00:24:54,855 --> 00:24:56,703
If we are wrong,
we can apologize later.

497
00:24:56,902 --> 00:24:58,288
Where is our federal flyboy?

498
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,195
Last time I saw him,
he was heading for the restroom.

499
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,878
He has been in there for a while.

500
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:05,920
Maybe it was
that vacuum-packed sushi for dinner.

501
00:25:06,522 --> 00:25:08,110
I'm a little growly myself.

502
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:10,626
Remain in your seat.

503
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:20,058
Arty?

504
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,416
You get sucked in?

505
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:27,762
- I'm gonna pick the lock.
- There is no need.

506
00:25:39,353 --> 00:25:40,413
His gun is missing.

507
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:42,103
Is this the queue?

508
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:44,413
Out of order.

509
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,176
Someone made quite a mess in there.

510
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:01,603
Well, technically, flying still
is the safest way to travel.

511
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:04,007
Tell that to him.

512
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,839
Turns out Neeley was divorced
with a 12-year-old daughter.

513
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,800
Requested
the earlier flight from Paris

514
00:26:11,262 --> 00:26:13,466
to get home in time to see
his daughter's school play.

515
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,617
Well, we've got nothing to tie Neeley
to the first dead hit man,

516
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,787
so why risk murdering
an Air Marshal mid-flight?

517
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:21,939
Well, he could have stumbled
onto something,

518
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:23,665
got too close to our killer.

519
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,677
Or they just wanted his gun.

520
00:26:25,923 --> 00:26:26,894
Either way...

521
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,921
Confirms our killer
is on that plane.

522
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:33,016
The closest airport now is Dulles.
They land in two hours.

523
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:36,729
Heard you spoke to Ray Beringer.

524
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:39,783
Word travels.

525
00:26:40,528 --> 00:26:42,351
Beringer made a call to SECNAV.

526
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:46,181
He has the impression
that NCIS is investigating him.

527
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:48,356
You had to shake that tree.

528
00:26:49,823 --> 00:26:51,466
Needed something to drop, Leon.

529
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:55,382
Then you'll be pleased to know that
Holly Snow's plea deal came through.

530
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,990
She's on her way back in.

531
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:06,839
Ladies and gentleman,
if I could have your attention, please.

532
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:10,372
Due to a mechanical issue,
the forward lavatory is out of order.

533
00:27:10,634 --> 00:27:13,103
<i>We ask that you please use
one of the other facilities on board.</i>

534
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,411
He's dead?

535
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:45,455
Someone killed him?

536
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:51,081
This is really happening, isn't it?
He's on the plane.

537
00:27:51,165 --> 00:27:52,230
So are we.

538
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:56,757
How did it happen?

539
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,938
It is not important.

540
00:27:59,152 --> 00:28:00,471
I'd like to know.

541
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:02,082
A knitting needle.

542
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:05,776
They took it from a sleeping passenger
and stabbed the Air Marshal in the neck.

543
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,954
You are so direct,

544
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:14,162
so... honest,

545
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,048
so different from him.

546
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,466
Tony and I have different...

547
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,829
approaches.

548
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:23,646
Yet complementary.

549
00:28:24,297 --> 00:28:25,713
You sure you two never...?

550
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:28,160
Positive.

551
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:30,241
Definitely no.

552
00:28:33,236 --> 00:28:35,703
Why do you keep
on asking about Tony and I?

553
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:39,240
You're like me and Daniel...

554
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:41,134
a good fit.

555
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,837
Besides, Paris is a romantic city,
and you guys shared a room, so I...

556
00:28:44,921 --> 00:28:46,077
I took the couch.

557
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:50,740
Otherwise, Tony would have whined
the entire flight about his...

558
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:52,867
his back.

559
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,107
Talk about a nightmare
at 20,000 feet.

560
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,276
"There's something on the wing.

561
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,639
"Some... thing."

562
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:07,581
Classic Shatner doing
<i>The Twilight Zone</i> there, Ducky.

563
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:09,455
<i>I am well aware of that, Anthony.</i>

564
00:29:10,286 --> 00:29:12,458
Well, thank goodness
for this in-flight Wi-Fi.

565
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:15,837
Does this qualify us for...
mile-high club?

566
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:17,316
<i>Certainly not.</i>

567
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,425
<i>I am surprised to hear
that you are not already a member.</i>

568
00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:22,593
I never said I wasn't.

569
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:25,682
<i>Perhaps if you angled me over
and down a bit,</i>

570
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:28,724
- <i>I could get a better view of his neck.</i>
- All right.

571
00:29:29,444 --> 00:29:31,143
Roger, dodger, you got that?

572
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:36,107
<i>The use of the knitting needle
was both crude and effective.</i>

573
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:39,402
<i>He was aiming for the space
between the cervical vertebrae</i>

574
00:29:39,706 --> 00:29:42,697
<i> in an endeavor, no doubt,
to sever the spinal cord.</i>

575
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,783
- Death would have been quick.
<i>- And silent.</i>

576
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,972
<i>He could have unlocked the door,
jabbed in the needle</i>

577
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:49,704
<i>and disappeared
with a minimum of fuss.</i>

578
00:29:50,366 --> 00:29:53,916
<i>If only we had high resolution,
I could confirm that hypothesis.</i>

579
00:29:54,534 --> 00:29:56,298
All right,
hold on one second, Ducky.

580
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,296
I've got an idea.

581
00:30:00,695 --> 00:30:01,716
Here we go.

582
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,831
You know,
it looks like there's a partial print

583
00:30:05,631 --> 00:30:06,637
on that needle.

584
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:11,517
My memory card's full.

585
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:14,979
That means I have to delete
some of my photos from Paris.

586
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:19,025
<i>If you have any of that pyramid
outside the Louvre, delete them.</i>

587
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:22,339
<i>That glass monstrosity
is an offense to good taste.</i>

588
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,280
It's like <i>Sophie's Choice</i>.

589
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,794
"I can't choose."

590
00:30:30,355 --> 00:30:32,830
Doubt our hit man thought we could
process a mid-flight crime scene.

591
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:34,749
Need the advantage, Abs.

592
00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:38,711
Sorry. It's kitty litter.
That stuff gets everywhere.

593
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,298
I haven't had time to clean up yet.

594
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:41,999
See?

595
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,797
What do you got?

596
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,179
I have a bloody partial print
from the knitting needle.

597
00:30:48,436 --> 00:30:50,593
- Can you use it?
- Well, it's not your...

598
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:52,436
typical method
of processing a print.

599
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,853
I have the added work of enhancing
the photo and then translating the image

600
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,366
into a format that AFIS can understand
before I can even...

601
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,308
begin to search for a hit.

602
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:02,693
Yeah, I'll be right up.

603
00:31:05,992 --> 00:31:07,362
- Holly Snow.
- Can I go?

604
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:08,924
No. Print.

605
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:20,836
The account clients used
to send you the money, let's have it.

606
00:31:21,995 --> 00:31:23,297
W- what, no foreplay,

607
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:24,840
no seduction?

608
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:30,429
- My deal came through, then.
- Just needs a judge's signature.

609
00:31:31,881 --> 00:31:33,599
Why don't you come back
when you have it?

610
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:43,847
Deal's done.

611
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,696
United States Attorney approved.

612
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:54,807
You like it rough, don't you?

613
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,999
There's a time
and a place for everything, Holly.

614
00:31:58,782 --> 00:31:59,932
I thought so.

615
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:05,464
I'm usually pretty good
at reading people.

616
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:09,260
What they respond to.

617
00:32:12,073 --> 00:32:13,073
Role-play?

618
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,902
Too bad.

619
00:32:20,254 --> 00:32:22,375
Want to help out the next victim?

620
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,786
'Cause if she dies...

621
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:29,911
this deal goes away.

622
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,173
And we add another charge.

623
00:32:35,926 --> 00:32:36,763
Murder.

624
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:41,498
I can read people, too.

625
00:32:46,271 --> 00:32:47,573
Account number.

626
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:09,724
How can she sleep now?

627
00:33:10,232 --> 00:33:12,002
- To escape.
- Row 16.

628
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,784
Isn't that the guy Neeley said
was acting strange?

629
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:28,506
Excuse me. Sir.

630
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,032
Stop.

631
00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:33,594
Move again, and I'll break it.

632
00:33:34,662 --> 00:33:36,806
Federal agents.
Everybody relax.

633
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,392
- Return to your SkyMall.
- What the hell are you doing?

634
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,598
What are you doing?

635
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:44,207
I was just changing the battery
in my CD player when I dropped one.

636
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:45,815
It rolled under the seats.

637
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,458
Nobody buys CDs anymore.

638
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,209
You have been acting
strange the entire flight.

639
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:52,018
Yes, well, I am a bit angry.

640
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:54,574
First, the airline refused
to seat me next to my wife,

641
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,950
and then no one would move
when I asked them to switch.

642
00:33:57,094 --> 00:33:58,119
Selfish jerks!

643
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,746
Relax, Battery Boy.

644
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,050
Hold on.

645
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,541
Here you go.

646
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:13,215
Why don't you return to your seat.

647
00:34:16,548 --> 00:34:18,912
- What's wrong?
- Everybody, stay calm.

648
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:20,433
Tony, she's in trouble!

649
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,476
Oh, my God.

650
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,513
Is this what I think it is?

651
00:34:27,184 --> 00:34:28,853
How did the killer get to her?

652
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,290
Autopsy.

653
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,347
<i>Ducky, we've got
a situation with our witness.</i>

654
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,693
Anthony, I can barely hear you.

655
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:51,005
The reception's terrible.

656
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,731
<i>You still on that plane?</i>

657
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:54,232
Yeah. It's Nora.

658
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,469
She's had some kind of reaction.
It's bad.

659
00:34:56,689 --> 00:34:59,097
What's her condition?
Describe the symptoms.

660
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,639
<i>She was sleeping, and then...</i>

661
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,683
She woke up.
She was coughing and wheezing.

662
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:05,603
She collapsed. Her lips are blue
and she's barely breathing.

663
00:35:05,796 --> 00:35:08,107
Are her lips and tongue swollen?

664
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,907
You think it's poison?

665
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:12,943
No. It sounds to me
like a severe allergic reaction

666
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,196
<i>- causing anaphylaxis.</i>
- An allergy?

667
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:18,157
She needs an injection of Epinephrine,
and quickly.

668
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,366
We need an EpiPen.

669
00:35:21,008 --> 00:35:22,646
Her breathing's getting worse.

670
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,515
There isn't one here.

671
00:35:26,174 --> 00:35:27,374
Here. Take mine.

672
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,765
Tony, stop.
Can we trust him?

673
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:32,650
I mean,
what if this whole thing is just...

674
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:34,882
We don't have a choice.

675
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,335
<i>Tony, what's happened?
Is there any change?</i>

676
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,111
Ducky...
the swelling's going down.

677
00:35:56,703 --> 00:35:57,648
Good.

678
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:01,131
Now, it's important
that you keep her on oxygen

679
00:36:01,215 --> 00:36:03,934
and monitor
<i>her breathing until you land.</i>

680
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:10,150
<i>Ducky, how did this happen?
She has not eaten anything.</i>

681
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,418
Tony said she was sleeping.

682
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,602
Yes, we have been
with her the entire time.

683
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:16,038
<i>Did she touch anything?</i>

684
00:36:16,413 --> 00:36:17,484
No, just...

685
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:19,342
a pillow.

686
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:23,070
Nuts.

687
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:24,890
- Nothing?
- No, nuts.

688
00:36:25,544 --> 00:36:27,893
The pillow has been lined
with peanut dust.

689
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:30,371
She must have inhaled it
when she slept.

690
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:33,668
That can be a virulent allergy.

691
00:36:35,505 --> 00:36:36,929
Your assailant...

692
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:39,780
clearly has done his due diligence.

693
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:41,024
Excuse me.

694
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:44,410
Which flight attendant
gave her the pillow?

695
00:36:48,168 --> 00:36:49,373
I got a match, Gibbs,

696
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,992
on the bloody partial print.

697
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,641
It belongs to one
of the flight attendants.

698
00:36:54,103 --> 00:36:56,046
Tiffany Chase.
And...

699
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,641
her flight schedule shows

700
00:36:57,725 --> 00:37:01,525
that she was in DC the day
that Parsons was killed in his condo.

701
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:03,848
- Bank records?
- That's not really my forte,

702
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:06,515
but Tony and Ziva are gone,
and McGee's been really busy, so...

703
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:08,434
All right.

704
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,340
I found periodic deposits,
and big ones.

705
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:13,271
All from anonymous online accounts.

706
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,122
These are contract payouts.

707
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:20,894
I don't know if this is
her first in-flight murder,

708
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:24,086
but it looks like Tiffany Chase
has been using her airline job

709
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,909
to cover travel and kill people,

710
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:27,860
and split town
from anywhere in the world.

711
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:29,418
Another killer with a day job.

712
00:37:29,502 --> 00:37:30,502
Call Tony.

713
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:37,747
Yeah, Boss, I ran the number
that Holly Snow gave us.

714
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:40,837
It's an offshore account.
Last deposit was made four days ago.

715
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,011
- Half a million. Money is still there.
- Who paid to have Nora killed?

716
00:37:44,244 --> 00:37:46,472
Tracked the cash back
to Beringer Marine.

717
00:37:46,825 --> 00:37:48,515
An account that only two
have access to:

718
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,826
Nora Williams
and Ray Beringer himself.

719
00:37:53,627 --> 00:37:56,399
<i>We're about to start
our final descent into Washington.</i>

720
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:59,984
<i>Please return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts securely.</i>

721
00:38:00,383 --> 00:38:02,529
<i>Flight crew,
prepare the cabin for arrival.</i>

722
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:04,573
Serving dinner again?

723
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,899
It wasn't that good the first time.

724
00:38:09,316 --> 00:38:11,121
Is that where you hid
the Air Marshal's gun?

725
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,644
Talk about snakes on a plane.

726
00:38:32,925 --> 00:38:34,645
I'll take that hot towel now.

727
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,475
Excuse me.
I'm in the middle of a conference call.

728
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:44,196
I talked
to the Secretary of the Navy.

729
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,490
There's some misunderstanding
in this investigation.

730
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,442
Investigation's over.
You're under arrest.

731
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,600
- Put your hands behind your back.
- For what?!

732
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,596
Hiring someone
to kill Nora Williams.

733
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,624
Money was transferred
from this company.

734
00:38:55,977 --> 00:38:59,091
- You're the only one with access to it.
- I never hired anyone...

735
00:39:00,487 --> 00:39:03,141
- I thought this was about fraud.
- That's why you needed Nora dead.

736
00:39:03,225 --> 00:39:06,142
She was the only other person
with access to the account.

737
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:07,811
Well, arrest her, then.

738
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,891
You can check the log.
I never transferred any money.

739
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,644
So, what, Nora put a hit on herself?

740
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,041
Hey, Daniel!

741
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:27,211
Stop!

742
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:55,934
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

743
00:39:57,886 --> 00:39:58,722
Boss?

744
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:00,688
Boss, are you okay?

745
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,195
Did you...
Did you hit your shoulder?

746
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,026
The car did, McGee.

747
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:17,123
Cuff him.

748
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,726
They're taking her out now. Flight
attendants will never be the same.

749
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,938
- How are you feeling?
- Better. Thank you. Both.

750
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,306
So you still want to testify
after all of this?

751
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,799
Of course.

752
00:40:44,883 --> 00:40:46,860
You guys did your part.
Now I have to do mine.

753
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,106
Yup, got it, boss.

754
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,156
Right.

755
00:40:52,498 --> 00:40:54,786
I told you I liked happy endings.

756
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:57,829
I can't wait to see Daniel
after all this.

757
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:02,773
About that...

758
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:08,507
Champ du Mars.

759
00:41:09,138 --> 00:41:11,051
Bogey and Bergman
will always have Paris.

760
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,136
Now, so will we.

761
00:41:13,643 --> 00:41:14,847
I guess Nora won't,

762
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,268
seeing as her own fiancé

763
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:19,425
used company money
to try and have her killed.

764
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:20,860
That's got to sting.

765
00:41:20,944 --> 00:41:23,105
Yeah, Nora's testimony
was going to expose him, too.

766
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:26,401
Beringer stole from the Navy.
Daniel stole from Beringer.

767
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:29,648
- How did she take it, by the way?
- Pretty hard, even for her.

768
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:30,863
Rule #12.

769
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,115
Hey, Boss.

770
00:41:32,852 --> 00:41:34,073
How's the shoulder?

771
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,080
Boy, McGee, when you blow it,
you blow it big.

772
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,261
DiNozzo, it was an accident.
MTAC, McGee.

773
00:41:42,348 --> 00:41:43,348
Yes, Boss.

774
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:46,545
Hey, in Paris,
who got stuck with the couch?

775
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,921
Me. We flipped a coin.

776
00:41:48,276 --> 00:41:49,498
Well, tough break.

777
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,845
Why did you just lie to McGee?

778
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:57,862
Why did you lie to Nora?

779
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:03,353
Nora was right.

780
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,595
Found my favorite picture,

781
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:08,818
and it's the only one
with someone in it.

782
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:15,291
Very French New Wave,
don't you think?

783
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:16,551
Maybe.

784
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:23,850
I think it would look better
in black-and-white.

785
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:25,414
