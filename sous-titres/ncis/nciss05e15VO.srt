<i>- Cut around! Cut around!
- Back, back, back!</i>

3
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:09,595
<i>Pick him up!</i>

4
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:12,558
- <i>Good shot, Captain, let's go...
- Ball out, ball out.</i>

5
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:14,799
<i>What you got, Captain?</i>

6
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:15,855
<i>Hey!</i>

7
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:16,982
<i>When you gonna go?</i>

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,455
<i>Out of my way, Jimmy boy.</i>

9
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:20,630
<i>This is what I call...</i>

10
00:00:20,798 --> 00:00:22,076
<i>the halfcourt martial.</i>

11
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:27,218
<i>- No, no way!
- Our ball, come on. Let's go guys!</i>

12
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:28,756
<i>Incoming!</i>

13
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:37,359
<i>Damn Green Zone.</i>

14
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:39,266
- You okay?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:39,397 --> 00:00:41,596
They should rename
it the free-fire zone.

16
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:45,948
Where's the captain?

17
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:50,081
<i>Captain!</i>

18
00:00:51,627 --> 00:00:52,766
Captain.

19
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:54,472
<i>No.</i>

20
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:56,775
- Get a corpsman!
<i>- Corpsman!</i>

21
00:00:58,521 --> 00:00:59,589
Damn.

26
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:32,833
<i>For the one you got me last week.</i>

27
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:34,481
Thank you.

28
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:38,960
That is quite a kiss, McGee.

29
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:40,814
Not bad for a wallpaper?

30
00:01:41,254 --> 00:01:43,193
Well, you seem to be enjoying yourself.

31
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:45,689
I have never seen a tongue quite so...

32
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:46,766
long.

33
00:01:46,832 --> 00:01:48,025
McGee has a long tongue?

34
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:50,595
<i>No, but the cutie-pie</i>
he's kissing does.

35
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,894
McGee's kissing a girl?

36
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,285
- You can't see it, Tony.
- Why not?

37
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:57,753
<i>This is McGee's</i> private photograph,

38
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:00,054
<i>and if he does not want
you to see it here,</i>

39
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:02,455
then you have to respect
his wishes, or...

40
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:04,331
... see it elsewhere.

41
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:06,105
Hey! McRomeo.

42
00:02:06,356 --> 00:02:08,306
You should save that stuff
for the bedroom.

43
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,944
- You're just jealous.
<i>- Jealous? I don't think so.</i>

44
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:13,202
What you're doing there
could be illegal in some states.

45
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:14,263
Or should be.

46
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:17,726
I think I need to wash.

47
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:20,152
- Boss, you gotta check this out.
- No, I don't.

48
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:22,712
Yeah? Gibbs.

49
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,408
Be right down.

50
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,922
At least you don't have to pay
alimony, McGee.

51
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:35,442
Meet Marine Corps Captain John Rankin.

52
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:39,214
Poor fellow traveled further than most
of our guests to be here.

53
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:40,512
From?

54
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:41,742
Baghdad.

55
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:44,688
The captain was caught
<i>in a mortar attack.</i>

56
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,417
Dangerous place.

57
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:49,166
<i>You know,
I was almost killed by a mortar once.</i>

58
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:53,405
I was attending the demonstration
of a new type of 4.2 shell

59
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:57,631
to senior military officials.
Lots of medals and fancy caps.

60
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,331
<i>Damn thing misfired.</i>

61
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:02,911
Fortunately, my services
were not required,

62
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:07,267
but I digress.
<i>SecNav's office called.</i>

63
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:10,546
It seems strings were pulled
to get Captain Rankin to me

64
00:03:11,114 --> 00:03:14,214
rather than to one of the Armed
Forces medical examiners.

65
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:15,342
Because...?

66
00:03:15,384 --> 00:03:19,132
<i>Because, Jethro,</i>
even in war, death can be deceptive.

67
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:21,619
What do you see there?

68
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:26,014
- Multiple shrapnel wounds.
- Yes, but in this case,

69
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:29,635
<i>all of these wounds were made</i>
by a single projectile.

70
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:32,526
The captain was likely bent over,

71
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:36,334
perhaps ducking
<i>for cover as the round landed.</i>

72
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:39,939
It pierced his left side,
nicked his small intestine,

73
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:43,044
tore through his abdomen
and lodged in his right thigh.

74
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,393
Didn't call me for that.

75
00:03:45,764 --> 00:03:47,458
No, not that, Jethro...

76
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,061
For this.

77
00:03:49,977 --> 00:03:52,842
<i>Captain Rankin didn't
die from the mortar attack.</i>

78
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:55,812
The poor fellow was shot.

79
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:08,075
What happened, McGee,
no pictures of your girlfriend?

80
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:10,387
My dog's name is Jethro, Tony.

81
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:11,372
Jethro?

82
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:12,988
It's a boy, not a girl.

83
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,250
Hey, whatever your preference.
Pictures of your boyfriend then.

84
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,272
That's <i>very funny</i>.

85
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:27,752
Fix it.

86
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:30,005
You're barking up the wrong tree.

87
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:34,665
Is that how you want to play this?
<i>'Cause I can play it that way.</i>

88
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:39,650
DiNozzo!

89
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:43,517
Boss, it's a new computer, <i>top secret,
super spy software</i> called Guard Dog.

90
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,295
Come on, McGee, tell me you
got something better for me than that.

91
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:48,557
Absolutely, I do, Boss: Baghdad.

92
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,714
<i>Area inside the green lines
is the International Zone, or I.Z.</i>

93
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:55,371
<i>- Used to be called the Green Zone.</i>
- Central Baghdad.

94
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,271
Many of Saddam's palaces are there.

95
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,877
I stayed in one of those
palaces after Baghdad was liberated.

96
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:02,955
Me too... before Baghdad was liberated.

97
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,326
Got a murdered Marine downstairs.

98
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,554
<i>Considered the safest place in Baghdad.</i>

99
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:11,464
But you all know that because
you have already been to Baghdad.

100
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:14,797
<i>This is where Captain Rankin
was killed playing basketball.</i>

101
00:05:14,837 --> 00:05:16,261
It's deep inside the I.Z.

102
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,982
<i>Mortar rounds, fired just before
Rankin was shot, came from around here.</i>

103
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,581
<i>Shot during a mortar attack.</i>

104
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:23,370
- Coincidence?
- No such thing.

105
00:05:23,412 --> 00:05:25,411
Someone went to a lot
of trouble to set that up.

106
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:27,778
- Made it look like a terrorist attack.
- Okay, motive?

107
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:29,689
<i>Rankin was</i> a real estate investor,

108
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:32,560
worth millions
<i>by the time he was 30 had it all</i>,

109
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:35,202
- fancy car, <i>house on the Vineyard.</i>
- Trophy wife?

110
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,094
It was the wife who pulled strings
to get Ducky to do the autopsy.

111
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,529
How's a guy like that end up in Iraq?

112
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:42,313
<i>Reserve officer</i>. He was called up.

113
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:43,962
<i>Those guys can make</i> enemies fast.

114
00:05:44,004 --> 00:05:47,085
Start throwing their weight around,
<i>trying to get respect from enlisted men.</i>

115
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:48,484
<i>He wasn't like that.</i>

116
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
And you are?

117
00:05:51,303 --> 00:05:52,588
The trophy wife.

118
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:58,340
<i>You don't have to say it.</i>

119
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,513
I know he was murdered.

120
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,421
<i>I've known all along.</i>

121
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:07,093
Get too rich too fast, you make enemies.

122
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:09,305
Anyone in particular?

123
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:11,079
Maybe.

124
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,122
You got a name?

125
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,507
Kelvin Ridgeway.

126
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:20,402
How'd your husband know him?

127
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,872
<i>Through friends.</i>

128
00:06:22,351 --> 00:06:24,445
We ended up buying
a piece of land together.

129
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:26,012
Cloverfield.

130
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:29,070
We put in half the down payment,
got half the equity.

131
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,395
That's a good deal.

132
00:06:32,798 --> 00:06:34,324
Not if it cost John his life.

133
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:40,400
Agreement was being finalized
when John got sent to Iraq.

134
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:42,769
The paperwork followed him.

135
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,992
<i>He signed the contract, but then,</i>

136
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:48,401
the last second,
decided not to send it back.

137
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:50,823
Something changed his mind?

138
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:53,207
My husband used to get these...

139
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,201
gut feelings.

140
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:58,275
<i>You ever have one of those?</i>

141
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:00,409
Yeah, once or twice.

142
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:03,753
<i>The last time we spoke...</i>

143
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:06,749
... he told me he had one.

144
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:08,443
About?

145
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:12,771
Kelvin Ridgeway.

146
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,072
<i>How well did you know</i>
Captain Rankin, Major Varnai?

147
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,169
<i>As well as I know
any man in my unit, sir.</i>

148
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,537
- What kind of officer was he?
<i>- A good one.</i>

149
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,413
That your opinion or somebody else?

150
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:24,912
<i>Everybody liked him,
he was popular with his men.</i>

151
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:26,294
<i>That kind of guy.</i>

152
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:28,806
"That kind of guy"
had a bullet in his back.

153
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:31,768
<i>You know how hard it is
to get into the Zone these days?</i>

154
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:34,919
<i>Ids, photos, fingerprints, biometrics.</i>

155
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:38,160
What you're saying is you've got
a shooter with a security clearance.

156
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,211
You have an insurgency problem
in the Zone, Major Varnai?

157
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:44,884
<i>If that sniper picks off more
of our men, I guess we do.</i>

158
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:48,378
<i>If not, it sounds like Captain
Rankin is the only one with the problem.</i>

159
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:50,769
A Marine was murdered on your watch.

160
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:53,417
<i>And I've lost two more since then.</i>

161
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:55,345
<i>Blown away by roadside bombs.</i>

162
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:58,010
<i>That's part of our
reality out here, sir.</i>

163
00:07:58,287 --> 00:07:59,497
<i>Doesn't mean I like it.</i>

164
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,365
Thank you for your time, Major.

165
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,793
You want me to brief the in-country RAC?

166
00:08:06,713 --> 00:08:07,572
No.

167
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:10,123
Marine gets murdered
serving his country,

168
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:13,064
- he deserves a thorough investigation.
- And he'll get one,

169
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:15,674
<i>but the SecNav wants us
handling this case.</i>

170
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:18,612
Who do you think I should send?

171
00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:21,721
I think they're going
to send one of us to Iraq.

172
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:25,843
Why would you want to go to Baghdad?
You're gonna get bombed and shot at.

173
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,926
Everyone has gone except for me.

174
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:29,372
I've never been.

175
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:32,429
By everyone,
I mean Tony and Ziva and Gibbs.

176
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,268
Gibbs must have gone to Iraq
dozens of times I just want to go once.

177
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:38,698
- To earn your stripes?
- Yeah, to prove myself.

178
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:39,738
To die?

179
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:41,935
I'm not gonna die in Baghdad.

180
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:44,255
Thing is, though,
before I go, they have to choose me.

181
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:46,411
So why don't you just
go talk to the director?

182
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:48,164
Or, our acting director.

183
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:50,349
- Assistant director.
- Right Leon.

184
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:51,469
I can't.

185
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,561
Tony says if I really want to go
<i>then I shouldn't volunteer.</i>

186
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,216
But if he says I shouldn't volunteer,
then he thinks I will volunteer,

187
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:02,251
which means that if I really want to go,
I shouldn't volunteer.

188
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,912
That's... good, Timmy.

189
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:08,844
<i>It sounds like you're...</i>

190
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:11,682
not doing exactly what you shouldn't.

191
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:21,491
- Nikki.
<i>- Ziva.</i>

192
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:23,966
<i>- What do you have there?</i>
- It's nothing.

193
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:27,637
"Five reasons why I should
be picked to go to Iraq."

194
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:33,135
You've heard the rumors, too.

195
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:35,495
You do not know that Iraq is a war zone?

196
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:37,558
<i>Nikki,</i>

197
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:39,091
it is dirty there.

198
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:41,878
Sanitation is very poor.
<i>And diseases.</i>

199
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:43,895
<i>Have you ever heard of leishmaniasis?</i>

200
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:47,897
It begins with a large oozing sore,
often in the face.

201
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:49,504
<i>And then it just...</i>

202
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:53,492
- I have photos I can show you.
<i>- No!</i>

203
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:56,918
Thank you for your concern,
but I still...

204
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,394
really want to go.

205
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:05,283
In that case,

206
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:07,692
I hope you can handle competition

207
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:10,976
a lot better...
<i>than you can handle...</i>

208
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:13,933
handles.

209
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:23,802
What can I tell you
that you don't already know?

210
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,627
I had the inside scoop,
Rankin had the money.

211
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:27,868
<i>- We were all gonna be rich.</i>
- Rankin was already rich.

212
00:10:27,869 --> 00:10:29,178
A rich can never be too rich

213
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:31,754
Or thin. It's a cliché,
but I'm right. Am I right?

214
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:34,422
- Thank you, sweetie pants.
<i>- You're welcome, Mr. Ridgeway.</i>

215
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:36,358
<i>I heard he wasn't very happy at the end.</i>

216
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,434
He's just one of those glass half-empty
kind of guys, you know what I mean?

217
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:41,288
<i>He questioned every
little stupid detail.</i>

218
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,469
You sound pissed.

219
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:44,278
Men have been murdered for less.

220
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:47,509
Yes, men have,
but I'm not an ordinary man.

221
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:50,352
<i>At least that's what I've been told,
you know what I'm sayin'?</i>

222
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,543
His wife said that he
didn't like you very much.

223
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,108
So what, who cares?
I care much more what she thinks of me

224
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,696
<i>- than my business partner.</i>
- I hope you don't care too much.

225
00:10:57,697 --> 00:11:00,350
I mean, you know how we talk to women,
right, Agent... <i>What is it?</i>

226
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,438
Right, I mean,
we just didn't see eye to eye.

227
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:05,593
You know, he'd always
complain to his wife about me,

228
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:07,703
and I complain to
my girlfriend about him.

229
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:10,593
Like I would assume you complain
to your wife about this one.

230
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:11,792
<i>Her?</i>

231
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,393
No, I wouldn't mess with her.

232
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:20,021
<i>Yeah? Why would he say that?</i>

233
00:11:26,397 --> 00:11:27,397
McGee.

234
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:30,023
<i>You're looking very guilty over there.</i>

235
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:32,429
You didn't do that thing
I told you not to do, did you?

236
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,087
Why would I do that?

237
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:35,883
Did you do that?

238
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:37,007
Gibbs back yet?

239
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,962
<i>Well, just arrived, sir.</i>

240
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:47,595
Assistant Director,
I was wondering if I could talk to you.

241
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:48,984
- About?
- Iraq.

242
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,210
If anyone is going to go to Iraq,
I really believe it should be me.

243
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:55,100
It is my area of expertise.
I have a lot of contacts there.

244
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:57,513
- As do I.
<i>- My contacts are still breathing.</i>

245
00:11:57,555 --> 00:11:58,706
<i>As are...</i>

246
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:00,279
most of mine.

247
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,197
Plus,

248
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:04,063
- I speak Arabic fluently.
- I speak Arabic and Kurdish.

249
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,770
- I am not afraid to get my hands dirty.
- I told you.

250
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:09,937
I'm glad you both are
so eager to take on

251
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:12,213
<i>what will no doubt
be a very difficult mission.</i>

252
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,157
I want a thorough investigation
and a quick resolution.

253
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:17,225
<i>McGee?</i>

254
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,512
Yes, sir.

255
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,754
<i>Disappointed you're the only
one who didn't volunteer.</i>

256
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:23,944
Missions like this give an agent
an opportunity to prove themselves.

257
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:27,013
But,
Tony, he didn't volunteer either.

258
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:28,501
He spoke to me earlier.

259
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:30,864
DiNozzo, <i>pack your bags.</i>

260
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:32,515
Thank you, sir.

261
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:34,315
<i>David.</i>

262
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,370
Sending an Israeli to Baghdad...

263
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,155
I don't think so.

264
00:12:38,243 --> 00:12:41,695
<i>DiNozzo, make sure</i> Agent
Jardine gets back in one piece.

265
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:42,924
You got it, sir.

266
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:48,665
The plane to Baghdad takes off
in less than two hours. Get moving.

267
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:01,837
<i>World clocks.</i>

268
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,370
Wouldn't be checking the time in Iraq,
would you?

269
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:06,433
Don't know what you're talking about.

270
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,318
Iraq's not so great.

271
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:12,961
I mean, the whole...

272
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:16,442
trip is probably a big waste of time.
The murderer's probably here.

273
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,987
Awfully long gun barrel if that is true.

274
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,905
Captain Rankin's wife thinks it has
something to do with that land deal.

275
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:22,990
So she says.

276
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,944
Think she did it?
She is the one that called us.

277
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,679
Well, it would not be the first time

278
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,516
a murderer tried
to throw us up that way.

279
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:29,980
Off, throw us off.

280
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:31,444
Exactly.

281
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:32,445
However,

282
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:35,819
Kelvin Ridgeway is guilty of more
than just being a pig. Of that,

283
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,024
I am sure.

284
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:41,207
You know what? I checked Captain
Rankin's phone records from Iraq.

285
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:44,159
In the two days before he was killed,
he called three people:

286
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,406
<i>his wife Dina,</i>

287
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:47,336
<i>his partner Kelvin Ridgeway,</i>

288
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:48,857
<i>and this guy...</i>

289
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:52,384
<i>George Stenner. He owns a small company</i>
called Land Test Labs.

290
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:53,739
<i>They do soil testing.</i>

291
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,979
<i>Rankin called Stenner</i>
three times the day he was killed.

292
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,283
Gibbs is definitely going
to want to talk to him.

293
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:02,806
By the way, it's been 45 minutes.

294
00:14:03,935 --> 00:14:04,935
Excuse me?

295
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:07,880
Since Nikki and Tony arrived in Baghdad.

296
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,588
Which would place them at...

297
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:10,739
Their hotel.

298
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:26,950
This is it.

299
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:30,247
Well, welcome to the Baghdad Hilton.

300
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:32,521
Overflow accommodations.
Best we can offer.

301
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:34,277
Unpack. Get comfortable.

302
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:35,967
Wouldn't get too comfortable.

303
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,425
<i>Ah, yeah.</i>

304
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:43,199
<i>It's just like home.</i>

305
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,827
If you live in an airport.

306
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,332
You got a problem, Jardine?

307
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,444
I just thought I'd have
a little more privacy.

308
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:13,629
Where do you think you're going?

309
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,930
Just got off a transatlantic flight.

310
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:16,970
Need a shower.

311
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:20,023
Yeah, well, crime scenes don't wait.
Showers do. Besides...

312
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:22,854
<i>not even I would shower in that.</i>

313
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:24,691
<i>It's going to be a long week.</i>

314
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:35,756
Squared away?

315
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:36,644
<i>Yeah.</i>

316
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:37,896
Ready to roll.

317
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:43,271
You're not gonna need all that stuff,
Jardine, this is the I.Z.

318
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:45,993
35 mortars were fired
into the International Zone

319
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:47,573
on a single day last July.

320
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,496
Dozens more in the year since.

321
00:15:49,888 --> 00:15:51,137
You do what you want.

322
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:53,772
I'll wear the helmet.

323
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:55,805
Why the hell are you here?

324
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:56,835
Really.

325
00:15:57,144 --> 00:15:59,538
Because it's going
to look really good on my resume.

326
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,414
That's not why she's here.

327
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:17,622
<i>Lock it up.</i>

328
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,729
<i>Roger that, Major.</i>

329
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:20,962
The court where it happened.

330
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,717
<i>Sergeant Jim Gilroy. Other guy's
a contract worker, Allan Hayes.</i>

331
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,070
They were both with Captain Rankin
when he got hit.

332
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:29,343
Knock yourselves out.

333
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:33,485
Charming.

334
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:35,553
Knows how to make you feel welcome.

335
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:37,071
Well, it's stressful out here.

336
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:38,775
May be a coping mechanism, you know?

337
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:41,033
<i>Shutting off his emotions
to get the job done.</i>

338
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:43,056
Good morning, Baghdad.

339
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,329
<i>Agent DiNozzo, NCIS.</i>

340
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:48,627
You two were playing basketball
<i>with Captain Rankin when he was killed.</i>

341
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:50,794
<i>Major says he was shot, sir.
That true?</i>

342
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:52,608
That depends.

343
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:53,913
Did you hear a shot?

344
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:55,631
All I heard were the mortars, sir.

345
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:57,292
Good officer?

346
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:58,416
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

347
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,740
Proud to serve with him.

348
00:16:59,837 --> 00:17:02,239
You two notice anything
out of the ordinary that day?

349
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:03,323
No, sir.

350
00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:04,878
We were just playing ball,

351
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:06,865
heard the incoming, and hit the ground.

352
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:08,901
I was right next to him.

353
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:12,274
Anyone have a grudge
against Captain Rankin?

354
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,389
<i>No, sir.</i>

355
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,668
Very well liked.

356
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:16,160
Good Marine officer.

357
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:20,073
Yeah, you keep saying that.

358
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:22,378
How about you?

359
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:24,245
I didn't know him so well.

360
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:26,911
<i>Not enlisted. We've been playing
a pickup game here for a couple weeks.</i>

361
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,794
Guy seemed cool.
He was a pretty good shooter.

362
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:31,339
Where was he when he was killed?

363
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:32,588
<i>Free throw line.</i>

364
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:35,206
Which way was he facing?

365
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,380
The hoop.

366
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:37,662
<i>That would make sense.</i>

367
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,226
All right.

368
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,534
Hit in the lower back on the left side.

369
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:47,506
<i>Right out in the open.</i>

370
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,728
Bullet was fired from a height.
Could be any one of those.

371
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:54,341
- What's that over there, Major?
- Believe that's a hotel.

372
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:55,698
<i>And next to it?</i>

373
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:57,209
<i>Family residence, maybe.</i>

374
00:17:57,449 --> 00:18:00,012
- All right, thank you guys very much.
- Sir, no problem.

375
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:02,000
So tell me about the mortar attack?

376
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:04,259
Found the launcher. Plastic tubes,

377
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:05,617
welded frame.

378
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:07,335
16 millimeters. Small stuff.

379
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,443
- Not as deadly as some.
- And the guy behind it?

380
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,048
Local Haji. Insurgent.

381
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:13,420
You caught him?

382
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:15,532
Not quick enough.
Tribal militia got to him first.

383
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:17,144
Are they on our side?

384
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,690
Controlled by a local sheikh.

385
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:21,435
Think neighborhood watch with AK-47s.

386
00:18:22,323 --> 00:18:23,512
I need to talk to him.

387
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:25,838
Know any good mediums?

388
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:28,521
Convenient.

389
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,650
The one guy who can tell us
who killed Rankin is six feet under.

390
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:33,922
Four feet around here.

391
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:46,506
No need Mr. Stenner, sit down.

392
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:49,273
I don't understand.
I mean, can you tell me why I'm...?

393
00:18:49,274 --> 00:18:50,531
- Are you nervous?
- No.

394
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,910
Yeah. I mean, yeah, a little.

395
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:55,395
- Can I go to the bathroom?
- In a minute.

396
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:05,610
So...

397
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:09,871
why did John Rankin
call you last Monday,

398
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:11,437
day before he was killed?

399
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:13,326
He's dead?

400
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:16,419
I know that already,
I just can't believe...

401
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,725
<i>- Answer?</i>
- He had this piece of land...

402
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,124
- Cloverfield.
<i>- Yeah. That, that... Yeah.</i>

403
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,452
So, a few weeks ago he called
me to do some soil testing on it,

404
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:26,846
and he didn't want
anyone to know about it.

405
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:28,042
What'd you find?

406
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,872
That the land was contaminated.

407
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,793
Heavy metals, mostly, lead,

408
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,781
other things that are harmful to people.

409
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:36,377
<i>Children especially.</i>

410
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:37,572
What'd Rankin say?

411
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:40,294
He said that he was
gonna tear up the contract.

412
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,082
You know, he seemed really,
really angry with his business partner.

413
00:19:43,804 --> 00:19:44,994
Who else saw the report?

414
00:19:45,147 --> 00:19:46,846
No one. It was secret.

415
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:50,006
I only made one copy,
and I sent it to him in Iraq.

416
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:51,240
I need a copy.

417
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,845
No problem. I'll e-mail it right over.

418
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:59,438
Now, can I just please
go to the bathroom really...?

419
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:00,655
Okay.

420
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,235
I'm kidding. You can go.

421
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:03,768
Thanks.

422
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:25,740
Bang! The shot came from here.

423
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:31,010
Jardine, up here.

424
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:40,000
Shell casing.

425
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:51,208
Yeah. 7.62, it's not one of ours.

426
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,225
I need to know
who had access to this room.

427
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,559
I don't have a terp here.

428
00:20:54,912 --> 00:20:57,841
Terp? Is that Varnai
speak for "interpreter"?

429
00:20:57,842 --> 00:20:59,994
In which case, Jardine,

430
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:02,674
would you ask our friend here
who had access to this room?

431
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:16,502
She says the man who lived here died,

432
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:19,393
his brother Ali Mahmoud is
the only other person with a key.

433
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,170
Can she get him for us?

434
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:28,797
She says Ali hasn't shown up
here since the mortar attack.

435
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:30,302
Big surprise.

436
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:33,526
But she does know where he lives.

437
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,161
It's all here, Boss,
just like Stenner said.

438
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:39,022
<i>Heavy contaminations of lead,
cadmium and zinc in the soil.</i>

439
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:41,508
Reason enough for Rankin
to want out of the deal?

440
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,188
Think Ridgeway knew and was trying
to get Rankin to sign the deal before

441
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:45,212
<i>he found out?</i>

442
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:49,390
I'll check on Ridgeway's phone records,
see who he's been calling.

443
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:00,952
<i>First squad, forward security.</i>

444
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,351
<i>Second squad, rear security.</i>

445
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:04,022
You stay close, do as I say.

446
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:05,498
Don't worry, I will.

447
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:10,843
Open door left!

448
00:22:10,844 --> 00:22:12,033
Open door right!

449
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:20,800
What is she saying? Where is he?

450
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:22,245
She keeps saying we're too late.

451
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:24,082
<i>Too late for what?</i>

452
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,389
<i>Several hooded men beat Ali,</i>

453
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,374
they took him away
<i>in handcuffs last night.</i>

454
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:33,955
Who was it, the police?

455
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:37,403
No, she doesn't think so.

456
00:22:45,654 --> 00:22:47,521
Let me guess more good news?

457
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,690
She thinks they're going to execute him.

458
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:52,170
Great.

459
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,830
<i>- That's it.
- Yes, yes.</i>

460
00:22:58,831 --> 00:23:01,079
<i>- Come on, that's it.
- Yes.</i>

461
00:23:02,752 --> 00:23:03,858
<i>That's it.</i>

462
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:05,604
<i>Amazing.</i>

463
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:07,353
That's amazing.

464
00:23:07,434 --> 00:23:08,262
<i>Nice.</i>

465
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:11,439
<i>Off goes my little e-mail</i>
chickadee to Abby.

466
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:13,924
- Three bars.
- That's pretty good.

467
00:23:14,074 --> 00:23:15,459
Eh, five?

468
00:23:21,284 --> 00:23:23,753
I only almost touched you.

469
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:25,093
There was no...

470
00:23:26,252 --> 00:23:30,252
You know, for someone who hates germs
so much, you're really quite a slob.

471
00:23:30,424 --> 00:23:32,200
One has nothing to do with the other.

472
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:33,330
Right.

473
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:37,281
Since we're on the subject of things
that make absolutely no sense at all,

474
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,241
you want to tell me the truth?

475
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:42,499
Maybe we could, find out...

476
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:44,004
why you're here.

477
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:45,525
I told you.

478
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,145
The Middle East is my area of expertise.

479
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,193
I'm here because it's
professionally advantageous.

480
00:23:50,371 --> 00:23:53,400
Is that why you were making a phone
call in Arabic on the basketball court?

481
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:55,463
Because it was
professionally advantageous?

482
00:23:57,933 --> 00:24:00,507
<i>Never thought it was possible</i>
to hurt yourself with a wet wipe.

483
00:24:02,894 --> 00:24:04,490
I have a brother.

484
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:06,741
He's a Marine.

485
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,493
He was here in Baghdad two years ago.

486
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:14,413
He was wounded.

487
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:18,750
<i>I just wanted to see where it happened.</i>

488
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,631
We're very close, and

489
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:24,130
I just need to experience what he...

490
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,361
All right, here we go.

491
00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:30,226
Tony, is that really you?

492
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,154
Move back so we can see your face.

493
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:34,392
- Hi.
<i>- Hi, good-looking.</i>

494
00:24:34,497 --> 00:24:35,776
I missed you.

495
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,502
Is Neat Nut Nikki driving you crazy?

496
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:41,352
<i>Actually, she's right here,
and she's...</i>

497
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:42,949
<i>not as neat as you think.</i>

498
00:24:43,102 --> 00:24:44,573
Sorry, Nikki.

499
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:47,168
<i>I don't really think that you're a nut,</i>

500
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:48,629
just, you know, that you're neat.

501
00:24:48,794 --> 00:24:51,008
<i>Not neat like cool,
but neat like, you know, neat.</i>

502
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:53,627
<i>Not that you're not </i>
cool. You're just...

503
00:24:53,628 --> 00:24:54,629
<i>It's okay.</i>

504
00:24:55,272 --> 00:24:57,051
I didn't know you guys
were sharing a room.

505
00:24:57,052 --> 00:24:58,262
They're sharing a room?

506
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,855
We're not exactly sharing a room.

507
00:24:59,856 --> 00:25:02,534
Either they're sharing a room
or they're not sharing a room.

508
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,884
I don't see what is so exact
or not exact about it.

509
00:25:04,885 --> 00:25:07,772
<i>Abs, did you</i> get my
scan of the bullet casing?

510
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,850
<i>Done and done.</i>

511
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:12,007
<i>I just ran it through the Central
Command database. You know that</i>

512
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:15,478
<i> they fingerprint pretty much everybody
that works </i>or lives at the I.Z.

513
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:18,840
Let me guess... it's a fingerprint that
belongs to Ali Mahmoud.

514
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:19,841
<i>That's him!</i>

515
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:21,956
He's an Iraqi national and

516
00:25:21,957 --> 00:25:24,116
he is working in the I.Z.
as a maintenance guy.

517
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:27,179
He's 25 years old.
Part of the Al Shammar <i>tribe</i>.

518
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:29,226
That's one of the most
prominent tribes in Iraq.

519
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,488
<i>No criminal convictions,</i>

520
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:33,508
but his brother was killed in
<i>crossfire about a month ago.</i>

521
00:25:33,523 --> 00:25:35,089
<i>Rankin's </i>squad was involved...

522
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,436
Ali may have snapped and killed Rankin.

523
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:38,963
<i>So...</i>

524
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,996
<i>you got any leads</i>
on Ali's whereabouts?

525
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:43,013
<i>Tony, you're</i>
in the same city as him.

526
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:45,851
We're ten time zones away.
Why were you sent to Iraq again?

527
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:47,071
Good question.

528
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:50,221
Well, let us know.

529
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,554
<i>And put my Kill Bill mug
back on my desk, McGee.</i>

530
00:25:55,993 --> 00:25:57,957
Major, a man in your unit was murdered.

531
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:00,138
Is there a reason you don't
want to find out who did it?

532
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,212
Sure I do.

533
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,786
I'd like the war to end,
the electricity to work

534
00:26:03,787 --> 00:26:05,473
and for all the tribes to get along.

535
00:26:05,505 --> 00:26:08,564
One of my contacts his family
is part of the Al Shammar tribe.

536
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:09,805
Same tribe as Ali.

537
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:11,386
It's a long shot, but...

538
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:15,079
The Iraqi are so close, one of them
stubs a toe in the shower, by the time

539
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,862
he's dry five of his cousins are
at his front door to ask if he's okay.

540
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,415
She's messy.

541
00:26:22,978 --> 00:26:24,311
Obsessively.

542
00:26:24,662 --> 00:26:25,662
Found him.

543
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:27,808
My contact knows one of the men
who abducted him.

544
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:29,548
He said it's the talk
of the neighborhood.

545
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:30,683
Need an address.

546
00:26:36,723 --> 00:26:38,228
He said he can take us there.

547
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,180
Hold up. No one's driving into
the party zone at this time of night.

548
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,143
- Trail's gonna go cold.
- The trail, Agent DiNozzo.

549
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,802
Is filled with roadside
bombs and snipers

550
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:49,353
<i>who just love to pick off
vacationing warriors</i>

551
00:26:49,354 --> 00:26:51,582
like yourself in the dark of the night.

552
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:54,090
And while I wouldn't
mind sacrificing you to them,

553
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:56,533
I have a family I'd like to return to...

554
00:26:57,298 --> 00:26:58,298
eventually.

555
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,938
Pick you up at first light

556
00:27:04,918 --> 00:27:06,005
Anything yet?

557
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:09,051
Yeah, I got Kelvin Ridgeway's
phone records.

558
00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:11,026
Like anyone would wanna talk
to that man.

559
00:27:11,823 --> 00:27:13,362
<i>Apparently Captain Rankin did.</i>

560
00:27:13,484 --> 00:27:15,865
He called Ridgeway twice
the day before he died.

561
00:27:15,866 --> 00:27:18,160
If Rankin told him
he was pulling out of the deal...

562
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,119
Gives Ridgeway time to organize the hit.

563
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:23,946
Now if Tony and Nikki could
just find our trigger man in Iraq...

564
00:27:23,947 --> 00:27:26,493
All we will have to do
is confirm who hired him.

565
00:27:26,494 --> 00:27:27,744
Get me Ridgeway.

566
00:27:36,684 --> 00:27:39,034
Marines call this "Fool's Crossing".

567
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:42,435
<i>Insurgents like to stop our troops
with an IDF or an IED,</i>

568
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:44,334
<i>finish the job off with SAF.</i>

569
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:48,099
They set off a roadside bomb, when
you stop your convoy, they shoot at you.

570
00:27:48,137 --> 00:27:49,149
<i>Finish the job.</i>

571
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:52,097
- What the hell...
<i>- Where are you going?</i>

572
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:54,921
<i>Dismount and secure the area.</i>
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

573
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,980
<i>Agent Jardine!</i>

574
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:01,077
<i>Jardine, get down!</i>

575
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
<i>He's hit!</i>

576
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:08,821
What are you doing?

577
00:28:14,203 --> 00:28:15,206
<i>Wait.</i>

578
00:28:17,423 --> 00:28:18,423
<i>Jameel.</i>

579
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:27,723
It is good to meet you finally.

580
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:29,403
Come,

581
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:31,177
<i>meet my friends.</i>

582
00:28:34,701 --> 00:28:38,636
<i>Major Varnai,
this is my contact, Jameel Al-Farhad.</i>

583
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:41,390
- Peace to you.
- And to you.

584
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:42,826
A word.

585
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:46,288
You do not break protocol.
You put everyone in danger.

586
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,660
What's going on here?
What is really going on?

587
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:50,570
- I told you...
<i>-No, the truth.</i>

588
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:55,716
This is where it happened, okay?
This is where my brother was shot.

589
00:28:56,565 --> 00:28:59,301
- And your contact here?
- He and his family saw it happen.

590
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:02,128
And that's it?

591
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:03,131
No.

592
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:07,902
We're here because he's going
to help us find Ali.

593
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:12,064
Jameel, your English is very good.

594
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:14,939
I learn in school.

595
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:17,140
I also teach my sister.

596
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:26,212
- They don't teach English to the girls?
- She doesn't go to school anymore.

597
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:28,200
Not since my father dies.

598
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:31,471
<i>I help her a little bit, I can.</i>

599
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:34,924
Let's go. We're Oscar Mike.

600
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,008
Come on.

601
00:29:40,883 --> 00:29:43,056
Does anybody want to tell me
what I'm doing here?

602
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:46,388
Sure.

603
00:29:48,004 --> 00:29:51,728
We know about <i>the soil tests
Captain Rankin had done on Cloverfield.</i>

604
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:53,221
Heavy metals.

605
00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:56,342
Cadmium, lead,
<i>trace elements of zinc...</i>

606
00:29:56,343 --> 00:29:57,776
What are you talking about?

607
00:29:59,251 --> 00:30:01,791
You knew Cloverfield was contaminated,
<i>Mr. Ridgeway.</i>

608
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:05,117
You knew that Rankin wouldn't be
part of your deal if he found out.

609
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:08,287
Must've really irked you to hear
that he had done his own soil tests.

610
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:10,581
So what? What do you think that I did?

611
00:30:10,864 --> 00:30:13,945
- Had Captain Rankin killed.
- Yes, nice speculation.

612
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:15,419
Got a motive.

613
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:17,696
He was about to mess up your deal.

614
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:19,934
When you find the guy in Iraq
who pulled the trigger,

615
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:23,173
he's going to tell you the same thing.
I had nothing to do with it.

616
00:30:23,757 --> 00:30:26,490
Got agents on their way there right now

617
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,741
to talk to the shooter as we speak.

618
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:32,394
You don't mind waiting, uh?

619
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:53,749
Come to Baghdad 'cause
you wanna see a show.

620
00:30:54,031 --> 00:30:55,768
<i>You're about to get one.</i>

621
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:01,423
I'm guessing he's not
complimenting my vest.

622
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,417
He seems to know your mother
very intimately.

623
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:08,959
Ali?

624
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:19,816
<i>He says we can go in.</i>

625
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:33,905
Wakey, wakey, sunshine.

626
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:43,131
We got a problem, boss.

627
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:47,742
Our suspect's not about to talk...
His tongue's been cut out.

628
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:14,288
The guard said he hasn't
checked on Ali since last night.

629
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,869
- You believe him?
- Jameel does.

630
00:32:16,898 --> 00:32:20,444
<i>- You don't know him very well, do you?</i>
- I know he's a good kid.

631
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:24,521
<i>- You think he's a good kid.</i>
- I think the guard has told the truth.

632
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:26,090
He says <i>he brought Ali dinner,</i>

633
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:29,018
<i>then later heard him yelling</i>
and crying but didn't come in to check.

634
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,306
I'd be yelling and crying too
if my tongue was being cut out.

635
00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:36,059
- These tribal guys don't mess around.
- Tribal? I don't think so.

636
00:32:37,688 --> 00:32:40,897
Tongue cut out. They didn't want him
to talk. It's a sign.

637
00:32:41,018 --> 00:32:42,920
But not one that this tribe uses.

638
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:44,760
The tongue thing
tells me that the person

639
00:32:44,761 --> 00:32:47,435
who killed Ali doesn't know
much about tribal culture...

640
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:49,364
<i>Didn't think we would either.</i>

641
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,580
You mean someone like the major?

642
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,185
<i>He knew where Ali was being held.</i>

643
00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:57,540
<i>Heard you say it</i>
on the phone last night.

644
00:32:57,541 --> 00:33:00,917
- You really think he might have...
- If we could establish time of death,

645
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:02,669
it might help us find out.

646
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,158
Right, Tony.
You take two temperatures:

647
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,492
the room where the body lies
and the body itself.

648
00:33:08,493 --> 00:33:10,844
Comparing the two will give you
the time you want.

649
00:33:11,188 --> 00:33:14,647
<i>First should be easy, the second
only slightly more complicated.</i>

650
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:18,742
- What are my choices?
- <i>You're going to need a thermometer.</i>

651
00:33:20,544 --> 00:33:21,813
- Got one.
- <i>Good.</i>

652
00:33:21,941 --> 00:33:24,565
And you'll need
a sharp knife of some sort.

653
00:33:25,741 --> 00:33:27,027
<i>Got one of those, too.</i>

654
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:29,385
What do I need a sharp knife for?

655
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:32,080
So you can cut into the body,
<i>dear boy.</i>

656
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:34,663
- Ready to go?
- Excuse me.

657
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:37,155
Major Varnai, this is a crime scene.

658
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:40,667
<i>This is Baghdad,</i> Agent DiNozzo.
The whole place is a crime scene.

659
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:45,198
<i>A Few Good Men.</i>

660
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:47,814
- What?
- Jack Nicholson.

661
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:50,810
I knew he reminded me of somebody.
I'm going to have to call you back.

662
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:53,637
- There's someone I need to talk to.
- Ducky, wait.

663
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,825
Tony, I can do it.

664
00:33:58,138 --> 00:33:59,138
Germs.

665
00:34:00,036 --> 00:34:02,020
- Gloves.
- Good luck with that.

666
00:34:06,384 --> 00:34:07,526
<i>Are you there?</i>

667
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:09,346
I'm ready, Ducky.

668
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,441
You never liked Captain Rankin,
did you, Major?

669
00:34:13,861 --> 00:34:15,009
<i>You prefer tough guys.</i>

670
00:34:15,383 --> 00:34:17,555
He was a reserve officer, too soft.

671
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,278
They don't know what they're
doing out here, guys like that.

672
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:22,107
Put the rest of you in danger, huh?

673
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:25,633
- Like you've been doing, Agent DiNozzo?
- You didn't want us to come here today.

674
00:34:25,652 --> 00:34:27,408
You tried to keep us from finding Ali,

675
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:30,455
and you certainly didn't
seem surprised to find him dead.

676
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:33,555
- Told you it's a violent culture.
- Yeah, maybe it is.

677
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:37,326
Or maybe, last night, when you heard
where he was being held,

678
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:38,754
you came out here.

679
00:34:40,285 --> 00:34:43,237
You acted like you don't
<i>understand Arabic, but you do.</i>

680
00:34:43,725 --> 00:34:46,098
<i>You had the time, Major, and the access.</i>

681
00:34:50,972 --> 00:34:53,500
Semper fi, Agent DiNozzo.

682
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:56,621
Words to live and die by out here.

683
00:34:58,246 --> 00:35:00,156
I wouldn't kill a fellow Marine.

684
00:35:00,414 --> 00:35:02,545
Even if you didn't think
he was a "real" Marine?

685
00:35:02,546 --> 00:35:04,143
Your feelings, not mine.

686
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,421
Some of my best men are reservists.

687
00:35:08,044 --> 00:35:10,394
Is this something I need to hear now?

688
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,506
The body, Ali,

689
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,840
was killed four hours ago.

690
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:16,241
<i>Yeah?</i>

691
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,661
Major Varnai has been
with us all morning.

692
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:29,065
This four hour thing, you're sure
about that? Really sure?

693
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:32,194
Sorry about that, just doing my job.

694
00:35:36,298 --> 00:35:37,866
I hate it when that happens.

695
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:40,258
Awkward moments.

696
00:35:41,118 --> 00:35:43,886
<i>- You, you all right?</i>
- It's just...

697
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,201
- so oppressive in there.
- The smell of death.

698
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:49,670
No, it's that awful chemical smell.

699
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,636
<i>- Chemicals?</i>
- Turpentine.

700
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:54,849
I'm hypersensitive.

701
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:57,535
I usually only have this problem
in new buildings.

702
00:35:57,536 --> 00:35:59,772
Construction workers
use it all the time.

703
00:35:59,773 --> 00:36:00,873
Construction?

704
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,186
Have you reacted since we've been here?

705
00:36:03,187 --> 00:36:05,173
Happened yesterday
on the basketball court

706
00:36:05,174 --> 00:36:07,354
when you were talking
to those witnesses.

707
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:11,817
Wasn't one of them
a construction worker?

708
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,910
- <i>I need to talk to the big man.</i>
- Hold on.

709
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:23,747
<i>Let me put you on speaker.</i>

710
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:27,261
<i>I need a background check:
U.S. citizen...</i>

711
00:36:27,382 --> 00:36:28,385
Alan Hayes.

712
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,135
- He works here in Baghdad.
- What do you got on him?

713
00:36:31,136 --> 00:36:32,154
<i>Bad smell, boss.</i>

714
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:34,141
Nikki picked up his scent
at the crime scene.

715
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,899
Alan Michael Hayes, 27 years old,

716
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:40,011
<i>has a police record:
petty thefts, one aggravated assault.</i>

717
00:36:40,227 --> 00:36:42,305
Working for a construction company
in Baghdad.

718
00:36:42,923 --> 00:36:45,684
- He was with Rankin when he was killed.
- <i>Come on, DiNozzo,</i>

719
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:48,262
- you gotta give me more than that.
- Not done yet here.

720
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:49,999
Got a link to the Iraqi database.

721
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,414
<i>Alan Hayes under investigation.</i>

722
00:36:52,721 --> 00:36:56,348
Suspected of paying bribes to
<i>a number of Iraqi nationals in the I.Z.,</i>

723
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,738
including none other than Ali Mahmoud.

724
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,616
It wasn't a bribe.
It was a hit fee.

725
00:37:01,738 --> 00:37:03,335
- Get me Hayes.
- <i>Got it.</i>

726
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:05,792
It's too late, boss.
He got on a flight out of Iraq

727
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:08,056
<i>two hours ago.</i>
Arrives in DC at 18:00.

728
00:37:09,888 --> 00:37:11,743
You and Jardine are
on the first flight back.

729
00:37:11,744 --> 00:37:13,465
- <i>Move it.</i>
- On our way.

730
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:17,034
Let's get the hell out of here.

731
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:20,302
Need to find out if Hayes acted alone.

732
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,285
Ridgeway's phone records.

733
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:25,932
<i>In the weeks prior to Rankin's death,</i>

734
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:28,310
Ridgeway called George Stenner
six times.

735
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:31,688
Now, Ridgeway said that he didn't
know about Stenner or the soil tests.

736
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,660
Captain Rankin's personal effects.

737
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:36,443
Get me the Cloverfield phone.

738
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:38,098
Ready?

739
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,530
Yeah, just about.

740
00:37:41,534 --> 00:37:43,325
So, Major, when are you heading home?

741
00:37:43,745 --> 00:37:46,009
Five months, 16 days, two hours.

742
00:37:49,549 --> 00:37:51,252
- Ready.
<i>- Good.</i>

743
00:37:52,494 --> 00:37:54,328
Except for a small favor,

744
00:37:54,946 --> 00:37:56,496
just a little detour.

745
00:38:00,352 --> 00:38:02,339
<i>You do remember</i>
Major Varnai telling us

746
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,763
this is one of the most
<i>dangerous areas in Baghdad?</i>

747
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:07,264
<i>'Cause I remember it
as if it was this morning.</i>

748
00:38:07,265 --> 00:38:09,384
Wait a second. It was this morning.

749
00:38:10,104 --> 00:38:11,728
<i>Which makes me wonder...</i>

750
00:38:11,937 --> 00:38:13,408
Why are we here now?

751
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:19,481
You don't get out of the vehicle.
These guys freak when you do that.

752
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:25,244
When Eric was shot, he almost died.

753
00:38:26,643 --> 00:38:28,455
A local man ran out,

754
00:38:28,992 --> 00:38:30,501
started giving him CPR.

755
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:32,744
More Marines arrived,

756
00:38:32,756 --> 00:38:35,449
they saw Eric down,
saw an Iraqi standing over him.

757
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:38,645
They thought he was an insurgent and...

758
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,701
That was Jameel's father.

759
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:44,576
There is no way I can repay the family.

760
00:38:45,642 --> 00:38:48,837
But I can at least make
<i>it a little easier for one of them</i>

761
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:50,725
to communicate with the outside world.

762
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:54,891
Perimeter.

763
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:01,071
<i>Dismount and secure the area!</i>

764
00:39:18,238 --> 00:39:19,318
Tabina!

765
00:39:41,488 --> 00:39:43,778
Got the Cloverfield file
from Rankin's effects.

766
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:46,906
The contract he signed is missing.

767
00:39:47,614 --> 00:39:50,618
Ridgeway was desperate
to get a signed contract back.

768
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,910
He must have paid Hayes
to kill Rankin then steal it.

769
00:39:54,076 --> 00:39:55,290
Hayes probably has it.

770
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:00,927
<i>Stenner's report on the soil test.</i>

771
00:40:03,088 --> 00:40:06,132
Same report Stenner gave us.
<i>Heavy metal contaminations.</i>

772
00:40:06,325 --> 00:40:08,679
It appears Rankin did his own research.

773
00:40:09,982 --> 00:40:12,027
Title searches from the 1920s.

774
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:15,226
Looks like there used to be
a ceramics factory on the site.

775
00:40:15,348 --> 00:40:16,798
Ceramics means lead.

776
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:19,277
So why would Rankin do his own research

777
00:40:19,392 --> 00:40:20,767
after he got Stenner's report?

778
00:40:21,396 --> 00:40:22,290
Gut feeling.

779
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,078
You got a gut feeling, Boss?

780
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,385
Yeah, but Captain Rankin did, too.

781
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,156
Ziva, find Stenner.

782
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,860
Let's go.

783
00:40:34,372 --> 00:40:36,702
<i>Thanks.</i> Hayes just cleared Customs.

784
00:40:36,703 --> 00:40:38,887
Think Ridgeway will meet him here
to pick up the contract?

785
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:41,453
What makes you think
that Ridgeway did it, McGee?

786
00:40:47,203 --> 00:40:48,980
- There he is.
- Hold on.

787
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,110
Let's go.

788
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,790
<i>Hello, Mr. Stenner.</i>

789
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,873
- This is not what you think.
- Who are these guys?

790
00:41:01,913 --> 00:41:04,400
- I'm guessing you two have met before?
- Years ago.

791
00:41:04,658 --> 00:41:07,104
<i>We worked for the same
construction company.</i> Is that a crime?

792
00:41:07,105 --> 00:41:08,780
No. Murder is.

793
00:41:13,798 --> 00:41:16,170
There's different results here
in your report.

794
00:41:16,171 --> 00:41:18,535
<i>No mention
of the Cloverfield contamination.</i>

795
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:20,708
<i>You switched it</i>
after you killed Captain Rankin.

796
00:41:20,906 --> 00:41:24,004
- I didn't kill Rankin.
- You paid Ali Mahmoud to do it.

797
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:25,296
Then you killed him.

798
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,710
This was all his idea.

799
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,936
I needed the money, okay?

800
00:41:32,425 --> 00:41:35,603
<i>I showed Ridgeway my findings,
he wanted Rankin to sign the contract,</i>

801
00:41:35,604 --> 00:41:37,851
so he paid me to doctor the report.

802
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:40,592
Rankin did his own research.

803
00:41:40,593 --> 00:41:42,052
When he challenged your findings,

804
00:41:42,053 --> 00:41:44,869
you contacted
your old buddy Hayes here in Iraq,

805
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,586
<i>who arranged the mortar attack as cover.
Hayes paid Ali to shoot Rankin,</i>

806
00:41:48,824 --> 00:41:51,674
then you silenced Ali
<i>and swapped the reports.</i>

807
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:54,011
<i>Rankin was gonna investigate me.</i>

808
00:41:54,382 --> 00:41:56,734
I would have lost my business,
ruined my life.

809
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,229
You just did that yourself.

810
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:10,958
<i>- Welcome back.</i>
- Thank you. How's he been?

811
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:17,018
<i>Hey, Eric.</i>

812
00:42:23,268 --> 00:42:24,657
I met Jameel.

813
00:42:25,656 --> 00:42:27,063
He has a sister.

814
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:28,872
She is so sweet.

815
00:42:29,987 --> 00:42:32,989
They were so proud when I told them
that you were doing okay.

816
00:42:36,274 --> 00:42:38,165
I've got this amazing CD.

817
00:42:39,103 --> 00:42:40,524
You're gonna love it.

818
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,181
Reminds me of the time...

819
00:42:43,756 --> 00:42:46,669
that weekend that Mom
and Dad took us camping.

820
00:42:49,596 --> 00:42:50,638
Remember?

821
