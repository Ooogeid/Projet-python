00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:05,926
My course, my win.

3
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:08,090
Remind me what you Navy boys
are good at again?

4
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,341
Kicking Army's ass.

5
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:17,933
- Giving up already?
- Hang on a second.

6
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,023
- What's this doing here?
- I don't know.

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,553
- Yo, come on, man, let's go.
- Not yet.

8
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:40,494
Weird.

9
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:44,195
Navy...

00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:39,777
What are you doing?

15
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:42,350
- Nothing.
- Those are none of your business.

16
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:44,922
- Those belong to McGee.
- They're funny.

17
00:01:44,982 --> 00:01:46,968
- They're private.
- They're self-help CDs.

18
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:48,913
McLonely hearts ordered 'em.

19
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:51,152
<i>Download your destiny</i>.

20
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:53,904
Three easy payments of $19.95 each.
Satisfaction guaranteed

21
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:56,846
- or your money back.
- Maybe McGee is already satisfied.

22
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:58,973
Maybe there's an Easter bunny, too.

23
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:01,042
<i>Anyone can achieve
their fullest potential.</i>

24
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:03,305
<i>Who we are might be predetermined,</i>

25
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:05,656
<i>but the path we follow
is always of our own choosing.</i>

26
00:02:05,716 --> 00:02:07,376
- Turn that off.
- I love this guy.

27
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,230
Sort of a poor man's Shatner.

28
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,073
<i>We should never allow our fears
or the expectations of others</i>

29
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,008
<i> to set the frontiers
of our destiny.</i>

30
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:15,498
I've heard enough.

31
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:18,136
Maybe you're the one
who needs a little self-help.

32
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,766
See, that's where you're wrong, Ziva.
I'm already enlightened.

33
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,086
I know exactly who I am.

34
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,271
It may not be pretty,

35
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:29,038
but I am DiNozzo,

36
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:31,441
- hear me roar.
- Like an elephant?

37
00:02:32,162 --> 00:02:33,162
Grab your gear.

38
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:36,362
We got a dead civilian doctor
on naval academy grounds.

39
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:37,717
Gunshot.

40
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,950
- Get out of his desk.
- Getting out of his desk.

41
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,827
- Where's McGee?
- We do not know.

42
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:44,937
Maybe little Timmy
missed the short bus.

43
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:46,143
Find him.

44
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:50,378
I'll find him, and for being late,
he's buying coffee.

45
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:52,877
Here you go, Sir.

46
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:55,132
You sure this is mine?

47
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,884
- This seems like a lot for my order.
- It was just phoned in.

48
00:02:58,435 --> 00:02:59,247
Thanks.

49
00:03:03,582 --> 00:03:05,035
Can I help you with that?

50
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:08,354
Me?
No, no, I'm, I'm okay, thanks.

51
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,903
Be careful.
Don't want to burn yourself.

52
00:03:13,752 --> 00:03:15,110
I'm a trained professional.

53
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,570
I can tell.

54
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:22,034
I think I've seen you here before.
I'm Amanda.

55
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:24,078
Sorry.

56
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,479
I'm Tim.

57
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,513
- Do you live around here or...?
- I go to grad school.

58
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:30,293
I just... I come here
to work sometimes.

59
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:35,002
I've got a ring
in my front left pocket.

60
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:37,340
- Could you help me out?
- You... the phone?

61
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:38,727
Yes, phone, sorry.

62
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,388
Let me just...

63
00:03:48,886 --> 00:03:50,903
Sorry.
Yeah, Tony, what is it?

64
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:53,411
- <i>We got a call out, McGoo.</i>
- Yeah, I know, I'm coming.

65
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:55,317
- <i>With the coffees?</i>
- Yes, with the coffees.

66
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,717
<i>- Did you get my pastry?</i>
- Yes, I got your pastry.

67
00:03:57,777 --> 00:04:00,278
<i>Well, what's taking you so long?
Are you leaving now?</i>

68
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:01,484
<i>Get a McMove on.</i>

69
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:03,408
- Thanks, you can...
- Right.

70
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:08,698
- I have to run.
- I heard.

71
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:12,581
Would you maybe want
to get some coffee together

72
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:14,086
one morning with me?

73
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:17,332
Yeah, sure.

74
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,844
Here... is my number.

75
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:25,046
Call me.

76
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:26,724
Speed-dial.

77
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,475
The sooner the better.

78
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:36,781
Right, see you.

79
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:38,047
Bye.

80
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:47,118
License and registration indicate
the victim is a guy named

81
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:48,203
Dr. Elan Cirreux.

82
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:50,628
- Family?
- Divorced, no kids.

83
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:53,250
Owns a practice here in D.C.
and also in Paris.

84
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:56,508
- I'm here, boss.
- So nice of you to make it, Tim.

85
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,943
No excuses, won't happen again.

86
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:00,986
Danish in the car?

87
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:02,509
- Scone.
- Chocolate?

88
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:03,831
Blueberry.

89
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,605
I could tell you were with somebody,
you know.

90
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:09,379
Think I don't see that little glint
in your eye, spring in your step?

91
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,601
Spill, Probilicious.
What's her name? Spill.

92
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:14,571
I'm gonna get to work now.

93
00:05:15,888 --> 00:05:17,695
Checking prints
with the mobile AFIS.

94
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,984
So far, nothing other
than Cirreux's, and...

95
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,111
the surgical instruments used
were wiped clean,

96
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,988
but I did find...

97
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,704
some strands
of surgical threads on the carpet.

98
00:05:27,257 --> 00:05:28,609
Doc worked on somebody.

99
00:05:28,783 --> 00:05:30,881
So why here and not in a hospital?

100
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,990
Because the patient
didn't want to be seen, that's why.

101
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:37,378
I saw the PD report.

102
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:40,693
Details I've come across before.
I wanted to see for myself.

103
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:42,048
Copycat?

104
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:44,271
That would be a relief.

105
00:05:49,236 --> 00:05:51,642
- Why would he come to a crime scene?
- I don't know,

106
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,566
but he's here at this one.

107
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:58,272
You know, Jethro,
based on the significant blood loss...

108
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:04,988
- This is a surprise.
- What do you got, Doctor?

109
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:08,206
Well, I can't confirm it
till I get him back to autopsy,

110
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:10,202
but it seems to me that the killer

111
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:14,122
intentionally shot
his victim in such a way

112
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:17,012
that he slowly bled out.

113
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:19,466
You mean,
they wanted it to be painful?

114
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,805
Well, torturous is more like it.

115
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:25,115
The victim fell back into the brush

116
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:27,845
but later on was turned over so

117
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:31,055
a second bullet could be delivered
into the base of the skull.

118
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:32,599
Severing the brain stem.

119
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,270
Both shots fired
with uncanny precision.

120
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:41,608
You've seen this before.

121
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:43,816
It's her signature.

122
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:47,489
She always delivers
a second shot to finish the job.

123
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:49,503
Who is she?

124
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:53,537
Lee Wuan Kai,
a North Korean operative.

125
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,578
She was just in Los Angeles.

126
00:06:56,077 --> 00:06:57,236
I read the report.

127
00:06:57,675 --> 00:07:00,501
- Kai was wounded and then disappeared.
- I'm convinced she's here now.

128
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,421
And why Cirreux?

129
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:04,294
Kai was pretty badly hurt.

130
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:07,259
She must have gotten
some medical attention, traveled to D.C.

131
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:09,178
Probably carjacked the doctor,

132
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:12,133
forced him to treat her,
and then she killed him.

133
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,016
A lot of theorizing.

134
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:16,014
You questioning me?

135
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,064
You chase somebody for almost 20 years,
you start to think like 'em.

136
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:24,650
In some ways,
I know Kai better than I know myself.

137
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,571
- Coincidence, huh?
- Maybe.

138
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:31,408
You think finding this body
in my jurisdiction is coincidence?

139
00:07:42,015 --> 00:07:43,049
Director?

140
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,173
- Find Kai.
- We're on it.

141
00:07:47,463 --> 00:07:50,177
She'll use deadly force.
So should you.

142
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:01,772
Lee Wuan Kai, North Korean assassin,

143
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,606
one-time fanatical nationalist,

144
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,317
credited with 27 targeted hits
in seven countries,

145
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,027
dozens more by association.

146
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,822
She likes quiet walks on the beach,

147
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:13,616
laughing with friends, and playing
Frisbee with her Cocker Spaniel Rufus.

148
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:16,652
- It does not say that.
- Well, it might as well.

149
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:20,480
Look at those come-hither eyes,
those perfect kiss-me-now lips.

150
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,980
No wonder Vance is obsessed.

151
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,460
Kai's killing me
and I'm just looking at her.

152
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:27,047
You and Kai are probably
a lot more alike than you think.

153
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:29,091
- I do not follow.
- Really?

154
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:31,509
Couple of pretty ladies,
both trained assassins.

155
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,470
- You annoy me sometimes.
- Sometimes?

156
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,847
Most of the time.

157
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:38,113
Well, something big must have happened
between Kai and Vance.

158
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:41,854
Seriously, Director shows up
at a crime scene, that's not kosher.

159
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,688
Figure of speech.

160
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:47,776
Ogling the numbers
of the new girl, huh?

161
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,696
Look at you, McDigit.

162
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:54,431
I'm having
a Kreskin-like intuition here.

163
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:55,663
Is she a redhead?

164
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:57,494
She is.

165
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,180
Look at you,
pulling a page from the Gibbs playbook.

166
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,293
- Nice.
- Do not pay attention to him, McGee.

167
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:05,168
Whoever she is,
I am sure she is lovely.

168
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:06,783
Thank you, Ziva.

169
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:09,904
Why is she nice to you
and not to me?

170
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,899
Maybe because you broke into my desk
and stole my motivational CDs.

171
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,188
- I put them back.
- You mocked me publicly.

172
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,555
- I always do that.
- Maybe they're working.

173
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,558
Maybe you should stop drinking
the motivational Kool-Aid.

174
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,231
Ran the victim's name
through the D.C. attorney's office.

175
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,024
There's a lawsuit pending against...

176
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,346
Elan Cirreux.

177
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:32,320
Threats made, one B and E charge at
his home, multiple police reports filed.

178
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:34,239
So he ticked somebody off.

179
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:37,045
He's a Doctor.
What they lack in social skills,

180
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:39,285
they make up for in handing out
free pharmaceuticals.

181
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,870
A local nurse by the name of

182
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:44,275
Linda Demarco accused him
of sexual assault.

183
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,783
Report quotes her as saying
she wanted to kill him.

184
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:50,088
Maybe it's not
Lee Wuan Kai after all.

185
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,931
I'm going to add more agents
to the investigation.

186
00:10:01,694 --> 00:10:02,694
Your decision.

187
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:06,980
You didn't give me much time,
though.

188
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,566
I've had almost two decades.
How much more time do you need?

189
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:11,610
You want it to be her, I get that.

190
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:15,302
No, I want it to be over,
and based on those two gunshot wounds...

191
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:17,240
Two gunshot wounds
doesn't mean she's here.

192
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:19,219
The hell it doesn't.

193
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:24,402
Keep talking, Leon.

194
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:31,586
Just keep talking.
I want it all.

195
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:41,066
17 years ago,

196
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,850
a UN peacekeeping force
marches into Yugoslavia.

197
00:10:45,503 --> 00:10:47,490
Entire city of Belgrade went purple.

198
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:49,856
They pulled from every branch.

199
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:53,034
So, one night,
we're walking near the opera house.

200
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:56,280
Somebody takes a shot
at a local politico.

201
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:58,506
Can't even remember his name.

202
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:00,158
The shooter...

203
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:01,799
was this young girl.

204
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,536
Kai.

205
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:08,584
So, my partner, Neil Wilson and I,
we were the first ones on the scene.

206
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,559
I landed a shot in her chest.

207
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:13,130
I killed her.

208
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,858
But she gets up
like nothing ever happened.

209
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:20,625
Puts one in my shoulder
and she put two in Neil.

210
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:24,684
And while I'm lying there,

211
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:26,641
looking at him,

212
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:30,022
I can feel her piece up
against my neck.

213
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:32,852
So, now I'm waiting.

214
00:11:33,298 --> 00:11:34,709
You know, I'm praying.

215
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:38,959
But it never happened.

216
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:42,903
Every day I think about his wife
and I think about his baby.

217
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:47,974
And here I am.

218
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:54,676
Give me something solid.

219
00:11:55,761 --> 00:11:57,591
Solid doesn't exist.

220
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,244
That's why the Serbs
call her "utvara".

221
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:02,476
The phantom.

222
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:07,536
<i>Boss, I got Demarco's home address.
Taking Tony for backup.</i>

223
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:09,591
Check it out.

224
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:12,755
- Is that a lead?
- Not on Kai.

225
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:15,844
If we get anything,
you'll be the first to know.

226
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:24,181
Is that Amanda?
The coffee vixen?

227
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,178
Maybe.

228
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:27,863
Text sex, huh?

229
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:31,208
Will you ask her what a question mark
wedged between two dollar signs means?

230
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:33,366
'Cause it sounds
kind of kinky to me.

231
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:35,799
She wants to see me tonight,
but I'm probably working.

232
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:37,048
Don't tell her that.

233
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:39,716
Tell her you've arranged a water bed,
some squirt guns and

234
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:41,268
a little bit of candle wax.

235
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:43,345
Listen to Madonna, too.

236
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:44,775
Women like Madonna.

237
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:48,016
Ms. Demarco?

238
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,845
NCIS. We need to speak with you.

239
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:55,774
Ms. Demarco, open up.
We want to talk to you.

240
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:01,655
Federal agents, drop it!

241
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:04,700
Did that piece of filth
Cirreux send you?!

242
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:06,827
Because I've got a message for him!

243
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,036
You can tell him...

244
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,289
Did you say Federal agents?

245
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,624
Yes! Federal agents!

246
00:13:13,873 --> 00:13:15,544
Cirreux's dead.
Put the weapon down!

247
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:22,925
Hands in the air!
Who do you think you are?

248
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:25,264
- Sarah Palin?
- Sorry.

249
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,245
Ms. Demarco's alibi checks out.

250
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:32,624
She was working a double shift
at Washington General.

251
00:13:32,684 --> 00:13:35,374
Maybe she slipped out for a few minutes.
Just long enough to kill him.

252
00:13:35,434 --> 00:13:36,403
It's not her.

253
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:38,859
Boss, she shot at us
with a very big gun.

254
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:40,777
It happens.

255
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:43,978
- What happens?
- People, they react.

256
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:46,032
- Irrationally.
- Sometimes.

257
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:48,066
Call Metro. Fine her.

258
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:50,245
- Take away her toys.
- That's it?

259
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,783
Yeah.
She didn't do it.

260
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,459
You heard him, self-helpless.
Call metro.

261
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:58,637
- You call.
- Okay. Then you uncuff her.

262
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,591
- You're afraid of the nurse, huh?
- You are, too.

263
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:06,009
I'll call Metro.

264
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:08,204
You uncuff Florence Nightingale.

265
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:10,722
Because it's your destiny.

266
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:16,438
Apart from Brie-clogged arteries
and a liver that's processed

267
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,760
too much Bordeaux,
our dearly departed physician

268
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,744
was in relatively good health.

269
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:22,717
Probably would have lived
another two decades

270
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:25,447
if he hadn't been gunned down
in his golden years.

271
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,352
Yeah, so what's so puzzling, Duck?

272
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:30,411
Something I found on the body,
not in it.

273
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:32,538
A single human capillus.

274
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,529
- A hair?
- Yes.

275
00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:37,983
- The guy's covered in them.
- Yeah, but not like this one.

276
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:39,794
See for yourself.

277
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:44,424
A solitary black hair
on his ring finger

278
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,092
tied in a perfect bow.

279
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:47,552
- A message.
- Yes.

280
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,133
And a rather ingenious one.

281
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:52,438
Made of DNA
which the killer wanted us to find.

282
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,769
I took the liberty of removing
the follicular tail and

283
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:58,752
sent it up to Ms. Sciuto
for analysis.

284
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:03,818
<i>Hey, guys.
Cool, huh?</i>

285
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:05,278
Yeah, if you like hair.

286
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:07,149
I ran the sample.

287
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,909
When you pull a hair from your scalp,
there's traces of blood at the root.

288
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,453
<i>That blood, in this case,
was high in white blood cells</i>

289
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,581
<i>because your white count goes up when
you're fighting injury or infection.</i>

290
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,584
<i>The blood confirms
they needed a Doctor. You got an I. D.?</i>

291
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:22,420
I took the liberty of running
the DNA strand through CODIS

292
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,257
<i> and the Interpol DNA database.
I got hits on both.</i>

293
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:31,642
<i>Just like the Director predicted.</i>

294
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:32,639
It's Kai.

295
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:45,426
Dinner's almost ready.

296
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:46,977
I'm not hungry.

297
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,095
Well, don't have me get worried
about you now.

298
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:55,115
There's plenty of other things
to worry about.

299
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,048
Where'd you send the kids?

300
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:03,460
Over to Alana's.
They do movie night with popcorn.

301
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,277
Why don't we ever do movie night?

302
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:08,839
'Cause you ain't never home.

303
00:16:09,363 --> 00:16:11,635
Yeah, well, there is that,
isn't there?

304
00:16:13,868 --> 00:16:16,285
You know, when you called
and said you were coming home early,

305
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:18,610
I thought something was up.
What's going on?

306
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:20,645
I'm just thinking about things.

307
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,768
What kind of things?

308
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:32,183
How long this time, Honey?

309
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:34,826
Off and on since I got back
from Los Angeles.

310
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:37,186
- Please don't do this again.
- It's not that easy.

311
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,694
- Come on, please...
- Jackie, it's not that easy.

312
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:43,418
You have a family.

313
00:16:43,854 --> 00:16:45,003
So did he.

314
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,300
I'm taking dinner off.

315
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:04,891
Hello?

316
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:06,775
<i>Hello, Leon.</i>

317
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:08,360
<i>Happy to hear from me?</i>

318
00:17:09,142 --> 00:17:10,585
First California

319
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:12,309
and now here.

320
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:15,004
Washington's beautiful.

321
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:16,493
<i>How'd you get this number?</i>

322
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:19,150
Give a girl some credit.

323
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,084
I've been doing this for a while.

324
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,949
<i>You should know
that better than anyone.</i>

325
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:27,663
Every law enforcement officer
in the national capital region

326
00:17:27,723 --> 00:17:29,255
is looking for you, Kai.

327
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,766
I'm flattered.

328
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:36,298
But I only have eyes for you,
Director.

329
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,045
Kai's on the Director's home line
right now. Trace it.

330
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:43,937
I'm on it.

331
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,541
- DiNozzo, get somebody over there.
- It's rush hour, boss.

332
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:48,400
She chose rush hour
just for this reason.

333
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,835
Come on, McGee.

334
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:52,987
Back-tracing the call.
These land lines are slow.

335
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:56,769
Keep talking, Leon.
Just keep talking.

336
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,296
I know you're hurt.

337
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:02,313
I guarantee you,
I'll take care of you.

338
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:04,582
You'll be taken care of
if you turn yourself in.

339
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:05,947
Turn myself in?

340
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:11,297
- You know I can't do that.
<i>- We've been though this before, Kai.</i>

341
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,231
In Munich, in Prague, in Tokyo.

342
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:16,177
<i>And to think</i>

343
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,596
you almost caught me in Los Angeles.

344
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:19,890
Give up.

345
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,950
<i>I can't.</i>

346
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:23,768
I have something I have to do.

347
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,395
You might not get another chance.

348
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,398
- Got it. Boss...
- What do we got?

349
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,298
She's right in front
of the Director's house.

350
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:41,980
You listen to me.

351
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:44,038
You know this won't end well.

352
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:46,026
And when it does...

353
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:49,627
will you miss me?

354
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:58,303
Hello?

355
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:03,141
Can I help you?

356
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:07,562
Jackie! Get back!

357
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:09,896
Leon, what?

358
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:17,030
Oh, my god.

359
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:18,856
Who was that?

360
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,118
Come on.
Come on, let's go inside.

361
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:28,508
Ziva will spend the night.

362
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:29,484
No, she won't.

363
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,419
Then we'll go to the safe house.

364
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:34,672
- We're not going anywhere.
- That's the wrong decision.

365
00:19:35,364 --> 00:19:37,187
It's the right decision for me.

366
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:41,459
Agent David,
will you excuse us, please?

367
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,096
Gibbs, I'll be outside.

368
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,353
Why run if you can't hide?

369
00:19:48,697 --> 00:19:50,836
No matter where we go,
it won't make any difference.

370
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:52,690
Kai is that good.

371
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:54,776
We'll handle it.

372
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:56,408
Go.

373
00:19:57,798 --> 00:19:58,988
I can protect my own.

374
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:02,206
I'll get Jackie and the kids
on the first plane out of here.

375
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:03,451
No, you won't.

376
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:06,955
'Cause I'm not going anywhere
without you.

377
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:11,389
You know, Leon, when you took this job,
I knew that there was risk involved.

378
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:15,395
I knew I'd be watching over my shoulder
every day, but I always felt safe.

379
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,443
Until now.

380
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:19,648
And, yeah,

381
00:20:20,062 --> 00:20:22,227
this woman may have killed
your partner.

382
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:26,057
But you're my partner now.

383
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,913
And I'm not going anywhere.

384
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:36,368
Round the clock, at least two agents.
Vehicle escorts, too.

385
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:37,958
Done.

386
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:47,708
Boss, partial plate Vance
gave us belongs to a stolen car.

387
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:48,705
Not surprised.

388
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:51,865
Taken from a lot
at Bingham air field outside Fairfax.

389
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,669
Think I just read something
in the paper about Bingham.

390
00:20:55,936 --> 00:20:58,131
Jason Cutler out of Van Nuys,
California,

391
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,914
flew his private plane
across the country three days ago.

392
00:21:00,974 --> 00:21:04,262
After arriving safely in Fairfax,
family and friends reported him missing.

393
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,048
Tell Abby. Dust the plane for prints.
It looks like we found Kai's flight.

394
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:10,518
- So, where's the pilot?
- Dead. Most likely.

395
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:11,895
He was Kai-jacked.

396
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:15,356
- Did you really just say that?
- I regret it already.

397
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,025
Start digging for anything on Kai.

398
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,193
I've got calls into Baker, CIA
and Alterza, Interpol.

399
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,195
Recall Special Agent Dunham.
Tell him it's her. He'll know why.

400
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:37,703
I only have like 15 minutes.

401
00:21:38,304 --> 00:21:40,214
Let me guess. Work.

402
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:43,085
You could have called.

403
00:21:43,732 --> 00:21:44,732
Yeah, but I...

404
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,174
I wanted to see you.

405
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,163
I figured
that we could at least talk.

406
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:53,655
- Listen...
- What if we...?

407
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:54,646
Sorry.

408
00:21:55,212 --> 00:21:58,149
You want to go for a walk
just for a few minutes?

409
00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:00,234
Where? To your office?

410
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:01,653
Just around.

411
00:22:02,764 --> 00:22:04,469
We could get something to go.

412
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:06,825
Like what?

413
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,369
- Garlic Bread?
- Cannolis?

414
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:14,038
Maybe we could figure out
dessert later.

415
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:15,917
When you're done.

416
00:22:16,243 --> 00:22:17,627
It's gonna be late.

417
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:19,248
Really late.

418
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:23,136
Well, I have a paper due.

419
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,807
I'll be up anyway.

420
00:22:27,537 --> 00:22:30,096
You want... you want me
to call you when I get home?

421
00:22:31,356 --> 00:22:32,404
I can come over.

422
00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:34,550
I mean...

423
00:22:35,378 --> 00:22:36,888
If you want me to.

424
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:46,546
Morning.
Heck of a day, isn't it?

425
00:22:49,153 --> 00:22:50,160
You went home?

426
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,227
Just for an hour.

427
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,548
I've been talking
to agents all night, doing recon,

428
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,052
and you went home
and got your game on with little,

429
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,835
sexy, miss text message.

430
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:01,619
Ziva, look at him.

431
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:03,172
What are you talking about?

432
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,383
He's oozing a musky, caveman-esque,

433
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:08,928
primitive satisfaction.
Like Heston in <i>Planet of the Apes</i>.

434
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:11,889
And it didn't matter
that world was ruled by orangutans,

435
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,851
because Heston went straight
for the mute chick in the loincloth.

436
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,270
You pulled a total Heston,
didn't you?

437
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:20,231
I don't know about that.
It was only a few minutes.

438
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,401
Yeah. Sometimes that's all it takes,

439
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,278
in my middle-aged world.

440
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:27,859
You are so jealous.

441
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,408
Yes, I am, and there's nothing wrong
with that. I'm proud of Tim.

442
00:23:31,238 --> 00:23:33,494
I'm very proud of you.
Did you take any pictures?

443
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:35,367
Please.

444
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,416
I am anxious to meet her.
Make sure she's good enough for you.

445
00:23:39,144 --> 00:23:40,793
She is definitely good enough.

446
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:42,965
Conference room. Now.

447
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:48,468
You folks sure look better in person
than on a laptop 7,000 miles away.

448
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,074
You look cleaner.

449
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:51,971
Welcome home,
by the way, Agent David.

450
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,765
I haven't had a chance
to say that yet.

451
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,994
Thank you for your help during
the mission, Agent Dunham.

452
00:23:57,054 --> 00:23:58,352
Anything to help a lady.

453
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:03,323
Well, you...
you did help us out there, Pal.

454
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:05,026
- Thanks.
- Happy to oblige.

455
00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:08,190
Lee Wuan Kai.

456
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:12,575
Director's been assembling a file
for years, but you, Dunham...

457
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,746
You have had first-hand exposure.

458
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,385
Yeah, early in my career.

459
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,097
My second foreign field assignment

460
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:22,585
was in the demilitarized zone
outside of Pyongyang, North Korea.

461
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:24,712
You monitored the Chinese border?

462
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,297
Movement along the Amnok river.

463
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:28,717
Kim Jong-Il
had an agreement with the Chinese.

464
00:24:28,777 --> 00:24:30,815
Let his ops use the river
to exit the country,

465
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,554
and he'd make it worth their while
with a lot of government-grown opium.

466
00:24:33,802 --> 00:24:36,724
- One of those ops was Kai?
- She was the boss's go-to.

467
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,935
And who could blame him.
Kai was the best.

468
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,151
In the early '80s,

469
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:43,355
an ambitious upper-level minister
started training young girls,

470
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,769
orphans mostly,
to kill for the cause.

471
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:49,278
They fed 'em, housed 'em,
gave 'em a life worth living, sort of.

472
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:52,698
I've done a little research on my own,
and based on what I've gathered,

473
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,379
Kai was brainwashed.

474
00:24:54,652 --> 00:24:56,244
Started off innocent, but...

475
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,538
when the others cracked, she didn't.

476
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:01,332
<i>Shor</i>.
In Hebrew, it means the bull. Stubborn.

477
00:25:01,675 --> 00:25:04,001
- It is why she's so good.
- You should know.

478
00:25:05,683 --> 00:25:07,681
Is that why she's here, for Vance?

479
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,428
- That's not doubtful.
- I made some calls, talked to CIA.

480
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:15,138
Evidently,
old reliable isn't what she used to be.

481
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:17,795
- Government's losing patience with her.
- Name?

482
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:19,263
It's probably Pak Su Ji.

483
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:21,978
He's an old Lieutenant, been around
since day one of the program.

484
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:25,289
Now he's retired,
part of a permanent mission to the UN.

485
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:29,394
You know,
it's funny that Kai's here,

486
00:25:29,454 --> 00:25:32,411
and he just checked into a downtown
hotel, don't y'all think?

487
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,363
It's in your blood, isn't it?

488
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:42,992
- What is?
- You're thinking how you'd get him.

489
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,668
Maybe some intense mind games,

490
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,045
followed by

491
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:49,338
sheer force?

492
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:52,594
Go for the jugular,
or the slow kill.

493
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,237
- You're a dangerous woman.
- Who am I getting?

494
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,471
Agent Dunham?

495
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:00,370
Why would you want Dunham?

496
00:26:00,716 --> 00:26:02,609
I thought we were talking
about Pak Su Ji.

497
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:04,521
Dunham is from Texas.
I like Texas.

498
00:26:04,757 --> 00:26:06,230
What is the saying anyway?

499
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:08,691
He cleans up nice.

500
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,116
Not that nice.

501
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:14,655
- I thought he was kind of creepy.
- Come on, stop being such big brother.

502
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:17,200
He's a field agent, a nomad.

503
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,096
I've had enough of that in my life.

504
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:20,995
I came to NCIS,

505
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,637
to settle down,

506
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:24,583
to make a home for myself.

507
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:29,076
The last thing I need
is a Chad Dunham.

508
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,290
- However...
- What?

509
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,465
Well, to answer your question,

510
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,090
how would I...

511
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:43,883
get him.

512
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:47,330
Brute force is very intriguing.

513
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,738
And who are
we talking about right now?

514
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:51,901
Pak Su Ji or the Texas longhorn?

515
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:02,005
So, why am I looking
at a bullet from an L.A. case file?

516
00:27:02,362 --> 00:27:05,930
Because it's different than the slugs
that Kai used to kill Cirreux.

517
00:27:06,328 --> 00:27:08,378
Normally, she uses a larger caliber.

518
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:11,645
This one was planned
for specific damage, so Ducky was right.

519
00:27:12,227 --> 00:27:14,412
So that means the ballistics report
is not done yet?

520
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,550
Nope, it's not done.

521
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:20,117
Okay. Guess I'll come back later.

522
00:27:23,645 --> 00:27:24,652
You look...

523
00:27:24,891 --> 00:27:25,601
happy.

524
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:28,528
- I do?
- Yeah.

525
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,730
It's a... it's

526
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,818
becoming, actually.
You're, like, confident.

527
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,220
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

528
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,170
No.

529
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:40,741
You sure?

530
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,840
Nothing's new? Nothing at all?

531
00:27:45,102 --> 00:27:46,414
I started seeing someone.

532
00:27:48,411 --> 00:27:50,485
I know. And I'm thrilled.

533
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:53,754
I totally am.
I was just waiting for you to say it.

534
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,507
- Word travels fast.
- Well, tell me about her.

535
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,009
No. You know what?

536
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:00,668
Don't. You don't have to.

537
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:01,948
I'm just...

538
00:28:02,238 --> 00:28:03,760
I think it's excellent.

539
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,475
Thanks, Abby.

540
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:10,563
You know, Eric,
from the L.A. Office...

541
00:28:11,212 --> 00:28:13,691
He's been, like, crazy helpful
with this whole Kai thing.

542
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:15,484
That's great.

543
00:28:16,054 --> 00:28:18,029
I haven't met him yet.
You've met him.

544
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,532
I've only been to California once
for my second cousin's wedding.

545
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,025
But I don't really remember my second
cousin's wedding, 'cause I was six,

546
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:27,955
and I had this weird allergic reaction
to avocados...

547
00:28:28,722 --> 00:28:31,042
Abby, I really got
to get back upstairs.

548
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:32,785
Right. Definitely.

549
00:28:34,236 --> 00:28:36,062
Just let me know
when the report's done.

550
00:28:38,506 --> 00:28:39,684
Congrats again.

551
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:50,561
You expect me to contact
the North Koreans and say what?

552
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,605
Kai might be here
to kill one of their own.

553
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,148
- Based on?
- A theory.

554
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:55,432
A hunch.

555
00:28:55,492 --> 00:28:58,986
Just because Pak Su Ji's in town
doesn't make him Kai's next target.

556
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,671
- Besides, why would they ever listen?
- Why not?

557
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,034
What is she doing, Gibbs?

558
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,640
She came to my house.

559
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:08,798
She could have killed me,
but she didn't.

560
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:12,083
- It's like she's playing some game.
- How long have you known her, Leon?

561
00:29:12,328 --> 00:29:13,965
- Too long.
- You're the constant.

562
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:15,928
- No, I'm the enemy.
- Are you?

563
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:19,548
What is she doing?
What does she really want?

564
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:21,840
You know her well. You tell me.

565
00:29:23,997 --> 00:29:25,638
I am sorry, Director. The TV...

566
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:27,064
Turn it on.

567
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:32,247
<i>... going live to Guy Ross
for the latest on the Capitol shooting.</i>

568
00:29:32,307 --> 00:29:35,106
<i>Sniper fire just steps
from the nation's Capitol.</i>

569
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,571
<i>Shortly before 3:00 p.m.</i>

570
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:40,235
<i>this afternoon, shots were fired at
former North Korean official Pak Su Ji.</i>

571
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,056
<i>The retired military officer</i>

572
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,592
<i>and one-time key figure
in North Korean politics</i>

573
00:29:44,872 --> 00:29:48,330
<i>arrived in town yesterday to participate
in a United Nations open forum.</i>

574
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:50,953
<i>Metro police and FBI
are on the scene.</i>

575
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:54,840
<i>An ambulance took Pak Su Ji
to nearby Monroe University hospital</i>

576
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,023
<i>where's he's being rushed
into surgery right now.</i>

577
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,292
<i>A citywide manhunt is underway
for the shooter.</i>

578
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,852
<i>Police are asking anyone
who was in the Capitol area</i>

579
00:30:01,912 --> 00:30:04,093
<i>who may have seen something
to come forward.</i>

580
00:30:04,153 --> 00:30:05,587
<i>ZNN first on the scene...</i>

581
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,643
<i>At 2:51 this afternoon, Pak Su Ji...</i>

582
00:30:13,081 --> 00:30:14,753
Pak Su Ji is still alive.

583
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,857
He was hit by two long-range,
seven-millimeter sniper rounds.

584
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,358
He's in surgery as we speak.

585
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,635
- Any details?
- Metro PD, FBI are scouring the area.

586
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,363
Nothing left behind, nothing found.

587
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:25,985
Well, she is the best.

588
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:27,783
No, she's not.
The guy's still alive.

589
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,229
Maybe Kai really is off her game.

590
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:31,328
So, who is next?

591
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,705
Kai's an assassin, right?

592
00:30:32,985 --> 00:30:34,069
She shoots people.

593
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:37,168
We know she's here because she turned up
outside the Director's house.

594
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,003
There was that first victim,
the Doctor.

595
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,589
And now, she's gunned down
this government stooge?

596
00:30:41,846 --> 00:30:42,953
There's a pattern.

597
00:30:43,013 --> 00:30:46,051
So, if she's not working for her country
anymore, who is she killing for?

598
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:51,903
Right away.

599
00:30:52,514 --> 00:30:55,352
That was the State Department.
There's a message for us

600
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:56,999
from the North Koreans.

601
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,607
<i>Director Vance, Special Agent Gibbs.</i>

602
00:30:59,803 --> 00:31:01,275
What can we do for you, ma'am?

603
00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:04,409
<i>The North Koreans have contacted us
through back channels.</i>

604
00:31:04,469 --> 00:31:06,278
<i>They are saddened
about today's events,</i>

605
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:08,984
<i>and they are well aware
of your ongoing relationship</i>

606
00:31:09,044 --> 00:31:10,768
<i>with former operative Lee Wuan Kai.</i>

607
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:11,918
Former?

608
00:31:11,978 --> 00:31:13,112
<i>That is correct.</i>

609
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,748
<i>They give their word
that if she is responsible</i>

610
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,843
<i>in any way for the recent bloodshed,</i>

611
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,122
<i>it is against the wishes
of their government.</i>

612
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:23,464
If that's true, will the North Koreans
help us capture her?

613
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:24,972
<i>Absolutely, Director,</i>

614
00:31:25,032 --> 00:31:28,539
<i>and then prosecute her to the fullest
extent of their laws and ours.</i>

615
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:32,463
It's almost
like Kai's dangling it in his face.

616
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,298
Like she's saying:

617
00:31:34,748 --> 00:31:36,159
"Here I am, Director.

618
00:31:37,097 --> 00:31:38,480
I shot another one."

619
00:31:39,057 --> 00:31:40,338
"Look at me, ma.

620
00:31:40,747 --> 00:31:42,079
Top of the world."

621
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:45,638
- Who was that?
- It was Cagney in <i>White Heat.</i>

622
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,780
The one with the ballet dancers.

623
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:50,731
That's <i>White Nights</i> with Gregory Hines
and Mikhail Baryshnikov.

624
00:31:51,226 --> 00:31:53,841
Anyway, maybe Kai
was just trying to impress him.

625
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:56,705
There is nothing impressive
about killing people, Tony, trust me.

626
00:31:59,474 --> 00:32:00,960
McGee, your McQueeze is here.

627
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,632
Amanda? How'd she get upstairs?

628
00:32:05,692 --> 00:32:07,675
Security called.
I said, bring her on up.

629
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:09,635
Surprise, surprise.

630
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,267
I got your text,
but I wanted to say good night.

631
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,842
Amanda, these are my coworkers.

632
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:19,080
This is Tony.

633
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,854
And this is Ziva.

634
00:32:21,683 --> 00:32:23,028
- Hi there.
- Hi.

635
00:32:23,088 --> 00:32:25,067
- It is a pleasure to meet you.
- She's lying.

636
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:26,485
I am not.

637
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:29,104
Would you like a slice of pizza?

638
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,365
- Sure, yeah.
- Actually, on second thought,

639
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,784
why don't you take her
on a tour of the facility?

640
00:32:34,222 --> 00:32:35,630
Yeah, that would be awesome.

641
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,319
Also, the copy room door
locks from the inside.

642
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:42,606
We actually have a lot of work to do,
Amanda.

643
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,826
So, I'm going to have
to take you back downstairs.

644
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:47,339
Well, it was nice to meet you.

645
00:32:47,677 --> 00:32:49,300
Nice to meet you, too. Bye.

646
00:32:52,826 --> 00:32:54,311
Well, they seem good together.

647
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:56,035
Like it was meant to be.

648
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:58,689
If you believe in that kinda thing.

649
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,149
Did I embarrass you?

650
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,339
No.

651
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:09,599
- No, they're my friends.
- They seem great.

652
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:12,155
Maybe we could all go out sometime.

653
00:33:13,012 --> 00:33:14,016
Maybe.

654
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:15,873
When we are done.

655
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:17,836
Done with what?

656
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:21,110
Right.

657
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,442
No questions.

658
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:32,164
Coffee. Tomorrow morning.

659
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,022
I'll be there.

660
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,946
Traffic should be pretty light tonight,
gentlemen.

661
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:52,448
Let's go home.

662
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:25,065
When did he pass away?

663
00:34:27,003 --> 00:34:28,273
- Interesting.
- What?

664
00:34:28,852 --> 00:34:31,735
Well, I'm comparing Pak Su Ji's
toxicology report to Cirreux's.

665
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,807
They both contracted hand,
foot, mouth virus late in life.

666
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,699
It's common with kids,
but not with adults.

667
00:34:37,002 --> 00:34:40,035
- You know it stays dormant in the body?
- That why you called me, down here?

668
00:34:40,301 --> 00:34:41,870
No. I called you because of this.

669
00:34:42,388 --> 00:34:45,374
Pak Su Ji did not die
from his gunshot wounds, Gibbs.

670
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:48,812
Something in his bloodstream triggered
a massive heart attack after surgery.

671
00:34:48,872 --> 00:34:52,414
Something invisible that never had
the chance to spread through the Doctor.

672
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:54,258
- Something like...?
- Poison.

673
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:57,511
Both Kai's .22 rounds
and the rifle slugs

674
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,764
were dipped in a lethal toxin
called Atropa Belladonna.

675
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:02,747
Never trust a beautiful woman.

676
00:35:03,588 --> 00:35:06,478
Whoever shot Cirreux
also shot the North Korean.

677
00:35:06,745 --> 00:35:09,109
And wanted to make sure
that if the bullets didn't kill him,

678
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:10,232
the poison would.

679
00:35:10,827 --> 00:35:12,943
- Backup system.
- She created her own fail-safe.

680
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:15,394
What are you hiding?

681
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:20,993
It's too late. I can't.

682
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,873
You are an enabler.

683
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:27,935
And I love you for it.

684
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,719
Gosh, you look beat.
Let's go sit down.

685
00:35:41,077 --> 00:35:42,152
Are you okay?

686
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:45,818
I've been up all night.

687
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,020
Why? What happened?

688
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:52,649
Come on, you're scaring me, Tim.
What, what is it?

689
00:35:54,077 --> 00:35:55,152
Last night...

690
00:35:56,751 --> 00:35:58,624
last night,
something didn't seem right.

691
00:35:58,684 --> 00:35:59,695
I know.

692
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:02,242
You were busy.
I shouldn't have come to visit. Sorry.

693
00:36:02,612 --> 00:36:04,285
Amanda, how'd you know where I work?

694
00:36:05,214 --> 00:36:06,238
You told me.

695
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,749
You said you worked at NCIS.

696
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,710
I asked you and you told me.
I remember exactly what you said.

697
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,962
No. I never tell people that.

698
00:36:14,235 --> 00:36:16,494
I give them cell numbers.
I give them beepers.

699
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:18,992
But you knew.

700
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:21,804
Where's Kai?

701
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:24,672
What'd you say?
Where is she, Tim?

702
00:36:24,962 --> 00:36:25,969
I need to know.

703
00:36:26,568 --> 00:36:29,180
Tell me, right now, where you think
Kai is or I swear I'll...

704
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:51,792
Amanda's real name
was Juliet Tippon.

705
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:53,752
She was born in South Africa.

706
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,339
She worked for her own government
before hanging up a freelance shingle.

707
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:00,675
North Koreans hired her to get Kai
before we could.

708
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:03,029
Why?

709
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,179
For fear that Kai might give up
and join us.

710
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:07,200
Tell us what she knows.

711
00:37:07,514 --> 00:37:08,931
Amanda was going to kill me.

712
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:11,060
Yeah. Sure.
If you didn't give her Kai.

713
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:12,959
Instead, Kai saved your life.

714
00:37:19,677 --> 00:37:21,321
She left this in my car last night.

715
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:23,698
Why save an NCIS agent?

716
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:26,001
Why send these messages?

717
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:30,833
Gonna join a monastery.

718
00:37:30,893 --> 00:37:32,685
Connect Cirreux to Pak Su Ji.

719
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:36,295
Well, the poison's new.
It's not part of Kai's previous MO.

720
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,520
- Two targets from two different worlds.
- Both old guys.

721
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:41,888
Lots of money,
homes in multiple countries.

722
00:37:41,948 --> 00:37:43,160
Both womanizers.

723
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:44,508
But no kids.

724
00:37:48,952 --> 00:37:49,975
What'd you say?

725
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,643
They don't have kids.
Some people don't like rug rats.

726
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,831
Both have a kid's disease. Why?

727
00:37:54,891 --> 00:37:56,772
They both had hand,
foot, mouth virus.

728
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,524
They had to be exposed
at some point.

729
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,602
- I hate it when he does that.
- It's totally unsatisfying.

730
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,286
What do we know about the training
program that recruited Kai?

731
00:38:09,565 --> 00:38:12,723
A whole team of people.
Military, Doctors, government types.

732
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:14,957
Abs, bring up the group shot.

733
00:38:15,262 --> 00:38:16,126
Yep.

734
00:38:17,406 --> 00:38:19,649
That photo's 30 years old.
That's Kai.

735
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,380
Right there in the middle.

736
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,264
And this...

737
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,768
Is a young Pak Su Ji.

738
00:38:33,431 --> 00:38:34,519
And this...

739
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:38,968
Is Dr. Cirreux.

740
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,117
She's murdering the men
who did this to her.

741
00:38:42,646 --> 00:38:44,524
Who turned her into a killer.

742
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:48,986
Why indeed?

743
00:38:50,837 --> 00:38:53,244
To think of the loss
that could have been avoided.

744
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:56,477
So, what now, Duck?

745
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,253
Does she keep hunting down the people
who did this to her?

746
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:01,199
I doubt there are any left.

747
00:39:01,657 --> 00:39:04,090
Cirreux
was their medical consultant.

748
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,385
He physically robbed her
of her childhood.

749
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:10,847
He turned weak little girls
into cold hearted killers.

750
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:13,188
Pak Su Ji?

751
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:16,492
The father figure.
The puppet master...

752
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:19,064
for Kai the Frankenstein.

753
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:23,312
For her, those two were
the responsible parental figures.

754
00:39:23,372 --> 00:39:24,423
What about Vance?

755
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:27,558
Well, all her life,
she was pursued by one man.

756
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,076
Not physically or sexually,
of course, but mentally.

757
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,487
He's chased her,
courted her, you might say.

758
00:39:34,547 --> 00:39:37,647
Remember,
she's probably never had a relationship.

759
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:39,941
She doesn't know what it's like
to love or be loved.

760
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:42,397
My fear now,

761
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:45,777
is that she'll probably turn
to him for help.

762
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:47,649
I mean, in her mind,

763
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,071
he's been her partner in all this.

764
00:39:51,131 --> 00:39:53,009
The one man she can count on.

765
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:57,729
Jackie?

766
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,070
Where are the agents?
They're never supposed to leave the...

767
00:40:04,308 --> 00:40:05,315
Sweetheart?

768
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:06,862
What's going on?

769
00:40:07,647 --> 00:40:08,655
I'm okay.

770
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:17,330
Hello, Leon.

771
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:19,458
Where are my children?

772
00:40:20,136 --> 00:40:21,144
Gone.

773
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:23,591
I waited for them to leave.

774
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,422
This isn't about them.

775
00:40:25,982 --> 00:40:27,299
And the agents?

776
00:40:27,654 --> 00:40:28,747
Tranquilized.

777
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:31,033
They won't be happy
when they wake up, but

778
00:40:31,716 --> 00:40:33,513
considering the alternative...

779
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:35,682
You're changing, Kai.

780
00:40:37,315 --> 00:40:38,322
Not enough.

781
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:40,632
It's too late.

782
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,411
Let my wife go.

783
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:44,858
In time.

784
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:47,816
She's lucky to have you.

785
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:50,120
We know about the Doctor

786
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:51,878
and Pak Su Ji.

787
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:54,282
We know what they did to you.

788
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,037
I don't think
you can possibly imagine.

789
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:01,031
You saved one of my agents.

790
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:03,860
He didn't deserve to die.

791
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:05,503
The girl did.

792
00:41:06,322 --> 00:41:07,927
It doesn't have to end like this.

793
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:11,459
My life ended 30 years ago.

794
00:41:12,675 --> 00:41:14,471
You think it matters
what happens now?

795
00:41:18,695 --> 00:41:20,061
I'm counting on you, Leon.

796
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:23,188
You're counting on me for what?

797
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,763
To do what you did before.

798
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:28,870
Everyone said I missed.

799
00:41:31,236 --> 00:41:32,414
You should be dead.

800
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:35,264
I was already dead.

801
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:39,322
Stop this. Please.

802
00:41:41,028 --> 00:41:41,832
I can't.

803
00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:44,527
I can help you.

804
00:41:46,647 --> 00:41:48,610
Just being there all these years,

805
00:41:49,788 --> 00:41:51,049
you already have.

806
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:53,352
You have to finish it, Leon.

807
00:41:54,747 --> 00:41:55,823
Do it for me.

808
00:41:56,775 --> 00:41:58,021
For your partner.

809
00:42:21,378 --> 00:42:23,802
<i>Anyone can achieve
their fullest potential.</i>

810
00:42:25,204 --> 00:42:27,201
<i>Who we are might be predetermined,</i>

811
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:31,089
<i>but the path we follow
is always of our own choosing.</i>

812
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:33,808
<i>We should never allow our fears</i>

813
00:42:33,868 --> 00:42:35,661
<i>or the expectations of others</i>

814
00:42:36,156 --> 00:42:38,426
<i>to set the frontiers of our destiny.</i>

815
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:47,308
<i>Your destiny can't be changed,</i>

816
00:42:47,368 --> 00:42:48,998
<i>but it can be challenged.</i>

817
00:42:50,231 --> 00:42:52,228
<i>Every man is born as many men,</i>

818
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:55,079
<i>and dies as a single one.</i>
