2
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:05,317
Oh, come on, man.

3
00:00:06,163 --> 00:00:07,163
Get out!

4
00:00:07,502 --> 00:00:09,512
Let's go, buddy.
Time to go, buddy. Come on.

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,686
- That's no way to treat a Marine.
- Ease up, Sergeant.

6
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:14,877
- Let's go home.
- Where is my...?

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,301
Hey.
I left my credit card in the bar.

8
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:19,071
- Come on.
- Hey!

9
00:00:19,846 --> 00:00:21,510
Sarge.
Get it tomorrow.

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,361
There is no tomorrow, LaCombe.

11
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:26,583
- I'm going around front.
- Know what?

12
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:28,657
I think the sergeant
is a little drunk.

13
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:32,186
But you're fine, right, Sailor?

14
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:47,447
Attention, Corporal Taylor.

15
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:50,276
Kevin?

16
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:54,514
Kevin?

17
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:03,356
Ethan!

18
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:06,904
Ethan.

19
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:08,701
Hang on, man.
Hang on.

20
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:10,761
Help!

21
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:12,773
Help!

22
00:01:13,196 --> 00:01:16,514
NCIS Season 6 Episode 04
Heartland Version LOL 1.0

23
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:19,539
Synchro: ¤AkaZab¤ & 'YaYa'

24
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:43,354
www.Team-NCIS.com

25
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:48,002
None of the bar staff heard anything.

26
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:50,246
Apparently,
they like their music real loud.

27
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,526
Discourages talking.

28
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:54,002
Encourages drinking and
other mouth-related activities.

29
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:57,286
The camera's been disabled. Looks
like the dumpster's been moved, too.

30
00:01:57,624 --> 00:01:59,763
Yeah. Hiding place.
Already thought about it.

31
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:07,711
Mozart and Mayhem.

32
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:09,923
A little early for formal attire?

33
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:10,871
Really?

34
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,966
I'd say late.
Looks like Ducky got lucky.

35
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:15,024
You've never heard
of a night at the opera?

36
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:15,804
Sure.

37
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:17,626
Groucho as Otis P. Driftwood.

38
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:19,536
Marx Brothers at their most hilarious.

39
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:21,525
Love the part where
they rip up the contract.

40
00:02:21,585 --> 00:02:24,088
"That's no good-a for you.
It's no good-a for me."

41
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,249
Single blunt-force trauma
to the sternum.

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,153
At least one broken rib.

43
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:36,046
Ziva, I'm gonna need you
to bag some wood chips for me.

44
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,994
It could be a baseball bat.
Major league ass-kicking.

45
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:42,535
EMTs declared Taylor dead
at the scene a little after 3:00 A.M.

46
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:43,832
How's the other fella?

47
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:47,064
Corporal Ethan LaCombe,
rushed to the hospital.

48
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,143
Multiple fractures, internal bleeding.

49
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:51,322
They're prepping him
for brain surgery right now.

50
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:53,182
How ironic.

51
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:55,986
LaCombe manages to survive
a vicious attack,

52
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:58,451
while you have the bad luck to die

53
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,897
from what appears to be a single blow.

54
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:04,416
- Three of you were together?
- I ran inside to get my card.

55
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,020
I left them.

56
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:08,262
There's no way you could've known,
Sergeant.

57
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:09,419
I should have.

58
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:12,334
I'm supposed to know
everything about them.

59
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:13,880
What about Corporal LaCombe?

60
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:16,664
Ethan.
Funny as all hell.

61
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:19,443
Throws a baseball that'll sting
your hand for a week.

62
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,227
But other than that,
Ethan's a mystery.

63
00:03:22,548 --> 00:03:24,623
- Hometown?
- Never wanted to talk about it.

64
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:26,750
Wears a class ring on his right hand.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,920
His eyes would glaze over, and
he'd just start twisting that thing.

66
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:32,932
Sand would get under it,

67
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,687
rub his finger raw.
He never took that thing off.

68
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:37,651
I didn't press him, you know?

69
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:39,444
But he's hiding something back there.

70
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:43,770
Why don't you go get yourself
to a hospital, Marine.

71
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,031
Yes, sir.

72
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:49,687
Camera on the alleyway, boss.

73
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:53,280
Been KO'd. Time stamp puts it about
a half hour before the fight.

74
00:03:56,498 --> 00:03:59,819
This wasn't a bar brawl, McGee.
This was an ambush.

75
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:09,470
That was pristine.

76
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:11,606
Would you like us
to put them on the floor?

77
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,474
No, no. That's what it's for,
swabbing the deck,

78
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:17,118
clearing the runway,
ready for takeoff.

79
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:18,695
Garbage in, garbage out.

80
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,152
Tidy on the outside
makes tidy on the inside.

81
00:04:21,448 --> 00:04:22,874
Feng shui and the gray matter.

82
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:25,775
And now, to make sense of the chaos.

83
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,063
Cigarette butts, food wrapper...
What is that, cheese?

84
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:32,300
Recovered from the alleyway
where the attack took place.

85
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:34,675
Other one's personal effects.
What the corporals had on them.

86
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:37,110
Might want to start with LaCombe.
Least he's still alive.

87
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:40,202
- There's blood on his ring, it's bent.
- It's from impact.

88
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:41,774
Got a few punches in.

89
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,289
Might give us DNA.

90
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:46,830
Might give us more than that.

91
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:49,687
Stillwater High School.

92
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:54,003
- That supposed to mean something to us?
- Stillwater...

93
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:55,359
High School.

94
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,424
In all that time that you two
spend staring at computer screens,

95
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:01,015
you never once peeked in the man's file?
Come on!

96
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:02,988
Whose file?

97
00:05:03,064 --> 00:05:06,113
Stillwater is a small town
in Pennsylvania coal country.

98
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,683
Primarily known for the mine,

99
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:11,805
but only slightly less well known
as the birthplace

100
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:14,355
of one Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

101
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:19,587
This guy is from Gibbs' hometown.

102
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:26,663
Corporal LaCombe's medical report.

103
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:30,571
Surgeon performed a craniotomy on his
frontal lobe to relieve the pressure.

104
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:33,615
- He'll survive?
- Well, they're cautiously optimistic.

105
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:36,031
Right now,
he's in a drug-induced coma

106
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:38,318
until the swelling subsides.

107
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,189
This is more than you
can say for his friend here.

108
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,535
Corporal Taylor.

109
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:45,208
- Cause of death?
- It's a bit of an oddity.

110
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,738
Single blunt-force trauma,
but he had a prior injury,

111
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,338
a fractured vertebrosternal rib.

112
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:53,750
It was re-fractured by the blow.

113
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,358
The point of the rib
went through his pericardium

114
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,540
and penetrated his left ventricle,
causing him to bleed to death.

115
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,512
- A result of the beating.
- Yes.

116
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,850
But his wasn't nearly as
severe as that taken by LaCombe.

117
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:09,202
In addition to his skull fracture,
LaCombe had

118
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:12,366
thoracic spine fractures
from multiple blunt-force traumas,

119
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:14,563
left-side pneumothorax that's

120
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:16,806
collapsed lung.
And a ruptured spleen.

121
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:21,173
I mean, without encroaching on your
territory, Jethro, might I suggest...

122
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:22,996
That the dead guy was a dead end.

123
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:25,234
- LaCombe was the target.
- Yeah.

124
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,305
Any idea why?

125
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:29,087
I just started looking, Duck.

126
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:31,488
I've heard whispers that your search

127
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:34,296
might take you to Stillwater,
Pennsylvania.

128
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:36,364
It may.

129
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:38,791
Digging into a man's past,

130
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,173
no telling what it might unearth.

131
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,885
So many questions.

132
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:47,469
My mind is spinning with questions.

133
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:49,410
I mean,
have you ever thought about it?

134
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:51,995
He actually came from somewhere.
He didn't just appear, you know.

135
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:54,289
He didn't just start Gibbs.
He was a boy.

136
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,122
- And then he grew.
- I thought he was molded from clay,

137
00:06:57,338 --> 00:06:59,813
had life breathed into him
by a group of mystics.

138
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:02,756
That's funny, I thought he fell
to Earth in a capsule

139
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,700
after his home planet exploded.

140
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:08,606
No, he burst forth full-grown
from the mind of Zeus.

141
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:09,889
Nice.

142
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,725
He is the avatar of Vishnu.

143
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,477
He was sent to be
the left hand of Yahweh.

144
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:16,409
He was grown in a cabbage patch.

145
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:19,081
I'm trying to pose a serious
metaphysical question here.

146
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:21,540
You want to be clever?
I can be clever.

147
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,276
Just a matter of time, DiNozzo.

148
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,558
Tracing the moves of LaCombe
and Taylor's squad, boss.

149
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:28,325
They returned from Iraq three weeks ago,
arrived at Lejeune.

150
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:30,846
No outgoing e-mails,
no telephone calls, no visitors.

151
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:31,948
LaCombe?

152
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:35,009
Just, one aunt on the mother's side:
Janet LaCombe.

153
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:37,652
Lives in Stillwater, Pennsylvania.

154
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:41,082
So I've heard.

155
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:44,605
Abby lifted traces of anthracite off
one of the splinters we recovered.

156
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:47,433
It's like coal dust,
like you find in a coal mine.

157
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,604
- Road trip.
- DiNozzo.

158
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:54,509
- On your six, boss.
- Follow up with the Taylor family.

159
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,042
But I...

160
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:58,827
On it.

161
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:02,022
Hate you.

162
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:04,515
Take lots of pictures.

163
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:08,182
- Printed out directions, boss.
- Yeah, I know how to get there, McGee.

164
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,658
So when was the last time
you went home?

165
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:13,619
I make it a point
to go home every night.

166
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,970
Well, I mean, when was
the last time you went to Stillwater?

167
00:08:18,282 --> 00:08:19,827
I'd just joined the Corps.

168
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:23,958
Summer 76.

169
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:26,383
What was it like when you left?

170
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:29,523
Whole lot of fanfare.

171
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:32,078
Fireworks, parades...

172
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:36,908
Might have been the bicentennial.

173
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,310
Well, that didn't take long.

174
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,254
You know, if you had
a little tennis ball buzz cut

175
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:08,745
instead of that salt and pepper,
you'd remind me

176
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:12,112
of this skinny little wise-ass
I used to know.

177
00:09:13,224 --> 00:09:14,931
Why didn't you tell me you was coming?

178
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:16,657
Not sure it's worth your trouble.

179
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:19,598
Heard you was a Fed now.

180
00:09:20,588 --> 00:09:23,380
Never imagined we'd end up
on the same side, huh?

181
00:09:24,674 --> 00:09:26,767
No.
No, never.

182
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:31,421
- How've you been, Ed?
- After 30 years?

183
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:33,431
Well, let's see...

184
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,639
Remember Debbie Leonard?

185
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:37,157
Knocked her up.

186
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,761
Married, kids.

187
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:42,892
My kid had a kid, calls me Pappy.

188
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,628
You know how it goes.

189
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:48,266
Anything I can help you with?

190
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,456
Far as the police work goes.

191
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,203
I'll let you know.

192
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:54,244
You do that, Leroy.

193
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,321
Old friend?

194
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:09,989
Check with DiNozzo.

195
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,908
Find out how LaCombe's doing.

196
00:10:12,502 --> 00:10:14,680
Boss, there a reason
you didn't call ahead?

197
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,233
Of course there is.

198
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:20,515
If someone around here had a grudge
to settle with Ethan LaCombe,

199
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:22,278
why let them know we're coming?

200
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:27,419
Janet LaCombe?

201
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,422
Yes.

202
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,217
- We need to talk about your nephew.
- About Ethan?

203
00:10:32,484 --> 00:10:34,631
- He's dead.
- No, Miss LaCombe.

204
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:37,816
We didn't mean to give you that
impression. Ethan is still alive.

205
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:40,811
He was badly injured in an attack.

206
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:43,113
He's in a hospital
in Virginia currently.

207
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:45,914
Ethan's in a hospital?

208
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:47,499
Oh my Lord.

209
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:49,609
I can't believe it.

210
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,404
I thought he died four years ago.

211
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,849
Ethan's alive!

212
00:10:57,218 --> 00:10:59,159
Afraid you're not going
to have much luck.

213
00:10:59,346 --> 00:11:01,961
Occasionally, when the wind is right,
you can get a signal.

214
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:03,278
Thank you.

215
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:06,491
Is there a public phone
around here I could use?

216
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:07,898
There's one in my store.

217
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:09,426
My name's Jackson.

218
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:14,874
Well, Ziva,
it looks like you dropped something.

219
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:21,181
Kind of tells a story, doesn't it?

220
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,923
A $20 bill in your wallet
is just a piece of paper.

221
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,484
You put it on the ground and,
suddenly, it's full of wonder.

222
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:30,106
Context can change a thing.

223
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:31,391
That it can.

224
00:11:33,217 --> 00:11:35,920
For instance, I'll bet, back in...
Israel,

225
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:38,326
you were considered a pretty girl.

226
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:41,146
You step one foot in my country

227
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:44,007
and, instantly,
you're an exotic beauty.

228
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:46,640
When did we start talking about people?

229
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,392
Well, if the "I" in NCIS
is to be believed,

230
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,212
you're observant enough
to realize that all this is a pretext

231
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:56,923
for engaging a young woman
in conversation.

232
00:11:57,855 --> 00:12:01,086
We need to ask you a few more questions
before you head to the hospital.

233
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,503
I'm sorry.
I'm just...

234
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,893
Ethan.
His mom.

235
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,733
My sister.
She was a wild child.

236
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:10,430
- We knew she'd die young.
- Where was his father?

237
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:14,486
Who was his father? Not exactly easy
to narrow it down, if you get my drift.

238
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,945
Boy took after his mother regardless.

239
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:18,823
Got into all sorts of trouble.

240
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,317
- What kind of trouble?
- Got in some fights, stole a car.

241
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:23,895
Did some time for that.

242
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:25,898
Blew out of here not
too long after he got out.

243
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,205
He have any enemies?

244
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:30,418
From around here?
Don't you get it?

245
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:32,657
The whole town thought he was dead.

246
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,218
Boss, you think maybe we've taken
something of a wrong turn?

247
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,574
Everyone in town thought
he was dead already.

248
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:44,057
Maybe he wanted it that way.

249
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:53,189
Word travels fast.

250
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:54,678
That it does.

251
00:12:55,772 --> 00:12:58,881
When people actually open their mouths
and speak with one another.

252
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:02,076
You don't call.
You don't write.

253
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:06,070
Were you going to come by and say hi?

254
00:13:08,095 --> 00:13:09,095
Hi...

255
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:10,719
Jack.

256
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:12,739
Hi...

257
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:14,690
Leroy.

258
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,030
Jackson Gibbs.

259
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,702
My father.

260
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:42,782
This is a pretty nice setup
you got here, Mr. Gibbs.

261
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:43,873
Jack.

262
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,475
You got to stay up with technology,
Tim.

263
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:49,422
Otherwise,
you concede to time inch by inch.

264
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:52,003
Not that it's worth the while.

265
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:54,225
- Is this Nepal?
- Yeah.

266
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:56,538
It was my 60th birthday,

267
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:59,024
and I climbed 13,000 feet.

268
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:01,652
I thought I'd give myself
a victory cigar,

269
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:04,427
forgetting how thin the air was,
and I passed out.

270
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:07,347
Next thing I know,
a Sherpa was giving me mouth-to-mouth.

271
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:09,723
But I always make it a point

272
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,511
to return home after every adventure,

273
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:15,293
unlike some people I know.

274
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:19,392
Does he ever talk about me,
my boy?

275
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:21,551
I think I heard him
refer to you once as dead.

276
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:26,447
You probably misheard him,
McGee.

277
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:30,229
Think she's right.
I think he probably said "Dad".

278
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,403
Well...

279
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,238
Hey, what... what's the story on that
picture there? That looks interesting.

280
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:39,010
It's the grand opening of the store.

281
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,744
Me and LJ opened it after
too many close calls in the mines.

282
00:14:42,963 --> 00:14:46,153
- LJ?
- LJ. Leroy Jethro.

283
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,747
Is that the...
gun you learned to shoot with?

284
00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:58,237
No one was ever allowed
to touch that Winchester.

285
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,675
Yeah,
let that be a lesson in parenting.

286
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,894
Tell a kid he can't have a rifle and
he grows up to be a sniper.

287
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:08,920
- Can I get you something to eat, Leroy?
- Can't. Case.

288
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:11,875
Well, least I can help you with that.

289
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:14,085
I had a few beers with Ethan LaCombe.

290
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,498
Gee,
I'm shocked.

291
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:20,894
Leroy could never see the benefit
of keeping a six-pack on ice.

292
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:25,439
He'd spend all his time out
in the garage working on some project.

293
00:15:25,543 --> 00:15:28,374
We didn't even have
electricity out there.

294
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:29,849
I can see it.

295
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:33,889
One day, he blew all his money on some
wreck that he picked up at a junkyard.

296
00:15:34,305 --> 00:15:37,302
He was going to rebuild it
from the spark plugs up.

297
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,058
- Never did get it running.
- And where do you keep her?

298
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,779
I can't hang on to every piece of junk.

299
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,595
No, just your junk.

300
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:49,686
- What were we talking about?
- Ethan.

301
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:53,599
Ethan, yeah, yeah.
Good kid. Little reckless.

302
00:15:54,072 --> 00:15:55,438
Most people liked him.

303
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:57,706
- Except Winslow up there.
- Chuck Winslow?

304
00:15:57,785 --> 00:15:59,142
Yeah, your old buddy.

305
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:02,235
- Owns the Winslow Mining Company?
- That's the one.

306
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,992
Ethan had a kind of a thing
for his daughter Emily.

307
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:08,700
She married Nick Kingston.

308
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,310
That was before Ethan
took off for greener pastures.

309
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,628
Now, where are you going?

310
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:15,309
You're not going to walk up there
and start accusing people, are you?

311
00:16:15,402 --> 00:16:16,742
I thought I'd drive.

312
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:23,516
Now, don't go doing anything stupid.

313
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,698
If you're dead set on going
another round with Chuck Winslow,

314
00:16:58,211 --> 00:16:59,794
this is the least you can do.

315
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:03,221
You'd be amazed what you
can get done with a kind word.

316
00:17:04,572 --> 00:17:05,602
I'll show you.

317
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:12,156
Boss, we'll... wait here.

318
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:26,168
- I'll call Tony.
- I'll call Abby.

319
00:17:30,252 --> 00:17:31,439
What do you got, Abs?

320
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:34,398
I found three distinct blood samples
on LaCombe's ring.

321
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:38,283
One sample belongs to LaCombe,
but he definitely got some punches in.

322
00:17:38,502 --> 00:17:41,552
If we're really lucky,
our bad guys have some marks on them.

323
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:44,685
- You heard anything?
- From Hazzard County? No, not yet.

324
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:48,684
Look, Bo.
There's our good ol'boy.

325
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:50,036
<i>- I got 'em.</i>
- Hey, Luke.

326
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,446
How's Uncle Jesse?

327
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,033
- Gibbs has a father.
<i>- Tell me everything.</i>

328
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:57,004
His name is Jackson. He's a good talker.
He may have winked at me.

329
00:17:57,116 --> 00:17:58,939
<i>Gibbs is very different around him.</i>

330
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:01,793
- Different how? Bad? Different good?
- He's like a teenager, sort of.

331
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:03,638
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm going. I'm leaving.

332
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:05,396
<i>- Me, too.</i>
- No, you can't,

333
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:07,629
not unless you found a way
the people in town might have

334
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:09,546
thought Ethan LaCombe was alive.

335
00:18:10,394 --> 00:18:12,677
<i>- They thought he was dead?
- Wait, I have that.</i>

336
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:14,268
I wrote that down.

337
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,888
<i>Hang on, I found it.</i>

338
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:18,558
<i>Here.</i>
See, look, that's a video link.

339
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:21,035
<i>Type that in and,</i>
and...

340
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:23,001
<i>Yeah, there.
There it is.</i>

341
00:18:23,162 --> 00:18:25,039
- You see him?
<i>- This is from Iraq?</i>

342
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:26,288
<i>Yeah, that's him.</i>

343
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:28,133
<i>LaCombe was tagged
in the video's content.</i>

344
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:29,816
<i>Just posted before his squad came home.</i>

345
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,643
I'm impressed with your Internet savvy.

346
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,769
- How'd you find that?
<i>- I used Google.</i>

347
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:36,414
Not so impressive, Gibbs
probably could have done that.

348
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:38,154
- What?
- Where is Gibbs?

349
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,771
Haven't you forgotten something?

350
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:52,934
- How you doing, Nick?
- Hey, Jack.

351
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:56,364
This is my son Leroy,
an old friend of your father-in-law's.

352
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:57,870
No, come on in, Leroy.

353
00:18:58,108 --> 00:18:59,640
Did I hear someone say Leroy?

354
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:02,044
Stop the presses.

355
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,519
Got a new headline.

356
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,572
<i>Local boy makes good.</i>

357
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:09,104
- Not as good as you, Chuck.
- That's kind of you to say.

358
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:10,895
Just hard work and sweat...

359
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:12,382
mostly other peoples'.

360
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:15,290
Sit. Let's crack this bottle.

361
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:20,023
- Emily, let me help you with that.
- That's woman's work, Jack.

362
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:21,785
Take a load off.

363
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:24,118
Bring us some glasses,
would you, sweetheart?

364
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:25,122
Sure, Daddy.

365
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:30,801
<i>Home is the sailor,
home from the sea.</i>

366
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:32,426
So the poem goes.

367
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:35,159
No offense. I know you're
a Marine through to the bone.

368
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:38,227
- What brings you back?
- Another Marine.

369
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:39,437
Ethan LaCombe.

370
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,578
Must be a night for raising the dead.

371
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,994
Haven't heard that boy's name in years.

372
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,371
He's not dead.

373
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,620
Really?

374
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,684
Well, rumor was,
he drowned in, in Alaska.

375
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:58,419
- What was it, hon?
- Fishing.

376
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:00,718
He had that

377
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:03,637
mean streak in him.
What do you call it?

378
00:20:03,747 --> 00:20:05,731
Thrill-seeker, death wish?

379
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:10,278
Just shows to go you can't
always get what you want.

380
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:15,794
Leroy is just doing some background
research, all very standard.

381
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:19,561
NCIS insists you,
you beat all the bushes.

382
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,275
Particularly with murder.

383
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,487
Murder?

384
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,052
- You said the boy was alive.
- Yeah, he is.

385
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:27,776
His friend isn't.
We're still looking for a motive.

386
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:33,027
Well, we, we haven't seen
Ethan since he lit out of here...

387
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:35,360
What was it then? Six years ago?

388
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:38,792
You know, he tried to run off
with my girl.

389
00:20:39,814 --> 00:20:41,794
But she came to her senses.

390
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,206
No, Ethan was the wrong
boy for my daughter.

391
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:48,913
She chose the right man.

392
00:20:51,261 --> 00:20:53,294
So what kind of clues you following,
Sherlock?

393
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:54,577
Blood.

394
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:57,711
Attackers left traces on his ring.

395
00:20:57,796 --> 00:20:58,796
His ring?

396
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:00,430
Yeah.

397
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,622
Class ring.

398
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:03,667
Just like that.

399
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:07,486
That's odd.
Ethan never graduated high school.

400
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,274
This isn't exactly the kind

401
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,011
of after-dinner conversation
I expected, Chuck.

402
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:16,908
I'm interested.
Tell me about the blood.

403
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:18,972
Well, it can be used
to convict a suspect.

404
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:21,149
Or rule somebody out, of course.

405
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:25,364
And you got a reason to believe
there's a suspect around here?

406
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:26,655
Not yet.

407
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,926
Daddy, Daddy.

408
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:32,524
Hey, there, buddy.
This is my son Chris.

409
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,386
Chris, you're getting awful big.

410
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:37,074
- How old are you now?
- He's, he's five.

411
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:40,505
- Five and three-quarters.
- That's right, big guy.

412
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:48,525
- Thanks for the drink.
- Come here, sweetie.

413
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:51,601
Chuck.

414
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:58,928
Everybody's always
lying to you all the time.

415
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:01,587
Can't you ever take
things as you see 'em?

416
00:22:01,664 --> 00:22:03,573
I see people lying to me.

417
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:06,116
You were such a happy child.

418
00:22:06,502 --> 00:22:08,663
- Boss, I talked to Tony and Abby.
- Boss?

419
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:10,994
You make them call you that?

420
00:22:11,736 --> 00:22:12,984
He's not a...

421
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:15,549
Are you a boss, Leroy?

422
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:19,824
Blood traces from LaCombe's ring
will help us ID two of his attackers.

423
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,508
As far as how they found him,

424
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:24,768
LaCombe's squad in Iraq
made a video and put it on the Net.

425
00:22:25,563 --> 00:22:29,325
It was posted a month ago, and
already has almost half million hits.

426
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:32,748
It's a lot of data to sift through,
but I can tell who's seen it.

427
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:34,203
You can do that?

428
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:36,808
You can tell everything
I've been looking at?

429
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:38,898
What have you been looking at?

430
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:40,610
None of your business.

431
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,160
See, using, service-provider accounts,
I can cross-reference the static IPs...

432
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,076
I'm tired.

433
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:49,862
I can conclusively say

434
00:22:49,955 --> 00:22:52,569
that this video has been viewed
from the Winslows' home account.

435
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:55,562
Someone in that house knew
Ethan LaCombe was still alive.

436
00:22:55,622 --> 00:22:57,237
You see anybody could have found that.

437
00:22:57,297 --> 00:22:59,252
I mean, anybody could have
known how to find him.

438
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:00,837
It could have been anyone.

439
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:03,092
But they lied to me about it.

440
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:35,490
Yeah.
It's good coffee.

441
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,077
Yeah, I know.

442
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:45,115
Morning, Gibbs.

443
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:47,359
Gibbses.

444
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:52,644
Corporal LaCombe briefly
regained consciousness, but,

445
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:55,500
he has no memory of the attack.

446
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:59,781
Tony's trying to secure a court order
for the Winslow family.

447
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:02,777
To take blood samples,
financial records.

448
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,922
- Who is this Tony?
- He will be driving up this afternoon.

449
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:10,038
So, how's it go? You line up people you
don't like and make 'em give you blood?

450
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,443
- It's not personal.
- Sure, it is.

451
00:24:12,753 --> 00:24:15,942
One of those guys put that kid
in the hospital, killed his friend.

452
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:18,599
- Yeah, and you know this how?
- I can feel it.

453
00:24:18,987 --> 00:24:21,796
Feelings.
That sounds very personal to me.

454
00:24:21,856 --> 00:24:23,856
I do this for a living.

455
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:25,046
Some living.

456
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:27,591
Just to let you feel
superior to everybody else.

457
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:29,303
What do you want me to do?

458
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:32,263
Why do you say you think
they're responsible?

459
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,614
How about getting
some more evidence first?

460
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,871
How about that?

461
00:24:36,194 --> 00:24:37,659
How about DNA?

462
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,908
I thought everything was DNA now.

463
00:24:50,426 --> 00:24:52,755
It's a shame.
I was really starting to like him.

464
00:24:52,815 --> 00:24:53,815
Me, too.

465
00:24:54,054 --> 00:24:57,103
And Gibbs sure is bending
over backwards to accommodate him.

466
00:24:57,185 --> 00:24:58,908
He needs to be himself.

467
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:04,631
- Can I help you folks?
- Sure you want to make that offer?

468
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,048
- Depends on what you're looking for.
- Anything that may carry traces of DNA.

469
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:11,200
This dumpster
is on a public access road,

470
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:13,260
- so we are able...
- And willing.

471
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:14,593
To go through it.

472
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:17,511
Looking for treasures like...

473
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:18,836
this.

474
00:25:20,016 --> 00:25:21,530
Does that bother you?

475
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:24,273
Yeah, it's a...
It's a little off-putting.

476
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,926
Here.
Let me help.

477
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:38,994
I appreciate you making an effort
not to tear the town apart.

478
00:25:40,392 --> 00:25:42,792
You give people a chance,
they might surprise you.

479
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:45,051
That's what worries me.

480
00:25:45,426 --> 00:25:48,199
Tell me about
this investigator thing of yours.

481
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:50,009
We haven't talked since you started it.

482
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:51,615
It's $1,75.

483
00:25:52,198 --> 00:25:55,650
In fact, we haven't talked
since the funeral.

484
00:25:57,011 --> 00:25:58,791
I adored that wife of yours.

485
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:03,534
And I adored that child, too.

486
00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:09,097
Always figured it was Shannon
that sent me the Christmas cards.

487
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,817
Well, it's like what you do.

488
00:26:15,397 --> 00:26:16,862
What, selling groceries?

489
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:18,245
No.

490
00:26:19,843 --> 00:26:21,431
You like to tell a story.

491
00:26:22,924 --> 00:26:24,983
Well, I've been known
to spin a yarn or two.

492
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:27,213
Yeah, most of mine
start with a dead body.

493
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,929
You look into how they got that way,
they come back to life.

494
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,110
Two and a quarter.

495
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:36,663
Meet the people they knew.
You see what they try to show you.

496
00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:39,153
You read what they try to hide.

497
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:42,771
People come in here all the time.

498
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:45,577
Tell me their life stories
at the drop of a hat.

499
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:48,157
- What are they trying to hide?
- Insecurity.

500
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:53,477
Need assurance their life
means something.

501
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:56,107
Leroy...

502
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:00,218
what did I do
at the funeral?

503
00:27:00,472 --> 00:27:02,596
You mean,
other than showing up with a date?

504
00:27:07,815 --> 00:27:11,459
I always thought that your mom
and I had a love story for the ages.

505
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,827
I never regretted giving up the skies,

506
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:16,560
working underground
every day in the mines.

507
00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:19,805
I wanted to give you that white,
picket-fence dream.

508
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:20,949
And you did.

509
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
But you see...

510
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:28,508
... things did not work out
between your mom and me.

511
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:32,787
When she died,
I know how mad that made you.

512
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:37,734
I know how you hated me
for getting on with my life.

513
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:39,995
I saw the look in your face.

514
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,277
How you wanted vengeance.

515
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,688
And that look went away
when you met Shannon,

516
00:27:47,827 --> 00:27:50,104
but it came back quick after they died.

517
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:54,219
I knew what that meant.

518
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:57,736
You were gonna find
someone to take it out on.

519
00:27:59,773 --> 00:28:01,260
Didn't matter what I said.

520
00:28:03,605 --> 00:28:04,635
It never did.

521
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,120
What do you see now?

522
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:15,258
Chuck. Ed.

523
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:18,743
I've got some complaints to register
on behalf of my employees.

524
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,836
You've been sifting through their trash.

525
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,965
I told you to come to me
if you needed anything.

526
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:26,746
You did. I will.

527
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:29,328
Be civilized, Leroy.

528
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:33,032
You ask me,
I think this is about a grudge.

529
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:36,057
I got Ethan LaCombe's
juvenile record unsealed.

530
00:28:36,212 --> 00:28:38,351
That car he stole belonged to you.

531
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:42,443
The arrest report
was written by Ed here.

532
00:28:43,395 --> 00:28:44,919
You made sure he did time.

533
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:48,030
We are law-abiding citizens.

534
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:50,844
I can't tolerate
that kind of behavior.

535
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:52,608
You just couldn't get rid of him.

536
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:56,079
You want to settle the score?
Why don't we handle it like men?

537
00:28:57,784 --> 00:28:59,764
I know how you two handle things.

538
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:05,835
Get off him!

539
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:08,471
Get off of me!

540
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,502
Hold him, Ed.

541
00:29:14,234 --> 00:29:15,422
That's enough!

542
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:18,966
Next time, when your daddy's not around,
I'm gonna kill you.

543
00:29:19,064 --> 00:29:21,816
Next time, when your buddy's not around,
Chuck, I'm gonna kill you.

544
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:28,257
Sure you want to pick this fight?

545
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:30,073
Wasn't my choice.

546
00:29:53,587 --> 00:29:56,397
- You feel that?
- What? Week-old bananas?

547
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:59,067
No. We are being watched.

548
00:30:06,954 --> 00:30:08,320
How do you do that?

549
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:10,368
Hi.
You must be Emily.

550
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,627
You're with Agent Gibbs.

551
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:15,435
Here about...
Ethan.

552
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:16,604
You know him?

553
00:30:16,664 --> 00:30:17,692
We were very...

554
00:30:18,308 --> 00:30:19,308
close...

555
00:30:20,063 --> 00:30:21,191
before he left.

556
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:23,928
Those feelings
do not go away overnight.

557
00:30:24,638 --> 00:30:25,826
No. They don't.

558
00:30:27,947 --> 00:30:31,078
- I found him on the Internet.
- The video of his squad?

559
00:30:31,724 --> 00:30:34,392
- You never believed he was dead?
- I didn't want to.

560
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,841
But I was starting to...

561
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,967
I just wanted to talk to him again.
I made some calls.

562
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:47,514
- He was my best friend.
- Is that all?

563
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:49,282
Yes.

564
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:53,088
Emily, who knew?

565
00:31:01,253 --> 00:31:03,209
You want to get off my property?

566
00:31:06,003 --> 00:31:08,291
- Are we finished here, McGee?
- Finished.

567
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,490
Okay.

568
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:14,947
Well, boss,
we got a load of garbage in the car.

569
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:17,780
I'm sure Abby will have
a field day sifting through it for...

570
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:19,258
DNA.

571
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:24,401
And we found out who saw the video.
It was Emily.

572
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:26,288
There a reason you're not on the road?

573
00:31:26,348 --> 00:31:29,349
Listen, boss, I understand that
you're treating this case differently.

574
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,476
Some might say with kid gloves.

575
00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:34,129
But not me.
I wouldn't say that.

576
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,065
Boss, you're gonna start busting
in doors at some point, right?

577
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,744
Dragging people out in handcuffs.
Tossing 'em in a room,

578
00:31:39,804 --> 00:31:42,252
lean one 'em till they break.
Personally, I think it works for you.

579
00:31:42,312 --> 00:31:44,520
Yesterday you thought
I'd made a wrong turn.

580
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:47,516
- Well, that was yesterday.
- Today I'm not moving fast enough.

581
00:31:47,676 --> 00:31:48,744
I didn't mean to...

582
00:31:48,804 --> 00:31:51,318
Want to front load complaints
for tomorrow, McGee, or

583
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:53,258
do I have to wait until
the sun comes up?

584
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:55,458
What was that?

585
00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:03,037
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah, fine.

586
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:06,028
- All of our evidence was in there.
- What now?

587
00:32:07,615 --> 00:32:10,348
All right,
let's do it your way.

588
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,849
Oh, God.

589
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,031
Hi, guys.

590
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:30,559
Pass a lot of Volkswagen
Beetles on your way up?

591
00:32:31,014 --> 00:32:33,323
- Abby cheats at punch-buggy.
- I know.

592
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,473
- What does it look like?
- Like someone

593
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:37,820
stuffed a rag in a gas tank
and lit the fuse.

594
00:32:37,953 --> 00:32:39,378
And toasted our DNA.

595
00:32:40,196 --> 00:32:42,235
- Where's Gibbs?
- Waiting for you inside.

596
00:32:42,563 --> 00:32:44,506
- I'll get my gear.
- What about Senior?

597
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,168
All right.

598
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:56,671
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm...

599
00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:58,230
DiNozzo, court order.

600
00:32:58,358 --> 00:33:01,169
Winslow Residence,
Winslow Mine, including employees.

601
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,332
Nick Kingston.

602
00:33:02,882 --> 00:33:04,090
Emily Kingston.

603
00:33:04,355 --> 00:33:05,442
Chris Kingston.

604
00:33:05,502 --> 00:33:07,320
You got a court order
for a five-year-old?

605
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,608
Five-and-three-quarter. Have Abby
set up here. We'll bring her evidence.

606
00:33:16,576 --> 00:33:18,790
Take Ziva and McGee to the mine.
I got the residence.

607
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:21,208
We got a problem.
Only one car.

608
00:33:21,674 --> 00:33:22,710
I got a car.

609
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:33,013
426 Hemi.

610
00:33:33,685 --> 00:33:36,450
R/T suspension package,
just the way you wanted it.

611
00:33:37,913 --> 00:33:39,391
Right down to the color.

612
00:33:45,353 --> 00:33:47,591
Are we gonna stand here staring,

613
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:49,892
or are we gonna get going?

614
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:53,093
That's right, I said "we".

615
00:34:19,595 --> 00:34:21,734
Well, hey, there.
You Nick Kingston?

616
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:24,705
Now what are you looking for?

617
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:27,176
I got a court order
here to take your blood.

618
00:34:27,514 --> 00:34:28,781
Your employees, too.

619
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,296
You're gonna make us?

620
00:34:30,578 --> 00:34:33,351
Well, yeah, Nick, that's what
the little piece of paper's for.

621
00:34:40,316 --> 00:34:42,198
I hope I'm not interrupting dinner.

622
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:44,873
Now, that's the man I remember.

623
00:34:45,154 --> 00:34:48,303
Just bust in before
you know what's going on.

624
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,760
- I know.
- What do you know?

625
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:55,128
Daddy?

626
00:34:56,038 --> 00:34:57,038
You okay?

627
00:34:57,919 --> 00:35:00,315
It's nothing, sweetheart.
Go back upstairs.

628
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:08,864
Well, you really didn't want
Ethan around your daughter.

629
00:35:10,473 --> 00:35:12,454
You give him the same threat
you gave me?

630
00:35:13,537 --> 00:35:16,310
Well, the boy was smart
enough to stay gone.

631
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:17,896
Not forever.

632
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,454
- Emily found him.
- So I went after him?

633
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:22,973
No, no, no,
that's not the way you work.

634
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,375
You'd get somebody else to do it.

635
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:36,384
- Hello, Ed.
- Jack.

636
00:35:37,191 --> 00:35:39,139
Got a report of a disturbance up here.

637
00:35:40,095 --> 00:35:42,686
- A lot of that going on tonight.
- Too much.

638
00:35:44,628 --> 00:35:46,430
Why don't we sit this one out?

639
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,206
Come back for blood.

640
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,364
That's got some poetry to it, Leroy.

641
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,690
Yeah.
What's it gonna tell me, Chuck?

642
00:36:07,205 --> 00:36:08,873
Well, I'm glad that went smooth.

643
00:36:09,105 --> 00:36:11,693
Can't even remember where
I keep the shells for this thing.

644
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,840
Boss, according to the time cards
from the Winslow offices,

645
00:36:15,197 --> 00:36:17,455
these two were working
in the mines on Friday.

646
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:19,508
Notice the signatures?

647
00:36:20,196 --> 00:36:22,453
- But according to their blood...
- What do you got, Abs?

648
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,176
- I'm just double-checking my results.
- It's a wonder.

649
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:28,752
Well, it's more accurate to match
DNA from a blood sample at a

650
00:36:28,843 --> 00:36:30,546
crime scene to a source than it is to

651
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:34,496
create an entire profile, but in
a pinch. I narrowed it down by type.

652
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:38,862
Then I centrifuged the samples
to separate serum for electrophoresis.

653
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:41,196
It's not that complicated, Jack.

654
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,676
Well, I mean, it's a wonder
that Leroy gets any work

655
00:36:43,764 --> 00:36:45,646
done surrounded by
such beautiful women.

656
00:36:47,669 --> 00:36:49,850
Are you always this awkward
around girls?

657
00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:56,715
So, these two are the samples
taken from the crime scene and the ring.

658
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:58,546
These guys attacked LaCombe and
Taylor.

659
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:01,102
Now, the other sample is LaCombe's.

660
00:37:01,472 --> 00:37:03,140
Here's where it gets interesting.

661
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,987
See these dark markers here and here?

662
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,602
- Bisalbuminemia.
- What does that mean?

663
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:11,138
Well, it's a genetically
inherited blood anomaly.

664
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,704
They also appear in this sample.

665
00:37:14,994 --> 00:37:16,630
The owner of this sample

666
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,758
is related to LaCombe.

667
00:37:19,418 --> 00:37:20,567
Father and son?

668
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:22,324
Yep.

669
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:24,741
I guess you were right
about people hiding things.

670
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:33,428
Ed's locking up
those two boys from the mine.

671
00:37:34,562 --> 00:37:35,809
For killing Taylor.

672
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:38,427
Trying to kill Ethan.

673
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:42,215
He'll live.

674
00:37:43,877 --> 00:37:45,520
I thought you'd want to know.

675
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:47,821
Since he's family.

676
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,933
- What do you mean?
- Blood relative.

677
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,220
I knew it.

678
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:55,107
- Nick...
- Chris is his son.

679
00:37:55,451 --> 00:37:57,605
- I always knew it.
- No.

680
00:37:58,105 --> 00:38:00,237
I was already pregnant
when he got out of prison.

681
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:05,284
It broke his heart, but he didn't want
to tear apart our family.

682
00:38:07,174 --> 00:38:08,174
You won.

683
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:11,374
- You gave him your ring.
- But I never slept with him.

684
00:38:12,985 --> 00:38:13,834
I swear.

685
00:38:14,238 --> 00:38:16,599
- I don't believe you.
- Well, you should.

686
00:38:19,362 --> 00:38:20,669
Chris is your son.

687
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:25,591
And Ethan is yours.

688
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:31,699
Dad?

689
00:38:32,882 --> 00:38:35,238
I couldn't
let the two of you...

690
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,918
brother and sister.

691
00:38:42,377 --> 00:38:43,565
Now you know.

692
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,365
Why didn't you ever say so?

693
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:48,384
It would have meant acknowledging
an heir to your fortune.

694
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,915
You sent them after Ethan?

695
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,674
I've done a lot of things
in my life, but...

696
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:56,853
Even you wouldn't try
to kill your own son.

697
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,431
You signed the time cards
for those two miners.

698
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:08,699
They weren't there,
but you knew where they really were.

699
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:11,142
Get up.

700
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:17,440
Why couldn't you ever just believe me?

701
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:37,566
- Shotgun. Called it first.
- Shotgun. Called it first.

702
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:41,359
What?

703
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,380
Jack, I just... I mean,
I don't want to be intrusive.

704
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,281
It was so nice to meet you.

705
00:39:49,009 --> 00:39:50,039
She is a hugger.

706
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,017
Fantastic.

707
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:57,594
Jack... I just... I gotta know
some things. I got a lot of questions.

708
00:39:57,657 --> 00:39:59,083
You can have two, DiNozzo.

709
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:02,987
- Where do I start?
- You got one left.

710
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:06,248
Well, that doesn't count,
'cause that...

711
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:08,727
Okay...
the rules.

712
00:40:09,226 --> 00:40:12,018
Did he learn them from you?
I mean, did you teach him all the rules?

713
00:40:12,169 --> 00:40:14,666
I'm sorry, son.
I didn't teach him much of anything.

714
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:16,274
He taught me to drive.

715
00:40:16,687 --> 00:40:19,717
No, boss, not backseat, middle hump.
I... I got that...

716
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:21,905
- that thing we talked about.
- Take them.

717
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,464
It's just cluttering up the garage.

718
00:40:32,582 --> 00:40:34,396
You're a great man, Jackson Gibbs.

719
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:36,160
Thanks for the sweater.

720
00:40:46,372 --> 00:40:50,194
I know you hate it when I use
a hundred words when a couple will do.

721
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:53,870
But give us a call sometime.

722
00:40:54,847 --> 00:40:56,293
It's the least I could do.

723
00:41:02,691 --> 00:41:03,963
Good-bye, son.

724
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:13,024
Bye, Dad.

725
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:53,838
What were you and
those guys fighting about?

726
00:41:55,428 --> 00:41:56,834
I don't even remember.

727
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,807
You should stop.

728
00:42:03,543 --> 00:42:05,275
Are you waiting for the train, too?

729
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:11,188
- We could sit together.
- I don't know. It's a long ride.

730
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,118
But I guess you're not a lumberjack.

731
00:42:15,672 --> 00:42:17,434
- No.
- Well, I have a rule.

732
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:20,029
It's either rule #1 or #3.

733
00:42:20,216 --> 00:42:21,866
Never date a lumberjack.

734
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,366
- You got a rule for everything?
- Working on it.

735
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:28,933
Everyone needs a code
they can live by.

736
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:31,647
What's your name?

737
00:42:33,514 --> 00:42:35,435
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

738
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,873
I'm just gonna call you Gibbs.

739
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:42,603
You can call me anything you want.

740
00:42:45,448 --> 00:42:46,478
I'm Shannon.
