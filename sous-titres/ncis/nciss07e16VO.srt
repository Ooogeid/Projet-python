2
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:13,284
Can we stop walking now?

3
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:16,184
Hush.
If you stop moving, he'll wake up.

4
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:19,227
It's almost 2:00 a.m.
He's gonna be hungry again in an hour.

5
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:22,114
I read about a kid that couldn't sleep
unless he was in a moving car.

6
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:25,259
His parents drove
3,000 miles in a month.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,693
Sit for five minutes.

8
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:29,062
I'll take over.

9
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:30,807
Give me ten.

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,240
Greedy.

11
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:37,589
Stay here. Stay here.

12
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:42,017
It's gonna be okay.

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,294
Help, somebody help!

14
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:47,180
Oh, my... God!

15
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,965
Neil, come back!

16
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:54,429
NCIS Season 7 Episode 16

www.Team-NCIS.com

20
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,401
Let me guess: a date.

21
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:34,009
Let's just say that something
very special is happening to...

22
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,928
very Special Agent
Anthony DiNozzo today.

23
00:01:36,518 --> 00:01:37,635
Who are you seeing?

24
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,307
Kurosawa.

25
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:40,560
Really?

26
00:01:40,644 --> 00:01:42,310
Did not know
you were into Asian women.

27
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:43,603
Kurosawa is a dude.

28
00:01:43,877 --> 00:01:46,522
I certainly did not know
you were into Asian dudes.

29
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,984
Akira Kurosawa,

30
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:51,778
who, as I'm sure you are aware, is one
of the greatest filmmakers of all time.

31
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,655
He's having a little festival
of his films at the Odeon.

32
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,897
<i>Seven Samurai
and The Hidden Fortress.</i>

33
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:57,909
Man movies.

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,535
They're great works of art.

35
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:01,889
This is a great work of art.

36
00:02:01,973 --> 00:02:04,411
Oh, yeah? What do you got there?
New <i>Judy Blume</i>?

37
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:06,697
I always liked  <i>Are You There, God?
It's Me, Margaret.</i>

38
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:09,712
This, my friend,
is the Declaration of Independence.

39
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,934
My citizenship test is coming up,
and I wish to pass with swimming colors.

40
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,133
Flying colors.

41
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:15,682
Any colors will do, McGee.

42
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,012
Timmy. You look a little rough
around the edges there.

43
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,847
You up all night playing
video games?

44
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,704
I will admit that maintaining my...

45
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:24,021
state-of-the-art status
is exhausting.

46
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:26,112
But you are looking at a man

47
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,139
who has his whole apartment wired
to a single remote control.

48
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,942
- Everything?
- Even the microwave.

49
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,196
It's like <i>the Clapper</i>.
Remember that?

50
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:36,697
Clap on, clap off.

51
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,865
I am living the dream, baby.

52
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:40,577
Nah, no clapping yet.

53
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:42,537
Norfolk. Dead Navy officer.

54
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,957
Boss, do you mind
if I grab some coffee real quick?

55
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,463
Yeah, I do. We got no time.

56
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,385
Here, suck on this.
Better nothing.

57
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,559
It does taste like coffee.

58
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:57,609
- Wait, did he just tell me to...
- Suck it up, McGee.

59
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:03,307
Look at this.

60
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,005
Cavalry's arrived.

61
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:09,521
Who knew homicide in Norfolk meant
working with you guys all the time.

62
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:12,650
- Navy town, Navy crimes.
- Could be worse, right?

63
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,754
Morning, Agent David.

64
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,985
Good morning, Detective.

65
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:19,490
Ziva, why don't you get statements.
McGee, physical evidence.

66
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,614
I'm gonna take
some photographs, so...

67
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:23,091
Sorry, Boss.

68
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:25,966
If there's anything you need, Sir,
I'm right here.

69
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:28,409
- Witnesses?
- Three, so far.

70
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:31,526
Couple walking their baby heard it,
but didn't see the assailant.

71
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,583
That's the vic's fiancée over there.

72
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,553
Been there all night,
saw it up close.

73
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:37,578
Not hurt, but rattled pretty bad.

74
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,156
Put that insidious device away,
Mr. Palmer.

75
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,766
This is a crime scene,
not a chat room.

76
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:48,619
Sorry, Doctor.
It's just, it's just,

77
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:50,403
she texted me "yes".

78
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:53,025
What?!
Oh, splendid!

79
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:53,900
Splendid.

80
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:58,112
Palmer's embalmer said yeah, huh?

81
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:00,390
The little funeral home girl?

82
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:04,109
Girls who work down there
in the mortuaries, they like...

83
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:06,203
to do it in the dark.
So what you want to do is...

84
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,331
- Focus, DiNozzo.
- Sorry, Boss. Focusing.

85
00:04:08,526 --> 00:04:11,791
It's Navy Captain Joseph Norton.
Lived here in Norfolk.

86
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,877
There's a lot of cash in his wallet.

87
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,802
Looks like
that ring box is empty there.

88
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,884
Maybe, left the money, took the ring,
unless the lady's wearing it.

89
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,511
I don't see a ring anywhere.

90
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:26,069
Multiple wounds to the torso.

91
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:27,475
Significant loss of blood.

92
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,101
As to the time of death...

93
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:31,383
No need. We got witnesses.

94
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,232
Usually our investigations don't come
with such a value-added bonus.

95
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:40,571
Let us prepare
the Captain for his final voyage.

96
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:42,322
Mind if I talk to your witness?

97
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,286
She's yours now.
Just keep me in the loop.

98
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,831
So you saw the attacker's face?

99
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,193
No, not really.
It was so dark.

100
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:55,367
It was very fast.

101
00:04:56,655 --> 00:04:59,298
I'd like you to meet,
Special Agent Gibbs.

102
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,313
Hey, Joann.

103
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:16,940
This is a surprise.

104
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:19,318
You two know each other?

105
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,990
Joann Fielding, my mother-in-law.

106
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:25,992
Ex-mother-in-law.

107
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:28,590
Shannon's mom.

108
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:30,568
Kelly's grandmother.

109
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:35,920
So when was the last time
you two saw each other?

110
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,497
The girls' funeral.

111
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:50,141
McNosy, what do you got?

112
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:54,145
Well, from what I can gather, Gibbs
and Joann Fielding are very estranged.

113
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:56,771
The woman lost her daughter
and her granddaughter.

114
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:58,802
Now her fiancé died in her arms

115
00:05:58,886 --> 00:06:01,736
and her former son-in-law
is investigating. Show some sympathy.

116
00:06:02,456 --> 00:06:04,405
Maybe she's cursed, like a Kennedy.

117
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,699
- Minus the Grassy Knoll.
- I heard about that.

118
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:08,826
The shooter was really
in the book suppository.

119
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,145
Depository.

120
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:13,581
- That is what I said.
- I'm listening.

121
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:18,655
We just checked
the cameras covering the waterfront.

122
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:20,046
Nothing caught the suspect.

123
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:23,798
Which means he knew where the cameras
were positioned and how to avoid them.

124
00:06:23,946 --> 00:06:26,682
- Which means?
- He's familiar with the promenade,

125
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:28,758
so we should start questioning
the employees,

126
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:32,059
the marina shopkeepers and,
you know, the residents.

127
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:34,950
- Victim?
- Captain Joseph L. Norton.

128
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,778
Supply Corps,
63 years old, no family.

129
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,566
Six months from retirement,
spotless service record.

130
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,772
Never been married.

131
00:06:41,856 --> 00:06:44,076
He was about to be.
What about the engagement ring?

132
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:47,576
This is a copy of the receipt
where Norton bought it.

133
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,534
Three carats, grade E,
flawless, one minor occlusion.

134
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,431
- Track it?
- We got a BOLO out

135
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:55,528
on the stone right now, and McCadden
is checking with local fences.

136
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,249
That's good work.

137
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:00,878
You heard me.

138
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:05,581
Your mother-in-law is waiting
for you in the conference room.

139
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:07,374
I'd like to speak to you afterward.

140
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,637
Did you come all the way down here
to tell me that?

141
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,160
Ziva, that sketch artist comes,
you send her up.

142
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:16,310
- McGee, find the weapon. DiNozzo...
- Working on that ring, Boss.

143
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:18,687
Big-time.

144
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,919
He complimented me twice.

145
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,191
Very un-Gibbs.

146
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,401
We better keep an eye on that guy.

147
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,820
Don't you agree, Director?

148
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,572
Is that your decision,
Agent DiNozzo?

149
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:32,072
- It's not mine to make, sir.
- You got that right.

150
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:40,345
Thank you.

151
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:46,591
Still drinking
the same old swill, I see.

152
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:50,441
Keeps my engine running.

153
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:53,146
How is your father, Jethro?

154
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:55,752
He's stubborn.

155
00:07:57,298 --> 00:07:58,945
I guess that's a good thing.

156
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:01,295
How's Mac?

157
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:04,024
Mac and I divorced

158
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,795
about two years after it happened.

159
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:08,490
Rough.

160
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,304
On everybody.

161
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:14,237
It was never ever the same
after we lost the girls.

162
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:16,973
How about you?

163
00:08:19,308 --> 00:08:22,918
You know, you didn't have
to go through this... alone.

164
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:25,921
I called, Joann.
You never called me back.

165
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:29,413
That is not exactly
how I remember it.

166
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:34,555
What happened last night?

167
00:08:36,268 --> 00:08:40,075
Joe took me to a retirement party
for a friend of ours.

168
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,504
Navy Admiral.

169
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:44,999
And then he wanted
to walk down by the water.

170
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:46,358
He said that...

171
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:49,118
he wanted to ask me something.

172
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,457
He proposed to you.

173
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:58,252
I was looking at the ring
on my finger...

174
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,258
when this...

175
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,676
this stranger walked up.

176
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:06,086
Pulled his gun out.

177
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:08,050
What'd he look like?

178
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,423
He was white,

179
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,813
in his 20s.

180
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:13,622
Joe just went for that gun...

181
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:15,606
so fast.

182
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:18,913
I screamed at him
and I begged him not to do it.

183
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:21,454
I wanted to help, but I...

184
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,293
Excuse me.
The sketch artist is here.

185
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:33,582
You okay to do this?

186
00:09:34,644 --> 00:09:37,118
I want to do anything to help.

187
00:09:52,178 --> 00:09:53,413
This won't take long.

188
00:09:53,645 --> 00:09:54,927
I'll be the judge of that.

189
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,345
Protocol.

190
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:58,055
I am related to the victim.

191
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,893
S.O.P. is for you
to ask me to step aside.

192
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,561
Okay, I'm asking.

193
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,831
Okay, I'm declining.

194
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:07,882
She was Shannon's mother.

195
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:10,567
This is another violent crime.
It has to affect you.

196
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,932
Leon, we've all lost people.

197
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:16,843
- It was a long time ago.
- Don't give me that B.S., Gibbs.

198
00:10:16,927 --> 00:10:18,492
I know what pushes your buttons.

199
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,202
This could be a problem.

200
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,123
Okay, off the record.

201
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:26,750
Okay, try me.

202
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,127
I need to do this for Shannon.

203
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,095
She would have wanted it.

204
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,395
But if your judgment comes
into question even once...

205
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:48,589
- I'll take myself off the case.
- No.

206
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:49,815
I will.

207
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:05,303
<i>- We've already decided.
- You've already decided.</i>

208
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,791
<i>I don't have a choice, Shannon.
I'm a Marine.</i>

209
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:08,920
<i>It's my job.</i>

210
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,919
<i>You're not thinking
about this family!</i>

211
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:13,130
<i>You knew they wanted
to transfer you.</i>

212
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:15,423
<i>- It's not my decision.
- Mom, don't.</i>

213
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,052
<i>He's taking my girls away from me.</i>

214
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,054
<i>I made a commitment.
I have to honor it.</i>

215
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,889
<i>Don't you do this.</i>

216
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:22,765
<i>Please!</i>

217
00:11:29,786 --> 00:11:31,084
Sorry, Boss.

218
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:34,160
Detective McCadden's here.

219
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:39,824
You need anything?

220
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:45,155
You to... to leave.

221
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:47,080
Right.

222
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:52,252
- Looks like everything's here.
- What can we do for you, Detective?

223
00:11:53,155 --> 00:11:55,872
- Witness statements.
- Gibbs signed off on 'em. They're fine.

224
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:58,425
- You sure about that?
- Play nice, kiddies.

225
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,123
Plenty of room in the sandbox.

226
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:03,054
Joann Fielding told us
the same thing she told you.

227
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:05,437
Had the ring on
when they were robbed.

228
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:07,434
You look at her fingers?

229
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:09,768
Arthritis.

230
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,814
Try getting a size 4 ring on there.

231
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,317
- What size are you?
- She wouldn't know.

232
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:19,404
Five.
Every girl knows her ring size,

233
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,614
just in case.

234
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:25,243
- Joann said she was wearing it.
- You do a gunshot residue test?

235
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:26,953
Got to be a false positive.

236
00:12:27,117 --> 00:12:30,251
Ms. Fielding was within a foot
of the shots that killed her fiancé,

237
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,458
she'd be covered in cordite
and sulfur from the discharge.

238
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:34,753
Test would be useless.

239
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,797
Maybe. Maybe not.

240
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:39,949
All right, sketch artist finished.

241
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:42,719
- Downloading the drawing.
- You guys need help with the Bolos?

242
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,356
No,
I think we've got it covered, Phil.

243
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,306
After you.

244
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:47,975
What we are doing

245
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,230
is running the composite through facial
recognition, known felons first.

246
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,024
- You're already getting hits?
- Get out of here, McCadden.

247
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,330
Happy to.

248
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:07,369
Who is this?

249
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:09,259
I told you before.

250
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:12,332
This is the man
that I remember from last night.

251
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,633
That's the man

252
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:16,962
- who killed Joseph.
- The hell it is.

253
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:20,383
Jethro, what do you know?
You weren't even there.

254
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,467
That's not him.

255
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:22,843
I know what I saw.

256
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:25,929
That's Kyle Buckley.

257
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,438
Remember Kyle Buckley?

258
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,975
I went to high school
with Kyle Buckley.

259
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,038
This is the face that I saw.

260
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:35,731
I remember very clearly.

261
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:37,142
Yeah, so do I.

262
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:41,612
Kyle Buckley died in a car accident
three years ago.

263
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:47,075
I understand
that this is hard on you,

264
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:49,092
so I'm gonna ask you again.

265
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:53,277
Did you see the guy
who did this or not?

266
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:08,430
All right, here we go.

267
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,740
Sorry about that.
I drive a little bit like a maniac.

268
00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:12,684
Thank you.

269
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,489
This is a nice place you got here.

270
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,272
I bet you have some view.

271
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:19,605
That sea air!

272
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,235
Do you need me to walk you up?

273
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,345
No, no, I'm fine.

274
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,029
I just need to get a little rest.

275
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,948
Some warm milk, hot bath...

276
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:30,077
and you'll be fine in no time.

277
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:34,450
Well, I can tell you're a good man,
Agent DiNozzo.

278
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,247
Jethro doesn't trust many people.

279
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,719
If you don't mind my asking,
I'm just a little curious about...

280
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,493
Jethro.

281
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,437
What was he like when he was young?

282
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:53,939
You know, I don't think
I ever really understood Jethro.

283
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:55,861
I always liked him a lot.

284
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:58,021
I was very happy when...

285
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,742
he and Shannon got married.

286
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:02,329
We made a very nice family.

287
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,508
Then everything changed.

288
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:12,202
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to drag all this to the surface.

289
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,830
Trust me.
He'll be fine.

290
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:19,927
Thanks, Tony.

291
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:24,392
Boss.

292
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:27,342
We retrieved Captain Norton's laptop
and a few cell phones

293
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,551
from his apartment:
two of them were burn phones.

294
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:31,805
Why would a career Navy Captain
need a burn phone?

295
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,862
Keep talking.

296
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:36,184
Cells were purchased in Arizona
and used when Norton was still

297
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,870
assigned to a carrier battle group
operating in SOUTHCOM's AOR.

298
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:41,981
South American aircraft carriers.

299
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,921
Before his transfer to Norfolk.

300
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:46,445
- Who was he calling?
- Mostly, Nogales.

301
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:49,176
It's a border town,
half on the U.S. side, half in Mexico.

302
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,013
According to the DEA, a major drug
smuggling point for the Reynosa Cartel.

303
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:54,576
- Laptop?
- Cracked it.

304
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,657
Three different Zürich bank accounts
dating back almost 20 years,

305
00:15:57,741 --> 00:16:00,375
all of them dormant
since Norton transferred to Virginia.

306
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,669
Looks like our Captain was involved
in a drug trade, Boss.

307
00:16:03,082 --> 00:16:04,379
Ten million bucks.

308
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,922
Tidy little nest egg,

309
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,431
but, Captain must have bailed
on the drug business. Why?

310
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:12,607
Because he's not taking Navy trips
to South America anymore.

311
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:13,930
Cartel connections.

312
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,350
Ten years of encrypted emails
from Mexico.

313
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:18,941
I don't understand how Norton
smuggled drugs out of there

314
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:21,313
when our ships never drop anchor
in Mexican ports.

315
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,190
Maybe somebody wanted
their money back.

316
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:35,838
You smelling for the scent
of almonds, Doctor?

317
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,664
Perhaps these...
bullet tips were laced with cyanide.

318
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,726
It's your cologne, Mr. Palmer.

319
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:42,750
It is absolutely wretched.

320
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:45,471
Well, I'm just test-driving one
for my big date.

321
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:48,131
I'm also trying out
disposable contact lenses.

322
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:50,467
Well, change is good, Mr. Palmer.

323
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:53,892
As long as you are
the motivation for the change.

324
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,491
Smells like a French whorehouse
in here.

325
00:16:57,742 --> 00:16:58,731
That's me.

326
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:01,594
What are you trying to do,
Palmer, raise the dead?

327
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,439
Would you take these up
to Ms. Sciuto right away?

328
00:17:04,812 --> 00:17:05,724
And...

329
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:08,110
then use the Hazmat shower.

330
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:10,529
Yeah, use it twice.

331
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,449
I do hope he doesn't end up
with a broken one of these.

332
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,494
Yes, what I believe
is the kill shot entered

333
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,558
the lower left ventricle.

334
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:22,026
It traveled in an upward direction,

335
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,626
caused a severe aortic rupture.

336
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:27,590
But that's not
why I called you down here.

337
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:30,882
His entire gastronomic
tract is inflamed.

338
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,102
Yes, this is the handiwork
of leishmaniasis.

339
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,221
In this case,
visceral leishmaniasis.

340
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,641
It's a parasite you get
from infected sand flies,

341
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,902
found mostly
in Third World countries.

342
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,850
- Like Mexico?
- Possibly.

343
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,529
Cool, huh?
It's like a carnival.

344
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:56,831
If you hit the target,
you could win a stuffed animal.

345
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:59,202
I don't like stuffed animals much.

346
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,481
What do you got, Abs?

347
00:18:00,702 --> 00:18:03,351
Spatter patterns from Joann's coat.

348
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,826
- Doesn't match.
- I don't think she was standing

349
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,214
where she said she was standing
when the Captain was killed.

350
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:13,644
As a matter of fact,
I know she wasn't.

351
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:16,011
I mean, maybe...
maybe she got it wrong.

352
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,249
Or she had some sort
of post-traumatic stress disorientation.

353
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,225
Maybe, but what blood came from spatter
and what was transferred?

354
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:26,926
If she was standing behind the Captain
when he was struggling with the killer,

355
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:29,245
then the blood spatter would be here

356
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:31,709
on her front left shoulder
from this exit wound.

357
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,677
There's nothing there.

358
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:39,493
Jackpot!
It's Major Mass Spec calling.

359
00:18:43,716 --> 00:18:44,981
I love this machine.

360
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:47,042
If Major Mass Spec were a guy,

361
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,504
I would totally marry him
and bear his little mini-mass children.

362
00:18:51,356 --> 00:18:53,131
Abby, what am I looking at?

363
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,359
The results
from Joann's fingernail scrapings.

364
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:58,261
I've never found this much under
a living victim's fingernails before.

365
00:18:58,895 --> 00:19:01,371
It's 100% worsted wool fiber
with a Scotchgard coating.

366
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:03,872
It was manufactured in Denton,
New Hampshire.

367
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:06,517
- Navy pea coat?
- Government issue.

368
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,188
But this one has minute traces
of after-burned kerosene,

369
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:14,238
sea foam, and aspirated JP-5
aircraft fuel embedded in the surface.

370
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:17,072
Sailor on the deck
of an aircraft carrier?

371
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,990
On the flight deck, during takeoff.

372
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,363
Okay, flight crew.

373
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,465
That narrows down your suspect list
from a few million to like 7,000.

374
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:26,087
That doesn't help much, Abs.

375
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:28,729
I'm not going to leave you
with a "doesn't help much".

376
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,753
These fibers are
specifically from epaulets.

377
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:34,840
Pea coats don't have epaulets.

378
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:37,352
Officer bridge coats do.

379
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,870
Beautiful morning.

380
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,719
Member of my own family
has been lying to me.

381
00:19:57,621 --> 00:19:59,150
Your story doesn't add up.

382
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:02,698
Maybe your math is wrong.

383
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:08,875
The man I loved just died in my arms.
What the hell do you want from me?

384
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:10,813
Respect.

385
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:12,888
A little honesty maybe.

386
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,116
I've always given you respect.

387
00:20:17,402 --> 00:20:19,566
When, Shannon was alive,

388
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:23,176
- maybe.
- In my family, you have to earn it.

389
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:25,754
When those girls died,

390
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:27,799
you did nothing.

391
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,664
Did you know
that Joe Norton dealt drugs?

392
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,027
- That's ridiculous.
- I can prove it.

393
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,694
I loved him. I knew him.

394
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,216
How well did you know him?

395
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:42,727
You know he had
millions in the bank?

396
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:46,460
Drug money from his dealings
with the Reynosa cartel...

397
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:49,296
- the same men who killed your daughter.
- Shut up.

398
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:52,125
Shannon. Kelly.

399
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:53,683
Mexico. Norton.

400
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,879
They all have one thing in common,
Joann: you.

401
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:02,677
You are the one who took
my family away from me.

402
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,905
I'm a Marine.

403
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:05,265
I had orders.

404
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,724
I didn't have a choice.
I had to go.

405
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:09,689
Because of you, they're dead.

406
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:12,281
I didn't kill them.

407
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:16,028
But it was still
your responsibility.

408
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:19,542
Why weren't you there
to take care of our girls?

409
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:25,528
This is about the murder
of Joseph Norton.

410
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:31,025
Well, go do your damn job, Jethro.

411
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:33,773
Nothing ever stopped you before.

412
00:21:34,688 --> 00:21:36,803
Nothing's going to stop you now.

413
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,767
You want to learn
about being a real man,

414
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,602
you gotta study
the Japanese Samurai.

415
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,648
These guys are like Gibbs
with even bigger stones and less to say.

416
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:58,274
Is that even possible?

417
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:07,492
I was, I was just tracking down
Norton's deployment history.

418
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:12,720
Yeah, we're... we're on it.

419
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,999
Boss on his way back?

420
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,939
- Stop what you're doing.
- Why?

421
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:19,462
He wants us to check
some phone records.

422
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,130
On Norton's burn phones?

423
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,716
No, Joann Fielding.

424
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:24,586
Financial accounts, too.

425
00:22:27,231 --> 00:22:28,407
Any calls to Mexico?

426
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:31,404
I went back five years.
Nothing out of the ordinary,

427
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:35,335
except there were plenty of calls
to Nogales, Arizona, the U.S. side.

428
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:36,851
Who?

429
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:38,648
Only one number.

430
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,544
Let me throw it up
on the plasma here.

431
00:22:41,582 --> 00:22:44,946
Joann called Martin Hendricks,
a retired P.D.

432
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,781
listed as
"Locator of Missing Persons".

433
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,408
Joann's looking for somebody.

434
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,870
Based on checking account, she's paying
this guy on and off for almost 2 years,

435
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,883
both in the U.S.
and across the border.

436
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,416
Hendricks is not cheap,
but he does claim a 98% success rate.

437
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:58,639
How much she spend?

438
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,838
Almost $28,000.

439
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,884
DiNozzo, get Ziva,
head on down to Arizona and talk to him.

440
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,580
Arizona?
Do I have to?

441
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:11,806
My grandfather retired to Arizona.
It's a dry heat.

442
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:22,231
Oh, my God!

443
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,613
Aren't you hot?

444
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,156
I've been told that before.

445
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,116
I'm talking about temperature.

446
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:33,745
Stop complaining. This is what winter
feels like in Israel.

447
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,913
We're not in Israel.

448
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,825
We're in the good old U.S. of A,

449
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:40,484
my little immigrant friend,
where we like to embrace central air,

450
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:41,999
not melanoma.

451
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,970
I'm gonna knock.

452
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:49,664
Mr. Hendricks, NCIS.

453
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:52,191
Federal agents.
We need to talk with you.

454
00:23:52,594 --> 00:23:54,643
Something has been broken off
inside the lock.

455
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,203
- Well, maybe it's the key.
- No, a nail.

456
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,505
Someone did not want
anyone entering.

457
00:24:00,627 --> 00:24:02,156
Something's not right.

458
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,366
I'm going in.

459
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,901
We're going in.

460
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,201
This guy knows how to live.

461
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:17,122
Or not.

462
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:21,131
It's like a homemade toaster oven.

463
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,337
Guess we found Hendricks.

464
00:24:25,261 --> 00:24:26,355
Well done.

465
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:27,623
Thanks.

466
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:29,376
Not you. Him.

467
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:50,224
You hired a retired cop
in Arizona to work for you.

468
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:53,427
This is your file.

469
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:55,207
How is Mr. Hendricks?

470
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:03,622
Oh, my God.

471
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:05,670
What happened?

472
00:25:07,153 --> 00:25:08,377
It's just us.

473
00:25:09,222 --> 00:25:10,319
There's no video.

474
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,677
Talk to me.

475
00:25:14,524 --> 00:25:15,524
He's dead.

476
00:25:16,397 --> 00:25:17,632
You connect the dots.

477
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,144
I don't know
what you're talking about.

478
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:25,543
You spent $28,000 looking for someone
who spent a lot of time in Mexico.

479
00:25:25,627 --> 00:25:27,171
Who was that?
Norton?

480
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,196
Yes.

481
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,719
I met him in Baja
when I was on vacation.

482
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:35,642
Then when I came back,
I lost his number, so I...

483
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:38,673
I hired Mr. Hendricks to find him.

484
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,748
You took out a bank loan
to go on a second date?

485
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:45,250
Don't patronize me, Jethro.

486
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:47,587
You see the trail you're leaving?

487
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,647
People are dead.

488
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,376
Dangerous drug dealers
are connected.

489
00:25:53,276 --> 00:25:55,261
And you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

490
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,310
I'm the victim here.

491
00:25:58,394 --> 00:26:01,267
This situation has got
your name written all over it.

492
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,187
I don't know exactly what you did
or why you did it,

493
00:26:05,055 --> 00:26:06,817
but because of Shannon...

494
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:09,552
I'll give you a chance.

495
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:12,628
Do you want my help or don't you?

496
00:26:20,088 --> 00:26:21,233
Good luck.

497
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,515
It's open.

498
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:46,187
You called, Mr. Gibbs?

499
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,459
You want a beer?

500
00:26:49,112 --> 00:26:51,192
Yeah, if you have
a slice of cold pizza to go with it.

501
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,670
I think I can handle that.

502
00:26:55,707 --> 00:26:57,359
Crazy day at the office.

503
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:02,328
Amazing how people keep suing
each other even in the...

504
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:05,170
worst economy in years.

505
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,038
Better than them killing each other.

506
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,926
They do that, too,

507
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,421
when they lose.

508
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:15,136
Thanks.

509
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:21,227
So what's this about?
You made it sound important.

510
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:22,386
It is.

511
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,603
You still do pro bono work?

512
00:27:25,968 --> 00:27:27,237
If the price is right.

513
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:29,147
Yeah.

514
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,333
I have someone who...
might need your help.

515
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:36,362
Who is it?

516
00:27:38,572 --> 00:27:40,064
My former mother-in-law.

517
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:41,993
You're kidding?

518
00:27:47,152 --> 00:27:49,564
And if anybody asks,

519
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:52,194
we never talked.
You okay with that?

520
00:27:54,147 --> 00:27:55,890
Representing your ex-mother-in-law?

521
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:59,771
"Okay" might be
the wrong description.

522
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:01,447
"Conflicted", maybe.

523
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,644
- Turn out the lights when you leave.
- Maybe the worst date I've ever had.

524
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,900
Love is but a sweet embrace,
a whispered phrase,

525
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,319
- a graceful face.
- Is that Tennyson?

526
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,994
No, no, Mallard.

527
00:28:18,126 --> 00:28:21,705
There was a poetry competition
in school when I was 15.

528
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,701
I took second place.

529
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:24,994
Very romantic.

530
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:27,520
I've tried to put you in the mood,
Mr. Palmer.

531
00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:30,016
It's a pity your embalmer friend
isn't here to see this.

532
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,334
It's very unusual.

533
00:28:32,095 --> 00:28:33,795
Can I bring her after our date?

534
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:36,341
What'd he die of?

535
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:38,166
A dry wit.

536
00:28:41,114 --> 00:28:43,545
I am sorry.
He was baked to death.

537
00:28:44,937 --> 00:28:46,933
The bindings
that were around his wrists

538
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:50,527
and ankles were there simply
to hold him in place.

539
00:28:50,749 --> 00:28:54,620
Extreme thirst can be
a significantly painful death.

540
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,109
Mexican cartels.

541
00:28:57,415 --> 00:28:59,654
Yes, they're a little more public
with their executions,

542
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,416
and certainly more bloody.

543
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,697
What are you thinking?

544
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:05,719
I thinking that they made
an exception in this case.

545
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,254
- What do you got?
- Boss, Norfolk Sanitation

546
00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:13,000
just found Norton's phone from
the other night in a marina dumpster.

547
00:29:13,094 --> 00:29:15,043
- <i>Somebody tossed it.</i>
- You find anything?

548
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:16,295
<i>Possibly.</i>

549
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:19,549
There were two calls earlier that day
to the same local number, a Lieutenant

550
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:20,966
David Shankton.

551
00:29:21,187 --> 00:29:22,677
According to the VFTP database,

552
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,305
<i>Shankton owns the same make
and model handgun</i>

553
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,265
that was used
to kill Captain Norton.

554
00:29:28,943 --> 00:29:30,305
I can't believe he's dead.

555
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:33,104
I just saw him
at the Admiral's retirement dinner.

556
00:29:33,713 --> 00:29:35,315
How well you know Captain Norton?

557
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:38,430
I've served under him

558
00:29:38,514 --> 00:29:40,586
at the Supply Center
for the past four years.

559
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:42,445
Before that?

560
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:46,320
We met in the Yucatan down in Mexico

561
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:47,827
over a decade ago.

562
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:51,873
You and the Captain Margarita,
amigos?

563
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,708
No, Sir,

564
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:55,129
nothing like that.

565
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,629
Before I joined the service, I worked
fishing charters. That's how we met.

566
00:29:59,394 --> 00:30:01,495
Captain Norton inspired me
to join the Navy.

567
00:30:02,827 --> 00:30:04,140
It's a touching story.

568
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:06,544
We compared Norton's credit card
statements to yours,

569
00:30:06,628 --> 00:30:07,972
and you know what we found?

570
00:30:08,459 --> 00:30:12,266
You guys were both in the same town
at the same time in Mexico,

571
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:14,020
18 different times.

572
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:15,728
It's a popular place.

573
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:19,137
Gulf and Reynosa cartels smuggle
a lot of drugs out of the Yucatan.

574
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:20,234
You know that?

575
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,028
So what's your point?

576
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:24,579
Do you own a nine-millimeter,
Lieutenant?

577
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,659
I did.

578
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,995
Somebody stole it from my house
about a month ago.

579
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,727
I'm sorry.
What the heck is going on here?

580
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,626
We think you two had
a little partnership.

581
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,366
That's what we think is going on.

582
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:40,233
Cartel gives you the drugs.

583
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:42,034
You have
a little rendezvous with Norton,

584
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:44,260
and then he brings 'em back
to Norfolk, except...

585
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:47,053
he wasn't really sharing
the wealth, was he?

586
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:51,516
I didn't kill anybody.

587
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,184
You talked to him yesterday.

588
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,115
You knew he'd be at the party,

589
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:58,022
knew that he was gonna propose
to Joann.

590
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,610
Do you mind
if I just take a look at this?

591
00:31:03,535 --> 00:31:04,841
If the fibers match,

592
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,572
it puts you at the murder scene.

593
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:10,417
Somebody's trying to frame me,
all right?

594
00:31:10,737 --> 00:31:13,029
If they are,
they're doing a pretty good job of it.

595
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:16,251
Get the sample to Abby.

596
00:31:19,938 --> 00:31:21,811
Then get over to Joann's.
Keep an eye on her.

597
00:31:21,895 --> 00:31:23,432
Boss, this is our guy.

598
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:26,394
Okay, samples to Abby... on it.

599
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:39,139
Well, if it isn't M. Allison Hart.

600
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:40,898
Agent DiNozzo.

601
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:43,275
You two know each other?

602
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,902
Ms. Fielding is my client.

603
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:47,780
You get around.

604
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:49,656
She doesn't feel safe here.

605
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:52,664
- You all right, Joann?
- Yes, Tony.

606
00:31:52,748 --> 00:31:54,177
I'll be just fine.

607
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:03,807
She's been
through a very difficult loss

608
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:07,091
and your investigation isn't making
things any easier for her.

609
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,191
Well, I'm sorry.

610
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:11,061
Now listen, do you think
I could have a...

611
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,472
word with your client for a second?

612
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:18,894
Anything you have to say to her,
you can now say to me.

613
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,904
Good night, Agent DiNozzo.

614
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,564
This an intervention?

615
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,542
Told me there were cocktails.

616
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,255
You're holding Lieutenant Shankton
for Norton's murder.

617
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,007
So you think he did it?

618
00:32:51,046 --> 00:32:51,802
Maybe.

619
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:54,512
- Then why are you holding him?
- Evidence says he did it.

620
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,557
He had a similar weapon, had motive.

621
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,110
Plus, he's the only connection we have
to the Reynosa cartel, and I want him.

622
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,940
Joann Fielding knew Lieutenant Shankton
through her fiancé.

623
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:07,193
Yeah, and...?

624
00:33:07,343 --> 00:33:09,570
You must know she spent time
at Shankton's house.

625
00:33:09,965 --> 00:33:11,532
We think she set him up.

626
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:14,057
Both men linked
to the same drug cartel

627
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:16,238
responsible for Shannon
and Kelly's deaths.

628
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,730
Really, Leon?

629
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,144
That makes her awfully clever.

630
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,768
My mother-in-law the <i>vigilante</i>.

631
00:33:24,192 --> 00:33:25,862
Go ahead, Gibbs, cross it.

632
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:27,171
Try me.

633
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,673
I'm just doing my job.

634
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,974
- So am I.
- You want me to step out?

635
00:33:32,107 --> 00:33:35,429
Remember, I said if your judgment
should come into question even once...

636
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:37,515
I'll take myself off this case.

637
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:39,308
Will you be able to do it?

638
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:42,465
Arrest her.

639
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:57,716
With the new information
from Abby's report,

640
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,864
I decided to take another look.

641
00:33:59,948 --> 00:34:01,048
Three slugs.

642
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:03,381
One lodged itself in Norton's spine,

643
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:05,365
the other two passed right through.

644
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:06,727
Bilaterally.

645
00:34:07,273 --> 00:34:08,567
However...

646
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,224
Joann...

647
00:34:13,976 --> 00:34:17,968
could not have been behind Norton
when he tried to disarm his attacker.

648
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:22,168
There's no way she was
on the side of the exit wound.

649
00:34:22,718 --> 00:34:25,256
The actual blood spatter
on her was...

650
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:28,212
low down around the waist.

651
00:34:28,804 --> 00:34:31,723
She had to have been
in front of him,

652
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,224
and facing him.

653
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:36,617
I'm sorry, but...

654
00:34:37,257 --> 00:34:39,374
she fired the shots herself, Jethro.

655
00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:43,036
I'm sure of it.

656
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,685
I need to talk to her...

657
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,991
alone.

658
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:55,469
She's my client now.

659
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:58,721
You're lead on the investigation.
It can work against her best interests.

660
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,665
She's your client
because I asked you.

661
00:35:01,355 --> 00:35:03,726
Was your mistake. By the way,

662
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:05,586
you're out of beer.

663
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:08,564
Could you please get some light beer?
This crap you drink...

664
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,723
- It's doing a number on me.
- She's family.

665
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:12,654
I need to talk to her.

666
00:35:18,073 --> 00:35:20,201
I'll advise my client against it,

667
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:22,311
but it's up to her.

668
00:35:25,243 --> 00:35:27,176
What are you up to, Mr. Gibbs?

669
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:34,173
You have been defending
guilty people for too long.

670
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,915
As long as we battle each other
and somebody wins, I have done my job.

671
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,535
And that's okay with you?

672
00:35:51,557 --> 00:35:53,083
You really want to talk to her?

673
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:57,984
I want some answers.
I want the truth.

674
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:02,414
Law school 101.

675
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:05,955
Truth's overrated.

676
00:36:10,611 --> 00:36:13,371
Is this your personal
torture chamber?

677
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:18,595
The only person ever
tortured down here is me.

678
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:24,047
Thank you.

679
00:36:28,246 --> 00:36:29,912
I know everything, Joann.

680
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:37,945
You knew that you couldn't get
Shannon and Kelly's real killers,

681
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:41,733
and so you went after Norton.

682
00:36:42,598 --> 00:36:44,634
Guilty by association.

683
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:49,574
We're not doing this.

684
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,042
Sit.

685
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:57,277
That ex-cop you hired...

686
00:36:57,745 --> 00:37:00,246
to go to Arizona
to look for Norton...

687
00:37:01,195 --> 00:37:03,944
the Reynosa cartel, they knew he was
snooping around

688
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:06,186
and they killed him.

689
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,665
So you found Norton...

690
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:12,271
you did, and you charmed him and...

691
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,905
you killed one man, you framed another,
and you...

692
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,047
planned it all like a pro.

693
00:37:22,528 --> 00:37:24,185
Really, are you that smart?

694
00:37:26,654 --> 00:37:28,614
I'm just a mother

695
00:37:28,922 --> 00:37:30,887
who lost everything she loved.

696
00:37:32,243 --> 00:37:33,450
Shannon...

697
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:35,089
and Kelly...

698
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:37,738
Norton didn't kill 'em.

699
00:37:40,421 --> 00:37:41,727
But I know who did.

700
00:38:03,095 --> 00:38:04,331
How'd it feel?

701
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,511
Satisfying?

702
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:20,584
The night that he proposed,

703
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:24,637
he was holding me in his arms.

704
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:29,285
I whispered our girls' names

705
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:31,528
in his ear.

706
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:34,937
Then I pulled the trigger

707
00:38:35,174 --> 00:38:35,938
one,

708
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:37,538
two,

709
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,608
three times...

710
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:43,129
and I watched him die.

711
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:51,520
Nobody ever need to know.

712
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:57,382
You and I both did what we did...

713
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:00,205
for them.

714
00:39:11,798 --> 00:39:13,642
You are under arrest for the murder

715
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,625
of Captain Joseph Norton,

716
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,715
for tampering with evidence,

717
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:21,150
for interfering
with a criminal investigation.

718
00:39:23,187 --> 00:39:26,828
You just arrested
my client illegally and unlawfully.

719
00:39:28,393 --> 00:39:31,660
You interrogated her without proper
citation of her Miranda rights,

720
00:39:32,323 --> 00:39:34,204
and you coerced a confession.

721
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:39,438
If you don't release her right away,
I will pursue legal action.

722
00:39:43,997 --> 00:39:45,610
The case'll never stick, right?

723
00:39:48,365 --> 00:39:50,306
You just made a very big mistake.

724
00:39:57,475 --> 00:39:58,393
You won.

725
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:00,430
Did I?

726
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:02,927
Take care of yourself, Joann.

727
00:40:08,646 --> 00:40:10,033
You, too, Jethro.

728
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,174
Abby...

729
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:46,879
matched the fibers
from Shankton's coat.

730
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:49,625
He had the means, the opportunity,

731
00:40:50,278 --> 00:40:51,978
about $10 million worth of motive.

732
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,467
Lieutenant's a drug dealer.

733
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:56,737
He deserves to do time.

734
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:01,333
Boss, what about your mother-in-law?

735
00:41:02,382 --> 00:41:03,737
Joann Fielding

736
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,090
is no longer a suspect

737
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:08,702
or a person of interest
in this investigation.

738
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:11,510
Great.

739
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,597
Can we go home now?

740
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:16,181
Yeah, good night.

741
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,849
If I hurry,
maybe I can catch <i>Rashomon</i>.

742
00:41:32,884 --> 00:41:34,091
Hey, guys, guys.

743
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,122
Breena, these are my coworkers.

744
00:41:37,321 --> 00:41:38,787
Everyone, this is Breena.

745
00:41:41,288 --> 00:41:42,541
Life isn't fair.

746
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:44,126
Hey, guys, pleasure to meet you.

747
00:41:44,516 --> 00:41:46,461
Ziva, McGee, and...

748
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,671
Tony, right?

749
00:41:48,364 --> 00:41:49,481
I described you.

750
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:53,093
Apparently, the details were accurate.
She has a photographic memory.

751
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:55,959
Jimmy loves me for my mind.

752
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:58,359
Isn't he the cutest thing ever?

753
