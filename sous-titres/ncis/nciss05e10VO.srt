00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:29,177
Come on, <i>Iron Fist</i>,
hit me with your best shot.

10
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:31,352
Could you be careful, please?
This is number 14.

11
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:33,091
It's the first appearance of <i>Sabertooth</i>.

12
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:36,771
Does that make you want to hit me?

13
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:38,544
It's really tempting.

14
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,185
But I think I'm gonna pass.
Maybe Ziva'll do it.

15
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:43,064
Maybe Ziva will do what?

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,879
Been working on my six-pack.

17
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,842
You know... Abs.

18
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,706
You and Abby have been drinking?

19
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,749
No, abdominals.

20
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:51,161
No more beer gut for me.

21
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:54,489
I've been training hard-core,
getting the core hard-carved.

22
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:56,344
- Hard as wood.
- To match your head.

23
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:59,562
You know, I think you're afraid
that if you hit me as hard as you could,

24
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,768
I'd think I was being tickled
with a feather.

25
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:04,496
I will take a swing at your six-pack.

26
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:06,639
Well...

27
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,103
It's more like a four-pack

28
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:09,773
and then there's this one sort of long,

29
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:11,038
stubborn one, never mind.

30
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:12,759
Do it.

31
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:13,843
As hard as she can?

32
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:14,915
As hard as you can.

33
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,625
- You know that's how Houdini died.
- Ziva, did you kill Houdini?

34
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:20,038
It is possible.
I do not remember all their names.

35
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:21,791
Okay, hold on.

36
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:26,745
Okay, do it.

37
00:02:28,805 --> 00:02:30,222
Escaped mental patient.

38
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:31,994
Exactly what I'm thinking, boss.

39
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,496
Bethesda Naval Hospital.

40
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,066
Attacked an orderly busted up the place.
Come on, let's go.

41
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:39,310
Hey, come on, I don't need the rescue.

42
00:02:39,387 --> 00:02:41,296
Seriously, give me your best shot.
Right now.

43
00:02:45,673 --> 00:02:47,252
Oh, yeah!

44
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:48,519
Not bad.

45
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:50,819
Not as good as Gibbs, though.

46
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,472
Cramped quarters.

47
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:58,583
In-patient wing.

48
00:02:58,598 --> 00:02:59,665
It's a secure unit.

49
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:00,972
Least it's meant to be.

50
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:02,222
How long's he been here?

51
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:04,743
Got shipped home from Iraq
about two weeks ago.

52
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,397
He's been receiving treatment
for post-traumatic stress.

53
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:08,698
What happened to him?

54
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,012
Beats the hell out of me.

55
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:11,226
Guy didn't talk much.

56
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:13,588
<i>That's typical of PTSD.</i>

57
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:16,744
The shrink's been trying to get him
to open up as part of his treatment.

58
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:17,947
What's the other part?

59
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:19,053
Meds.

60
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,834
Combination of antidepressant
paroxetine and

61
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:24,170
<i>mild sedatives that help him sleep.</i>

62
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,904
Might want to consider something
a little stronger.

63
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,534
He did this with his bare hands?

64
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,320
Yeah.

65
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:31,472
Impressive.

66
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:32,491
Outside.

67
00:03:34,185 --> 00:03:35,461
You already done in here?

68
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:38,087
Yeah. Don't need to look the one place
we know he's not.

69
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:40,781
Corporal Damon Werth, Force Recon,

70
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:43,256
part of the Second Marines
stationed in Ramadi.

71
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:46,187
Transferred out 15 days ago,
ahead of his unit.

72
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:49,857
Brief stops at Ramstein Air Base
in Germany, then here.

73
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:51,807
What happened
after he went out the window?

74
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,953
He jacked a ride
pulling out of the driveway.

75
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:56,781
Where's the driver?

76
00:03:58,522 --> 00:04:00,116
There was a lot going on, I...

77
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,800
Where's the driver?!

78
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:03,187
I don't know.

79
00:04:04,183 --> 00:04:05,766
Boss, I could pull up the exterior

80
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:07,461
cameras, might be able to see something.

81
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:09,672
<i>In fact, I could probably</i>

82
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:11,963
be doing that right now,
instead of talking about it.

83
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,468
<i>All right, listen up, people.</i>

84
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:22,169
Our fugitive has been on the run
for 90 minutes.

85
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:23,911
It has been three hours, Tony.

86
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:27,656
Average foot speed over uneven ground,

87
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:28,743
barring injuries,

88
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,347
is four miles per hour.

89
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,145
He's not on foot. He's in a car.

90
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,403
What I need

91
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,143
from each and every one of you

92
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,118
is a hard-target search

93
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:40,933
of every gas station,
residence, warehouse,

94
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,691
farmhouse, henhouse,
outhouse and doghouse in the area.

95
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:46,821
Our fugitive has a name and it is...

96
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:48,358
Corporal Damon Werth.

97
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:50,246
<i>Hey.</i>

98
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,763
The Tommy Lee Jones speech,

99
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,732
every time we have a fugitive, really?

100
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:55,858
<i>He's not just a fugitive.</i>

101
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:57,180
Werth took a hostage.

102
00:04:57,536 --> 00:04:58,348
Who?

103
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:00,281
<i>Dr. Adrian De La Casa.</i>

104
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:01,763
BOLO out on his car.

105
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:04,360
De La Casa's
one of the attending psychiatrists

106
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,266
on the ward, had the graveyard shift.

107
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,969
Involved in Werth's treatment?

108
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,103
Might help his chances.

109
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,036
He knows who he's dealing with.

110
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,435
At least someone does.

111
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:15,079
What does De La Casa think of Werth?

112
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:16,617
Well...

113
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:20,513
Patient exhibits paranoia,
delusional fantasies,

114
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,617
hyperactivity,

115
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:24,216
tendency towards violent outbursts.

116
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:26,009
What does Werth think of De La Casa?

117
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:27,747
Doesn't say.

118
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:35,012
I think I'm staring at the man
in charge right now.

119
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:36,224
You are?

120
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:38,404
I'm gonna find out what Corporal
Werth's status is.

121
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:39,836
So are we.

122
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:43,091
Yes, sir.

123
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,871
Apologies.

124
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,833
Senator Hawkins. Ray Vincent.

125
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:48,402
Senator's Public Affairs.

126
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,541
You're Gibbs?

127
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:51,133
<i>You need to work fast.</i>

128
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:53,632
This could be a potential PR disaster.

129
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,659
It's always my primary concern.

130
00:05:55,864 --> 00:05:56,731
See,

131
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:58,507
the thing is,

132
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,884
in three days,
the senator is scheduled to give

133
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,582
Corporal Werth the Silver Star.

134
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:05,418
Your missing Marine's a hero.

135
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:16,440
When you're dealing with a guy
on the run, you gotta

136
00:06:16,547 --> 00:06:17,834
climb inside his head

137
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:19,546
think his thoughts.

138
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:21,695
What would he do?
Where would he go?

139
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,525
Did a one-armed man murder his wife?

140
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:26,331
Would he dress up like a clown
and join a traveling circus?

141
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:28,775
Like Jimmy Stewart
in The Greatest Show on Earth.

142
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:30,988
Do any of your ideas come from reality?

143
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:32,037
Sure.

144
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:33,256
Just not your reality.

145
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:35,900
Could you try to zero in
on Werth's reality?

146
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:39,078
Considering that the dude skipped
the loony bin,

147
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:42,223
maybe a little bit of non-linear
fuzzy logic is the key to tracking him.

148
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,691
Maybe he was accused of a crime
he didn't commit

149
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:47,457
and is trying to promptly escape
to the Los Angeles underground.

150
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:50,308
He's not the A-Team, McGee.

151
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:51,483
He might be,

152
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:54,009
aside from a single medical incident
that delayed his career

153
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:56,332
<i>Corporal Werth is your poster boy
for the Marine Corps.</i>

154
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:58,340
Performance evals?

155
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:01,469
Rapid improvement in every facet since
he enlisted four years ago.

156
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:04,760
<i>Strength, speed, stamina,
mental acuity, everything.</i>

157
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:06,521
Steady promotion up the ranks,

158
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:07,844
due to make Sergeant.

159
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:10,048
The only time Werth has been
away from the Marines

160
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:12,594
was to go to England
for a joint training exercise

161
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:14,049
<i>with British SAS.</i>

162
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:15,619
That was his vacation?

163
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:16,714
How did he do?

164
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:17,935
He aced it.

165
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,777
I have to brief the senator

166
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:21,751
and then try to run interference
with the media.

167
00:07:21,797 --> 00:07:23,398
You'll update me every half hour, yes?

168
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,208
The clock is ticking on this, people.

169
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:31,566
<i>Sophie, yeah.
Let the senator know that I just</i>

170
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:33,168
<i>met with NCIS and it's under control.</i>

171
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:35,217
The suit fill you in
on what happened in Iraq?

172
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,110
Werth's unit was ambushed and captured.

173
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:40,590
He was being tortured
when he broke loose.

174
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:42,112
He killed his interrogators

175
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,047
and carried all three
of his men to safety.

176
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,494
Leathernecks nicknamed him
"Corporal Punishment."

177
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,900
What else you got?

178
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:51,151
Werth's life.

179
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:52,570
<i>Locations of interest.</i>

180
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,255
<i>Boot camp at Parris Island,</i>

181
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,145
stationed at Quantico then LeJeune

182
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,823
before shipping out overseas.

183
00:07:57,858 --> 00:07:58,919
Family?

184
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:00,121
Unmarried. No siblings.

185
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:01,726
His father is retired SAS,

186
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:03,758
mother is a behavioral therapist.

187
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:05,159
<i>They live in Michigan.</i>

188
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,995
Senator Hawkins' home state.

189
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:08,773
Friends in the area?

190
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:11,560
Yeah, I don't think he had any friends
outside of the Corps, boss.

191
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:12,899
Dr. De La Casa?

192
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:15,371
Navy Captain.
Resides in Reston, Virginia.

193
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,736
He works at Bethesda.

194
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:19,099
So he'd have to take
the Dulles Toll Road every day.

195
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:21,001
So he would have a SmartTag, McGoo.

196
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:24,938
Scanned on 267 yesterday.

197
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:26,111
Again this morning,

198
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:27,343
entering Virginia.

199
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:29,407
Tried to triangulate De La Casa's cell,

200
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:31,701
but it's either switched off
or Werth's laying low

201
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:33,278
in the countryside, out of range.

202
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:35,479
Wait,

203
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:37,599
SmartTag, just entered the District.

204
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:39,576
Try his cell again.

205
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:47,005
- Hello?
<i>- Who is this?</i>

206
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,818
Gibbs. NCIS.

207
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:52,913
I'm looking for
a Dr. Adrian De La Casa.

208
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,188
<i>Well, look harder.</i>

209
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:58,109
Northwest DC. If he leaves his cell on,

210
00:08:58,145 --> 00:08:59,475
I can get an exact location.

211
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:00,695
Do it on the way.

212
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:34,442
Just lights.

213
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:38,617
For what?

214
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:43,007
Dr. De La Casa?

215
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:43,972
Yes.

216
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:47,988
I thought you were him coming back.

217
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:49,696
Where'd he go?

218
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:51,232
I don't know.

219
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:53,536
He did something with my laptop
and disappeared.

220
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:55,291
What's with the lights?

221
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:57,854
Boss?

222
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:06,744
Now he knows what we look like.

223
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:13,441
I kept trying to get through to him,
but he didn't seem to recognize me.

224
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:16,117
Well, it's not unusual for PTSD victims

225
00:10:16,145 --> 00:10:17,213
to exhibit

226
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,799
dissociative behavior.

227
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:20,487
You're the medical examiner?

228
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:22,825
I am. But I have also done an extensive

229
00:10:22,842 --> 00:10:25,559
study of the science
of psychological profiling.

230
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:27,296
Well, the patient.

231
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:28,356
Corporal Werth.

232
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:31,275
Werth...

233
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:34,799
He didn't speak for some time
after he took the wheel.

234
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:37,213
He seemed confused by his surroundings.

235
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,244
Well, what gave you that impression?

236
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:42,397
He kept mumbling something about sand
or the lack thereof.

237
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,666
Expected to find himself in the desert.

238
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,515
I believe so.

239
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,402
I tried to talk to him,

240
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:51,809
he stopped the car, and accused me
of manipulating the environment.

241
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:53,837
Of making him see things
that weren't there.

242
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:54,948
Why you?

243
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:57,090
He may have thought
I was a voice in his head.

244
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:00,681
Obviously,
I tried to convince him otherwise.

245
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:02,578
He subdued me,

246
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:03,632
bound me.

247
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,014
You didn't resist.

248
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,681
I was afraid for my life.

249
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,818
He picked up on that fear.

250
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:10,489
Made him feel in control.

251
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:12,995
He could've been riding an adrenaline

252
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,079
high following his escape.

253
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:17,736
Then he asked about PFCs

254
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,342
Whitney, Stone and Heatherton.

255
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:21,791
The other men in his unit.

256
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:24,559
He wanted to know where they were,
where we were keeping them.

257
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,735
Where are you keeping them?

258
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:28,854
We're not keeping them.

259
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:34,843
McGee managed to

260
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:37,333
blah, blah, blah
computer-geek stuff and he

261
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:38,744
figured out that the

262
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,448
video feed was being accessed from

263
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:42,237
a public site a few blocks
from the garage.

264
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:43,356
While he watched us.

265
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:45,119
Yep, that is exactly true.

266
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:47,291
Last files accessed
on De La Casa's laptop...

267
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,351
were Patient logs.

268
00:11:49,465 --> 00:11:50,309
Yeah.

269
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,164
- Three names in particular...
- Whitney, Stone, and Heatherton.

270
00:11:56,493 --> 00:11:58,737
Well, that's kind of creepy,
that you can...

271
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:04,471
Whitney and Heatherton
were treated and released

272
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:05,892
for wounds sustained in combat.

273
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:07,656
Transferred to LeJeune
for redeployment.

274
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:09,050
Stone?

275
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:12,144
His injuries were the most severe.

276
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:15,198
He's undergoing rehabilitative
physical therapy at Walter Reed.

277
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:16,502
Werth is on his way there.

278
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:18,219
Is he going to break out
of one hospital

279
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,856
just to break into another one?
I'm going to go warm up the car.

280
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,467
Jethro,

281
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:26,126
Werth's behavior is consistent
with post-traumatic stress.

282
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:29,081
But he didn't harm De La Casa
unnecessarily.

283
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:31,624
He still had the mental capacity
to booby trap the car.

284
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,360
It shows that somewhere in his mind,
he's operating clearly.

285
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,734
It's his training, Ducky.

286
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,780
As a syndrome,
PTSD is in its infancy,

287
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,231
even though the symptoms
had long been recognized

288
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:44,835
by returning soldiers.

289
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:45,940
Shell shock.

290
00:12:46,155 --> 00:12:49,218
Yeah. Well,
there was a landmark legal case

291
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:51,855
The Buffalo Creek Disaster.

292
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:54,492
A West Virginia coal
mining community was

293
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:58,173
utterly destroyed when a dam gave way
during a heavy rainstorm.

294
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,652
Psychologists descended
upon the ruined valley

295
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,703
to identify the common malady

296
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:05,349
that afflicted the survivors.

297
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:07,625
Nightmares, insomnia, paranoia,

298
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,424
depression, memory loss.

299
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:11,382
You know the symptoms well.

300
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:14,767
Now, I'm of the opinion that Werth

301
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:17,898
is replaying a scenario
that he's already completed.

302
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,640
He thinks he's still at war?

303
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,066
Well, it's not uncommon

304
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:22,614
for PTSD victims

305
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:25,356
to respond to a trigger of some sort.

306
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,470
I've read accounts

307
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:29,516
of Buffalo Creek survivors

308
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:31,315
where they became hysterical

309
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,883
at the mere sound of raindrops
on a tin roof.

310
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:36,244
You think Werth has a trigger, Ducky?

311
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:38,016
I think you should be careful.

312
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:43,075
McGee, David...

313
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:44,934
Perimeter.

314
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,676
- It's Stone right there.
- <i>That's it, Nate.</i>

315
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,676
<i>Don't be afraid
to put all your weight on it.</i>

316
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:04,340
<i>It feels weird.</i>

317
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:06,615
<i>It'll feel less weird
once you get used to it.</i>

318
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:11,679
- PFC Stone?
- Yes, sir.

319
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,575
- Call me when you're done.
- Thanks, Karen.

320
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:16,862
You heard from Corporal Werth?

321
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,839
Got him in a brig at Bethesda.

322
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:20,651
They won't even let me in to see him.

323
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,008
He broke out this morning.

324
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:23,916
Good.

325
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:25,312
He's not a prisoner.

326
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:27,297
Shouldn't be treated
that way in the first place.

327
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:28,485
He may try to find you.

328
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:29,555
Hope he does.

329
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,258
He saved my life.

330
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,777
I'd give it right back
to him if he need it.

331
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:35,749
'Cause of him,

332
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:38,105
I might even be able
to return to combat.

333
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,581
You do that, Devil Dog.

334
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:45,827
Corporal Werth doesn't realize

335
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:47,185
that he ever left.

336
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:50,068
He thinks you're in trouble.

337
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:51,757
Corporal wouldn't hurt me.

338
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:52,994
Yeah, but would he hurt

339
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:54,555
someone else if they got in his way?

340
00:14:57,573 --> 00:14:58,805
What do you want from me?

341
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:01,677
<i>Well, let's see what we've got here.</i>

342
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,699
Cameras on the north and south gates.

343
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,304
Possible point of entry
from the fire escape.

344
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:10,039
<i>That's odd.</i>

345
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:12,103
Dr. De La Casa.
I thought he was headed home.

346
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,486
Why would he come here?

347
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:14,609
He didn't.

348
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:16,042
Werth has his badge.

349
00:15:19,473 --> 00:15:20,283
Gibbs,

350
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:21,452
Werth is here.

351
00:15:25,713 --> 00:15:26,713
I know.

352
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,242
Drop your weapons!

353
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:42,102
Kick 'em away.

354
00:15:44,238 --> 00:15:45,783
You don't want to do this, Corporal.

355
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:47,607
Nate, come on,
we're getting out of here.

356
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,803
I'm okay, Corporal.

357
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:50,311
I'm safe.

358
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,556
Stop moving.

359
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,845
We're not.

360
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:54,939
The other two!

361
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:58,732
PFC Stone, get up now! That's an order!

362
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:06,216
Your leg.

363
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,268
Left it in the desert.

364
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:11,461
Remember?

365
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,518
You carried me out on your back.

366
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:18,750
<i>Corporal, you're safe now.</i>

367
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:20,526
You and your men, you rescued them.

368
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,715
We're here to help you.

369
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:23,354
<i>Trust him, Damon.</i>

370
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:24,935
He's a grunt.

371
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,990
He's one of us?

372
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:30,960
We have to take you into custody.

373
00:16:31,983 --> 00:16:33,159
You understand that?

374
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,572
Put it down.

375
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:45,855
McGee, back off!

376
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:48,193
Boss...

377
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,225
<i>Damon, don't do it!</i>

378
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:55,147
<i>Damon!</i>

379
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:58,559
- No, don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!
- Sit down!

380
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:05,359
<i>Damon!</i>

381
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,434
Stay down!

382
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:27,548
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

383
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:33,441
Calm down!

384
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:35,950
Tony has a broken nose.
McGee has a dislocated shoulder.

385
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:37,789
But we caught the guy.

386
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:40,200
What is he even doing here?
He should be locked up.

387
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:42,521
- He's an animal.
- He's not an animal.

388
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:44,515
He's a man.

389
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,118
Are you defending him?

390
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:48,416
He attacked for no reason.

391
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:50,641
- The guy's a killing machine.
- He's a Marine.

392
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:53,537
Who was willing to give up everything
for his country.

393
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:55,805
We have a responsibility to him.

394
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,839
Oh, spare me the samurai code of honor.

395
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:01,546
Noble respect for your combatant,

396
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:04,906
it's admirable but he tried to kill Tony
and he tried to kill McGee.

397
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:08,775
And me, too.

398
00:18:09,078 --> 00:18:10,663
Believe me, we are fine.

399
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,077
Calm down.

400
00:18:15,818 --> 00:18:17,712
Ziva, can't you just let me get it out

401
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:18,891
for a second?

402
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:20,970
I mean, I'm not like you. I'm not some

403
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:23,338
totally emotionless perfect warrior.

404
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:24,661
God...

405
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,206
Agent Gibbs,
you've met Karen Sutherland.

406
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:33,407
Briefly.

407
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,405
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

408
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,239
How are your people?

409
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:39,468
They're busted up a little,
they'll be all right.

410
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:40,877
Ms. Sutherland

411
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:43,629
is a research and development
engineer at Biotech.

412
00:18:44,642 --> 00:18:45,857
Defense contract.

413
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:49,158
I specialize
in next-generation prosthesis

414
00:18:49,202 --> 00:18:50,431
designing, fitting,

415
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,616
modifications.

416
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:54,031
Lot of business lately.

417
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:56,220
Too much, unfortunately.

418
00:18:57,122 --> 00:19:00,363
But we're trying to create something
positive out of all the loss.

419
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:03,699
Have you seen your share
of traumatized warriors?

420
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:07,072
<i>I'm sure, 30 years ago,
most of the returning </i>

421
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:09,533
vets you work with would have died
in the field.

422
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:12,669
Well, broken bodies are easier to heal
than broken minds.

423
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:15,617
My company also develops
alternative therapies

424
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,565
to treat the psychological conditions.

425
00:19:17,843 --> 00:19:20,332
Competition for DARPA funding
must be intense.

426
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:21,351
If I may,

427
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,551
what's going to happen to Corporal Werth

428
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:25,213
now that he's in your custody?

429
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:28,872
Why exactly do you want to know?

430
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,291
Personal curiosity.

431
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:33,288
<i>It seems a great many people</i>

432
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:35,489
are interested in Werth's well-being.

433
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:38,729
I've had several calls
from Senator Hawkins' office,

434
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,880
about a Silver Star presentation.

435
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,090
Werth abducted a Navy medical officer,

436
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:44,665
assaulted Federal agents.

437
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:46,223
But you don't intend to charge him.

438
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,600
He was not in his right mind.

439
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:49,878
Then he should probably
go back to the shrinks.

440
00:19:49,946 --> 00:19:52,165
For all the good it did
the first time around.

441
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,647
What would you have us do with him,
Ms. Sutherland?

442
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:01,910
Well, that's not my place.

443
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:05,098
I just witnessed his incident.
It was frightening.

444
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:07,141
I'm concerned.

445
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:10,822
We all are.

446
00:20:11,664 --> 00:20:14,584
What do you intend to do
with Corporal Werth, Agent Gibbs?

447
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,276
Talk to him...

448
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:19,573
Marine to Marine.

449
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,456
Why didn't you have
that looked at in the ER?

450
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:36,845
I am fine.

451
00:20:37,892 --> 00:20:39,490
You shouldn't be embarrassed.

452
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,586
Invincibility is not
a human characteristic.

453
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:45,817
Gibbs is going to interrogate him?

454
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:48,473
Yes. I'm sure
that Gunnery Sergeant Gibbs

455
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:50,463
has a notion of how to get through to

456
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:53,051
Corporal Werth's troubled mind.

457
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,788
You got yourself in a mess, Corporal.

458
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,425
Gonna have to get yourself out.

459
00:21:11,513 --> 00:21:13,218
What seems to be the problem?

460
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,972
What seems to be the problem, Marine?!

461
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:18,510
I want to kill someone, sir!

462
00:21:18,598 --> 00:21:19,931
Anyone in particular?

463
00:21:20,135 --> 00:21:21,536
Anyone will do, sir.

464
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:26,162
Does that feel right to you, son?

465
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:30,527
No, sir.

466
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:32,356
It does not.

467
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,677
I'm not right, sir.

468
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:38,188
But it's not my fault.

469
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:42,223
Tell me what it feels like.

470
00:21:45,644 --> 00:21:46,876
Needles and pills.

471
00:21:47,244 --> 00:21:48,375
Needles and pins?

472
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:50,845
No, sir. Needles and pills.

473
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:54,630
They put a cloud in my head.

474
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:59,320
It's dark behind my eyes.
I can't see in there.

475
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:01,945
Who drugged you?

476
00:22:05,764 --> 00:22:06,932
I don't know.

477
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:10,436
I can't find it. I can't...

478
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:12,608
remember.

479
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:17,442
You got to help me.

480
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:20,677
At ease, son.

481
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,109
I will.

482
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,619
His symptoms are in no way exclusive

483
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,167
to post-traumatic stress.

484
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:39,464
You believe him?

485
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:42,002
Irritability, delusion, hostility...

486
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:46,312
All of these could be an adverse
reaction to any number of medications.

487
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:48,411
And in his field evaluation,

488
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:50,740
I find references to anxiety,

489
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:53,266
paranoia,
and they all predate his capture.

490
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:54,409
Too long in Iraq?

491
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,673
I do not get the impression
he suffered in the field.

492
00:22:56,823 --> 00:22:59,356
Yes. That does seem
to be his natural habitat.

493
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:01,628
Look, you have established a rapport.

494
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,418
Perhaps you could convince him

495
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:05,670
to part with urine and blood samples.

496
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:07,455
<i>I made a promise to this Marine.</i>

497
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,667
Plan to keep it.

498
00:23:10,814 --> 00:23:12,789
So, I guess he's a liar, too.

499
00:23:13,154 --> 00:23:16,302
Other than low concentrations
of sedatives and anti-depressants,

500
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:18,023
his blood was clean of drugs.

501
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:20,517
Well, the results of Werth's urinalysis

502
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,381
should confirm that then.

503
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:24,476
I can't just turn off

504
00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:27,727
one part of my head right now
and turn on the other part.

505
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:31,183
You know what?

506
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,782
I don't even care.

507
00:23:35,593 --> 00:23:37,163
I need you to draw

508
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:40,148
upon that considerable capacity
that you have for

509
00:23:40,163 --> 00:23:42,279
empathy, for a moment.

510
00:23:42,358 --> 00:23:43,766
I don't want to help him.

511
00:23:44,032 --> 00:23:45,712
This young man you deem

512
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:48,471
to be a villain may,
in fact, be a victim.

513
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:55,562
What are we looking for?

514
00:23:55,944 --> 00:23:59,036
Probenecid, spironolactone, furosemide

515
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,624
and any other uricosurics
and diuretics.

516
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:04,508
Masking agents.

517
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,175
Look at me.

518
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:15,616
Like Jack Nicholson

519
00:24:16,312 --> 00:24:17,354
in <i>Chinatown</i>.

520
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Stupid can!

521
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:28,999
<i>You know what happened to the kitty cat
who got too curious?</i>

522
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,617
<i>Don't make me break out my Jack,</i>

523
00:24:32,812 --> 00:24:33,911
<i>'cause I will.</i>

524
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:38,432
Straw?

525
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:40,162
No, I'm good.
I got the one arm.

526
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:42,214
- Thank you.
- Maybe it was you, McGee.

527
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:44,300
The one-armed man?

528
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:47,646
Thought it was
one of those vets we met

529
00:24:48,104 --> 00:24:49,431
at the Walter Reed Hospital.

530
00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:51,609
Wrong case, Tony.

531
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:53,939
We even have a case?

532
00:24:54,297 --> 00:24:55,663
We already got the guy.

533
00:24:56,346 --> 00:24:57,483
What are we doing?

534
00:24:57,923 --> 00:24:59,098
What did we miss?

535
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:02,046
What's happening?

536
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:05,039
They gave him painkillers.

537
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:07,744
My fingers are finging.

538
00:25:10,295 --> 00:25:11,313
You hear that?

539
00:25:13,242 --> 00:25:14,863
Excellent work, Agent Gibbs.

540
00:25:15,423 --> 00:25:18,123
- You'll be receiving a commendation...
- Where is he?

541
00:25:18,671 --> 00:25:20,001
Orders from SecNav.

542
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:22,294
Werth is being transferred
back to Bethesda.

543
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:23,900
The doctor will see to him.

544
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,046
Make sure he's presentable
for your photo-op?

545
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:28,188
The man is entitled to his medal.

546
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:31,537
All you care about is selling the war.

547
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:33,533
You don't support the war?

548
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:37,428
I support the men fighting it.

549
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:46,030
A complex series of masking agents
hampered detection,

550
00:25:46,242 --> 00:25:49,888
but we've managed to find
Oxymetholone stacked with Nandrolone.

551
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:53,728
In addition, countless other compounds
that we have yet to identify.

552
00:25:54,765 --> 00:25:56,463
Anabolic steroids.

553
00:25:57,114 --> 00:25:58,173
Steroids?

554
00:25:58,776 --> 00:26:02,133
Well, testosterone levels far beyond
even the most reckless of bodybuilders.

555
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:05,529
The science at work here
is very advanced,

556
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:08,244
with every indication
that it's been going on for years.

557
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:10,778
Werth's behavior is likely the result

558
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:13,390
of steroid-induced psychosis.

559
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:20,357
Someone is using that Marine
as a lab rat.

560
00:26:26,482 --> 00:26:28,182
Abby's mapping Werth's blood work.

561
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:30,407
Already found a bunch of steroids,
well covered.

562
00:26:30,635 --> 00:26:32,988
Would have been masked
from standard drug testing.

563
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,785
Drug testing's big bucks, McGiggle.

564
00:26:35,786 --> 00:26:38,930
NFL, NBA, Major League Baseball...
They all face the same problem.

565
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:40,561
Don't forget the <i>Tour de France</i>.

566
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:42,836
How could I?
Those short little shorts.

567
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:45,306
He could have been injected
his entire career. Werth is not

568
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:47,091
just a Marine
with post-traumatic stress.

569
00:26:47,234 --> 00:26:49,434
Someone has tried to create
a super-soldier.

570
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,664
He's in a hospital bed.

571
00:26:52,582 --> 00:26:53,412
Weak.

572
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:56,245
19 years old.
He's just been rejected by the Corps.

573
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:58,154
His dream of becoming a Marine

574
00:26:58,494 --> 00:26:59,630
over before it starts.

575
00:26:59,772 --> 00:27:02,305
Because he's Four F,
has an anemic blood disorder.

576
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:06,099
Three years later, he's ripping through
boot camp. Attending physician 

577
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,406
calls the improvement
in his blood-cell count miraculous.

578
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:10,452
It's not a miracle, it's an experiment.

579
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,627
Someone turned Damon Werth
into <i>Captain America</i>.

580
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:15,970
Werth's Swiss cheese brain
means he can't name the mad scientist.

581
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,935
Any chance the attending
was Dr. De la Casa?

582
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,102
No such luck.
As far as I can tell, they didn't

583
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:22,637
<i>cross paths till a couple weeks ago.</i>

584
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:23,481
Then who?

585
00:27:23,577 --> 00:27:25,603
Who would benefit
from an experiment like this?

586
00:27:25,795 --> 00:27:27,605
Well, there's big money
in pharmaceuticals.

587
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:29,165
<i>What?</i>

588
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,183
Find out what kind of research
the Biotech corporation does,

589
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,784
and everything on Karen Sutherland.

590
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:35,588
- DiNozzo.
- Yeah, boss.

591
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:36,616
You're with me.

592
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:40,706
The pursuit of juicy
government contracts spurs a lot of R&D.

593
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:43,348
Yeah, it runs the gamut from pills
that will keep a person

594
00:27:43,386 --> 00:27:45,371
awake for days at a time to

595
00:27:45,682 --> 00:27:48,406
biomechanical exoskeletons to...

596
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:50,298
nanoparticle technology.

597
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:52,421
A hell of a company.

598
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:55,471
I feel like <i>James Bond</i>
walking into Q's laboratory.

599
00:27:55,956 --> 00:27:59,101
Well, DARPA's money did pay
for night vision, lasers and stealth.

600
00:27:59,505 --> 00:28:00,545
And the Internet.

601
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:02,920
<i>That's a light-emitting diode.</i>

602
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:04,672
It speeds the healing process.

603
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:09,032
Might help the damaged cartilage
in your nose, Agent DiNozzo.

604
00:28:09,444 --> 00:28:11,084
Your company builds super-soldiers.

605
00:28:11,695 --> 00:28:14,242
Not a term we use in-house, Agent Gibbs.

606
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,689
Connotes killing power.

607
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:18,810
Our mission is to increase human
effectiveness,

608
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,539
durability and longevity.

609
00:28:20,976 --> 00:28:22,542
What point in the development process

610
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:24,491
do you begin field testing
on human subjects?

611
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:26,516
We're subject to government oversight.

612
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:27,949
<i>That's too bad.</i>

613
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:29,532
<i>All these cool toys,</i>

614
00:28:29,652 --> 00:28:31,775
and someone else tells you
how to play with 'em.

615
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:34,941
Can I ask you a question?
You ever jump the gun a bit with the...

616
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:36,851
magic pills?
Cut through the red tape?

617
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:37,948
Work out the kinks?

618
00:28:38,721 --> 00:28:39,725
In-house?

619
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,132
Corporal Werth.

620
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:44,631
His condition is pharmaceutically-based.

621
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:46,137
Steroids.

622
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:48,687
I appreciate you've taken
a special interest in his case.

623
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:49,999
And you, too.

624
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,475
He's highly decorated.

625
00:28:53,073 --> 00:28:54,273
You're highly decorated.

626
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:55,636
Silver Star?

627
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,392
That's a lot in common.

628
00:28:58,568 --> 00:28:59,814
You've done your research.

629
00:29:01,526 --> 00:29:02,884
That's the word on my door.

630
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,623
Well, he is a Marine, and you're an...

631
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:09,554
- ex-Marine.
- No such thing as ex-Marines.

632
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:12,807
Put our lives in each other's hands.

633
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,437
Accept that you're part
of something greater.

634
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,447
That sounds like a religion.

635
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:20,949
More a faith.

636
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:25,926
Well, steroids are extremely hazardous.

637
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,288
Carry many health risks.

638
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:31,585
I wish I could help you,
Agent Gibbs, but...

639
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:35,792
our company does not conduct

640
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:38,659
dangerous experiments
on human test subjects.

641
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:46,378
In case you were wondering,
he doesn't care about the medals.

642
00:29:46,415 --> 00:29:47,592
I keep his in a drawer.

643
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,138
<i>She's lying.</i>

644
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:53,950
Of course she is.

645
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,747
They do human testing on power drinks.
Why not Biotech?

646
00:29:56,823 --> 00:29:57,823
Abby, I really...

647
00:29:57,947 --> 00:30:00,347
I need my arm to access
these financial records.

648
00:30:01,763 --> 00:30:02,928
You have nothing to do?

649
00:30:03,622 --> 00:30:06,668
I created a blueprint
of all the compounds

650
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,618
that Werth was given.
If you can find me

651
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:12,510
an existing experiment, I can match it
and prove that he was their guinea pig.

652
00:30:12,565 --> 00:30:15,150
I need to get Biotech to open
their ultra-secret books.

653
00:30:15,455 --> 00:30:18,195
If there's anything you can do
that could get you off of me...

654
00:30:19,645 --> 00:30:21,497
I'm so glad you...

655
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:25,508
- smell like garbage.
- Yeah.

656
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,898
I know. I was going
through Karen Sutherland's trash.

657
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:31,489
- Find anything?
- She recycles

658
00:30:31,602 --> 00:30:32,644
and composts.

659
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:33,760
Who composts?

660
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:36,971
Those a pretty extreme lengths
to go to for this guy.

661
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:39,025
But...

662
00:30:39,448 --> 00:30:40,470
I understand now.

663
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:45,304
No true warrior should be felled
by invisible forces.

664
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:46,889
It's dishonorable.

665
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:54,248
And that other thing I said...

666
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,456
I know that's not really true.

667
00:30:59,822 --> 00:31:00,901
What does that mean?

668
00:31:01,814 --> 00:31:02,953
What she just said.

669
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,197
What other thing?

670
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:06,454
That I do not have feelings.

671
00:31:06,883 --> 00:31:07,950
I do have feelings,

672
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:10,333
though I do not express myself
the way Abby does.

673
00:31:10,728 --> 00:31:13,024
No one expresses themself
the way Abby does.

674
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:14,564
Themself?

675
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:15,609
Themselves?

676
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:16,921
Themself.

677
00:31:17,538 --> 00:31:20,749
What were you having feelings about?
You said you were having feelings?

678
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,133
I said I have feelings.

679
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:23,759
Not that I am having feelings.

680
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:27,085
That is a pretty sophisticated
grammatical differentiation.

681
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:29,898
Don't change the subject
with your big words, McNerd.

682
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:31,507
<i>Ziva said she had a feeling.</i>

683
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,511
Tell us about this feeling.

684
00:31:33,665 --> 00:31:34,821
What was this feeling?

685
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:36,657
I felt...

686
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:39,715
overwhelmed...

687
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,269
temporarily.

688
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:43,313
Which does not often happen to me,

689
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:46,262
when we were wrestling with Werth.

690
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,545
What?

691
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,159
What is this look?

692
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:52,649
<i>Nothing.</i>

693
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:55,083
You like him.

694
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:57,558
I thought he was powerful.

695
00:31:58,072 --> 00:31:59,170
You really like him.

696
00:31:59,171 --> 00:32:02,615
No, I am saying he is stronger
than any man I have encountered, but

697
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:05,376
strength should not decide a battle.

698
00:32:05,664 --> 00:32:07,267
There is a weapon for every fight.

699
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,971
- You itching for a rematch?
- Want to roll around on the ground

700
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:12,323
- with him some more?
- I am trying to describe something

701
00:32:12,754 --> 00:32:15,045
- complicated.
- It's not complicated, Ziva.

702
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:17,204
- It's <i>Conan</i>.
- To her <i>Red Sonja</i>?

703
00:32:17,205 --> 00:32:18,043
Nice.

704
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:19,764
It only lasted a moment.

705
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:21,729
You had a moment.

706
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:23,601
A moment and a feeling.

707
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:25,123
And a smack to the head.

708
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:28,293
Broken nose, dislocated shoulder.
It's been a banner day.

709
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:30,481
Easy on the painkillers, DiNozzo.

710
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:32,380
Director have any luck, boss?

711
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:34,559
Public affairs guy is stonewalling.

712
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:38,219
His main concern is keeping
Werth docile for the ceremony.

713
00:32:38,552 --> 00:32:40,384
They don't wanna know
how he got that way.

714
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:41,755
Or they know already.

715
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,135
What do we know?

716
00:32:43,765 --> 00:32:47,141
Looks like Karen Sutherland is
the bleeding heart she appears to be.

717
00:32:47,485 --> 00:32:49,742
Volunteer consultant
with Doctors Without Borders.

718
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,925
Donates to several charities
for the mentally disabled.

719
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,111
If she's got a fault,
it's that she cares too much.

720
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:57,708
Which is something
we might be able to exploit, boss.

721
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,091
I told you that information
is proprietary.

722
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:03,891
- I can't discuss it with you.
- Cutting-edge research.

723
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:06,906
Financial temptation
must be hard to resist.

724
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:10,731
You're wasting your time
if you think I'm selling secrets.

725
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:11,892
McGee.

726
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:15,279
You spent your summer traveling
through Africa with a team of doctors.

727
00:33:15,572 --> 00:33:17,271
You've been poking around my life?

728
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:18,996
Only fair.

729
00:33:19,243 --> 00:33:22,697
This report from the World Health
Organization features several children

730
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:24,752
<i>who received treatment
for land mine injuries.</i>

731
00:33:24,997 --> 00:33:26,888
Called their rapid healing "miraculous."

732
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,105
I hear "miracle,"

733
00:33:28,282 --> 00:33:29,343
I look for answers.

734
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,127
Can't just take it on faith, huh?

735
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:33,134
You didn't sell any secrets.

736
00:33:33,828 --> 00:33:35,198
You gave them away for free.

737
00:33:35,526 --> 00:33:36,995
Your heart's in the right place.

738
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:39,010
Your LED device is low-cost,

739
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,674
highly effective,
but it is corporate property.

740
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,342
The super-soldier program.

741
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:51,555
If anything on this comes back to me,

742
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:53,754
my career is over.

743
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:57,918
Hope it answers all your questions.

744
00:34:00,795 --> 00:34:02,496
You could've just asked nicely.

745
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,326
This is nicely.

746
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:10,494
Platelet acceleration,

747
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:13,563
human growth hormone
and cybernetic implants.

748
00:34:13,947 --> 00:34:16,895
These people have read
way too many sci-fi comics.

749
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:19,779
Some of these experiments
are more "fi" than "sci."

750
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,649
One of 'em makes people
glow in the dark.

751
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:22,734
What do we got?

752
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:25,877
- A couple of surprises.
- Good or bad?

753
00:34:26,884 --> 00:34:31,008
Would it surprise you to learn
that Karen Sutherland has reviewed

754
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,544
every single human research project
at her company since you met with her?

755
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:36,667
Time stamps on the files
she downloaded.

756
00:34:36,896 --> 00:34:38,728
Worried her company
might be responsible.

757
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:40,941
- Are they?
- For a lot of questionable experiments,

758
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:42,602
definitely.
But as far as our guy...

759
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:46,306
This is the map I compiled
of all the chemical compounds

760
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,015
that are running through Werth's blood.

761
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:51,614
This is a blueprint
of the chemical compounds

762
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,889
<i>the Biotech Corporation
is experimenting with.</i>

763
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,140
None of them match.

764
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:57,436
Werth's not their test subject.

765
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:00,047
Sutherland'll be relieved.
She's not responsible.

766
00:35:01,445 --> 00:35:02,659
Someone else is.

767
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:12,359
The Director managed to get a list
of every super-soldier proposal

768
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:14,909
- competing for funding from DARPA.
- None involved steroids.

769
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,947
Whatever's been done to Werth was...

770
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,770
somebody's pet project,
but they didn't leave a trail.

771
00:35:19,771 --> 00:35:21,944
He's the only evidence the experiment
ever took place.

772
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:23,442
The only one who knows who did it.

773
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:24,566
If he could remember.

774
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,254
So if the experiment went wrong,

775
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:29,705
and Werth's behavior over the past
several days would suggest it has,

776
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:31,240
then if he does remember...

777
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,382
He's in danger.

778
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,096
We need to protect him.

779
00:35:36,316 --> 00:35:38,129
All that's standing
in our way is a senator

780
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:40,277
and the entire military medical complex.

781
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:41,877
I'm sure they'll be happy to see us.

782
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,223
Nothing, sir.
I'm losing you...

783
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,928
Sunspots, X-rays, tunnel.

784
00:35:47,004 --> 00:35:49,256
Agent Gibbs, you and your team
are not welcome here.

785
00:35:49,257 --> 00:35:51,593
You are not to interfere
with Corporal Werth's treatment.

786
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:53,105
I'll have you forcibly removed!

787
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:55,720
Sorry about that.
Clumsy.

788
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:58,561
- Not supposed to use in a hospital.
- Especially my hospital.

789
00:36:04,649 --> 00:36:06,159
Corporal Werth is safe here.

790
00:36:06,444 --> 00:36:07,877
Except perhaps from himself.

791
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,432
You'll excuse us if we don't take you
at your word.

792
00:36:10,488 --> 00:36:13,381
Look, I'm taking every measure
to rectify past mistakes.

793
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:16,450
I'm ashamed to admit
I missed a diagnosis.

794
00:36:16,587 --> 00:36:18,432
You verified Dr. Mallard's findings.

795
00:36:18,824 --> 00:36:20,539
Werth is on a rapid detox program

796
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:23,540
which should flush his system
of the steroids in three to five days.

797
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,614
There a reason we had to do
all your work for you?

798
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:30,255
We try our best, but we can't keep up
with the numbers.

799
00:36:30,744 --> 00:36:33,888
We don't have the time or the facilities
to extend that type of attention

800
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:36,242
to every patient who presents with PTSD.

801
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:38,046
I want to see him.

802
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:41,692
He's under heavy sedation.
He's fine.

803
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:44,390
No, she asked to see the patient.

804
00:36:45,354 --> 00:36:47,694
Probably not a good idea
to stand in her way.

805
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:54,614
<i>Geez.</i>

806
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:00,870
What, no funny movie reference?

807
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:03,006
It's not funny.

808
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,576
The IV contains clonazepam

809
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:08,161
- while his system clears itself.
- Can he speak?

810
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:09,936
He's somewhat clear when he's awake.

811
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:11,362
Is his mind returning?

812
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,205
I hope so.

813
00:37:13,987 --> 00:37:15,060
Corporal Werth?

814
00:37:15,993 --> 00:37:16,794
<i>Damon?</i>

815
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:22,698
- Where am I?
- Hospital.

816
00:37:26,992 --> 00:37:27,992
What's all this?

817
00:37:28,802 --> 00:37:30,974
- We're getting the steroids out of you.
- Steroids?

818
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:34,221
You remember?

819
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:35,508
Who did this to you?

820
00:37:39,617 --> 00:37:40,734
Who did this to me?

821
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:42,603
Damon?

822
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,112
<i>Damon?</i>

823
00:37:44,113 --> 00:37:46,177
- <i>Hey, Damon?</i>
- <i>Like I said, he's very weak.</i>

824
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:47,257
<I>Damon!</i>

825
00:37:49,943 --> 00:37:51,159
Wait... this isn't right.

826
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:53,431
- What's happening?
- The system's crashing.

827
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:54,501
It's set too high.

828
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:57,485
- What is that?
- Adrenaline.

829
00:37:57,906 --> 00:37:58,910
<I>Hold him down!</i>

830
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,270
Hold him! Hold him!

831
00:38:02,352 --> 00:38:03,355
Give it to him.

832
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,142
You're gonna be all right, Marine.

833
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,174
- She's pulling a <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.
- On an <i>Hulk</i>.

834
00:38:49,235 --> 00:38:51,249
- What just happened?
- <i>I don't understand this.</i>

835
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:54,262
His machine was cranked up
to the wrong level.

836
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:55,961
The sedative was poisoning him.

837
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:57,674
So you tried to kill him?

838
00:38:57,684 --> 00:39:00,279
Bury the evidence
of your little science experiment?

839
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:01,562
I don't understand this...

840
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:04,848
I set the rate,
wrote the orders clear as day.

841
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:08,199
Who carries out your orders?

842
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,686
<i>Jenkins!</i>

843
00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:14,172
Going down?

844
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:30,101
I said going down.

845
00:39:30,674 --> 00:39:32,043
You should probably stay down.

846
00:39:33,484 --> 00:39:34,734
That's a nice watch.

847
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,660
A little ostentatious for my tastes.

848
00:39:36,864 --> 00:39:38,233
Must've been hell to pay for.

849
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,028
Especially on an orderly's salary.

850
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,036
Found a loophole in the system.

851
00:39:44,297 --> 00:39:47,174
Doctors fill out orders.
You take the drugs from the pharmacy.

852
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:50,337
But occasionally, they don't make it
to their intended destination.

853
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:53,115
Yeah, you made quite a little business
out of that, haven't you?

854
00:39:54,836 --> 00:39:56,705
What is the street value of...

855
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:00,438
Nandrolone,
and Oxymetholone and Winstrol?

856
00:40:00,924 --> 00:40:02,674
You even know what these things do?

857
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:05,070
Liver, kidney disease,

858
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:06,249
sterility,

859
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:07,486
roid rage.

860
00:40:07,642 --> 00:40:08,670
This guy here...

861
00:40:10,984 --> 00:40:12,301
beat his wife half to death.

862
00:40:12,484 --> 00:40:13,920
At least three others are dead.

863
00:40:14,034 --> 00:40:15,597
They're all patients of yours.

864
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,446
They did that to themselves.

865
00:40:17,733 --> 00:40:20,955
Werth goes off the reservation,
the cops are circling the hospital.

866
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,474
And then someone

867
00:40:23,055 --> 00:40:24,541
amps his machine up to 11.

868
00:40:24,973 --> 00:40:26,946
I don't know what happened, all right?

869
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,599
These things can be unreliable
sometimes.

870
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:32,660
Didn't want Werth to start talking about
who was sticking the needle in him?

871
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:36,007
Listen, I didn't stick the needle
in any of those guys.

872
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,432
Who did?

873
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:47,199
I'm embarrassed by my behavior.

874
00:40:48,203 --> 00:40:50,691
It doesn't even feel
like me in my memory.

875
00:40:51,011 --> 00:40:52,940
We have determined the source
of the steroids,

876
00:40:53,924 --> 00:40:55,305
but not who did this to you.

877
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:56,796
You remember?

878
00:40:58,433 --> 00:41:00,632
- It hasn't come back yet.
- Disappointing.

879
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,449
Would have to be someone close to you,

880
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:04,533
someone who has been with you
wherever you go.

881
00:41:04,704 --> 00:41:07,418
- Perhaps someone in your unit.
- We have to investigate them.

882
00:41:10,447 --> 00:41:11,487
Unless...

883
00:41:11,913 --> 00:41:13,322
you remember who it is.

884
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:20,605
Courage doesn't have anything
to do with medals.

885
00:41:21,757 --> 00:41:22,792
It's simple.

886
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,507
You run to the gunfire,

887
00:41:26,216 --> 00:41:27,227
not away from it.

888
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:31,367
I don't know what I'd do, Gunny,

889
00:41:32,295 --> 00:41:33,935
if I couldn't be a Marine.

890
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,119
It's in my blood.

891
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:41,011
I can't imagine how it felt.

892
00:41:44,824 --> 00:41:46,657
When your own blood was keeping you out.

893
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:49,463
<i>The orderly was just
your most recent supplier.</i>

894
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,927
You gave yourself the steroids.

895
00:41:52,202 --> 00:41:53,686
And the masking agents,

896
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,347
so no one would ever find out.

897
00:41:56,571 --> 00:41:58,156
All so you could become some...

898
00:41:58,357 --> 00:41:59,357
super-Marine.

899
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:02,732
Just a Marine.

900
00:42:07,565 --> 00:42:09,166
That's it.
Ceremony's off.

901
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,916
- You're canceling it?
- Have to.

902
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:13,768
The senator can't step on stage
with that guy.

903
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:16,089
- He won't get the medal?
- That's up to the Marine Corps,

904
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,517
but I sincerely doubt it.

905
00:42:17,672 --> 00:42:19,522
He'll be lucky to be just discharged.

906
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:21,252
This is a nightmare.

907
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:24,421
Ray Vincent.

00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:28,721

909
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:30,282
<I>Great!</i>

910
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,547
