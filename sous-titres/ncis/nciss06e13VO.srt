2
00:00:02,417 --> 00:00:04,770
I wish I could stay
but I have to fly.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,934
Oh no!

4
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:08,901
That's terrible.
You actually said it.

5
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,265
I thought I was gonna ruin the moment
by saying the wrong thing.

6
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:13,682
What could you possibly say?

7
00:00:13,898 --> 00:00:16,849
I don't know.
Anything involving the word "layover".

8
00:00:18,706 --> 00:00:20,355
- Okay.
- Okay.

9
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:21,606
All right.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,845
I can't believe you did this to me.

11
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:40,757
I love you.

12
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,086
And you stabbed me in the back.

13
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:48,508
At least I looked you in the eyes.

14
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:52,336
Cheryl...

15
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:05,070
Is he okay?
Is he all right?

16
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,304
- He's been stabbed.
- Somebody call an ambulance!

What could it be for McGee?

22
00:01:42,064 --> 00:01:42,908
Cookies.

23
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:46,039
Those would have
to be some huge cookies.

24
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:47,611
Care package from home.

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,010
Winter clothes?

26
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,236
Mittens?

27
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:53,519
Too heavy.

28
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:57,386
I'm bored,
I don't want to play anymore.

29
00:01:57,572 --> 00:01:58,504
I don't care.

30
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:00,293
Well, I am opening it.

31
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:01,508
Thank God.

32
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:04,733
Oh, goody, they're here.

33
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:06,453
Goody? Who says goody?

34
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,041
What is it?

35
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:13,593
This is my Mac SE.

36
00:02:14,447 --> 00:02:16,324
Got it for my eleventh birthday.

37
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:17,684
She is my first.

38
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:20,391
This is going to get really strange,
isn't it?

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,710
Going to?

40
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,020
These are chapters of my life.

41
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:27,011
From the earliest discovery

42
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:29,686
to that palpable connection

43
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:34,280
and the eventual evolution.
Look at this.

44
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:36,866
Here I am making
the transition to PC.

45
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,262
I'll alert the Smithsonian.

46
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:42,066
Maybe they can make
a space for your exhibit...

47
00:02:42,126 --> 00:02:44,290
"The Chronicles of
a Teenage Shut-in."

48
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:46,947
- How do you remember your childhood?
- Vaguely.

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,149
You have no sense of history.

50
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:50,026
I do.

51
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:52,881
And so does Petty Officer Kevin Lim.

52
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:54,175
He's history?

53
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:55,774
Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,050
Let's go.

55
00:02:57,606 --> 00:02:58,703
Grab your mittens.

56
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:00,044
It's cold out there.

57
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:06,329
I forgot my passport, I came back,

58
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:08,993
and I saw that he was...

59
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:14,474
- You didn't see who did it?
- I didn't have to.

60
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:16,859
It was Cheryl,

61
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:20,617
his ex-fiancée.
The engagement was just broken off.

62
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:22,173
I need to take your statement.

63
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:23,579
- All right.
- Okay.

64
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:25,707
Here, let's go inside
for some privacy.

65
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,208
Boss, got an eyewitness
who saw a woman with blood on

66
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:30,545
- her hands headed around the corner.
- Not the stewardess.

67
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,652
Doesn't fit the flight
attendant's description.

68
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:34,465
The ex. Canvass.

69
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:38,136
The reason I missed I Street
is because I was expecting

70
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:40,430
to find I Street two blocks
past K Street.

71
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,936
It is a rare place in this world,
Mr. Palmer,

72
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:45,852
where reason is the best compass.

73
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,354
- Miss the turn?
- H, I, J, K.

74
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:51,233
That's how the alphabet works, right?
Goes the same forwards as backwards.

75
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:52,650
In Hebrew, there is no J.

76
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:57,280
Apart from the name of the food court
at George Washington University,

77
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,699
there is no J Street
in the District.

78
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,542
Perhaps that's where you've been
spending your time, Mr. Palmer,

79
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:04,206
instead of going to class.

80
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:06,834
I suppose that's further
evidence of my lesser education

81
00:04:06,894 --> 00:04:09,291
- that I did not know that.
- The fault lies not

82
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:11,336
with the institute of higher learning,
Mr. Palmer,

83
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:14,046
but with your observational skills.

84
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:16,382
In 1791, a Parisian,

85
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:19,510
Pierre Charles L'Enfant,
was commissioned

86
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:21,637
- to design a city plan.
- Okay, here we go.

87
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:23,181
The Capitol is at the center.

88
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:28,331
Four quadrants radiate northwest,
southwest, northeast, southeast.

89
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:32,320
The north-south streets are numbered,
the east-west streets are lettered.

90
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,233
When the alphabet is exhausted,
they go syllabically.

91
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:37,279
First, two syllables,
then, three syllables.

92
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:38,773
Macomb is followed by Newark...

93
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,275
And Albemarle is followed
by Brandywine.

94
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:42,502
I understand, Doctor.

95
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,577
I failed one class.

96
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:46,245
That doesn't make me a bad student.

97
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:48,206
So then, why is there no J Street?

98
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:51,531
Sorry.

99
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,286
<i>- 13th and L.</i>
- One block north, two blocks east.

100
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:56,472
<i>Need you here, Ziva.</i>

101
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:59,217
Thirteenth and L.
Be right there, Gibbs.

102
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:02,136
I will make up the class.

103
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:04,672
- Maintain the scene.
- Make it up to me right now.

104
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:07,833
Really?

105
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:08,911
Come on.

106
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,625
Got her!

107
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:25,994
Stand up!

108
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:27,912
Show me your hands!

109
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:34,643
Hands behind your back.

110
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:40,758
Upward angle of the trajectory
likely severed the abdominal aorta.

111
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:43,826
The shape indicates
a clockwise twisting.

112
00:05:44,138 --> 00:05:45,972
The assailant was
probably right-handed.

113
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:47,890
Refrain from conjecture.

114
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:51,978
Exsanguination lead to death.

115
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:54,094
Judging by the diameter
of the pooling,

116
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,857
I'd say he bled out within...
three minutes.

117
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,610
Cold surface expedites coagulation.

118
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:01,292
Perhaps four.

119
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:04,866
- Why is there no J Street?
- I just told you, I don't know.

120
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:08,519
And I just gave you
a clue to the answer.

121
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:13,708
We are discussing the construction
of the very streets

122
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,418
where democracy would stride freely.

123
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:17,912
Excuse me. Sorry.
That's a nice hat.

124
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:19,547
Excuse me. Sorry.

125
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:22,350
So, is that her?

126
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,972
Yeah, quickest case ever.

127
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:26,888
Yeah, sets a new record. Out of the way.
Nothing to see here, folks.

128
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,476
This was
the transformation of so much.

129
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:35,093
It was the bedrock
of the most lofty ideals.

130
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:37,510
These were not idle decisions,
Mr. Palmer.

131
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,283
Even in 1791...

132
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,378
Doctor, look out!
Look out!

133
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:44,666
Doctor!

134
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:51,338
Doctor!

135
00:06:51,993 --> 00:06:53,985
Stop her!
Stop her!

136
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:56,201
Hold her.
Got her. Got her.

137
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,172
That way! She's wearing a green scarf
covering her face!

138
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,803
Ducky...

139
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:18,898
Stay still, Duck.

140
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,529
I'm all right, Jethro.

141
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,111
It's just a...

142
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,157
defensive wound.

143
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:38,510
- Jimmy.
- Hi.

144
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:40,670
How is Ducky?

145
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,815
Multiple superficial lacerations,

146
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,341
plus the blade finally embedded
in the midpalmar space,

147
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,394
possibly damaging or even severing
flexor tendons and

148
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:53,393
lumbrical muscles. Best-case scenario
entails, weeks of physical therapy,

149
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,965
after reconstructive surgery.

150
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:57,853
He should be out
any second now, so...

151
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:00,242
So the short answer is,

152
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:01,774
he's alive.

153
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,728
What?

154
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:04,694
Yeah, yeah.

155
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:07,605
Because when you hear,
"Ducky got stabbed",

156
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:10,408
you don't necessarily take
that part for granted.

157
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:11,869
Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

158
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:13,444
It's okay.

159
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:14,856
You are very...

160
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,630
- calm.
- I am.

161
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:22,379
If I keep going to Crazytown
every time one of you gets hurt,

162
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:25,173
I'm gonna have to have
my mail forwarded.

163
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:29,552
Ducky.

164
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:30,991
Abby?

165
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:34,015
How kind of you to visit.

166
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:37,393
- They gave you morphine.
- Well, just a drop.

167
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:40,646
Duck, anything you remember
about the attack?

168
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,857
My, my glasses.

169
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:51,334
Sweetie, you held on to them
for me while I went under the knife.

170
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:55,299
It's ironic that the solution
to one knife should be...

171
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:59,368
Mr. Palmer, would... would you,
uh, finish that thought for me?

172
00:08:59,428 --> 00:09:00,356
Sure, Doctor.

173
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:04,510
And you need to send
for a substitute M.E.

174
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,086
- Jordan...?
- Dr. Hampton?

175
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:11,469
On my desk you'll find her number,

176
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:14,944
while I myself lay here
getting much numb... er.

177
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:17,600
Nurse, more anesthetic!

178
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,519
And don't spare the horses.

179
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:24,990
Okay, he's zonked out of his gourd,
and he's still playing with words.

180
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:26,359
Impressive.

181
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:28,861
Abs... weapon, prints.

182
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:31,822
How am I supposed to log this?

183
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,674
Because technically,

184
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:35,993
it's the weapon of interest
in two separate cases.

185
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:40,183
I'll figure it out.

186
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:54,442
One of the residents captured
the actual attack on their camera phone?

187
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:56,816
Neighbors seem
to think a crime scene

188
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:59,835
makes better watching
than daytime television.

189
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:01,476
Quality isn't great.

190
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:05,091
Let me see
if I can clean this up a bit.

191
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:08,383
<i>Doctor?</i>

192
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:10,278
<i>Stop her. Stop her!</i>

193
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:18,828
She's what,
approximately five foot three?

194
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:22,137
Mid to late thirties.
She's wearing a hijab.

195
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,666
Likely Muslim.

196
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:25,251
All right, this should do it.

197
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:36,971
Sounds like Pashto or Dari.

198
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:40,016
Might be a regional Afghani dialect.

199
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,828
We can get a linguist on it.

200
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,937
So... you're dead.

201
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:46,494
Sorry about that.

202
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:51,207
Poor... fellow.

203
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,973
You know, if it's any consolation,

204
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,841
all indications are
that you went out...

205
00:10:58,195 --> 00:10:59,530
with a bang.

206
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:02,747
Forget it.

207
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,942
- Dr. Hampton.
- Jim.

208
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,668
You prefer Jimmy.

209
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:13,465
Jim Palmer was
a pitcher for the Orioles.

210
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,342
I was named after him, but...

211
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,445
I have never really liked baseball.

212
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:19,883
Noted.

213
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:22,058
Well, please,
you may call me Jordan.

214
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,979
I was named after a body of water
towards which I bear no ill will.

215
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:31,150
Why would Dr. Mallard need a last minute
fill-in? It seems very unlike him.

216
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:33,736
Oh, he was assaulted
at a crime scene.

217
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,447
He'll be okay.
His hand was injured.

218
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:41,907
Scary.

219
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:45,039
I suppose we can be
his hands for today.

220
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:48,834
The facts of this case
are pretty cut-and-dry.

221
00:11:57,232 --> 00:11:58,052
You okay?

222
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,970
Yes, fine.

223
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:03,040
Let's get started.

224
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:04,885
Thank you.

225
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,687
Talk to me, baby, talk to me.

226
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:10,090
Fingerprint sheet.

227
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,566
I was, I was talking to the knife.

228
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:14,258
- You want to talk knives?
- Always.

229
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,988
What we have here is
a SliceCo chef knife.

230
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:21,450
It's a standard part of the 12-piece
introductory counter block kitchen set.

231
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,716
It's laser-beveled titanium
steel rust-resistant blade,

232
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:27,790
and the tang extends the full length
of the engineered thermo-resin handle,

233
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,293
which will not crack, chip,
fade or absorb any material.

234
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:33,666
It will, however,

235
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:36,257
retain a print on a bloody smear.

236
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,168
Or in this case, many prints.

237
00:12:39,214 --> 00:12:40,264
Summer job?

238
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:42,471
Yeah, telemarketing, sophomore year.

239
00:12:43,152 --> 00:12:46,517
It helps if you believe in the products.
These are actually really good knives.

240
00:12:46,988 --> 00:12:49,207
The handle has been handled
by many hands,

241
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:52,398
so it's going to take some hunting
and pecking to isolate Ducky's attacker.

242
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,089
What about the hijab?

243
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,914
I pulled some hair from it.

244
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,863
The fabric is quite old, handmade.

245
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,698
So it fell off
when you were chasing her?

246
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:02,061
Unlikely.

247
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:04,376
It is designed to always stay on
as a sign of modesty.

248
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:06,579
She would not just lose it
by accident.

249
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,862
She was trying to disappear
in plain sight.

250
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,964
<i>Ziva, hey.
The linguist has a translation.</i>

251
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:19,654
On my way.

252
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,680
Are you sure this is right?

253
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:26,307
That's what she said, boss.

254
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,173
Three decades ago,

255
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:37,977
in my RAMC days,

256
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:40,988
I was seconded
to an American tank regiment.

257
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:46,202
Hand injuries were prevalent
in the Armored Cavalry.

258
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:48,298
As a result,

259
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:52,458
I considered making
hand surgery my specialty.

260
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:56,471
Fortunately, I opted for a...

261
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:59,340
less-sensitive clientele.

262
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:03,570
Otherwise,
this might spell an end to my career.

263
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,724
<i>Subab...</i>

264
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:11,855
<i>ann muredaha toostee.</i>

265
00:14:14,222 --> 00:14:15,731
Dari.
Means...

266
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:18,095
"Bringer of death."

267
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:22,654
Picked up a few words,
did you, Duck?

268
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,405
Your old RAMC days in Afghanistan?

269
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:29,610
I don't want to talk about it.

270
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,081
Yeah, well,
the next phrase she yells means:

271
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:33,694
"You killed my brother."

272
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:41,831
Any idea
why she would have said that?

273
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:45,359
Perhaps because I killed
her brother.

274
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,532
We have found her, Gibbs.
The woman's name is Mosuma Daoub.

275
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:05,879
- Put her in interrogation.
- She's not actually here.

276
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,878
What Ziva says is
we've I.D.'d her fingerprint.

277
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:09,337
Throw it up, McGarnagle.

278
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,884
Mosuma Daoub... Afghani immigrant,
married to Ezmaray Daoub, two children.

279
00:15:14,944 --> 00:15:17,395
- That's their home address.
- According to her tax returns,

280
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:20,212
she works at a flower shop
in the neighborhood of the attack.

281
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:22,906
Her boss says she hasn't been seen
since yesterday morning.

282
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:26,194
She went out for coffee, stuck
a knife in Ducky, and never came back.

283
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:28,302
- Pick her up at home.
- She has not returned home.

284
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:31,098
According to her husband,
he doesn't know where she is.

285
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:32,349
Then bring him in here.

286
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:36,062
McGee, I want to ask you something.

287
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:40,024
The director's still
in budget allocation meetings?

288
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:43,382
- He's gone till the end of the week.
- Well, I need a personnel file.

289
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:45,070
It can't wait.

290
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:50,068
Well, I could access
that without disturbing the director.

291
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,284
Who?

292
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:53,000
Dr. Donald Mallard.

293
00:15:57,744 --> 00:16:00,108
Mr. Daoub,
you have not heard from your wife?

294
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:02,023
I leave her messages.

295
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,407
I call her friends.

296
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:07,676
I have been trying not
to panic the children, but

297
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:10,145
I was so nervous
when I dropped them at school...

298
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:14,284
I forgot to give them their lunches.

299
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:19,542
Can you identify your wife's hijab?

300
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:21,899
Hijab?

301
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:24,276
You mean her scarf.

302
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,363
We are not so traditional.
Where did you find it?

303
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:28,781
Near her work.

304
00:16:31,844 --> 00:16:34,766
What could have happened
that she would not call me back?

305
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:39,085
We will find out.

306
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:44,797
Cell records for Mosuma Daoub.

307
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,979
Any record of her
calling home since yesterday?

308
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:48,092
Negative.

309
00:16:48,612 --> 00:16:50,051
Mr. Mom's story checks out.

310
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,970
Only calls she made
were to the embassy.

311
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:53,263
Which embassy?

312
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:00,445
Afghanistan...

313
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,233
a country with a fascinating
and tumultuous history.

314
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,569
Ruled over the centuries by Kushans,

315
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,971
Mongols, Pushtans, Persians,

316
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:12,259
and a series of tribal leaders...

317
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:15,802
where succession was
often by assassination.

318
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:18,946
The Soviets tried
their hand for a while.

319
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,604
They were opposed by the mujahideen,

320
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:27,139
who naturally were
supported by U.S. and Britain,

321
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:30,300
and out of that mess
emerged the Taliban,

322
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:33,620
with their rigid interpretation...

323
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:35,139
of Islam.

324
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:37,863
It was they who finally destroyed

325
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,894
the ancient statues of Buddha
in the Bamiyan Valley.

326
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,393
I was with...

327
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:44,638
the Royal Army Medical Corps...

328
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:47,640
when a notice went up
in the officers' mess

329
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,046
asking for volunteers...

330
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,491
for a refugee camp
on the Pakistan border.

331
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:57,077
I was such a kid back then.

332
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:00,480
Full of ideology.

333
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,284
I wanted to go somewhere...

334
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:05,884
where I would do the most good,

335
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:08,005
where my skills
would be appreciated.

336
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:12,219
I was also rather entangled
with a possessive German female.

337
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:13,469
Olga.

338
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,221
Was an easy way to cut loose.

339
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:21,075
But of course you're too much of
a gentleman to speak of your old flame.

340
00:18:22,063 --> 00:18:25,225
Yes, well, right now,
I'm concerned in producing a new one.

341
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:26,690
I'll do it.

342
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,734
Thank you.
Most kind.

343
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:31,401
Oh, my!

344
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:34,968
There's a bird in the house.

345
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,794
Someday they're going to put a plaque on
this bench with both our names, Gibbs.

346
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:04,717
Mr. Kort.

347
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,497
Agency's keeping you local.

348
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:10,608
Travel is touchy at the moment.

349
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,155
I made a few enemies overseas.

350
00:19:16,153 --> 00:19:18,022
What, with your winning personality?

351
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:20,619
When you finally open
that charm school, let me know.

352
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:24,232
I need a favor.

353
00:19:26,903 --> 00:19:28,052
But Gibbs,

354
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:29,823
I don't like you.

355
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:32,356
That's okay,
I don't like you either.

356
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:34,781
Not trading on kindness.

357
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,559
But we are trading.

358
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:43,051
CIA aided the mujahideen resistance
against the Soviets.

359
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:44,504
The '80s?

360
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:48,604
I was running track at Oxford,
not covert missions.

361
00:19:49,865 --> 00:19:50,565
Dig.

362
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,259
Where?

363
00:19:54,308 --> 00:19:58,198
Jalozai Refugee Camp,
Pakistani border, summer 1980.

364
00:19:58,303 --> 00:19:59,558
Whatever you got.

365
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:02,724
This is going to cost you, Gibbs.

366
00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:13,552
You are the American NCIS agents?

367
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:15,424
I'm Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

368
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:16,918
Ziva David.

369
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,302
I am Qasim Saydia.

370
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,164
Got any idea what goes on around here,
Mr. Saydia?

371
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:24,882
- I believe that I do.
- Great.

372
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,312
It would be really helpful
if you knew about Mosuma Daoub.

373
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:32,482
Otherwise, I'm afraid
we'll have to speak to your superiors.

374
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:34,975
Yes, well,

375
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:38,322
that will require quite
a lengthy plane flight, Agent DiNozzo.

376
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,782
- Tony, he is the ambassador.
- I apologize.

377
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,535
So you know what goes on around here.
Where is she?

378
00:20:43,939 --> 00:20:45,871
Mosuma Daoub is in this building.

379
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:49,747
She stabbed a man
on an American street yesterday.

380
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:51,277
She explained this to me.

381
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:54,998
However, she is under the protection
of the government of Afghanistan

382
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,309
until we can...

383
00:20:56,836 --> 00:20:58,425
investigate these accusations.

384
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:01,398
Sir, since when has she been
under your protection?

385
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,372
We only just made these accusations.

386
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:06,314
I'm not referring
to the accusations against her,

387
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,062
rather, the accusations
she has made against your Dr. Mallard.

388
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:11,939
Excuse me?

389
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:14,983
She admitted that she lost control
of her senses for a moment,

390
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:18,236
when she recognized him,
but I can hardly blame her,

391
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:21,448
from what she has told me,
this man is a villain.

392
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:24,034
What exactly did she tell you?

393
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:30,208
That Dr. Mallard violated Article 4
of the Geneva Convention.

394
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:32,376
War crimes?

395
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:35,697
Ducky?

396
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:44,226
Article 4 of the Geneva Convention

397
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:46,858
prohibits the use of violence
against noncombatants.

398
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:49,085
Ducky's not a war criminal.

399
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,460
That woman is lying.

400
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,270
We won't know
the details until formal

401
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:54,312
charges are filed
with the State Department.

402
00:21:55,092 --> 00:21:56,375
Then everyone will know.

403
00:21:56,435 --> 00:21:58,564
Ambassador Saydia
said it involved events that

404
00:21:58,624 --> 00:22:01,239
took place
at Jalozai Refugee Camp almost...

405
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:02,446
30 years ago.

406
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:05,890
Which would make Mosuma Daoub
like eight years old at the time.

407
00:22:06,247 --> 00:22:08,412
So, this woman is walking down
the street,

408
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,206
minding her own business,
sees Ducky,

409
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:13,616
someone she hasn't seen
since she was a little girl,

410
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:16,439
and is suddenly overcome
with the urge to stick a knife in him?

411
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:17,691
She was hiding.

412
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:20,379
Her husband said she never wore
her hijab covering her face.

413
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,315
I mean, that shows premeditation.

414
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,251
Spitting distance
from the Navy Yard.

415
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:26,429
She could have known
Ducky would be there.

416
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,750
She's not so innocent.

417
00:22:28,652 --> 00:22:31,494
Okay, let's figure out how and
when Mosuma could have seen Ducky

418
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:34,237
in the neighborhood and
how she'd know he'd be on the street.

419
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:36,148
Recanvass, reinterview, reexamine.

420
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,773
Why are you talking so fast?

421
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,491
Want to get a plan of attack, 'cause
according to my internal Gibbs clock,

422
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:42,404
he's about to walk
through that door right...

423
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,173
now.

424
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:49,292
Now.

425
00:22:57,727 --> 00:22:59,059
Somebody's clock is off.

426
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,762
Hope Dr. Mallard knows
how good a friend you are to him.

427
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:09,639
Two-way street, Trent.

428
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:13,036
I don't think they ever clean anything
out of the archives at Langley.

429
00:23:14,207 --> 00:23:16,448
I had to go through
100 boxes to find that.

430
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:21,994
An old instructor...

431
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:23,664
not one of my favorites...

432
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:25,738
was at the Jalozai camp.

433
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:29,014
I opted not to call
in a favor of my own.

434
00:23:29,562 --> 00:23:31,870
Prefer to stockpile
those for a rainy day.

435
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:34,873
I'm good for it.

436
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:35,954
No doubt.

437
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:40,056
Can't help but notice these same ends
could have been reached

438
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:42,004
with one call
from your director to mine.

439
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:46,218
Creates an official trail,
of course.

440
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,471
You preferred
the back-channel approach.

441
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,419
In the hope of continuing goodwill,

442
00:23:54,858 --> 00:23:57,479
this second one is on the house.

443
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,467
You really should learn
to polish the brass.

444
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,727
Did you lock yourself out?

445
00:24:42,705 --> 00:24:44,424
Were you expecting somebody else?

446
00:24:45,144 --> 00:24:46,664
Good to see you up and around.

447
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:48,544
What you got in the box, Duck?

448
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:50,016
A dead starling.

449
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:54,431
According to superstition,
when a bird flies in a house,

450
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:56,788
it means that someone
who lives there is about to die.

451
00:24:57,018 --> 00:24:58,361
I was worried.

452
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,789
Mother has moved out. I thought
the augury might apply to me.

453
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:04,626
Yeah?
How is she doing?

454
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,376
The bad days far outnumber the good.

455
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:10,070
The scientist in me knows

456
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,638
that Alzheimer is a deterioration,
progressively, of brain cells,

457
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:15,942
but the philosopher...

458
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:19,147
wonders whether it isn't
the soul's violent attempt

459
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:23,074
to eliminate painful memories
of a life fraught with contradiction.

460
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:26,134
Yeah.
Brain can do that.

461
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:30,258
I mean, the bird was here,
where it didn't belong.

462
00:25:30,318 --> 00:25:33,154
Instead of flying south,
it came in here for warmth.

463
00:25:33,777 --> 00:25:35,576
Alighted on that chair.

464
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:38,747
It didn't move
when the dogs closed in.

465
00:25:39,326 --> 00:25:41,332
It happened all so slowly.

466
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:43,293
The eldest one, Cooper,

467
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:46,963
he opened his mouth, and he grabbed it.
I yelled and the bird fell on the floor.

468
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:48,461
Poor thing.

469
00:25:48,987 --> 00:25:52,139
I did so wish
that it might still be alive.

470
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:56,387
I suppose the omen applied
to the bird itself.

471
00:25:57,365 --> 00:26:00,644
You've been told about the possibility
of a war crimes tribunal in the Hague?

472
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:05,961
Yeah, I had a phone conversation
with Ambassador Saydia.

473
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,292
Netherlands are lovely.

474
00:26:08,352 --> 00:26:09,736
Windmills are all frozen.

475
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:12,656
- Tulips are all dead.
- Not dead: dormant.

476
00:26:13,951 --> 00:26:15,203
You're not going, Duck.

477
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:18,119
What have you brought?

478
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:21,331
CIA footage taken in Jalozai.

479
00:26:23,437 --> 00:26:25,768
Such devastation in that camp.
Such...

480
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,171
suffering and pain.

481
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:30,757
Checked this out of your local library,
did you?

482
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:32,624
Pulled a few strings.

483
00:26:33,664 --> 00:26:37,114
I thought I might save lives
flung there by the maelstrom.

484
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:41,313
I could sooner pluck a grain
of sand from a sirocco.

485
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:45,647
You...

486
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:48,149
you got a sheet anywhere?

487
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:50,093
What?

488
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:52,581
"A calm and responsible person."

489
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:54,648
All her coworkers
say the same thing.

490
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,284
Until she saw Ducky yesterday.

491
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,298
We can change our perspective,
but it doesn't change what happened.

492
00:27:00,358 --> 00:27:03,352
If you were a dork in high school,
you'll always be a dork in high school.

493
00:27:03,412 --> 00:27:05,146
That's not
why I wanted my computers.

494
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,332
I'm not trying to rewrite
my life story.

495
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,471
Did you read something personal into
what I just said? McGee, I don't follow.

496
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,598
There's nothing new to learn there.

497
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:16,136
There has to be.

498
00:27:16,516 --> 00:27:17,216
Why?

499
00:27:17,456 --> 00:27:19,639
The alternative is
that Ducky was Dr. Mengele.

500
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:36,245
That's not her brother.

501
00:27:36,646 --> 00:27:38,704
I will know his face when I see it.

502
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:40,720
His name was Javid.

503
00:27:41,137 --> 00:27:43,085
He came to me with lacerations.

504
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:45,648
It looked as if he'd survived
a knife fight.

505
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:47,147
I stitched him up,

506
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,128
but he returned,
the wounds reopened.

507
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:52,630
The guy conducting
the interrogation?

508
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:56,111
His official affiliation
was a mystery.

509
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:59,935
We first met when he came
to me for a physical checkup.

510
00:28:00,185 --> 00:28:03,074
Then we met socially
for a game of chess.

511
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,539
He suffered
from a rare congenital defect.

512
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:09,472
He himself could not feel pain.

513
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:11,369
Feels nothing.

514
00:28:12,105 --> 00:28:13,651
Specializing in torture.

515
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:17,759
If you can't feel anything, you don't
know when anything's gone wrong.

516
00:28:19,426 --> 00:28:21,767
A lot go wrong out there, Ducky?

517
00:28:23,098 --> 00:28:24,797
I was never in that room,

518
00:28:24,857 --> 00:28:28,096
but I became suspicious when Javid
came to me a third time.

519
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:30,148
I made inquiries...
I discovered that

520
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,402
my chess-playing companion was known
to everyone in the camp,

521
00:28:33,472 --> 00:28:36,174
except me, as "Mr. Pain".

522
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,926
That's him.

523
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:39,010
That's Javid.

524
00:28:40,264 --> 00:28:44,258
Poor boy insisted that he knew nothing
about troop movements or spies.

525
00:28:44,345 --> 00:28:46,937
Neither that nor any other force
could stop Mr. Pain from...

526
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:48,549
torturing him for days.

527
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:53,740
And... and... and each time,
he was sent back to me to be sewn up.

528
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:56,867
It was my first exposure

529
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,735
to that kind
of interrogation technique.

530
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:04,872
In the intervening years,
it has become dreadfully commonplace.

531
00:29:09,746 --> 00:29:11,338
Are you gonna make me ask again?

532
00:29:11,514 --> 00:29:15,046
I suppose it's inevitable, when we reach
the tipping point, when your...

533
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:18,337
curiosity outweighs your courtesy.

534
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:21,468
What the hell is wrong with you, Ducky?
Your life is in the balance here.

535
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,782
- What did you do there?
- Only what was required of me.

536
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,808
Are you protecting that guy?

537
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:30,222
I am protecting no one, Jethro.

538
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:34,500
Look...
if you intend

539
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:37,510
to unravel strings further
on this matter,

540
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,279
I would prefer
that you leave them unpulled.

541
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:41,684
No.

542
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,789
Are you leaving?

543
00:29:53,414 --> 00:29:54,226
Yeah.

544
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:57,874
- Good to see you, Doctor.
- Good to see you, too.

545
00:29:58,053 --> 00:30:01,343
Donnie, I think I found a place
in the ground that's not too tough.

546
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:04,458
Well, I'm sure
that will be lovely for...

547
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,332
It was only stunned.

548
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,487
Only stunned.

549
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,078
He's been...

550
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:20,406
waxing philosophical.

551
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:23,380
Did he read you passages
from Rilke's <i>Letters to a Young Poet</i>?

552
00:30:26,044 --> 00:30:27,170
Keep an eye on him.

553
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:37,097
What do you think?
Is that Mosuma?

554
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:39,615
- What am I looking at?
- We have been sifting through old

555
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:42,199
crime scene photos within walking
distance of the same neighborhood.

556
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:43,895
Trying to prove
she's seen him before.

557
00:30:43,955 --> 00:30:46,226
And that she was lying
when she told the ambassador it was

558
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:49,098
- a heat of the moment thing.
- If she's a liar, Ducky's in the clear.

559
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:50,099
Good theory.

560
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:52,219
It is a good theory, but it's...

561
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:54,020
not. We got nothing.

562
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,597
- Boss, it was a coincidence.
- No, it's not, it's fate.

563
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,491
What does this woman
know about Ducky?

564
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:01,736
He won't say.

565
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:04,696
Well, if the ambassador gets his hands
around his neck, he'll make him say.

566
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:08,708
- McGee, I.D. the guy on this film.
- Sounds more like a job for Tony.

567
00:31:08,768 --> 00:31:11,529
No, that's a genuine bad guy.
He's not an actor.

568
00:31:12,856 --> 00:31:14,585
Probably tied to the CIA.

569
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,672
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- Gibbs, it's Jordan.

570
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:21,062
I was just in the kitchen
making him some supper.

571
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:22,725
I came to check on him, and...

572
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:25,608
Well, I have no idea where he went.

573
00:31:25,724 --> 00:31:26,771
I do.

574
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:32,809
Let's go, Duck.

575
00:31:35,848 --> 00:31:36,548
No.

576
00:31:37,282 --> 00:31:39,349
- Can I help you?
- Special Agent Gibbs.

577
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,360
You can't arrest this man.
The accusations are false.

578
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:44,371
Dr. Mallard
has been accused of torturing

579
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:47,311
and killing a citizen
of Afghanistan seeking refuge.

580
00:31:47,693 --> 00:31:49,324
You have evidence to dispute this?

581
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,788
Then the course of action is set.
A tribunal must be convened.

582
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:57,490
Then you force me to petition
for the arrest of Mosuma Daoub.

583
00:31:58,021 --> 00:31:59,586
You're harboring a criminal.

584
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,548
I have had no contact
with your State Department,

585
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:06,316
which suggests they are unaware
of what has transpired.

586
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:09,087
Perhaps because you want
to protect your friend.

587
00:32:09,147 --> 00:32:10,852
You arrest him, I arrest her.

588
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:14,519
Lack of respect shown
by you and your people.

589
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:17,161
You will create
an international incident, sir.

590
00:32:17,464 --> 00:32:20,144
- You're the diplomat, not me.
- Obviously.

591
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:26,759
Ambassador.

592
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:28,573
Have you brought legal counsel?

593
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:30,632
I don't need counsel.

594
00:32:32,147 --> 00:32:33,972
I've come here to surrender.

595
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:52,306
"All that is necessary
for the triumph of evil

596
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:55,036
is that good men do nothing."

597
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:57,932
You're quoting Edmund Burke.

598
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,328
All day with Ducky.

599
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,518
I've got to get him
to call off the dogs.

600
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:13,909
The ambassador answers only
to the highest authority in his country.

601
00:33:14,653 --> 00:33:17,120
You cannot apply enough
pressure to bend him.

602
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:20,628
He has not contacted the State
Department. He does not want this.

603
00:33:24,871 --> 00:33:26,874
This a lesson in Mideast diplomacy?

604
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:30,025
Political relations what they are
between Afghanistan and the US,

605
00:33:30,097 --> 00:33:33,366
he cannot afford
to appear as the aggressor.

606
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:35,702
He needs an out.

607
00:33:38,902 --> 00:33:41,785
It is seven hours until sunrise
in Kabul, then...

608
00:33:42,473 --> 00:33:44,097
it moves up the chain.

609
00:33:45,338 --> 00:33:48,455
There is still time,
if you can get Ducky to open up.

610
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,680
Did you write
this aging program, McGee?

611
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:54,961
Yeah, updated some of the protocols
on the existing version.

612
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,608
It's not bad.

613
00:33:56,712 --> 00:33:59,137
Let's see how we do
with facial recognition.

614
00:34:00,265 --> 00:34:03,163
I heard about your shipment from home.
I was kind of shocked.

615
00:34:03,556 --> 00:34:05,264
Big surprise... I was a dork.

616
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:07,439
That's not what I meant.

617
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:09,688
You may not have noticed, but

618
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,822
it's taken a lot of work to outgrow
those awkward geeky phases.

619
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:14,440
I like your geeky parts.

620
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:18,453
I do, too, but I want to be more than
just a walking search engine, you know?

621
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:21,349
See, the tricky thing
is adding the new layers...

622
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:24,062
Without losing some of the old ones,
I get that.

623
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,255
Well, then, what are you shocked at?

624
00:34:26,613 --> 00:34:28,321
I can't believe you were a <i>Mac</i> guy.

625
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:31,949
Got him.

626
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:35,835
Agency I.D. card for Marcin Jerek.

627
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,837
Born in Poland, fled to Britain.

628
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:41,382
Until health complications
forced him into retirement,

629
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:44,417
Jerek lectured on interrogation
techniques at Langley.

630
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,718
- He's an expert at breaking a subject.
- Now we have to break him.

631
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,517
Address is in Virginia.
That's nice work, McEgghead.

632
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:53,127
And the box is going back to the attic.
That's smart.

633
00:34:53,212 --> 00:34:56,230
Yeah, got everything I needed.
All the data is right here.

634
00:34:57,351 --> 00:34:59,902
Your head really is shaped like an egg,
you know that?

635
00:35:00,627 --> 00:35:01,827
Don't do that.

636
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:09,106
Thank you for seeing us,
Your Excellency.

637
00:35:09,866 --> 00:35:11,152
We need a...

638
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,907
a conversation with Dr. Mallard.

639
00:35:14,798 --> 00:35:17,782
He has made it clear
he does not wish to speak with you.

640
00:35:18,753 --> 00:35:19,807
No, not me.

641
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:21,747
Then who?

642
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,921
Just in here, sir.

643
00:35:31,454 --> 00:35:34,787
I'm taken from my home
by federal agents,

644
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,440
delivered to the Afghani government
and accused of war crimes.

645
00:35:40,496 --> 00:35:44,356
And after all this, it's just Ducky.

646
00:35:46,382 --> 00:35:48,756
When you left Jalozai,
we were in the middle of a game.

647
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:50,442
- Do you remember?
- Vividly.

648
00:35:51,003 --> 00:35:52,984
You had me in a knight-bishop fork.

649
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:56,993
You should've seen this guy's place.
Tower of London's got nothing on it.

650
00:35:57,294 --> 00:35:59,966
- It's like a weapons museum.
- In here.

651
00:36:01,902 --> 00:36:03,167
What is going on?

652
00:36:03,951 --> 00:36:06,046
It's all right, Mosuma. Just listen.

653
00:36:10,724 --> 00:36:12,760
Then you decide both their fates.

654
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,702
It appears theirs
will be the next move.

655
00:36:16,317 --> 00:36:19,472
I suspect Trent
is to blame for this betrayal.

656
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:20,596
"Trent"?

657
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:22,807
<i>The destiny of students to...</i>

658
00:36:22,867 --> 00:36:24,274
<i>disappoint their masters.</i>

659
00:36:25,547 --> 00:36:28,937
So do you think they expect us
to quake in fear at the hangman's noose?

660
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,369
I have surrendered
to their judgment.

661
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,297
It is beyond my powers
to induce you to admit your shame.

662
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:37,387
<i>Once again, you misread me.</i>

663
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,039
<i>You feel no pain
because of your physical condition.</i>

664
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:42,777
<i>But that is no excuse
for your lack of remorse.</i>

665
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,916
Their enemies were hidden amongst them,
so I am summoned.

666
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:50,265
Times of war call for...

667
00:36:51,222 --> 00:36:53,458
a greater enemy, but...

668
00:36:54,135 --> 00:36:55,451
you flew in, Doctor.

669
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,156
A moth to the flame.

670
00:36:58,765 --> 00:37:01,485
Ignorant,
you would be burned by its touch.

671
00:37:02,195 --> 00:37:05,513
- <i>You were a tourist.</i>
- <i>I came there to save lives.</i>

672
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,449
- <i>You were there to destroy them.</i>
- One life to save thousands.

673
00:37:10,136 --> 00:37:11,665
<i>You do not think it costs?</i>

674
00:37:12,507 --> 00:37:15,192
How many did you save?
And how many did you take?

675
00:37:15,669 --> 00:37:16,682
Tell me.

676
00:37:18,247 --> 00:37:20,124
He does not deny
he killed my brother.

677
00:37:20,262 --> 00:37:23,497
<i>You never learned that death,
although occasionally unavoidable, was</i>

678
00:37:24,185 --> 00:37:25,851
<i>rarely of use to me.</i>

679
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:28,915
I cannot carry on conversations
with the dead.

680
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:31,653
Accept it.
Millions are alive still

681
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:34,548
because of the work
I conducted while you ran.

682
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,858
You shroud
your depravity in principle.

683
00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:39,954
But you, you take such...

684
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:43,374
- joy in what you do.
- Joy and pain must be earned.

685
00:37:43,498 --> 00:37:46,451
You're like a child pulling
the wings off flies.

686
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:48,276
My curse was my gift.

687
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,873
My deficiency was the fuel
that drove my life

688
00:37:52,156 --> 00:37:53,759
towards a singular pursuit.

689
00:37:54,012 --> 00:37:56,508
The pursuit of suffering!

690
00:37:57,143 --> 00:37:58,819
Of understanding...

691
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:00,997
the limits of human conviction.

692
00:38:01,057 --> 00:38:04,663
The moment when a person abandons...

693
00:38:05,226 --> 00:38:06,808
their most deeply-held beliefs.

694
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:08,772
I've seen the tools of your trade.

695
00:38:09,077 --> 00:38:10,964
And I've seen yours.
So which one of your

696
00:38:11,032 --> 00:38:13,626
morphine victims
have brought us here?

697
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:15,692
His name was Javid.

698
00:38:16,222 --> 00:38:19,492
<i>An innocent caught up in your net.</i>
<i>Who wanted no part of war.</i>

699
00:38:19,568 --> 00:38:21,255
<i>Who sought only safety.</i>

700
00:38:21,712 --> 00:38:23,653
Javid did not know anything.

701
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,126
There was no reason.

702
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:28,601
- Yes, there was.
- He had nothing to give you.

703
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:31,670
I was there, with him,
speaking with him...

704
00:38:32,384 --> 00:38:34,092
through his dying breath.

705
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,031
While you ignored his infection,

706
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:38,592
providing only the overdose
that killed him.

707
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:40,826
<i>It was an agonizing decision.</i>

708
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:42,610
<i>But it was your decision.</i>

709
00:38:42,964 --> 00:38:45,452
No amount of pain removes free will.

710
00:38:45,516 --> 00:38:48,561
If I kept him alive,
he would have continued to suffer.

711
00:38:49,068 --> 00:38:51,674
<i>Dying slowly, in excruciating pain,</i>

712
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,623
at your hands.

713
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,957
So you became
the "bringer of death".

714
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,925
What was the point in it all?

715
00:38:57,985 --> 00:39:00,332
How can you still not see?

716
00:39:00,392 --> 00:39:02,209
What did you want from him?

717
00:39:02,576 --> 00:39:03,652
Nothing.

718
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:06,931
I wanted nothing from him.

719
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,934
Javid was not your target.

720
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:17,634
He was your weapon.

721
00:39:17,828 --> 00:39:20,359
The boy was the means
to break a man.

722
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:24,998
<i>Your bleeding heart
eased </i>everyone's fears.

723
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:29,001
Without fear, I could not do my job.

724
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,999
You were torturing me.

725
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:37,299
To change you.
But you took too long to break.

726
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:41,505
I could have saved him.

727
00:39:45,546 --> 00:39:47,001
I have heard enough.

728
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,159
<i>If only you'd</i> left sooner.

729
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:55,241
Hope left with the saint.

730
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:02,527
The savage brought salvation.

731
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,003
You all right, Mosuma?

732
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,077
Excuse me.

733
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,511
Come. Let us go.

734
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:33,156
You are free to go, Dr. Mallard.

735
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,779
The charges against you
will not be pursued.

736
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:48,509
- You're forgiven.
- For the crime, Jethro.

737
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:51,697
For the act,
there is no forgiveness.

738
00:40:58,396 --> 00:41:00,009
I can't remember where this goes.

739
00:41:01,522 --> 00:41:04,032
I just want everything
to be perfect here.

740
00:41:04,202 --> 00:41:06,775
Jimmy, I know you're anxious
to have Dr. Mallard back,

741
00:41:07,428 --> 00:41:10,141
but he's not the kind of man
who wants a big show of affection.

742
00:41:15,053 --> 00:41:16,558
What kind of man is he?

743
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:25,452
Welcome back, Doctor.

744
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:28,281
Dr. Mallard.

745
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:31,256
1791.

746
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,764
While you were gone, I...

747
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:38,302
I was studying the penmanship
on the Declaration of Independence...

748
00:41:40,487 --> 00:41:42,997
Jimmy, why don't you take
the rest of the day off.

749
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:45,532
Go outside.

750
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:47,951
Smell a rose or two.

751
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:50,743
Actually, it's pretty cold out. I...

752
00:41:55,885 --> 00:41:56,714
Sure.

753
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:02,929
Thanks.

754
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:06,854
Doctor...

755
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,275
some people think that

756
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:11,794
J Street was omitted
as an intentional slight

757
00:42:11,857 --> 00:42:15,674
against Chief Justice John Jay,
but that isn't it, is it?

758
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:19,954
It's because in 1791,
the capital "J", is so

759
00:42:20,035 --> 00:42:21,952
is so closely resembled
a capital "I",

760
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:23,660
so...

761
00:42:24,514 --> 00:42:26,170
they couldn't have both.

762
00:42:29,085 --> 00:42:31,549
They were just trying
to keep people from getting lost

763
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:04,830
