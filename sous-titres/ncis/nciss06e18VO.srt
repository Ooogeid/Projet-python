00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:18,895
Post up here
while I take care of business.

3
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:30,573
Is that for me?

4
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:02,657
Teek?

5
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:04,284
Is that you?

6
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:06,276
You got a decision to make, Tara.

7
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,248
Do we walk out of here,

8
00:01:08,308 --> 00:01:09,816
or do I have to carry you?

NCIS Season 6 Episode 18
Knockout V1.0 FQM

00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:17,537
Synchro: Gaillots.

www.Team-NCIS.com

13
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:44,451
African-American male
in his late 40s.

14
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:48,514
Despite his distended features
from time under the water,

15
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:52,489
Chicago PD managed to identify
him as one

16
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,364
Tyler Keith Owens.

17
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:57,418
They fished him out of Lake Michigan...
two days ago.

18
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:00,775
That is just hours before Director
Vance's departure with McGee and...

19
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:05,076
Preliminary cause of death believed
to be multiple gunshot

20
00:02:05,136 --> 00:02:07,086
wounds to the chest and abdomen.

21
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,463
He was shipped here
by the Chicago M.E.

22
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:11,549
I've been asked to perform
the autopsy,

23
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:13,343
by Leon Vance.

24
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:14,938
His effects are up with Abby.

25
00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:17,180
Also at the request of Leon Vance.

26
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:19,232
Leon Vance is working a case.

27
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:25,124
Come on. Come on.

28
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,949
Come on, this is ridiculous.

29
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:30,401
Ziva, have you seen my...

30
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:32,826
Probie, have you...

31
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:35,697
You are with each other...

32
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,784
in Chicago with Vance.

33
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:39,327
I'm not in Chicago.

34
00:02:39,387 --> 00:02:41,746
Because I got to go to Arizona.
It has nothing to do with my...

35
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:44,771
lack of prowess
on protective detail.

36
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:46,668
Excuse me!

37
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,127
Okay, listen up, everybody!

38
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:50,004
I need your full attention here!

39
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:52,048
Lenny, Squiggy, Q-tip,

40
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:55,218
Q-Bert, Bungo Straits, Vertical Bill.
Can you hear me back there?

41
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,589
Natalie, hi.

42
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:01,140
You look very nice today.
I have lost my wallet.

43
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:04,810
So, if you've seen it,
please return it to me.

44
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:06,319
There will be no judgment.

45
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,772
Maybe even a small reward.

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,206
Hi, boss.

47
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,915
I lost my...

48
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:21,571
You're gonna say "mind"
or "marbles",

49
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:23,370
- but, I lost my...
- Job?

50
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:26,416
Have you heard from Ziva or McGee?

51
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:27,915
 Hold on.

52
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,340
It's the prince of darkness himself.

53
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,859
I'll be right up there, but Boss wants
to talk to you for a second.

54
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:37,552
He hung up.

55
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:40,813
He's setting up a videoconference
up in MTAC with... with Vance.

56
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:41,806
Good. Let's go.

57
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:44,594
Well, he just said me,
but I think we can... we all go.

58
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:48,947
Where'd you hide my wallet?

59
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,295
<i>What?</i>

60
00:03:51,092 --> 00:03:52,344
<i>Hold on for the Director.</i>

61
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:57,613
<i>DiNozzo,
I got an assignment for you.</i>

62
00:03:57,807 --> 00:03:59,799
<i>We're transporting
a key witness to DC.</i>

63
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:01,611
<i>I want you to sit on her
till we get back.</i>

64
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:02,971
Witness to what, Director?

65
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:05,788
<i>We believe she's got information
relating to the murder of a Marine.</i>

66
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:08,878
<i>Word gets out that we have her,
she could be in danger.</i>

67
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:11,294
<i>Witness' name is Tara Kole.</i>

68
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:14,005
<i>Her flight lands
at National in 40 minutes.</i>

69
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:19,302
<i>Is that you I see lurking
in the background?</i>

70
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:25,628
You're conducting an investigation.

71
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:30,015
<i>I understand you might feel your toes
being stepped on, Agent Gibbs.</i>

72
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:33,024
<i>Me handing out
assignments to your team.</i>

73
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,567
Not taking it personally.

74
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:36,163
<i>Are you suggesting I am?</i>

75
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,175
Are you?

76
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,662
<i>May I have the room, please.</i>

77
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:49,624
<i>Both rooms.</i>

78
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:58,247
<i>Tyler Owens disappeared
more than a week ago.</i>

79
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,312
<i>And, yes, he was a friend.</i>

80
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:03,429
<i>Local authorities haven't been able
to generate a single lead.</i>

81
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,641
Proximity to Great Lakes Reserve Center
help convince 'em to cede jurisdiction?

82
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,143
<i>Death of a Marine is
our jurisdiction.</i>

83
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:13,690
Yeah, well, he looks to be about 50.
What is he, a general?

84
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:15,546
<i>Former Marine.</i>

85
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:20,947
<i>Is it going to be a problem
for you to sit this out, Agent Gibbs?</i>

86
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:22,452
It's your case...

87
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,360
Director.

88
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:40,508
There was no sign
of foul play at his residence.

89
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:42,213
Tyler Owens was last seen

90
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:45,506
ten days ago at his place of business,
the South Side Gym.

91
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:47,432
That was Tony.
Again.

92
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,854
Is he looking for his wallet?

93
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:51,019
He keeps asking what we're doing
in the "Wine-dy" City.

94
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,937
- It's "windy".
- It's not so bad.

95
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,024
- What'd you tell him?
- I told him we were doing our job,

96
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:58,061
Director,
and that he should do the same.

97
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:59,169
Good.

98
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,406
Car?

99
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:04,057
Out front.
Destination?

100
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:06,268
Thinking I'll go for a workout.

101
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:10,219
Abs, what do you got?

102
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:13,210
I am not at liberty to discuss

103
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,460
the details
of Director Vance's case with you.

104
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,879
And I would certainly hope
that you wouldn't try to bribe me.

105
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:19,619
I wouldn't do that.

106
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:22,724
Because I can't say a word

107
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:25,928
about the five slugs
that Ducky pulled out of Owens' body.

108
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:28,140
Not that there's a word to say,
'cause I don't even know

109
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,599
if these 40-cal S & W's

110
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,852
are a match to the weapon
that was found in deceased's pocket.

111
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,645
Not that I would tell you
if they are.

112
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,898
I'm assuming that your curiosity

113
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,317
is purely for educational purposes.

114
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:42,982
After Ducky does the autopsy,
we should be able to calculate

115
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,198
how long
the accumulated postmortem gases

116
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,326
took to counteract the weight
that kept Owens submerged.

117
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:49,961
He was weighed down, huh?

118
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:51,388
With what?

119
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,043
Weights.

120
00:06:58,928 --> 00:06:59,921
Mismatched set.

121
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,006
15 pounder, 20 pounder.

122
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,884
They were threaded
through the deceased's belt.

123
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,385
Well, it wasn't a mugging.

124
00:07:06,763 --> 00:07:08,295
I need you to keep your...

125
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:10,973
educational inquiries
more abstract, Gibbs.

126
00:07:11,054 --> 00:07:13,267
I said that I wouldn't say
anything to you...

127
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,229
and I'm not going
to lie to the Director.

128
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,522
Owens carry a weapon?

129
00:07:18,322 --> 00:07:19,869
These are amazing, Gibbs.

130
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:21,524
I can't hear anything.

131
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,028
But, you know, feel free to...

132
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,149
muse out loud to yourself.

133
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,324
If this was my case,

134
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:30,614
I'd see if Owens was registered.

135
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:31,744
I'd run a search.

136
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:34,831
Gibbs, you really need
to find something to do.

137
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,000
"Idle hands are
the Devil's plaything."

138
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,753
Just picture Mephistopheles
sitting on his...

139
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:42,198
throne of fire,

140
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:44,423
playing with his collection of...

141
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:45,913
<i> idle...</i>

142
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:48,928
<i>hands.</i>

143
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:04,484
Sorry I couldn't help you, Gibbs.

144
00:08:07,184 --> 00:08:08,734
Get your left up, Campbell!

145
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,928
You're dropping your left!

146
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,008
Your other left, son!

147
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:17,876
Man, it's a damn shame.

148
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:19,699
Damn shame.

149
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,211
Coach Owens was never really
a contender,

150
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,880
but he was a great teacher.

151
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,548
Tough as nails, drove you hard.

152
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,258
Man worked your last nerve.

153
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,963
But there was a method
to his madness.

154
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:31,220
Brother pulled me off the wrong path,
set me right.

155
00:08:32,385 --> 00:08:35,141
So, Owens was revered by everyone?

156
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:36,767
Within these walls,

157
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:38,519
he was the black Miyagi.

158
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:43,313
Not a full set.

159
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,718
- You were counting?
- The dumbbells.

160
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:48,222
- You're missing a few.
- We're lucky to have what we got.

161
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:50,072
Keep movin' them feet, Campbell!

162
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:54,410
Spit!
Lubricate the man.

163
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:03,085
Yo, Spit, hold the bucket up.

164
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:06,124
So you can actually hit
something you're aiming at?

165
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,075
Thanks.

166
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:20,103
Let me see the towel.

167
00:09:23,801 --> 00:09:25,650
I used to carry the bucket myself.

168
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,859
- For real?
- Yeah.

169
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:28,277
Gotta start somewhere.

170
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:29,527
Climb the ladder.

171
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,656
You done pounding on my boys, Leon?

172
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,555
I don't know, Ike,
you got anybody left?

173
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:37,828
What do you say, David?

174
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,622
Want to go a few rounds?

175
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,166
I think that would violate
my primary assignment.

176
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:44,627
Only if you manage
to lay a glove on me.

177
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:47,797
Excuse me, darlin',
but this gym ain't coed.

178
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:49,382
Another time.

179
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,508
Just say when.

180
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:51,765
Yeah?

181
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:54,345
Run, get us a sandwich.
You know what I like.

182
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:55,470
Okay.

183
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:57,023
Leon, let's talk.

184
00:09:58,512 --> 00:09:59,809
Don't forget your jacket.

185
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:01,269
I lost it.

186
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,218
Go borrow mine,
it's the one on the end.

187
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:04,270
Okay, thanks.

188
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:07,441
His probably got stolen.

189
00:10:07,882 --> 00:10:10,468
Trying to teach the boy
to stand up for himself.

190
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,655
Things that bad here, Ike?

191
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,491
Same old same old.

192
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:19,495
Nice flight from Chicago, Ms. Kole?

193
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:20,686
Uneventful.

194
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,207
Had enough excitement, though.

195
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:25,459
Being abducted by Leon.

196
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:27,607
Yeah.

197
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:30,341
Well, plane travel's not
what it used to be, is it?

198
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:32,883
Bet there wasn't even a movie.
I'm a big fan of movies.

199
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:36,262
You don't have to make small talk
with me if you're uncomfortable.

200
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:39,441
I'm not uncomfortable. It just
seemed like, the way you said it,

201
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:41,475
that you had a relationship
with our new Director,

202
00:10:41,555 --> 00:10:43,706
and I said "new Director",

203
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:46,039
by the way, not "nude erector".
That's a homophone.

204
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:48,569
Unintentional, of course, but...

205
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:52,278
The Director...

206
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,727
he was just a ball of fire
when I knew him.

207
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,899
No direction at all.

208
00:10:58,089 --> 00:10:59,913
Well, I guess we were all
someone else then.

209
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:01,921
We?

210
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:03,882
Tyler. He was my brother.

211
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:07,934
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:11,636
Thank you, Anthony.
You're very sweet.

213
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:14,120
My...

214
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:16,135
patron saint.

215
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:17,303
Actually,

216
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,424
St. Nicholas
is the patron saint of...

217
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:25,225
St. Anthony's who you turn to
when you've lost something.

218
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,095
So, who does Anthony turn to
when he's...

219
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:31,044
lost something?

220
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,562
How do you know I've lost something?

221
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:37,990
I may not know my saints,
but I definitely know my sinners.

222
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,370
I miss Tyler.

223
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,874
Seems like just the other day
you two coming through that door.

224
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,710
Couple of string beans
fresh off the bus from Ohio.

225
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:51,559
That was his idea, you know.

226
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:52,901
Oh, don't I know it.

227
00:11:53,476 --> 00:11:56,300
Made sense he'd be the one to stick
in this business while you went off.

228
00:11:56,602 --> 00:11:57,954
That was his idea, too.

229
00:11:58,495 --> 00:11:59,719
Always pushing me.

230
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,681
'Cause when you're young,

231
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:07,019
it's all gas pedal and no brakes.

232
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,090
Took a few false starts, but...

233
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:11,107
you both learned patience.

234
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,359
Throw a quick left-hand jab,

235
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,169
not meant to do any damages.

236
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:17,071
Messing with the other guy's vision.

237
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:18,697
Right cross, brings the hands up.

238
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:21,492
Work the body combinations
till that chin sticks out.

239
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:23,577
Bang! Sets up the uppercut.

240
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,603
But you can't rush that haymaker.

241
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:26,622
Action...

242
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:28,833
reaction, action.

243
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:32,169
Tyler knew the art of the knockout.

244
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,714
That's how I know he didn't just jump
into something out there.

245
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,427
Yeah.

246
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:39,677
I'm thinking the same thing.

247
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:41,988
I figured you'd be back one day.

248
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:47,330
You ready for this title fight?

249
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,702
Talking about Joe Banks?

250
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:52,731
Is he still top dog?

251
00:12:53,202 --> 00:12:56,370
Hadn't seen his face in a long while
before he showed up a couple weeks ago.

252
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:58,946
He got a lot more cautious lately.

253
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:00,838
Yeah, Banks doesn't use
a cell phone.

254
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:03,826
He avoids electronic communication.

255
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:06,495
- Leaves no trail behind.
- Except slime.

256
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:09,665
He bought out a lot
of fighters over the years.

257
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,990
I think Banks got sick of Tyler,

258
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,253
poaching the local talent.
That's what I think!

259
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:16,230
Well, you got to have muscle
to stay on top.

260
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,299
That would make Tyler an obstacle.

261
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,013
You got the muscle
to chase down his ghost?

262
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,057
I'd rather lure him in.

263
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:29,032
Make him come to me.

264
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:30,561
Rope-a-dope.

265
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,355
What do you got that he wants?

266
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,100
You just spread the word.

267
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,543
Banks can find me in DC.

268
00:13:55,457 --> 00:13:57,243
Our bloater became a floater.

269
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,424
Yes. Whoever intended our fellow here
to rest in his watery

270
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:03,898
grave forever didn't count
on the effects of putrefaction.

271
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,836
You know what they say about
the best intentions, Doctor.

272
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:08,575
Road to hell was paved with 'em.

273
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:09,683
Time of death?

274
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:11,848
Between four and ten days ago.

275
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:15,439
A gas chromatography of the fatty acids
should provide a more exact time-frame.

276
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:19,401
Mr. Palmer,
why don't you enlist Abby's help

277
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:20,650
to finish those?

278
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,810
Yes, Doctor.

279
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:30,569
- Well, what do you have there?
- Background...

280
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:31,664
Tyler Keith Owens.

281
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,094
You're gonna get
that girl in trouble, Jethro.

282
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:36,028
Born Cincinnati, '63,

283
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:37,753
juvenile record in Ohio.

284
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:39,505
Illinois driver's license, '81,

285
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:41,340
boxing license, '83.

286
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:44,609
Professional record of 19 wins,
14 losses.

287
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:48,140
It's not too impressive.
Bit of a journeyman career.

288
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,286
Tax returns show he stayed
in Chicago since it ended.

289
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:53,027
Very thorough.

290
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:53,787
No.

291
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:56,449
Something's missing.

292
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:00,484
No military record.

293
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:02,236
Ducky,
if this guy ever was a Marine,

294
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:04,196
Leon Vance is the only one
who thinks so.

295
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:05,495
If he's not...

296
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:09,812
then our Director has overstepped
the bounds of his authority.

297
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:20,335
The last time you saw Tyler Owens

298
00:15:20,395 --> 00:15:22,965
was at an exhibition bout
at the South Side Gym?

299
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,834
We were checking out the fighters.

300
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,498
The "we"...

301
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:28,679
you are referring to would be...?

302
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,556
I was escorted by Joe Banks.

303
00:15:30,782 --> 00:15:31,765
Joe Banks.

304
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:33,517
That name sounds so familiar.

305
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:37,104
Well, your Director seems to think
he's a notorious crime boss.

306
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:40,149
Must be from a movie, maybe.

307
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:41,665
Well.

308
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,091
What service do you perform
in the employ of Joe Banks?

309
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:48,520
I think you know.

310
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,076
I need you to be explicit.

311
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:54,155
The same as you do for your boss.

312
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:56,332
Anything he asks.

313
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:57,844
Yeah.

314
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:59,981
Well, my boss doesn't really ask
for things.

315
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,016
We're supposed to figure it out
on our own before

316
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,616
he gets really angry.

317
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:05,424
He gets very... angry.

318
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:07,559
What happens
if you don't figure it out?

319
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:10,197
We get a smack
to the back of the head.

320
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:13,182
That hasn't happened for a while,
actually.

321
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:15,879
Maybe we're getting better
at our jobs.

322
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:18,437
I know I am.

323
00:16:20,142 --> 00:16:22,232
You know, Anthony,

324
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:25,126
I could help you
with your problem...

325
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,919
if you'd like.

326
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:29,643
My problem?

327
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:32,587
My job is to read men.

328
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,246
To know what they want,
and what they need.

329
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:37,880
And I...

330
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,709
see a man in need.

331
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:46,846
Hi, Ziva.

332
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,283
Hey, look, it's Ziva.

333
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:49,760
Ziva, Tara. Tara, Ziva.

334
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,928
We have met.

335
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:52,388
I am here to relieve you.

336
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:53,972
Well, then,

337
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:55,680
I'm relieved.

338
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,186
You look it.

339
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:22,805
What's the word, Doctor?

340
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:26,755
Owens went down fighting.

341
00:17:27,354 --> 00:17:28,507
I would hope so.

342
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:33,499
Powder burns on his left palm
indicates that he was...

343
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:37,350
probably grabbing the barrel of the gun
when the first shot was fired.

344
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:41,254
That's the one that grazed
his right shoulder there.

345
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:44,940
The next two rounds went
into his abdomen,

346
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,526
perforated his stomach
and lower intestine.

347
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:49,695
Probably put him on the ground.

348
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:51,514
But he was still alive.

349
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:54,158
The kill shots entered his chest.

350
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:58,036
Damage to the heart
was catastrophic.

351
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:00,581
Death from that point would be...

352
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,509
rapid.

353
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:04,710
This pattern of attack
suggests an untrained killer.

354
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,088
Yeah, it was sloppy.

355
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:09,089
My condolences, Director.

356
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:13,159
I understand this man was
an acquaintance of yours.

357
00:18:13,548 --> 00:18:15,179
I hadn't seen him in some time.

358
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:17,890
But once, you were quite close?

359
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:21,852
Gibbs was here.

360
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,292
What's his issue?

361
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:29,091
There is a lack of recorded evidence

362
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,028
that Owens was ever a Marine.

363
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:36,158
You can't believe everything
you read on a piece of paper.

364
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:55,302
I don't know,
the levels in the fatty acid...

365
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:56,595
Miss Sciuto.

366
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,806
Director Vance.
Welcome back.

367
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,065
- Has Gibbs been here?
- Now that you mention it,

368
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:05,019
I do detect
the lingering aroma of "Old Spice"

369
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:06,604
and sawdust.

370
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:08,065
But that could just be from...

371
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,625
We used...

372
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:12,562
ethanol and benzophenone
in our analysis.

373
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,072
That would explain the "Old Spice".

374
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,198
And the sawdust?

375
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:17,663
I...

376
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:19,952
- am taking up woodworking.
- Really?

377
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:24,957
I'm gonna build a coffin.

378
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:26,041
She is.

379
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:28,710
Did you get any actual work done,
or just woodwork?

380
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:31,588
Tyler Owens was killed 11 days ago.

381
00:19:31,864 --> 00:19:34,002
That's fight night
at the South Side Gym.

382
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,844
It's the last time
Joe Banks was seen.

383
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,179
Well, the striations on the slugs

384
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,640
match the gun disposed
of along with Owens.

385
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:44,852
It was reported stolen
in a burglary in Chicago last year.

386
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,186
Street piece.

387
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:49,297
I wasn't able to get prints off
the dumbbell or the gun.

388
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:52,651
Water covers up a lot of mistakes.
This guy might have gotten really lucky.

389
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:55,151
Well, not too lucky.
He pulled us into it.

390
00:19:55,877 --> 00:19:57,823
Did you get any organic material
from his hands?

391
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,167
I did, but it's not human.

392
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:03,662
It's a...

393
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:08,083
It's a bird feather.

394
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:10,627
There was some stuck
in his belt buckle, as well.

395
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,932
Maybe it got lodged
when he was in the water?

396
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:17,217
It's not likely
he was shot by a bird.

397
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:23,603
Is there anything else
you need to tell me?

398
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:24,404
No, sir.

399
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:27,185
That's everything, and I've been
completely candid with you, sir.

400
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:34,191
Great.

401
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:37,029
Now I have to build
a freakin' coffin.

402
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:39,156
He's a good-looking guy.

403
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:41,617
You two serious?

404
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:44,494
He does not live here.
He travels a lot.

405
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,955
Long-distance relationships
are impossible.

406
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:48,404
Relationship?

407
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:50,496
I do not know.

408
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:52,912
Maybe you should be looking
for something

409
00:20:52,972 --> 00:20:54,212
a little closer to home.

410
00:20:57,278 --> 00:20:58,147
Director.

411
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:07,726
I trust my people are treating you
all right?

412
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:10,681
You don't have to go through
all this trouble to protect me.

413
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,258
It's a long drive from Chicago,

414
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,860
but he will come for you.

415
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:19,698
You're counting on it, aren't you?

416
00:21:20,953 --> 00:21:23,325
I'm not here for protection at all.
I'm the bait.

417
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:24,826
I'm sorry about Tyler.

418
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:29,788
- I'm sorry I wasn't there.
- Only half of that is true.

419
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:31,875
You cut both of us out of your life.

420
00:21:32,235 --> 00:21:34,211
- I miss him...
- Not like I do.

421
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:36,664
But he's gone.
You can't undo that.

422
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:41,718
Would I have even seen you again
if your hand wasn't forced?

423
00:21:44,626 --> 00:21:47,140
This is your worst fears
come to light.

424
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:52,229
You think I'm scared of Banks?

425
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,598
That is not what I'm talking about,
and you know it.

426
00:21:55,318 --> 00:21:56,942
You're scared of yourself,

427
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,428
and pinning a body on Joe
is not going to make it go away.

428
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,907
He had nothing to do
with Tyler's death. I know him.

429
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,785
If that were true,
you would have quit him years ago.

430
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,897
Take Ms. Kole
to the southeast safe house.

431
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,787
Set up a rotation
with McGee and DiNozzo.

432
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:20,810
I'm going to want somebody
with her at all times.

433
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,093
Yes, sir.
Where will you be?

434
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:25,804
My wife will kill me
if I'm late for dinner.

435
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:45,322
Hey!

436
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:47,204
Daddy's home!

437
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:49,684
Is this the Vance residence?

438
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,054
It must be.

439
00:22:52,114 --> 00:22:53,250
I missed you, Dad.

440
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,791
Hey, Jared.

441
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,085
- What did you bring us?
- That's it, Kayla...

442
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,675
you just get right to it.
Why don't you give me a hug first?

443
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:02,382
- I missed you.
- Me, too.

444
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:05,135
Your father wouldn't have gone
to Chicago without bringing back some...

445
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,640
Frango mints.

446
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,668
- What about me?
- What about you?

447
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:11,683
You didn't think I'd forget about you,
did you?

448
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:12,800
These...

449
00:23:13,086 --> 00:23:14,217
are very old...

450
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:16,942
and they're very special to me.

451
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:18,296
Cool.

452
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:22,235
- They smell.
- That's from hard work.

453
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:23,556
Hard work stinks.

454
00:23:24,048 --> 00:23:25,197
Yes, it does.

455
00:23:25,514 --> 00:23:27,727
- Mine smell good.
- No, no, not till after we eat.

456
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:29,618
Now, you two go wash up.
Give me the mints.

457
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,369
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Come on.

458
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:41,713
So, I did good?

459
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:42,991
You did.

460
00:23:43,448 --> 00:23:44,708
What, not great?

461
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:48,934
Why didn't you tell me
you had a friend coming by?

462
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,022
I have a policy
against bringing work home with me.

463
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:01,775
Well, that's your policy, Leon.

464
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:03,557
You disobeyed me.

465
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:05,237
You've been hijacking my case.

466
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:07,269
Aggressive choice of words.

467
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:08,771
Aggressive actions.

468
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:10,408
Demand an explanation.

469
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:12,199
Your predecessor

470
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:14,948
used that seat
for a personal agenda.

471
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:17,082
Dangerous.

472
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:18,959
You're not about
to let that happen again.

473
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,771
No.

474
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:23,213
Anything in my history
to suggest I would?

475
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:25,090
I don't know enough
about your history.

476
00:24:25,945 --> 00:24:28,083
- Where did that come from?
- The CIA.

477
00:24:29,383 --> 00:24:31,388
You got that big
and axe to grind with me?

478
00:24:31,623 --> 00:24:34,474
Assume the dead man was a Marine.

479
00:24:34,652 --> 00:24:35,600
He was.

480
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:36,893
And your friend.

481
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:37,936
Was that, too.

482
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:40,647
Still doesn't explain
why you wouldn't want me on the case.

483
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:42,566
You think you can do
a better job than me?

484
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:44,468
I think it's my job and not yours.

485
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:45,566
You're right...

486
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:47,778
seems neither of us are doing
what we're supposed to.

487
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:51,060
Who is he to you?

488
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,910
You haven't opened it.

489
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,154
Situation was reversed.

490
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:59,207
You did me the courtesy of asking.

491
00:25:00,172 --> 00:25:01,749
So you're asking my permission?

492
00:25:06,115 --> 00:25:08,091
Are you prepared for me to say no?

493
00:25:08,698 --> 00:25:09,926
It's your call.

494
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:14,222
Leon?

495
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:19,702
You know I don't like it
when you chew on those things.

496
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:24,856
Gibbs, you're staying for dinner.

497
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:40,957
I was a freshman at the University
of Maryland, and Leon...

498
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:45,420
was at the Navy War College in Newport,
Rhode Island. You never told him?

499
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:46,878
Never had the occasion to.

500
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:49,341
You know he graduated
Annapolis, right?

501
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:51,966
But he had to resign
his commission in the Marine Corps?

502
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:56,890
That's funny,
I used to think I could spot a Marine.

503
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,474
I didn't get to serve.

504
00:25:58,534 --> 00:26:00,810
Second lieutenant,
but he took a medical

505
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:04,530
discharge 'cause he detached
the retina in his right eye from boxing,

506
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,776
so he's going to teach Jared
to be careful with those things, right?

507
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:09,986
Oh, yeah...
yeah, I'll teach him.

508
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:12,239
He studied all the time,
except for this one night

509
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,033
he just had to see a Terrapins game
because he couldn't miss...

510
00:26:15,128 --> 00:26:16,618
Len Bias.

511
00:26:16,753 --> 00:26:19,536
The best basketball player
ever to come out of Maryland.

512
00:26:19,618 --> 00:26:21,122
Until Carmelo Anthony.

513
00:26:21,203 --> 00:26:23,217
Carmelo was the number 3
pick in the draft.

514
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:25,221
Lenny Bias was the number 2,

515
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:28,381
and he would have even been better if
he hadn't died two days after the draft.

516
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:29,631
- From...?
- Drugs.

517
00:26:29,712 --> 00:26:31,320
And how many times did he do drugs?

518
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,133
Once.

519
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:35,101
Bias put up 36 points that night.

520
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:37,571
Okay, now, everybody in the student
section was just going crazy,

521
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:40,177
right, just jumping up and down.
There's finally a time-out,

522
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:44,104
and we all... you know,
just kind of start taking our seats.

523
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:46,519
Right?

524
00:26:47,593 --> 00:26:49,193
Except for this one guy

525
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,993
who's kind of just standing there
staring at me.

526
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,470
OK?

527
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:57,684
With that baby face.

528
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:01,320
- Gross.
- That's how we met.

529
00:27:01,948 --> 00:27:03,415
Wash, dry... come on.

530
00:27:04,143 --> 00:27:05,975
- In the kitchen.
- All right, guys.

531
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:08,673
- But I washed last.
- No, I washed last time.

532
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:10,831
- It's my turn to dry.
- Let's go.

533
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:13,675
How is that for a history lesson?

534
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:19,773
<i>Okay, Tony, clear to approach.</i>

535
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:20,936
<i>I'm on the street.</i>

536
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:24,351
Door-to-door service.

537
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:26,730
Check and make sure
you didn't leave anything back there.

538
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:29,899
- What's this?
- Tony, I think she found...

539
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,852
My wallet.

540
00:27:31,577 --> 00:27:33,194
Can you prove that it's yours?

541
00:27:33,274 --> 00:27:35,321
Yeah. If you open it up, you're going
to see my big

542
00:27:35,402 --> 00:27:37,157
fat smiling head
on the driver's license.

543
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:39,451
There seems to be
something else here.

544
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:42,440
You're making a circular crease
in the leather.

545
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:45,540
- That would probably be a...
- I think she knows what that is.

546
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:47,447
Now, why don't you want me
to see it?

547
00:27:47,662 --> 00:27:50,170
Could it be that it's nearing
its expiration date?

548
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:56,968
She doesn't know anything.

549
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,095
Get out of the car.

550
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:04,563
- Get behind me.
- Why, what is it?

551
00:28:04,623 --> 00:28:05,393
Town car.

552
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:14,986
Inside.

553
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:15,825
Let's go.

554
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,115
Ziva's radar is acutely tuned.

555
00:28:19,195 --> 00:28:21,209
Yeah, she doesn't miss a thing.

556
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,315
Nice family, Leon.

557
00:28:27,035 --> 00:28:29,297
Kids want to rescue
a pit bull from a shelter.

558
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:30,854
Can you imagine?

559
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:33,671
Come home to your new house
and find this wild dog has...

560
00:28:33,752 --> 00:28:37,305
ripped up your stuff and dumped all over
your place while your back was turned?

561
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:40,053
I think pit bulls get a bad rap.

562
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,221
Is that right?

563
00:28:41,825 --> 00:28:42,525
Yeah.

564
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:45,656
They're affectionate.
They're smart, loyal.

565
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:47,370
Keep you safe.

566
00:28:48,652 --> 00:28:49,646
Treat 'em right.

567
00:28:51,852 --> 00:28:52,886
Don't lie to 'em.

568
00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:55,429
Who would lie to a dog?

569
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,462
Owens was a Marine.

570
00:29:00,597 --> 00:29:02,700
I'm sure there's a reason
why there's no record of it.

571
00:29:04,037 --> 00:29:05,328
I don't need to know it.

572
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:08,289
You hold on to it.

573
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,567
You keep me honest.

574
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:15,056
Don't know if it's necessary.
I ever need to know anything...

575
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:17,296
Yeah, I know, you'll ask my wife.

576
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:28,560
That Ms. Kole sure
has a one-track mind.

577
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:30,979
Sure wish her boss
would come get her.

578
00:29:31,615 --> 00:29:33,189
The elusive Joe Banks.

579
00:29:33,444 --> 00:29:35,024
You think that's Vance's plan?

580
00:29:35,498 --> 00:29:37,026
I don't know...
what do you think?

581
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:39,091
"They pull a knife, you pull a gun."

582
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:43,031
"They send one of yours to the hospital,
you send one of theirs to the morgue."

583
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:44,784
"That's the Chicago way."

584
00:29:45,888 --> 00:29:46,894
It's Connery.

585
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,330
- <i>Untouchables</i>.
- Excuse me.

586
00:29:49,411 --> 00:29:51,583
I was told I could find
Tara Kole here.

587
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:55,408
Are you Joe Banks?

588
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,031
Wait.

589
00:29:57,271 --> 00:29:59,554
Say that again,
but more like Abe Vigoda.

590
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:01,049
Joe Banks, Tom Hanks.

591
00:30:01,177 --> 00:30:02,675
<i>Joe Versus the Volcano</i>.

592
00:30:03,143 --> 00:30:05,305
Which is the story of a guy

593
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:08,571
who is hired to go and jump
into a volcano because

594
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:10,726
- he's got a brain cloud.
- Is that what you got?

595
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:13,028
Maybe from repeated head trauma.

596
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:15,188
Get Mr. Banks settled.

597
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:19,565
John Patrick Shanley, who wrote
and directed <i>Joe Versus the Volcano</i>,

598
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,185
won an Academy Award for <i>Moonstruck</i>.

599
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:23,198
He also wrote and directed
the movie <i>Doubt</i>,

600
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,187
which came out recently...
it was pretty good...

601
00:30:25,247 --> 00:30:27,502
but in the middle there,
clearly, there was a goofy phase.

602
00:30:29,976 --> 00:30:31,372
I forgot what that feels like.

603
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:33,666
- It's been a while since...
- I know.

604
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:36,878
- Physical contact.
- I... know.

605
00:30:37,725 --> 00:30:38,818
You know?

606
00:30:39,793 --> 00:30:40,590
You know.

607
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:42,467
Any advice?

608
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:45,386
Snap out of it.

609
00:30:46,383 --> 00:30:47,766
I have no response to that.

610
00:30:57,767 --> 00:30:59,849
I wasn't invited here, as it were.

611
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:02,924
This is an interrogation room.

612
00:31:03,515 --> 00:31:04,948
You've seen your share.

613
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:06,991
<i>And not the worst.</i>

614
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:08,811
Not the best.

615
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,287
Well, you know who I am.

616
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,331
Am I supposed to know who you are?

617
00:31:14,412 --> 00:31:16,459
Name's Leon Vance.

618
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:20,547
Fancy footwork.

619
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:22,175
Wicked right cross.

620
00:31:23,223 --> 00:31:24,801
I never forget a fighter.

621
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:28,928
You could have been big-time.

622
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:30,452
I am.

623
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:34,997
A lot bigger than you have tried
to take me down.

624
00:31:36,117 --> 00:31:37,173
Sit down.

625
00:31:53,217 --> 00:31:54,372
Tried to retire,

626
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:57,959
but they don't let you out the game
so easy when you still hold the belt.

627
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,313
Don't I know it.

628
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,341
Tyler Owens.

629
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:07,071
Was sorry to hear about that.

630
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:08,886
How did it happen?

631
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:10,471
How did it happen?

632
00:32:11,186 --> 00:32:13,557
Bodies don't drop
without your say-so.

633
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:18,480
He's not who we think he is.

634
00:32:19,392 --> 00:32:20,432
What do you mean?

635
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:24,068
His worst days are behind him.

636
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:25,266
<i>1994.</i>

637
00:32:26,526 --> 00:32:28,818
Second-degree murder, not guilty.

638
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:32,441
Aiding and abetting, 1996.

639
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:34,752
Not guilty.

640
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:35,913
RICO,

641
00:32:35,994 --> 00:32:38,052
2000, mistrial.

642
00:32:39,906 --> 00:32:43,209
You are everything Tyler hated.

643
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,601
Pusher.

644
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:45,923
Fight fixer.

645
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:47,592
Murderer.

646
00:32:47,673 --> 00:32:50,428
Man, you're talking about sounds
like somebody to be feared.

647
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:52,135
That's how you keep
your people quiet.

648
00:32:52,195 --> 00:32:53,966
I'm gonna let 'em know
they can talk now.

649
00:32:54,026 --> 00:32:54,826
People?

650
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:56,768
You mean Tara?

651
00:32:58,414 --> 00:32:59,937
She'll never say a word against me.

652
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:02,940
She will, once she knows
she doesn't have to be afraid of you.

653
00:33:03,412 --> 00:33:05,318
She's never had a reason
to be afraid of me.

654
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:07,528
Why wouldn't she incriminate you
then?

655
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:09,113
Let me tell you something, partner.

656
00:33:09,193 --> 00:33:12,453
First of all, you're way off base.
Second of all, there are laws

657
00:33:12,863 --> 00:33:15,578
protecting her
against saying things like that.

658
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:20,909
Protecting both of us.

659
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:24,879
He's your husband?!

660
00:33:26,349 --> 00:33:28,063
That's what I wanted to see.

661
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:29,067
What?

662
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:32,096
That's what it looks like
when you know you're wrong.

663
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:35,348
- I wanted to see if you even knew.
- How do you marry a man like that?

664
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:37,445
- Joe's changed.
- You expect me to buy that?

665
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:40,321
He hasn't been hiding
from prosecution. He's out of the game.

666
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:42,914
He's a good man who doesn't want
to become a target for some...

667
00:33:42,974 --> 00:33:45,257
- punk to make a name off of.
- You calling me a punk?

668
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:46,630
I'm trying to get justice.

669
00:33:46,731 --> 00:33:48,160
You're lost, I can see it.

670
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:52,198
- What happened to Tyler?
- I don't know.

671
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,381
What do you think?

672
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,095
Tyler was family.

673
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:57,870
It's a shot at Joe
as much as anything else.

674
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,266
Joe and I...

675
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:07,095
fell in love.

676
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:08,840
It happens.

677
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,973
He lost his hunger.

678
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,097
He found something else.

679
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:18,975
When a man
that powerful loses a step,

680
00:34:20,432 --> 00:34:24,303
there's always somebody
right behind him, waiting to take over.

681
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:25,898
That's right.

682
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:27,934
When you're in charge,

683
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:31,922
you always got to watch your back.

684
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:33,194
Sad truth.

685
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,717
Sometimes,

686
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,453
you just can't protect
the people you love.

687
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:45,320
Blood on concrete?

688
00:34:45,503 --> 00:34:48,087
Chicago PD thinks
this might be the crime scene.

689
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:50,714
It's a couple blocks
from the South Side Gym, en route

690
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:53,468
- to Tyler Owens' residence.
- He never made it home.

691
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,727
What about Joe Banks?

692
00:34:54,956 --> 00:34:57,127
Tara says they spoke that night,
but that was all.

693
00:34:57,187 --> 00:34:59,682
Director Vance let him go.
Still holding her.

694
00:35:00,253 --> 00:35:02,435
- Big boss was wrong.
- So far. But...

695
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,812
you can't make an omelet
without breaking some legs.

696
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:07,020
- You're never making me breakfast.
- That's the truth.

697
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,358
- It's supposed to be "eggs".
- Cook them yourself.

698
00:35:10,718 --> 00:35:12,947
Did you resolve things
with Director Vance?

699
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:15,531
- Well, we made a breakthrough.
- He let you in?

700
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:16,783
We had dinner.

701
00:35:17,686 --> 00:35:20,779
That does tend
to alter a relationship.

702
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,582
It's been far too long
since you and I had dinner.

703
00:35:25,268 --> 00:35:28,121
I'll tell you what, Duck.
You do me a favor, I'll buy.

704
00:35:28,521 --> 00:35:29,388
Name it.

705
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:31,838
I need you to reexamine this body.

706
00:35:33,568 --> 00:35:36,511
Something specific
you want me to look for?

707
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:39,138
Evidence of surgery.

708
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:57,692
I checked in with a friend on Vice.

709
00:35:57,752 --> 00:36:00,660
Banks has divested himself
from his entire enterprise.

710
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,769
You got a lot of friends in Chicago.

711
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:06,550
Tyler was more than a friend.

712
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,756
That's the man that taught me
the difference between

713
00:36:10,816 --> 00:36:12,253
surviving and really living.

714
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:13,840
He was my hero.

715
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:15,925
You're not giving up.

716
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:23,266
In 30 years, the national rate
for solving murders dropped from...

717
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:24,684
80 to 60%.

718
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,811
You know why that is?

719
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,468
Murder got less personal.

720
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:31,353
Drive-bys, drug crimes, turf wars.

721
00:36:31,562 --> 00:36:33,693
I owe Tyler my life,
there's no way I'm giving up.

722
00:36:33,919 --> 00:36:35,462
He might've been a hero to you.

723
00:36:36,388 --> 00:36:37,954
Owens was still just a man.

724
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:40,611
Motive could be simple.

725
00:36:41,343 --> 00:36:43,452
So what did he have
that was worth getting killed over?

726
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:45,121
Just a name.

727
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,874
Wasn't involved in drugs.

728
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,317
Killer didn't take his money...

729
00:36:49,557 --> 00:36:51,134
or his shoes or his...

730
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:55,131
His coat.

731
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,135
Nice heavy leather coat.

732
00:37:02,622 --> 00:37:03,662
Duck down.

733
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:07,476
Don't throw anything. I didn't mean to
say anything to Gibbs, I'm really sorry.

734
00:37:14,281 --> 00:37:16,903
Ms. Sciuto,
I don't care what you told him,

735
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:19,744
as long as you tell me
that those feathers were duck down...

736
00:37:20,475 --> 00:37:22,408
the ones that were discovered
on Owens' body.

737
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:23,618
Hungarian goose,

738
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,621
to be specific, probably used
as some sort of filler in...

739
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,371
An inexpensive winter coat.

740
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:30,917
Wasn't stolen.

741
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:34,003
Kid got rid of it
because it was covered in blood.

742
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:35,254
Good work, Abs.

743
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:38,215
Too much work. Don't ever put me
in that position again.

744
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:40,360
Okay, I won't.

745
00:37:42,337 --> 00:37:44,533
But I will help you
with your project here, if you want.

746
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:46,636
It's a coffin, not a boat.

747
00:37:47,562 --> 00:37:49,584
All right, I'm coming, I'm coming.

748
00:37:49,996 --> 00:37:51,358
Damn it, Spit.

749
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:56,285
<i>-Hey Ike, It's Leon.</i>
- Hold on a minute.

750
00:37:58,305 --> 00:37:59,661
<i>Ike, it's Leon.</i>

751
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:02,054
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

752
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:07,715
You figured it out?

753
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:09,112
Too late.

754
00:38:09,472 --> 00:38:12,041
This kid Spit started bragging
about it.

755
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,060
How he took down the champ.

756
00:38:17,802 --> 00:38:20,091
A couple of fighters took justice
into their own hands.

757
00:38:20,597 --> 00:38:22,581
- He'll live?
- It's too soon to tell.

758
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:28,759
Tyler had a philosophy...

759
00:38:28,983 --> 00:38:30,685
you had to earn
your way into the ring.

760
00:38:30,903 --> 00:38:33,938
He didn't want this next generation
to make the same mistakes he did.

761
00:38:34,537 --> 00:38:36,149
This kid didn't see it that way.

762
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:39,568
Get tired of working
for his respect.

763
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:42,405
Thought he could take it with a gun.

764
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,610
Kid thought nobody noticed him.

765
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:47,909
Tyler was just standing
between him being

766
00:38:48,183 --> 00:38:50,162
invisible and everybody
knowing who he is.

767
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,433
I'm headed back to Chicago.

768
00:38:57,124 --> 00:38:59,171
I'm gonna take Tyler home
for a memorial service.

769
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,427
Is there anything
you need before I go?

770
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:09,076
Nothing that can't wait.

771
00:39:24,648 --> 00:39:26,671
You're driving
all the way back to Chicago?

772
00:39:26,922 --> 00:39:28,231
Oh, it's not so bad.

773
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:29,408
Joe's good company.

774
00:39:30,374 --> 00:39:32,199
I'll escort Ms. Kole out.

775
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:33,109
Okay.

776
00:39:33,169 --> 00:39:34,664
I need to speak to you.

777
00:39:46,504 --> 00:39:48,637
For some reason,
you can see right through my disguise.

778
00:39:49,202 --> 00:39:51,140
How bad's the dry spell?

779
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:52,058
Saharan.

780
00:39:52,455 --> 00:39:54,859
- Never been a problem before?
- You kidding me?

781
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:58,147
Not since Lisa Mullen taught me
to play doctor in the second grade.

782
00:39:58,294 --> 00:39:59,273
What's changed?

783
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:01,001
Real doctor,

784
00:40:02,053 --> 00:40:03,903
real love, real bad breakup.

785
00:40:04,478 --> 00:40:06,242
Messed you up pretty bad, huh?

786
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:10,424
Kicked off a slump with women
that's unprecedented in my adult life.

787
00:40:10,814 --> 00:40:11,983
I've tried everything.

788
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:15,374
I mean, I'm dating constantly,
but I can't seem to get it right.

789
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:18,334
I'm not closing the deal, you know?
Like there's a saboteur in my head.

790
00:40:18,598 --> 00:40:21,733
I'm making every rookie mistake. I'm
talking about myself too much at dinner.

791
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:24,542
I mean, I'm talking about my ex,
I'm talking about my feelings, I...

792
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:25,674
I scare 'em off.

793
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:27,760
Crying?

794
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:32,525
DiNozzo men don't cry.

795
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:34,438
You'd be surprised...

796
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:37,524
how many of my clients just want
a shoulder to cry on.

797
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,195
Opening up...

798
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,538
is the first step.

799
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,568
Let's skip to the last step.

800
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:47,270
That's easy.

801
00:40:48,308 --> 00:40:50,239
Pick the right woman.

802
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,373
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

803
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,222
Yeah, it's fine.

804
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:13,639
It's a struggle...

805
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:17,226
to become the man
that you want to be.

806
00:41:18,618 --> 00:41:20,500
It's harder than you want,

807
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:22,697
it's longer than you want,

808
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,443
and it takes more out of you than...

809
00:41:27,896 --> 00:41:29,953
than you expect that it should.

810
00:41:33,713 --> 00:41:36,537
Silicon band around
his right eyeball.

811
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,109
Ocular surgery.

812
00:41:38,384 --> 00:41:41,500
No doubt to repair
a detached retina.

813
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,179
What has this to do with his death?

814
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,260
Nothing.

815
00:41:47,363 --> 00:41:50,217
I don't know if Tyler became
the man that he wanted to be,

816
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:54,096
but I do know he wanted to be
the man that he ultimately became.

817
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:58,896
He was a leader, he was a teacher,

818
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:03,376
and he taught those hard lessons
to so many of us here.

819
00:42:06,509 --> 00:42:09,315
He helped us to see
that it might be possible.

820
00:42:13,361 --> 00:42:14,478
To be someone else.

821
00:42:15,257 --> 00:42:17,648
To be better
than you might have dreamed.

822
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,388
Our dreams got bigger

823
00:42:23,783 --> 00:42:25,794
because he told us
that it was possible.

824
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,640
I hope his legacy
lives on in each of us.

825
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,636
For every life that was touched
by his generosity.

826
00:42:39,053 --> 00:42:41,643
I know that Tyler Owens
will live on in me.

827
00:42:44,203 --> 00:42:45,189
Thank you.
