1
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:14,018
What is this, dog meat?

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,815
Looks like the same crap
we had yesterday.

3
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:17,351
You should've ate it all yesterday.

4
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:19,243
Anyone seen Lieutenant Ferris?

5
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:21,736
Check the head, sir.
Been in his office since breakfast.

6
00:00:21,798 --> 00:00:23,754
Probably plotting his revenge
against Mitas.

7
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:24,885
Bite me.

8
00:00:24,938 --> 00:00:26,809
Couldn't taste any worse than this chow.

9
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,847
All right, one of you guys better
go check to see if he's okay.

10
00:00:29,857 --> 00:00:31,497
Ferris.
You all right?

11
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:33,323
Yeah, I'm fine, sir.

12
00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:35,349
At least until I ate this crap.

13
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:36,892
No new orders from STRATCOM?

14
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:38,392
No, sir, just checked.

15
00:00:38,557 --> 00:00:39,565
Nothing.

16
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:41,279
Hair of the dog, Ferris?

17
00:00:41,644 --> 00:00:42,888
Go to hell, Mitas.

18
00:00:50,107 --> 00:00:51,463
Man, what's the matter?

19
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:52,794
Takada, what's wrong?

20
00:00:58,661 --> 00:00:59,919
Get him to sick bay!

21
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,042
Now!

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,189

27
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:17,709
Don't you have paperwork, DiNozzo?

28
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,142
What do you think I'm doing?

29
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:20,533
I take the paper...

30
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:22,018
and I make it work.

31
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:29,880
- Tonight's the night.
- What night?

32
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:31,977
- Brain Matter.
- Brain Matter?

33
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,967
Yeah, my friend's band.
Remember?

34
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:35,664
Brain Matter.

35
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,640
Yeah,
you guys all promised you'd go with me.

36
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,307
- All of us?
- All of you.

37
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:40,968
- Even me?
- Even you.

38
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:42,392
And you...

39
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:45,415
- and you.
- I don't think I can make it tonight.

40
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,627
I've got to...

41
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:47,829
catch up on

42
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,170
paperwork.

43
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,835
And I've got a very important thing

44
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,267
<i>And other thing</i>

45
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:54,256
And, I-I've got...

46
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:57,566
Some people wear these
spiky things just for show.

47
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:00,955
I don't.

48
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,160
I've got nothing better to do
than-than to see...

49
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:06,797
A dead body, McGee?

50
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:08,013
You read my mind, boss.

51
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,072
It's a quick read.

52
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:10,576
Pack up.
Full kit.

53
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:14,049
Motion sickness meds?

54
00:03:14,181 --> 00:03:16,091
Chopper's waiting at N.A.S. Anacostia.

55
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:18,879
I'm fine on a chopper, boss.

56
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:22,507
Chopper takes us to the ship, McGee.

57
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:24,218
USNS Chimera.

58
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:25,625
Get briefed at Anacostia.

59
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:28,313
You know, Brain Matter's
playing a really late set.

60
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:29,847
<i>That's odd, there's...</i>

61
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:31,483
<i>no Chimera on the register.</i>

62
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:32,996
Any reason why that would be?

63
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:35,881
We'll get briefed at Anacostia.

64
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:38,236
Okay, I'll get my gear.

65
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:41,034
I'll get Duck. Pack a toothbrush.
We're going to be there a while.

66
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,842
Well, look on the bright side, Probie.

67
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,183
Ixnay on the AinMatterBray.

68
00:03:44,216 --> 00:03:45,450
Really wish I could go,

69
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:46,874
sorry.

70
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,370
Thanks anyway.

71
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:55,308
Take a...

72
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,669
Brain check?

73
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:58,665
Sorry.

74
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,765
We received word
of the death this morning.

75
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:04,241
They say what killed the guy?

76
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:06,189
Isn't that your job, Agent Gibbs?

77
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,426
Commander Wilkins will have
you out to the Chimera by nightfall.

78
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:12,471
Chimera's not listed in the Navy fleet.

79
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:13,825
It's not on the books.

80
00:04:14,377 --> 00:04:16,196
The Chimera's a highly sophisticated,

81
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:17,862
top-secret research vessel.

82
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:19,239
Researching what?

83
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:20,969
That's need-to-know.

84
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:22,104
And you don't.

85
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,548
That's the "top secret" part, McGee.

86
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,532
Go in,

87
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,584
get the body,

88
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:29,600
come back out.

89
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:31,196
We've got a death to investigate.

90
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:32,544
Take witness statements,

91
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:33,855
do what you need to do.

92
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,228
Just don't ask anything beyond
your pay level.

93
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,978
We'll do our jobs, Commander.

94
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:42,108
NCIS was called out
because no other federal

95
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,182
investigative agency has clearance
to get on the Chimera.

96
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:48,331
That said, even you guys don't
have clearance to know what's on it.

97
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:49,900
<i>I get it, boss.</i>

98
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:51,196
It's a black ship.

99
00:04:51,472 --> 00:04:52,475
Black sheep?

100
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:53,907
No, they don't exist.

101
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:55,285
I've seen black sheep.

102
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,444
No, I said "black ship," not sheep.

103
00:04:57,934 --> 00:05:00,158
Clearly the US Navy
is still intent on pulling

104
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,139
the wool over the eyes
of the American people.

105
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:03,654
- <i>Sir.</i>
- No photos.

106
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:06,447
It's standard procedure.

107
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,372
There's nothing standard
about the Chimera.

108
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:10,749
I don't want anyone
documenting what's on that ship.

109
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:13,752
Bring the camera, McGee.

110
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:20,313
I suggest you keep your inquiry
focused on that body.

111
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:27,872
<i>Chimera, Lady 8-0-6 approaching
your deck for landing. Over.</i>

112
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:31,344
<i>Chimera, do you copy?
Over.</i>

113
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:34,192
<i>The ship's LZ is obstructed.</i>

114
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,962
<i>We'll hold above deck in a hover.</i>

115
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:41,494
We still can't raise
any of the crew on the radio, sir.

116
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:43,110
Alert Commander Skinner.

117
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:44,209
Will do.

118
00:05:55,344 --> 00:05:56,800
Where's the welcoming committee?

119
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:58,296
<i>The deck lights are on.</i>

120
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,524
Nobody's home.

121
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:02,134
This is most unusual, Jethro.

122
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:04,264
- It is creepy.
- It's a ghost ship.

123
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:06,471
<i>Agent Gibbs, we have reserve fuel.</i>

124
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:08,219
We need to know if you're staying, sir.

125
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:09,655
<i>Boss, I've got to tell you...</i>

126
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,685
I don't have a real good
feeling about this.

127
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:18,674
We're staying.

128
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:36,321
So this is the highly sophisticated,

129
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:37,852
top secret ship?

130
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:40,547
Looks more like an old tramp steamer.

131
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:43,008
<i>I suppose they were trying
to look inconspicuous,</i>

132
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:44,509
hoping to be left alone.

133
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:50,362
Can you get any more alone than this?

134
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:01,648
I'm beginning to wonder whether
they dropped us on the right ship.

135
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:03,985
Right ship.

136
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:06,823
Wrong night.

137
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:24,262
Every room is empty.

138
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:26,468
It's like the entire crew disappeared.

139
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,179
Welcome aboard the USNS Houdini.

140
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:31,359
Still playing.

141
00:07:32,676 --> 00:07:34,351
Hey, it's your favorite, McGee

142
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,844
Brain Matter.

143
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:37,499
Thanks.

144
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,689
I feel bad enough already, okay?

145
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:40,993
Take another pill.

146
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:42,888
Sorry.

147
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:46,982
Wait a second,
this doesn't make any sense.

148
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:48,576
Something suspicious?

149
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,739
Absolutely.

150
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:51,970
This guy had a full house.
Why would he fold?

151
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:56,829
<i>"Dear Mary Beth. Good news.</i>

152
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,918
<i>Overheard the captain say they
had a good dive last night.</i>

153
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,850
<i>If they found
what they were looking for,</i>

154
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:03,743
<i>we could be heading home any day.</i>

155
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:06,268
<i>I can't tell you much
about the mission, but..."</i>

156
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:09,577
But...?

157
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:12,180
It stops there.

158
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:18,027
<i>You think they all just went
out for an evening swim?</i>

159
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,692
<i>You notice something missing, Duck?</i>

160
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:20,859
People.

161
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:21,983
Life boats.

162
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:25,074
Yeah, I didn't notice
any on the starboard side either.

163
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:26,378
The ship was abandoned.

164
00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:28,047
In a hurry, it would seem.

165
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:29,698
Too much of a hurry to send a Mayday?

166
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:32,631
No, no, Jethro.
No questions beyond your pay level.

167
00:08:36,702 --> 00:08:38,028
Five minutes.

168
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,291
You owe me ten bucks.

169
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,287
Where's McGee?

170
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:44,348
Calling Earl.

171
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:45,440
Shouting groceries.

172
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:46,690
Making street pizza.

173
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,107
<i>Technicolor yawn.</i>

174
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:53,518
I found something.

175
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:54,806
Lost something, too.

176
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:10,888
<i>I guess you can't judge
a black ship by its wool.</i>

177
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:12,327
What are they researching, Duck?

178
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:14,594
Something to do with rats,
if I were to guess

179
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:16,241
from these empty cages.

180
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:17,909
Skinner seemed pretty paranoid.

181
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:20,165
Guessing the mission
wasn't purely humanitarian.

182
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:21,917
I doubt it's even human.

183
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:23,694
<i>Thermosalinographs,</i>

184
00:09:23,756 --> 00:09:26,511
fluorometer, carbon analyzer...

185
00:09:27,038 --> 00:09:28,516
Whatever it is,

186
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:31,176
it's not visible to the naked eye.

187
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:36,806
What was that?

188
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,814
Could be the metal of the ship

189
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:40,936
contracting in the cool of the evening.

190
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:43,637
Or not.

191
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,387
Sounded as if it was coming
from the cargo hold above us.

192
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,072
Duck, you're with me.

193
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:49,599
Check out the cargo hold.

194
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,644
I was afraid you were going to say that.

195
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,604
<i>Baa baa, black ship...</i>

196
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,492
Have you any wool?

197
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:08,534
Yes sir, Yes sir...

198
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,245
But no one gets to see it.

199
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:12,632
You're gonna need top secret
government clearance...

200
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:17,276
Someone or something's on the ship

201
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:18,582
with us.

202
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,170
I can feel it.

203
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:22,263
Yeah, I can see it.

204
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:28,219
Scared much, DiNozzo?

205
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:29,693
Stuff it, McBarf Bag.

206
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:31,254
It's just a cute, little rat.

207
00:10:31,662 --> 00:10:32,904
Why the irrational fear?

208
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,184
It's not cute.

209
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:35,301
It's not little.

210
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:36,575
And it's not irrational.

211
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:37,942
Cowardly then?

212
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,345
Not if you're uh,

213
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,737
someone who survived
a bout of pneumonic plague,

214
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,033
thank you very much.

215
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:44,864
Rats are a known carrier.

216
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:47,569
I used to love rats before the plague.

217
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:50,746
- I was a regular Willard.
- What is a Willard?

218
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:51,925
It's a movie.

219
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:55,135
Willard had a pet rat named Ben.

220
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,644
Social misfit.

221
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:58,555
Made fun of by his coworkers.

222
00:10:58,677 --> 00:10:59,783
He had a creepy boss.

223
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:01,148
No wonder you're related.

224
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,538
You think Gibbs is creepy?

225
00:11:02,898 --> 00:11:05,425
I think she meant the social misfit,
made fun of part.

226
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:07,894
Did you hear that?

227
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,223
- No.
- No.

228
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:10,510
There's something aboard.

229
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:12,359
Other than a rat.

230
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,633
What do your astute

231
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:17,946
ninja Mossad senses tell you it is?

232
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,870
In Mossad part of the training
is to be open to things you cannot see.

233
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,227
Or even understand.

234
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:24,656
You mean the supernatural?

235
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:26,029
Call it what you want.

236
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:29,211
Not everything can be explained
by the laws of the natural world.

237
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:30,684
You believe in ghosts?

238
00:11:30,735 --> 00:11:33,006
I do not not believe in ghosts.

239
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:34,327
Or demons.

240
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:36,171
Or monsters.

241
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:39,516
We are on a ship called the Chimera.

242
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,267
I thought Chimera meant
delusion or fantasy.

243
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:45,106
In Greek mythology,
a Chimera is a monster

244
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:48,354
with a lion's head, a goat's body
and a dragon's tail.

245
00:11:48,443 --> 00:11:50,339
So you think they named
this ship the Chimera

246
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:51,909
because there's a monster on board?

247
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,851
They did not name it the Puppy.

248
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:01,929
Boo.

249
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,560
Get in here.

250
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:10,126
Well, whatever's on this boat
must be pretty damn scary

251
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:12,748
if it got them to ditch this
delicious-looking...

252
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:14,549
What is this stuff?

253
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:16,424
Don't ask me.

254
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:18,310
That's not a request, it's a command.

255
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:22,222
The plot sickens.

256
00:12:23,162 --> 00:12:24,707
This is our crime scene.

257
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:25,975
If there was a crime.

258
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:27,774
Well, you see these

259
00:12:27,974 --> 00:12:30,424
little flecks of brown in the blood?

260
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,265
Coffee-ground emesis.

261
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,869
Usually a sign of alcoholism but

262
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:40,407
you can get it from severe
gastrointestinal distress.

263
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,800
Steady, Probie.

264
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:47,872
Tell that to my stomach.

265
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:50,101
Steady, Probie's stomach.

266
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:52,195
I would not stand there if I were you.

267
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:55,362
That's a good point.

268
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:57,263
You don't want to compromise
the crime scene.

269
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:58,601
Gibbs.

270
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,269
Partial footprint.

271
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:06,311
In blood.
They lead out of here.

272
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,303
In here.

273
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:29,340
You were right, Ziva.

274
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:31,666
Someone is on board with us.

275
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,098
Not him.

276
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:34,373
There's something alive.

277
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:35,795
I can feel it.

278
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,705
A lion-headed dragon goat?

279
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:40,689
Maybe.

280
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:45,889
Someone tossed a month's supply
of creamed corn to make room for him.

281
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,431
Please don't say that again.

282
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:48,915
"Tossed"?

283
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:50,238
No.
"Creamed corn."

284
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:53,021
There's significant petechial
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

285
00:13:53,143 --> 00:13:55,353
These little pinpoints of blood.

286
00:13:55,823 --> 00:13:57,711
It's often a sign of asphyxia.

287
00:13:58,148 --> 00:14:01,370
Well, we won't know for sure
until we conduct some tests.

288
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:03,280
McGee, get me a satellite link.

289
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:18,302
<i>Abby.</i>

290
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:20,631
<i>Abby!</i>

291
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:23,274
<i>Abby!</i>

292
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:25,463
McGee!

293
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,728
You shouldn't sneak
up on people like that!

294
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,474
<i>What the hell is that noise?</i>

295
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:32,950
Brain Matter.

296
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:35,532
<i>I love them.</i>

297
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:36,770
You guys okay?

298
00:14:36,814 --> 00:14:38,616
<i>Yeah, yeah, we're peachy.</i>

299
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:41,091
<i>I am dealing with my boat phobia,</i>

300
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:42,992
<i>Tony's dealing with his rat phobia,</i>

301
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,801
<i>and Ziva's dealing
with her ghost phobia.</i>

302
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:46,632
So, what's Gibbs dealing with?

303
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:48,530
<i>Them.</i>

304
00:14:48,531 --> 00:14:50,360
<i>Abs, patch me through to the Director.</i>

305
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:53,006
No need, Jethro, I'm here.
What's the status?

306
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:54,857
<i>Well, the crew has disappeared...</i>

307
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:57,230
- <i>except for one.</i>
- Did he tell you where they are?

308
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:58,556
<i>No. He's dead.</i>

309
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:00,591
Have you ID'd him?

310
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:02,034
<i>Yeah, hang on.</i>

311
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:05,343
<i>Dr. Satoshi Takada.</i>

312
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,120
<i>What do you got on him, Abs?</i>

313
00:15:09,515 --> 00:15:11,520
Dr. Satoshi Takada.

314
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:12,567
Marine biologist.

315
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:15,186
Lieutenant Commander
for the Navy since 1997.

316
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:17,295
PhD in biology from LSU.

317
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:20,664
Make sure Skinner knows he's got 20 men
stranded in life<i> boats.</i>

318
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,607
I'll get right on it.
Does Ducky have a cause of death?

319
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:26,232
<i>We're still doing tests.</i>
Don't know what killed him yet.

320
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:27,347
Yes, we do.

321
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:29,923
My initial

322
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:33,010
diagnosis of asphyxia
was incorrect, I'm afraid.

323
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:35,346
It looks as if Takada died of

324
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:37,321
viral hemorrhagic fever...

325
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,336
to which, by now,
we have all been exposed.

326
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:42,726
Can't leave the ship.

327
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:44,789
Well, that's not a problem, Jethro.

328
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:46,975
If my diagnosis is correct...

329
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:50,023
we'll all be dead by morning.

330
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:03,139
<i>STRATCOM has received no signals
from any life boats.</i>

331
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,860
A crew of 20 doesn't just
disappear into thin air.

332
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:07,794
<i>Trust me,
we'll find those men.</i>

333
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:10,105
<i>We're dispatching our
rescue-and-recovery ops,</i>

334
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,753
<i>and getting a relief crew
out to the Chimera ASAP.</i>

335
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:17,173
I need you to tell me what kind
of research the Chimera was involved in.

336
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:19,367
<i>Deep-sea marine-life exploration.</i>

337
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,560
<i>I'm afraid I can't say
anything more than that.</i>

338
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:22,584
<i>It's classified.</i>

339
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:24,901
I have top secret clearance, Commander.

340
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:26,952
<i>The mission is above top secret,
Director.</i>

341
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:29,554
<i>But trust me,
it's pretty mundane stuff.</i>

342
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:31,633
My medical examiner believes

343
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:34,254
that Dr. Takada died from a deadly virus

344
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:37,654
he may have contracted
from the "mundane stuff"

345
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:38,972
he was studying.

346
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:42,065
<i>Then he must be mistaken
in his preliminary diagnosis.</i>

347
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:44,219
Something on that ship killed him.

348
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:45,770
<i>We have no reason to believe</i>

349
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:48,484
<i>that Dr. Takada's research had
anything to do with his death.</i>

350
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,918
Commander,
if you insist on stonewalling me,

351
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:54,220
I can take this
to a higher command level.

352
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:55,965
<i>I'm not stonewalling, Director.</i>

353
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,394
<i>I'm telling you the truth.</i>

354
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,976
You're not telling me a damn thing.

355
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,474
You do not run black ops
to carry out mundane research.

356
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,376
The lives of my agents
are being threatened,

357
00:17:05,453 --> 00:17:08,077
and I need to know
what is threatening them.

358
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:14,012
Primitive conditions, Duck.

359
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,283
Primitive?

360
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,425
You remember that tiny thatched cottage

361
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:19,769
I used as an examination room
in Namibia?

362
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:22,230
Yes, of course then
I was working on Pygmies.

363
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:23,596
You know what killed him?

364
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:26,789
Well, if Dr. Takada
was a bit too fond of his Scotch,

365
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:29,187
what I'm seeing here
is oesophageal varices,

366
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:33,044
and this tear
caused blood to enter his oesophagus,

367
00:17:33,076 --> 00:17:34,534
causing him to vomit blood.

368
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:38,997
Or, Dr. Takada could have had
a severe gastrointestinal infection,

369
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,482
that produced a Mallory-Weiss tear.

370
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,544
In which case,
the vomiting would have come first.

371
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:48,434
Neither diagnosis
is inconsistent with haemorrhagic fever.

372
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:49,723
And if we were exposed?

373
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:50,879
Well, I'm...

374
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:53,137
hampered from
prognosticating further until

375
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:56,304
Dr. DiNozzo gives me a proper
blood analysis.

376
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,058
Abby, where's the gas chromato-thinga?

377
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,370
<i>It's the, uh,
boxy-looking thing with the,</i/>

378
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:04,675
<i>um, circular door-like
thing on the front.</i>

379
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:07,761
- I got it.
- <i>Okay, good. Now,</i>

380
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,793
<i>put the sample in the circular
rack-like thing at the top.</i>

381
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:13,874
Got it.

382
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,422
<i>Okay, press the blue start button.</i>

383
00:18:15,466 --> 00:18:17,937
<i>It's-it's blue-ish and square-ish.</i>

384
00:18:18,303 --> 00:18:20,112
<i>It's on a tower on the top, Tony.</i>

385
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:21,372
<i>The tower-like thing.</i>

386
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:23,550
- Got it.
- <i>While we're waiting the</i>

387
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:25,107
<i>analysis, let's get the blood count.</i>

388
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:27,565
<i>So, place a small amount
of blood on your slide.</i>

389
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,949
<i>It's amazing what you
can learn from blood,</i>

390
00:18:29,964 --> 00:18:31,842
<i>even before it's analyzed.
I mean,</i>

391
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,238
<i>the color, the texture, the smell.</i>

392
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:38,091
<i>Okay, um, now take
out the dropper of Methylene Blue.</i>

393
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,376
<i>It's blue-ish and it's dropper-like.</i>

394
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:41,768
Got it.

395
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:45,143
<i>Okay, now place two drops
of the Methylene Blue on your slide.</i>

396
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:49,707
- We're good.
- <i>Of course,<i/>

397
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:52,111
<i>blood that's passed through
someone's GI tract has a very</i>

398
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:53,527
<i>particular smell.</i>

399
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:57,586
<i>But since this guy may have died
from a highly contagious virus,</i>

400
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,327
<i>whatever you do, do not inhale it.</i>

401
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,018
We're not good.

402
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:05,729
Hey, you okay, DiNozzo?

403
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:07,143
Not for long.

404
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,962
Where's my blood analysis, DiNozzo?

405
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:12,045
I'm working on it, Ducky.

406
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:14,038
Maybe the last thing I do.

407
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:15,854
Let's hope not.

408
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:16,727
May I?

409
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:21,428
<i>There's definitely an increased white
blood count,</i>

410
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:23,932
with an absolute increase in lymphocytes

411
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,800
having an atypical appearance.

412
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:28,147
<i>That would be consistent
with an acute viral infection.</i>

413
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:31,877
I have located three rodent
bites on Takada's body.

414
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:35,363
Perhaps he contracted the virus
from a diseased rat.

415
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:36,826
That would be bad.

416
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,698
<i>Maybe the top-secret</i>

417
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:41,410
<i>whatever-it-was that Takada
is studying is what killed him.</i>

418
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,496
In which case it would be airborne.

419
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,206
That would be really, really bad.

420
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:49,009
Boss, I've got a feed from MTAC
with Director Shepard

421
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:52,076
and Commander Skinner. They want
you and Ducky patched in right away.

422
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,657
<i>I'm flying a crew out to
take control of the ship.</i>

423
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:03,577
<i>The risk is too great.</i>

424
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:06,019
<i>Director, you cannot
allow anyone on this ship.</i>

425
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:08,361
<i>I can put anyone I want to on that ship.</i>

426
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:11,951
<i>Then I have no choice
but to quarantine the Chimera.</i>

427
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,142
<i>On whose authority?!?</i>

428
00:20:13,216 --> 00:20:14,063
Ours.

429
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:16,362
Dr. Mallard is a medical examiner,

430
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:18,598
Agent Gibbs is a federal officer.

431
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:20,928
- <i>That's my ship!</i>
- <i>Not anymore.</i>

432
00:20:20,938 --> 00:20:23,056
<i>What kind of game you think
you're playing, Gibbs?</i>

433
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:24,455
<i>Any word from the missing crew?</i>

434
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:27,232
<i>We have every possible resource
looking for those men.</i>

435
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:30,738
<i>Look, given what we know,
this is high precedence.</i>

436
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,944
<i>Those men may well have been exposed
to the virus, too.</i>

437
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:36,108
They may also need to be quarantined.

438
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:38,991
<i>You don't need to explain
to me the dangers involved here.</i>

439
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:41,220
<i>It might've helped
if you had explained them to us.</i>

440
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:42,862
<i>If that is all, Director,</i>

441
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,976
<i>I'd like to go find out what
this virus is before it kills me.</i>

442
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,137
<i>And quite possibly,
everyone else on this ship, too.</i>

443
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:51,191
Commander,

444
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:54,832
I think it's time you tell me
what I need to know about your ship.

445
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,230
<i>I cannot divulge</i>

446
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:58,834
<i>any more about the Chimera's mission
than I already have.</i>

447
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:02,074
Seeing as how my agents now
have control over your ship,

448
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,744
I am going to instruct them
to investigate

449
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:07,929
any and all aspects
of the Chimera's operation

450
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,958
that will help them determine
what they are up against.

451
00:21:11,097 --> 00:21:13,470
Nothing will be off limits.

452
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,580
<i>You can't do that.</i>

453
00:21:14,617 --> 00:21:15,966
You can't stop me.

454
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:17,743
<i>This is a classified mission.</i>

455
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:19,562
Then read me into it.

456
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:24,265
<i>Even if I wanted to read
you into the Chimera's mission,</i>

457
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:26,735
<i>I can't do that over an MTAC feed.</i>

458
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:29,426
<i>The file has to be read to you
in person.</i>

459
00:21:29,481 --> 00:21:32,135
If you think I'm going to stand

460
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,989
idly by while my agents' lives
are in danger,

461
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:37,449
you are sadly mistaken.

462
00:21:37,592 --> 00:21:40,190
I will be waiting for you and your file,

463
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:41,277
Commander.

464
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:42,337
<i>Now, you.</i>

465
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,636
We've been through almost
every room on this ship.

466
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:49,212
"Almost" only counts in horseshoes
and hand grenades.

467
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,239
Could... be a rat.

468
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:54,794
Have to be an awfully big one.

469
00:21:54,871 --> 00:21:55,884
Or a ghost.

470
00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:58,005
- Are you done?
- Done searching the ship?

471
00:21:59,253 --> 00:22:00,713
We could always search it again.

472
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:02,306
I could stay here with Ducky.

473
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:05,126
Well, so he's not left alone.

474
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,322
I'm not alone.

475
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:09,058
I've got Takada to keep me company.

476
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:09,984
Duck.

477
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:11,779
Got it.

478
00:22:12,902 --> 00:22:14,251
So, Takada,

479
00:22:14,297 --> 00:22:16,702
as one doctor to another,

480
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:18,171
what is this

481
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:21,636
horrid virus which caused your demise?

482
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:23,864
Anyone else feeling itchy?

483
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,209
Maybe that's a bug bite.

484
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:26,694
Or a rat bite.

485
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,939
No, no, no, look at that spot.

486
00:22:29,158 --> 00:22:30,955
- It's a freckle.
- It's not a freckle.

487
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:33,227
- Freckle.
- Never had a freckle there.

488
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:34,834
You've always had that freckle.

489
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:38,284
How would you know whether I had
a freckle or didn't have a freckle?

490
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:40,079
And by the way,
I have never had that freckle!

491
00:22:40,877 --> 00:22:41,917
<i>Yes, Jethro?</i>

492
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:44,226
Give me the symptoms
for hemorrhagic fever.

493
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,580
<i>Well, initially,
one might experience a feeling</i>

494
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,404
<i>paranoia and a growing sense of dread.</i>

495
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:53,579
<i>Then, more obvious physiological
symptoms would manifest themselves.</i>

496
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:55,073
Such as?

497
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:58,274
<i>Such as the appearance
of atopic melanosomes.</i>

498
00:22:58,563 --> 00:22:59,624
Come again?

499
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:01,927
<i>Spots. Possibly itchy.</i>

500
00:23:02,196 --> 00:23:04,780
<i>Then, a fast-rising fever, of course.</i>

501
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:07,286
I knew it.
I'm gonna die.

502
00:23:07,374 --> 00:23:09,174
I inhaled it.
God!

503
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:13,110
Definitely didn't picture
my demise like this. I always

504
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,750
figured I'd go out like Cagney
in <i>White Heat</i>. Fiery explosion.

505
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:18,627
Or Redford and Newman
in Butch Cassidy hail of bullets.

506
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:20,421
Or Charlie Chaplin in The Gold Rush.

507
00:23:20,988 --> 00:23:22,049
How did he die?

508
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,477
Silently.

509
00:23:26,595 --> 00:23:27,404
Ziva!

510
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:38,773
- Didn't you see that?
- See what?

511
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:40,649
Someone, something was running.

512
00:23:42,283 --> 00:23:44,405
Surely I'm not the only
one who saw that.

513
00:23:44,478 --> 00:23:45,597
The Chimera?

514
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,976
I swear there was something there.

515
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,348
It's not here now.

516
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:52,864
It ran down the passageway,
it made a right here and then it...

517
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,336
<i>And then?</i>

518
00:23:56,098 --> 00:23:57,179
It disappeared.

519
00:23:57,226 --> 00:23:58,709
I know there was something there.

520
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:00,002
Like my freckle!

521
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,375
Boss?

522
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:06,225
Biohazard.

523
00:24:06,705 --> 00:24:07,718
Sounds inviting.

524
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:09,364
<i>McGee?</i>

525
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,862
Looks like some kind of cyber-lock

526
00:24:13,263 --> 00:24:15,154
with a bar code and touch memory.

527
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:16,847
It's right up your alley, McGeek.

528
00:24:16,848 --> 00:24:18,040
It's going to take time.

529
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:19,897
We're not going anywhere.

530
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,809
Thought you said
you weren't going anywhere.

531
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,857
If you want, Ziva
I could check you for spots.

532
00:24:35,878 --> 00:24:38,585
- No, thanks.
- I'm sure you've got hot spots,

533
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:40,668
- warm spots...
- DiNozzo.

534
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:42,900
Get this to Ducky.

535
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:44,601
Me?

536
00:24:45,003 --> 00:24:46,276
That's a dead, diseased...

537
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:47,887
rat...

538
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:52,596
which is why it may aid Dr. Mallard
with his investigation.

539
00:24:52,988 --> 00:24:54,338
Which is why I'd be

540
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,924
pleased as punch to walk back
through this

541
00:24:57,425 --> 00:24:58,490
ship with a...

542
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,014
dead, diseased rat.

543
00:25:01,774 --> 00:25:03,191
You can show Ducky your freckle.

544
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:10,521
You stinky, stinky.

545
00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:20,271
Yes, Alex, I'll take "Horror Films
That Take Place on Ships" for $500.

546
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,799
Thank you.

547
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:25,298
Oh, goodie.
Double Jeopardy!

548
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,410
Oh, geez.

549
00:25:28,713 --> 00:25:29,735
Oh, dear.

550
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:34,022
Oh, crap.

551
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:45,953
- I don't suppose you hear footsteps?
- Yeah, I hear 'em.

552
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,468
It's just me.

553
00:25:55,164 --> 00:25:56,164
And Ben.

554
00:25:57,383 --> 00:25:59,029
- Bag that thing.
- Ziva?

555
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:01,272
Thanks.

556
00:26:02,713 --> 00:26:05,105
Well, this moment is almost perfect.

557
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,359
All we need is a storm.

558
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:15,574
McGee?

559
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:17,137
- Yeah.
- You all right?

560
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:20,247
I've had better days, Boss.

561
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:22,472
Tripped over a barrel.
Made this kinda...

562
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,400
Bangy, crashy sound, like thunder?

563
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:27,138
You crack the lock?

564
00:26:28,402 --> 00:26:29,694
No. Not yet.

565
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:31,600
The touch screen... it's a bit...

566
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:33,358
I'm working on it.

567
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,362
Why don't you work
on turning the lights back on?

568
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,793
I think we just passed
the electrical room.

569
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:42,067
It's like <i>Aliens</i>.
Numero Uno.

570
00:26:42,156 --> 00:26:43,291
Ripley, light in hand,

571
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:44,827
moving through endless corridors

572
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,350
searching for a hideous monster.

573
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:48,835
You ever see <i>Run Silent, Run Deep</i>?

574
00:26:49,016 --> 00:26:50,766
The "run silent" part sounds good.

575
00:26:51,426 --> 00:26:53,476
The electrical room should be...

576
00:26:56,578 --> 00:26:57,637
right here.

577
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:20,155
Let me out of here!

578
00:27:20,303 --> 00:27:22,103
Here's the crew list. He's the cook.

579
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:23,733
Get these shackles off of me!

580
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,804
- Why were you hiding?
- Why did you attack us?

581
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:28,139
- Why'd the crew abandon ship?
- What happened to Takada?

582
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:29,261
You asking me?

583
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:31,616
It was that thing, wasn't it?

584
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:33,595
What thing?
I knew there was a thing.

585
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:35,633
- What thing?
- They brought a thing out of the water.

586
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:38,108
Takada was studying it.
That's what killed him. Isn't it?

587
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:40,312
- Don't know.
- Don't lie to me!

588
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:42,783
It's killing me, too, isn't it?!

589
00:27:42,856 --> 00:27:45,266
You know what if I don't kill you first.
Sit down,

590
00:27:45,276 --> 00:27:46,670
and tell us what happened here.

591
00:27:46,814 --> 00:27:48,098
What happened to the crew?

592
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,443
They abandoned ship.

593
00:27:51,723 --> 00:27:52,523
Why?

594
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:54,925
They thought whatever killed Takada
was contagious.

595
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:57,664
Captain forced me to stay behind.

596
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:00,581
He thought I had already been exposed
from all the blood

597
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:02,736
- he puked on me.
- Nobody sent a Mayday.

598
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:05,971
The radio operator was supposed to.
He was the last to leave the ship.

599
00:28:06,354 --> 00:28:07,675
So you were left here alone?

600
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,770
I thought I was.

601
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:11,254
And then someone hit me.

602
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:12,321
Who?

603
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:14,301
I don't know.
They hit me from behind.

604
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:16,182
Maybe they did, maybe they didn't.

605
00:28:16,202 --> 00:28:17,202
Why would I lie?

606
00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:19,398
- Why were you hiding?
- Why did you run?

607
00:28:19,647 --> 00:28:21,364
I thought you were the ones that hit me.

608
00:28:22,061 --> 00:28:23,585
There's someone else on this ship.

609
00:28:24,714 --> 00:28:26,101
What's in that biohazard room?

610
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:28,016
Don't ask me.
I'm just the cook.

611
00:28:28,017 --> 00:28:30,191
Come on!
You never overheard one conversation,

612
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:32,094
one argument about
what's locked up in there?

613
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:35,599
- That area was off limits to me!
- Sit down! You live with these people,

614
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,389
you sleep with them,
you work with them,

615
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,026
you can't tell me what's in that room?!

616
00:28:41,563 --> 00:28:42,700
That's where it is.

617
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,245
The bug.

618
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:49,474
I don't get it.

619
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,897
The breakers aren't tripped,

620
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:52,512
the conduits are fine.

621
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:56,266
Tony, check behind this panel over here.

622
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:03,949
- Tony?
- Feel my head.

623
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,900
Why?

624
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:07,386
Just feel it.

625
00:29:10,763 --> 00:29:12,243
I don't want to.
It's all sweaty.

626
00:29:12,821 --> 00:29:13,825
Exactly.

627
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:15,970
I got the freakin' fever.

628
00:29:16,206 --> 00:29:17,383
I'm burning up, man.

629
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:20,100
The ventilation is off, Tony.
We're all burning up.

630
00:29:20,197 --> 00:29:21,449
This is different.

631
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:25,513
I'm dying, McGee.

632
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:30,373
You know, the last time you were dying
of a horrible disease,

633
00:29:30,383 --> 00:29:32,685
you were a little bit more stoic
about the whole thing.

634
00:29:32,695 --> 00:29:33,790
I was younger then,

635
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:35,583
carefree.

636
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,132
It was two years ago.

637
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,373
The last time I almost died,
someone blew up my car,

638
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:43,189
so I've almost died twice,
and this is the third time,

639
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:46,088
and bad stuff happens in threes,
and I'm out of almosts.

640
00:29:49,215 --> 00:29:51,183
I'm telling you, man,
this time I'm dying.

641
00:29:52,254 --> 00:29:53,254
I know it.

642
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:02,967
But until...

643
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:04,728
you are actually dead...

644
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,154
can you please help me fix this thing?

645
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:14,051
Go take a look behind that panel
over there,

646
00:30:14,404 --> 00:30:16,333
see if maybe one of the leads got fried.

647
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,079
Thanks.

648
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,601
I think I found the problem,

649
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,044
assuming...

650
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:40,909
this ship runs on

651
00:30:40,975 --> 00:30:42,149
tiny little batteries.

652
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,623
Lithium.

653
00:30:45,086 --> 00:30:46,224
Like camera batteries.

654
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:48,443
Odd. Someone must have
hidden them in there.

655
00:30:49,576 --> 00:30:50,576
Transponders.

656
00:30:50,956 --> 00:30:51,956
From what?

657
00:30:52,335 --> 00:30:53,820
Well my guess... EPIRBs.

658
00:30:55,878 --> 00:30:57,212
That's my guess, too.

659
00:30:58,214 --> 00:30:59,459
What are EPIRBs again?

660
00:31:01,377 --> 00:31:05,175
<i>"Containment of aforementioned
microbial species, deadly or otherwise,</i>

661
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,720
<i>is to remain under the guardianship
of the operation's chief scientist</i>

662
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:11,203
<i>until such time
it can be safely transported</i>

663
00:31:11,213 --> 00:31:12,645
<i>to Naval Research Headquarters."</i>

664
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,102
Biowarfare research is illegal.
We signed a treaty.

665
00:31:16,344 --> 00:31:17,439
So did the Russians,

666
00:31:17,714 --> 00:31:20,525
and we've spotted their fishing trawlers
in areas of the Bering Sea

667
00:31:20,535 --> 00:31:22,074
that aren't considered fishable.

668
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:24,929
So two wrongful fishing expeditions
make a right?

669
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:28,529
We're just trying to get our hands
on the next generation

670
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,961
of biological weaponry
before our enemies do.

671
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,739
Do you file that under deception
or hypocrisy?

672
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:40,670
Non-disclosure agreement.

673
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:47,269
Do you understand why the Navy doesn't
want anyone to know where the ship is

674
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:48,402
or what it's doing?

675
00:31:49,686 --> 00:31:53,679
And do you understand the Navy's secret
could cost my agents their lives?

676
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,949
I got a support vessel on its way
with medical facilities on board

677
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,324
and a decontamination unit.

678
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,710
Great.

679
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
Show it to me.

680
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:03,453
How exactly do you propose I do that?

681
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,551
There must be an ORION or two
that you could scramble overhead.

682
00:32:07,423 --> 00:32:09,075
I think you're gonna have to trust me.

683
00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:11,361
I don't know you well enough, Commander.

684
00:32:12,326 --> 00:32:13,327
We can fix that.

685
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:18,585
You can cut the charm.

686
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,748
Higher-ranking, richer,

687
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:23,795
and definitely better-looking men
have tried that on me

688
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:27,238
and didn't get very far.
Now, I can't speak for you, Commander,

689
00:32:27,755 --> 00:32:29,873
but I didn't get where I am
because of my looks,

690
00:32:29,912 --> 00:32:32,986
so get your eyes off of me
and put some on that ship.

691
00:32:46,852 --> 00:32:47,867
What's that?

692
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:49,684
Transponders taken off the life jacket.

693
00:32:49,685 --> 00:32:50,698
Why I'd do that?

694
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:53,098
You didn't want the crew located
once they abandoned ship.

695
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:55,125
I didn't sabotage any life jackets!

696
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:57,619
- There's no one else on the ship.
- There has to be.

697
00:32:57,785 --> 00:33:00,084
You were in the electrical room
when the power went out.

698
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:02,168
I wouldn't know
how to shut off the power.

699
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:03,587
I told you, I'm just the cook!

700
00:33:03,961 --> 00:33:04,975
Just the cook?

701
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:07,644
That's what Steven Seagal said
in <i>Under Siege</i>,

702
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:09,268
look at the havoc he wreaked.

703
00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:11,823
What about <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>?
The saboteur...

704
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:12,962
was the cook.

705
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,479
I'm sorry, boss, I'm just saying,

706
00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:18,793
that, you know,
just 'cause he says he's the cook

707
00:33:18,794 --> 00:33:20,680
doesn't mean he's
any less potentially guilty.

708
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,380
He could have slipped poison
into Takada's food.

709
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,590
I swear,

710
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,098
I didn't kill Takada!

711
00:33:26,744 --> 00:33:28,364
<i>Not with poison, at least.</i>

712
00:33:30,996 --> 00:33:33,133
The good news is I've confirmed

713
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:36,475
beyond a doubt that Takada
did indeed die of hemorrhagic fever.

714
00:33:36,784 --> 00:33:38,233
That's great news, Ducky.

715
00:33:38,455 --> 00:33:41,112
However, the virus was injected
into him...

716
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:42,950
it was not airborne.

717
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:47,010
I've also examined the dead rat
that Tony so heroically brought to me.

718
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:49,592
Ironically, it died from having
bitten Takada.

719
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:51,450
So I'm not gonna die?

720
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:54,633
Well, the bottom line is
there was no outbreak on the ship.

721
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:56,661
He was injected without knowing it.

722
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:58,972
If I could do a proper
and thorough toxicology,

723
00:33:58,982 --> 00:34:00,072
I think we'd find

724
00:34:00,511 --> 00:34:02,190
that he had first been drugged.

725
00:34:03,152 --> 00:34:04,773
Takada was murdered.

726
00:34:05,189 --> 00:34:06,435
Why would someone do that?

727
00:34:06,562 --> 00:34:08,069
To scare everyone off the ship.

728
00:34:08,366 --> 00:34:09,366
But why?

729
00:34:10,694 --> 00:34:12,638
I mean what's so valuable on this ship

730
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:14,572
that someone would kill for it?

731
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,552
About time, McGee.

732
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:20,031
I had nothing to do with it.

733
00:34:20,095 --> 00:34:21,422
Someone's messing with us.

734
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:23,147
Maybe Mitas is right.

735
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:24,370
Someone else is aboard.

736
00:34:25,573 --> 00:34:26,658
<i>Gibbs, up here!</i>

737
00:34:31,562 --> 00:34:33,047
I saw something running on deck.

738
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:34,246
Something or someone?

739
00:34:34,247 --> 00:34:36,500
- I don't know, it was moving fast.
- It or him?

740
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:37,959
I don't know, I have lost it.

741
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:39,585
I'll say.

742
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:42,655
- Gibbs, I swear...
- I believe you, Ziva.

743
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,245
See? Someone else
who believes in what they cannot see.

744
00:34:45,271 --> 00:34:47,896
No, I believe what I can see
wasn't there before.

745
00:34:53,771 --> 00:34:55,102
Someone's sending a signal.

746
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:05,604
I believe you.

747
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:19,880
Mitas was telling the truth.

748
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:23,241
He's not a ghost, but he's got
a certain "B horror flick" thing going.

749
00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:24,978
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

750
00:35:24,979 --> 00:35:26,008
I think we do...

751
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:28,221
Lieutenant Ferris.

752
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:30,744
Communications Officer.

753
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:33,457
Who failed to communicate
his crewmates abandoned ship.

754
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,910
You're not very good at your job,
are you Lieutenant?

755
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:38,101
- You're wasting your time.
- I think we're wasting yours.

756
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,095
The Navy's on its way.
You're going to the brig.

757
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,279
- You'll be dead before they arrive.
- Save it. We know about the virus.

758
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:44,463
Outbreak was a hoax.

759
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,828
It's not the virus that'll kill you.

760
00:35:49,946 --> 00:35:51,073
Satisfied, Director?

761
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:53,170
I'm not that easy, Commander.

762
00:35:53,582 --> 00:35:54,882
That doesn't surprise me.

763
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,878
<i>That must be your support vessel.</i>

764
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,163
Can we get any closer?

765
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:01,512
I'm sure we can.

766
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:10,108
It's going to reach the Chimera
a lot faster than you said it would.

767
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:13,437
That's not our support vessel.

768
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:24,497
<i>The approaching craft has
no known identification.</i>

769
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,970
<i>That seems to be the way
things operate around here.</i>

770
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:29,516
Looks to be the size
of a small assault vessel.

771
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,832
Same type of boats
I've seen used by marauders.

772
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:33,941
- <i>Pirates?</i>
- Cruise ships,

773
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:35,362
tankers, steamers...

774
00:36:35,382 --> 00:36:37,079
they'll attack anything to make a buck.

775
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:38,349
<i>How long?</i>

776
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:40,461
You should be able to put eyes
on it any minute.

777
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:42,572
These people come heavily armed,
Agent Gibbs.

778
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:44,859
Automatic weapons, grenades, even RPGs.

779
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,218
- <i>What are they after?</i>
- I can't divulge that information.

780
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:48,161
<i>Hold on.</i>

781
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:50,575
<i>You tell me heavily armed pirates
are coming to attack me,</i>

782
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:52,561
<i>you better tell me
what they're looking for.</i>

783
00:36:52,728 --> 00:36:54,147
Your agent hasn't been read in.

784
00:36:54,272 --> 00:36:56,567
<i>I don't give a damn about your secrets,
Commander.</i>

785
00:36:56,694 --> 00:36:58,487
<i>I care about keeping my team safe.</i>

786
00:36:58,818 --> 00:37:00,049
Tell me what they want.

787
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:01,488
I can't do that.

788
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:03,475
<i>Can someone give me a damn answer?</i>

789
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:05,923
- Put me through to STRATCOM.
- All right!

790
00:37:06,155 --> 00:37:07,155
Wait!

791
00:37:07,235 --> 00:37:08,235
Look.

792
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:12,105
The secret material they have dredged up
from the ocean...

793
00:37:12,206 --> 00:37:14,875
<i>What am I looking for?
Something the size of a bread box?</i>

794
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:15,935
<i>A gallon drum?</i>

795
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:17,119
It can fit in a vial.

796
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:18,691
But it's untested.

797
00:37:19,091 --> 00:37:21,832
- Unproven.
- <i>Ferris has already killed one guy.</i>

798
00:37:22,101 --> 00:37:23,606
<i>He's put 20 others at risk.</i>

799
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,694
<i>This is worth something to someone.</i>

800
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:27,138
<i>Boss, I cracked it.</i>

801
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:33,645
Now, before we go in there,

802
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:36,360
the power is back on, so the ventilation

803
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:38,931
and filtration system should
also be back on.

804
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:40,818
I know it says "biohazard,"

805
00:37:40,837 --> 00:37:43,031
but if there's anything
biological in there,

806
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:45,238
the room should be negatively pressured.

807
00:37:45,402 --> 00:37:46,693
Thing is, this...

808
00:37:47,814 --> 00:37:49,106
room is not.

809
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:51,341
Boss...

810
00:37:52,515 --> 00:37:55,807
You-you really could risk exposure
if you stay in there very long.

811
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,267
What is it?

812
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:06,109
<i>Gibbs!</i>

813
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:09,482
We've spotted the assault craft.

814
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:11,383
Five minutes, maybe less.

815
00:39:50,293 --> 00:39:51,316
<i>Aleksei?</i>

816
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:03,083
<i>Aleksei?</i>

817
00:40:14,487 --> 00:40:15,502
Ferris.

818
00:41:28,824 --> 00:41:30,845
Ducky, how long before Ferris wakes up?

819
00:41:30,965 --> 00:41:32,190
A couple of hours.

820
00:41:32,342 --> 00:41:36,220
It'll take him considerably longer
to wipe off the fake blood.

821
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:38,301
How'd you disable the ship, McGee?

822
00:41:38,638 --> 00:41:39,902
Spew all over the engine?

823
00:41:40,128 --> 00:41:42,221
Steering has several
nonlinear effects...

824
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:43,635
saturation,

825
00:41:43,852 --> 00:41:45,140
dead-zone, rate-limiting...

826
00:41:45,988 --> 00:41:48,400
Bottom line is, ship's still able...

827
00:41:48,516 --> 00:41:50,199
able to sail in one big circle.

828
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,117
Russian.

829
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:54,672
Orders from the Russian Navy.

830
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:56,246
They weren't pirates?

831
00:41:56,484 --> 00:41:58,745
Soviet state-sponsored pirates.

832
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:00,381
But why?

833
00:42:00,693 --> 00:42:01,693
McGee?

834
00:42:05,302 --> 00:42:06,939
Russian nuclear warhead?

835
00:42:07,098 --> 00:42:08,314
There's your ghost, Ziva.

836
00:42:08,353 --> 00:42:11,189
The ghost of Soviet Project K629.

837
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:15,377
So, this whole thing was a Russian
black ops mission to recover their nuke?

838
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:19,467
So, pirates that weren't really pirates
but were actually Russian sailors

839
00:42:19,468 --> 00:42:22,310
were on a covert mission to steal
a Navy research ship

840
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:24,983
that wasn't actually
a Navy research ship

841
00:42:25,488 --> 00:42:28,159
in order to get back nuclear weapons
that we thought

842
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:29,960
they didn't think we had retrieved?

843
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:33,722
<i>Perhaps we should call the Navy.</i>

844
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:36,239
Tell them that we're
on the Russian black ship,

845
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:38,079
and the Russians are on theirs.

846
00:42:50,227 --> 00:42:53,488
I guess the Navy didn't want anyone
to know their black ship ever existed.

847
00:42:53,778 --> 00:42:55,649
How did they know we were off the ship?

848
00:42:56,863 --> 00:42:58,233
Don't think they did.
