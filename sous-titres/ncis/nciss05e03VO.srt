2
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:05,576
<i>And he wouldn't stop crying.</i>

3
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:08,577
<i>- The whole flight.
- Guess why I was sitting back.</i>

4
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:10,233
<i>Avoid the little prep orders.</i>

5
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:14,379
Thank you so much
for kicking me out Stef.

6
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:17,894
- Trent is always working late.
- Been there, hate that.

7
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:19,505
I figure it's about time that

8
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:22,735
I throw a little fit in case
if he's forgotten how I feel about it.

9
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:23,992
Trent?

10
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:28,135
Well, that sounds like he's working
really hard, doesn't it?

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,676
Trent, turn it down.

12
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:33,912
What are you trying to do,
wake the dead?

13
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:36,096
Hey, Trent.

14
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:38,378
How's it go...?

15
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:47,952
Team-NCIS.com presents:

00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:52,820
NCIS Season 5 Episode 3
Ex-files (Version LOL V1.1)

17
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:57,714
Capture: Swsub.com
Synchro: Akazab, Kasius and Gaillots.

18
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,531
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Gibbs.

19
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:40,592
Did you get it?

20
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:41,511
It?

21
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:44,228
Abby?

22
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,935
I put this year's tax
refund to good use.

23
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,965
I got one for everybody on Team Gibbs.

24
00:01:49,086 --> 00:01:51,844
<i>Luck be a lady tonight</i>

25
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:56,110
<i>Luck, if you've ever been
a lady to begin with.</i>

26
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:58,580
<i>Luck be a...</i>

27
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:00,838
Hey, boss.
Sorry about that.

28
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:03,373
Sinatra, you got to sing alone.

29
00:02:03,476 --> 00:02:04,904
I mean, it's Old Blue Eyes.

30
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:07,716
It's the Chairman of the Board.
I'm gonna Rat Pack it up.

31
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:14,556
<i>Becoming an alpha male
means that without saying</i>

32
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:16,974
<i>a word you're able to project confidence</i>

33
00:02:17,022 --> 00:02:19,626
<i>and sexuality simply through
you body language...</i>

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,629
MIT lecture.

35
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:24,378
Nothing I can't listen
to on my own time.

36
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,916
It's the newest version, Gibbs.
It's 160 gigabytes.

37
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:29,970
You could download like 40,000 songs.

38
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:31,860
I only listen to five, Abbs.

39
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:34,142
- 5,000?
- No. Five.

40
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:36,652
Oh, Gibbs.
We really have to broaden your horizons.

41
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,454
I could download some
of my music for you.

42
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:41,114
Like Android Lust
or Flesh-Eating Foundation,

43
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:43,327
Green Satan, or Suicide Commando.

44
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,715
Dead Marine.

45
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:45,818
Never heard of 'em.

46
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,199
Fort Belvoir Army Base.

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Let's go.

48
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:52,705
Good morning, Jethro.

49
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:54,384
Busy morning.

50
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:55,657
Dead Marine.

51
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,258
- Army base.
- Her rocks matches his scissors.

52
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,747
Which puts the Colonel on top.

53
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:05,649
You work for me on this one, Jethro.

54
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,767
It's my army base and my crime scene.

55
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,231
And my people, my office.

56
00:03:15,564 --> 00:03:17,435
They know we're still seeing each other?

57
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:22,126
- Is she...?
- Still on top?

58
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:23,866
Seeing Gibbs?

59
00:03:24,898 --> 00:03:25,902
Same thing.

60
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,850
But an excellent question nonetheless,
Probie.

61
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:34,642
Marine Captain Trent Reynolds.

62
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:39,169
Worked for the Defense Intelligence
Agency on an inter-agency task force.

63
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:40,967
His wife

64
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:44,363
found him last night when she got back
from a convention in Charlottesville.

65
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:45,588
Where's the wife now?

66
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:46,871
Mother's house.

67
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:49,467
How long has he been...
stuck here?

68
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:52,642
Only the dead know the true
meaning of patience, Timothy.

69
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,693
No more places to go, people to see.

70
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:57,202
Except me, of course.

71
00:03:57,717 --> 00:03:58,971
Colonel, Jethro.

72
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,017
So...

73
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,516
To whom do I report?

74
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:03,606
- Her.
- Me.

75
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:05,962
Better get used to that.

76
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:08,623
Spearguns.

77
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:10,089
Pretty cool.

78
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:13,303
Thunderball.
Very James Bond... boss...

79
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,419
Ma'am... Colonel.

80
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,655
Captain Reynolds
was a recreational diver.

81
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,183
Burglary?

82
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:25,007
Well, the back door was jimmied,

83
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:27,507
but the wallet and cash
were still on him,

84
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:29,655
and the wife doesn't think
that anything's missing.

85
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:31,749
Dr. Mallard, you got anything?

86
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:35,357
You do realize I arrived
about a minute ago.

87
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:37,381
The dead speak to me, Colonel,

88
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:40,965
but give the poor man time
to catch his breath, so to speak.

89
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:45,609
Time of death:
between 7:00 and 9:00 p.m.

90
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,923
Yeah, Gibbs.

91
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:49,156
Tony, review the witness statements.

92
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:50,978
Yes, boss.
Ma'am...

93
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,559
- Colonel.
- Ziva...

94
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,907
I will check Captain Reynolds' phone
and bank records.

95
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:58,619
Agent McGee, see if you can pull
some prints off the back door.

96
00:04:58,676 --> 00:04:59,676
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:04,071
Do you know a Major Sweigart?

98
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:09,907
Major Sweigart was Captain Reynolds'
superior at Defense Intelligence.

99
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,844
He understands the Army CID and NCIS

100
00:05:12,873 --> 00:05:15,699
will be working hand in hand
on this case.

101
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:18,585
I mean...
Side by side.

102
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:21,892
Cooperatively.

103
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:23,789
You've taken Captain Reynolds' laptop.

104
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:25,987
- I want it back.
- That's evidence, Major.

105
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:28,750
DIA deals with highly classified
materials, ma'am.

106
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,872
And we have top secret clearance.

107
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:32,773
I'm talking about special
access programs

108
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:34,644
which go well beyond your clearance.

109
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,823
Black ops?

110
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:38,522
Major Sweigart, these are your options,

111
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,923
either read in our forensic scientist
to your special access

112
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:44,951
programs or send someone
who can oversee her work.

113
00:05:47,662 --> 00:05:50,048
- Send someone over from Cyber.
- Yes, sir.

114
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:53,613
Any thoughts on who might have wanted
to kill Captain Reynolds?

115
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:56,062
He got along with everyone at work.

116
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:57,585
What about his personal life?

117
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,537
Other than the usual
command dinners I didn't really know

118
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:03,577
Capitain Reynolds on a personal basis.

119
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,258
You, Lieutenant?

120
00:06:06,124 --> 00:06:08,747
We played some pickup basketball
together. That's about it.

121
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,962
I think he spent
his free time with his wife.

122
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:13,215
Why?

123
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:16,083
Because he was always
rushing home to be with her.

124
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:20,641
Crash and burn...
only a matter of time.

125
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,590
What?

126
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:22,786
Not a what...

127
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:24,426
A whom.

128
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,310
Colonel Mann, Gibbs,
Army-Navy joint operation.

129
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:29,656
It could last a lifetime.

130
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:32,512
Behind the torture

131
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:36,233
techniques and the contract killings,
Ziva, you're really just a...

132
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:38,678
A whom?

133
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:41,485
What?
Whom?

134
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:44,325
Not a whom...
It's more... it's a what.

135
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:45,534
A what then?

136
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:46,636
What then?

137
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:49,700
What?
What then? I think...

138
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,202
I'm still just a what?

139
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:54,346
A girl.

140
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:57,613
Abby Sciuto.

141
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:00,804
I was sent here to check in
so I could see her.

142
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,012
Probie.

143
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:05,051
Fred Rinnert,

144
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:06,377
DIA.

145
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:09,040
That's Defense Intelligence Agency.

146
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:12,244
I was sent he to keep track
of a laptop of ours.

147
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,455
Laptop is down in the lab.

148
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:16,722
I'm here to make sure
Ms. Sciuto doesn't uncover any

149
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:18,758
super-duper, secret spook stuff.

150
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,415
Meaning, you will be scrutinizing
her every move?

151
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:22,502
Exactly.

152
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:32,751
I gotta warn you, Abby doesn't work well
with people looking over her shoulder.

153
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:34,283
We'll do fine.

154
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:35,607
I'm a people person.

155
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:37,953
Make him go away, McGee.

156
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:39,408
Abby, I can't.

157
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,340
Look at him.

158
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,105
I feel blocked.
I can't work when I'm blocked.

159
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:47,567
Well, then just block him out.

160
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,398
- What?
- You block him out.

161
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,314
He's not there.

162
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:54,028
He's not there.

163
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:55,900
He's still there.

164
00:07:57,126 --> 00:07:58,360
Close your eyes,

165
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:02,422
open them, and imagine him gone.

166
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:06,741
- Didn't work.
- Try it again.

167
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:08,841
He's not there.

168
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:11,051
He's not there.

169
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:14,594
Still not working, McGee.

170
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:16,911
McGee?

171
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:23,122
Try the return key.

172
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:24,166
This one?

173
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:25,853
- Here, let me.
- No, I got it.

174
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,956
- No, I don't think you do.
- I got it.

175
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,657
Sometimes it takes a soft touch, okay.

176
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:33,305
There.

177
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:34,752
Delete this search?

178
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:36,217
No.

179
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,243
No.

180
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:45,846
Prints from Reynolds'back door scored
a match, but your computer's a little...

181
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,474
It's linked to Abby's lab.
It's perfectly fine, Colonel.

182
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,414
Which is more than can be
said for Major Sweigart.

183
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:59,905
I dropped off some documents to
Captain Reynolds a couple of weeks ago.

184
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:01,739
And you left via the back door?

185
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:04,140
His wife was having friends around.

186
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:05,960
I didn't want to disturb them.

187
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:08,518
Mrs. Reynolds can verify
that you were at the house?

188
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:10,009
Don't know.

189
00:09:10,298 --> 00:09:11,842
Guess you'll have to ask her, ma'am.

190
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:14,688
Means you saw what was
hanging in his office.

191
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:16,454
Sorry.

192
00:09:17,543 --> 00:09:18,796
Knew how to use it.

193
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,677
You look pretty handy
with that speargun.

194
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:22,912
Well,

195
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:26,635
picture's worth
a thousand words to a jury.

196
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,200
Yeah, or just one:

197
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:29,932
Guilty.

198
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,495
Lots of guys dive.

199
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:33,412
Look, Colonel,

200
00:09:34,477 --> 00:09:36,290
I was with someone last night.

201
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:37,706
A date.

202
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:39,235
She's got a name?

203
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:40,328
We went to dinner.

204
00:09:41,325 --> 00:09:42,174
Name.

205
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:43,634
Stephanie Flynn.

206
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:49,463
The woman who was with Mrs. Reynolds
when she found him dead?

207
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,736
That's right.

208
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:52,546
Stephanie Bronwyn Flynn?

209
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:54,537
Yeah.

210
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:58,048
You know her?

211
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:04,521
I was married to her.

212
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:15,986
We have a little issue.

213
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:18,336
We?

214
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:20,012
You, you want to tell her, Agent Gibbs?

215
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,227
No, not particularly.

216
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,363
Is this issue going to involve lawyers?

217
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:26,848
It already did.

218
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:32,718
It's his ex-wife.
She's a material witness.

219
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,721
And which ex would that be?

220
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:37,891
Stephanie.

221
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,452
What number is she again?

222
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:40,929
- Second?
- Third.

223
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:42,098
Oh, right.

224
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:45,427
You lived in Europe with her
for a while, Frankfurt.

225
00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:47,137
- Moscow.
- Two years?

226
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,002
One.

227
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:50,156
Well, it's hard to live in Moscow.

228
00:10:50,547 --> 00:10:51,555
With anyone.

229
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:55,737
Do you think he should divorce himself
from this case, Colonel Mann?

230
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:57,250
No, ma'am.
No.

231
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,427
Nor do I. I don't see a problem
if you conduct the interview.

232
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:04,821
Do you have a problem with Colonel Mann
interviewing your ex-wife, Agent Gibbs?

233
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,204
Do I have a choice?

234
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:07,265
- No.
- No.

235
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:09,719
Problem solved.

236
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,990
What time did Major Sweigart
arrive at your apartment?

237
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:18,212
About 6:30.

238
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,136
And leave?

239
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,260
About 10:00.

240
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:23,444
Where's Gibbs?

241
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,611
I know you know he's my ex.

242
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:28,745
He's busy.

243
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,247
Some things never change.

244
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:33,613
Who do you think is prettier?

245
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:36,601
Ex-wife number three or future
ex-wife number four?

246
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,241
Colonel Mann is at a disadvantage
because of her uniform.

247
00:11:41,413 --> 00:11:44,991
Tell me you are not trying to imagine
her without her uniform, Tony.

248
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:51,701
How long have you known Agent Gibbs...
Major Sweigart?

249
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,605
Eight months.

250
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:55,944
Known Gibbs longer.

251
00:11:57,138 --> 00:11:58,138
Wedding bells?

252
00:11:58,262 --> 00:12:00,779
I know how this works.
You're implying because I love

253
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,334
Eric, I'm lying for him.

254
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:03,952
Are you?

255
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:09,761
He's watching, isn't he?

256
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:14,396
If you're going to have me interrogated,
Jethro, at least do it yourself.

257
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:15,608
<i>Come on.</i>

258
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:17,801
<i>You never could talk to me, could you?</i>

259
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:19,750
<i>Well, that was then,
this is now, so just...</i>

260
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:21,800
<i>get the hell in here!</i>

261
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:23,099
Feisty.

262
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,618
In an unattractive kind of way.

263
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:29,418
Got zip at Fort Belvoir, boss.

264
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:31,985
Captain Reynolds
got along with everyone.

265
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,813
No one heard a thing last night.

266
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:37,266
I'm gonna go check those phone records.

267
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:39,285
I am going to help him.

268
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:53,952
Interesting.
So you work off and image

269
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,435
of Captain Reynolds hard drive
instead of the actual laptop.

270
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,115
Sorry.

271
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,863
What are you doing?

272
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,728
Imagining you talking to me.

273
00:13:12,677 --> 00:13:15,621
The laptop is evidence.
It can't be touched,

274
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,065
so we copy the hard drive and put
the laptop back in the evidence locker.

275
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,242
Any other questions?

276
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:24,256
No.

277
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,495
Except did you see that sniffer?

278
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,834
- Sniffer?
- Yeah, just back up a bit.

279
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:32,287
Right there.

280
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:35,637
I've seen one of these.
Looks like a DLL file, right?

281
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:36,999
It is a DLL file.

282
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:38,589
That's what it wants you to think.

283
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:40,576
It's actually an executable file.

284
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,623
It sniffs out stuff
when you're not looking.

285
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,823
So is this file classified?

286
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:47,220
It's yours, free and clear.

287
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:50,033
So...

288
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:52,964
Captain Reynolds was a hacker.

289
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:56,857
Does it really matter,
what I made for dinner?

290
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:04,214
Chicken piccata,

291
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:08,200
slightly overdone, steamed
vegetables, slightly underdone,

292
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:11,151
served with a Chardonnay
that was just right.

293
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:14,888
- Did he appear at all agitated?
- No.

294
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:16,780
You having fun, Jethro?

295
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:19,775
Still decaf?

296
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:21,968
We need to talk.

297
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:23,714
The colonel's conducting the interview.

298
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,154
I'm done.

299
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:30,979
Why are you targeting my boyfriend?

300
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:32,666
You couldn't make me happy, so

301
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,937
you won't let me be happy
with someone else, is that it?

302
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:37,323
- No.
- Then what are you doing?

303
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,866
What I've always had to do,
Stephanie, my job.

304
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:41,930
Can we at least finish one conversation?

305
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:43,460
I'm starting to feel like I'm married.

306
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:45,620
That's funny.
I never felt like we were ever married.

307
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:48,753
Look, Eric didn't do this
and I don't know what evidence

308
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:51,359
you've got that makes you think he did,
but you're wrong.

309
00:14:52,072 --> 00:14:53,982
Just don't screw this up for me, Jethro.

310
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:55,180
It's not about you.

311
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:57,535
Well, it was never about me, was it?

312
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:00,985
Boss?

313
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,625
Abby needs to see us.

314
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:10,599
I'm just going to...

315
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,208
I'm happy you found somebody.

316
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,920
I'll send an agent down
to escort you out.

317
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,788
Cyber guy here yet?

318
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:25,432
Yeah, in with Abby.

319
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:27,803
She'll be fine.

320
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:29,685
Get out!

321
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:30,758
I'm serious.

322
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,709
So... the dead are strung up
on a spit and roasted?

323
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,287
Yeah, and then the tribe
serves up the drippings.

324
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:37,393
So gross.

325
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,067
- And you saw this?
- Saw what, Abs?

326
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,647
A death ritual that would
make your hair stand up on end.

327
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,123
Maybe not your hair but definitely,
say, McGee's hair.

328
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:46,767
What about our ritual?
Solving crimes.

329
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,442
Fred found a sniffer.

330
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:52,944
It's a keystroke logger used by hackers
to find passwords.

331
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,466
And you're never going to guess

332
00:15:54,563 --> 00:15:57,148
whose computer Captain Reynolds
was hacking into.

333
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:01,251
Well, just 'cause I said you'd never
guess doesn't mean you shouldn't try.

334
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:02,833
Major Eric Sweigart.

335
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:04,095
Him again.

336
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:05,556
What was Reynolds accessing?

337
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:09,475
Sweigart's e-mails, which I still
have to manually cut and paste.

338
00:16:09,507 --> 00:16:11,591
- Do it, Abs.
- Well, I found something else.

339
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:13,169
Captain Reynolds opened a

340
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,006
file-share application
at 7:30 last night.

341
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,173
- What's a file-share...
- File-share application.

342
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:20,338
You share music, videos,

343
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:23,416
other files, put 'em on the Internet,
anyone who wants to can copy 'em.

344
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:25,084
7:30 is about the time of death.

345
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:27,432
But what's weird is... The song.

346
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:28,841
Drumroll, please.

347
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:34,428
"The Elements" song.

348
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:37,446
A song about the weather?

349
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:39,343
No, no, no, it recites all the elements.

350
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:42,202
It's a comic ditty written by a Harvard

351
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:45,431
math professor in the late 50s.
It's really catchy...

352
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:50,386
Well, Abby,
maybe if you play it, you'll...

353
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,371
<i>There's antimony, arsenic,
aluminum, selenium,</i>

354
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,426
<i>and hydrogen and oxygen
and nitrogen and rhenium,</i>

355
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:58,391
<i>and nickel, neodymium,
neptunium, germanium,</i>

356
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:00,454
<i>and iron, americium,
ruthenium, uranium,</i>

357
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:02,576
<i>europium, zirconium,
lutetium, vanadium.</i>

358
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:04,752
<i>And lanthanum and osmium
and astatine and radium.</i>

359
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,253
<i>And gold, protactinium,
and indium and gallium.</i>

360
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:10,625
He has access to the nation's secrets

361
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:13,442
and he's file-sharing that song
just before he dies?

362
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:14,709
Why?

363
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:16,095
Abby's going to find out.

364
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:18,786
Yes, because neither
rain nor sleet nor any

365
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:22,481
class of simple atomic substance will
keep me from my appointed duty, sir.

366
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:24,055
Sweet.

367
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,469
You know, when I was in the
sixth grade I made a complete

368
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,853
periodic table out of
licorice and Junior Mints.

369
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:37,127
Cool.

370
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:39,157
Yeah, that's...
impressive, McGee.

371
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:43,073
That must have been extremely awkward...

372
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:46,463
For all concerned.

373
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:48,460
So what happened between them?

374
00:17:48,515 --> 00:17:52,410
You know, a man's heart
often tells us how he lived.

375
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:53,742
Sometimes...

376
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:57,909
it might even tell us how he died,
but contrary to popular myth,

377
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:00,885
it never tells us how he loved.

378
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:02,110
I'm sorry.

379
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:04,053
I did not mean to put you on the spot.

380
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:06,580
You won't find a better man than Jethro.

381
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:08,782
He's a fiercely loyal

382
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:12,698
colleague and friend,
but he does come with his challenges.

383
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:14,062
Tell me about it.

384
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:17,803
There's a part of him I...

385
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:20,934
I don't know, I mean,
he just shuts me out.

386
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,856
I thought maybe it was
Stephanie or their marriage...

387
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,429
They weren't married long.

388
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,977
Fourteen months.

389
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:30,708
Top of my class in Interrogation.

390
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:33,639
Remind me to ask
for a highly qualified lawyer

391
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:35,646
should I ever be interrogated by you.

392
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:38,906
I don't want to be another
one of his mistakes, Ducky.

393
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:41,919
I know he's been married three times.

394
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:48,051
More than three times?

395
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:50,985
Perhaps I should get that lawyer now.

396
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,808
Divorced three times, married four.

397
00:18:57,779 --> 00:18:58,935
Jethro's married?

398
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,582
Heavens no.

399
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:03,414
Well, then, I don't...

400
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:11,366
His first wife,
along with his only child.

401
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:13,546
Oh, my God...

402
00:19:15,064 --> 00:19:18,198
He named the boat "Kelly".

403
00:19:18,504 --> 00:19:19,719
After his daughter.

404
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:22,246
She was eight-years-old.

405
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:25,675
What happened?

406
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:28,733
I think you should ask Jethro that.

407
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,809
His wife witnessed a murder.
She identified the shooter.

408
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,004
He came after her.

409
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:40,088
What was her name?

410
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:41,649
Shannon.

411
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,020
Results, Duck?

412
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:48,957
Captain Reynolds' cause of death

413
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,634
was relatively straight forward,
but I did find something else.

414
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:56,850
On his cheeks, we found a residue
of prolactin and lysozyme.

415
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,497
Tears, Jethro.

416
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:02,016
Captain Reynolds was crying
when he died.

417
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:05,129
Checked Reynolds' phone records, boss.

418
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:07,973
Colonel, ma'am...

419
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,283
I drew a blank.

420
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:13,919
So we checked
Major Sweigart's phone records.

421
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:17,846
Ten calls in the last three days
to the same person...

422
00:20:18,535 --> 00:20:19,538
A woman.

423
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:21,602
- Stephanie?
- No.

424
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,703
Jill, Captain Reynolds' wife.

425
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:35,486
The husband, the wife and the lover.

426
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,232
All the trademarks
of a classic love triangle.

427
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:40,573
You forgot the lover's lover,

428
00:20:40,631 --> 00:20:43,795
which would make it technically,
I think, a lovers quadrangle.

429
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:45,142
Or it could be a ring.

430
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:49,440
Abby uncovered suspicious
activity on the victim's laptop.

431
00:20:49,556 --> 00:20:52,980
And since Captain Reynolds had access
to highly classified defense secrets,

432
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:54,889
we cannot rule out a spy ring.

433
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:57,751
And we know that Major Sweigart
was with your ex...

434
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:00,723
with...
Stephanie Flynn.

435
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:02,066
And Mrs. Reynolds was at

436
00:21:02,105 --> 00:21:04,111
a pharmaceutical convention
in Charlottesville.

437
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:07,907
- Charlottesville.
- Yes, Charlottesville.

438
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:10,293
Great minds think alike, McGee.

439
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:14,478
Fort Belvoir,
where Reynolds died, is here.

440
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:17,476
Charlottesville is here, 104 miles.

441
00:21:17,553 --> 00:21:18,556
Two hour drive.

442
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:22,371
Close enough for Jill Reynolds
to drive home, kill her husband,

443
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,567
drive back to Charlottesville, and fly

444
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:27,192
home again to discover him
dead with a witness present.

445
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:30,267
- That does not mean she did it.
- It doesn't mean she didn't do it.

446
00:21:30,314 --> 00:21:31,895
- Motive?
- DiNozzo, check...

447
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:34,006
Life insurance.
Did it, 400 grand

448
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:37,384
from the military, another quarter of a mil.
from a private carrier, a beneficiary:

449
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,532
Jill Reynolds.

450
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:41,356
The crime scene just became
our prime suspect's house.

451
00:21:41,393 --> 00:21:43,592
- Get a warrant.
- Mrs. Reynolds?

452
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:46,076
We'll bring her in.

453
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:51,530
<i>There's sulfur, californium,
and fermium, berkelium,</i>

454
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:53,781
<i>and also mendelevium,
einsteinium, noeblium and argon,</i>

455
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,505
<i>krypton, neon, radon, xenon,
zinc and rhodium. And chlorine,</i>

456
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:58,994
<i>carbon, cobalt, copper,
tungsten, tin and sodium...</i>

457
00:22:00,895 --> 00:22:02,400
You thinking what I'm thinking?

458
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:04,233
I hope so.

459
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,420
Steganography.

460
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:07,163
Not even close.

461
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,353
If the song has a meaning,
then the meaning is

462
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:11,389
probably hidden inside a file.

463
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,842
What's the most sophisticated
way to hide a file in a computer?

464
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:17,283
- Steganography.
- Now you're thinking what I'm thinking.

465
00:22:17,317 --> 00:22:18,822
Yeah, but I was enjoying thinking

466
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:21,322
what I was thinking before
you asked me what I was thinking.

467
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:23,994
Would I have enjoyed
what you were thinking?

468
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:25,968
Don't answer that.

469
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:28,072
I developed a program

470
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:31,275
to search for
any steganography algorithm.

471
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:34,018
If there is a stego file on there,
this puppy...

472
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,335
will find it.

473
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,861
You're good.

474
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:38,197
Please.

475
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:41,674
Hey! You ever feel like you could
use some extra help around here?

476
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:43,679
I work like 16 hours a day.

477
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:47,220
That's like two eight-hour
days stuck together.

478
00:22:47,603 --> 00:22:48,682
Yup.

479
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:51,983
It's probably not in the budget, and...

480
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:54,843
I'm kind of a control freak.

481
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,393
I work for two control freaks,
neither of whom are as smart as you.

482
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:00,303
I'm not that smart.

483
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,522
- Please.
- I'm not.

484
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:06,278
I'm not.

485
00:23:07,212 --> 00:23:08,212
Password cracker?

486
00:23:09,392 --> 00:23:11,090
Password cracker.

487
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,276
- You're going to tell me?
- Tell you what?

488
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:30,644
What's bugging you.

489
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:36,362
How long have we been together?

490
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,215
- Weeks.
- Months.

491
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,344
Meaning many weeks.

492
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:53,473
We've shared a lot, right?

493
00:23:53,578 --> 00:23:54,578
Yeah.

494
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,072
Divorced three times.

495
00:23:58,441 --> 00:24:00,381
- I told you that.
- Married four.

496
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,552
You never told me
about your first wife, Shannon.

497
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:05,348
Or that you had a daughter, Kelly.

498
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:07,229
Why, Jethro?

499
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,015
They're dead.

500
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:13,328
End of story.

501
00:24:15,546 --> 00:24:16,942
I've put it behind me.

502
00:24:20,353 --> 00:24:21,353
Have you?

503
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:36,699
Anything from those ATMs
in Charlottesville?

504
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,028
Not yet, boss.

505
00:24:40,674 --> 00:24:41,858
I was thinking, boss.

506
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:43,758
Now, you know that Abby and I have

507
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,039
solved a lot of computer problems
together, and it seems to me that,

508
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,539
you know,
three heads are better than two.

509
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:53,676
And seeing as how the period table is,
you know, in my wheelhouse...

510
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:55,892
it seems...

511
00:25:01,063 --> 00:25:03,976
I was thinking it'd probably be best
if I stay here, focus on my job...

512
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:06,388
- That's a good call.
- Abby focus on hers.

513
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:09,898
I tell you, Colonel,

514
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,690
guys like Fred...
they're a dime a dozen at MIT.

515
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,047
Charming, funny, successful,
good-looking.

516
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:17,732
Women see right through that.

517
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,229
Exactly.

518
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,152
Excuse us there.

519
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:27,660
- NCIS.
- We are looking for Jill Reynolds.

520
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:29,136
She's in the back.

521
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:30,355
You a friend?

522
00:25:31,275 --> 00:25:32,512
Lieutenant Marsden.

523
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,599
Command sent me out to go over Captain
Reynolds' death benefits with her.

524
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:37,396
Quite the waterfall.

525
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:39,872
She means windfall.

526
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:44,103
If you think money compensates
for the loss of a loved one.

527
00:25:45,286 --> 00:25:46,735
No, I'm sure it doesn't.

528
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:48,970
Excuse me.

529
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:57,399
NCIS. Mrs. Reynolds?

530
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:58,669
<i>In here.</i>

531
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:11,313
Cleaning is kind of therapeutic for me.

532
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:17,591
<i>Give it to me, baby, come on.</i>

533
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:19,427
<i>Don't make me beg.</i>

534
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:25,325
Hey, McGee.

535
00:26:26,288 --> 00:26:27,291
Everything okay?

536
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,510
I'm just running a password cracker.

537
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:31,707
I brought you a...

538
00:26:34,602 --> 00:26:35,602
Caf-Pow!

539
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:37,631
This is a monumental task, McGee.

540
00:26:38,152 --> 00:26:41,039
The keyboard doesn't just have numbers,
it has the whole alphabet.

541
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,276
Could be case-sensitive.

542
00:26:42,277 --> 00:26:45,383
Or you could take 1000 years to go
through all the possible permutations.

543
00:26:45,596 --> 00:26:47,409
You know,
the more complicated the password,

544
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,300
the bigger the need
to keep some record of it.

545
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:51,114
Nice try, McGee,

546
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:53,542
but we already looked for it
in the copy of his hard drive.

547
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:56,657
But not in the actual laptop.

548
00:26:56,947 --> 00:26:59,628
It could be hidden
in a secret partition of RAM.

549
00:26:59,891 --> 00:27:00,971
That's brilliant!

550
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:03,833
I'm gonna go get the laptop
out of the evidence locker.

551
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:18,514
These have quite a kick, don't they?

552
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:21,408
I down six or seven
of these bad boys a day.

553
00:27:22,912 --> 00:27:24,667
There's a serious conflict here.

554
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,118
Jethro shouldn't be leading
this investigation.

555
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:29,240
He's not. Colonel Mann is.

556
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,193
You pick up that look from Gibbs?

557
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:37,707
I picked up a lot
of bad habits from Gibbs.

558
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:39,807
I understand your concern.

559
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:41,688
Then take him off the case.

560
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,993
I've known Agent Gibbs a long time.

561
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:45,980
I trust and respect his judgment.

562
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,913
My boy friend didn't kill anyone.

563
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:51,363
Then I'm sure the investigation
will bear that out.

564
00:27:51,364 --> 00:27:53,813
Maybe not before damaging
Eric's military career.

565
00:27:54,102 --> 00:27:56,105
If Major Sweigart wasn't involved,

566
00:27:56,162 --> 00:27:59,828
I'll personally see to it
that he suffers no career repercussions.

567
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:01,986
Thank you.

568
00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:05,032
Can I ask you a personal question?

569
00:28:08,003 --> 00:28:11,489
I don't quite know how to put this,
but I always had the feeling that before

570
00:28:12,244 --> 00:28:14,617
our marriage, there was something
between you and Jethro.

571
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:19,313
It has always been strictly professional
between us.

572
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,080
<i>She's got something to hide.</i>

573
00:28:22,215 --> 00:28:24,028
Why else would she clean so thoroughly?

574
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,752
Train wreck.

575
00:28:32,265 --> 00:28:33,905
I want to look away, but I can't.

576
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,463
Agent Gibbs?

577
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,143
- Director.
- Colonel,

578
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:42,018
I was just reassuring Gibbs'...

579
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:45,004
your witness,

580
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:46,953
that Agent Gibbs could separate himself

581
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,453
from the personal aspects
of this investigation.

582
00:28:49,905 --> 00:28:53,127
Well, I'll monitor him,
closely, Director.

583
00:28:54,185 --> 00:28:55,351
I'm sure you will.

584
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,933
- Is that the look you're talking about?
- Yeah, that's it.

585
00:29:00,877 --> 00:29:02,536
Yup, we've all seen that one.

586
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:08,748
Miss Flynn was just leaving,
unless you need her for something.

587
00:29:08,806 --> 00:29:09,944
No. She can go home.

588
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:12,252
For now.

589
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:14,860
You find anything?

590
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:16,634
I bet you've never been happier
to see me.

591
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,380
- It was clean.
- Spotless.

592
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,323
She's like that professional
cleaner in Pulp Fiction.

593
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:22,409
We found a partial
print in the kitchen

594
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,752
- near the office.
- Run it.

595
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,291
I mean, with only, like,
a squiggle on a little loop.

596
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,610
- We don't even know which finger.
- Only ten possibilities, DiNozzo.

597
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:32,111
Well, no. There's one point,
there's ten fingers.

598
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:33,867
You know, that's thousands of...

599
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:35,446
On it.

600
00:29:38,285 --> 00:29:39,288
Train wreck.

601
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:47,131
Why have you kept me waiting?

602
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:50,296
- Give you time to think.
- I don't...

603
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:52,586
want to think.
I want to clean.

604
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,882
We know about your affair
with Major Sweigart.

605
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:58,940
Your husband knew, too.

606
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:03,141
He didn't.

607
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:06,412
He hacked into Major Sweigart's e-mails.

608
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:08,997
Read everything you ever wrote
to each other.

609
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,968
He was crying when he died.

610
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:14,344
We also know about the life insurance.

611
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:18,191
650,000 reasons not to want a divorce.

612
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,336
I don't care about the money.

613
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:25,253
Wait.
You think that...

614
00:30:25,832 --> 00:30:29,517
Look, my marriage wasn't good,
but I would never, ever...

615
00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:31,404
I told you,

616
00:30:31,674 --> 00:30:34,065
I was at a conference
in Charlottesville.

617
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,764
- All you have to do is check.
- We did.

618
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:38,330
- I signed in.
- And you slipped out.

619
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:42,362
- Killed your husband, drove back.
- No!

620
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:45,520
You want to clean? You clean
your conscience, you tell the truth.

621
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:47,391
- I am!
- You're not!

622
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:52,845
- What?
<i>- Boss, I got something you need to see.</i>

623
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:54,190
We'll be right there.

624
00:30:58,738 --> 00:31:00,794
I've been watching the footage
of ATMs surrounding

625
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,197
the pharmaceutical convention

626
00:31:02,198 --> 00:31:04,340
in Charlottesville on the day
Captain Reynolds died.

627
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:06,578
As you can see, it's time-stamped.

628
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:08,699
Check out the brunette.

629
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:10,686
No. In the background
rounding the corner.

630
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:14,291
Wait for it.

631
00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:16,603
There!

632
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:19,288
Jill Reynolds. 8:05.

633
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,161
Can't be two places at once.

634
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:22,489
She's clean...

635
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,866
in more ways than one.

636
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:36,746
Maybe she hired a contract killer.

637
00:31:36,824 --> 00:31:39,023
What about the partial prints
in Reynolds' kitchen?

638
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:41,712
Came up with 80,000 potential hits.

639
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:44,066
I know. Trying to narrow it
down to people

640
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:45,879
who might have had access
to the Army base.

641
00:31:45,975 --> 00:31:47,479
Have we given up on Major Sweigart?

642
00:31:47,576 --> 00:31:48,645
He has an alibi.

643
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,952
From someone who thinks
he's her future husband.

644
00:31:51,357 --> 00:31:53,672
- Stephanie wouldn't lie.
- Are you sure?

645
00:31:56,057 --> 00:31:57,715
Well, I'm not. I mean, she finds out

646
00:31:57,754 --> 00:32:00,243
that her boyfriend was having an affair
with her best friend,

647
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:02,077
she might just change her story.

648
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,314
Bring her in for another interview.

649
00:32:06,437 --> 00:32:07,237
Wait.

650
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,867
- I said bring her in.
- I said wait.

651
00:32:16,597 --> 00:32:18,275
This never turns out well for the kids.

652
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:20,723
Can you be objective here?

653
00:32:20,781 --> 00:32:22,595
Because if you can't,
you're no good to me.

654
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:29,118
If this wasn't your ex,
what would your gut be saying right now?

655
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:32,314
It would be saying bring her in
and break her.

656
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,969
Maybe

657
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,169
she's lying to protect her boyfriend.

658
00:32:39,197 --> 00:32:40,259
Maybe it's worse.

659
00:32:42,072 --> 00:32:44,040
What if Stephanie knew about the affair?

660
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:48,751
She'd walk.

661
00:32:50,026 --> 00:32:51,858
Okay, then, let's talk about motive.

662
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:54,296
Maybe she wants to frame Jill
for being the bitch

663
00:32:54,297 --> 00:32:57,272
who stole her boyfriend. Or maybe
Major Sweigart for cheating on her.

664
00:32:58,465 --> 00:32:59,715
You don't know Stephanie.

665
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:02,107
But I do know my job.

666
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:07,644
- DiNozzo.
- Here I am, boss.

667
00:33:07,723 --> 00:33:08,723
Call her.

668
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:11,176
Tell her to come in.
I need to talk with her.

669
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:20,784
Voicemail.

670
00:33:26,536 --> 00:33:27,539
Same thing.

671
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:36,096
This is Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo
of NCIS for Stephanie Flynn.

672
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:40,108
As of when?

673
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:42,639
Thank you.

674
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,766
Stephanie quit her job this morning.

675
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,859
- Pow!
- Another one?

676
00:33:57,187 --> 00:34:00,235
I found a program
on Captain Reynolds' boot-up sequence.

677
00:34:00,343 --> 00:34:01,404
Guess what it does.

678
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,285
Judging by your expression,
something good.

679
00:34:03,295 --> 00:34:06,130
It creates the password
when you turn the computer on,

680
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,824
and it deletes it when you turn it off.

681
00:34:08,638 --> 00:34:10,354
Hidden in RAM.
You know what?

682
00:34:10,563 --> 00:34:14,133
If I weren't so irrationally confident,
I might actually be intimidated by you.

683
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:17,991
Please. Okay, so it's 30 characters.

684
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,840
That's too many for a password cracker.

685
00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:22,521
Here we go.

686
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,923
That was really anticlimactic.

687
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:29,457
Okay, so...

688
00:34:29,515 --> 00:34:33,161
the file extension indicates
it's an audio plug-in file.

689
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,190
Last accessed...

690
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:38,968
at 7:31 p. m. on Monday.

691
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:42,068
That's the same time
Captain Reynolds uploaded the song.

692
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:45,726
That's the same time he died,
it give or take a chorus.

693
00:34:45,938 --> 00:34:47,828
Let's see what the plug-in does
with the song.

694
00:34:50,893 --> 00:34:51,916
<i>Selenium...</i>

695
00:34:52,302 --> 00:34:54,115
<i>Uranium...
Gallium...</i>

696
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,273
<i>Phosphorus.</i>

697
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:57,009
<i>Potassium...
Polonium...</i>

698
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:58,433
<i>Curium...</i>

699
00:34:58,871 --> 00:34:59,932
<i>Sodium.</i>

700
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:04,890
The plug-in is just a filter...
it highlights pieces of the song.

701
00:35:07,227 --> 00:35:09,292
- It's a code.
- It's not a code.

702
00:35:09,547 --> 00:35:10,686
It's just words, Abby.

703
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:14,081
It's not just words, Fred.
It's numbers.

704
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:17,123
Every element has a corresponding number
on the periodic table.

705
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:19,321
Selenium is 34,

706
00:35:19,476 --> 00:35:21,868
uranium 92,

707
00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:23,701
and gallium 31.

708
00:35:25,525 --> 00:35:26,624
Abby's office.

709
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:28,747
Yeah. She's right here.

710
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:31,351
I could... Okay.
No. I'll tell her, sir.

711
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,539
Your boss wants to see you.

712
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,590
Gibbs... has this uncanny ability

713
00:35:37,648 --> 00:35:39,192
to know when I found something.

714
00:35:40,393 --> 00:35:42,573
I don't even know what I found yet.

715
00:35:42,843 --> 00:35:44,232
Well, he didn't seem happy.

716
00:35:45,524 --> 00:35:47,604
He never does, even when he is happy.

717
00:35:47,758 --> 00:35:49,456
And I doubt he's happy right now.

718
00:35:49,668 --> 00:35:51,461
But, you know, I am his favorite,

719
00:35:51,578 --> 00:35:53,546
so he's usually pretty good with me.

720
00:35:53,681 --> 00:35:55,094
Even when you keep him waiting?

721
00:35:58,641 --> 00:35:59,715
I'll be right back.

722
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,670
Hurry up.

723
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:04,432
Try her again.

724
00:36:05,227 --> 00:36:06,261
I'm here, Gibbs.

725
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:07,357
- Abby.
- Wait.

726
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:11,821
"Selenium, uranium, gallium, phosphorus.
Potassium, polonium, curium and sodium."

727
00:36:11,898 --> 00:36:13,080
It's the song, Gibbs!

728
00:36:13,285 --> 00:36:15,342
There was a program
on Captain Reynolds' laptop

729
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:16,855
that highlighted these elements.

730
00:36:16,932 --> 00:36:19,344
The periodic table has a number
associated with each one.

731
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:20,523
The numbers mean something,

732
00:36:20,524 --> 00:36:23,102
I just don't know what yet.
Like 34 could be three-four...

733
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:24,476
92 could be nine-two.

734
00:36:24,491 --> 00:36:26,748
- Could be a GPS coordinate.
- Or a bank account.

735
00:36:26,787 --> 00:36:29,074
I just need to know how you knew
that I found something.

736
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,954
I didn't, Abby.

737
00:36:31,262 --> 00:36:32,844
Stephanie's still not answering.

738
00:36:33,764 --> 00:36:35,346
Well, why did you call me?

739
00:36:36,253 --> 00:36:38,163
- I didn't.
- Fred said you did.

740
00:36:38,356 --> 00:36:40,783
Boss, guess who is one the 80,000 hits

741
00:36:40,841 --> 00:36:42,461
from the crime scene fingerprints.

742
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:44,151
- Fred?
- You guessed.

743
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:45,261
Where is he?

744
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:47,189
- In my lab.
- With evidence?

745
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,443
With the laptop!

746
00:36:49,003 --> 00:36:50,739
Find out what this means, McGee.

747
00:36:52,195 --> 00:36:53,392
Hey, going somewhere?

748
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,790
Home.

749
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:56,999
- Tell me you didn't.
- Didn't what?

750
00:36:59,507 --> 00:37:01,166
You know, I think we had a power surge.

751
00:37:04,576 --> 00:37:05,734
They're wiped clean.

752
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:07,953
The original laptop?

753
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:14,176
I did not leave this open!

754
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:16,086
You wiped it, too!

755
00:37:16,492 --> 00:37:18,697
Abby, I'm hurt!
You think I did this?

756
00:37:19,388 --> 00:37:21,317
- Gibbs, can I hit him?
- No.

757
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,037
Look, anybody could have done it.

758
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:26,667
The lab was left unattended,
right, Abby?

759
00:37:28,187 --> 00:37:31,230
Unless you're gonna arrest me, I've got
a date with my Pilates instructor.

760
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:38,023
Hey, what are you doing?

761
00:37:38,368 --> 00:37:40,027
Last number dialed, my lab.

762
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:41,415
Yeah, so, could've missed that one.

763
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,554
The last e-mail.

764
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:45,270
Confirmed for a flight on Thai Air.

765
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,892
- Why did you erase the hard drives?
- I didn't.

766
00:37:49,007 --> 00:37:50,284
What do the numbers mean?

767
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:51,686
Not a clue.

768
00:37:52,842 --> 00:37:56,277
DIA deals with classified material.
You found a foreign buyer?

769
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,916
You have to go up,
in order to go down, right?

770
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:02,617
Can I hit him now, Gibbs?

771
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:05,925
You think Reynolds could have set up
that computer code?

772
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:07,989
Only an expert could have done it.

773
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,072
Reynolds had access to the secrets,
you knew how to steal them.

774
00:38:11,265 --> 00:38:13,368
Are we gonna find
some money stashed away?

775
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:15,957
If you've got the evidence, arrest me.

776
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:17,773
If not...
have a nice day.

777
00:38:22,345 --> 00:38:25,045
Lieutenant Marsden just confirmed
that our friend here volunteered

778
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:26,782
to oversee Abby's work on the laptop.

779
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:29,174
Why didn't you wipe the hard drive
after you killed him?

780
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:31,504
He didn't think anyone was smart enough
to find the code,

781
00:38:31,505 --> 00:38:33,556
- until it was sent to me.
- I didn't kill anyone.

782
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:36,926
Either Reynolds wouldn't split the money
with you or you got greedy.

783
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,990
Think of the slimiest thing
and that's what he did!

784
00:38:40,048 --> 00:38:41,048
Come on, McGee.

785
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:45,855
- Hey, I know my rights.
- Boss, I got it.

786
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,613
Numbers are an offshore account
in the names of both Captain Reynolds

787
00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:50,635
and Fred Rinnert.

788
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:53,568
One half-million dollars transferred
into the account

789
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,137
from a bank in Beirut at 7:30
the night Reynolds died.

790
00:38:57,316 --> 00:38:59,053
It was cleaned out two hours later.

791
00:38:59,226 --> 00:39:00,615
So, it was greed?

792
00:39:04,624 --> 00:39:06,623
My acting boss says
you ain't going anywhere.

793
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,170
What'd you sell
and who'd you sell it to?

794
00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:12,873
Maybe if you cut me a deal,

795
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,125
I'll tell you.

796
00:39:23,868 --> 00:39:24,871
Sweet.

797
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,703
Why isn't that a romantic night
on the town always turns into

798
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:36,475
a less than romantic night
in your basement, sanding...

799
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:38,942
your boat.

800
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:42,416
Hello, Stephanie.

801
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:46,991
Still not locking your front door,
Jethro.

802
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:52,025
Sweet.

803
00:39:55,655 --> 00:39:57,237
I just came by to...

804
00:39:58,414 --> 00:39:59,590
give you these.

805
00:40:00,053 --> 00:40:01,480
I found them in a drawer...

806
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:03,912
about six years ago.

807
00:40:05,353 --> 00:40:06,586
I thought I lost them.

808
00:40:07,128 --> 00:40:08,128
I'm gonna...

809
00:40:08,468 --> 00:40:10,992
- wait for you upstairs.
- No... it's okay. I'm...

810
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:14,599
- I'm not staying. So...
- I'll walk you out.

811
00:40:22,274 --> 00:40:23,274
Good luck.

812
00:40:24,975 --> 00:40:25,975
Thanks.

813
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,355
Why'd you quit your job?

814
00:40:41,548 --> 00:40:43,323
I'm moving to Philadelphia.

815
00:40:44,646 --> 00:40:45,971
My parents are getting old.

816
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,688
And, Shelley had a baby.

817
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:49,962
- Another one?
- She's a baby factory.

818
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,535
It's a good thing someone
in my family is.

819
00:40:54,924 --> 00:40:56,506
I guess I'm gonna be that...

820
00:40:57,278 --> 00:40:59,926
doting aunt that still looks great
in her bikini.

821
00:41:07,604 --> 00:41:08,781
Eric and I split up.

822
00:41:10,613 --> 00:41:11,963
He told me about his...

823
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:15,051
affair... with Jill.

824
00:41:16,652 --> 00:41:17,652
You knew.

825
00:41:21,321 --> 00:41:23,150
After all my ranting in your office,

826
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,350
you missed a perfect opportunity
to throw that in my face.

827
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:28,417
I wouldn't do that to you.

828
00:41:30,423 --> 00:41:31,600
No, you wouldn't.

829
00:41:34,782 --> 00:41:37,161
It just never seems to work out
for me, Jethro.

830
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,303
I'm sorry.

831
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:45,750
Me. Us.
Not your fault.

832
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:51,590
Wasn't anybody's fault.

833
00:42:00,844 --> 00:42:02,272
We'll always have Moscow.

834
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,426
You never cease to surprise me.

835
00:42:19,966 --> 00:42:21,081
Music.

836
00:42:42,631 --> 00:42:43,898
<i>What do you think, daddy?!</i>

837
00:42:44,014 --> 00:42:45,596
<i>I came in second place!</i>

838
00:42:45,653 --> 00:42:47,390
<i>You would have been proud of her,
Jethro.</i>

839
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:48,489
<i>I miss you, daddy!</i>

840
00:42:48,586 --> 00:42:52,014
<i>When you get home,
I'll be really good at it, I promise.</i>

841
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:53,235
<i>I love you.</i>

842
00:42:53,268 --> 00:42:54,425
<i>A kiss for daddy.</i>

843
00:42:56,605 --> 00:42:58,592
<i>I love you, daddy... love you.</i>

844
00:42:58,724 --> 00:42:59,766
<i>Bye, Jethro.</i>

845
00:43:00,055 --> 00:43:01,135
<i>We miss you.</i>
