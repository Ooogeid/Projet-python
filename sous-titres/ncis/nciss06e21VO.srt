00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:05,045
<i>When the bough breaks,</i>

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:08,551
<i>the cradle will fall and down...</i>

4
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:12,422
<i>will come baby Cradle and all.</i>

5
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:15,975
That's kind of a dark song.

6
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:26,140
- Are you happy?
- You asked me

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,410
- to get you some ice cream.
- Did I tell you to blend it?

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,658
I didn't remember the blender being
that loud before.

9
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:33,971
And this morning, you didn't remember
that the dryer beeps on wrinkle guard.

10
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:35,885
It was a beep... a single beep!

11
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:38,797
How can something with such little ears
have such bionic hearing?

12
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:44,981
Okay.

13
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:48,690
<i>Help me... please...</i>

14
00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:51,547
<i>help me.</i>

19
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,308
Must you do that now, Tony?

20
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:41,561
It's spring.
I'm spring-cleaning, so...

21
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:44,105
- yes.
-  Spring-cleaning?

22
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:46,024
You don't have spring-cleaning
in Israel?

23
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:47,740
We do not have spring.

24
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:49,469
Israel is a desert.

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,948
I've been looking for this.

26
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:03,041
I remember those days,

27
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:05,728
when I was carefree and full of joy.

28
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:09,172
- I envy you, Tony.
- Why are you dressed for a funeral?

29
00:02:09,356 --> 00:02:10,992
- Everything okay?
- No.

30
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,384
Frank is sick.

31
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:14,552
Who is Frank?

32
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,178
My mandibular second molar.

33
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,390
It's been killing me for a week.
I'm finally going to the dentist.

34
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,141
You name your teeth?

35
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:22,227
You don't?

36
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,143
- No.
- See, that's the problem.

37
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,148
They're just teeth to you.

38
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,818
But evolutionarily speaking,

39
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:33,212
 your survival is directly proportionate
to their health.

40
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,157
A cavity was a death sentence
on the Savannah.

41
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,189
Abby, everyone gets cavities.

42
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:39,117
No.

43
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:42,413
No Sciuto has had
a cavity since 1922.

44
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,117
- Good genes.
- Genes?

45
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,960
I brush, and I floss,
and I tongue-scrape more

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,379
than most people
would consider sane.

47
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,489
I have earned my perfect record.

48
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,637
No cavities, no surrender.

49
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:55,332
I don't deserve this.

50
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:58,670
- I'll be back before lunch.
- Good luck.

51
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,823
Don't get too comfortable.

52
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,225
Dead body.

53
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,561
Come on...
you all know the drill.

54
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:11,604
He looks cold.

55
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,279
That's the least of his problems,
McGee.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,614
Hey, boss.
Parents didn't have much to add.

57
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:19,576
Baby's room was empty,
except for the baby.

58
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:21,928
They kept hearing the voice
through the baby monitor.

59
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:23,788
Cops did a search of the area.

60
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:25,935
All they found was him.

61
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:29,207
They identified the body
as Marine Private First Class...

62
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,712
Marco Riggs.

63
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:35,133
And I am identifying some pretty
gnarly toes. This guy needed a pedicure.

64
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:38,094
Bothers you so much,
DiNozzo, go find his shoes.

65
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:40,266
Boss, I'm going
to go find his shoes.

66
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:42,945
This would explain
the voice the parents heard.

67
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,702
Our dead guy had
a military-issue cell scanner.

68
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,605
Not exactly standard-issue
for privates.

69
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,357
That's probably why
he was misusing it.

70
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:55,006
Take a look at the display, boss.

71
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:58,123
911?

72
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:02,427
Looks like Riggs was trying to use
the cell scanner as a cell phone.

73
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:04,621
Ended up broadcasting
in a narrowband frequency.

74
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:08,499
- Got picked up by the baby monitor.
- I don't know about the feet, though.

75
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,236
That's because you don't know
your history, McGee.

76
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:12,550
Historically,

77
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:15,006
going about unshod was considered

78
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:17,634
by some to be an act
of pious devotion,

79
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:18,861
while others...

80
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:22,852
Believed that direct contact with Mother
Earth provided spiritual benefits.

81
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:27,060
However, in Roman and medieval times,
going barefoot symbolized poverty,

82
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:30,920
since leather and boots were
too expensive for the average...

83
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:32,459
Really?

84
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:35,526
I wrote a paper on...

85
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:37,362
Never mind.

86
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,320
Cyanosis indicates lack of oxygen.

87
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,491
No signs of strangulation
or ligature marks.

88
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,328
Did you write a paper on those, too?

89
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:48,706
Time of death...

90
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,376
two hours ago.

91
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:52,876
That a problem?

92
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:56,005
Mr. Palmer, help me with the body.

93
00:04:56,584 --> 00:05:00,111
Yes, well, he's remarkably stiff

94
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:01,719
for the recently deceased.

95
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:04,681
It's too soon for rigor,
even at this temperature.

96
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:06,195
There's no...

97
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:09,769
entry wounds, no sign of trauma,

98
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:11,771
but something sucked
the life out of him.

99
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:17,071
Sucked the life out is right.

100
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,011
Abby is going to love this.

101
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,675
Thank you!

102
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:25,882
What a way to start the day.

103
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,044
Abby Sciuto?

104
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,318
- Maybe?
- FBI.

105
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,308
You need to come with us,
Ms. Sciuto.

106
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:38,068
Now.

107
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:40,133
- Where?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

108
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:42,342
Well, then,
I'm not at liberty to go.

109
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:43,836
You misunderstand.

110
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:45,430
It's not a request.

111
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:58,650
The deceased was
Private First Class Marco Riggs.

112
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:02,237
Recently assigned to CLB-3,
Combat Logistical Battalion,

113
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,739
- supporting troops in Afghanistan.
- Until he was accused

114
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,032
of stealing equipment,
then selling it on the black market.

115
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:09,290
That include military-issue
cell scanners?

116
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,905
It did, but Riggs disappeared
before he could be formally charged.

117
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:14,625
He's been listed UA since last week.

118
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:16,120
Apartment was a dead end.

119
00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:17,902
We have a BOLO out on his vehicle.

120
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,672
Also waiting
on the blood work from Abby.

121
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,866
We're going to have
to wait a little bit longer.

122
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:23,843
Don't tell me
she needs a root canal.

123
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:25,815
No, Fornell just called.

124
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:27,728
Abby's been...

125
00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:29,652
requested.

126
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:31,225
Requested?

127
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:32,289
By?

128
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,756
He didn't know. It just said
the FBI has orders to transport her.

129
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:40,106
Okay, I can access
the FBI operations database.

130
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,736
I have a contact at the DOD.

131
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:43,863
BOLO out on the FBI transport?

132
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:45,342
I don't know.

133
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,594
I thought...

134
00:06:46,654 --> 00:06:48,862
maybe I'd just try
to call her first.

135
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:57,281
Hey, Gibbs.
Don't worry.

136
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:59,087
No cavities.
I was going to call.

137
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:00,963
Fornell already did.
You okay?

138
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:02,715
- Yep.
- Where are you?

139
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:04,050
In the back of a van.

140
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,070
Abby...

141
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:06,106
<i>I'm fine.</i>

142
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:07,303
It's exciting.

143
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:10,014
Group of FBI agents swoops in and

144
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:13,325
steals away an unsuspecting citizen
to places unknown.

145
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:16,562
<i>Yeah, it's the unknown part</i>
I don't care for.

146
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,190
I got Palmer's text
about the vampire bite.

147
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:21,402
I can't believe I'm not going
to be there for that.

148
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:23,653
- Who are you getting to fill in?
- Working on it.

149
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:26,284
<i>Well, if you need
anything</i> before then,

150
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:29,158
I keep a step-by-step
"Abby's Lab for Dummies"

151
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:33,037
<i>in my desk. It covers the basics.
A monkey could follow the instructions.</i>

152
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,219
Good.

153
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:39,242
'Cause we got one of those.

154
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:44,348
Did you realize that the end was nigh,
I wonder,

155
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:46,495
or was it a blissful event...

156
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,595
as your ego and judgment
melted away?

157
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:52,009
- I mean, a stroke from...
- Doctor?

158
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,267
Yes, Mr. Palmer.

159
00:07:54,864 --> 00:07:56,519
May I stop mopping now?

160
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,521
- It depends.
- On?

161
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:01,732
Has it enhanced
your understanding of protocol?

162
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:03,985
Consider me enhanced.

163
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,695
Good... then you may join me.

164
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,607
That invitation extend to me,
too, Duck?

165
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,786
Since when have you waited for
an invitation? Don't answer that.

166
00:08:10,846 --> 00:08:13,413
I know, you like to keep people
on their toes.

167
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:15,496
Yes, Doctor.

168
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,664
Protocol.

169
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:19,030
What?
Okay, yes.

170
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:21,920
I will go not be in this room now.

171
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,696
What do you got?

172
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:26,465
Well, sadly for Abby,
not the walking dead.

173
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,397
A histological examination
of these wounds

174
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:32,305
revealed that they're burn marks,
not punctures.

175
00:08:32,474 --> 00:08:35,641
More consistent with a stun gun attack
than a vampire bite.

176
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:38,679
- A stun gun?
- Not normally a lethal weapon.

177
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:39,979
However, I believe

178
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,356
the electrical shock aggravated

179
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:45,123
an underlying arterial weakness
in his brain,

180
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:47,778
and that led
to a hemorrhagic stroke.

181
00:08:48,614 --> 00:08:52,325
After he regained consciousness,
he would've been severely confused.

182
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:56,425
He could've wandered around for hours
before taking refuge on that...

183
00:08:56,712 --> 00:08:59,040
- loading dock.
- Then he took his shoes off?

184
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:02,404
Yeah, well,
it's called peripheral neuropathy.

185
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:04,665
It's common in this kind of stroke.

186
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:07,601
His feet would have felt
as if they were burning up,

187
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:10,133
but I doubt that he knew
what he was doing.

188
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:12,337
Towards the end,
he would have been delirious,

189
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:14,496
until eventually,
his heart would have given out.

190
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:16,515
Stun gun's a defensive weapon, Duck.

191
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:17,662
Yeah.

192
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:21,520
Which suggests
his death was unintentional.

193
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:24,273
I found something
under his fingernails.

194
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:27,490
It almost certainly came
from the assailant during the assault.

195
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,820
I need to send it up
to Abby's replacement.

196
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:32,007
Well, that's going to be
a long run, Ducky.

197
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:34,117
Just spoke to the DOD, boss.

198
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:36,419
Abby's replacement
doesn't arrive until Monday.

199
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,807
- Monday?
- Monday.

200
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:39,501
I made a lot of noise,
but, you know,

201
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:42,427
they gave me a lecture about budget
cuts. We did catch a break, though.

202
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:44,585
Got a BOLO back
from our dead guy's car.

203
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:46,629
Want me to take Ziva, or...?

204
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:48,184
No, I'll take Ziva.

205
00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:49,293
You...

206
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:51,259
you take McGee.

207
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:53,694
Take McGee where?

208
00:09:58,102 --> 00:10:00,072
Now, why did I get picked
for the cover art?

209
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,862
You want to sign, or should I?

210
00:10:03,422 --> 00:10:04,274
I will.

211
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:07,628
I am the one with a biomedical
engineering degree from Johns Hopkins.

212
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:09,400
Among several other degrees.

213
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,636
Maybe that's why you got picked
for the cover art.

214
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:17,962
Come in.

215
00:10:20,342 --> 00:10:21,083
Ma'am.

216
00:10:26,947 --> 00:10:27,647
Hi.

217
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:37,471
Yes.

218
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:38,931
From NCIS?

219
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:39,832
Yep.

220
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:48,109
I asked you here...

221
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:50,910
"Asked me." That's a good one.

222
00:10:52,238 --> 00:10:53,946
... at the request
of Dr. Phillip Heller.

223
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:55,681
He's in charge of a...

224
00:10:55,913 --> 00:10:57,672
rather special project.

225
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,452
Is it a military project?

226
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,788
Funded by the military,
but Tarburst is an independent agency.

227
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:05,958
I'm not familiar
with Dr. Heller's work.

228
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:08,228
No, but he is with yours.

229
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:12,241
He was quite impressed with your paper
on Zinc Finger Nucleases in DNA Binding.

230
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:16,260
What kind of project are we talking
about exactly?

231
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:20,306
Not the kind of project
we can talk about.

232
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:23,235
It's why I was reluctant to allow
your participation initially.

233
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,312
This is a highly classified matter.

234
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:27,825
So, what changed?

235
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:31,653
Dr. Heller is no longer
with the program, and we...

236
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:33,986
your country...

237
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:36,265
need your help.

238
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:40,072
What do you need?

239
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:44,829
Welcome to The Cave.

240
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:46,707
The Cave?

241
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,583
You should rename
this place Nirvana.

242
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,756
Dr. Heller was given
a sizable budget.

243
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:56,175
I can see that.

244
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:58,177
And almost complete autonomy.

245
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,304
All information
was compartmentalized,

246
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:03,117
strictly need-to-know.
Only three other people, besides myself,

247
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:05,059
even knew of the existence
of this program.

248
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:07,894
- Knew?
- Two of the original team members

249
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:11,024
died in a roadside bomb attack
in Afghanistan.

250
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:14,209
Which is why Dr. Heller's departure
from the program has become...

251
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:15,659
quite a problem.

252
00:12:16,312 --> 00:12:19,145
This was sold to the Senate
Select Committee on a warning

253
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,659
of a grave and gathering threat.

254
00:12:23,015 --> 00:12:25,309
What exactly was
Dr. Heller working on?

255
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:27,693
That's the problem.

256
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:29,653
We don't know.

257
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:46,142
Patients aren't allowed on this floor.
How did you get in here?

258
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:48,894
It's a hospital, isn't it?
How do you think?

259
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:51,313
No, the hospital's upstairs.
This is...

260
00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:53,127
I know what this is, Sunshine.

261
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:56,105
I've escaped from P.O.W. camps
with better security.

262
00:13:00,035 --> 00:13:01,606
Just exercising the lungs.

263
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,118
Retired Marine.

264
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:07,399
Sergeant Major Robert King, N.C.

265
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:09,457
N.C.?

266
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:12,668
Not contagious.
In case you were worried.

267
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:14,587
I was.

268
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:17,705
Where's Heller?

269
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:19,175
We got a game to finish.

270
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,257
Dr. Heller, he's...

271
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,825
he's no longer with the project.

272
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:29,373
- He isn't, huh?
- No.

273
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:34,054
Well, doesn't that seem
a little strange?

274
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:36,317
I mean, you know, considering...

275
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:38,146
Considering what?

276
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:42,615
God gave you a body, I'll give him that.
Skimped on the brain, though.

277
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,287
Don't know how well
you know the doctor,

278
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:49,772
but if you knew Heller,

279
00:13:49,832 --> 00:13:52,177
you'd know he wouldn't run off
and leave all this.

280
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:56,295
She found me.

281
00:13:58,332 --> 00:13:59,032
Who?

282
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,557
Nurse Dunstan.

283
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:03,385
Makes Al Qaeda look
like Jiminy Cricket.

284
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:09,206
I'm sorry.

285
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:12,061
He knows he's not supposed
to come down here.

286
00:14:14,614 --> 00:14:17,815
None of the patients are supposed
to come down here.

287
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,422
I won't tell.

288
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:21,654
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

289
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:24,877
Next time you get out of bed,
I'm having you catheterized.

290
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:26,825
You wish.

291
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:32,649
Nurse Dunstan...
your liaison with the hospital.

292
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:35,075
If you need anything, extension 405.

293
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:35,990
Thank you.

294
00:14:36,738 --> 00:14:38,754
And the lab rabbits
should be here by 12:00.

295
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:42,533
Hopefully this batch lasts longer
than the last.

296
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,112
Quick march.

297
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:52,719
Are you gonna help me, or are you
gonna keep screwing around back there?

298
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:55,810
Every single drawer in this lab
is unlocked except this one.

299
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,719
You're not wondering what's inside?

300
00:14:58,394 --> 00:15:00,901
I'm wondering where Palmer is
with the rest of that DNA.

301
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:02,756
Right here.

302
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:05,696
Here you go. Thought
I might be able to help you guys.

303
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:07,791
I do have lab experience.

304
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:11,296
And I have a biomedical engineering
degree from Johns Hopkins.

305
00:15:11,356 --> 00:15:12,830
He sure does love saying that.

306
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:14,790
Hey, will you put
the screwdriver down,

307
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:17,786
come in here, and hand me
the ethidium bromide, please?

308
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:18,836
I got it.

309
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,090
I don't think that's right...

310
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,930
I don't think
you're supposed to do that.

311
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:27,982
All right.

312
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:31,185
Next step is to... mix the gel

313
00:15:31,823 --> 00:15:34,092
- with the ethidium bromide.
- I don't think you're supposed

314
00:15:34,152 --> 00:15:36,570
to do that. I think you're supposed
to microwave the gel first...

315
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,398
All right, Mr. Johns Hopkins,
Mr. Biomedical Degree.

316
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,258
You go ahead.

317
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,790
- That's not good.
- Nope.

318
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,423
Knucklehead.

319
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:51,368
Lucky for you Abby's not here,
Hopkins.

320
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:56,290
<i>Why is McGee lucky that I'm not there
and who is Hopkins?</i>

321
00:15:57,996 --> 00:15:58,985
Where are you?

322
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,564
<i>I'm at a public hospital
just outside the city.</i>

323
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:04,110
<i>That's all I can say. They took
my cell phone away when I got here,</i>

324
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,162
<i>but I was able to open
a video port into my lab...</i>

325
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:08,009
<i>or...</i>

326
00:16:08,374 --> 00:16:09,637
<i>what's left of my lab.</i>

327
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:10,978
He'll clean it up.

328
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:12,931
- We'll clean it up.
- They'll clean it up.

329
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:16,226
<i>You'll all clean it up. But I need you
to run a background for me first.</i>

330
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:18,485
Background on who?
Is everything all right?

331
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,250
<i>I e-mailed the info to McGee.</i>

332
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:21,844
You didn't answer the question.

333
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:23,984
<i>Everything is fine.
Okay, I got to go.</i>

334
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:27,738
<i>I shouldn't leave this video port open.
And Tony, screwdrivers...</i>

335
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:29,943
<i>they leave tool marks
on locked drawers.</i>

336
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,101
It's our dead guy's car.

337
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:39,290
And he appears
to have been living in it.

338
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:40,959
What is it doing here?
We're almost

339
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,958
two miles away from the loading dock
where the victim's body was found.

340
00:16:44,157 --> 00:16:47,024
That is a long distance
to have wandered after the attack.

341
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:49,903
Well, if there was an attack here.

342
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:52,221
No sign of a struggle.

343
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,407
There are houses not too far away.

344
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:59,091
Maybe our victim parked here
for a planned rendezvous of some kind.

345
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:00,919
Maybe.

346
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,528
This is nice.

347
00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:11,894
Being able to work
without Tony's incessant babbling.

348
00:17:13,178 --> 00:17:14,750
It is almost as if he cannot...

349
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,329
go on for more than 30 seconds
without hearing his own voice.

350
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,525
You know, the truly amazing thing is
that he fails to realize

351
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:23,711
just how irritating
he is to those around him.

352
00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:27,256
Yes, Gibbs?

353
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:28,716
Babbling.

354
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:40,728
- Gibbs?
- What?!

355
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,283
Victim's trunk.

356
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,973
I'm not so sure our victim
was the intended victim.

357
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:55,873
Come in.

358
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,658
Mr. Jones.

359
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:01,311
Any progress?

360
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,115
I'm done.

361
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:08,922
- That was fast.
- Well, it's pretty esoteric stuff.

362
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:11,133
Basically, Dr. Heller was...

363
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:15,387
attempting to hijack DNA's end-joining
pathways in order to...

364
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:18,064
Target a specific strand
of a person's DNA?

365
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:21,270
Why do I get the feeling
you already knew that?

366
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:23,660
Maybe because I already knew that.

367
00:18:25,378 --> 00:18:26,535
Was he successful?

368
00:18:27,352 --> 00:18:29,693
He was close. What do you mean
you already knew that?

369
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:34,351
Given the sensitive nature
of this project,

370
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:37,476
I had to make sure you were the real
McCoy before I fully read you in.

371
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:38,636
So you lied.

372
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:41,663
And I didn't lose a minute's sleep.
Is that a problem?

373
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:42,502
No.

374
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:44,124
Not at all.

375
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:46,502
Lie to me again.
It was awesome.

376
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:49,423
- Nice knowing you.
- Wait. Miss Sciuto.

377
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:51,548
You can't leave.

378
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:53,050
Really? That's funny.

379
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:55,093
'Cause it really seems...

380
00:18:55,173 --> 00:18:57,805
like I'm, you know, leaving.

381
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,480
Okay, just out of curiosity,

382
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:08,565
why can't I leave?

383
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,692
Because if you don't help us...

384
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:15,217
they're all going to die.

385
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,806
Let's hear it.

386
00:19:31,877 --> 00:19:33,586
Did you find anything good
at Riggs' car?

387
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:36,009
Actually, yes.
We found a...

388
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:37,803
What is that smell?

389
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:39,641
Still?

390
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:42,723
You're kidding me.
I washed my hands a dozen times.

391
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:44,434
- Wash 'em again.
- Sorry, boss.

392
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:48,231
Had a little mishap in Abby's lab,
running the DNA on Riggs' attacker.

393
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,484
More like Riggs' victim.

394
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:52,776
The contents of Riggs' trunk suggest
he was planning on burying a body.

395
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,821
- You think he was on some kind of hit?
- Until it went bad.

396
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:59,011
He apparently did not count
on his target fighting back.

397
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:00,827
Do we have any idea
who his victim was?

398
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:04,684
I do. Palmer and I just finished running
the DNA from under Riggs' fingernails.

399
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:06,643
You already tell Gibbs?

400
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,406
Tell Gibbs what?

401
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:10,465
You found the target.

402
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:11,608
What?

403
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:15,090
This is Dr. Heller. It's the guy
Abby wanted us to run background on.

404
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,681
Abby was asked to take over for Heller
when he went missing.

405
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:24,482
Well, I'm guessing
he disappeared because...

406
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,441
Someone was trying to kill him.

407
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:29,551
And Abby has just taken his place.

408
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:44,161
<i>Agent Gibbs, I appreciate your concern
for my missing colleague,</i>

409
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:46,997
<i>but that's exactly why Miss Sciuto
needs to stay here right now.</i>

410
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:49,032
<i>You have to trust me on that.</i>

411
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:50,792
I don't trust you.

412
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:52,127
I don't know you.

413
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:54,346
<i>I sympathize with your position...</i>

414
00:20:54,564 --> 00:20:57,180
It's your choice! You either tell me
what's going on or...

415
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,052
<i>- Or what? You'll threaten me?</i>
- Well, you know what?

416
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,321
That depends.

417
00:21:01,485 --> 00:21:04,431
You consider
a public investigation a threat?

418
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,687
We are on the same team.

419
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,868
<i>About a year ago,</i>

420
00:21:16,654 --> 00:21:19,071
<i>my company became involved
in a larger medical study</i>

421
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:21,657
<i>of servicemen returning
from Afghanistan. It was...</i>

422
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:25,378
<i>rather routine until we discovered
small numbers were suffering</i>

423
00:21:25,438 --> 00:21:28,455
<i>from an undiagnosed illness that
was originally thought to be fatigue.</i>

424
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:30,533
<i>We alerted the military.</i>

425
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:33,470
<i>They didn't want to make the same
mistake they did with Gulf War Syndrome.</i>

426
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,163
Good. Good for them.

427
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:37,839
<i>We got a contract to research
the illness. We set up this lab.</i>

428
00:21:38,216 --> 00:21:40,759
<i>The hope was, if we could identify
the susceptible genotype,</i>

429
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:42,729
<i>a cure could be developed.</i>

430
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:46,501
Okay, well, obviously, somebody there
doesn't want that to happen.

431
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:49,017
<i>We don't know where Dr. Heller is.</i>

432
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:52,277
<i>All right, his disappearance may have
nothing to do with this research.</i>

433
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:54,621
Okay, until we find out,

434
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:56,608
I want Abby here.

435
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:58,573
<i>I'm afraid
that's not going to happen.</i>

436
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:00,737
Did I just not make myself clear?!

437
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,225
<i>You misunderstand me.</i>

438
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,847
<i>Hi, Gibbs.</i>

439
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:08,203
Hi, Abs.

440
00:22:09,183 --> 00:22:10,956
- You all right?
<i>- Everything's fine,</i>

441
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:14,668
<i> except you and I still have
to talk about the lab bunnies.</i>

442
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:16,628
<i>Listen, Gibbs,
I know what you're going to say.</i>

443
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:18,706
<i>You're worried
because someone is after the doctor,</i>

444
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:21,235
<i>and if someone's after the doctor
and I took over his job,</i>

445
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:23,677
<i>they might be after me.
But I don't care.</i>

446
00:22:23,932 --> 00:22:27,764
<i>These people are sick and I can
help them and I'm staying, period.</i>

447
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:30,471
<i>Besides, this is a secure hospital.</i>

448
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:32,561
<i>I'm just as safe here
as I would be at NCIS.</i>

449
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:34,771
<i>Safer, actually,
'cause they have bigger dogs.</i>

450
00:22:37,427 --> 00:22:40,490
<i>I'd tell you not to argue with her,
but, uh, I think you already know that.</i>

451
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:44,239
"Afghanistan War Syndrome."

452
00:22:44,427 --> 00:22:45,659
If this guy Heller...

453
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,931
was working on a cure,
why would someone try to kill him?

454
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,494
No connection
between PFC Riggs and Heller.

455
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:52,461
Maybe he was a hired gun?

456
00:22:52,802 --> 00:22:53,952
It is likely.

457
00:22:54,715 --> 00:22:55,751
So who hired him?

458
00:22:55,954 --> 00:22:57,287
Good question, McGee.

459
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,630
- Got the file from Jones?
- Yeah, reading it now.

460
00:23:01,176 --> 00:23:02,174
How is Abby?

461
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:03,592
Committed.

462
00:23:03,927 --> 00:23:06,219
You can say that again.
She'd be safer here.

463
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:08,929
Best way to protect her is
to solve our original case.

464
00:23:09,176 --> 00:23:10,223
Find Heller.

465
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:13,432
We cannot be sure the doctor's
disappearance is tied to his work.

466
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,645
And even if it is,
he's not going to be easy to find.

467
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:18,147
The FBI's had a BOLO out
since Monday.

468
00:23:22,232 --> 00:23:24,237
Dr. Phillip Heller,

469
00:23:24,593 --> 00:23:25,447
not M.D.

470
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:29,451
Got his PhD in molecular biology.
Did a post-doc on Gulf War Syndrome.

471
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,869
Wife, no kids, was treated
for a gambling addiction ten years ago.

472
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:35,497
- Which seems to be under control now.
- Credit card bills are low...

473
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:38,449
gas, groceries, flowers.
Does not spend more than he earns.

474
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:41,761
He was working at a V.A. hospital
when he joined Jones' program.

475
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:47,219
Start with the wife.

476
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:01,508
On your six, boss.

477
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:12,476
I love a woman
who's good with her hands.

478
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,079
And smart, too.

479
00:24:18,671 --> 00:24:21,063
I thought you said
God skimped on the brains.

480
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:23,433
Well, I'm a man of contradictions.

481
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:24,926
Am I interrupting?

482
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:28,509
Yes.

483
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:32,264
You got anything else?

484
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,015
It's giving me a headache.

485
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:36,184
Thank you.

486
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,120
I'm on the run.

487
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:40,809
It's bath time.

488
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:45,235
"Nurse Ratched" takes a little bit
too much pleasure in it for my taste.

489
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:47,445
It's a shame,

490
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:50,365
'cause if she was my type,
this would be the setup of a lifetime.

491
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,814
You're not asking me any questions.

492
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:04,628
Must mean you already got
your answers.

493
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:14,681
You're sick, aren't you?

494
00:25:15,403 --> 00:25:16,554
You have it.

495
00:25:18,195 --> 00:25:20,270
Take a guess at the first question.

496
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,321
But what is "it"?

497
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:25,490
That's the million-dollar mystery.

498
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,070
Have you finished isolating our...

499
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:31,230
genes or whatever it is
you're doing down here?

500
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:34,242
I'm close.

501
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:37,780
That's what Heller used to say.

502
00:25:38,728 --> 00:25:40,206
Look what happened to him.

503
00:25:42,219 --> 00:25:43,084
He...

504
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:45,303
he got...

505
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:47,172
transferred.

506
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:48,840
You're a horrible liar.

507
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:50,097
I know.

508
00:25:52,602 --> 00:25:54,480
Me, I lied for a living.

509
00:25:55,544 --> 00:25:57,599
Used to run some
of the biggest black ops in...

510
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,726
Panama, both Gulf Wars, Afghanistan.

511
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:04,272
I was very important.

512
00:26:06,354 --> 00:26:07,706
You're still important.

513
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,089
Yeah,

514
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:10,654
as a guinea pig,

515
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,280
nothing else, just like...

516
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:13,396
him.

517
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:15,611
That's okay, I guess.

518
00:26:16,496 --> 00:26:17,710
When I signed up,

519
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:20,705
it was because I was willing to die
for my country, and I still am.

520
00:26:21,168 --> 00:26:23,667
I dodged a bullet,
more than my fair share,

521
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:26,168
but these boys today are... they...

522
00:26:26,983 --> 00:26:29,756
you know, they drill 'em to survive
gunshot wounds, land mines,

523
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,591
air strikes.

524
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:36,388
Nobody warned 'em about
"synergistic effects"

525
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,473
"of battlefield contaminants".

526
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:40,225
Check.

527
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:44,201
Sorry, I'm just that good.

528
00:26:47,722 --> 00:26:49,442
We're going to figure this out,
you know.

529
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,029
Don't make any promises
you can't keep.

530
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:55,282
But I got one that you can.

531
00:26:58,923 --> 00:26:59,873
Anything.

532
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,589
Whatever this thing is,

533
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:06,668
just don't let 'em name it after me.

534
00:27:08,283 --> 00:27:09,004
Deal.

535
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,951
But you have to do something for me.

536
00:27:12,485 --> 00:27:13,435
Anything.

537
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:16,601
Did you really escape
from a P.O.W. camp?

538
00:27:17,048 --> 00:27:17,748
Twice.

539
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:18,763
Why?

540
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:21,174
His buddies.

541
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:22,408
Rescue mission.

542
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:29,382
I'm in.

543
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:35,726
Garage sales.

544
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:37,221
Always a little strange.

545
00:27:37,735 --> 00:27:39,323
I mean, what is this stuff?

546
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,624
What is that?

547
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:42,829
One man's junk is
another man's junk.

548
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,197
Excuse me, are you Lois Heller?

549
00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:47,594
Yeah.

550
00:27:48,145 --> 00:27:49,839
Need to talk to you
about your husband.

551
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:52,505
He's dead.

552
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:55,300
No, no,
we just don't know where he is.

553
00:27:56,737 --> 00:27:58,205
Well, that makes two of us.

554
00:27:58,613 --> 00:27:59,863
What are you...

555
00:27:59,923 --> 00:28:00,930
a 42 long?

556
00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:04,298
Well, that's...

557
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:06,667
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

558
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,734
About three days ago,
if you could call it speaking.

559
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:12,400
We don't exactly have
what you'd call a good marriage.

560
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,819
- Yeah, I'm picking up on that.
- Here, it's about your size.

561
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,389
He give you any idea where he was?

562
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:17,571
Five bucks.

563
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:19,586
I'll give you three.
Is this your husband's?

564
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:24,295
All right, look,

565
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:25,955
the FBI have already been here,

566
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:27,957
and I've already told them
everything I know.

567
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,419
My husband said he was going out
for a walk and he never came back.

568
00:28:31,862 --> 00:28:33,775
Far as I'm concerned,
he doesn't need to.

569
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,488
You should think about that coat.

570
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,065
It'd look good on you.

571
00:28:38,478 --> 00:28:39,829
Yeah, thanks.

572
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:44,391
Well, I guess we got motive. Doesn't
strike me as the kind of girl who'd...

573
00:28:44,643 --> 00:28:45,916
hire a hit man, though.

574
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:47,977
No, she'd rather do it herself.

575
00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:49,397
Should we bring her in?

576
00:28:49,457 --> 00:28:50,861
Flowers first.

577
00:28:51,157 --> 00:28:52,024
Flowers?

578
00:28:52,084 --> 00:28:53,534
Husband's credit card.

579
00:28:53,594 --> 00:28:55,832
Don't think
he was sending them to her.

580
00:28:57,548 --> 00:28:58,671
Girlfriend, right.

581
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:03,076
We traced the flowers to a house
in Landover owned by a Maggie Smith.

582
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:05,633
She claimed
Heller was not there, but

583
00:29:06,098 --> 00:29:07,080
I smelled fish.

584
00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:11,709
What?

585
00:29:12,742 --> 00:29:14,379
Fishy, something fishy.

586
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,842
We found Dr. Heller hiding inside.
Tried to run when he saw us.

587
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,470
He did not get far,
and he was carrying this.

588
00:29:24,322 --> 00:29:25,223
A stun gun.

589
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:28,726
Matches the same marks
Ducky found on PFC Riggs' neck.

590
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,183
You recognize him?

591
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:39,487
Yes.

592
00:29:39,935 --> 00:29:41,378
You want to tell me about it?

593
00:29:43,105 --> 00:29:44,534
I had nothing to do with that.

594
00:29:45,022 --> 00:29:48,746
Well, then, how did your DNA end up
underneath his fingernails?

595
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:54,252
I would be thrilled to sit here
and just charge you with murder.

596
00:29:54,688 --> 00:29:55,538
Murder?

597
00:29:56,006 --> 00:29:57,255
He tried to kill me.

598
00:29:57,532 --> 00:29:59,424
Like I said,
you want to tell me about it?

599
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:04,262
I came home
from work three days ago.

600
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,191
Needed to clear my head,
so I took a walk.

601
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:08,766
Suddenly this guy grabs me,
shoves a gun in my face.

602
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:10,602
I defended myself.

603
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:12,006
Is that a crime?

604
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,401
You always carry one of these?

605
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,029
Lately.

606
00:30:22,183 --> 00:30:24,872
You didn't go back home,
you didn't call the police. Why?

607
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,827
The police?
People get mugged all the time.

608
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:30,830
I figured the guy'd be long gone
before the police even got there.

609
00:30:32,784 --> 00:30:34,083
I'm telling you the truth.

610
00:30:34,191 --> 00:30:35,835
I didn't say you weren't.

611
00:30:37,495 --> 00:30:38,796
But you're not.

612
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:42,467
You didn't go back home
because they knew where you lived.

613
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:44,928
This wasn't a mugging,
this was a hit.

614
00:30:45,816 --> 00:30:46,804
That's crazy.

615
00:30:48,116 --> 00:30:49,659
A hit on me?

616
00:30:49,868 --> 00:30:52,185
Unless you think
my wife hired somebody.

617
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:53,882
I know about the lab...

618
00:30:54,535 --> 00:30:56,814
and I know about the cure
you were researching.

619
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,361
- That's classified.
- And that's a dead body!

620
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:03,385
I already got you at manslaughter.

621
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,573
I can prove intent,
I got you at murder.

622
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:06,355
Wait...

623
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:09,244
You tell me what's going on,
or you call your damn lawyer!

624
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:14,290
- Why is somebody trying to kill you?
- Because I discovered the truth.

625
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:20,421
Tarburst tried to hide it.

626
00:31:21,786 --> 00:31:25,751
The tasks were compartmentalized,
ostensibly for security purposes.

627
00:31:26,379 --> 00:31:29,070
Isolate a genome,
find a suitable viral vector.

628
00:31:30,203 --> 00:31:31,390
They manipulated me.

629
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:35,186
All I could see were the technical
hurdles and not the big picture.

630
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:36,312
Which was what?

631
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,701
People were sick,

632
00:31:40,587 --> 00:31:42,502
but I wasn't working on a cure.

633
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:46,231
I was building a weapon.

634
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:57,509
I don't know where they came from,
but suddenly

635
00:31:57,569 --> 00:31:59,919
there was, like, a dozen rabbits
running through the halls.

636
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:01,629
Ready to celebrate?

637
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:07,051
- Where is he?
- Hang on a second.

638
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:14,142
This is...
is Sergeant King's room, right?

639
00:32:14,786 --> 00:32:15,636
It was.

640
00:32:16,784 --> 00:32:17,687
I'm sorry.

641
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:19,401
You family?

642
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:23,901
Does it matter?

643
00:32:24,932 --> 00:32:26,087
Not really.

644
00:32:26,348 --> 00:32:27,677
Why don't you take a minute.

645
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:30,160
Sorry about that.
It's been a long day.

646
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,435
Well...

647
00:32:41,616 --> 00:32:42,962
the good news is, I did it.

648
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,468
I isolated the...

649
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:48,585
Never mind.

650
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:51,568
You would find that so boring.

651
00:32:52,914 --> 00:32:53,972
It's not a cure...

652
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,794
but it maybe, someday...

653
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,353
would...

654
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:00,104
I found her!

655
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:04,177
You're all right?

656
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:06,668
No.

657
00:33:07,363 --> 00:33:08,613
What are you doing here?

658
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,032
The lab is secure.

659
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:17,038
What's going on?

660
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:30,593
- Abs, you okay?
- Do I look okay?

661
00:33:30,674 --> 00:33:32,381
What is Abby's rule number one?

662
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:33,971
"Do not lie to Abby."

663
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:36,481
We left Heller
in charge at the hospital.

664
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:39,894
Unfortunately, someone has already
downloaded all of Abby's research.

665
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:42,169
Research?
It was a weapon.

666
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,273
People were dying,
and I was a building a weapon.

667
00:33:44,742 --> 00:33:46,859
Jones is gone.
Aide said he left in a hurry.

668
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,278
- I'll put out a BOLO.
- I'll coordinate with local LEOs.

669
00:33:51,873 --> 00:33:52,740
How bad?

670
00:33:55,058 --> 00:33:57,167
Jones had me create an enzyme

671
00:33:57,227 --> 00:33:59,372
to target the genomes
of the sick soldiers.

672
00:34:00,137 --> 00:34:02,500
- Is that bad?
- By itself, it's innocuous,

673
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:04,001
but then,

674
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:06,748
he had Dr. Heller
create an immunogen

675
00:34:06,808 --> 00:34:09,757
to help the immune system
kill off foreign invaders.

676
00:34:09,991 --> 00:34:12,510
That's bad.
No, it's the way every vaccine works.

677
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,303
Yeah, but
when you put them together...

678
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:17,098
You can target
someone via their DNA.

679
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:20,560
You can infect an entire water supply
and only kill your intended victim.

680
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:22,459
We both made a piece of it.

681
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,275
Heller made the bullet,
and I made the gun.

682
00:34:26,328 --> 00:34:27,845
Assassination made easy.

683
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,445
But really, I mean,
a gun would be easier.

684
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,817
Didn't build it to kill someone.

685
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,491
Built it to sell it.

686
00:34:36,925 --> 00:34:37,869
Perfect.

687
00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:40,290
"Hi, I'm Abby Sciuto,"

688
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:42,338
"international bioweapons dealer".

689
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:44,959
Wait a second. How did Jones get it
past his supervisors?

690
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:46,886
Sick soldiers.

691
00:34:47,497 --> 00:34:48,963
You don't ask too many questions.

692
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:51,361
Oh, my God.

693
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:59,498
Come on, damn it!

694
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:03,072
Come on...

695
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,219
Oh, no.

696
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,990
- <i>Yeah, Abs.</i>
- Tony, check your inbox...

697
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,182
- I need another BOLO ASAP.
- <i>Have you talked to Gibbs?</i>

698
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:28,960
I didn't talk to Gibbs yet.
Just do it!

699
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,912
<i>All right.</i>

700
00:35:31,052 --> 00:35:32,842
I can hear you staring.

701
00:35:34,108 --> 00:35:35,338
What'd you find, Ab?

702
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:37,261
It's what I didn't find, Gibbs.

703
00:35:37,616 --> 00:35:40,508
I don't think there ever was
an Afghanistan War Syndrome.

704
00:35:40,568 --> 00:35:41,992
Soldiers were getting sick,

705
00:35:42,221 --> 00:35:44,185
'cause soldiers do,
but look at this.

706
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:47,472
Someone in the lab was swapping out
their diseased blood

707
00:35:47,532 --> 00:35:48,868
with healthy samples.

708
00:35:48,928 --> 00:35:51,245
Doctors had sick patients,
but normal test results.

709
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:52,819
They couldn't find a cause.

710
00:35:53,104 --> 00:35:55,529
They thought they had another mystery
war syndrome on their hands.

711
00:35:55,741 --> 00:35:57,093
Jones tricked the army.

712
00:35:57,684 --> 00:35:59,200
They had no idea what was going on.

713
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:02,203
He got them to finance the project,
and he wasn't alone.

714
00:36:04,758 --> 00:36:08,376
Nurse Dunstan was the nurse on call
every time there was a blood test.

715
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:11,559
I thought it was just a coincidence.

716
00:36:11,876 --> 00:36:13,375
She was in on it with Jones.

717
00:36:13,662 --> 00:36:15,007
I should have seen it, Gibbs.

718
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:18,970
Aren't you going
to give me a pep talk?

719
00:36:20,798 --> 00:36:21,507
No.

720
00:36:22,802 --> 00:36:23,569
Why?

721
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,790
Because you're pissed.

722
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:27,520
And you should be.

723
00:36:30,262 --> 00:36:32,070
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- <i>A body's been found...</i>

724
00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:33,694
Where?

725
00:36:38,194 --> 00:36:40,122
A hiker saw her body being dumped.

726
00:36:40,182 --> 00:36:42,001
- Get a description?
- Nothing useful.

727
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:45,728
She was on the way to the coroner
when the local LEOs got our BOLO.

728
00:36:45,994 --> 00:36:49,583
An on-site assessment report
indicates manual strangulation.

729
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,530
It appears she and Jones had
a falling out.

730
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,754
He didn't need her anymore.
He was tying up loose ends.

731
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:55,929
We have a tire print.
Abby is running it.

732
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:59,760
I imagine this must have been
quite an ordeal for her.

733
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:01,220
How is she doing?

734
00:37:01,935 --> 00:37:03,306
Much better now.

735
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:05,936
Boss, no luck on the tire prints,

736
00:37:05,996 --> 00:37:09,234
but Abby has been monitoring
every cell tower in the tri-state area.

737
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:11,939
She picked up a data fetch
from Jones' smartphone.

738
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:14,865
He was checking
airline departure times.

739
00:37:14,925 --> 00:37:16,962
- You get an airline?
- And a flight number.

740
00:37:20,382 --> 00:37:23,291
You messed
with the wrong forensic scientist.

741
00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:27,876
Did I miss it?

742
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,406
No, he's letting him sit.

743
00:37:29,852 --> 00:37:30,624
Sit?

744
00:37:30,705 --> 00:37:31,876
He gets a chair?!

745
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:33,637
He...

746
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:35,723
he kills bunnies!

747
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:46,699
I'm impressed.

748
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:49,018
Didn't expect anyone
to come looking for me so soon.

749
00:37:49,448 --> 00:37:51,228
One-way ticket to Chile?

750
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:53,483
You got family there?

751
00:37:55,498 --> 00:37:57,151
- I want to make a deal.
- Yeah?

752
00:37:57,867 --> 00:37:58,903
If I cooperate.

753
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:00,738
Oh, you're going to cooperate.

754
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,368
Look, I'm not proud of what I did,

755
00:38:05,834 --> 00:38:06,863
but with the...

756
00:38:07,395 --> 00:38:09,498
budget cutbacks and...

757
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,321
looking at my pension, I just...

758
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,253
... I figured I deserved more.

759
00:38:16,457 --> 00:38:18,130
And you were willing to kill for it?

760
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:20,549
Kill?

761
00:38:22,612 --> 00:38:25,136
He actually seems
legitimately surprised.

762
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,263
He does.

763
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:28,516
What exactly am I under arrest for?

764
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,435
- I haven't placed you under arrest.
- And when you do?

765
00:38:36,709 --> 00:38:38,363
- Oh, my God.
- Murder.

766
00:38:38,629 --> 00:38:40,207
Conspiracy to defraud.

767
00:38:40,782 --> 00:38:42,398
Throw in medical malpractice.

768
00:38:43,716 --> 00:38:45,084
This is a mistake. I...

769
00:38:45,443 --> 00:38:46,450
So cooperate.

770
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:50,079
- Who's your buyer?
- My buyer?

771
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:53,916
I know you're selling
the research from Tarburst's program.

772
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,057
I'm not selling anything
from the program.

773
00:38:58,176 --> 00:39:01,132
- Why were you running?
- Because I was embezzling from it.

774
00:39:05,296 --> 00:39:08,222
I was running because Abby succeeded.

775
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,307
<i>That would mean a GAO audit.</i>

776
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:13,713
It would uncover what I did.
I planned to be long gone before then.

777
00:39:13,773 --> 00:39:15,229
I just didn't plan it so soon.

778
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:21,861
I have records, I could prove it.
I don't know anything

779
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:23,420
- about a conspiracy.
- Liar!

780
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,883
Sorry, Gibbs.

781
00:39:25,943 --> 00:39:28,451
You set up the lab
so you could sell my research!

782
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,202
I did not set up the lab.
I don't know who did set up the lab.

783
00:39:31,283 --> 00:39:33,260
I was ordered to run the lab,
that's what I did.

784
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,916
Sergeant King didn't get the help
he needed because

785
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:38,252
you falsified his medical records.

786
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:39,830
Who?

787
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,085
You don't even know his name.

788
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:46,886
Sergeant Robert...

789
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:47,815
King.

790
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:50,973
He's one of the patients
in your program.

791
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:54,271
I know everyone's name
in that program.

792
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:56,349
There is no Sergeant King.

793
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,281
Find him.

794
00:40:23,466 --> 00:40:25,591
You look pretty good for a dead guy,

795
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:27,718
except for the blood draining
out of your face.

796
00:40:27,948 --> 00:40:29,762
Tom, right?

797
00:40:30,073 --> 00:40:31,955
That's your real name, isn't it?

798
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,558
What did I do wrong?

799
00:40:36,781 --> 00:40:38,536
You made me care about you.

800
00:40:39,891 --> 00:40:43,442
You're under arrest for the murder
of Nurse Hannah Dunstan.

801
00:40:43,523 --> 00:40:46,695
That is correct, and many, many more bad
things, because you're a very bad man.

802
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:50,157
Little tip: next time you're playing
chess with a forensic specialist...

803
00:40:50,636 --> 00:40:52,832
- Wear gloves.
- And try to find better help.

804
00:40:52,892 --> 00:40:54,286
Your little buddy, PFC Riggs,

805
00:40:54,623 --> 00:40:56,872
was sending you unencrypted e-mails.

806
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,500
Might as well put a big bull's-eye
on your laptop.

807
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:03,837
Why?

808
00:41:05,435 --> 00:41:07,594
Kept you from asking
too many questions.

809
00:41:08,475 --> 00:41:10,379
And I like to stay close
when I'm running an op.

810
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:11,335
An op?

811
00:41:12,272 --> 00:41:14,473
Op... is that what you call
betraying your country?

812
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,851
You have no idea
what I've done for my country.

813
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,561
Yeah, I do. I read your file.

814
00:41:18,887 --> 00:41:21,721
You're the go-to guy
for setting up black ops, right?

815
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:25,693
Specialty was bioweapons
defense research.

816
00:41:26,262 --> 00:41:28,683
Figured it was time to branch out,
do a little freelancing?

817
00:41:28,743 --> 00:41:31,063
Like I said,
I'm a man of contradictions.

818
00:41:35,116 --> 00:41:36,558
All right, here we go.

819
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:37,663
Is that it?

820
00:41:40,175 --> 00:41:41,625
That all you have to say?

821
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:45,702
Checkmate.

822
00:41:55,504 --> 00:41:57,198
Thought she wasn't coming in.

823
00:41:57,258 --> 00:41:58,184
Neither did I.

824
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:02,188
Vance told her to take a week off.
Maybe she wanted to work.

825
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,992
What are you doing down here?

826
00:42:06,766 --> 00:42:08,094
I don't know. I got...

827
00:42:08,154 --> 00:42:10,832
an e-mail from Gibbs. Told me
to meet him down here in the lab.

828
00:42:10,892 --> 00:42:11,842
So did I.

829
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:13,908
Probies first.

830
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:27,739
Come on...

831
00:42:27,938 --> 00:42:29,753
Gibbs doesn't use e-mail.

832
00:42:30,196 --> 00:42:31,530
Hi, guys.

833
00:42:41,297 --> 00:42:42,758
We've been set up.
