2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,693
You want to make a statement?

3
00:00:04,753 --> 00:00:06,256
You wanna gangsta up, homie?

4
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:08,030
- Yeah.
- You got to go bold, all right?

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,426
Double action old school.

6
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:12,305
It's sweet, it's simple, accurate,

7
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:14,349
never jams.
Here we go, give it a try.

8
00:00:15,027 --> 00:00:17,227
- Where?
- I don't know, just shoot the pipe.

9
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:21,818
Nice shot.

10
00:00:23,532 --> 00:00:25,027
- What else you got?
- All right.

11
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:26,902
Got the homie's best friend here,
all right?

12
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,406
It's a 9 mil, it's Beretta.
It's Italian.

13
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:31,449
All right,
it's 15 plus one in the snout.

14
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,784
I'll throw in a box
of hollow point hot loads. Trust me,

15
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:35,912
your stuff will be safe, okay?
Here, here we go.

16
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:42,627
Bad boy is tight!

17
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,921
You ain't seen the baddest boy yet,
all right?

18
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:49,384
Sweet Mother of God.

19
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:51,469
The pagans shall quake.

20
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:55,515
It's a TEC-9. It's top of the line.
Fully automatic.

21
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:57,976
You can empty the clip
in four seconds flat.

22
00:00:58,056 --> 00:00:59,768
- Are you man enough for this?
- Yeah.

23
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:00,825
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

24
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:02,985
All right,
give it a shot, give it a ride.

25
00:01:07,423 --> 00:01:09,096
- You like that?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,332
You're looking taller already,
buddy.

27
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:28,982
Let's get the hell out of here!
Let's go! Let's go!

32
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,458
- Miss anything, McLovin?
- Just this.

33
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:05,960
It's from a woman named Melinda.
She had to postpone.

34
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:08,171
- Postpone what?
- I don't know.

35
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,660
Figured that you'd figure it out.

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,217
- How did she sound?
- How did she sound?

37
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:16,261
I ask the question, you give the answer.
How did she sound?

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,555
I don't know, Tony.

39
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:18,806
You don't know.

40
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:22,350
Well, why don't you try using
your words, Mr. Gemcity?

41
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,590
Devastated?

42
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:25,063
Despondent?

43
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,221
Delighted.

44
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:27,649
All right.

45
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,151
- What's her number, McDetail?
- She didn't leave one.

46
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:32,755
 It's customary
to get a name, a number

47
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:35,992
and a complete message.
This is not a complete message.

48
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:37,601
This is a complete mess.

49
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:45,917
- How many Melindas do you have in?
- I don't know.

50
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,003
- The girl I talked to at the gym?
- You don't go to the gym.

51
00:02:49,993 --> 00:02:52,092
Maybe it was the girl
I talked to at the dog park.

52
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:53,554
You don't have a dog.

53
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:57,154
Could it be that girl
I met at the concession stand

54
00:02:57,214 --> 00:02:58,692
while my date was in the bathroom?

55
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:00,093
You need a secretary.

56
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,140
Or a therapist.

57
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:02,225
Or both.

58
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:04,477
Shots fired in Liberty Heights.
Saddle it up.

59
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:07,151
If we were called every time shots
were fired at Liberty Heights...

60
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,732
Yeah, well, Metro responded.
They found a dead Marine.

61
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:15,737
Victim is
Private First Class Emilio Salazar.

62
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,656
Joined the Marines four months ago.

63
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:19,341
Scheduled for deployment next week.

64
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,409
Ducky?

65
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,745
Stuck in traffic.
Should be here in about 20 minutes.

66
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,225
Nine millimeter shells.
Possibly two guns.

67
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:29,571
And based on the level
of penetration on that wall,

68
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,880
I would say .357.

69
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:34,965
No shells, which means a revolver.

70
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,426
One shooter, three weapons.

71
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:38,218
There's two sets of footprints.

72
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:41,763
- Shooter could have had a spotter.
- Or a lookout.

73
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:42,724
Or a witness.

74
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,795
New Marine regulations
don't allow for exposed ink.

75
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:53,817
He had his tat removed, laser.

76
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,446
Looks like...
"P..."

77
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,697
It looks like this.

78
00:03:58,403 --> 00:03:59,103
PCS.

79
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,669
All right,
I'll check with Metro's gang unit.

80
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:03,744
Bullets hit the skylight...

81
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:07,211
killing our Marine.

82
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:10,199
Sending him
on a very short bungee plunge.

83
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:12,836
But why shoot your hostage
from down here?

84
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:14,408
Maybe they were sending a message.

85
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:16,061
The kind of McGee takes...

86
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,379
cryptic, hard to decipher.

87
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:28,810
Blood.

88
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:33,106
This blood is dried.

89
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:36,486
But Metro made their "shots fired" call
less than an hour ago.

90
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:38,905
Looks like
the West just got a bit wilder.

91
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:41,824
Cuffs, boss.

92
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,454
Skin, blood...

93
00:04:47,027 --> 00:04:49,100
This guy was strapped up here
for a while.

94
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:51,584
That's why prefer the fur handcuffs.

95
00:04:52,714 --> 00:04:54,420
Not really, boss.
That's for her.

96
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:55,885
I don't wear the cuffs.

97
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:59,633
Someone was trying
to send a message.

98
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,384
Written in blood.

99
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:02,700
Phone number?

100
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:07,141
- Not a phone number.
- I don't know what the "G" stands for,

101
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:09,723
but it's nine digits.
Could be a military service number.

102
00:05:09,783 --> 00:05:11,989
- I'll run it.
- You don't have to.

103
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:15,390
It's mine.

104
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:24,775
Where is he?

105
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:26,414
I'm not exactly sure, Director.

106
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,062
Tell him I need to see him.

107
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,706
I will give him the message.

108
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:31,840
And the nature of the message.

109
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,127
I'll include who it's from
and the number.

110
00:05:35,142 --> 00:05:38,923
Why would anyone leave Gibbs' Marine
service number on a rooftop crime scene?

111
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:44,803
Agent Gibbs' desk.

112
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,641
No, he's not here.

113
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:49,438
But I'd be happy
to take a detailed message.

114
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:52,228
Flight arrives at 2:30.

115
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:55,273
Can I take a name
or a return number?

116
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:56,774
Okay. I will.

117
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:00,069
A name and a number.

118
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,440
Enough, okay?

119
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:04,584
I understand. I am sorry, but what do
you want me to do? You want me to sort

120
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:07,952
through the database of every call that
came into the switchboard this morning

121
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:11,290
and match the incoming call to your desk
phone using a date and a time stamp?

122
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,416
Yeah, actually.
That'd be great. Thanks.

123
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:18,718
Hey, boss, got two messages for you,
actually, right there. Sorry.

124
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,509
Director Vance wants you
to call him back ASAP, and the...

125
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:22,970
the other is...

126
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:25,039
And then there's that one.

127
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:30,286
It says that the flight arrives at 2:30.
It's from M Street Travel.

128
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:32,861
I assume it's a travel agent. Didn't say
where the flight was from or

129
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:35,445
who the passenger was, but if you want
to share that, you can feel...

130
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:36,355
Dead Marine?

131
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:39,235
PFC Emilio Salazar. Service record.

132
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:43,279
18-year-old. Completed basic training
at Parris Island two months ago and

133
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:45,604
was stationed at Quantico.

134
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,227
Had more than a service record.

135
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:51,291
Criminal record goes back to 2003,
when Emilio was 12.

136
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,595
All juvenile offenses.
All gang-related.

137
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:58,710
- Gang tattoos.
- Or <i>Pecados Capitales</i>.

138
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,792
Capital Fish?

139
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,006
Deadly Sins, you idiot.
Fish is <i>pescado</i>.

140
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:03,537
Don't scoff at me.

141
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:05,383
Lots of gangs are named
after deadly fish.

142
00:07:05,465 --> 00:07:06,852
There's the Sharks,

143
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:09,535
there's the Barracudas...

144
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:11,794
<i>Rumble Fish</i>.

145
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:13,725
These guys are also
known as the PCs.

146
00:07:13,806 --> 00:07:15,795
Sounds like your kind of gang,
McMotherboard.

147
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:20,143
Kid lives through six years in a gang,
can't survive four months as a Marine.

148
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:23,086
Maybe someone didn't want him
to leave the gang?

149
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:25,261
Maybe a rival gang killed him?

150
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,969
Though that wouldn't explain
your service number, boss.

151
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:30,659
Focus on tracking the killer.

152
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,702
And the other person
who may have been held there?

153
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:35,665
- Find the shooter.
- Vance wanted to call him ASAP, boss.

154
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:37,541
Heard you the first time, DiNozzo.

155
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:45,842
Private Jackson,

156
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:48,919
do not shut your eyes
when you squeeze the trigger!

157
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,567
Eyes off the toys, David.
We didn't come here to play.

158
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:56,894
I have not been
to the range in days.

159
00:07:57,418 --> 00:07:59,147
No talking on the range, please.

160
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,267
Well, that's going to be a real problem,
Staff Sergeant Medina,

161
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:03,651
'cause I'm real talky...

162
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:05,140
and I have a badge.

163
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:09,157
Is there somewhere we can talk?

164
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,148
Cease fire! Cease fire!

165
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:14,663
Clear and lock 'em!

166
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:15,798
Stand by!

167
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:18,727
Thank you.

168
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:23,921
A man in your unit
was killed last night.

169
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,675
How'd it happen?

170
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,051
Firefight. He lost.

171
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,290
- Someone shot him?
- Several times.

172
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,649
You know who did it?

173
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:34,223
If we did, we would not be here.

174
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,806
Thought you could help.

175
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:37,330
Any way I can.

176
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,452
He was killed in the neighborhood
where he grew up.

177
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:41,875
He ever talk about his past?
Gangs, trouble?

178
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:44,048
All the time.
He was trying to escape it.

179
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:46,672
So you knew he had a record
before he joined the Marines?

180
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:49,183
Some of these kids grew up in a jungle
a lot more dangerous

181
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:50,864
than the desert
we're sending them to.

182
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,336
Salazar ever drop names,
gang affiliations, enemies?

183
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:55,874
No, nothing specific.

184
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,694
He had troubles like any kid
who runs in gang circles,

185
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:00,596
but he didn't name anybody.

186
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,248
If you can think of anything,

187
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:04,485
let me know.

188
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,648
Berettas... nine millimeter.

189
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,633
Feel free.

190
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,346
- Do you mind?
- Not at all, ma'am.

191
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:15,614
Do your best.

192
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,150
Oh, God.

193
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,713
Stand by, station two,
for live fire!

194
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:31,480
I prefer the SIG.

195
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:35,050
A lot of women have trouble
with the Beretta.

196
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:37,097
Thing's got too much of a kick.

197
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,390
Your sight is a few millimeters off.

198
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,121
Really?

199
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:42,253
Really.

200
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:52,009
Prior to PFC Salazar's demise,

201
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:55,700
handcuffs made
these abrasions and lacerations.

202
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:57,628
Yeah, well,
he wasn't held there long.

203
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:01,419
No. He was executed almost
immediately upon his confinement.

204
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:03,008
As to the cause of death...

205
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:04,428
Gunshots.

206
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:05,689
Well, yes and no.

207
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,151
These wounds were made
by machine-gun fire.

208
00:10:09,472 --> 00:10:12,606
The spacing is too symmetrical
for random shooting.

209
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,854
Also, they showed no signs of redness
or braiding and bruising,

210
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:20,933
indicating that our private was
long dead when he was strafed.

211
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:22,563
How long?

212
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,341
About six hours based
on his liver temperature.

213
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:26,294
And here...

214
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:29,714
single round, nine millimeter

215
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,550
punctured the pericardial sac,

216
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:35,219
causing a cardiac tamponade.

217
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,470
He suffered greatly, Jethro...

218
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:39,681
perhaps for 20 or 30 minutes...

219
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:42,392
and he did not die quickly.

220
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:43,896
The bullet that killed him?

221
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:46,647
In the capable hands of Abby Sciuto.

222
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:51,745
You've never left a scene of a crime
before I arrived

223
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:53,425
until this one, Jethro.

224
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:56,866
Yeah.
Had something else to do.

225
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,119
Something to do
with your Marine Corps service number?

226
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,295
I was wondering
the same thing myself.

227
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:12,734
You're avoiding me.

228
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:16,564
I've been busy solving
a murder, Leon.

229
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:19,639
When I have something,
you'll be the first to know.

230
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:28,173
I'm looking for a Marine file.

231
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,818
A classified one.

232
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:31,367
Top secret, eyes only.

233
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:33,486
Black Ops.

234
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:37,448
Gunnery Sergeant Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

235
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:42,620
Next time you're having guests,
probie, have some scotch in the house.

236
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,682
You couldn't sweet-talk
the flight attendant out

237
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:48,078
- a few of those little bottles?
- He wasn't my type.

238
00:11:48,138 --> 00:11:48,878
Right.

239
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,669
What's so urgent?

240
00:11:51,348 --> 00:11:53,255
You pulled me away
from my granddaughter.

241
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:56,136
Just celebrated her second birthday.

242
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,887
I'm looking for somebody.

243
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:02,827
Rose.

244
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:06,539
Vance know I'm here yet?

245
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:08,112
Not yet.

246
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:10,690
Maybe I should borrow a tie.

247
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:15,204
Colombia was a long time ago, gunny.

248
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,030
Only one person knew about her.

249
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:35,153
You.

250
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:37,651
18 years is a long time, probie.

251
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:39,436
She's in D.C.

252
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:40,712
Today.

253
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:41,971
Mike.

254
00:12:44,316 --> 00:12:47,309
- What do you want me to say?
- Whatever you're not saying.

255
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:51,021
How do you know she's here,
for sure?

256
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,315
My Marine service number

257
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:55,278
was written
on the roof of a crime scene.

258
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:56,902
In blood.

259
00:12:58,352 --> 00:12:59,946
That could have been anybody.

260
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:04,034
I put a "G" on the end of it,
just for her.

261
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:08,526
I brought her here 17 years ago.

262
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:16,213
Where is she now?

263
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:19,132
I haven't seen her
since the day I dropped her off.

264
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:20,408
Let's start there.

265
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:39,585
You put her here?

266
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:41,893
Wasn't such a hellhole then.

267
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:43,991
<i>Que pasa?</i>

268
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:46,449
<i>Que es lo que miras?</i>

269
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:55,420
I'm looking for Rose Tamayo.

270
00:13:57,841 --> 00:14:00,047
<i>Ma, alguien esta a la puerta.</i>

271
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:05,554
<i>Que se les ofrece?</i>

272
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:07,848
<i>Buscando Rosa Tamayo?</i>

273
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,726
<i>Ella se murio hace diez años.</i>

274
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:14,522
We're a little late.

275
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:16,584
She died ten years ago.

276
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,221
Guess somebody else knows
your Marine service number, probie.

277
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:32,748
Howdy, Leon.

278
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:38,854
He has information
on a current case.

279
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:40,422
And I need his help.

280
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:45,886
Thanks for sorting out that little
pension problem, Leon. Appreciate it.

281
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:49,799
I didn't do anything I wouldn't have
done for any former agent.

282
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:52,245
- All by the book.
- Absolutely.

283
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:53,519
By the book.

284
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,271
That's how we operate now.

285
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:57,565
Wouldn't have it
any other way, Leon.

286
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:05,573
Think he noticed my tie?

287
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,046
What do we got?

288
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,303
We canvassed the area.
No one is talking.

289
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:11,506
- There is a smurf war...
- Turf war.

290
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,915
between two competing gangs,
the PCs and the Verde Psychos.

291
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:15,845
Ballistics.

292
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:18,670
We matched the slug
that killed PFC Salazar to a gun

293
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,516
that was used in an unsolved robbery
two weeks ago. And...

294
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:24,299
Metro's chief suspect is...

295
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,952
Victor Carmado, a.k.a. Popeye.

296
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:33,225
Victor Carmado is
a known member of the PCs.

297
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:37,070
He was hanging out with his posse
at Liberty Heights today.

298
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,984
DiNozzo, Ziva, bring him in.

299
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:57,666
- Howdy, darling!
- Franks!

300
00:15:57,726 --> 00:15:58,990
What are you doing here?

301
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,463
Probie thinks I'm here helping him, but
it was just an excuse to come see you.

302
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:06,592
Abs, tune it down.

303
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:12,389
This is so cool.

304
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,768
Someone writes your service number
on a roof, and then you just show up.

305
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:19,212
It's like sending out the bat signal
and having Batman just show up.

306
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,979
And his mentor, Ra's al Ghul.

307
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,299
Or like Princess Lela sending
a hologram: "Help me, Obi-Wan".

308
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:29,976
And then getting Obi-Wan with
his mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn.

309
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:34,453
It's weird 'cause Liam Neeson
played both the mentors.

310
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,478
You gonna tell me why I'm here?

311
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:39,291
I ran the blood
from the service number.

312
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:42,571
It does not match our dead Marine,
Emilio Salazar.

313
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:43,918
I already know that.

314
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:45,366
Of course you do.

315
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:49,218
Hopefully, it'll be news to you that
the blood did belong to another Marine:

316
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:52,262
Private First Class Tomás Tamayo.

317
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:56,058
Judging by the look on your face,
that is news to you.

318
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:59,602
He comes from the same neighborhood
as PFC Salazar.

319
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:00,982
According to his records,

320
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:04,608
his mother died ten years ago
after emigrating from Colombia.

321
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:07,621
Rose had a son?

322
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:10,739
Yeah. He was about a year old
when I brought her here.

323
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,533
You knew?

324
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,594
I'm guessing you didn't.

325
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:18,783
I need an address, Abs.

326
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:21,123
57 Kensington Street.

327
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:23,683
The home belongs
to a woman named Maggie Scott.

328
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:27,381
Might want to take this slow, probie.
Might not like where it leads you.

329
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,250
Popeye Carmado?

330
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,470
NCIS.

331
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:53,157
Are we all listening
to the same song?

332
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:54,958
Let me guess.

333
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:56,702
Ricky Martin fans.

334
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:58,644
"Livin' La Vida Loca."

335
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:01,964
- You ought to leave, man.
- But we just got here.

336
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:05,544
But this is a very dangerous
neighborhood.

337
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,879
That's why I brought her.

338
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:10,507
<i>La Bonita es una federale.</i>

339
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:13,635
<i>Federales saben buenas.</i>

340
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:15,952
<i>La Bonita</i> will kick your ass.

341
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:17,983
Is that right?

342
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,909
You know, bad things happen
in this place, mamita.

343
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:22,585
But it's so homey,

344
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:23,749
homey.

345
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:26,167
I love what you've done
with the wall here.

346
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:28,295
"Snoopy loves Chiquita?"

347
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:31,445
Which one of you sleeps on a doghouse
and which one's a banana?

348
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:33,989
I'm guessing the love
is between you two. Am I wrong?

349
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:40,462
Think they want to play rock,
paper, scissors?

350
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:44,500
- You got them?
- I've got them.

351
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:52,633
What's the matter? Popeye didn't eat
his spinach this morning?

352
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:53,696
Rico!

353
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:54,734
Chuy!

354
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:57,589
"Rico Suave" is stuck in the '90s,

355
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:59,556
and Chewie's back
with the Millennium Falcon.

356
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,809
Let's go see how <i>La Bonita</i> did.

357
00:19:07,036 --> 00:19:08,253
What took you so long?

358
00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:18,866
What are you doing? Why are you digging
through the NCIS database?

359
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:22,079
This woman called for Tony,
and I didn't get the number.

360
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,165
It was blocked by the carrier,
so I am trying to coordinate a trace...

361
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,835
Well, drop the call.
This is much more important.

362
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:30,546
Okay, what's up?

363
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:33,548
I heard something.

364
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:36,425
Not a complete something,
a partial something.

365
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:40,116
But enough of something
to make me think it means something.

366
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:43,374
So I need to know
if there's any other...

367
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,975
something that you know about?

368
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:47,208
What...

369
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,939
I'm lost.

370
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,280
Okay.
It's something about Gibbs.

371
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:56,876
And Colombia.

372
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:59,666
And a woman named Rose.

373
00:20:00,008 --> 00:20:02,339
And a son she had 18 years ago.

374
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:04,135
That would be 1991...

375
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:06,430
before Gibbs joined NCIS.

376
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:09,134
Come on, McGee.

377
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:11,484
Type something
about the something into something.

378
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,245
Open, he's open.

379
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:16,404
Give me the ball.

380
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:18,844
Shoot it.

381
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:21,972
Nice shooting, lady.

382
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,932
- Get a lot of practice around here.
- You Maggie Scott?

383
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:28,207
Hey, Henry, come in for me, okay?

384
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:32,608
What happened?
You guys Metro?

385
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,193
NCIS.

386
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,109
Who got hit?
Somebody from this block?

387
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,265
I understand this is
the home of Tomás Tamayo.

388
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:41,450
Why?
Is he all right?

389
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,202
He was involved in a murder.

390
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:45,329
Oh, my God.

391
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:46,955
No, he wasn't the victim.

392
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:48,790
Someone a couple of streets over.

393
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:50,584
Emilio Salazar.

394
00:20:52,823 --> 00:20:53,629
Emilio.

395
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:56,793
Yeah, he's a...
he's a friend of Tomás'.

396
00:20:57,295 --> 00:20:59,399
His mother,
has anyone contacted Emilio's mother?

397
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,390
Being done now.

398
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:01,786
Where is Tomás?

399
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:03,890
He's on leave, Cape Hatteras.

400
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,599
- Before Afghanistan.
- Wrong.

401
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,880
He was at a crime scene
last night in D.C.

402
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,726
Hold on.

403
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:10,479
You were his legal guardian?

404
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,889
Legal guardian to a lot of these kids.
Keeps them out of the system.

405
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:17,402
I just watch them till their moms get
home from work. Most don't have fathers.

406
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,203
Two of them lost siblings,
past couple months.

407
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,281
War?

408
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:22,840
Gang war.

409
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:26,119
You're not from around here,
are you?

410
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:28,849
I moved here after college.
Part of the Vista program.

411
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:30,415
I never left.

412
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,334
How'd you become Tomás' guardian?

413
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:35,233
Tomás moved in about...

414
00:21:35,517 --> 00:21:36,671
12 years back.

415
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:39,508
Then when Rose got sick...
his mother has cancer...

416
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,094
she asked me to look after him.

417
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,191
He's a good kid.

418
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:45,679
He's a really good kid.

419
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:49,518
Oh, my God,

420
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:51,452
It's okay. He's here.

421
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,816
It's Tomás.
It's Tomás.

422
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:55,636
Tomás!

423
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:00,604
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

424
00:22:01,183 --> 00:22:02,105
What is this?

425
00:22:02,704 --> 00:22:04,116
I was so worried about you.

426
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:06,276
What's going on?

427
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:19,143
You want to tell us
where you been for the past 48 hours?

428
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:20,791
Cape Hatteras with friends.

429
00:22:21,017 --> 00:22:21,940
We checked.

430
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:25,595
Your cell calls were all made
from a two-block area of D.C.

431
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:28,098
Why were you being held here?

432
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:29,406
I wasn't.

433
00:22:31,293 --> 00:22:33,326
My military service number.

434
00:22:35,393 --> 00:22:37,299
Your blood on the roof.

435
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:44,406
You got my attention, Tomás.
I'm here. What do you want?

436
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:46,658
It wasn't me.

437
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:49,226
I cut myself training.

438
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:52,744
Gibbs and the kid.

439
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,730
<i>It was your damn blood on the roof.</i>

440
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,618
- What's the connection?
- <i>We tested it.</i>

441
00:22:56,806 --> 00:22:58,086
And why the kid gloves?

442
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,467
<i>- Hey, let me out!</i>
- Our friend from the hood.

443
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:02,924
Think he's chilled long enough?

444
00:23:03,596 --> 00:23:05,469
Time to unpop his cork.

445
00:23:08,468 --> 00:23:10,917
- Let me out of here!
- Cool it, Coolio!

446
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:12,624
No gang banging on the walls.

447
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:14,042
Sit down.

448
00:23:14,248 --> 00:23:15,801
- I ain't sitting down.
- <i>Sientate</i>!

449
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:18,023
Or do you want <i>La Bonita</i>
to sit your ass down?

450
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:20,880
I thought you all forgot about me,
that's all.

451
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,278
You in a hurry to get somewhere,
Popeye?

452
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:27,074
'Cause you sure ain't going home to
Olive Oyl and Sweet Pea any time soon.

453
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:29,201
- You're going to prison.
- Says who?

454
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:33,250
Says the nine-millimeter slug
we pulled out of PFC Emilio Salazar.

455
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:36,356
Matches the slug from another shooting
you were involved in.

456
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:39,168
If witnesses put me there,
I'd have been locked up already.

457
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:42,589
We have a dead Marine,
former gang member of yours.

458
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:44,883
This is the murder weapon.

459
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:46,676
Found dumped in a storm drain.

460
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:48,224
Recognize it?

461
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:51,854
That's it?

462
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,052
That's all you got?

463
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:55,729
It's all we need.

464
00:23:58,043 --> 00:23:59,454
It's all circumstantial.

465
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:03,192
I think you got nothing.

466
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:07,404
I think
what you need is a confession.

467
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:11,489
You are looking at ten years

468
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,688
for accessory
to a murder of a U.S. Marine.

469
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:16,607
More if we tag you for murder one.

470
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:19,936
Your sweat was on that roof.

471
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:23,255
Your pee was on that roof.

472
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:26,234
Your blood was on that roof.

473
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:28,552
You gonna tell us
what happened on that roof?!

474
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:31,429
If you don't tell us
who else was there,

475
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:33,996
who put that bullet in PFC Salazar,

476
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:36,999
we're gonna have
to assume it was you.

477
00:24:40,232 --> 00:24:41,467
I didn't kill Emilio.

478
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:42,633
Who did?

479
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:44,987
Me. I killed the little bitch.

480
00:24:45,803 --> 00:24:47,571
You killed PFC Salazar?

481
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,948
Yeah, I did it.

482
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:52,230
You got me.

483
00:24:52,644 --> 00:24:54,015
The fool deserved to die.

484
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:56,580
How'd it go down, Victor?

485
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:58,584
I shot him.
That's how it went down.

486
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:00,594
Put the gun to his head...

487
00:25:01,395 --> 00:25:03,378
- Blew his brains out.
- You shot him in the head?

488
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,131
Lights out, baby.

489
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:07,507
JFK style.

490
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:09,529
Back and to the left,
know what I'm saying?

491
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,005
One shot...

492
00:25:11,898 --> 00:25:13,239
to the chest.

493
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,514
That's what killed
your friend Emilio.

494
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:17,886
But he didn't die right away.
It took time.

495
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,717
Maybe 20 minutes.

496
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:26,850
Bullet nicked his heart.

497
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:29,570
Blood poured into his lungs.

498
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:31,242
Remember, Tomás?

499
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:32,114
No.

500
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:34,326
He would have had trouble breathing.

501
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:36,788
The pain must have been
excruciating.

502
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:38,792
But you know all this,
don't you, Marine?!

503
00:25:38,852 --> 00:25:40,238
I wasn't there.

504
00:25:44,985 --> 00:25:46,303
Popeye didn't pop the guy.

505
00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:48,674
No way a kid like that
took down two Marines.

506
00:25:48,734 --> 00:25:51,795
Probably taking credit for a street kill
to elevate his stature.

507
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:54,113
- Get anything on PFC Tamayo?
- He's scared.

508
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:56,053
- He's hiding something.
- They both are.

509
00:25:56,242 --> 00:25:57,933
Something more going on than that.

510
00:25:58,112 --> 00:25:59,303
You're right, probie.

511
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:02,679
Gang bangers don't kidnap their enemies.
They shoot them in the street.

512
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:04,940
Somebody's pulling strings,
calling shots.

513
00:26:05,158 --> 00:26:06,232
I think I know who.

514
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,736
I've been crosschecking the Metro Gang
Task Force's list of known

515
00:26:09,816 --> 00:26:12,239
PC members against cell numbers
registered in their names.

516
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:14,052
One common phone number
keeps popping up.

517
00:26:14,112 --> 00:26:16,587
It's a number from outside
the neighborhood that called almost

518
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:18,578
every member of the PC gang.

519
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:21,081
That's the C.O.
from the shooting range.

520
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,577
Staff Sergeant Vicente Medina.

521
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:26,561
That's not all. I looked
into the Staff Sergeant's history.

522
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:29,339
It seems he shares a bit more
than phone records in common.

523
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:32,230
He wasn't just recruiting
from the PCs.

524
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:35,553
- He was a member.
- Get him in here.

525
00:26:38,928 --> 00:26:41,100
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- <i>Need you in my office.</i>

526
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,432
I'll be right there.

527
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:46,648
- Marine file.
- It's yours.

528
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:50,569
I haven't read it yet,
and I won't if you'd prefer I didn't.

529
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:54,650
I thought it might shed some light
on what the hell happened

530
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,092
in Colombia 18 years ago...

531
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,285
unless you'd prefer to.

532
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:01,204
I got nothing to hide, Leon.

533
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:03,307
Everybody's got something to hide.

534
00:27:06,522 --> 00:27:07,794
Franks is a part of this?

535
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,478
A little part.

536
00:27:15,978 --> 00:27:17,929
Some good stuff
in the last five pages.

537
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:32,584
How many men have you killed?

538
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:35,655
Seven confirmed.

539
00:27:36,226 --> 00:27:37,032
Where?

540
00:27:38,118 --> 00:27:40,035
Three in Anbar, two in Fallouja,

541
00:27:40,718 --> 00:27:43,023
one in Baghdad, one in Tora Bora.

542
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,707
How about Washington D.C.?

543
00:27:47,963 --> 00:27:48,668
None.

544
00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:51,880
You knew Emilio Salazar?

545
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,090
His Platoon Sergeant, sir.

546
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,842
He's a gang member
just like you are.

547
00:27:57,507 --> 00:28:00,221
- That was a long time ago.
- That was last night!

548
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:01,890
Sir, I did not kill that Marine!

549
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,516
What were you doing last night?

550
00:28:04,495 --> 00:28:05,793
I was at home watching TV.

551
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:09,062
Anybody watching you watching TV?

552
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:11,858
No.

553
00:28:12,397 --> 00:28:16,029
Your place is 20 minutes
from our crime scene.

554
00:28:17,504 --> 00:28:18,759
Phone records.

555
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,411
You made contact with half the PC posse
over the past six months.

556
00:28:27,076 --> 00:28:28,121
Rap sheet,

557
00:28:28,826 --> 00:28:29,760
yours.

558
00:28:29,998 --> 00:28:32,128
Shot caller for the PCs
for three years.

559
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:36,883
Once a Marine, always a Marine.

560
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:40,720
Or once a PC, always a PC!

561
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:43,431
I lived the life.
It's not a secret.

562
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:45,350
I liked it

563
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:47,894
till I saw what was happening
to my friends:

564
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:50,355
in dead or jail by 17.

565
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:52,875
So I joined the Marine Corps.

566
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:55,317
Made me a better person.
Came back to the hood and

567
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:57,955
tried to convince others
to make something of themselves.

568
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:06,184
Ran a system-wide facial
recognition search.

569
00:29:06,484 --> 00:29:08,459
I thought you'd want
to see this right away.

570
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:17,055
Okay, let's try this again.
Where were you last night?

571
00:29:18,379 --> 00:29:19,968
I told you I was at home.

572
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:22,679
Baltimore!

573
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:24,340
That was taken last night!

574
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:26,182
You couldn't have killed him.

575
00:29:26,412 --> 00:29:27,558
Why are you lying?

576
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:33,481
I went to visit my son.

577
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:38,859
When I was 15, I made some mistakes.
I got a girl pregnant.

578
00:29:39,252 --> 00:29:40,392
And my wife...

579
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:45,640
she doesn't know I have a kid.

580
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,186
I know what we got, nothing.

581
00:29:51,285 --> 00:29:53,355
Guess we all make mistakes,
huh, probie?

582
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,762
Got two Marines chained to a roof.
Don't know why.

583
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:06,681
Got somebody behind it pulling strings.
Don't know who.

584
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,516
Can we wind the clock
back to the part

585
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:10,568
where we find out
what he was doing in Colombia?

586
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:12,186
Or how it is connected to the gang?

587
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:15,440
Got a punk who didn't kill anybody
who says he did,

588
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,481
and a kid who wrote probie's service
number in blood saying he didn't.

589
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,656
You done?

590
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:23,655
Done watching you shave
with a butter knife.

591
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,151
Let me talk to that kid.

592
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,493
I'll get him to tell us
what the hell's going on here.

593
00:30:27,574 --> 00:30:29,245
I can't do that, Mike.
I let him go.

594
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:31,738
- You what?
- If you want to find something,

595
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:33,917
you follow it.
I learned that one from you.

596
00:30:37,917 --> 00:30:39,031
You two...

597
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:42,179
MTAC with McGee.

598
00:30:42,463 --> 00:30:43,499
Got it, boss.

599
00:30:57,298 --> 00:30:59,150
Think I don't know
what you're doing?

600
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:01,194
Trying to get that boy off?

601
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:02,493
Yeah,

602
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:04,172
gonna lead us to the truth.

603
00:31:04,328 --> 00:31:05,328
The truth.

604
00:31:05,603 --> 00:31:08,989
Yeah, which you should have told me
17 years ago.

605
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,583
When I got Rose out of Colombia,

606
00:31:15,664 --> 00:31:17,544
you were happily married again.

607
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:19,970
- Or so I thought.
- What's the truth?!

608
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,238
The truth is,
she didn't want you to know!

609
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:29,488
She knew you were still putting
the pieces back together

610
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:31,297
after Shannon and Kelly.

611
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:34,199
Didn't want to complicate your life.

612
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:38,565
Guess she didn't get
her wish after all.

613
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:43,396
Maybe Gibbs was on a covert mission
to suppress the Fujimori coup.

614
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,103
That was Peru, not Colombia.

615
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,784
Okay, boss, we're still following
the GPS signal from

616
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:51,494
PFC Tamayo's cell phone.

617
00:31:51,707 --> 00:31:54,038
<i>He drove to Quantico.</i>
He's been there about 20 minutes.

618
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,166
Quantico's that way, probie.

619
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:05,384
We're not going to Quantico.
That's his first stop.

620
00:32:05,444 --> 00:32:06,744
We're going to his last.

621
00:32:07,298 --> 00:32:09,355
Like the lady said, Mike.
"It's a war".

622
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:12,936
So he's down in Colombia in Bogota.

623
00:32:12,996 --> 00:32:14,875
He saves President Clinton's life,

624
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:17,582
but nobody can talk about it
because it's super secret.

625
00:32:17,642 --> 00:32:19,939
Clinton did not serve until '93.

626
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:20,950
Stop obsessing!

627
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,026
I'm not obsessing!
I'm a little preoccupied.

628
00:32:23,338 --> 00:32:26,243
I'm a tad fascinated
by the whole subject, but I am not...

629
00:32:26,621 --> 00:32:27,720
obsessing.

630
00:32:29,028 --> 00:32:31,863
What was he doing
in Colombia 17 years ago?

631
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:34,652
18 years ago...
and it's classified, DiNozzo.

632
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,583
Is that classified, too,
or can you share with your director?

633
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:43,046
We're tracking
a suspect for Gibbs, Director.

634
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:44,393
Franks is with him?

635
00:32:47,692 --> 00:32:48,842
That's what I thought.

636
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:51,054
PFC Tamayo's just left Quantico.

637
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:54,184
He's now headed towards Liberty Heights.
So, what do you want us to do?

638
00:32:54,244 --> 00:32:56,059
Whatever you were doing
before I walked in.

639
00:32:57,152 --> 00:32:59,061
What's Tamayo's duty
assignment at Quantico?

640
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:01,633
- Guard duty at the base armory.
- And the dead Marine?

641
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:04,609
PFC Salazar was also
a guard at the armory.

642
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,465
Means they both had access
to the armory codes.

643
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:09,384
Stepping back.
Excuse me.

644
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:11,743
- Get base security on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

645
00:33:16,076 --> 00:33:18,394
If this kid starts shooting,
you're gonna shoot back, right?

646
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:26,964
This is a really bad time, Leon.

647
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:30,093
<i>I just got off the phone
with the Armory O.I.C. at Quantico.</i>

648
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:32,529
Four crates of M-4 assault
rifles are missing.

649
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:34,430
That's your PFC Tamayo.

650
00:33:35,088 --> 00:33:36,306
Gangs, guns.

651
00:33:36,554 --> 00:33:37,600
It adds up.

652
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:39,935
We're still monitoring his GPS.

653
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:42,255
<i>- He's headed back toward the projects.</i>
- The projects!

654
00:33:42,602 --> 00:33:44,253
Yeah, we got him, we got him.

655
00:33:52,695 --> 00:33:53,874
I did what you wanted.

656
00:33:55,377 --> 00:33:56,577
No, you listen to me!

657
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,912
You want 'em, you come get 'em.
Second floor, I'm waiting.

658
00:34:00,578 --> 00:34:02,792
This is about to get
real interesting, probie.

659
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:10,842
Building across the street.

660
00:34:11,037 --> 00:34:13,593
<i>Traffic camera, 3837 Ashton.</i>

661
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:14,879
Got it.

662
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,404
Record it.

663
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,349
Recording.

664
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:37,717
You alone, homes?

665
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,885
Zoom in on those guys.

666
00:34:40,557 --> 00:34:41,325
In.

667
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:43,156
Those two.

668
00:34:43,842 --> 00:34:46,034
- Aren't those the two guys?
- Chuy and Rico.

669
00:34:46,094 --> 00:34:47,472
I should have hit them harder.

670
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:50,131
- You got 'em?
- Freeze! Freeze!

671
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:51,590
Put your hands in the air!

672
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:52,998
Put your hands in the air!

673
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:56,554
You thought you were gonna use
Marine guns to kill my friends?

674
00:34:56,635 --> 00:34:57,847
Something's going down.

675
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,373
Somebody's behind him.
McGee, zoom out, zoom out.

676
00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:05,021
No! This ends here!

677
00:35:10,398 --> 00:35:11,444
What the hell?

678
00:35:22,638 --> 00:35:24,104
Don't move, Sergeant.

679
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,043
Call for an ambulance and backup.

680
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,134
Everywhere you go, kid,

681
00:35:35,214 --> 00:35:36,714
somebody gets shot.

682
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:40,568
3832 Ashton shots fired.
Possible multiple casualties...

683
00:35:40,887 --> 00:35:42,389
Keep pressure on it.

684
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:49,065
Hey, Leon.

685
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,109
- Let me talk to him.
- <i>He's busy.</i>

686
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:54,237
- <i>Can I take a message?</i>
- You just shot somebody, Franks.

687
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,446
<i>Yeah.
All by the book, Leon.</i>

688
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:58,741
<i>Retired-agent, involved shooting.</i>

689
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:01,701
<i>That's still a form KJ-65, right?</i>

690
00:36:01,782 --> 00:36:03,078
<i>Nice talking to you, Leon.</i>

691
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,465
It was me.

692
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,628
I ordered him to take
those weapons off the base

693
00:36:11,726 --> 00:36:13,721
- and bring 'em here like they wanted.
- Why?

694
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,217
- Because I was...
- No, not you. You.

695
00:36:18,748 --> 00:36:20,330
They held me on the roof.

696
00:36:21,562 --> 00:36:24,305
Said they'd hurt everyone I love
unless I got them the assault weapons.

697
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:27,820
I didn't believe them.
They used to be my friends.

698
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:30,705
Then they threatened Emilio.
Shot him in front of me.

699
00:36:32,912 --> 00:36:34,882
I thought they were
gonna kill me, too.

700
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:36,765
That why you wrote
my service number?

701
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:42,315
When I found out you were NCIS,
I wanted to tell you, but...

702
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,861
I ordered him not to.

703
00:36:46,344 --> 00:36:47,165
Why?

704
00:36:47,654 --> 00:36:49,920
Using Marine guns to kill kids
in my hood,

705
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:53,423
kids I was trying to save,
it made me sick.

706
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:56,235
I wanted to handle it myself.

707
00:36:58,954 --> 00:37:00,324
We take care of our own.

708
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:11,706
Those guys are just the hired help.

709
00:37:18,357 --> 00:37:19,488
Can I talk to him?

710
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:22,481
- No, he's going to prison.
- Please, I...

711
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:25,860
He stole weapons from a Marine base
to arm a street gang.

712
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,144
People died.

713
00:37:28,825 --> 00:37:30,314
He confessed to everything.

714
00:37:31,308 --> 00:37:32,736
All of it, his idea.

715
00:37:34,564 --> 00:37:35,799
And he's going away.

716
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:41,839
Unless you've got something to say.

717
00:37:45,504 --> 00:37:46,504
Wait.

718
00:37:46,884 --> 00:37:49,064
He didn't do anything.
He's lying.

719
00:37:51,974 --> 00:37:52,729
Hold up.

720
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:57,475
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

721
00:37:57,854 --> 00:38:01,558
They were just supposed to scare them so
that Tomás or Emilio would get the guns.

722
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:04,920
<i>For the PCs,
Emilio wasn't supposed to get shot.</i>

723
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,127
That was an accident, I swear.

724
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,557
Who needed weapons, Maggie?

725
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,790
Our kids.

726
00:38:12,602 --> 00:38:14,377
In the neighborhood, on our block.

727
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:17,290
They were getting killed every day.

728
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:19,984
Slaughtered by drug dealers
and bigger gangs.

729
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:22,515
They are dying every day!

730
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:25,524
I had to protect them.

731
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,141
By what,
arming them with assault rifles?

732
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:31,272
I grew up in the Cold War.
My dad talked about deterrence...

733
00:38:31,332 --> 00:38:35,036
if you build up an arsenal that rivals
your enemy's, they won't attack you.

734
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:39,099
You understand?

735
00:38:58,623 --> 00:39:00,949
Case closed... my case,
and you being on it.

736
00:39:03,956 --> 00:39:04,802
"Melinda."

737
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:07,049
"555-0199."

738
00:39:09,352 --> 00:39:11,487
Hold the phone, Malone,
I know that number.

739
00:39:11,603 --> 00:39:13,530
You should...
it's your dentist's office.

740
00:39:13,615 --> 00:39:15,293
They rescheduled your appointment.

741
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:18,695
That Melinda.
The one with the man hands.

742
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:22,111
Well, I hope you learned a lesson,
probie.

743
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:24,144
Yeah... never to pick up
your phone again.

744
00:39:25,082 --> 00:39:26,220
Wait a second.

745
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:29,452
It was right in front of me
the whole time.

746
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:32,951
Franks! I've got a question for you.

747
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:34,789
Got a plane to catch.

748
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,040
18 years ago, Colombia.

749
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:40,313
Gibbs was doing drug
interdiction down there.

750
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,667
Tomás is 18, from Colombia.

751
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:44,962
Knows Gibbs's Marine service number.

752
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:47,094
Question?

753
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,083
Is Gibbs Tomás' father?

754
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:53,101
Tell probie...
thanks for the lend.

755
00:40:00,676 --> 00:40:02,456
No. Sit down.
As you were.

756
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,259
Your orders.
Shipping out to Afghanistan.

757
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:10,595
I'm not going to jail?

758
00:40:13,962 --> 00:40:15,567
You helped the investigation.

759
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:25,173
My mother used to tell me
this story about a Marine.

760
00:40:28,411 --> 00:40:30,495
He came to help out our village.

761
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:35,122
But the drug cartel
came after him...

762
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,027
shot him.
He almost died.

763
00:40:45,873 --> 00:40:46,876
She hid him,

764
00:40:47,499 --> 00:40:48,560
helped him heal.

765
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:02,052
That was you.

766
00:41:03,554 --> 00:41:05,286
And when you finally got well...

767
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:08,684
you told her that
if she ever needed any help,

768
00:41:08,973 --> 00:41:11,423
she could give that number
to any Marine and you would find her.

769
00:41:14,418 --> 00:41:16,039
She made me memorize that number.

770
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:20,779
You're the reason I became a Marine.

771
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:36,553
When your mother saved my life,
she was already pregnant with you.

772
00:41:43,787 --> 00:41:45,755
Most people,
they don't get a second chance.

773
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:53,416
Good luck.

774
00:41:56,356 --> 00:41:57,356
Semper Fi.

775
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:01,561
Hurra!

776
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:09,162
Read about the mission
to eliminate Cesar Castillo

777
00:42:09,222 --> 00:42:11,218
from the Cali Cartel in Colombia.

778
00:42:11,908 --> 00:42:14,119
- Good read?
- It was impressive.

779
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:19,437
Took out your target with one shot
to the heart from 1,200 yards.

780
00:42:19,685 --> 00:42:21,619
This Castillo was a piece of work.

781
00:42:22,018 --> 00:42:25,201
Drug dealer, torturer, rapist.

782
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,813
I did my job.

783
00:42:28,285 --> 00:42:30,627
And the mission would've gone off
without a hitch

784
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:32,123
if you hadn't been wounded.

785
00:42:33,478 --> 00:42:36,854
Well, I guess
you're all caught up now, Leon.

786
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:38,599
Must've been poignant...

787
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:41,143
helping out the son of the woman
that saved your life.

788
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,072
Did you tell the boy that the man
you killed was his father?

789
00:42:49,252 --> 00:42:52,432
