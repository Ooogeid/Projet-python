2
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:04,277
Los Angeles, OSP.
They have the lead.

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,508
NCIS's Office of Special Projects.

4
00:00:06,596 --> 00:00:09,155
They specialize
in undercover and surveillance.

5
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:10,803
Macy still agent in charge there?

6
00:00:10,884 --> 00:00:12,764
- How are you, Callen?
- Did you see Mace?

7
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:14,557
- Yeah, I saw her.
- Let me do my job.

8
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:16,518
Like you did the first time we met?

9
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,144
Kickoff's in 30.

10
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:20,095
Guy on the right, Michael Rivkin.

11
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,651
When he called the other day,
I thought he must have been here.

12
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:25,234
No. Sadly, Michael is not here.

13
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,986
Go tight on Liam.
What do you see?

14
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:28,154
He's carrying...

15
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,450
Liam Coyle, former IRA arms dealer.

16
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,283
Motel.

17
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:36,036
Four blank passports.

18
00:00:36,117 --> 00:00:38,028
Four suitcases filled with weapons.

19
00:00:38,094 --> 00:00:41,092
That means whoever Liam's supplying is
probably coming back to collect this.

20
00:00:41,152 --> 00:00:42,925
Looks like you're going
undercover as Liam.

21
00:00:42,985 --> 00:00:45,630
- Been expecting you.
- It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

22
00:00:48,087 --> 00:00:49,473
<i>You have everything I want?</i>

23
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:50,583
<i>Times four.</i>

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
<i>Passports?</i>

25
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:53,263
<i>Everything.</i>

26
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:54,716
<i>And it's all here?</i>

27
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:56,599
<i>It's all here.</i>

28
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,562
First the face, next the name.

29
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:09,446
You know, I met a man in Damascus
who said you were dead.

30
00:01:10,482 --> 00:01:13,324
Well, let me know when he passes.
I'll come to his funeral.

31
00:01:13,663 --> 00:01:14,613
Too late.

32
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:18,445
- Who are you?
- Abort, abort.

33
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:20,540
Target center of the room,
weapon drawn.

34
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:22,250
Federal agents! Don't move!

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,168
Put down your weapon.

36
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:25,462
Put it down!

37
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:28,673
Come on, <i>Mace,
he wasn't gonna shoot me!</i>

38
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:31,289
<i>Tell her you weren't gonna shoot me?</i>

39
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:32,761
<i>I wasn't going to shoot him.</i>

40
00:01:33,235 --> 00:01:36,222
No tension in the upper body,
and the voice is all wrong.

41
00:01:36,302 --> 00:01:37,893
Probably wasn't gonna shoot him.

42
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:40,852
- Be embarrassing if he had.
- There's no room for probably, Nate.

43
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,659
Do we have a name?

44
00:01:43,598 --> 00:01:45,982
Well, we just started.
It's gonna take at least a...

45
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,819
- We got a match here.
- Put it on the screen.

46
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,947
Millions of possibilities,
we get a hit in six seconds?

47
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,618
Michael Rivkin.

48
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:58,619
His name's Michael Rivkin.

49
00:01:59,224 --> 00:01:59,995
FBI?

50
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,792
CIA?

51
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,627
NCIS.

52
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,669
He's way too confident.

53
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:09,451
Think we're about to go pear-shaped.

54
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:11,508
Who are you?

55
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:12,953
Mossad.

56
00:02:13,476 --> 00:02:14,593
<i>You can prove that?</i>

57
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,305
<i>No, but I know someone who can.</i>

58
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,974
<i>Her name is Ziva David.</i>

63
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:04,394
Morning.

64
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,008
- Something up?
- Gibbs.

65
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:09,732
- He's back?
- MTAC.

66
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:11,901
Nice, three one-word answers.
Wanna go for a fourth?

67
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:12,672
No!

68
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:14,946
Now I'm gonna ask you a question
that's gonna demand

69
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,398
more than a one-word answer.

70
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,157
 - Are you ready for that?
- No.

71
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:22,042
All right, here comes the question.
Ready?

72
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:24,998
No beverage is allowed in MTAC.

73
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,209
Hey. Soy vanilla latte, no sugar added.
Didn't blow back.

74
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:29,254
It's all yours.

75
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:32,046
God, question was right on the tip of
my tongue, and now I can't remember it.

76
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:34,119
How could I forget the question?

77
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:39,253
Questions are of course,
well, they're relative.

78
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:41,680
- And I don't mean that in a sense of...
- OSP's on-line.

79
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,590
<i>McGee, put it up.</i>

80
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:51,733
<i>You recognize him?</i>

81
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,649
Yes, I know him.
His name is Michael Rivkin.

82
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:00,700
<i>He says he's Mossad.</i>

83
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,534
Yes, he's with the Mossad.

84
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:05,752
<i>Anything else you can tell us about him,
Officer David?</i>

85
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:06,512
No.

86
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:08,750
I have not worked
with him in some time.

87
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,443
<i>We will talk more about this later.</i>

88
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:12,874
Of course.

89
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,057
You did not think
I would identify him.

90
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:20,656
That was not a question.

91
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,129
Anything you want to tell me?

92
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:22,889
No.

93
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:24,600
One-word answer.

94
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:25,683
I win.

95
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:30,271
His cover is an Israeli banker.

96
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:33,107
 Flew in three days ago.
That's all we got, still looking.

97
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,189
What the hell is he doing here?

98
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:36,568
Same thing we are.

99
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,363
Tracking down a terrorist cell.

100
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,745
We're hunting the same cell.

101
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:48,915
Your search started here,

102
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:50,055
mine in Yemen.

103
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:53,461
Okay, well, if I'm Liam Coyle,
arms supplier, who does that make you?

104
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,938
Nick Quaderi, jihadist.

105
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:59,006
The real Liam's in the morgue.
Where exactly is the real Nick Quaderi?

106
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,101
In bed.

107
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,428
221 Pacific Avenue,

108
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:04,555
Apartment 27, Venice Beach.

109
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,516
No need to be quiet.
You won't wake him.

110
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:10,812
You should've called us. Would've
spared you a long ride from Yemen.

111
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:12,855
Need to be sure.

112
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:15,006
What did Quaderi tell you?

113
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,301
Weapons pickup here,
a man named Liam.

114
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:19,079
- Target?
- No.

115
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:20,738
Rest of the cell?

116
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:22,407
Fell asleep before he told me.

117
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,494
I can tell you
that one of the others is named Haziq.

118
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:27,528
<i>Address.</i>

119
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:30,957
<i>That's all I have.</i>

120
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:32,917
Give him your cell, Sam.

121
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,962
Be polite.

122
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,923
Good morning.

123
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:41,509
As I'm sure you're aware,
foreign intelligence agencies

124
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,012
are not authorized to act
within U.S. territorial borders.

125
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:47,799
I would hate for your actions
to cause an incident

126
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:49,851
by staying here any longer,
Mr. Rivkin.

127
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:51,561
<i>We each have a job to do.</i>

128
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,257
Yours is done.

129
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:54,217
Go home.

130
00:05:57,242 --> 00:05:58,692
GPS tracker on his rental.

131
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,695
Sam, let him go.

132
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:12,623
Yeah.

133
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,379
Four passports, four suitcases.

134
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:20,882
Yeah, Rivkin's already put
one of them to sleep.

135
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,136
One down, three to go.

136
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:26,382
Eric, give me outside surveillance.

137
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:28,131
On screen.

138
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:32,060
Agent Renko, you got him?

139
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:36,745
I got him, Mace.

140
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:42,028
Callen, Sam, Venice Beach,
Quaderi's apartment.

141
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,049
<i>Kensi,</i>

142
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:44,391
<i>shut it down.</i>

143
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:48,922
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Mumbai.

144
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:50,603
They attack soft targets.

145
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:53,319
Hotels, a railway station.

146
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:57,537
We need a breathing suspect,
not a dead one.

147
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,385
That's not Rivkin's plan.

148
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:02,247
We have to stay ahead of him

149
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:05,633
until I get approval to lock him up
or send him home.

150
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:11,641
Officer David was sent back
to Israel

151
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:14,140
- last year.
- Are you asking me: do I trust her?

152
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,381
Because my answer is:
yes, with my life.

153
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:20,999
You don't think
I'm very good at this, do you?

154
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:25,488
The director must
or you wouldn't be doing this job.

155
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:30,162
You shouldn't judge me
on past performance.

156
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,487
It was 18 years ago.

157
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:36,537
What'd you find?

158
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:00,119
Okay, so...

159
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:02,266
Mossad gets a lead in Yemen

160
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:05,103
about a terrorist cell operating out
of Los Angeles, right?

161
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:07,334
Sends Rivkin to eliminate them.

162
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:10,616
Rivkin finds one of the terrorists,
Nick Quaderi, kills him,

163
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:12,159
but not before Quaderi mentions

164
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:14,348
that he's meeting
with an arms dealer named Liam.

165
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:17,707
And the only problem is,
we're hunting the same terrorist cell.

166
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:19,968
Terrorist cells are like families.

167
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:23,207
I mean, close-knit,
always checking on each other.

168
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,318
Now, if they lost contact
with one of their own,

169
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:28,634
it may trigger them
to step up the attack.

170
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:31,429
Next move is to find
the cell member Rivkin mentioned.

171
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:32,654
Haziq.

172
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:34,232
Before he panics.

173
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:38,519
You think that Rivkin knows
the identities of the rest of the cell?

174
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:41,855
It was right there
in his smug smile, McGee.

175
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,089
He knows.

176
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:56,564
You okay, Mace?

177
00:08:57,205 --> 00:08:59,499
I already told you
not to go there, Nate.

178
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:02,029
Well...

179
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,212
you know me too well.

180
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:06,369
No one knows you, Nate.

181
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:10,733
You, on the other hand, being
the psychologist you are, know everyone.

182
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:13,079
Not Gibbs.

183
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,558
So you go back 18 years, huh?

184
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:21,011
I wasn't listening.

185
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:26,288
Odd word, occasional phrase.

186
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,990
Gibbs was a gunnery sergeant.

187
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:37,152
I was a green,
young lieutenant in the Military Police

188
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:39,121
determined to prove myself.

189
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:40,873
You worked a case together?

190
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,502
You could say that.

191
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,546
It was a JAGMAN investigation,

192
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,443
a murder.

193
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,855
I was the lead investigator.

194
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:52,953
And... Gibbs?

195
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:57,377
Gibbs was the suspect.

196
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,692
Nick Quaderi.

197
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:10,277
- Guy's a ghost.
- Definitely is now.

198
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,782
We got his name and his address.
Paid his rent in cash, utilities paid

199
00:10:15,863 --> 00:10:19,327
by his landlord, so no photo
I.D. there, and no credit cards.

200
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:21,949
You have any idea how many times
your average law-abiding citizen

201
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:23,631
is recorded every week, McGee?

202
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:26,651
Yeah, probably north of 3,000 times.

203
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:29,672
Way north.
Like northern Alaska north.

204
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,175
Every phone call, credit card
transaction, Internet search,

205
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:35,315
all swallowed up
and stored on hard drives

206
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,404
so people can troll them
for personal information.

207
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:39,223
You mean,
like we're doing right now.

208
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:41,434
Yeah, that's okay 'cause
we work for the government.

209
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,673
We've got a national
security letter to prove it.

210
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,683
This guy really did not want
to be found.

211
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:47,231
Well, Rivkin found him, McGee.

212
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:51,067
- Are you still tracking Rivkin?
- Yeah, boss, we got him right there.

213
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:54,207
Marina Del Rey.
We're pulling up the pictometry now.

214
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:56,732
His car's parked at a hotel.

215
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:58,200
Special Agent Renko?

216
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,079
He's out of his car
and he's got a visual.

217
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,873
- Let him know I'm coming.
- I'm on it.

218
00:11:07,524 --> 00:11:08,876
You got something else?

219
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,181
No, that about covers it.

220
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,077
I lived in a place like this
when I was a kid.

221
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,828
I probably lived down the hall.

222
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:46,582
This is it.
Apartment 27.

223
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:16,073
Nick Quaderi,
if you're inclined to believe Rivkin.

224
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:21,784
What is it between Mace and Gibbs?

225
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:23,939
They've never told me.

226
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,829
Think they'll work it out?

227
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:27,447
Not without some help.

228
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:30,626
One-inch tear.
Looks like a stab wound.

229
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:33,129
Clean and quick under the sternum,
up into the heart.

230
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,466
There's a secret department
in the Mossad

231
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:40,947
called the <i>Kidon</i>. I had dealings
with them when I was a Seal.

232
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:43,139
Highly trained, fearless.

233
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:45,641
They were formed
after the war to track down Nazis.

234
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:48,436
Now they come after all enemies
who would harm Israel.

235
00:12:50,155 --> 00:12:51,814
I think Rivkin could be one of them.

236
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,885
<i>Kidon</i>?

237
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:56,564
Hebrew for "bayonet".

238
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:07,786
Morning, Mike.

239
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,416
Help yourself.

240
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,070
Where is he?

241
00:13:15,652 --> 00:13:18,360
Hotel gazebo,
having coffee at the middle table.

242
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:20,720
Went inside, came back out
a couple minutes later.

243
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,165
He's been there ever since.

244
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,765
- He's waiting for somebody.
- That's my guess.

245
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:27,683
Whose boat is this?

246
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:29,844
I have no idea.

247
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:35,441
Sand with the grain
of the wood, Renko.

248
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,653
You done this before?

249
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:40,734
Yeah.

250
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:50,073
Download complete.
Rest in peace.

251
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:59,612
If that's what you want, sure.

252
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:02,209
Next week, then.

253
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:05,086
Yeah, ciao.

254
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:07,299
Hi.

255
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:08,808
Who are you?

256
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,143
My name's Liam.
I'm a friend of Nick's.

257
00:14:11,348 --> 00:14:12,895
Sort of. And you are?

258
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:14,690
Shakira, his girlfriend...

259
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:15,689
sort of.

260
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,821
- Nick, I'm here!
- But Nick's not.

261
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,072
Then how did you get in?

262
00:14:27,364 --> 00:14:29,745
He's supposed to meet me here,
but he's late.

263
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,318
I was just gonna leave him a note.

264
00:14:34,476 --> 00:14:35,176
Liam.

265
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:37,211
- You got a plan?
<i>- Hey, Nick.</i>

266
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:38,671
Clever.

267
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,923
I'm in your apartment waiting.
Where the hell are you?

268
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,467
- I'm in the next room.
<i>- Calm down, take it easy, all right?</i>

269
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,916
Hey, Shakira just walked in.
Do you want to talk with her?

270
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:47,263
Not particularly.

271
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:49,890
Okay, no problem.

272
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:52,851
- What do you have in mind?
- Haziq's place?

273
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:56,856
Sure, if that's what you want,
we'll come right over.

274
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:00,359
He didn't want to talk on the phone.

275
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,640
He wants us to come
to his friend's place...

276
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:04,238
Haziq?

277
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:06,198
- Do you know him?
- You don't?

278
00:15:06,753 --> 00:15:07,477
No.

279
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:09,535
Lucky you.

280
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,903
- I'll call a cab.
- My car's out front.

281
00:15:11,963 --> 00:15:12,663
Great.

282
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:14,728
Is the bathroom through here?

283
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:26,667
Rivkin gives us Haziq's name.

284
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:28,596
She leads us to him.
Stay close.

285
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,388
How you gonna play this?

286
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,396
I gotta believe Haziq still wants
what Liam's got.

287
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:34,974
And if he doesn't?

288
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,438
You come rescue me.

289
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:42,430
You think she's involved?

290
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:45,981
They're sleeping together.

291
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,865
She's involved
whether she knows it or not.

292
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:49,325
Yeah.

293
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:58,543
- What kind of car do you drive?
- A convertible.

294
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,364
Convertible?
Red?

295
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:02,804
- Yellow.
- I like yellow.

296
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:07,544
- Mace?
<i>- What's happening, Sam?</i>

297
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:09,133
Callen's back in the game.

298
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:40,374
We're stopping at an auto shop
downtown... 13th and Bakers Lane.

299
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:43,734
This place creeps me out,
or maybe it's just Haziq.

300
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,340
Nick bring you here often?

301
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:47,633
Couple times.

302
00:16:47,732 --> 00:16:49,360
Haziq was trying to recruit him.

303
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,053
- For what?
- Hey,

304
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:54,431
who's this?

305
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:56,558
Nick's friend.
He called.

306
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:58,268
Told us to meet him out here.

307
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:00,017
He didn't call me.

308
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,601
Nick's friend, huh?

309
00:17:02,798 --> 00:17:03,498
Liam.

310
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:07,048
What can Nick's friend do for us?

311
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,050
I can give you
what you've been waiting for.

312
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:16,443
Come in, Nick's friend.

313
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:26,042
He's just met a guy, probably Haziq.

314
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:28,382
I'm downloading photos.
I need some more eyes down here.

315
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:30,434
Kensi's on her way.
Eric, live feeds?

316
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:31,439
No coverage.

317
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,470
Kensi, you're gonna have
to get a camera in there.

318
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:34,930
<i>I'll come up with something.</i>

319
00:17:56,198 --> 00:17:58,704
You want to bang on something,
baby, you found your man.

320
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:02,374
Hey, relax.
We're cool, eh?

321
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,001
Not today, boys.

322
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:07,379
Have a nice day.

323
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:26,695
Shakira,
bring our guest a cold drink.

324
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,420
Are you armed?

325
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,170
Back.

326
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:43,645
Cell phone?

327
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:50,464
- She doesn't know?
- Why should she? She's just a woman.

328
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:54,545
Nick is not the one
who's supposed to contact you.

329
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:57,974
He called me,
told me to come to his apartment.

330
00:18:58,034 --> 00:19:00,361
- Then he changed the meeting here.
- Why?

331
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,602
You're just gonna have
to ask him when he gets here.

332
00:19:07,186 --> 00:19:08,967
- Thank you.
- Come and sit down.

333
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:22,407
<i>The cell phone you are trying to reach
is switched off or out of range.</i>

334
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:24,200
<i>Please try again later.</i>

335
00:19:25,723 --> 00:19:26,917
Where is Rafi?

336
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:28,502
How would I know?

337
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:31,505
He's your brother.
You should be more respectful.

338
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:00,692
Sweet.

339
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:03,829
Eric, activate Callen's cell phone.

340
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:06,095
Microphone and camera coming online.

341
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:09,818
Phone cam's up at Haziq's auto shop.

342
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:11,336
Cell phone.

343
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,922
Trace it, and feed it through
to Sam to translate.

344
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:17,926
"I need you here, Nasim."

345
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:20,512
<i>"Is Rafi with you?"</i>

346
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:24,683
<i>"What about Nick?
Have you heard from him?"</i>

347
00:20:27,212 --> 00:20:28,945
<i>"I'm not sure
if there's something wrong.</i>

348
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:30,810
<i>Just get down here
as soon as you can."</i>

349
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:33,817
He's anxious.

350
00:20:34,426 --> 00:20:35,611
Feeling pressured.

351
00:20:35,931 --> 00:20:38,155
- Wants his men around him.
- He's not the only one.

352
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,007
Director Vance
on the line for you, Mace.

353
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,361
Where's Kensi?

354
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:42,743
Director?

355
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:54,086
Hey. A guy just backed into me.

356
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:56,465
- Do you think you could possibly...
- We're closed.

357
00:20:56,878 --> 00:20:59,341
Come on, man, I just need
to know if it's safe to drive.

358
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:05,395
You have a bathroom?

359
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:06,683
No, we don't.

360
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:10,562
This is not so bad.
You are safe.

361
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:13,190
It's cosmetic damage.
Just bring it back next week.

362
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:14,432
Okay.

363
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:17,527
- Is Wednesday okay?
- Wednesday's fine.

364
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,170
Thank you.

365
00:21:26,392 --> 00:21:27,913
Camera's inside the door.

366
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,456
Pulling up the new camera angle.

367
00:21:41,544 --> 00:21:43,595
I understand, Director. I will.

368
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,871
Good-bye.

369
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:47,485
Traced the call Haziq just received.

370
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:49,476
Caller's name is Nasim Boutros.

371
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:51,728
Home address is a long-stay hotel,

372
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:53,362
room 1122,

373
00:21:53,422 --> 00:21:55,190
at 73 Promenade Way, Marina Del Rey.

374
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:57,943
Mace, that's the hotel
Rivkin is staking out.

375
00:21:58,145 --> 00:22:00,151
Where was Nasim
when he made that call?

376
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:05,117
- Less than a half mile from the hotel.
- On his way home.

377
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:07,119
And Rivkin is waiting for him.
Get Gibbs.

378
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,139
- Yeah.
<i>- Vance has cleared it</i>

379
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:22,592
<i>with the Attorney General.
We have a FISA warrant. Get Rivkin.</i>

380
00:22:23,006 --> 00:22:24,421
Go around back!

381
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:55,813
- Gibbs!
- Yeah. Clear.

382
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,955
Any idea what they're arguing about?

383
00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:21,693
Cell phone coverage.

384
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,945
Haziq can't reach anyone
on his phone. And...

385
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:27,227
Jumah's telling him
it's a piece of American junk.

386
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:33,330
How did Nick sound on the phone?

387
00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:37,103
He sounded okay.

388
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:40,244
They're planning something,
aren't they?

389
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,238
If they use
what they're buying from me...

390
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:46,635
yeah.

391
00:23:49,234 --> 00:23:51,114
Do you have any idea what it is?

392
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:52,941
No.

393
00:23:53,437 --> 00:23:54,913
Change of plans.

394
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,938
You are going to make
<i>the weapons delivery today.</i>

395
00:23:58,242 --> 00:23:59,456
<i>- Here?
- Yes, here.</i>

396
00:23:59,782 --> 00:24:01,316
<i>Call whoever you need to call.</i>

397
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:03,944
You have an hour,
and then our business is done.

398
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:14,913
- He's calling Sam.
<i>- Hey, it's Liam.</i>

399
00:24:15,992 --> 00:24:19,045
<i>Bring the suitcases to the auto shop
at 13th and Baker's Lane in one hour.</i>

400
00:24:19,348 --> 00:24:21,252
Okay, let's make it happen.
One hour.

401
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:22,885
McGee, anything on Rivkin?

402
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:26,674
No. GPS marker says he didn't leave
the hotel parking lot.

403
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,245
He must have found
the GPS tracker and dumped it.

404
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:31,096
Got a BOLO out on his rental.
Nothing yet.

405
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:32,889
- Keep on it.
- Yes, ma'am.

406
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:55,451
It's him. It's Tim.

407
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,268
He knows I'm sitting at his desk.

408
00:24:57,738 --> 00:24:59,583
Tell him you're in your lab.
He won't know.

409
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,513
- He'll know. He knows everything.
- Gibbs knows everything.

410
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:04,629
McGenius is smart,
but he doesn't know everything.

411
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:06,979
Hi, Tim.

412
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,384
I'm not upstairs in the squad room.

413
00:25:09,465 --> 00:25:11,636
I'm in my lab. I'm working.

414
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:12,998
Are you sitting at my desk?

415
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:15,599
No.

416
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,170
Abby, listen, last night,

417
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,357
you did a facial recognition search
on Michael Rivkin. Why?

418
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,481
What makes you think that?

419
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:24,107
You logged the search.

420
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,182
I did?

421
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:26,610
I did.

422
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:30,633
Did Tony ask you to do it?

423
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:34,284
I'm not at liberty to say.

424
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,410
- You are at my desk, aren't you?
- Yeah.

425
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:38,288
<i>- And Tony is watching you?</i>
- Yeah.

426
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:40,540
Can I talk to Tony, please?

427
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:41,790
Okay. It's for you.

428
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,460
It's McGoo...
McGee... Tim.

429
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:44,628
<i>Sorry, McGee.</i>

430
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:48,500
Ignore her, Probie.
She's suffering Gibbs withdrawal.

431
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,765
Transferring it onto you because
of a deep-seated fear

432
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:53,887
that Gibbs may withhold love
and give her first-time head slap

433
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:56,598
if he came back and saw
his desk festooned in balloons

434
00:25:56,678 --> 00:25:58,475
and decorated like
some tacky tiki bar

435
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:01,494
with messages of affection
written possibly in blood.

436
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:03,522
She ain't missing you at all.

437
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:06,161
In fact, <i>I can't think
of a single person that's missing you.</i>

438
00:26:06,221 --> 00:26:09,069
Well, I'll tell you who we're
all missing and that's Michael Rivkin.

439
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:11,717
Define "missing".

440
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:15,210
<i>Two members of the terrorist cell
are dead after Rivkin paid them a visit,</i>

441
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,938
<i> and now he's dropped</i> out of sight.

442
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,664
Do you think
that there is any chance Ziva...

443
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,164
Don't ask that question.

444
00:26:22,246 --> 00:26:23,875
Well, Tony, someone has to ask it.

445
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:25,725
I know, McGee.

446
00:26:26,777 --> 00:26:27,545
I know.

447
00:26:27,816 --> 00:26:28,926
Leave it to me.

448
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:30,385
Here you go.

449
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:44,854
Here's what we know.

450
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:46,541
Nick Quaderi, dead.

451
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:48,766
Almost certainly killed
by Michael Rivkin.

452
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:51,084
Nationality, unknown.
Date of birth, unknown.

453
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:53,237
Quaderi has a girlfriend, Shakira.

454
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,508
Who has a brother, Rafi Zayd.

455
00:26:55,568 --> 00:26:58,488
No confirmed photo.
Moved back to Yemen when he was seven.

456
00:26:58,548 --> 00:27:01,121
No record of him returning to the U.S.
Probably here illegally.

457
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,041
Nasim Boutros,
stabbed by Rivkin at his hotel.

458
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:07,419
American citizen, born in Syria.

459
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:10,087
Immigrated here when he was 14.
Has a degree in engineering.

460
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:11,403
No criminal record.

461
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,592
First name... Jumah.
Last name... unknown.

462
00:27:14,673 --> 00:27:17,416
Looks like he works at the auto shop,
but he's not listed

463
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:20,015
as an employee with the IRS.
Possibly here illegally.

464
00:27:20,345 --> 00:27:21,850
And finally, Haziq Khaleel.

465
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:25,437
Born in Syria. Immigrated 12 years ago.
Owns the auto shop.

466
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:28,022
Pays his taxes,
and has no criminal record.

467
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:31,985
Five men,
all born outside the United States.

468
00:27:32,771 --> 00:27:34,651
Very few personal details,

469
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:36,488
no criminal activity.

470
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,283
Not on anyone's watch list.

471
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:40,200
It's a classic sleeper cell.

472
00:27:40,282 --> 00:27:42,203
Rivkin's making sure
none of them wake up.

473
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,714
Five people.

474
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:46,541
Four passports, four suitcases.
Something's missing.

475
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:49,121
Then number five is the handler.

476
00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:50,804
Maybe Haziq?

477
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:53,297
No, Haziq's an alpha male.

478
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:55,133
A physical, take-charge kind of guy.

479
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:56,839
Aggressive, angry.

480
00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:58,677
Handlers are more refined.

481
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,899
Methodical planners, smooth talkers.

482
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,805
They know how to get
under people's skin.

483
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:05,351
You know, make 'em feel
things and do things, and...

484
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:09,147
You get the idea.

485
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:11,049
If it's not Haziq?

486
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:13,485
Well, Shakira's brother
Rafi's too young.

487
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,154
Wouldn't have the respect of the others
who all seem to be older.

488
00:28:16,623 --> 00:28:19,486
- Then that leaves Nick Quaderi.
- Yeah, but according to Rafi's sister,

489
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:21,086
Nick Quaderi didn't know any of them

490
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:23,023
till her brother
introduced him to Haziq.

491
00:28:23,978 --> 00:28:25,542
Then we're missing something.

492
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:26,616
Yep.

493
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,075
Or someone.

494
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,300
What did I miss?

495
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:39,677
Abby playing with crayons,
possibly blood.

496
00:28:39,757 --> 00:28:41,823
McGee calling.
And I made a paper airplane

497
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:44,724
that was so fantastic
it broke the office gliding record.

498
00:28:44,805 --> 00:28:47,057
But really all the fun's happening
in another area code.

499
00:28:47,117 --> 00:28:48,525
Are we... fighting?

500
00:28:48,585 --> 00:28:50,563
If we were,
you would be on the floor bleeding.

501
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:54,401
Okay, I accept that as a likely outcome.
So you're just annoyed with me?

502
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:56,695
Angry?

503
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,073
- You should not be surprised.
- Because of this morning?

504
00:29:00,153 --> 00:29:03,451
You thought I would not identify
Michael Rivkin as a Mossad operative.

505
00:29:03,806 --> 00:29:05,807
- I didn't say a word.
- You did not have to.

506
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:07,622
So you think you did
the right thing?

507
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:09,013
You think I didn't?

508
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,001
Maybe
you should have told them more.

509
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:15,521
Like how well you know him.

510
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:18,049
How well do I know him, Tony?

511
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:20,369
You know him better
than they think you do.

512
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:21,561
And you know that how?

513
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:23,805
You saw him when he was in D.C.
three days ago.

514
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:27,142
You didn't tell when you had the chance.
And I'm just wondering why, that's all.

515
00:29:29,182 --> 00:29:31,426
Are you, by any chance,
questioning my loyalty?

516
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:35,511
I'm questioning why you didn't tell them
you saw him three days ago.

517
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:38,235
Are you jealous?

518
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:40,306
No.

519
00:29:40,994 --> 00:29:42,022
I'm worried.

520
00:29:42,395 --> 00:29:45,373
Because you don't seem to understand
that your secret friend is interfering

521
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:48,906
with this agency's ability
to shut down a terrorist cell.

522
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:50,915
Interfering? How is he interfering?

523
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:52,500
He's already killed two suspects.

524
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:55,003
Well, in my country
that would be cause for celebration.

525
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,559
You're not in your country,
and neither is he!

526
00:29:58,748 --> 00:29:59,806
Have you finished?

527
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:01,445
Yes.

528
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:02,384
Good.

529
00:30:02,616 --> 00:30:03,321
No.

530
00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:05,497
Another question.

531
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:08,099
- You know where we can find him?
- No, I don't.

532
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:11,609
And if you did, would you tell me?

533
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,136
No.

534
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:18,101
But I would tell Gibbs.

535
00:30:23,486 --> 00:30:26,626
I tried to stop my brother Rafi
from getting involved with them.

536
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:28,952
Now he's dragged Nick into it.

537
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:32,138
How long have you known him?

538
00:30:32,668 --> 00:30:33,905
Three months.

539
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:38,615
He travels a lot. I don't get to see him
as much as I wanted.

540
00:30:40,626 --> 00:30:43,149
At first Rafi didn't want me
to see him at all, but...

541
00:30:43,443 --> 00:30:44,564
Nick was patient.

542
00:30:45,451 --> 00:30:47,030
Now, they're like brothers.

543
00:30:49,428 --> 00:30:51,075
I've never met Rafi.

544
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:53,728
You don't have any photos, do you?

545
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Of course.

546
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:01,716
Nick took it.

547
00:31:10,222 --> 00:31:13,200
And you've probably got tons
of photos of Nick in there, huh?

548
00:31:13,654 --> 00:31:15,625
Nick's so camera shy, it's crazy.

549
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:17,418
Hard to believe, but...

550
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,269
this is the only photo I have.

551
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:33,434
Eric, talk to me.

552
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:35,644
- Have we lost audio?
- They're whispering, Mace.

553
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:37,367
- Who's whispering?
- Everybody.

554
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:39,258
Why the hell are they whispering?

555
00:31:40,403 --> 00:31:42,277
<i>- You ready?</i>
- On your command, Mace.

556
00:31:45,193 --> 00:31:47,282
Stand by. If you were Rivkin,
where would you be?

557
00:31:50,698 --> 00:31:53,387
I wouldn't be far.
I'd want to finish the job.

558
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:56,833
At our expense. If we're gonna find
their target and their support team,

559
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:58,543
we need at least one of them alive.

560
00:31:59,716 --> 00:32:01,191
No, he doesn't think that way.

561
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:04,424
- Where the hell are you going?
- Let you know when I get there.

562
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:15,560
Come on, G, speak up!

563
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:22,794
I need to contact Nick.

564
00:32:23,072 --> 00:32:24,944
You heard Haziq...
he's not answering.

565
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,251
Well, I'm guessing he gave you
another number,

566
00:32:28,104 --> 00:32:30,074
in case something bad happened.

567
00:32:33,506 --> 00:32:35,673
Something bad is going to happen.

568
00:32:38,966 --> 00:32:40,600
You can't keep running away
from this,

569
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,879
who they are,
what they're planning to do.

570
00:32:43,973 --> 00:32:45,935
Something bad's going
to happen to Nick?

571
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,930
To your brother.

572
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:51,795
Who are you?

573
00:32:52,434 --> 00:32:54,859
I'm someone you need
to trust right now.

574
00:32:58,683 --> 00:33:00,146
Okay, they've stopped whispering.

575
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:04,994
<i>I'm tired. I'm going home.
You can't keep </i>me here.

576
00:33:06,797 --> 00:33:07,930
No one leaves.

577
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:09,690
You can't stop me.

578
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:17,747
Your friend better be on time.

579
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:29,342
Promise me
nothing will happen to Rafi.

580
00:33:35,261 --> 00:33:36,311
Promise me.

581
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:39,271
I promise you.

582
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:43,600
Three-one-0...

583
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,009
five-five-five...

584
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:46,538
zero-one-three-zero.

585
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,448
<i>Nick Quaderi's real
name is Michael Rivkin.</i>

586
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,828
<i>He can be contacted at 310-555-0130.</i>

587
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:00,498
<i>I already have his number,
and I don't care</i> what his real name is.

588
00:34:01,363 --> 00:34:02,187
Okay?

589
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:12,593
- Searching for the number.
- Rivkin's been playing us all along.

590
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,008
It's a cell phone.

591
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:15,872
I need a GPS location now.

592
00:34:17,795 --> 00:34:19,851
Nick Quaderi's the name
Michael Rivkin used.

593
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:23,438
He befriended Shakira so he could get
to know her brother Rafi.

594
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:25,593
Won over the brother
to get invited into the cell.

595
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:29,402
That means that the body Rivkin
told us was Quaderi is actually...

596
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:30,987
Rafi Zayd,

597
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,319
her brother.

598
00:34:33,661 --> 00:34:36,284
All right, we got Rivkin's location.
He's almost on top of him.

599
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,245
Pass it on to the nearest team.

600
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:43,172
I can't wait. Sam?

601
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:45,793
- Game's yours.
<i>- Okay, Mace. Moving in.</i>

602
00:34:56,134 --> 00:34:57,317
Go, go, go!

603
00:34:57,426 --> 00:34:59,557
- Federal agents! Freeze!
- NCIS!

604
00:35:05,977 --> 00:35:07,749
Sam, I want him alive.

605
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:24,040
- Clear!
- Clear!

606
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,208
All clear!

607
00:35:26,372 --> 00:35:27,460
You'll live.

608
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,093
Secured.

609
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:43,742
Rivkin?

610
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,077
I got him, McGee.

611
00:36:12,582 --> 00:36:13,671
You're Gibbs.

612
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:17,868
Time for you to go home.

613
00:36:18,338 --> 00:36:19,097
Now.

614
00:36:19,896 --> 00:36:21,930
I don't like leaving
things unfinished.

615
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:23,337
You're done.

616
00:36:23,793 --> 00:36:25,177
I'm finishing it for you.

617
00:36:26,571 --> 00:36:29,765
I leave, Washington
and Tel Aviv look the other way.

618
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,062
That's not what I'd do.

619
00:36:33,351 --> 00:36:34,501
We fight the same war.

620
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:37,451
Only ours began in Auschwitz.

621
00:36:38,957 --> 00:36:40,731
I have six million uniforms.

622
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,333
- Every one is different.
- I got one.

623
00:36:54,954 --> 00:36:56,194
She works for me.

624
00:36:58,664 --> 00:36:59,625
<i>Shalom.</i>

625
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:34,670
Guess
that drink's gonna have to wait.

626
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:37,964
Well, my basement's always open.

627
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,217
- It's good to see you, Jethro.
- Yeah.

628
00:37:42,884 --> 00:37:43,679
Stay low.

629
00:37:45,406 --> 00:37:47,330
- Red-eye, huh?
- Yeah.

630
00:37:51,955 --> 00:37:53,324
Always worked for me.

631
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:11,225
Sorry.

632
00:38:12,966 --> 00:38:13,816
Thanks.

633
00:38:14,634 --> 00:38:15,888
No problem.

634
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,850
Long day, huh?

635
00:38:24,092 --> 00:38:26,425
Yeah, yeah, long... day.

636
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:31,534
Just getting some, uh, some air.

637
00:38:41,758 --> 00:38:42,488
Right.

638
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:46,325
Agent Gibbs?

639
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,124
Good to meet you, Nate.

640
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:54,419
Likewise.

641
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,722
I...

642
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:02,491
I took an oath not to betray
confidences,

643
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:03,495
but...

644
00:39:04,557 --> 00:39:07,160
I can't see any harm
in telling you a story.

645
00:39:08,477 --> 00:39:11,494
18 years ago, there was this young
lieutenant in the Military Police

646
00:39:11,554 --> 00:39:13,082
who investigated a murder.

647
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:16,787
A Marine gunnery sergeant had taken out
this Mexican drug dealer

648
00:39:16,847 --> 00:39:18,566
who killed his family.

649
00:39:18,907 --> 00:39:21,991
The young lieutenant interrogated
the suspect, didn't hold back.

650
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,517
He just wanted closure, and...

651
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:27,482
she wouldn't leave his wife
and daughter to rest in peace.

652
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,957
Kind of thing that stays with you.

653
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,509
Anyway,

654
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,673
she got all the evidence
together, and...

655
00:39:36,895 --> 00:39:38,002
then she buried it.

656
00:39:39,568 --> 00:39:40,775
Decided it was a...

657
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:42,555
just killing.

658
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,719
My guess is that the guy
never even knew

659
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:48,077
that she'd been protecting him
all these years.

660
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:51,947
Well...

661
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:54,982
I think I had enough fresh air.

662
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,352
Are you gonna get out?

663
00:40:35,482 --> 00:40:36,977
I think it's time to move.

664
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:38,483
Again?

665
00:40:39,836 --> 00:40:41,607
That's 3 times
in the last 18 months.

666
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:42,817
It's 4.

667
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:44,817
I don't know, I...

668
00:40:46,036 --> 00:40:48,030
I just feel like
someone's watching me.

669
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:50,324
It's probably that Russian girl
you told me about.

670
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:55,704
You ever gonna settle down, G?

671
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:02,503
One day.

672
00:41:26,697 --> 00:41:27,987
Crazy son of a...

673
00:41:35,282 --> 00:41:36,056
G!

674
00:41:50,317 --> 00:41:52,891
Come on, G.
Come on, G. Stay with me.

675
00:41:57,721 --> 00:42:00,246
Stay with me, G.
Don't do this to me, come on!

676
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,563
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

677
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,137
Ocean Front Road, Venice.

678
00:42:04,436 --> 00:42:06,068
Stay with me. Stay with me.

679
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:08,478
Come on, buddy.

680
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:21,855
I missed McGee.

681
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,210
I would never have guessed that.

682
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:27,880
Hey, you and Ziva want
to go get a drink?

683
00:42:28,586 --> 00:42:29,670
She is already gone.

684
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,384
Did you do that secret thingy
I asked you to do?

685
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,241
Yep.

686
00:42:34,669 --> 00:42:37,848
Rivkin flew out of Los Angeles today,
unescorted.

687
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,197
Destination?

688
00:42:39,419 --> 00:42:40,369
Tel Aviv.

689
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:42,727
With a stopover...

690
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:44,556
in DC.
