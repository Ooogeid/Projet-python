2
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,277
Take the back, McGee.

3
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:18,372
McGee?

4
00:00:19,548 --> 00:00:22,138
In position, boss.
<i>Back door's open.</i>

5
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:24,788
Federal agents! We have a warrant!

6
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:39,473
<i>Clear!</i>

7
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,534
Clear!

8
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:45,716
We've got to stop serving
warrants after lunch.

9
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:48,648
Ten bucks says McGee
spills it on this one.

10
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:50,052
Where is McGee?

11
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:09,767
Season 5 - Episode 13

14
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:22,234
Thanks to Bruno.

www.Team-NCIS.com

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,513
<i>Looks like a through-and-through
flesh wound.</i>

17
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:39,897
Well, it's a good thing
McGee's not a better shot.

18
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,527
When did you last have a tetanus shot?

19
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:44,336
Probably after

20
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:46,157
that time Dicky Newsome and I were

21
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:48,863
fighting over the Galactic Hunt
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

22
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:50,491
So last year sometime?

23
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:52,700
It was a while ago, Ducky.

24
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:55,653
Yeah, well,
a trip to the infirmary is in order.

25
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:57,374
Should we take him to the vet?

26
00:01:57,503 --> 00:02:00,841
The dog is going nowhere but back
to the lab. It's covered with evidence.

27
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:01,707
<i>Great.</i>

28
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:04,626
Abby'll have a field day
combing that for evidence.

29
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:08,244
It is not an "it" or "that."
It is a "he". And he is in pain.

30
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:11,537
Yes, well, this should alleviate that.

31
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:16,025
Actually, Dr. Mallard, it would be more
effective in the back of the neck.

32
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:17,155
Really?

33
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,622
Actually, you should pinch the skin up,

34
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:27,801
<i>so the needle doesn't
hit the muscle mass.</i>

35
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:30,655
Where did you learn that, Mr. Palmer?

36
00:02:30,922 --> 00:02:33,856
I spent two summers as a veterinary
assistant during college.

37
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:35,373
Wonderful.

38
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:37,651
I should have no problem
patching him up.

39
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:40,473
- Unless you would rather...
- No, no, carry on.

40
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:43,952
I have a body
with which to acquaint myself.

41
00:02:44,488 --> 00:02:45,750
Not the only one.

42
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,970
DiNozzo, Ziva, come on.

43
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,533
Boss,

44
00:02:52,147 --> 00:02:53,343
what about me?

45
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,765
Take the evidence back to Abby.

46
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,219
<i>Petty Officer Kyle Hanson,
military working dog handler</i>

47
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:04,653
with the Pax River Master-at-Arms Force.

48
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,612
- Drug Enforcement Unit.
- Enforcing everyone but himself.

49
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:12,457
Given the prevalence of bite marks,
torn flesh,

50
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:15,307
puncture wounds, I'd postulate that

51
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,319
Petty Officer Hanson
was the victim of a dog attack.

52
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:20,328
Really going out on a limb there, Duck.

53
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:23,257
That assumption is further substantiated

54
00:03:23,313 --> 00:03:26,660
by the presence of a dog
at the scene of the crime.

55
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:30,584
By cracky, Dr. Mallard,
I believe you've solved the case!

56
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,733
Did you wake up in the wrong bed
this morning?

57
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:37,169
If your question is: "did I
wake up on the wrong side of the bed?",

58
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,815
the answer is no,
but my mood did sour somewhat

59
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:42,642
when I walked in and found
that our chief suspect was dead.

60
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:46,170
And it appears he's been
dead for at least 36 hours.

61
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:47,983
That explains his disappearance

62
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,524
and why he did not show up
for his dog-handling duties.

63
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,467
Doesn't explain why his dog
turned on him.

64
00:03:52,468 --> 00:03:54,747
It's just too bad, you know.
If we had a little more time,

65
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:57,040
we would've been able to bust this guy,
turn him and find out

66
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,062
who was shipping drugs
through this base.

67
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:00,545
Unfortunately,

68
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,367
thanks to Semper Fido,

69
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,270
he's never going to roll over.

70
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:05,878
Sorry, boss.

71
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:09,096
- Play dead.
<i>- Gibbs!</i>

72
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:11,711
I can help. Sorry, sorry, boss.

73
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:15,540
<i>Room with a view.</i>

74
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:16,522
Hey!

75
00:04:21,753 --> 00:04:22,757
Cocaine?

76
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:25,184
Well, you tell me.

77
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:27,521
<i>Looks like someone was
in a hurry to rip into it.</i>

78
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:28,937
Or bite into it.

79
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:31,644
Would explain why the dog
went all Hannibal Lecter.

80
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,191
<i>Sorry, I know. Movie reference.</i>

81
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,532
Cocaine.

82
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:40,490
And a generous allowance.

83
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,127
If Hanson wasn't dead,
we'd have enough to arrest him.

84
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:48,533
Hey, McGee.

85
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:52,377
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

86
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:54,421
What happened to you?

87
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,651
I was attacked by a vicious dog.

88
00:04:57,271 --> 00:04:58,414
Are you okay?

89
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,477
- Careful, careful.
- Sorry.

90
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:01,942
Did you provoke it?

91
00:05:02,073 --> 00:05:04,420
If you consider serving
a warrant provoking.

92
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:06,280
What happened to the dog?

93
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:07,963
He was shot.

94
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:09,754
What?!

95
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:13,510
McGee!

96
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:15,936
- Poor thing.
<i>- Abby.</i>

97
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:18,290
Abby, careful, that is one vicious dog.

98
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:20,980
Yeah, McGee.

99
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,525
It's really vicious.

100
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:25,871
Well, Ducky and Jimmy sedated him.

101
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:28,910
We're hoping you can
get some evidence off of him.

102
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,822
There, that's better.

103
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:34,254
Who would shoot this cute little dog?

104
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:36,285
<i>Look at you.</i>

105
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:45,346
It was self-defense.
It... it was self-defense!

106
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,249
You shot that cute little dog?!

107
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:50,118
He's not cute and little.

108
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:52,780
He's... he's vicious and large.

109
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:54,722
How could you shoot
an innocent animal, McGee?

110
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:57,490
Abby, that dog is not innocent,
he killed someone.

111
00:05:57,604 --> 00:06:00,340
Dogs don't kill people.
People kill people.

112
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,633
People with dogs that
kill people kill people.

113
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:06,887
You didn't kill anybody, did you?

114
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:08,050
<i>No.</i>

115
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,064
That's my Hugo Boss.

116
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:17,956
Don't you think that you're compromising
the evidence with my $500 jacket?

117
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:21,370
If you think

118
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:23,387
that I can't distinguish

119
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:25,571
<i>the fibers on your stupid jacket</i>

120
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:28,797
from the evidence on the dog,
you don't know me, McGee.

121
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:31,730
And right now?
I don't want to know you.

122
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:35,379
Good dog.

123
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:38,316
Bad McGee!

124
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:49,790
I just got a call from Pax River.

125
00:06:49,857 --> 00:06:52,561
The Base Commander's talking
like the case is closed.

126
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:55,265
That's a dead end. It's still open.

127
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,765
He claims we got our man.

128
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:00,962
Got one link in a bigger chain.
Still got five suspects.

129
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:03,244
From his point of view, both the cocaine

130
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,394
and the trafficker were found.
Problem solved.

131
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:09,046
Is that your point of view?

132
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:13,067
I can... sympathize
with the Commander's impatience.

133
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:16,483
Well, you "sympathize".
I'll keep investigating.

134
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:18,137
Suspect's dead.

135
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:19,892
You played your hand.

136
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:22,663
Rest of the team closed up shop.

137
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:27,509
I can't afford to waste resources
if the trail's gone cold.

138
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:31,295
Director, the only thing that's cold
is that body in autopsy.

139
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:33,577
Clock's ticking.

140
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:37,253
I will inform the Base Commander
that you will be prudent

141
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:39,881
in your disruption of his operations.

142
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,627
Something else?

143
00:07:56,095 --> 00:07:58,284
- Hey, they check you for rabies?
- No.

144
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:01,476
<i>What?</i>

145
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:02,780
Cujo.

146
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:05,757
You know, the movie?
Based on the novel by Stephen King?

147
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,788
Perfectly friendly Saint Bernard

148
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:09,471
Contracts rabies,

149
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:11,438
bites up everyone in this town.

150
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,415
<i>I mean, people's brains
start swelling up,</i>

151
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:17,493
leaking out of their ears.
People are foaming at the mouth.

152
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:20,485
Define foaming.

153
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:22,243
<i>You do not have rabies.</i>

154
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:24,414
You're getting him all worried
for no good reason.

155
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,610
She's right, McGruff.

156
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:28,099
<i>What you should worry about
is whether our dead petty officer,</i>

157
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,572
whose blood was all over the dog,

158
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:31,778
cause he might have had
some transmittable disease like

159
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,781
- like herpes or hepatitis or Malaria.
- I hadn't thought about that.

160
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,261
Have any of you thought about
how to pick up the pieces to this case?

161
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:39,948
The one piece that we did have,

162
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:42,114
Petty Officer Hanson,
is now lying in pieces...

163
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:43,839
thanks to a possibly rabid dog.

164
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:47,270
- Bad timing for us and for him.
- What do we know, McGee?

165
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:50,652
We know that Hanson recently
called a known cocaine trafficker,

166
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:54,350
Diego Galante, in Panama, and
that Galante has recently disappeared.

167
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:55,881
- Hiding.
- Or dead.

168
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,140
We also know Galante claimed
he had bribed a flight crew,

169
00:08:59,196 --> 00:09:02,419
and that he had access to Coco
Solo Naval Air Station in Panama,

170
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,531
where C-130s make regular

171
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:07,647
supply flights from
Pax River every week.

172
00:09:07,742 --> 00:09:10,930
When we cross-check which flights
match that pattern, we come up with...

173
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,061
- Suspects.
- One or more of them?

174
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:17,473
<i>- Any of them called Galante?</i>
- No, just Hanson.

175
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,622
<i>Galante would have
ditched his cell by now.</i>

176
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:21,922
I think it's time we go
in and lean on those guys, boss.

177
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:22,985
Not yet.

178
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:25,842
- McGee.
- I know, boss.

179
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:29,623
Boss, we've already been through
all this. I mean, I got no leads.

180
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:32,015
Ziva's flirted with every seaman
on the base, and McGee's

181
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:34,373
watched a hundred hours
of Petty Officer Junction.

182
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:35,638
150, actually.

183
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,413
Go back to Pax River and talk
to the other dog handlers.

184
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:40,525
See if one of them barks. I know.

185
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:42,592
Hey, McGee?

186
00:09:43,044 --> 00:09:43,885
Yeah?

187
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:45,333
<i>You okay?</i>

188
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,090
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, boss.

189
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:53,347
You're a clean boy. Okay.

190
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:57,418
Be a good boy while Abby scrubs
the inside of your mouth for DNA.

191
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:02,176
Who's a good Jethro?

192
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,105
<i>I'm a good Jethro.</i>

193
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,663
Don't be mad. Be flattered.

194
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:10,603
He's just so strong and handsome
and quiet, so I named him "Jethro".

195
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:11,708
<i>Abby?</i>

196
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:13,588
Well, "Butch" was just too...

197
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:16,293
you know, butch.
And don't worry 'cause I got enough

198
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:19,262
blood and hair and
fiber samples before I cleaned him.

199
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:23,118
I don't have results for you yet,
and I know how much you love results.

200
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:24,626
Abs.

201
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:26,571
<i>That's not what you're here to tell me.</i>

202
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:28,075
<i>You're here to tell me</i>

203
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,793
Abby, don't get too attached to the dog
because he doesn't belong to us,

204
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,975
we don't know where the evidence
is going to lead us yet.

205
00:10:33,988 --> 00:10:35,878
- OK good, I won't have to tell you.
<i>- No.</i>

206
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:37,110
You don't.

207
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:38,608
<i>Abs.</i>

208
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,983
The dog belongs in the kennel.

209
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,266
No, he doesn't, Gibbs.

210
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:45,533
He shouldn't be behind bars.
He's innocent.

211
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,364
Okay, come on.

212
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:51,892
Get inside.

213
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:54,612
I'm going to prove it to you.

214
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:57,683
I took a swab from Jethro and
I took a swab from the victim's neck.

215
00:10:57,813 --> 00:11:01,444
When I get the results back, I'm going
to show you that they don't match.

216
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:02,856
We'll see.

217
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:09,109
<i>The dog stays in the kennel, Abs.</i>

218
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,614
<i>- Do you know him?</i>
- Lieutenant Commander, flight crew.

219
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:18,624
Don't know them all.
Don't know him.

220
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,307
His name is Warfield.

221
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,469
Do you know Lieutenant Bowen?

222
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,847
No, ma'am.

223
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:29,302
Can you tell me what kind of people
Hanson was associating with?

224
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:31,943
Did he say anything
to you before he went UA?

225
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:35,645
Your shoulders work
much better than your mouth.

226
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:37,819
I work with dogs, ma'am, not people.

227
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,457
You worked with Hanson.

228
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,234
Did anything about his behavior
or activities seem suspicious to you?

229
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:46,785
You don't like us being here, do you?

230
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,129
Is it because we are
cops interviewing other cops,

231
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:52,002
or is it because you guys could
not sniff out who was smuggling drugs,

232
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:54,111
and we have to do your job for you?

233
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,827
Sorry, ma'am. I just didn't get to know
Petty Officer Hanson all that well.

234
00:11:58,354 --> 00:12:01,178
Obviously, you did not converse
with him on a regular basis,

235
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:04,392
but, surely, you must have
noticed something about the man.

236
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,283
Hanson was a showboat.

237
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:07,888
He liked to flaunt the cash.

238
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:10,238
<i>Draw your own conclusions.</i>

239
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:12,960
- Dogs you work with ever bite?
- Not mine.

240
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:16,178
- What about Hanson's?
- Kyle was a friend.

241
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:17,949
I don't like to speak ill of anybody,

242
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:20,370
especially not somebody who
died a horrible death like that.

243
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:22,673
So you're covering cause you know
he guilty of something?

244
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:26,457
No, sir. Just couldn't keep
complete control of his dog is all.

245
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:29,054
Got aggressive on me
and others on occasion.

246
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:32,553
What would happen if a
dog got a taste of some cocaine?

247
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:34,109
Is that what happened?

248
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:35,511
It would be bad, sir.

249
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,875
Dog-handling.

250
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:40,052
Must be a pretty "ruff" job.

251
00:12:41,332 --> 00:12:43,593
I don't want to dog you
with a lot more questions,

252
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,926
but if I need to sniff around more,
is there a number I can call, or...?

253
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:49,491
Folks inside keep
track of me pretty good.

254
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:50,876
You can call them.

255
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:57,570
What about this one, Dr. Mallard?

256
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:00,017
Those wounds are glancing.

257
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:02,453
<i>Too much tearing, I'm afraid.</i>

258
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:06,129
Now, what we're looking for
is a representational

259
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:07,894
bite-hold.

260
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:11,170
<i>This one will do.</i>

261
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:14,149
You know, Mr. Palmer,

262
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,056
<i>a number of these</i>

263
00:13:16,118 --> 00:13:18,983
<i>puncture wounds
are exceedingly sharp.</i>

264
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:22,908
Certain breeds, especially shepherds,
can have needle-sharp teeth

265
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,589
capable of inflicting severe
puncture wounds.

266
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:27,992
As on the clavicle here.

267
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,241
Did you get your shots, Timothy?

268
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,441
I feel like a dartboard.

269
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:35,500
Guess that's better
than being a chew toy.

270
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:39,877
If you're looking for my findings,
I'll be done momentarily.

271
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:42,021
Actually, Ducky, I was...

272
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,332
I was wondering if you could tell me
what the symptoms of rabies are?

273
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:49,120
Yes, well, I will yield the floor
to young Palmer here,

274
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,288
<i>and allow our resident dog expert</i>

275
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:55,423
to explain to you why you do
not have rabies.

276
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:58,546
You got it?

277
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,264
- Well, I've got enough.
- No, no.

278
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,238
We need to do this one together.

279
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:04,596
Duck.

280
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:14,615
Hey, Gibbs.
Hey, Ducky.

281
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:19,975
Did you meet Jethro?

282
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:22,037
Yeah, quite a number of years ago.

283
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:25,244
No, not Gibbs. Jethro.

284
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:27,988
<i>- Say hi to him.</i>
- Hello, Jethro.

285
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:29,146
Say hi to Ducky.

286
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:31,427
<i>Abs.</i>

287
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:32,633
Good boy.

288
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:34,334
Ducky has his initial findings.

289
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:40,066
Yes, well,
Petty Officer Hanson was mauled.

290
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:43,695
He had a neck wound that
severed his carotid artery,

291
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:45,688
and that made him bleed to death.

292
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:48,802
You understand what
he's saying to you, Abs?

293
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:51,257
Well, yeah.
Hanson was killed by a dog.

294
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,547
It doesn't say this dog.

295
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:55,152
Abby, c-come on.

296
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:56,898
Jethro is innocent.

297
00:14:57,102 --> 00:15:00,376
I found pieces of Hanson's
flesh in Jethro's teeth.

298
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,105
Well, that sounds innocent.

299
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:04,480
Flesh that had hair follicles on it

300
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,247
- from Hanson's arm, not his neck.
- Well, that's hardly surprising.

301
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:11,154
We found multiple
perforating injuries on

302
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:13,495
most of Hanson's extremities.

303
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:15,795
Well, that hardly suggests
the dog was innocent.

304
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,098
It shows that Jethro

305
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:19,901
<i>was trying to drag his owner.</i>

306
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:21,655
He was trying to save Hanson.

307
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,495
Or Hanson was putting up his arms

308
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,252
to protect himself
from a dog that was killing him.

309
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:28,621
<i>We don't know that.</i>
And there's still a lot of evidence

310
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:30,844
that has to be processed.
There's the castings.

311
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:34,763
I haven't gotten a DNA
match yet on the dog's saliva.

312
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,064
Butch?

313
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:41,032
Butch.

314
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:51,907
<i>Wait. Go back.</i>

315
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,911
<i>Tolliver just handed
something to Sanchez.</i>

316
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:56,396
<i>Small package.</i>

317
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:58,285
Could be drugs.

318
00:15:58,722 --> 00:16:00,108
What's he doing?

319
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:02,938
<i>He's opening it.</i>

320
00:16:04,758 --> 00:16:06,186
He's examining it.

321
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:10,645
- He's eating it.
- Looks like Funyuns.

322
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,565
What do we got?

323
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:15,147
A sudden urge to hit
the vending machines.

324
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,058
McGee?

325
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:18,910
- Besides eye strain, not much, boss.
- No pressure, boss,

326
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:22,864
but I just got word the Pax River Five
are shipping out to Panama in 36 hours.

327
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:25,549
We'll lose access to them
for at least a week, maybe two.

328
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:27,041
- Bring 'em in?
- No.

329
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:28,738
We go to them. Catch 'em off guard.

330
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:31,700
- Shake the tree, see what falls.
- Ziva, DiNozzo.

331
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:32,829
<i>Let's go.</i>

332
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:34,896
Boss?

333
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:37,570
- Yeah. Gibbs.
<i>- Gibbs, I've got something.</i>

334
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,772
I'll meet you in the car.

335
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:46,674
Gibbs. Look in the microscope.

336
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,381
Found cocaine in the dog.

337
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,966
Just look in the microscope, Gibbs.
Do it.

338
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:56,849
It looks like a bug.

339
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:59,016
It's not just a bug, Gibbs.

340
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:01,073
It's a flea!

341
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:02,705
Okay.

342
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:04,293
Look.

343
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:09,761
Ducky found that flea on the deceased.

344
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:13,514
I went over every inch of Jethro.

345
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:14,766
Not one flea.

346
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:17,240
Which means he is totally clean,

347
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,400
which means he's totally innocent.

348
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:22,218
Flea could've jumped off the
dog and landed on the dead guy, Abs.

349
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,028
That kind of wild conjecture
would never stand up in court.

350
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:27,340
Did you read the rest of Ducky's report?

351
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,534
Well, sometimes Ducky's wrong.

352
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:32,343
I mean, not... not often.

353
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:35,056
Maybe, one time.

354
00:17:37,074 --> 00:17:37,923
Abs,

355
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,690
we have to give the dog back.

356
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,128
Gibbs...

357
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:45,638
you know what that means.

358
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:47,594
You can't keep the dog, Abs.

359
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:51,384
But...

360
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:55,483
Okay.

361
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:59,115
Okay.

362
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:03,668
I'll give him back after I finished
getting all the evidence off of him.

363
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:07,132
How much more do you need, Abby?

364
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:09,577
You found cocaine in the dog.

365
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:12,667
You got the victim's flesh
on the dog's teeth,

366
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:15,168
dog's Saliva on the victim.

367
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:17,122
He attacked McGee.

368
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:18,554
Gibbs.

369
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,925
<i>Look at his eyes.</i>

370
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:24,266
Does he look like a killer?

371
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,188
You are just making this
rougher on yourself, Abs.

372
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:35,376
<i>If you have a moment...</i>

373
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,134
<i>up to the office.</i>

374
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:46,878
Can I help you?

375
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,938
Petty Officer Erica Perelli,
dog handler, Pax River.

376
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:55,368
You the one shot Hanson's dog?

377
00:18:57,815 --> 00:18:59,697
Looks like he bit you pretty bad.

378
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:01,940
I've been bitten harder.

379
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:04,487
By dogs. I love dogs.

380
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:06,657
I'm a... I'm a dog person, really.

381
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:08,273
What kind of dog do you have?

382
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:12,074
I don't yet, but-but I might...

383
00:19:12,587 --> 00:19:14,557
will soon, very soon.

384
00:19:14,668 --> 00:19:17,214
I just need to find the right girl...
dog.

385
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,269
Girl dog. I want a girl dog.

386
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:23,346
- I do like, boys, though, of course.
- Don't ask, don't tell, McGee.

387
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:27,463
Hey, boss. This is Petty
Officer Perelli. She is here to...

388
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:29,045
To collect the dog, sir.

389
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:31,603
<i>Sorry to say he has to be put down.</i>

390
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:38,255
I wish there can be another way,
but it's Navy policy

391
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:39,975
in fatal dog-mauling cases.

392
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,574
Boss, I can take Petty Officer
Perelli down, if you'd like.

393
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:53,367
You can call me Erica.

394
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:55,409
Timothy.

395
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:58,433
There have been a lot of tough
assignments over the years, but...

396
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:00,472
this is one of the toughest.

397
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:03,922
It's probably not
going to get any easier.

398
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:06,152
Abby, our forensic scientist,

399
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:08,388
has become a bit attached to the dog.

400
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:10,486
How attached?

401
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:16,778
Abby?

402
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,081
Abby?

403
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:35,436
NCIS!

404
00:20:37,164 --> 00:20:39,970
Gather around, kids.
We're gonna have a little chat.

405
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:42,195
We have a training mission.

406
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:44,882
Not anymore.

407
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,350
We know without a doubt
that a major cocaine

408
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:50,828
smuggling operation
was run out of this aircraft.

409
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:52,807
The name Diego Galante ring any bells?

410
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,579
Major drug trafficker in Panama.

411
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:56,377
Supplying to someone on this aircraft.

412
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:57,809
<i>- This is bullcrap.</i>
- Sir,

413
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:00,999
if by bullcrap, you mean your worst
freakin' nightmare, then,

414
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,782
yeah, this is bullcrap.

415
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:05,416
Those contrabandistas
down there will say anything.

416
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:07,144
Doesn't make it true.

417
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:09,138
Doesn't make it false.

418
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,841
<i>So I heard some rumors.</i>

419
00:21:10,952 --> 00:21:13,035
Some local guy bragging
he bribed the flight crew.

420
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:15,848
- You didn't believe him.
- Nobody can bribe a whole flight crew.

421
00:21:15,968 --> 00:21:17,692
He only had to bribe one.

422
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:19,359
As loadmaster, you're in charge

423
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,379
of everything that's
brought aboard the aircraft?

424
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:22,407
Yes, sir.

425
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:25,696
So you could sneak aboard
whatever you wanted?

426
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,449
You seem nervous.

427
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:30,424
- Don't like being questioned by cops.
- Because you did something.

428
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:33,024
Because it can cause me trouble,
even when I didn't do something.

429
00:21:33,113 --> 00:21:36,913
As flight engineer, I'm in charge of
every moving part of this aircraft, sir.

430
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,846
Gives you access to
every nook and cranny.

431
00:21:38,912 --> 00:21:41,172
Lot of hiding places on a C-130?

432
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:44,710
If I was smuggling drugs,
I'd be living it up in Georgetown,

433
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:47,078
not slumming it in the barracks, sir.

434
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:49,646
I don't believe any of
my men are involved in this,

435
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:53,619
but even the best aircraft commanders
have a limited field of vision.

436
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,249
Well, it's your crew.
Your responsibility.

437
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,694
You know how long a prison
sentence you'd be facing?

438
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:00,240
- Life.
- Life.

439
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:04,011
If you're not involved, you don't
want to go down with the person who is.

440
00:22:04,165 --> 00:22:07,576
If you are involved, and you talk,
you will get a reduced sentence.

441
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,666
A limited-time offer. Otherwise...

442
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:11,622
We're like a locked-on missile.

443
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:13,592
The only question is

444
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:14,865
who we take down.

445
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,929
Think they're all involved?

446
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,245
No.

447
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:20,522
Think we rattled them?

448
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,714
We'll see.

449
00:22:40,055 --> 00:22:41,468
Can I help you, ma'am?

450
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:43,321
I'm looking for fleas.

451
00:22:45,036 --> 00:22:45,966
Fleas?

452
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,572
<i>Yeah.</i>

453
00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:50,652
Yes, ma'am.

454
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,660
All right, Jethro.

455
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:02,659
We're just gathering evidence.

456
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:04,975
It's for your own defense.

457
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:07,583
Jethro!

458
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:09,102
Jethro!

459
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:11,244
Jethro!

460
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,044
I'm Jethro.

461
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,823
<i>Jethro!</i>

462
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:17,283
Jethro, come here.

463
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:19,017
<i>Jeth...</i>

464
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:20,795
Jethro!

465
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:23,484
Don't ever do that again!

466
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,876
- Hey, McGee.
<i>- Where'd you take the dog?</i>

467
00:23:34,527 --> 00:23:38,417
<i>- Abby?</i>
- I'm at the naval base, McGee.

468
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,288
<i>You better get down here.</i>
I think we have another body.

469
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,883
Careful, Mr. Palmer.

470
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:53,845
<i>We're trying to take bones
out of the ground, not put mine in.</i>

471
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:54,965
<i>Of course.</i>

472
00:23:56,244 --> 00:23:58,016
That dog should have
a muzzle on it, Abby.

473
00:23:58,082 --> 00:23:59,935
Put a muzzle on yourself, McGee.

474
00:24:00,457 --> 00:24:01,919
It's not like he shot you.

475
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:06,791
I know I shouldn't have taken
him out without authorization,

476
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,120
but time was of the essence.

477
00:24:08,158 --> 00:24:11,061
And besides, Jethro might
have uncovered an important clue.

478
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,587
Or maybe it's another one
of his victims and he's confessing.

479
00:24:13,742 --> 00:24:15,026
Or maybe it's his lunch.

480
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,625
Only if he was a cannibal, Jethro.

481
00:24:19,218 --> 00:24:21,034
I wasn't talking to you.

482
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:23,575
And, you may want to cover your eyes.

483
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,672
What's here is not human.

484
00:24:27,693 --> 00:24:29,110
It's canine.

485
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,832
Criminal investigation is really an art.

486
00:24:34,629 --> 00:24:37,109
It involves creativity and inspiration.

487
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:38,620
Don't you think?

488
00:24:39,454 --> 00:24:41,232
You found a clue, Tony.

489
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:43,016
It does not make you Picasso.

490
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,394
I'm sensing a little frustration here.

491
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:49,320
<i>Envy. Let it go.</i>
It's counterproductive.

492
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,889
Boss, I got something.

493
00:24:52,418 --> 00:24:54,743
The pilot we talked to,
Lieutenant Commander Warfield,

494
00:24:55,097 --> 00:24:56,967
has a cousin stationed at Pax River.

495
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:59,191
<i>Petty Officer Phillip Granger.</i>

496
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,318
Warfield listed him
as his emergency contact.

497
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,630
Granger was busted for cocaine
possession two months ago.

498
00:25:03,631 --> 00:25:06,083
Failed to appear to face charges.
He has fled.

499
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,516
Family business.
Warfield supplies to his cousin.

500
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:09,574
Maybe.

501
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:12,001
- Certainly worth another chat with him.
<i>- Keep digging.</i>

502
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:14,664
I have more on Lieutenant
Commander Warfield.

503
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,145
You do?

504
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,637
Fetch.

505
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:25,549
What'd you find?

506
00:25:25,668 --> 00:25:26,820
A little inspiration.

507
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:28,371
- Hey.
- Hey, Timothy!

508
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:29,837
Timothy?

509
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:31,697
I guess she prefers McGee's scent.

510
00:25:33,054 --> 00:25:34,426
She'll eat him alive.

511
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,728
Let it go, Tony.

512
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:41,965
I'm sorry you had to
make two trips out here.

513
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:43,182
I don't mind.

514
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:46,914
Besides the last thing I want to do
is put down a dog.

515
00:26:06,544 --> 00:26:08,448
<i>Pay no attention to him, Jethro.</i>

516
00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:12,507
<i>Abby, open the door.</i>

517
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:17,314
<i>Jethro has to go now.</i>

518
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,526
<i>Abby.</i>

519
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:21,820
I can't hear you, McGee.

520
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,000
<i>If you can't hear me,
why did you answer?</i>

521
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:36,946
I am not opening the door
until Jethro is proven innocent.

522
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,695
<i>Abby, do not make a scene.</i>

523
00:26:38,986 --> 00:26:42,749
<i>Too late,
McGee, I am in full scene mode.</i>

524
00:26:42,882 --> 00:26:44,478
<i>You can't stay in there forever.</i>

525
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:47,872
<i>I'm fully stocked on both Caf-Pow!
And kibble.</i>

526
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:49,658
<i>I'm good for at least a few days.</i>

527
00:26:57,391 --> 00:27:00,122
So now you're trying to
pick us off one at a time?

528
00:27:00,645 --> 00:27:02,837
Right now it is not about us,
it is about you.

529
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:05,389
<i>You are the one with a cousin busted
with cocaine.</i>

530
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:07,460
Is that what this is all about?

531
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:09,116
My loser cousin?

532
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:11,131
We're not even close.

533
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,806
Close enough to give him
some of the blow you smuggled in.

534
00:27:13,961 --> 00:27:15,867
I didn't smuggle anything.

535
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,049
We know that your plane brought it in

536
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:20,877
every three weeks
for the past three months.

537
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:22,224
Like clockwork.

538
00:27:22,426 --> 00:27:24,425
Two months ago
I was in a sick bay in Panama

539
00:27:25,016 --> 00:27:26,854
and I didn't fly the aircraft back.

540
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,091
I hopped on a transport a week later.

541
00:27:29,463 --> 00:27:32,744
If you had checked properly, your
own records would prove me innocent.

542
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:37,815
Records can't prove one's
guilt or one's innocence.

543
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:40,583
- Damn straight.
<i>- Like this record</i>

544
00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:42,706
<i>from that sick bay in Panama.</i>

545
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,309
For three consecutive days,

546
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:49,066
<i>you signed out from 2:00</i>

547
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:51,155
<i>to 5:00 in the afternoon.</i>

548
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:54,573
Guess you were not too sick
to meet with your supplier.

549
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,428
You got it all wrong.

550
00:28:00,654 --> 00:28:03,709
One phone call and I can get
every record out of Panama,

551
00:28:03,777 --> 00:28:05,709
<i>every single person
on that base interviewed,</i>

552
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,098
every single step you took retraced.

553
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,622
You don't want me making
that phone call, do you?

554
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,151
<i>Where were you?</i>

555
00:28:15,656 --> 00:28:17,186
I will make that call.

556
00:28:17,973 --> 00:28:19,611
I was seeing a woman.

557
00:28:22,104 --> 00:28:23,809
<i>Rosa, a translator.</i>

558
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,841
<i>I was helping her out.</i>

559
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:27,233
By sleeping with her?

560
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:28,803
I care about her.

561
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,270
She's a single mom with a six-year-old.

562
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:35,357
Her boy had a respiratory infection
real bad, drowning in his own lungs.

563
00:28:36,887 --> 00:28:38,051
That's sad.

564
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,211
No, that's leverage.

565
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:43,155
<i>So you went to sick bay complaining
of a respiratory infection.</i>

566
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:45,394
You did it to get drugs for the boy.

567
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:46,972
He could have died.

568
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:50,094
Illegal transfer
of prescription medication,

569
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:52,655
dereliction of duty,
conduct unbecoming.

570
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:57,190
I smell a dishonorable
discharge in your future.

571
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,354
Question:

572
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:01,075
do you like being a pilot?

573
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:06,442
I will forget everything you've
just told me if you "remember"

574
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:07,588
who

575
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:10,109
in your crew has been acting
suspiciously.

576
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,751
You are willing to give up your entire
career for somebody else's crime?

577
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:19,562
- No.
- Then give me a name.

578
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:21,004
I don't have a name.

579
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,670
- You are lying.
- I'm not. I don't know.

580
00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:37,266
He is telling the truth.

581
00:29:39,351 --> 00:29:40,666
Any way you translate it.

582
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,962
Your investigation?

583
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:57,571
Moving along.

584
00:30:06,987 --> 00:30:10,397
You've been looking at me all
week like you want to ask me something.

585
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:14,515
Any health issues?

586
00:30:15,632 --> 00:30:16,784
I'm fine.

587
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:20,660
Are you sick?

588
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,537
My health is fine.

589
00:30:27,483 --> 00:30:29,712
Yours, however,
could take a turn for the worse

590
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:32,168
if you don't wrap up this investigation.

591
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:43,985
Go away, McGee.

592
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:45,804
<i>Abby!</i>

593
00:30:47,196 --> 00:30:48,196
Director.

594
00:30:53,594 --> 00:30:55,432
- Do we have a problem?
<i>- Nope.</i>

595
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,625
<i>No problem.</i>

596
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,115
<i>Good.</i>

597
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:01,816
<i>Then could you open the door?</i>

598
00:31:08,937 --> 00:31:09,942
Thank you.

599
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:15,371
He doesn't look very good, does he?

600
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:18,577
<i>I think it's because
he knows he's on death row.</i>

601
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:22,213
That would put a damper
on anybody's spirits.

602
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:26,164
I suppose you're going
to order me to give him up, huh?

603
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:28,845
Is that what it's going to take?

604
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:33,848
If I had more time,
I could prove that he didn't do it.

605
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:37,835
You seem to be the only
one around here who thinks so.

606
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:40,341
So what? So what if I am?

607
00:31:40,513 --> 00:31:42,876
You have to stand up
for what you believe in.

608
00:31:43,107 --> 00:31:46,972
<i>You have to stick to your guns
until you can make a wrong right.</i>

609
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:53,120
Sometimes things aren't so simple, Abby.

610
00:31:54,024 --> 00:31:57,312
Sometimes you can't control the outcome.

611
00:31:58,142 --> 00:32:00,279
<i>Sometimes you have to...</i>

612
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,536
look at the reality in front of you...

613
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:05,364
and accept it.

614
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:08,003
I can't.

615
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,496
And I won't.

616
00:32:17,987 --> 00:32:19,934
<i>He really doesn't look good, does he?</i>

617
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:30,854
Finding inspiration?

618
00:32:31,097 --> 00:32:32,491
Whenever I can.

619
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,370
He's my personal McMuse.

620
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,144
"When Dogs Attack!"
It's very funny.

621
00:32:42,972 --> 00:32:46,493
All bark,
no bite, like the rest of my team.

622
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:48,173
Hey.

623
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:50,433
I just got an e-mail
from Abby with teeth.

624
00:32:50,756 --> 00:32:53,608
Lab results from the cocaine
we found in Hanson's house.

625
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:56,915
Wrappings contained minute
trace of hydraulic fluid.

626
00:32:57,054 --> 00:32:59,339
The crew member who comes
into contact most often

627
00:32:59,384 --> 00:33:01,941
with hydraulic fluid is
the flight engineer.

628
00:33:02,102 --> 00:33:03,676
Petty Officer Bidwell.

629
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,510
Boss?

630
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:10,942
Come on.

631
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:22,548
Flight Operations said
Bidwell was working on a plane.

632
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:23,770
Check inside.

633
00:33:29,377 --> 00:33:30,838
NCIS.

634
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,128
Petty Officer Bidwell?

635
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:03,797
Accident?

636
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,032
<i>Not.</i>

637
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:07,506
<i>Looks like that's the lever</i>

638
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:09,076
it unlocks all the pallets.

639
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,153
Standard ops is lock as you load.

640
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:12,585
Jittery partner.

641
00:34:13,023 --> 00:34:15,375
So we know that Bidwell
brought in the drugs

642
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:18,668
<i>and Hanson helped get
them through the base.</i>

643
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,967
We don't know anything until
we know everything. You keep looking.

644
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:26,149
Probie-Wan Kenobi.

645
00:34:27,987 --> 00:34:29,308
<i>Wait a second.</i>

646
00:34:30,463 --> 00:34:32,675
What, do you want me to
dust the whole plane by myself?

647
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:36,796
Just the flat surfaces
where you can lift a print.

648
00:34:36,797 --> 00:34:38,372
Yeah, the whole plane.

649
00:34:40,271 --> 00:34:41,789
Ducky, I need help!

650
00:34:42,336 --> 00:34:43,837
- What happened?
<i>- I don't know!</i>

651
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:46,262
He was acting funny and
then he started coughing up blood.

652
00:34:46,263 --> 00:34:48,088
Get the X-ray machine, Mr. Palmer.

653
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:49,772
- Is he dying?
- I don't know.

654
00:34:49,773 --> 00:34:51,088
That's not a good answer!

655
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,070
You must calm down.

656
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,651
<i>In his stomach, right there.</i>

657
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:14,949
What is it?

658
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,357
Something that doesn't belong.

659
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:17,845
Prepare to sedate, Mr. Palmer.

660
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:19,643
You'll find everything
you need in my bag.

661
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:20,726
<i>Right away, doctor.</i>

662
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,358
We're going to have to operate.

663
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:25,307
<i>Is he going to be okay?</i>

664
00:35:25,308 --> 00:35:26,780
<i>The inside of a dog's stomach</i>

665
00:35:26,982 --> 00:35:28,113
is like a sewer.

666
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,248
Survival rates are not good.

667
00:35:30,717 --> 00:35:34,272
Well, then both our expertise
are going to be challenged.

668
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,475
Ducky, you know what
you're doing, right?

669
00:35:36,476 --> 00:35:38,313
Well, the fact that he's breathing does

670
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:40,778
put me somewhat out of my element.

671
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:44,641
But we don't have a choice, now, do we?

672
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:46,418
<i>What do we need?</i>

673
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:50,056
Suture materials, Metzenbaum scissors...

674
00:35:50,238 --> 00:35:51,592
Hemostats.

675
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,045
And scalpels, number ten blade.

676
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,272
All right, thank you.

677
00:35:59,843 --> 00:36:01,742
You may want to leave now.

678
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:03,847
- No.
<i>- All right.</i>

679
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:06,251
I need to make an incision

680
00:36:06,574 --> 00:36:09,615
posterior to the xiphoid cartilage.

681
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:12,504
Retracting the peritoneal fat.

682
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:14,181
<i>Oh, clip that bleeder, Mr. Palmer.</i>

683
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:15,684
<i>Here. Hurry, hurry.</i>

684
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:16,801
All right.

685
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:18,299
All right.

686
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:20,299
- Got it.
- Good, good.

687
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,521
<i>Now, pull up the inner mucosal layer.</i>

688
00:36:22,844 --> 00:36:24,065
<i>There you go.</i>

689
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:25,955
All right, let's see what we got.

690
00:36:27,737 --> 00:36:29,272
Got the little rascal.

691
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,653
Is that what I think it is?

692
00:36:36,141 --> 00:36:37,515
<i>Your Jethro</i>

693
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,789
may be the first...

694
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,879
<i>- Autopsy?</i>
- To survive a trip to the autopsy.

695
00:36:42,913 --> 00:36:43,943
Wait.

696
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:46,438
- Yes, sir, he's right here.
- We're not out of the woods yet.

697
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,731
Hold on.
Dr. Mallard, it's Agent Gibbs.

698
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,569
- Clean this off for me.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

699
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:53,080
Can you sew him up?

700
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:54,084
<i>Absolutely.</i>

701
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,931
Jethro.

702
00:36:56,335 --> 00:36:59,069
Duck, need you at Pax River Air Station.

703
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,395
I got a dead petty officer.

704
00:37:01,057 --> 00:37:04,629
Certainly, but we have
an interesting development here,

705
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:08,124
Jethro, that you will,
you will find fascinating.

706
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,529
The dog from Petty
Officer Hanson's house...

707
00:37:11,115 --> 00:37:12,795
<i>You'll never guess what he swallowed.</i>

708
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:14,284
It's the tip of a knife, Gibbs!

709
00:37:14,285 --> 00:37:17,193
<i>Yes, well,
while Hanson was definitely mauled,</i>

710
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:20,159
<i>there was a</i> puncture mark
on his collarbone that troubled me.

711
00:37:20,245 --> 00:37:22,952
I now know that that puncture
mark was made by

712
00:37:22,953 --> 00:37:25,154
<i>this knife, not a dog bite.</i>

713
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,937
It's a perfect match.

714
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,953
Wasn't just the dog that killed him.

715
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:32,937
<i>No, no, no,
no, he had a human co</i>-conspirator.

716
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:35,851
Just a minute, Jethro.

717
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
Mr. Palmer?

718
00:37:37,197 --> 00:37:41,193
The cervical vertebra from the John Doe,
the one I cleaned off, where is it?

719
00:37:41,307 --> 00:37:42,378
John Doe?

720
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,936
The dead dog, Mr. Palmer.

721
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:45,859
206.

722
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:47,859
<i>Stay with me, Jethro.</i>

723
00:37:50,446 --> 00:37:52,169
<i>Yes, as I thought.</i>

724
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:54,728
The knife point fits
perfectly into the wound

725
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:57,860
<i>on the cervical vertebrae
of the dog we unearthed yesterday.</i>

726
00:37:57,981 --> 00:38:01,737
<i>If I were a betting man</i>, I'd
say the two crimes were related, <i>Jethro.</i>

727
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,427
Yeah, Duck.

728
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,832
Yeah, that's a bet I'd take, too.

729
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:11,889
We're going back?

730
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:13,385
Whoa, boss.

731
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:16,187
Two people, one mother ship...
this will take all night.

732
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,631
Hope you brought a warm coat, DiNozzo.

733
00:38:20,918 --> 00:38:23,908
Just the flat surfaces where
you can lift the prints, Tony.

734
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:29,857
Jethro...

735
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,372
is fine.

736
00:38:32,058 --> 00:38:34,278
I'm taking up a collection for flowers.

737
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,610
Why would I give flowers
to a dog that attacked me?

738
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:41,892
Maybe because dog is man's best friend.

739
00:38:41,893 --> 00:38:44,377
Or maybe because I am a forensic

740
00:38:44,378 --> 00:38:48,168
scientist, and I could boil you from the
inside out and never leave a trace.

741
00:38:55,656 --> 00:38:56,666
<i>Thanks.</i>

742
00:38:56,727 --> 00:38:58,666
Boss, surveillance is a wash.

743
00:38:59,252 --> 00:39:00,835
I've watched all the footage.

744
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,172
<i>That is Bidwell's killer right there.</i>

745
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:05,643
The other angle's even worse.

746
00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:08,063
Killer knew the plane
was under surveillance.

747
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:10,185
Gibbs, I've been thinking.

748
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:13,902
<i>We don't know for certain</i>
that Jethro attacked Hanson.

749
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:15,808
<i>I mean, he could've
swallowed the knife tip</i>

750
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:17,525
<i>when as he was licking Hanson's wounds,</i>

751
00:39:17,526 --> 00:39:21,162
which would also account
for the blood that was all over him.

752
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:23,022
You've already thought of that.

753
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:27,770
That dog tried to rip me limb from limb.

754
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:29,644
<i>You do have that effect, McGee.</i>

755
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:32,962
Especially when you bail
on our biggest crime scene ever.

756
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,877
Got a match.

757
00:39:37,147 --> 00:39:41,144
<i>The knife tip found in Jethro came
from a Navy-issue tactical boot knife.</i>

758
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:44,592
Find out who ordered a new boot knife
from Pax River in the past 72 hours.

759
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:45,856
Already on it, boss.

760
00:39:46,523 --> 00:39:47,797
Three people.

761
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,068
One stands out.

762
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:50,939
Evidence locker, McGee.

763
00:39:51,627 --> 00:39:53,365
Get log 421.

764
00:39:57,486 --> 00:39:58,739
Petty Officer Perelli.

765
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:00,092
Yes, sir.

766
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:02,771
What's this about?

767
00:40:03,272 --> 00:40:05,918
Have you received the tactical
boot knife you requisitioned?

768
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,508
How did you know about...?

769
00:40:08,585 --> 00:40:09,635
Not yet, ma'am.

770
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:12,302
What happened to the knife
you got issued three years ago?

771
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:13,505
I lost it.

772
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:15,110
In Hanson's body.

773
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,514
You knew about our investigation.

774
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,493
You and Bidwell need
to pin it on somebody.

775
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:22,423
<i>You picked Hanson.</i>
Was it because he was suspicious of you?

776
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:24,697
You killed Hanson and
tried to frame him for it.

777
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:27,230
You set him up by using his
phone to call Galante in Panama,

778
00:40:27,231 --> 00:40:30,494
then you planted cocaine and
cash in his house for us to find.

779
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:33,722
Tried to cover your tracks by making it
look like he was killed by his own dog.

780
00:40:34,103 --> 00:40:35,578
Then you killed Bidwell.

781
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:37,093
'Cause you thought he might crack.

782
00:40:37,315 --> 00:40:38,975
I'm no lawyer,

783
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:42,187
but this sounds like an awful
lot of conjecture to me,

784
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:43,359
sir.

785
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:46,756
Your whole case is me
requisitioning a boot knife.

786
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,211
You really think that's
going to hold up in court?

787
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:51,195
Nah.

788
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:53,067
Neither do I.

789
00:40:54,504 --> 00:40:55,817
You got a warrant?

790
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:56,937
In my pocket.

791
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:58,369
<i>Seek!</i>

792
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,370
<i>Seek.</i>

793
00:41:02,787 --> 00:41:04,734
You still got that magic, McGee.

794
00:41:04,948 --> 00:41:06,602
Heel. Good dog.

795
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:13,895
Evidence log number 421, cocaine.

796
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,193
Your dog don't hunt.

797
00:41:26,174 --> 00:41:27,277
Up, boy.

798
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:30,610
You killed the drug-sniffing
dog and replaced him with an attack dog.

799
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:32,903
'Cause you needed a dog
that wouldn't react to cocaine.

800
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,569
You're under arrest

801
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,458
for the murders of Petty Officer Hanson
and Petty Officer Bidwell.

802
00:41:44,574 --> 00:41:47,382
You just seem to attract
all the sick puppies, Timothy.

803
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,820
Hey, Abs.

804
00:41:55,128 --> 00:41:56,128
Hey.

805
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:58,065
What's wrong?

806
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:01,839
Gibbs asked the base commander
if I could keep Jethro.

807
00:42:03,661 --> 00:42:04,740
He said no?

808
00:42:05,298 --> 00:42:06,425
He said yes.

809
00:42:07,156 --> 00:42:08,934
<i>Then... </i>why are you...?

810
00:42:08,954 --> 00:42:10,591
My landlord said no.

811
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:14,452
Well, that's too bad.

812
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:17,320
I have to find Jethro a good home.

813
00:42:18,798 --> 00:42:20,676
He's a distinguished veteran.

814
00:42:28,262 --> 00:42:30,018
He deserves to be happy, McGee.

815
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:32,868
Abby, no, no.

816
00:42:32,962 --> 00:42:35,002
- No.
- You have been looking for a dog.

817
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:38,435
That dog tasted my blood
and I think he liked it.

818
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,849
Okay.

819
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:43,343
Sometimes you have to look
at the reality in front of you,

820
00:42:43,485 --> 00:42:44,939
and just accept it.

821
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:46,394
You...

822
00:42:46,778 --> 00:42:49,020
are taking Jethro.

823
00:42:49,929 --> 00:42:51,226
<i>Accept it.</i>

824
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,231
McGee, Jethro,

825
00:42:55,898 --> 00:42:57,433
shake.

826
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,317
<i>All right, Jethro, you're gonna have
to be the bigger man.</i>
