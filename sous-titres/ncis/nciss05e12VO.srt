00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:11,912
<i>Wash your window?</i>

3
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:15,506
<i>Go on, man, keep moving.</i>

4
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,623
<i>- Almost done.
- Go on.</i>

5
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,772
- Pusher's back.
- I'm starving like Lee Marvin, McGee.

6
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:30,162
- <i>What's taking you so long?</i>
- He's making another deal.

7
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:34,860
We're here to find out who stole navy
radar and stashed it across the street.

8
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:38,022
<i>He's not our problem, unless
he's pushing steak and cheese hoagies.</i>

9
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,086
I'm a sworn federal agent, Tony.

10
00:00:40,236 --> 00:00:42,521
I'm not gonna stand by
and watch a felony go down.

11
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,985
<i>That's a good idea.</i>
Blow our stakeout over a $50 crack sale?

12
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,038
<i>If Gibbs doesn't slap you silly, I will.</i>

13
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:49,343
You're gonna slap me?

14
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:51,547
If that's what you want, honey.

15
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:53,022
<i>Go for it, McFreaky.</i>

16
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:54,834
Goldilocks is just your type.

17
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:55,762
Bite me.

18
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:57,777
That'll be extra.

19
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:02,805
Hey!

20
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:23,499
Hey! Monitor number
two was flickering there.

21
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,746
Fixed it.

22
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,781
I think I've seen that Beemer before.

23
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:30,078
<i>Yeah, we've seen it all before, McGee.</i>

24
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:33,949
Feels like we've been stuck
here for months doing nothing.

25
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:36,837
Come on!

26
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:38,198
I said scrambled.

27
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,015
You haven't gotten a single
order right in four days.

28
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:42,401
They're eggs, eat 'em.

29
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:45,674
Well, I don't like sunny-side up.
Sunny-side up oozes.

30
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,280
They look like eyes.
They're looking at ya.

31
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:50,814
I bet your burrito's
just the way you like it.

32
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:55,434
You want your eggs scrambled?

33
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:00,876
They're scrambled.

34
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:10,189

40
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:43,398
<i>Do you think prostitutes get bored?</i>

41
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:44,691
I mean,

42
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:46,439
the same work, day in,

43
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:50,270
- day out. Day in, day out...
- Ziver.

44
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,360
<i>The storage facility?</i>

45
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:55,762
I'm sorry, Gibbs, I just get bored.

46
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,166
I hate stakeouts.

47
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:08,191
<i>Abby.</i>

48
00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:13,355
<i>Abby!</i>

49
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:14,390
Gibbs!

50
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:20,185
<i>Hey, Gibbs, I was just,</i>

51
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,235
<i>stacking specimen jars.</i>

52
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:24,691
- Haven't heard from you.
<i>- I know. I miss you, too.</i>

53
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:28,191
<i>It's so quiet around here.</i>
I had to go get my own Caf-POW.

54
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:30,110
Did you know they raised
the price 25 cents?

55
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:31,575
<i>Did you come up with anything?</i>

56
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:33,607
I guess that depends on
what you mean by "anything".

57
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:35,308
Anything. Abby, anything.

58
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,913
<i>Anything that can tell us
who rented this storage locker.</i>

59
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:39,747
Gibbs, van.

60
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:42,932
<i>McGee found a chewing gum
wrapper in the storage locker.</i>

61
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:47,150
<i>I ran fingerprints, DNA, ultraviolet.
Nothing. Nada. Zero.</i>

62
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:49,973
- Watch the hallway.
<i>- What I did get isn't much.</i>

63
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,227
<i>I got two prints off</i>
the rental agreement.

64
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:55,994
One matched the office manager.

65
00:03:56,131 --> 00:03:58,124
<i>And the other,
it's a three-point partial,</i>

66
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,621
that could our fictitious
rentee of locker 23.

67
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:02,591
<i>Abby...</i>

68
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,655
AFIS gave me 3,251 possible matches,

69
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:08,803
<i>just in the DC metropolitan area.</i>

70
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:12,399
So many men,<i> so little time.</i>

71
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:13,975
They are in our hallway.

72
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:15,679
Gibbs?

73
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:20,253
Twenty-three...

74
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:23,318
23. Locker 23 to the left.

75
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:26,846
Twenty...

76
00:04:26,997 --> 00:04:28,072
... three.

77
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:29,632
<i>Please.</i>

78
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:34,792
Keep an eye on 'em.

79
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,337
They are late.

80
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:40,421
I'm going to call DiNozzo.

81
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:44,149
They may have killed each other.

82
00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:47,542
<i>DiNozzo.</i>

83
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:49,751
- Where are you?
<i>- I just left my place.</i>

84
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:52,381
Are you kidding me?
How long will it take you to get here?

85
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,266
<i>- With luck, an hour. I don't know.</i>
- Your goose is fried.

86
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:57,196
Cooked.

87
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:01,596
And, no, it's not.

88
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,834
- Only a minute late.
- Idiot.

89
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:05,702
Where's Gibbs?

90
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:09,924
What did I miss?

91
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:12,950
Goldilocks hooked up with Papa Bear
and they found a bed that is

92
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:14,669
"just right".

93
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:16,939
Personally,
I think she could have done better.

94
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,796
What?

95
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:20,786
That Jack she is with is...
gross.

96
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:21,939
You mean John.

97
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,257
You know him?

98
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:24,880
Oh, my God.

99
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:29,657
If you care,

100
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,783
DiNozzo,
nobody came to the storage locker.

101
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:32,987
Hey, boss.

102
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:43,202
Where's McGee?

103
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,622
I wanted to talk to you about that.
<i>We finally agreed on something.</i>

104
00:05:46,673 --> 00:05:49,468
<i>We're going to commute separately,
'cause he's always whining.</i>

105
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,436
It's all he does. You know,
the air-conditioning, and this and that.

106
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:55,699
Is there any way can shuffle the deck?
<i>You know, sort of do this differently?</i>

107
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:57,675
I don't know, mix it up a little...

108
00:05:58,268 --> 00:06:00,322
Or not.
You know, we'll figure it out.

109
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:01,837
We'll work it out.

110
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,368
Sorry, boss, there was a...

111
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,053
- an accident on the Mason Bridge.
- The e-mail.

112
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:08,265
Still working on it.

113
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:11,314
It's definitely a free account
opened under a fictitious name.

114
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:12,609
Knew that two days ago.

115
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,233
Trying to track the e-mail's path,
but there's several servers.

116
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:18,136
Whoever tipped us of about the missing
radar being in this storage locker

117
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:20,071
is going to great lengths
to remain anonymous.

118
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:22,402
Pusher's back.
So is the suit in the Beemer.

119
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:28,379
Guy's dealing drugs up the street.

120
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,173
Yeah. Noticed.

121
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,211
Same buyer was here yesterday, too.
Love to bust 'em.

122
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:34,537
Record it.

123
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,945
Turn it over to Metro when we're done.

124
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:41,683
Have a nice day, McGee.

125
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:45,335
Alone at last.

126
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,542
You watch.

127
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:50,102
I'll do this,
you do that.

128
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:54,237
<i>You're a dead man, McGee.</i>

129
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:57,631
Don't look at me, raccoon boy.

130
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,873
- It was Ziva.
- Ziva.

131
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:03,710
<i>I did everything you wanted.
What do you want from me?</i>

132
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:05,346
<i>Something's going on.</i>

133
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:08,620
<i>Come on.</i>

134
00:07:26,955 --> 00:07:28,189
<i>Somebody help!</i>

135
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:29,902
Call 911, man!

136
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:32,450
Call 911!
Call the police!

137
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:34,397
<i>Come on!</i>

138
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:38,622
<i>Hey, is he dead?</i>

139
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:41,386
<i>Is he dead?
What's going on?</i>

140
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,645
<i>Driver's license and car registration
ID him as Scott Matthew Rowe.</i>

141
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:59,349
44. Home address in
the Adams Morgan district.

142
00:07:59,383 --> 00:08:00,781
It doesn't look like a robbery.

143
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:03,193
We got video of him going
into the alley with a suspect.

144
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:04,969
- Really?
- <i>Caucasian</i>,

145
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,444
<i>early 30s.</i>

146
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:07,583
Lucky break.

147
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:10,799
So NCIS just happened to be
in the neighborhood with a camera?

148
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:13,559
I'll have someone
e-mail the video to you.

149
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:16,491
Excuse me. Excuse me.
This is a restricted crime scene.

150
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:17,770
Boss?

151
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,237
<i>He's one of yours?</i>

152
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:20,287
Yeah.

153
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:23,203
Special Agent DiNozzo.
Anthony. Tony.

154
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:25,138
Detective Sparr.

155
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:31,984
Detective Sparr, what does it look like?

156
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:34,161
Classic, rich guy wants to get high,

157
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:37,169
trolls known area
to buy recreational drug.

158
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:38,266
Deal goes bad.

159
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:40,005
You think so?

160
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:42,107
You think otherwise?

161
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,614
Guy rolling around in a $90,000 car,

162
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:47,534
buying drugs in neighborhood like this,
I wouldn't turn the engine off,

163
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,260
let alone get out of the car.

164
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:52,463
Thanks for your help, Special
Agent Gibbs. Appreciate the video.

165
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:54,904
I worked narcotics,
Baltimore PD, two years.

166
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:57,574
Three, before I transferred to homicide.

167
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:01,425
- <i>Okay, what do we have?</i>
- That the murder weapon?

168
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:08,406
When did a pipe become
a drug dealer's weapon of choice?

169
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,088
Abigail!

170
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:21,952
<i>What are you doing?</i>

171
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:24,613
I'm trying to change
my spatial orientation

172
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:28,112
- and help myself get a new perspective.
- How is it working?

173
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,318
I think I'm going to be sick.
You wanted to see me?

174
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:36,619
You didn't have to make a special trip.

175
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,733
But when you regain your equilibrium,
I have a John Doe.

176
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,655
I need a CBC with platelets

177
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,324
<i>and a complete chem screen</i>

178
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,403
and CK.

179
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,240
Ducky,

180
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,441
this, John Doe
doesn't have a case number on it.

181
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:59,056
Yet to be determined.
I'll give it to you later.

182
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:06,877
My company spent the last ten
years developing that radar system.

183
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:09,062
<i>You need to release it back to us now.</i>

184
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,949
Stakeout's our best chance
to catch who was behind the theft.

185
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:14,478
- It's been two weeks.
- Since the radar was stolen.

186
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:16,427
It's only been four days
since we got the e-mail

187
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,937
tipping us off to its location.

188
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:19,956
Haven't you got something to say,
Captain?

189
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:21,709
Have you found out
who sent the e-mail?

190
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:22,910
Working on it.

191
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:25,689
Okay, I thought this nightmare
was over when the radar was found.

192
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:29,186
I should have never agreed
to let you and the navy use it as bait.

193
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:30,931
Why do you have to leave it there?

194
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:32,984
You can still arrest
whoever comes to collect it.

195
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:35,383
Covert surveillance.
Got in,

196
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:38,176
- planted the cameras, got out.
- Your point?

197
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,707
It takes time to move the radar.

198
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:44,435
We might not be the only
ones watching the locker.

199
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:50,361
<i>Know what this is, Agent Gibbs?</i>

200
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:52,075
Zumwalt class destroyer.

201
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:54,688
Stealth destroyer Agent Gibbs,
without its radar, it's useless.

202
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:57,742
I was supposed to be at that
shipyard today installing that radar.

203
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:01,425
Instead, I have to stand by
and watch you play policeman.

204
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:08,022
I'd like to help you here, Gibbs,

205
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:10,301
but that ship is due to start
sea trials next month.

206
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:14,087
It gets delayed,
SECNAV will have my ass.

207
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:16,935
They'll want a much
higher price than that.

208
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:31,582
Anthony, you scared me.

209
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:34,400
Is the stakeout over?

210
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:35,754
I wish.

211
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:38,192
It's worse than watching
a five-day cricket match.

212
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:39,865
Careful, young man.

213
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:43,240
It's late,
you've been working 12-hour shifts.

214
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:47,161
I would think you'd rather be
anywhere but here on your time off.

215
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:50,245
You must want something.

216
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,449
Well...

217
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,850
how well do you know the city ME?

218
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:56,661
Tom Hubbard? I play bridge
with him every Tuesday night.

219
00:11:56,812 --> 00:11:58,541
Excellent medical examiner.

220
00:11:58,627 --> 00:12:00,326
Dreadful bridge player.

221
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:04,319
There was a murder this morning,
down the street from the stakeout,

222
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:07,372
and I'd love to get a
look at the autopsy report.

223
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:09,687
Can't you get one
through normal channels?

224
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:13,354
I had a little difference of opinion
with the homicide detective,

225
00:12:13,402 --> 00:12:15,273
she and I didn't see eye to eye.

226
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:16,703
"She"?

227
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:20,379
Does Gibbs know you're doing this?

228
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:40,510
Tony's going to try to get even.

229
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:43,275
I know he has booby-trapped something.

230
00:12:46,748 --> 00:12:49,229
Boss, hey, got your message.
<i>What's wrong?</i>

231
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,026
I'm getting a low battery signal
from the camera in the locker.

232
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:53,811
That's odd, I used fresh batteries.

233
00:12:53,854 --> 00:12:55,682
Should be good
for at least another week.

234
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,150
Okay, I'll go see what's going on.

235
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:23,554
McGee, hallway's empty.

236
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:40,996
McGee, we haven't got all day.

237
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,407
Boss, what do you see on the monitor?

238
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,077
I see a radar system
on a shipping pallet.

239
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,464
You sure?

240
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:56,212
We're staring right at it, McGee.

241
00:13:57,892 --> 00:13:58,951
Do you see me?

242
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:02,177
"Do you see me?" No!

243
00:14:09,354 --> 00:14:10,838
Boss, we got a problem.

244
00:14:20,637 --> 00:14:23,121
Camera's working fine, boss.
I don't know why...

245
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:26,574
I would start a sentence
with "I don't know."

246
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,058
Figure it out, McGee.

247
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:29,188
Fast!

248
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,123
Yeah?

249
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:35,523
Would not want to be Gibbs right now.

250
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:37,738
I would not want to be McGee anytime.

251
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,944
We are a team.

252
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,768
<i>We need to support each other.</i>

253
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:47,701
No more practical jokes.

254
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:53,160
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

255
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:54,867
Agreed.

256
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:57,465
Agreed.

257
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,880
Détente.

258
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:09,029
This is crazy.
I'm taking pictures of an empty room.

259
00:15:09,127 --> 00:15:13,244
How did $90 million worth
of high-tech electronics just... vanish?

260
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:14,985
I saw David Blaine make an elephant

261
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:16,942
disappear once in front of hundreds
of people.

262
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,289
It's an illusion, Tony.

263
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:21,765
He's an illusionist. I can assure you
the elephant never left the building.

264
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:24,315
We have to open and check every locker.

265
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,498
We need a warrant.

266
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,939
Warrants.
One for each locker.

267
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:29,019
Or not.

268
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:30,781
I'll go lean on the manager.

269
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,942
Sorry, Special Agent Gibbs.

270
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:41,690
I was told the captain
was coming on 15 minutes ago.

271
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,618
I'm being punished, Sandi.

272
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:48,656
<i>Sorry, Gibbs.</i>

273
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,247
<i>SECNAV wouldn't let me go.</i>

274
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:53,901
<i>Wants to know whose bright idea
it was to use top secret radar as bait.</i>

275
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:56,639
That'd be Gibbs, two "B"s.

276
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:57,825
<i>Yeah, he knows.</i>

277
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:00,233
<i>Look, he's trying to track down
your director.</i>

278
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:02,245
<i>Her office says she's
out of the country.</i>

279
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:03,365
She is.

280
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,638
<i>DNI is concerned the technology
maybe in the wrong hands</i>

281
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:09,645
<i>and Chow's hysterical.
I guess I don't need to tell you that.</i>

282
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:12,231
<i>He says it'll take nine
months to remanufacture.</i>

283
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:13,801
Have the sea trials been delayed?

284
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,102
<i>Not officially,
but you've read the press releases.</i>

285
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,414
<i>The Zumwalt class multimission destroyer</i>

286
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:20,866
<i>is being touted as the
future of the blue-water navy.</i>

287
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,828
<i>SECNAV is not ready to go public,</i>

288
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:25,855
<i>especially if the technology
has been compromised.</i>

289
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:29,490
<i>I wish I could help you, Gibbs.</i>

290
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:39,465
- You got it.
- At great personal expense, I fear.

291
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:43,754
I agreed to be Tom Hubbard's bridge
partner at a tournament next month.

292
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:45,841
A weekend in hell.

293
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:50,243
- You want the high lights?
- Yes, please.

294
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:53,437
<i>Cause of death, blunt force trauma.
He was not a healthy man.</i>

295
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,216
Mr. Rowe had quadruple bypass surgery

296
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:57,962
before his 40th birthday.

297
00:16:58,214 --> 00:16:59,268
Was he an addict?

298
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,845
Most definitely.

299
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,803
He appears to have been addicted
to fatty red meats,

300
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,840
fried foods and eggs.

301
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,969
His cholesterol was 388.

302
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,421
- Drugs?
- No, not even an aspirin.

303
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:14,386
Which he should have been taking
on a daily regimen for his condition.

304
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:15,816
Thanks, Ducky, I owe you.

305
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:18,430
And one day, dear boy, I shall collect.

306
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:22,918
Cover for me.
I've got to run an errand.

307
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:25,992
Tony's playing with fire.

308
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:28,169
Yeah, that's what I told him.

309
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:31,348
Time for me to exit stage left.

310
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,819
We checked the storage
facility from bottom to top.

311
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:36,475
- The radar's not in the building.
- Where's DiNozzo?

312
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:39,361
<i>He's...</i>

313
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,488
running an errand.

314
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:46,277
Never cover for me, David.

315
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:48,388
Boss, finally managed
to trace the e-mail.

316
00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:50,206
<i>It was transmitted from a cell phone</i>

317
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:52,631
using a Wi-Fi network
in the Dupont Circle area.

318
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,609
- Who?
- I don't have a name yet,

319
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,888
but I do have the electronic
serial number of the device.

320
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,724
Cell provider's going to get back to me
with the name of the registered owner.

321
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:01,084
Bring him in.

322
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:03,705
This is the guy we've been looking for,
have you seen him?

323
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:04,793
Let's see...

324
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,613
- No.
- All right.

325
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,573
Well, you call me
if you remember anything?

326
00:18:08,724 --> 00:18:10,057
Sure. I'll call you.

327
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,212
Any good tips...
on the case?

328
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,929
You're here because
I didn't return your call.

329
00:18:18,945 --> 00:18:20,321
That would've been nice, yeah.

330
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:22,901
When in the middle of an investigation,
I don't return social calls.

331
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,406
What makes you think it was social?

332
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,320
The way you stared
at my ass the other day.

333
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,947
How do you know my interest
in your ass wasn't purely professional?

334
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:31,109
I have dealt with your type all my life.

335
00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:33,902
- Really? What is my type?
- Not my type.

336
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:35,336
Rules don't apply to you,

337
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:37,700
can't imagine a woman
wouldn't hang on your every word.

338
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,376
Have you always lacked self-esteem?

339
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,878
I've got a murder to solve.

340
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:42,876
Haven't you got a drunk sailor to find?

341
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:45,810
Try me again in a couple of months.

342
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,972
Well, you do have a nice ass, but it
wasn't a social call, it was business.

343
00:18:49,114 --> 00:18:51,135
Scott Rowe wasn't
murdered in a drug deal.

344
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,672
He wasn't a user,
there were no drugs in his system.

345
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:55,366
How do you know that?

346
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,116
Autopsy report.

347
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:58,937
I haven't seen it.

348
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,057
You went around me.

349
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:09,508
Well, if you'd let me help,
I wouldn't have to do that.

350
00:19:09,576 --> 00:19:10,435
Hey.

351
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:14,162
I have a gut feeling about this case.

352
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:15,093
Why?

353
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:18,860
- Why do I have a gut feeling?
- Why do you want to help?

354
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:21,353
Because I feel responsible.

355
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,605
I could have stopped it.
I saw what was going down,

356
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:28,040
and I thought it was just a drug deal,
just like you. And it wasn't, trust me.

357
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,526
My instincts are usually right.

358
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:35,656
You don't do anything
without telling me.

359
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:37,303
Absolutely.

360
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,564
Any leads?

361
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,557
No prints on the murder weapon.

362
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:46,228
We enhanced your video, got a
decent image of the drug dealer's face.

363
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:47,788
<i>ID'd him as Dennis Moran.</i>

364
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:51,963
Multiple arrests, most drug-related,
convicted twice. We're looking for him.

365
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:53,554
What about Scott Rowe?

366
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:55,136
<i>He's a hard guy to figure.</i>

367
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:57,648
Was a stockbroker,
lost his license, couple

368
00:19:57,768 --> 00:20:00,608
of civil lawsuits against him.
Shady deals.

369
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:04,184
Rowe's had a history of financial
ups and downs, currently down.

370
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,416
Excuse me.

371
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:09,008
Yeah? Yeah.
<i>Well, did you tell him that I...</i>

372
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:11,757
<i>Yeah.</i>

373
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:13,501
<i>Well, try it.</i>

374
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:23,571
I thought you said you found
the anonymous tipster.

375
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:24,687
I did.

376
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,526
Name's Jordyn Wright.
The e-mail was sent from her cell phone.

377
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,805
<i>Mom, how much longer
do we need to wait here?</i>

378
00:20:29,847 --> 00:20:32,466
- <i>I don't know, honey.</i>
- She couldn't get a sitter?

379
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,951
Jordyn's the girl, not the mother.

380
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:46,280
Special Agent Gibbs.

381
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:48,252
Can you please tell
me what this is about?

382
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,300
Told him I didn't send you any e-mail.

383
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:02,610
NCIS received a message from this phone.

384
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:06,053
Not from me.
Now, can I have it back, please?

385
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,828
Did you let somebody borrow it?

386
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:11,525
Not allowed to.

387
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:14,462
Where were you last Thursday night,
Jordyn,

388
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:17,265
- about 7:30?
- It was a school night. She was home.

389
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:20,402
You were in the Dupont Circle area,
weren't you?

390
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:23,041
No.

391
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,147
Okay, so I was in Rock'N Java.

392
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:32,502
- What?
- <i>See?</i>

393
00:21:32,503 --> 00:21:34,602
- Like you and Dad even noticed.
- <i>Who were you with?</i>

394
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,404
<i>You weren't with that Ramone boy,
were you?</i>

395
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:38,604
Nicky, Mom. Nicky Ramone,

396
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,633
- and he's not a boy, he's 17.
- That's exactly why you can't see him.

397
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,120
You can't choose my friends.

398
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:45,378
Mrs. Wright, deal with this later.

399
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:49,936
You let someone borrow it?

400
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,673
Some guy at the next
table couldn't get a signal.

401
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,567
He gave me ten bucks to use mine.

402
00:21:55,696 --> 00:21:57,137
Would you recognize him?

403
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,324
I guess.

404
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,732
You are supposed to be
working on our case, Tony.

405
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:05,050
Our murder victim
was a loser and a fraud.

406
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:08,673
- Not our murder victim, Tony.
- Declared bankruptcy twice.

407
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,693
Beemer leased for $1,200 a month.
He was three months behind on payments.

408
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:15,140
Does Metro Homicide
know what you are doing?

409
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,957
Detective Sparr and
I have an understanding.

410
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:19,746
I'll bet you do.

411
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,645
Detective Sparr must be hot.

412
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:22,511
Yes.

413
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,237
But no. For the moment,
it's all business.

414
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:26,762
- Business.
- Business.

415
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,333
Her name Abby. You're gonna love her.

416
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:30,801
She's gonna do a computer
sketch of this guy, okay?

417
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:32,738
Is this some kind of test?

418
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:36,395
You already know who
borrowed my cell phone.

419
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,743
Who, Jordyn?

420
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:38,831
Him.

421
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,642
Are you sure, Jordyn?

422
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:48,142
He gave me ten bucks.
I'm sure.

423
00:22:48,552 --> 00:22:49,928
Are we missing something?

424
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:53,981
Yeah, our anonymous tipster
was Scott Rowe, our dead guy.

425
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,430
McGee.

426
00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:15,980
Did you lose something?

427
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,904
Tony still has not gotten
me back for the binoculars.

428
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:25,338
I thought you two shook on it...
no more practical jokes.

429
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:29,128
Do you trust DiNozzo?

430
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:31,199
Point well taken.
Where is he?

431
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:33,458
The homicide detective
from Metro is here.

432
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,694
He's escorting her up.

433
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:38,021
Say one for me while
you're down there, McGee.

434
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,621
Working on a theory, boss.

435
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:42,649
How someone could've stolen
the radar without us seeing.

436
00:23:42,783 --> 00:23:45,018
- Yeah? Tell.
- <i>Well, I would rather show it to you,</i>

437
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:47,942
so I'm going to set up a demonstration
out in the evidence garage.

438
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:51,682
So our cases have crossed.

439
00:23:52,227 --> 00:23:55,044
Means you can tell me why NCIS
was staking out the neighborhood.

440
00:23:55,597 --> 00:23:57,539
Classified navy equipment was hijacked.

441
00:23:57,579 --> 00:23:59,611
Got an anonymous tip
it was in a storage building

442
00:23:59,675 --> 00:24:02,060
next to the alley where Rowe was killed.

443
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:03,815
Just learned Rowe was the tipster.

444
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,949
Still conducting the stakeout?

445
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:07,020
No.

446
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:08,831
No. The equipment was stolen...

447
00:24:09,974 --> 00:24:10,920
again.

448
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:13,496
- Messy.
- Ziva David.

449
00:24:15,338 --> 00:24:18,614
You dragged me up here to pull the
national security, need-to-know card?

450
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,876
That Rowe's murder
is no longer a Metro case?

451
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:22,843
No. We investigate the murder together.

452
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:24,548
The theft stays classified.

453
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,311
Do I have a choice?

454
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:27,838
No.

455
00:24:33,197 --> 00:24:34,724
Yeah. Don't ask.

456
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:37,189
Sorry. Sorry.

457
00:24:37,468 --> 00:24:39,339
What did you say your name was again?

458
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:45,955
Jardine.

459
00:24:47,638 --> 00:24:50,638
Four people in my department
have come down with the flu.

460
00:24:51,965 --> 00:24:53,320
You're in my department now.

461
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:54,743
Yes, sir.

462
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:56,166
What do you got?

463
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:57,640
It's just a little

464
00:24:58,336 --> 00:25:00,414
tickle at the back
of my throat, but it's...

465
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:07,175
I did not pick up any chatter
on the stolen dual-band radar.

466
00:25:07,444 --> 00:25:09,790
Talked with contacts at the NSA and CIA.

467
00:25:09,904 --> 00:25:10,979
They're alerted.

468
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:15,066
- Where are we going?
- Interview. Don't talk. Just listen.

469
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:17,493
Do you know him?

470
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:20,382
Scott Rowe.

471
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:22,959
Means nothing.

472
00:25:23,645 --> 00:25:24,645
Who is he?

473
00:25:24,997 --> 00:25:26,868
He's the man who tipped
us off to the radar.

474
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,855
Well, is he cooperating?

475
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:30,049
No, he's dead.

476
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,254
Murdered.

477
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:33,615
Okay, this just gets worse.

478
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:37,884
You people have lost cutting-edge,
dual-band technology.

479
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,805
In hands of a foreign government,
it would be the biggest threat

480
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:42,536
to national security
since the Cold War.

481
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:45,426
If they figure out how this thing works,
they can jam it.

482
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,869
You're the analyst.

483
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:49,771
Has Intel picked up anything?

484
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:52,417
Well, if we get a lead,
we'll let you know.

485
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,924
My company's ruined.

486
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:57,471
<i>We worked day and night to
meet that original delivery schedule.</i>

487
00:25:57,704 --> 00:25:59,639
By the time we could remanufacture...

488
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,731
we'd lose the contract.

489
00:26:16,507 --> 00:26:17,410
Hey, McGee.

490
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:18,728
Hey.

491
00:26:20,118 --> 00:26:21,660
What are you doing?

492
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:22,778
It's a model.

493
00:26:23,055 --> 00:26:24,969
That is really cool.

494
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:26,666
<i>Demonstration for Gibbs.</i>

495
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,943
<i>You know how hard it is
to explain technical stuff to him.</i>

496
00:26:28,986 --> 00:26:31,112
Yeah, good thinking.
It's like every time I try

497
00:26:31,113 --> 00:26:33,326
to explain something sciency,
and his eyes glaze over,

498
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:36,186
and he gives me that will you
shut up and get to the point look?

499
00:26:38,758 --> 00:26:40,328
He's behind me, isn't he?

500
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:42,410
No.

501
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:47,813
- Want to see a dress rehearsal?
- Can I be Gibbs?

502
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:48,701
Yes.

503
00:26:49,138 --> 00:26:51,176
Okay, boss. Boss.

504
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:52,860
This is the hallway.

505
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:54,047
<i>This is a locker.</i>

506
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,302
<i>These are our surveillance cameras.</i>

507
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,901
Now if I could direct your
attention to these monitors here.

508
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,719
These are the feed from
the surveillance cameras.

509
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,369
I'm working under the assumption

510
00:27:03,412 --> 00:27:05,697
that whoever stole the radar knew
that we were watching.

511
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:06,660
Okay.

512
00:27:06,814 --> 00:27:09,065
Using a scanner,
they found our video frequencies.

513
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:10,874
Had to be nearby, McGee?

514
00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:13,054
That is an excellent question,
boss. Yes.

515
00:27:13,118 --> 00:27:16,142
With our mini-transmitters,
they would have to be within 500 feet.

516
00:27:16,228 --> 00:27:18,823
Then they could steal
and record the video signals,

517
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:20,445
which I have already done,

518
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:24,805
<i>and play them back with these
much more powerful transmitters.</i>

519
00:27:25,124 --> 00:27:26,995
They would have overridden our signals.

520
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:28,165
Now,

521
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:32,521
they would need a
pallet jack to get the radar out.

522
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:38,305
McGee, I don't see the guy.

523
00:27:38,413 --> 00:27:41,893
That is because you are watching
the loop I made of the empty hallway,

524
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:43,723
just as we were doing

525
00:27:44,107 --> 00:27:45,269
during the stakeout.

526
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:52,088
When they were gone,

527
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:55,632
they turned off the loop in the hallway
and continued

528
00:27:55,797 --> 00:27:57,311
transmitting the second loop

529
00:27:57,866 --> 00:28:01,006
<i>showing the radar still
in the storage locker.</i>

530
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,980
McGee, this is... this is so great!

531
00:28:05,088 --> 00:28:07,109
Even Gibbs could understand this.

532
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:08,652
He does.

533
00:28:11,353 --> 00:28:12,773
Not off the hook

534
00:28:13,461 --> 00:28:15,891
until the radar is found, McGee.

535
00:28:25,381 --> 00:28:28,391
Mr. Palmer,
I thought you'd gone for the night.

536
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,848
I made it halfway home before
I realized I left my cell phone here.

537
00:28:32,574 --> 00:28:35,248
<i>What are you working on, Dr. Mallard?</i>
Anything I can help you with?

538
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:38,107
No, no, no.
It's an old case just popped into mind.

539
00:28:38,172 --> 00:28:39,633
I thought I'd check a few things.

540
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,474
I'll take that to the file room for you.

541
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:43,351
I'll take care of it.

542
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:00,554
<i>I've worked all the
usual channels. Nothing.</i>

543
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:03,605
<i>And you thought it was important
to come up here and tell me that?</i>

544
00:29:03,716 --> 00:29:05,007
Well, that's the point.

545
00:29:05,164 --> 00:29:07,730
If top-secret electronics
were out there for sale

546
00:29:07,773 --> 00:29:09,480
or in the hands of a foreign operative,

547
00:29:09,686 --> 00:29:11,418
<i>we would have picked
up something by now.</i>

548
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,921
I think the silence speaks volumes.

549
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,507
What's it's saying?

550
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:18,432
It suggests a domestic operation.

551
00:29:19,317 --> 00:29:21,053
If it's not out there for sale...

552
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,545
A competitor of Jonathan Chow's company.

553
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:25,621
Yeah. Gibbs.

554
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:33,063
Mind if I ask what that is?

555
00:29:33,342 --> 00:29:35,547
According to McGee,
he's the guy who stole the radar.

556
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:46,992
I don't know if I should
say anything or not, but

557
00:29:47,491 --> 00:29:49,640
I saw Tony putting
something under your car.

558
00:29:49,743 --> 00:29:50,584
What?

559
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:52,247
When?

560
00:29:52,638 --> 00:29:53,711
What. I don't know.

561
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,613
When this morning.

562
00:29:56,953 --> 00:29:59,646
I told you,
I told you he could not be trusted.

563
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:02,869
Was Tony really messing with her car?

564
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:05,247
No.

565
00:30:05,857 --> 00:30:08,428
Tony just told me to
tell Ziva that when I saw her.

566
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:12,876
<i>Scott Rowe's prints were
lifted postmortem by the ME.</i>

567
00:30:12,993 --> 00:30:13,818
<i>This</i>

568
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:16,791
is the unidentified partial
from the storage rental agreement.

569
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:22,526
It matches Scott Rowe's
left index finger.

570
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:23,665
Detective Sparr.

571
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:26,446
- Rowe rented the locker?
- Probably hijacked the radar.

572
00:30:26,488 --> 00:30:28,651
- <i>Right.</i>
- Then tipped us off where to find it?

573
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:29,893
Doesn't make any sense.

574
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:32,474
Our missing pusher, Dennis Moran,
he's been spotted downtown.

575
00:30:42,268 --> 00:30:43,496
Hey, thanks for the call.

576
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,620
Where is he?

577
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:46,486
Went into the hotel acting real hinky.

578
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:47,852
There's a reward, right?

579
00:30:47,853 --> 00:30:48,993
Yes. You get him.

580
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:50,537
<i>I remember you.</i>

581
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:51,663
The biter.

582
00:30:51,664 --> 00:30:53,337
You stay here.
You come with me.

583
00:30:53,338 --> 00:30:54,657
McGee, take the perimeter.

584
00:31:09,145 --> 00:31:10,861
<i>NCIS! Freeze!</i>

585
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:12,365
<i>Hey! Hold it!</i>

586
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:18,191
All right, just get away.

587
00:31:18,393 --> 00:31:19,393
Get away, okay?

588
00:31:19,972 --> 00:31:21,926
Federal agents.
We just want to talk, Dennis.

589
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:24,294
No.

590
00:31:24,368 --> 00:31:26,182
I'm not going back to prison.

591
00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:29,006
- We just want to talk.
- No, no.

592
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:30,992
You. No, you think I kill...
I killed that guy.

593
00:31:30,993 --> 00:31:31,993
I didn't, okay?

594
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,230
<i>I didn't.</i>

595
00:31:33,616 --> 00:31:34,774
Then why did you run?

596
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:37,388
I'm on probation.

597
00:31:37,723 --> 00:31:40,109
<i>I get convicted again, and it's over.</i>

598
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,634
It's not gonna happen.

599
00:31:51,853 --> 00:31:53,042
<i>It's not gonna happen.</i>

600
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:56,276
Dennis, you don't want to do this.

601
00:31:57,852 --> 00:31:59,778
<i>Don't make us do this Dennis.</i>

602
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:01,059
<i>Put the gun down!</i>

603
00:32:07,888 --> 00:32:09,297
God, stop it!

604
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:11,390
I didn't kill anybody.

605
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:12,688
I swear I didn't.

606
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:15,827
I didn't kill anybody, I swear.

607
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:20,813
I swear I didn't do it.

608
00:32:32,427 --> 00:32:33,838
What were you doing with Rowe?

609
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:35,511
Who?

610
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:36,836
Dead guy in the alley.

611
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:40,750
I told you I didn't kill him

612
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,801
You want me to start believing you,

613
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:47,197
you better start remembering things.

614
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,477
I'm. I'm. I'm trying.

615
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:52,282
Gibbs always throw softballs?

616
00:32:52,575 --> 00:32:55,195
I've seen him make a 300 pound
drill instructor cry.

617
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:57,037
<i>How long did you know him?</i>

618
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:58,177
<i>I didn't.</i>

619
00:32:58,796 --> 00:33:00,588
The guy showed up a couple days ago.

620
00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:02,566
Paid me two bills to watch a building.

621
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:03,878
Storage facility.

622
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:04,885
Yeah.

623
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,927
He told me, he gave me a number

624
00:33:07,928 --> 00:33:09,489
to call him when the feds came.

625
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:12,951
They came for what?

626
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:15,068
I don't know.

627
00:33:15,197 --> 00:33:17,039
He was... he was crazy.

628
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:20,345
Said the place was going to get raided.
I never saw nothing.

629
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:22,468
Who hit him with the pipe?

630
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:28,414
<i>I don't know, I don't know who killed...
who hit him.</i>

631
00:33:28,982 --> 00:33:29,982
<i>You were there.</i>

632
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,521
I was loaded, man.

633
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,899
The BMW dude was hassling me...

634
00:33:40,276 --> 00:33:43,359
for not calling.
We went into the alley.

635
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:46,238
That other guy was there.

636
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:47,425
He saw him...

637
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:50,758
Went crazy. Picked up the pipe
and started hitting him.

638
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:52,390
You know, I got the hell out.

639
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:54,575
Can you describe the other guy?

640
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,788
I was so whacked, man.

641
00:34:01,992 --> 00:34:04,002
He couldn't pick his
own mother out of a line up.

642
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,273
You believe this junkie?

643
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,505
He had a gun.
Why use a pipe?

644
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,216
Escort him back down
to sick bay lock up.

645
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:15,347
I have a better idea.

646
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,046
I take him downtown.

647
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:19,887
Civilian vic,
civilian suspect on a Metro street.

648
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:21,303
Not yet.

649
00:34:21,304 --> 00:34:22,255
Why?

650
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:24,633
National Security?

651
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,110
Works for me.

652
00:34:31,631 --> 00:34:32,631
Great. Lunch.

653
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:34,282
I'm starving!

654
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:36,763
Nikki, there's an extra
burger in there if you want one.

655
00:34:36,794 --> 00:34:37,668
No, thanks.

656
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:39,453
I don't eat food prepared by others.

657
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,155
Of course you don't.

658
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:43,050
- Did you come up with anything?
- Nothing.

659
00:34:43,051 --> 00:34:44,051
No connection.

660
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:45,490
By the way, who do I owe?

661
00:34:49,477 --> 00:34:50,477
Where is he?

662
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:51,835
Interrogation.

663
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:57,249
Does he think I'm that stupid?

664
00:34:58,277 --> 00:34:59,277
Come on.

665
00:34:59,328 --> 00:35:01,926
Would Tony really do
something to your food?

666
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:02,767
Yeah.

667
00:35:05,051 --> 00:35:08,204
<i>We went through Scott Rowe's
bank statements and brokerage accounts.</i>

668
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:12,064
He sold 50,000 shares of IRT,
Jonathan Chow's company, short.

669
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:13,689
He was betting the stock would fall.

670
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,234
- Why?
- Don't know.

671
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:16,616
Settlement date's this Friday.

672
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:19,402
Hard to make a killing
on the market when you're dead.

673
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,243
Insider information.

674
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:25,095
We're checking for a connection
between Rowe, Chow or anyone at IRT.

675
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,868
SECNAV wants a briefing.

676
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:31,038
You stay on it.

677
00:35:36,663 --> 00:35:38,967
It could have been anyone
who knew about the theft.

678
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:40,455
Including Captain Pullman.

679
00:35:47,823 --> 00:35:49,033
You ready, Dr. Mallard?

680
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:51,493
As ready as I ever will be.

681
00:35:52,386 --> 00:35:55,148
We have put this bloody
business off long enough.

682
00:35:55,274 --> 00:35:57,603
They don't prepare you
for all this in medical school.

683
00:35:57,604 --> 00:35:59,139
Yeah, well, let's get it over with.

684
00:35:59,823 --> 00:36:01,510
Where shall we start?

685
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:05,083
Latex gloves?

686
00:36:06,045 --> 00:36:08,526
Good Lord.
Do we really get through that many?

687
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:10,159
Requisition forms.

688
00:36:10,675 --> 00:36:11,777
I did mine last week.

689
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:12,875
Don't gloat.

690
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:14,466
Okay. All business.

691
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:16,681
I got the blood work
you wanted on the John Doe.

692
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,816
The white blood cell count
was normal, but

693
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,481
there was a high level
of the enzyme creatine kinase.

694
00:36:24,286 --> 00:36:26,631
I didn't realize how late it was.

695
00:36:27,273 --> 00:36:30,147
Let's put all that off until tomorrow,
Mr. Palmer,

696
00:36:30,217 --> 00:36:31,807
when we're both fresh.

697
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:33,440
I guess one more day won't matter.

698
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:35,302
Yes, well, thank you, Abigail.

699
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:37,507
I'll see you in the morning.

700
00:36:40,995 --> 00:36:42,697
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

701
00:36:42,976 --> 00:36:45,038
He asked me to run
blood tests on a John Doe.

702
00:36:46,962 --> 00:36:48,734
We don't have any John Does.

703
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:57,974
No.

704
00:36:58,221 --> 00:36:59,644
Sleep through your alarm?

705
00:36:59,645 --> 00:37:01,528
I wish. Morning, Boss.

706
00:37:01,904 --> 00:37:02,993
<i>Morning, McProbious.</i>

707
00:37:03,718 --> 00:37:05,218
Well, we got the dirt on Rowe.

708
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:07,255
Whoever killed him might
have done him a favor.

709
00:37:07,265 --> 00:37:09,655
He was going to file for bankruptcy.
We met with his attorney.

710
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:12,725
Also interviewed the broker
who placed the short sale of IRT stock.

711
00:37:12,726 --> 00:37:15,653
- Says he tried to talk Rowe out of it.
- Pretty sure the broker's clean.

712
00:37:15,665 --> 00:37:18,326
We caught him off guard,
jogging at Rock Creek Park.

713
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:20,137
At 6:15 this morning.

714
00:37:20,302 --> 00:37:21,547
It was good old-fashioned

715
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:23,807
legwork, Ziva, it usually solves crimes.

716
00:37:24,016 --> 00:37:26,275
Well, sometimes computers do help, Tony.

717
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:29,150
I wrote a program to
cross-check credit card charges,

718
00:37:29,303 --> 00:37:33,153
ran Scott Rowe's against
corporate cards issued to IRT execs,

719
00:37:33,154 --> 00:37:36,431
limited my search parameters to the
last six months under the assumption...

720
00:37:37,023 --> 00:37:37,882
Sorry, boss.

721
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:38,915
Just got a hit.

722
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,291
<i>Five weeks ago, Scott Rowe's and
Jonathan Chow's credit cards were swiped</i>

723
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,998
at the same Georgetown
bar within minutes of each other.

724
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:48,910
<i>Both were also waited
on by the same server.</i>

725
00:37:48,994 --> 00:37:50,905
Suggests they sat next to each other.

726
00:37:50,906 --> 00:37:52,175
Maybe that's how they met.

727
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:54,802
It's like the Hitchcock classic,
Strangers on a Train.

728
00:37:54,812 --> 00:37:58,466
Two men, don't know each other, meet
by chance to hatch a nefarious crime.

729
00:37:58,713 --> 00:38:01,142
Chow's a Caltech graduate.
It would have been a piece of cake

730
00:38:01,143 --> 00:38:03,070
for him to block and
override our signal.

731
00:38:03,071 --> 00:38:04,717
Chow denied knowing Rowe.

732
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:06,294
Rowe's dead.
He can't talk.

733
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:08,344
The fact that two guys had a drink

734
00:38:08,345 --> 00:38:10,671
at a bar at the same time
doesn't really prove anything.

735
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,206
Get Moran in here.

736
00:38:12,778 --> 00:38:14,117
He couldn't ID anybody.

737
00:38:14,118 --> 00:38:16,563
And even if he did,
he's not a reliable witness.

738
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:18,430
Agreed.

739
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:42,952
You the guy that called me?

740
00:38:43,915 --> 00:38:44,934
Sit down.

741
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,223
You were kind of cryptic on the phone.

742
00:38:50,884 --> 00:38:51,958
Sit down.

743
00:38:52,307 --> 00:38:54,609
I don't think you
want me talking too loud.

744
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,191
I think you're mistaking me
for someone else.

745
00:38:57,261 --> 00:38:58,838
I know exactly who you are.

746
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:02,424
I saw you hit Rowe with a pipe.

747
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:06,485
What are you talking about?

748
00:39:08,508 --> 00:39:09,626
Told me he...

749
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,773
met you here five weeks ago.

750
00:39:16,427 --> 00:39:17,427
What do you want?

751
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:19,622
How much is the question.

752
00:39:21,757 --> 00:39:22,776
Sit down.

753
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,401
I know about your arrangement.

754
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,624
How much do you want?

755
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,389
50 thou.

756
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:49,261
How do I know you're not going
to double-cross me like Rowe did?

757
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,543
Is that why you killed him?

758
00:39:55,512 --> 00:39:56,517
It's going to...

759
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,852
it's going to take me a little
while to come up with the money.

760
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:02,768
Got till tomorrow.

761
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:23,571
You got a lot of explaining to do.

762
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,831
Too bad you couldn't
block this transmission.

763
00:40:30,356 --> 00:40:31,493
<i>He's all yours.</i>

764
00:40:31,494 --> 00:40:33,580
You're under arrest for
the murder of Scott Rowe.

765
00:40:35,575 --> 00:40:37,174
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

766
00:40:37,175 --> 00:40:41,114
<i>Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.</i>

767
00:40:41,115 --> 00:40:43,515
You think this will
help me out with the judge?

768
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:45,945
I think you did great.

769
00:40:47,221 --> 00:40:49,970
<i>Jonathan Chow had his
own radar system stolen?</i>

770
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:52,682
Why?

771
00:40:52,775 --> 00:40:53,835
It didn't work.

772
00:40:53,845 --> 00:40:56,756
There was a fatal glitch in
the software that controlled the radar.

773
00:40:56,766 --> 00:40:59,291
As a result,
the programming for all the integrated,

774
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:02,152
<i>multifunction peripheral
components had to be rewritten.</i>

775
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:03,804
It would have taken mon...

776
00:41:04,454 --> 00:41:05,454
months.

777
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:07,249
<i>Where's the radar now?</i>

778
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,250
<i>Back of a truck.</i>

779
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:10,803
Chow left it in long-term
parking at Reagan National.

780
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:14,217
<i>Well, I guess it's not going to do
the navy much good if it doesn't work.</i>

781
00:41:16,146 --> 00:41:17,061
Nope.

782
00:41:17,062 --> 00:41:19,446
Rowe would have made a fortune on
the stock market when the navy

783
00:41:19,447 --> 00:41:21,103
discovered the radar didn't work.

784
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:23,724
A whole lot more than Chow paid
him to steal it in the first place.

785
00:41:23,725 --> 00:41:25,177
Rowe tips us off,

786
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:28,149
Chow freaks,
steals the radar back, kills Rowe.

787
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:29,545
Not our finest moment.

788
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:33,159
If I never go on stakeout
again it will be too soon.

789
00:41:47,854 --> 00:41:48,870
Should I prep now?

790
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:50,186
No time like the present.

791
00:41:51,555 --> 00:41:52,685
I'll get changed.

792
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:56,902
A new arrival.

793
00:41:57,045 --> 00:41:58,464
Two-pack-a-day gunny.

794
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,613
Died of a suspected
heart attack last night.

795
00:42:01,325 --> 00:42:02,929
They're not all murders.

796
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,344
Hey, Palmer.

797
00:42:05,345 --> 00:42:06,536
Abby's looking for you.

798
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:07,733
I just left her.

799
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:12,099
I will go see her again.

800
00:42:18,825 --> 00:42:19,870
Is something wrong?

801
00:42:21,056 --> 00:42:22,675
Well, you tell me.

802
00:42:23,498 --> 00:42:24,474
I thought

803
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,149
we didn't keep secrets from each other.

804
00:42:26,414 --> 00:42:28,102
You're referring

805
00:42:28,103 --> 00:42:29,298
to the blood tests

806
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:32,340
I asked Abby to run
on the nonexistent John Doe.

807
00:42:32,927 --> 00:42:34,487
And so I shouldn't be surprised.

808
00:42:34,488 --> 00:42:36,023
She goes to you with everything.

809
00:42:36,235 --> 00:42:38,235
She cares about you and she's worried.

810
00:42:38,794 --> 00:42:39,794
About me?

811
00:42:40,165 --> 00:42:41,947
You were running the tests on yourself.

812
00:42:42,163 --> 00:42:44,947
No, I am not self-diagnosing.

813
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,673
You know, Abby allows her
emotions to cloud her judgment.

814
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:50,576
She jumps to a conclusion.

815
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:52,432
<i>No, I'm in excellent health</i>

816
00:42:52,473 --> 00:42:53,604
for a man of my age.

817
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:55,373
And if she'd bothered to check further,

818
00:42:55,374 --> 00:42:57,313
she'd have realized
it's not my blood type.

819
00:42:58,385 --> 00:42:59,329
Who?

820
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:07,707
You're putting me in a
very difficult position, Jethro.

821
00:43:09,613 --> 00:43:12,934
I can't think of anybody you'd
stick your neck out like that for.

822
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:18,525
Except...

823
00:43:19,476 --> 00:43:20,755
Director Shepard.

824
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,047
Jenny?

825
