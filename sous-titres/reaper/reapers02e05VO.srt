00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,374
- What's all the mystery, Sammy?
- I just need to talk to you in private.

2
00:00:03,457 --> 00:00:05,177
All right, fine.
We're alone. Give it up.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,219
No, in the car,
where no one can hear us.

4
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:09,724
You know what? If this is about your
weird little man crush on me,

5
00:00:09,807 --> 00:00:12,303
- don't worry about it. We all know.
- Get in.

6
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:13,393
Fine.

7
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:18,717
Dude, it's freezing in here.
What the hell, man?

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,161
Yeah, that sound was my nipples
crystallizing into diamonds on my chest.

9
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:24,356
- Hi, Sock.
- What, god! Oh, Sam!

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,526
- Dead dad!
- Take it easy it's OK. It's OK.

11
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,571
Calm down. Calm down.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,199
Mr. O?
What the hell, Sam?

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,454
- Your dad's alive?
- Well, sort of.

14
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:43,030
- What do you mean sort of?
- Technically speaking, I'm not dead,

15
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:47,426
- but I'm just not so much alive either.
- What? Why?

16
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:51,531
Well, I made that deal with the devil so
I wouldn't die, and now I Kinda can't.

17
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:54,673
That's why we had to keep the air cold.

18
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:56,779
- Right.
- It's to keep dad fresh.

19
00:00:56,862 --> 00:00:58,438
Frigid. Yeah. OK.

20
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:03,032
Mr. Oliver, i'm really, really glad
that you're alive and everything, but...

21
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:06,113
I just about had a heart attack.
I think I might still be having one.

22
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:08,234
Sam, why the hell would
you ever do that to me?!

23
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:10,193
Because I knew you'd wanna be here.

24
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:13,462
- Why? What for?
- When Ben's shift ends.

25
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:19,465
Oh, my god. This is brilliant. OK, good.
Hey, get down. Go. Get down. Get down.

26
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:22,580
Hey, remember, say...
this time, all right? OK.

27
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:25,462
Hola. Benjamin.

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,003
- Let's go for a ride, man.
- No, thanks.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,004
I mean,
today was a really stressful day.

30
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:33,544
I was at the returns counter,
and people were yelling at me.

31
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:37,428
I just wanna go home, slip into a warm
bath, just forget today ever happened.

32
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,582
All right. Well, we were gonna hit
Anderson's ice cream shop,

33
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:44,525
get a little snowblast, extra oreo
crumble, but, whatever. No big deal.

34
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:47,433
Actually that sounds
really relaxing, too.

35
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:50,255
- All right, I'm in.
- Let's do it.

- Stop. Look. Listen.

40
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:29,426
Listen to the hotness.

41
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,124
You know, Kristen is actually a pretty
cool person and fun to be around.

42
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:44,985
If you stopped sexualizing your sister
all the time, you might realize that.

43
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:46,749
You know what? It's like you're talking.

44
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:49,627
I can hear the stupid words fallin'out
of your mouth, but they hold no meaning.

45
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,912
Take me and Nina.

46
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:54,231
We're friends,
but we have our sexual side.

47
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,764
But then we keep it in a box
and take it out when we need it.

48
00:02:57,851 --> 00:02:59,549
We enjoy it.
We play with it.

49
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:01,742
We put it back in the box
when we're all done.

50
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:04,878
There is no box that can
contain this sexuality, Ben.

51
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,405
All right? Uncontainable.
It's how I was born.

52
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:11,294
In fact, the delivery room doctor said I
was the sexiest baby she'd ever seen,

53
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,875
- so...
- Fine. Your loss then.

54
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:39,507
These things are great.
Bumper cars with deadly sharp blades.

55
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,078
- Will you stop that?
- All right, grumpy.

56
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:47,959
Here's the vessel for your next soul,
Tracy reed.

57
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,643
Thought she was a vampire
when she was alive.

58
00:03:51,074 --> 00:03:52,438
Seriously, she was a vampire?

59
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,554
Well, you do know that vampires
don't really exist, don't you, Sam?

60
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:59,222
She's just a murderer
who liked to drink people's blood.

61
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:01,967
Lookin' sharp, Buffy. Lookin' sharp.

62
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:04,508
All right.
Anything else?

63
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,245
Hey, you're bein'extra snotty today,
aren't you?

64
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:10,570
This couldn't have something
to do with a certain reappearance of a

65
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:13,810
decaying,
Frankly gross father figure, could it?

66
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:17,886
You know, you can joke all you want,
but I feel kind of bad for him.

67
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:19,043
You feel bad?

68
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,277
Why should you feel
anything for that guy?

69
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,936
Don't you recall? He's the architect
of your situation here.

70
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:28,795
He sold your soul.
And you feel bad?

71
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:30,356
Sorta.

72
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,306
Well, then I feel I have to impart
some fatherly advice to you,

73
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:34,981
ironic as that may seem.

74
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,683
Don't let people walk
all over you, buddy.

75
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,537
Screw that guy.

76
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,067
He had no problem screwing you.

77
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:56,866
This is it.
Vampire soul lives here.

78
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,369
You had to wear the squeaky ones.

79
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:07,181
They look good with these pants.
What do you want me to do? They do.

80
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:08,553
It's just it's not subtle.

81
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:11,372
It's like you're announcing to the evil
souls that we here is all I'm saying.

82
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:14,687
You know what, Sam? I risk my neck
for you on a daily basis, all right?

83
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:17,941
If I'm gonna die, i'm gonna die
lookin'tasty in a fashionable

84
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:19,574
principles. Get some.

85
00:05:24,254 --> 00:05:25,481
It's so emo in here.

86
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:27,152
I love it.

87
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:33,325
You can't have it.

88
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:35,288
You're not taking it from me.

89
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:37,001
We're not here to Rob you.

90
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:39,420
Yeah, we're just here to
send you back to hell.

91
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,984
I'll kill you.
You can't touch it!

92
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,927
Oh, god! Oh, god, Sam!

93
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:05,071
Vampire on my back, Sam!

94
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:12,478
All right. Yes.
That wasn't too bad, actually.

95
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:13,924
Totally.

96
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,299
- Baby rattle.
- Yeah, and there's a carriage.

97
00:06:20,937 --> 00:06:23,163
"Pregnancy, birth, and baby."

98
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,664
That's a baby, right?

99
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,544
- That's a baby.
- We've got a baby.

100
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:53,437
Next.

101
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:55,830
Hey, there, Glady-cakes.

102
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,098
- Place the vess.
- Way ahead of you.

103
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,188
We were wondering what to do with this.

104
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,283
The soul in the vessel, it's hers.

105
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:11,290
- An iboh.
- What's an iboh?

106
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,162
Intentional birth out of hell.
It happens.

107
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:16,877
Souls have been known to escape from
hell to have their children here.

108
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,042
Better schools.

109
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,399
OK, great. So this has
happened before then. Perfect.

110
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,855
We were wondering if there was,
like, a procedure in place

111
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:26,624
- that can handle these circumstances.
- Yeah, there is.

112
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:28,256
Have fun raising it.

113
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:31,532
No. We can't raise the baby.

114
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:34,827
Any idiot can raise a baby,
which makes you more than qualified.

115
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,611
No. What if this one's evil, Gladys?
Its mom had fangs.

116
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:40,144
Nobody's gonna wanna
breast-feed a fang baby. Yeah.

117
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:44,053
I think you're OK.

118
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:47,637
- It's probably just a regular baby.
- Probably?

119
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,662
Yeah, but if you're worried, I can stuff
it down the return chute if you want.

120
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:54,701
I'm a little worried, yeah.

121
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:57,054
Why don't you just ask
your little girlfriend for some help?

122
00:07:57,137 --> 00:07:59,185
She dates you.
She must know a lot about babies.

123
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,970
She happens to have an important
job that she's busy with right now,

124
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:05,441
unlike you and your stupid stupidness.

125
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:11,990
Next.

126
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:19,168
There is an envelope
for you up at the front.

127
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,207
You took down all
my motivational posters.

128
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:25,545
Guess your want your employees
to only soar to regular heights.

129
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:27,732
- Envelope, Ted.
- Yes, you may.

130
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:28,822
Thank you.

131
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:39,057
That's sweet.

132
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:41,636
Sam taking you out on the town?

133
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,512
- Yeah. We're a little stressed lately.
- Stressed?

134
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:49,029
Maybe it's not Sam.
Maybe it's the job.

135
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:51,385
You know what they say.

136
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:54,261
This job makes a man go insane,
especially if that man is a woman.

137
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:56,162
- Get out, Ted.
- Thank you, boss.

138
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:00,760
We got a clean-up in aisle 3.

139
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:08,126
I don't think we're gonna learn anything
about taking care of a baby from

140
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:09,484
honey, I blew up the kid.

141
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,259
Just wait until the kid's done on the
rampage. We'll learn plenty. Trust me.

142
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:18,636
- What are we gonna do with it?
- Why don't you know?

143
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,758
I mean, you're the one with
those little rabbits

144
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:23,404
and birdies and small creatures, I mean,

145
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:25,151
this is your wheelhouse, buddy. Step up.

146
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:26,428
Yeah, man. Come on.

147
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:30,526
It's probably hungry.
We need mother's milk.

148
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:33,014
Well, sorry.
I'm not lactating right now.

149
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:35,487
Where do we find someone
with fleshy milk dispensers?

150
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,325
A baby?

151
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:38,816
Where did you get a baby?

152
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,579
A friend.
We're borrowing it from a friend.

153
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:44,259
- "Borrowing it"?
- Looks like a little doll.

154
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,992
- Can I hold it?
- Sure.

155
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,102
Hi, little baby.

156
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,256
Oh, my god.
I'm so jealous of that baby right now.

157
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:56,677
I wish I was cradled to her bosoms,
cradled like a baby.

158
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,957
Can I talk to you for a second?
Excuse us.

159
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:07,105
- Did you hear yourself just now?
- What happened?

160
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,209
You were looking at
a little infant nuzzling

161
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,514
against your stepsister's breasts,
and you said you were jealous of it.

162
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,356
I said that out loud?

163
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:17,066
- Oh, my god.
- You're sick, and you need help.

164
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:20,825
Benjy. I'm dyin'over here, man. What do
I do? How do I make this sexual...

165
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:22,036
tension disappear?

166
00:10:23,652 --> 00:10:25,623
You, Nina and i, we play racquetball.

167
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:28,671
It's a great way to
release the aggression.

168
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,353
It sounds like a lot of work.

169
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:34,459
All right, well, there's also,
you know, drugs that people take

170
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:37,676
to lower testosterone
and help dull the sex drive.

171
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,264
- Isn't that chemical castration?
- You don't need to name it.

172
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:43,985
You just need a solution
to your sick problem.

173
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:46,630
I hate it when you
call me sick like that.

174
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:47,771
Well, deal with it.

175
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:50,020
Right. OK, all right,
here are my options, right?

176
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:52,169
I medicate my boys into submission...

177
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:54,652
Or I work out for 15 minutes a day?

178
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:56,152
As far as I can see it.

179
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:06,904
Terrycloth wristbands are for fashion,
Benjamin, not for exercise.

180
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:09,295
Chemical castration it is.

181
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:11,568
Good. Let's go.

182
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,424
OK, now do a monkey. Do a monkey.

183
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:33,859
More monkey. Monkier.

184
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,028
Sam, you are here.

185
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:40,498
- Hey, guys, look who it is.
- Look who's back in town!

186
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:43,690
I'm back. I'm back.
You can't live in fear forever.

187
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,655
Plus, I came to warn you.

188
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:49,123
I think they're dispatching some
demon assassins to kill you.

189
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,060
We know. Ben's dating one of them.

190
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:53,090
Yeah, we're a power couple.

191
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:57,976
You what is that? Is that do you...
Do you guys have a baby?

192
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:02,437
Hey, look at you.

193
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:07,615
There we go. It's OK.
There you go.

194
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,301
Yeah, aren't you just a bundle
of cuteness? Yes, you are.

195
00:12:13,554 --> 00:12:15,650
- Is it a girl?
- Probably.

196
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,449
I don't know.
We didn't even check.

197
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:22,782
You haven't changed a diaper?
For how long?

198
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,815
Have you burped her? Have you fed her?
Have you cleaned her?

199
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:27,870
Guys, this is a precious
and delicate little gift.

200
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,501
You can't treat it like a turtle you got
at a market and forget about it.

201
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,251
Do you want it?

202
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:43,417
She's beautiful.

203
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:46,972
You know, steve and I were
on an adoption waiting list.

204
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,586
When he passed away, just another one
of those dreams that I had to let go of.

205
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,275
Well, now's the moment, tone.

206
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:57,581
You gotta seize the dream.
Seize it right out of our hands.

207
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:02,020
Maybe there's a reason
I came here today.

208
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:04,434
Maybe I was meant to come.

209
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:06,651
Maybe it was fate.

210
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:09,036
I can't think of a better
person to take care of her.

211
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,080
Yeah. You're gonna be a great dad.

212
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:20,349
I'm a daddy.

213
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:22,591
- Congrats, papa Tony.
- All right.

214
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,973
And Stevie.

215
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:26,387
After Steve, I'm gonna call her Stevie.

216
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,835
I already named her Magnum P.I.

217
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:32,554
Little Stevie.

218
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:43,222
- Hi. Are you open?
- Are you Miss Prendergast?

219
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:45,867
Your table's right this way.

220
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:53,930
You came.
That's great.

221
00:13:57,328 --> 00:14:00,248
- I came to meet Sam.
- I didn't invite Sam.

222
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:02,793
No. Apparently you didn't invite anyone.

223
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:05,801
Did you just rent out
this whole place for us?

224
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:10,540
- It's Kinda my thing, you know?
- This is "your thing"?

225
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:12,339
Date ambush?

226
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,186
You've gotta be kidding me.

227
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,609
Don't go. Look,
you don't have to feel uncomfortable.

228
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:20,670
I brought you a nicer dress. You could
change, maybe even put your hair up.

229
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:24,105
No, let me just make one thing
clear here, OK? I am with Sam,

230
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:26,241
period.

231
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,940
My misunder standing. I didn't realize
you guys were in it for the long haul.

232
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,084
We are.

233
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:33,960
Not gonna lie.
It's pretty bush-league on your part.

234
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:36,391
I mean, I did go through all
the effort to set this up.

235
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:38,410
But you know,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

236
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:39,704
You're such an ass.

237
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:42,324
OK, but if Sam wasn't in the picture,
you'd stay for dinner, right?

238
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,101
- Not a chance.
- Why?

239
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:50,763
You're obnoxious,
you're arrogant, and you're rude.

240
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:53,251
And your father is the devil.

241
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:57,311
- I didn't think that mattered to you.
- Really? And why would you think that?

242
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,003
Given your current relationship,
why wouldn't I think that?

243
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:02,687
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Since Sam and I have the same father,

244
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,045
I just figured you'd accepted Satan
in your life.

245
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,750
Yeah, you know that Sam
is the son of the devil.

246
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:17,410
Did I just speak out of turn?
I assumed you knew.

247
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,613
Looks like both of
our nights are ruined now.

248
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:24,214
Sorry.

249
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:49,431
- When's your doctor's appointment?
- Noon today.

250
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:54,442
Just takin' the dog
out for one last walk.

251
00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:55,805
That's gross.

252
00:15:56,774 --> 00:15:57,880
It's for the best.

253
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,762
Did you hear that?

254
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:10,638
He's back.

255
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:12,878
- I'll take care of it.
- Do it.

256
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,556
Dad!

257
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:17,135
What are you doin'?

258
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:22,868
I just thought I'd stop by
and set up the badminton net

259
00:16:22,955 --> 00:16:25,107
and bang the old shuttlecock
around with you.

260
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,684
I don't really have time now.

261
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:30,109
Well, maybe tomorrow then.

262
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:32,331
- Yeah. I'll try.
- Good, 'cause, you know, Sam, I...

263
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:35,314
I really make the effort to
spend some more time together.

264
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:40,136
This bein' undead, it, kind of frees me
up from everyday obligations, you know.

265
00:16:40,904 --> 00:16:44,710
Don't have to work. Don't have to eat.
But, hey, lots of free time.

266
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:48,422
- Come one game. Come on.
- Dad, I really. I have to go to work.

267
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,031
- OK. Well, that's too bad.
- Maybe next time, call ahead.

268
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:56,128
Call ahead. Great idea.
I will do that, Sam!

269
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:05,644
Sam, anything you wanna tell me?
Any little details that

270
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:08,108
might be important for me to understand
while I'm dating you?

271
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:11,589
I'm... allergic to tree nuts.

272
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:13,644
Any other nuggets
of info you wanna share?

273
00:17:14,142 --> 00:17:15,721
- Like what?
- I don't know.

274
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:18,035
Like maybe Satan is your real father?

275
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:22,079
I was gonna tell you.
I was planning on telling you.

276
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:23,523
- When?
- Andi, I...

277
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:26,851
Who told you? Was it Ben?
No, it was Sock, right?

278
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:28,754
What? They know?

279
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,353
Sam! OK, you know what? How long were
you planning on keeping this from me?

280
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:35,153
I was waiting for the right moment to
tell you so you wouldn't freak out.

281
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,210
- What?! Get over.
- OK. All right. All right.

282
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:44,603
What made you think
that you could deceive me like this?

283
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:48,936
I should not have kept the secret
from you. Another secret.

284
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:52,404
I just... I thought it would be better
to keep you in the dark for a while.

285
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:55,014
No, Sam. It's pretty clear
why you'd keep this a secret.

286
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,658
I mean, come on.
You're the son of the devil, OK? I...

287
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,437
Me being in the dark is better for you.

288
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:01,409
- Because I was afraid of this.
- Of what?

289
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:04,108
- This! Upsetting you.
- Well, too late. I'm upset.

290
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:05,905
I know,
and I didn't want that to happen.

291
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:08,534
I didn't understand what it all meant,
and I still don't.

292
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:10,022
I know. You're fired.

293
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:12,400
- Andi, what?
- Yep. You're fired.

294
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:14,925
I'm pretty sure you
legally can't do that.

295
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:17,524
OK, you know what? I don't care.
I mean, I have to do something.

296
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:20,220
So then fine. You know what?
You're on dumpster duty forever.

297
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:22,207
You know what else?
Not!

298
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:25,342
- OK, I deserved that.
- Clean that up!

299
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,720
Yes! Right away! On it!

300
00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:49,942
Andi, come on. I just.
Hear me out, all right?

301
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,566
You just can't come
bursting into people's offices.

302
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:56,248
I might have been naked in here.

303
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:02,222
- What are you doing here?
- Just wanted to talk to you.

304
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,143
It seems we're having a small
accounting error in purgatory.

305
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:10,214
- So I owe money now?
- No. A soul. We're missing one.

306
00:19:10,503 --> 00:19:12,851
Not your fault.
Just kind of slipped through the cracks.

307
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:15,014
Tell me who it is so you can
get the hell out of here.

308
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:17,497
You already know who it is, the baby.

309
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:20,291
- The baby?
- That soul

310
00:19:20,913 --> 00:19:24,905
escaped specifically to have her baby
out of hell, and you know what?

311
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,730
No one gets out of hell,
not even offspring.

312
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:31,520
I'm not sending a little baby to hell.

313
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,817
I can understand your hesitation, but...

314
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:38,087
You mustn't allow yourself to
be fooled by its pudgy cuteness.

315
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:41,720
Kid is a bad seed.
It's destined for evil

316
00:19:42,154 --> 00:19:45,077
- like its mother.
- I don't know what to tell you. I...

317
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:46,308
We gave it away.

318
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:49,964
That just won't work, Sammy.

319
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,071
I know that this'll be hard for you,
so don't rush.

320
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:57,694
Just have it back by say,
this time tomorrow.

321
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:02,177
Because if you don't retrieve this kid,
I will...

322
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:06,266
And it won't be pretty for
anybody who gets in my way.

323
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,781
I can't believe you got
drugs from a doctor so easily.

324
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:20,800
Excess testosterone, Benji.
People get intimidated.

325
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:22,891
It is my gift and my curse.

326
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,558
Also, I weaseled some pills out
of him to help with your scalp itch.

327
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:28,350
Thanks, man.

328
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,786
- When are you gonna take yours?
- I'm working my way up to it, OK, Ben!

329
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:36,160
I just wanna hang on to my manhood for
a couple more hours. Is that all right?

330
00:20:36,246 --> 00:20:39,893
I just got off the phone with Tony. He's
cookin' us lunch at his new apartment.

331
00:20:41,462 --> 00:20:43,593
He's not gonna let go
of that baby easily.

332
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,678
No, no, but lunch is perfect, though.

333
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:48,887
Tony is both a supersensitive
demon and a culinary perfectionist.

334
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,199
All we gotta do, bag on his cookin'.
He starts bawlin',

335
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:54,007
runs down to the market, grabs some
locally grown organic garbage.

336
00:20:54,097 --> 00:20:56,759
Once he leaves, boom, vessel the baby.
Bob's your uncle.

337
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:00,001
Dad, what are you doing here?

338
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:02,301
I came for your brains.

339
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,097
I'm just kiddin'.

340
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,143
Actually, I just thought we could
maybe hang out, watch the ballgame.

341
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:09,391
Now's not a good time.

342
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:14,897
Sam, can I speak to you for a minute?

343
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:21,195
All right, let's make this quick.

344
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:24,072
- What is your problem, Sam?
- We have to be somewhere.

345
00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:27,304
OK, you know what? I gotta say
that I'm a little disappointed in you.

346
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:29,852
- Why?
- Because I'm gettin' the sense, Sam,

347
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:32,496
- that you're blowin'me off.
- What are you talking about?

348
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:34,127
You're blowin'me off, Sam,

349
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,412
and frankly, you're shirkin'
your family responsibilities.

350
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:39,613
Dad, this is not
my responsibility to baby-sit you.

351
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:42,589
OK? What about mom?
Get her to let you move back in.

352
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,509
She doesn't want me to, Sam. She's

353
00:21:46,459 --> 00:21:48,768
you know...
I'm startin' to believe that

354
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,749
she actually blames me for this,

355
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:53,188
as if it's my fault
that I turned into a zombie.

356
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,104
It kind of is your fault.

357
00:21:56,677 --> 00:22:00,295
- So you're pickin' sides now.
- Yes. Yes, I am.

358
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:02,694
All right? This is all your doing.

359
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,021
All right,
all this happened because of you.

360
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:07,790
You made a deal with the devil,
and then you lied about it.

361
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,202
I'm your father,
so I demand a little respect.

362
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,627
No, you're not!
You're not my real father!

363
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:15,249
What did you say?

364
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:19,527
I said that you're not my real father.

365
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:25,774
- I suppose the devil told you that.
- Yes, he did.

366
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:27,343
I'm guessing it's true.

367
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:33,809
You know I'm not allowed
to say anything about this, that

368
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:37,416
the deal with the devil forbids
me from telling you anything.

369
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,106
Well, there's my answer.

370
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:40,921
Sam, I...

371
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:43,655
I just want you to...

372
00:22:44,603 --> 00:22:47,948
Remember who raised you,
who was there for you growin'up, Sam,

373
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:51,687
every step of the way,
who loved you. I did.

374
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:55,449
No matter what anyone tells you,
I love you.

375
00:22:57,127 --> 00:23:00,087
And that's really all
that matters, right?

376
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:02,852
Sure. That's all that matters.

377
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:06,786
Now I gotta go send a baby to hell,
so thanks...

378
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:08,789
Dad.

379
00:23:15,383 --> 00:23:17,936
Well, I am so glad you
guys were able to come out.

380
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:21,582
It's important for Stevie to be
around people that I consider family.

381
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:24,226
Family's important.

382
00:23:29,961 --> 00:23:32,976
And you also get to hear about
the important milestones,

383
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,296
like guess what happened last
night for the first time.

384
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:36,872
- What? What?
- She gurgled.

385
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:40,025
She gurgled. That's wonderful.

386
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:42,877
Isn't it, though? It's just wonderful.
But don't let my gushing stop you guys.

387
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,330
Please, there's food, mimosas,
ice tea, whatever you need.

388
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,832
Right? Whatever you need.

389
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,808
Is the salad OK?

390
00:23:57,606 --> 00:24:00,155
It's good.
It's. It's adequate.

391
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,175
Sock, what is wrong with the salad?

392
00:24:02,663 --> 00:24:04,593
Nothin'. Nothin', Tony.
It's just, you know, I...

393
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:07,854
To tell you the truth, I had a salad
the other day that was loaded

394
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:11,110
with shiitake mushrooms, and it
just Kinda blew my mind, that's all.

395
00:24:12,106 --> 00:24:14,741
No problem. I have shiitake in
the kitchen. I'll throw them in there.

396
00:24:15,044 --> 00:24:18,156
I don't even think it's the mushrooms
that are the problem.

397
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:22,767
It's not?
No, it's... tomatoes.

398
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,328
What's wrong with the tomatoes?

399
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:27,214
They're very ripe.

400
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,422
That's unacceptable.
I apologize.

401
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,505
There's a grocery right
around the corner.

402
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:39,239
He's got fresh ones.
I'll be back in a jiff.

403
00:24:39,322 --> 00:24:40,664
- Just keep eating.
- Wait.

404
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,891
You know,
we could take care of the baby for you.

405
00:24:43,297 --> 00:24:46,120
- Yeah, We could watch the baby.
- Why not?

406
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:53,656
OK, yes. OK, sure. Right. I don't wanna
be one of those smothering parents.

407
00:24:55,116 --> 00:24:57,182
OK. I'll be back in a minute.

408
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:02,051
You guys have my cell number
if there's a problem, right?

409
00:25:02,176 --> 00:25:05,488
- Absolutely.
- OK. OK, tomatoes.

410
00:25:10,164 --> 00:25:12,801
- I can't believe that worked.
- Well, the tomatoes are a little ripe.

411
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:17,983
All right, let's shove a spike
through this baby's face.

412
00:25:19,771 --> 00:25:21,268
OK, Sam, go. Do it.

413
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:23,979
Sam, come on. Do it. Do it.

414
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:26,376
Do it.

415
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:31,699
- I can't do it.
- Come on.

416
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:35,699
It's a little baby. Look at it, with
its big eyes and its little fingers.

417
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:37,696
I can't stick a stake in it.

418
00:25:38,132 --> 00:25:40,962
What if the devil is tricking me,
trying to get me to stab this baby?

419
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:44,171
I thought he said it was gonna be evil,
do monstrous things like its mom

420
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:46,334
It doesn't look anything like a monster.

421
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:48,254
So then what do we do?

422
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:51,317
I don't know. It's lookin'
at me all cute and stuff.

423
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,290
Cover it up. Cover up the baby.
Here we go.

424
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:57,617
There. Now you can stab
that baby guilt-free. Go.

425
00:25:57,742 --> 00:25:59,669
That's gonna smother the baby.

426
00:26:00,571 --> 00:26:02,896
Do you like that?
Peekaboo.

427
00:26:03,582 --> 00:26:07,201
- Peekaboo. Peekaboo.
- Ben! Ben, you're not helping.

428
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:12,196
OK, wait, wait, wait. I got it.
What if what if we sing it to sleep?

429
00:26:12,295 --> 00:26:13,870
That way, it won't be looking at me,

430
00:26:13,953 --> 00:26:15,902
and it'll just make it easier
on the both of us.

431
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:18,203
- Good, good, good.
- Yeah, I like it.

432
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,536
Twinkle lullaby

433
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:24,899
and good night

434
00:26:25,272 --> 00:26:29,848
you gotta get a spike in your baby eye

435
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,776
As luck would have it,
my neighbor had a couple of fresh ones.

436
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:34,905
So...

437
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:38,753
What's goin' on?

438
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,913
This isn't what it looks like.

439
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,353
Stay away from my daughter.

440
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,107
Hi. What did they do to you?

441
00:26:56,343 --> 00:26:57,730
Tony, nothing. Nothing.

442
00:26:58,614 --> 00:26:59,870
What is this?

443
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,755
No, tony,
the devil told me she has to go back,

444
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,675
that she's a bad seed, an evil monster.

445
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,491
The devil is full of lies.

446
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,755
This baby's innocent.
She's not a monster!

447
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,747
Oh, god! Benji!

448
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:23,139
Tony, the devil wants her back.

449
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:26,890
I'll raise her to be good, Sam.
Babies aren't born evil.

450
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:30,021
- Humans make them evil.
- You can't stop him. He'll kill you.

451
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:33,277
- What would you have me do, Sam?!
- I'm not just gonna hand her over.

452
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,055
He won't stop coming for
you until he gets the baby.

453
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:38,322
We have to make the devil not want it.

454
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,920
How do we do that?

455
00:27:42,852 --> 00:27:45,628
Baptism.
What if we baptize the baby?

456
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:48,957
If we get her baptized,
it washes away original sin.

457
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:50,293
Will that work?

458
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,807
If she's christened,
she'll be pure, a blank slate.

459
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:55,997
The devil won't have any claim over her,
at least for now.

460
00:27:56,451 --> 00:27:57,632
That just might work.

461
00:27:58,615 --> 00:28:00,952
Yeah, that just might work, baby.

462
00:28:01,365 --> 00:28:03,355
Daddy's gonna get you baptized.

463
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:08,005
Yes, he's gonna have you baptized.

464
00:28:15,381 --> 00:28:17,228
Hey, we're all set.

465
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:20,189
My grand-mother called
and spoke to father Ortega.

466
00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:22,907
Now, he's willing to do the emergency
baptism as long as we have

467
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,289
- parents standing in.
- Here comes the mama.

468
00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:28,804
Hey, Andi. Thank you for doing this.
You don't know how much it means to me.

469
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:30,143
Yeah, sure, Tony.

470
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,404
Well, there's father Ortega.

471
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:40,332
Andi, this is little Stevie.

472
00:28:41,718 --> 00:28:43,832
- She's beautiful.
- Yeah, Stevie, this is Andi.

473
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:46,875
She's gonna be your mama
for today along with papa Sam.

474
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:49,494
You're not standing in as the father?

475
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:52,395
I can't. The whole, demon thing. Yeah.

476
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:56,608
I can't enter onto consecrated ground.
I'll light up like an oversoaked flambe.

477
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,274
But Sam's half-human,
so he's probably OK.

478
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:03,615
And I can't imagine a sweeter
couple than you and Sam to,

479
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:05,742
watch over little Stevie
at her christening.

480
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:10,163
- Right?
- Fine. Let's just get it over with.

481
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:14,504
Something going on with you and Sam?

482
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:16,622
Son of the devil.

483
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,159
You know, I was.
I was right there with you.

484
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:24,250
I thought Sam was full of evil
just waiting to burst forth.

485
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,759
Heck, I even tried to kill him.
But then Steve appeared to me,

486
00:29:29,327 --> 00:29:32,435
and he let me know that
Sam is worth saving.

487
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,841
I just don't think his
fate is tied to the devil.

488
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:39,360
Do you know that?

489
00:29:42,705 --> 00:29:45,504
Well, you don't know anything for sure.

490
00:29:46,524 --> 00:29:49,060
The devil says this
baby belongs in hell, but

491
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:52,990
I look at that angel face,
and all I see is the good.

492
00:29:54,122 --> 00:29:56,670
And that's what I see
when I look at Sam.

493
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,998
I can't prove that. That's something
that you need to look for in Sam,

494
00:30:01,613 --> 00:30:02,844
find for yourself.

495
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:06,762
Right?

496
00:30:13,568 --> 00:30:16,540
- Why are you staring at me?
- You didn't burst into flames.

497
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,780
Why would I burst into flames?

498
00:30:18,862 --> 00:30:21,248
Tony said that he couldn't
walk on consecrated ground

499
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,342
without lighting on fire.
Just thought it may be the same for you.

500
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:28,186
- What, you didn't think to warn me?
- No. I was testing you.

501
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:31,587
- And you would've deserved it.
- You're probably right.

502
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:35,396
So are we good?

503
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,462
I don't know yet.

504
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,046
You know, when I look at you,
I see the Sam that I've known for years,

505
00:30:42,844 --> 00:30:45,754
the Sam that I know would be here
doing good,

506
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:47,719
trying to save this baby.

507
00:30:49,136 --> 00:30:51,345
But it also really worries
me who your father is.

508
00:30:52,878 --> 00:30:54,270
It worries me, too.

509
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,706
Look, Andi, I think there's good
inside me. I hope there is.

510
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:03,066
But, you know, if you ever see
anything that doesn't seem right,

511
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,770
run for the hills.

512
00:31:07,874 --> 00:31:10,237
OK, welcome, everybody.

513
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,952
We could just gather around.
We're ready to get started.

514
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,256
Just have to take care of
a little business first.

515
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:18,766
OK, just need you to sign
and date the bottom, both of you.

516
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:31,850
- The stroller!
- Oh, my god.

517
00:32:31,024 --> 00:32:33,741
Thank you, Sammy.
I'll take that.

518
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,334
She's just an innocent baby.
Come on. Let her go.

519
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,599
Poor Sammy.

520
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,057
I get it.

521
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:47,874
You see yourself in her,

522
00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:51,898
the poor innocent who gets screwed
by someone else's bad choices.

523
00:32:51,985 --> 00:32:54,763
But I told you before,
she is no innocent.

524
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:56,522
How do you know for su?

525
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:59,429
Because she's destined for evil.

526
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:03,326
Nature versus nurture.

527
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:05,805
No amount of loving parenting
will change this kid.

528
00:33:06,043 --> 00:33:08,897
Look, I've been around a long time,
and from everything I've seen,

529
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,759
nature always wins.

530
00:33:11,696 --> 00:33:14,050
- Doesn't it, honey?
- All right, fine.

531
00:33:14,162 --> 00:33:17,165
If she's gonna be so terrible,
just let her stay

532
00:33:17,722 --> 00:33:20,652
- here on earth.
- What are you babbling on about?

533
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,491
She's destined for evil, right?

534
00:33:22,574 --> 00:33:24,827
I mean, isn't that what you want,
people to do evil things?

535
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,572
Let her grow up and go
totally sick on the world.

536
00:33:27,655 --> 00:33:30,757
I want souls, Sammy.
That's my deal.

537
00:33:30,988 --> 00:33:33,635
But imagine how many more
souls she could deliver to you.

538
00:33:34,283 --> 00:33:36,719
How many people will she hurt?
Boyfriends, friends.

539
00:33:36,802 --> 00:33:39,635
People she can mess up, who will
probably turn evil themselves, right?

540
00:33:39,722 --> 00:33:42,694
I mean,
you could have one soul or dozens.

541
00:33:43,962 --> 00:33:46,181
You don't even know what she's
gonna be when she grows up.

542
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:48,768
What if she's a teacher?
What if she's a psychiatrist?

543
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:51,544
Think how many people
she can damage like that.

544
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:57,200
Hey, maybe you'll become a Politician,
even President.

545
00:33:57,283 --> 00:34:00,168
Yes. Yes, absolutely.
That's what I'm saying.

546
00:34:07,382 --> 00:34:09,708
There you go.
Here you go.

547
00:34:14,491 --> 00:34:17,255
- What a performance, man.
- What are you saying?

548
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:20,556
Did you really think I would fall
for that "she'll be evil" bit?

549
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:23,886
You're really bummin' me out, man.
You think i'm such a dummy.

550
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:28,148
I know how this story ends,
how this kid is gonna turn out,

551
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:31,169
the same way I know how
you're gonna turn out.

552
00:34:36,211 --> 00:34:38,350
You can't stop nature, Sammy.

553
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:43,553
And I'll very much enjoy the look
on your face when I'm proven right.

554
00:35:19,234 --> 00:35:20,465
What are you doing?

555
00:35:23,851 --> 00:35:26,077
- Hey, sis. What?
- What's this?

556
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:28,064
Th-this? This is,

557
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:31,110
this is nothin'. This is

558
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:33,629
a pill the doctor told me to take.

559
00:35:34,907 --> 00:35:36,399
I have a small problem.

560
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,639
Well, not small. It's, you know,
more of an average-sized problem.

561
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:43,391
And, I need to take these

562
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,155
to tame my...

563
00:35:47,741 --> 00:35:50,078
vivaciousness.
I need to take

564
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:53,914
my free and curious, outgoing nature
and put it inside of a box

565
00:35:53,997 --> 00:35:57,964
to make myself a better
brother and person.

566
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:00,281
I'm too spirited.

567
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,635
It would break my heart if
you were any less spirited.

568
00:36:08,004 --> 00:36:09,235
I won't let you.

569
00:36:12,582 --> 00:36:15,245
I never want
your wonderful spirit to change.

570
00:36:15,328 --> 00:36:16,567
Kristen, I...

571
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:20,465
you have been so loving and attentive,

572
00:36:21,636 --> 00:36:24,197
and if you change that wonderful spirit,

573
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,845
that will change me,

574
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,914
- and that'll be sad.
- Yeah.

575
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:33,223
You're right. I don't know what
I was thinkin' with the...

576
00:36:34,924 --> 00:36:38,455
you are very, very,
very sweet and perceptive.

577
00:36:40,388 --> 00:36:42,207
You are a good person.

578
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,387
This is good, right?
This is yeah.

579
00:36:46,293 --> 00:36:48,332
You are an amazing sister.

580
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:52,916
Now, we need to make sure
that you don't change.

581
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:55,430
What can I do to help you?

582
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:58,397
- Help me?
- Yeah. Anything.

583
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,213
I will do anything for you.

584
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,385
Just tell me what it is you need
from me, and I will give it.

585
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:09,841
Serve's up!

586
00:37:12,394 --> 00:37:15,838
In your face!
Serve it up.

587
00:37:16,931 --> 00:37:18,498
Thank you. I'll see you next week.

588
00:37:21,175 --> 00:37:22,191
Go away.

589
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,050
Testy.

590
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:26,654
- Everything all right?
- No, I know why you're here,'K?

591
00:37:26,738 --> 00:37:28,914
You have some sick need
to mess with me and Sam.

592
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,955
Not gonna work,
so thanks for stoppin'by.

593
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:33,965
I'm not gonna mess with you. I'm just
surprised you're still datin'him.

594
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:37,378
- Bein' the son of the devil and all.
- You know, Sam is a good guy.

595
00:37:37,662 --> 00:37:39,213
- He's not you.
- Really?

596
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,422
Yeah, and with everything
that hangs over Sam's head,

597
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:43,787
he still manages to be
a good and decent person.

598
00:37:43,877 --> 00:37:45,618
I think he'll always be that way.

599
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,893
That's amazing.

600
00:37:51,408 --> 00:37:54,629
No, no. I'm impressed
by your intuitiveness.

601
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:58,399
You can see evil.
I'm still tryin'to hone that knack.

602
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:01,874
Evil's a tough one to spot.
You know, it lurks...

603
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:05,703
Down in those deep, dark corners.
It's hard to see.

604
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:08,621
And they say the worst evil
comes in a friendly form...

605
00:38:08,716 --> 00:38:10,897
nice smile, familiar eyes...

606
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:15,082
and it's never recognized.
Well, until it's too late.

607
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,196
Especially if you're in love.

608
00:38:17,286 --> 00:38:19,545
They say evil is impossible
to see if it's got your heart.

609
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,815
But good for you that you so confident
about Sam. I mean, That's great.

610
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:27,382
I must have missed it,
but good eye, Andi.

611
00:38:28,412 --> 00:38:29,444
Good job.

612
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,487
Well, this is the place.

613
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:44,820
You're gonna move into this?

614
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,886
Yeah. Unit 18.

615
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:50,330
- It's a great storage facility.
- To live in?

616
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:53,741
Yeah. It's climate-controlled, quiet.

617
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:55,743
The first month is free.

618
00:38:56,603 --> 00:38:58,791
Are you sure mom won't
let you move back?

619
00:38:59,736 --> 00:39:02,509
No, Sam.
She made it pretty clear we're over.

620
00:39:03,205 --> 00:39:05,755
She blames me for
everything that happened, and

621
00:39:05,991 --> 00:39:07,922
she's got every right not to forgive me.

622
00:39:08,778 --> 00:39:11,192
But, hey, what do you think we,

623
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:15,091
put a flatty on the wall,
some chili pepper string lights,

624
00:39:15,174 --> 00:39:18,910
get my old seahawks posters framed.
Could be a real man-cave, right?

625
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:21,238
Dad...

626
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:25,310
I can't stay mad at you.
You're my father.

627
00:39:26,202 --> 00:39:27,202
What?

628
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,840
You know, if...
If I am a good person,

629
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:33,778
it's because of how I was raised, and...

630
00:39:34,558 --> 00:39:36,137
you raised me well, dad.

631
00:39:42,323 --> 00:39:43,501
You're a good son.

632
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:47,931
Anyway,

633
00:39:48,608 --> 00:39:51,562
let's, get this sucker unloaded and

634
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,516
- move in.
- Wait. Dad.

635
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:56,962
I have a better idea.

636
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,541
A little turn to the left. OK.

637
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:03,665
All right.

638
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:06,592
Hey, guys.

639
00:40:07,134 --> 00:40:10,644
- How was the ride over?
- Good. Good. This is great.

640
00:40:10,727 --> 00:40:13,172
Hey, I got a bunch of refrigerator
magnets from the bench,

641
00:40:13,261 --> 00:40:16,077
so you can style and decorate
it any way you want, OK?

642
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,425
That's fantastic, Ben.

643
00:40:18,547 --> 00:40:20,576
'K, I wanna be really clear
about something, Mr. O.

644
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:24,042
you are a garage roomie only? I don't
want you wandering inside the house.

645
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:27,326
- It's off limits to the mostly dead.
- I understand completely.

646
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:31,495
- OK, then. Welcome aboard.
- Stay cool, Mr. Oliver.

647
00:40:31,578 --> 00:40:35,272
I will. I will.
And, you know, this place is so roomy.

648
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,250
I'll have to have a party
and invite you guys over.

649
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,340
Totally.

650
00:40:41,518 --> 00:40:44,117
- You are a good son.
- I second that!

651
00:40:44,204 --> 00:40:45,336
Team Subs-Addicts"
