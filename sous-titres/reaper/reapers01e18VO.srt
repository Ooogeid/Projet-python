1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,260
Are You Sure This Test Is Gonna Work?

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,460
Positive.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,040
Simon Drops The Washing Machine

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,840
And If Sam Is Able To Use His Evil Power

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,690
To Protect Himself, We'll Have Our Proof.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,000
He's The Son Of The Devil.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,320
But If He's Just Human, He'll Be Crushed.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,330
You're The One Who Suspects He's Satan's Spawn.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,350
You Want To Know For Sure?

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,060
Yes,I Do.

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,660
There You Go. Proof.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,220
He Is Evil.

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,950
He Seemed Like Such A Nice Kid.

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,220
So Helpless.

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,550
Helpless?

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,690
Tony,Come On, This Is The Heir To The Devil's Domain.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,340
The Harbinger Of The Apocalypse.

18
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,570
He Will Rise To Power In His Lifetime

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,360
And Bring About The Destruction Of Human Civilization.

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,960
Oh,He Is Evil Like None Have Known Before.

What Does That Look Like To You?

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,010
Unicorn Fighting A Werewolf.

27
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,540
It's The Ultimate Battle.

28
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,300
What?

29
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,220
Do You--Do You See A Person?

30
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,700
Like Maybe Somebody We Know?

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,090
Who Do You Think It Looks Like?

32
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,690
I Think It Looks Like Steve.

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,110
Steve?

34
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,460
Dead Gay Demon Steve?

35
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,670
Yeah,Do You See It? Look.

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,160
Steve Fighting A Unicorn?

37
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,190
You Guys Are Jerks!

38
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,580
Hey! Hey!

39
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,570
You Were Supposed To Pick Me Up From The Jail.

40
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,730
Oh,That Was Today?

41
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,100
Could Have Sworn That Was Tomorrow.

42
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,700
Benji, We're So Sorry.

43
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,680
At Least They Hooked You Up With That Weird Suit.

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,910
Yeah,It Was A Present From An Attempted Murderer I Met.

45
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,320
That's An Attempted Murder Suit?

46
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,410
Yes. Nice.

47
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,930
Can I Try On The Jacket?

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,750
Hands Off.

49
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,190
I Let You Try On My Homeless Guy Pants.

50
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,660
Come On. It's Not The Same.

51
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,350
All Right,I'm Going On Break.

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,880
I'm Home!

53
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,800
Coming To Do My Laundry.

54
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,490
Unless You Wanna Do It For Me.

55
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,430
I Could Use Some Ironing As Well If You Wanna...

56
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,940
There's Nothing Rational About It!

57
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,080
Ok!

58
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,980
We Are Not.

59
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,830
Dad?

60
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,580
Hey,Sam,Must Be Laundry Day.

61
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,380
Yeah,Is Everything Ok?

62
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,520
I Saw You Guys Fighting.

63
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,530
Oh,That,Yeah,Yeah, No,We're--We're Fine.

64
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,340
Just The Usual Things-- Money,Bills.

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,320
Why Are You Standing In A Circle?

66
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,510
Look At That. Uh...

67
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,600
I-I-I Don't Know.

68
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,040
There Were,Um, Some Kids In The--

69
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,030
In The Neighborhood Doing Chalk Graffiti.

70
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,160
There's Chalk On Your Pants.

71
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,490
It's On Your Hands,Too.

72
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,170
Wow,Look At That.

73
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,490
That Stuff Is Everywhere.

74
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,230
Damn Kids.

75
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,270
You Know What? I'm Gonna Get The Hose.

76
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,050
All Right?

77
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,710
Yo,Sammy!

78
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,490
Hey. What's This?

79
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,140
The Lottery Day.

80
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,530
Jackpot's Up To 247 Million.

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,850
You Want A Quickpick?

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,980
No,I'm Good.

83
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,750
You Know,I Gotta Say,

84
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,490
This Is One Of My Greatest Inventions.

85
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,510
You Invented The Lottery?

86
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,710
You Betcha.

87
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,450
State Sponsored Gambling.

88
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,390
Minimum Wage Earners Spending Their Last Buck

89
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,820
On An 18 Million To One Long Shot.

90
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,320
I Like To Call It The Idiot Tax.

91
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,720
How Did You Meet My Dad?

92
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,100
Didn't Your Parents Ever Tell You?

93
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,930
No. All They Said Was That My Dad Was Sick

94
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,380
And They Made A Deal With You So He Got Better.

95
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,450
They Weren't Going To Have Any Kids,

96
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,240
But You Tricked Them Into Having Me.

97
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,640
Well,Hey,If That's What They Said,

98
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,690
Then It Must Be True.

99
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,150
I Mean,Why Would They Lie?

100
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,010
Are You Saying They're Lying?

101
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,710
Listen,Sammy...

102
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,730
They're Your Parents, And You Love Them,

103
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,340
But People Who Make Deals With Me,

104
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,020
Generally Aren't Big On Integrity.

105
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,740
You Can't Get Blood From A Stone.

106
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,960
I'm Just Saying.

107
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,550
But Here,This Will Take Your Mind Off It.

108
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,020
Sit Down.

109
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,400
Your Next Soul.

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,390
Madame Ozera, A Romanian Fortune Teller From The Early 1900s.

111
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,770
She Read Tarot Cards?

112
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,660
Yeah,She Was The Real Deal.

113
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,290
Sold Her Soul To Me For The Power To Predict The Future.

114
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,030
Earned Quite A Reputation For Herself

115
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,810
Until The Local Villagers Hung Her From A Tree

116
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,400
For Consorting With The Devil.

117
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,660
Surprisingly Perceptive For A Bunch Of Clods With Pitchforks.

118
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,960
Let Me Guess, The Fortune Teller's Back In Business.

119
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,160
With A Vengeance.

120
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,830
Oh,That Is Just Rude.

121
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,120
????

122
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,880
We Had Lunch Plans For An Hour Ago,

123
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,870
And Where Were You?

124
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,280
Here Sleeping.

125
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,420
No. Well,Not Anymore.

126
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,790
Let's Go Get Some Grub,Huh,Baby?

127
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,050
I Already Ate.

128
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,490
Oh. In That Case,Do You Mind If I Go Back To Sleep?

129
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,070
I Was Kind Of Having A Kick Ass Dream About Zebras.

130
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,300
You Don't Understand,Do You?

131
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,380
They're Just Basically Striped Horses.

132
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,990
Sock! You Don't Get That You're Being A Bad Boyfriend.

133
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,390
I'm Not Being A Bad Boyfriend.

134
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,900
You Need To Put More Energy In Our Relationship.

135
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,660
Oh,My God. Josie,Relationships Aren't About Energy.

136
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,440
They're Supposed To Be Effortless And Easy.

137
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,450
People Have To Work At Relationships!

138
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,380
All The Time. You Know What?

139
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,140
If This Is Just Another Job I Have To Keep,Then I Quit.

140
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,870
You Quit?

141
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,500
You're Fired!

142
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,930
Ouch.

143
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,580
Mm-Hmm. And We're Over.

144
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,580
Oh. So Clever.

145
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,900
Never Heard That One Before. Mmm.

146
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,820
You Guys Broke Up Again?

147
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,290
She'll Be Back.

148
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,450
The Dance Continues.

149
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,050
Steve?

150
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,450
Sock,Sock,Look.

151
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,020
What?

152
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,310
It Came Back Through Two Coats Of Fresh Paint.

153
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,070
Huh. Tough Little Bastard.

154
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,550
You Don't See Steve At All?

155
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,380
Unicorn,

156
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,360
Werewolf.

157
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,890
End Of Discussion.

158
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,320
Also Looks Like The Werewolf Grew A Nice Set Of Jugs.

159
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,810
Aw,Sam,Sock.

160
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,440
Hey,Tony,How You Doing?

161
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,240
????

162
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,500
You See Anything?

163
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,490
It Looks Like Black Mold.

164
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,730
You Should Have That Remediated.

165
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,250
It's Super Toxic.

166
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,870
Hey,You Guys,I Need To Ask,Um,A Favor.

167
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,880
Do You Have A Second?

168
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,550
Yeah,Yeah,Sure, Whatever.

169
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,950
I Can't Really Discuss It Here.

170
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,530
We Need To Discuss It Somewhere A Little Bit More Circular.

171
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,050
Here We Go,Ok.

172
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,930
Almost. All Right.

173
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,720
3 Dudes In A Tent,Sexy.

174
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,710
We Have A New Plan.

175
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,310
What Is This?

176
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,570
It's A Cage,Designed Millennia Ago

177
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,320
By King Solomon And In This Cage,

178
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,770
Solomon Captured Asmodeus, King Of Demons.

179
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,050
Its Strength Is Unbounded

180
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,670
And We're Going To Use It To Trap

181
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,400
And Bind The Devil.

182
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,360
Forever.

183
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,570
No,Tony,The Last Time You Tried To Defeat The Devil,

184
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,080
It Ended In Death And Destruction.

185
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,720
I Mean,Come On,You Got To Think About This.

186
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,030
I Have,Sam. We Will Succeed.

187
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,660
I Don't Want To Be Involved.

188
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,120
Actually,I'm Not Asking You To Be Involved,Sam,

189
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,420
But This Cage Is Going To Need Plenty

190
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,030
Of Supplies,So I Only Need One Thing From You.

191
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,970
Your Employee Discount.

192
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,590
Oh. Ok.

193
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,190
No,Wait,Use Mine, Use Mine,Tony.

194
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,340
I Want The Commission.

195
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,060
Eat It!

196
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,570
Here You Go.

197
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,280
All Right,Let's Grab The Rest.

198
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,500
Uh,I'll Be Right In. All Right?

199
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,300
Just Wanted To Come Over And Say Thank You.

200
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,530
For What?

201
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,440
Well,I Think What You Demons Are Doing To El Diablo Is Awesome.

202
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,170
I'm All About Fighting The Power,Taking Down "The Man."

203
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,380
You Know What I Mean?

204
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,790
You See <I>Erin Brockovich?</I>

205
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,430
Yes.

206
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,680
Yeah? This Guy's Favorite Movie.

207
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,600
All-Time.

208
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,940
Let Me Take A Look At This.

209
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,300
All Right,You Know What? I'm Gonna Go In

210
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,040
And Grab All This Hardware For You And You Stay Put,Ok?

211
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,820
I Appreciate That.

212
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,810
Cute Horns,By The Way.

213
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,940
Not Creepy At All.

214
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,960
Mmm. Ok,I'll Be Back.

215
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,660
Hey.

216
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,550
It's Amazing How Funny And Full Of Life You Are.

217
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:08,260
Yeah,I Guess It Is Pretty Amazing How Full Of Life I Am.

218
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,300
It's Coming Out Of Every Hole.

219
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,290
Kiss Me.

220
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,810
Um,What?

221
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,850
Kiss Me. Now.

222
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,840
Uh,Uh,Uh,That's Really Flattering,Sweetheart,

223
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,150
It's Just I--I--I--Whoa!

224
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,900
I Have A Girlfriend.

225
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,870
I Mean,I Don't Know, We're On A Break.

226
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,750
It Just Happened Though.

227
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,500
I Don't Really Know What The Rules Are On That,So I,You Know...

228
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,270
Just Think Of It As A Thank You For All Your Help.

229
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,100
Ok. I Will Think Of It Like That.

230
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,560
Oh. Whoa! Oh!

231
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,530
Let Me Just Catch My Breath.

232
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,120
That Was Weird.

233
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,700
All Right,Bring It On.

234
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,200
Sock! Sock! Sock!

235
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,600
Mmm. Huh?

236
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,420
You Ok,Man?

237
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,800
Ah! Where Is She?

238
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,940
What,Who?

239
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,000
Marlana, The Hot Demon Chick! Where'd She Go?

240
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,120
Uh,They Took Their Stuff And They Split.

241
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,570
What? You Sure You're Ok?

242
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,250
Yeah,Man,I'm Fine.

243
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,190
Actually,Hell,Yeah!

244
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,690
I Feel Rested, I'm Totally Pumped.

245
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,940
You Know What I Mean?

246
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,490
You Ever Feel Like That?

247
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,820
You Ever Feel Like That?

248
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,340
I Feel Like I Could Just,Uh...

249
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,230
I Don't Know, Lift This Car!

250
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,520
No? How 'Bout This?

251
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,060
You Want Some Of This?

252
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,380
Suck That!

253
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,700
How'd You Do That?

254
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,930
I Don't Know.

255
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,550
That's Crazy,Right?

256
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,170
I Was In The Back Of The Truck With Marlana And She...

257
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,590
She--She What?

258
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,990
Nothing.

259
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,570
I'm Gonna Go Blast My Traz.

260
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,450
Wanna Come?

261
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,850
Ok,Sam,I Think I Got Something.

262
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,260
You Want Me To Hire A Dominatrix?

263
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,900
No,But I Was Thinking That Maybe This Could Help Us

264
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,460
Track Down A Fortune Teller.

265
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,970
Although I Can't Find Any Madame Ozera,

266
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,760
So I Think She Might Have Changed Her Name Or Something.

267
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,060
All Right,Let Me Know What You Find Out.

268
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,320
What? No,Isn't This Your Job?

269
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,490
It Is, But I'm Delegating.

270
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,860
And Also, I Haven't Told You This...

271
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,720
I Never Learned How To Read.

272
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,760
Ha Ha. Oh,God. You Are So Weak.

273
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,750
Hey,Wait,Wait, Before You Go Out.

274
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,090
I Want To Ask You Something.

275
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,200
What?

276
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,130
You Know That Mold Stain On The Wall?

277
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,710
Yeah,The One You Think Looks Like Steve?

278
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,280
I Saw Him.

279
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,820
I Saw Him Here, In The Bench.

280
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,430
Really?

281
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,310
Yes,I Know,I Know.

282
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,100
It Sounds Crazy, But There He Was,

283
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,790
On The Security Monitor Looking Right At Me.

284
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,430
And Now The Stain's Back,And I'm Thinking,

285
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,760
Is This All In My Head? Is This Actually--

286
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,800
Is This Really Happening?

287
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,840
Forget It. I Sound Nuts.

288
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,360
No,No,No,You Don't.

289
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,700
I Mean,A Month Ago I Didn't Believe That The Devil Existed,

290
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,290
But Now,I Mean,Sam, We Know For A Fact

291
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,150
That There's Life After Death.

292
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,910
So,Steve Appearing As A Stain On The Wall?

293
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,620
That's Not That Crazy At All.

294
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,150
So,What Do You Think It Means?

295
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,750
Maybe He's Trying To Tell You Something.

296
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,580
Then Why Doesn't He Just Say It?

297
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,130
Why Did God Appear To Moses As A Burning Bush?

298
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,930
Or Why Do Angels Appear In Dreams?

299
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,510
Maybe It's Because They Need To Prepare You

300
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,760
With Signs,You Know?

301
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,480
Or Maybe They Just Like Messing With Your Head.

302
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,430
I Don't Know,I Don't Know,

303
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,370
But Next Time You See Steve,Just Ask Him.

304
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,510
Baseball?

305
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,930
I Scout For The Yankees In My Off-Time.

306
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,170
Play Some Catch?

307
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,000
Huh? Oh,Come On, Girlfriend.

308
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,120
Try Not To Embarrass Yourself.

309
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,110
Come On. Ha Ha!

310
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,100
Hey,You Got A Pretty Good Arm.

311
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,910
I Used To Play A Lot With My Dad.

312
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,380
Yeah.

313
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,420
Relaxing,Isn't It?

314
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,260
Huh? We Ought To Do This More Often.

315
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,480
So,How's,Uh, Tony's Rebellion Going?

316
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,730
Whoa! Whoa. Settle Down There,Rocket.

317
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,490
You Do Remember The Deal We Made,Don't You?

318
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,960
About You Spying On Tony For Me?

319
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,670
Uh,Oh,Yes,Yeah, Of Course.

320
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,090
I-I Think He Kind Of Gave Up On The Whole Rebellion.

321
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,750
I Mean,I Haven't Heard Anything,So...

322
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,590
Did Your Dad Ever Teach You How To Throw A Curve?

323
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,580
Uh,What? No.

324
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,870
Look,Let Me Show You The Grip.

325
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,590
Ow! God!

326
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,740
I Know All About Your Little Circle Jerks.

327
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
I Just Want You To Tell Me What Those Demons Are Up To,Huh?

328
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,160
Please,I Don't Know! I Don't Know!

329
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:07,910
I Don't Know! I Don't Know!

330
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,250
Come On,I Can Go On Like This For About,Oh,

331
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,160
I Don't Know,An Eternity.

332
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,630
Ok! Ok! Ok! They're Building A Cage!

333
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,730
A Metal Cage. A Cage To Trap You.

334
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,050
You Don't Mean Solomon's Cage?

335
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,250
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

336
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,640
Ho Ho Ho Ho! Oh,Man, That Is Fantastic.

337
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,550
What A Bunch Of Dummies.

338
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,850
That Cage Will Never Work On Me.

339
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,230
It Might Have The Power To Ensnare A Demon,

340
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,560
But Come On,I'm The Man.

341
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,750
So,You're Not Worried?

342
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,390
Not A Bit.

343
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,640
In Fact,I Feel Like Celebrating.

344
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,790
I'll Buy You A Beer.

345
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,940
This Is Never Gonna Hold Him.

346
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,200
Trust Me. It Will Work.

347
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,910
It's Never Been Tested On Satan Before.

348
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,240
Oh,We're Not Trying To Capture Satan.

349
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,190
We're Trying To Capture His Son.

350
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,840
What If Sam's Powers Are Greater Than We Know?

351
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,230
It Doesn't Matter. He Can't Control Them.

352
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,970
There's Never Been A Better Time To Capture Sam Than Right Now.

353
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,510
This Cage Will Bind The Black Soul

354
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,840
Of The Devil's Son For All Of Eternity.

355
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,580
Do You Need Anything?

356
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,210
Heck,Ya.

357
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,350
A Cold Drink? Foot Massage?

358
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,310
I Felt So Good For A Couple Hours There,

359
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,080
But Now I...

360
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,740
I Barely Have Enough Energy To Scratch My Junk Drawer.

361
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,790
Would You Mind,Sam?

362
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,580
All Right.

363
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,530
I've Narrowed Down Your List Of Suspects.

364
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,290
Great.

365
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Ok,Rook,Let's See What You Got.

366
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,690
Only 4 Fortune Tellers In The Area Are Female,

367
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,360
Work Exclusively In Tarot Cards,

368
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,760
And Opened Up For Business In The Last 6 Months.

369
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,000
She's The One. It's Her.

370
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,030
How Do You Know?

371
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,940
Experience. Just Going With The Gut.

372
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,070
It's Because She's Hot.

373
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,300
This Is Your Process?

374
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,360
I Spend Hours On The Phone

375
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,410
And You Guys Just Let Your Crotches Be Your Guide?

376
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,340
And Yet,The Job Always Gets Done.

377
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,550
I'm Gonna Clock Out And We'll Go Get Her.

378
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,330
Sam.

379
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,440
Steve,Is That You?

380
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,180
Ask About Cancun.

381
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,680
What Does That Mean?

382
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,490
Shh.

383
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,940
Sam?

384
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,570
Wait Right There. Did You See Him?

385
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,610
Who? Steve! He Was Right There!

386
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,060
Whatever.

387
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,910
Hey,Listen,We Got To Make One Little Pit Stop

388
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,120
Before We Go Soul Nabbing,All Right?

389
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,520
Drop Off A Load Of Lumber To Demon Central.

390
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,410
All Right,Can It Wait Until I...

391
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,970
No,No,Sam! This Is A Priority For Me!

392
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,070
Ok?

393
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,420
Ok.

394
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,940
Let's Go.

395
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,860
Go A Little To The Right.

396
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,030
Straight Back. Bring It Back.

397
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,830
It's Good.

398
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,240
Yeah.

399
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,990
These Are Too Heavy To Haul By Hand.

400
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,110
We're Gonna Have To Bring In A Forklift.

401
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,200
Hey,What A Cool Surprise.

402
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,400
Yeah,We Need To Talk.

403
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,850
About The Kiss.

404
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,770
Ok.

405
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,470
I'm Really Sorry That I Kissed You,Sock.

406
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,700
It Was Reckless And Selfish Of Me

407
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,120
And It'll Never Happen Again.

408
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,880
Selfish? What?

409
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,020
No. No,No,No. No,I Dug It.

410
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,160
Really?

411
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,820
Well,I Don't Actually Remember The Kiss

412
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,680
Because I Blacked Out.

413
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,090
But How I Felt Afterwards,

414
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,120
It Was Amazing,But Then Came The Crash.

415
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,550
There's A Reason For That.

416
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,360
Oh,Yeah?

417
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,790
I'm A Special Kind Of Demon.

418
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,170
Ok. A Succubus.

419
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,470
A Succu-What?

420
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,050
It Means I Feed On Human Life Force.

421
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,540
You Feel Really Great In The Short Term,

422
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,810
But Every Time I Kiss You,

423
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,190
It Sort Of Shaves About A Year Off Your Life.

424
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,410
Uh,But That Would Be The Ass-End Of My Life,Right?

425
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,620
The Crappy Years,Right?

426
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,400
I Really Like You,Sock.

427
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,780
That's Why It Can Never Happen Again.

428
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,780
Right. Right, That Makes Sense.

429
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,370
Yeah. Totally.

430
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,260
Totally Making Sense To Me Now.

431
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,060
I Mean,What Throwing Away A Year Of Your Life

432
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,340
For The Best High Anyone's Ever Felt?

433
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,920
That's Crazy! Yeah.

434
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,100
Stupid.

435
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,030
Ok,All Right,Look, I Have A Proposition For You.

436
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,030
Ok.

437
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,300
What If We Agree To Hook Up Once A Year?

438
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:58,980
You Think?

439
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,070
Because Then I Don't Have To Die Or Whatever Right Away

440
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,330
And We Both Get Our Fix.

441
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,260
That Could Work.

442
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,890
That Could Totally Work.

443
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,400
Good,Ok,Good,Aw.

444
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,130
So What Are You Doing For New Year's Then?

445
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,160
Nothing! Me Neither! Fantastible!

446
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,560
Ok,Good.

447
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,570
So That's Like What...

448
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,290
7 Months From Now?

449
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,890
Tony!

450
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,610
Hey,Sammy,You Bring The Rest Of The Supplies?

451
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,360
Yeah.

452
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,830
Hey,Can I--Can I Talk To You A Second?

453
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,930
Sure,Ok,Sure. Yeah, Step Into My Office.

454
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,110
Um,This Is Gonna Sound Really Weird,

455
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,530
But...I Think Steve's Been Appearing To Me.

456
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,600
There Was This Mold Stain On The Wall At Work

457
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,780
And Then I Saw Him In My Line At The Register

458
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,570
And Then In The Locker Room.

459
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,960
Steve Might Be Trying To...

460
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,560
Tony,Are You All Right?

461
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,310
You Think He Would Appear To You,Sam,And Not To Me?

462
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,170
Is That What You're Saying?

463
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,160
Tony,I-- I Don't Know.

464
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,170
I--Is There A Chance That He Might've Made It To Heaven?

465
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,380
That He's An Angel Again? Because...

466
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,080
Stop It,Sam.

467
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,080
You Don't Know What You're Talking About.

468
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,740
God's Capacity For Forgiveness,

469
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,340
A Capacity So Vast It's Beyond Mortal Comprehension,

470
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,230
Does Not,And Will Never, Extend To Demons.

471
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,740
I'm--You Know,I'm--I'm Sorry.

472
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,580
I'm Sorry,Sam.

473
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,430
Anyway,Let Me Get Back To Work.

474
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,120
Wait,Um, There's Actually--

475
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,670
There's One More Thing.

476
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,360
Yeah?

477
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,750
It Might Be Possible That The Devil

478
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,600
Might Already Know Your Plans Here.

479
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,650
It Might Be Possible?

480
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,910
Uh,Highly Probable.

481
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,580
He Made Me Tell Him What You Were Doing.

482
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,300
Tony,I'm So Sorry.

483
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,410
You Know What?

484
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,260
I Appreciate You Telling Me And It's All Right,Sam.

485
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,880
But Isn't Everything Gonna Be Ruined?

486
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,090
Not At All.

487
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,860
We Actually Assumed That You'd Share

488
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,850
This Information With The Devil.

489
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,720
That's Why We Didn't Tell You Everything.

490
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,280
We Pretty Much Have Been Lying To From The Very Beginning.

491
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,430
To Protect You.

492
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,220
That's Great.

493
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,160
I Thought You Were Gonna Kill Me When I Told You.

494
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,310
Things Are Going Exactly As Planned.

495
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,200
I Wouldn't Think About It For Another Minute.

496
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,390
All Right? All Right.

497
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,850
Hey You Guys See That Huge Wooden Beam Anywhere?

498
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,280
You Know What I'm Talking About?

499
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,250
Oh,I See It Right Here In My Arms.

500
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,130
Whatever,No Big Deal.

501
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,340
The Devil Said This Soul Can Really Predict The Future.

502
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,500
I Say We Test Her.

503
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,360
We Nail Her With The Vessel.

504
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,540
Uh-Huh, Good,Good,Good.

505
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,370
Did You Eat Like 16 Pixie Sticks?

506
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,860
Why Are Your Lips Still Flapping?

507
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,510
I Don't Want To Waste This Buzz,Guy.

508
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,200
Let's Go Rock And Roll!

509
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,890
Afternoon,Gentlemen.

510
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,150
Are You Here For A Reading?

511
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,740
Yeah. Yeah,We Are.

512
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,440
One Customer At A Time,Please.

513
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,100
Thank You.

514
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,480
Is This Your First Time?

515
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,280
Yep.

516
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,630
????

517
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,380
The Emperor.

518
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,180
This Often Symbolizes A Father Figure.

519
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,060
You've Recently Come Into Conflict With Your Father.

520
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,930
Good Guess.

521
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,190
The Ace Of Swords.

522
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,460
This Means Truth,Integrity.

523
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,190
But It's Inverted, Signifying Deceit.

524
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,610
A Lie Has Come Between You And Your Father.

525
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,730
What Kind Of Lie?

526
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,200
Death.

527
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,930
But Inverted Again.

528
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,580
The Lie Is About Your Birth.

529
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,730
The Devil Obscures The Truth Between You And Your Father.

530
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,250
What--What Is The Truth?

531
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,020
Are There Supposed To Be More Than One Of Those?

532
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,680
What Does That Mean?

533
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,720
It Means Our Session Is Over.

534
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,930
And I Am Not Going Back To Hell.

535
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,760
Sammy?

536
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,470
Sammy,You Dropped Your Baseball.

537
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,570
Oh,My God,Sam!

538
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,610
Sammy! What Do I Do? What Do I Do?

539
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,670
Sammy!

540
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,630
Uh,Thank You. Thank You.

541
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,160
Where's The Soul? Where'd She Go?

542
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,840
Back Door.

543
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,340
All Right, I'm Gonna Set You Down, You Catch Your Breath,

544
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,840
And Then We're Gonna Bag This Soul,All Right?

545
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,680
Oh,Sammy,Ok,I'm Sorry.

546
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,290
Oh,My God,All Right,Ok.

547
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,070
All Right. All Right,

548
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,770
Looks Like We're Bagging This Soul Together,Huh,Buddy?

549
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,780
Hop On! Oh!

550
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,760
Ok,Ok,All Right, Let's Go!

551
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,550
Sock...

552
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,790
????

553
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,890
She's Gone.

554
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,170
What Are We Gonna Do?

555
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,580
Uh,Uh,Hold On! Hold On!

556
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,000
Wait,Wait, Wait,Sock! Wait!

557
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,980
All Right.Gonn We Got It,Sammy.

558
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,410
We Got Her. She's Goin' Down.

559
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,940
Sock. How Are You Doing This?

560
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:00,850
I'd Loved To Explain It To You,

561
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,530
But I'm Afraid You'll Think Less Of Me,

562
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,560
But When She Told Me She Was Into Me,

563
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,540
I Couldn't Resist And Maybe I Was A Little Guilty

564
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,340
About That 'Cause It Was Kind Of Sexual But,Hell,

565
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,370
I Know What People Think Of Me,

566
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,680
They Think Sock Does A Bunch Of Drugs,

567
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,570
But This Is Really So New For Me!

568
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,970
Wait,Wait,Wait, Wait,Wait,Wait!

569
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,710
Turn Around,Turn Around,Turn Around!

570
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,560
Aah! Go! Go!

571
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,180
Sam?

572
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,110
Sock?

573
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,920
Yeah!

574
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,140
Yeah! Yeah!

575
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,210
Yeah!

576
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,210
You Carried Him On Your Shoulders?

577
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,160
For A Mile?

578
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,350
Maybe 2 It Might Have Been 5,I Don't Know.

579
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,220
Lost Track.

580
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,580
Right,Right,Right.

581
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,030
Yeah,I Was In The Zone,Benji.

582
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,240
Ever Heard Of It?

583
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,000
Adrenaline.

584
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,660
Focus.

585
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,850
I'm Detecting A Little Skepticism.

586
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:10,890
You're On Drugs.

587
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,040
Definitely Detecting Skepticism.

588
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,590
Listen To Me, You're On Drugs,

589
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,150
And You Need To Stop,Sock, Or I'm Telling Your Mom.

590
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,770
No,That's--Don't--Don't-- Don't Do That.

591
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,390
No,That's Hasty.

592
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,970
Well,Tell Me What The Hell's Going On.

593
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,250
All Right,Ok. Ahem.

594
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,540
It's Marlana.

595
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,570
You Know That Tasty Little Demon Treat?

596
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,490
I Don't Get It.

597
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,520
All Right,Listen. Listen To Me.

598
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,880
Don't...

599
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,670
Don't Tell Anybody.

600
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,160
When She Kisses You--

601
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:41,910
You Kissed Her?

602
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,030
Shh! Don't! Just Let Me!

603
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:49,670
When She Kisses You,It's Like The Most Unbelievable...

604
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,490
Smack!

605
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,410
No,Wrong Choice Of Words.

606
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,200
Rush. It's An Unbelievable Rush.

607
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,810
I Don't Even Know How To Describe It.

608
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,920
All I Know Is That One Kiss From Her

609
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,380
And I Felt Better Than I've Ever Felt In My Entire Life.

610
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,730
What Does That Even Mean?

611
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,500
Ok,Do You Know How Good You Feel When You Wear Your Bike Pants?

612
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,200
Yeah.

613
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,920
Yeah,It's Like That Times 20.

614
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,810
I Want A Taste.

615
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,670
I'm Really Glad You Called.

616
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,580
So Am I,So Am I.

617
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,600
I Know We Have To Be Careful,

618
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,450
But I Just Feel Such A Connection With You.

619
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,030
Yeah,Me,Too. I Know. I Know What You Mean. Yeah.

620
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,970
It's Crazy,Isn't It?

621
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,130
It Is Crazy.

622
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,000
Let Me Introduce You To My Friend Benjamin.

623
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:32,890
Hey.

624
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,340
Benjamin,This Is Marlana.

625
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,790
How You Doing?

626
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,620
Sock,What's Going On?

627
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,040
Uh,Well,I Just Thought That,Uh...

628
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:53,120
Maybe We Could Come To Some Kind Of Arrangement With....

629
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,640
I Don't Understand.

630
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,810
Ok,I Was Wondering If,Uh,

631
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,010
If You're Ok With It Obviously...

632
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,740
If,Uh,We Could Share This Good Thing

633
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,800
We Got Going On...

634
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,910
With Ben, My Very Good Friend,

635
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,120
Who Is Very Discreet,

636
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:19,140
And Who Is Also Very Full Of Life Like Me.

637
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,280
I Can--I Can Pay.

638
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,590
You Want Me To Kiss Him?

639
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,630
Well,I Want You To Want To Kiss Him.

640
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,920
I Can't Believe This.

641
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,600
What,No,What?

642
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,490
I Was Actually Interested In You!

643
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,550
Yeah,Well,Uh, Uh,Uh,Uh,Uh...

644
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,210
No Worries,You Tried.

645
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,820
Well,If It's Any Consolation,

646
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,330
I'll Probably Be Dead In 3 Years.

647
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,560
Well,This Is A Nice Surprise.

648
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,270
I Need To Know What You're Lying To Me About.

649
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,750
What?

650
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,160
There's Something You're Not Telling Me.

651
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,630
Some Lie. Some-- Something About My Birth.

652
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,820
About The Deal With The Devil.

653
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,720
Oh,Where Are You Getting This From?

654
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,210
From A Fortune Teller!

655
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,800
Well,Come On,Sam,You Should Know Better

656
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,190
Than To Trust One Of Those People Or Believe Anything They Say.

657
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,330
Everything Else She Said Was True.

658
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,100
And Now You're Having Secret Conversations

659
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,690
With Mom Inside Circles.

660
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,520
Dad,I Know What That Means.

661
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,190
I Am Not Lying About Anything.

662
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,620
Fine,Fine. I Want To Talk To Mom.

663
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,270
Well,She's Not Here.

664
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,890
I'll Wait.

665
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,940
What Do You Have To Bring Up All That For?

666
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,080
Why Are You Drudging Up The Past?

667
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,430
It's Not The Past,Dad. It's Happening Right Now!

668
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,830
Well,There's Nothing We Can Do About It,

669
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,160
Sam,Nothing We Can Change.

670
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,230
Come On. Things Aren't So Bad Now,Are They?

671
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,910
My Life Is At Risk Every Day

672
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,020
Because Of The Deal You And Mom Made.

673
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,960
I Know You Don't Like To Hear About Stuff Like That,

674
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,270
But It's The Truth.

675
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,760
Now I Want The Truth.

676
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,240
I Want To Know What's Going On!

677
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,180
You're Right,Sam.

678
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,990
You're Right.

679
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,840
There Is Something I Haven't Told You.

680
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,320
Something I'm Forbidden From Telling You.

681
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,420
I Wish I Could,Sam.

682
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,110
You Have No Idea How Much I Wish I Could.

683
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,150
But If I Did...

684
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,980
It Would All Fall Apart.

685
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,140
I'm So Sorry.

686
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,870
So Am I.

687
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,270
Tony,Hey.

688
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,570
Hey,Sam,Would You Mind Stopping By The Site?

689
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,560
We Have Something We'd Like To Show You.

690
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,330
Yeah,I Can Come Right Now.

691
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,490
I Have To Talk To You Anyway.

692
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,480
Perfect. We'll See You Soon.

693
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,790
Hey,Sam, Thanks For Coming.

694
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,270
Yeah.

695
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,750
How Do You Like It?

696
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,470
It's--It's Good.

697
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,460
Um,I Have To Talk To You.

698
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,940
I Had A Fight With My Dad

699
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,850
And There's Some Secret He's Not Telling Me.

700
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,010
Yes...We Know.

701
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,700
What?

702
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,060
Tony!

703
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,750
What Are You Doing?

704
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,120
I Take No Pleasure In This,Sam.

705
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,430
None At All.

706
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,200
Now,Come On. Get Me Out Of Here!

707
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,550
But You Had To Have Suspected.

708
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,170
After All This Time, You--You Must Know.

709
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,250
Know What?

710
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:02,420
You Are The Son Of Satan,Sam.

711
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,390
What?

712
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,730
Think About It.

713
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,870
Your Powers. Your Relationship To Him.

714
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,090
Your Parents Didn't Make A Deal For Your Soul.

715
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,050
They Made A Deal To Bear The Child Of Lucifer!

716
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,300
No.

717
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,500
No,It's Not True!

718
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,730
Every Page Referring To The Identity

719
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,520
Of Your Father In The Deal, Sam,Ripped Out!

720
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,120
Ripped Out.

721
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,050
They Were Trying To Hide The Truth From You.

722
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,080
No. Come On,Tony.

723
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,500
He's Not My Father!

724
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,520
He Is,Sam.

725
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,290
Fill It Up.

726
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,010
Tony,No!

727
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,670
Sam!

728
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,510
Sam!

729
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,830
Dad,I'm Down Here!

730
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,060
Sam? Sam,It's Gonna Be All Right.

731
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,680
Don't You Worry.

732
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,440
I'm Gonna Straighten All This Out Up Here.

733
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:11,900
Dad,Wait,Wait!

734
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,740
Hey,Listen,Guys,Uh,

735
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,370
We've Got A Little Bit Of A Misunderstanding Here,

736
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,190
But I Can Explain Everything.

737
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:22,120
Ok? Uh,So,Who's In Charge? Guys?

738
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:22,710
Who's In Charge?

739
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,420
I Just Need 5 Minutes To Bend Your Ear.

740
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,700
Tops.

741
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,670
Dad!

742
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,310
Tony,Just Come On, Just Let Him Go!

743
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,960
He's Got Nothing To Do With This!

744
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,110
Good-Bye,Sam.

745
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,340
Wait! Tony! You Know I'm Not Evil.

746
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,300
Why Would Steve Be Appearing To Me If I Was?

747
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,730
I Think He's Trying To Protect Me!

748
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,160
No,No,No. Do Not Mention His Name.

749
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,060
I'm Not Gonna Listen To Your Forked Tongue.

750
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,960
You Are The Reason That My Steven Is Dead!

751
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,680
I Blame You!

752
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,960
Fill It Up!

753
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,730
Wait,Wait,Tony,Cancun!

754
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:04,300
Uh,Cancun!

755
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,840
What Did You Say?

756
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,370
Steve Wanted Me To Ask You About Cancun.

757
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,150
What Does It Mean?

758
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,610
It's Where We Took Our First Vacation.

759
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,270
We Called It...

760
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,930
Heaven.

761
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,950
Steve?

762
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,610
You Made It? You Made It To Heaven?

763
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,870
It's Even Better Than Cancun.

764
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,510
We Can't Do This.

765
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,620
Uh! It's Ok,It's Ok.

766
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ok.

767
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,340
Dad!

768
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,670
Tony?

769
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,510
Hey,I Didn't Realize You Were Coming Over Tonight.

770
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,390
Sam?

771
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,700
Did You Call The Police,Sam?

772
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,960
No,I Didn't.

773
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,150
I Wanted To Talk To You First.

774
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,150
Good.

775
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,820
We'll Keep The Police Out Of This,Then.

776
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,320
Why?

777
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,560
How Would We Explain Your Father

778
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,540
Being Buried Alive In A Cage Covered With Mystic Symbols?

779
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,410
I Don't Know.

780
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,430
Because There's No Good Explanation...

781
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,270
Short Of The Terrible Truth.

782
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,750
No,Your Father Stays Buried.

783
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,800
Mom?

784
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,460
Was Dad My Real Father?

785
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,790
Of Course.

786
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,190
Sorry.

787
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,450
Tomorrow You Can Show Me Where Your Father Died.

788
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,370
I Would Like To Lay Some Flowers.

789
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,600
Sam?

790
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,910
I Just Wanted To Pay My Respects.

791
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,320
Please Accept My Condolences.

792
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,840
I Don't Believe You.

793
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,720
I Want You To Take Some Time Off.

794
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:05,390
Spend Time With Your Friends,With Your Girl.

795
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,090
We'll Both Know When You're Ready To Come Back.

796
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,700
All Right.

797
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,430
You Take Care Of Yourself,Kiddo.

798
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,510
Wait.

799
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,690
I Need To Ask You Something

800
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,920
And I Need To Know You're Giving Me A Straight Answer.

801
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,290
Oh,Look,Sammy,I Have Too Much Respect To Lie To You,

802
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,490
So I Tell You In Advance

803
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,660
That I Am Most Probably Going To Lie To You.

804
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,520
I'm The Devil,Sam,

805
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,710
Lying Is Kind Of Like My Whole Bag.

806
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,370
Yeah,Well, I Figured As Much.

807
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,940
Smart Boy.

808
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,330
You'd Think I'd Have The Perfect Words

809
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,080
To Make You Feel Better.

810
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,430
I Know,I Know.

811
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,610
I'm Really, Really Sorry.

812
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,300
It's Ok.

813
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,460
Hey,All Right, Let's Wrap This Up.

814
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,580
Listen To Me.

815
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,760
This Is The First And Last Time

816
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,160
You Will Ever Hear Me Say These Words,

817
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,340
But We Shouldn't Be Drinking Tonight.

818
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,390
Yep,So Come With Us.

819
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,020
Now.

820
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,360
Ok,All Right,Uh,Andi,

821
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,900
Do You Mind If I Just Go With The Guys?

822
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,160
No,Of Course Not.

823
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,270
Just Call Me Later.

824
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,690
All Right.

825
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,920
Bye,Andi.

826
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,360
Bye.

827
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,020
What Do You Think?

828
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,440
It's Beautiful.

829
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,700
We Figured Your Dad Didn't Get His Proper Send-Off.

830
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,440
You Know What,Sammy,

831
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,420
I Don't Know What To Tell You

832
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,470
To Make You Feel Better Right Now. I Don't.

833
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,640
But I Do Know How To Blow Stuff Up.

834
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,500
So,I Figured Play To My Strengths,Right?

835
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,320
Thank You.

836
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,220
You're Welcome.

837
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,270
I Need To Tell You Guys Something.

838
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,880
Turns Out The Devil Might Be My Dad.

839
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,560
Evidently,I'm Destined To End The World.

840
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,850
I Can't Let That Happen.

841
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,470
Well,You Know What?

842
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,940
You're Not Really Very Good At Anything,

843
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,830
So You'd Probably Screw That Up,Too.

844
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,500
Thanks.

845
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,200
If You're The Devil's Son, Why Did Tony Save You?

846
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,400
Yeah.

847
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,180
He Said He Saw Steve And He Just...

848
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,280
He Knew He Couldn't Kill Me,

849
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,020
That God Had Another Plan.

850
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,240
Well,That's Good, Right?

851
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,520
No. Those Other Demons They're Not Gonna Stop.

852
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,700
They're Gonna Keep Coming Until I'm Dead.

853
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,990
You're A Marked Man.

854
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,590
So,I Get It,

855
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,160
I Understand If You Guys Can't Hang Out Anymore.

856
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,610
I Am Sorry,Sam.

857
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,900
But We Are Not Here To Listen To You

858
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,170
Whine About Which Dark Army

859
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,680
Has Marked You For Death. Ok?

860
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,070
We Are Here Right Now To Honor The Passing Of The Man

861
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:51,540
Who May Or May Not Have Been Your Biological Father.

862
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,560
Well Said,Sock.

863
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,320
Thank You.

864
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,420
I Recommend Lighting The Right Foot

865
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,650
And Then Running Like Hell.

866
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,310
Aah! Damn It!
