Previously on Reaper...

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:04,795
Is this a carjacking?
Are you carjacking me?

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,135
I'm the Devil!

4
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:11,833
Before you were born, your mom
and I sold your soul to the devil.

5
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:15,095
Going to bring escaped souls
back to hell. That's cool, right?

6
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:18,307
- How am I supposed to capture them?
- This will help. A vessel.

7
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:23,681
Place the vessel on the mat.

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,750
So they're not all little vacuums?

9
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,545
The boss gives you the vessel
he thinks you can handle.

10
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:35,690
You must be a real moron.

11
00:00:35,877 --> 00:00:38,342
Explain to me how you chopped

12
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:40,180
some guy's head off!

13
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:42,321
When a soul escapes from hell,
I have to capture it.

14
00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:44,728
What you saw us doing the other day
that was an escaped soul.

15
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:46,660
- Works for the devil.
- Tony is a demon.

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,231
He's a demon from hell.

17
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:52,875
- I believe you.
- You are the son of Satan, Sam.

18
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:55,051
Evidently,
I'm destined to end the world.

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,636
Well, you're not really
very good at anything,

20
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:01,497
so, you'll probably screw that up, too.

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,114
Way to go, Sam.

22
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,781
I don't accept failure.

23
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:08,017
Ever.

24
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:11,095

00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:14,720

you this letter instead of calling you.

00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:18,875

"you'd convince me to come home.

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,314
"But I still need time to reflect
on my father's death,

28
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,882
"had my soul sold out
from underneath me,

29
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:27,564

hunter for hell.

"But every time I hit a rough patch,

31
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:32,040
I think of you and I continue on,
because"...

32
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:34,268
- What the hell are you guys reading?
- What?

33
00:01:35,092 --> 00:01:38,471
Is that the letter I wrote to Andi?
Sock, you were supposed to mail that.

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,269
What, dude, I forgot. I'm sorry.
Wait, that was in

35
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:45,184
Tahoe, right? Because in my own defense,
I forgot my name in Tahoe.

36
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:47,552
You guys, Andi thought we were
going to be gone for 2 weeks.

37
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:50,296
It's been 4 weeks, sock,
and she doesn't know where we are!

38
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,936
Look, this is not a problem.
We hop in the car right now,

39
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:55,405
drive 90 the whole way there.
We'll be there in 2 days, tops.

40
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:58,436
Unless we go to sea world.

41
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,713
OK, no sea world, fine.

Wait,

46
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:27,187
so where did we land on the whole
telling Andi i'm the devil's son thing?

47
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,402
I think we decided
that she would be shocked,

48
00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:32,025
then confused, and then she'd
probably stab you in the face.

49
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:34,027
- Right.
- Don't tell her, Sam.

50
00:02:34,232 --> 00:02:37,197
Not now. I mean, we have to figure
out what it all means first.

51
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:39,685
Yeah, but I don't want to
keep another secret from her.

52
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,025
You want to bring her a bag of chips?
A little

53
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,590
- salt and vinegar to say I'm sorry?
- Sock! No, shut up.

54
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:49,703
- Yeah, all right.
- That a boy. Now you're thinking.

55
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,068
Got something for you.

56
00:03:17,017 --> 00:03:18,613
They evicted you from your apartment.

57
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,066
I went by and got whatever I could.

58
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:27,025
- Thank you.
- The answering machine's probably full.

59
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,617
I mean, I left a ton of messages,
which you can ignore now.

60
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:34,754
Andi, I'm so sorry, OK? I wrote you
this letter, but sock forgot to mail it.

61
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:40,002
You gave Sock a letter?
To mail?

62
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,680
Well, yeah.

63
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:45,190
OK, well let me ask you this.

64
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:50,847
If there was an emergency,
let's say life or death situation.

65
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:53,147
Would you call Sock?

66
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:56,162
Probably not.

67
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:58,886
Say you wanted somebody to
make you a piece of toast.

68
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:00,927
- Would you call Sock?
- I would not, no.

69
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:02,595
Well, gee, Samn, thanks.

70
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:06,768
I mean, I feel really valued that you
would give the most responsible person

71
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:09,824
a letter to mail me
so I don't worry about you.

72
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:14,184
- I... put a stamp on it myself.
- It doesn't even matter.

73
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,957
But there is one bit of...

74
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:23,104
One bit of information.
Ted fired the three of you.

75
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,266
And is going to have you arrested if you
trespass and show your face around here.

76
00:04:29,113 --> 00:04:30,341
I don't care about that.

77
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:32,656
No, you don't really
care about anything, do you?

78
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,878
You know, welcome back.

79
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:38,976
Come on!

80
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:44,577
No money, job...

81
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:46,844
Place to live.

82
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,874
My girlfriend froze me out pretty hard.

83
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:52,790
My crimper!
I thought I lost this.

84
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:57,629
Yeah, I use a crimper sometimes, OK?
It adds to my mystique.

85
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:00,938
I'm gonna say it. I'm glad
we got evicted. That place ate it.

86
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:03,411
Now we can finally rent a mansion like
we always talked about.

87
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,813
We never talked about that.

88
00:05:04,964 --> 00:05:07,854
Sock, we don't have jobs
and we can't rent anything.

89
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:10,323
OK, uncle Sam.
Suggestions?

90
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:14,521
I don't know. Maybe should just all live
in one of our parents' houses for now.

91
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:16,342
We can't stay at my grandmom's house.

92
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:18,477
She's getting pretty senile.
She just bought a gun.

93
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:20,826
OK, so that's a no. Sock, you?
What's your deal?

94
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:24,253
What? No, forget about it. My new
lame step-dad lives there, Morris.

95
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:27,200
Yeah, he's probably having sex
with your mom all the time.

96
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:31,363
They don't do that.
My mom doesn't even have a...

97
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:35,266
- She doesn't no. OK, no.
- Sure, Sock.

98
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,097
You know what?

99
00:05:38,597 --> 00:05:41,107
You guys are right. We should
move back in to my place to stop

100
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:44,184
any and all boot-knocking
activities forever. Let's go.

101
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:49,180
Mama!It's little sock puppet
here to move back in.

102
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:54,991
Ma, come on, open the door.

103
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:58,100
You're making me look dumb
in front of my friends.

104
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:04,058
- What do you want?
- Who... are you?

105
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:07,387
- Who are you?
- I'm Sock. Open the door.

106
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:11,607
What why don't you go get my mom for me?

107
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:14,309
- Who's your mom?
- Judy Wysocki.

108
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:16,678
So open the door.

109
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:18,876
No one mentioned any Sock.

110
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:23,118
I find that hard to believe.
My mom brags about me all the time.

111
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:25,461
She didn't mention a little Sock monkey?

112
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,219
Johann Sebastian Sock?

113
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:29,923
Sock-rates.

114
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:33,472
All right, well,
looks like we're sleeping in my car.

115
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:34,418
Never.

116
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:36,679
We just slept in Sam's car for 4 weeks.

117
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,396
Well, never again.

118
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:55,323
You are a problem solver.

119
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,901
Gents, the work bench
is our oyster to be shucked.

120
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:00,743
- What aisle are the cots in?
- Aisle 10.

121
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:02,665
What aisle are the blankets
and pillows in?

122
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,810
- Aisle 5.
- No. Not those crappy foam ones.

123
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,372
- The down ones.
- Aisle 6.

124
00:07:06,497 --> 00:07:08,581
- All right whisky?
- Ted's office bottom left drawer.

125
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:11,479
Good, let's rock and roll.
I want to go to aisle 16.

126
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:13,474
- What's there?
- New doors.

127
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:16,223
Safety first. I like it, Sam.
Good thinking.

128
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:30,141
Well, would you look at that?
The prodigal son has returned.

129
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:32,180
I'm just kidding.

130
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:36,945
I knew the real prodigal son, you know.
The dude was an ass.

131
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,202
Super needy.

132
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:42,502
So welcome home, buddy.

133
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,254
So tell me all about your big trip.

134
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:48,726
- It was good.
- That's it, good?

135
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:53,049
I let you take a month off, and you just
come back with good? Come on, details,

136
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,139
details.

137
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,575
Yeah, we drove almost
all the way to Texas.

138
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:01,525
Yeah... Spent a bunch of quality
time with Sock and Ben.

139
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,267
- Of course, of course.
- Did a lot of thinking.

140
00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:07,121
I gotta tell you, man,
you trip sounds like a real snore-fest.

141
00:08:07,246 --> 00:08:09,169
Did you at least get a hooker in Reno?

142
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:12,534
Well, I guess we all make mistakes.

143
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:14,928
Regardless,

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,016
vacation's over.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,081
Take a peek.

146
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:24,408
What the hell is this?

147
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:27,507
The man with
the ink is derrick mccarthy.

148
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,037
In life, he was a gang leader,
cop killer,

149
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:33,109
and general all-around psycho
with a thirst for violence.

150
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,017
As you can see.

151
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,820
For you.
A little welcome home gift.

152
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,157
You look like a fairy princess.

153
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:56,462
- What is it?
- A cattle prod.

154
00:08:57,118 --> 00:09:00,378
You know, it may not look impressive,
but it packs quite a zap.

155
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:03,642
And I'm supposed to catch
that behemoth with just this?

156
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,280
Of course not, don't be silly.

157
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:09,297
You're supposed to catch
all those behemoths with that.

158
00:09:09,544 --> 00:09:11,108
- All of them?!
- Hey, man.

159
00:09:11,876 --> 00:09:13,718
You're the one that wanted
to go on vacation.

160
00:09:15,874 --> 00:09:19,840
That's impossible. There's gotta be
20 souls there. I cannot catch 20 souls!

161
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,507
Hey, check this out.

162
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:35,214
This soul leaped over the witness stand
and then proceeded to bludgeon

163
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:37,954
both the judge and the bailiff to death

164
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:40,614
before the courtroom
officer was able to intervene.

165
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:44,015
Oh, my god, check this out. Look, look.
Nickname cme cobra snake.

166
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,297
He used to gouge his enemy's eyes out
and then set them on fire.

167
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:52,128
Sweet mother.
Wish my Nickname: Cobra snake.

168
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,476
It just gets worse and worse. Every soul
here is a heartless, brutal killer.

169
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:59,413
There's no way we can get all these
guys. What are we going to do?

170
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:01,849
- Ted?
- What do you mean, Ted?

171
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:09,009
This is just too perfect.
My moment of triumph.

172
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:11,192
Not only do I get to
fire you to your faces,

173
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:14,794
but I get to charge you with breaking
and entering, vandalizing merchandise,

174
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,775
and what's that other one?
Oh, yeah. Trespassing.

175
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:20,255
Ted, wait!
Hold on.

176
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,213
This is stupid!
Please don't cal the cops!

177
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:26,006
As manager of this store
it is my responsibility, Samuel.

178
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:29,430
That I take a great deal
of joy in doing so is only a perk.

179
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,228
Go ahead, Ted. Call the cops.
See if I give a care.

180
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:36,005
I'll just have to call
work bench corporate on you.

181
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,429
Sure they'd love to hear all about
a certain doctor Doggie door.

182
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:43,326
Yeah, I know that you and the doctor
are one in the Same, Ted.

183
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:46,581
Question is, does corporate know?
I don't think so. I don't think they do.

184
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:49,522
See, they don't have any idea
that you buy Doggie door

185
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:52,233
as a store discount
and then resell them for profit.

186
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,654
You know what, call corporate.
I'll get a slap on the wrist.

187
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:58,022
Maybe so.

188
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,324
But is...

189
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:03,619
professor Sum Pump
willing to take the fall?

190
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:07,150
I don't know.

191
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,097
What about, Mr. Heating, ventilation and
air conditioning? My personal favorite.

192
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:14,306
Or how about Senor Trampoline?

193
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:24,348
- See you at work tomorrow?
- We'll be running a little late.

194
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:26,387
Great. Take your time.

195
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,412
So it begins.

196
00:11:35,537 --> 00:11:38,621
My back is killing me.
I feel like death.

197
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:42,960
Benji, how come you look so fresh
and so clean?

198
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:44,095
Whore's bath.

199
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:48,001
This is no way to live!

200
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,353
Hey, someone clock in for me.
I'll be back in a few hours.

201
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,375
- Hi. How you doing?
- Hey, sorry.

202
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:57,246
Andi, hey. We got our jobs back.

203
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,058
- How did you convince Ted to do that?
- Blackmail.

204
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:06,578
I was wondering if you wanted to go get
lunch maybe later.

205
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,227
How long are you going to be mad at me?!

206
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,973
Have a great first day, guys.

207
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,318
Here you go.

208
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:15,776
What is this?

209
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,978
This will make you feel better,
about Andi.

210
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:20,613
I'm sorry,
I can't go any higher than five.

211
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:27,791
Hey, you, girl living in my house!
Open the door!

212
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:33,857
OK, all right. OK, you want to play
it like that? I can play it like that.

213
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,522
I'm just gonna bust in there
and take back my throne.

214
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:48,092
Oh, my god!
The stairs!

215
00:12:53,144 --> 00:12:54,302
Are you OK?

216
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:58,686
No. I'm not OK.
I have a squatter living in my home!

217
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:02,976
- I'm not really a squatter.
- Deny it yeah, I dare you to.

218
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:06,374
Try and tell me it's not my right to
move back into the cradle of my birth.

219
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:07,525
Oh, god!

220
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:09,509
You're completely right.

221
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,206
Yeah, I am. I know.

222
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,854
I talk to your mom.
She cleared everything up.

223
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:19,134
I knew about bert,
but I did not know bert was Sock.

224
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,658
Yeah, yeah, bert is Sock.
Sock is me. Who are you?

225
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:25,279
I'm Kristin.
Your sister.

226
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,222
My what?

227
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,459
So you're housesitting
while they're honeymooning?

228
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:35,034
This is so strange to wake up
one day and suddenly have a brother.

229
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,261
- Yeah, it's crazy.
- I mean,

230
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:40,818
I always thought my brother
would be shorter with different hair,

231
00:13:41,306 --> 00:13:43,427
and, maybe much more Asian.

232
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,240
I can squint for you,
but that would be offensive, wouldn't t?

233
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,943
Yes, that would be very offensive.

234
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:53,353
Hey, let me check out that knee,
see how it looks.

235
00:13:54,443 --> 00:13:55,485
If you gotta.

236
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:57,960
You know,
meeting like this is sorta cool.

237
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,119
'cause when you're a kid,
you fight with your siblings, right?

238
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:04,645
But we've skipped over that whole
teasing part and now

239
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:07,097
- we can just be buds.
- Yeah!

240
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:10,139
This is gonna be fun.
I got. I have a sister!

241
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:17,634
A sister, a sister, a sister.

242
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:21,216
- I think you'll live.
- Great!

243
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,852
- So what do you think?
- I think it's suicide.

244
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:34,190
You could probably vessel one or two
souls, maybe even three if you're lucky.

245
00:14:34,315 --> 00:14:37,066
But there's 20 dudes in there.
They're gonna tear us apart.

246
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:39,204
I have no idea what to do.

247
00:14:40,477 --> 00:14:42,713
And Sock has his thinking face on.

248
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,318
What do you got, buddy?

249
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,894
Do you guys think it's OK
for me to date my sister?

250
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:53,319
- Your sister? The one you just met?
- I can't get her out of my head.

251
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:56,677
She's so sultry and exotic, you know.
I don't know.

252
00:14:57,215 --> 00:14:59,685
I guess you two aren't
really related, so...

253
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:03,075
- You're biologically safe.
- It's still iffy though.

254
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,689
What if you make a move on her
and she says no? Then you're spending

255
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:08,172
every Christmas
with your sister who shot you down.

256
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:10,957
No, you're right. Thank you.

257
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:13,407
That could be awkward.
Maybe I just test the waters a little.

258
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:16,927
Dip my toe in the pool,
let the ripples permeate.

259
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,530
Sammy! Toss it to me! Come here!

260
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,884
Shame on you for bringing a board to
the battle, my man. That's dirty pool.

261
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:40,002
Take that!
Take this!

262
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,922
Technical problem!

263
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,109
- Sock, get him!
- You can't rush this, Sam!

264
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,916
We gotta fight 20 more guys like that?

265
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:18,991
Run!

266
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:27,866
A vessel that needs to recharge.
Very nice.

267
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:31,559
Yeah sort of like going into battle with
a gun that shoots bullets sometimes.

268
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,719
Hi, roomies.

269
00:16:34,496 --> 00:16:36,792
- Hi, big bro.
- Hey, sis.

270
00:16:39,268 --> 00:16:41,621
- Oh, my god. She's so hot.
- Smokin'.

271
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,982
Shut your mouth! That is my sister.

272
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:46,864
- I got dibs.
- This thing is useless.

273
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:49,256
The Devil set me up. He wants me to die.

274
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:51,550
Why would he want to kill his own son?

275
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:55,293
Wait.
He's your father.

276
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,127
So?

277
00:16:57,252 --> 00:16:59,455
Why don't you try to use
that to your advantage?

278
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,763
Just ask dear old dad for a favor
to get you out of this mess.

279
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,998
Right. Also, ask him for a boat.

280
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:07,124
I don't think he cares
if I'm his son or not.

281
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:09,853
He's never tried to make
things easier on me before.

282
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:11,987
Doesn't hurt to ask.

283
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,569
You're probably right. I should just

284
00:17:14,694 --> 00:17:16,971
I should try figure
out how to get in touch with him.

285
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:18,836
Wait.

286
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:21,789
Is she starting at me?

287
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:23,468
Certainly is.

288
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:30,028
Oh, my god!
I knew it.

289
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:33,503
I knew it. She's falling for me.
She wants the full package.

290
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,505
- What's up?
- We...

291
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,733
Screwed up a little bit on
the road trip that we took with Sam.

292
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,596
He wrote you a letter.

293
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:54,332
And somebody forgot to mail it.

294
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,901
Who that somebody is is not important,
but it was ben.

295
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:05,073
We rember...
A lot of what Sam wrote

296
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:08,252
in the letter, and
we figured we'd read it back to you

297
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:11,970
and maybe you'd stop being mad at him.
So, "dear Andi"

298
00:18:12,572 --> 00:18:13,851
you're really pretty.

299
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:17,356
I can't wait to get back
and stare into your something eyes."

300
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:19,543
- Brown. We got brown.
- Brown eyes, brown. Brown.

301
00:18:19,673 --> 00:18:22,547
We couldn't remember that part.
"I can't wait to get back and stare

302
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:26,531
into your brown eyes.
Also, your hair is soft."

303
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,097
Yeah, check on that.

304
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:33,120
"I have some stuff to
say about feelings."

305
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,042
OK, you...

306
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,382
"i have some stuff to say
that's romantic."

307
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:39,817
- "I Miss you so much.
- love, Sam."

308
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:41,657
You guys, I see what you're doing.

309
00:18:41,782 --> 00:18:44,945
OK. It's really sweet,
and I appreciate you trying to help.

310
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,319
- But this is really between me and Sam.
- All right but for whatever it's worth,

311
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:52,453
you should know that he's really,
really, torn up about this.

312
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,117
Yeah. So am i.

313
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:58,084
And furious. And

314
00:18:58,424 --> 00:19:01,260
sad and happy.
All at the same time.

315
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:04,269
Oh, my god, that's exactly how
I feel when I eat indian food.

316
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:07,877
Listen, it's just.
It's really complicated.

317
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:13,906
But I love the letter, though.
And it makes me smile, so thanks.

318
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:18,030
That's a really great pen.
I'm just gonna take that back.

319
00:19:18,405 --> 00:19:19,405
Sure.

320
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:31,429
"I summon you, satan,
"i summon you from your infernal depths

321
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,902
"to appear before
me in this earthly realm."

322
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:44,076
- It worked!
- Not so much, sport.

323
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:47,810
I just wanted to tell you that your
pentagram is actually a star of David.

324
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:49,403
Mazal tov!

325
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,299
Well,

326
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:56,151
as long as you're here, I was
wondering if I could ask you a favor.

327
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:59,464
Not a favor, but a request.
A family request.

328
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,460
Holy crap, where did you get this book?

329
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:04,100
"The Devil is attracted to radishes."

330
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:06,490
What does that mean?
Like, sexually?

331
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:09,593
That's disgusting.
Where did they get that?

332
00:20:09,728 --> 00:20:13,258
Listen, I was thinking, given our
special relationship, that maybe...

333
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:16,508
You could lighten my workload a bit.

334
00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:18,772
Our special relationship?

335
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:21,942
You know, maybe take a few souls
off my hands, like 10 or 15.

336
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:26,128
All of them, if you wanted to.

337
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:30,810
Well, first of all, let me say, I like
that you're playing the nepotism card.

338
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:35,413
It shows a certain moral disregard
that I find utterly charming.

339
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:38,081
And secondly, I have to say no.

340
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,530
Your duties and obligations
remain status quo.

341
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:42,734
But why?

342
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,893
Let me give you a little history
lesson, Sam. I have been soiling

343
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:50,171
pure, innocent maidens
since the beginning of time.

344
00:20:51,907 --> 00:20:54,907
I have sired many, many, many
children on this godforsaken planet,

345
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:57,290
hoping that each

346
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:00,975
would finally be the one who
would bring about hell on earth.

347
00:21:02,014 --> 00:21:05,015
But no, they all turn out to be duds.

348
00:21:05,758 --> 00:21:07,252
Every single one of them.

349
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:11,031
So I will say to you what I say to them.

350
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,780
Stop whining, and do your job.

351
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,928
Yeah, but you've given me a
stupid recharging cattle prod.

352
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:19,046
How am I supposed to
catch 20 souls with that?

353
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:21,182
To be precise,
it's not 20 souls anymore.

354
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:23,509
It's 40.

355
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:29,866
You're trying to kill me.

356
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:31,997
Why are you trying to kill me?

357
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:34,081
You're supposed to be my father.

358
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,236
Well, even in the wild,
parents kill their young.

359
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:42,810
Yeah, look at hyenas, bears.

360
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:45,345
And that's not that big a deal.

361
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,590
This is unbelievable.
This I don't believe this.

362
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,229
All I'm saying is...

363
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:52,088
You're not as special as
you think you are, buddy.

364
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,011
Don't you forget that.

365
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:59,226
Either you figure this thing
out and save your skin...

366
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,623
Or you're a dud, too.

367
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:11,329
Kinda countin'on dud.
I'm just sayin'.

368
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,698
There's no benefit to being
the devil's son at all?

369
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,494
Apparently he's got a ton of kids,
and he thinks they all suck.

370
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:26,254
- Mr. Handley.
- What?

371
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:30,279
Mr. Handley, my fifth grade gym teacher.
He used to throw baseballs at my head.

372
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:34,014
It's the reason why I have migraines.
I bet he's one of the devil's kids.

373
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:36,545
Anybody thirsty?

374
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,494
We got a million souls to catch
tomorrow, and you want to drink?

375
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:43,431
Sam-a-lam-a-ding-dong.
This, my friend, is inspiration.

376
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:45,977
OK, we are three highly
intelligent males.

377
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,497
She no reason we can't figure out how to
capture these Jerks and not get killed.

378
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:51,312
Just need a little thinking elixir.

379
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,040
If we gotta pull an all-nighter,
we gotta pull an all-nighter,

380
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,680
we may not have gone to college, boys,
we certainly cram like people who did.

381
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,387
Bottom's up.

382
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:03,603
I like it.
I like it.

383
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:06,423
Let's cram this one out.
All right, let's think.

384
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:08,863
- Think, think.
- This is working. It's working already.

385
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,379
Got it. Got it, got it, got it.

386
00:23:13,907 --> 00:23:16,302
We drive a train through
the front of the warehouse,

387
00:23:16,427 --> 00:23:18,318
capture all the souls in the rubble.

388
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:21,293
Yeah, I don't think there's train
tracks going through the warehouse,

389
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:23,309
but good try.

390
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:27,728
Well, cramming is hard. I hate college.

391
00:24:02,637 --> 00:24:03,815
We're gonna be late.

392
00:24:05,756 --> 00:24:08,958
- My hair hurts.
- We crammed, boys.

393
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:10,481
We crammed hard.

394
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,700
Well, it didn't help us any,
and I can barely move.

395
00:24:16,318 --> 00:24:19,039
- You all right, ben?
- I just had a really loud thought.

396
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:20,633
What was that?

397
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:24,488
What if we got the souls really drunk?

398
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:26,754
- What?
- Hey, that's not.

399
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:30,021
That's not a bad idea. And then when
they're sluggish and stupid, we pounce!

400
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:34,997
Our all-nighter paid off.
We are college men!

401
00:24:35,587 --> 00:24:37,652
There's definitely enough
beer in that truck.

402
00:24:38,735 --> 00:24:41,544
Guys, this is wrong. It's stealing.

403
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:44,650
Sometimes in order to do something good,
you have to do something bad first.

404
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,881
I want you to keep that in mind when
I eventually make love to your mother.

405
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:53,230
All right, let's go, let's move.

406
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:57,402
Go! Eyes on the prize,
eyes on the prize! Quick, get the door!

407
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:12,608
Can I help you?

408
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,561
This isn't my truck at all.
I was, delivering bread next door

409
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:19,307
and I hopped back into this
one thinking it was mine. Same color.

410
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,749
Yeah! Let's steal some beer, Sammy!

411
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:29,196
I'm gonna...

412
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,028
All right, guys.

413
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:40,449
I think I'm finished with the beer logo.
Come check it out. Come look.

414
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:47,616
Our beer mascot is a baby?
Isn't that sort of dumb?

415
00:25:48,108 --> 00:25:50,964
No, that's not. It's not a baby.
It's a leprechaun.

416
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:53,647
Where's his hat?

417
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:57,304
He took it off. It's impolite to have it
on when you're drinking.

418
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:01,345
- Why is he wearing a bib?
- OK! It's a baby! Jeez.

419
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:04,271
It's all I know how to draw.
Are you happy now?

420
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,546
Very.
Thank you for that.

421
00:26:20,023 --> 00:26:21,547
Andi, please wait.

422
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:25,243
You absolutely right. I shouldn't have
ever given sock the letter to mail. I...

423
00:26:25,655 --> 00:26:28,452
- maybe I was just avoiding the issue.
- Avoiding what?

424
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:31,965
- Avoiding me?
- No, avoiding my life.

425
00:26:32,995 --> 00:26:36,217
You know, I couldn't face it anymore.
Working for the devil, my dad dying...

426
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,053
That's something we could
have faced together, Sam.

427
00:26:39,178 --> 00:26:41,281
But you don't think of us that way.

428
00:26:41,628 --> 00:26:43,760
I mean, instead of coming
to me with your problems,

429
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:47,011
you took a month-long bender
with your buddies. You ran away.

430
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:50,049
Yeah, I wasn't running away from you,
I was running away from the devil!

431
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:52,038
You know what,
I can't tell the difference.

432
00:26:52,163 --> 00:26:55,138
- I'm really, really sorry.
- You know that I thought you were dead?

433
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:59,980
No, it would have made sense, right?
When your life is always in danger.

434
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:04,494
When you guys disappeared I just thought
that one of the souls finally got you.

435
00:27:04,726 --> 00:27:07,272
You have every right to be upset,
but I swear to you,

436
00:27:07,397 --> 00:27:10,330
I will never put you in that
position again. I promise.

437
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:15,162
You said it yourself, Sam.
I mean, you work for the devil.

438
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:19,516
No matter how many times you try to run
from it, it's never going to change.

439
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:23,255
So when you promise to
never make me worry again,

440
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,611
it's a promise you can't really keep.

441
00:27:37,335 --> 00:27:39,980
- Man, I hope they take the bait.
- How could they not?

442
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:44,256
Free beer,
giant beer baby enticing them, right?

443
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:45,634
Who could resist?

444
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,240
Hey, how much did all that beer cost?

445
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:51,974
Don't worry about the cost, Benji.
It's no object.

446
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:55,228
Also, work bench paid for it.
Corporate card.

447
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:58,429
- The hell did you get a corporate card?
- You know what, weirdly,

448
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:01,823
in the lost and found bin.
Place is a goldmine. Check it out.

449
00:28:02,788 --> 00:28:05,098
- Right?
- Guess all we have to do is wait.

450
00:28:07,027 --> 00:28:09,891
Hey, hey, FYI. We,

451
00:28:11,003 --> 00:28:14,023
sorta talked to Andi,
sort of softened her up a little bit.

452
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:16,870
I think, everything's fixed, yeah?

453
00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:20,114
Yeah, well, FYI.
I talked to her, too, and...

454
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,865
She's still really, really mad.

455
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:25,951
Well, ben talked mostly to her.

456
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,035
I don't understand. What's the problem?
Why can't you two just...

457
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,519
Work it out, you know?

458
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:34,448
Because she's actually not wrong.
I mean, the way my life's been going,

459
00:28:34,573 --> 00:28:37,216
the next time I disappear.
I probably will be dead.

460
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,974
I mean,
it's always going to be like this.

461
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:45,378
- I don't know if she can handle it.
- Sounds hopeless.

462
00:28:47,968 --> 00:28:50,515
I pretty much came to
that same conclusion myself.

463
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,084
Are you two gonna split up?

464
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:00,650
I don't. I knew it. I knew they'd
take the bait. Look at that.

465
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:03,198
It's only a matter of time before
they're passed out and pacified.

466
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,174
Let's just hope they're
not angry drunks.

467
00:29:27,823 --> 00:29:29,501
It worked. They're out cold.

468
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,902
Yeah, they even drank all the zimas.

469
00:29:32,258 --> 00:29:34,161
It's kind of a shame
they gotta go back to hell.

470
00:29:34,286 --> 00:29:36,099
I'd like to party with these guys.

471
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:44,336
All right.

472
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:48,385
- You think this is going to hold?
- I was a cub scout, Sam.

473
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,577
- I excelled in knot tying.
- Didn't they kick you out of scouts?

474
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:53,831
It was a very political organization.

475
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:55,914
All right, let's do this.

476
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,139
There you go. There you go, slowly.

477
00:30:17,698 --> 00:30:19,558
We're getting close to the end here.

478
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:03,266
Hi. I just gotta get some water.
You need anything?

479
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,582
- What the hell is this?
- Run, Sammy, run! Go!

480
00:31:42,546 --> 00:31:43,800
He's getting away!

481
00:31:57,008 --> 00:31:59,034
I can't watch, Benji,
tell me what happens!

482
00:32:11,794 --> 00:32:13,163
Good job, Sammy!

483
00:32:26,774 --> 00:32:28,433
Oh, man!

484
00:32:58,897 --> 00:33:00,621
Yeah! You did it, Sam!

485
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:03,405
You did it, Sam!
We're coming down now, OK?

486
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:14,584
Just...

487
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:17,489
Hold on, OK?
I wasn't really with these guys.

488
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:20,455
You know, so, i'm cool.
Man, you and me? We're cool.

489
00:33:21,031 --> 00:33:24,600
I mean, actually I thank you, because
these dudes are actually kind of crazy.

490
00:33:24,888 --> 00:33:26,759
What do you mean,
you weren't with these guys?

491
00:33:26,884 --> 00:33:29,915
When I escaped from hell, I just kind of
went them. I figured safety in numbers.

492
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,953
But this whole sleeping together in
the same warehouse thing, I mean...

493
00:33:33,172 --> 00:33:35,128
- What's up with that?
- Whatever.

494
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:38,009
You're supposed to go to hell, and
I'm supposed to send you there, so...

495
00:33:38,134 --> 00:33:39,137
Sorry.

496
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:47,504
It worked! I don't believe it.

497
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:52,278
It worked. I don't believe it, i'm free.
Do it again. Do it again!

498
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:56,355
What the...

499
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
I'm out!

500
00:34:04,331 --> 00:34:05,604
I beat the devil!

501
00:34:06,206 --> 00:34:08,706
- Wait, wait, wait, what?!
- I beat your boss, baby.

502
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:11,204
I sold my soul to the devil,
and I got out of the deal.

503
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:12,396
I'm free.

504
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:16,477
He owned your soul? He owns my soul!
How the hell did you get out of it?

505
00:34:16,906 --> 00:34:18,158
He owns your soul?

506
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:20,431
That's a bummer for you,
man, but not for me.

507
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:22,668
Tell me how the hell you got out of it!

508
00:34:23,164 --> 00:34:25,654
Just no more electrocutions, OK? Just...

509
00:34:26,826 --> 00:34:29,332
- hand me that, and I'll tell you.
- How?

510
00:34:32,723 --> 00:34:33,612
Gullible.

511
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:44,748
- We should talk.
- I know, I know.

512
00:34:46,943 --> 00:34:49,683
Look, Sam, every way I look
at this relationship, it's...

513
00:34:50,477 --> 00:34:52,302
I just don't think it's gonna work out.

514
00:34:52,427 --> 00:34:55,466
I was thinking that same thing!
Last night I broke up with you.

515
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,031
That weird?

516
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:08,465
- What is this?
- Somehow, some way, this soul

517
00:35:09,279 --> 00:35:10,341
beat the Devil.

518
00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:13,691
He got out of a deal with him.
And all I have to do is figure out

519
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:16,142
how he did it, and then I can get out
of my deal, too. No more

520
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:18,920
bounty hunting no more going to hell,
no more running away from anything.

521
00:35:19,045 --> 00:35:20,753
We just have to find this guy.

522
00:35:26,115 --> 00:35:28,450
So what do you say? You in?

523
00:35:34,443 --> 00:35:35,542
Yeah, I'm in.

524
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:46,651
Oh, my god.

525
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:50,445
This bento box Kristin
made is so delicious. What's in it?

526
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,486
That's, chicken, tapioca and pickles.

527
00:35:56,975 --> 00:35:58,731
You have no idea what's in it, do you?

528
00:35:59,017 --> 00:36:00,966
I didn't even know that was food, Benji.

529
00:36:02,357 --> 00:36:04,035
Can you give me a hand in the bedroom?

530
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:09,316
Yes, I can.

531
00:36:33,311 --> 00:36:36,045
- Do you know how to do this?
- Do what?

532
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:37,511
This bed thing.

533
00:36:38,255 --> 00:36:40,223
All these buttons, I don't understand.

534
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,573
Right. That adjusts
the firmness of the mattress.

535
00:36:43,856 --> 00:36:45,129
I am awesome at it.

536
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:49,841
My mom used to let me sleep
in here when I had nightmares. But...

537
00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:53,167
That is a great shot of me. Regal.

538
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:57,046
Your mom keeps a lot
of pictures of you around her room.

539
00:36:58,195 --> 00:36:59,632
It's a little strange.

540
00:36:59,765 --> 00:37:02,273
No, not really.
I put most of those up myself.

541
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:04,266
OK, here we go.

542
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:07,224
I can feel it.

543
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:09,551
That's nice.

544
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:13,306
Maybe a little too soft now.

545
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,273
Don't want that.

546
00:37:16,218 --> 00:37:18,077
- A bit harder.
- You got it.

547
00:37:22,683 --> 00:37:24,188
- Almost there.
- Yeah?

548
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:26,850
Right there.

549
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:31,258
That was perfect.

550
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,640
- You're amazing.
- Yes, I am.

551
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:38,779
God, I can't believe how
comfortable we are together.

552
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:42,446
- It's so natural, you know what I mean?
- I was thinking the same thing.

553
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:47,054
You know, i, I see the way you watch
me when you think I'm not looking.

554
00:37:48,647 --> 00:37:50,343
- You notice that?
- Of course I do.

555
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,891
Don't be embarrassed,
don't be embarrassed. You know why?

556
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:54,722
Because I think it's great.

557
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,655
- Do you?
- Yeah.

558
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,432
- So do i.
- What?

559
00:37:58,871 --> 00:38:01,070
- I can't believe how lucky we are!
- So lucky!

560
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,419
I mean, what are the chances?
I don't know!

561
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:06,410
I never realized how much I wanted this.

562
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,220
- Me, too.
- A big brother!

563
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:12,413
- What?!
- I have a brother!

564
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:14,457
No, step! Stepbrother!

565
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,571
It doesn't matter! It's the same thing.

566
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:18,624
No, no, no, Kristin,
it's very different.

567
00:38:19,685 --> 00:38:21,797
This is a bound
that will never be broken.

568
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:24,913
And I'm gonna be
the best sister in the world.

569
00:38:25,857 --> 00:38:28,786
When people think of the perfect
brother and sister,

570
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:31,259
they're gonna think of us!

571
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:34,764
- Just me and my big bro.
- Great.

572
00:38:35,205 --> 00:38:37,768
You know what would
make this night perfect?

573
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:40,149
Tickle fight!

574
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:46,796
Sorry.

575
00:38:47,343 --> 00:38:49,661
- Super ticklish.
- No problem!

576
00:39:03,712 --> 00:39:05,391
Hey, come on, big guy.

577
00:39:05,816 --> 00:39:07,281
Let's go for a ride.

578
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:11,039
I just had her all detailed.

579
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:25,892
Just wow.

580
00:39:26,403 --> 00:39:28,522
The job you did on those souls,
magnifique.

581
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:30,710
What do you say we have
a drink and go celebrate it?

582
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:32,396
- Let's do it?
- For real?

583
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:33,453
For real!

584
00:39:33,766 --> 00:39:36,284
In fact, you know what, forget the
drink. Let's do something crazy.

585
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:38,290
Let's hit up some clubs.
Maybe an after party?

586
00:39:41,934 --> 00:39:43,284
What is the deal?

587
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:46,723
I was the one that was supposed
to want to have the fun,

588
00:39:46,848 --> 00:39:48,946
and you supposed to be
all pouty and complaing.

589
00:39:49,071 --> 00:39:51,793
I don't know, I'm just.
I'm in a fantastic mood right now.

590
00:39:51,918 --> 00:39:55,024
Hey, you want to go to Vegas?
That would be awesome.

591
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:02,014
You know,
I'm just not feelin' it anymore, pal.

592
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:03,948
- You better just go.
- Are you sure?

593
00:40:04,073 --> 00:40:07,376
- Out, out.
- OK, all right.

594
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:12,071
Thanks for the ride.

595
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:14,581
I think I was wrong about you, Sam.

596
00:40:15,786 --> 00:40:17,272
You're not a dud at all.

597
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:20,761
You don't even know
what you're capable of,

598
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:23,632
what Evil will come your way, what

599
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:25,963
terrible things you will do
at my bidding.

600
00:40:26,737 --> 00:40:29,444
I look forward to a long
and fruitful relationship, Sammy.

601
00:40:29,906 --> 00:40:32,086
So you go ahead and enjoy
your life while you can.

602
00:40:32,315 --> 00:40:34,862
'cause one of these days, you're mine.

603
00:40:37,854 --> 00:40:39,436
You have a good night, too.

604
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,999
Just for that, i'm gonna make it rain.

605
00:40:51,107 --> 00:40:53,210
Hey, it's cool!

606
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:55,241
I love this weather!

607
00:41:10,006 --> 00:41:14,010
