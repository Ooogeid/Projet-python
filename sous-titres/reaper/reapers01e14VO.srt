1
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:05,904
Considering the severity
of the accident,

2
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:08,336
I'm very happy with your recovery.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,192
You're a fast healer, young lady.

4
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:11,507
When can I go home?

5
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:13,817
Very soon. I have a few questions first.

6
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:16,069
- Have you experienced any dizziness?
- No.

7
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:17,458
- Headache?
- Nope.

8
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:18,710
Hallucinations?

9
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:25,246
- What do you mean by hallucinations?
- Anything out of the ordinary.

10
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:27,880
I've had patients with head
trauma see all sorts of odd things.

11
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:30,738
Space aliens,
pink elephants, you name it.

12
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:33,172
You know, the night of the accident,

13
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:35,891
I did see some things
that seemed impossible.

14
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:40,312
- But you're saying that that's normal?
- I'm saying it's hardly unusual.

15
00:00:40,436 --> 00:00:42,632
And based on your vitals,
it's nothing to worry about.

16
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:45,102
I suggest you put it out of your mind.

17
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:47,593
Here. These should help.

18
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:49,820
Okay. Thanks.

19
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,561
Nobody likes a litter bug.

20
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:11,122
- Did she buy it?
- Hell yeah.

21
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:13,931
I've been mopping up after doctors
for 20 years. I got the lingo down.

22
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:15,843
Did you give her the bottle of tic tacs?

23
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:17,881
- Of course.
- I hope she likes peppermint.

24
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:20,190
You coulda got her any flavor
you wanted to in the world

25
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:22,340
- and you got her peppermint? Really?
- Yeah, why?

26
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:24,691
Because, Ben, everybody knows
that peppermint is for jerks.

27
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:25,813
Right?

28
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:29,073
I'm... gonna go clean
the men's room now.

29
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:33,950
Season 1, Episode 14 - Rebellion
For www.forom.com

30
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:46,820
Thank you very much.

31
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:48,910
Have a good day. Later.

32
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:51,730
Hey, ladies,
got ourselves another delivery.

33
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:53,161
What do we got?

34
00:01:53,288 --> 00:01:54,580
I give you...

35
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:57,552
"Beers of the world!"

36
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:01,272
- They're beautiful.
- Guys, come on.

37
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:04,320
Free wine,
free chocolate, free designer soap...

38
00:02:04,445 --> 00:02:05,872
This stuff doesn't belong to us.

39
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:07,871
Benji, if the moron
who lived here before us

40
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:10,722
was too lazy to leave a forwarding
address, then he deserves to get got.

41
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,470
Besides, who ate all the free melons?

42
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:14,440
I have no blood sugar,
which is an emergency.

43
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:16,492
- Who wants beer real?
- I'm in.

44
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:20,491
- Guinness and lucky charms for me.
- You, sir, have a very refined palate.

45
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:38,562
I'm bored.

46
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,263
Are you bored, Sammy?

47
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:45,222
- No.
- You know what I could go for?

48
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:47,141
A banana split.

49
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:49,480
With hot fudge. Yeah.

50
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:51,682
What do you say?

51
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:52,941
No, thank you.

52
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:56,072
What, you don't like banan splits?
What are you, some kind of a commie?

53
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:57,623
C'mon. My treat.

54
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:01,020
What part of "no" don't you understand?
Forget the ice cream.

55
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,400
Do you have a soul for me or not?

56
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:05,061
Boy.

57
00:03:06,078 --> 00:03:07,873
I guess I better get right to it, huh?

58
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:12,752
All right. It's your standard case.

59
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:15,651
The guy was a lawyer, of course...

60
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:17,763
We have a lot of those in hell.

61
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:19,010
Cubby Bryce.

62
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:20,931
Died a couple of months ago

63
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:23,061
your typical ambulance chaser

64
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:26,750
who got his kicks bilking his clients
of all their hard-earned savings.

65
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:29,423
He's back once again,
bleeding people dry.

66
00:03:30,315 --> 00:03:31,373
Literally.

67
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,072
Gross.

68
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:36,500
- Yeah.
- Where can I find him?

69
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:38,323
Actually, you're sitting on him.

70
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:42,633
Anything else?

71
00:03:46,665 --> 00:03:47,652
Nice.

72
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:55,133
Hey, you're back!

73
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:56,310
- Hi.
- Hi.

74
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:57,433
Hi. Um...

75
00:03:57,556 --> 00:03:58,643
Sorry... OK...

76
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,141
- Hi.
- Hi.

77
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,690
Well, that wasn't awkward at all.

78
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:07,743
- Hi.
- Hey.

79
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:10,562
- I'll be back to get you at 5.
- OK. Great. Thank you.

80
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:12,752
You look great!

81
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,900
Have you ever been hit
in the head with a shovel?

82
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:18,110
No, no. I can't say I have.

83
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:21,242
OK. Well, that's how my head
felt after the crash. And you know what?

84
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,742
Somehow, through that pain,
I found clarity.

85
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:27,812
Which isn't really
coming across right now.

86
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:29,821
Life is short.
There is no time to waste.

87
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:32,830
- That's all you and I have been doing.
- Wasting time?

88
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:36,071
We kissed the night of the crash, right?

89
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:37,882
I didn't hallucinate that.

90
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:39,923
No, that definitely happened.

91
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,302
And it was pretty amazing, right?

92
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:45,102
- Yes. That it was.
- OK, then.

93
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:46,772
We're going on a date.

94
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:48,870
- What?
- Yeah, a real date.

95
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:51,481
No more wasting time.
Saturday work for you?

96
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:55,121
- Yeah.
- Good. I thought it might.

97
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,850
Oh, my gosh.

98
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:11,593
Would you look at what we have here.

99
00:05:11,716 --> 00:05:13,921
Don't worry, Josie.
I get your message loud and clear.

100
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:15,420
What message, jackass?

101
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:17,500
You know, you coming to my work.

102
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:19,631
Wearing the scarf that
I gave you last Christmas.

103
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:20,511
This?

104
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:23,380
It was the first thing I
found at the bottom of my closet.

105
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:26,473
You know, it's really nice to see
that even though I've clearly moved on,

106
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:28,393
that my "mark" is still all over you.

107
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:32,062
Like dog pee on a pretty,
pretty, little tree.

108
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:33,851
Excuse me.

109
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:36,160
- Yes. Hi.
- Hey, Ted.

110
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:40,401
There, don't you look sexy.

111
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:58,741
I hurt my back at work and
I'd like to discuss my legal options.

112
00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:01,681
Give me a call back when you get this.
Thanks. Bye.

113
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:03,622
I just left a voicemail for Cubby Bryce.

114
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:05,053
Is that the escaped soul?

115
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:08,611
Yep. He's an ambulance chasing lawyer.
I figure we set a meeting,

116
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,431
and when he shows up we ambush him,
send him back to hell.

117
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:13,743
Cubby Bryce.
Why does that sound familiar?

118
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,742
He's got a bunch of
billboards around town.

119
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:18,110
What kinda name is Cubby?
Who's named Cubby?

120
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:20,481
- Your name is "Sock."
- Your name is Sock.

121
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,262
- Did you mousse?
- Don't touch my hair.

122
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:24,191
You did!

123
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,990
Boy's got a date planned...
He's trying to get all seximified.

124
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:29,250
Mission accomplished.
Sock and I are excited.

125
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
We've been waiting on the sidelines

126
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:32,960
for you to hook up with Andi
since high school.

127
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,281
All the romantic tension
between you two reminds me

128
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:37,830
of my favorite movie of all time...
"Meat Hammer 5."

129
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:40,681
In the beginning of the movie, there's
this big, long, talky-talky scene.

130
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:41,963
Goes on for 4 minutes.

131
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,011
But then,
the talking ends, hammering begins.

132
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:47,432
You got it, right? That's my point.

133
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:50,051
So now, the talky-talky
between you and Andi is done.

134
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:53,301
- Let the hammering...
- No, no, Sock, I get it. I get it.

135
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:54,601
Good. Loud and clear.

136
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:57,182
Let's have a toast for our boy's date.
What do you say?

137
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:58,243
Hey, guys.

138
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,101
Sam, we need to talk to you in private.

139
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:01,451
Our apartment.

140
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:05,360
May I offer you a
sangria before we begin?

141
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:06,861
No, I'm OK.

142
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:09,913
- What's with all the mystery?
- Wait until the door is closed.

143
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:13,020
- Why?
- The Devil can't penetrate a circle...

144
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:14,698
He can only enter through corners.

145
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:16,542
Inside a circle,
he can't see or hear us.

146
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:18,871
This is so exciting.

147
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:20,300
Tell him.

148
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:23,493
- Tell him, tell him, tell him.
- I want you to tell him.

149
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:24,611
All right.

150
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:27,990
Steve told me about your
little conversation the other day,

151
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:31,930
and he feels that we can trust you
with our greatest secret, and I agree.

152
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:33,490
But I have to caution you...

153
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:35,700
We're part of an underground
alliance of demons

154
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:38,573
- planning to overthrow the Devil!
- What?

155
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:41,232
I know, I know, it sounds so crazy!

156
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:43,732
What are you talking about?
How can you overthrow the Devil?

157
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:45,682
We used to be angels, Sam.

158
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:47,821
We knew the face of God.

159
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:50,861
But then we followed Lucifer
in a revolt against the Lord

160
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:54,723
and we were cast out
of Heaven for eternity.

161
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:58,553
Recently we've begun to
feel that the Devil's leadership

162
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:00,493
is taking us in the wrong direction.

163
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:02,502
We're tired of living lives of evil.

164
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:07,201
We're going to defeat him,
and we believe that you can help us.

165
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:08,860
Me?

166
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,171
- How?
- Well,

167
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,830
for some reason, you're special.

168
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:15,990
The Devil talks to you.

169
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:19,262
You're uniquely positioned
to be our inside man.

170
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,521
I'm not going up against the Devil.
That is insane.

171
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:26,181
You won't be alone, Sam.
And think of it this way...

172
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,781
With the Devil out of the picture,
he can't collect your soul.

173
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:32,430
His claim on you will be no invoid.

174
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:35,303
- Really?
- Think about it...

175
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:38,502
You could have a normal life again.
No more risking your neck chasing souls.

176
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:41,882
No more putting the people
you care about, and danger.

177
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:46,861
I guess...

178
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:48,792
I can't say no.

179
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:54,973
Welcome to the revolution, Sam.

180
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:07,461
So Steve and Tony have a
plan to knock heads with the Devil?

181
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:08,983
That's what you told me.

182
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:11,491
I can't really be in the
specifics right now, but it's big.

183
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:14,882
Sam, come on. Just give me
one little detail, one little hint.

184
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:17,183
All I can say is that if this works,
I'll be free.

185
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,541
I can finally get out from under...

186
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:24,233
my current cell phone plan
and sign with your provider. Thank you.

187
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:28,090
How long have you been sitting there?

188
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,303
Do you think I'm an idiot, Sam?

189
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:34,920
- No, I...
- Because I know what's going on.

190
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:37,053
OK, listen, I...

191
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:39,811
- It wasn't my...
- I ask you

192
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:43,272
to go get some ice cream and you refuse.

193
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:45,302
In a rather rude manner, I might add.

194
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:47,851
So I'm thinking, and I realise,

195
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:50,490
who says no to ice cream?

196
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:53,572
Nobody, that's who.

197
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:57,412
So you're mad about ice cream.

198
00:09:57,616 --> 00:10:01,291
I treat you with respect, and
you treat me like little bits of dirt.

199
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:03,002
What's up with that?

200
00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:05,823
- You are so weird.
- All right.

201
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:07,111
I'm done.

202
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:32,363
The little hairs. The little hairs.

203
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:33,742
OK... Do you trust me?

204
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,722
Yeah. I do. OK. Yeah.

205
00:10:38,315 --> 00:10:39,363
Stings.

206
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:43,101
Good day to you, my fellow comrades.

207
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:46,370
I'm sorry,
aren't you going to yell at us?

208
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:48,701
What? Yell at my peeps?

209
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,842
I would sooner cut off
my arm and yell at that.

210
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:54,220
- What do you want, Ted?
- Josie's phone number.

211
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:57,930
I think we made quite
the connection the other day

212
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,231
when she lovingly draped
this scarf over my body.

213
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,863
OK, listen, Ted.
You have my blessing, all right?

214
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:06,813
- Really?
- 100%, give me your hand.

215
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:10,550
I want you to go forth
and hit that thing.

216
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:12,993
- Thank you, Bert.
- Please don't press so hard.

217
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:15,743
- I have sensitive palms.
- There you go. OK.

218
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:18,743
Right.

219
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:21,191
Are you crazy?

220
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:22,951
Josie will eat him alive.

221
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:24,552
I know! I know! God.

222
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:28,501
What I wouldn't give to be on the phone
when Josie shoots down Ted man walking.

223
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:34,823
- What's up?
- Get in.

224
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:37,542
It's time for you
to meet the underground.

225
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:50,490
- This is your secret headquarters?
- Not till we get inside.

226
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:52,551
See, we can't afford to take chances.

227
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,652
OK, let's move on to new business.

228
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:57,430
Maude, give us your insurrection report.

229
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,941
Last week, I planted 6 dozen flowers

230
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:02,832
in a public park on Bower.

231
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,040
Begonias.

232
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:08,351
And I let a homeless
person shower in my house.

233
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:13,721
Excellent.

234
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:16,010
- Do good, people.
- Do good.

235
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:26,131
Now, who else wants
to talk about their week?

236
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:27,781
I've got something.

237
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:31,901
My name is Bob and I'm a demon.

238
00:12:32,227 --> 00:12:33,581
Hi, Bob!

239
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:36,133
I had a rough week. Started off great.

240
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:39,691
I rode around on Monday
collecting recyclables.

241
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:43,432
Then I dropped coins
into expired meters.

242
00:12:44,427 --> 00:12:46,863
Then, I tried to eat a child.

243
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:51,622
I knew right away it was wrong,

244
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:55,392
so I untied the kid
and called my sponsor Randy.

245
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:57,901
We had a pretty tough talk.

246
00:12:58,617 --> 00:13:01,661
- Thanks, man. I owe you my life.
- Thank you, man.

247
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:08,932
Everybody,
this is Sam, the one I told you about.

248
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:12,783
- Hi, Sam!
- Hi.

249
00:13:12,907 --> 00:13:16,191
Sam, any thoughts on
what you've heard so far?

250
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:18,892
I... don't think so, no.

251
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:21,531
Sam, what's wrong?

252
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:26,623
Look, I guess I'm a little confused
on how feeding the parking meters

253
00:13:26,745 --> 00:13:28,621
is supposed to take down the Devil.

254
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,742
Kindness is our greatest weapon, Sam.

255
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:34,432
The Devil brings evil into the world.
We undermine him with goodness

256
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:37,241
and charity.
When we make the world a better place.

257
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:39,922
We'll have lucifer on
his knees begging for mercy!

258
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,891
So you're all just gonna be... nice.

259
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:50,302
Nice. Yes. We can't lose!

260
00:13:51,815 --> 00:13:54,243
How long do you think
this is even gonna take?

261
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,152
300, 400 years, tops.

262
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:58,490
OK, see, I don't have 400 years!

263
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:00,322
I'll be dead and in hell!

264
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:05,951
From a bunch of rebel demons, I
was expecting something more aggressive.

265
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,453
- We do fun runs.
- I gotta go.

266
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,163
I got it.

267
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:14,360
I got it.

268
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:19,631
Sam. Sam. Sam.

269
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,423
Wait.

270
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,210
Look, I'll be honest, I...

271
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,113
Hang on.

272
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,823
This is hard to say. I love Steve,

273
00:14:39,518 --> 00:14:42,861
but his peaceful resistance
plan is not very...

274
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:44,282
efficient.

275
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,741
To someone with a
mortal lifespan like you,

276
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:48,993
a century must seem like forever.

277
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:51,450
You guys die so quickly.
You're like goldfish.

278
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:54,653
What we need to do

279
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:58,130
is we ram a nuke down
the Devil's throat, right now.

280
00:14:58,425 --> 00:14:59,961
That should be the plan.

281
00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:02,172
Good luck with that, Tony.

282
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:05,802
Sam.

283
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:10,720
You need a ride home?

284
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:12,360
I'm good.

285
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:18,200
Hello?

286
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:20,052
Cubby Bryce, attorney-at-law.

287
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:22,570
I caught your message
about the workman's comp case.

288
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:27,943
I pulled my back out stocking
shelves at the work bench

289
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:29,991
and I'm thinking of suing.

290
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:33,361
Well, it sounds like you've
got the makings for a fantastic case.

291
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:36,183
I'm happy to come to you.
When is a good time?

292
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:39,382
You could swing by the
bench tonight after work...

293
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:42,552
- Have some privacy.
- It sounds perfect.

294
00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:43,670
Perfect.

295
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:04,153
So your average on a back injury suit

296
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,253
can range anywhere from a couple
of grand all the way up to 6 figures.

297
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:11,913
7 figures if you're willing
to bend the truth a little.

298
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:13,662
7 figures? Are you serious?

299
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:16,180
Are you willing to wear
a cast or a neck brace?

300
00:16:16,306 --> 00:16:18,491
Dude, I would be willing
to put on your underwear

301
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:20,810
with you still in 'em for 7 figures.
Tell me more.

302
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:22,123
- Sock.
- What?

303
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:23,603
No more questions.

304
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:25,861
Look here.

305
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:27,713
- I got lots of time.
- No, you don't.

306
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,513
Easy! Easy! Easy!

307
00:16:33,098 --> 00:16:34,013
I surrender.

308
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:37,310
Just let me grab my stuff
before you send me back.

309
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:07,340
Keep it in your pants, Bryce.

310
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:29,623
I need a beer.

311
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,692
- I'll second that.
- Drinks are on Cubby, boys.

312
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,553
Snagged his wallet.

313
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:49,502
So, any insider tips what
I should be expecting this weekend?

314
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:52,672
I don't know.
I'm pretty sure you asked me out.

315
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:54,681
Shouldn't you be making the plans?

316
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,431
OK. All right. Fair enough.

317
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,551
- I'll think of something incredible.
- Anything.

318
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:00,851
As long as it involves fireworks,

319
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:03,602
and a hot air balloon,
maybe a couple limousines.

320
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:04,851
Oh, OK, OK.

321
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,133
- That was...
- Yeah.

322
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:29,652
How about I just come over?

323
00:18:29,778 --> 00:18:31,250
Let's... let's do that.

324
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:35,472
- OK. I'm gonna...
- Yeah. I'll see you.

325
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:41,513
- Bert Wysocki.
- Hola Ted.

326
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,490
I want to thank you
for helping me with Josie.

327
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:47,391
- We had a date last night.
- What? You had a...

328
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:49,430
You asked her out and
she actually said yes?

329
00:18:49,556 --> 00:18:53,011
Let me just say that the
date was quite satisfactory.

330
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:56,313
What do you mean "satisfactory"?
What are you talking...

331
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,730
- Did you two touch parts?
- Not yet, no. But...

332
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:03,910
she did call me over to her place
tonight to help her hook up her DVR.

333
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:05,701
And I think we all know what that means.

334
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,640
That means she
wants you to hook up her DVR.

335
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:09,320
No, hooking up any sort of appliance

336
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,222
is classic gay porn terminology
for getting it on...

337
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:15,840
And I'm pretty sure that that
translates over to the hetero arena.

338
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:20,690
- Why are you laughing?
- Ted, I'm sorry. Listen to me.

339
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:23,800
I am so sorry, really I am,
that Josie got your hopes up like this,

340
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:27,090
but, there is no way that
she'll ever be your girlfriend, OK?

341
00:19:27,218 --> 00:19:29,122
- She's out of your league.
- I know that.

342
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:30,520
You know that?

343
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:33,573
But she'll date me for the
same reasons that she dated you.

344
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:35,283
The girls like to date down.

345
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:38,622
- Excuse me?
- It's clearly her thing. Her psyche.

346
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:39,993
Going out with guys,

347
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:43,801
that she's way too good for
makes her feel safe and superior.

348
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:48,101
It's a bonanza for guys like us,
because we're dating up.

349
00:19:48,485 --> 00:19:51,711
We're proving our luck,
it's a win-win situation all around.

350
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:53,751
You know what, Ted?
Shut up. You're wrong.

351
00:19:53,957 --> 00:19:56,430
You know why? Because there's no way
that Josie would ever think

352
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,202
that she was better than me, OK?
So, thanks.

353
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:01,972
Sam,

354
00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:05,563
- we have something for you.
- You are gonna love us.

355
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:07,452
Love. Us.

356
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:15,010
Sam, you are about to see that when
demons set their minds on something,

357
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:18,013
they get the job done.

358
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,283
Behold... our gift to you!

359
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:24,873
We've prepared a human sacrifice!

360
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:26,703
All for you, Sam.

361
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:29,493
- What are you doing?
- How is this for me?

362
00:20:29,615 --> 00:20:32,122
Well, this gets you out
of your contract with the Devil.

363
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:33,242
How?

364
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,131
Well, bob here used
to work at legal in hell.

365
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:38,632
He knows how to work the system.

366
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:42,390
What you do is fill out
the standard 357j transfer waiver,

367
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:44,893
but attach the intangible
properties rider.

368
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:47,520
It's irregular, but permissible.

369
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,422
This guy's soul takes your
place in hell and it's iron clad.

370
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:52,022
The Devil can't reverse it.

371
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:56,460
Here, just jam this through his heart,
easy as pie.

372
00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:58,610
Guys, no.

373
00:20:59,598 --> 00:21:01,993
I'm not sending an innocent
person to hell in my place.

374
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,300
Sam, he's hardly innocent.
He's a drug dealer.

375
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:06,371
He tried to sell me weed in the park.

376
00:21:06,495 --> 00:21:07,663
It's a gatewy drug.

377
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:09,960
What is wrong with you guys?

378
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:12,193
Sacrificing a person is evil!

379
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:17,962
He's right.

380
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:20,430
All this time we've been
trying to combat our demon natures,

381
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:22,473
and then we go and
do something like this.

382
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:24,550
We should be ashamed of ourselves,
you guys.

383
00:21:24,996 --> 00:21:26,971
Would you return this man in the park?

384
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:29,071
Upsy-daisy. Come on, buddy.

385
00:21:34,718 --> 00:21:36,151
Please forgive us.

386
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:40,152
Well, I guess that's it for this week.

387
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:43,570
Hey, thanks to Stewart
for securing this theater space.

388
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:46,572
Don't miss his turn as puck,
because he is fabulous.

389
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:49,700
Wait! We shouldn't feel ashamed.

390
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:52,572
We were not built to be pacifists!

391
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:54,870
We are demons!

392
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:57,452
We need to play to our strengths.

393
00:21:58,088 --> 00:21:59,232
We're demons!

394
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,591
We don't need to kill
the Devil with kindness.

395
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:04,382
We need to kill him. Period!

396
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:06,153
- He's right!
- Yeah!

397
00:22:08,648 --> 00:22:11,361
Now, now, we have the tool

398
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:13,773
we need to destroy him now!

399
00:22:13,978 --> 00:22:15,900
Sam is the Devil's friend!

400
00:22:17,055 --> 00:22:19,873
Uh, to be clear,
I'm not friends with him.

401
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:21,642
He's just kinda clingy.

402
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:23,740
Then make him your friend.

403
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,160
Use his weakness to your advantage.

404
00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:29,623
- How?
- We need you to summon the Devil.

405
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:32,951
Get his cell number.
We can use that to bring him here.

406
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:34,910
Get that number and
we'll handle the rest.

407
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:42,491
Well, even if you can summon the Devil,

408
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:45,481
are you sure you're
gonna be able to hurt him?

409
00:22:55,026 --> 00:22:57,992
You bring the Devil,
I'll bring the pain.

410
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:15,212
Josie! Josie, open the door.

411
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:20,933
It is so clear to me now, lady.
Everything is so clear.

412
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:23,670
I know what was wrong in our
relationship, do you want to hear it?

413
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,971
You think that you're better than me!

414
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:28,933
- Don't deny it. Don't even try.
- Are you crazy?

415
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:31,302
No, no. Not anymore, lady.
Not anymore, OK?

416
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:34,272
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.
On some small level, I knew it.

417
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:36,681
The whole time we were going out,
you looked down on me.

418
00:23:36,808 --> 00:23:37,933
You know why?

419
00:23:38,055 --> 00:23:39,401
You date down!

420
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:41,191
What does that even mean?

421
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:43,272
- Where are you getting this?
- From Ted!

422
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,101
Ted? Ted is an idiot!

423
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:47,820
He doesn't even realize
he's wearing a woman's scarf.

424
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:49,990
Well, then why did
you go on a date with him?

425
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:51,700
- I work 80-hour weeks.
- So what?

426
00:23:51,987 --> 00:23:53,281
I don't date where I work.

427
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:55,491
If a guy takes the
trouble to ask me out,

428
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:57,870
I'm inclined to give him a shot at bat.

429
00:23:58,076 --> 00:23:59,720
Well, that makes sense!

430
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:05,802
So you believe that I went out with you

431
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:08,300
just because I think
you're some sort of loser?

432
00:24:09,675 --> 00:24:13,743
For the record,
I dated you because you're sweet,

433
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:18,371
you don't care what other people think,
and you make me laugh.

434
00:24:19,536 --> 00:24:20,552
I...

435
00:24:21,617 --> 00:24:23,120
am all those things.

436
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:26,172
So, um...

437
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,220
Wanna make out?

438
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:48,381
- Hey, Tedster.
- Hi.

439
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:51,181
- What's that there?
- It's wine.

440
00:24:51,307 --> 00:24:52,550
Thanks for the wine.

441
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:55,990
That was nice of you. Don't actually
need the tool box, though,

442
00:24:56,117 --> 00:24:58,553
because I already
"hooked up Josie's DVR."

443
00:24:58,676 --> 00:24:59,673
Twice.

444
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:04,302
You play a dirty game,
my friend, but you play it well.

445
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,402
I'll see you back at work.

446
00:25:13,237 --> 00:25:14,303
Good night.

447
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:20,990
- Plastic, please.
- Hey. What's going on?

448
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:23,540
Oh, I just came in to congratulate
you on a job well done.

449
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:27,091
And I wanted to get
these packs of triple eggs.

450
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:28,173
OK.

451
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:33,663
Thank you. You have a nice day.

452
00:25:36,676 --> 00:25:38,173
Wait. Wait. Hold on.

453
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:41,703
Listen, I don't want
it to be like this, OK?

454
00:25:42,056 --> 00:25:43,863
I'm sorry I've been rude.

455
00:25:44,517 --> 00:25:45,351
Look, if...

456
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:47,901
I'm gonna be off here in 10 minutes.
You wann go grab an icecream?

457
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:52,363
Yes, Sam.

458
00:25:53,577 --> 00:25:54,661
I would like that.

459
00:25:56,578 --> 00:26:00,123
So, a little birdie told
me somebody's got a date with Andi.

460
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:03,013
You know my rule.

461
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:07,153
Date anybody you want. Just
don't tell them about our little secret.

462
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:12,250
- Oh, boy.
- Thank you.

463
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,473
- Look at it.
- Go on... try it.

464
00:26:14,777 --> 00:26:16,501
- Aren't you gonna eat yours?
- Can't.

465
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,390
I'm just gonna watch you eat yours, OK?

466
00:26:18,598 --> 00:26:20,752
What do you mean you can't eat it?

467
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,551
A little'departing
gift'from old so-and-so.

468
00:26:30,677 --> 00:26:32,820
He knew how much
I loved ice cream. Jerk.

469
00:26:33,678 --> 00:26:35,523
Go on, go on, take and bite.

470
00:26:36,868 --> 00:26:38,731
Oh, boy. So...

471
00:26:39,418 --> 00:26:42,150
Andi. Huh? The love of your life.

472
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:44,931
I thought you didn't believe in love.

473
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:48,403
I don't believe that humans
can feel through pure love but

474
00:26:49,145 --> 00:26:53,423
I know that it exists.
I've experienced it myself.

475
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:55,511
I'm not human, remember.

476
00:26:57,426 --> 00:26:59,703
You actually loved somebody? Who?

477
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:03,891
You mean God?

478
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,621
Didn't you try to
overthrow him or something?

479
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:11,950
Let's just say we had a little fight.

480
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,412
I may have been a tad impetuous.

481
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:19,120
But you loved him.

482
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:21,692
With everything that I was, I loved him.

483
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:24,283
And he loved all of us, too.

484
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:28,860
I'm sorry.

485
00:27:31,645 --> 00:27:33,083
Well.

486
00:27:34,465 --> 00:27:37,413
I haven't talked about
the fall since it happened.

487
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:40,973
- Why not?
- There's nobody who would listen.

488
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:43,690
No, it's just me.

489
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:46,182
All by myself.

490
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,920
Except till now. I've got you.

491
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:56,022
- So you see us as friends?
- I do.

492
00:27:58,455 --> 00:27:59,311
I don't.

493
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:02,872
For one, you own my soul.

494
00:28:03,076 --> 00:28:05,201
Oh, whatever.
I don't even think about that, Sam.

495
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:07,201
I can't even get in touch with you.

496
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,412
If I want to talk,
I have to just wait around

497
00:28:09,535 --> 00:28:13,220
for you to zap me wherever
you want me to be. It's not fair.

498
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:15,392
No, you're right. You're right.

499
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:16,961
You're 100% correct.

500
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:26,923
What is this?

501
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:30,773
That is my private...
and I do mean private cell phone number.

502
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:33,441
- What area code is this?
- Phoenix.

503
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:35,980
Now, listen.

504
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:38,663
I don't give this out,
so you keep it in a safe place,

505
00:28:38,787 --> 00:28:42,333
and you only use it if you
absolutely have to. I'm a busy man.

506
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,620
I'm glad we talked about this.

507
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:46,663
Do me a favor...

508
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:49,793
have an other bite.

509
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:55,482
You've done a good thing, Sam.
For the entire world.

510
00:28:56,298 --> 00:28:57,410
What now?

511
00:28:57,796 --> 00:28:59,663
I call a convocation of demons.

512
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,231
We summon Lucifer...

513
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:03,640
and we use this.

514
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:08,602
The sword of the Archangel Michael.

515
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:11,143
It splits the rock of Colossae.

516
00:29:11,536 --> 00:29:14,483
Rescued the body of Moses
from the Devil's dragons,

517
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:17,673
and vanquished Lucifer
himself int the first heveanly war.

518
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:21,742
So... you're gonna stab him?

519
00:29:23,238 --> 00:29:26,492
To destroy the Devil we must
first cut out his forked tongue,

520
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:29,601
a tongue that has spouted
lies since the beginning of time,

521
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:31,211
then we chop off his hands

522
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:34,220
that have twisted innocent
souls into sinners.

523
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:37,232
And then we cut out his heart,
a heart that knows only hate.

524
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:39,422
Only then can the Devil truly die.

525
00:29:39,628 --> 00:29:40,843
Is he gonna hurt?

526
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:43,172
His pain will be excruciating.

527
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:46,350
Let me see that.

528
00:29:50,548 --> 00:29:52,311
The number of the beast.

529
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:55,581
You should be very
proud of yourself, Sam.

530
00:30:03,025 --> 00:30:05,420
Hey, you excited about your big date?

531
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,503
That's it, "yeah"?

532
00:30:07,627 --> 00:30:09,901
The girl of your dreams is coming over,
you're moping around.

533
00:30:10,078 --> 00:30:13,763
- What is wrong with you?
- It has nothing to do with the date.

534
00:30:15,938 --> 00:30:16,890
What?

535
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:18,881
All right, listen,

536
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:21,513
- inside the circle.
- Dude! No, whoa!

537
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:23,791
The Devil won't be able to hear us.
Come on, inside.

538
00:30:23,915 --> 00:30:25,932
- Dude, that stuff is expensive.
- Just get in.

539
00:30:26,136 --> 00:30:27,071
All right.

540
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:29,890
I found a way to take down the Devil.

541
00:30:30,098 --> 00:30:32,162
- Really?
- That's great.

542
00:30:32,476 --> 00:30:34,422
So what are you crying about?

543
00:30:34,686 --> 00:30:36,402
I feel bad about double-crossing him.

544
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:39,351
- What the hell?
- He's the Devil.

545
00:30:39,476 --> 00:30:40,972
Sam, he's the Devil, OK?

546
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:43,283
All he's ever tried to do is screw you.

547
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:45,220
And with the Devil
out of the picture Sam,

548
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:47,871
- you get your soul back, your soul.
- So buck up.

549
00:30:49,037 --> 00:30:50,383
Are you bucked up?

550
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:51,911
I think so, yeah.

551
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:54,460
I'm bucked up.
Please, stop hitting me, OK?

552
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:56,582
I'll get it.

553
00:30:58,097 --> 00:30:59,093
It's her.

554
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:03,052
Hi. Hi.

555
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:07,732
I'm sorry,
that one was because I'm jealous.

556
00:31:07,855 --> 00:31:09,891
Have a good date, OK?
You two kids have fun.

557
00:31:10,098 --> 00:31:12,281
- Enjoy it.
- Bye, see you later.

558
00:31:24,505 --> 00:31:26,290
Can I offer you a beer of the world?

559
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:28,240
- I'm not really thirsty right now.
- No?

560
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:33,951
We have plenty of food.
If you feel like, uh,

561
00:31:34,156 --> 00:31:35,763
a papaya or a steak.

562
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:39,712
- This is really cute.
- What, what, what?

563
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:42,750
Because you're trying to slow it down,
but we're on an actual date.

564
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:46,173
I guess I just...
I want this to be a date we remember.

565
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:47,661
Sam,

566
00:31:48,456 --> 00:31:51,051
it could be the two of us
in an empty room, and I'd remember.

567
00:31:52,738 --> 00:31:55,680
I can't think of anything more
perfect than just being here with you,

568
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:58,252
the one person that I really care about

569
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:01,023
and trust more than
anything in the world.

570
00:32:03,726 --> 00:32:04,723
What?

571
00:32:05,818 --> 00:32:07,700
I gotta take my brain meds.

572
00:32:10,978 --> 00:32:13,340
No, they're not that bad.
They're actually minty.

573
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:14,453
No, I...

574
00:32:16,065 --> 00:32:17,131
What's wrong?

575
00:32:17,256 --> 00:32:19,862
Andi, I'm really glad you can trust me.

576
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:22,411
- I will never lie to you.
- I know.

577
00:32:22,537 --> 00:32:27,182
But I might from time to time
leave out big chunks of information.

578
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:29,762
What?

579
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:31,601
I know I've been acting

580
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:34,222
a little strange for a while,
and there's a good reason.

581
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:37,413
I just can't tell you what
that reason is. All I can say is,

582
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,230
there's a part of my life
that I can't talk about...

583
00:32:40,355 --> 00:32:41,352
at all.

584
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:44,912
A tiny, tiny part.
Really small, nothing to do with us.

585
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,282
What am I supposed to say to that?

586
00:32:47,586 --> 00:32:51,850
I hope you can say you're OK with it.
Then we can still be together.

587
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:54,070
Because that's what
I want more than anything.

588
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,561
But if you can't do that,
I'll understand. It'll suck.

589
00:32:59,348 --> 00:33:00,460
But I get it.

590
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:06,413
OK.

591
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:08,961
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

592
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:11,312
I told you, I trust you.

593
00:33:12,586 --> 00:33:14,292
I mean, I really can't think of a secret

594
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:16,312
that would change
the way I feel about you.

595
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,113
That is the last time
you come between me and Tony.

596
00:33:26,316 --> 00:33:28,211
- Steve, not a good time.
- Make it a good time.

597
00:33:28,337 --> 00:33:29,530
- Sam?
- I'm afraid Sam

598
00:33:29,737 --> 00:33:31,791
has to cut your evening short,
but may I say

599
00:33:31,915 --> 00:33:33,850
you look good enough to eat. Come on.

600
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,160
I am... I'm so sorry.

601
00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:36,830
- Secrets?
- Secrets.

602
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:42,390
Did you really think I wasn't gonna
find out what you and Tony are up to?

603
00:33:42,516 --> 00:33:45,912
- Trying to kill the Devil is suicide.
- Steven, it wasn't my idea.

604
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:47,672
- Uh, I heard shouting.
- Liar.

605
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:49,413
- You are a liar!
- Steve, Steve,

606
00:33:49,537 --> 00:33:52,220
I'm sorry we kept you out of it,
but we have a fool-proof plan.

607
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:54,352
It involves deception,
it involves violence.

608
00:33:54,478 --> 00:33:56,231
You know what, this all pacifist thing

609
00:33:56,356 --> 00:33:58,100
is a little hypocritical
coming from you.

610
00:33:58,228 --> 00:34:00,040
OK, here we go. Here we go!

611
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:04,150
Ask him how he talked me
into joining Lucifer's war on god.

612
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:05,723
That is ancient history, Tony.

613
00:34:05,848 --> 00:34:08,863
And yet, getting my ass kicked
out of heaven remains fresh in my mind.

614
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:11,351
You know the therapist said
that this is one of my triggers.

615
00:34:11,476 --> 00:34:13,702
What are you gonna do, Steve?
You gonna take a shot at me?

616
00:34:13,828 --> 00:34:16,821
Give into that demon nature, huh?
Show a little fang?

617
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:20,281
No.

618
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,860
Cause I don't do that anymore.

619
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:24,343
There's a better way.

620
00:34:24,468 --> 00:34:27,220
And I'm gonna redeem myself
in the eyes of our creator.

621
00:34:27,347 --> 00:34:30,423
And I am gonna regain
my rightful place in heaven.

622
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:33,472
And in the meantime, Sam and I are
gonna be kicking ass and taking names.

623
00:34:33,976 --> 00:34:35,482
- Come on.
- Tony, Tony...

624
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,653
No, everything is in place.
The Devil dies tonight.

625
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:58,600
Are you sure that thing
will be able to kill him?

626
00:34:58,727 --> 00:34:59,720
Positive.

627
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,912
We're all going to be free.

628
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:08,601
Wait, wait!

629
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:12,033
- Steve, not now.
- Not speaking to you.

630
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:17,121
I'm begging you all,
please call this off.

631
00:35:17,768 --> 00:35:21,890
If we murder the Devil in cold blood.
We become more like him.

632
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,592
The only way to defeat him

633
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:27,970
is to turn our back on his ways.

634
00:35:28,097 --> 00:35:29,562
Who is with me?

635
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:34,001
Anyone?

636
00:35:36,476 --> 00:35:37,820
Steve, I'm sorry.

637
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:39,782
We're going through with this.

638
00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:42,171
And if you want to leave, I...

639
00:35:42,538 --> 00:35:44,080
completely understand.

640
00:35:47,106 --> 00:35:49,310
But I would love it if you stayed.

641
00:35:53,105 --> 00:35:55,690
My place is at your side.

642
00:35:56,725 --> 00:35:57,870
You know that.

643
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:01,401
I'm so glad.

644
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:06,313
All right, Sam, let's do this.

645
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:14,481
Hey, you guys, we're just grabbing
some of the beer for the roof.

646
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:17,482
We're not... and I repeat...
we're not trying to see you bone.

647
00:36:17,606 --> 00:36:19,851
Relax, they're not here.
I think they're in the bedroom.

648
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:20,851
Dammit.

649
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:23,171
All right, hold your arms out.

650
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,072
- Sock?
- Yeah?

651
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:28,972
How long you plan
on us being on the roof?

652
00:36:29,097 --> 00:36:31,642
I don't know.
That's up to Sam, isn't it?

653
00:36:31,977 --> 00:36:33,583
- Cubby Bryce.
- What?

654
00:36:36,858 --> 00:36:38,002
"Cubby Bryce."

655
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:39,332
Cubby Bryce.

656
00:36:41,086 --> 00:36:43,932
- Cubby Bryce.
- The soul we captured. What?

657
00:36:44,138 --> 00:36:46,160
- We're drinking his beer.
- What?

658
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:49,192
I knew his name sounded
familiar. I mean,

659
00:36:49,316 --> 00:36:51,230
his name's on every
single one of these labels.

660
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:52,711
So I don't understand. What,

661
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,691
did the soul live
here before we moved in?

662
00:36:54,897 --> 00:36:57,350
Had to. And that can't be a coincidence.

663
00:36:57,476 --> 00:37:01,492
You think the Devil has something to
do with us moving into this apartment?

664
00:37:01,616 --> 00:37:03,851
Ben, I don't even want to go there man.

665
00:37:03,978 --> 00:37:06,663
I found this joint in a real estate ad.

666
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:10,751
- Devil has nothing to do with it, OK?
- I knew this was too good to be true.

667
00:37:12,205 --> 00:37:14,102
So you find this place yourself, right?

668
00:37:14,226 --> 00:37:16,162
- Yes, I do, 100%.
- And what's this?

669
00:37:16,286 --> 00:37:18,260
- What?
- Look who signed the lease, Sock?

670
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:20,100
- What?
- Satin.

671
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:22,261
Satan, Sock.

672
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:25,560
He signed the lease himself.

673
00:37:25,688 --> 00:37:28,042
OK, this doesn't make sense to me, OK?

674
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,561
Why would the Devil
want us to move in here?

675
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:33,442
Because he knew Sam
would meet Steve and Tony...

676
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:37,002
and help with the revolution.
It's a trap, Sock.

677
00:37:37,127 --> 00:37:38,221
Sam! Sammy!

678
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:41,032
OK.

679
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:44,570
Here goes.

680
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,261
Sorry.

681
00:37:49,576 --> 00:37:51,710
- I should take this.
- Oh, man.

682
00:37:53,408 --> 00:37:55,213
- Hello?
- Sam, what are you doing?

683
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:57,642
I'm kind of in the middle
of a rebellion right now.

684
00:37:57,768 --> 00:38:00,153
- Can I please call you back?
- No. Listen very carefully.

685
00:38:00,275 --> 00:38:02,292
The Devil put us in this apartment.

686
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:05,421
- He knows what you're doing.
- He knows, Sam. He knows.

687
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:07,333
He's setting us up. The Devil's onto us.

688
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,710
- What do you mean?
- We can't go through with this, OK?

689
00:38:09,836 --> 00:38:11,642
- What? We're way too close.
- No, no!

690
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:14,880
Hey, gang.

691
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:23,242
- We're having a party?
- No!

692
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:28,381
Neat.

693
00:38:33,797 --> 00:38:34,743
Boys.

694
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:39,763
But did you really think I'd
leave the actual sword of the Archangel

695
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:41,503
lying around for you to find?

696
00:38:46,388 --> 00:38:48,081
I got it in Korea town.

697
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:52,221
Oh, Sam...

698
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:56,971
Look what you did.

699
00:38:58,066 --> 00:38:59,710
Stabbing me in the back.

700
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,051
Quite a show, huh?

701
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:28,003
- You killed them.
- Yep.

702
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,683
Why did you have to kill them?

703
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:35,980
Well, they were sort
of trying to kill me, Sam.

704
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,452
They weren't exactly loyal employees.

705
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:41,650
Very helpful of you, though, to get 'em
all in one location like that.

706
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:43,501
Made my job way easier.

707
00:39:45,376 --> 00:39:46,820
Oh, come on, man. Relax.

708
00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:50,162
My whole plan depended
on you conspiring against me.

709
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:52,873
- It's all good.
- Why'd you do it?

710
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,843
I was tired of them, Sam.

711
00:39:57,108 --> 00:39:59,313
I have enough annoyances in my day.

712
00:40:00,258 --> 00:40:01,172
Exhibit "A."

713
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:02,783
No.

714
00:40:03,378 --> 00:40:04,623
That's not why.

715
00:40:05,175 --> 00:40:07,013
They weren't just annoying.
They were right.

716
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:08,780
Steve was right.

717
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:11,392
His peace plan?
That was really a threat to you.

718
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:14,360
Yes. I'm so terrified by
people who are super friendly.

719
00:40:14,488 --> 00:40:17,121
Come on, you wouldn't have gone to
all the trouble if you weren't afraid.

720
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,893
What they were planning was gonna work.

721
00:40:19,185 --> 00:40:21,440
Well, that's an adorable
theory but completely wrong.

722
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:24,403
Love, generosity, decency.

723
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:26,310
It weakens you.

724
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:29,871
If everybody in the world were good,
you'd have no one to tempt.

725
00:40:29,996 --> 00:40:32,741
You wouldn't even exist!
It would destroy you!

726
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:36,320
Well, what are the chances
of that ever happening?

727
00:40:41,848 --> 00:40:42,791
By the way...

728
00:40:44,627 --> 00:40:46,342
I'm changing my cellphone number.

729
00:40:57,778 --> 00:41:00,192
Thanks to Raceman for the transcript.
