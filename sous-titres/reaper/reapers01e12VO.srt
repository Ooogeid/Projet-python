1
00:00:01,665 --> 00:00:03,548
Is this a carjacking?
Are you carjacking me?

2
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:04,740
I'm the devil!

3
00:00:07,087 --> 00:00:08,273
Before you were born,

4
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:10,513
your mom and I sold
your soul to the devil.

5
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:12,641
- You gonna tell Andi?
- I'm not gonna tell Andi!

6
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:14,639
If she knows,
she'll never go out with me.

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,482
You can make her
go out with you, Damien.

8
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:18,699
You're just going to bring
escaped souls back to hell.

9
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,024
- That's cool, right?
<i>- How am I supposed to capture him?</i>

10
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:24,730
<i>This will help. A vessel, hand-crafted
in the bowels of perdition</i>

11
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,775
<i>by the inequities of the vile.</i>

12
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,849
- That'll work.
- Word of caution...

13
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:30,439
I don't accept failure.

14
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,901
<i>You finally found the
one thing that you're good at.</i>

15
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:35,372
<i>You sent an escaped soul back to hell.</i>

16
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,772
Oh, fiddlesticks!

17
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:41,271
Dude, I need to find
another place to live.

18
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:45,050
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

19
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:49,173
You can't move back to my house.
We gotta figure something else out.

20
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:02,650
Morning.

21
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:06,960
What?

22
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:08,922
Was I snoring?

23
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,392
Little bit.

24
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:16,931
You want to get some food
before we meet up with the guys?

25
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:18,711
I just gotta change first.

26
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:19,790
OK.

27
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:23,210
You know, you're the first
girl to infiltrate our bowling circle.

28
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:31,563
I like you a lot, too, Sam.

29
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:39,961
Just so you know,

30
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:42,962
you might get your ass handed
to you today. We bowl a lot.

31
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:45,782
It doesn't look that hard.
Trust me, it's harder than it looks.

32
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:47,662
Don't worry. The guys won't judge you.

33
00:02:47,788 --> 00:02:49,460
Hi, lady and gent. Let's do it.

34
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:52,212
I thought we agreed
to lose the costumes.

35
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:54,921
Excuse me? Lose the costumes, Sam?

36
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:57,652
That's like Mick Jagger
without Keith Richards,

37
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,432
or Bono without the Edge.
It's not right.

38
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:03,933
So don't go messing
with our bowling chi, OK?

39
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,210
- I'm sorry.
- No, come on. I love it.

40
00:03:09,746 --> 00:03:11,351
All right, bitches.

41
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,572
Let's throw some balls around.

42
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:23,451
That's us.

43
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:27,592
Yeah, all right!

44
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:52,322
Lucky streak is up, rook.

45
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:54,700
Lucky streak is up.

46
00:04:15,257 --> 00:04:18,102
Season 1, Episode 12 - Unseen
For www.forom.com

47
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,721
I'm telling you, it was weird.

48
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,640
It's like the ball
had a mind of its own.

49
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,010
It's beginner's luck.
I wouldn't read too much into it.

50
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:31,761
No, it wasn't. There was definitely
something else going on, you guys.

51
00:04:31,886 --> 00:04:34,121
You have got to chill out.
She is not the spawn of satan.

52
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:37,530
- We saw her naked, remember?
- Definitely no mark of tne beast.

53
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:40,263
You should hear the way she snores.
Seriously, it's not normal.

54
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:42,320
It's like she's a creature
from the underworld.

55
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:45,820
Oh, god, I love that movie.
Kate Beckinsale, black spandex.

56
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:47,440
There's something wrong with her.

57
00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:50,631
What? Kate Beckinsale is perfection.
What's wrong with you?

58
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,000
- No, you nimrod. Cady.
- Oh, Cady.

59
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:56,940
All right, what,
so she snores, she's a kick-ass bowler,

60
00:04:57,065 --> 00:05:00,381
she's got a super-duper hot body,
she's cool, and she's into you.

61
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:02,051
What else do you want?

62
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:04,323
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

63
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:06,511
I'd get excited
about this meeting if I were you.

64
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:09,542
I just saw Ted.
Looks like he's on the warpath.

65
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:12,942
You owe me a coffee.
Want to get one before the meeting?

66
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:16,073
- Do you guys want one?
- We're good, thanks.

67
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:18,651
Did you mean who else does he want?

68
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,513
Now that the holiday rush is over,

69
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:24,512
a few announcements to make. First off,

70
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:26,453
great big thank you to ira greenblatt

71
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,462
for working double shifts
on Christmas eve.

72
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:30,442
Way to show that spirit of the season,
buddy.

73
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:32,192
I got your back at Passover, dude.

74
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:33,993
But on the more negative note,

75
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:35,752
it has recently come to my attention

76
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:38,843
that some of the merchandise
in this store has gone missing.

77
00:05:39,258 --> 00:05:42,753
I fear that
we have been victims of shoplifting.

78
00:05:43,756 --> 00:05:45,002
What was stolen?

79
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,381
I'm not at liberty to discuss
that information right now, Andi.

80
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:50,261
But I don't think
I need to tell you guys

81
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:54,273
that shoplifting is a very,
very serious crime.

82
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:56,922
- Hurts us all, Ted.
- Yes it does, Sam.

83
00:05:57,047 --> 00:05:58,023
Yes, it does.

84
00:05:58,396 --> 00:06:00,821
And that's why we are going
on the offensive.

85
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:03,901
We will be installing an extensive
video system throughout the store.

86
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:06,012
I'm sure that will be

87
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:09,682
a deterrent for our so-called
"customers" with sticky fingers.

88
00:06:09,808 --> 00:06:11,330
So let's get out there, people.

89
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,201
Remember, keep those lookin' balls open.

90
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:15,252
- Let's get these guys!
- Let's get 'em.

91
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:20,071
All right, boys, let's roll.

92
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:22,323
- Hey, will you cover for us?
- Where are you going?

93
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,693
I finally found a sick apartment.
Gonna go check it out.

94
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,570
- Did you not hear Ted's speech?
- I live here, Ben.

95
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:32,501
It's not stealing if it's
your own house, come on.

96
00:06:39,386 --> 00:06:42,130
Take a look, boys.
What do you think of this?

97
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:44,262
How much do you pay for this, again?

98
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:46,633
Only $1,200 a month.
It was a total steal.

99
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:48,822
- You're a freakin' Jesse James.
- I know.

100
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:51,882
Sock, have you not seen your paycheck?
You don't make $1,200 a month.

101
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:53,250
All I need is 4.

102
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:56,551
So where are you going to get the rest?
From your mom?

103
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:58,102
From you guys.

104
00:06:58,228 --> 00:06:59,073
What?!

105
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,601
We're gonna be roomies.

106
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:03,283
I forged you guys' signatures
on the lease! Isn't that wicked?!

107
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:05,230
No, Sock,
the last thing I need right now

108
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,261
is my name on another contract
I didn't sign.

109
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:09,160
Dude, you should have talked
to us first!

110
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:10,891
Look, if I'd have of waited,

111
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,210
this place would have gone
like hot cakes, all right?

112
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:14,721
We'll get the porn channels.

113
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,133
We'll put a foosball table over there,
maybe a little tiki bar,

114
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:20,632
a hookah pipe.
I don't know, whatever we want.

115
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:27,632
It's on you, dude. I mean,

116
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,381
- we did say we wanted our own place.
- Benji's in. Sammy, it's down to you.

117
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:32,852
I don't know, man!

118
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:36,210
Look... Ben, excuse us. Come here.

119
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:40,073
OK, listen to me.
I did not want to play this card,

120
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:42,843
I really didn't,
but you leave me no choice.

121
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:45,422
The fact of the matter is, you owe me.

122
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:48,763
You owe me, all right?
I've been there since the beginning,

123
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:51,830
helping you send
escaped souls back to hell, man!

124
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:54,842
I've been the friggin' Robin
to your Batman.

125
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:56,382
What does that make me?

126
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:58,672
You're the weird english butler guy.

127
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:02,312
Listen, I need a bat cave.
Sammy, I deserve a bat cave.

128
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,313
- I'm Batman?
- You're Batman.

129
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:12,311
You want to move out?

130
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:16,133
Well, I'm 21, and I can't live
with my parents forever.

131
00:08:17,138 --> 00:08:18,881
Well, no, not forever, Sam.

132
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:21,363
But we thought you'd be around
for at least a few more years.

133
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:22,823
Come on, mom, dad.

134
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:25,643
We all know that Sam's gotta bust out
of this joint sometime, right?

135
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:28,702
- Plus, my place is awesome.
- It's not like I'm moving to Australia.

136
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:31,370
- It'll be 5, 10 minutes away.
- 20, max.

137
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,662
- I don't know, Sam.
- Sam, I don't think

138
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:36,850
- you're ready to live on your own.
- Those are mine.

139
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:39,502
- Thanks.
- Your mom's right, Sam.

140
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:41,512
It's a dangerous world out there, and...

141
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,383
Dangerous? Dad, really, dangerous?

142
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:45,132
I think I can handle living downtown.

143
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:47,060
Well, what are you going
to do about food?

144
00:08:47,184 --> 00:08:48,135
I'll cook.

145
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:50,139
I watch naked chef a lot.

146
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:51,709
How hard can it be?

147
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:53,701
This move will be good for me,
all right?

148
00:08:53,905 --> 00:08:56,490
I'll learn to do things on my own.
For the first time in my life,

149
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:58,510
I'll be totally independent.

150
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:02,562
If it's that important to you, then...

151
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:05,430
You have our support.

152
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:07,071
Yes!

153
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,193
Thank you, dad.

154
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:22,201
Finally leaving the nest, huh?

155
00:09:23,136 --> 00:09:25,010
Finally coming out of the closet, huh?

156
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:27,280
Oh, a homosexual joke. Very witty.

157
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,012
You're quite a hot shot now, huh, Sam?

158
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,723
What with moving out and all.

159
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:35,160
All right, can we just be adults
and get on with this?

160
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:36,632
Oh, sure we can.

161
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:39,691
You're a big boy now, huh?

162
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:42,813
Here, let me help you with this,
big boy.

163
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:47,690
A playground, clever.

164
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:49,950
Well, I thought you'd appreciate
the irony.

165
00:09:50,218 --> 00:09:51,760
Right. Can we get on with this?

166
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:53,950
- Someone's testy today.
- No, I'm not testy.

167
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:56,571
I've done this so many damn times,
and I'm tired of you treating me

168
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:58,760
like I'm a 4-year-old.
I know what I'm doing.

169
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:00,531
As you wish, Mr. Oliver.

170
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:04,923
In life, the soul is known
as Herbert Scrim.

171
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:08,690
A total hermit, lived in the woods.

172
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:11,341
He made the unabomber
look like a social butterfly.

173
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,382
OK, so what's his deal?

174
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:15,350
Well, Herbert was a hunter.

175
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:19,283
And he killed anyone who dare
run through his neck of the woods.

176
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:22,843
And now that his hunting grounds
have turned into a city park,

177
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:24,293
there's a lot more prey.

178
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,273
Where do I find him?

179
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:28,383
In there.

180
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:33,031
But you be careful, Sammy.
This soul's a tricky one.

181
00:10:33,576 --> 00:10:36,450
All the years that he lived,
he was hardly ever seen.

182
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:38,821
I know, I get it, but what's his deal?

183
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:40,550
Like, electroshocks, bugs, what?

184
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:42,513
I don't know what you're talking about.

185
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:45,261
You've graduated, my man.
You're moving on up.

186
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:47,130
This time, it's just you,

187
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:49,583
and your new found confidence.

188
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:01,763
- Why are we doing this, again?
- Come on, Andi, they're our friends.

189
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:03,672
Aren't you curious
about their new place?

190
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:06,041
No, you are up to no good, I know it.

191
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:10,512
Our first house guest.

192
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:12,580
No, I think it's my waterbed.

193
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:13,943
Boo-yah!

194
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:15,721
Hi. It's you.

195
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,222
- Hey.
- Hey.

196
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:19,261
Look who's finally becoming a man.

197
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,420
You just made it look like so much fun.

198
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:23,712
- Where did you guys find this place?
- We lucked out.

199
00:11:23,837 --> 00:11:25,760
I think, um,
it actually used to be a meth lab,

200
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,133
- like 2 days ago.
- You didn't tell me that.

201
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:29,673
Oh, jeez.

202
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:32,130
Ah-ah, Josie, hands off my stuff.

203
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:34,933
- You mean my stuff.
- I was going to give that back.

204
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:41,163
- All right, R2-D2 or Princess Leia?
- Definitely R2-D2.

205
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:43,130
Last time I checked,
you don't live here.

206
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:44,820
Benji, who would you rather bone?

207
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:47,991
A hot chick in a gold bikini,
or a bleep-blop robot?

208
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:50,603
- Point taken.
- Thank you.

209
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:52,193
So, Sam...

210
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:53,902
Where's Cady?

211
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:56,362
I haven't... told her I'm moving yet.

212
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,371
- You haven't?
- No.

213
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:08,152
So did you tell Sam
about Cady's little psycho visit?

214
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:10,200
No, but that is not my place.

215
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:11,571
Not your place?

216
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:14,763
Sam is your friend. If I was dating
Ted bundy, I'd want you to tell me.

217
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:17,222
- OK, that's very different.
- No, it is not different.

218
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:20,132
I think you owe it to him
to say something.

219
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:22,571
No, if I say
one little negative thing about Cady,

220
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:24,853
I'm gonna look like a weird,
jealous freak.

221
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:28,142
- Are you jealous?
- No. No, I'm not.

222
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:29,943
I mean, Sam and I are just friends.

223
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:32,441
- I've said it a hundred times.
- Andi, I'm your best friend.

224
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:34,262
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.

225
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:38,340
Look... if you have feelings for Sam,
you should say something.

226
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:43,030
Especially when this Cady girl
seems to be nothing but bad news.

227
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:45,662
No, no. He is with Cady.
I just have to accept it.

228
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:50,030
You know,
he didn't even tell her he moved.

229
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:52,590
Maybe he's already
figured it out for himself.

230
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:58,072
<i>This is the second body dumped
in the park in the last 2 weeks.</i>

231
00:12:58,196 --> 00:12:59,572
<i>Police are asking anyone</i>

232
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,350
<i>who have seen or heard anything
to please come forward.</i>

233
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:05,761
<i>Reporting from Burberry Park, this is
Maureen Glenroy. Back to you, Rick.</i>

234
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,571
That's gotta be our guy.
Devil said he was a hunter.

235
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:10,840
Why is he killing so many people?

236
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:12,953
Must be the thrill of the kill.

237
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:16,522
How many people does he need
to kill before he's satisfied?

238
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:20,141
He's an escaped soul from hell, Benji.
He's never satisfied.

239
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:21,950
Oh, hey, look, look, look.

240
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:23,720
First housewarming gift.

241
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:27,171
Very funny, Devil.

242
00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:29,683
Open it, go.

243
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:36,690
Oh, dude, dude! Magic bullet, oh!
I've wanted one of these forever.

244
00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:38,273
- What is it?
- Vibrator?

245
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:40,720
Are you kidding me? A vibrator?

246
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:44,262
No. This is actually the coolest kitchen
appliance known to man.

247
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:45,510
All right, bar none,

248
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:48,702
the best counter top food processor
out there on the infomercial market.

249
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:51,583
I've been saving up 3 easy payments of
nineteen ninety nuff for this bad boy.

250
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:53,762
"No confusing buttons, no messy cords.

251
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:57,492
"A battery-operated processor
that is both functional and fun.

252
00:13:57,616 --> 00:13:59,211
"Nothing could be more simple."

253
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:00,650
- How does it...
- See?

254
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:03,440
Does it work...

255
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:09,720
What the hell?

256
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:11,442
Dude!

257
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:21,172
You missed a spot.

258
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:23,203
What are you doing here?

259
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:25,260
Just brought you a white hot chocolate.

260
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:29,450
Went to your place today,
but your parents said you moved out.

261
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:31,220
Were you gonna tell me?

262
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:33,573
Yeah, no,
Sock found us a place, and it just...

263
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:35,570
it happened really quickly, so...

264
00:14:35,695 --> 00:14:37,922
You didn't think I needed to know?

265
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:40,890
No, of course you needed to know.
I just...

266
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,390
I'm telling you now.

267
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:46,122
- So we're OK?
- Yeah, yeah, we're OK.

268
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:50,232
What's with the cameras?

269
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:53,293
Ted's waging a war against shoplifters.

270
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:55,610
He's installing
a whole new security system.

271
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:57,231
Think he's watching us right now?

272
00:14:58,825 --> 00:14:59,820
Probably.

273
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:02,070
You want to give him something
to look at?

274
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:09,691
What?

275
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:12,150
Uh, nothing. Nothing.

276
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:29,893
Are you... are you all right?

277
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:31,862
Yeah. That was weird, right?

278
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:33,803
Yeah, that was really weird.

279
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:35,461
Are... you're good?

280
00:15:37,655 --> 00:15:38,791
I should...

281
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,101
I should clean this up.

282
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:42,231
Do you want to have dinner tonight?

283
00:15:43,635 --> 00:15:45,453
You know, I got a lot of stuff to do.

284
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,342
I'm... I'm... I got boxes to unpack.

285
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:49,533
My apartment's a mess, and...

286
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,011
But I'll...
I'll call you. I'll give you a call.

287
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:54,281
OK. Well, I'll let you get to it.

288
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:03,950
Maybe there was a flaw
in the glass already, Sam.

289
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:06,620
No, it's like
she somehow made it happen.

290
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:08,881
Maybe you made it happen.

291
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,360
You're crackin', man.

292
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,532
It's giving me the creeps.
Every time I look at her,

293
00:16:12,658 --> 00:16:14,141
it's all I can think about.

294
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,131
I don't know.
Maybe I should break up with her.

295
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:18,381
OK, boys. All right.

296
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:21,381
You guys ready for a little braingasm,

297
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:23,203
ultimate gaming experience?

298
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:24,870
This is a thing of beauty.

299
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:27,881
All right, let's fire this bitch up.
Let's go.

300
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,370
Oh, my god.

301
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:32,622
- Heaven.
- Let's go.

302
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,210
What did you do?! What'd you press?

303
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:39,193
I did not touch anything.

304
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,883
Look, the sooner we figure it out,
the sooner we can be lounging.

305
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:43,572
Let's ask these guys what's going on.

306
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:46,262
- Or ladies. Never know.
- I was beating your ass, too.

307
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:47,761
- You were not.
- Yes, I was.

308
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:49,701
- Hi there.
- Hi, sorry to bother you.

309
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:52,673
- We just moved in next door.
- Oh. Hi, great.

310
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:54,011
Welcome, I'm Steve.

311
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,080
Sam, and this is Sock and Ben.

312
00:16:57,265 --> 00:17:01,141
- Sock. Well, that's an unusual name.
<i>- Is that the UPS guy?</i>

313
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:03,490
- It's the new neighbors.
- Is he hitting on me?

314
00:17:03,618 --> 00:17:05,883
- He's not hitting on you.
- This is my partner Tony.

315
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:07,810
- Hi, fellas.
- Hi.

316
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:10,321
Would you guys like to come in?
I just made a pot of ginger tea.

317
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,993
No, no, thanks. We're straight.

318
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,202
No, no, thank you.

319
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:16,072
Actually, we just came in to...

320
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:18,761
We were wondering if you could
help us with something.

321
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:19,881
With what?

322
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:22,820
All right!

323
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:25,893
You are quite the handy man.

324
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,953
Hey, you fellas have
a couple light bulbs out.

325
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:30,391
- I could fix that for you.
- No, that's all right.

326
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,260
We hardly use the kitchen, anyway.

327
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,072
Whoa, whoa, speak for yourself, man.

328
00:17:34,197 --> 00:17:36,062
I practically am the naked chef.

329
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,870
Not that I cook naked.

330
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:40,700
You guys want a drink or anything?

331
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,570
- I would.
- Yeah, sure.

332
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:44,322
We don't have anything in the fridge.

333
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:47,382
That is maybe the saddest
looking refrigerator I've ever seen.

334
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:48,732
Tell you guys what.

335
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:51,891
Tomorrow night, you're coming over
to our place for a home-cooked meal,

336
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:54,703
and I hope you're not watching
your carbs, because I am thinking pasta.

337
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:57,272
Oh, my god. You guys are in for a treat.

338
00:17:57,635 --> 00:18:00,642
Steve makes the most delicious lobster
mac and cheese.

339
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:03,191
He poaches the lobster
in a beurre blanc...

340
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:06,102
- Beurre blanc.
- Sauce, with mascarpone cheese.

341
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:07,951
- Unbelievable.
- Oh, beautiful.

342
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:11,050
The mascarpone perfectly neutralizes
the natural sweetness of the lobster.

343
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:13,363
The food network.

344
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:16,591
- So what do you guys say?
- I say what time do we show up?

345
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:17,872
It's a date.

346
00:18:18,757 --> 00:18:20,700
Get together. With some dudes.

347
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,831
All right,
listen, I'm just going to say this once.

348
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:26,871
I am not into dudes but I think
I kind of love Steve and Tony.

349
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:28,823
I know. They're awesome, huh?

350
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:31,141
I gotta hand it to you, Sock.
This place is pretty good.

351
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:33,901
Didn't I tell you you'd love it?
Did I not tell you you'd love it?

352
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:36,332
All right, let's go out to the woods,
catch this soul bitch.

353
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:38,511
- I got places to be.
- Like where?

354
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:40,580
Like, the Work Bench.

355
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:42,370
You picked up an extra shift?

356
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:44,581
Hey, man, I got rent to pay now.

357
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,570
That's really responsible of you.

358
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:50,422
I know. No, I'm just messing with you.

359
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,510
No, I got to hook up
with this chick at the pool.

360
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:54,553
Met her in the elevator.
She is so into me.

361
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:02,030
Hey, nice headband, bro.

362
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:03,312
It's good.

363
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:07,392
Don't these trees look familiar?

364
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:09,892
It's a forest, Sam.
They all look the same.

365
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:13,450
- But I feel like we're going in circles.
- This park is ridiculously huge.

366
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:15,920
How are we supposed to find the soul?

367
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,640
We should get a bird's eye view.

368
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:19,763
All right.

369
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:23,131
All right.

370
00:19:23,256 --> 00:19:24,662
- Who's climbing it?
- Ben.

371
00:19:25,105 --> 00:19:27,161
Come on, guys,
I've never climbed a tree before.

372
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:28,503
- Come on.
- What?!

373
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,083
Well, my parents were
a little overprotective. So what?

374
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:33,370
All right, you know what,
it's time you became a man.

375
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:36,580
I'll give you a boost. Hold this.
Hang on to my baby!

376
00:19:36,705 --> 00:19:38,570
I don't know
if she's under warranty still.

377
00:19:38,697 --> 00:19:39,823
Give me your foot.

378
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:42,192
I can't believe I'm climbing a tree.

379
00:19:48,078 --> 00:19:50,823
I can't believe I'm actually
climbing a tree.

380
00:19:50,947 --> 00:19:52,273
I feel like Spiderman.

381
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:04,423
- The view is amazing, guys.
- The soul?

382
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:07,522
- Keep your eye on the ball, buddy.
- OK.

383
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:08,770
OK.

384
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:20,051
Benji! Oh, my god!

385
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:22,293
Ben, are you all right?

386
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:23,763
Oh, don't move.

387
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,422
Dead guy, dead guy, dead guy!

388
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:39,951
I'm an injured man. Take it easy.

389
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,933
You fell out of a tree. Shake it off.

390
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:44,350
Victim was Frank oore. He was 31.

391
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:48,153
God, I can't believe the soul was right
underneath our noses the whole time.

392
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:49,273
Poor Frank.

393
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:51,741
I always knew jogging was bad for you.

394
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,293
- We should go jogging.
- Are you kidding me? Did you...

395
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:57,360
Did you not just hear me
say jogging bad?

396
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,583
No, Sock, think about it. What better way
to lure him out into the open?

397
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,252
All right,
wait, let me get this straight.

398
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:06,581
You want us to go jogging

399
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:09,520
in the creepy woods where
the soul has been killing people?

400
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:11,772
- Yeah.
- OK, let's go.

401
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:16,582
I knew this was a bad idea, Sam.

402
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:18,462
Why did I let you talk me into this?

403
00:21:18,588 --> 00:21:20,461
All right, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

404
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:22,272
I can't... I can't breathe.

405
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:23,393
Let's stop.

406
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:25,461
All right,
all right, let's take a breather.

407
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:26,580
OK.

408
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,770
I'm not loving this outfit either, Sam.

409
00:21:29,898 --> 00:21:32,790
- I feel like a giant traffic cone.
- Sock, we want the soul to see us.

410
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,122
I'm pretty sure the space shuttle
could see us, Ben.

411
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:36,082
All right.

412
00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:37,960
Come on. We gotta keep moving. Let's go.

413
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:39,082
Come on.

414
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,260
Come on!

415
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,332
OK.

416
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:47,850
OK, let's go.

417
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:51,913
OK, I got another one.

418
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:53,993
- Super Girl or Wonder Woman?
- Wonder woman.

419
00:21:54,117 --> 00:21:55,301
Definitely Wonder Woman.

420
00:21:55,426 --> 00:21:57,800
Something to be said for a woman
who's into bondage, you know?

421
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:58,903
Love it.

422
00:21:59,258 --> 00:22:00,342
Who was that? Cady?

423
00:22:00,468 --> 00:22:02,742
- I don't want to talk to her right now.
- I don't know.

424
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:06,212
You ignore the spawn of Satan,
something bad might happen.

425
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,460
- What was that?
- Come on.

426
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:12,171
Oh, my god.

427
00:22:17,055 --> 00:22:18,401
He broke her neck.

428
00:22:19,928 --> 00:22:22,470
- I think he's close.
- Yeah, you think?

429
00:22:23,615 --> 00:22:24,762
What was that?

430
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:26,162
Where is he?

431
00:22:44,115 --> 00:22:45,810
Don't... move.

432
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:47,003
- What?
- What?

433
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:48,413
- What?
- Why?

434
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:51,643
God! Oh, god!

435
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,160
Guys, get me out of here!

436
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:56,453
- Calm down, Sock, we'll get you out.
- No, get the soul!

437
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:59,440
- You just said to get you out!
- I know! I know, stop!

438
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:02,281
- You have to get me out! Get me out!
- Make up your mind! What do you want?

439
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:04,023
Get the soul! Get it!

440
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,033
What?

441
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:08,562
- He's here, he's here.
- What?

442
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:12,143
OK, come on. Come on out, Herbert!

443
00:23:12,305 --> 00:23:13,951
It's over, let's go!

444
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,003
Oh, god. Guys, look out!

445
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:20,371
Sam, Sam!

446
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:22,690
Ben, Sam!

447
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:32,051
Sam! I don't know how to do it!

448
00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:34,120
How do you make it work?

449
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:35,373
Oh, my god!

450
00:23:42,348 --> 00:23:44,811
Hey, come on.
Come on!

451
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:53,672
I said come!

452
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,252
I'm so sorry.
I hope they didn't scare you.

453
00:23:56,698 --> 00:23:58,211
No, no, it's... We love dogs!

454
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:09,032
Dude, this idea of yours better work.

455
00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:12,131
It will. There's only one way
to make an invisible soul visible.

456
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:13,250
Paint ball!

457
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:15,133
I kill at paint ball.

458
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:17,563
Hey, maybe you should ask
the devil to help us on this one.

459
00:24:17,685 --> 00:24:20,560
He's not going to help us.
He loves watching me freak out.

460
00:24:20,686 --> 00:24:23,561
<i>Sam Oliver, your assistance
is required in aisle four.</i>

461
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:25,883
I gotta go help Ted install
those new security cameras.

462
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:28,051
Will you guys take care of this?

463
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,751
Ready? Come on.

464
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:36,692
These cameras cost me
an arm and a leg, Sam.

465
00:24:36,815 --> 00:24:38,161
Watch it up there.

466
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:44,961
The innocence of youth.

467
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:48,193
I bet the last time you sat
at one of these little desks,

468
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:50,361
you had dreams of great things.

469
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,050
And look at you now, Sam.

470
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:56,502
Working a minimum wage job,
living in a dumpy apartment,

471
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:58,772
and doing the devil's dirty work.

472
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:01,501
- Seeing red now, Sammy?
- Very funny.

473
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,752
Why didn't you tell me
Herbert was invisible?

474
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,740
Well, I said
that nobody ever saw Herbert.

475
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:09,692
I figured with your genius wit,
you'd piece it together.

476
00:25:09,815 --> 00:25:12,300
Don't you know that being invisible
is the perfect camouflage?

477
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,551
I'm surprised at you, Sammy.

478
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,503
With all your new found confidence,

479
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:19,573
I thought you'd pass this test
with flying colors.

480
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,753
Looks like you're going to fail.

481
00:25:21,878 --> 00:25:24,623
No, I'm not going to fail.
Just give me something to work with.

482
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:25,740
Like these?

483
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:27,313
Glasses?

484
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:29,533
They help you see the true face of evil.

485
00:25:33,506 --> 00:25:35,553
You don't want to do that, Sam.

486
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:37,812
Trust me.

487
00:25:38,258 --> 00:25:40,000
Unless you brought
a change of underwear.

488
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:42,411
Well, go on, say it.

489
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:44,900
You're not as good
as you thought you were.

490
00:25:45,185 --> 00:25:47,133
- You need me.
- Forget that.

491
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:49,310
Take them back, you can have these.

492
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:50,563
I don't need you.

493
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:52,632
Oh, grumble, grumble, grumble.

494
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:56,013
I guess we're taking off
the training wheels.

495
00:25:56,376 --> 00:25:57,690
Yeah, I guess so.

496
00:25:57,816 --> 00:25:59,321
This'll be fun to watch.

497
00:25:59,445 --> 00:26:00,441
Oh, yeah.

498
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:02,313
Good luck, Sam.

499
00:26:20,566 --> 00:26:21,542
Hey, Andi.

500
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:23,482
Cady, hi.

501
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:25,351
You know what, Sam's not here.

502
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:27,380
I think he's making a delivery...
or something.

503
00:26:27,508 --> 00:26:29,441
That's OK.
I actually wanted to talk to you.

504
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:30,952
Oh, OK. Well, what's up?

505
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:33,163
Something going on with Sam?

506
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:35,091
Well, what do you mean?

507
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:38,060
He's been acting a little weird lately.

508
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:40,443
Yeah, he always acts weird.
I wouldn't worry about it.

509
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:43,042
Yeah, it's just he's been
a little distant with me.

510
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,000
You know, like I'd call him,

511
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,090
leave him a message,
and he hasn't called me back.

512
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:49,252
You know, maybe he's just preoccupied.

513
00:26:49,377 --> 00:26:50,860
You know, with the move and all.

514
00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:52,433
Yeah, the move.

515
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:57,431
I just can't help but wonder if maybe
it has something to do with you.

516
00:26:59,315 --> 00:27:00,313
Me?

517
00:27:01,027 --> 00:27:02,491
I know you and Sam had a thing.

518
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:04,562
Cady...

519
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:07,441
Listen. Me and Sam are friends.

520
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:08,480
That's it.

521
00:27:09,935 --> 00:27:12,491
Well, I just...
I really care about him, you know?

522
00:27:12,877 --> 00:27:14,701
I just wish I knew what was going on.

523
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,500
<i>We can see the soul
when we paint ball him,</i>

524
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:21,821
<i>but how the hell are we supposed
to track where he is?</i>

525
00:27:21,947 --> 00:27:24,250
Maybe you should have kept
the glasses the devil gave to you.

526
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,180
We don't need him.
We can do it on our own.

527
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:27,883
Guys, please, would you knock it off?

528
00:27:28,008 --> 00:27:31,062
Can we just not talk
about demons and devils for 5 minutes?

529
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:34,073
I want to go in there.
I want to eat my gourmet mac and cheese,

530
00:27:34,197 --> 00:27:38,043
and I want to hang out with my 2
favorite domestic gods, all right?

531
00:27:39,816 --> 00:27:40,760
Just a minute.

532
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:44,250
- Nice threads.
- Thank you, I know.

533
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:46,111
Steve and Tony took me shopping.

534
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:48,810
It's like living next door
to queer eye for the straight guy.

535
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:51,442
- What's up with the power tools?
- I don't know.

536
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:53,241
Hey, right on time. Come on in.

537
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:54,440
All right!

538
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,903
- Nice place.
- Well, it's home.

539
00:27:57,686 --> 00:28:00,033
- Hey, who needs a drink?
- We brought beer.

540
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:02,003
That was very thoughtful.
Give that to him.

541
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:05,020
- I'm going to go get the hors d'oeuvres.
- You guys make yourselves comfortable.

542
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:06,851
- You, bar.
- Bar. All right, I like it.

543
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:09,893
- Yeah, you clean up nice.
- Thank you. Thank you.

544
00:28:10,628 --> 00:28:11,622
Oh, my god.

545
00:28:13,376 --> 00:28:15,693
You have an'89 glenfiddich
in a spode bottle?

546
00:28:15,817 --> 00:28:17,762
Glenfiddich, yeah. You a fan?

547
00:28:17,886 --> 00:28:19,382
Well, I mean, I knew it existed,

548
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:22,752
I just never thought I'd see
one up this close. It is beautiful.

549
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:23,992
And tasty-looking.

550
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:26,833
- Let me pour you a glass.
- OK.

551
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:31,211
You guys do a lot of charity work.

552
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:33,450
Well, we enjoy helping others.

553
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:35,313
It's good for the soul.

554
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:38,152
Yeah, I once gave a homeless guy

555
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:40,611
in front of the Work Bench
half my sandwich, so I can dig it.

556
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:42,293
- You remember that.
- I remember.

557
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,681
- Oh, that was kind of you.
- Fresh out of the oven.

558
00:28:44,946 --> 00:28:47,092
Who wants pancetta-wrapped shrimp?

559
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:49,311
God, yes.

560
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,251
Help yourselves, there's plenty
more where that came from.

561
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,693
But save room for the mac and cheese.

562
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,440
This is better than my mom's cooking.

563
00:28:57,565 --> 00:29:00,313
- Well, you know what emeril says...
- Pork fat rules.

564
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:04,002
Oh, man!

565
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:08,131
Don't worry about that. I've got
something that will take that right out.

566
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:10,691
Come with me to the kitchen.
You boys continue.

567
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:15,442
Tony spills food on himself all the time.
I have to buy these pens in bulk.

568
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:21,200
Hey, Steven, what are those things?

569
00:29:22,148 --> 00:29:25,521
Those are, uh, power sanders.

570
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:27,890
We're putting up some crown molding.

571
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:31,722
- That's impressive.
- I'll you what's impressive.

572
00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:33,481
Check out the security system in here.

573
00:29:33,825 --> 00:29:36,840
I'm in home security,
so privacy is super important to us.

574
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:40,550
We got top of the line cameras all over,
and those motion detectors,

575
00:29:40,965 --> 00:29:44,111
they protect us against
all the threats you can't see.

576
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:46,460
Really?

577
00:29:46,835 --> 00:29:48,781
Yeah. And this shirt is done.

578
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:52,122
- Good as new.
- Thank you.

579
00:29:52,335 --> 00:29:53,583
Dinner's served.

580
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:07,012
George C. Scott says,
you gotta dress brave to be brave, boys.

581
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:10,580
- That was general patton, you idiot.
- Same guy.

582
00:30:10,706 --> 00:30:12,451
All right, let's do this.

583
00:30:13,016 --> 00:30:14,012
Go time.

584
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:32,892
What the...

585
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:36,981
You gotta be kidding me.

586
00:30:40,898 --> 00:30:42,740
- Morning, Ted.
- You see?

587
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,650
You see what I mean?

588
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,962
Yeah, you really are a morning person.

589
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:49,083
No, the cameras.
Somebody stole the cameras.

590
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:50,710
Are you serious?

591
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:53,161
- That's not funny.
- Yes, it is.

592
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:54,330
This is horrible.

593
00:30:54,455 --> 00:30:57,202
Now I gotta buy cameras
to watch the cameras.

594
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,763
- Well, is anything else missing?
- I guess not.

595
00:31:00,148 --> 00:31:02,262
- Well, you should be thankful.
- Thankful?

596
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:03,893
Thankful?

597
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:08,523
Whoa, what's with all the people?

598
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:10,391
What is... a charity run?

599
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,903
Yeah, right through
the soul's hunting ground.

600
00:31:13,025 --> 00:31:15,433
You might as well just put
a freakin' bulls eye on my back.

601
00:31:15,557 --> 00:31:17,253
All right, you know what, you know what?

602
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:19,083
You go kick invisible's ass. I got this.

603
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:20,831
Sock, how are you going to do that?

604
00:31:20,956 --> 00:31:23,653
In the words of Gandalf the Great,
they shall not pass.

605
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:27,641
- It's "You shall not pass."
- Whatever, Ben, it's a movie, OK?

606
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:29,452
Whatever.

607
00:31:29,585 --> 00:31:30,831
Go. Go, go, go.

608
00:31:35,647 --> 00:31:37,690
- What was that?
- A squirrel.

609
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,153
- Is that him?
- Woodpecker.

610
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:46,650
You're not much of a nature guy,
are you?

611
00:31:46,776 --> 00:31:49,822
I told you,
my parents were a little overprotective.

612
00:31:55,337 --> 00:31:56,682
Well, what is it?

613
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:57,890
He's close.

614
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:03,211
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

615
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:04,343
I'm sorry, stop!

616
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,023
I can't let you through here today.

617
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:08,341
We're with protect the trees.
We've got a permit.

618
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,131
Sorry, all permits have been revoked.

619
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:11,901
Give it, come on. Give it, give it.

620
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:13,670
- Excuse me?
- Give it!

621
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:18,213
We're just trying to protect the trees.

622
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:21,182
If you really want
to save and protect trees...

623
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:23,661
Show them some love.

624
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:25,521
Physically.

625
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,763
Come on out, Herbert! You coward!

626
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:42,650
That's right, yeah. Don't be shy.

627
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:44,141
Go on, pick a tree.

628
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:46,490
And just hug it, and don't ever let go.

629
00:32:46,968 --> 00:32:48,402
All right, everybody, enjoy.

630
00:32:48,527 --> 00:32:50,202
I'll be back in ten, OK?

631
00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:51,452
OK.

632
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:06,583
Get out the vessel!

633
00:33:06,705 --> 00:33:09,313
- What? I thought you had it!
- No, you had it! Do you remember?

634
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:10,653
No, I didn't!

635
00:33:13,397 --> 00:33:14,402
Sock!

636
00:33:29,028 --> 00:33:30,270
Hey, let him go!

637
00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:35,580
Sock!

638
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:38,712
Guys?

639
00:33:39,155 --> 00:33:40,153
I'm coming!

640
00:33:47,366 --> 00:33:48,441
Back off, Herbie!

641
00:33:52,718 --> 00:33:53,963
Face, Ben, face!

642
00:33:57,215 --> 00:33:59,063
Quick, throw me the vessel!

643
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:15,223
That's what I'm talkin' about!

644
00:34:19,096 --> 00:34:20,022
Oh, man.

645
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:22,420
- We got him.
- That was disgusting.

646
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:24,841
I'm officially over smoothies.

647
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:34,711
OK, would somebody tell me
what's going on with my cameras?

648
00:34:34,837 --> 00:34:36,583
Is this somebody's idea of a joke?

649
00:34:36,705 --> 00:34:38,250
'Cause it's not funny.

650
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,580
Please tell me you're the genius
who stole Ted's security system.

651
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:48,761
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

652
00:34:49,277 --> 00:34:51,590
So... how's Cady?

653
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:53,761
She's good.

654
00:34:54,597 --> 00:34:55,593
Good.

655
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:57,410
So you guys are good?

656
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:01,723
Andi, this is kind of weird.

657
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:04,400
I know, I know,
listen, she came to see me.

658
00:35:04,526 --> 00:35:06,523
She did...
what did she want? What did she say?

659
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:10,673
You know, it's actually
not what she said, more how she said it.

660
00:35:12,715 --> 00:35:14,060
What do you mean?

661
00:35:14,185 --> 00:35:16,400
Listen, I know that your personal
life is your business,

662
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:18,350
but I really would be careful with Cady.

663
00:35:19,466 --> 00:35:22,710
I just get a weird vibe,
and I thought you should know.

664
00:35:25,338 --> 00:35:26,330
All right.

665
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:38,922
Hey, classy digs, Sammy.

666
00:35:39,156 --> 00:35:41,071
I really like
what you've done with the place.

667
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:43,713
Look, I don't have time to play
host today. I gotta go meet Cady.

668
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:46,420
I sense tension in your voice.

669
00:35:47,526 --> 00:35:48,753
Trouble in paradise?

670
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:50,900
You don't need to worry about it.

671
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:52,573
Hey, hey, come on now.

672
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:56,970
I told you before,
you're much more than just an employee.

673
00:35:57,098 --> 00:35:58,323
I care about you.

674
00:36:02,028 --> 00:36:04,563
All right, fine, you know what?
There is something.

675
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:06,400
Ah. See, I knew it, I knew it.

676
00:36:06,526 --> 00:36:07,972
Go on. Lay it on me.

677
00:36:08,276 --> 00:36:09,820
Get it off your chest.

678
00:36:10,848 --> 00:36:12,421
You having trouble satisfying her?

679
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,423
No, I'm doing just fine, thank you.

680
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,972
Come on, I'm just trying
to have a little fun with you.

681
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:18,641
Don't be so sensitive.

682
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:20,131
Talk to me.

683
00:36:21,587 --> 00:36:24,340
All right, listen. I'm gonna ask you
something, and for once...

684
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:26,910
I need you to give me a straight answer.

685
00:36:27,216 --> 00:36:28,332
Sounds serious.

686
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:30,930
Will you tell me the truth?

687
00:36:31,777 --> 00:36:32,772
All right.

688
00:36:33,965 --> 00:36:35,230
Is Cady your daughter?

689
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:40,653
No.

690
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,181
- See, I don't believe you.
- And that's your problem.

691
00:36:45,445 --> 00:36:46,873
If you really like this girl,

692
00:36:47,035 --> 00:36:48,912
you shouldn't let anything
come between you.

693
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,411
Anyway, I just wanted
to congratulate you, man.

694
00:36:54,455 --> 00:36:57,121
Looks like you caught
Herbie all by yourself.

695
00:36:57,907 --> 00:37:00,200
I guess you really
don't need me all the time.

696
00:37:00,656 --> 00:37:01,900
Well, thank you.

697
00:37:02,217 --> 00:37:05,723
Hey, why don't you keep these
as a souvenir?

698
00:37:09,276 --> 00:37:12,052
You never know when you're going
to need to see somebody's...

699
00:37:12,177 --> 00:37:13,262
true colors.

700
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,021
Hey.

701
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:44,962
Hey.

702
00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:47,123
We need to talk.

703
00:37:47,385 --> 00:37:48,581
I know. I know.

704
00:37:50,588 --> 00:37:53,153
Listen, I know I've been distant,
and I'm...

705
00:37:53,277 --> 00:37:54,820
and I'm sorry, but...

706
00:37:56,528 --> 00:37:59,473
- The truth is...
- I don't want to hear it, Sam.

707
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:03,081
Look, I want to take some time.

708
00:38:04,025 --> 00:38:05,591
I'm gonna go down to New Mexico.

709
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:08,030
I'm going to see my mom
for a couple of days.

710
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:09,602
I need a little space.

711
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:11,332
Wait, what? No.

712
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:14,450
- Things are good.
- Things are not good.

713
00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:17,003
Sam, you don't return my phone calls.

714
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,770
You don't want to hang out with me.

715
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,513
You didn't even tell me you moved.

716
00:38:21,955 --> 00:38:23,051
I know.

717
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:24,623
I'm sorry.

718
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:28,753
Look, I think, um,

719
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:30,960
I think this will be good for us.

720
00:38:31,085 --> 00:38:32,833
We'll just take some time,

721
00:38:33,075 --> 00:38:34,560
and we'll think things through.

722
00:38:38,346 --> 00:38:40,193
We'll talk when I get back.

723
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:55,032
You know what, I never thought
I was a goat cheese person,

724
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:56,372
but this stuff isn't bad.

725
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:58,152
You should try the crap dip.

726
00:38:58,277 --> 00:38:59,712
I'm telling you, Steve and Tony,

727
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:01,280
new idols. I love those guys.

728
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:04,410
- They're going in my top 8.
- That's quite nice of you.

729
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,900
- Hey, buddy... hey.
- Hey.

730
00:39:08,027 --> 00:39:09,780
Can I get you something, or...?

731
00:39:09,906 --> 00:39:12,163
- Yeah, crap dip?
- No, no, I'm good.

732
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:14,781
Oh, don't worry about it,
Sammy, come on.

733
00:39:14,905 --> 00:39:16,721
Cady will come crawling back to you
in a week

734
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:18,940
when she realizes how much
she misses your man muscle.

735
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,710
Absolutely. It's just a hiatus.

736
00:39:21,286 --> 00:39:23,380
Hey, have you guys...
have you guys seen my shirts?

737
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:26,022
Yes. Yes, Steve and Tony have them.

738
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,320
- They need to be laundered, right?
- That's right.

739
00:39:30,597 --> 00:39:33,743
You guys think it's weird we replaced
our parents with a couple of gay dudes?

740
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,712
Weird, Sam? No. Genius.

741
00:39:47,526 --> 00:39:48,571
Steve? Tony?

742
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:53,022
Guys?

743
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:08,260
Sometimes I think it'd be easier
just to wear a hat.

744
00:40:09,966 --> 00:40:12,182
- What? No!
- Do you think I look fat?

745
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:15,081
No, you look great.
I think you've lost weight,

746
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:17,422
- 'cause the horns look bigger.
- Think I lost weight?

747
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:19,713
You look great. I'm really trying.

748
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,363
I know, you've been so disciplined,
and I really think...

749
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:27,453
What's a matter with you?
You look like you just saw a ghost.

750
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:29,840
No, worse. Demons.

751
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:31,062
What? Where?

752
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:32,643
Next door, Steve and Tony.

753
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:34,212
They're both demons.

754
00:40:34,635 --> 00:40:35,453
Oh, my...

755
00:40:35,577 --> 00:40:36,921
Thanks to Raceman for the transcript.

756
