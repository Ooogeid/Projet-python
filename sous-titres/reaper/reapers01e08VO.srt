1
00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:21,283
This looks nothing
like a chair.

2
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:23,741
Yeah, maybe we should
throw it away.

3
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,708
Whoa, whoa. Hold up. Hold up.

4
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:26,730
What?

5
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:30,091
We have got a very special
guest at the Bench today.

6
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:33,378
Is that Gladys from the DMW?

7
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:36,945
This is too weird.

8
00:00:37,264 --> 00:00:40,617
There's a demon
buying paper towels.

9
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:42,760
Oh, my brain is itchy.

10
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:44,510
Wh-wh-wh-wh-what,

11
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:47,056
do demons live just
like regular people?

12
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:49,795
I mean, do they sleep?
Do they eat?

13
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:53,347
Apparently they go
to the bathroom.

14
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,930
A lot.

15
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:57,551
I've got so many more questions.
I need answers.

16
00:00:57,588 --> 00:00:59,371
Sock. Sock,
don't do anything stupid.

17
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:02,523
Sam, I am almost certainly
going to do something stupid.

18
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:04,890
It's in my blood.
You know that.

19
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:21,572
- Andi. Andi!
- What?

20
00:01:21,587 --> 00:01:23,253
I think I lost something
in this register.

21
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:24,933
No, what do you mean?
Ted said that I gotta--

22
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:26,391
Forget about Ted.
I'll buy you a shot later.

23
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:28,632
- Please just go.
- Easy, weirdo.

24
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:30,440
Yeah, right. I'm the weirdo.

25
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:33,402
I'm open on 4. Open on 4.

26
00:01:38,235 --> 00:01:39,760
So, glad bags,

27
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:42,581
I was just watching you
shopping around the Bench,

28
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:43,921
and I got to wondering

29
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:45,950
what does a pretty young
demon like yourself

30
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:48,231
do when she's not shippin'
souls off to hell.

31
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:50,190
Do you take these?

32
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:52,462
Coupons?

33
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:55,373
El diablo not forkin'
out the big bucks, huh?

34
00:01:55,716 --> 00:02:00,000
Just ring me up so I never
have to come back here.

35
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:03,210
Come on, Gladys.
Don't be such a sourpuss, ok?

36
00:02:03,488 --> 00:02:04,613
Listen, hey,

37
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,282
I'll load up your car.
We'll go inside,

38
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:07,850
and I'll buy you a smoothie.
What do you say?

39
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:10,782
Hot dog, maybe?
Churro. No? All right.

40
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:30,552
You're welcome.

41
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:35,781
Whoa, what are you
gonna do, Gladys?

42
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,132
You gonna hit me in the
middle of the parking lot

43
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:41,010
with all these people watchin'?
You don't got the stones.

44
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,270
Not even clo--

45
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,613
Have a nice day.

46
00:02:56,515 --> 00:03:01,862
Season 1, Episode 8 - The Cop
For www.forom.com

47
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:06,870
Dedication, drive, desire...

48
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:09,490
and fantastic personal hygiene.

49
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:11,712
Don't think I didn't notice,
Frank Poole.

50
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:14,452
Get up here and accept your
employee of the month award.

51
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:16,122
Hey, Frankie!

52
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:18,142
Always did smell good.

53
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,920
So it's your birthday
in a couple days.

54
00:03:20,956 --> 00:03:22,753
- What do you wanna do?
- I don't know.

55
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,301
Why don't we just do
somethin' low-key,

56
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,313
you know, maybe go to a movie,
maybe you guys, Josie, Greg.

57
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:30,053
As for our next category,
dog of the month,

58
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,481
for the employee that shows
an utter lack of, well...

59
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:34,901
everything.

60
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:37,601
Ok. Winner, winner,
chicken dinner, Theodore.

61
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:41,253
- I will accept your award with--
- Dog of the month goes to Sam.

62
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,563
- Whoa, what?
- What?

63
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:44,590
No, no, no.
I demand a recount, Ted.

64
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:46,882
I've had that award going
on 9 months now in a row.

65
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:49,411
As dog of the month, your
responsibility will be to clean the gum

66
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:51,203
out of the inside
of the dumpster.

67
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:53,040
You are indeed the
better man, Sam.

68
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:54,570
You have earned it.

69
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:10,722
What the hell?

70
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:13,510
Wine?

71
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:19,861
1982 Château Mouton-Rothschild.

72
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:21,371
Only the best for you.

73
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:22,700
Prost.

74
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:25,563
Oh, you might wanna take
off that rubber, buddy.

75
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:31,673
- Ok, so what's the catch?
- No catch. This is all for you.

76
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:41,113
That lobster will
melt in your mouth.

77
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:43,750
There's no way you're
being this nice to me.

78
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:46,803
Hey, I'm not Ted. What a dick.

79
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:48,431
Dog of the month?

80
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:50,250
You just put that
out of your mind.

81
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:54,701
You, Sam,
are my employee of the month.

82
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,202
- What is that?
- Open it.

83
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:02,992
Ah. Put it on.

84
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:08,493
Oh, that looks good, handsome.

85
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:10,670
This is really nice.

86
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:12,991
Just a small token
of my appreciation.

87
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:14,332
When you look at it,

88
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,713
I hope you can think of me fondly,
if you can.

89
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,861
But I'll be happy if
you just wear it.

90
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:21,441
And finally...

91
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:26,162
the case file for the
next escaped soul.

92
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:30,003
"Curtis Dean Mays."

93
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:31,812
Yeah. One mean dude,

94
00:05:32,046 --> 00:05:33,211
multiple murderer.

95
00:05:33,277 --> 00:05:36,323
The authorities caught him 10 years ago,
put a needle in his arm.

96
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:38,340
But he's back,
and he's killing again.

97
00:05:38,597 --> 00:05:41,761
People will say it's the work
of a copycat, but it's Mays.

98
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:43,591
He wants revenge.

99
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,972
You're giving me all this,
and there's no catch?

100
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,201
Will you please just
take it for what it is?

101
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:51,861
My way of making your
life a little nicer.

102
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:55,642
Can you get somebody to
clean out the dumpster?

103
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:58,912
When you're ready, sir.

104
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:05,460
- Press enter.
- No, don't.

105
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:06,801
Right there. There.

106
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:08,553
All right, look,
last time she was here,

107
00:06:08,586 --> 00:06:10,893
she bought electrical
tape and some tarps.

108
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,671
- What are you guys doin'?
- Hey.

109
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:13,833
Oh, Sock's checkin'
the computer

110
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:15,911
to see what Gladys
buys while she's here.

111
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:17,973
Oh, enough with Gladys already.
You guys, come on.

112
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:19,531
No, look, look,
look, look, look.

113
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,671
On September 3,
she bought twine, a shovel,

114
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:23,712
- and 4 boxes of rat poison.
- So?

115
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:26,672
Well, Sam,
a demon doesn't wanna poison rats.

116
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,423
In fact, they're probably one
of their 4 major food groups.

117
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,503
Maybe she isn't using
the poison on rats.

118
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:33,893
Maybe it's up to us to figure
out what she is using it on.

119
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:36,070
You guys,
Gladys is gonna have to wait, ok?

120
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:38,212
We have more important
business right now.

121
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:40,873
That's a mean-lookin' dude.

122
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:43,841
I'm sorry, but if you name
your kid Curtis Dean Mays,

123
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,820
you're beggin' for
him to be a killer.

124
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:47,702
See any birds in these tattoos?

125
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:49,881
I don't think so. Why?

126
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,120
Ah, birdie.

127
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:56,350
Yeah. I don't know
what it means yet.

128
00:06:56,838 --> 00:06:58,370
I--I don't know what
we're lookin' for.

129
00:06:58,407 --> 00:07:00,270
The devil says Mays
is out for revenge.

130
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:03,180
- Against who?
- I don't know.

131
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:05,652
We've got all the names of the
people involved in the trial.

132
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:08,153
We've got defense lawyer,
prosecutor, judge.

133
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:11,112
Maybe one of them can tell
us where to start looking.

134
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:16,931
Remove all metallic items
from your pockets, please.

135
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:24,351
- What is wrong with you? Stop it.
- Ah, this tattoo is so itchy.

136
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:26,841
Oh, great.

137
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:28,612
Got another one.

138
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:30,123
What does it mean?

139
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:32,932
- Bird 6.
- Red--red 6.

140
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:34,912
Uh, sex bird. Sexy bird.

141
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,821
Sex--dirty bird.
Dirty, sexy bird.

142
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,033
Please, remove any metallic
items from your pockets.

143
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:45,170
Hey, what's-- what's that?

144
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:46,956
That's Andi's birthday present.

145
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:48,455
- Wanna see it?
- Yeah.

146
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,997
She saw it in the store,

147
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:52,331
and I went back
and got it for her.

148
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,463
- Nice, huh?
- My god.

149
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:56,072
- Yep, yep.
- What?

150
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:57,541
Dude, you cannot
give that to her.

151
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,003
Yeah. Yeah, I can.

152
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:01,620
- Uh, doctor, if you would, please?
- Absolutely.

153
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:03,243
Do not give that to her.

154
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:05,702
- Why not?
- 'Cause it has a diamond on it, Sam.

155
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,202
Yeah, a really small diamond.

156
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:08,970
Sam, that's a present you
would give your wife, ok?

157
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:10,200
You guys, it's stupid.
We're friends.

158
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:12,070
- I'm giving her a friend present.
- Wife present.

159
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:13,382
- Shut up.
- Sam,

160
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:15,281
it's something Greg
would give her,

161
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,990
and you're not her boyfriend.
He is.

162
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,051
- Go ahead.
- I mean, think about it.

163
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:22,342
You give that to her,
you're basically saying

164
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,421
you want the
relationship to change.

165
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:27,072
- You sure you wanna do that?
- Go ahead.

166
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:28,460
All right, fine.

167
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,143
- I'll get her something else.
- Thank you.

168
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,243
Do you have any metallic
items in your pocket?

169
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:38,300
Let's go.

170
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,850
- Which way?
- This way.

171
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:41,580
Go ahead.

172
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:13,851
- So, uh, what's your book about?
- True crime, sir.

173
00:09:14,158 --> 00:09:16,002
We're writing about
Curtis Dean Mays.

174
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:18,931
Mays. Nasty piece of work.

175
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,411
Well, good thing we eat
nasty for breakfast.

176
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:24,852
Mays kept the police runnin'
around in circles for a long time,

177
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:26,481
always changed his M.O.,

178
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:28,492
never used the
same weapon twice.

179
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:31,873
Uh, was there anybody Mays
blamed for his conviction?

180
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:33,430
Everyone but himself.

181
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:37,000
He even attacked his own defense
lawyer when the verdict came in.

182
00:09:38,106 --> 00:09:39,942
Funny. He's dead now.

183
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:42,702
- The lawyer?
- Yeah.

184
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:46,392
They found his body 2 days
ago shot in the head.

185
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:48,753
Oh, my god.
Do--do you have any leads?

186
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:52,191
Well, I'm not at liberty to
discuss any ongoing investigation,

187
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:54,732
but it looks like we might
have a copycat killer.

188
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,082
Ooh. Copyca...

189
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:03,243
Hey, Evan.
I've got those briefs for you.

190
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,431
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
that you were in a meeting.

191
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:10,112
Oh, it's ok. These guys are
writing about Curtis Dean Mays.

192
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:12,330
Hmm. What a
fascinating subject.

193
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:14,692
What inspired you
to write about him?

194
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:18,222
- We wouldn't want to bore you.
- Could never happen.

195
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:21,662
I am a huge fan of
the true crime genre.

196
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:24,450
- Who is that?
- Surely there were some books

197
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:26,522
that have influenced your work.

198
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:30,273
Murder, she wrote,
the book...version.

199
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:33,593
And clue,
the board game... book.

200
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:36,252
They made a book.

201
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,302
Oh, god.

202
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:47,742
Oh, my god. It's Judge Collins.

203
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:57,392
Hey, listen to this.

204
00:10:57,515 --> 00:11:00,771
Judge Collins presided over the
Curtis Dean Mays murder trial.

205
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:02,272
Yeah, he killed his lawyer,
now the judge.

206
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:04,191
He's getting revenge
against the system

207
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:06,272
- that put him to death.
- And you know who's next, right?

208
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:08,273
Yeah, Franzen.
He's the Prosecutor.

209
00:11:13,217 --> 00:11:15,432
Has that been there
the whole time?

210
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:25,412
- All right. Taser.
- Nice.

211
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:27,852
Finally. Somethin' that
can do some real damage.

212
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:30,363
All right, we got franzen's
address in the case file.

213
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:33,112
I say we stake out his house
tonight and taser a soul.

214
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:35,022
Uh, no, no, no. No can do, Sam.

215
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:36,773
What? Why?

216
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:38,240
- "Wh-what?"
- Yeah?

217
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:40,112
Well, because, Sam.

218
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:44,772
because--because Ben and I have lives,
all right?

219
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:46,700
We have things that
need to get done

220
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:48,660
that don't necessarily
include following souls

221
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:50,830
around town with you. Ok?

222
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:53,113
Can you wrap your little
head around that?

223
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:55,483
- So you're goin' to Gladys' house.
- That's exactly it.

224
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:56,903
You have your mission, Sam.

225
00:11:57,268 --> 00:12:00,750
- Maybe this is my mission.
- Your mission is to stalk a demon?

226
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:03,903
Perhaps. Perhaps it is.

227
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,713
Ok. Well, we'll talk later.

228
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:17,223
- Hey, Andi.
- Hey.

229
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:19,280
- And Greg.
- What's up, Sam?

230
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:23,502
- What happened to your hair?
- Uh, nothing.

231
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:25,501
Oh. So that's on purpose.

232
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,671
Ok, I'm gonna get back to work,
so I guess--

233
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,303
- Yeah. See ya. Yeah.
- Heh. Ok.

234
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,473
- Bye.
- Bye.

235
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,282
Sam, come here.

236
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:36,733
I need your help.

237
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:39,670
I'm planning this huge
surprise party for Andi

238
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:41,513
at this club a
buddy of mine owns.

239
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:42,713
What I need you to do

240
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:44,780
is pretend your movie
thing is still on,

241
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:46,721
but then bring her
to the club instead.

242
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:48,203
You down?

243
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:51,141
Um, Greg, I'm pretty sure she
doesn't want a huge party.

244
00:12:51,365 --> 00:12:53,113
Yeah, but this is
gonna be awesome.

245
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:55,701
Yeah, but she said she just
wanted things to be low-key.

246
00:12:55,737 --> 00:12:57,173
Look, I just need to know
if you're gonna be cool

247
00:12:57,207 --> 00:13:01,033
- and help me. Are you?
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm--I'm cool.

248
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:02,612
- Great.
- Great.

249
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:04,322
- Thanks, buddy.
- No problem.

250
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:05,983
Buddy.

251
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:19,321
You know, Gladys' house is
pretty normal, actually.

252
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:21,412
I was thinkin' the
exact same thing.

253
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:28,012
- Give me your cup.
- That's hot chocolate?

254
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:31,182
- Key lime martini.
- Mmm. Classy.

255
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,871
All the way, baby.

256
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:36,762
Hello.

257
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:38,722
Hey, Sammy boy.
How we doin' over there?

258
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:41,332
Yeah, I'm at the District
Attorney's house, but it's quiet.

259
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:43,013
I don't think the soul's
comin' after him.

260
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:45,401
Ok. Well, whatever.
Did you miss me?

261
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:47,603
More than you'll ever
know, sweetheart.

262
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:49,670
Oh, gotta go. Gotta go.

263
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:51,690
What? What are they doin'?

264
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:58,123
- You're a witch!
- You see the arm on that guy?

265
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:00,851
- Nice ***, buddy.
- You're a monster!

266
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,802
- Get off my lawn!
- Ohh. Oh, get down. Ohh.

267
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:07,753
Yeah, you better run,
or I'll cook your brains in stew!

268
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:10,113
It's the witch! Monster!

269
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:16,891
Did you hear that?

270
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:19,990
She cooks kids.

271
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:24,020
- We have got to get in that house.
- Y-yeah. Pronto.

272
00:15:02,476 --> 00:15:03,790
Who's there?

273
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,172
Got ya.

274
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:22,083
Oh--oh, no.

275
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:29,551
Uh, listen, I am--
I am so, so sorry.

276
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:31,663
I--I would never,
definitely ne--

277
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:33,583
I had no idea who
you were, sir.

278
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:36,261
Uh... where'd you get this?

279
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:40,950
That was, uh,
a gift f-from a friend.

280
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:43,530
Well, Mr.
Oliver, I'm gonna have to take you in.

281
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:45,673
C-can't you just let me
off with a warning or--

282
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,600
- You assaulted a law enforcement official.
- By accident.

283
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:50,370
Turn around.
Put your hands behind your back.

284
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,710
O-ok, ok.

285
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:55,352
- You're not gonna--
- All right.

286
00:15:57,425 --> 00:15:59,422
Thap's a nice watch.
Where'd you get it?

287
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:02,740
Uh, it was also a
gift from a friend.

288
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,803
Take it off. I wanna see it.

289
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:06,650
Yeah, yeah. You--
you know what?

290
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:08,133
You can have it I-if you want

291
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,891
just as a token of my
appreciation or whatever.

292
00:16:11,258 --> 00:16:13,003
It's... yours.

293
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:15,783
It's a great watch.

294
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:20,793
Don't let me catch you in
this neighborhood ever again.

295
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:23,080
- Ever. Ever.
- Never again. You won't.

296
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:30,393
So he'd get all foamy at the mouth
and twitchy when you zapped him?

297
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:32,293
- Not really.
- Too bad. You probably did it wrong.

298
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:33,471
He's got the vessel, though.

299
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:35,571
I gotta figure out a way to get it back.
What should I do?

300
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,563
Should drink beer.
It'll help you think.

301
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,833
Wait. What did you say?

302
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:40,640
- Nothing.
- Tell me.

303
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:43,152
- I didn't say anything--
- Hey.

304
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:45,303
Is Greg throwing me
a surprise party?

305
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:49,533
No, not that I know of.

306
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:51,130
- Sam...
- Yeah?

307
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:52,502
You know me.

308
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:55,032
- You know I don't want this party.
- I know that.

309
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,853
And as my friend,
you are obligated to be honest

310
00:16:56,886 --> 00:16:59,280
and answer this question,
so I'm gonna ask you one more time.

311
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,603
Is Greg throwing me
a surprise party?

312
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:07,362
- Oh, my god. Sock is on fire.
- Weak.

313
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:09,422
Man, I can't believe that.

314
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:11,512
I told Greg I wanted
it to be simple.

315
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:13,803
He's your boyfriend.
He wants it to be special.

316
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:16,071
Ok, yes,
we've been on a few dates,

317
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,800
but he hardly qualifies
as my boyfriend yet.

318
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:21,953
- Well, nobody told Greg.
- Well, he doesn't even know me.

319
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:24,090
He doesn't even try to know me.

320
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:26,903
You want somebody who
pays attention to things.

321
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:29,761
Yes, and understands me. Tries.

322
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:31,930
Knows what you like and
what you don't like.

323
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,221
- Exactly.
- Like Sam.

324
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:36,221
No. I mean, you know what?
No. No,

325
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:38,371
because me and Sam are friends,
Jo, and I've done that before.

326
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,200
I've dated somebody
who I was friends with,

327
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:43,283
and then we broke up,
and we never spoke again. It sucks.

328
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:44,500
But if Sam and I
weren't friends,

329
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:46,162
I really don't know
what I would do.

330
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:47,550
You don't know that
that would happen.

331
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:49,303
Right. I don't know that.

332
00:17:49,388 --> 00:17:51,492
But I know that you and
Sock used to be friends.

333
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:52,932
Are you now?

334
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,461
No, we're not.

335
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:57,731
Well, there you go.

336
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:07,501
Ok, she's at work.
DMV closes at 5:00,

337
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,342
so we have until then to
commit yet another felony.

338
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,340
- Kind of gets you pumped, right?
- Yes, it does.

339
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:13,833
Let's do a little biz-nas.

340
00:18:19,295 --> 00:18:21,333
- Man. Come on.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

341
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:27,753
Did not expect this.

342
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,482
Jeez.

343
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:35,433
You think all demons
decorate like this?

344
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:36,812
Check this out.

345
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:39,532
Why would a demon be
into angel figurines?

346
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:41,653
It's like a cat bangin' a dog.

347
00:18:42,627 --> 00:18:43,963
Oh, Ben!

348
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:46,193
That's not funny.

349
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,663
It's flowers.

350
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,443
No. No, no, no, no.
There's gotta be somethin' else.

351
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:15,421
- I'm--
- Soc--

352
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:17,500
No, Gladys is a freaky hell demon,
all right?

353
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:19,133
There's gotta be
somethin' else,

354
00:19:19,278 --> 00:19:21,621
like a--like body parts
buried below or some...

355
00:19:21,898 --> 00:19:23,832
- I'm tellin' you.
- Get out of here!

356
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,660
Go! Come on! Come on!

357
00:19:35,127 --> 00:19:36,903
- Get out of here!
- Come on!

358
00:19:36,997 --> 00:19:38,563
Oh, god.

359
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,421
Benji, get the keys!

360
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:42,140
Get the keys! Get the keys!

361
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:43,513
Ohh! Ok! I can't--

362
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:47,303
- Open the car. Open the car, Ben!
- Hey, I can't think under pressure.

363
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:48,920
Get out of my way!

364
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:52,500
Ok, it's open.

365
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:55,021
Oh, my god.

366
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:58,330
You come out of there,
you rotten little pukes!

367
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,193
- Get away from us, you monster!
- I am not a monster!

368
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,762
This is my mom's car!

369
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:10,433
Come on! Get out! Cowards!

370
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:23,320
It was the--it was them.

371
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:25,222
They were in my house.

372
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:56,302
Where the hell have you been?

373
00:20:56,826 --> 00:21:00,093
Oh. You missed me. I'm touched.

374
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,521
- Yeah, I almost got arrested.
- I know.

375
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:05,150
Cop took the vessel.
A-and the watch.

376
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,870
- What is that about?
- Well, I imagine he recognized it.

377
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:08,913
What do you mean?

378
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:11,993
Well, it used to belong to Curtis
Dean Mays' Defense Attorney.

379
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:14,143
The Defense Attorney
who Mays just killed?

380
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:19,881
You gave me a dead guy's watch?

381
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:22,951
No, specifically I gave you
a dead murder victim's watch,

382
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:24,772
and I imagine the good
detective is checking it out

383
00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:26,560
right now as we speak.

384
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:29,183
He's gonna think
I killed that guy.

385
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:32,481
Probably. Then when he checks the
courthouse surveillance video,

386
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:34,720
he's gonna see you were there
when Judge Collins was murdered.

387
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:36,821
Well, I guess you see
where this is goin'.

388
00:21:36,857 --> 00:21:39,390
Oh, my g--I-I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go to prison!

389
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:42,611
- Yeah. That's messed up.
- What--I can't believe this.

390
00:21:42,877 --> 00:21:44,351
- I can't--
- You know, you're frustrated.

391
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,663
You need an outlet.

392
00:21:45,898 --> 00:21:48,130
- Hit me.
- What?

393
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:49,640
Come on.

394
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:51,512
Go all barry bonds on my ass.

395
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:53,452
- It'll make you feel better.
- Shut up!

396
00:21:53,485 --> 00:21:55,121
Opportunity of a lifetime, pal.

397
00:21:55,395 --> 00:21:58,151
It's going. 5, 4, 3--

398
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:01,883
It's all you got? Come on!

399
00:22:13,716 --> 00:22:17,653
- Feel better?
- I hate you so much.

400
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:19,470
Well, you know I gotta say

401
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:22,181
it was very classy of you
not to go for the crotch.

402
00:22:32,128 --> 00:22:34,420
- Ted, what happened?
- Well, my little felon,

403
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,930
the police stopped by,

404
00:22:36,258 --> 00:22:38,001
and they were asking
questions about you.

405
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:39,562
They wanted to
search your locker,

406
00:22:39,596 --> 00:22:41,612
and of course I gave
them full access.

407
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:43,442
Um, Ted,
you have the combination.

408
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:46,822
- Why didn't you just open it for them?
- Do not question my methods, Sam.

409
00:22:46,858 --> 00:22:50,003
A Detective Stafford would like
you to come in for questioning.

410
00:22:50,028 --> 00:22:51,551
You take off the apron.

411
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:53,731
I will not have you
doin' a perp walk

412
00:22:53,768 --> 00:22:55,281
wh1ile wearin' the blue.

413
00:22:58,447 --> 00:22:59,993
Fix that when it's done.

414
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:15,402
- What's this?
- A book.

415
00:23:15,617 --> 00:23:17,523
Um, Sock,
reading gives you migraines.

416
00:23:17,755 --> 00:23:19,072
I know, I know, but I could not

417
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:21,121
get those angel
figurines out of my head.

418
00:23:21,155 --> 00:23:23,171
I had to figure out why
Gladys was so into them.

419
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:24,502
Check this out.

420
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:27,770
Did you know that Satan used
to be an angel named Lucifer?

421
00:23:28,227 --> 00:23:31,850
Yeah. One day, he rounded up all
these badass rebel angels, right,

422
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:33,453
and declared a war on god.

423
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:35,372
Yeah, I remember this
in Sunday school.

424
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:37,243
Every demon used
to be an angel.

425
00:23:37,307 --> 00:23:38,753
Ok, you're Gladys, all right?

426
00:23:38,957 --> 00:23:40,960
You're an angel.
You're just chillin' up in heaven.

427
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:42,851
One day,
you decide to back the wrong dude,

428
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:45,083
and, boom,
you spend the rest of eternity in hell.

429
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:47,910
- But, Sock, she's pure evil.
- How do we know that?

430
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:49,443
How do we know that?!

431
00:23:49,706 --> 00:23:51,852
I think that you would
be pretty pissed off

432
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:54,353
if you had a bunch apof crappy
little kids teasin' you all day.

433
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:55,560
Ok?

434
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,993
Listen--all right.

435
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:02,552
I'm gonna tell
you something, ok?

436
00:24:02,986 --> 00:24:04,582
In the second grade...

437
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:08,630
I was this height.

438
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:14,402
7 years old, 6 feet tall.

439
00:24:15,127 --> 00:24:17,943
All the kids decided
to call me...

440
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:22,663
Growth Spurt Bert
or Bert the Spurt,

441
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,323
Beanstalk Bert, Bert the Beansock,
Sock the Beanstalk.

442
00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:28,321
Are you--you following
my drift here?

443
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:30,852
Then my mom,
my mom decided that was funny,

444
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:32,870
and then eventually
my whole family

445
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:35,083
at the dinner table
started calling me...

446
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:42,150
- Names hurt, Ben, a lot.
- Hey, listen to me.

447
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,541
I think you grew into
your body really nicely.

448
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,473
Thank you.

449
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:49,883
Guys, I need your help.

450
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,372
All right,
we gotta go to my house

451
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:53,131
so I can pick up one
of my sport coats.

452
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:55,271
- Uh, you don't own a sport coat.
- We gotta go to your dad's house

453
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:56,671
so I can pick up one
of his sport coats.

454
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:58,282
Don't you worry, all right?

455
00:24:58,306 --> 00:25:01,123
I've talked myself out of many,
many drunk-and-disorderlies.

456
00:25:01,156 --> 00:25:02,630
- Not a problem.
- Sam!

457
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:08,693
- Hang on.
- For Greg?

458
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:14,130
Hey. Get in.

459
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:18,592
What's up?

460
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:20,622
You told Andi about
the surprise party?

461
00:25:21,648 --> 00:25:24,891
Uh, she kind of guessed, Greg.
I-I'm sorry.

462
00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:28,513
Ok, new plan.

463
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:31,693
We do nothing for her birthday,
totally blow it off,

464
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:34,450
but then I'll do the surprise
party the day after.

465
00:25:34,587 --> 00:25:37,433
That's completely stupid.
So she's alone on her birthday?

466
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:39,113
Let's just do what
she wants to do--

467
00:25:39,148 --> 00:25:41,053
go to a movie, get a beer.
She'll like that.

468
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:44,130
- You just call me stupid?
- No. No. No!

469
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:46,883
I called your idea stupid.
I'm trying to help you, ok?

470
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:48,782
- Did I ask for your help?
- Yes!

471
00:25:49,486 --> 00:25:51,312
I know what you're doin'.

472
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:53,962
You're tryin' to make me
look bad in front of Andi.

473
00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:56,190
No, Greg.
You're doin' that all on your own.

474
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:59,001
- Get out of my car.
- What the hell, man?

475
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,990
- Don't push me.
- What are you--

476
00:26:09,377 --> 00:26:11,223
What, are they making out?

477
00:26:12,726 --> 00:26:14,290
Oh. Oh, boy.

478
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:16,110
No, no. Hey.

479
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:18,870
All right, break it up, ladies.
Break it up. Come on.

480
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:22,492
All right, break it up, ladies.
Come on. Come on.

481
00:26:23,306 --> 00:26:25,282
Aw, I'm bleeding.

482
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:28,832
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

483
00:26:29,085 --> 00:26:31,421
No, I'm great! I just punched
Andi's boyfriend in the face.

484
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:32,771
I'm perfect.

485
00:26:34,347 --> 00:26:36,171
Let's go get arrested.

486
00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:44,030
Who's this?

487
00:26:44,675 --> 00:26:46,481
Uh, th-this is my--

488
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:50,663
All questions for my client should
be directed at myself, detective.

489
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,593
Have a seat.

490
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:05,013
I'm gonna give you 10
seconds to get out of here

491
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:07,150
before I beat your face
with a phone book.

492
00:27:27,465 --> 00:27:29,771
I'm gonna make this real simple,
Mr. Oliver.

493
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:33,682
You were found in
possession of a watch

494
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,562
that belonged to
a murder victim,

495
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:39,240
you trespassed on the property of
the Prosecutor in the Mays case,

496
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:43,100
and you were in the courthouse
when Judge Collins was murdered.

497
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:47,951
Are you bleeding?

498
00:27:49,497 --> 00:27:51,722
Uh, no. That's not my blood.

499
00:27:55,888 --> 00:27:57,341
I didn't do it.

500
00:27:58,297 --> 00:27:59,992
I--I didn't do it, all right?!

501
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:03,030
I swear I didn't do it, ok?!
Come on!

502
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:05,303
All right? Come on! You--

503
00:28:05,395 --> 00:28:06,993
All right,
you can come out now!

504
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:09,793
Ok?! Joke's over!
It's really funny!

505
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:11,911
Hey, hey, take it easy.
Take it easy!

506
00:28:11,948 --> 00:28:14,690
You gotta--let me out!
All right?! Just come on! Just--

507
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,563
Who are you talkin' to?

508
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,332
You wanna know who I'm
talkin' to, detective?

509
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:20,812
I'm talkin' to the devil,
all right?

510
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:22,543
Yeah. Yeah.
You might think I'm crazy,

511
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:23,820
which, you know, maybe I am.

512
00:28:23,856 --> 00:28:25,172
Is that what you're
tryin' to do,

513
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,951
make him think that
I'm nuts, huh?!

514
00:28:26,978 --> 00:28:28,770
Well, I'm not nuts,
ok?! I-I'm--ohh!

515
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,421
- How'd you get my address?
- What?

516
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,901
This! This! 613 Cardinal Drive.
It's my address.

517
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:37,073
- How'd you get it?
- There's a 3 now?

518
00:28:37,107 --> 00:28:38,212
- Answer me!
- I don't know.

519
00:28:38,247 --> 00:28:39,483
These things just pop up, ok?

520
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:40,880
I-it's supposed
to give me a clue

521
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:43,683
to who the killer is, all right?
That's wh--

522
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:48,461
Maybe that's where he's going to next.
All right?

523
00:29:14,155 --> 00:29:18,130
- That gun is not gonna work.
- Is that so?

524
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:21,390
I need my taser back.
It's the only thing that'll stop him.

525
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:23,570
- Stop who?
- Mays.

526
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:27,251
No, Mays is dead.

527
00:29:27,596 --> 00:29:30,451
I arrested the son of a bitch
myself and witnessed his execution.

528
00:29:30,486 --> 00:29:31,760
Yeah, well, he's back,

529
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:34,461
and he's killing people who put
him away. That includes you.

530
00:29:34,495 --> 00:29:36,693
And bullets aren't gonna
do anything to him.

531
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,981
Bullets work on you?

532
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:41,851
Uh, yeah,
yeah. They--they--completely.

533
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:43,950
- They totally work on me.
- Good.

534
00:29:44,906 --> 00:29:46,770
Well, we'll see
if you're right.

535
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:48,663
Wait. Wh-what are you gonna do?

536
00:29:48,947 --> 00:29:52,051
Wait. Mays shows up,
you're in the clear.

537
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:53,841
You want a scotch?

538
00:30:22,345 --> 00:30:25,833
Hi. Hi. Hello. It's me, Sock.

539
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:27,641
I just wanted to say that I'm--

540
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:32,810
I'm sorry that I
called you a monster.

541
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:36,343
Yeah. A-and I'm sorry I didn't

542
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:38,603
consider your feelings

543
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:43,113
before I opened my big,
stupid mouth.

544
00:30:50,977 --> 00:30:54,223
You know, I--I really--
I really hate

545
00:30:54,307 --> 00:30:56,951
the way the neighborhood
kids tease you all the time.

546
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,212
Well, it's my fault, too.

547
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:02,013
Sometimes I rub
people the wrong way.

548
00:31:03,457 --> 00:31:04,972
Oh. Thank you.

549
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:08,440
I bet you, um...

550
00:31:08,745 --> 00:31:12,523
dread when my boys and I come
struttin' into your DMV, huh?

551
00:31:12,857 --> 00:31:14,981
Well, I have to say, um...

552
00:31:15,718 --> 00:31:19,271
Actually it's kind of
the high point of my day.

553
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,513
- Get out.
- It is.

554
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:23,232
I knew it. I-- you know what?

555
00:31:23,455 --> 00:31:25,351
I did.
In some weird way, I knew that.

556
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:27,063
I like it when you mess around.

557
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:29,043
Kind of feels like
you're flirting with me.

558
00:31:29,077 --> 00:31:31,480
Well, that's just my natural Sock aura,
know what I mean?

559
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:33,083
Chicks respond to it.

560
00:31:33,297 --> 00:31:34,891
Would you like
some more coffee?

561
00:31:35,128 --> 00:31:37,072
Mmm, no. Actually, I'm good.
Thank you.

562
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:44,431
You have a pretty mouth.

563
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:47,871
This thing?

564
00:31:48,947 --> 00:31:50,613
I'd like to kiss it.

565
00:31:53,735 --> 00:31:55,213
I'd like that, too.

566
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,770
Oh, boy. Here we go.

567
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,560
- Watch your horns.
- Ok.

568
00:32:31,735 --> 00:32:35,592
Wow. You're famous.

569
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:37,530
That was back in my heyday,

570
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:41,273
a long time ago.
They forget about you pretty fast.

571
00:32:41,975 --> 00:32:43,443
What happened?

572
00:32:44,555 --> 00:32:46,182
The collars stopped coming.

573
00:32:48,406 --> 00:32:50,170
I'm hoping to change
that tonight.

574
00:32:51,628 --> 00:32:54,990
Unless of course it's
the ghost of Mays.

575
00:32:55,965 --> 00:32:57,863
Then I guess I'm
just out of luck.

576
00:32:58,216 --> 00:33:00,560
I know you don't believe me,
but I'm not crazy.

577
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:04,770
Things I've seen over the years,
I guess anything's possible.

578
00:33:04,836 --> 00:33:06,683
Listen, if you try
to shoot this guy,

579
00:33:06,938 --> 00:33:09,470
you're gonna get killed,
and then I'm gonna get killed.

580
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:11,983
I need that taser.
It's the only way.

581
00:33:17,175 --> 00:33:18,511
It's in my car.

582
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:21,650
Come on.

583
00:33:22,115 --> 00:33:24,562
Really, when Mays comes,
you're gonna want that taser.

584
00:33:24,598 --> 00:33:25,790
Whatever you say.

585
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:27,063
I'll get it out,

586
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:29,182
but I'm holding on to it.
You understand?

587
00:33:31,955 --> 00:33:34,553
Oh, that's right.
I put your taser in the glove box.

588
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:49,900
Mays?

589
00:33:50,316 --> 00:33:51,711
Hey, detective.

590
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,370
Miss me?

591
00:34:04,746 --> 00:34:05,932
Look out!

592
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,171
Mays...

593
00:34:20,055 --> 00:34:21,490
Yeah, Stafford.

594
00:34:21,835 --> 00:34:23,390
We're gonna have some fun.

595
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:26,533
No.

596
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:08,061
All right, listen.

597
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,331
I'm gonna call an ambulance for you,
but then I gotta go,

598
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:11,781
because I think it's
better if I just

599
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:13,700
stay out of this, all right?

600
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:19,152
Hang up the phone.

601
00:35:26,898 --> 00:35:30,470
All right. All right, there.
There. What? Wh--

602
00:35:30,876 --> 00:35:32,880
You seem like a
nice kid, but...

603
00:35:34,837 --> 00:35:36,301
I need this collar.

604
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:41,100
See, one more,
and I can retire a hero.

605
00:35:41,568 --> 00:35:43,913
Wh--you got him.
You--you caught the guy.

606
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,162
No! I need this collar.

607
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:49,991
And I can't tell them

608
00:35:50,386 --> 00:35:53,222
that the killer's an
escaped soul from hell,

609
00:35:53,597 --> 00:35:57,101
- so it's gotta be you.
- Come on.

610
00:35:57,378 --> 00:35:58,952
I know the devil sent you.

611
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:03,433
- What did you say?
- I'm so sorry.

612
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:15,850
What the hell?

613
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:18,791
No.

614
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:20,101
No!

615
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:21,642
No!

616
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:30,123
Boy, talk about
good timing, right?

617
00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:35,313
Oh, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, D-Dan.

618
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:38,221
Such a disappointment.
And the rug is a real Persian.

619
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,570
What the hell... just happened?

620
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,450
Well, tomorrow the
papers will say

621
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:45,141
Detective Stafford ate his gun

622
00:36:45,665 --> 00:36:48,601
due to his overwhelming
guilt over being

623
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:51,942
the Curtis Dean Mays
copycat killer.

624
00:36:53,877 --> 00:36:55,111
So ironic.

625
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:58,031
And then of course they'll find

626
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:00,421
this little bit of evidence

627
00:37:00,907 --> 00:37:03,203
and of course his written
confession upstairs.

628
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:04,731
Wrote that myself.

629
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:07,341
What do you think?
Quoting Hamlet too cliched?

630
00:37:08,345 --> 00:37:10,863
Nah. He'd totally do that.

631
00:37:14,138 --> 00:37:16,681
W-w-wait. Why? Why?!

632
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:19,010
My toy, Sam.

633
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:21,433
I'm allowed to break it.

634
00:37:22,395 --> 00:37:23,712
He was mine.

635
00:37:23,986 --> 00:37:26,233
He came to me 20 years
ago and sold his soul.

636
00:37:26,956 --> 00:37:28,791
He wanted to be super cop,

637
00:37:29,405 --> 00:37:33,843
so I promised him 5 high-profile,
very important cases

638
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,683
in exchange for his soul,

639
00:37:35,997 --> 00:37:37,940
and this was the fifth case.

640
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:40,901
- What was?
- Stafford.

641
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:42,940
He just caught himself.

642
00:37:44,856 --> 00:37:46,850
It's kind of sneaky, I admit.

643
00:37:47,537 --> 00:37:49,470
But I've fulfilled my
end of the contract,

644
00:37:49,505 --> 00:37:52,111
and now he has fulfilled his.

645
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:55,480
You know what I could go for?

646
00:37:55,588 --> 00:37:59,022
Bloomin' onion. You in?

647
00:38:11,947 --> 00:38:13,632
You know I can see you.

648
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:16,303
What are you doing?

649
00:38:17,326 --> 00:38:20,630
I--uh, I--

650
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:24,050
Listen, Andi,
I need to apologize for the whole

651
00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:26,390
bloody-nose Greg thing.

652
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:29,121
- I--I was a total jerk. I had--
-- We broke up.

653
00:38:30,957 --> 00:38:33,181
- What?
- Yep.

654
00:38:33,505 --> 00:38:34,691
- Why?
- 'Cause

655
00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:37,341
I realized we weren't
right for each other.

656
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:41,202
And you punched
Greg in the nose?

657
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:43,251
It was--

658
00:38:43,508 --> 00:38:45,660
we kind of got into
a fight in his car,

659
00:38:45,696 --> 00:38:47,273
more like a...

660
00:38:47,555 --> 00:38:49,270
slap fight. It...

661
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,363
Ok.

662
00:38:52,586 --> 00:38:54,801
I'm--I'm really, really sorry.

663
00:38:55,178 --> 00:38:57,931
That's fine. I'm ok, actually.

664
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:01,613
God, what a weird
birthday, though.

665
00:39:02,077 --> 00:39:03,633
You know,
I probably should have waited for Greg

666
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:05,700
to give me my
present first, huh?

667
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,593
Happy birthday.

668
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:13,501
Sam.

669
00:39:13,895 --> 00:39:15,343
It's ok if you don't like it.

670
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:17,863
I just--I really wanted to
get it for you, and I--

671
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:20,210
Hopefully you'll like it.

672
00:39:22,538 --> 00:39:25,692
It's really beautiful.

673
00:39:26,256 --> 00:39:27,371
You like it.

674
00:39:27,778 --> 00:39:29,412
Great. Perfect.

675
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:40,820
I can't accept this.

676
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:44,071
Wh-what?

677
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:46,732
Wh-why?

678
00:39:47,038 --> 00:39:48,942
I just--I--I can't, because

679
00:39:50,086 --> 00:39:53,381
we're friends, and that's not
something that a friend wears.

680
00:39:54,187 --> 00:39:55,460
Well, then...

681
00:39:56,245 --> 00:39:57,961
don't wear it as a friend.

682
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:03,960
You're like the most
important person in my life.

683
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:10,201
God, I'm sorry.

684
00:40:20,656 --> 00:40:22,373
You guys called it.
You were totally right.

685
00:40:22,406 --> 00:40:24,323
I should've never given
her that necklace.

686
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,101
- I hate seeing you like this.
- I hate being right all the time,

687
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,861
- but I am.
- Thanks, Sock.

688
00:40:32,518 --> 00:40:34,812
Place the vessel on the mat.

689
00:40:36,808 --> 00:40:39,873
- Hi, Sock.
- Hmm? Hi. Yep.

690
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:43,011
Had any good dreams lately?

691
00:40:46,097 --> 00:40:47,683
You did that?

692
00:40:50,275 --> 00:40:53,792
- On purpose.
- Was it good for you?

693
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:58,501
- Now, what's goin' on?
- Take me home, Sam.

694
00:40:58,907 --> 00:41:02,271
- I-I'll take care of it.
- Hey, hold on.

695
00:41:22,537 --> 00:41:25,251
What if it's a
replacement watch?

696
00:41:25,356 --> 00:41:27,481
Doesn't matter.
There's no way I'm opening this.

697
00:41:27,516 --> 00:41:29,420
Accepting gifts from
the devil is suicide.

698
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,353
Yeah, but what if it's
something really cool?

699
00:41:31,385 --> 00:41:33,320
I don't care if it's a
box full of world peace.

700
00:41:33,355 --> 00:41:35,070
It's still gonna come back
and bite me in the ass.

701
00:41:35,108 --> 00:41:36,912
- I'm bored. Let's open it.
- Sock, wait! No! Just--

702
00:41:36,946 --> 00:41:38,412
- Sam!
- Just give it--

703
00:41:44,757 --> 00:41:46,742
A "get out of hell free" card?

704
00:41:47,436 --> 00:41:50,972
- Whoa. You think it's real?
- Of course not.

705
00:41:51,216 --> 00:41:53,170
It's from the devil.
It's gotta be a trick.

706
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:55,111
- Right. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

707
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,762
I'm breakin'. I'm breakin'.

708
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:06,060
