1
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:50,209
That is ridiculous.
I cannot get behind that.

2
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:51,667
Come on, Ben! Help me out here.

3
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:53,565
I'm sorry, man,
i'm with Sock on this one.

4
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,473
I don't care. I'm right on this. It's
not gay to bang a clone of yourself.

5
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:58,771
It is absolutely gay to bang a clone.

6
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,470
I thought we'd celebrate.

7
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,487
Right, Nina, yeah! A little pizza,
a little bubbly, a little...

8
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:07,402
Suitcase.

9
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,943
- What are we celebrating?
- Ben didn't tell you?

10
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:11,921
I was just about to.

11
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:15,013
- Tell us what?
- I'm moving in with you guys!

12
00:01:17,068 --> 00:01:19,420
Yeah, that'll be the day.

13
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:21,833
Wait, Sock, what's the problem?

14
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:23,926
I don't like it Ben.
I don't like it one little bit.

15
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:26,735
Having a lady in the house
opens the window to lady trouble.

16
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,882
Next thing you know,
we'll all be on the same cycle!

17
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:30,421
Sam, what do you think?

18
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,380
You know, to be honest, Ben,
I don't think it's such a good idea.

19
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:37,054
Are you uncomfortable because
of that time that I kissed you?

20
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,961
- What?!
- What?!

21
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:40,389
You kissed Nina?

22
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:43,106
Damn, man.

23
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,265
- That was for you, Benji.
- Thank you!

24
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:49,650
Baby, it wasn't his fault.
Actually, it was me. I kissed him.

25
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:52,943
It was a long time ago,
and I thought that there was something

26
00:01:53,008 --> 00:01:55,692
evil about him that I was
extremely attracted to.

27
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:59,217
But now,
I realize that he isn't remotely wicked.

28
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:01,105
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:05,128
I mean, look at him.
He's so white bread.

30
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,206
He's just bland, and he's...
Yes, he's blah.

31
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:11,483
- Exactly.
- I am not blah.

32
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:17,103
Baby, listen to me.
I've been doing a ton of work on myself,

33
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:21,149
and I am proud to say now
that I can control my urges.

34
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:24,847
I'm only just a little
bit attracted to evil now.

35
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:30,177
- OK, I believe you. Let's move past it.
- Really?

36
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:33,619
It's been a while, but I get it.

37
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:36,928
You're a demon, and certain
things are just in your nature.

38
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:39,675
You like to eat live animals,
make out with my friends,

39
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:41,701
and you hate wearing synthetic fabrics.

40
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,269
I like clothes that breathe.

41
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:45,782
OK, now that this is out,

42
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,050
are we good?
I mean, can Nina stay?

43
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:52,462
- Yeah, sure, why not?
- All right! Socky!

44
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:55,286
Fine, whatever.
Pop the bubbly, let it flow.

45
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,046
Zhite bread?

46
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:05,771
Definitely not white bread!
Total bad-ass!

47
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,996
Sam, this is all your fault! I had
everything and you stole it for me!

48
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:18,999
I never wanted it!

49
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,196
This all you deserve!

50
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:33,227
Who am I kidding? Man, I can't kill you.
I can't kill anybody.

51
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:35,145
I just never had the instinct.

52
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:37,923
It's all gone, Sam.

53
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:41,416
The cars, the clothes.

54
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:44,407
Last night I had to go on
a date with an actress, Sam.

55
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,492
An actress!

56
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:48,290
I can't even date models anymore!

57
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,553
That's rough.

58
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,589
God!

59
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:56,418
- You OK?
- I just tweaked my ankle a little bit.

60
00:03:57,128 --> 00:03:59,488
I'm sorry, man.
I should have never come here.

61
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:01,151
None of this was even your fault.

62
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:04,926
So what now?
Where are you gonna go?

63
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,787
I mean...

64
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:09,329
You have somewhere to stay
a friend's place, right?

65
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:11,334
Funny thing is about my friends, Sam,

66
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:13,752
once my money disappeared,
they did, too.

67
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:17,571
You wanna crash here?

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,135
Don't you yank my chain right now,
Sam, I am fragile.

69
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:22,111
Just until you get back on your feet.

70
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:26,200
Thanks, man.

71
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:29,790
- All right. Can I get some help?
- Yeah, yeah, sure, man.

72
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:31,998
Morgan! I just...

73
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:35,806
- I just needed a hand!
- It's OK, man. You're light.

74
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:37,616
Like a kitten!

75
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,264
Man, this is gonna be so great!

79
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,360
So it's me and the countess
on her plane, and by this point,

80
00:04:52,423 --> 00:04:56,236
- she's just wearing her Tiara.
- Filthy royals, I love it!

81
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,628
Yeah, then she says to me,

82
00:04:57,688 --> 00:05:00,070
"haven't you ever been
on a private plane before?"

83
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:04,481
- What did you say?
- I said, "no, countess, I never have."

84
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:06,389
But you had been on one before, right?

85
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:10,140
Yeah, I had.
The week before. With her mom.

86
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,840
Morgan, you're so bad.

87
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,007
Dude, you can stay here
as long as you want, man.

88
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,894
With you around, I'm bound
to catch a little lady shrapnel.

89
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:21,847
I don't know, Sock.
Those days seemed to be long gone.

90
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:23,813
No, you have plenty of

91
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:27,197
callous,
sociopath tendencies left in you.

92
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:29,689
I can see these things. I'm a demon.

93
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,072
Seriously?
A full-blown demon?

94
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:36,085
Would you like more cereal?

95
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:37,380
Please.

96
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,499
Damn, Ben,
I had no idea you were a pervert.

97
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,130
I mean, I can't say I
blame you for going there.

98
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,140
I'd like to propose a dress
code for the breakfast table.

99
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,974
T- shirts should accompany boxers.

100
00:05:50,147 --> 00:05:53,495
Boxers should not be worn,
unless under pants,

101
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:56,989
regular, loose-fitting pants.
Shall we vote?

102
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:06,500
Cart boy?

103
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,729
- Nice ride!
- Yeah, back at you.

104
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:13,590
What's with your leg?

105
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,366
I was just messing around with the guys.

106
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:19,898
Good old-fashioned game of grab ass?
I remember those days.

107
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:22,483
Lucky for you, I only have a little
light duty for you.

108
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:26,059
Here you go. I want you to deliver
this puppy for me. OK, go on, get in.

109
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:29,829
All right.

110
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:33,345
Yeah, baby!

111
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,465
Now it's to go to Mr. Gary Martin.
All the info's on the waybill.

112
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,264
Who is this guy?

113
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:42,050
Just another weak schmoe
who sold me his soul.

114
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:44,280
Yeah, the car's part of the bargain.

115
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:47,022
Now don't forget to get his signature
before you give him the car.

116
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:49,207
Right, right.
This car have.

117
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:52,541
Seat warmers?

118
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:57,701
Samuel, do you realize that we are
holding the keys to a piece of art?

119
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:00,475
And art, my friend,
is meant to be shown,

120
00:07:00,948 --> 00:07:02,477
driven and made out in.

121
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:06,212
Just the man I was looking for.

122
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:09,482
Baby Stevie!
She's getting so big!

123
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,440
Guys, I have a bunch of returns

124
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,180
and I can't find the receipts.
Could you, hook a demon brother up?

125
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:19,191
- Yeah, what do we got?
- Baby proofing supplies.

126
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,644
You aren't wearing any product
in your hair! Are you OK?

127
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:27,623
Yeah, I'm fine. I just haven't
been out of the house in days.

128
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:30,465
You know...
I've been so busy, and

129
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:33,810
this little lady's been
just wearing me down.

130
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:36,985
You know, why don't you get a sitter?
Let's take you out.

131
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:39,740
I don't know. I haven't done that yet.

132
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,701
No, you need some full on grown-up time.

133
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,748
Yeah, we will not take no
for an answer, young man.

134
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:45,950
You know what...
OK, fine.

135
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:47,735
Fine, but I am buying the first round.

136
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,500
Yes. Probably the second
and the third, too.

137
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,100
All right, hey, thanks, guys.

138
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,193
- For everything.
- You got it.

139
00:07:55,253 --> 00:07:56,260
Say bye-bye.

140
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:59,863
- Bye, cutie!
- Excuse me, everyone.

141
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:02,753
- I have an announcement to make.
- This should be stunning.

142
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:05,940
Just, Scoot in.
Customers are allowed.

143
00:08:06,734 --> 00:08:09,781
something special, nay, transcendent

144
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:12,640
has happened to me, and I just
have to shout it to the world.

145
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,440
Last night, i, Ted Gallagher,

146
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,745
went on a date with
a lovely angel named Linda.

147
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:20,522
And she has agreed to marry me, so...

148
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:24,928
Don't use the PA system.

149
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,266
Congratulations, Theodore!

150
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,600
That is big! Seriously?

151
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,816
You hear that, ladies?! Yeah!

152
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:38,833
This guy's off the market, so hands off.

153
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,786
- You know what that means?
- What?

154
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:42,984
We gotta throw this guy
a bachelor party.

155
00:08:44,138 --> 00:08:46,777
- What?
- Send you off in style. A little booze,

156
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:48,877
couple of naked ladies.
Let's get weird.

157
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,156
Yeah, I'd like that.
Let's do that, bert. Thank you.

158
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:53,895
Sure thing, chumpalyfriend.

159
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,140
You want to throw a party for Ted?

160
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,669
- Yeah, you hate Ted!
- Like Rainy days and sundays,

161
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:03,899
but I love bachelor parties.

162
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,184
And I am about to throw a bachelor
party that's gonna slap

163
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:09,079
all other bachelor parties
in the face with its private parts.

164
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:26,954
This way, sir.

165
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,913
A Mr. Oliver is here to see you, sir.

166
00:09:36,997 --> 00:09:39,705
- What can I do you for?
- I have your car.

167
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:45,828
That's very exciting news.

168
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:51,100
- I just need you to sign this.
- Let's have a looksie.

169
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:56,522
- Thank you, Benson, that'll be all.
- Thank you, sir.

170
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:58,940
- And Benson, one more thing.
- Yes, sir?

171
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:01,421
Oh, my god!

172
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:03,735
- It's a paintball gun.
- Why would you why...

173
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:06,424
Knock it off, Benson! You're supposed
to be a gentleman's gentleman,

174
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:08,000
ot a gentleman's wussy.

175
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:11,600
- It's little game we play. He loves it.
- Right, yeah.

176
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:13,965
If you could just sign that.

177
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:18,151
- I'm not signing this.
- Why?

178
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,713
- It's the deal for my soul.
- What?!

179
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:24,369
- And I don't like being tricked.
- No, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

180
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:26,630
I honestly thought
this was a delivery slip.

181
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,461
- I'd start running if I were you.
- Running? Why?

182
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:31,400
I just called for Barry Manilow.

183
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:34,419
Did the devil give you Barry Manilow?

184
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:44,938
Damn it!

185
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:50,284
Hey, numb nuts.

186
00:10:51,322 --> 00:10:52,703
You dropped something.

187
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:01,026
You're lucky this is just
a sprain, Mr. Oliver.

188
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:04,063
You should have come
see me a day or two ago.

189
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,029
Looks like it's been aggravated.

190
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:09,736
Well, take a rest for about a week,
and come back to see me.

191
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:11,222
Got it. Thank you.

192
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:15,265
You are lucky you didn't break anything.

193
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:19,040
Has anyone ever told you
you have the bone density of a canary?

194
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:21,399
I thought you said this
was going to be light duty.

195
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:23,223
The bear?

196
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:25,854
Yeah, I should have given you
a little head's up on that.

197
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,900
I did give him the damn thing after all.

198
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:29,233
Mea culpa.

199
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,604
Why didn't you tell me I was
actually going to have this idiot

200
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:34,059
- sign his soul over?
- I was just trying to protect you,

201
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,791
from yourself.

202
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,040
The minute you saw what was on that
paper, you get all nervous and blow it.

203
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,250
Ignorance is bliss.

204
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,401
- Well, I know now.
- Well, that changes nothing.

205
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:46,357
I want that guy's John Hancock
on that document.

206
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:50,380
I need the guarantee that only
a signature can provide, all right?

207
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:53,073
You know how verbal agreements
hold up in court.

208
00:11:53,148 --> 00:11:54,963
They fold like a dutch hooker.

209
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,069
He's no innocent.
You know, that guy is a douchebag.

210
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,778
You saw how he lives.

211
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,724
I own your soul,
you got to live up to the bargain.

212
00:12:04,576 --> 00:12:07,436
So why should that character
just skate into the high life?

213
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,100
Beep beep beep!

214
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:18,333
Wait, take it easy!
This equipment's expensive.

215
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,420
Nice robo-cast, by the way.
You finally went to the doctor.

216
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:24,743
Yeah, I really screwed it up
after I was chased by a bear.

217
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:26,309
What?! A bear?

218
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,452
Yeah. One minute I'm dropping off a car
for the devil, the next thing I know,

219
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:32,240
- a bear! It's not funny.
- Come on.

220
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,435
- All right, maybe it's a little funny.
- I just wish I would have been there.

221
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:40,004
I really miss hanging with you guys. I
can't believe i'm about to say this, but

222
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:44,040
I think I might prefer missions for the
devil than this suck ass management job.

223
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,185
Well, we're about to go out there
in a little bit. You want to join?

224
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:51,219
Who do I have to screw around here
to change out my register?

225
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,615
That's my life right now.

226
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,746
Next order of business...

227
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:01,224
Entertainment.

228
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:04,698
Right. So I reached out to some folks
at the clown college.

229
00:13:04,758 --> 00:13:05,420
What?

230
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,105
And they said that their first year
students can work for cheap,

231
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,473
and they're great
at doing balloon animals.

232
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:12,723
However, they're very limited
in their unicycle skills.

233
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:16,300
What are you talking about, clowns?
It's a bachelor party, Ben!

234
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:19,533
Well, key word there is party.
So when I think of party I think clowns.

235
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,309
Well, I disagree. Keyword
there is bachelor, all right?

236
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,465
So go ahead and call
the stripper college.

237
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:28,395
- Sock, trust me, clowns!
- Ben, trust me, strippers.

238
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,640
I got it.
Stripper clowns!

239
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:36,440
- That's gonna be.
- Oh, my god!

240
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,275
I can't believe we just had a
genius idea at the same time!

241
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:41,425
It's like the reese's cup
of party entertainment!

242
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:43,257
You got your peanut butter
in my chocolate.

243
00:13:43,317 --> 00:13:46,040
- I'm swirling.
- Ted! Just the man we wanted to see.

244
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,196
You are not going to believe what we
just invented for your bachelor party.

245
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,412
Forget about it.
The wedding's off.

246
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:53,921
- No, no, no! What'd you do?!
- Nothing.

247
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:57,727
I went over to discuss flower
arrangements, and it seems my fiancé

248
00:13:57,788 --> 00:13:59,579
had no idea that she was my fiancé.

249
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:03,274
Apparently she thought my
proposal was some kind of joke.

250
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:08,222
- A sick, sarcastic, dark joke.
- Listen, know what we're going to do?

251
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:10,882
We are still gonna have this party.

252
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,449
- I don't want to I don't think right.
- No, Ted, it's so right, OK?

253
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:16,432
Listen, it's a bachelor party, right?

254
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,391
You are a bachelor.
Hell, you are the bachelor!

255
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:22,467
Know what I mean? You're probably going
to be single for the rest of your life.

256
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:24,900
- Probably.
- Yeah, so let's celebrate that.

257
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:29,593
The world is your oyster, and a man
with an oyster world deserves a party.

258
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,373
- You think so?
- I know so.

259
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,426
- Now get away from me.
- OK.

260
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:39,420
I can't believe he almost ruined our
party with his stupid wedding.

261
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,345
Some people can just be selfish!

262
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,901
- Are you two on break?
- Always.

263
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,643
How do you guys feel about
doing some undercover work?

264
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:53,876
I don't remember ordering
12,000 pounds of bear kibble.

265
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,700
Listen, sir, we just
deliver the stuff, all right?

266
00:14:59,336 --> 00:15:01,102
I don't know why i'm doing this.

267
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:03,568
I like to keep my bear hungry.

268
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:06,497
- You guys know what I'm saying.
- Thank you.

269
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:12,600
I got you, Gary!

270
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:15,392
That form you signed, the
last page was your contract.

271
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:17,095
You thought you could screw me over?

272
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:19,138
Take all this stuff
and get away with it?

273
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,252
I do, and I did.

274
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:26,526
- "Jim Fartington?"
- It's called an alias. What's up!

275
00:15:27,646 --> 00:15:28,740
You know what?

276
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:32,340
I don't need your stupid signature, OK?
Look at the way you're living your life.

277
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,800
Right now at this very moment,
you're committing about a million sins.

278
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:37,802
Greed, gluttony,

279
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,659
- sloth, pride.
- Littering!

280
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:44,521
You're a terrible person, and you're
going to end up in hell when you die!

281
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,752
No, I'm not.
Because I got it all worked out.

282
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:50,489
I can get all this neat
crap without signing.

283
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,333
I live it up, and then on my death bed,

284
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,988
at the eleventh hour, I repent.

285
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,100
You can't just repent!

286
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,802
- Can you?
- That's what religion's all about, bro.

287
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,439
I'm sorry. My bad, god.

288
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:07,084
He'd look like a total Jerk
if he shut me out.

289
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:09,185
It's brilliant in its simplicity.

290
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:13,120
Thanks. Now get the hell out of here
before I bust out my bear.

291
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:15,447
He's hungry...
And horny.

292
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:35,569
What's going on?!

293
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,103
Who ate all the cereal?

294
00:16:39,484 --> 00:16:41,344
- Guilty.
- Yeah, I can see that.

295
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:45,771
Listen, Morgan,
there are rules in this society, OK?

296
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:48,332
And rule number 6
is I like to enjoy a bowl of cereal

297
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:50,575
while I catch up on my soaps
during the din-din hour.

298
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,400
Everybody knows that, OK?

299
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:55,272
I'm gonna let it slide, though,
'cause you're a good guy.

300
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:58,173
- You ever watch one life to live?
- Can't say that I have.

301
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,119
Brother, you're in for a treat! Man,
if you're gonna waste your life sitting

302
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,212
on the sofa, you might as well do it
with a little oltl you know what I mean?

303
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:05,490
It's crazy train.

304
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:10,848
That's weird. I had a whole week's
worth of episodes saved on here.

305
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,189
I erased them.

306
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,032
ESPN classic was running
a Marathon on the America's cup!

307
00:17:15,092 --> 00:17:17,293
- Man, I had to capture the memories.
- No!

308
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:20,337
Morgan, you do not
touch another man's DVR!

309
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:23,711
- You might as well hump my grandma!
- Easy, guy! It's just a soap opera!

310
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:25,457
You shut your mouth!

311
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:29,648
- Everything OK?
- No. Morgan erased my stories.

312
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:31,641
- What?!
- Whatever.

313
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:35,575
- Cute running suit.
- Thank you.

314
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:37,703
I was talking to Nina.

315
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,528
No, seriously.
You look hot.

316
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:44,036
Thanks, Morgan.
Thank you.

317
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:46,313
You OK?

318
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:49,466
Yeah, I'm fine.

319
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:52,013
I'm gonna go take a shower.

320
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:58,763
That's not cool, Morgan. You do not
hit on Nina. I love that girl.

321
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:01,957
Hey, man, listen.
I may not live by a lot of rules,

322
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:05,575
but if there's one that I stick to,
it's bros before hoes.

323
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:08,826
I would never do anything
to get in between you and Nina.

324
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:11,464
- All right.
- OK, look.

325
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:14,364
Come on, Benji, i'll let you make
me a sandwich. Let's go.

326
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,372
Just like the way you like to.

327
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,239
Sorry.

328
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:47,701
The, the door was open.

329
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:55,423
It's all right.
Accidents happen, right?

330
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:10,175
OK, did she cry and then spit up,
or did she spit up and cry?

331
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:13,800
What does the spit smell like?

332
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:20,012
All right, if she does it again,
just take a whiff and call me back.

333
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:21,142
All right, bye.

334
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,838
- Sorry, sorry.
- Is the baby OK?

335
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,740
That was like your
fifth call to check in.

336
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,902
She's fine. I'm just being
a stereotypical nervous parent.

337
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,010
So, what have you guys been up to?

338
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:37,222
- How are things?
- Well, not super.

339
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:40,301
I need to get this guy for the devil,
but he keeps giving us the slip.

340
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,333
- So what was his scene before he died?
- He hasn't died yet.

341
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:46,351
Wait-he's still alive?

342
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,514
Yeah. He sold his soul to the devil.

343
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:50,452
I gotta get him to sign his paperwork.

344
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:54,489
- No, no, no. Sam, you can't do this.
- Yeah, no, I can, and I want to.

345
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:56,297
You don't know this guy.

346
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:58,948
Sam, sending escaped souls back to hell,

347
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:01,321
that is one thing, but you
don't want to be the one

348
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:03,899
damning a mortal for
an eternity of torment.

349
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:06,402
That's crossing a line that
you just don't want to cross.

350
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:08,292
That is pure evil.

351
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:11,540
You'd be no different
than the devil himself.

352
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:16,297
OK, now in all fairness to Samuel here,
the guys is an enormous Dick.

353
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,528
No, he's right. You're right.

354
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,740
You know, I guess I just got used to
putting my head down and doing the job.

355
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,602
- I lost sight of the big picture.
- Well, that's why I'm here.

356
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:28,458
And... I have to go.

357
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:31,638
Oh, my god, you are so baby whipped.

358
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:35,365
No, actually, I have some friends
coming over. You know what,

359
00:20:36,123 --> 00:20:38,299
why don't you guys,
why don't you guys join me?

360
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:41,199
- I think you can get a lot out of it.
- Sounds good. Let's go.

361
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:49,263
- Is that jessie's girl?
- That's my jam.

362
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:52,515
Wait until you see what we've got.

363
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,580
And now, a reading from one
of Steve's favorite works,

364
00:21:06,947 --> 00:21:08,390
the between boyfriends book.

365
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,927
Don't you love it?
All Steve, all the time.

366
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,377
What is all this?

367
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:20,110
These chosen few are what's left
of our failed rebellion against Satan.

368
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,251
But we're all on the path of Steve now.

369
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:27,924
You see, Sam, Steve was a demon

370
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:29,791
who ascended to heaven.

371
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,237
That means that god is willing
to forgive a multitude of sins

372
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,701
and that there's a chance for us all.

373
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,600
You see, through him, through Steve,

374
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,497
we've learned that we can regain
the right to enter heaven again.

375
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:45,728
We're living his way,

376
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,437
earning our wings
one good deed at a time.

377
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:51,710
Steve anthology. Nice.

378
00:21:52,693 --> 00:21:55,662
If you ever feel like you're slipping
in your fight against Satan,

379
00:21:55,722 --> 00:21:58,421
please use us a refuge.

380
00:21:59,673 --> 00:22:01,178
We're here for you, Sam.

381
00:22:02,203 --> 00:22:04,179
- Thank you.
- Goose pate, anyone?

382
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,813
What are you doing here? I thought...

383
00:22:13,873 --> 00:22:16,037
You were going to be out
drinking too much.

384
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,049
What are you doing here?

385
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,569
Following the "Path of Steve."

386
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,679
What other secrets
are you hiding from me?

387
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:32,326
None, babe. I swear. I just didn't
know how to explain this one to you.

388
00:22:32,777 --> 00:22:35,344
And let's face it. You can be
a little bit judgy at times.

389
00:22:35,444 --> 00:22:37,340
I'm sick of you hiding stuff from me.

390
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,913
You should be happy about this.
I'm doing it for you.

391
00:22:40,646 --> 00:22:41,703
How's that?

392
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,601
You make me want to be a better demon.

393
00:22:56,948 --> 00:23:00,032
- Just no more secrets, OK?
- No, no more secrets.

394
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:02,278
Steve's honor.

395
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,086
Hey, you. How's it going?

396
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:13,140
Honestly? Not great.
I have to fill out, like, 220 hr forms.

397
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:15,689
To fill out, and then I still have
to correct an inventory

398
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:17,728
Right, Yeah your life is in the crapper.

399
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,842
Listen, I needs me a little favor?

400
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:22,852
As you may know, we've been
planning a party for Ted.

401
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:25,140
Little bachelor party.
And in the midst of planning,

402
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,454
we may have hit one or two
little budget restraints.

403
00:23:27,516 --> 00:23:30,240
- Yeah. I'm not giving you any money.
- Andi, please!

404
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,316
I don't want your money, all right?
What I want

405
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:35,642
is the work bench for one night, please.

406
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:39,309
- Absolutely not.
- Why not?

407
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:41,668
Because it totally goes
against company policy,

408
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,508
and it violates about a bajillion codes.

409
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:45,140
Codes? Policy?

410
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,877
Come here. I want to show you
something. Listen. Listen to me.

411
00:23:47,937 --> 00:23:50,344
All right. You see that big bag
of sadness standing right there?

412
00:23:50,474 --> 00:23:51,887
That's what this party's about.

413
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:54,713
He's dead inside.

414
00:23:55,422 --> 00:23:56,814
Sorry. No party.

415
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,193
The conversion is complete?

416
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:03,781
All hail Andi palpatine,
dark lord of the work bench.

417
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:06,229
- I guess people are right about you.
- What does that mean?

418
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,896
Nothing. You know. Just don't
think people really like this new

419
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:11,429
- Andi-thing you've become.
- That's crap.

420
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:16,509
- You know, people like me.
- They do? OK.

421
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:18,868
Tell me this, smarty-pants.
Where were you last week

422
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,175
when the entire paint
department went go-carting?

423
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,279
- I didn't know that they went.
- Exactly.

424
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,913
Because no one told you
because nobody likes you,

425
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,424
boss lady.

426
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,920
- Throw your party.
- Yes. Hot dog!

427
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:41,803
Andi, I knew you'd come through.

428
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:45,425
You're going to become
a legend for this. A legend.

429
00:24:57,734 --> 00:25:00,644
Ladies, we have discovered
the fountain of youth.

430
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:03,663
Right here in this little vial,

431
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:07,282
a purified protein
that relaxes the muscles,

432
00:25:07,552 --> 00:25:10,574
smoothes the skin,
eliminates the wrinkles.

433
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,177
Who would like to go first?

434
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:14,992
- Phyllis?
- Yeah!

435
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:19,454
Come here, darling.

436
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:33,922
We'll continue on with the rest of you
after I grab a quick snack.

437
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:38,527
Well, that was gross.

438
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:41,035
Vanity is one of my favorites.

439
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:44,991
Look how happy I make them, Sammy,
injecting them with botulism.

440
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:47,607
You got some pretty nasty crows feet.
Want me to pump you up?

441
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:49,174
No, I'm good. Thank you.

442
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,040
- Did you get Gary to sign?
- No.

443
00:25:53,556 --> 00:25:56,089
No, and I'm never going to.
It's not my job to acquire souls,

444
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:58,573
and I don't appreciate you
setting me up to cross that line.

445
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:00,426
Well, you can't blame me for trying.

446
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,589
Still, you know,
that Gary really chaps my ass.

447
00:26:04,036 --> 00:26:05,926
I rarely ever do verbal agreements.

448
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,188
I just assumed you'd be able
to close the deal on him.

449
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,293
I think he's a lost cause. He has a plan
to repent in the eleventh hour.

450
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,783
That old elenth hour chestnut?

451
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,551
I love that one.
God's perfect loophole.

452
00:26:20,262 --> 00:26:22,904
- Does that work?
- Not if I get him in the tenth hour.

453
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:27,663
I guess maybe I'll just
reel him in right now,

454
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:31,696
while he's running around
sinning like a nun at Mardi Gras,

455
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,440
before he even thinks of repenting.

456
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,157
Wait, wait. Hold on.
You can't just kill him, can you?

457
00:26:36,432 --> 00:26:38,522
I don't need to kill him myself.

458
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:42,488
I know it may be hard to believe but you
know, I hang with a pretty rough crowd.

459
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:46,214
You know, I got a guy who literally
kills for Madonna tickets?

460
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,162
- All right.
- Thanks for the info, though.

461
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,718
Nice job buddy.
Don't you worry about Gary.

462
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:55,114
I'll take care of him.

463
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:02,191
Yeah, on the one hand, Gary is a turd.

464
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,149
If it's brown, flush'er down.

465
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:06,691
But if I don't warn him that the
devil's going to have him killed,

466
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,835
that makes me responsible.
I'd be an accomplice to his murder.

467
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,640
That's a lot for one man's conscience.

468
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,716
Why are we even doing this dance?
We all know you're not going to sit back

469
00:27:14,776 --> 00:27:17,040
and watch this guy get killed.
That's not the game you play.

470
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,798
- He's right.
- So I guess i'll just,

471
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:20,940
what, tell him that the devil's
putting a hit on him?

472
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,943
Exactly. Sounds good to me. Now, since
we're already having a house meeting.

473
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:27,140
- We need to talk about your brother.
- Morgan's got to go.

474
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,737
Why? You guys love him.

475
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:32,890
We did love him until he ate everything
in house and erased one life to live.

476
00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:35,499
Seriously?
I was, like, 5 episodes behind.

477
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,779
And I think he's gonna
make a move on Nina.

478
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,173
She's a decent lady, Sam.
But she has her weaknesses.

479
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:43,884
And it's only a matter of time
before she falls for those

480
00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:45,913
glorious pecs and glistening abs.

481
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:48,967
You need to nudge that
little birdie out of the nest.

482
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:02,684
- We need to talk.
- You're kicking me out, right?

483
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,000
I was listening to your meeting.

484
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:08,778
You really think I got a shot with Nina?

485
00:28:08,838 --> 00:28:10,086
Come on. Forget Nina.

486
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,919
Do you have any idea how lucky you are?
You are free of the devil!

487
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,839
- You can do anything you want.
- Yeah. What's that?

488
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,514
That's something you got
to figure out for yourself.

489
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:20,352
I mean. That's what life's all about,

490
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:22,943
finding something you want
and going out and getting it.

491
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,588
The important part is...

492
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:27,784
- Going out.
- How am I going to do that?

493
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:30,249
Look at me.
I'm useless without dad's backing.

494
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,969
Come on. That's ridiculous.
You can do it because you're Morgan!

495
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,531
You get stuff done. You got focus,

496
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:40,799
charm, good looks,
a massive, massive ego.

497
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:45,002
You just, you got to find yourself
a goal. Something to reach for.

498
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:48,717
Easy for you to say, Sam.
You got everything you want.

499
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:52,674
- Hell, man. You have everything I want.
- And if I could, i'd give it to you.

500
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:54,231
Look, Morgan, I got to go.

501
00:28:56,023 --> 00:28:57,316
Find yourself a goal.

502
00:28:58,297 --> 00:28:59,963
'cause you got to get out of here.

503
00:29:17,645 --> 00:29:18,640
Enough, already.

504
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,140
The cat-and-mouse stuff was fun,
but I'm tired of it.

505
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,187
Now leave before I send 1,000 volts
from your eyeballs to your a-hole.

506
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,072
Listen. I came to warn you. The devil's
not going to give up on your soul.

507
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:32,894
He knows about your eleventh hour plan,
he's putting a hit out on you right now.

508
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:36,357
Oh, crap!
Oh, crap!

509
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:40,133
You better do your repenting thing now.
You might not have a lot of time.

510
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:42,400
About that. How exactly does one repent?

511
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,552
- You don't know?
- Not really.

512
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,493
That was your whole thing.
Repent in the eleventh hour.

513
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,916
But that's when I thought the
eleventh hour was decades away.

514
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,650
I figured I'd join a class
or take up bible study.

515
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:58,064
I may know somebody who could help.

516
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:09,885
Cheer up, sad clown.

517
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:12,228
This forecast calls for rain.

518
00:30:18,465 --> 00:30:21,176
You are a beautiful clown.

519
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,711
Oh, my gosh.

520
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,449
Could you?

521
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:30,440
- What do you want?
- A doggie.

522
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:51,682
- Nice balloon dog.
- What are you doing here?

523
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:54,339
"New Andi" is here to make sure you
don't burn the place down.

524
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,620
I'm sure she is.

525
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:58,771
"Old Andi"
is here to laugh at stuff like that...

526
00:31:03,282 --> 00:31:05,657
Time of my life!
I love it!

527
00:31:11,634 --> 00:31:14,026
Come on in! This is the best time ever!

528
00:31:14,086 --> 00:31:16,600
Ted I love you. You are never going
to see something like that again.

529
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,542
That is a once-in-a-lifetime
event right there.

530
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:20,545
Andi, boilermaker. Let's do it

531
00:31:21,328 --> 00:31:23,130
Do it for "old Andi." Come on.

532
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,000
- Yeah, drop it in there.
- You know what? Screw it.

533
00:31:27,013 --> 00:31:29,078
- Let's do it!
- Come on, chug! Chug!

534
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,464
Hey, wrong party, guy.

535
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:37,672
Didn't order any office
strippers, sorry.

536
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:40,493
We're from the home office.
Who's in charge here?

537
00:31:42,215 --> 00:31:45,598
I am the master!

538
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,140
Welcome to the work bench.
Can I help you?

539
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,393
We received a call tonight
about a party here

540
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:57,040
from mister Ted Gallagher?

541
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:03,151
Hey, guys.

542
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,240
Thanks for coming.

543
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,440
Ted? Why,
after all the stuff we did for you.

544
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,362
And I appreciate it. This is the nicest
thing that anyone's ever done for me.

545
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:11,886
But rules are rules,

546
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:14,540
and this tiger doesn't change
his stripes for nobody.

547
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:17,433
Miss prendergast,
can we speak to you for a moment?

548
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:25,108
That's...
That's a shame.

549
00:32:25,432 --> 00:32:27,540
- Such wasted talent.
- Run.

550
00:32:27,768 --> 00:32:30,023
- Sorry?
- Run! Ted!

551
00:32:42,347 --> 00:32:43,615
Where is everybody?

552
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:45,935
The boys went to a bachelor party.

553
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,653
Why would Ben leave you
behind for a bachelor party?

554
00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:53,339
It's OK.
I trust Ben.

555
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:55,004
He's a good guy.

556
00:32:56,323 --> 00:32:57,504
Not like you.

557
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:00,115
You're a bad boy, aren't you?

558
00:33:01,455 --> 00:33:04,600
- You have no idea.
- I think I can imagine.

559
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,600
I've always wanted to be with a demon.

560
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,299
I shouldn't.

561
00:33:15,182 --> 00:33:16,264
Why not?

562
00:33:19,385 --> 00:33:20,385
I'm...

563
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,288
Trying to break this cycle
that I'm in of...

564
00:33:24,998 --> 00:33:27,237
Going after evil guys like you.

565
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:30,040
Yeah, but I'm not even really a bad boy.

566
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,889
- You said you were.
- That was just to get you in bed.

567
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:35,180
I don't know.

568
00:33:37,236 --> 00:33:39,213
What do I have to do to prove it to you?

569
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,142
You could...

570
00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:44,763
Go to my prayer meeting with me tonight.

571
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,833
Religion.

572
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,317
Sounds kinky.

573
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,392
I'll go get my coat.

574
00:33:57,979 --> 00:34:00,689
So you see, Gary, praying is great.
Never hurts to communicate.

575
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:02,889
But if you want to get into heaven,

576
00:34:03,189 --> 00:34:05,701
it's about more than words.
It's about the path of Steve.

577
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,611
And that path is paved
through action, Gary.

578
00:34:10,084 --> 00:34:11,154
Good deeds.

579
00:34:11,972 --> 00:34:12,979
I see.

580
00:34:17,884 --> 00:34:20,740
That is the dumbest load
of crap that I've ever heard.

581
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,575
The path of Steve?
Good lord!

582
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,341
Tony's right, Gary.

583
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,796
There's still hope.
There's time to seek redemption.

584
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:29,900
Listen to Tony.

585
00:34:30,322 --> 00:34:31,651
How are you guys doing that?

586
00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:33,976
- Doing what?
- That.

587
00:34:37,637 --> 00:34:41,161
- What are you talking about?
- The guy on the Tv. He's talking to me.

588
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,798
- They can't see me, Gary.
- This isn't funny. Don't mock us.

589
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:48,279
I know how to make him believe you.
Kiss him. It's OK. Go ahead.

590
00:34:48,437 --> 00:34:50,875
But when you do,
make sure you give him one of these.

591
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:53,953
He's telling me to do this.

592
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:03,140
Well, he's definitely
getting pointers from Steve.

593
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,062
- You can tell by that?
- Well, he did the double butt grab.

594
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:08,478
That's Steve's signature move.

595
00:35:12,752 --> 00:35:15,435
- What does Steve want?
- I need you to warn Sam.

596
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:17,053
He's telling me to warn you.

597
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:20,300
- Warn me about what?
- Probably me.

598
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:27,569
You should be really proud of yourself,
Sam. You gave me some good advice.

599
00:35:27,996 --> 00:35:30,270
I mean, I have a goal now.
Not to mention...

600
00:35:31,594 --> 00:35:33,949
- I found my killer instinct.
- Where did you get a gun?

601
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:36,483
- I'm always strapped, honey.
- Morgan, what are you doing?

602
00:35:36,652 --> 00:35:40,655
Taking your advice. Taking charge.
I want to be back on dad's good side,

603
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:42,950
and I'm going to do that
by getting rid of you,

604
00:35:43,063 --> 00:35:45,700
and then, I'm going to turn in these
traitors and be rewarded.

605
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,565
Thanks for the pep talk.

606
00:36:03,405 --> 00:36:06,601
That's unfortunate.
I just had this carpet cleaned.

607
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:15,100
Just watch the doorway.

608
00:36:15,447 --> 00:36:16,447
Great.

609
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:22,806
Heavy?
Thank you.

610
00:36:24,255 --> 00:36:26,928
- Sorry about the mess.
- What are you going to do?

611
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:30,244
I can't believe that just happened.
I can't believe you killed Morgan.

612
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,859
We had to do it, Sam.

613
00:36:31,996 --> 00:36:35,441
We're required to hunt the devil's
offspring and destroy them

614
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:37,533
in order to prevent Armageddon.

615
00:36:38,425 --> 00:36:40,315
Sorry. I just couldn't tell anyone.

616
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:42,527
Yeah, but what about me?
I'm the son of the devil.

617
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:43,856
You're different.

618
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:47,438
You have your own destiny.
Steve told me that, too.

619
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,399
How am I different?
What else did he say?

620
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,576
Nothing.
Everything.

621
00:36:52,534 --> 00:36:53,666
I can't explain.

622
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,700
I heard his thoughts,
I felt his presence.

623
00:36:55,762 --> 00:36:58,094
I've never experienced
anything like that before.

624
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,253
I have to go.

625
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,655
- I have to give it all away.
- Give what away?

626
00:37:05,562 --> 00:37:08,795
I'm shedding all my material possessions
and helping those who need it.

627
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:14,336
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone about
the murder that occurred here tonight.

628
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,200
Well, look who's together.

629
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,626
- Ben, come on. It's not like that.
- I know.

630
00:37:36,259 --> 00:37:38,206
I trust you. You're not like Morgan.

631
00:37:41,017 --> 00:37:43,385
Nina, I don't know what
I'd do if you were with that guy.

632
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:48,871
No. What did you do?

633
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,777
And I want the truth.

634
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
I...

635
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,427
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

636
00:38:08,023 --> 00:38:09,230
I sort of...

637
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:13,135
Acted like I would have sex with Morgan

638
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:15,970
so he would come with me to Tony's
house so I could kill him.

639
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,248
I'm still assigned to kill
the offspring of the devil,

640
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,116
like I tried to do with Sam.

641
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:29,934
- So all that flirting was...
- Was just me setting a trap.

642
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,390
You're a demon assassin.

643
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:38,164
You're just a demon assassin!

644
00:38:38,596 --> 00:38:41,369
A faithful, not-cheating-on-me assassin.

645
00:38:41,538 --> 00:38:43,278
Give me some sugar, baby.

646
00:38:49,896 --> 00:38:51,065
Don't mind me.

647
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:53,813
Just looking for this right here.

648
00:38:55,974 --> 00:38:57,750
Did you bring home a stripper clown?

649
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:03,002
Let's try it again with the nose off.

650
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,833
Where is our lovely host?

651
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:25,587
Young lady?

652
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,032
Could you get your
mother Phyllis for me?

653
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,283
You.

654
00:39:31,107 --> 00:39:33,540
What could I possibly
do to improve on this look?

655
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:34,999
Bigger lips!

656
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,069
They are a bit flat.

657
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:47,679
Here, take this.

658
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:50,802
Why don't you practice on each other?

659
00:39:52,997 --> 00:39:54,178
What gives, Sammy?

660
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,040
It seems that Gary
has turned down my deal,

661
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,333
and he's driving his bear to
the shambala wildlife preserve tonight.

662
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,314
Really?

663
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:04,201
&He's planning to help Tippi
hedren care for her wild animals.

664
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,987
- Well, good for him.
- Don't be coy with me.

665
00:40:07,837 --> 00:40:09,852
I think you know something about this.

666
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:13,394
I had to call off his hit when he took
the martyred highway straight to heaven.

667
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:16,312
I'm sorry. I couldn't stand by
and let someone die.

668
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,930
You mean like watching as a man,

669
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:22,429
a brother, is ripped apart by demons?

670
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:26,424
- You know anything about that?
- I didn't do it.

671
00:40:31,724 --> 00:40:33,378
Fratricide, Sammy?

672
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:35,689
You constantly amaze me, man.

673
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,087
Morgan is being tortured
in hell right now.

674
00:40:39,474 --> 00:40:40,928
Keeps calling out your name.

675
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,140
I just hope ol'Morgan doesn't
figure out a way to escape from hell,

676
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,111
for your sake. I don't think
he's your biggest fan right now.

677
00:40:50,673 --> 00:40:52,327
Well, where were we, ladies?

678
00:40:55,402 --> 00:40:57,665
Jeez! Good one.

679
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,851
- That was a solid double.
- Thank you. I'm a little wet.

680
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:03,969
OK, so let me get this straight.

681
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:06,923
Steve possessed this guy,
and then

682
00:41:06,983 --> 00:41:09,991
he told you that you're different
than the other sons of the devil?

683
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:13,011
He wasn't possessed.
He was speaking to him on a karaoke DVD.

684
00:41:13,445 --> 00:41:15,472
That makes much more sense. Right.

685
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,972
- You know, different is good, right?
- Different is definitely good.

686
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:20,034
Right.

687
00:41:22,971 --> 00:41:23,971
So...

688
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,938
You got demoted?

689
00:41:26,013 --> 00:41:28,152
Yeah. I'm not even allowed
to work the registers.

690
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:30,763
- I can't believe Ted.
- It's OK, actually.

691
00:41:30,998 --> 00:41:32,963
You know, I was sick of all the stress.

692
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:37,573
You know? And now, I have
more time to do other stuff. Like this.

693
00:41:41,447 --> 00:41:42,616
I missed this.

694
00:41:44,046 --> 00:41:45,059
Me, too.

695
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:47,795
Things almost feel
like they're back to normal.

696
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,629
I know!

697
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:53,259
Close enough for now, right?

698
00:41:57,796 --> 00:42:07,968
