1
00:00:01,457 --> 00:00:03,340
This is a carjacking?
Are you carjacking me?

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,591
I'm the Devil.

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:09,854
Before you were born, your
mom and I sold your soul to the Devil.

4
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:12,175
- You going to tell Andi?
- I'm not going to tell Andi.

5
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:14,169
If she knows,
she'll never go out with me.

6
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,935
You can make her go out with you.

7
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:18,238
You're just going to bring
escaped souls back to hell.

8
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:19,556
That's cool, right?

9
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:21,965
<i>- But how am I supposed to capture them?</i>
- This will help...

10
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:24,320
<i>A vessel hand-crafted
in the bowels of perdition</i>

11
00:00:24,444 --> 00:00:26,075
<i>by the iniquitous and the vile.</i>

12
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:28,519
- That will work.
- Word of caution...

13
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:30,289
I don't accept failure.

14
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,570
<i>You finally found the
one thing that you're good at.</i>

15
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:35,141
<i>You sent an escaped soul back to hell.</i>

16
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,262
Cady. Hey, it's me.

17
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:43,393
Um, I haven't talked
to you since you left.

18
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:45,162
I hope everything's OK.

19
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:49,140
Give me a call when you get this.
All right. Bye-bye.

20
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,322
Are we really going to discuss this?

21
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:56,412
I mean, seriously, Benji,
we are living next door to 2 demons.

22
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:59,342
Demons. All right.
As cuddly and cute as they are,

23
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:03,432
I cannot live in the same building with
2 cat-eating, horny freaks, all right?

24
00:01:03,556 --> 00:01:05,763
- We're moving out asap.
- Moving out where?

25
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:08,453
Your mom doesn't want you
living in the house anymore,

26
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:11,022
and I don't have another place lined up.

27
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:12,351
What about you, Sam?

28
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:14,700
Look, I'm the last person
who wants to live next to demons.

29
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:17,030
- Thank you.
- But we signed a lease on this condo.

30
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:18,992
We break it,
we don't get our deposit back.

31
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:20,922
Money. Money, schmoney. Come on.

32
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,831
If I had been worried about money my
whole life, where do you think I'd be?

33
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:25,293
You'd not be broke, right?

34
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:29,141
They do do our laundry, though. I love
when my boxers smell like lemongrass.

35
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:31,391
And that beer tasting party on saturday?

36
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:33,421
That may have been
the best night of my life.

37
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,761
They definitely amped up our style.

38
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:39,432
Dude, check this sweater out
that they got me for my birthday.

39
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:41,772
- What?
- When was your birthday?

40
00:01:42,077 --> 00:01:43,073
Monday.

41
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:44,352
We totally spaced.

42
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:46,562
- Why didn't you say anything, dude?
- It's fine.

43
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:48,201
Steve and Tony took me out

44
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:50,911
to this awesome bar
called George Ultra Lounge.

45
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:53,533
Dude, that's a gay bar.

46
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:57,241
Oh. Yeah. That explains a lot.

47
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,823
OK. Look, we're getting off topic here.

48
00:01:59,948 --> 00:02:01,700
Steve and Tony smell terrific,

49
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:05,963
and yes, they have great taste in beer,
but they are demons.

50
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:07,950
Let's just try to avoid them.

51
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:10,640
You know, let's just
chill out this relationship,

52
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:14,130
put a little separation between us.
- All right. Fine. Whatever.

53
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,143
What, it takes 3 of you ladies
to get a stain out of my chair?

54
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:20,263
It does if you want it done right, which
is the only way we know how to do it.

55
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:21,332
You no likey?

56
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:24,892
Get out on the floor right now, you
nimrods. You're done in here. Let's go.

57
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:28,500
Here you go. She's ready.
Nimrods? That's a good one.

58
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,381
Hello.

59
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,202
Good job, sir. Good job.

60
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:39,061
Got Ted with the
old slip and slide, huh?

61
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:41,432
Hey, Sam, can I borrow you a second?

62
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:46,251
So. So, what's up?

63
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:48,643
I just wanted to apologize

64
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,571
for what I said about Cady
the other day, for being weird.

65
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:55,041
- I was totally out of line.
- No, no. It's OK. She's...

66
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:58,592
She's visiting her mom in New Mexico.
We're trying to work stuff out.

67
00:02:58,825 --> 00:02:59,943
Oh. OK. Good.

68
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:03,833
And I know you're just
trying to be a good friend.

69
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:05,231
That's the thing, Sam.

70
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,452
I wasn't trying to be a good friend.

71
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:12,011
Actually, I wasn't even
being a friend to you at all.

72
00:03:12,137 --> 00:03:13,480
What do you mean?

73
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:18,893
I tried to deny it in the
beginning because I really...

74
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:21,241
I don't want to ruin this friendship.

75
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:23,950
And... god.
It's kind of embarrassing, because it...

76
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:29,290
It took me seeing you with Cady
for me to realize the truth, and...

77
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:33,892
the thing is that I see
you as more than a friend.

78
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:35,963
I like you.

79
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:39,300
I like you.

80
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:46,640
I don't know what to say.

81
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:48,840
There's nothing to say.

82
00:03:49,136 --> 00:03:50,451
I'm sorry. You know what?

83
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:52,861
I just really needed to
get that off my chest. That's all.

84
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:54,162
It's nothing.

85
00:03:58,267 --> 00:03:59,113
What?

86
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:04,932
Season 1, Episode 13 - Acid Queen
For www.forom.com

87
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:12,570
This is the third
text from Steve and Tony.

88
00:04:12,697 --> 00:04:14,893
- Maybe I should write back.
- No. Absolutely not.

89
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:16,261
Stay strong, OK?

90
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:20,330
Yeah, but I miss Steve and Tony. I mean,
they're like our cool, fun uncles.

91
00:04:20,455 --> 00:04:22,832
Benji, have you ever had a cool,
fun uncle?

92
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:24,101
Uncle Hector.

93
00:04:24,707 --> 00:04:26,513
Uncles are creepy by definition, OK?

94
00:04:26,637 --> 00:04:28,600
Have you not been watching your S.V.U.?

95
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,381
Where you been?

96
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,781
I was driving around a bit.

97
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:36,820
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

98
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:39,140
- He misses Cady.
- Oh, is that it?

99
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:42,321
You miss your girlfriend, Sam?
It's cool to admit it, you know.

100
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,951
Real men share their feelings, OK?

101
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:45,271
That's what Tony says.

102
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:46,562
Actually, Andi...

103
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,170
Not it.
Not it.

104
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,241
- Damn it.
- Yes. Go get the door.

105
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:55,182
- Guys, guys.
- Yeah?

106
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:56,841
It's Steve and Tony.

107
00:04:58,926 --> 00:04:59,753
We...

108
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:02,482
Hey, guys, what's up!

109
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:05,522
Hey. We were in the neighborhood.
We thought we'd stop by, say bonjour.

110
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:07,071
- Bonjour!
- French.

111
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:08,851
Is now a bad time?

112
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:10,730
Is it a... what time is it?

113
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,372
Oh, it's... phew!

114
00:05:12,858 --> 00:05:15,310
We made some apricot...
Very good muffins.

115
00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:18,061
You boys might like them.
They're delicious and nutritious.

116
00:05:18,188 --> 00:05:20,630
- Hot stuff coming through.
- Come in.

117
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:22,493
So.

118
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:25,941
Haven't seen you guys around in a while.

119
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:28,992
Something wrong?

120
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:31,481
- Wrong?
- What would be wrong?

121
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,123
You've ignored my texts.

122
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:34,922
You avoided me in the parking lot, Sam.

123
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:37,120
We were supposed to
do some yoga the other day,

124
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,921
but I wound up doing
downward-facing dog all by myself.

125
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:42,341
All right. All right. I forgot.

126
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:45,810
I guess we're just a little
confused because we thought

127
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:48,180
we're having a great time,
things are going well.

128
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,813
And what happened?

129
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:51,853
- Is it something we did?
- Something we said?

130
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:53,123
No. No.

131
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:58,572
You're right. You're right. Look. Uh...

132
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:01,293
this is tough for all of us, OK?

133
00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:04,501
But you 2 deserve to
hear this in person, I think.

134
00:06:05,246 --> 00:06:06,662
Right now, right here...

135
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,203
From Sam.

136
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:11,792
Tell them.

137
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:17,103
Look. Steve, Tony...

138
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:20,250
- You guys are great guys.
- Thank you, Sam.

139
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,720
It's just we're...

140
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:25,482
We're just going through
some things right now.

141
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:26,382
Wacko.

142
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:29,610
We just thought it would be best if,
for right now,

143
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,640
if we didn't hang out as much.

144
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:36,315
- Are you dumping us?
- And it's not you.

145
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,989
- It's us.
- Oh, man.

146
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,369
It's us.

147
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:43,153
I mean, we need time for ourselves,
space, to think about things.

148
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:45,653
That was a mistake.
God. What are we doing?

149
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:47,532
We shouldn't have done this in person.

150
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,922
We should have done this
over the phone or text messaging,

151
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:53,512
- something less personal and brave.
- You know what? We're leaving.

152
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,492
Before we do something...

153
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,562
that we regret.

154
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:02,150
- Sam.
- Like what?

155
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:04,520
Come on, Steven.

156
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:10,992
- Those muffins look good.
- Sorry.

157
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:14,932
Oh, man.

158
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:16,812
I'm going to barf.

159
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,313
Something we'll regret?
What the hell does that mean?

160
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,902
That means we're about this
close to becoming demon dinner.

161
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:24,811
Hey, you guys want a Sock,
Sam, and Ben muffin?

162
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:27,060
They're delicious and nutritious.

163
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,243
We really got to find a new place.

164
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:33,092
I think I heard Steve crying
through the wall last night.

165
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:35,582
No. No, you didn't. That was Tony.

166
00:07:35,936 --> 00:07:37,443
He's got that weird nasally,

167
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:39,501
quivery Streisand thing
he does when he's upset.

168
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:43,781
But they are demons, all right?
I've got to stay strong on this one.

169
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:45,892
I'm not going to break.

170
00:07:46,628 --> 00:07:49,220
- It's hard, man.
- Sammy, would you please do something?

171
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:53,313
Poop! What are you doing?

172
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:56,140
Sorry, man.
I'm just... I'm distracted right now.

173
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:58,022
- Clearly.
- What, about the demons?

174
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,891
- No. With Andi.
- Great. Here we go. Andi.

175
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:02,481
Andi told me she likes me.

176
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,100
- What did you just say?
- Yeah, I know.

177
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:08,802
Please tell me you professed
your undying love for her.

178
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:11,161
I can't do that. I have a girlfriend.

179
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:13,322
God! You and Cady are on a break, Sam.

180
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:14,992
Yeah, something that she suggested.

181
00:08:15,157 --> 00:08:17,121
Isn't this kind of what
you always wanted, Sam?

182
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,122
- Yeah. Yeah.
- OK, then. Come on.

183
00:08:19,246 --> 00:08:21,582
You've been dying to get with
Andi since the beginning of time.

184
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:23,150
I say you got to go for it.

185
00:08:23,276 --> 00:08:25,961
What, and just break up with Cady?
Doesn't that make me look like a jerk?

186
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:28,811
You're better off breaking up
with Cady and getting together with Andi

187
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:31,573
than staying with Cady
and secretly pining for Andi.

188
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:33,512
You sound like a
12-year-old girl right now.

189
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:37,123
Well, pardon me for being
in touch with my feelings, Sam. OK?

190
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:39,490
But you could take a lesson from me.

191
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,671
Hey, Andi. Need help with this?

192
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,061
Yeah, thank you.

193
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:52,751
- Thank you.
- All right.

194
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:55,683
- Hey, um, about the other day...
- I feel like an idiot, Sam.

195
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,872
I really should have never
put you in that position.

196
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,243
I know you're with Cady,
and I know that the timing sucks,

197
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,420
and I just shouldn't have
put it out there like that.

198
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:04,430
But I did,
and I know I can't take it back.

199
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:07,003
- And I'm just really sorry.
- Oh, no, no.

200
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,370
Don't be sorry.

201
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:11,423
You just... you surprised me.

202
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:13,272
Yeah. I get it.

203
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:22,562
I finish this up for me, please?

204
00:09:22,725 --> 00:09:24,151
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

205
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:57,012
Bubbles?

206
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,620
That's so lame.

207
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:00,473
Say, "cheese."

208
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:20,161
Serious question for you.

209
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:22,292
Are you a boob man, ass man, leg man?

210
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,753
- What's your preference?
- I'm not having this conversation.

211
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:27,430
I've always been more
of a leg man myself.

212
00:10:27,555 --> 00:10:29,603
- Would you stop it?
- Come on.

213
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:32,313
What's a little locker
room talk between friends?

214
00:10:32,437 --> 00:10:33,782
We're not friends.

215
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:36,633
Look at this sea of beautiful fish.

216
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:40,170
Who wouldn't want to play the field?

217
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:42,601
All right. Let's get on with this.
What's behind the curtain?

218
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,521
I thought you'd never ask, Dorothy.

219
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:47,440
Hold onto your ruby slippers.

220
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:52,663
- Oh, my god.
- Nasty, huh?

221
00:10:52,806 --> 00:10:55,251
- She's burned.
- She was, yes. With acid.

222
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:56,622
Damn shame, too.

223
00:10:56,998 --> 00:10:58,571
She was one of the beautiful people,

224
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:00,990
spent years perfecting
that size zero physique.

225
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:03,791
Now, who cares about the
body when you got a face like that?

226
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,913
- So, the soul did that?
- Gold star, Sam.

227
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,040
All those lovely scars are courtesy
of Miss Nicole Manders herself.

228
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,481
But why?

229
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:15,380
Well, what else could invoke
so much wrath in the female species?

230
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:16,803
Jealousy, Sam.

231
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:19,993
Our little scarred model
there beat out Miss Micole

232
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:21,800
for a very lucrative fashion campaign.

233
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:26,433
Narcissism. One of my favorite virtues.

234
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:46,183
Hey, guys. I'm going to take the stairs.

235
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,732
The stairs. Yeah.

236
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:06,852
I'm driving as fast as I can.

237
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,621
Thanks, guys, leave me to take the heat.

238
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:15,020
Are they gone yet?

239
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:19,742
Yes. They're gone.

240
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:25,102
Can one of you guys explain
to me how to make my heart explode

241
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:27,672
so I never have to feel this pain again?

242
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:31,903
The Devil gave me the name of a soul...
Nicole Manders, nicknamed Nikki.

243
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:34,720
What are the odds a narcissistic
soul changes her appearance

244
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,850
- when she comes back from hell?
- Not likely.

245
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:39,783
As cosmo says, you find a look
for yourself and you stick with it.

246
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:42,343
Oh, my god.
She's hot, especially for a dead chick.

247
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:46,313
Says here she was jackknifed
in prison 2 years ago.

248
00:12:46,537 --> 00:12:48,140
So much for miss congeniality.

249
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:51,280
She plead guilty to attacking
her younger, hotter sister with acid.

250
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:52,851
So, what, we're dealing with

251
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:55,970
a hot soul who's going
around killing even hotter women?

252
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:58,480
Is it wrong that I'm aroused
and disgusted at the same time?

253
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:00,741
Probably, but you shouldn't
beat yourself up over it.

254
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:01,952
Thanks, Benji.

255
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,653
It says here that Nikki
used to work at Seattle style.

256
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:05,920
What the hell is that?

257
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,741
You're a real culture vulture,
aren't you?

258
00:13:08,977 --> 00:13:12,710
Seattle style. It's only Seattle's hippest
up-and-coming fashion magazine du jour.

259
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:15,401
What?

260
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:18,422
I read fashion magazines on the toilet.

261
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,551
It's a thing that I do. Lay off!

262
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:29,663
Maybe I should be reading Seattle style,
too, huh, Sock?

263
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:31,532
We got to find somebody
we can relate to.

264
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:33,703
You know, someone on our level.

265
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,243
I know a brother when I see one.

266
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:47,862
Come on.

267
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:05,522
That's good for me, too.

268
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:08,473
Kendell, thanks, man.
Thanks for talking with us.

269
00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:09,803
Hey, no problem.

270
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:12,683
Anything that gets me away from
my desk for 5 minutes ain't all bad.

271
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:15,432
Working at this job with
all these hot chicks around here?

272
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,943
- This job's awesome.
- This is a dream job!

273
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:20,391
I like this kid.

274
00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:23,032
Kendell, have you ever seen this girl?

275
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:25,651
That's Nikki, Nikki Manders.

276
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:27,623
Hot as hell, isn't she?

277
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:29,392
Total nut job, though.

278
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:32,290
She actually got into a fight here with
another girl a couple of years back.

279
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,660
- Management fired her ass.
- Who'd she get in a fight with?

280
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:35,861
Angela.

281
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:37,261
Who's Angela?

282
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,740
She's here.

283
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:44,983
- That's Angela.
- Hello.

284
00:14:45,108 --> 00:14:47,302
Her and...
Please, please don't touch her.

285
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:48,653
- I just...
- Yeah.

286
00:14:48,777 --> 00:14:52,060
Actually, her and Nikki were competing
in this in-house modeling competition.

287
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:54,260
The winner got a phat
2-year modeling contract.

288
00:14:54,388 --> 00:14:56,390
Let me guess...
Angela won and Nikki freaked out?

289
00:14:56,555 --> 00:14:59,301
Security literally had to
escort Nikki from the building.

290
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:01,183
- That's hot.
- Is Angela around?

291
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:03,992
- You think we could maybe talk with her?
- No. She's not in today.

292
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:06,613
She writes this column for
our magazine called "It girl."

293
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:08,680
You know the column "It girl"?

294
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:12,921
Anyway, she prefers
to write back here at night.

295
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:15,040
She says that she likes the quiet.

296
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,301
I think Angela might
be the next "It girl,"

297
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:19,671
if you know what I'm talking about.
She's such a party girl.

298
00:15:20,048 --> 00:15:21,993
She loves this place
called the crush lounge.

299
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:24,362
She goes there every ladies' night.

300
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,110
All right. Bathroom's all clear.

301
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:39,870
No sign of her on the dance floor.

302
00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:41,061
She must have left.

303
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,211
- No, hey, guys.
- Ladies.

304
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:46,870
High fashion model? Guarantee
you she's hanging out right in there.

305
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:48,681
Is that vip or something?

306
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:51,050
Guys, guys. Angela's in there. Look.

307
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,921
Son of a bitch.
We have to get past that bouncer.

308
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:56,192
I know. I'm on this. Check it out.

309
00:15:57,806 --> 00:16:00,111
All right, look, sir.

310
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:04,632
My tight,
toned, well-defined man mountain.

311
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,041
How would you like a little
finsky for all your troubles,

312
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,993
- if you know what I'm saying?
- What is he doing?

313
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:12,431
Not... enough.

314
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,681
OK. All right.

315
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:15,470
OK. He shoved me.

316
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:17,512
That's assault.

317
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:19,801
That's Nikki right there.
That's Nikki right there.

318
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:22,741
Damn it, I'm tired of dancing
with this guy. It is go time, Sam.

319
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:25,492
- We've got to get you in there asap.
- You think you can take him?

320
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:27,060
No. Absolutely not.

321
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,501
We can hold him down long
enough to get you in there for sure.

322
00:16:29,628 --> 00:16:31,903
- Let's do it. We can do it.
- Just one thing. One thing.

323
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:32,772
Listen.

324
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:35,500
My bail money is in my mom's dresser,
second drawer to the right.

325
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:38,070
- Right. Right.
- OK. Let's go, Benji.

326
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:39,680
Coming at you!

327
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:43,670
- I got him! I got him!
- Benji, he's like a bull!

328
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:48,051
I got him! I got him!

329
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:05,231
Hey, Angela, come here.
I want you to meet someone.

330
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,722
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

331
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:49,753
Cady, hey. It's me again.

332
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:52,653
Give me a call back when you get this.
I really need to talk to you.

333
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:54,703
Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.

334
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,120
If it isn't our lovely ex-friend Sam.

335
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,920
- Hello, Sam.
- Hey.

336
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,123
Didn't expect to see you guys here.

337
00:18:03,286 --> 00:18:06,503
Well, if we'd known you were
working here today, you wouldn't have.

338
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,173
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.

339
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:12,122
Just to satisfy my
own morbid curiosity, Sam,

340
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:13,803
what did Tony and I ever do to you?

341
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:17,512
Well, you guys, you didn't do anything.

342
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:19,223
Well, you sure act like we did.

343
00:18:19,437 --> 00:18:21,481
No, it's not what you did. It's...

344
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:24,483
It's what you are.

345
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:28,462
I told you.

346
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:30,443
- No, you said it.
- It's 'cause we're gay.

347
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:31,753
No! Of course not.

348
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,370
- It's not...
- Well, then, what is it, Sam?

349
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:37,071
- What is it?
- You guys are demons.

350
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:39,311
Well, I mean...

351
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:40,742
I'm speechless.

352
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:43,282
I don't know what to say about that.
I don't know what to say.

353
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:47,253
- The homophobe thing, all right.
- I don't agree with it. I understand it.

354
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,300
But fallen angels doomed to walk the
earth for eternity, that weirds you out?

355
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:53,503
- We exist.
- It's not normal.

356
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:55,473
It's biology versus society.

357
00:18:55,596 --> 00:18:57,991
What's normal, Sam? You're a reaper.

358
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,720
I play racquetball with Gladys.
She told me.

359
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:03,680
- I thought this was the 21st century.
- Apparently not.

360
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:06,381
I mean, does he even know that
I'm one of the top publicists in town,

361
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:08,980
or that Steve here is
a home security engineer,

362
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:11,691
that he's designed
over a dozen... a dozen?

363
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:14,690
- More like 20.
- 20 complex security systems, OK?

364
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:18,001
For you ungrateful human beings,
to keep you safe, OK?

365
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,691
What more do you want from us?

366
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:21,332
All right. All right. All right.

367
00:19:21,987 --> 00:19:23,791
Have you guys eaten anybody?

368
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:28,313
- That's offensive.
- We don't have to listen to this.

369
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,851
That's offensive.

370
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:31,463
Well, I don't know.

371
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:51,001
How long you been there?

372
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:53,862
Um, well, we've been
here for a while, actually.

373
00:19:57,966 --> 00:19:59,742
It's not... weird.

374
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,483
- Those poor kids.
- I know.

375
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:04,462
The look on their faces.

376
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:09,041
So, how's everything
going with the place?

377
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:12,252
It's good.
It's coming along. It's shaping up.

378
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,231
- Yeah?
- You should come by.

379
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:15,593
Yeah, definitely. I will.

380
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,802
- Maybe Friday.
- Friday's good.

381
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:19,131
All right.

382
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:21,113
OK. I'm going to go back to work now.

383
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:22,752
- OK.
- I'll do it.

384
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:30,360
Not true what they say about blondes.

385
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:32,070
I think brunettes have all the fun.

386
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:34,190
Would you take that off?
You're freaking me out.

387
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,871
- What are you doing here?
- Just checking in, man.

388
00:20:36,997 --> 00:20:40,132
Just wanted to hear the latest
gossip on your little love triangle.

389
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:43,622
- Two-timing takes skill, you know.
- I'm not two-timing anybody.

390
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:46,871
I'm going to break it off with
Cady before anything happens with Andi.

391
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:50,002
Well, you just remember the
most important woman you're juggling.

392
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:51,500
You're on the clock, buddy.

393
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:54,252
You find that soul quickly,
or more women will die.

394
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:56,382
You don't want that
on your conscience, do you?

395
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:57,963
- Do you?
- No.

396
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:00,551
Get back to work.

397
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:18,033
Dude, where's Nikki?

398
00:21:18,597 --> 00:21:21,611
Angela writes here at night.
This is our best bet.

399
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:27,130
Benji, you got anything yet?

400
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:31,281
Negative. Nothing so far.

401
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:32,401
Damn it.

402
00:21:33,347 --> 00:21:36,380
Dude, it's been, like, 3 hours. You think
anything's going to happen tonight?

403
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,193
- I don't know.
- Stakeouts suck.

404
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:40,171
You can say that again.

405
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:42,563
New lesbian zombie flick
coming out Friday night.

406
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:44,130
- Want to go?
- Oh, I can't.

407
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:46,093
- Why not?
- Andi's coming over.

408
00:21:46,896 --> 00:21:48,680
- What?
- Nice!

409
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:50,512
Yes! Yes!

410
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:52,060
Andi asks you to jump her bones,

411
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,943
you just going to
go ahead and jump them?

412
00:21:54,068 --> 00:21:56,653
- Well... atta boy.
- I'm proud of you.

413
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,112
- Guys.
- Yeah?

414
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:00,793
- Bogey on radar.
- She's here.

415
00:22:00,915 --> 00:22:03,650
Get the bubbles. Get the bubbles.

416
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:22,461
Benji! Quick!

417
00:22:22,697 --> 00:22:23,633
Go!

418
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:46,502
Where did she go?

419
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,572
- Don't tell me we lost her.
- Let's check the lobby.

420
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,312
What in the world
happened in there, Sam?

421
00:22:57,436 --> 00:22:59,322
Didn't you ever blow
bubbles as a little kid?

422
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,163
- It's harder than it looks!
- Stop it.

423
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:03,442
There's no technique
to blowing a perfect bubble.

424
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:05,562
All you got to do is pucker up.

425
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:07,001
Anybody else hungry?

426
00:23:07,128 --> 00:23:10,622
I'm starving. I got a craving for
chili eese fries that just got insane.

427
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:13,191
No, I'm good. Drop me off at the condo.

428
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:21,502
All right.
I'll see you guys in a minute.

429
00:23:21,627 --> 00:23:23,940
OK. We'll bring you back some doggy bag,
all right?

430
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:25,063
All right.

431
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:28,072
Hi, Sam.

432
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,193
How'd you find me?

433
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:36,663
I've been waiting for us to be alone.

434
00:23:39,938 --> 00:23:42,342
Run all you want, baby.
Run all you want.

435
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:45,702
Sam.

436
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:48,493
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

437
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,132
That's right. Don't thank me.

438
00:24:44,437 --> 00:24:45,870
Of course. You swing both ways.

439
00:24:45,997 --> 00:24:48,011
Hey, at least I swing, baby.

440
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:49,690
I really need you to leave.

441
00:24:49,878 --> 00:24:52,062
And I need to give
you a friendly warning

442
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:54,572
about your 2 little demon neighbors.

443
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:57,991
They're small-minded,
stubborn, useless bureaucrats.

444
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,213
- Totally pathetic.
- Someone's extraordinarily bitter.

445
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:03,763
Well, you would be, too,
if you had to deal with them every day.

446
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:05,132
Don't go there, Sam.

447
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:08,060
- They're not worth your time.
- I got it covered. Don't worry about it.

448
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:10,413
You just keep your head in the game.

449
00:25:10,797 --> 00:25:12,302
Before somebody really gets hurt.

450
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:14,301
There's that pea-brain now.

451
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:19,680
- Steve. Hey.
- Sam.

452
00:25:20,957 --> 00:25:22,642
Ben told me I could find you here.

453
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:26,441
Look, can we sit down for a second?

454
00:25:30,248 --> 00:25:33,502
- I'm sorry about before.
- Not as sorry as I am, kiddo.

455
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:36,760
Billy, can I get a mangotini and a,
um, lager?

456
00:25:37,568 --> 00:25:38,442
I just...

457
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:40,610
I wanted to say thank you for...

458
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:44,980
- You saved my life.
- That's right. I did do that, didn't I?

459
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:48,661
- Well, I guess we all make mistakes.
- And I'm trying to apologize.

460
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:49,931
You're trying.

461
00:25:50,835 --> 00:25:52,731
You're not going to
make this easy, are you?

462
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,851
- Thank you, Billy.
- Look, I assumed that...

463
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:58,412
You assumed what, that Tony
and I were cat-eating knuckle draggers?

464
00:25:58,536 --> 00:26:01,682
- That's demophobic and it's racist.
- I'm not a racist.

465
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:04,032
No? Then you're just extremely rude.

466
00:26:04,227 --> 00:26:06,070
You know what? You're right.

467
00:26:06,286 --> 00:26:08,413
You're right.
We assumed the worst about you.

468
00:26:08,538 --> 00:26:10,683
Everybody does. They hear "demon,"

469
00:26:10,808 --> 00:26:14,060
And that was stupid.
That was an ignorant thing to do.

470
00:26:14,187 --> 00:26:15,350
We're sorry.

471
00:26:15,478 --> 00:26:18,821
From the bottom of our hearts,
we're really, really sorry.

472
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,853
You and Tony are great guys.
That's all that matters.

473
00:26:21,978 --> 00:26:24,040
Well, it's a very nice gesture, Sam,

474
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,792
but it's a little bit too little,
a little bit too late.

475
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:30,470
The Devil's right.
You demons are so stubborn.

476
00:26:30,596 --> 00:26:31,942
Wait, wait, wait.

477
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:34,630
- You've spoken to the Devil?
- Yeah.

478
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:37,112
I don't know why me.

479
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:39,721
He just shows up and wants to talk.

480
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:41,852
The Devil doesn't
just hang with anybody.

481
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,221
That's not his style.

482
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:44,793
You are special, Sammy.

483
00:26:44,915 --> 00:26:47,022
The question is, why are you so special?

484
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:50,682
Probably 'cause my parents
sold my soul to the Devil.

485
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,151
Yeah, yeah. I know.

486
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:55,752
No, I'm sorry. I don't mean to laugh.

487
00:26:56,097 --> 00:26:57,343
Tell you what...

488
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:58,661
Why are we fighting?

489
00:26:58,828 --> 00:27:00,372
Do you know why we're fighting?

490
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,410
Why are we fighting?
We should not be fighting.

491
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:04,220
- All right.
- I forgive you,

492
00:27:04,346 --> 00:27:06,723
and I will make sure
that Tony forgives you, too.

493
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:07,840
Thank you.

494
00:27:07,965 --> 00:27:10,633
- Where... where is Tony?
- He's swamped.

495
00:27:10,918 --> 00:27:14,422
He's doing publicity for this Seattle
style magazine party tomorrow night.

496
00:27:14,855 --> 00:27:16,551
Seattle style magazine party?

497
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,513
They throw this amazing
party every year.

498
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,842
It honors the 20 most
beautiful women in the city,

499
00:27:21,018 --> 00:27:23,311
so it's a lot of pretty girls.

500
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:25,852
You know...

501
00:27:26,157 --> 00:27:27,283
Now that...

502
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:30,652
We're... we're good... friends again...

503
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:33,040
You and Tony could do
me the hugest favor ever.

504
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:34,782
You do not waste any time, do you?

505
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:36,543
- I know. I know.
- What do you need?

506
00:27:36,665 --> 00:27:39,320
You think you could get
me and the guys into this party?

507
00:27:39,447 --> 00:27:41,793
Aren't you just the little heterosexual?

508
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:44,413
I'll tell you what I'm going to do...

509
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,981
I will talk to Tony,

510
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:48,252
and I will see if he can work his magic.

511
00:27:48,475 --> 00:27:49,923
Thank you so much.

512
00:27:50,665 --> 00:27:51,911
You're welcome.

513
00:27:52,095 --> 00:27:54,871
- OK.
- Attach L5, L4...

514
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:59,913
- This way.
- L2 to L1 and align the holes in your.

515
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,560
All right. Tonight at this party, we're
going to track down the soul, right,

516
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:06,563
and we're going to
blow her ass back to hell.

517
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:08,391
Tony should be here any minute.

518
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:11,791
And then, the hottest chicks in the city
are going to be at this party, right?

519
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,232
Dude, look at where we work.

520
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:14,852
I promise you it will be a step up.

521
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:17,372
- What's wrong with the...
- What up?

522
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,612
- Tone. Hey.
- OK.

523
00:28:19,736 --> 00:28:22,912
I am so sorry about everything, OK?
What happened before?

524
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,873
I apologize for my foolish,
foolish friends.

525
00:28:27,036 --> 00:28:28,533
Hey, we really missed you, man.

526
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:30,472
Well, Steve and I missed you guys, too.

527
00:28:30,596 --> 00:28:33,081
It's all water under the bridge.
I got you the tickets for tonight.

528
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,791
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, tonight?

529
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:39,410
Andi, this is Tony,
our neighbor at this condo.

530
00:28:39,537 --> 00:28:41,610
He's getting us into
this fashion party tonight.

531
00:28:41,737 --> 00:28:43,920
I am finally going to bag a model.

532
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:47,803
I thought we were
doing something tonight.

533
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:52,602
I feel like I let
the cat out of the bag.

534
00:28:52,728 --> 00:28:54,290
It was going to be a surprise,

535
00:28:54,418 --> 00:28:56,560
but Sam got you a ticket as well.

536
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,441
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah. I...

537
00:29:00,835 --> 00:29:03,792
It's a party for the 20
most beautiful women in the city,

538
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:07,562
but if we're all being honest,
they can't hold a candle to you.

539
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:09,593
Right, Sam?

540
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:15,012
Looks like it's going
to be one hell of a party.

541
00:29:28,345 --> 00:29:30,703
Oh, my god.

542
00:29:34,218 --> 00:29:37,230
I have never seen so many
beautiful women in my life.

543
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:40,983
I know. It's like bringing
a fat kid to a donut shop.

544
00:29:41,808 --> 00:29:43,910
OK, guys, eyes on the ball.
We got to find Nikki.

545
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:46,903
- Yeah. Where's Andi?
- She had to close up shop.

546
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:48,482
- She'll be here soon.
- OK.

547
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:50,453
- You have the vessel?
- Right here.

548
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:53,751
Sock! Focus.

549
00:29:54,635 --> 00:29:57,472
I'm sorry, Sam. I couldn't
help but notice that that poor

550
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,673
brazilian supermodel
isn't wearing any underwear.

551
00:29:59,835 --> 00:30:01,842
Please, woman. Show some respect.

552
00:30:01,965 --> 00:30:03,932
All right.
Listen, tonight, we have to find Nikki.

553
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:05,552
Nikki. Yeah. OK.

554
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:07,933
We find Angela,
Nikki's bound to be close by, OK?

555
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,093
All right.

556
00:30:09,217 --> 00:30:12,400
We're going to do a quick lap.
You wait here and look for Andi.

557
00:30:12,526 --> 00:30:16,150
- 'Cause you guys are looking for Nikki!
- Nikki. Yeah, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki.

558
00:30:33,658 --> 00:30:35,833
- You look... you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

559
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:39,790
- You look great, too.
- Thank you.

560
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:43,883
Um, do you want to get a real drink?

561
00:30:44,168 --> 00:30:46,133
- Yeah. Yeah.
- OK. Great.

562
00:30:50,177 --> 00:30:52,783
Ladies. Hey, how you doing?

563
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:58,540
Oh, wow. Hey. I just wanted...

564
00:31:01,846 --> 00:31:04,850
Hey, how the hell do
you talk to these girls?

565
00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:07,033
How do I talk to these girls?

566
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:12,390
Here's Angela right there, OK?

567
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:13,971
Stand up straight. You look good.

568
00:31:14,096 --> 00:31:16,082
- Watch and learn.
- All right.

569
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:18,253
Hi, there. How you doing?

570
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:22,443
I was wondering if you believe in
astrology, because I actually read palms.

571
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:23,712
Oh, yeah?

572
00:31:24,645 --> 00:31:26,603
- Prove it.
- OK. I will.

573
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:29,643
Bye, hot lady friend. OK, listen.

574
00:31:29,808 --> 00:31:31,973
This one right here, this long one?

575
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,482
That's your life line.
And it looks to me...

576
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:37,572
Yeah, it looks like you are going
to lead a very long and fruitful life,

577
00:31:37,697 --> 00:31:39,562
- so that's good, right?
- That's good.

578
00:31:39,726 --> 00:31:40,662
It's very good.

579
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:42,832
This one right here, this... oh.

580
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,023
That is actually concerning me a little.

581
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:47,471
I don't know if I should
tell you what this one means.

582
00:31:47,596 --> 00:31:48,700
What? What? Tell me.

583
00:31:49,637 --> 00:31:51,662
OK. This one means that, um...

584
00:31:52,295 --> 00:31:53,912
You're gonna be my baby mama...

585
00:31:55,978 --> 00:31:58,000
Benji, take notes if you wanna,...

586
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,980
- Smooth.
- Come on. Grab the champers.

587
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:05,221
Let's go.

588
00:32:05,345 --> 00:32:08,303
- Hey, I'm sorry that I was so late.
- Oh, whatever. You're here now.

589
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:12,652
So...

590
00:32:13,728 --> 00:32:15,600
Lot of beautiful women here tonight.

591
00:32:17,388 --> 00:32:18,691
No one as pretty as you.

592
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:23,110
I'm really glad you came tonight.

593
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:24,723
Me, too.

594
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:46,853
You know, I'm not going to pick this up.

595
00:32:46,976 --> 00:32:48,922
No. No. That's OK. You should.

596
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,091
Hello? Cady. I'm glad you called.

597
00:32:56,216 --> 00:32:58,913
I've been trying to reach you for days.
Where have you been?

598
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:01,703
Listen, uh,
Cady, we really need to talk.

599
00:33:03,016 --> 00:33:05,141
I can't right now.

600
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:11,443
Cady, I gotta go.

601
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:16,112
Sock! Ben! Let's go!
Nikki's going after Andi! Go, go, go!

602
00:33:33,396 --> 00:33:34,861
You the valet?

603
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:37,151
Thank you. Thank you.

604
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:39,941
Here you go.

605
00:33:42,636 --> 00:33:44,572
Come on! Let's go, let's go.

606
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:50,960
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

607
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:55,542
Are you OK? Your hand's bleeding.

608
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:56,552
Andi!

609
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:01,751
- What the hell is going on?
- Come on! Go!

610
00:34:02,016 --> 00:34:02,790
Jeez!

611
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:07,142
Go, go, go!

612
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,073
- Sam!|- Hold on!

613
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:21,141
Sam, who the hell is that?

614
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,022
Oh my god!

615
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:41,992
This is new.

616
00:34:43,537 --> 00:34:47,143
Up until now,
I've only burned pretty people like me.

617
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:49,993
You take a look in the mirror lately?

618
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:04,981
Say goodnight, bitch.

619
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:23,870
It's going to be OK, man.

620
00:35:24,036 --> 00:35:26,210
- Yeah, what if she's not?
- Are you kidding me?

621
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:28,711
That's Andi we're talking about.
She's like superman,

622
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:29,843
the girl version.

623
00:35:29,965 --> 00:35:31,711
If I hadn't picked
up that call from Cady,

624
00:35:31,836 --> 00:35:33,643
I could have stopped this.
This is my fault.

625
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:35,613
- It's not your fault, Sam.
- Of course it is!

626
00:35:35,738 --> 00:35:37,240
I'm always putting you 2 in danger,

627
00:35:37,366 --> 00:35:39,321
- and now, I'm doing it to Andi.
- Listen to me.

628
00:35:39,447 --> 00:35:41,501
I do not want to hear any of this,
"I'm the reaper,

629
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,613
"I put my friends in
danger" bologna right now, OK?

630
00:35:43,736 --> 00:35:45,101
We're in this together. Unity.

631
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:47,241
We know what the risks are.
We know what's involved,

632
00:35:47,368 --> 00:35:49,721
and we got your back, bro. All right?

633
00:35:51,396 --> 00:35:52,481
You guys are good.

634
00:35:53,997 --> 00:35:54,860
Thank you.

635
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:05,133
Hey, nice job on
catching that soul, kid.

636
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:06,583
I knew you had it in you.

637
00:36:06,858 --> 00:36:08,960
Oh, by the way,
I took care of that stolen car thing.

638
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,750
Turns out that that valet
guy was running a chop shop.

639
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:13,850
Who knew, huh?

640
00:36:14,096 --> 00:36:16,171
I'm trying to get a refill on my xanax.

641
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:19,022
Think I can slip it through the system?

642
00:36:19,147 --> 00:36:22,701
Look, we got to talk about
this whole collateral damage thing.

643
00:36:23,116 --> 00:36:24,592
Yeah? What about it?

644
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,771
Sock, Ben...
they know they put their lives at risk

645
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:28,941
when they help me out, but Andi?

646
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:32,332
- She almost died last night.
- Well, get used to it, kiddo.

647
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,801
The people you care for are fair game.

648
00:36:35,395 --> 00:36:37,643
No. Not Andi. I have to protect her.

649
00:36:38,087 --> 00:36:40,521
Oh, will you stop with
all the lovey-dovey crap?

650
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:42,531
Just take what you can get in life.

651
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:44,271
Love 'em and leave 'em.

652
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:45,840
No strings attached.

653
00:36:45,968 --> 00:36:48,270
- Shouldn't be like that.
- Oh, come on.

654
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:51,962
A lifetime of meaningless,
cheap one-night stands won't be so bad.

655
00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:55,091
Who knows? In time, you may
learn to enjoy yourself,

656
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:56,593
like moi.

657
00:37:03,176 --> 00:37:06,090
By the power of zeus, she lives!

658
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:07,601
How you feeling, Andi?

659
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:09,681
A little hazy, but...

660
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,743
- Yeah. Concussion.
- Yeah.

661
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:14,773
- Hey, did the doctors x-ray you?
- Good.

662
00:37:15,937 --> 00:37:18,590
'Cause I have a theory about radiation.

663
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:21,030
If you're exposed to
enough in your lifetime,

664
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:24,112
you have a greater chance
of developing cool mutant powers.

665
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,623
Thing is, I don't really
think I want mutant powers, Sock.

666
00:37:26,885 --> 00:37:29,872
- Well, we're just glad you're OK.
- Yeah. Me, too.

667
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:34,133
Hey, why don't we go and, uh, 

668
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:35,922
scope out some candy stripers.

669
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,213
Childhood fantasy of mine.

670
00:37:48,336 --> 00:37:49,642
Who was that last night?

671
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,401
What are you talking about?

672
00:37:52,525 --> 00:37:54,972
- It was a car accident.
- No, no, no.

673
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:57,323
That woman, that thing.

674
00:37:58,398 --> 00:38:01,592
- You have a concussion.
- I know what I saw.

675
00:38:04,397 --> 00:38:07,140
You need some rest, OK?
I'll come back later.

676
00:38:10,135 --> 00:38:11,660
Thanks for saving my life.

677
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:16,480
No, Andi, I didn't save your life.

678
00:38:18,955 --> 00:38:20,602
I almost got you killed.

679
00:38:21,187 --> 00:38:22,040
No.

680
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:24,421
Look.

681
00:38:26,648 --> 00:38:28,193
There's things that...

682
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:30,553
I won't ever be able to tell you.

683
00:38:32,028 --> 00:38:35,271
Losing you is a risk I'm
not willing to take. I'm sorry.

684
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:45,902
Hey, good boy, Sammy.

685
00:38:46,027 --> 00:38:48,072
My heart's bursting with pride.

686
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:50,181
Want to go to a strip club?

687
00:38:50,556 --> 00:38:52,831
I know one with a great free buffet.

688
00:39:04,965 --> 00:39:05,760
Sam.

689
00:39:06,105 --> 00:39:06,841
Hey.

690
00:39:07,308 --> 00:39:08,180
Are you OK?

691
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:10,283
Oh. Uh, yeah, Yeah.

692
00:39:11,027 --> 00:39:12,643
Probably shouldn't talk about it.

693
00:39:12,765 --> 00:39:15,031
Well, I heard you walking by...

694
00:39:15,685 --> 00:39:16,660
Demon ears.

695
00:39:17,276 --> 00:39:19,481
- Got a minute?
- Yeah. What's up?

696
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,703
Come inside.

697
00:39:28,276 --> 00:39:29,272
Sam.

698
00:39:30,147 --> 00:39:32,701
I need to talk to you in private.

699
00:39:37,396 --> 00:39:38,532
Come on in.

700
00:39:45,185 --> 00:39:47,002
What is this place?

701
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:49,323
Have a seat.

702
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:59,651
This? This is a place
where we can talk openly,

703
00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:04,032
where anything we say stays between us.

704
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:07,772
Nobody on Earth can
hear us in here, Sam.

705
00:40:07,895 --> 00:40:09,041
Or spy on us.

706
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:11,950
Not even him.

707
00:40:13,806 --> 00:40:14,702
The Devil.

708
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:18,683
Sam.

709
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,860
I've seen a lot of
bounty hunters in my day.

710
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:24,142
Truth is,

711
00:40:25,897 --> 00:40:27,241
you're different.

712
00:40:28,896 --> 00:40:31,822
- Different how?
- The Devil talks to you, Sam.

713
00:40:34,855 --> 00:40:36,591
You have any idea how weird that is...

714
00:40:36,718 --> 00:40:40,300
The Prince of Darkness to
sustain a friendship with a reaper?

715
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,651
He finds you fascinating, Sam.

716
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:45,721
He opens up to you.

717
00:40:48,205 --> 00:40:50,650
All of us have our
reasons to fight the Devil.

718
00:40:52,197 --> 00:40:54,773
Tony and I, we have our reasons.

719
00:40:57,396 --> 00:40:58,750
And you have yours.

720
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,303
Thanks to Raceman for the transcript.
