1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,833
- Someone need my help outside?
- Oh, young man?

2
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:09,753
Could I trouble you to
carry this to my car?

3
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:14,072
Heavy.

4
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:20,010
- Ok, so this is the vessel?
- That's a toolbox.

5
00:00:20,337 --> 00:00:21,569
And it's for you.

6
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:24,408
Why do I need a toolbox?

7
00:00:25,303 --> 00:00:27,639
I need you to go
handle some plumbing.

8
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,696
What, so now I'm your handyman?
That's not part of the deal.

9
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:33,487
Actually, it is.
I own you, Sam.

10
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:35,420
If I ask you to take
out the garbage in hell,

11
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:36,786
that's what you'll do.

12
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:39,075
- Right.
- Don't fret.

13
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,357
This job won't be so bad.

14
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:43,293
Promise.

15
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:00,920
Am I glad to see you. I'm Mimi.

16
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:02,660
Sorry about the get-up.

17
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:10,143
So what happened here?

18
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,393
Ok, I know this sounds weird,

19
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:14,603
but my washing
machine is broken,

20
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:16,883
and I needed some clean clothes,
so I

21
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:19,362
sort of tried to use
the dishwasher instead.

22
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:22,072
Yeah, I never would
have thought of that.

23
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:23,803
I mean, it's all soap, right?

24
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:27,950
The thing is,
some of the laundry items

25
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,821
got stuck in the spinny
thing in the bottom,

26
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,653
and the whole thing
just died on me.

27
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,083
Wait.

28
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:35,143
This is the embarrassing part.

29
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:38,520
The articles in question
are of an intimate nature.

30
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:43,701
Yeah, I don't know if I'll
be able to get these out.

31
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:46,491
I think I might have to--
cut them out of here.

32
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:50,180
Oh! I really wish you wouldn't.
They were a present.

33
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:53,223
Uh, ok, I'll--
let me see what I can do.

34
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,693
Just out of curiosity, how...

35
00:01:58,048 --> 00:02:00,042
how were you referred
to the Work Bench?

36
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,833
Oh, my boyfriend handles
all the household stuff.

37
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:04,051
Jerry.

38
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:07,272
He loves to take care of me.

39
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,380
This is from our trip to Cabo.

40
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:11,321
He's handsome, isn't he?

41
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:13,043
Yeah, he...

42
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:18,090
He--he's a fine looking man.

43
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:27,750
Season 1, Episode 9 - Ashes to Ashes
For www.forom.com

44
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:34,460
Are you serious?

45
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:37,043
The devil has a
mistress named Mimi?

46
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:40,800
I mean, does she have any idea
that her boyfriend's the devil?

47
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:42,143
None. He's Jerry.

48
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,851
They went to an all-inclusive
resort in Cabo last spring.

49
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:47,402
- Unlimited pina coladas.
- I love it. I love it. You know,

50
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:49,792
if I was the dark lord,
I would do the exact same thing,

51
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:52,473
I'd have a mistress in every
continent of the planet.

52
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:54,423
- He probably does.
- He probably does, doesn't he?

53
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:56,291
God, he's living the dream.

54
00:02:56,405 --> 00:02:58,101
I wanna be the
prince of darkness.

55
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:00,200
No, no. What's below prince?

56
00:03:00,537 --> 00:03:02,043
- Uh, duke.
- The duke.

57
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,330
I wanna be the
duke of darkness.

58
00:03:04,597 --> 00:03:06,402
Maybe could you
talk to him for me?

59
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,882
- Set up a little internship or...
- No.

60
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,632
- Not even a chance?
- No.

61
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:12,783
Hey, have you
talked to her yet?

62
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:17,180
No, not since I tried to
give her the necklace.

63
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:19,552
So you don't know
where you're at.

64
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:21,091
Not a clue.

65
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,840
Incoming. Incoming.

66
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:29,573
You guys must have done
something enormously horrendous

67
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,980
- to get food cart duty.
- Oh, yeah.

68
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:34,911
Some idiot posted a
picture and profile of Ted

69
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:37,551
on a bi-curious website.
He totally blamed us.

70
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:39,180
- You do it?
- Of course.

71
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,441
Nice.

72
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:42,983
Can you actually cover
my shift tomorrow?

73
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:44,881
I have this family
dinner thing.

74
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,480
Yeah. Yeah, I could do that.

75
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:48,511
Great. You're a
life saver. Thanks.

76
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,610
You see that?

77
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,941
She's just acting like
everything's normal.

78
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:56,273
Maybe it's not as big
of a deal as you think.

79
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:58,343
Ben, last time I talked to her,
I made her cry.

80
00:03:58,378 --> 00:03:59,611
Tears, ok?

81
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:01,703
Now it's like nothing
even happened.

82
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:03,971
You know what?
I know what she's doing.

83
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:06,641
She's acting like a dude.

84
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,431
- No, no.
- Yes, yes.

85
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:10,273
And that is awesome.
She's acting like a dude.

86
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:12,221
You know,
anything gets too emotional or too hard,

87
00:04:12,258 --> 00:04:14,581
you just ignore it, right?
Eventually it'll just go away.

88
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:17,553
Which makes Andi even more perfect,
if that's possible.

89
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:20,360
Except for the part where she

90
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,451
ripped your heart out
and stomped on it.

91
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,562
That was rude and lame.

92
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:26,583
I--I can't ignore it.

93
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,541
I--I have to talk to her.

94
00:04:28,597 --> 00:04:30,742
Well, it's pretty obvious
she doesn't want to talk Sam.

95
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:32,440
Well, what else am I gonna do,

96
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,861
wait till she wants to discuss things?
I don't...

97
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,942
Wait, I get it.
I know what you're doing.

98
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:39,492
- You're acting like a chick.
- Shut--shut up!

99
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,990
No, no. I will not shut up.

100
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:42,470
You are acting like a chick,

101
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:45,821
and she is acting like a dude.
That is so sad, Sam.

102
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:48,981
I don't know whether to hug
you or kill you out of mercy.

103
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:04,621
Son of a bitch. Very funny!
I know it's you!

104
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:09,393
You're not gonna scare me,
so you can just let me out!

105
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:14,221
I'm glad you don't scare easy.

106
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:20,120
Why do you have to do that?

107
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:21,873
Well, it's kind
of in my nature.

108
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:25,221
You know,
supreme spirit of evil and all that?

109
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,700
Yeah, kind of like your
nature to be an "a" hole?

110
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,573
Oh, that's beneath you, Sam.

111
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:31,450
You know names hurt.

112
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:34,260
Yeah, well,
I've got another name for you, Jerry.

113
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:36,342
Doesn't ring a bell.

114
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:38,492
What is your deal with Mimi?

115
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,910
Does she have any idea
what you really are?

116
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:43,660
Sam, I'm not interested
in talking about her.

117
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:45,883
And don't bring it up again.

118
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:48,732
We're here for this.

119
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:51,681
That's your soul,
Dennis Grayson.

120
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:54,550
He ran this very funeral
home 10 years ago.

121
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:56,751
He had a very
interesting way of, um,

122
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:58,921
picking up extra cash.

123
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:01,401
- He sold body parts?
- Yeah.

124
00:06:01,686 --> 00:06:04,233
People would bring their
loved ones to be cremated.

125
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:05,922
Before he'd fire up the ovens,

126
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:08,371
he'd pick them over like
a Thanksgiving turkey.

127
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:11,472
Anyway, he's back now.

128
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,011
In a way.

129
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:14,623
What way?

130
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:17,760
Well, call it a ghost,
or a spirit.

131
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:21,402
He incinerated his earthly form,
so you can't see him.

132
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:23,402
But he'll still be
a pain in your ass.

133
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:28,023
Great.

134
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:38,363
What's all this?

135
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:41,750
Oh, I...

136
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:46,441
I enjoy spending
time with these, um,

137
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:49,051
- ceremonies.
- Right.

138
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:51,623
Yes. People start
asking questions--

139
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:53,432
"Why would god do this?

140
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:55,710
Is there even a god?"

141
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:59,970
I like to be here to try
and provide some answers.

142
00:07:02,486 --> 00:07:06,480
Here's a list of the
people the soul is after.

143
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:08,870
I'd concentrate on this one.

144
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:10,446
Sarah Negly.

145
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:12,845
You find her,
you find the soul.

146
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:14,827
This is a priority, Sam.

147
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:17,133
Quicker you find him,
the better.

148
00:07:23,185 --> 00:07:25,411
Oh, it's Mimi.

149
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:27,260
You'd better get
over there first.

150
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,593
The washer's still a mess.

151
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:37,920
How--how'd you meet Jerry?

152
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:40,423
Oh, uh, at an art show.

153
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:42,813
He just swept me off my feet.

154
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,552
Always knew the
right thing to say.

155
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:46,361
Had this old world charm.

156
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:47,643
He's a real gentlemen.

157
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,550
That's a rarity these days.

158
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:53,993
That might be him.
He said he might call.

159
00:07:58,057 --> 00:07:59,220
Hello?

160
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:01,902
No, I don't want the newspaper.

161
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:03,910
No, no, thank you.

162
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:12,031
That, uh, that wasn't him.

163
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:13,563
Right.

164
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:16,902
I'm--I'm sure he'll call back.

165
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,753
He's a really busy guy.

166
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,202
So you--
you know Jerry personally?

167
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:25,841
Oh, a little. Very little.

168
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:28,522
I--I've worked with
him time to time.

169
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:29,783
Odd jobs.

170
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:32,442
- What can you tell me about him?
- I don't really--

171
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:34,002
Does he talk about his work?

172
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:35,562
I mean,
he told me he's an importer,

173
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:37,680
but he's so secretive
about his job.

174
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:40,062
I--I think he works
for the government.

175
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,511
Oh, that's--that's an
interesting thing.

176
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:45,501
Maybe--I don't know.

177
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:47,630
You know more than
I would even know.

178
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,863
Please...

179
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:51,092
You're my only window
into his world.

180
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:53,692
Any little thing you could give me,
I'd appreciate.

181
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:57,350
- Oh, all right. Whatever.
- Ok, thank you.

182
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:01,791
Oh, and I promise,
I won't tell him we talked.

183
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:03,642
He would kill us.

184
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,722
Yeah, right, he would. That's--

185
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,923
That's a funny
thing to joke about.

186
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:09,730
Killing.

187
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:14,862
I'm officially a dick.

188
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:17,892
I just spent half the night
telling Mimi how great Jerry is.

189
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,382
Why would you do that?

190
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:21,631
I don't know.
I just felt sorry for her.

191
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:23,382
You know,
she wanted to know all about him,

192
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,271
and I couldn't bring myself
to tell her he's the--

193
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,020
Unholy spirit,
the poison of god,

194
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:29,111
the despicableness
of the earth.

195
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,283
Yeah. Yeah, that.

196
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:33,393
She's just sad and lonely.

197
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:37,101
Oh, man. The devil and I have
the exact same taste in women.

198
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,252
Is she really flexible, too?

199
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,563
Let's just do this.

200
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:53,491
That's good, actually.
I could use a little blow-out.

201
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:54,840
No, Bert.

202
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:57,632
Unless you want to spend eternity
trapped inside that thing.

203
00:09:57,668 --> 00:09:59,322
I think I'm looking
pretty good today.

204
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:01,653
All right.
The devil said we find Sarah Negly,

205
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:03,351
we find the soul.

206
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:10,923
Hey, guys, why don't we,
go out the back door?

207
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:12,232
What?

208
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:14,121
Ted might see us.

209
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,712
Ted's at a linoleum conference.

210
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:17,011
Benny!

211
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:21,431
Hey, grandma.

212
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:27,822
You're Ben's grandmother.

213
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:30,203
I cannot believe that
we haven't met yet.

214
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:31,631
I am Sock.

215
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:33,242
Comprende?

216
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:35,481
- She speaks english.
- Bueno.

217
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:37,802
I'm Sam.
I'm friends with your grandson.

218
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:41,210
Ben.

219
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:45,663
So...

220
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:48,772
That is quite the cart 'o
party supplies you got there.

221
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:50,510
Throwin' a little
triple kegger?

222
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:52,523
Break out the old booze luge?
Suckin' back?

223
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:53,982
Uh, it's just for
a family party.

224
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:55,662
Nothing huge,
very tiny. Grandma,

225
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:57,271
this is my family
discount card.

226
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:58,781
Me and the guys gotta run,

227
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,881
but I will be by later
to come help you.

228
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,161
Yes, grandma, I will be by
later to come help you later.

229
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,790
We are out of here, ok?
Ok, bye.

230
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:06,300
Come on, guys, let's go.

231
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:09,072
- It was nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you grandma.

232
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:11,781
Oh, god.

233
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:14,703
Dude, your family has
no idea who we are.

234
00:11:14,737 --> 00:11:15,973
It just never came up.

235
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:17,841
But now you're
having a big party

236
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:19,911
with all your friends and
family coming from all over?

237
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,283
I didn't think
you wanted to go.

238
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:22,682
I mean,
it's gonna be pretty boring.

239
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:24,403
Right, yeah,
because we hate parties, right?

240
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:25,630
We hate music and booze.

241
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:26,850
We hate orgies.

242
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:28,493
Yeah, and what's with
your grandmother staring

243
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:30,511
- like she wants to kill me?
- Yeah.

244
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:33,420
Ok, look.

245
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:37,601
A lot of people in my family
believe my grandmother has...

246
00:11:38,618 --> 00:11:40,032
the eye.

247
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:45,302
She says she can predict the
future and see evil spirits.

248
00:11:46,136 --> 00:11:48,232
Really? Nice.

249
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,633
Granny knows you're
BFF's with satan.

250
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:52,602
Don't take it personally.

251
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:56,032
No, no,
why would I ever take it personally?

252
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,122
So the eye, huh?

253
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:03,481
I like it, I like.
It's like some kick ass superhero.

254
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:05,521
Benny's grandmother is the eye!

255
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:07,882
I can't believe we've
never met your family.

256
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:09,481
- What is up with that?
- Like I said,

257
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:11,042
it just never happened.

258
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:13,361
Listen, Benny,
you don't have to be embarrassed

259
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:16,712
of your grandmother.
We all have crazies in our families.

260
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:19,721
Excuse me, but I'm not ashamed
of my family in any way, ok?

261
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,903
They're not the ones
that embarrass me.

262
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:24,182
And what are you embarrassed by,
Ben, huh?

263
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:27,060
Oh, my god. Can you believe
I pulled that out of my head?

264
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:29,430
Wait a second.
Are you ashamed of Sock?

265
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:33,733
- Half right.
- Holy crap.

266
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:36,413
You're--you're ashamed of us?

267
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:40,060
Yes?

268
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:42,751
We were looking
for a Sarah Negly.

269
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:44,350
My mother?

270
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,482
She died a few years ago.

271
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:48,123
Are you sure?

272
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,830
Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

273
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:57,710
I'm sorry,
was your mother cremated by any chance?

274
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,242
I mean,
that's her urn on the mantle.

275
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:04,490
- If that's all...
- Wait!

276
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:06,852
Have you heard of
a Dennis Grayson?

277
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,221
He's the son of a bitch

278
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:10,203
who cut up and sold
pieces of her body.

279
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:12,892
- Get out of here.
- Who do you think you are?!

280
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:16,683
What the hell was that?

281
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:18,332
I don't know.
An earthquake or something?

282
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:19,470
What's happening?

283
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:20,970
Sir, you might want
to come with us.

284
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,813
What for?

285
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:27,413
Oh, god!

286
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:34,732
Open the door.

287
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:38,182
Come on!

288
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:41,633
Sam!

289
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,083
Oh, my god.

290
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:48,893
Sam, we have to get in there!

291
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,971
Mr. Negly?

292
00:13:54,348 --> 00:13:55,450
Mr. Negly?

293
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:16,272
Now we know how the
ghost soul kills people.

294
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:18,720
It needs the ashes of the
dead to make itself a body.

295
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,692
I can't believe how
it killed Mr. Negly.

296
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:21,920
I don't know what to do.

297
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,643
The devil's making
this impossible.

298
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:25,690
Come on, Sam. You gotta step
back from this, all right?

299
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:27,533
Step back from what?

300
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,421
- Whining like a little school girl.
- Enough with that already!

301
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:32,871
No, Sam, it's not enough.
Not until you change, all right?

302
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:34,681
You need to channel
all this negativity

303
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:36,643
into some positive-ity.

304
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:38,903
- I'm serious, man!
- And do what?

305
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:41,861
I don't know.
Ask Andi out again.

306
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,862
Ok, she doesn't want
to go out with me.

307
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:47,303
You need to ask her out,
and when she says no,

308
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:50,261
you have to ask her out again,
and again and again.

309
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:52,842
All right? You need to be persistent,
like the ocean,

310
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:55,201
little waves of Sam crashing
on the soars of Andi

311
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:56,791
until she gradually wears down.

312
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:58,452
Or she gets a
restraining order.

313
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:01,773
Ah, stop it!
Stop with the negative energy, ok?

314
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:03,943
You're bummin' me out.
You know what?

315
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:05,040
You need to go to her.

316
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:07,602
You need to ask her out right now.
Ask her out.

317
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:09,272
Come on. You have the power.

318
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:12,811
The positive energy,
fill your heart, body and soul.

319
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:15,071
No, loins. Go to her.

320
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,870
Go, and show her the
power of your joy.

321
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:20,802
Go, Sam.

322
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:23,301
Come back to me a hero.

323
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:31,310
Hey, Andi.

324
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,953
- How's it going?
- Good.

325
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:34,752
Liking those new pricing guns?

326
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:36,031
Yeah, they're great, huh?

327
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:38,312
Hey, you want to go to
a movie this weekend?

328
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:40,293
You know what?
I can't do this weekend.

329
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,271
No problem. Next weekend?

330
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,812
- I don't think so.
- No problem.

331
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,742
Another time.
You just let me know.

332
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:48,743
I'll be here.

333
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:50,513
- Ok.
- Ok.

334
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:57,713
- Hey...
- Hey.

335
00:15:58,487 --> 00:16:01,130
I think it's cool that you're
a guy about everything,

336
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,370
but maybe you don't
want to do that.

337
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:06,542
What are you talking about,
I'm a guy. What?

338
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:09,063
I just think maybe you
might want to figure out

339
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:10,763
what you're doing with him.

340
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,632
I mean, he's just waiting
for you to make a move, Andi.

341
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,462
I mean, one way or another.

342
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:18,751
I know, I know.

343
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:20,923
But, Ben,
this is just really complicated, ok?

344
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:22,751
It's been so frustrating.
I honestly

345
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:24,562
don't know what to do.

346
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:27,033
Well, does he still
have a chance with you?

347
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,111
Maybe.

348
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:33,001
Maybe is all I
can say right now.

349
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:36,281
Ok. Maybe's better
than no, right?

350
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:48,572
- All right, Ben, bring it back.
- Wait--wait! Ow.

351
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,122
Damate carpet.

352
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:53,442
Yeah, I checked the
names on this list.

353
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:55,613
These are the people
Grayson cremated.

354
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:58,380
Yeah, right after he sold the
kidneys on the black market.

355
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,162
Yeah, the family sued
when they found out.

356
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:02,041
He lost the business,
killed himself.

357
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,912
Now he's back to
settle the score.

358
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:05,451
Let me see.

359
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,573
There's so many
names on this list.

360
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:11,050
I mean,
how do we know who he'll go after next?

361
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:12,892
I don't think we can.

362
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:15,542
If we don't collect
all the ashes,

363
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:17,930
the families of all
these people will die.

364
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,661
- That's impossible.
- No, no.

365
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,511
No, nothing is impossible.

366
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:27,023
Illegal, yeah, stupid,

367
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:29,551
most definitely,
but not impossible.

368
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:35,843
Melissa Lambon?

369
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:39,163
The Work Bench is
about to make your day.

370
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:43,623
I don't remember
entering any contest.

371
00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:45,213
No, no, no. You know what?

372
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,083
All I know is your name
was on our invoice.

373
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:49,601
I won't tell if
you don't. Deal?

374
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,143
- Deal.
- Ok.

375
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:53,200
- Ok.
- I like you.

376
00:17:53,628 --> 00:17:55,622
- That's nice.
- Husband's ashes, 9 o'clock.

377
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,862
- Found it.
- All right,

378
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,923
your free prize is carpet.

379
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:00,533
You may choose

380
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:02,950
a style and color from
any of these samples.

381
00:18:02,988 --> 00:18:04,473
They're all so lovely.

382
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:07,143
I--whoa, check-- Ha, check--

383
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:08,832
Oh, I almost
dropped it. Check--

384
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:11,121
Check this one out.
Take a check out.

385
00:18:11,475 --> 00:18:13,763
That would look really
nice in my bedroom.

386
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:14,822
Just keep going.

387
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:58,241
Yeah, I feel like the weirdest

388
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,383
drug dealer of all time.

389
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,623
Think you can snort this stuff?

390
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,030
Pretty solid day.
We got a lot of work done.

391
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,381
Yeah. We also
promised to install

392
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:08,823
about $30,000
worth of carpeting.

393
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:10,643
Yeah, they'll probably forget.

394
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,153
So what now, boys?

395
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:14,703
Mom's still in Vegas,
I got the car for another 2 days.

396
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,080
What say we pour a bottle
of tequila in my face?

397
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:20,182
Nah, I can't.
I gotta go and help my family...

398
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:23,153
- Do stuff.
- Oh, right.

399
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:24,762
Secret family reunion.

400
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,390
Yeah, have fun at
that big party

401
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:27,920
without your friends
who embarrass you.

402
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,270
You guys don't understand,
all right?

403
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:32,122
It's a matter of survival.
My grandmother's unforgiving.

404
00:19:32,377 --> 00:19:34,170
Why do you care what
she has to say?

405
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:35,983
She's the matriarch, all right?

406
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:37,961
I mean, she rules the roost.

407
00:19:38,226 --> 00:19:40,132
I mean,
to her I'm a huge disappointment.

408
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,763
I'm the black sheep
of the family.

409
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:43,243
She wanted me to be a priest!

410
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:44,870
Instead, I'm making
minimum wage

411
00:19:45,027 --> 00:19:46,642
at a home improvement store.

412
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:48,713
- Why is that our fault?
- It's not your fault.

413
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:50,203
But what I'm saying is,

414
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,123
is if you guys go to the party
and anything goes wrong--

415
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:54,263
What?!

416
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:56,413
I could get booted out
of the house completely.

417
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,840
You know,
my uncle Hector got drunk at a wedding.

418
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:01,671
Grandmother just doesn't let
anyone talk to him anymore.

419
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:05,062
- Where's uncle Hector now?
- He lives in the house.

420
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:06,612
No one can talk to him.

421
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:08,432
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

422
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:10,360
All right, all right, yeah,
we won't go to your party!

423
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:11,911
We will not go to the party.
All right?

424
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:13,840
Thank you. Thank you.

425
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:15,273
No hard feelings, right?

426
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:16,340
- No.
- No.

427
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:17,653
- All right, great.
- Take you home.

428
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:19,091
But just out of curiosity,

429
00:20:19,146 --> 00:20:21,083
Sock embarrasses you
more than me, right?

430
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:22,811
- Absolutely.
- Damn skippy.

431
00:20:23,185 --> 00:20:24,531
I win.

432
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,073
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem, buddy.

433
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:35,300
He listen. Pop the trunk.
I need to get the ashes inside.

434
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:37,033
No, no, don't worry,
don't worry.

435
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:39,141
I'll get them properly and
respectfully stored, ok?

436
00:20:39,178 --> 00:20:41,733
- Get some rest.
- All right. Just take this--

437
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:55,633
Jeez, what are you doing here?

438
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:57,693
No, what are you doing, Sam?

439
00:20:57,995 --> 00:20:59,671
Did I tell you to
desecrate remains,

440
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:01,583
or did I tell you
to capture a soul?

441
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:03,371
We're not desecrating anything.

442
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:04,563
If we don't collect the ashes,

443
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:06,020
all those families will die.

444
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:07,240
Oh, brother.

445
00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:09,342
What are you, a boy scout now?

446
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:11,472
Just find the guy
and put him away.

447
00:21:11,758 --> 00:21:13,982
It would help if we knew where
he was going to strike next.

448
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:15,450
I gave you a list.

449
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:17,680
What, do I have to
draw you a map, too?

450
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:20,030
Maybe I should change your
diaper while I'm at it.

451
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:21,460
Baby want a ba-ba?

452
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:23,931
What is your problem?
I am busting my ass here.

453
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:25,711
You stop worrying
about the living.

454
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:27,590
Start concentrating
on the dead, Sam.

455
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:29,272
- I mean it.
- Fine. Are we done?

456
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,463
No.

457
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:32,322
I'm getting messages from Mimi.

458
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:34,292
Strange, demanding messages.

459
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:36,003
That's never happened before.

460
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:38,041
Now, exactly what are
you saying to her?

461
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:39,752
Nothing.

462
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:41,400
But all that woman ever does

463
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:43,012
is talk about how
awesome you are.

464
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:44,940
She just waits around
for you to call.

465
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,173
Well, she's free to spend
her time however she chooses.

466
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:49,781
I made no promises.

467
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:53,383
- My conscience is clear.
- You don't have a conscience.

468
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:55,451
Oh, yeah, that's right.
What a break.

469
00:21:55,737 --> 00:21:57,481
She's put her life
on hold for you.

470
00:21:57,868 --> 00:21:59,211
You should let her go.

471
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:00,921
You should stay out of things

472
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,660
that you know nothing about.

473
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:06,190
Do your job,
and keep your mouth shut.

474
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:08,263
Or I'll shut it for you.

475
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:28,641
Hey, Sam.

476
00:22:28,985 --> 00:22:31,171
That's nice. Who's it for?

477
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:33,243
Andi.

478
00:22:33,547 --> 00:22:36,140
So you're finally
making your move, huh?

479
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:38,381
No. I tried.

480
00:22:38,446 --> 00:22:41,443
She, uh,
she said she couldn't accept it.

481
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:45,511
So what are you going to do?

482
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:49,900
I don't know.
We're kinda in this weird limbo

483
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:51,510
thing right now.

484
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,470
She's acting like
it never happened.

485
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:55,220
Ah, maybe it never will.

486
00:22:55,616 --> 00:22:57,451
Wait, Sam, do you have any idea

487
00:22:57,508 --> 00:22:59,473
how long I had to
chase down your mother

488
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:01,351
before she'd even talk to me?
2 years.

489
00:23:01,386 --> 00:23:02,813
2 years, seriously?

490
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:04,660
I was practically a stalker.

491
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:09,563
- Worked out ok.
- Persistence is king, Sam.

492
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:11,830
I mean,
how long have you known Andi?

493
00:23:12,088 --> 00:23:13,310
5 years.

494
00:23:13,646 --> 00:23:20,210
- What?
- Uh, well, no... it's just...

495
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:22,462
Yeah, that's a long time.

496
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:24,610
But, hey, you know,

497
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:26,711
you can always hope
for a miracle, right?

498
00:23:26,747 --> 00:23:28,643
You don't think I
should wait for her?

499
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:32,943
That's up to you, son.

500
00:23:33,907 --> 00:23:36,912
I'd hate to tell
you to give up,

501
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:39,221
but I'd also hate to

502
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:41,470
see you spend your
whole life waiting.

503
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:50,162
I don't know what
do with this list.

504
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:51,550
How the hell are we
going to figure out

505
00:23:51,587 --> 00:23:53,420
where the soul is
striking next?

506
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:56,200
I just don't want the devil
to sew my lips shut again.

507
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:58,212
Or any other parts of my body.

508
00:23:58,255 --> 00:23:59,223
Yeah, that's cool, man.

509
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:01,272
You are totally not
listening to me.

510
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:05,540
We should be at
that party, Sam.

511
00:24:05,757 --> 00:24:07,380
- Ben's family's party?
- Yes,

512
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,491
Ben's family's party.
We are family.

513
00:24:09,735 --> 00:24:11,793
He can't just pretend
we don't exist.

514
00:24:12,078 --> 00:24:13,802
He can't ignore us
like we're some

515
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,702
people to ignore, you know?

516
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:18,783
Yeah, you're right.

517
00:24:19,045 --> 00:24:21,741
- We should go to that party.
- Yeah, yeah, good.

518
00:24:22,037 --> 00:24:23,700
- Because--
- Because?

519
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:25,330
Because we need his
grandmother's help.

520
00:24:25,368 --> 00:24:27,123
She's got the eye, right?
To see the future.

521
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:28,521
Maybe she can help
us figure out

522
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:30,311
where the soul is going next.

523
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:34,633
Uh, Mimi?

524
00:24:34,898 --> 00:24:36,243
We're gonna-- we're gonna go.

525
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:38,233
We'll come back tomorrow to
fix the washing machine.

526
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:39,301
Ok.

527
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:42,461
Mimi, are you all right?

528
00:24:46,348 --> 00:24:47,862
Jerry called.

529
00:24:48,248 --> 00:24:49,691
Said he was coming over.

530
00:24:50,026 --> 00:24:51,370
So, as usual,

531
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:52,952
I get ready, and as usual,

532
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,543
he doesn't show up.

533
00:24:54,837 --> 00:24:57,592
- It's pathetic.
- No. Mimi, no.

534
00:24:57,936 --> 00:24:59,680
That is totally messed up, ok?

535
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,041
You cannot let Jerry
treat you like that.

536
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:03,830
I mean, look--look at you.

537
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:05,350
Look at how hot you are!

538
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:07,522
You're like a big plate of
"yeah!" sittin' right there.

539
00:25:07,557 --> 00:25:09,230
Come on. You know what?

540
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:11,571
You are comin' out with us.

541
00:25:11,907 --> 00:25:13,983
No, I'm--I'm not in the mood.

542
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:16,143
Well, that,
my pretty young lady friend,

543
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:17,651
is what beer bongs are for.

544
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:19,183
Let's go! Come on,

545
00:25:19,255 --> 00:25:21,163
I'm not taking no for an answer,
young lady.

546
00:25:21,197 --> 00:25:22,942
Let's shake that
tail feather, huh?

547
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,561
No, no, no!

548
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:28,320
- You can't come in here!
- We got presents! Look.

549
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,921
Bought your grandmother a book.
It's in spanish.

550
00:25:31,677 --> 00:25:34,020
- It's french.
- What?

551
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:38,473
You know, it's never too late
to learn a new language.

552
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:41,152
- Uh, maybe I should just go home.
- No, nonsense.

553
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:43,540
Meems, you get in there
and enjoy yourself, ok?

554
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:44,752
We'll be right behind you.

555
00:25:44,785 --> 00:25:47,542
I-I-I don't even know how
much I can stress to you guys

556
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:49,512
my ass will be
living in the bench

557
00:25:49,668 --> 00:25:51,100
if you mess up my life.

558
00:25:51,355 --> 00:25:53,803
Ben, we need your
grandma to use her... eye

559
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:55,681
to tell us who the
next victim is.

560
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:57,301
Sam, I don't know
if she can do that.

561
00:25:57,338 --> 00:25:59,201
It's our only shot.
If we don't find out who the soul

562
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:01,731
is going after next, people will die.
Come on!

563
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:02,822
Benny...

564
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,830
Come on, come on!

565
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,660
Just be cool.

566
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:10,890
Ice. Ice. Promise.

567
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:34,100
I haven't done this in years.

568
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:36,650
Jerry won't take me dancing.

569
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,951
Huh, well,
I hate to break it to you, Meems,

570
00:26:38,985 --> 00:26:40,581
but Jerry might be into dudes.

571
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:42,290
You are so much fun!

572
00:26:42,397 --> 00:26:43,861
I know, right.

573
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:46,120
Oh, I can't imagine
what Jerry would do

574
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:48,291
if he saw us together.
He'd go berzerk.

575
00:26:48,336 --> 00:26:50,630
- You think?
- Totally.

576
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:53,452
- He's got the worst temper.
- Oh, really?

577
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:09,452
Abuelita...

578
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:12,792
mi amigo, el es un tipo bueno.

579
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:16,623
Y... el solamente
necesita su sabiduria...

580
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:19,352
y regalo.

581
00:27:23,117 --> 00:27:24,611
Hello, ma'am.

582
00:27:28,006 --> 00:27:29,261
I need your help.

583
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:33,031
With an evil soul.

584
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:34,912
Someone on this list

585
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,001
is gonna get killed very soon.

586
00:27:37,328 --> 00:27:38,733
If you could tell
us who that is,

587
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:41,123
we might be able to
stop it from happening.

588
00:27:46,656 --> 00:27:49,131
Uh, she says she needs
more information,

589
00:27:49,428 --> 00:27:51,783
and she has to look at
the palm of your hand.

590
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:10,540
El diablo!

591
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:13,181
Sam!

592
00:28:34,406 --> 00:28:35,903
Sam, you should come inside.

593
00:28:36,238 --> 00:28:37,982
We'll get some
iodine on that hand.

594
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:41,242
You know what,
I--I need to get home and heal.

595
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:42,893
Goodnight, Mimi.

596
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:44,843
Sam, can I talk to you?

597
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:46,642
Just for a minute.

598
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:49,381
Sure. Yeah.

599
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:52,483
Look, I just wanted to ask, um,

600
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:55,903
I-I know it's weird,
me asking you for advice.

601
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:57,552
I hardly know you.

602
00:28:58,065 --> 00:28:59,840
Yeah, I'm--I'm
probably not the guy

603
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:01,553
who should be advising you on--

604
00:29:01,978 --> 00:29:04,010
Do you think I should
break it off with Jerry?

605
00:29:04,047 --> 00:29:07,653
It's just, I've been hanging on for,
god, on and off,

606
00:29:07,718 --> 00:29:09,343
more than 20 years now, and...

607
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:12,781
always going back to him.
Always hoping he'll make a commitment.

608
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:16,083
But now I don't
think he ever will.

609
00:29:16,425 --> 00:29:18,701
And maybe it's time stop
waiting and move on.

610
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:21,190
What do you think I should do?

611
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:24,930
I...

612
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:27,482
I--

613
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:30,023
I think...

614
00:29:30,785 --> 00:29:32,130
I think...

615
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,932
you should leave him.

616
00:29:39,268 --> 00:29:41,033
Do you feel that?

617
00:29:46,507 --> 00:29:48,482
Sam! Sam!

618
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:51,922
- What was that?
- Do you have any, um--

619
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,851
Ashes? Dead people's ashes?

620
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:56,420
Uh, my mother was
cremated a few years--

621
00:29:56,696 --> 00:29:58,392
I-I would love to
pay my respects.

622
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,303
Where is she?!

623
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:04,001
Was this an earthquake?

624
00:30:04,557 --> 00:30:06,552
Where are they?
Where are the ashes?

625
00:30:06,816 --> 00:30:08,441
Why? Do you need to--

626
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:10,673
We need to save them
from the earthquake.

627
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,200
They're in a bag on the shelf
over the washing machine.

628
00:30:13,238 --> 00:30:14,841
Oh, we got 'em, we got 'em.

629
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:16,821
Yeah. Sock, wait!

630
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,461
- Guys!
- Oh, no!

631
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:22,932
I left the backpack at the party.
The vessel's inside it!

632
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:25,713
You gotta protect yourself, Sam!
Protect your orifices!

633
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,942
I see it! I see it!

634
00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:37,672
I got it!

635
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:40,062
- You got it?
- Yeah!

636
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:43,202
Nice hands, body!

637
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:49,253
Sam, that's bad, right?

638
00:31:22,677 --> 00:31:24,682
Duct tape. Duct tape, Sam.

639
00:31:29,268 --> 00:31:31,681
Oh... all right, hit me.
Hit me hard, come on.

640
00:31:34,437 --> 00:31:36,303
What the hell happened?

641
00:31:37,226 --> 00:31:39,023
Are those my pantyhose?

642
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:41,022
What? Oh, these?

643
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,863
I... I thought these were mine.

644
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:46,452
Uh, we weren't able to
fix the washing machine,

645
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,892
and the pipes were backed up.

646
00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:49,152
That's...

647
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:50,911
That's what the booming was.

648
00:31:51,348 --> 00:31:53,610
The wet-dry vac got jammed.

649
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,611
We gotta get a new one.

650
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:57,753
We'll be back to
clean this up later.

651
00:31:58,046 --> 00:31:59,652
Ok. Sam.

652
00:32:02,108 --> 00:32:03,900
How did we not know
Mimi was on the list?

653
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:05,542
She must be using
her maiden name.

654
00:32:05,577 --> 00:32:07,393
Interesting, Sam.
Don't care, open the trunk.

655
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,390
Are you sure we have the
soul and not just the ashes?

656
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:10,943
Forget that question.

657
00:32:11,165 --> 00:32:12,623
Come on, come on!

658
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:20,480
Caught your ass, ash man!

659
00:32:20,758 --> 00:32:22,953
Caught your ass, you ash! Yeah!

660
00:32:23,177 --> 00:32:25,001
Can you not taunt the soul?

661
00:32:25,268 --> 00:32:27,660
Let's just get to the
center and find the vessel.

662
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,351
Ok. Ok.

663
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:32,343
Ben, yeah, we need to get back
into the community center.

664
00:32:32,377 --> 00:32:34,062
I don't care that you're
with your grandma.

665
00:32:34,098 --> 00:32:35,592
Just bring the keys.

666
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:37,311
Almost there, buddy.

667
00:32:37,578 --> 00:32:40,470
I'll be glad to blow-dry this
chalky bastard back to hell.

668
00:32:42,957 --> 00:32:44,522
Oh, he's a feisty one!

669
00:32:44,785 --> 00:32:46,132
Sock?

670
00:32:46,448 --> 00:32:49,403
What did you say you did with
all the bags of ash we collected?

671
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:50,981
The ash? I took care of it.

672
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:53,802
Right. How exactly did
you take care of it?

673
00:32:54,067 --> 00:32:55,680
Where did you put it?

674
00:32:55,965 --> 00:32:57,720
Nowhere.

675
00:32:57,908 --> 00:33:00,020
- It's still in the trunk.
- It's still in the trunk.

676
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:01,862
It's still in the trunk!

677
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,560
I'm just gonna be really fast,
ok, grandma?

678
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,000
There's hatred in her eyes.

679
00:33:33,126 --> 00:33:35,151
I saw hatred in
the woman's eyes.

680
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:46,213
- Do you have it?
- I just got here!

681
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:47,973
Benny, open the door. Open it!

682
00:33:48,185 --> 00:33:49,053
Ok.

683
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:54,071
We have a whole lot
of ash in there!

684
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:56,002
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on!

685
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:03,141
- I found it.
- All right.

686
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:04,853
Cover your faces.

687
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:21,480
I feel much safer now.

688
00:34:33,546 --> 00:34:35,943
This is really
ineffective, Sam!

689
00:35:01,337 --> 00:35:02,911
We're alive!

690
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:05,572
I don't know how much
time I have left.

691
00:35:42,855 --> 00:35:44,990
- What?
- Ben, what'd she say?

692
00:35:45,288 --> 00:35:46,781
She said I'm doing god's work,

693
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:49,312
and I finally have
her blessing.

694
00:35:50,227 --> 00:35:51,613
That's great.

695
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,461
You know, she's worth millions.

696
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:00,900
Thank you.

697
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:06,392
Oh, congratulations on a job well done,
once again.

698
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:08,613
- Thank you.
- No, no, no, Sam.

699
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,730
Thank you so much.

700
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:13,160
Mimi's moving to New Mexico.

701
00:36:15,845 --> 00:36:17,970
That's too bad.

702
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:19,573
Isn't it?

703
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:22,110
She said something about not
waiting around for me anymore

704
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:23,723
and starting a new life.

705
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:26,903
Now, where on earth would she
get those ideas, Dr. Phil?

706
00:36:27,878 --> 00:36:29,091
It was her choice.

707
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:31,383
I just told her what
her options were.

708
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,552
You're really broken
up about this.

709
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:38,370
Sam, don't confuse sentimentality
with practicality.

710
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:41,141
I spent a lot of time
corrupting Mimi.

711
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:45,840
And I was this close to
destroying her self esteem.

712
00:36:46,085 --> 00:36:47,702
You're lying.

713
00:36:48,068 --> 00:36:49,873
You sent me to her
house to protect her.

714
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:51,392
You were the one
breaking all her stuff

715
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:53,520
so I'd be there to save
her from the soul.

716
00:36:53,737 --> 00:36:56,080
Well, you have me all figured out,
do you, Sam?

717
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:57,461
Yeah, I do.

718
00:36:57,778 --> 00:36:59,521
I think you really
cared about her.

719
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,873
Want to see how much
I cared about her?

720
00:37:02,898 --> 00:37:04,401
She's dead.

721
00:37:04,698 --> 00:37:06,073
- What?
- That's right.

722
00:37:06,186 --> 00:37:08,603
With the snap of my fingers,
Mimi just got hit by a bus.

723
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:10,022
Gruesome.

724
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:11,952
You can't tell her
from the pavement.

725
00:37:12,077 --> 00:37:13,702
And that's on you, buddy.

726
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:17,253
- You sick son of a--
- Oh, calm down, hero.

727
00:37:17,548 --> 00:37:20,351
I'm screwing with you.
Mimi's fine.

728
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:48,820
- Greatest movie ever.
- I know.

729
00:37:49,176 --> 00:37:51,423
I saw it like a zillion
times when I was kid.

730
00:37:51,657 --> 00:37:53,803
Except for that part
with the vampire bats.

731
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:56,373
You know, I've only ever seen
that through my fingers.

732
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,421
It's yours. Only a quarter.

733
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:00,791
No. Finders, keepers.

734
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:03,722
But, um, if you try to take

735
00:38:03,836 --> 00:38:06,312
this copy of Highlander 2:
The quickening.

736
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:08,150
I'm gonna fight you.

737
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:12,123
Sam! You made it.

738
00:38:12,476 --> 00:38:14,543
- I'll give you 50% off.
- Thank you.

739
00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:17,913
Hey, so, New Mexico, wow.

740
00:38:18,038 --> 00:38:20,883
You heard, huh? Is he upset?

741
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:24,830
If I say yes, are you gonna

742
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:27,352
change your mind and get
back together with him?

743
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:30,062
- Because, then no.
- I'm not gonna change my mind.

744
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:32,831
I've never been more sure of
anything in my entire life.

745
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:34,193
Thank you.

746
00:38:34,576 --> 00:38:36,870
- I didn't really do anything.
- Yes, you did.

747
00:38:37,086 --> 00:38:38,933
You gave me the
little push I needed,

748
00:38:39,188 --> 00:38:41,031
showed me what I
was missing in life.

749
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,931
I can't wait around
for Jerry anymore.

750
00:38:42,965 --> 00:38:44,720
I've wasted so much time.
I deserve better.

751
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,110
You do.

752
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:48,020
Cady, come here.

753
00:38:48,338 --> 00:38:49,950
I want you to meet my daughter.

754
00:38:50,315 --> 00:38:52,061
Cady, this is Sam.

755
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:54,322
This is your daughter?

756
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,850
Yeah, and I'm gonna
miss her so much.

757
00:38:57,006 --> 00:38:58,900
And maybe the two of
you can hang out.

758
00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:00,271
I'd feel a lot better knowing

759
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:01,982
somebody was
looking out for her.

760
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:05,082
Yeah. So you're not going to go
to New Mexico with your mom?

761
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,030
No way. It's too hot.

762
00:39:07,336 --> 00:39:09,741
Mom, you can't sell
my ninja turtles.

763
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:13,680
Ok. All right.
Donatello, her first boyfriend.

764
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:16,711
- I'll see you around, Sam.
- Yeah. Nice meeting you.

765
00:39:21,928 --> 00:39:24,301
Hey, Mimi... how--

766
00:39:24,626 --> 00:39:26,623
how long was it that
you've known Jerry?

767
00:39:26,725 --> 00:39:29,791
On and off,
more than 20 years, long time.

768
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:31,303
But that's all behind me.

769
00:39:31,497 --> 00:39:33,060
I'm starting a new life.

770
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:42,863
The devil has a child.

771
00:39:43,907 --> 00:39:47,522
You know, I never thought
that the devil had genitals.

772
00:39:47,727 --> 00:39:49,242
What, like a Ken doll?

773
00:39:49,506 --> 00:39:51,152
I don't think
she's his daughter.

774
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:52,792
She's really nice.

775
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:54,802
I don't know, Sam.
I don't like it.

776
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:57,352
This satan's trying to get you
to hook up with his daughter.

777
00:39:57,386 --> 00:39:59,261
You know,
I bet she wants your man seed.

778
00:39:59,298 --> 00:40:00,501
What? No.

779
00:40:00,605 --> 00:40:02,673
Yeah, sure, think about it.
You knocked her up, right,

780
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:04,473
then the devil has a little
Sam baby running around

781
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:06,350
catching souls for
him when he grows up.

782
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:08,113
After, you know, you kick.

783
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:12,131
Which I hope will not be
for a very long time.

784
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,010
You know what,
I think I'm going to give Cady a call.

785
00:40:15,886 --> 00:40:17,590
What about Andi?

786
00:40:18,076 --> 00:40:21,703
I don't know. What have I been
hanging onto, a glimmer of hope?

787
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:24,650
I could wait forever and
miss out on living my life.

788
00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:29,592
- Let's do this.
- Yep, let's do it.

789
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:31,110
Now.

790
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:35,640
Is it wrong, what we're doing?

791
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:38,713
Huh? No, no. Man, we're heroes.
It's totally cool.

792
00:40:38,968 --> 00:40:40,782
We should say something.

793
00:40:41,808 --> 00:40:46,182
We saved your families
from a giant ash monster.

794
00:40:46,368 --> 00:40:47,881
You're welcome.

795
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,491
Amen.

796
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:51,482
- That was nice.
- Thank you.

797
00:40:51,786 --> 00:40:55,520
Thanks to Raceman
