1
00:00:01,012 --> 00:00:02,424
Previously, on "Reaper"...

2
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:04,601
- I'm the devil.
- Aah!

3
00:00:05,752 --> 00:00:07,688
My parents sold my
soul to the devil.

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,906
- You didn't tell Andi?
- No! I'm not gonna tell Andi.

5
00:00:09,936 --> 00:00:11,906
If she knows, she'll think I'm a freak.
She'll never go out with me.

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,615
You can make her go
out with you, Damien.

7
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:16,495
- Do I have to go to hell now?
- No, no, no, no, not now.

8
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:19,531
You're just going to bring
escaped souls back to hell.

9
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:21,040
That's cool, right?

10
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:22,820
And how am I supposed
to capture them?

11
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,196
This will help-- a vessel

12
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,415
handcrafted in the
bowels of perdition

13
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,977
by the iniquitous and the vile.

14
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,152
That'll work.

15
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:31,550
Word of caution--

16
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:33,760
I don't accept failure.

17
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:39,983
The boss gives you the vessel
he thinks you can handle.

18
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:41,683
You must be a real moron.

19
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:09,643
All right. I'll do it.
I'll do it.

20
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,001
I'll open it.

21
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,561
Way too early for this.

22
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:27,963
Morning, Linda Blair.

23
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:32,181
Hilarious.

24
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,021
Can you do that?

25
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:35,093
What?

26
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:37,040
Can you turn your head
all the way around?

27
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:39,260
- Sock, I'm not possessed.
- Yeah. Ok.

28
00:01:40,277 --> 00:01:41,893
My parents sold my
soul to the devil

29
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:45,030
and I'm a bounty hunter for hell.
- Totally different.

30
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:49,420
Have you even tried to turn
your head all the way around?

31
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:50,950
Yeah, it totally doesn't work.

32
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:52,133
What is that?

33
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:53,231
What?

34
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:54,792
That.

35
00:01:56,786 --> 00:01:59,401
I don't know.
Like static electricity or something.

36
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:05,201
Ow! Sock.

37
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:07,473
Are we done? Are we done? Yeah?

38
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:09,152
Yeah. All right. We're done.

39
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:15,380
So, what,
you didn't open the box yet?

40
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:16,593
No.

41
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,021
You don't want to know
what the devil gave you?

42
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:21,992
I know what he gave me--
another vessel to capture souls.

43
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:24,821
Who have escaped
from hell. Yeah.

44
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,090
Sock, we almost died
the last time, ok?

45
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:29,060
And somebody ended
up hospitalized.

46
00:02:29,077 --> 00:02:30,672
Don't you understand
what's going on here?

47
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:32,850
You've finally found the
one thing you're good at.

48
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,690
You sent an escaped
soul back to hell

49
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:36,473
and you kicked ass--
we kicked ass!

50
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:39,502
I'm good at stuff, ok?
Other stuff.

51
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,883
Right?

52
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,861
Yeah, you do rock the
house on guitar hero.

53
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:45,660
That's what I'm talking about.

54
00:02:45,837 --> 00:02:47,180
Just let me open the box.

55
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:49,503
No, you can't open the box.
It's at my house.

56
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,811
What, are you kidding me?
It's right there.

57
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:55,221
I can't believe it.
It's stalking me!

58
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:58,983
Oh. Ok. I get it. Yeah.

59
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:00,722
What?

60
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:02,570
I know exactly what to do.

61
00:03:06,856 --> 00:03:08,183
So, just--

62
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:10,421
me and you are here in the woods,
Sammy, huh?

63
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,903
Have a little picnic.

64
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:13,273
It'll be nice!
Won't it be nice, Sammy?

65
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:14,792
Let's just find a little

66
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:16,781
comfy spot in the shade
where we can lay down a

67
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:19,661
lay down a blanket,
smoke a bowl,

68
00:03:19,988 --> 00:03:21,351
make out all afternoon.

69
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:23,010
How about that? Sound good?

70
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:24,350
Sounds good to me.

71
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:26,053
- What...
- Shut up.

72
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:27,583
So we're just gonna--

73
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:29,630
- Let's go get some--
- Go, go, go.

74
00:03:29,787 --> 00:03:32,000
Go, go, go, go. Go.

75
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:38,500
Inside. Come on.
Come on. Door's locked.

76
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:40,030
Be cool, man.

77
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:45,851
Go, go, go, go, go!

78
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:56,580
- It worked.
- Of course it worked.

79
00:04:00,677 --> 00:04:02,381
Oh, my god.

80
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:04,792
Sam, I'm in love with this box.

81
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:06,801
Just one quickie?

82
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:09,003
Can we do it one more time?
One more time.

83
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:17,093
Reaper Season 1 Episode 2 : "Charged"
For www.forom.com

84
00:04:19,935 --> 00:04:21,961
*Na tell a little story*

85
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:25,020
*about the ones I
left and left me*

86
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:26,772
*you know if you're one*

87
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:28,613
*'cause you know what you done*

88
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:30,363
*whoa, oh*

89
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:34,083
*get out of my way, away, oh*

90
00:04:34,388 --> 00:04:36,721
*first you kissed me,
then you killed me*

91
00:04:37,065 --> 00:04:38,481
*get out of my...*

92
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,093
- Hey, where's the truck going?
- Delaware.

93
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:42,571
I approve. Good.

94
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,011
You're an idiot, Sam.

95
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:46,020
The devil's gonna kill
you when he finds out.

96
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:47,603
Well, I hope he won't find out.

97
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:49,830
Well, isn't he all-knowing
and everything?

98
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:50,981
Ben--

99
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:53,141
can you find Delaware on a map?

100
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:55,810
Well, you make an
excellent point.

101
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:59,602
Aww, damn it with these
stupid blackouts already.

102
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:01,672
Aah!

103
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:07,081
- You ok, Sam?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

104
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:08,522
It's ok, buddy.

105
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:10,372
I'm afraid of the dark, too.

106
00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:18,581
- Sock, I'm right here.
- Yeah, I know.

107
00:05:26,796 --> 00:05:30,813
Oh, cool.

108
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,061
You and I are on
cart duty all week.

109
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:34,752
Uh, great.

110
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:37,531
Yeah, it is great.
This is my favorite job here.

111
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:40,600
Wandering the neighborhood
collecting lost shopping carts?

112
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:42,173
That's your favorite job?

113
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,531
Sam.

114
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:46,851
The last time I did this shift,
I saw 5 movies in one week.

115
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:48,931
I mean,
as long as I brought a cart back a day,

116
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,482
my job was done.

117
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:53,451
But what if you
don't find any carts?

118
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:56,282
Well, that's why I
keep 3 shopping carts

119
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:58,640
in my mom's backyard
at all times.

120
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:01,330
You've mastered the
art of not working

121
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:03,272
better than anybody
I've ever met.

122
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:04,563
I know. It's a gift.

123
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:06,190
Really. Ha ha.

124
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:08,041
Listen, this is gonna be great.

125
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:09,411
I mean,
we'll go see some movies.

126
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,020
We'll go out to lunch.
I mean, it'll be fun.

127
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:12,482
Yeah. It will.

128
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:21,470
- Ready?
- Yeah.

129
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,052
A little less show,
a little more aim, please?

130
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:27,673
Sorry, buddy.
I'm all about the show.

131
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:29,613
It's in the old DNA.
Know what I mean?

132
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:32,653
So it's official, huh?

133
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,773
You and Andi,
honey mooning all week?

134
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:37,012
Yeah, I know.
How great is that, right?

135
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:38,643
A week of dates with Andi

136
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:40,691
and I didn't have
to ask her out!

137
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:42,160
Open the vessel, Sammy.

138
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,152
You got a job to do.

139
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:45,910
Yo, heads up!

140
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:50,413
Customer services.

141
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:52,372
Customer down, aisle 9.

142
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:54,261
Customer down, aisle 9.

143
00:06:54,295 --> 00:06:55,860
Oh, no. Ok.

144
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:02,996
You have broken the most
cardinal rule here at the bench.

145
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:07,935
A bloodied customer is
not a happy customer.

146
00:07:08,236 --> 00:07:09,767
Ted, it was an accident.

147
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,573
- I'm really, really sorry.
- The question is...

148
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:14,612
What is the
appropriate punishment?

149
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:17,191
Well, if you wanted
to be really mean,

150
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:18,842
you know, you could...

151
00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:20,932
make us work here.

152
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:23,742
Wear ugly blue aprons day and night.
That would suck.

153
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:25,821
Speaking of nights, you two

154
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:28,203
are on the night shift
until further notice.

155
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:29,702
What? No. No. No.

156
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:31,552
Sam, yes--this is a great deal.

157
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:32,930
It's a great deal.

158
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:34,992
And how do you figure
that, Wysocki?

159
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,751
Well, it's just that normally,

160
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:38,562
I reserve the nights
for sleeping,

161
00:07:38,595 --> 00:07:40,192
and now you have
me working nights.

162
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,321
So essentially,
you're paying me to sleep,

163
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,033
which I think is
really decent of you.

164
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:45,710
Oh, there will be no sleeping.

165
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:48,650
You will be expected to
inventory the entire store.

166
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:51,050
That's over 2 million items
that need to be counted,

167
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:52,903
labeled, and properly shelved.

168
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:54,522
You will not be
off the night shift

169
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:56,001
until your task is completed,

170
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:58,641
which will probably take you about,
oh, a year.

171
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:03,091
Well, that screws
cart duty with Andi.

172
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,980
Inventory. I'll
give him inventory.

173
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,423
That little piece of dick.
I hate him. I hate him!

174
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:10,452
His stupid, little haircut and his
dumb grin and his little, weird eye.

175
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:12,362
- Which one is weird?
- Both of them!

176
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,391
Sock, are you all right?

177
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,310
Hulk need to smash?

178
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,831
Stupid Ted!

179
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:29,602
Work bench!

180
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:31,592
Jessica Alba.

181
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:35,301
What's with Jessica Alba?

182
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:37,362
She thinks she's
too good for me.

183
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:38,813
Really?

184
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:41,313
Are you good?
Get the anger out?

185
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:43,072
Still got a little taste.

186
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:45,851
- Just a little.
- I anticipated that.

187
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:48,610
That is
beautiful craftsmanship.

188
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:55,293
- You good?
- Rock and roll.

189
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:58,131
Let's go.

190
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:01,541
What's for dinner?

191
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:03,663
Look--if you come in,
do not mention the devil.

192
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:05,441
My mom doesn't think I'm
working for him anymore.

193
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:06,930
What? Why does she think that?

194
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:08,462
Because I... I implied it.

195
00:09:08,706 --> 00:09:09,890
- You lied.
- Yes, I lied.

196
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:11,142
Good. Good, good.

197
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:13,400
She felt guilty and I had
to let her off the hook,

198
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:14,920
and my dad wants us to
keep her in the dark.

199
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:16,463
Say no more. It's a good plan.

200
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:18,750
- I mean, I know it sounds lame.
- No, it doesn't sound lame.

201
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:20,233
She's going to find out anyway.

202
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,813
Listen, Sam, in my experience,

203
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:24,563
lying is always
a great idea, ok?

204
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,780
She's gonna find out the truth,
isn't she?

205
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:28,011
Not from me, she's not.

206
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,453
I will keep your secret,
buddy, all right?

207
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:31,031
You got nothing to worry about.

208
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:33,843
Ok.

209
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:36,793
So, how was work today, boys?

210
00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:39,253
Everything is totally
normal at the bench.

211
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:40,763
The old bench, you know.

212
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,591
Nothing weird or
demonic going on.

213
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,072
If anybody else says
anything different,

214
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,372
they are lying liars, ok?

215
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,120
- Great job, man.
- Thank you.

216
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:56,941
You got a delivery today, Sam.

217
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:58,311
I did?

218
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,573
This was left at
the front door.

219
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:02,691
What is that?

220
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:07,643
Um...that--ok.

221
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:09,683
Well, Linda,
actually, that's...

222
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,541
That's mine. That is mine.

223
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:15,360
It's a project I'm
doing for school.

224
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:18,531
You're not in school, Bert.

225
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,003
I know. Yeah.

226
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,190
Bert,

227
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:26,430
now I am going to
look you in the eye

228
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:29,653
and I'm going to ask you
to tell me the truth.

229
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,790
Does that box belong to you?

230
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:39,152
I gotta go.
I'll see ya tomorrow, Sam.

231
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:40,843
Thank you for dinner.

232
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:45,201
Ok, I need one of you
to tell me the truth.

233
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:49,020
Mom. Mom, everything is fine.

234
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:50,622
Fine. I'm ok.

235
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:55,632
Whatever. Eat some cake.

236
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:58,600
Ok, then.

237
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:22,732
Isn't nature magnificent?

238
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:24,463
Beautiful.

239
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:25,751
Angry.

240
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:27,113
Soothing.

241
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,691
Merciless.

242
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:30,623
It's perfection,
don't you think?

243
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:34,921
Gotta give whatshisface credit.

244
00:11:35,848 --> 00:11:37,613
Well, what is this?

245
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:39,952
Do you have to keep
transporting me places?

246
00:11:39,986 --> 00:11:42,092
Obviously I do,
since my earlier nudge

247
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:44,352
to get you working
gleaned zero results.

248
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:46,672
You know,
I'm very disappointed.

249
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:49,142
You have the vessel.
Open the box.

250
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:51,641
There are souls out
there wreaking havoc.

251
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:54,352
Well, I've been busy.
I have another job, you know.

252
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,961
Have you noticed the
blackouts around town?

253
00:11:57,977 --> 00:11:59,512
And what do you
think of those shocks

254
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:01,822
- you've been getting?
- They're annoying.

255
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:03,713
No, they're my gifts to you.

256
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:07,332
It's a tool to help you
find our escaped soul.

257
00:12:08,058 --> 00:12:10,280
Yeah, you know,
I've been thinking about that,

258
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:12,841
and I don't think I'm the guy

259
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:14,753
who should be taking
on the forces of evil.

260
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:15,873
No?

261
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:17,700
I know y own my soul and all,

262
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,692
but I think the world
would be better off

263
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,842
if I worked for you
in a lesser capacity.

264
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:23,313
Such as?

265
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:24,682
Well...

266
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:27,570
I haven't come up with the
full plan or anything, but

267
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:29,933
maybe I could get the word out.

268
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,541
You know, like a recruiter.

269
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:33,981
I could start my own
satanic web site with evil

270
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,932
design and then have
really cool devil

271
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,442
- graphics or something and...
- Business is booming, Sam.

272
00:12:40,738 --> 00:12:42,631
I don't need any help
with recruiting.

273
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:43,950
I need help

274
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:46,922
putting the damned back into
hell where they belong.

275
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:49,811
Is this about you being afraid?

276
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:53,870
No. Yes. Very much yes.

277
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:55,610
Well, then,
I have words of wisdom

278
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:57,152
that apply to your condition.

279
00:12:57,495 --> 00:12:59,920
If you find yourself
facing a steep,

280
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:02,023
uphill, bloody battle,

281
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,240
there are only 2
choices you can make.

282
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:05,351
Quit,

283
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:07,781
or put one foot in
front of the other

284
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:09,343
and tough it out.

285
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:11,280
Inspiring, huh?

286
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:15,362
And if I don't

287
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:17,551
tough it out?

288
00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:22,992
That lightning strike

289
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:25,810
just killed Penny Kilarski.

290
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:28,102
A very talented doctor.

291
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:29,980
She ran a hospital
here in town.

292
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:32,141
She was the coach of her
little girl's soccer team.

293
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:33,483
A good woman.

294
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:35,903
You gotta do your job, Sammy.

295
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:40,233
You ignore it, nice folks die.

296
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:43,142
And I know you don't want that.

297
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:46,071
Do you?

298
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:14,592
Huh. Cool.

299
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:19,650
Hey, Sammy.

300
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,590
- Hi. Hi, dad.
- What's going on?

301
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:24,550
Come with me, will you?

302
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:31,883
This is for you, Sam.

303
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:34,573
The car?

304
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:37,923
Just think of it as a
belated birthday present.

305
00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:40,542
I figured,
you dinged up your car last week

306
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:43,242
and, well,
it was time for a new one anyway, so...

307
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:44,463
The color good?

308
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:46,380
Yeah, yeah. It's great.

309
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,433
Good. Oh,
and it's a hybrid, so,

310
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,153
environmental and all that.

311
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:54,763
Right. Thank you. Um... So

312
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:57,283
you're pretty much trying
to buy me off, right?

313
00:14:57,318 --> 00:15:00,023
What? No! Yes.

314
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:01,960
Dad, look,

315
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:04,720
I was thinking maybe
lying to mom isn't

316
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:07,872
- the best way to go here.
- It's not lying, exactly.

317
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:09,632
I mean, I don't understand why

318
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:11,132
you can't just tell
her the truth.

319
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:13,100
Mom, hey,
I'm working for the devil.

320
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,440
Besides, I think she
suspects something anyway.

321
00:15:15,478 --> 00:15:16,952
But she's not sure, Sam,

322
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,611
and that little bit of
doubt is enough for her.

323
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:21,390
She doesn't want
to know the truth.

324
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:23,352
She can't handle it.
She's too fragile.

325
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:26,260
Look, I know it's
a lot to ask, but

326
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:28,422
please, can you just
keep up the lie?

327
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:31,253
For her.

328
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:35,171
Yeah, yeah.

329
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:37,282
We'll keep it up.
We'll keep it up.

330
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:38,721
Thank you.

331
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:42,210
My soul gets sold to the devil.

332
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:44,472
I get 42 miles to the gallon.

333
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:46,391
Sounds like a good deal to me.

334
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,941
I think it's a chick car.

335
00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,082
How do you capture
a soul with it?

336
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:01,843
I don't know.

337
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:04,222
Maybe you drive it
into the guy, right?

338
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:06,370
Yeah, that sounds good.

339
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,511
Well, did the devil
give you instructions?

340
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:09,940
A manual? Anything?

341
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:12,682
No, the devil just pretty
much sets me up for failure.

342
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:14,153
Yeah, well, he is the devil.

343
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:18,640
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

344
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:22,761
We'll sell you the whole seat,
but you'll only need the edge!

345
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,623
- Damn it.
- What?

346
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:32,223
The soul's at it again.

347
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:33,950
So what does that mean?

348
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:37,460
- Every time there's a blackout...
- ...an angel gets its wings.

349
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:41,730
Or somebody gets
hit by lightning,

350
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:43,932
which is--it's terrible.

351
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:47,023
Well, shouldn't we do
something about it?

352
00:16:47,087 --> 00:16:48,290
There's not much we can do.

353
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:49,952
We don't know where he is.

354
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:58,101
Oh! God!

355
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:00,741
I can't count these.
I'll get electrocuted.

356
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,941
2,465.

357
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:05,763
Hey, I want an accurate
inventory this year.

358
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,381
Not just writing down
random numbers, Bert.

359
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:09,742
Settle down, Ted.

360
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:12,453
We're going to be completely
professional, all right?

361
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:14,043
Yeah, that's airtight.

362
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:16,431
I'm taking these generators
down to Armstrong Hospital.

363
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:17,822
Th lost their
power or something.

364
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:19,353
Paid twice what they're worth.

365
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:21,160
Uh--lost power.

366
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,011
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

367
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:24,770
Um, Ted, you know what?
We can take 'em.

368
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:26,112
What?

369
00:17:26,415 --> 00:17:27,901
Yeah. Yes.

370
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:29,261
We will take them.

371
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,110
- Really?
- Really.

372
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:33,770
Abso-smurfly.

373
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:40,411
This is all related
to the soul?

374
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:42,620
You guys from the work bench?

375
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:44,110
- Yes.
- Oh, thank god.

376
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:46,061
Our backup generators
didn't kick in.

377
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,623
But why is this all happening?

378
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:49,670
Got struck by lightning. Twice.

379
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,433
The soul must've struck the
hospital with lightning.

380
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:59,112
- Why?
- Look.

381
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,700
What's it say?

382
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:06,703
I don't know.

383
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:14,763
Sam! Are you ok?

384
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:18,850
You need a doctor.

385
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:22,053
Dr. Jager, Dr. Cuervo, Dr.
Captain Morgan.

386
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:23,720
He has two titles.

387
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:29,660
- How do you feel?
- Kinda crispy.

388
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,142
Excuse me.
Um, excuse me. Can I--

389
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:34,063
Can I borrow that
for a second??

390
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:35,723
- Screw you.
- Can I?

391
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,853
Yeah, ok.

392
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:41,421
- How did you do that?
- It's the hair.

393
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:43,402
- What are you doing?
- That sign.

394
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:45,511
It's like they covered
it up or something.

395
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:47,280
Ok.

396
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:49,281
Armstrong Medical Hospital,

397
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:51,821
formerly known as the
Arthur Ferrey medical wing.

398
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:54,262
- Why'd they change it?
- Looks like he got arrested.

399
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:56,190
You found all that
out just right now?

400
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:57,981
I--I would--it--

401
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:00,631
You made any long
distance calls,

402
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,973
- I'm coming back to kill you.
- Oh, my god.

403
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:05,292
You are a very,
very hostile young lady.

404
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:07,552
Do you know that?
Can I have your number?

405
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:09,863
Can he have your phone number?

406
00:19:10,175 --> 00:19:11,731
I got to go back
to the work bench.

407
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:13,732
No, you do not.
Sit down and drink.

408
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,233
Ted needs the inventory.

409
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:16,913
Somebody's got to do it.

410
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:18,761
Fine. You.

411
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:35,431
Turning now to the weather,

412
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:37,021
if you have any outdoor plans,

413
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:39,482
things are looking pretty good
for the next couple of days.

414
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:40,730
Current conditions right now--

415
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:42,213
We have mostly sunny skies...

416
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:51,790
Oh, you're probably gonna
want to wait a minute,

417
00:20:52,157 --> 00:20:53,723
let it breathe, so to speak.

418
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:55,571
What are you doing here?
My mom is home.

419
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:57,403
You know, Sam,
you're one lucky man.

420
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:58,852
You're home during the day,

421
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,693
all the wonderful daytime
television to watch.

422
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:01,923
When does Ellen come on?

423
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:03,192
No. Hold on.

424
00:21:03,448 --> 00:21:04,810
Is Arthur Ferrey
the escaped soul?

425
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:05,933
What do you think?

426
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,710
Well, I think I
saw him last night.

427
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:09,653
And what's with hitting
people with lighting?

428
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:11,820
Well, I don't think that
that's being done on purpose.

429
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:13,090
You know, Sam,

430
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,123
you have to stop trying to
assign logic to these souls.

431
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:19,502
Usually when they get out,
you know, they're just angry.

432
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:21,240
He was electrocuted in hell

433
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,193
every day that he
was down there.

434
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,883
That's the kind of a thing
that makes a person crazy.

435
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:29,121
That's what I do best.

436
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:31,031
All right. Listen.

437
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:32,201
You got to get out of here.

438
00:21:32,245 --> 00:21:33,891
My mom is gonna freak out.

439
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:36,131
Are you having problems
at home, Sammy?

440
00:21:36,537 --> 00:21:38,332
- You are my problem.
- No, no, Sam.

441
00:21:38,355 --> 00:21:39,952
To be fair, you're the problem.

442
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:41,690
You lied to your mother,

443
00:21:42,078 --> 00:21:43,671
and lying never
solves anything.

444
00:21:43,907 --> 00:21:45,333
- Sam?
- Yeah, mom? Yes?

445
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:50,980
- Hey.
- Hey.

446
00:21:51,756 --> 00:21:53,070
Who were you talking to?

447
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:56,822
Uh, I was talking to me,
to myself.

448
00:21:57,076 --> 00:21:58,293
I do that sometimes.

449
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,492
Oh. Ok.

450
00:22:02,217 --> 00:22:03,922
So, what's all this?

451
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:09,971
Uh, that was a
crazy work thing.

452
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,270
There was a fire,
a small, small fire,

453
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:14,240
and I fought it,
and it was gone.

454
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:16,391
How are you?

455
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,702
You can tell me anything.
You know that.

456
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:20,593
I do know that. Yep.

457
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:23,091
I love our chats.

458
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:25,410
I love you, mom.

459
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:35,051
Till count, Andi?

460
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:37,593
I'm sorry, Ted. You know what?

461
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:39,962
I'm 8 bucks off.
I counted 4 times.

462
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:42,302
Oh, that's not good, is it?

463
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:44,342
Well, it's not really my fault.

464
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:46,372
I haven't been on this
register all day.

465
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:48,201
Yet you remain the
responsible part.

466
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:50,310
Oh, come on.
I'll pay for it, Ted.

467
00:22:50,615 --> 00:22:51,893
No, Sam.

468
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:54,080
You are not buying
her incompetence.

469
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,223
She is.

470
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,551
Any more lip from you,

471
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:58,102
and you will find yourself
on the night shift.

472
00:22:58,136 --> 00:22:59,500
Am I clear?

473
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:07,410
You know what, Ted?

474
00:23:09,406 --> 00:23:10,710
You caught me.

475
00:23:11,218 --> 00:23:12,483
I stole the 8 bucks.

476
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:18,450
- I see.
- Yep.

477
00:23:18,907 --> 00:23:21,020
I was saving to buy
you a girlfriend.

478
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:25,021
I assume you're ok with
the plastic variety.

479
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:30,122
Oh, I get it.

480
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:32,961
Make me put you on night
shift so you can be

481
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:35,310
reunited with your
little friend here.

482
00:23:36,186 --> 00:23:37,740
Well, no.

483
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,771
You stay on days.

484
00:23:42,545 --> 00:23:45,913
When are you gonna learn,
you can't outfox the fox, guys?

485
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:53,782
- I tried.
- Yes, you did.

486
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:57,433
- Hey Andi, you ready?
- Yeah.

487
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,782
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey.

488
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:00,250
All right.
I'm just gonna turn this in.

489
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:01,300
Ok.

490
00:24:01,596 --> 00:24:02,760
Oh, wait. Josie...

491
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:04,291
You work for the D.A.

492
00:24:04,606 --> 00:24:06,351
Have you heard of
an Arthur Ferrey?

493
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,202
Of course. Everyone has.

494
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:11,532
Yeah. Yeah. Not really.

495
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,341
God, please read the
news once in a while.

496
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:16,680
He was this energy
trader who got caught

497
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:19,080
stealing electricity and
selling it to other states.

498
00:24:19,116 --> 00:24:21,321
There were rolling blackouts.
People died.

499
00:24:21,645 --> 00:24:23,243
My boss was gonna
prosecute him,

500
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:24,592
but he died before trial.

501
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:26,141
What's this about, Sam?

502
00:24:26,446 --> 00:24:29,001
Oh, just-- you know me--

503
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,761
catching up on current events.

504
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:32,241
That was two years ago.

505
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:34,170
Yeah. I know. I know.

506
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,311
Welly, welly, welly, well,

507
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:38,181
look who's stalking me now.

508
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:41,490
Andi and I are going to the movies,
and you're not invited.

509
00:24:43,286 --> 00:24:46,570
Oh, that is quite the bag o'
batteries you got there, Josie.

510
00:24:46,606 --> 00:24:48,111
Feeling a little
lonely these days?

511
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:49,581
We're having
blackouts, jackass.

512
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:50,980
They're for my flashlight.

513
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:52,613
And if I was lonely for you,

514
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:54,131
I'd just get a pencil.

515
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:55,883
Oh, that's what they
all say, sweetheart.

516
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,281
Wait. Wait, wait.

517
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:58,952
Tell Andi I'll be in the car.

518
00:24:58,988 --> 00:25:00,192
Wait. That's--

519
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,842
what she is
insinuating is that--

520
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:05,151
- And it's not...
- It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.

521
00:25:05,197 --> 00:25:06,222
Come on.

522
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:12,300
You know,
I think I figured this guy out.

523
00:25:12,326 --> 00:25:13,850
He's just pissed off
people are taking

524
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:15,603
- his name off of buildings.
- Nice.

525
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:17,802
You know,
maybe donating money was the only

526
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:20,010
- good thing the guy ever did.
- Sweet. Can I try now?

527
00:25:20,048 --> 00:25:21,401
Sam, I think I found him.

528
00:25:25,015 --> 00:25:27,472
Power outages have
affected a large area.

529
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:31,323
- That's him. Let's go.
- No. Wait.

530
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:33,321
First, we got to
protect ourselves.

531
00:25:34,206 --> 00:25:35,670
Sporting goods.

532
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,451
Hoods.

533
00:25:59,577 --> 00:26:02,440
- I feel like a giant condom.
- Let's do this.

534
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:12,881
What's he doing?

535
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:21,113
I think he's fueling up
for a lightning strike.

536
00:26:21,516 --> 00:26:23,091
There's nobody up here to kill.

537
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:24,601
Except us.

538
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:25,872
Point taken.

539
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,211
No. I don't think he's
here to strike us.

540
00:26:28,277 --> 00:26:30,472
I think he's here to
take out the whole dam.

541
00:26:44,255 --> 00:26:45,511
You ready to rock?

542
00:26:45,886 --> 00:26:47,453
Ready as I'll ever be.

543
00:26:47,788 --> 00:26:49,130
We'll attack from the rear.

544
00:26:49,265 --> 00:26:51,362
With any luck,
he won't know what hit him.

545
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:00,493
So, that happened.

546
00:27:15,488 --> 00:27:17,113
Who are you?

547
00:27:21,355 --> 00:27:23,731
I'm the devil's bounty hunter,

548
00:27:23,748 --> 00:27:25,520
and I'm here to
send your ass back

549
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:27,620
- to hell where you belong.
- Nice bluff.

550
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:29,661
The devil has a boun hunter?

551
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:32,922
You want to do this the easy
way or the hard way, huh?

552
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:35,461
- Come on! Come on!
- Ok. Don't oversell it.

553
00:27:39,387 --> 00:27:42,271
God, we're gonna die
dressed as condoms.

554
00:27:42,598 --> 00:27:44,593
- That's the truth.
- And I'm not alone.

555
00:27:45,835 --> 00:27:48,541
Uh, guys? I'm not alone, guys!

556
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:02,932
Yes! Yes! Yeah.

557
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:04,591
We're alive. We're not dead.

558
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:08,003
He got away, but we made it.

559
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:08,912
Are you crazy?

560
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:11,011
The vessel was broken.
What were you thinking?

561
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:12,182
I don't know.

562
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:15,042
We dressed up like
idiots for nothing.

563
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:16,582
I don't look like an idiot.

564
00:28:16,615 --> 00:28:17,910
No. You don't. You look good.

565
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:19,682
We look good.

566
00:28:27,717 --> 00:28:29,162
Look at that badass.

567
00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:33,711
What are you talking about?

568
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:35,703
You, man. You--

569
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,231
The way you faced
off with that soul.

570
00:28:39,156 --> 00:28:41,662
"Are we gonna do
this hard or easy?"

571
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,262
Ooh, I got chills, seriously.

572
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:46,501
Well, I don't know
what story you got,

573
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,240
but the guy got away.

574
00:28:48,516 --> 00:28:50,710
Well, but the important
thing is you owned it.

575
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:52,992
Oh, you're beginning to
get the hang of this.

576
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:56,630
Oh, now,
that doesn't look too good, Sammy.

577
00:28:57,667 --> 00:29:00,161
Didn't you ever do model
kits when you were a kid?

578
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:01,840
- Probably not.
- Yeah.

579
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:03,361
Well, I need a new one.

580
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:05,301
Well, now that
could be a problem.

581
00:29:05,337 --> 00:29:06,700
There are a lot of
forms to fill out.

582
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:08,561
Usually takes 3 weeks to
fill a vessel request.

583
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:10,040
Well, how am I supposed
to capture him?

584
00:29:10,075 --> 00:29:11,641
Ah, I think you'll
figure it out.

585
00:29:11,678 --> 00:29:13,271
I'm not worried
about it at all.

586
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,260
Oh, one other little thing.

587
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:19,453
You sort of tipped off that
soul you're trying to capture,

588
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:21,531
and he's sort of after you now.

589
00:29:22,818 --> 00:29:24,033
Just a heads up.

590
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:30,102
All right,
so what should we do?

591
00:29:30,428 --> 00:29:31,821
We hunker down, cowboy up,

592
00:29:32,257 --> 00:29:33,941
and fight the bastard
till he's back in hell,

593
00:29:33,975 --> 00:29:35,160
where he belongs.

594
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,011
Or we could run
like little girls.

595
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:41,893
That's my vote.

596
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:51,920
Is that bad? Is that bad?

597
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:02,480
Had to be a hybrid.

598
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:05,601
Take to the store!
Back to the store!

599
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,590
Sammy, come on!

600
00:30:15,257 --> 00:30:16,390
Come on!

601
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,681
I take it back.

602
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:29,251
Your car is definitely
not a chick car.

603
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,801
And it's trying to kill us.

604
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:32,073
I know. That's what I'm saying.

605
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:33,221
Hey, phone is out.

606
00:30:33,238 --> 00:30:34,723
I can't open the doors,

607
00:30:34,737 --> 00:30:36,220
and I think the security
locks are shorted out.

608
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,620
We're trapped.

609
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,731
All right. It's fixed.

610
00:30:39,326 --> 00:30:41,230
- What is that?
- It's the truck.

611
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:43,412
- Oh, yeah. Nice job.
- Will it work?

612
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:49,390
- Let's find out.
- Yeah. All right.

613
00:31:05,378 --> 00:31:06,740
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

614
00:31:07,025 --> 00:31:08,210
He's gotten inside.

615
00:31:08,517 --> 00:31:10,103
That said, how are we supposed

616
00:31:10,116 --> 00:31:11,383
to use the vessel if
we can't see him?

617
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:12,873
I don't know.

618
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:30,780
I'm hit!

619
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:34,612
I don't want to
die at the bench.

620
00:31:40,978 --> 00:31:42,223
Pull it out. Pull it out.

621
00:31:42,265 --> 00:31:44,303
Pull it out! Pull it out.

622
00:31:45,127 --> 00:31:47,150
- Why are you laughing?
- I'm sorry.

623
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:49,351
Cut it out because you're
making me mad, ok?

624
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:51,462
He can't help it.
Sock laughs when he gets nervous.

625
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:53,093
He can't control it.
Sock! Stop!

626
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:54,261
It's gonna be ok, ok?

627
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:56,393
- All right. All right.
- Ok, ok.

628
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:58,661
- Sam, wait, wait, wait.
- Oh, pull!

629
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:08,331
I'm sorry I dragged
you guys into this.

630
00:32:08,898 --> 00:32:12,141
- Hey, it's ok, Sam.
- No, it's not.

631
00:32:12,507 --> 00:32:14,640
The devil said it was up to me.
I'm the one in hell.

632
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:16,431
I'm the one that
has to keep going.

633
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:19,370
Hey, maybe it's the blood loss,
but I'm not following you.

634
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:24,741
I'll be right back, ok?

635
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:26,710
Hey, you need the vessel.

636
00:32:32,275 --> 00:32:35,751
No. I'm not gonna need that.

637
00:32:37,996 --> 00:32:39,593
What do you think
he's gonna do?

638
00:32:47,736 --> 00:32:49,161
Coming out!

639
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:20,333
Arthur Ferrey!

640
00:33:40,826 --> 00:33:44,403
You're not sending me back!

641
00:33:44,776 --> 00:33:47,081
You can't keep killing
innocent people!

642
00:33:47,975 --> 00:33:49,591
They took away my name.

643
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:54,112
They took away every
good thing I ever did.

644
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:55,681
No, they didn't.

645
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,483
You did it to yourself.

646
00:33:57,815 --> 00:33:59,862
You destroyed people's lives.

647
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:02,660
Everyone will pay,

648
00:34:03,326 --> 00:34:06,791
and you can't stop me.

649
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:14,911
What's that?

650
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,002
I believe it's called
a lightning rod.

651
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:28,661
Oh, god...

652
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:36,400
I did it.

653
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:38,851
I did it.

654
00:34:39,716 --> 00:34:42,392
I did it. I did it.

655
00:34:53,998 --> 00:34:56,640
Well, hello.
We meet again, Gladys.

656
00:34:57,117 --> 00:34:59,320
Place the vessel on the mat.

657
00:35:01,155 --> 00:35:03,601
What's it like working in
the portal to hell, huh?

658
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:05,891
Must be a lot of wack jobs,
a lot of weirdos.

659
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:08,003
This isn't the entire vessel.

660
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:10,161
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, right.

661
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:12,353
Got some vessel in
the old pockets.

662
00:35:12,668 --> 00:35:14,001
The fact that you two

663
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:16,763
haven't been killed
yet astonishes me.

664
00:35:17,377 --> 00:35:19,341
All right.
Well, thanks, Gladys.

665
00:35:22,716 --> 00:35:23,930
That's mine.

666
00:35:30,718 --> 00:35:32,193
You got to be kidding me.

667
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:33,663
Here we go.

668
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:35,612
You wrecked the
new car already?

669
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:37,422
It's not wrecked,
just the window.

670
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:39,503
- I can't believe this.
- Ok. What is wrong?

671
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,991
Mom, I just want you to know

672
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,150
I would never treat a
car the way Sam does.

673
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:46,021
I would never just throw
away such a generous gift,

674
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:49,090
you know,
if I should be so lucky to get one.

675
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:51,051
Thank you, Kyle.
That's very nice.

676
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:53,422
I'm sure if you ask Sam nicely,
every once in a while,

677
00:35:53,468 --> 00:35:55,110
he'd be happy to
give you a ride.

678
00:35:55,257 --> 00:35:56,893
If you say please.

679
00:35:57,217 --> 00:35:58,713
Say pretty please.

680
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:01,213
You should try not to
torture your brother.

681
00:36:02,446 --> 00:36:06,262
Yeah. No. I--

682
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,190
Mom, look. I--

683
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:13,890
I've been working for the
devil as a bounty hunter

684
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:15,913
for souls that get out of hell,

685
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:17,592
and I lied to you
because I thought that

686
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:19,213
that's what you'd want to hear,

687
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:21,153
and I'm really sorry.

688
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:28,440
Sam, I just wanted
to hear the truth.

689
00:36:28,707 --> 00:36:29,991
That's it.

690
00:36:30,296 --> 00:36:31,960
- Thank you for telling me.
- Ok.

691
00:36:32,265 --> 00:36:33,671
I think we've all lived

692
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:35,691
with this secret
for far too long,

693
00:36:35,898 --> 00:36:37,292
and that's probably the good

694
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:39,412
that's going to come out
of this whole thing--

695
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,592
- No more secrets.
- No more secrets.

696
00:36:44,138 --> 00:36:45,941
Except let's not
tell your brother.

697
00:36:46,217 --> 00:36:47,252
Definitely.

698
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:50,613
I am so very,
very disappointed in you, Sam.

699
00:36:51,096 --> 00:36:53,733
I gave you responsibility.
I gave you a task,

700
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:55,992
and this is how you
repay my confidence?

701
00:36:57,277 --> 00:36:58,481
I'm sorry.

702
00:36:59,026 --> 00:37:00,920
So, can you offer me a
plausible explanation

703
00:37:00,956 --> 00:37:04,032
as to why the store looks
like a bomb went off?

704
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:06,601
Not really.

705
00:37:07,286 --> 00:37:09,632
So, you'll stand by Bert
Wysocki's assertion

706
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:11,880
that you were attacked
by ninjas last night.

707
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:16,531
I think sometimes...

708
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:21,013
Bert has really vivid
dreams when he's awake,

709
00:37:21,337 --> 00:37:22,720
and I think that
that was probably--

710
00:37:22,755 --> 00:37:24,441
Sam,

711
00:37:24,997 --> 00:37:28,452
the secret to success
is to be ready

712
00:37:28,808 --> 00:37:30,801
when an opportunity
presents itself.

713
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:32,923
Yeah, that's what
that says right--

714
00:37:33,495 --> 00:37:36,421
What I'm trying to say is that
you've reached a new low.

715
00:37:37,865 --> 00:37:40,013
What do you want me
to do about that?

716
00:37:40,336 --> 00:37:42,612
- Fire me.
- Or I could teach you...

717
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:45,260
which is exactly
what I intend to do.

718
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:48,032
Little perspiration
might do you some good,

719
00:37:48,336 --> 00:37:49,820
some dirt under the nails,

720
00:37:50,177 --> 00:37:52,992
you're off the midnight
shift onto garbage duty.

721
00:37:53,586 --> 00:37:55,220
- Ok.
- Yep.

722
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:15,612
You missed a candy wrapper.

723
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:19,281
Oh, come on, Sammy.

724
00:38:19,886 --> 00:38:21,692
Turn that frown upside down.

725
00:38:22,056 --> 00:38:23,301
You're a hero, man.

726
00:38:23,646 --> 00:38:24,802
You put a soul in hell.

727
00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:26,633
How does that feel, huh?

728
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:28,663
Pure,
unadulterated satisfaction.

729
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:31,472
All the money and in
the world can't compare.

730
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:33,582
What's so satisfying about it?

731
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:35,441
I'm banished to garbage duty,

732
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:37,182
and I've got two jobs I hate.

733
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:38,773
Well, truth is,

734
00:38:39,187 --> 00:38:41,021
I've already done you a solid.

735
00:38:41,395 --> 00:38:43,342
I've been meddling
with Ted's schedule,

736
00:38:43,418 --> 00:38:45,313
and I got you off
the garbage duty.

737
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:46,893
Happy?

738
00:38:47,196 --> 00:38:48,880
Garden center. Great.

739
00:38:49,147 --> 00:38:50,221
Thanks to you,

740
00:38:50,238 --> 00:38:52,483
I get to shovel manure
for the next 10 hours.

741
00:38:52,486 --> 00:38:54,131
Oh, that's the
bitter wit I love.

742
00:38:54,305 --> 00:38:55,732
Sock it to me, Sammy.

743
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,880
What are you doing here?

744
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:24,443
Oh, I got in trouble.

745
00:39:25,287 --> 00:39:26,572
What happened?

746
00:39:27,405 --> 00:39:30,030
Me and Ted got
into an argument,

747
00:39:30,976 --> 00:39:33,481
and I allegedly hit him
in the back of the head

748
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:35,400
with a pint of latex paint.

749
00:39:35,715 --> 00:39:36,701
Andi...

750
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:38,482
What? Allegedly.

751
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:40,262
There were no witnesses.

752
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:42,862
Well, that's probably why
he didn't press charges.

753
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:44,373
Yeah. Well...

754
00:39:44,697 --> 00:39:46,600
At least we're in
hell together, right?

755
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:48,111
What?

756
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:49,881
Hell, you know? This sucks?

757
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:51,870
Oh, yes.

758
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:08,312
