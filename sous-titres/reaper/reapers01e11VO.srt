1
00:00:01,123 --> 00:00:02,525
Is this a carjacking?

2
00:00:02,645 --> 00:00:05,275
- Are you carjacking me?
- I'm the devil.

3
00:00:06,896 --> 00:00:09,537
Before you were born, your mom
and I sold your soul to the devil.

4
00:00:09,657 --> 00:00:11,681
- You gonna tell Andi?
- I'm not gonna tell Andi!

5
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:14,104
If she knows,
she'll never go out with me.

6
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:16,116
You could make her go out with you,
Damien.

7
00:00:16,236 --> 00:00:18,870
You're just gonna bring escaped souls
back to hell. That's cool, right?

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,664
- How am I supposed to capture 'em?
- This will help...

9
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:24,526
a vessel, hand-crafted
in the bowels of perdition

10
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:26,540
by the iniquitous and the vile.

11
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:28,426
- That'll work.
- A word of caution...

12
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:29,965
I don't accept failure.

13
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:32,487
You finally found the one thing
that you're good at.

14
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,953
You sent an escaped soul back to hell.

15
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:39,510
- Come on, come on.
- All right!

16
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,190
Those are huge on you.

17
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:43,430
- All right, feel that?
- Nope, not a thing.

18
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:44,863
This is gonna work great.

19
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:48,211
- All right! Now run, rabbit.
- All right, wait, give me a head start.

20
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:49,603
Steady...

21
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:51,713
Oh, Sock!

22
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:54,282
- Below the waist!
- What did you say?

23
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:56,791
Say... let's try again. Here, here.

24
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:01,170
This 2 pants thing doesn't work!

25
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:03,242
You sure about that?
Let's try again here.

26
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:05,563
Sock, you're makin'me mad!

27
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:07,202
Wait, wait.

28
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:11,961
Oh, my god, mom!

29
00:01:12,088 --> 00:01:14,431
- You're back!
- Hi, sweetheart!

30
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,650
Oh, ribs, sweetie! Ribs, ribs.

31
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,103
Oh, sorry. How was Vegas?

32
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:22,110
Mom,
did you see me shoot Ben in the butt?

33
00:01:22,235 --> 00:01:23,562
I did. Good shootin', Bert.

34
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:26,071
- Very good shot.
- Hey, Ms. Wysocki.

35
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:30,511
Um, mom... Who's the, uh, cowboy?

36
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,592
Um, Bert,
there's something I have to tell you.

37
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,373
Uh, this is Morris.

38
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,603
And we have some wonderful news.

39
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:55,842
Will you stop checking the time?
Am I that boring?

40
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,951
No, I told you
I have to leave in 10 minutes.

41
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,602
I'm gonna be super late.
And it's definitely not boring.

42
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:02,970
I'll tell you when 10 minutes is up.

43
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:06,423
What...

44
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:11,671
Hey, what?

45
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:14,650
Oh, my gosh, this is beautiful!

46
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:18,762
You were gonna give it to me
as a present? That is so sweet!

47
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:21,112
Yeah. Yeah, you... you like it?

48
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:24,162
I love it. It's perfect. Put it on.

49
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,220
There you go.

50
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:33,592
Oh! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

51
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,451
- What's up?
- Sock, what are you doing?

52
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:43,553
I need you to get rid of this, OK?

53
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:45,403
Sock, are you all right?

54
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,561
My mom came home from Vegas today.

55
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:51,273
You shot your mom with a BB gun?

56
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:53,510
No, Sam, of course not.

57
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:57,220
I might have shot an Asian cowboy,
though.

58
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:58,193
What?

59
00:02:58,317 --> 00:03:00,473
Yeah.
And I think I punched him in the eye.

60
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:02,920
I don't know. It's all a big blur.

61
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:09,323
- Will you rub my head?
- Yeah.

62
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:13,232
Thank you. That feels good.

63
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:15,502
Sock, what the hell is going on?

64
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:17,740
My mom get married.

65
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:21,052
And now I have nobody,
except for you two.

66
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:27,043
Would somebody get me a six pack?

67
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,791
It's what my mom would have done.

68
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:34,902
Season 1, Episode 11 - Hungry for Fame
For www.forom.com

69
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,580
Oh, hey, you're up.

70
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:46,083
Sock,

71
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:49,522
why is my alarm clock going off
at 4:30 in the morning?

72
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:51,573
Yeah, I couldn't sleep, either.

73
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,841
But, um, since we're both awake,
do you want to talk?

74
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,253
Do we have to do this now?

75
00:03:57,376 --> 00:04:00,441
Can you believe she married
a guy named Morris?

76
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:01,802
Morris, Sam.

77
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:04,962
I mean, I don't even think
he's a real cowboy.

78
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:06,713
You know, I mean,

79
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:08,990
how long has she even known this guy,
a week?

80
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:11,253
Now she's going to shack up
with a total stranger.

81
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:12,910
Yeah, good idea, mom.

82
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:15,342
She's absolutely going to regret this.

83
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:19,283
Oh, blue tie.
Definitely better than the red.

84
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:23,312
Sometimes, if you love somebody enough,

85
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:25,720
you have got to let them
hit rock bottom.

86
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:29,691
Even though I might want to kick
Morris' ass to the curb right now,

87
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:31,552
I'm not gonna do it.

88
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:34,433
I'm gonna stand strong,
and I'm gonna be firm.

89
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:35,551
Hello?

90
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:38,251
You know, my mom and I are a team,

91
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:41,371
and teammates do not go out and
get married behind each other's backs.

92
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:42,802
That's one thing I know.

93
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:46,792
So I'm gonna take the one thing
away from her she loves the most... me.

94
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:49,873
I'm not gonna move back in
until she admits she made a mistake.

95
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:52,173
I can't do it.

96
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:54,411
I can't work. I'm too upset.

97
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:58,420
Sock, come on, it'll be good for you.
It'll take your mind off of things.

98
00:04:58,587 --> 00:05:00,231
OK, but I need a push.

99
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:06,720
Sam, I am a wall of misery, all right?

100
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:09,601
You're gonna have to do
a little better than that. Let's go.

101
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:14,231
Sock?!

102
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:17,732
Oh, my god, Sock, are you OK?

103
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:19,820
Hey, did you just fly in here?

104
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:21,862
Sam moved me with his mind.

105
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:24,430
The devil must be screwing with me.

106
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:26,622
What do you think it means?

107
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:29,223
It might have something
to do with the soul.

108
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:30,342
That...

109
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,693
was wicked.

110
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:34,580
Let's do it again.
Ben, help me with the tree.

111
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:36,491
Sam, get back over there.

112
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:42,713
Hey, do you know where Sock is?

113
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:44,591
I need him to fake a seizure for me.

114
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:46,302
That is an unusual request.

115
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:48,772
Yeah, well, Ted saw Sock fall
into the Christmas tree.

116
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,973
He's terrified of
a workman's comp lawsuit.

117
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:53,273
Terrified Ted is always a good time.

118
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:56,350
- Sock's in house wares.
- Great, thank you.

119
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:17,503
There's something about the sea air.

120
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:19,013
- You know?
- Yeah.

121
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:21,800
Maybe it's because
all of life came from the sea.

122
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:24,302
It's primordial. Clean, fresh.

123
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:26,871
And almost entirely covers up the stench

124
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:28,802
of that decomposing corpse down there.

125
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:34,390
- Who is that?
- A vagrant, I think.

126
00:06:34,856 --> 00:06:36,401
No one of consequence.

127
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:37,890
Where's its head?

128
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,161
Removed,

129
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:40,860
and partially eaten

130
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:43,011
by one Phillip Carmona.

131
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,111
Hell's latest overachiever.

132
00:06:46,328 --> 00:06:47,612
- Eaten?
- Yeah.

133
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:50,372
In life, Carmona was a cannibal.

134
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:53,400
Had a predilection for eating the brains

135
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:54,673
and the heart.

136
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:02,782
- So the soul ate its heart, too?
- No, I don't think so.

137
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:04,800
He got scared away.

138
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:08,380
Look, he always finishes his meals
and he always eats at night.

139
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:10,793
Now you just follow the corpse,
you'll find your soul.

140
00:07:10,915 --> 00:07:12,550
Excuse me a moment.

141
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:24,480
What's up?

142
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:29,453
You're gonna be sorry
when I'm famous, Rachel.

143
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:31,700
Rachel, how can you date an accountant?

144
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:33,626
- Great titles, man.
- Thanks.

145
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:35,385
They're about my ex.

146
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:36,707
Her name was Rachel.

147
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,133
Really? Not a nice girl, I take it.

148
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,000
She left me for following my dream,

149
00:07:41,238 --> 00:07:42,973
the dream of rock and roll.

150
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,800
You're probably drinking
a lot more than usual.

151
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:48,092
You gotta numb the pain, bro.

152
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:50,001
Jerry Belvedere.

153
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:52,363
A&R for popblast records.

154
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:56,802
Ryan Milner. My stage name's Ryan.

155
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:59,150
- No last name.
- Ryan.

156
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:01,643
You know, Ryan,
I bet you and I can make a deal

157
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:04,240
that'll be extremely beneficial
to the both of us.

158
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:07,111
Mr. Belvedere,
can I talk to you for a second?

159
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:16,663
What are you doing?

160
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:18,721
What does it look like?

161
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,583
You're setting that guy up
so you can buy his soul.

162
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:22,873
Duh, Sam.

163
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:26,040
Come on, just leave him alone.
He's pathetic enough as it is!

164
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:28,801
Oh, wow, Sammy, maybe you're right.

165
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:30,511
If I'm hearing you correctly,

166
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:34,170
you're basically calling me
a morally bankrupt, evil being.

167
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:36,310
Yes, more or less.

168
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:38,142
Then this makes perfect sense.

169
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:05,923
Hey, uh, I gotta get going.

170
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,210
Wait, wait, wait, is that her? Cady?

171
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:12,010
Yeah, yeah, she's just...
We're gonna hang out.

172
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,550
Oh, OK, well, bring her over here.
What's the big deal?

173
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:16,640
I mean, we're friends, right?

174
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,620
So, why can't I meet your girlfriend?

175
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:20,880
I mean, unless
you're trying to hide her from me.

176
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,811
- Why would I do that?
- Too late.

177
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:25,360
- Hi, cutie!
- Hey.

178
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:27,312
- Hi, I'm Cady.
- Hi.

179
00:09:28,646 --> 00:09:29,832
Uh, Andi.

180
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,450
I've heard a lot about you.

181
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:35,200
- Yeah, all good things.
- Oh, good to hear.

182
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:37,200
That's a nice necklace.

183
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:39,470
Oh, thank you. Sam got it for me.

184
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:42,793
Yeah, actually,
he showed it to me... once.

185
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:47,962
Andi used to play soccer in high school,
like you.

186
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:50,921
- You guys... did that...
- Well, enjoy your lunch.

187
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,400
And your necklace.

188
00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:56,293
She hates me.

189
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:59,820
- No, she doesn't hate you.
- Come on, Sam, it's obvious.

190
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:01,693
Did you guys have a thing?

191
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:03,602
Yeah... Let's sit down.

192
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:10,691
All right, this... this is my fault.

193
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,592
All right, the necklace you're wearing

194
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:15,380
was actually one
I had originally bought for her.

195
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:17,952
When?

196
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,743
- Uh, a few weeks ago?
- And then you gave it to me?

197
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:25,011
Yeah, but to be fair,
I didn't plan on giving it to you.

198
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:28,080
I... I just, I got caught when you found
it and I made a rash decision. I...

199
00:10:28,437 --> 00:10:30,081
So why did you keep it?

200
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:32,251
I... I don't have an answer.

201
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:36,192
That's weird, Sam.

202
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:38,740
- Cady...
- Don't follow me.

203
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:49,000
Next time I buy a present for a girl...

204
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:52,801
I need you to punch me
in the junk. Hard.

205
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:56,022
- That's the only way I punch.
- Not now, Sock!

206
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:58,491
- What's the problem?
- Cady's mad at me,

207
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:00,322
Andi's all pissed off. I don't...

208
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:02,002
Will you listen to this guy?

209
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh, wah,
I have 2 chicks fighting over me!

210
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:07,871
What am I gonna do?
Why am I so loveable? Shut up.

211
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:09,251
Enjoy it, Sam.

212
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,732
Or at least, you know,
try and flip it into a three-way.

213
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:14,800
- That's what I'd do.
- Hey, this guy Ryan's pretty lame.

214
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:18,590
This CD is for all the dreamers
who dream of the rock and roll dream,

215
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,563
so dream on.

216
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:22,880
I gotta...
I gotta side with the devil on this one.

217
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,682
- Some people just belong in hell.
- No, I feel bad for him.

218
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:28,880
The devil's gonna sucker him into a deal
and he'll be just as screwed as I am.

219
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:31,741
What can you do? I mean, if the guy
wants to sell his soul to the devil,

220
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:34,183
- it's not your problem.
- But I could at least warn him.

221
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:36,713
If somebody had stepped in
before my parents sold my soul...

222
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:37,761
Whatever.

223
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:40,320
Devil says something
about the soul eating after dark.

224
00:11:40,488 --> 00:11:43,140
- Don't we have to get to the morgue?
- No, we have time. We can stop

225
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:45,410
- at the marina along the way.
- Then can we swing

226
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:48,623
by my mom's house, too?
I kinda want to egg her bedroom window.

227
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:56,632
Well, this is where he was.

228
00:11:56,946 --> 00:11:58,841
Maybe he's playing in another spot.

229
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:02,081
Yeah, but know where?
I mean, we can't look on every corner...

230
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:03,720
I think I know where he might be.

231
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:09,421
Looks like the devil got to him first.

232
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,440
Pike Arena? That's huge.

233
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:17,901
Damn it.

234
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:20,001
Devil said follow the body.

235
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:21,971
Carmona only feeds at night.

236
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:25,851
Pretty good, right?

237
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,241
- Look it.
- Jose Miller. Not bad, yeah.

238
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:30,673
How'd you get Josie
to give you her ID badge?

239
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:33,012
It's part of some memory trinkets
I stole from her.

240
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:36,780
She took so much and gave back
so little. So Jose Miller it is.

241
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:39,093
Well, as long as that thing
gets us into the morgue,

242
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:41,742
- where the body is, who cares?
- It's almost 6:00.

243
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:44,091
We need to be ready
when the soul comes back to feed.

244
00:12:44,218 --> 00:12:46,882
Let's see what we're saddled with
this time.

245
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:53,731
Nice. A spear gun. Very James Bond.

246
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,770
You say this job isn't cool.

247
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:03,282
Evening, lieu-tective.

248
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:06,100
Just gotta get these experts
in for a dental match

249
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:08,032
on a certain Jonathan Deere.

250
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:10,291
All right?

251
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,483
So he always finishes his meal?

252
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:15,822
Yeah, we gotta find the headless body.

253
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:17,891
Which one do you think it is?

254
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:21,503
It's gonna be this one.

255
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:30,360
Yeah, well, Carmona
didn't come back for seconds.

256
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:32,401
Excuse me.

257
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:34,841
What are you doing here?

258
00:13:34,968 --> 00:13:37,940
Oh, uh, we're from, uh, downtown.

259
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:41,100
Downtown branch,
and we're actually taking over the case.

260
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:42,600
It's a jurisdictional thing.

261
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:45,200
- Juris... jurisdictional.
- What case are you talking about?

262
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:47,662
Actually, that is a need to know.

263
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,073
We wish we could do something
about it, but we can't.

264
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:51,440
It's just... whoa.

265
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,120
This ID is expired.

266
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,962
And the picture is pasted on.

267
00:13:57,455 --> 00:13:58,251
What...

268
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:00,901
- Get out of here.
- OK, but could I possibly have

269
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:02,072
the ID back?

270
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:04,300
- I'm calling the police.
- No, I... keep it!

271
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:11,342
I thought you said
that jurisdiction thing always works.

272
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,600
Why do you always have
to point out my flaws, Ben?

273
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:14,931
So what do we do now?

274
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:17,302
We'll just stop the soul
before he ever gets to the body.

275
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:18,751
There's only 2 ways in.

276
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:21,392
Let's seal up the doors
so we know which way Carmona's coming.

277
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:22,543
OK, good one.

278
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,030
All right, come on, Carmona.

279
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,340
Whoa, sorry. Oh! It's my mom.

280
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,890
Hurts, doesn't it?

281
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:38,170
All right, be cool. All right, be cool.

282
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:41,801
You guys, look.

283
00:14:42,325 --> 00:14:44,262
Look, it's him, it's the soul. It's him.

284
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:49,513
Go, go, go!

285
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:56,640
On three! 1, 2, 3!

286
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:02,123
Where is he? Where is he?

287
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:03,960
Oh, damn it!

288
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,850
It's locked, it's locked.

289
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:08,192
Go, go, go.

290
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:30,851
Boy, you spook easily. Huh.

291
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,262
- It's just rubber.
- So it was you, right?

292
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:36,730
Use your words, Sammy. What was me?

293
00:15:36,856 --> 00:15:38,072
This.

294
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,260
- You got Ryan a concert.
- Oh, wow, this came out pretty sharp.

295
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:45,482
Yeah. The umlaut was my idea.

296
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:48,073
- You made him sell you his soul?
- Not yet, but I will.

297
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:50,882
It's a classic
"first taste is free" gambit.

298
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:53,241
Ryan gets his gig, tastes a little fame,

299
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:55,221
and then while
he's on that endorphin high,

300
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:57,163
I slap that contract
right in front of him.

301
00:15:57,327 --> 00:15:59,291
- Never fails.
- That really works?

302
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:01,202
We're talkin'about rock and roll, man.

303
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,890
The devil's music.
Comin'down the crossroads.

304
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:06,252
Sell your soul for rock and roll, baby.

305
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:08,740
It's not funny.
He's gonna spend eternity in hell!

306
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,972
Oh, you're right, you're right.
It's never a laughing matter, Sammy.

307
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,680
But, hey, let's talk about you.

308
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:16,821
What's up with that cannibal of yours?
Why haven't you caught him?

309
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:19,311
- I don't know where he is.
- Talk to the mother.

310
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:22,032
- Carmona has a mom?
- Yep.

311
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:24,180
And you know moms.

312
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:27,461
- They love talkin'about their kids.
- Even when the kid's a people eater?

313
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:29,711
Well, it's just more to talk about.

314
00:16:33,977 --> 00:16:35,280
Hi, Mrs. Carmona.

315
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:38,161
We were wondering
if we could talk to you about your son.

316
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:40,542
Wait, wait, wait, you don't understand!

317
00:16:40,705 --> 00:16:43,082
Why don't you vultures leave me alone!

318
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:45,080
But we're not vultures, Mrs. Carmona.

319
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:48,000
My son didn't do any
of the things they said.

320
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:51,371
- He was a good boy.
- Oh, I'm sure he was.

321
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:53,553
He was our favorite camp counselor.

322
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:02,892
You knew him at Camp Soaring Arrow?

323
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:06,500
Yes, we did know him
at Camp Soaring Arrow.

324
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:09,780
The memories are flooding in.

325
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:13,491
You know, toasting marshmallows
and panty raids and

326
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,272
learning how to use your...

327
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:17,200
- Archery.
- Bow and arrow.

328
00:17:17,488 --> 00:17:18,742
You like my son?

329
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:22,041
Yeah, we thought your son was great.

330
00:17:23,157 --> 00:17:25,851
- Would you boys like some pie?
- Sure.

331
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:31,982
Here's the picture of Phillip
in the school play one Thanksgiving.

332
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:33,312
He's so cute.

333
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,452
- He's the kid dressed in brown?
- Oh, yes.

334
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:37,683
He played gravy.

335
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:42,061
Oh, here he is in the pee wee football.

336
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:44,441
And this is Phillip
in his high school graduation.

337
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,532
Such a sweet boy.

338
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:50,290
- You and your son were close, huh?
- He was my best friend.

339
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,493
That's nice.
That's how it's supposed to be.

340
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:55,703
Yeah, it's true. Yep, you're right.

341
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:58,802
So what was Phillip like away from camp?

342
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,041
Where did he like to go? Was there any
special place he liked to hang out?

343
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,480
- Or hide out, maybe.
- Well, not really.

344
00:18:05,838 --> 00:18:08,060
Mostly he liked to hang out with me.

345
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:14,471
Sometimes right after
the sun goes down, I imagine I see him,

346
00:18:14,638 --> 00:18:18,352
out there at the end of the driveway,
or over in the backyard.

347
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:20,531
The other night,

348
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:24,803
I could have sworn
I saw him sitting on the swing.

349
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:27,032
It seemed so real.

350
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:31,053
Bye bye, Mrs. C. Have a good day.

351
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:32,741
All right.

352
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:35,452
He just comes here
to hang out with his mom.

353
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,142
Well, can you blame the guy?

354
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:40,373
I mean, that... that, my friends,
is a real mom.

355
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:43,712
A beautiful, selfless,
kind-hearted woman

356
00:18:43,837 --> 00:18:46,251
who built her entire life
around her son.

357
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,421
Even though he was
a crazy-assed convicted cannibal.

358
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:51,021
Gets me, right here.

359
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:53,031
Right... right here.

360
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:56,282
Is it... where's your heart?
On the left?

361
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:09,891
OK, Ryan, sound check on mic.

362
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:42,141
- Tommy, how was that?
- Great, Ryan, let's take five.

363
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:45,062
All right. Thank you, gorgeous.

364
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:48,573
- Hey, from the record company, right?
- You're friends with Jerry?

365
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:50,780
Yeah, yeah, that... that's me.

366
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:52,583
- How ya doin'?
- Awesome.

367
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:56,572
Listen, Ryan, did you sign
any contract or make any promises...

368
00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:00,560
I can't believe it. Tomorrow night,
every seat's gonna be filled.

369
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,990
Ryan!
Did you sign anything?

370
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:05,953
What... no, man.
I didn't get any paperwork yet.

371
00:20:06,077 --> 00:20:08,330
But don't worry.
When I do, I'll sign it. No questions.

372
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:10,963
No, no, I'm trying to tell you
to not sign a contract with...

373
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,000
with the record company. Just walk away.

374
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:16,841
- Dude, what are you talkin'about?
- This isn't what you think it is.

375
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:18,520
Did Jerry mention anything about

376
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:21,132
what you might sacrifice for this deal?

377
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,071
But I'll do anything.

378
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:26,682
Jerry is the devil, and he's trying
to get you to sell your soul, OK?

379
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:32,403
Get out of here, man, are you crazy?

380
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:34,692
Think about it!
How did you sell out this entire arena

381
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,062
when nobody's even heard you before?

382
00:20:38,116 --> 00:20:39,110
Maybe...

383
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:43,573
- they like my songs.
- How did they even hear your songs?

384
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,952
I mean, come on, doesn't it bother you
that this all happened so easily?

385
00:20:47,075 --> 00:20:49,113
He's the devil,
and if you go through with this,

386
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:51,172
you're gonna spend eternity
in hell when you die.

387
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:56,171
- Who cares?
- Who car... are you insane?

388
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:58,691
Hey, look.

389
00:20:58,818 --> 00:21:02,451
Yesterday, I was nothing.
My wife left me.

390
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:04,622
My friends thought I was a failure.

391
00:21:04,748 --> 00:21:06,793
But today, I'm a rock star, man.

392
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,400
You got it? I'm a rock star!

393
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:11,401
They were wrong.

394
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:13,401
They were all wrong.

395
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:16,310
I'll worry about my soul when I'm dead.

396
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:36,301
What do you want?

397
00:21:36,427 --> 00:21:39,371
I just wanted to see
if this car had heated seats.

398
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:41,871
I always wanted to try heated seats.

399
00:21:41,998 --> 00:21:44,323
- Please get out of my car.
- Fine, fine.

400
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:47,863
After the way you helped me out
with Ryan, I owe you one, buddy.

401
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:49,261
How did I help you out?

402
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:51,222
Well, you remember when I told you that

403
00:21:51,348 --> 00:21:55,002
that first time is for free gambit
never fails? White lie.

404
00:21:55,755 --> 00:21:59,401
Usually the sticking point
is when I reveal that I'm the devil.

405
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:01,243
You know, that freaks some people out.

406
00:22:01,406 --> 00:22:04,392
But this time I mixed it up
a little bit. See, I had you

407
00:22:04,518 --> 00:22:07,782
deliver the news.
You're utterly unthreatening.

408
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,490
When you say "devil",
it sounds sorta cute.

409
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:15,571
So now that he's over the initial shock,
I can step in and close the deal.

410
00:22:15,697 --> 00:22:17,712
I just wanted to tell you that
I appreciate it.

411
00:22:17,985 --> 00:22:19,733
Just thanks again, buddy.

412
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:39,852
Hey, Josie.

413
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:42,023
You are coming with me.

414
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:44,090
Why were you at the coroner's office?

415
00:22:44,218 --> 00:22:45,893
I got a call from my grandmother.

416
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,900
She thought
my uncle Hector was hit by a car.

417
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:50,951
Turns out, he's OK,
the whole thing was a false alarm.

418
00:22:51,877 --> 00:22:53,021
Write it down.

419
00:22:53,145 --> 00:22:54,373
You guys just

420
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:58,450
happened to go to the morgue
the same night my old ID badge shows up.

421
00:22:58,575 --> 00:23:00,012
Inexplicable, but true.

422
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:02,160
Why would I want to use your ID, Josie?

423
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:03,720
I look nothing like you.

424
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:06,013
Where were you
when you heard about your uncle?

425
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:08,122
I was at Sock's house playing nintendo.

426
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:09,891
- You sure about that?
- Positive.

427
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:11,922
Nintendo at Sock's.
Ben was racking up points.

428
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:14,202
He almost didn't take
the call about uncle Hector.

429
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,383
And you didn't use my ID
to get into the morgue?

430
00:23:16,507 --> 00:23:18,853
Why would I use your ID?
I look nothing like you.

431
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:21,363
I... sorry, I...

432
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,601
Uncle Hector, Nintendo,
I look nothing like you.

433
00:23:25,726 --> 00:23:27,613
- Booya.
- "Booya."

434
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,243
What does that mean?

435
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:30,962
That means you're not gonna fool us

436
00:23:31,085 --> 00:23:32,963
with any of your lawyer
mumbo jumbo legalese.

437
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:34,781
What would I want to trick you about?

438
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:37,363
What is it that you're so excited
to be throwin'in my face?

439
00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:38,482
The truth.

440
00:23:39,338 --> 00:23:41,923
I get very excited about confirming
the truth. It sets me free.

441
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,540
The truth that you three tell
in exactly the same words,

442
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:47,942
- exactly the same way.
- Yep.

443
00:23:54,255 --> 00:23:55,040
Why?

444
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:56,683
I'll find out what you're up to.

445
00:23:57,057 --> 00:23:58,871
Then I'll show you "Boo-yah."

446
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:01,551
Oh, do it.

447
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,852
I dare ya, show me your booya!

448
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,292
- Hey, I wasn't sure you'd come.
- Yeah, me, either.

449
00:24:21,948 --> 00:24:24,693
- Thanks for the flowers.
- Yeah, of course.

450
00:24:31,835 --> 00:24:33,882
I don't know what to say to you, Sam.

451
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:36,251
You don't have to say anything.
I'm a jerk.

452
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:38,183
You saw that necklace and I freaked out.

453
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:40,432
I'm sorry.
I should have just told you the truth.

454
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,802
It wasn't about the necklace, Sam.

455
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,020
What do you mean?

456
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:46,990
Look, I can get over the fact that
you bought a present for another girl.

457
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,942
It's just...
I don't know that you can get over it.

458
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:54,030
Yeah, I can.

459
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,662
It just seems to me like
maybe you still have feelings for Andi.

460
00:24:57,785 --> 00:24:59,630
And if you do, just tell me.

461
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:01,580
Yeah, I'm gonna be sad, but

462
00:25:01,945 --> 00:25:03,921
I'm not a consolation prize.

463
00:25:04,148 --> 00:25:05,140
Cady...

464
00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:07,670
I don't think that about you, all right?

465
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:10,382
I'm with you. Not her, OK?

466
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:14,163
- OK.
- OK?

467
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:24,972
Oh, come on, man. Just answer the phone.

468
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:26,873
It's like 6 times she's called already.

469
00:25:26,998 --> 00:25:27,990
Seven.

470
00:25:28,115 --> 00:25:30,571
Just talk to your mom!
What if she's trying to apologize?

471
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,471
She's not calling to apologize, Sam.

472
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:35,413
All right, she's calling to get me to
accept her dumb decision about Morris.

473
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:36,783
And I don't accept him.

474
00:25:36,948 --> 00:25:39,383
I reject him.
Right, until she rejects him, too,

475
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:42,532
- we got nothin'to talk about.
- What if she never rejects him?

476
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:44,192
I mean, have you thought about that?

477
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:46,143
I mean,
you might not have a choice here.

478
00:25:46,268 --> 00:25:48,462
I do have a choice, Ben.
I have a very good choice.

479
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:50,650
- Sock, what are you doing?
- Starving, Sam.

480
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:53,340
I'm gonna go in there,
I'm gonna talk to Mrs. Carmona.

481
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:56,451
Sweet little Mrs. Carmona,
see if she has any more pie.

482
00:25:58,838 --> 00:26:00,061
What about the soul?

483
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,352
The soul's supposed
to show up any minute now.

484
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,642
Hello? Mrs. Carmona.

485
00:26:08,315 --> 00:26:10,770
Hi, it's Sock. Remember me?

486
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:13,723
I was just, uh,

487
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:17,510
driving by, and I thought
I smelled some of that delicious pi...

488
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,512
Pie?

489
00:26:31,978 --> 00:26:34,563
Oh, no. Mrs. C?

490
00:26:40,696 --> 00:26:41,691
You...

491
00:26:42,357 --> 00:26:46,390
sicko, sociopathic, bastard.

492
00:26:46,745 --> 00:26:48,951
- How could you?
- I was hungry.

493
00:26:49,078 --> 00:26:50,520
All she had was pie.

494
00:26:52,865 --> 00:26:54,112
She loved you...

495
00:26:54,735 --> 00:26:56,030
through everything.

496
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:59,500
She supported you completely!

497
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,261
And you killed her

498
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:05,330
because you didn't want
to eat delicious pie?!

499
00:27:11,938 --> 00:27:12,930
Come here!

500
00:27:18,986 --> 00:27:19,802
No, no!

501
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,972
You could have eaten anyone!

502
00:27:22,095 --> 00:27:25,322
She was loving, and sweet, and
you chewed her up like she was nothing!

503
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:26,440
Nothing!

504
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:04,300
I'll go get a table.

505
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:07,271
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

506
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:10,780
Listen, I should never
have given anyone that necklace.

507
00:28:10,908 --> 00:28:11,992
That was a mistake.

508
00:28:12,115 --> 00:28:14,243
No, listen, I'm the one
that should be apologizing, OK?

509
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:16,852
I was a jerk.
I deliberately provoked that fight, OK?

510
00:28:16,977 --> 00:28:18,862
I should have just... kept my cool.

511
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:22,362
Good. We both can admit
we're awful people.

512
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:24,743
I don't think I'm awful.

513
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:32,213
What was that?

514
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:34,053
Nothing. We just...

515
00:28:34,775 --> 00:28:37,351
cleared up the whole necklace incident.

516
00:28:38,108 --> 00:28:40,350
We're all going to be friends, yay.

517
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:42,011
Do you want to be friends?

518
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,813
'Cause that's not what it sounds like.

519
00:28:43,938 --> 00:28:45,812
You know what, you need to let that go.

520
00:28:45,938 --> 00:28:48,472
He's seeing somebody else.
I'm not getting in the middle of that.

521
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,600
I wouldn't let you get
in the middle of it, Andi.

522
00:28:50,726 --> 00:28:52,250
That just serves as further proof

523
00:28:52,376 --> 00:28:55,311
that we can't trust a word out
of Sam Oliver's mouth.

524
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:57,611
Liars. All three of 'em.

525
00:28:58,187 --> 00:28:59,943
You're just mad 'cause
they outsmarted you.

526
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:02,831
They did not outsmart me.
And I'm not mad.

527
00:29:03,497 --> 00:29:05,101
- I'm furious.
- Yeah.

528
00:29:05,756 --> 00:29:08,850
- Would you look at this?
- Promotional coasters.

529
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:10,961
The devil's really doin'it up.

530
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:12,750
OK, guys, can we get a toast here?

531
00:29:12,915 --> 00:29:14,250
To Mrs. Carmona.

532
00:29:14,705 --> 00:29:17,951
Loving mother who deserved
much better than being eaten.

533
00:29:18,577 --> 00:29:19,810
You're right.

534
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:21,411
You're right.

535
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:25,260
I gotta say,

536
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:26,711
cannibal soul,

537
00:29:27,275 --> 00:29:29,802
scariest soul we've ever captured.
Hands down.

538
00:29:29,928 --> 00:29:31,473
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

539
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:35,253
Cannibal soul vs. fire soul,
fire soul wins every time.

540
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:37,600
Well, maybe from a distance, yeah.

541
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:39,733
But, you know, get them in a cage match,

542
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:42,441
cannibal soul gets in close,
face is gone.

543
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:43,922
OK, cage match.

544
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:48,581
Cannibal soul vs.
crazy dog monster soul.

545
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,581
That's interesting, man. I like that.

546
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,873
And cannibal soul wouldn't eat the dog,
'cause it's a dog, obviously,

547
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:57,003
- and it's not a man, so...
- But, I don't know, Benji.

548
00:29:57,168 --> 00:29:59,210
If I got hungry enough,
I would definitely eat a dog.

549
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:00,511
Would you eat a man?

550
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:02,441
It depends on what man
we're talking about.

551
00:30:02,565 --> 00:30:04,752
I mean, if we're talking about
George Clooney, then, yeah.

552
00:30:04,877 --> 00:30:06,602
Because he's gorgeous and I hate him.

553
00:30:06,728 --> 00:30:09,452
So that proves my point right there.
Scariest soul of all time,

554
00:30:09,577 --> 00:30:11,361
- cannibal soul.
- Yeah, I agree.

555
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:14,030
How bad do you think
he'd scare this guy?

556
00:30:37,146 --> 00:30:39,373
- Doh, Sam!
- Sorry.

557
00:30:39,947 --> 00:30:41,761
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

558
00:30:42,316 --> 00:30:44,051
Come on, come on, come on.

559
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,320
OK, OK, OK. Safety meeting first.

560
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:49,153
Sam, make sure you release
the soul from the vessel.

561
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:51,561
- Sock brings Ryan down here.
- Bet your ass I will.

562
00:30:51,687 --> 00:30:54,010
I'm gonna dangle this bacon.
I'm gonna make sure that guy

563
00:30:54,137 --> 00:30:56,810
turns into a crazy eating thing.
Rock star poops his pants out of fear,

564
00:30:56,936 --> 00:30:59,521
refuses to sign his soul over
to the devil, we all go home happy.

565
00:30:59,648 --> 00:31:01,130
All right, bring it.

566
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,363
Yo, Ry-on.

567
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:42,021
Is that how you say it? Ry-on?

568
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:43,721
- Rian.
- Rian, all right.

569
00:31:43,845 --> 00:31:45,190
Hey, listen, Ryan,

570
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:48,780
I came to the show tonight
with 10 very open-minded young ladies

571
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:52,431
who are just dying
to meet a real star. You.

572
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:54,233
- Well, let's go!
- All right.

573
00:31:54,356 --> 00:31:56,100
There's a star right here!

574
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:57,912
Just under here.

575
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:05,743
Hey, Ryan.

576
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:09,880
Where are... all the open-minded ladies?

577
00:32:10,048 --> 00:32:11,910
We're about to show you
what's going to happen

578
00:32:12,037 --> 00:32:13,702
if you sign your soul away to the devil.

579
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:14,673
You see him?

580
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:17,140
He's actually an escaped soul from hell,
and in a second,

581
00:32:17,305 --> 00:32:19,503
he's going to turn into a monster.

582
00:32:20,016 --> 00:32:21,101
You guys are nuts.

583
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:23,442
- No, whoa, whoa.
- Come on, let me out.

584
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:25,931
Listen to me.
You sign that contract,

585
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:29,703
you're gonna spend the rest
of eternity with monsters like this.

586
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:32,452
- Why isn't he eating the bacon?
- We should have cooked it.

587
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,053
Benji, get it right in his face.

588
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:35,531
You're making us look bad.

589
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:37,520
That's Canadian back bacon!
Don't be a jerk!

590
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:39,751
These people kidnapped me.
You need to call the police.

591
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:42,881
- Shut up, and eat the bacon!
- Hey, hold on, relax.

592
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:45,671
- Everybody just relax, all right?

593
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:48,251
Move out of the way.
- You don't scare me.

594
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:51,391
Performing in front of thousands
of people tonight, now that's scary.

595
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:54,110
By the way, did you catch the show?
I thought it went really good.

596
00:32:54,236 --> 00:32:56,691
- I need you to move.
- Fellas, listen.

597
00:32:57,535 --> 00:33:00,080
Tonight, the audience
and I were like one.

598
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:01,770
We connected.

599
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:04,472
Just like I'm gonna connect with you,
because

600
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:06,542
my music has a simple message...

601
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,610
Oh, sweet muscular Mary!

602
00:33:14,388 --> 00:33:17,113
Oh, my god, my hand!

603
00:33:17,437 --> 00:33:19,480
- My hands!
- Sock, call 9-1-1!

604
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:21,872
I'm gonna go after it!

605
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:25,921
- No, don't... Sammy!
- My hand!

606
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,841
Well, that worked.

607
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:12,673
Hi.

608
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:16,571
Brought you flowers, 'cause...

609
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:21,850
Didn't know what else to get you.
Hey, they put it back on, that's great.

610
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:24,290
Yeah, great.

611
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:28,532
- You... in pain?
- I can't feel my hand, bro.

612
00:34:30,098 --> 00:34:32,101
In here, wreckage.

613
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:34,652
Listen, Ryan, I want to apologize.

614
00:34:34,816 --> 00:34:37,673
Things got way, way out
of hand back there. And I...

615
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:39,322
Dude, what are you talkin'about?

616
00:34:39,447 --> 00:34:41,742
- Your hand.
- I was in shock.

617
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,122
I don't remember
what happened to my hand.

618
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:47,293
I don't remember anything
after the second encore.

619
00:34:47,608 --> 00:34:49,730
Doc says a bear probably chomped it.

620
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:52,553
Listen, Ryan...

621
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,592
About the contract...

622
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:56,630
Dude, I can't even get
Jerry on the phone.

623
00:34:57,065 --> 00:35:00,601
I killed at that concert last night,
and today, nothin'.

624
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:02,973
Like I don't even exist.

625
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:06,373
You're right, man. He is the devil.

626
00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:08,843
Now I got nothin'.

627
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:14,153
Rachel!

628
00:35:15,776 --> 00:35:17,860
- Are you OK?
- What are you doin'here?

629
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:19,531
I called her.

630
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:22,170
You came back? You forgive me?

631
00:35:22,295 --> 00:35:25,411
Actually, I just wanted to make sure
you weren't gonna die or anything.

632
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:26,531
So...

633
00:35:28,065 --> 00:35:28,932
OK.

634
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:31,132
No, wait!

635
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,143
I'm out of the life, baby.

636
00:35:34,447 --> 00:35:36,172
I can't rock out no more.

637
00:35:36,296 --> 00:35:38,553
I don't need crowds
of adoring fans anymore, Rachel.

638
00:35:38,897 --> 00:35:40,140
I just need you.

639
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:41,603
Concert of one.

640
00:35:41,898 --> 00:35:44,531
I just don't know
if I can believe you, Ryan.

641
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:46,231
You've told me a thousand times

642
00:35:46,356 --> 00:35:48,222
you were gonna give up
rock and roll for me.

643
00:35:48,348 --> 00:35:51,363
Yeah, but now I have
no feelings in 4 out of my 5 fingers.

644
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:55,652
- Really?
- Yeah.

645
00:35:56,175 --> 00:35:57,862
- Really numb?
- Bear chomp.

646
00:36:15,765 --> 00:36:17,260
- Mum.
- Bert.

647
00:36:18,147 --> 00:36:19,701
- Morris.
- Howdy.

648
00:36:20,426 --> 00:36:22,032
I'm just gonna get this all out, OK?

649
00:36:22,156 --> 00:36:23,601
Cards on the table.

650
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:29,060
I may... have reacted poorly... before.

651
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:33,391
I thought that you were being impulsive
by getting married,

652
00:36:33,716 --> 00:36:35,861
and I wanted you to see
that you were making a mistake.

653
00:36:36,216 --> 00:36:38,570
OK, but now I can see that maybe

654
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:42,992
that is something you need to be happy.

655
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:46,452
So I am willing to accept Morris

656
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,132
into this family...

657
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:50,881
and forgive you

658
00:36:52,016 --> 00:36:54,480
for marrying him without my blessing.

659
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:57,133
- OK?
- Thank you, bert.

660
00:36:57,756 --> 00:37:00,633
Great. All right,
let me go unpack my schnibs.

661
00:37:00,795 --> 00:37:02,342
Oh, Bert, you can't unpack.

662
00:37:02,506 --> 00:37:04,723
No, I have to.
I have a ton of laundry for you to do.

663
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:05,963
No, Bert...

664
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:09,062
Only Morris and I are going
to live here now.

665
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,851
- What?
- Bert,

666
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:13,411
- you're a man now.
- Yes.

667
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:14,563
You're 25.

668
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:16,310
You need to leave the nest.

669
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:18,401
No, mom,
that is not you talking right now.

670
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,113
That is him, all right?
You are not my dad, guy!

671
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:23,182
This isn't Morris talking.

672
00:37:23,837 --> 00:37:26,282
Now, this time apart has made me realize

673
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:30,161
that we'd both be happier
if there was some distance between us.

674
00:37:30,325 --> 00:37:33,673
It's hard, but I know
it's what's best for us.

675
00:37:33,846 --> 00:37:35,753
It's what's best for you.

676
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:37,881
You listen to me.

677
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:40,432
I am going to go into my room

678
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:43,002
and give you a few minutes to cool off.

679
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:44,880
When I return,

680
00:37:45,007 --> 00:37:47,653
you'll have come back
to your crazy senses.

681
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,922
You turned my room
into a pottery studio?

682
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:09,122
- Hi.
- Hi.

683
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,021
- Oh, um, sorry.
- No, no, no problem.

684
00:38:12,146 --> 00:38:14,891
OK. Thank you.

685
00:38:15,018 --> 00:38:17,480
Uh, Sam said you wanted to talk to me.

686
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:18,901
Yeah, listen,

687
00:38:19,287 --> 00:38:21,840
I just feel like you and
I got off on the wrong foot,

688
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,183
and, I don't know,
I kinda feel like I'm getting this...

689
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:26,052
vibe, I guess from you, like,

690
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:28,351
who is this chick hanging out
with my friend Sam?

691
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:31,451
I don't blame you,
'cause... 'cause you don't know me.

692
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:33,303
Right...

693
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:36,352
So let me tell you this story.
When I was in high school,

694
00:38:36,478 --> 00:38:39,321
I had this boyfriend,
and we were madly in love.

695
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:42,653
And then he suddenly dumped me
for this other girl.

696
00:38:42,776 --> 00:38:44,282
Totally broke my heart.

697
00:38:44,685 --> 00:38:45,680
So I...

698
00:38:45,808 --> 00:38:47,412
Well, I didn't take it very well.

699
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:50,682
Yeah, I got this giant knife
and I went to this girl's house

700
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:55,143
and was gonna find her, but she wasn't
there, so I just slashed her tires.

701
00:38:56,118 --> 00:38:57,582
But I've been through therapy,

702
00:38:57,747 --> 00:39:01,252
and I have found a way
to control my emotions, pretty much.

703
00:39:01,957 --> 00:39:05,483
So anyway, hope that lets you know
a little bit more about me.

704
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:06,850
And one of these days,

705
00:39:06,975 --> 00:39:09,392
I'd really like to hear one
of your stories.

706
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:17,890
There you go.

707
00:39:19,248 --> 00:39:20,883
Hey, big shot.

708
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:22,982
Hey.

709
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:24,202
That's you,

710
00:39:24,588 --> 00:39:25,891
Mr. Big shot.

711
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,513
Feelin'pretty good about yourself, huh?

712
00:39:28,637 --> 00:39:32,081
- You really put one over on me.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

713
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,622
Oh, Ryan's soul.

714
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:35,412
I had it all lined up.

715
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:39,302
Primed to take it, then you stole it
right out from under me.

716
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:41,271
You beat me to the punch.

717
00:39:41,608 --> 00:39:44,713
I underestimated you, Sammy. Big time.

718
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:47,642
You're quite the sly fox.

719
00:39:49,857 --> 00:39:51,163
Oh, come on.

720
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,002
I know you want to gloat
about it right now.

721
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:56,261
Admit it. I won't be mad.

722
00:40:00,786 --> 00:40:02,630
Yeah, it feels pretty good.

723
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:04,142
Send an evil soul to hell,

724
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:06,151
save a good soul from being damned,
I like it.

725
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:08,080
Yeah, there you go, see?

726
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:10,563
Plus, you got the best of me.

727
00:40:11,747 --> 00:40:13,872
Now, don't tell me
that doesn't give you a rush.

728
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:15,583
Yeah, it does.

729
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:18,533
I guess you can't win 'em all.

730
00:40:18,658 --> 00:40:21,302
Oh, yeah. I guess not.

731
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:54,870
You said you wouldn't be mad!

732
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:57,000
No, this isn't me mad, Sam.

733
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,800
This is me disappointed.

734
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:04,853
You should see me when I'm mad.

735
00:41:05,976 --> 00:41:07,603
It's really something.

736
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:09,391
Thanks to Raceman for the transcript
