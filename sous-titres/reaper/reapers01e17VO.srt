1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,300
GARFIELD.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,600
HEATHCLIFF.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,000
GARFIELD.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
HEATHCLIFF.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,800
MY GOD,MAN,ARE YOU
DEAF,DUMB,AND BLIND?

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,600
GARFIELD IS,BY FAR,AMERICA'S
FAVORITE FAT CAT.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,100
IT'S A MATTER OF TASTE.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,100
I FIND HEATHCLIFF CHARMING.

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,100
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,500
STILL HAVING THE GREAT DEBATE?

11
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,400
GARFIELD.

12
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,500
WELL,JUST SO YOU KNOW,THE
STORE'S BEEN CLOSED FOR AN HOUR.

13
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,300
WHAT?

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,400
I'VE DONE ALL YOUR CLOSE-OUT WORK
AND YOU'RE BOTH BUYING ME BEER.

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,700
FINE.

16
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,500
THIS DISCUSSION IS TABLED
UNTIL WE GET TO THE BAR,

17
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,100
WHERE SAMUEL WILL MODERATE.

18
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,200
YEAH,GREAT. JUST
LET ME GET MY JACKET.

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,700
AH,THERE HE IS.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
LOOKING SHARP,MAN.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,100
YOU DON'T THINK MAYBE YOU COULD
HAVE TAKEN THE APRON OFF THOUGH?

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,700
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,300
I WANT YOU TO MEET MIKE VOLTA.

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,900
MIKE,THIS IS SAM.

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,900
HOW'S IT GOING?

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,700
HEY.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,300
SIT A SPELL. WE'VE
ONLY ORDERED APPS.

28
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,100
YEAH,I CAN'T. I HAVE PLANS.

29
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,600
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET
ANDY AND THE GUYS.

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
WELL,THEN ISN'T IT NICE
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,300
NOW SIT.

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,600
SO THERE I AM.

33
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,500
ONE MINUTE I'M TAKING
ROOM SERVICE TO SUITE 14

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,800
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW I'M IN BED
WITH THIS HEAVENLY CREATURE NAMED LINDA.

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,600
OH,YOU HOUND.

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,000
WHICH WOULD BE GREAT IF HER
HUSBAND DIDN'T WALK IN WITH A GUN.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,900
OH,MY!

38
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,200
CAN YOU BELIEVE
IT? UNNECESSARY.

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,900
WELL,YOU WERE
BANGING HIS WIFE.

40
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,300
THAT IS SO TRUE.

41
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,400
BANG,BANG.

42
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,100
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
HOW I GOT OUT OF IT.

43
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,700
IT'S KIND OF
EMBARRASSING,ACTUALLY.

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,900
I STARTED CRYING.

45
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,200
OH,HO HO,PERFECT.

46
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,300
PERFECT.

47
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,800
YOU STARTING CRYING?

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,600
COME ON,IT'S KIND OF GENIUS.

49
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,200
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
HARD IT IS TO SHOOT A MAN

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,700
WHO'S CRYING LIKE
A LITTLE GIRL?

51
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,900
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,400
OH,MY GOD.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,900
YES,OF COURSE I'LL MARRY YOU.

54
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,500
I HAVE TO CALL MY MOTHER.

55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,300
AH,YOUNG LOVE. SO
SWEET. INNOCENT.

56
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,400
QUITE THE CHALLENGE.

57
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,500
THAT?

58
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,200
IS NO CHALLENGE AT ALL.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,900
PROVE IT.

60
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,200
CAN YOU EXCUSE
ME FOR A SECOND?

61
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,400
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ABOUT?

62
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,700
THERE'S A VESSEL
UNDER YOUR CHAIR.

63
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,500
YOU TAKE IT,YOU FOLLOW
MIKE,YOU CAPTURE HIM.

64
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,200
QUICK AND QUIET.
WAIT. HE'S A SOUL?

65
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,100
AND A DANGEROUS ONE,HE'S
AS SLICK AS THEY COME.

66
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,300
I WANTED TO PERSONALLY MAKE
SURE THAT THERE WERE NO MISTAKES.

67
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,700
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I
THOUGHT YOU LIKED THIS GUY.

68
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,500
HE DISGUSTS ME.

69
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,500
CAN YOU BELIEVE HE HAD THE
STONES TO INVITE ME TO DINNER?

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,700
HE ACTUALLY THOUGHT HE
COULD CHARM THE DEVIL.

71
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,400
IF YOU HATE HIM SO MUCH,WHY DON'T
YOU JUST TAKE CARE OF HIM YOURSELF?

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,600
THAT'S NOT MY JOB.

73
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,600
ME,DEVIL. YOU,MINION.

74
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,000
I'M NOT GONNA SULLY MY HANDS
WITH THAT PIECE OF GARBAGE.

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,100
NOW GET TO IT!

76
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,200
DON'T LET HIM START TALKING.

77
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,300
JUST POINT AND SHOOT.

78
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,300
POINT AND SHOOT.

79
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,000
Mike: CLAIRE,WHERE
DID YOU LEARN THAT?

80
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,400
WHOA,WHOA,WHOA,SAM.

81
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,200
WE'RE A LITTLE BUSY,HERE.

82
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,800
DAMN,MAN. NOT COOL.

83
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,600
SHE HAD A TONGUE RING.

84
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,500
WHAT'S THAT YOU GOT THERE?

85
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
IT'S A VESSEL.

86
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,900
FOR REAL?

87
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,700
AW,SON OF A BITCH.

88
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,300
LET ME JUST SAY ONE
THING IN MY DEFENSE.

89
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,100
SORRY.

WE WAITED AT THE BAR FOR
YOU FOR TWO HOURS,SAM.

94
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
THIS ISN'T FAIR.

95
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,390
I MEAN,I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE DEVIL CAN...

96
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,950
YOU KNOW,ZAP YOU AWAY
WHENEVER HE FEELS LIKE IT.

97
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,780
ANDI,THAT'S HOW
THE DEAL WORKS.

98
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,740
I'VE COME TO ACCEPT IT.

99
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,280
BEING RESIGNED TO MY STUPID
FATE MAKES MY LIFE EASIER.

100
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,760
I CANNOT ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THERE
IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THIS.

101
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,820
ANDI,I'VE TRIED TO GET OUT
OF IT. MY DAD HAS TRIED.

102
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,670
ALL SIGNS POINT TO
ME BEING SCREWED.

103
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,910
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

104
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,160
NEXT.

105
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,550
HEY,GLADYS.

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,150
THIS IS ANDI. MY GIRLFRIEND.

107
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,640
YOU DON'T LOOK
MENTALLY DEFECTIVE.

108
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,770
DO YOU HAVE SOME
SORT OF DEFORMITY?

109
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,970
YOU MEAN LIKE HORNS
STICKING OUT OF MY HEAD? NO.

110
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,700
I LIKE HER.

111
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,110
PLACE THE VESSEL
ON THE MAT. Next

112
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,690
I THINK YOU JUST GOT
OFFICIAL DEMON APPROVAL.

113
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,780
OOH,THAT'S GOING ON MY RESUME.

114
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,690
OK,????????PUSH.

115
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,390
AH,COME ON! IT'S NOT CLOSING!

116
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,030
YOU'RE NOT STRONG
ENOUGH. COME ON.

117
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,440
KISS ME. KISS ME NOW.

118
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,190
AH,NICE. GET A LITTLE
TONGUE IN THERE,SARA.

119
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,150
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

120
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,730
THE IMMIGRATION OFFICER
IS HERE TALKING TO TED.

121
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,160
CHECKING OUT OUR STORY.
MAKE IT LOOK REAL.

122
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,340
BEN AND SARA GONZALES?

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
YES? WE'RE MR.
AND MRS. GONZALES.

124
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,410
AGENT PAPELBON,IMMIGRATION
AND CUSTOMS.

125
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,580
I'VE BEEN ASSIGNED
TO YOUR CASE,

126
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,050
AND I NEED TO DO
SOME VERIFICATION.

127
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,280
ARE YOU TWO AVAILABLE FOR
A FORMAL INTERVIEW TOMORROW,

128
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,610
-SAY AROUND 4:00?
-OF COURSE.

129
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,470
WELL,THAT IS,OF COURSE,

130
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,030
UNLESS THE NEWLYWEDS
ARE BUSY HAVING THE SEX.

131
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,040
WE ARE INSATIABLE.
ALL OUR FRIENDS SAY SO.

132
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,980
SAVE IT FOR THE INTERVIEW.

133
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,430
WHOA! WAIT,WAIT! PUT
IT BACK! PUT IT BACK!

134
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,310
SAM,MIKE VOLTA IS FREE.

135
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,880
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT?

136
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,020
NO! NO! I SWEAR! I DROPPED
THE VESSEL OFF THIS MORNING.

137
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,590
-YOU ARE AN ASS.
-MY APOLOGIES,KIDDO.

138
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,790
I'M NOT MYSELF,SAMMY.

139
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,420
THIS SOUL MAKES ME
LOOK LIKE A REAL CHUMP.

140
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,480
HE MIGHT AS WELL
JUST SPIT IN MY FACE.

141
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,820
I MEAN,HELL IS BECOMING A
REVOLVING DOOR FOR THIS CHARACTER.

142
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,920
WELL,HOW'S HE GETTING OUT?

143
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,810
WELL,THERE CAN BE
ONLY ONE EXPLANATION.

144
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,570
SOMEONE IS HELPING MIKE
VOLTA FROM THE INSIDE.

145
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,790
WE HAVE A MOLE IN HELL.

146
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,540
AND I WILL FIND HIM.

147
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,020
THE TORTURE TRAIN IS GOING
TO BE ROLLING DOWNSTAIRS

148
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,920
UNTIL SOMEONE TALKS.
DON'T YOU WORRY.

149
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,110
I'M NOT WORRIED.

150
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,710
LIMBS WILL BE QUARTERED
AND LOINS WILL BE SEARED.

151
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,600
BETTER CHECK YOUR MAIL.

152
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,870
MIKE,HEY!

153
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,740
RIGHT. THANKS,HONEY.
GOOD MAGIC.

154
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,820
HEY THERE,BUDDY.

155
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,030
YOU MIND IF I PUT
ON MY PANTS FIRST?

156
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,980
YEAH,YEAH. HURRY IT UP.

157
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,400
YOU REALIZE I'M JUST
GONNA GET OUT AGAIN.

158
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,340
AND AGAIN.

159
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,400
SEEMS LIKE A BIG WASTE
OF EVERYONE'S TIME.

160
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,230
IF I WERE YOU,I'D
JUST LET ME GO.

161
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,600
SORRY,MIKE. CAN'T DO IT.

162
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,900
CAN'T BLAME A GUY
FOR TRYING. RIGHT?

163
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,870
AT LEAST LET'S MAKE A MEMORY.

164
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,590
WHAT THE HELL...

165
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,760
SAY CHEESE. CHEESE.

166
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,580
PLACE THE VESSEL ON THE MAT.

167
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,900
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

168
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,900
WELL,I JUST WANT TO
MAKE SURE HE GOES IN.

169
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,120
THE DEVIL SORTA
TRIED TO BREAK MY NECK

170
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,660
WHEN HE GOT OUT THE LAST TIME.

171
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,510
NO OFFENSE. I'M SURE
YOU DO A GREAT JOB..

172
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,570
-SATISFIED?
-COMPLETELY.

173
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,110
NEXT.

174
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,850
-CAN I HAVE THE COMICS WHEN YOU'RE DONE?
-OF COURSE.

175
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,070
THANKS.

176
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,800
SAM. OH,SAM.!

177
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,960
-HEY.
-OK,ALL RIGHT.

178
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,110
SEE YOU TOO.

179
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,690
I'M JUST GLAD YOU'RE
ALL RIGHT,YOU KNOW.

180
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,240
YOUR "BOSS," WORD HAS
IT,IS ON THE WARPATH

181
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,040
OVER A SOUL WHO KEEPS,UH...

182
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,220
SO I'M JUST-

183
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,820
I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU
ARE NOT AMONG THE BODY COUNT.

184
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,500
NO. I'M FINE.

185
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,180
WELL,GOOD. WELL,IF I
CAN HELP YOU IN ANY WAY,

186
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,310
PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

187
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,360
HEY,HOW ABOUT HELPING SAM OUT
OF HIS DEAL WITH THE DEVIL?

188
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:00,410
WELL,THAT'S A... THAT
IS A PRETTY TALL ORDER.

189
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,350
YOU KNOW,I MEAN,ONCE
YOU SELL YOUR SOUL,

190
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,700
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
A ROCK SOLID DEAL.

191
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,480
I CAN'T THINK OF HOW ANY
WAY THAT YOU CAN BREAK THAT.

192
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,830
YEAH,BUT HE DIDN'T EVEN SELL
HIS SOUL. HIS PARENTS DID.

193
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,780
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

194
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,960
ANDI,MY DAD'S BEEN LOOKING
AT THE CONTRACT FOR MONTHS.

195
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,930
IF THERE WAS A
WAY OUT OF THIS,

196
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,880
HE WOULD'VE FOUND IT.

197
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,620
WELL,MAYBE TONY
CAN LOOK AT IT.

198
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,280
WILL YOU?

199
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,300
YES,YES,SURE,

200
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,700
-BRING IT ON BY AND I'LL TAKE A GANDER.
-GREAT.

201
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,070
HERE WE GO. TRIP
DOWN MEMORY LANE.

202
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,200
WE PUT THESE TOGETHER
WITH PHOTOSHOP.

203
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,620
SEE? THERE'S OUR FAKE WEDDING.

204
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,530
FAKE APPLE PICKING.

205
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,850
FAKE HONEYMOON IN MEXICO.

206
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,180
WELL,WHAT DO YOU THINK?

207
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,040
PRETTY GOOD,RIGHT?

208
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,130
I MEAN,'CAUSE WE
TOTALLY LOOK MARRIED.

209
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,570
THESE ARE SO WEAK.

210
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,930
THEY'RE IDIOTIC.

211
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,770
-WE NEED SOME NAKED PHOTOS OF YOU IN HERE ASAP.
-WHAT? WHY?

212
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,590
IF YOU WANT ANY CHANCE IN HELL

213
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,420
OF MAKING THIS MARRIAGE
SEEM BELIEVABLE,

214
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,900
YOU HAVE TO SELL
THE PASSION,THE HEAT.

215
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,570
ALL RIGHT,WHAT THE
SPANISH CALL "EL FUEGO."

216
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,620
NAKED PHOTOS IN A
FAMILY ALBUM,SOCK?

217
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,950
YEAH,BEN,THAT'S WHAT
LOVING COUPLES DO,OK?

218
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,540
JOSIE AND I HAVE ENOUGH
PHOTOS OF EACH OTHER'S JUNK

219
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,900
TO FILL A LIBRARY.

220
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,120
PLUS JOHNNY IMMIGRATION
WILL BE SO SHOCKED,

221
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,190
HE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO
BELIEVE YOU GUYS ARE TOGETHER.

222
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,730
THAT MAKES SOME SENSE.

223
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,780
YEAH,THAT'S WHY I SAID IT.

224
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,030
ALL RIGHT,I THINK I MIGHT
HAVE A FEW SNAPS THAT WORK.

225
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,920
GIVE 'EM.

226
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,690
THESE ARE LOVELY.

227
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,260
-TASTEFULLY GRAPHIC.
-THANK YOU.

228
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,370
OK. GOOD. BENJAMIN,RIP
OF THAT SHIRT.

229
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,270
WE GOT TO GET YOU LUBED UP.

230
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,220
NO. I'M NOT TAKING
NAKED PICTURES.

231
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,750
OH,COME ON,DON'T-

232
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,240
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED,YOU
LITTLE SHY GUY.

233
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,410
ALL RIGHT,I'LL
GET NAKED WITH YOU.

234
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,820
I'M NOT EMBARRASSED,IT'S
JUST STUPID.

235
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,130
BENJAMIN,WE NEED TO
GO ABOVE AND BEYOND

236
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,140
IN ORDER TO GET
THEM TO BELIEVE US.

237
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,720
OTHERWISE,IF THEY DON'T,

238
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,140
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO JAIL AND I'M
GONNA GET KICKED OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

239
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,180
I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.

240
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,640
SO STOP YOUR WHINING AND
GET YOUR SHIRT OFF,NOW.

241
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,150
FINE. BUT NO FULL FRONTAL.

242
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,790
WELL,LET'S JUST SEE
HOW IT GOES,ALL RIGHT?

243
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,180
HOLD IT.

244
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,520
-HEY,SAM.
-OUT ALREADY?

245
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,060
YEAH,I JUST STAYED DOWN LONG
ENOUGH TO WORK ON MY TAN.

246
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,060
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
-I CAME TO GET YOU.

247
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,160
NOT "GET YOU" LIKE A
MONSTER. GET YOU TO GO OUT.

248
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,140
OUT WHERE?

249
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,140
I SUGGEST CLUB
RENDEZVOUS FOR TONIGHT.

250
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,450
THE LADIES THERE
ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

251
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,380
MAYBE TOMORROW WE'LL
HIT THE GADABOUT ROOM.

252
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,200
IT'S A SATURDAY
NIGHT INSTITUTION.

253
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,860
WHY WOULD I GO OUT WITH YOU?

254
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,000
BECAUSE IT'S FUN.
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU.

255
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,670
AND BECAUSE WITH
ME AS YOUR WINGMAN,

256
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,400
YOU'LL BE SWIMMING IN
SWEETIES WITHIN THE HOUR.

257
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,020
DO YOU OWN A TIE?

258
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,730
LISTEN,IF I DON'T
BRING YOU IN,

259
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,050
THE DEVIL WILL KILL ME.
I'M SORRY. IT'S MY JOB.

260
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,200
AND I RESPECT THAT.

261
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,410
BUT DO YOU WANT TO
KNOW THE REAL REASON

262
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,840
THE DEVIL'S OUT TO
GET ME? JEALOUSY.

263
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,560
HE WATCHES GUYS LIKE US OUT
THERE ENJOYING OURSELVES.

264
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,510
BUT WHAT DOES HE ENJOY?

265
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,340
UH,MAKING PEOPLE MISERABLE.

266
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,190
EXACTLY. BECAUSE DEEP
DOWN HE'S MISERABLE.

267
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,430
HE WOULDN'T KNOW A GOOD TIME

268
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,110
IF IT BIT HIM ON THE ASS.

269
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,990
HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF
FUN. HE'S A FUN SUCKER.

270
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,820
THINK ABOUT IT. I
MEAN,WHAT'S MY CRIME?

271
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,480
I LOVE WOMEN. THEY LOVE ME.

272
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,910
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ME A SINNER,SAM.

273
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,200
ALL RIGHT. I
GUESS THIS IS YOU.

274
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,220
YOU KNOW I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CATCH YOU

275
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,300
WHEN I GET THE VESSEL.

276
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,780
AH,BACK TO CAT AND
MOUSE. GOOD TIMES.

277
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,970
JUST GIVE ME A HEAD START,OK?

278
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,830
AH! IT WASN'T EASY. BUT WE
GOT IT DONE,BUDDY. TEAMWORK.

279
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,880
WINSTON,A DRINK FOR MY MAN.

280
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,650
YEAH,I TOOK A LOT
OF ELBOW GREASE.

281
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,040
LOT OF LIMBS RENT
FROM A LOT OF TORSOS.

282
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,650
BUT EVERYBODY STARTED
SINGING LIKE CANARIES.

283
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,760
NOW HELL IS SEALED
TIGHT AS A DRUM.

284
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,310
AND NOW,IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

285
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,140
THERE'S A DEMON ABOUT PITCHFORK
DEEP IN MIKE'S ASS AS WE SPEAK.

286
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,270
MIKE WAS JUST IN MY ELEVATOR.

287
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,490
NOT NOW,WINSTON. NOT NOW.

288
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,690
I'M NOT GONNA
LIE TO YOU,SAMMY.

289
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,610
I HAVE SOME SERIOUS
EGG ON MY FACE.

290
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,970
YOU KNOW,I'M STARTING TO
FEEL THAT MAYBE TORTURE

291
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,530
ISN'T THE WAY TO GET
WHAT YOU WANT,YOU KNOW?

292
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,670
LIKE MAYBE PEOPLE JUST TELL
YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR

293
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,930
SO THAT YOU STOP PULLING
OUT THEIR FINGERNAILS.

294
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,760
I DON'T GET IT.

295
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,580
-WHY ARE YOU SO OBSESSED WITH THIS GUY.
-I'M NOT OBSESSED.

296
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,550
I SIMPLY DEMAND A
MODICUM OF RESPECT

297
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,290
FROM THE SOULS IN MY DOMAIN.

298
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,110
I WON'T BE DISSED,SAM.

299
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,950
BECAUSE I GOT TO TELL YOU,

300
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,080
HE DOESN'T REALLY SEEM
LIKE THAT BAD OF A GUY.

301
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:55,960
THAT'S HOW IT BEGINS,SEE?

302
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,970
"HE'S NOT THAT BAD OF A GUY.

303
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,030
-ALL HE'S DOING IS CHASING TAIL AND HAVING FUN."
-WELL,YEAH.

304
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,600
AND WHILE YOU'RE STANDING
THERE DEVELOPING YOUR MAN CRUSH,

305
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,250
YOU COMPLETELY IGNORE
THE DESTRUCTION HE CAUSES.

306
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,460
-WHAT DESTRUCTION?
-WHAT DESTRUCTION?

307
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,650
WHAT DESTRUCTION,SAM?

308
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,160
THIS IS WHERE I CAUGHT
MIKE. IS HE HERE?

309
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,430
NO. HE DOESN'T
NEED TO COME BACK.

310
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,670
THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE.

311
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,340
JAMES AND LUELLA CARVER
LIVED IN THIS HOUSE

312
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,120
FOR ABOUT AS LONG
AS THEY WERE MARRIED.

313
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,350
24 YEARS. HAPPY,SOLID YEARS.

314
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,690
YOU KNOW,THEY NEVER EVEN
CONSIDERED BEING UNFAITHFUL

315
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,210
TO ONE ANOTHER.NOT ONCE.

316
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,080
THAT IS UNTIL MIKE
VOLTA ENTERED THE PICTURE

317
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,850
AND SET HIS SITES ON LUELLA.

318
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,190
THIS IS WHAT MIKE VOLTA DOES.

319
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,120
HE TAKES LOVE AND COMMITMENT

320
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,230
AND DESTROYS IT
EVERY CHANCE HE GETS.

321
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,380
BUT,HEY,OTHER THAN THAT
HE'S A GREAT GUY,RIGHT?

322
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,760
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

323
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,660
I WANT HIM BACK,SAM.

324
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,090
NO MORE EXCUSES.

325
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,250
I'VE NEVER SEEN A FAMILY
ALBUM WITH SO MUCH NUDITY.

326
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,480
IT'S,UM,JARRING.

327
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,270
GOT TO KEEP THINGS
FRESH,HAVEN'T YOU?

328
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,070
SO,SARA,HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?

329
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,510
I WAS WAITING IN LINE
FOR THE FERRIS WHEEL

330
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,960
WHEN HE COMES ALONG AND ASKS
IF WE COULD SHARE A SEAT.

331
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,360
YES,THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW I REMEMBER IT.

332
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,720
ok.BEN,TELL ME
ABOUT SARA'S MOTHER.

333
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,060
DO YOU TWO GET ALONG?

334
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,630
BARBARA? YES,WE
GET ALONG VERY WELL.

335
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,300
IT SAYS HERE HER
MOTHER'S NAME IS SUSAN.

336
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,200
I GET CONFUSED. MY
MOTHER'S NAME IS BARBARA.

337
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,210
SAYS HERE YOUR MOTHER'S
NAME IS CANDACE.

338
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,770
IS EVERYONE'S
MOUTH REALLY DRY?

339
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:24,800
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?

340
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,830
I'M JUST GOING TO
CUT RIGHT TO IT.

341
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,770
IT'S OBVIOUS YOU
TWO ARE LYING.

342
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,260
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
RED FLAG THIS CASE.

343
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,190
YOU'VE GOT THE WEEKEND.

344
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,400
I SUGGEST YOU BOTH
OBTAIN LEGAL COUNSEL.

345
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,130
EXPECT TO BE IN FRONT OF
A JUDGE MONDAY MORNING.

346
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,360
YOU WILL BE ON A PLANE
HOME MONDAY NIGHT.

347
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,230
AND YOU WILL BE IN JAIL.

348
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,760
THANKS FOR THE LAUGH.

349
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,400
SAM'S BEEN IN THERE A WHILE.

350
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,330
-HOPE EVERYTHING'S GOING OK.
-YEAH.

351
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,980
THINK MIKE WILL BE
AT THE CLUB TONIGHT?

352
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,390
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

353
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,840
-SAM SAID IT'S ONE OF HIS FAVS,SO AWAY WE GO.
-ALL RIGHT.

354
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,640
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

355
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,540
IT'S KIND OF AN UPSCALE JOINT.

356
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,660
MAYBE WE SHOULD
SWING BY YOUR HOUSE

357
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,730
SO YOU CAN GET
CHANGED OUT OF THAT.

358
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,950
NO. NO. I'M GONNA WEAR THIS.

359
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,980
WELL,LOOK WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.

360
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,560
I'M A GUY,ANDI.

361
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,220
GUYS DON'T HAVE TO
GET DRESSED UP,OK?

362
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,810
IF I WEAR THIS OUT TO A CLUB,

363
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,000
I'M TELLING THE WORLD ONE
THING AND ONE THING ONLY-

364
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,620
-"I DON'T IRON."
-NO!

365
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,290
I'M TELLING THE WORLD
THAT I DON'T CARE

366
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,390
ABOUT WHAT YOU PEOPLE
THINK ABOUT ME,OK?

367
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,410
BESIDES,THE LADIES WANT IT.

368
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,520
WELL,YOU KNOW I
USUALLY DON'T GO

369
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,700
TO PLACES LIKE THIS ANYWAY.

370
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
RIGHT. RIGHT.

371
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,730
-YEAH,IT PROBABLY DOESN'T MATTER.
-NOPE.

372
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,560
SO WHAT ABOUT THE HAIR THOUGH?

373
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,330
WHAT-WHAT IS
WRONG WITH MY HAIR?

374
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,020
I DON'T KNOW. YOU EVER
THINK ABOUT CUTTING IT?

375
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,230
GO FOR A LITTLE TASTY
WAIF PAGEBOY THING?

376
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,740
LIKE THAT SKATER?
REMEMBER HER?

377
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,070
SHE LOOKED LIKE A
BOY,BUT SHE WAS HOT.

378
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,570
-I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.
-THERE'S OUR BOY.

379
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,030
HEY,IS THAT THE CONTRACT?

380
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,910
THAT THING IS MASSIVE.
SAM IS SO SCREWED.

381
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,570
HEY.

382
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,220
OH,MY GOD.

383
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,970
THAT WAS SO AWKWARD.

384
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,430
YOU WALKED IN ON
THEM HAVING SEX.

385
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,030
NO. IT'S LIKE THEY DIDN'T
WANT TO GIVE IT TO ME.

386
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,500
MY DAD GAVE ME THIS WHOLE GUILT
TRIP ABOUT HOW I DIDN'T TRUST HIM.

387
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,760
OK,STILL WATCHING,STILL
WAVING. HI,SAM'S HOT MOM.

388
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,890
-ALL RIGHT,LET'S... LET'S GO.
-BYE!

389
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,050
SO WHY WOULD A SOUL TELL YOU
WHERE HE'S GONNA BE PARTYING?

390
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,520
HE WANTED ME TO
GO OUT WITH HIM,

391
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,440
JUST TRYING TO GET ME LAID.

392
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,720
-SO DID YOU TELL HIM YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?
-HOLD ON.

393
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,700
HEY,HEY,BENJI,IT'S SOCK.

394
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,450
WE'RE ALMOST TO THE CLUB.
WERE YOU ABLE TO GET IN?

395
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:40,980
YOU'LL-

396
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,810
OK,DO YOU WANT ME TO
TELL THEM THAT RIGHT NOW?

397
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,110
YOU WANT TO TELL THEM
THAT. YOU WANT TO TELL THEM-

398
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,510
OK,HANG ON.

399
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,600
I LOVE YOU GUYS. I
CAN'T WAIT TO HUG YOU,OK?

400
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,090
OK. ALL RIGHT,OK.
SEE YOU IN A BIT.

401
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,900
HE SOUNDS HAMMERED.

402
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,470
IMMIGRATION INTERVIEW
MUST HAVE GONE WELL...

403
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,870
YEAH. THE WAY
HE'S CELEBRATING.

404
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,810
OW,PARTY! YEAH!

405
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,900
FEEL THE BEAT!

406
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,240
BENNY. BENNY. BENNY.
WHAT IS WITH YOU,MAN?

407
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,460
HEY,HEY,SAMMY.

408
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,690
IMMIGRATION BUSTED MY ASS.

409
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,290
-THEY BUSTED IT WIDE OPEN.
-WHAT?

410
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,150
AND I'M GOING TO JAIL,OK?

411
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,040
SO THIS IS MY LAST
WEEKEND OF FREEDOM,

412
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,650
AND I'M GOING
OUT IN STYLE. OK?

413
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:27,890
BENNY,BENNY.

414
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,260
OH,MY GOD. WE GOT TO
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

415
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,200
WE GOT TO GET YOU-

416
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,710
CASSIDY,I'M GOING
TO THE BIGHOUSE,BABY.

417
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,720
AND I'LL NEED YOU
TO WAIT FOR ME,OK?

418
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,410
OK! YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

419
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,450
THIS IS MY BIG
NIGHT. MY BIG NIGHT!

420
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,820
HEY,BENJI.
BENJI,COME ON! BENJI!

421
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,690
FREEDOM! SWEET FREEDOM!
TAKE MY PICTURE NOW.

422
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,800
I FEEL THE NIGHT
AIR ON MY NIPPLES.

423
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,040
I'M ALIVE. OH!

424
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,660
-HEY,OK,YOU ALL RIGHT?
-OH,I CAN'T FEEL MY THING.

425
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,160
DID YOU GUYS SEE
THE CAR THAT HIT ME?

426
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,580
OH,THERE IT IS.

427
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,000
HEY,YOU!

428
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,870
-SAM,LOOK.
-GET BACK HERE,YOU BASTARD!

429
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,140
YOU THINK YOU CAN FOOL
AROUND WITH MY GIRL?

430
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,060
THAT'S HIM. THAT'S MIKE.

431
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,750
-HE WAS WITH GLADYS.
-WHAT?

432
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,290
HEY!

433
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,460
WELL,LOOK AT THAT. SHE'S HERE.

434
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,110
WHAT DOES OL' GLADENSTEIN
THINK SHE'S UP TO?

435
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,960
IT MAKES SENSE. MIKE
ESCAPED FROM HELL SO EASILY

436
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,590
BECAUSE HE NEVER GOT THERE.

437
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,110
GLADYS IS THE LEAK.

438
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,950
SO DOES THAT ALSO
MEAN SHE'S HIS LOVER?

439
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,680
OH,THIS IS GOING
TO BE SO GREAT.

440
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,020
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GET HER!

441
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,520
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

442
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,270
I CAN'T GET A CLEAR SHOT.
OUT OF MY WAY,GLADYS!

443
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,080
OVER MY DEAD BODY! GET
THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!

444
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,790
I AM NOT TALKING TO
YOU. I'M TALKING TO HIM.

445
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,950
GIVE IT UP,MIKE.
LET'S GO. MOVE!

446
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,250
NO! DON'T DO ANYTHING,OK?
NOBODY HAS TO GET HURT. PLEASE.

447
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,690
THEN LET ME WALK OUT
OF HERE OR SHE DIES.

448
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,730
OH,COME ON. REALLY? HA HA!

449
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,920
GO AHEAD,DO IT. SEE IF I CARE.

450
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,490
SERIOUSLY. YOU COULD
HAVE PICKED ANYTHING

451
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,340
IN THE WHOLE BIG BAD UNIVERSE
TO GRAB AS A HUMAN SHIELD.

452
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,830
YOU GRAB THE ONE THING

453
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,700
THAT I CARE THE LEAST ABOUT.

454
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,720
ZERO. NO FEELINGS.

455
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,890
I MEAN,YOU COULD HAVE GRABBED
THAT OLD TV GUIDE OVER THERE

456
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,820
AND HELD A KNIFE TO IT, AND I
WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CONFLICTED.

457
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,410
SO YOU KNOW WHAT,GIVE IT UP.

458
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,510
PUT THE SHIV DOWN.
YOU'RE GOING BACK TO-

459
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,250
OH,GOD. GO GET HIM!

460
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,810
-GUYS...
-WHAT?

461
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,460
I THINK SHE'S DEAD.

462
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,270
OH,MY GOD.

463
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,370
OK,SAM ???? PICK HER UP!

464
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,250
OH,SHE'S HEAVY. I DIDN'T
THINK SHE WAS THIS HEAVY.

465
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,250
I'LL GET THE DOOR. GET THE
DOOR. ALL RIGHT,I GOT HER.

466
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,150
WATCH HER HEAD.

467
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,910
YOU ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT.

468
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,680
GO AHEAD,GET IN.
NO,YOU GET IN.

469
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,640
FINE! GO!

470
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,430
THIS IS SO AWFUL.

471
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,110
WHAT DO WE DO?

472
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,850
WHAT DO WE DO WITH
A DEAD DEMON BODY?

473
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,590
I DID THIS. THIS IS MY FAULT.

474
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,290
NO,MIKE DID THIS.

475
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,670
YEAH,BUT I ENCOURAGED HIM.

476
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,480
I SAID THAT WE
DIDN'T CARE ABOUT HER.

477
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,710
AND NOW LOOK AT
HER. SHE'S DEAD!

478
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,400
OH,OH,GOD,I FEEL
TERRIBLE. I'M GONNA BARF.

479
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,160
YOU GUYS,WE HAVE TO THINK.

480
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,120
WE CANNOT DRIVE AROUND
WITH A DEAD BODY.

481
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,040
WE SHOULD BURY HER.
SOMEPLACE BEAUTIFUL.

482
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,590
OR LIGHT HER ON
FIRE LIKE A VIKING.

483
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,750
GET A STACK OF WOOD.

484
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,720
LET'S GO TO TONY'S.
HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

485
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,050
-SEATBELTS,RIGHT? SAFETY FIRST.
-YES.YES.

486
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,590
ALL THE LIGHTS ARE
ON,BUT I DON'T SEE HIM.

487
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,670
ALL RIGHT,LET'S JUST
GO INTO THE WOODS

488
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,430
AND FIND A PLACE
TO DIG A GRAVE.

489
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,780
I'M GONNA SAY A
PRAYER WHEN WE DO IT.

490
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,610
SOCK,SHE'S A DEMON. I DON'T
THINK SHE'D WANT PRAYERS.

491
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,840
I'M GONNA SING SOME
SABBATH WHEN WE DO IT.

492
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,110
THAT'LL BE REAL NICE,SOCK.

493
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,250
-YEAH.
-YEAH.

494
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,550
ANDI,GRAB A BARREL.

495
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,590
ARGH!

496
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,500
AAH!

497
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,990
SH-SHE'S DEAD.

498
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:43,880
SHE'S DEAD.

499
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,590
YEAH. WE'RE ABOUT TO BURY HER.

500
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,740
YOU SOBER?

501
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,370
Andi: THAT'S IT.

502
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,190
Sock: ONCE AGAIN.

503
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,570
HEY,HOW ABOUT HERE?

504
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,630
NO. NO.

505
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,220
WE GOT TO BURY GLADYS
IN THE PERFECT SPOT.

506
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,590
Benji: WHERE IS
THIS PERFECT SPOT?

507
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,570
I'LL KNOW WHEN I SEE IT.

508
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,210
IT'LL PROBABLY HAVE
A WATERFALL. NO!

509
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,610
ALL RIGHT,THAT'S IT,SOCK.

510
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,850
WE'RE BURYING HER RIGHT HERE.

511
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,900
WHAT'S THAT?

512
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,350
HEY,GUYS,I SAW YOUR
CAR IN THE DRIVEWAY.

513
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,910
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN
MY NECK OF THE WOODS?

514
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,800
WELL,REMEMBER
HOW WE WANTED YOU

515
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,500
TO TAKE A LOOK AT MY
DEAL WITH THE DEVIL?

516
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,200
SURE.

517
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,390
WELL,WE BROUGHT A
DEAD BODY TO BURY.

518
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,440
ALSO.

519
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,370
HMM. OK. LET'S DO THAT.

520
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,500
WATCH OUT.

521
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,110
OH!

522
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,820
OH,GOD.

523
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,910
UH,I DON'T THINK SHE'LL FIT.

524
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,490
YOU'RE RIGHT.

525
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,460
WE COULD FOLD HER.

526
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,000
YEAH.

527
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,800
ALL RIGHT,OK,I'LL
DO IT. I'LL DO IT.

528
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,500
I OWE HER THAT MUCH.

529
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,810
COMING IN,GLADYS.

530
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,830
SAM.

531
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,090
I'M GONNA HAVE MY BUDDY LOOK
AT THAT CONTRACT RIGHT AWAY.

532
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,510
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,

533
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,830
WE'RE GONNA BREAK THIS
DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.

534
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,090
I PROMISE.

535
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,660
THANK YOU. THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

536
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,690
OK,GUYS,COME ON. EULOGY TIME.

537
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,720
HERE LIES GLADYS.

538
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,100
AND SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.

539
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,660
OH,THE GODDESS OF THE DMV.

540
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,600
WAIT A SECOND.

541
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,070
SHE A DEMON?

542
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,390
YEAH.

543
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,470
YEAH,SHE'S THE ONE THE
DEVIL'S BEEN LOOKING FOR.

544
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,030
THE SOUL KILLED HER.

545
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,990
REALLY? JUST A SECOND.

546
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,020
UH!

547
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,910
THERE WE GO.

548
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,230
WHAT DID YOU DO?

549
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,260
SHE'LL BE FINE.

550
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,210
MORTAL WEAPONS,THEY
CAN'T KILL US.

551
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,640
GLADYS?

552
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,260
AH! AAH!

553
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,400
WHOA! WHOA!

554
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,280
THANKS.

555
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,380
NO PROBLEM.

556
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,640
GLADYS,THE DEVIL KNOWS

557
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,290
SOMEONE'S HELPING MIKE ESCAPE.

558
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,450
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

559
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,910
BEFORE HE FINDS OUT IT'S YOU.

560
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,020
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

561
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,430
WHERE IS HE?

562
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,910
DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

563
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,210
AND I WOULDN'T TELL
YOU IF I DID KNOW.

564
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,830
THANKS FOR NOT
BURYING ME ALIVE.

565
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,970
GLADYS,JUST TELL ME ONE THING.

566
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,090
WHY RISK IT ALL FOR THAT JERK?

567
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,350
I MEAN,HE TRIED TO KILL YOU.

568
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,360
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

569
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,060
I JUST GOT TIRED
OF BEING LONELY.

570
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,960
NEXT.

571
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,580
CAN I HELP YOU?

572
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,330
YES,I BELIEVE YOU CAN.

573
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,150
HELLO,GLADYS.

574
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:56,810
YOU KNOW,I HEAR THAT
CONFESSING ONE'S SINS

575
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,050
IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL.

576
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,440
FIRST OFF,YOU'RE
A COMPLETE MORON

577
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,750
TO EVEN BE IN THIS SITUATION.

578
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,510
NO ONE DISPUTES
THAT I AM A MORON.

579
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,910
I TRIED TO STOP HIM,BABY.

580
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,230
NO,YOU DIDN'T. NO,I DIDN'T.

581
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,550
YOU HAVE ONE CHANCE.

582
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,700
YOU'RE GONNA BE CHARGED,THERE'S
NO AVOIDING THAT,

583
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,010
BUT IF YOU PAY THE FINE,YOU
MIGHT AVOID JAIL TIME.

584
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,830
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE?

585
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,980
UH... NONE.

586
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,380
I DO HAVE A SAVINGS
ACCOUNT WITH 2,000 BUCKS.

587
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,040
NO,NO,HE DOESN'T. NO.

588
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,260
WHY ARE YOU TELLING
HER THAT,BENZINE?

589
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,340
YOU'VE BEEN SAVING THAT MONEY

590
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,640
FOR FORMULA ONE RACING SCHOOL.

591
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,450
REMEMBER? THAT IS YOUR DREAM.

592
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,600
THAT IS OUR DREAM.

593
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,460
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
MORE THAN TWO GRAND.

594
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,660
TRY DOUBLE THAT.

595
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,910
OH,I GUESS I CAN BORROW
THE REST FROM MY GRANDMA.

596
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:43,930
YOU COULD.

597
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,590
WILL THIS COVER SARA,TOO?

598
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,320
SARA HAS NO CHANCE.

599
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,210
THEY'RE GONNA DEPORT HER.

600
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,440
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TELL HER.

601
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,300
HEY.

602
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,370
HEH HEH.

603
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,760
GOT YOU A PRETZEL.

604
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,440
I'M BEING DEPORTED,AREN'T I?

605
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:11,920
I'M SO SORRY,

606
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,520
AND IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

607
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,240
I HAVE TO PAY A HUGE FINE.

608
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,710
I KIND OF FIGURED
THIS MIGHT HAPPEN

609
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,510
AND I MADE ALTERNATE
ARRANGEMENTS.

610
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,060
I HAD A VERY CANDID DISCUSSION

611
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,480
WITH OUR IMMIGRATION OFFICER.

612
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,690
HE HAS AGREED TO
ACCEPT A B-R-I-B-E.

613
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,980
A BRIBE?

614
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,700
IF WE PAY HIM,HE IS
WILLING TO 'LOSE' THE FILE.

615
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,520
I DON'T GET KICKED
OUT OF THE COUNTRY,

616
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,680
YOU DON'T GO TO JAIL.

617
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,640
OK,BUT WOULDN'T THAT BE
DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL

618
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,100
TO COVER UP SOMETHING ILLEGAL?

619
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,950
I MEAN-
MM-HMM. SURE.

620
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,770
I MEAN,IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO PAY YOUR LITTLE FINE

621
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,330
AND JUST THROW
ME TO THE WOLVES?

622
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,340
THERE ARE NO WOLVES.

623
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,400
THEY'LL JUST BE SENDING YOU
BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM.

624
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,800
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO MANCHESTER,BEN?

625
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,910
SMOKE STACKS.

626
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,600
CROWDS. BLEAK.

627
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,930
ALL THAT'S LEFT FOR ME
TO LOOK FORWARD TO THERE

628
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,510
IS MY OLD STOOL IN MY
FATHER'S MUSLIN PLANT.

629
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,860
THAT'S RIGHT. MUSLIN.

630
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,050
IF WE POOL OUR MONEY TOGETHER,

631
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,350
WE CAN PERSUADE HIM
TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY.

632
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,930
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE?

633
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,540
I CAN GET 2,000
RIGHT AWAY,BUT-

634
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,060
WITH MY 3,THAT MAKES $5,000,

635
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,810
WHICH IS MORE THAN
ENOUGH FOR A BRIBE,RIGHT?

636
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:33,410
BEN... I OWE YOU AN
APOLOGY,SWEETHEART.

637
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,810
EVER SINCE YOU
AGREED TO HELP ME OUT,

638
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,030
I COULD SEE THAT YOU
WERE VERY SPECIAL.

639
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,380
SO SELFLESS,SO READY
TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE OUT

640
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,240
AND SO RARE.

641
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,820
WITH ALL THIS
IMMIGRATION BUSINESS,

642
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,600
I KIND OF LOST SIGHT OF THAT.

643
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,890
FORGIVE ME?

644
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,660
SURE.

645
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,680
IT'S FANTASTIC.

646
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,040
I'LL NEED THE MONEY BY 5.

647
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,290
OH,CASH ONLY,PLEASE.

648
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,420
SAM,SAM,LOOK.

649
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,170
Sam: HEY. HI.

650
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,820
GLADYS,WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

651
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,970
IF YOU'RE STILL
LOOKING FOR MIKE,

652
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,920
THERE'S A CHURCH
OUT ON RANGE ROAD.

653
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,180
HE'LL BE THERE TONIGHT AT 5.

654
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,030
WHY?

655
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,560
HE LIKES TO CRASH WEDDINGS

656
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,670
AND SLIP IT TO
THE BLUSHING BRIDE.

657
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,220
CLASS ACT.

658
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,310
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING US THIS NOW?

659
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:36,030
YOU WERE NICER TO ME
THAN MIKE EVER WAS.

660
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,420
THIS IS MY CAT,FANCY.

661
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,430
IF YOU'D LOOK AFTER HIM,I'D
GREATLY APPRECIATE IT.

662
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,260
HE HAS A SKIN CONDITION,

663
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,670
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE TO
SQUEEZE HIS PUSTULES

664
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,020
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

665
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,940
YEAH. GLADYS,WHAT HAPPENED?

666
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,050
I'VE BEEN REASSIGNED.

667
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,580
BACK DOWN TO HEAD OFFICE.

668
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,290
NO. NO. SAM. WE
CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN.

669
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,560
I MEAN,YOU GOTTA DO SOMETHING

670
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,430
LIKE WHAT? I
DUNNO,TALK TO THE DEVIL.

671
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,490
GET HIM TO LET HER GO.

672
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,300
NO,ANDI. I LEARNED
A LONG TIME AGO

673
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,570
THAT ASKING THE
DEVIL FOR A FAVOR

674
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,560
IS A BAD IDEA.

675
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,030
BESIDES,GLADYS IS A DEMON.

676
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,010
I BET SHE HAS A LOT
OF FRIENDS IN HELL.

677
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,800
THIS IS NOT A
BIG DEAL FOR HER.

678
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,920
YOU THINK?

679
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,580
SHE'LL BE FINE.

680
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,140
BUT I COULD BE WRONG.

681
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,200
THE CEREMONY SHOULD
START ANY MINUTE

682
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,280
MIKE'S PROBABLY KNEE-DEEP
IN SOME HONEYMOON BY NOW.

683
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,240
LET'S GET IN THERE.

684
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,950
HEY. Sam: WHOA,WHOA,WHOA.

685
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,320
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

686
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,400
WHAT'S WITH THE FANCY PANTS?

687
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,010
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU TOLD ME DRESS UP.

688
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,360
I DID NOT. YES,YOU DID.

689
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,290
WHAT,YOU GUYS
COULDN'T EVEN WEAR

690
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,120
ONE OF YOUR TUXEDO T-SHIRTS?

691
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,770
I MEAN,I KNOW EACH
ONE OF YOU HAS ONE.

692
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,710
ACTUALLY,THERE'S JUST THE ONE.

693
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,900
WE SHARE.

694
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,300
IT'S A ROTATION.

695
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,730
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
LET'S JUST DO THIS.

696
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,020
ALL RIGHT.

697
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,300
HI. HELLO.

698
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,320
UH,NO. SORRY.

699
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,000
I SAW "WEDDING CRASHERS"

700
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,850
AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING IN.

701
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,330
OK. SORRY.

702
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,260
THAT'S IT? THAT
WAS YOUR BIG PLAN?

703
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,800
HE SAW THE MOVIE. WHAT
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

704
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,060
WHAT? ALL RIGHT. PLAN B TIME.

705
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,540
SET THE JOINT ON
FIRE,SMOKE 'EM OUT.

706
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,960
SPLIT UP,CIRCLE
AROUND THE BUILDING,

707
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,260
FIND ANOTHER ENTRANCE.

708
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,460
MY PLAN B WAS BETTER.

709
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,900
HEY,DID YOU HAPPEN TO
SEE THE BRIDE ANYWHERE?

710
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,760
UH,YEAH. ACTUALLY,SHE-

711
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,570
SHE JUST RAN UP THAT WAY.

712
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,970
UH... MIKE?

713
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,000
Man: ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT ME.

714
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,870
BUT TELL ME.

715
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,150
ISN'T THE BRIDE JUST GLOWING?

716
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,860
MIKE?

717
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,770
JUST COME OUT. MAKE IT EASY.

718
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,820
Mike: HOW 'BOUT YOU
RECONSIDER MY OFFER?

719
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,240
YOU AND ME NEED
TO JUST GET CRAZY

720
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,740
AND HAVE SOME FUN
TOGETHER FOR ONCE.

721
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,290
YOU KILL PEOPLE,MIKE.

722
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,640
YOU TRIED TO KILL GLADYS.

723
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,120
AH,COME ON. I KNEW
SHE WOULDN'T DIE.

724
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,040
YEAH,WELL,SHE GOT
SENT BACK TO HELL.

725
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,360
REALLY?

726
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,270
TOO BAD I WON'T
BE JOINING HER.

727
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,520
YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE CAREFUL
OF THAT SHUTTER FINGER,SAM.

728
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,180
HOW MANY FLASHES
DO YOU HAVE LEFT?

729
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,690
CRAP.

730
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,490
YEAH,YOU COULD
HAVE DONE IT MY WAY,

731
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,110
BUT YOU HAD TO BE A HERO.

732
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,520
I USUALLY WORK ALONE,SAM,

733
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,440
BUT WE MIGHT'VE MADE
A GOOD TEAM,YOU AND ME.

734
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,420
YEAH,I'VE SEEN WHAT YOU DO.

735
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,860
I'VE SEEN THE CONSEQUENCES.

736
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,860
BUT SAM,THE CONSEQUENCES
ARE THE BEST PART.

737
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,040
THE MOURNING AND SUFFERING
OF HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN.

738
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,900
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOUR
LOVED ONES CRYING OVER YOU.

739
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,870
THAT HOT,LITTLE
GIRLFRIEND OF YOURS,

740
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,490
I BET SHE'LL NEED A
LOT OF COMFORTING,SAM.

741
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,840
A LOT.

742
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,560
ALMOST,SAM.

743
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,690
SO CLOSE.

744
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,330
NO MORE FLASHES LEFT.

745
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,540
AND IF YOU CAN'T SEE
ME,YOU CAN'T CATCH ME.

746
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,420
IF I WAS A NICE
GUY,I'D MAKE THIS QUICK.

747
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,210
BUT I AM NOT NICE.

748
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,520
OHH!

749
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,040
BOY.

750
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,890
I LOVE YOU GUYS
SO MUCH RIGHT NOW.

751
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,030
HUH.

752
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,910
CAMERA REALLY
DOES ADD 10 POUNDS.

753
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,680
IT'S SARA.

754
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,750
MAYBE SHE'S GOT AN UPDATE.

755
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,120
HEY,WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD?

756
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,490
DID HE TAKE THE BRIBE?

757
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,860
HELLO,MY DARLING.

758
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,840
YEAH,HI.

759
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,820
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH IMMIGRATION?

760
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,760
OH,NO. THIS IS VERY AWKWARD.

761
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,120
THERE WAS NO
BRIBE. I MADE IT UP.

762
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,160
WHAT? WHY?

763
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,620
WELL,I'M AFRAID I'VE GONE
"ON THE LAM," AS THEY SAY.

764
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,170
BUT YOU HAVE MY MONEY

765
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,900
AND THEY'RE GOING
TO SEND ME TO JAIL.

766
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,670
BEN,WE DID TRY TO
DEFRAUD YOUR GOVERNMENT.

767
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,090
WE BOTH KNEW THERE WAS A RISK
OF IMPRISONMENT,DIDN'T WE?

768
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,300
THANK YOU,DARLING.

769
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,090
BUT I'M THE ONLY
ONE GOING TO JAIL.

770
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,120
BEN,YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

771
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,240
JAIL WOULD ACTUALLY BE
VERY,VERY GOOD FOR YOU.

772
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,360
YOU NEED TOUGHENING UP.

773
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,040
YOU'RE VERY EASILY DUPED.

774
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,160
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE GOT TO HOP.

775
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,510
BUT LISTEN TO ME.
VERY GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

776
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,980
AND PLEASE KNOW
THAT IN MY HEART,

777
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,570
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
MY FIRST HUSBAND.

778
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,500
I LEFT YOU SOME MAC AND
CHEESE IN THE FRIDGE.

779
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,540
YOU WEREN'T GONNA
EAT THIS,WERE YOU?

780
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,650
NO. GO AHEAD.

781
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,770
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

782
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,540
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

783
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,940
DON'T TELL ME THAT,KENNETH.

784
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,340
I PROMISED SAM
THAT WE'D BE ABLE

785
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,810
TO GET HIM OUT OF THIS DEAL.

786
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,010
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.

787
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,450
HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THIS KID?

788
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,200
WELL... PRETTY WELL. WHY?

789
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,310
SOMEONE WENT THROUGH THIS
AND VERY CAREFULLY REMOVED

790
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,130
EVERY PAGE THAT REFERENCES
WHO SAM'S FATHER IS.

791
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,930
WELL,THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

792
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,220
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

793
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,430
MY GUESS,TO HIDE THE IDENTITY

794
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,850
OF SAM'S REAL FATHER.

795
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,470
WELL,WHO IS IT?

796
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,850
YOU KNOW,FOR A GIRL TAKING
HER MAN TO THE JOINT,

797
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,320
YOU ARE REFRESHINGLY
UNDERSTANDING.

798
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,600
THAT'S BECAUSE AFTER
ALL THIS IS OVER,

799
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,940
MY BOYFRIEND'S NOT
GONNA BE MARRIED ANYMORE.

800
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,130
THAT'S WEIRD. HA HA.

801
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,500
I'M GONNA MISS YOU
GUYS WHILE I'M IN JAIL.

802
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,440
IT'S ONLY 8 DAYS.
IT'LL GO FAST.

803
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,990
I GOT YOU SOME STUFF.

804
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,920
THERE'S A CALLING CARD
FOR THE PAY PHONES,

805
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,660
SOME MAGAZINES,OH,AND
EARPLUGS,

806
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,810
IN CASE YOUR CELLMATE SNORES.

807
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,440
THANK YOU,MAN,THAT'S
VERY THOUGHTFUL.

808
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,780
I GOT YOU A PRESENT,TOO,BEN.

809
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,610
YOU DID? YEAH. PICK A HAND.

810
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,920
OH... THIS ONE.

811
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,200
THAT ONE? YEAH.

812
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,470
OHHH!

813
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,190
IT'S A MANLY BLACK
EYE. ALL RIGHT,LOOK,

814
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,350
YOU CAN'T GO INTO THE CLINK
WITH A PRETTY MUG LIKE THAT.

815
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,960
RIGHT? RIGHT?

816
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,360
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND. I KNOW.

817
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,320
GOOD.

818
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,800
I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU.

819
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,010
COME ON. LET'S HAVE A 3-WAY.

820
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,210
HUG,I MEAN.

821
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,390
AH,THERE HE IS.

822
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,070
MAN OF THE HOUR.

823
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,910
YOU REALLY WENT ABOVE
AND BEYOND,KIDDO.

824
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,360
TRULY EXCEPTIONAL JOB.

825
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,310
THANK YOU.

826
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,380
NO. I MEAN IT.

827
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,460
I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN
SHOW MY GRATITUDE THIS TIME.

828
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,120
TURKEY JERKY? HUH?

829
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,750
I KNOW HOW YOU CAN THANK ME.

830
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,020
YEAH? GO AHEAD.

831
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,630
LET GLADYS GO.

832
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,460
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

833
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,990
BECAUSE IT'S GOOD BUSINESS.

834
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,890
DO TELL.

835
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,870
MIKE WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN

836
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,590
OUT OF HELL IN THE FIRST PLACE

837
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,570
IF YOUR EMPLOYEES
DIDN'T HATE YOUR GUTS.

838
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,540
SOULS ARE ESCAPING
ALL THE TIME.

839
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,740
OH,BUT IF I MADE A
GRAND GESTURE OF MERCY,

840
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,150
SPARING A VALUED EMPLOYEE,

841
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,880
THAT WOULD TURN THE
TIDE AND BOOST LOYALTY.

842
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,220
IS THAT YOUR ARGUMENT?

843
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,750
YEAH. BASICALLY.

844
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,200
YOU REALLY TAKE
THE CAKE,SAMMY.

845
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,360
YOU THINK YOU CAN
FAST TALK THE DEVIL?

846
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,000
I'VE DEBATED DANIEL WEBSTER

847
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,290
AND YOU,SIR,ARE NO
DANIEL WEBSTER. HUH?

848
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,760
NO MATTER WHAT
ARGUMENT YOU MAKE,

849
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,290
WHAT WORD YOU SAY,

850
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,980
YOU WON'T CHANGE
MY MIND. HA HA.

851
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,870
PLEASE.

852
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,860
OH,COME ON.

853
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,820
TURN OFF THOSE
PUPPY DOGS NOW,SAMMY.

854
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,030
PLEASE. DO THIS FOR ME.

855
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,700
COME ON. STOP. ENOUGH.

856
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,890
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING
YOURSELF,MAN.

857
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,610
ALL RIGHT. FINE.

858
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,730
SHE'S OUT.

859
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,210
IS SHE GONNA BE OK?

860
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,820
YEAH. SHE'LL WALK IT OFF.

861
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,950
HEY,YOU WANNA SPLIT THIS?

862
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,540
SURE. HA HA HA.

863
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,580
Kenneth: DO YOU
BELIEVE IT NOW?

864
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,080
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

865
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,360
TONY,THE KID JUST GOT
THE DMV DEMON RELEASED.

866
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,490
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW

867
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,110
THE DEVIL SHOW MERCY?

868
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,960
I DON'T KNOW.

869
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,530
TONY,YOUR REBEL FORCES
WERE ANNIHILATED,

870
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,440
BUT SAM WAS SOMEHOW
MIRACULOUSLY SAVED.

871
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,450
WHY WOULD THE DEVIL SPARE HIM?

872
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,850
SAM WAS JUST AS GUILTY
AS EVERYONE ELSE.

873
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,190
LOOK AT THEM.

874
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,210
THEY HAVE A VERY SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP,TONY.

875
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,230
VERY SPECIAL.

876
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,900
IT'S TIME YOU
RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH.

877
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,900
ALL RIGHT.

878
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,630
I BELIEVE IT.

879
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,990
SAM IS THE SON OF THE DEVIL.

880
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,630
