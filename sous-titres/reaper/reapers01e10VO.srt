1
00:00:00,686 --> 00:00:03,859
Oh, killing spree!

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,835
Sammy, you can't
escape the fire bomb.

3
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:12,108
- Cannot escape the fire bomb.
- Shut up.

4
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:13,742
Sock, remember what
I told you about

5
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:15,422
keeping your eyes
off the screen?

6
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:18,500
- Game over.
- Damn it, Ben!

7
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:20,299
You are too good.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,355
I know.
Want to run it back again?

9
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:24,685
I can't. I gotta get home.

10
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:27,040
My mom's waterproofing the basement.
I gotta help her.

11
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:29,096
Whatever. Stopped listening
to you like a year ago.

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,235
- Later, guys.
- Move, Sam! Damn it!

13
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:33,607
Eat it! Eat it, Benny!

14
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,580
Sorry I'm late.

15
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:44,192
Another death in the family.

16
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,610
Oh, my god. Are--are you ok?

17
00:00:46,936 --> 00:00:49,553
I'm fine.
It was my goldfish, Walter.

18
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:50,221
Is...

19
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:52,982
I'm terrible at
keeping animals.

20
00:00:53,246 --> 00:00:55,250
My backyard's like
a pet cemetery.

21
00:00:55,568 --> 00:00:58,260
There's only one thing to do
in a situation like this.

22
00:00:58,436 --> 00:01:00,502
Do a shot of really bad whisky.

23
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:02,123
- To Walter.
- To Walter.

24
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:03,443
Ooh, hang on.

25
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:05,452
As long as we're
drinking to him...

26
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:07,233
I wasn't gonna do this,

27
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:09,862
'cause I was afraid you'd
think I was weird...

28
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:16,732
Is that Walter?

29
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,510
I just didn't want to leave him

30
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:20,423
alone before I buried him.

31
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:24,750
- Ok. To Walter.
- To Walter.

32
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:31,020
So I missed you today.

33
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:32,903
Did you do anything
fun at work?

34
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:34,350
Yeah, I...

35
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:37,822
This is weird.

36
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:39,733
I'm gonna go flush him.

37
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:44,423
You're adorable.

38
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:46,483
Just wanted you to know that.

39
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,663
Sammy, Sammy.

40
00:01:57,228 --> 00:01:59,872
- Hello, Sam.
- Guys!

41
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,202
I thought you were waterproofing
the basement tonight.

42
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:04,113
- Nice try.
- How did you find me?

43
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:05,831
We followed you, Sam.

44
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:08,472
Ben drove here with his
headlights off the entire time.

45
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:09,651
It was very stressful.

46
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:12,242
We know what you're up to, Sam.
We saw you with Beelzebabe.

47
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:13,992
- All right, keep your voices down.
- Why?

48
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:15,672
Sam, what's a matter?
You afraid someone

49
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,133
might hear me talking about you
dating the devil's daughter?

50
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,913
- She's not the devil's daughter!
- Her mother was his girlfriend.

51
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:23,243
That doesn't prove anything.
She's not related to the devil.

52
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,283
- Why are you keeping her from us?
- Because I knew you'd act like this.

53
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:27,752
Did you ask her
about her father?

54
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:29,790
Ask her what?
"Hey, are you the spawn of satan?"

55
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:31,942
- Come on, Ben, this is retarded.
- I'm asking her.

56
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:33,732
- Out of your own good.
- No, you're not.

57
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:35,631
- Asking her.
- No, you're not.

58
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:37,133
End of story. Shut it.

59
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:39,550
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, you.

60
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:43,532
Cady Hansen,
this is Sock and Ben.

61
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:45,172
It's nice to meet you guys.

62
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,463
Do you want a drink?
It's on me.

63
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:50,543
Ok...

64
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:55,501
Yes. I will drink on you.

65
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,632
You--you want to dance?
Want to--

66
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:02,052
Let's get out of here.

67
00:03:02,258 --> 00:03:03,652
What about my drink?

68
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:10,213
I'm--I'm sorry about them.

69
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:12,642
What? Oh, they're nice.

70
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:14,471
They're your... best friends?

71
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:18,451
- They look after you?
- I guess.

72
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:21,791
So do you think they're
a bit overprotective?

73
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:24,641
- I wouldn't say that.
- I would.

74
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:37,602
Season 1, Episode 10 - Cash Out
For www.forom.com

75
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:41,271
One quart of 5w30 motor oil,

76
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:44,173
complete with easy-pour spout.
4 bucks.

77
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:46,331
Nope. 2 cents.

78
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:49,981
This beautiful
squeegee-scraper...

79
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:52,033
$3.50.

80
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,100
I'm sorry, we're looking for 2 cents,
Ben. 2 cents.

81
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:58,602
I do not how this
company turns a profit.

82
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:01,420
Come on down!

83
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,572
Another contestant just in
time for the lightning round!

84
00:04:04,797 --> 00:04:06,961
Yeah. So shelly in lighting
told me that you two

85
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:09,391
did a little slow dancing
last night at the bar.

86
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:10,982
Was it your anniversary?

87
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:13,400
We were doing recon work.

88
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:16,102
Ok? We were staking
out Sam's new girl.

89
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:19,773
Sam has a... new girl?

90
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:21,250
He didn't tell me.

91
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,363
Well, he didn't tell us,
either, so...

92
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,740
Well, that's weird. I mean,

93
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,641
- why would he keep it a secret?
- We have our theories.

94
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,951
So what's wrong with her?

95
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,103
She's a huge fan
of Lionel Richie.

96
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,630
Isn't that messed up?

97
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:36,253
- Ooh, yeah.
- All night long!

98
00:04:39,438 --> 00:04:41,492
We think she's the
spawn of satan.

99
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:44,682
- Later.
- Andi, come on--

100
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:48,122
Some people are just
blind of the truth.

101
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:02,841
- Cady, hey.
- What are you wearing?

102
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,060
The usual. I don't...

103
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:09,602
Nice.

104
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:11,673
I just got out of the shower.

105
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:15,601
Just toweling off,
thinking about you.

106
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,861
Really?

107
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:22,191
I like to walk around
naked most of the time.

108
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:24,931
Feel the air on my skin.

109
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:29,133
You know what else
I like to do?

110
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:31,691
Nope.

111
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:34,812
When I really get in the mood,

112
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:39,180
I like to bite the head
off of a live chicken.

113
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:44,773
- Wh-what?
- Turn around.

114
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:50,413
- Oh, that was--oh!
- Come on, man, admit it.

115
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:53,401
- I totally hosed you.
- Please don't do that again!

116
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,972
Oh, Sammy, seriously, Cady?
My ex's daughter?

117
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:59,360
What is it, some weirdo way
of trying to get close to me?

118
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:01,652
- What are you doin'?
- Not talkin' about it with you.

119
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,230
I don't understand
the attraction.

120
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:04,703
She's gorgeous.

121
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:07,001
Well, yeah,
in a cheap kind of a way.

122
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:10,253
Hey, buddy, I tapped that gene pool.
It's a bust.

123
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,232
Oh, god.

124
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:15,732
- Here's your latest dossier.
- Oh, I can't wait.

125
00:06:16,138 --> 00:06:19,600
14 years ago, these bank robbers
tunneled under 2 city blocks.

126
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,793
They broke into the
beakman savings bank.

127
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,443
They ran off with $10 million.

128
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,061
Would have gotten
away with it, too,

129
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:27,351
except for the fact that
they were total morons.

130
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:30,043
Thaddeus Johnson, Paul Huang.

131
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,010
They got into a
fight over the money,

132
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:34,043
and they shot each other dead.

133
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,712
And the kicker?

134
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:38,700
Nobody ever figured out
where they hid the money.

135
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:40,922
It's still missing?

136
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:42,831
Not anymore.

137
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:47,142
That little pied a terre
cost a mere $4 million,

138
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:48,883
paid for in cash by Johnson.

139
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:50,560
Recently escaped from hell.

140
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:52,442
It's a bit gaudy,
don't you think?

141
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:54,632
I guess money doesn't
buy you taste.

142
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,563
- So that's it?
- Yep.

143
00:06:56,906 --> 00:06:59,520
Johnson is stupid,
but not violent.

144
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,656
Should be a quickie.

145
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,025
- A quickie, right, Sam?
- Knock it off!

146
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:20,077
So what do we do if
the soul's not home?

147
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,143
We wait till he comes back.

148
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:24,581
Well, what if your
girlfriend misses you, Sam?

149
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:26,790
Or do you have a secret
rendezvous planned

150
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:28,740
for after you finish
working for her father?

151
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:30,461
- Will you cut it out?
- No, I will not.

152
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:32,290
Not until we find
out whether Cady's

153
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,580
the devil's daughter for sure.
We need proof.

154
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:37,293
Yeah, he doesn't want to
baby-sit your kids with horns.

155
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:39,540
Yeah, you're not going to
have to worry about that,

156
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:41,823
because I would never
let you baby-sit my kids.

157
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:44,910
- Smart.
- Hey, a light came on.

158
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:46,620
Get the vessel!

159
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:00,612
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

160
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:10,940
Hello. Good evening
to you, sir.

161
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:12,850
We are from the Work Bench.

162
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:15,440
I didn't call anyone.

163
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:17,720
Actually, the city sent us out.

164
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,810
You recently bought this house,

165
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:23,313
and we're here to test for
radon in your foundation.

166
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:36,153
Sir, you are definitely
living the life.

167
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:39,481
So you need to check the,
uh--what'd you say?

168
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:41,653
Now, now, now!

169
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:43,710
Do it now, do it now,
do it now Sam!

170
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:44,853
It's not working!

171
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:46,572
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

172
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:50,982
Did you guys see that?

173
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:52,091
Did he just...

174
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:53,613
Did he...

175
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:08,672
- It's locked.
- Let's go!

176
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,491
Go, go, go!

177
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:17,211
- Right here, right here!
- He's right there!

178
00:09:17,336 --> 00:09:18,881
There he goes, there he goes!

179
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:21,392
It's not working!

180
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:23,240
Here, come on, come on!

181
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:52,900
Step aside, boys!

182
00:09:57,635 --> 00:09:59,511
- Ok, whoa!
- Wait, wait!

183
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:00,852
Wait.

184
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:04,481
I can make you rich.

185
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:08,010
Wait.

186
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:11,141
Look.

187
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,201
Let me free,

188
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:17,330
and all this money is yours.

189
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,423
There's three of you,
right? Huh?

190
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:29,753
Well, there is
plenty for everyone.

191
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:36,122
You guys could have a
lot of fun with this.

192
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:37,993
And wait.

193
00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:41,121
There's more.

194
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:47,212
I'm not goin' back.

195
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:57,210
- That's it?
- Yeah.

196
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,582
That guy sucked!

197
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:05,871
Guys...

198
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:15,381
This is it.

199
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:17,080
This is the rest of the money

200
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:20,052
Johnson and his partner
killed each other over.

201
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:30,282
Hey, Gladys.

202
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:32,231
Can I place the
vessel on the mat?

203
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,022
Place the vessel on the mat.

204
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,961
Is something wrong?

205
00:11:52,957 --> 00:11:54,360
Rejected?

206
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:56,273
Hold on, what does that mean?

207
00:11:56,597 --> 00:11:58,392
If you wish to appeal
the rejection,

208
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:01,402
fill out form 23-7.
Typical response

209
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:03,613
time is 6 to 8 weeks.

210
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:06,310
What am I supposed to do
with this in the meantime?

211
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,783
Really, really,

212
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:11,692
you're gonna put up
a sign in front of me

213
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:12,973
and pretend I'm not here?

214
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,131
Gladys, come on!

215
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:28,983
Hell is like the worst
run business ever.

216
00:12:29,077 --> 00:12:30,683
Won't let me turn in the soul.

217
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:36,503
Oh. So that's what $6
million looks like, huh?

218
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,760
I was gonna get naked
and roll around in it,

219
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:42,072
but I didn't shower today.
I didn't want to

220
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:44,360
- get the money dirty.
- Thank you for that.

221
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:45,821
Know what we need to do?

222
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:47,941
We should buy 3 fighter jets.

223
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,113
Maverick, ice man, goose.

224
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,703
Whoa, goose died.
I don't want to be goose.

225
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:54,553
No, Sock, this isn't our money.

226
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:57,043
Ice, you are killing
me with this attitude.

227
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:59,403
All right, if this isn't ours,
whose is it?

228
00:12:59,687 --> 00:13:01,751
Hey, we risked our
lives to nab the soul.

229
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:04,053
I mean,
we're entitled to spend it.

230
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,533
No, that money is stolen.
It still is stolen.

231
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:08,073
Oh, my god!

232
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:10,100
All right, fine, Sam!

233
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:12,923
You don't want us to have
any of this beautiful money?

234
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:15,622
All right. Ok, good.

235
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:17,813
I'm takin' this.

236
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:20,040
Sock, you hate alarm clocks!

237
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:21,710
I know!

238
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,592
You're making me crazy, Sam!

239
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:26,063
Ok, you cannot--
you cannot put 6 million bones

240
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,352
in front of this man's face
and then just take it away.

241
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:29,800
It's not right!

242
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:36,200
I'm broke.

243
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:42,251
So I talked to my mom today.

244
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:45,453
- She loves New Mexico.
- That's great.

245
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:47,303
Already got a new boyfriend.

246
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:49,370
I think she just
hates being alone.

247
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:51,913
Your parents still together?

248
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:54,890
That's great,
having a normal family.

249
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:57,951
Yeah, I wouldn't
call them normal.

250
00:13:58,325 --> 00:13:59,893
But they're happy.

251
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:01,990
Do you ever talk to your dad?

252
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:04,553
Never knew him.

253
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:07,792
He was a musician.
My mom met him on the road.

254
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,901
What kind of musician?

255
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:12,451
It's kinda funny.

256
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:14,952
My mom was a backup
singer for Huey Lewis.

257
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:17,820
She dated one of the band
members for a while,

258
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,740
and here I am.

259
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:22,341
Does that mean you're
a part of the news?

260
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:24,292
Can we talk about
something else?

261
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:27,261
Yeah, yeah, of course.
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,603
It's just always been
a little weird for me.

263
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:33,203
Growing up,
people would ask me about my dad,

264
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:35,252
and just look at me
like I was a freak.

265
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,750
Cady, you're not a freak.

266
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:43,040
Hey, how about
replacing Walter?

267
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,051
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

268
00:14:47,406 --> 00:14:48,472
All right.

269
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,370
And if you want to thank
me by naming it Sam,

270
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:51,852
that's totally cool.

271
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:53,840
Pick one.

272
00:14:57,257 --> 00:14:58,691
That one.

273
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:01,153
- He looks lonely.
- He's all yours.

274
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:09,643
- Jerry, you're still open?
- Yeah, we're open.

275
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:13,133
So what's the deal
with this TV?

276
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,543
Well, this is a, uh,

277
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,722
flat paneled plasma
1080p resolution,

278
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:21,802
16 by 9
widescreen, aspect-ratio,

279
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:24,540
and an incredible
10,000 to one contrast

280
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:26,920
for an arresting
viewing experience.

281
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:29,313
It's... good.

282
00:15:29,766 --> 00:15:32,230
You're just reading the sign.

283
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:37,571
- Yeah. I am.
- You're an idiot.

284
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,942
Where does that guy get off?

285
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:44,803
They don't pay you enough
to take that kind of abuse.

286
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:46,871
All right, listen,
if you're here to bug me

287
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:48,623
about the soul, forget it.
My job is done.

288
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:50,133
Gladys wouldn't
take the vessel.

289
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,301
That's because the vessel
was only half-full.

290
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:54,031
Or half-empty,
if you're catholic.

291
00:15:54,305 --> 00:15:55,593
Now this

292
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:59,102
is a security tape from
the Fidelity Central Bank.

293
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:02,190
This happened last week after
Johnson escaped from hell.

294
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:05,453
Now, this is the
really cool part, Sam.

295
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,380
Johnson had a partner.

296
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,340
Also escaped from hell.

297
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:13,773
And that's him, Paul Huang.

298
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:16,923
All right, so I'm not done
until I get the second soul.

299
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:18,393
Well, don't say it like that.

300
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:21,343
He has the same exact powers
of the guy you just caught.

301
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:22,822
Piece of cake.

302
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:26,200
Except for the fact that
Huang was the dangerous one.

303
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:28,021
You know, one time in Tacoma,

304
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:30,743
he cut down a whole bank
full of innocent bystanders.

305
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:32,670
- Oh, my god.
- Hey.

306
00:16:32,937 --> 00:16:36,132
Easy on the "G" word, buddy.
It's rude!

307
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,301
When are you going to
stop being a weenie

308
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,850
and spend some of that cash?

309
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:41,141
That money's stolen.

310
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:44,722
14 years ago,
from a bank that had insurance.

311
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:46,832
It's a victimless crime.

312
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:49,351
Now, this next part,

313
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:51,492
it's a little hard to watch.

314
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:03,362
Well, so much for
a victimless crime.

315
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,370
Better get cracking, Sammy.

316
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:15,361
Guys, hey.

317
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:16,973
I just had a visit
with the devil.

318
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:18,481
We have another problem. He--

319
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,632
Are you wearing a track suit?

320
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:24,440
Maybe.

321
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:26,130
All right, all right,
ok, all right.

322
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:27,532
We broke into your room

323
00:17:27,658 --> 00:17:29,760
and we took a little bit of money,
and we spent it.

324
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:32,553
- All right, now don't yell.
- What did you guys buy?

325
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:34,440
Health insurance.

326
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:40,381
- Platinum belt buckle.
- Sock!

327
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,400
All right, now,
I know what you're gonna say.

328
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:44,502
"No, we can't spend
any of the money!"

329
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:46,672
Yeah, because that's
exactly how I sound.

330
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:49,070
Well, Sam, bottom line is,
that is our money.

331
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:51,780
All right,
let me tell you a little story.

332
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:54,871
There was these guys who knocked
off a federal reserve bank.

333
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,851
And for a while, they spent the
money and they lived the life,

334
00:17:57,888 --> 00:18:00,092
until they turned on each other
and they killed themselves

335
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:02,520
over it. Is that what we want?
To kill ourselves over...

336
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:04,501
track suits and a belt buckle?

337
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,271
No, Sam,
that won't happen to us.

338
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:09,063
That's cool.
We don't spend any more money.

339
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:10,681
Thank you.

340
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:13,331
Come on, yahootie.
Right here. Come here.

341
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:15,500
Brotherhood.

342
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:18,152
You should keep
that suit, though.

343
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:19,600
You have never looked faster.

344
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:20,950
- Thank you.
- All right,

345
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:22,981
we have more work to do.
Come here.

346
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:25,421
Johnson's partner got out of hell,
a guy named Huang.

347
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:26,653
- Wang?
- Huang.

348
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:28,161
He's robbing banks again.

349
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:30,383
- What do we know about this guy?
- Nothing.

350
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:32,423
Ok, I'll check old reports
on the bank robbery

351
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:35,050
and see if maybe something
comes up with this Wang guy.

352
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:38,492
- All right, good.
- All right, good.

353
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,562
- Uh, Sam?
- Yeah?

354
00:18:41,878 --> 00:18:43,640
I know that we
just agreed right

355
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:46,263
now not to spend any more of the money,
but, um...

356
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:50,533
I bought more than
just this belt buckle.

357
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,763
What else?

358
00:18:55,195 --> 00:18:56,701
Oh, my god.

359
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:58,613
You gotta be kidding me.

360
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:00,313
What--what is all this?!

361
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:02,191
Ok, ok, ok.

362
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:04,012
Do you remember
a few years back

363
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:05,940
when there was a fire
at Josie's apartment?

364
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:07,512
Yeah, right before
you guys broke up.

365
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,353
Do you remember that
it was around the time

366
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:11,281
when I was exploring
my feminine side?

367
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:12,770
No.

368
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:17,021
Well, mostly I was into
jasmine-scented candles.

369
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:22,013
Did you burn down
Josie's apartment?

370
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:23,973
It's a dark part
of my life, Sam.

371
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:25,982
I'm not proud of
it anymore, ok?

372
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:27,801
This is everything
that either burnt up

373
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,671
or melted down in the fire.

374
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:31,332
Are you--are you
gonna make me...

375
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:32,561
- take it all back?
- No.

376
00:19:32,615 --> 00:19:34,333
You were trying to
do something nice.

377
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:36,243
But this is where we draw the line,
all right?

378
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,821
- This is it!
- Absolutely. This is it.

379
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:43,681
Are you trying to get
back together with Josie?

380
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,232
What? I--

381
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:48,982
I am trying to make amends,
Sam, ok?

382
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:50,772
And if she...

383
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:54,090
chooses to thank me in a
naked or partially naked way,

384
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:56,370
well, that's ok, too.
I'll take it.

385
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,470
Guys, I found a link to Huang.

386
00:19:58,967 --> 00:19:59,960
Yeah.

387
00:20:00,747 --> 00:20:03,711
There was a third robber,
an inside man, at the bank.

388
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:06,070
Holy crap.
We have to capture him, too?

389
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,750
Nope, he's alive.
Rick Forester, the bank manager,

390
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:11,270
the only guy they caught,
and he got sentenced for 10 years.

391
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:13,150
Which means he's
already out of jail.

392
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:15,481
And I found him,
and he works at a donut shop.

393
00:20:15,586 --> 00:20:17,310
Ding! Let's go.

394
00:20:20,315 --> 00:20:21,633
Excuse me.

395
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:24,350
Sir, do you happen to
know a Rick Forester?

396
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,320
Are you guys friends of his?

397
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:27,331
No.

398
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:33,751
Good. That guy is
a piece of work.

399
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:35,771
Ok, the cops came in
here this morning

400
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:37,252
- and took him away.
- Why?

401
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:39,172
Something about a bank robbery.

402
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:41,722
Guess that's what I get
for hiring a parolee.

403
00:20:41,846 --> 00:20:44,270
- Uh, is he coming back?
- No idea.

404
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:47,860
Ok, well, if he does,

405
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,032
can you have him
contact us, please?

406
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:53,933
- Thank you.
- Why don't you bag up a doz?

407
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:55,892
Damn it.

408
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:57,821
I know. That guy didn't help.

409
00:20:57,988 --> 00:20:59,932
No, there's no jelly in this.

410
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,702
I paid top dollar
for this donut.

411
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:03,480
There's not an ounce
of jelly in here.

412
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:05,781
So what do we do now?
We stake out some banks?

413
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:07,882
No point until they
open on Monday.

414
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:09,742
Hey, what time is it?

415
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:11,983
Oh, let me guess. Cady again?

416
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:14,051
Man, why are you guys
acting like this?

417
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:16,183
What? We're just looking out
for your well-being, Sam.

418
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:17,681
Well, how do I
get that to stop?

419
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:19,510
Well, is there any
way you can prove

420
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:21,343
she's not the devil's daughter?

421
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:23,411
6-6-6.

422
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:24,941
What?

423
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:27,782
6-6-6, it's the
mark of the devil.

424
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:30,090
If Cady is the
devil's daughter,

425
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:32,003
she'll have that
mark on her body.

426
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:33,691
Like from that movie, The Omen.

427
00:21:33,978 --> 00:21:36,061
Well, it's actually from
the Book of Revelations.

428
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,581
They stole that?

429
00:21:37,758 --> 00:21:39,983
Why can't anything
be original anymore?

430
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:41,723
So you want to check Cady

431
00:21:41,848 --> 00:21:43,932
to see if she has the mark
of the devil on her body?

432
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:45,150
- Exactly.
- Ok.

433
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:47,221
If that'll prove
it to you, how?

434
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:49,261
I think I know how.

435
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:56,083
This is a great hot tub, Sock.

436
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:57,831
Yeah, thanks, I know.

437
00:21:58,226 --> 00:21:59,921
Hottubbing is a
passion of mine.

438
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:03,392
But why is it in
your front yard?

439
00:22:04,345 --> 00:22:07,091
Why would I put something
this awesome in the backyard?

440
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,593
Privacy?

441
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,240
Privacy's for idiots.

442
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:19,842
I know what would be fun.

443
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:21,363
Let me--

444
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:24,300
Let me-- sorry,

445
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:26,972
let me use this braiding
technique I have

446
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:28,291
that I used on Ben.

447
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:30,170
He has a really delicate touch.

448
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:34,192
So, uh... Cady, hi.

449
00:22:34,838 --> 00:22:37,462
Why don't you, tell us a little
something about yourself?

450
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:39,193
You know, your hopes,
your dreams.

451
00:22:39,365 --> 00:22:41,971
Your wishes, your desires.

452
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:44,351
Did you ever eat an animal--

453
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:47,270
Did you ever spontaneously
burst into flames?

454
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:48,953
Ok, you know--

455
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:50,921
I am just trying to
figure out what makes

456
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:52,411
our lady friend here tick.

457
00:22:52,655 --> 00:22:54,093
No, no, it's ok.

458
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:57,982
Sam, um,
can I talk to your friends alone?

459
00:22:58,258 --> 00:23:00,960
- A-alone, why?
- It's important.

460
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:02,313
They're all yours.

461
00:23:02,705 --> 00:23:05,400
Just don't stay in too long.
You guys will shrivel up.

462
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:11,752
Not into braiding, huh?

463
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:13,770
Guys, I know what you're doing.

464
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:18,971
You want to protect
your friends!

465
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:21,320
Ok, I think that's really cute.

466
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:23,471
And I promise-- I promise,

467
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,011
I'm not trying to steal
him from you guys.

468
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:27,363
I am no Yoko.

469
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:29,983
No, you're much less
asian than Yoko.

470
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:33,082
I just really like Sam,

471
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:36,473
and I want you guys
to like me, too.

472
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:39,671
So what do I have to do
to make you trust me?

473
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,123
There is one thing.

474
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:44,431
- No.
- Yes.

475
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:46,410
- No.
- Ask anything.

476
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,331
- Anything?
- Yes.

477
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:49,342
Ok.

478
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:54,103
I recognize that this request
may make you uncomfortable.

479
00:23:56,575 --> 00:23:58,872
We need to see you naked.

480
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:01,510
Ok, so you guys see me naked,

481
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:04,433
and then problem solved.

482
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:06,410
Hey, don't get me wrong,

483
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:08,911
we are not asking
because we want to,

484
00:24:09,268 --> 00:24:11,332
we're asking
because we have to.

485
00:24:11,675 --> 00:24:14,311
Right. And we're sorry that
it has to come to this,

486
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:17,421
and we wouldn't ask if it
wasn't incredibly important.

487
00:24:17,587 --> 00:24:19,190
That's true.

488
00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:23,141
Ok. But I get to
see you naked, too.

489
00:24:24,976 --> 00:24:27,472
Fair, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

490
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:30,223
I just gotta velcro
all this stuff.

491
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:36,091
- She's devil-free.
- Congratulations.

492
00:24:36,217 --> 00:24:38,121
- So there's no mark?
- No, nothing.

493
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:39,943
She's perfect.
Literally, perfect.

494
00:24:40,015 --> 00:24:42,013
In fact, she's so perfect,
I kind of hate you

495
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,123
for it right now,
and I want to punch you in the neck.

496
00:24:44,156 --> 00:24:45,531
So that would mean she is--

497
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:47,812
Devil-free, naked,
alone in the hot tub.

498
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,581
- Oh, my god.
- Which means I should--

499
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:51,212
- Yeah.
- Right.

500
00:25:00,426 --> 00:25:01,812
I just talked to donut man.

501
00:25:01,938 --> 00:25:04,242
He just got out of jail
and he wants to talk to us.

502
00:25:04,275 --> 00:25:05,553
Let's do it.

503
00:25:05,787 --> 00:25:08,361
So, prison, huh? Bummer.

504
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:10,843
Did you at least get to
play a lot of hoops?

505
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:13,090
There's nothing fun
about prison, son.

506
00:25:13,248 --> 00:25:14,981
Especially when you
don't belong there.

507
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,373
So you're saying you didn't rob

508
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:17,831
the bank with
Johnson and Huang?

509
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:20,180
- Does it matter what I say?
- Well, Mr. Forester,

510
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:23,112
we're really interested in
hearing your side of the story.

511
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:26,243
15 years ago I was
a bank manager.

512
00:25:26,477 --> 00:25:28,172
Wife and kids,
made a good living.

513
00:25:28,405 --> 00:25:29,482
In my whole life,

514
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:32,690
I never stole so much as
a mint from a restaurant.

515
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:35,262
- Aren't they free?
- Shut up, Sock.

516
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:37,252
But I did have a
gambling problem.

517
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:39,703
That's how I got mixed up
with Johnson and Huang.

518
00:25:39,735 --> 00:25:42,131
Kept running into them in
the high stakes games.

519
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:44,712
They seemed like fun guys.

520
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,500
Until the night Huang
puts a gun to my head.

521
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:49,210
Why would he do that?

522
00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:50,912
They'd been setting me up.

523
00:25:51,037 --> 00:25:54,391
They forced me to unlock my
bank and open up the vault.

524
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:57,560
Nobody believed I
wasn't in on it.

525
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:01,483
- Not even my family.
- That's terrible.

526
00:26:01,747 --> 00:26:04,573
Tell me about it.
14 years in a federal pen.

527
00:26:05,048 --> 00:26:07,052
Marcy got remarried.

528
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:09,501
My kids don't know
who the hell I am.

529
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:12,031
Forester, back on register.

530
00:26:15,397 --> 00:26:17,303
All I got left is donuts.

531
00:26:21,256 --> 00:26:23,732
Think Forester's telling the truth,
he's really innocent?

532
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:25,053
Yeah, it seems like it.

533
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:27,830
- His life is pretty ruined.
- I don't know.

534
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:31,102
Probably gets free donuts, right?
At least a little discount.

535
00:26:31,226 --> 00:26:33,320
I wonder if Huang is
still into big-time poker.

536
00:26:33,356 --> 00:26:35,362
I mean,
there might be a way to track him.

537
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:36,820
Didn't Ted used to gamble?

538
00:26:37,168 --> 00:26:38,722
Yeah, he was addicted to it.

539
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:41,102
So he probably knows where
the high-stakes games are.

540
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:43,090
Uh, you guys are gonna have
to do that on your own.

541
00:26:43,128 --> 00:26:44,812
I got something
to take care of.

542
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:53,533
- Hey, pookie.
- No.

543
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,850
Whatever it is
you're selling, no.

544
00:26:56,176 --> 00:26:57,722
Oh, well, nice to see you, too.

545
00:26:57,887 --> 00:26:59,951
I mean it, Sock.
I'm tired, I'm cranky,

546
00:27:00,305 --> 00:27:02,301
and I'm really not in
the mood for this.

547
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,951
- Where did you get this?
- Where'd I get it?

548
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:12,100
Uh... look, look.

549
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:18,622
This was destroyed in the fire.

550
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,052
Look, look.

551
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,663
Flannel cupcake pajamas,
all right?

552
00:27:23,047 --> 00:27:25,801
12,000 watt blow dryer,
with diffuser accessory.

553
00:27:26,117 --> 00:27:27,583
Oh, that weird,

554
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,292
stinky bean pillow thing
that smells like bread.

555
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:31,532
Here you go.

556
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:37,862
That's jumbles, remember?

557
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:42,743
- Did you steal this?
- What?

558
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:45,771
This is thousands of dollars
worth of stuff, Sock.

559
00:27:46,135 --> 00:27:48,553
Is it stolen merchandise?

560
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,850
How dare you!

561
00:27:51,977 --> 00:27:54,523
Where'd you get the money to
pay for all this stuff, Sock?

562
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:55,661
I saved, Josie.

563
00:27:55,785 --> 00:27:58,032
I saved my little pennies
because I felt bad.

564
00:27:58,037 --> 00:27:59,113
But now I can see

565
00:27:59,237 --> 00:28:01,101
I should have kept
the money for myself,

566
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,832
because you are
ungrateful and mean.

567
00:28:04,256 --> 00:28:06,120
And, and the cupcake pajamas

568
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:08,821
make it look like you
have a third butt cheek.

569
00:28:10,846 --> 00:28:12,380
Good-night, Sock.

570
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:13,740
Hey, just to be clear,

571
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:16,363
this noble gesture's not
gonna end in sex for you!

572
00:28:18,185 --> 00:28:19,631
Or me.

573
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:24,461
Enter.

574
00:28:24,846 --> 00:28:27,231
Hey, Ted,
can we talk to you for a second?

575
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:30,740
Well, you can talk.
The question is, will I answer?

576
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:32,402
We came for some advice.

577
00:28:32,857 --> 00:28:35,521
Yeah, we need your guidance.

578
00:28:36,796 --> 00:28:40,312
If someone wanted to,
let's say, gamble...

579
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,183
Go on.

580
00:28:43,147 --> 00:28:46,253
But I mean, really gamble,
with a lot of money,

581
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:48,630
where might one go to do that?

582
00:28:48,985 --> 00:28:51,072
I can see that monkey
clinging to your back,

583
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:52,443
and it pains me.

584
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,103
There's no monkey, Ted.

585
00:28:54,257 --> 00:28:56,101
There was once a boy,
not unlike you,

586
00:28:56,155 --> 00:28:58,351
who went down that sweet
path of easy money.

587
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:00,743
He had life by the tail.
The whole world was

588
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:04,163
wide open to him.
His cards were smooth...

589
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,211
Ted, we know you
don't gamble anymore.

590
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:08,152
But can you just tell us
where the big games are,

591
00:29:08,187 --> 00:29:10,153
any place the high
rollers might play?

592
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:14,090
The highest stakes game in
the city is in Chinatown.

593
00:29:14,447 --> 00:29:17,243
But even if I told you where,
you still couldn't get in.

594
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:19,643
It's a little above
your pay grade, sonny.

595
00:29:19,956 --> 00:29:22,902
You need at least $10,000 just
to walk in the door, and I--

596
00:29:22,946 --> 00:29:25,161
We got that covered, Ted.

597
00:29:29,957 --> 00:29:32,000
Stake me,
and I'll take you there myself.

598
00:29:38,016 --> 00:29:39,453
Look familiar?

599
00:29:39,776 --> 00:29:41,383
Yeah, I remember that, sure.

600
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:43,481
Sock gave that to you.

601
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:45,833
And he just gave it
to me again today.

602
00:29:46,386 --> 00:29:48,732
Remember that fire that
he set in my apartment?

603
00:29:48,905 --> 00:29:52,061
This morning, he just replaced
everything that burned up.

604
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:54,120
This is just the
latest weirdness.

605
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,912
Sam, too,
if you haven't noticed.

606
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:57,732
Yeah, I'd have to
be blind not to.

607
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:59,221
I mean, the weird behavior,

608
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:01,033
the ducking out of
work all the time.

609
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,461
Showing up at the courthouse
asking about cases.

610
00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:04,740
Something is up.

611
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:16,062
It's ok, they're with me.

612
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:17,941
And who are you?

613
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,670
A high roller,
and that's all you need to know.

614
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:25,250
Uh, name's Ben.

615
00:30:26,878 --> 00:30:28,650
Ben Franklin.

616
00:30:29,097 --> 00:30:30,862
Perhaps you've heard of me.

617
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,251
Here's my card, all right?

618
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:37,062
I could have done that.

619
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:39,492
Nobody told me you
were allowed to bribe.

620
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:42,292
Wow, would you look at this?

621
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,833
Free booze,
hot asian chicks everywhere,

622
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:47,100
and the whole place
smells like grease.

623
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,900
- I am home.
- Slow, savor.

624
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:52,391
When entering a poker room,
it is essential

625
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:55,711
to assess one's surroundings,
take a moment to--

626
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:58,941
Smell the action.

627
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:01,531
Over here,
we have the low stakes tables.

628
00:31:01,915 --> 00:31:04,310
Down there,
you have the big daddy high rollers.

629
00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:06,341
Hey, bogey on radar.

630
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:11,040
- Copy that.
- Hey, dick-wit!

631
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:13,080
- What?
- Oh, hey, Pete!

632
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:14,993
- I want my money!
- Oh, I can't!

633
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:17,283
You wouldn't be at a high
roller game without a stake.

634
00:31:17,316 --> 00:31:18,791
Now where is it?

635
00:31:19,237 --> 00:31:21,731
Pete, that's $10,000.
I only owe you 1,200.

636
00:31:22,045 --> 00:31:23,792
I get extra for
pain and suffering.

637
00:31:26,055 --> 00:31:29,853
Oh, fellas, I am pooped.

638
00:31:30,216 --> 00:31:32,381
So I'm gonna let you
guys take it from here.

639
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:34,903
So, Peter,
it was really nice--ok?

640
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:40,222
So, who's up for a
friendly game of cards?

641
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:52,522
All our raises
are forward, sir.

642
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:54,403
Raise 2,000.

643
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,702
Evil guy hasn't budged
in like an hour.

644
00:31:58,015 --> 00:31:59,543
I'm losing my shirt here.

645
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,503
Yeah, he'll have to
take a leak eventually,

646
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,781
and then we'll get him.

647
00:32:03,168 --> 00:32:05,283
No. I'm gonna
shake him up a bit.

648
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:07,281
All right, boys, listen up.

649
00:32:09,588 --> 00:32:14,170
I'm lettin' it ride.
Letting it ri-ide.

650
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:16,852
It's not your bet, sir.

651
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,720
My bet, your bet,
what's the difference?

652
00:32:19,986 --> 00:32:21,581
Friendly gam huh?

653
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:24,073
And besides, if anybody at
the table doesn't like the way

654
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:26,301
this little poker dog barks,
they can leave.

655
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:28,400
Isn't that right?

656
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,342
Take back your chips.

657
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:35,892
For you, I will.

658
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:38,271
Because you remind
me of Mr. Sulu,

659
00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:41,082
who I love, a lot.

660
00:32:43,017 --> 00:32:46,932
Yeah, um,
I'm low on chips, so, uh...

661
00:32:48,957 --> 00:32:52,161
Can I get 10 "Gs"?

662
00:32:52,658 --> 00:32:56,823
- $10,000.
- Give me a break.

663
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,331
Finally.

664
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,360
- Let's move.
- Let's move.

665
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:05,213
Excuse me, excuse me.

666
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:09,772
You go on in,

667
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:12,450
I'll grab the stall next to him
and let loose with the vessel.

668
00:33:12,485 --> 00:33:14,981
He's back in hell, we get out of
here without our fingers broken.

669
00:33:15,018 --> 00:33:16,931
- I like it.
- Ok.

670
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:18,901
Oh, Ben, Ben!

671
00:33:20,337 --> 00:33:21,570
Benny!

672
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:29,720
I let go, he turns solid and
the wall cuts him in two.

673
00:33:29,987 --> 00:33:31,363
Makes a hell of a mess.

674
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:34,690
- What do you want?
- The soul catcher. Now.

675
00:33:38,406 --> 00:33:41,253
Ok, ok, ok, ok! Here, here.

676
00:33:42,907 --> 00:33:46,910
- Now I'll take my money.
- Uh, excuse you?

677
00:33:47,046 --> 00:33:49,190
- Your money?
- Sock! You idiot!

678
00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:52,222
10k wrapped in purple
from beakman savings.

679
00:33:52,486 --> 00:33:54,683
Oh, it didn't come
from your piggy banks.

680
00:33:55,037 --> 00:33:57,601
- Where's the rest?
- Let Ben go first.

681
00:33:57,927 --> 00:34:00,670
You have 45 minutes to bring
me the rest of my money...

682
00:34:00,856 --> 00:34:02,912
or little Benny here dies.

683
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:05,603
45? Come on,
it's gonna take an hour at least!

684
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:09,513
Tick, tick, tick, tick...

685
00:34:17,295 --> 00:34:19,440
Ben! Ben! Ben!

686
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:23,032
Drop them and back away.

687
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:24,351
No, no.

688
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:26,082
First give us our friend.

689
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,000
I seem to be holding
the high card.

690
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:32,402
Let's do it my way.

691
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:33,393
No.

692
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,602
No!

693
00:34:36,745 --> 00:34:39,402
That wall's steel
reinforced concrete.

694
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,721
No oxygen in there.

695
00:34:41,858 --> 00:34:43,850
How long can your
buddy hold his breath?

696
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:45,501
I-I don't know!

697
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:50,891
Let's try this again.

698
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:52,532
Give me the bags.

699
00:34:55,028 --> 00:34:56,132
Screw this.

700
00:34:56,506 --> 00:34:58,050
What do you think you're doing?

701
00:34:58,416 --> 00:35:00,110
The soul's already
got the vessel.

702
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:02,521
He's just gonna kill us the
minute he gets the money.

703
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,943
Why give him the satisfaction, huh?
Look at that!

704
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,632
- Oh, Sam-sammy!
- Right?!

705
00:35:06,908 --> 00:35:09,172
Oh, please,
you're trying to bluff a poker player.

706
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:10,881
That's embarrassing!

707
00:35:11,218 --> 00:35:13,803
It's devil money, all right?
It's cursed!

708
00:35:14,108 --> 00:35:17,240
Hey, Sam, I'm so sorry!
I'll take back the track suit.

709
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,821
No! This money will
never ruin another life.

710
00:35:20,096 --> 00:35:21,473
No, don't Sam!

711
00:35:22,248 --> 00:35:23,613
It ends here!

712
00:35:32,057 --> 00:35:33,053
Sam!

713
00:35:43,776 --> 00:35:47,230
- Underpants.
- My underpants.

714
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:50,230
My brave underpants.

715
00:36:01,336 --> 00:36:03,663
That was some primo
acting, Sammy.

716
00:36:04,035 --> 00:36:06,080
"This is the devil's money,
it's cursed!"

717
00:36:08,145 --> 00:36:11,772
No, but honestly,
you two scared the crap out of me.

718
00:36:12,138 --> 00:36:14,461
That was the only way
to get the vessel back.

719
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:18,260
You know,
I didn't like that guy.

720
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:21,832
I mean, who the hell does that,
dragging a man through the walls?

721
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,772
Wasn't cool.

722
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:26,240
You hear me? It wasn't cool!

723
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:27,823
All right, ok.

724
00:36:28,107 --> 00:36:29,602
Listen, we take this money,

725
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:31,692
we buy ourselves some
beach property with one

726
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:33,632
of those little infinity
pools in the front.

727
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:35,143
The devil's smart.

728
00:36:35,268 --> 00:36:37,571
There's a reason he was so keen
on getting us to spend this.

729
00:36:37,606 --> 00:36:39,823
He knew this much cash
would eventually corrupt us,

730
00:36:39,857 --> 00:36:42,280
make us turn on each other,
just like the bank robbers.

731
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:43,872
Nah, that would never happen.

732
00:36:44,206 --> 00:36:45,722
Actually, he's right. I...

733
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:47,880
I had sort of planned on
buying a record label

734
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,613
and not letting
you guys in on it.

735
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:52,153
- What?!
- I didn't do it.

736
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:54,660
So who gets the cash?

737
00:36:54,997 --> 00:36:57,723
Somebody who deserves it
a lot more than we do.

738
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:06,412
Damn it! Great.

739
00:37:08,766 --> 00:37:10,542
Hold your water.

740
00:37:27,726 --> 00:37:29,601
Quit this crappy job.

741
00:37:48,548 --> 00:37:50,611
All right, you gotta leave.

742
00:37:50,986 --> 00:37:53,151
- I'm meeting somebody here.
- Who? Cady?

743
00:37:53,418 --> 00:37:54,882
Good-bye. Yes.

744
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:56,852
What, are you gonna take
her out on the town?

745
00:37:56,887 --> 00:37:58,791
Oh, wait, you can't.
You're poor.

746
00:37:58,915 --> 00:38:01,163
What can I say?
I thought Forester deserved the money.

747
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,682
I did the right thing.

748
00:38:04,216 --> 00:38:06,641
You know,
you sounded just like Jimmy Stewart

749
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,971
for a second. I have chills.

750
00:38:09,098 --> 00:38:10,813
Would you like to
take a little glimpse

751
00:38:10,846 --> 00:38:12,612
into Mr. Forester's future?

752
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:16,462
A year-long gambling
binge in South America.

753
00:38:16,698 --> 00:38:17,993
And all that money's gone,

754
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:20,291
and he'll be homeless
by next Christmas.

755
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,660
Now, do you still feel
good about yourself?

756
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:25,873
- Hey, Sam.
- Cady, hey.

757
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:27,440
Um, this--

758
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:29,890
- Hi, Jerry.
- Cady.

759
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:33,432
- How's your mom?
- She's great...

760
00:38:34,415 --> 00:38:36,463
Since she dumped you.

761
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:43,193
First round is on me.

762
00:38:44,486 --> 00:38:45,921
Good-night.

763
00:38:48,468 --> 00:38:50,871
I forgot you knew that guy.

764
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:53,901
What, are you guys
friends or something?

765
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:56,331
No. No, no, no, definitely not.

766
00:38:56,608 --> 00:38:57,922
He, uh...

767
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:00,783
He knows my dad.

768
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:02,483
Dad.

769
00:39:03,698 --> 00:39:04,691
Is...

770
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:06,941
Is something wrong?

771
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:08,973
Sam, I lied to you.

772
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:13,222
I'm not actually the daughter
of Huey Lewis' bandmate.

773
00:39:16,347 --> 00:39:17,342
Ok...

774
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:19,492
The truth is,

775
00:39:19,615 --> 00:39:22,001
I have no idea who
my real father is.

776
00:39:22,387 --> 00:39:24,133
And there's this
weird period where

777
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:27,822
my mom said my dad might
actually be... Jerry.

778
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:30,900
No.

779
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:35,013
No, no, that's not possible.

780
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:37,490
The thought of me
being his kid...

781
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,292
Listen to me, you--

782
00:39:41,695 --> 00:39:44,223
You don't have one thing
in common with that guy.

783
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:46,831
All right, he's bitter,
cynical, hurtful.

784
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,220
You, you're funny.
You have a huge heart.

785
00:39:49,468 --> 00:39:52,881
You love people and
animals and Huey Lewis.

786
00:39:55,298 --> 00:39:58,793
This hand does not contain
one scrap of that guy's DNA.

787
00:40:00,658 --> 00:40:02,602
I'd stake my life on that.

788
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:12,871
You're an amazing,
awe-inspiring boyfriend.

789
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:26,641
