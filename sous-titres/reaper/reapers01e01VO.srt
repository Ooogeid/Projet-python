Season 1 | Episode 01
 Pilote (v. 1.0)

6
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:26,881
Don't, don't say anything.

7
00:00:27,196 --> 00:00:28,247
But we have to...

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,013
Hey, Tiger! Look at you up early.

9
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:33,682
- Yeah, I just... I got this meeting...
- Great!

10
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:37,936
Happy birthday buddy!

11
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:41,148
I'm gonna eat some breakfast.

12
00:00:41,718 --> 00:00:42,816
Happy birthday!

13
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:44,846
I love you so much!

14
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:49,461
I want you to have a wonderful day.

15
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:51,531
No matter what happens.

16
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:53,224
OK, OK, mom.

17
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:54,953
- Right.
- Good.

18
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:02,211
Hey! The zombie's up before noon.

19
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:03,503
Hey! You're an idiot!

20
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,547
Kyle, wish your brother's birthday?

21
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:08,467
The guy's 21, lives with his parents,
and wears an apron.

22
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:10,359
There's no happy in that birthday.

23
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:11,739
Don't tease your brother.

24
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:14,723
<i>A fire broke out last night,
killing a family of 4.</i>

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,358
<i>It's the 4th suspicious blaze in a week.
An arsonist, again, is suspected.</i>

26
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:26,235
Hey, was that an envelope
for Stanford that I saw yesterday?

27
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,554
You heard from Stanford?

28
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:33,183
- It was a rejection letter.
- Kyle, how is that possible?

29
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:35,630
- Sam didn't even go to college!
- Yes he did, Kyle.

30
00:01:35,753 --> 00:01:38,288
- For a month!
- We're very proud of him for trying.

31
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:39,929
It's just college made him sleepy.

32
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,295
Morning Mrs O, Mr O.
Birthday boy!

33
00:01:44,294 --> 00:01:46,317
Hey Kyle, guess what!
Don't sweat Stanford, man.

34
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:49,341
Heard it's only the fourth best
university in the US. Is that right?

35
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:51,426
You suck!

36
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:54,972
No shame in community college, K-fed.
I almost went.

37
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:57,641
So, big birthday plans, boys?

38
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,260
Oh no, nothing too crazy.

39
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:01,500
Come on Sam, you've got a...

40
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:04,029
You gotta go out there and cut loose!

41
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:05,440
You're only this age once.

42
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:06,961
I like your thinking, Dad.

43
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:10,320
We all get in the car, go get
some smack, kill a hooker in Vegas.

44
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:16,034
I mean... patronize a hooker!
And Vegas...

45
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:17,744
I'll never kill a hooker in Vegas!

46
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,831
- I'll never kill a hooker.
- Dad, what the hell is going on?

47
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:22,888
Nothing, nothing.

48
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:25,585
You just have a great day, Sam. OK?

49
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:26,915
A great day.

50
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,280
What was that?

51
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:30,903
Think they still do it?

52
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,428
Yeah, they do it.

53
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:44,471
All I'm saying is you better prepare
for alcohol poisoning, all right?

54
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:48,025
Nothing hospital grade, mind you.
Wear some puke resistant clothing.

55
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:49,745
We're getting silly tonight my man.

56
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:52,362
- We are going...
- To the Brick House where we always go.

57
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:56,337
No. Why... No!
Do you think that's all I would...

58
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:57,909
plan for your big 21?

59
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:00,381
No! God! Unless you want to go.

60
00:03:00,518 --> 00:03:02,539
That was weird, right? My parents.

61
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,666
Mom and Dad Oliver?
They're always weird.

62
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,295
I mean, my brother is right.
Didn't exactly stick it out in college.

63
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:11,711
- 'cause it made you sleepy.
- Well, yeah! That's true, but...

64
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,843
What I do when I dropped out?
I came right here.

65
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,164
I've been here since I was sixteen.
Do we really wanna be here in 5 years?

66
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:18,388
- Yes.
- Ten?

67
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:19,918
Yes. Because...

68
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,434
I'm going to eventually
turn this into a topless Work Bench.

69
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:24,100
Would you rather buy insulation from

70
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,813
somebody wearing clothes
or somebody wearing no clothes?

71
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:29,566
Is that weird? You're looking at me
as if it's weird. What?

72
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,569
<i>Holy crap! Look at that!</i>

73
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:35,113
Look at this dog, man!
He's the best dog ever.

74
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:37,741
Maybe you wanna get out on my side.

75
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:39,442
<i>No. Hold on. Hold on.</i>

76
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,251
That was good.

77
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,016
- Wanna know what you can change?
- No!

78
00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:51,343
- Yes.
- No.

79
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:54,639
Ask Andi out! Ask her out tonight, man.
Get her drunk, ask her to a movie.

80
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:57,864
The window is closed. We're friends.
She just wants to be friends.

81
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,778
How do you know that?
You never even try.

82
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:02,280
- I did but then her dad died.
- So...?

83
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,357
I mean, oh yeah, that's sad.
But so what?

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,735
You don't do that.
You don't jump in after that.

85
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:09,756
- You'll look like a dick!
- Two years ago, man. She got over it.

86
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:11,710
She digs you, all right?

87
00:04:12,263 --> 00:04:14,353
Look. She's smart,
she's hot, she goes to college.

88
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:16,785
She works at a crap shack
with loosers like me and you.

89
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:19,341
- Tells you what? Top of your head.
- She's got low standards?

90
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:20,707
Exactly!

91
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:23,417
Use that to your advantage
before she figures it out. She will.

92
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,684
I'm telling you.

93
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:43,146
Complaints about the bathrooms.
May I remind you...

94
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,153
that they are separeted
by gender for a reason.

95
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,066
In the women's washroom,
somebody left...

96
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:49,244
a massive...

97
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:53,024
Nice of you to join us.

98
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:55,944
Only 15 minutes late this time.
We're so honored.

99
00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:58,822
Hey Oliver! Happy birthday.

100
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,408
Hey, thank you.

101
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:03,014
You won't be thanking me tonight

102
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,662
when I'm hazing you like
a sorority chick at your shindig.

103
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:07,951
Can you two zip it?

104
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:10,226
I'm trying to hear
Ted's important lecture.

105
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:13,994
As you can see, most of us are doing...

106
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:15,770
great in the sales contest.

107
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:17,549
Except for a select few...

108
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,434
who think their time is better spent...

109
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,927
constructing beer bogs.

110
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,876
Oh, if you're referring to me,
Ted the head,...

111
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,461
I'm biding my time.

112
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:27,115
OK? Like a snake...

113
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:29,144
in the grass, ready to pounce.

114
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,250
That does'nt make any sense,
what you just said.

115
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,197
And don't forget the winner receives

116
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,985
a free 20 pounds spiral cut ham.

117
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,390
- I'm jewish, you jerk!
- Or gifts certificate.

118
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:40,002
for our.... semitic...

119
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:41,656
and our muslim friends.

120
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:43,366
So go get them!

121
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,749
Hey I got you a present.

122
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:54,072
Andi, you didn't have to do that.

123
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,756
Don't open it in front of me, OK?
It gives me like a...

124
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:00,509
- Gift giving anxiety...
- All right.

125
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,721
I hope your day off is tomorrow,
because you're gonna be hurting.

126
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:09,719
Oh no, no. My day off is saturday.

127
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:11,520
What about you?

128
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:13,813
My day off is saturday too.

129
00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:17,008
Do you have any plans on saturday?

130
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:18,860
Your day off.

131
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:23,532
I'm gonna be sitting in a library,
working on apsych paper, being lame.

132
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:26,618
Right, no, I have got plans also.

133
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,566
Sleeping,

134
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,541
waking up, getting dressed.

135
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,502
XBOX.... I need you to punch me
in the face right now.

136
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,479
- What do you think you're doing?
- I was...

137
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,358
We don't pay you
to watch television, Sam.

138
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:58,400
and you're name tag is crooked.

139
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:02,237
- This attitude thing has gotta stop.
- Right.

140
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:04,364
Did sales contest
for people like you, bud.

141
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:05,707
Right?

142
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,456
It's not just about ham.

143
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,452
It's about self respect.

144
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:12,336
Can't just keep skateboarding
thrugh life anymore.

145
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,083
It's not gonna cut it here,
at the Bench.

146
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:16,918
OK?

147
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,106
You're on notice, Sam.

148
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:29,472
- What was that?
- Ted says I'm on notice.

149
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:32,267
So what? I live on notice.
What did you do?

150
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,428
I don't know.
I was just watching this...

151
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:36,415
show that was really scary.

152
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,774
Yeah yeah... those things will kill you.

153
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:54,244
Holy croak!

154
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:56,416
Oh my...! Did anybody see that?

155
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,544
Did anybody see that?

156
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:02,208
Can I get a... Somebody say something!

157
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,632
Oh my God!

158
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:05,675
That was wicked, man!

159
00:08:06,123 --> 00:08:08,624
It's like when the baby's...
stuck under a car or a bus,

160
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:11,330
the mom's pumped up with adrenaline
and lifts it up over her head!

161
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:13,099
You proved better than that thing, man!

162
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:14,267
I didn't touch it!

163
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,481
- What do you mean?
- I didn't touch it.

164
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:18,146
That was too far away!

165
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:21,066
It was too far away! It's like
I moved it with my mind or something...

166
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:23,693
And that's not the first time
this is happening today.

167
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,201
Something is really...

168
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,322
What the hell, man!

169
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:29,472
You were supposed
to move that with your mind.

170
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:42,545
Oh my God, Sam!
Is this because of me?

171
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:44,214
Sorry.

172
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:46,216
This is because of Sock.

173
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,804
You saved my life, you know that.

174
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:52,389
I mean,

175
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:53,667
you're like...

176
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:55,016
Batman.

177
00:08:56,277 --> 00:08:59,448
No, no. I'm definitly not Batman, I...

178
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:02,399
I just think it was one of those
weird adrenaline. "Car mom" things.

179
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:06,611
- I don't know what that means.
- Yeah, neither do I.

180
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:10,865
Well, it was really brave, so thank you.

181
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:12,497
Yeah, and I...

182
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,990
Listen Andi. Look,
I know you're busy on saturday

183
00:09:19,113 --> 00:09:21,897
but I was just thinking maybe,
you could...

184
00:09:23,136 --> 00:09:25,004
This... this is bad idea.

185
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,469
What?

186
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,049
Andi, go.

187
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:43,948
OK.

188
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:49,027
Nice doggies.

189
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:51,132
Good, good doggies.

190
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:02,088
Sock, Sock! Help! Help!

191
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:03,892
Help! Help! Sock!

192
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:05,054
Buddy!

193
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:13,511
Run, bitches!

194
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,811
Run!

195
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:18,125
Run, you measly lazy horde!

196
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,667
Tell Ted I'm sick. I'm going home.

197
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:31,822
Did you like that in there?

198
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:34,073
That thing with the air conditioner

199
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:35,604
You're like a hero now.

200
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:36,957
My gift to you.

201
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:38,953
Is this a carjack?
Are you carjacking me?

202
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:41,122
For this? If it was an Escalade, maybe.

203
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:43,175
- You can have the car.
- I don't want the car.

204
00:10:43,312 --> 00:10:45,212
You can have the car, I just... don't...

205
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:46,753
I'm not a carjacker.

206
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:48,171
I am the Devil.

207
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,313
Your name tag is crooked.

208
00:11:05,077 --> 00:11:06,417
Hey, are you OK?

209
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:09,205
Do you want me to call an ambulance?

210
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,622
Sir... Are you all right?

211
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:22,516
Hey, Sammy!

212
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:27,001
Dad what... what are you doing?

213
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,047
Waiting for you.

214
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:31,881
- You OK?
- No.

215
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:34,717
I think...
I think I might be going insane.

216
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:36,974
Bad day.

217
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:38,751
Let see...

218
00:11:39,694 --> 00:11:41,471
Got chased by a pack of dogs...

219
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:44,437
Moved an air conditioner
with my mind... Oh, and...

220
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:47,047
The Devil tried to carjack me so....

221
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:49,649
Overall... Not a great day.

222
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,277
Sit down, Sam.

223
00:11:58,338 --> 00:11:59,980
There is something I...

224
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,911
I have to tell you... I...

225
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:04,831
I probably should have told you
this a long time ago, I....

226
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:07,712
Before you were born,...

227
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,211
your mom and I...

228
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,792
sold your soul to the Devil.

229
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:22,391
- What?
- I was really really sick, and...

230
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:24,741
He came to us and offered us a cure.

231
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:26,491
And in exchange...

232
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:30,773
He would take the soul of
our first born when he turned 21.

233
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,631
Your mom and I thought "OK, that's
fine. We just won't have children.

234
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:40,664
Because if there is no first born,
then there is no soul to take."

235
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,329
About a year later, Dr. Burke told me
that I was infertile and

236
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:46,940
we thought
"That's great! Nothing to worry about."

237
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:48,541
Right...

238
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:51,858
Except that as it turns out,
old Dr. Burke...

239
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:54,707
had a bit of a gambling problem and,...

240
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,963
Devil paid off his debts.

241
00:12:57,524 --> 00:13:01,054
And, in exchange Doc had to tell
this one little lie...

242
00:13:02,362 --> 00:13:04,974
Next thing you know... we're pregnant.

243
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,814
I'm so sorry, Sam, I...

244
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:15,461
I wish I could
make you forgive me but...

245
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:17,779
How can you?

246
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:27,548
We started whithout you, birthday boy!

247
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:30,510
Bud, we are finishing with you
'cause you're buying. Let's go.

248
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,693
I'm sure there was
a cigarette butt in it.

249
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:45,515
- Need to talk to you now.
- Come on.

250
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:47,934
Where are you going?
Don't you wanna hang out with us?

251
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:50,549
Oh, shit.

252
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:56,967
- Just give me two seconds.
- Alright.

253
00:13:57,514 --> 00:14:00,248
- Happy birthday Sam I am'.
- Thanks.

254
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,574
Can I get a round a shot
for these degenerates here? On me.

255
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,649
Oh, look at me, I'm the
big district attorney office chick...

256
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:09,747
buying all my friends free booze.

257
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:12,583
Look at me, I'm 25 year old,
and I'm still living at my parents.

258
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:15,765
You know, I don't like you guys
not all making out and stuff.

259
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:18,297
You were so cute together.
You shouldn't have broken.

260
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:20,715
Actually I had to, Andi.
Because I found out that...

261
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:22,510
she used to be a dude!

262
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:25,430
I heard you used to be a dude too!

263
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:28,975
But I heard
that you had one time a friend.

264
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:31,285
I don't have to go to the bathroom, Sam.

265
00:14:31,408 --> 00:14:33,541
I know, something happened.

266
00:14:34,771 --> 00:14:36,939
Well yeah, I do have
to go to the bathroom.

267
00:14:37,764 --> 00:14:40,074
I have a problem.
I have a serious problem.

268
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:41,237
Okay. Go.

269
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,176
Dude, seriously.

270
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:48,828
Stop looking at my junk.

271
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:55,752
All right. Go.

272
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,734
My parents...

273
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,127
sold my soul to the devil.

274
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:11,851
- How drunk are you?
- Totally sober.

275
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:15,927
- How drunk am I?
- The dogs, the air conditionner,

276
00:15:16,063 --> 00:15:17,180
I mean...

277
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:19,734
I... I believe this.

278
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:28,076
- You lucky bastard.
- What?

279
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:30,195
Nothing cool like that
never happens to me, man.

280
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,437
No, Sock, this isn't cool, it sucks!

281
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,150
It doesn't suck! Whatcha talking about?
You wanted some change.

282
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:36,776
Check it out, buddy! Wish granted.

283
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:40,658
You're the magic devil guy
with the kung-fu mind grip now!

284
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:43,296
- You gonna tell Andi?
- No! She knows, she think I'm a freak.

285
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:46,331
- She'll never go out with me.
- You can make her go out with you.

286
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:47,738
All right. I'm going home.

287
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,368
Just make some excuses,
don't say anything, all right?

288
00:15:50,786 --> 00:15:51,893
Alright.

289
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:54,560
Leave out the...

290
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,214
devil thing, right?

291
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,101
Well, that's really nice.

292
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:34,591
Not too gay at all.

293
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:45,153
Hey, look, I get it. It's a big deal.

294
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:47,814
You didn't choose it. Not fair.

295
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,241
Nobody's blaming you for freaking out.

296
00:16:52,694 --> 00:16:54,115
Yes, sir.

297
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:55,454
Chicken fried steak.

298
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:00,070
Oooh. I'm so glad I don't have arteries.

299
00:17:01,427 --> 00:17:03,108
- Oh, do you want to try some?
- No.

300
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:07,085
Do I have to...

301
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:10,645
- Do I have to go to hell now?
- Now?

302
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:13,472
No-no-no-no-no. Not now.

303
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,063
You're gonna work for me here
in the earthly realm.

304
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:20,062
Like... kill people?

305
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:22,804
You're a real pessimist.

306
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,817
Of course you won't be murdering anyone.

307
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,875
You're just gonna bring escaped souls,
back to hell. Like a bounty hunter.

308
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:31,678
That's cool, right?

309
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,051
- You got any root beer?
- Wai... Wait a second.

310
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:37,663
So people can break out of hell?

311
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:40,872
Yeah. Yeah, that's a problem
we've been having lately.

312
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,928
You know, with the overcrowding
and so forth.

313
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:48,007
Honestly, we were hardly prepared
for the influx. I blame myself.

314
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:50,680
Oh, yeah.

315
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,662
But that's not your problem.

316
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,466
All you have to do,...

317
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,744
is track down fugitives and haul
their asses over to a portal to hell.

318
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:59,936
- Easy!
- What do you mean by portal?

319
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:03,650
Well... any place
that seems like hell on earth

320
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,126
is hell on earth.

321
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:07,526
Like the DMV on Union Street?

322
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:10,348
Drop over a fugitive,
renew your licence!

323
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:12,073
I'm all about the perks.

324
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:14,158
Oh, my God!

325
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:17,550
Kiddo, it's OK!

326
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,820
I've seen how this all ends.

327
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:21,594
Don't worry.

328
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:23,595
God wins.

329
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:26,673
And you'll be doing humanity a favor

330
00:18:26,793 --> 00:18:29,048
by putting bad guys right back
where they belong.

331
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:34,993
What would I have to do?

332
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:40,252
There is your fugitive.

333
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:44,522
He broke out of hell
after 50 years for arson.

334
00:18:44,642 --> 00:18:46,812
All those little fires
around town lately?

335
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:49,094
- He set them.
- He's a fireman.

336
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:50,778
Well, he is now, yes.

337
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:53,781
But when he was alive,
he was a big time firebug.

338
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:55,969
Can't you just taste the irony?

339
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,742
No.

340
00:18:57,896 --> 00:19:00,454
This upright citizen belongs in hell.

341
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,542
Oh, gag... Look at that tool.

342
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:06,492
Will you capture him already?

343
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,879
You want me to kill him?

344
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,800
What's this obsession with murder?
The guy's already dead!

345
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,177
What do you want?
How am I supposed to capture him?

346
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:16,688
This will help.

347
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:21,017
A vessel.

348
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:23,293
Hand crafted in the bowels of perdition

349
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,937
by the iniquitous and the vile.

350
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:29,192
Oh, I forgot. You got 600 on your SAT.

351
00:19:29,312 --> 00:19:31,560
I understand what it means,
just I'm not doing this, OK?

352
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:33,955
I'm not gonna be
your stupid bounty hunter.

353
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:43,164
You will do it.
Or I'll take your mother.

354
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:48,232
You refuse to work for me,
her soul becomes forfeit.

355
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:51,949
It's the lady or the tiger, Sammy.

356
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:55,468
You think about it.

357
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:14,612
Tape hand.

358
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,389
- Doesn't look evil.
- What do you mean?

359
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:21,479
There's demon heads all over it.
Trust me it's from the devil. It's evil.

360
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,683
Sam, there's no such thing
as the devil, all right?

361
00:20:23,803 --> 00:20:26,002
I mean, the guy was probably just
some homeless person.

362
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:29,911
He wasn't homeless. He had a suit on!
And he turned night into day,

363
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:32,088
what about the telekinesis thing,
tell him about it.

364
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:33,684
What telekinesis thing?

365
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:37,846
Still working on that one.

366
00:20:37,982 --> 00:20:40,787
Alright, cool. Let's say
you did meet Satan himself.

367
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:43,886
There's no way he owns you,
cause there's no way another person

368
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:45,434
can sell another person's soul.

369
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,521
- Why not?
- Because all myths say God

370
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:49,597
granted humans free will.

371
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,775
There's no way you can give away
or sell another person's essence.

372
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:56,487
Just open it.

373
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,529
What?

374
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:18,701
What? What is it?

375
00:21:24,855 --> 00:21:26,735
- It's a Dirt Devil.
- No, I take it back, Sam.

376
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:29,145
That's a really evil mini vac.

377
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:32,024
- That devil guy was...
- ...messing with you.

378
00:21:32,161 --> 00:21:33,649
We sell those out at 15,

379
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:34,809
I think.

380
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,870
That'll work.

381
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,801
What's the plan?

382
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:03,074
Go over there...

383
00:22:03,315 --> 00:22:05,390
Do the vacuum thing and see how that...

384
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:06,825
all works out?

385
00:22:07,523 --> 00:22:09,122
I love this plan. Let's do it.

386
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:33,975
What do you think?

387
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,378
3 on 1. You got this guy in the bag.

388
00:22:41,512 --> 00:22:42,838
What does that mean?

389
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:48,724
- Now, Sam!
- Let's get him, do it!

390
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:50,601
Come on, turn the switch!

391
00:22:50,832 --> 00:22:52,561
- It's not working!
- Do it now!

392
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:55,439
Heads up!

393
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,905
Ben's hurt!

394
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:15,179
- Get up!
- I'm gonna fade!

395
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:16,585
I'm gonna fade!

396
00:23:17,622 --> 00:23:19,166
I can't feel my face!

397
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,118
Go, Sam!

398
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,105
Where were you?

399
00:23:40,488 --> 00:23:41,622
Gift shop.

400
00:23:43,837 --> 00:23:45,322
Ben would want eyebrows.

401
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:48,838
Ben would want eyebrows, and
he would want us to give them to him.

402
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,035
Say yes.

403
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,421
Just do it.

404
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,163
I should've gone alone.

405
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:54,998
What?

406
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:58,732
Is Ben OK?

407
00:23:59,122 --> 00:24:01,338
How... How did you know?

408
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,632
- I called her.
- What happened?

409
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:06,563
We... were working on a project.

410
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:09,262
- What project?
- Making napalm.

411
00:24:09,624 --> 00:24:11,932
- What?
- It's hard to explain, Andi.

412
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:15,227
- OK, well, try!
- I can't really, I don't, you know...

413
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,522
- Sam, what aren't you telling me?
- It's complicated!

414
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,774
- What did you do? Is it your fault?
- Yes Andi.

415
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:23,443
It's my fault, OK? I'm the loser
who got Ben hurt, all right?

416
00:24:32,189 --> 00:24:34,746
Don't beat yourself up over that,
man, you had to lie to her.

417
00:24:35,621 --> 00:24:38,750
Look, she's got Ben covered.
I say you and I go and burn the fireman.

418
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,086
- I'm going alone, alright?
- But, I can help, right?

419
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,839
What did I just say?
Stay away from me, alright?

420
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:46,758
I'm going back to the firehouse
and ending this.

421
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:51,133
Yeah.

422
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,499
<i>This is David Thomson
reporting for Channel 63.</i>

423
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,386
<i>As you can see behind us...</i>

424
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:36,346
Come on, Mom.

425
00:25:36,592 --> 00:25:38,177
Let's get you to bed.

426
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,156
I want to go instead.

427
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:54,409
You tell them to come for me.

428
00:25:58,311 --> 00:25:59,472
Actually...

429
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:01,317
It's over.

430
00:26:01,865 --> 00:26:04,584
I just had to do one thing for the guy,
and now I'm done.

431
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:06,838
Everything is back to normal.

432
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:13,478
- You mean your soul...
- All mine!

433
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:15,679
All right? So...

434
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,519
You don't have to feel bad, you and
Dad can treat me like I'm normal, OK?

435
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,146
OK.

436
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:23,855
OK!

437
00:26:24,864 --> 00:26:25,866
All right!

438
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:27,638
I'm so happy.

439
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:31,192
'Night, Mom.

440
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,509
I love hockey.

441
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:13,504
Lots of aggression.

442
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:14,980
Tons of blood.

443
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:18,285
- Wanna guess what's my favorite team?
- I can't do this. I tried, too hard.

444
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:20,679
My friend got hurt, I lost the fireman.

445
00:27:21,198 --> 00:27:22,880
You have the wrong guy!

446
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:26,105
So... you just take me to hell,
or whatever. I don't care.

447
00:27:26,242 --> 00:27:28,361
No, it's not the way thing works, Sammy.

448
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:30,338
You've no use for me down here.

449
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:33,925
I'm not kicking ass up, you should find
somebody else before the guy kills more.

450
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:35,441
You do this a lot, don't you?

451
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:36,803
- Do what?
- Give up.

452
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:38,489
Things get hard?

453
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:41,474
Little Sammy takes the path
of least resistance.

454
00:27:42,131 --> 00:27:43,310
Fine. I'm a failure.

455
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,589
I tell you what.

456
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:48,199
Before you throw in the towel,

457
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:51,657
why don't you do
some investigating first.

458
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:55,962
Look for motivations.
Why does the fireman do what he does?

459
00:27:56,112 --> 00:27:57,115
Who cares?

460
00:27:57,235 --> 00:27:59,910
Why burn down anything?
He already did that when he was alive.

461
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,041
Exactly!

462
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:02,326
Why?

463
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:04,130
Like I said.

464
00:28:05,374 --> 00:28:06,755
Hold on a minute.

465
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:20,477
Don't feel bad.

466
00:28:20,928 --> 00:28:22,486
He was a terrible person.

467
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:25,393
Drinker. Wife beater.

468
00:28:26,615 --> 00:28:28,563
He didn't fulfill his contract either.

469
00:28:29,937 --> 00:28:31,946
But I think you're
on the right track, Sammy.

470
00:28:32,123 --> 00:28:33,968
I feel very good about this.

471
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:38,328
Word of caution.

472
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,199
I don't accept failure.

473
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:43,344
Ever.

474
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:56,674
Sock!

475
00:28:56,884 --> 00:28:58,237
Hey, Sock!

476
00:29:07,722 --> 00:29:09,021
I'm an asshat.

477
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:10,647
Yes, you are.

478
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:13,995
So, we're cool?

479
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:17,664
Yeah.

480
00:29:19,121 --> 00:29:20,241
All right.

481
00:29:20,728 --> 00:29:23,076
- When do we throw down with fireboy?
- Let's take a walk.

482
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:25,102
Devil doesn't want to help you,
why do you care?

483
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:27,018
Because people are dying, Sock!

484
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:29,162
If you don't know 'em, does it matter?

485
00:29:29,298 --> 00:29:31,444
Alright, listen.
Do you remember Ricky Shermer?

486
00:29:33,727 --> 00:29:35,798
Yeah, from high school,
he set the gym on fire.

487
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:38,441
Seven times. He kept going back,
over and over.

488
00:29:38,564 --> 00:29:40,302
I know. Like I was nuts,
I loved that guy.

489
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:44,318
So I start thinking, why did Ricky
keep burning the same place?

490
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:46,560
'Cause he was afraid of the gym showers.

491
00:29:46,683 --> 00:29:48,765
No. No, because they kept rebuilding it.

492
00:29:48,885 --> 00:29:49,887
Right.

493
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:52,815
But, FYI, Ricky was totally afraid
or the gym showers.

494
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:57,135
I think the fireman might be burning the
same places he burned 50 years ago.

495
00:29:57,271 --> 00:29:59,404
We need to find out
who he was when he was alive.

496
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:01,249
- All right.
- Yeah, we need it.

497
00:30:01,406 --> 00:30:02,669
Access to records.

498
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:03,846
Cool. OK.

499
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:05,513
Criminal records.

500
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:13,843
- You're evil.
- I've heard.

501
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:16,324
I can't believe you came to my work!

502
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,975
I can't believe you never come to mine.
Don't you need a battery

503
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:21,535
- or Roomba or somethin'?
- I need a restraining order.

504
00:30:21,681 --> 00:30:24,087
What part of "I don't wanna
see you"? don't you understand?

505
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,491
Nobody's prouder than me that
you stopped having sex for money, Josie.

506
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:29,610
I just wish you'd stop
with all the shoplifting.

507
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:31,640
Right! You know,
all those arsons around town?

508
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,821
Think they're maybe connected
to fires 50 years ago.

509
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:36,139
We need you to look up the names,
it's not illegal.

510
00:30:36,262 --> 00:30:38,162
Probably... not illegal.

511
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:40,007
I'm a sworn officer of the court,

512
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,948
I took an oath to uphold the law.

513
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:44,162
That's funny.

514
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:47,688
Because 90% of the stuff we did
in the parking lot of this courthouse...

515
00:30:47,824 --> 00:30:49,329
is illegal in twelve states.

516
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,132
Oh, God!

517
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:56,289
Do you know
what I would magnify with this thing?

518
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:57,997
I'd make my ass my letterhead.

519
00:30:58,161 --> 00:31:01,425
Maybe you could look up the addresses,
see if any of the places burned before.

520
00:31:01,545 --> 00:31:03,188
Last was a fire station in Bellevue.

521
00:31:03,314 --> 00:31:05,971
Please check, if I'm wrong, we'll go.
You'll never see us again.

522
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:09,315
- I'm not promising that.
- For you, not for him.

523
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:17,178
Same station was set on fire in 1950.

524
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,402
But the fire was put out
before any damage was done.

525
00:31:20,055 --> 00:31:21,122
What... who?

526
00:31:24,265 --> 00:31:25,449
Ned Schmecker.

527
00:31:25,747 --> 00:31:27,182
He tried to burn down a school.

528
00:31:27,326 --> 00:31:28,679
His ex-girlfriend's.

529
00:31:29,027 --> 00:31:31,200
All unsuccessfully until the last one.

530
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:34,082
When he died in a fire he set
at his parents' house.

531
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:37,044
Probably killed himself
'cause his name was Schmecker.

532
00:31:39,263 --> 00:31:41,341
All the places that Schmecker
burned down?

533
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:44,279
They're the same places that
the arsonist burned down last week.

534
00:31:44,498 --> 00:31:47,638
- I think you're right about this.
- Has every place been torched already?

535
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:50,033
No, the parents' house
hasn't been touched. But,

536
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:52,466
it looks like it's not a house any more.

537
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:54,811
It's an elementary school.

538
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:57,606
We gotta go.

539
00:31:59,216 --> 00:32:01,690
- We gotta get to the school right now!
- One stop.

540
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,112
- What? No, what stop?
- This time, we gonna be ready.

541
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:22,543
Yeah! You look tasty.

542
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:26,055
We're gonna get killed.

543
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:27,206
What?

544
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:29,103
We're gonna get killed!

545
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:30,524
Why?

546
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,217
This thing still doesn't work!

547
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:35,417
Maybe we need to get
some batteries for it.

548
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,342
No. It doesn't use batteries,
it uses a...

549
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:40,607
recharger.

550
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:51,700
Is it ready?

551
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,173
Is it ready?

552
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:58,574
No.

553
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,053
Fire truck's in here.

554
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:19,886
Ned Schmecker!

555
00:33:21,672 --> 00:33:23,316
Meet the Schmecker Checkers!

556
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:24,651
Nice!

557
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:39,823
- He can't flame up. It worked!
- Of course it works, we're pimps!

558
00:33:40,056 --> 00:33:42,377
- We are, aren't we?
- Look at how we dressed!

559
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:43,663
Didn't even need this!

560
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:57,291
No, wait. Wait, wait!

561
00:33:58,015 --> 00:34:00,476
So, what do you... You use free weights?

562
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:02,981
You work out?
What do you bench? Like 240?

563
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:29,216
Sam! Sam, are you doin' this?

564
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:33,303
Sam, you're doin' it!

565
00:34:44,308 --> 00:34:45,333
Yes!

566
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,192
Yes! Biatch!

567
00:34:47,411 --> 00:34:50,486
You are Neo, you're the one!
Eat it, heat miser!

568
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,712
I've never been so attracted
to a man in my life!

569
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,667
That's not what I meant.

570
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:23,103
I'm pretty sure I wet my pants.

571
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,991
DMV. This is the portal?

572
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:37,826
Hell on earth.

573
00:35:38,058 --> 00:35:39,058
Right.

574
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:40,370
Which one do we go to?

575
00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:45,917
Right there.

576
00:35:54,664 --> 00:35:55,886
Fugitive transfer?

577
00:35:56,509 --> 00:35:57,512
Er... yes.

578
00:35:58,204 --> 00:36:01,553
- I think so.
- Place the vessel on the mat.

579
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:07,074
Never seen one of these before.

580
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:17,949
Have a nice day!

581
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:20,827
Wait, wait...
So, they're not all little vacuums?

582
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:24,705
The boss gives you the vessel
he thinks you can handle.

583
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,876
You must be a real moron!

584
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:33,757
DMV!

585
00:36:34,783 --> 00:36:36,163
Have a nice day.

586
00:36:43,817 --> 00:36:45,018
You're still mad.

587
00:36:46,765 --> 00:36:47,945
Yeah, right.

588
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:51,024
Of course you are. I snapped at you
like a jerk at the hospital.

589
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:52,776
Look...

590
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:56,309
I'm really sorry. OK?

591
00:36:56,446 --> 00:36:59,919
And I understand if you don't
wanna talk to me any more, but...

592
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:03,870
I really hope you'll 'cause my life
would suck more if we weren't friends.

593
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:13,421
Look, I know it was a horrible day.
It's alright...

594
00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:19,219
- Haven't wrecked it yet.
- Oh, good.

595
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:22,631
- What does this symbol mean?
- It's says "bola".

596
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,271
It's Sanskrit for "strength".

597
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,518
I dunno how but I thought of you.

598
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:30,649
And, by the way, I don't think
you're a loser, Sam. I like you.

599
00:37:30,787 --> 00:37:32,810
I love working with you guys.

600
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,747
You know, ever since my dad died...

601
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,379
My job is the best thing in my life,
is all I'm saying.

602
00:37:44,112 --> 00:37:45,711
Pathetic, right?

603
00:37:46,383 --> 00:37:48,081
Nothing about you is pathetic, Andi.

604
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:51,584
That was such a tender moment.

605
00:37:52,084 --> 00:37:53,255
For real.

606
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:57,048
Can I talk to you for a seconde?
Just you... please...

607
00:37:57,168 --> 00:37:58,067
OK?

608
00:37:59,816 --> 00:38:01,278
What is wrong with you?

609
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:03,547
She's adorable! So sweet!

610
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,372
- Stay away from her, I swear to God...
- Swear to who?

611
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,747
Like I play in the kiddie pool.

612
00:38:09,384 --> 00:38:11,698
Sam, I just want to congratulate you.

613
00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:13,456
Great job with the arsonist.

614
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,942
You'll be happy to know
he's back where he belongs.

615
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:17,955
Getting his nuts burned off
for eternity.

616
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:19,516
Who's the hero, huh?

617
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,115
- Yeah...
- You're the hero, man!

618
00:38:21,238 --> 00:38:22,722
Pat yourself on the back!

619
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:25,920
I have a present for you.

620
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,279
A vessel for the next fugitive.

621
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:32,751
So, I'll have to do this forever.

622
00:38:32,946 --> 00:38:34,199
Well, yeah!

623
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:36,421
Well, I mean, technically not forever.

624
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:38,331
You're done when you die, right?

625
00:38:40,682 --> 00:38:43,404
Come on, I just bought a bunch of crap
and gave you the sale.

626
00:38:43,607 --> 00:38:44,851
For the contest.

627
00:38:45,015 --> 00:38:46,556
You gonna win that ham, man.

628
00:38:48,691 --> 00:38:49,894
That was nice!

629
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:52,805
I can be nice!

630
00:39:11,926 --> 00:39:14,222
I'm not really a ham guy,
but this is pretty good.

631
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:16,901
That's because it's a victory ham.

632
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:19,040
You sent a monster back to hell, buddy.

633
00:39:19,163 --> 00:39:20,611
- I did.
- The ham tastes better

634
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,258
because it's the spoils of victory.

635
00:39:23,276 --> 00:39:24,302
Plus it's glazed.

636
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:28,950
- You like that? Glazed? Funny, right?
- No, it's just... It's like...

637
00:39:30,103 --> 00:39:32,351
My mom and dad
sold my soul to the devil.

638
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:35,021
And I'm his indentured servant.
How crazy is that?

639
00:39:35,631 --> 00:39:38,566
My dad forgot to pick me up
from a sleep away camp for 3 days.

640
00:39:38,686 --> 00:39:41,342
- Hardly the same thing, Sock.
- Camp was over, Sam.

641
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:42,612
How sad is that?

642
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,783
Anyway, you can blow
the whole thing off if you want to.

643
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:50,829
Just tell the devil to eat it. If you
don't wanna do something, don't do it.

644
00:39:51,075 --> 00:39:53,311
No, but I think I do. I think I want to.

645
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:55,476
After all this, it's like I...

646
00:39:55,745 --> 00:39:57,144
I feel like a grown-up. Kinda.

647
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,965
I mean kinda, I feel...

648
00:39:59,317 --> 00:40:00,642
responsible now.

649
00:40:01,558 --> 00:40:03,089
We'll help you, Sam.

650
00:40:07,164 --> 00:40:08,528
Thanks, buddy.
